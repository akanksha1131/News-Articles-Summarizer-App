Virat & Rohit’s Home Struggles: Left-Arm Spin & Lost Intent? | Beyond the Boundary Highlights

""I don't know why people were after me. I don't know why people have been questioning my technique or temperament so much.""With eyes that were holding back tears that could flood the Pacific, this was 23-year-old Virat Kohli speaking to the media in Perth in January 2012. He had just top-scored with 44 on a bouncy WACA pitch in a shambolic Indian innings of 161 on Day One of the third Test during a series that resembled a horror show for India.Kohli's emotional burst was in response to a tweet by a former cricketer who had posted on Testeve, ""Give Kohli another game just to be sure he does not belong here.""Perth showed that Kohli belonged. He top-scored with 75 in the second innings too as India were dismissed for 171 to lose by an innings and plenty during a 4-0 shellacking.Cut to 2024. The Indian great is back at the venue where he first established his credentials as a Test batter. Can the WACA, where the Team India is camping for match simulation and preparing for the opening contest of theBorder Gavaskar Trophy at the nearby Optus Stadium from Friday, be the venue for his renaissance too?A look at the Australian media, which often doesn't hesitate to play 12th man for the team, makes you believe so. India's arrival in Australia was announced with glowing full-page write-ups on Kohli in some of the leading Australian publications with Hindi and Punjabi headlines.So what if he has scored only two centuries in the last five years and his average, once a proud 55, has plummeted to 47.83?Ironically, the same media had painted him as a villain when the batter flicked the bird at a section of a raucous Sydney crowd which was giving him grief on the boundary.The prickly 23-year-old was mercilessly sledged by the Aussie players too during his maiden Test hundred in Adelaide in the fourth Test. ""To give it back verbally and then score a hundred is even better,"" he said in the presser after his 116.In the same interaction, he slammed the SCG crowd too.""Don't get drunk and abuse players."" Touche. Perth and Adelaide 2012 had given Kohli his passport to stardom. Adelaide 2014, though, was a visa to greatness. Leading India for the first time, he struck a hundred in each innings. (115, 141). The second ton was a clinic in mastering spinning conditions.It also offered fans a window into his captaincy style: ""Play to win."" India made a spirited dash at the target of 364 and fell 48 short. The crowds lapped up Kohli's spunk. The spicy duels with Mitchell Johnson , especially during his 169 in the Boxing Day Test at MCG, were peak cinema.At one point he drove Johnson straight, only to see the bowler stop the ball in his follow through and hurl it back to hit him. Kohli followed up by drilling Johnson through cover and blowing a kiss.A Kohli press conference was the place to be at after such antics. Sample this: ""There's no good reason that I should respect some people when they are not respecting me."" Or this: ""They were calling me a spoilt brat, and I said, 'That's the way I am. You guys hate me. I like that.'""More? ""I like playing against Australia because it is very hard for them to stay calm. I don't mind an argument. They don't seem to be learning the lesson.""Kohli was all passion and fire in 2014. Four years later, he married maturity with those traits. Already the world's premier attacking batter across formats, Kohli showed how much he could romance struggle in the second Test as he compiled 123 off 257 balls at the Optus in hellish batting conditions.After driving Mitchell Starc down the ground to reach three figures, he pointed to the bat, opened and closed his fist to say, 'My bat talks now.'India lost the Test but won the 2018 series 2-1. Ex-players had begun to hail Kohli as the ideal brand ambassador for Test cricket when it was being challenged by shorter formats. When Australia welcomed him again at the height of the Covid pandemic in Dec 2020, it was already announced that Kohli would play only the first Test, the pink ball D/N fixture at Adelaide.Interestingly, his favourite venue had even offered to host his wedding in 2017. Kohli produced yet another defensive classic, a solid 74 off 180 balls before a misunderstanding with Ajinkya Rahane saw him get run out and limit India's first innings total.India were infamously bowled out for 36 in the second innings to lose that Test. And though under Rahane, they won an epic series 2-1, Kohli had nothing to do with that triumph. He was in India for the birth of his first child.In the twilight of his career now, and with peers going past him in the quest for batting immortality, can Kohli summon one last effort and reclaim his aura in the land where he earned it first.Now, only if the Aussies stopped being so nice to him.","Virat Kohli is back at the venue where he first established his credentials as a Test batter. The 23-year-old has scored only two centuries in the last five years and his average, once a proud 55, has plummeted to 47.83. The WACA, where the Team India is camping for match simulation, is the venue for the opening contest of theBorder Gavaskar Trophy.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115433268,imgsize-43600,width-400,resizemode-4/115433268.jpg"
'Impossible' Jasprit Bumrah is the most feared bowler of his generation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/india-in-australia/impossible-jasprit-bumrah-is-the-most-feared-bowler-of-his-generation-border-gavaskar-trophy-india-vs-australia/articleshow/115433383.cms,"Australian batters are bracing for a challenging summer against India's bowling spearhead, Jasprit Bumrah, in the upcoming Border Gavaskar Trophy. Bumrah's awkward action, deceptive pace and ability to swing the ball both ways can instil fear in the hearts of Australian batsmen, who are gearing up to face the right-arm pacer in the first Test beginning November 22 in Perth.

'HE IS EXCEPTIONAL'

If there's one player, other than Virat Kohli, who has drawn the most attention ahead of the coming Border Gavaskar Trophy (BGT) in Australia, it's India's bowling spearhead and vice-captain Jasprit Bumrah , whom 'Fox Cricket ' described as the first visiting fast bowler ""since the golden era of the West Indies in the 1970s"" to have ""struck fear into the hearts of Australians"".Not just the leader of India's attack, Bumrah has also led the revolution in the country's fast-bowling history by excelling in different countries, all formats and on varying pitches, including the tracks at home and in the subcontinent that favour the spinners. That's where his skills and contribution stand out.And when it comes to Australia, he just smacks his lips and ""tiptoes"" in to deliver those unplayable lines and lengths while swinging the ball both ways at upwards of 140kmph, with a toe-crushing yorker quietly slipped in.His 32 wickets at an average of 21.25 during India's historic back-to-back triumphs on their last two tours of Australia were central to those victories.'Fox Cricket' went knocking at the door of some of Australia's leading batters, who will be part of the five-match BGT commencing with the first Test at the Optus Stadium in Perth from November 22, to ask what it is like to face Bumrah.""Impossible"" - replied batter Travis Head when asked about his experience of batting against the Indian pacer. ""You try to feel like you're one step ahead, but it always feels like he's that next step. Any format of the game, he's incredible. He's their X-factor, he's the guy they go to every time; and more often than not, he's able to produce for them. In big moments you want big players, and I think he's their biggest.""You have got your work cut out as a batter. He's someone that's going to be difficult over summer,"" he added.Highlighting Bumrah's awkward stiff-arm delivery stride at the end of a short run-up that begins with a tip-toe walk, opening batter Usman Khawaja compared Bumrah to Mitchell Johnson.""When I first faced Bumrah, I was like, 'Oh where did that come from?'"" said Khawaja.""It comes at you a little bit quicker than you expect because of the awkwardness of his action and how he releases the ball, much like Mitchell Johnson; he had a weird action too. The ball used to come out and felt like it got to you quicker because you didn't get a look at it the whole way. Jasprit is a little bit the same, with arms going everywhere.""Australia's former captain Steve Smith has enjoyed a fair bit of success against Bumrah, but he said it's especially not easy to face him for the first few deliveries because of his ""awkward"" bowling action.""He's just awkward with the way he bowls. It's obviously very different to a lot of other people. It takes a little bit getting used to. I have played against him quite a lot now, and it still takes a couple of balls to get used to the different rhythm.""Former Australia all-rounder Shane Watson explained to 'Fox Cricket' how Bumrah manages to generate so much pace from a short run-up that does not include running at speed.""He is not reliant on run-up speed, so he is not reliant on the real physicality of running in, which is normally where a lot of fast bowlers get tired, while he just tiptoes in,"" said Watson. ""But because of his freakish co-ordination, the ball just flies out of his hand.""Watson added: ""His release point’s different as well. His release point is way in front of the crease, so it actually feels like he's bowling nearly on top of you. There's a shorter gap between the ball coming out and the ball hitting your bat.""Watson, who retired from all forms of cricket in 2020, shared his experience of facing Bumrah, when he used to rely more on deliveries swinging in.""From when I first faced him, he was only an in-swing bowler with variations of speed in T20 cricket, but now for the last number of years, he swings it both ways at speed,"" he said. ""The batters who score runs against him, they are absolutely going to be at their very best, because he's that good."" Marnus Labuschagne was the top-scorer in the last BGT played in Australia, scoring 426 runs and therefore had a fair measure of Bumrah during those eight innings four summers ago.Like some of his fellow batters in the Australia squad, Labuschagne also highlighted the element of surprising speed that Bumrah generates and then backs it up by controlling his line, length and swing to perfection.""His run-up doesn't match the speed he bowls, so you can get done by the pace a little bit if he's just skidding it through,"" said the Australian. ""He can swing the ball both ways, he can nip it, and because he's a class bowler, he's got a bouncer up his sleeve so he can use that as well to put you under pressure.""Whether he goes out-swing or in-swing, I don't think the seam moves. It's straight. To be the best in India, where they love cricket, you've got to be exceptional, and that's what he is,"" Labuschagne concluded.Bumrah will lead India in the first Test of this BGT because the designated skipper Rohit Sharma, who became a father recently, will be unavailable for the game in Perth.","Jasprit Bumrah is India's bowling spearhead and vice-captain. The right-arm pacer is the first visiting fast bowler since the golden era of the West Indies in the 1970s to have ""struck fear into the hearts of Australians"" He has taken 32 wickets at an average of 21.25 during India's historic back-to-back triumphs on their last two tours of Australia.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115433383,imgsize-39334,width-400,resizemode-4/115433383.jpg"

A tour of Australia is often the toughest challenge in world cricket, testing players with world-class opposition, rock-hard pitches, sprawling outfields, hostile crowds and an unrelenting media. Yet, some Indian players have come through the test of fire and emerged with flying colours.India's five-Test series in Australia was a forgettable 4-0 thrashing. Yet, it unearthed two stars legends. Sachin Tendulkar, an 18-year-old prodigy, announced himself with a stellar unbeaten 148 in Sydney and a brave 114 on the bouncy Perth track. His 368 runs were the highest for India in the series.Srinath bowled with pace and bounce, showing immense promise. Though his 10 wickets at 55.30 didn't reflect his impact, he displayed the raw talent that would make him India's pace spearhead.Amid a disappointing series, VVS Laxman carved out one of his finest knocks. His scintillating 167 off 198 balls at the SCG stood out for its elegance and dominance against a formidable Australian attack. It was a counter-attacking masterpiece that earned him respect from fans and foes.At just 19, Irfan Pathan made his debut in the second Test in Adelaide on the 2003-04 tour. Bowling with reverse swing and precision, he dismissed legends like Steve Waugh and Adam Gilchrist, hinting at his immense potential despite modest returns (4 wickets at 66.50).Known for his audacious strokeplay, Sehwag lit up the MCG with a swashbuckling 195 off 233 balls. Though he missed a double ton, his knock left an indelible mark, cementing his reputation as a fearless opener.Ishant Sharma, all of 19, produced one of the most memorable spells at the WACA, tormenting Ricky Ponting with pace, bounce, and relentless accuracy and eventually dismissing the Australian skipper in both innings. This fiery spell not only helped India win the Test but also changed Ishant's career trajectory.Pujara was the cornerstone of India's historic first series win in Australia. Scoring 521 at 74.42 with three centuries and facing 1258 deliveries, Pujara's marathon knocks blunted Australia's attack, frustrated bowlers and helped India achieve a landmark 2-1 victory.During the 2020-21 tour, Pujara was again his resolute self, scoring three half-centuries to play a key role in India's 2-1 triumph. Overall, the No. 3 batsman has made 993 runs in 11 Tests across three tours, facing a total of 2657 balls!In the 2011-12 tour, a young Virat Kohli stood tall amidst India's 4-0 whitewash, scoring his maiden Test hundred (116) in Adelaide. It was a gallant knock that showcased his grit and determination. By the 2013-14 series, Kohli had evolved into a leader and batting maestro. As captain, he led with intent, scoring 692 runs at 86.50, including four centuries.Touring Australia for the first time, Rishabh Pant impressed with 350 runs, including a brilliant 159* at the SCG. In 2020-21, Pant became a phenomenon. His heroic 97 in Sydney saved a Test, while his unbeaten 89 in Brisbane helped Ajinkya Rahane & Co. pull off an incredible heist - a 329-run chase on the fifth and final day as Australia lost a Test at the Gabba for the first time since 1988. India won the series 2-1.Mohammed Siraj, shouldering the pace attack amid injuries, took 13 wickets, including a five-wicket haul (5/73) in Brisbane, despite grappling with personal tragedy.Shubman Gill, making his Test debut, scored 259 runs at 51.80. While many remember Pant for the Gabba heist, Gill's 91 while opening the innings was equally crucial.","India's five-Test series in Australia was a forgettable 4-0 thrashing.

NEW DELHI: Team India would be eyeing their third successive Test series win on the trot in Australia and the Aussies would be looking to go all guns blazing to stop the Indians in their bid in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy .With captain Rohit Sharma set to miss the first Test in Perth, pressure will be on rest of the Indian batters to come good in the series.And the maximum pressure undoubtedly will be on India batting mainstay and former captain Virat Kohli With 6 hundreds from 13 Tests in Australia at an average of 54.08, Kohli has a phenomenal record in Australia but has averaged merely 22.72 in six matches in 2024, the lowest in his career.Former Australia captain Michael Clarke picked Virat Kohli and flamboyant keeper-batter Rishabh Pant to play decisive roles for India to win the series in Australia.""Virat Kohli's record in Australia in phenomenal. I actually think his record is better than what it is in India. I think he's got six hundreds in 13 Tests in Australia,"" Clarke says during an interview.The 36-year-old Kohli has scored just one fifty this year - 70 against New Zealand in the second innings of the first Test at Bengaluru, while his last Test century came in July 2023 against the West Indies.With India set to play the first Test in Perth from November 22, Kohli can hope to strike form from the word go.Kohli has till now played two Tests in Perth - one at the WACA in which he scored 44 and 75 in the two innings in January 2012 which Australia won by an innings and 37 runs.The second Test that Kohli played in Perth was as captain in 2018 and he became the first batsman to score a Test hundred at the new Perth stadium as he scored his 25th Test century at the age of 30.Clarke continues, ""If India are to win this series, it has to be Virat Kohli leading run scorer with Rishabh Pant just behind.""During the fourth and final Test of India's last tour of Australia at the Gabba in January 2021, Rishabh Pant played one of the most iconic innings in Test cricket history.Pant played a fearless, match-winning knock, scoring an unbeaten 89 off 138 balls to chase down 328 runs on the fifth day as India achieved a record-breaking victory at the Gabba, a venue where Australia had been undefeated in Tests for 32 years.The innings highlighted Pant's fearless approach and unyielding belief, even under immense pressure.

NEW DELHI: Ahead of Jake Paul’s blockbuster boxing match against the legendary Mike Tyson , a leaked fake script surfaced online, igniting speculation and excitement among fans.The fabricated document detailed a supposed Round 5 knockout victory for Paul, mimicking a similar hoax that circulated before Paul’s fight against Tommy Fury .Despite the buzz, there was no evidence to suggest the match was fixed.Instead, fans were treated to a legitimate showdown at AT&T Stadium in Dallas, where Paul claimed a hard-fought unanimous decision victory.The highly anticipated bout, delayed from its original July 20 date due to Tyson’s health issues, marked the 58-year-old former champion’s return to professional boxing after 19 years.Tyson entered the ring to deafening cheers from the crowd, while Paul, greeted with boos, relied on strategy and stamina to outlast the heavyweight icon.Tyson showed glimpses of his old brilliance early on, controlling the first two rounds with sharp, aggressive punches that forced Paul into defensive positions.The opening round saw Tyson land clean blows in the corner, while the second round mirrored his dominance as he capitalized on Paul’s low guard.However, by the third round, Paul began to find his rhythm. A triple jab rocked Tyson, pushing him to the ropes and signalling a shift in momentum. By Round 4, Tyson’s fatigue became evident, and Paul exploited the opportunity, landing precise body shots and controlling the pace.Heading into the final rounds with a slim 48-47 lead, Paul maintained his composure. Despite the crowd’s chants urging Tyson to mount a comeback, the 27-year-old boxer continued to dictate terms, ultimately securing a unanimous decision.

Dhruv Jurel Makes a Solid Impression With Gritty 80 vs AUS at the MCG

India opted for closed-door practice sessions in Perth ahead of the series-opening Test of the Border Gavaskar Trophy (BGT), and former Pakistan batter Basit Ali feels it shows that the Indian team isn't confident about their title-defence.India have had a strong hold on the BGT, thwarting Australia's challenge for a decade. India's reign also includes historic triumphs Down Under on their last two tours.But going into this BGT, India haven't shown consistent red-ball form and got washed out 0-3 in the home Test series against New Zealand before flying to Australia. Add to that the woeful form of their star batters Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma , the problems seem compounded.India flew to Australia without Rohit, who recently became father again, and he won't be available for the opening match of the five-Test series. The visitors canceled their official warm-up match against India 'A' to spend more time in the nets and played an intra-squad match, which were hidden from public view at the WACA stadium.Before that, wicketkeeper-batsman Dhruv Jurel, was flown to Australia early to play in the unofficial Test between India A and Australia A in Melbourne. Grabbing the opportunity, Jurel stuck in to impress with knocks of 80 and 68 in the two innings to knock at the doors of head coach Gautam Gambhir for a place in the eleven for the Perth Test.""My personal opinion is that Jurel, who is in form, should be included in the playing eleven,"" said Basit in a video on his YouTube channel. ""In Australia, whosoever is in form should be played...So what if he (usually) bats at No. 5 or 6! Push him to No. 3. He has guts, is a good player of the cut and pull shots. It might pay.""Basit added that close-door practice sessions only show that India's confidence is low.""The Indian team's confidence at the moment is down. Chhup ke toh practice kar rahe hain, maafi ke saath bolna pad raha hai (they are practising behind closed doors, sorry to say that)...The kind of preparation they should have had before the series is not there, whether you reach 12 days before or 12 months before (the tour). This is not the way.

In India, there are one and a half billion cricket-loving people, and then count all the rest around the world, they expect nothing but excellence, and the team will be under intense pressure, so how they fight back will be important."" said Langer to The West Australian on Sunday.Langer acknowledged the pressure on the Indian team but expressed his belief in their ability to bounce back. He also highlighted the star power within the Indian lineup, urging fans to savor their presence.“And they’ll be getting written off for being too old, but people say that all the time, and I just can’t wait to see them play. I just hope, if this is the last time (Kohli) is out here, people enjoy it because he is a superstar, so is Rohit Sharma , so is (Ravi) Ashwin, so is (Ravi) Jadeja, so is (Jasprit) Bumrah.""He drew parallels between the Australian and Indian teams, both boasting experienced bowling attacks, and encouraged fans to appreciate these players while they are still active.“It’s the same with the Australians; the bowling attack is a very senior attack now... so really enjoy it while you can; they are not going to be around forever,”To secure a spot in the World Test Championship final at Lord's next year, India needs to win at least four matches in the series.Langer believes India's recent loss to New Zealand might fuel their determination, making them a formidable opponent for Australia.“India losing to New Zealand is a bit like North Melbourne beating Brisbane in the grand final at the moment. And not for one millisecond is that disrespect for New Zealand, because they are the great overachievers; they are brilliant.""He acknowledged New Zealand's achievement in winning the series 3-0, emphasizing the pressure India will face to make amends for their performance.“I think they’d won two Test matches (in India), and to win the series 3-0, that’s an amazing achievement. They’ve just been beaten three-nil by New Zealand, so India will be humbled by that and equally determined to remedy it because the pressure on them will be intense.”","Former Australia head coach Justin Langer has cautioned the hosts against underestimating India.

Aussie top order not in best form

Conflicted about waking up early on Friday for the start of the Border Gavaskar Trophy? You clearly have a reason after what happened over the last one month in India, when Rohit Sharma's boys were handed a 0-3 humiliation by New Zealand at home.The World Test Championship Final berth, which looked likely before the start of the season, now looks a distant dream as Australian pacers lick their lips on a spicy Perth surface, known for its tennis-ball bounce.But if you can look through the mist of disappointment, you may figure a hint of silver lining as the Indian side prepares for a response. What exactly should give the Indian cricket fan some hope ahead of this massive challenge?It's the Indian pace attack, which is one of the best in the business. In Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammed Siraj , Akash Deep , Prasidh Krishna and Harshit Rana , the fast bowlers have all the ingredients to do well in Australia. This lot hardly had a role to play in the New Zealand debacle as the spinners called the shots on surfaces which were a little too spin-friendly for everybody's liking.The pitches in Australia will be completely different. The crucial thing about bowling in Australia is to understand the lengths to hit. While Bumrah, arguably the best paceman in the world across formats, has all the experience, Siraj, too, is a perfect fit for the fast and bouncy tracks. If Mohammed Shami can return sometime later on in the series, it will be the icing on the cake.Bumrah had 21 wickets in the 2018-19 series win. In Brisbane in January 2021, Siraj got 5-73 in the second innings that kept India's target to manageable proportions and allowed Rishabh Pant to go for that almighty chase.""Akash Deep has shown that he can be equally effective both against right-handers and lefthanders. He should be the third pacer and if there is a little bit of help for the seamers, all three can be as good as their Aussie counterparts,"" former India paceman L Balaji, who has experience of touring Down Under, told TOI.Balaji, who was edged out by Morne Morkel for the bowling coach's job a couple of months ago, wants India to play with only four bowlers in the first Test, the fourth being Ravindra Jadeja ""You don't need more than four bowlers on a spicy surface in Australia. The batters have to give a minimum of 250 to allow the bowlers to stay in the fight and for that, a proper batter at No. 7 is necessary,"" Balaji said.That brings us to the most crucial issue, the batting frailties of India in recent times. On a pitch which had a bit of help for pacers in Bengaluru in the first Test against New Zealand, India were bowled out for 46 by the Kiwi pacers, and the Aussie team management must have taken note of that.Having said that, the Australian top-order isn't in the best of form. While Usman Khawaja, in all probability, is playing his last home series, the hosts have a new makeshift opener in Nathan McSweeney, who will be making his debut in Perth. Marnus Labuschagne and Steve Smith haven't been in great form either, while Mitchell Marsh hasn't been too much of a headache for Indian bowlers ever. That leaves the top-order with Travis Head, a real thorn in the flesh for India in recent times, and a dependable wicketkeeper-batter Alex Carey.But if we have to do a man-to-man analysis, is Carey a better bet than Pant? You can make your own calculations. Add to that the fact that this Australian team, not too long ago, lost a Test against lowly West Indies at home, that exposed all the frailties in their batting.""The Indian bowling attack is perfectly capable of keeping this Australian batting line-up to a score of below 250, especially when there is a bit of help. From there on, it can become a batters' game and the likes of Kohli, Pant, Yashasvi Jaiswal and Shubman Gill (though out of first Test with finger injury), have the capability to score big in Australia,"" Balaji said.It's not going to be easy, but then, historically, when has a tour of Australia been smooth sailing? Be it Melbourne in 1980-81, Perth in 2007-08 or Brisbane in 2020-21, India hit back really hard when the chips were truly down. The Aussies too know that this Indian lot is made of some stern mettle and they experienced that first-hand twice at home not too long ago. Will the trend continue?",India take on Australia in first Test of Border-Gavaskar Trophy in Perth. Rohit Sharma's side were beaten 0-3 by New Zealand at home. India's fast bowlers have all the ingredients to do well in Australia. Australia's top-order is not in best form.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115399180,imgsize-78458,width-400,resizemode-4/115399180.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Former India head coach Ravi Shastri has advised Team India to move past their 0-3 defeat to New Zealand and concentrate on upcoming Border-Gavaskar Trophy against Australia.The unprecedented whitewash under Rohit Sharma 's leadership marked India's first home Test series defeat in 12 years, significantly impacting their ICC World Test Championship standings position.Shastri maintains a positive outlook regarding India's prospects of qualifying for the World Test Championship Final at Lord's next year, encouraging the team to maintain an optimistic approach.""India will be smarting from that defeat in the series against New Zealand because they were caught unawares. They were a little complacent and paid the price for it.

The best way to bounce back from such a series is to start another one strongly. So, the first two Tests become extremely crucial,"" he stated.The 62-year-old advised the team management to concentrate on previous achievements and take inspiration from their successful Australian tours.India achieved their first Test series victory in Australia in 2018 under Virat Kohli 's captaincy, subsequently replicating this success in 2021 despite the absence of several key players.""The key will be to ensure they start well and keep the players in a good frame of mind. That will be the coach's most important task,"" Shastri added.He highlighted the potential role of India's batsmen in establishing an early advantage.""Confidence is key. They must focus on the positives, think about what they achieved in Australia last time, and build on that. Put the New Zealand loss behind them.

Squad:

NEW DELHI: Mohammed Shami will represent Bengal in the upcoming Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy , as announced in the squad released by the Cricket Association of Bengal on Monday.Following his extended injury break, the Indian fast bowler is preparing for his second consecutive domestic competition, having recently participated in Bengal's Ranji Trophy match against Madhya Pradesh in the fifth round.During that match, Shami demonstrated his prowess by taking seven wickets, including three top-order batsmen and four lower-order players, across approximately 44 overs. He also contributed significantly with the bat, scoring 36 runs.His form is a positive sign for Team India, which is heading to Australia with a relatively inexperienced pace attack for the Border-Gavaskar Trophy series, starting next week in Perth.Shami's return to domestic cricket marked an important step in his comeback journey. He had been in sensational form during the ODI World Cup 2023, finishing as the tournament's leading wicket-taker with 24 wickets in seven matches at an average of 10.70, including three five-wicket hauls.His best performance came in the semi-final against New Zealand, where he claimed 7/57. However, after India's heartbreaking loss to Australia in the final, the team redeemed themselves with a T20 World Cup win in the Caribbean, though Shami was forced to watch from the sidelines due to injury.With his domestic cricket return, Shami will be looking to reclaim his spot in the Indian team ahead of the ICC Champions Trophy and the Indian Premier League in 2025.If included in the squad for the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, Shami's experience would be invaluable, particularly given India's inexperienced pace attack. The bowling line-up features Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammed Siraj, and promising talents such as Harshit Rana, Prasidh Krishna, all-rounder Nitish Kumar Reddy, and Akash Deep.Shami has an impressive Test record in Australia, with 31 wickets in eight matches at an average of 32.16, including best figures of 6/56.Sudip Kumar Gharami (C), Abishek Porel (wk), Sudip Chatterjee, Shahbaz Ahmed, Karan Lal, Writtick Chatterjee, Ritwick Roy Chowdhury, Shakir Habib Gandhi (wk), Ranjot Singh Khaira, Prayas Ray Barman, Agniv Pan (wk), Pradipta Pramanik, Saksham Chaudhary, Mohammed Shami, Ishan Porel, Mohammed Kaif, Suraj Sindhu Jaiswal, Sayan Ghosh, Kanishk Seth and Soummyadip Mandal.",Mohammed Shami will represent Bengal in the upcoming Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy.

""We've come close on a couple of occasions and the next step is for me and the other boys to win.""We have a new coach coming in March.

We need to improve in everything,"" Manolo said on Sunday at the pre-match press conference.""For example, people say you played a great second half in Vietnam. I say 'yes', but we still made some big mistake that almost made us lose the game. We need to work on that. The team with less mistakes usually are the one who wins the game.""We will try to play a good game with fewer mistakes than Malaysia. We know the style of Malaysia, I know the coach perfectly (well). They play good football and it will be a tough game for both teams,"" said Manolo.The two sides have faced each other 32 times and there's nothing to separate the two sides in head-to-head results. The Blue Tigers and the Harimau Malaya have won 12 matches each, while eight have ended in draws.There is also little difference in the current FIFA rankings , with India placed 125th and Malaysia 133rd.""It's a friendly game but it will be good to check the level against a Pot 2 team (Malaysia) in the qualifiers. We have gone a long time without a win, so obviously we want to win. We want to show the improvement that we've been making in every training session,"" said Manolo.The draw for the Asian Cup Qualifiers will be held on December 9. India, ranked 125, will be placed in Pot 1, while Malaysia, ranked 133, will be in Pot 2. Irrespective of the result of the Monday's game, India will maintain their position in Pot 1.Manolo said senior player and central defender Sandesh Jhingan , who is returning to action after recovering from an injury he sustained 10 months ago, is the ""most difficult Indian player to be replaced"".""You don't have these kinds of players. Not that he is Messi but because he is very important in the team, in terms of the leadership, how he performs, the character he is.""Forward Edmund Lalrindika , who accompanied Manolo in the press conference, said, ""This is our third camp with coach Manolo. He is a really great coach. The preparations have been good. Everyone is comfortable with him. I enjoy training with him. We all know what he wants from us. We're looking forward to tomorrow.""The India-Malaysia football rivalry goes back a long way -- since their first meeting in a 1957 friendly in Kuala Lumpur, which India won 3-0, until last year's Merdeka tournament semifinal clash in which Malaysia emerged 4-2 winners.Like Manolo, Malaysia head coach Pau Martí also hails from Barcelona and took charge of Harimau Malaya in July. Under him, they won the Merdeka tournament in September and lost 0-4 to New Zealand last month.Malaysia beat Laos 3-1 in a friendly in Bangkok on November 14 and arrived in India from the Thai capital late on Saturday night.""I am very excited to play against Manolo. He is a great coach with a lot of experience. We are from the same city. He coached many clubs at different levels, from the fourth tier to LaLiga. For coaches from Barcelona, Manolo is an inspiration.""He has been in India for three or four years, working with different clubs. I'm sure the Indian team will be well prepared,"" said Martí.""I believe it's very tough to play here. We expect a very difficult game. For us as a team, we have to improve our record away from home. It's been difficult to win away. So I think it will be a good challenge and opportunity for us,"" the Malaysian coach added.",India plays Malaysia in an international friendly in Hyderabad on Monday. India has not won in three matches under new coach Marquez Manolo. The match will be India's last before the 2027 Asian Cup Qualifiers in March next year.

'Not a medical department': Neymar Jr faces transfer rejection from Brazilian club,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/not-a-medical-department-neymar-jr-faces-transfer-rejection-from-brazilian-club/articleshow/115382661.cms,"Neymar Jr (Photo by Francois Nel/Getty Images)

NEW DELHI: Brazilian club Palmeiras president Leila Pereira has firmly dismissed rumours linking Neymar Jr to her club, blatantly saying that she would consider bringing in players who are not match-ready.“Neymar will not join Palmeiras; this club isn’t a medical department,” Pereira said. “I want someone who can join immediately and play tomorrow if the manager wishes. I won’t accept us signing a player who’s unfit to play.”The statement comes amid Neymar’s ongoing injury woes.The Brazilian star, currently playing for Saudi Arabian club Al-Hilal, is sidelined due to a muscle issue. This setback has fueled speculation about his future with the club, particularly since he has struggled to make an impact since his high-profile transfer in August 2023.Neymar returned to action during Al-Hilal’s 3-0 AFC Champions League Elite victory over Iran's Esteghlal. Substituted in the 58th minute, his appearance marked only his second for the club in the respective competition following a year-long recovery from a serious injury.However, he was forced to leave the pitch after pulling up in the game’s closing moments.Al-Hilal coach Jorge Jesus later clarified that the injury was muscular and unrelated to Neymar's previous knee issues, estimating a two-week recovery period.Neymar addressed the situation on social media, expressing cautious optimism. “Hopefully nothing too much,” he wrote. “After one year out, this happens. The doctors had already warned me, so I have to be careful and gradually play more minutes.”Reports in Saudi Arabian media suggest Neymar's absence might extend to three weeks.With his limited contributions so far—only seven matches since his $90 million transfer—there is growing uncertainty over whether Al-Hilal will register him for the second half of the Saudi Pro League season.The club currently has its maximum allocation of 10 foreign players for domestic competitions, though Neymar remains eligible for continental tournaments.A new registration window in January could provide a resolution, but for now, Neymar’s future remains in limbo, with Palmeiras making it clear they are not an option.",Palmeiras president Leila Pereira has dismissed rumours linking Neymar Jr to her club.

HOW MANY GRAND SLAM TITLES DID NADAL WIN?

NEW DELHI: Rafael Nadal will play for Spain in the Davis Cup finals, which begin Tuesday in front of a home crowd in Malaga, marking the beginning of his final appearance in professional tennis.The 38-year-old Rafael Nadal is the second of the so-called Big Three of men's tennis to retire from competition after more than two decades on the circuit. Novak Djokovic remains at the top of the game, while Roger Federer declared his retirement in 2022.Since the Davis Cup is a team competition and the so-called ""Final 8"" starts at the quarterfinal round, it's unclear exactly when Rafael Nadal will play his final match.On Tuesday, Spain will begin play against the Netherlands. If the Spaniards win that, they will play either Canada or Germany (who play each other on Wednesday) in the semifinals on Friday.Due to injuries, Nadal has not played much in each of the last two seasons; in 2024, he is merely 12-7. He lost to his longstanding nemesis and eventual gold medalist, Novak Djokovic, in the second round of the singles category at the Paris Olympics in early August.Nadal and Alcaraz advanced to the quarterfinals of the doubles tournament before retiring. Last month, Nadal also participated in two exhibition matches in Saudi Arabia.Nadal ends with 22 Grand Slam singles victories, more than Federer's 20 and only surpassed by Djokovic's 24 in tennis history.The breakdown: Fourteen in the French Open , four at the US Open , two at Wimbledon and two at the Australian Open. Nadal required nerve-numbing injections in his left foot to win his final major title in Paris in 2022.","Rafael Nadal will play for Spain in the Davis Cup finals, which begin Tuesday in front of a home crowd in Malaga.

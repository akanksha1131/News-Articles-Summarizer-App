NEW DELHI: Rajasthan Royals produced a commanding all-round performance to hand Punjab Kings a 50-run defeat in Mullanpur on Saturday. The win was set up by Yashasvi Jaiswal ’s classy 67 and sealed emphatically by Jofra Archer ’s devastating opening burst with the ball.Opening the innings, Jaiswal gave Rajasthan the perfect launchpad with a fluent 67 off just 45 balls. From the outset, Jaiswal looked in complete control, piercing the field with crisp boundaries and lifting the ball cleanly over the ropes. He struck three fours and five sixes in his knock, setting the tone for Royals’ massive 205/4.The left-hander paced his innings smartly, first settling in and then accelerating after the powerplay, particularly taking on leg-spinner Yuzvendra Chahal and Marcus Stoinis in the middle overs. His fifty was his first of the season and came at a crucial juncture with Rajasthan needing a strong start to bounce back from recent defeats.Jaiswal’s 89-run stand with Sanju Samson (38 off 26) put RR in control early. And after both departed, Riyan Parag (43* off 25) and Shimron Hetmyer (20 off 12) ensured the momentum never dipped, powering the Royals past the 200-run mark.While the batters did the job upfront, it was Jofra Archer who delivered the knockout blow with the ball.Bowling with pace and intent, Archer struck with the very first ball of the innings, removing Punjab opener Priyansh Arya for a duck. The searing delivery beat the batter for pace and rattled the stumps.But Archer wasn’t done.He returned later in the same over to deliver a body blow — the prized scalp of Punjab captain Shreyas Iyer. The right-hander was castled for 10, failing to read a skiddy delivery that breached his defense. Archer finished with figures of 3/25 from four overs, capping his fiery spell by dismissing Arshdeep Singh at the death.The rest of the Rajasthan attack supported him well, with Theekshana and Sandeep Sharma bagging two wickets each. The result was a comprehensive bowling effort that restricted PBKS to just 155/9 in 20 overs, falling 50 runs short.With this win, Rajasthan Royals not only boosted their net run rate but also regained some momentum, thanks to Jaiswal’s stroke-filled fifty and Archer’s thunderbolts with the new ball.","Rajasthan Royals beat Punjab Kings by 50 runs in IPL clash.

IPL: Fleming admits batting woes after CSK's third straight defeat

NEW DELHI: Chennai Super Kings (CSK) head coach Stephen Fleming has responded sharply to criticism directed at his team on Ravichandran Ashwin’s YouTube channel after their defeat to Delhi Capitals (DC) on Saturday.In a post-match press conference, Fleming appeared surprised when asked about the remarks, admitting he didn’t even know Ashwin had a YouTube channel.The controversy arose after a video featuring former RCB analyst Prasanna Agoram, popularly known as Pdogg, aired on Ashwin’s channel.During the episode, Pdogg questioned CSK's decision to play Afghanistan spinner Noor Ahmad over veterans like Ravindra Jadeja and Ashwin himself. The video was later taken down, sparking curiosity and speculation among fans and the media.When asked about the criticism, Fleming responded with calm dismissal: “I have no idea. I didn’t even know he had a channel, so I don’t follow that stuff. That’s irrelevant.”The incident comes at a tough time for CSK, who suffered their third consecutive loss in IPL 2025 after going down to Delhi Capitals (DC) by 25 runs at Chepauk — their first defeat to DC at home in 15 years.With this victory, DC topped the points table, while CSK find themselves under pressure in the mid-table shuffle.Despite a solid start by DC, thanks to KL Rahul’s composed 77 and some finishing firepower from Tristan Stubbs, CSK faltered in the chase.Star players like Devon Conway, Shivam Dube, and Jadeja failed to convert, while MS Dhoni’s late cameo couldn’t turn the tide.As questions swirl around CSK’s team selection and performance, Fleming’s dismissive stance signals the team’s intent to stay focused on the field -- not the noise off it.",Stephen Fleming responds sharply to criticism directed at his team on Ravichandran Ashwin’s YouTube channel.

NEW DELHI: Rajasthan Royals (RR), now back under the leadership of Sanju Samson , will take on an in-form Punjab Kings (PBKS) in a high-stakes Indian Premier League IPL ) 2025 clash on Saturday.A big focus of the match will be on a struggling Yashasvi Jaiswal , who will be eager to shift attention back to his batting. Jaiswal has had a turbulent few weeks — switching domestic allegiances from Mumbai to Goa amid reported internal rifts and posting underwhelming scores of 1, 29 and 4 in this IPL season. The 22-year-old southpaw, hungry for leadership roles, now finds himself needing runs more than ever, especially after being overlooked for the Champions Trophy squad.Samson’s return as captain comes after RR’s inconsistent run under stand-in skipper Riyan Parag, whose leadership failed to inspire despite a narrow win over Chennai Super Kings. The Royals’ batting remains heavily reliant on Samson, with Shimron Hetmyer expected to provide the finishing firepower. However, Jaiswal and Dhruv Jurel’s form will be key in putting up or chasing a big score.Punjab Kings, meanwhile, come in hot — led impressively by Shreyas Iyer , who has scored back-to-back half-centuries and already smashed 13 sixes in two games, equaling his tally from all of last season. Iyer's tactical nous has stood out too, with sharp field placements and smart bowling changes, including effective use of Glenn Maxwell the spinner, who’s looked sharper than even Yuzvendra Chahal.Rajasthan’s bowling attack — with Jofra Archer, Maheesh Theekshana, Wanindu Hasaranga, and Tushar Deshpande — is solid but not fearsome. Against a power-packed Punjab batting line-up, they will need a minimum of 210 on the board to feel safe.Shreyas Iyer (c), Priyansh Arya, Pyla Avinash, Harnoor Singh, Josh Inglis, Prabhsimran Singh, Vishnu Vinod, Nehal Wadhera, Azmatullah Omarzai, Aaron Hardie, Marco Jansen, Glenn Maxwell, Musheer Khan, Shashank Singh, Marcus Stoinis, Suryansh Shedge, Arshdeep Singh, Xavier Bartlett, Yuzvendra Chahal, Praveen Dubey, Lockie Ferguson, Harpreet Brar, Kuldeep Sen, Vijaykumar Vyshak, Yash Thakur.Sanju Samson (captain), Riyan Parag, Shubham Dubey, Vaibhav Suryavanshi, Kunal Rathore, Shimron Hetmyer, Yashasvi Jaiswal, Dhruv Jurel, Nitish Rana, Yudhvir Singh, Jofra Archer, Maheesh Theekshana, Wanindu Hasaranga, Akash Madhwal, Kumar Kartikeya Singh, Tushar Deshpande, Fazalhaq Farooqi, Kwena Maphaka, Ashok Sharma, Sandeep Sharma.",Rajasthan Royals (RR) take on Punjab Kings (PBKS) in a high-stakes Indian Premier League IPL 2025 clash on Saturday.

NEW DELHI: The fans were all set—thunderous roars, cheers, claps, and deafening hoots echoed across the MA Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai. They had gathered in anticipation of seeing their beloved 'Thala', Mahendra Singh Dhoni, walk out for the toss on Saturday. But the excitement quickly turned to disappointment when it was Ruturaj Gaikwad , not Dhoni, who strode out alongside Delhi Capitals skipper Axar Patel.The buzz fizzled out. The crowd, expecting a nostalgic return of Dhoni as stand-in captain, fell silent. Dhoni was widely expected to lead Chennai Super Kings against Delhi Capitals in the absence of Gaikwad, who had suffered an elbow injury during CSK ’s last match against Rajasthan Royals.Gaikwad had taken a blow to his right forearm while charging down the pitch against Tushar Deshpande during the game in Guwahati last Sunday.After being put into the field by Delhi Capitals, Gaikwad said at the toss: ""We were looking to bat as well. Looks a bit dry. It's a bit cloudy, won't change much. You always want momentum in T20 cricket. Overall, the chat has been positive. Fielding is something we can improve day by day. We want to be proactive. Elbow is good. Conway comes in for Overton.

IPL 2025 | Kagiso Rabada: 'Even a No. 10 can hit a six... there's no mystery anymore'

MUMBAI: A major talking point during Mumbai Indians ' 12-run defeat to the Lucknow Super Giants at the Ekana Stadium in Lucknow on Friday night in IPL-2025 was the fact that MI retired out their India batter Tilak Varma in the closing stages of the match. In a decision which has triggered a debate and even a controversy-fans on social media are enraged- the left-hander, who has scored two T20I hundreds, was asked to return to the dugout in the penultimate over of a 204-run chase, after coming on as an 'Impact Player' making 25 off 23 balls.When Tilak left the field, MI needed 24 off seven balls with five wickets in hand. The visitors eventually couldn't cross the line, though.TOI has learnt that the decision, which seems harsh on the face of it on the talented batter, was purely taken as Tilak is suffering from a niggle in a finger.""He has a finger injury in his left hand (bottom hand). That’s why he was called back to the dugout. Due to the injury, he wasn’t able to hit with power. This is exactly the reason why he played as an Impact Player. There are otherwise no doubts in the team over Tilak's hitting ability,"" a reliable source tracking the developments told TOI on Saturday. Tilak replaced wrist spinner Vignesh Puthur when MI batted.Also See: IPL Live Score, DC vs CSK In his post-match press conference, MI head coach Mahela Jayawardene said it had been his decision to retire Tilak out. ""He just wanted to get going but he couldn't. [We] waited till the last few overs, hoping that [he would find his rhythm], because he had spent some time there so he should have been able to get that hit out of the way, but I just felt that at the end, I just needed someone fresh to go, and he was struggling. These things happen in cricket. Not nice to take him out but I had to do that, it was a tactical decision at that point,"" Jayawardene said.When Tilak walked out to bat, MI were on track at 86 for three after 8.1 overs. Tilak put on 66 off 48 balls with Suryakumar Yadav (67 off 43 balls) for the fourth wicket, but while Suryakumar contributed 46 off 30 to the partnership, Tilak struggled for fluency, managing to score just 17 off 18 balls.MI captain Hardik Pandya (28 not out off 16 balls), who took his maiden fiver (5-36) in T20 cricket earlier in the match, was at the other end when they took the decision to retire Tilak.""I think that was obvious. We needed some hits, and he was not [able to get them]. Sometimes in cricket one of those days comes, when you really want to try but it does not happen, but the decision [speaks for] itself, why we did it,"" ,"" Hardik told the broadcasters after the match.",MI coach Mahela Jayawardene said it was his decision to retire Tilak Varma.

He was eventually allowed to return in the 65th over.The viral moment has resurfaced just as Jaiswal announced his departure from Mumbai cricket , requesting a No Objection Certificate (NOC) to play for Goa in the 2025–26 season.In his statement, Jaiswal expressed gratitude toward the Mumbai Cricket Association but cited personal and career-related reasons for his move.His transfer is being seen as a major coup for Goa, with former GCA secretary Rohan Desai hailing it as a turning point for the team.Goa, recently promoted to the Elite division of the Ranji Trophy, will now have a Test-capped opener at the helm, as Jaiswal is expected to lead the side.While Jaiswal’s recent form in the IPL has been underwhelming, his red-ball credentials remain strong.

NEW DELHI: Lucknow Super Giants held their nerve to clinch a thrilling 12-run victory over Mumbai Indians in Match 16 of IPL 2025 at the Ekana Cricket Stadium on Friday.While Mitchell Marsh’s explosive 60 (off 31 balls) and Hardik Pandya ’s five-wicket haul dominated headlines early on, it was young leg-spinner Digvesh Singh Rathi who turned the tide in LSG’s favour with a sensational spell under pressure and notched up the Player of the Match award in the process.Batting first, LSG posted a commanding 203/8, thanks to Marsh’s 60 off 31 balls and late fireworks from David Miller (27 off 14).Hardik Pandya was the pick of the MI bowlers, bagging five wickets, including key dismissals of Nicolas Pooran, Rishabh Pant, David Miller, and Aiden Markram, keeping MI within reach.However, the real story unfolded in the second innings, where Mumbai seemed to be cruising with Suryakumar Yadav in ominous form.At 86/2 in the 9th over, MI looked set to chase the target down. But Digvesh Singh Rathi, playing only his second IPL match, changed the game with a crucial breakthrough. He removed the dangerous Naman Dhir for 46 with a sharp delivery that skidded on and bowled him, derailing MI’s momentum.The spinner's figures of 1/21 were not just economical, but tactically brilliant.Bowling with superb control and guile, he applied pressure in the middle overs, conceding just 11 runs in his final two overs when MI were gearing up for a final assault.His tight spell forced the batters to take risks at the other end, eventually leading to Suryakumar’s dismissal in the 17th over.Even with Hardik Pandya launching a late onslaught, LSG’s total proved just out of reach for MI, who ended at 191/5.Rathi’s composure and fearless approach stood out, marking him as a rising star in LSG’s ranks.This win lifts LSG to sixth on the table and gives their campaign fresh momentum.For MI, questions remain over their middle-order finishing and death bowling.

RAJASTHAN ROLL OVER PUNJAB

Jos Buttler Exclusive Interview: I owe Jayawardene for letting me open in T20

Saturday served up a doubleheader delight for IPL fans. In the opening clash, Delhi Capitals extended their unbeaten streak in IPL 2025 with a 25-run victory over five-time champions Chennai Super Kings at the MA Chidambaram Stadium. Later in the evening, Rajasthan Royals produced a dominant performance, thrashing Punjab Kings by 50 runs at the Maharaja Yadavindra Singh International Cricket Stadium.Delhi Capitals climbed to the top of the IPL 2025 points table with a historic win at Chepauk, their first victory at the venue since 2010. Powered by a classy 77 from KL Rahul, who opened in place of the injured Faf du Plessis, DC posted a competitive 183/6. Chennai Super Kings, despite a valiant unbeaten 69 from Vijay Shankar, managed only 158/5 in response, handing Delhi a 25-run win.DC’s bowlers executed their plans to perfection on a surface that didn’t allow free stroke-play. Vipraj Nigam impressed with figures of 2/27, while the rest of the bowling unit chipped in, barring Mohit Sharma and Axar Patel.Mukesh Kumar gave DC the ideal start, removing Rachin Ravindra with a return catch off a leading edge. Mitchell Starc then trapped Ruturaj Gaikwad with a short ball that was pulled straight to deep square leg. Nigam joined the party by dismissing Devon Conway, and CSK’s powerplay ended at a shaky 46/3.With the pitch slowing down, DC kept Shivam Dube and Shankar in check. Dube eventually fell for 18 to Nigam, and Kuldeep Yadav struck with a googly to trap Ravindra Jadeja leg-before for two. Though Shankar was given a few lifelines—two dropped chances and a missed lbw—he broke a 28-ball boundary drought with a couple of crisp shots, bringing up his fifty off 43 balls.MS Dhoni, playing in front of his family, provided late fireworks with an unbeaten 30 off 26 balls, but the target proved too much as CSK suffered their second consecutive home loss. Yashasvi Jaiswal returned to form in style, scoring a fluent 67 to lead Rajasthan Royals to a commanding 50-run win over Punjab Kings at the Maharaja Yadavindra Singh International Cricket Stadium in Mullanpur.Jaiswal, who had struggled in his first three outings, struck three fours and five sixes in his 45-ball knock, sharing an 89-run opening stand with skipper Sanju Samson (38). Riyan Parag (43* off 25) and Shimron Hetmyer (20) provided the finishing touches as RR posted a daunting 205/4—the first 200-plus total at the venue in six matches.In reply, Punjab never recovered from the double blow inflicted by Jofra Archer in the first over. Archer dismissed Priyansh Arya with the first ball of the innings and sent back captain Shreyas Iyer with the last, finishing with 3/25.Despite a counterattacking 62 off 41 balls from Nehal Wadhera and a brisk 30 from Glenn Maxwell, Punjab’s chase crumbled. The pair added 88 runs before Maheesh Theekshana dismissed Maxwell, and Wanindu Hasaranga struck the next ball to remove Wadhera. Punjab eventually finished on 155/9, suffering their first loss of the season.","Delhi Capitals climb to the top of the IPL 2025 points table with a historic win at Chepauk, their first victory at the venue since 2010.

NEW DELHI: On the second episode of Bombay Sport Exchange , a deep dive into India’s fast-evolving sporting economy took center stage as K Shriniwas Rao, Head of Content (Sports) at Times Internet, sat down with Vinit Karnik, Managing Director - Sports, Content, and Entertainment at GroupM (South Asia).What followed was an insightful conversation on the growth of India's sports ecosystem -- one that has outpaced even gold and the Sensex over the past 18 years.As Indian Premier League IPL ) continues to dominate headlines and capture hearts, Karnik broadened the lens, exploring how India’s sports economy has diversified beyond cricket.""Over the past 18 years, the value of gold in India has grown by approximately 6.2x, while the Sensex has increased around 4.7x,"" Karnik said on the episode. ""In comparison, the sports industry has been growing at a healthy CAGR of about 13%. If we specifically look at the 2023–2024 period, the industry grew by around 7%.""""From a marketing standpoint, it (IPL) just needs to be packaged a bit differently. Because you can't look at an Orange and Purple cap in the same way we are looking at a title sponsor of an IPL or official partner of an IPL or the umpire sponsor,” Karnik noted, highlighting how brands, the league, and platforms are now betting big on a wider range of sports properties.Karnik credited much of this acceleration to structured investments, professional management of franchises, and the increasing appetite of audiences for diverse, fast-paced formats.""If you look at teams like Mumbai Indians, CSK (Chennai Super Kings), RCB (Royal Challengers Bengaluru), look at KKR (Kolkata Knight Riders), I think they've really, really built a brand imagery, which is very, very mature and something which resonates with cricket fans,"" he added.While the IPL remains the crown jewel of Indian sports, commanding viewerships in the hundreds of millions, the emergence of alternative sports - such as running and pickleball - is opening up fresh opportunities for brands and broadcasters alike.","Bombay Sport Exchange EP. 2: GroupM's Vinit Karnik on Indian sports, IPL growth & emerging sports.

Nottingham Forest secured a crucial 1-0 victory over Manchester United at the City Ground on Tuesday, strengthening their Champions League hopes, while Arsenal maintained pressure on league leaders Liverpool with a 2-1 win against Fulham, marked by Bukayo Saka's return from injury and goal.Former Manchester United winger Anthony Elanga scored the decisive goal for Forest just five minutes into the match with a remarkable solo effort, running from his own half before beating Andre Onana with a low shot.Third-placed Forest now hold a 10-point advantage over Newcastle in sixth position, with the top five teams likely to qualify for Champions League due to English clubs' strong European performances this season.Forest, two-time European champions, haven't competed in the Champions League since 1980 when they were title holders.Elanga, who left United in 2023, has found success under Nuno Espirito Santo at Forest.""He's a special boy and he gives this team his speed.

The Brazilians are monumentally hurt. Vinicius Junior has called for a seismic rethinking after returning from an embarrassing trip across the border. A 1-4 loss to Argentina, their bete noire, in the World Cup qualifier rang throughout the football cathedrals of the world, with stark images of the Mineirazo blinking on the stream of consciousness and social media.That had happened on the fateful June evening, the agony in Belo Horizonte, where Brazil suffered a humiliating 7-1 defeat to Germany on their own turf in the 2014 World Cup semifinal. Two unsuccessful World Cup campaigns followed, which took a toll on Tite, Ramon Menezes (caretaker), Fernando Diniz (caretaker). Last week, the sword, as expected, fell on Dorival Junior .Amid such changes, Brazil’s tendency to implode occasionally has been the excruciating constant. It is not the first time in the recent past that Brazil conceded four. Swamped with information that’s mostly unnecessary and used to obfuscate thought and reason, the world forgot that under Menezes in a June 2023 friendly, Sadio Mane’s Senegal pumped as many past Ederson, the Man City goalkeeper. Last week, however, the unfortunate gloveman was Bento.With 18 months to go for the World Cup, Brazil’s suffering against an Argentina that was without Lionel Messi, only strengthens the notion that the Canarinhos will qualify for the World Cup 2026, but nothing beyond. Thankfully with six out of 10 ten teams making it out of the South American group in this time’s inflated 48-team competition, Brazil and its fans don’t have to spend sleepless nights.The question that keeps popping up like unwelcome adverts, though, is, what ails Pele ’s team? Well, as the football romantic Simon Kuper says, “Brazil will always be Pele’s team.” For a while, it was also Ronaldo’s team. Post-Ronaldo, the history of Brazil is a history of struggle against Europe, non-transference of knowledge, and a story of brilliant individuals failing to play as a team.Their World Cup campaigns are a repeat-show of slipping on European banana peels. In 2006, it was Zidane’s France. Four years later in South Africa, it was Wesley Sneijder who rose above the yellow shirts. In their own backyard, Belo Horizonte, Brazil scripted their darkest chapter against Germany. Kevin de Bryune’s Belgium undid Neymar-powered Brazilians in Russia. In Qatar, Luka Modric’s Croatia cut short their run even though hardly any non-Croatian remembers Mislav Orsic the provider or Bruno Petkovic, the one who equalized.It marked Brazil’s fifth elimination in the World Cup against European opposition since a 2-0 victory over Germany in the 2002 final. No wonder Vinicius is left crying after the fresh debacle on the banks of River Plate.“Everyone did badly, we played badly, and Argentina played excellent,” Vinicius said, “We must rethink everything we’ve been doing, because the pressure will come, the people want us to win.“The World Cup is a year away and I’ve already played in a World Cup and I don’t want to lose again. I think we must do a lot of different things and take the good things we’re doing in qualifying to build a squad. Everyone knows how difficult it is to play in this kit, but we must keep our heads up. We’re going to qualify for the World Cup and try to do everything for our country,” he would add.Perhaps, the screams are a little too late in coming. Lest we forget, the country’s Olympic team, the stepping stone to the Selecao, failed to qualify for Paris 2024. Those who could recall another friendly against Spain under Dorival, the lingering image was how Lamine Yamal taught the visitors lessons in dribbling, a skill that was once the domain of the men in yellow.The words of Mario Zagallo, a World Cup winner as both a player and coach, turned out to be prophetic. He warned that the sellout of homegrown talent has led to the erosion of Brazil’s football identity. He was speaking right after Mineirazo; even a decade later — till his death this January — he wasn’t proven wrong.Leaving the shores early for Europe, is almost a Brazilian way of life. One can argue with some truth that they don’t make Pele, Garrincha, a Romario or Ronaldo anymore, just as they don’t make Shakespeare anymore.Raphinha is the key to Barcelona’s current degree of hotness. Players with lesser ability have come together to win football’s highest honour with organization, coaching acumen and a slice of luck. Marquinhos, for his life, will not be able to explain how Petkovic’s shot took that deflection to send Alisson the wrong way in Qatar. Neither could Tite.Dorival Junior is the third coach that the CBF has sacked after Tite resigned following the 2022 exit. Often quick changes in coaching staff are held responsible. Mario Zagallo was appointed just three months prior to the 1970 World Cup. And the team that rediscovered the ‘beautiful game” under Tele Santana in 1982, considered to be the best team not to have won the World Cup, had been under his charge for a full two years.In Brazil, it has always been the triumph of the individual over the collective. Unreasonable it may seem, as we are constantly feeding off European models. No one can explain Branco’s goal from a free-kick against Holland in 1994. Or Oliver Kahn’s spilling of Rivaldo’s stinger with Ronaldo sniffing around.In 2002, Brazil’s humungous qualification struggle had been buried into oblivion. Among four automatic slots, Brazil hadslipped in claiming the third! Reading Brazil, we instantly go back some 75 years when the world empathized with the struggle of the underprivileged. The intermediate changes in the society are overlooked as we lament Brazil’s reversals.Samindra Kunti, author of Brazil 1970, says, “The romantic idea of football is dead and we are forever expecting Brazil to rekindle the dream.”Maybe Brazil have wasted three years of preparation time or who knows, someone like Zagallo will appear to inspire and wipe away Vinicius’s tears.Marcela Mora y Araujo, who specialises in South American football, feels that the debacle against Argentina is just a blip and not a crisis.“Brazil’s qualification road has not always been smooth if we go by the history. They always have an ace up their sleeve.”",Brazil lost 1-4 to Argentina in a World Cup qualifier in Rio de Janeiro. It was the Canarinhos' fifth World Cup defeat against European opposition since 2002 final. Brazil's World Cup campaigns are a repeat-show of slipping on European banana peels.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119844132,imgsize-112734,width-400,resizemode-4/Brazil-X.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Jannik Sinner , the three-time Grand Slam champion , received a three-month ban after testing positive twice for the banned substance clostebol .The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) agreed to the ban after Sinner admitted ""partial responsibility"" for team mistakes.Umberto Ferrara , Sinner's former physical trainer, has spoken publicly about the scandal for the first time. He claims to be blameless and places the responsibility squarely on Sinner's former physiotherapist, Giacomo Naldi .""I was perfectly aware that it was banned so I always kept it safely stashed away in my wash bag. I suggested to Naldi to use it for a cut which had not healed and was affecting his work. I was absolutely clear when I spoke to him about the nature of the product and it was imperative it never came into contact with Jannik. In effect I told him to use it only in my bathroom. Naldi did not deny he had been told, but he said he could not recall,"" he told Gazzetta dello Sport.Ferrara states that he had been using a spray containing clostebol, prescribed by a doctor for an illness, and had kept it safely stored away.He suggested that Naldi use the spray for a cut that was not healing, but explicitly warned him to use it only in Ferrara's bathroom and to ensure it never came into contact with Sinner.According to Ferrara, Naldi did not deny being warned about the nature of the product but claimed he could not recall the instructions.Ferrara alleges that Naldi treated Sinner without gloves and without washing his hands after using the spray, despite the warnings.Ferrara acknowledges that, in hindsight, he would not have handled the situation the same way. He expresses regret over the behavior of others and claims to have suffered due to the ""bad faith of some.""Sinner's suspension ends on May 4, allowing him to return in time for the French Open. The clay-court tournament in Hamburg will be his second tournament after his return, followed by the Italian Open in Rome.","Jannik Sinner received a three-month ban after testing positive twice for the banned substance clostebol.

World number one Aryna Sabalenka secured her first Miami Open title by defeating American Jessica Pegula 7-5 6-2 in the WTA 1000 event final at Hard Rock Stadium on Saturday. This victory marks Sabalenka's second title of 2025, following her Brisbane triumph in January, and her eighth WTA 1000 title overall.Sabalenka, who had recently lost the Indian Wells final to Russian teenager Mirra Andreeva, showed determination not to repeat that outcome in Miami.""I'm super happy to have this trophy, I was able to play my best tennis in the final,"" said Sabalenka, acknowledging Pegula's performance and referencing their previous encounter at the US Open final.The first set was marked by service struggles, featuring seven breaks of serve. Pegula challenged Sabalenka by drawing her to the net, but the momentum shifted when Pegula served at 6-5 down.Sabalenka secured the first set with a combination of a delicate forehand drop and a down-the-line winner.Despite losing her first service game in the second set, Sabalenka quickly regained control. She broke twice to establish a 3-1 lead and maintained her dominance to complete the victory in one hour and 27 minutes.""I think I was able to completely forget about (it being) the final, about the outside things and I was just so focused on the game,"" Sabalenka reflected.The Belarusian has won 12 of her last 14 matches against top 10 players, attributing her success to her performance in crucial moments.""It is all about those key moments of the match, about playing aggressive and staying with the game plan, going for shots without being afraid of losing the point,"" she explained.This marked Pegula's third loss to Sabalenka in a final. The American acknowledged Sabalenka's superiority on hard courts.""I consider myself one of the world's best hard-court players, but she's probably the best,"" Pegula stated after the match.""She just keeps ... raising her level in key moments of the match when she needs to, and I feel like that was the big difference today and the last few times I have played her,"" Pegula added.Despite the loss, Pegula expressed satisfaction with her tournament performance: ""Happy to be in another big 1000 final and having consistent results and keep going deep in tournaments.

So now, every time I am losing (serve) I know that I have weapons, that I can return well and that I can break back,"" she said.""I think that challenge really helped me to be more focused and not get too crazy on court after losing a game on my serve,"" she added.The Miami Open men's final is scheduled for Sunday, featuring Novak Djokovic against Czech teenager Jakub Mensik, with Djokovic pursuing his 100th professional title.","Aryna Sabalenka beats Jessica Pegula 7-5 6-2 in the final of the Miami Open.

Football superstar and Argentina's World Cup-winning captain Lionel Messi was in attendance at the Hard Rock Stadium on Friday, where Novak Djokovic advanced to the Miami Open final with a commanding victory over 14th-seeded Grigor DimitrovIn pursuit of his 100th singles title, and seventh in Miami, Djokovic won 6-2, 6-3 and will face upstart Jakub Mensik, who upset Taylor Fritz 7-6 (7-4), 4-6, 7-6 (7-4) in the other semfinial, for the title.During his post-match court interview, Djokovic recognised that Messi, who currently represents Inter Miami in Major League Soccer, was present, referring to him as ""King Leo.""Djokovic revealed that Messi, accompanied by his wife and children, visited the locker room where they exchanged presents. While Djokovic had previously attended Messi's matches, this marked the first occasion where the football star watched him play.""Obviously, it's a thrill to have his whole family,'' Djokovic said. ""It's a huge honour. He's such a great athlete, not just a football player. His impact on the world of sports in the last 20 years has been immense.""To have him watch me live brings me great joy and excitement and also a little pressure. It's definitely different when he brings his family. I was touched by that.""The 37-year-old Djokovic's performance hasn't been up to his lofty standards, beginning with a withdrawal due to injury at the Australian Open in January. At Indian Wells earlier this month, he suffered a first-round defeat against Botic van de Zandschulp.During the third game, play was halted when security personnel escorted a disruptive spectator from the venue. The chair umpire descended from his position and approached the stands while summoning security staff.Dimitrov engaged in a verbal exchange with the spectator and proceeded to direct the umpire's attention to the location of the troublesome fan at the sideline.""It's just heckling, it's fine,'' Dimitrov said. ""I'm a very calm guy overall. I don't pick any fights but don't trigger me.''Despite Dimitrov securing an early break against Djokovic in the opening game, the Serbian regained composure and secured the first set in 32 minutes.The current men's record holder of 24 Grand Slam titles displayed remarkable serving efficiency, landing 87% of first serves with merely six misses throughout the match. He maintained exceptional control, recording only five unforced errors during the 70-minute contest.""Now I know how it feels to be (John) Isner and (Reilly) Opelka,'' Djokovic said of two serving behemoths. ""Maybe my serve has been a bit underrated.""Djokovic extended his dominant head-to-head record against Dimitrov to 13-1. The Bulgarian player showcased his finest performance during the match.""He wears confidence like a stain on your shirt,'' Dimitrov said. ""It's beautiful to see. Only a few athletes on earth possess that quality.''Mensik, who entered the Miami Open as world number 54, has yet to reach a final in an ATP 1,000-point tournament.In a crucial moment against Fritz, he displayed remarkable composure at 4-4 in the final tiebreaker, securing victory by winning three consecutive points.Throughout the match lasting two hours and 25 minutes, Mensik failed to break serve but managed to win with a brilliant backhand winner down the line at 5-4. Fritz subsequently lost the next two points, sending a forehand long after a 20-shot exchange and netting a forehand on match point.Prior to the match, Mensik had a handshake with Messi. ""I didn't wash my hands before I stepped on the court,"" Mensik said.Tennis inspiration came to Mensik through Djokovic, whom he faced in a three-set match at the Shanghai Masters last October. The age difference between them stands at 18 years.","Novak Djokovic beats Grigor Dimitrov 6-2, 6-3 to reach Miami Open final.

World number one Aryna Sabalenka fought back in the second set to secure her spot in the semi-finals of the Miami Open , defeating China's Zheng Qinwen 6-2, 7-5 on Tuesday.This win marks Sabalenka’s first appearance in the semi-finals in Miami, where she’ll meet Italy's Jasmine Paolini for a chance to reach the final.It seemed like a straightforward match for the Belarusian against the ninth seed Zheng as she easily took the first set. However, Zheng made adjustments and came out strong in the second set, breaking Sabalenka twice to establish a 4-2 lead.Sabalenka faced significant pressure at 0-40 but, after showing some frustration, rallied to hold serve and tie it at 4-4. She then unleashed a powerful finish, breaking Zheng again to lead 6-5 and serving confidently to clinch the match.""Honestly every match is tough against her, I always have to work really hard to get the win and today was an incredible level from both of us,"" said Sabalenka.""I'm super happy to get this win. I'm super happy with the way I handled all the emotions and handled the pressure,"" she added.Meanwhile, Paolini advanced to the semi-finals with a decisive 6-3, 6-2 victory over Poland's Magda Linette . The sixth seed, who reached the finals at Wimbledon and the French Open last year, becomes the first Italian to reach the last four in Miami.Despite a lengthy rain delay, Paolini quickly established control over Linette, who had previously upset Coco Gauff in the quarters. Paolini, aiming for her second WTA 1000 title since winning in Dubai last year, exuded confidence and expressed that she knew her hard work would eventually lead to results.""I think I didn't play bad this season but I just didn't have a great result. But I was there. I lost many matches but to big opponents,"" she said.""It was tough but I was repeating to myself that I was there - maybe I just needed a little more confidence and it came here maybe,"" she said.In Wednesday's quarter-finals, second seed Iga Swiatek will face Alexandra Eala, the teenage wildcard from the Philippines who has already defeated Australian Open champion Madison Keys.Additionally, Britain's Emma Raducanu, who is experiencing her best tournament run since winning the US Open in 2021, will take on American fourth seed Jessica Pegula.","Aryna Sabalenka defeated China's Zheng Qinwen 6-2, 7-5 on Tuesday.

Paolini sinks Osaka

Australia's Alex de Minaur put an end to Brazilian talent Joao Fonseca 's challenge at the Miami Open, outlasting the 18-year-old 5-7, 7-5, 6-3 in an enthralling contest.Attendance on stadium court had been sparse throughout Monday, but the Hard Rock Stadium turned into a mini-Maracana Stadium for Fonseca's match, complete with Brazilian flags and football-style chanting.Fonseca brought his energetic brand of ultra-attacking tennis, but De Minaur was up to the challenge, coping with both the blistering forehands and the partisan crowd.Such was the dominance of Fonseca's raucous support that the referee switched to Portuguese for his appeals for quiet.But de Minaur won six of the final seven games to move into the fourth round, keeping his cool even when the crowd, at times, disrupted his serve preparation.""Mentally I was ready for this match, I knew I was not only going to play an incredible talent like Joao, playing with immense confidence and nothing to lose, but also an incredible crowd that was on his side from the first point until the last,"" de Minaur said.""One of my biggest strengths is my mentality and that is what got me the win today,"" he added.Top seed Alexander Zverev recovered from a slow start to power into the fourth round of the Miami Open with a 7-5, 6-4 win against Australia's Jordan Thompson.The German was 4-1 down in the first set but then went on a roll, winning eight of the next nine games to progress.Zverev lost in the opening round at Indian Wells, but with Carlos Alcaraz already out in Miami he will fancy his chances of adding to his list of seven Masters 1000 titles.Third-seed Taylor Fritz also moved into the fourth round beating Denis Shapovalov of Canada 7-5, 6-3.The American let slip a 5-2 lead in the first set, but regained control with his serve proving too much for Shapovalov.In the women's draw, third-seed Coco Gauff 's bid ended with a 6-4 6-4 loss to Poland's Magda Linette .Top-seeded Aryna Sabalenka eased her way into the last eight with a 6-4, 6-4 win over last year's winner Danielle Collins of the USA.Next, Sabalenka will be up against ninth seeded Olympic gold medallist Zheng Qinwen who reached her second consecutive WTA 1000 quarter-final, with a straight-sets win over Ashlyn Krueger.""I'm super happy to get this win in straight sets and happy with the level I played today,"" said Sabalenka.""She's a tough opponent, and we had a lot of tough and tricky matches in the past. So was very happy to get through this one,"" she added.Italy's Jasmine Paolini enjoyed a 3-6, 6-4, 6-4 comeback win over Naomi Osaka in 2 hours and 15 minutes.Since her comeback from maternity leave 15 months ago, Osaka has been showing some signs of getting back towards her best but Paolini was the first top 10 player Osaka has faced this year.""I don't think that I can say that I've played a lot of matches against top players like this in a while,"" said Osaka.""The way she plays kind of catches me off guard, simply because of her height. I didn't know she could hit like that,"" she added.Emma Raducanu continued her impressive form in Miami, cruising to a 6-1, 6-3 victory in 69 minutes over American Amanda Anisimova, who had eliminated Indian Wells winner Mirra Andreeva on Sunday.It is the first time Raducanu has won four straight WTA Tour main draw matches in a row since her US Open triumph in 2021. She will face American Jessica Pegula next.Raducanu, who has brought in some old faces from the early days of her career for this tournament, said she was benefitting from their presence.""I'm really happy with how things are on and off the court right now and just so happy that's able to transfer on to the match court,"" she said.Alexandra Eala, the 19-year-old from the Philippines who upset Australian Open champion Madison Keys on Sunday, was handed a place in the quarter-finals after her fourth round opponent, Spain's Paula Badosa, pulled out with a lower back injury.In the last eight Eala will face second seed Iga Swiatek who battled past Ukraine's Elina Svitolina 7-6 (7/5) 6-3.","Alex de Minaur beats Joao Fonseca 5-7, 7-5, 6-3 in enthralling contest.

CHENNAI: Sankar Muthusamy recorded the biggest win of his nascent career yet, defeating World No. 2 Anders Antonsen of Denmark 18-21, 21-12, 21-5 in the Swiss Open men’s singles pre-quarterfinals in Basel late on Thursday.What surprised many was the way in which the Indian dominated the deciding game. Despite losing the opener, the 21-year-old did not give up and pushed the match to the decider. He was helped by a flurry of unforced errors that Antonsen committed — the Dane hitting the shuttle wide and long on multiple occasions. Sankar made the most of the opportunity and succeeded.The Chennai lad entered the tournament as a qualifier and registered two wins to enter the main draw.“It feels good, and I have been doing well in this tournament. The first game (against Antonsen) lasted for close to 30 minutes and I feel that he became tired after that. I was able to score points from long rallies and capitalised on the situation. I was focusing on one point at a time and did not think much about the result,” Sankar, ranked 64th, told TOI from Basel.“In the deciding game, I was just expecting him to come back at me and was ready to handle the situation. My aim was to move him around the court and make him tired.”Sankar, who was a former junior World No. 1, lacked consistency in the 2024 season due to various reasons. However, he started the 2025 season on a bright note, reaching the quarterfinals of the Thailand Masters. He was later down with fever and could not give his best in the next few tournaments. However, Sankar recovered well ahead of the Swiss Open.The youngster, who is known for his defensive play, has improved his attacking skills and stroke-making.“My strokes have become sharper than usual, and I am able to finish off points from the rear court. My power is gradually increasing, and I am working on it. There is still a long way to go,” he said.Sankar’s long-time coach Aravindan Samiappan said that the win has come at the right time for his ward.“The moment has not sunk in properly. Sankar was an underdog and had nothing to lose. Our plan was to stay neck-to-neck on points and towards the end anything could have happened. But none would have expected such a scoreline in the decider. It was a bit shocking but that happens sometimes,” Aravindan said.The coach feels that opponents can no longer come prepared for Sankar, as he lends unpredictability into his game now.“Sankar can vary the pace of the match whenever required, and this was not the case one and a half years ago. Players could anticipate what he was going to do, as he played at a single pace. Now, you cannot predict him, and that is the major difference in his gameplay,” pointed out the coach.","Sankar Muthusamy defeated World No. 2 Anders Antonsen of Denmark 18-21, 21-12,. 21-5 in the Swiss Open men’s singles pre-quarterfinals in Basel late on Thursday.

NAGPUR: Malvika Bansod rallied from three points (14-17) down to clinch the first game but as luck would have it the 23-year-old world No.23 missed a chance to save the second match point in the decider to go down fighting against higher ranked Michelle Li of Canada, and bow out of the Swiss Open on Wednesday.Though Malvika suffered an early exit from the BWF World Tour Super 300 tournament, the world No.20 Li escaped to win the opening round contest against the Nagpur shuttler.

A day after dethroning reigning champion Jonatan Christie , Lakshya Sen faltered against Li Shi Feng of China 10-21, 16-21 in the men’s singles quarterfinals of the All England Championships in Birmingham on Friday.Soon after, the Indian challenge ended as the women’s doubles pair of Treesa Jolly and Gayatri Gopichand lost to Chinese second seeds Liu Sheng Shu and Tan Ning 14-21, 10-21.Given his 7-4 win-loss record and having won the last two matches against Li last year, Lakshya was expected to fare well in the quarterfinals. But the Indian was a pale shadow of the shuttler on show against Christie.From 4-4, Li widened the gap. He scored eight points on the trot and Lakshya was out of the first game even before he had warmed up.Emboldened by the easy victory in the first game, Li started on an aggressive note while Lakshya crawled his way back. With good netplay and by pushing the shuttle to the corners with good effect, Lakshya secured a crucial three-point lead (11-8) at the halfway stage. However, Li toned down his aggression and scored the next four points by engaging the Indian in long rallies, mostly close to the net. It was anybody’s game till 15-15.Thereafter, Li came up with two smash winners and a lucky net drop to widen the gap to 19-15.

NEW DELHI: India's Lakshya Sen exited the All England Badminton Championships following a straight-game defeat to Chinese world No. 6 Li Shi Feng in the men's singles quarterfinals on Friday. The 2022 finalist, who narrowly missed an Olympic medal in Paris last year, was outplayed 10-21, 16-21 in a 45-minute encounter.Ranked world No. 15, Sen had won his last two encounters against Li, including at the Thomas Cup. However, this time, he struggled against his familiar Chinese rival from the junior class of 2018.Feng dominated early, wrapping up the first game in just 17 minutes. Playing with composure and avoiding unnecessary risks, he surged to a 9-4 lead with a powerful smash and entered the break with an 11-4 advantage. Sen's unsuccessful review left him trailing 4-12, but a brief resurgence saw him reduce the deficit to 7-12 with a sharp cross-court smash. Yet, Feng quickly adjusted, mixing up his pace and tactics to clinch the game.Sen showed improvement in the second game but couldn't match Feng's consistency. Trailing 2-5 initially, Sen fought back with better net play, taking a 10-8 lead after a grueling 37-shot rally. He maintained a slender three-point lead at the break and fought hard in a tight contest, with a marathon 44-shot exchange tying the score at 14-all. However, Feng's aggression proved decisive as he surged ahead 17-15 with a powerful smash.At 15-18, Sen suffered finger bruises, spilling blood on the court and requiring medical attention, leading to a brief stoppage. However, the break did little to disrupt Feng's momentum as he sealed the match with another thunderous smash.Despite the loss, Sen's campaign was commendable, highlighted by his stunning straight-game victory over defending champion Jonatan Christie, avenging his semifinal defeat to the Indonesian last year.With this win, Feng advances to the semifinals to face the winner between top seed Shi Yu Qi and Singapore's Loh Kean Yew.Meanwhile, India's doubles duo Satwiksairaj Rankireddy and Chirag Shetty withdrew due to injury, Malvika Bansod bowed out in women's singles, and the mixed doubles pair of Rohan Kapoor and Ruthvika Shivani Gadde also fell short.","Lakshya Sen loses 10-21, 16-21 to Chinese world No. 6 Li Shi Feng.

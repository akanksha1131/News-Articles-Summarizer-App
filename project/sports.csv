Poll Who do you think will win the Premier League title this season? Liverpool Arsenal Manchester City Chelsea

The Premier League is back in action on Friday, with champions Liverpool beginning their title defence at Anfield against Bournemouth. Liverpool, Arsenal, Manchester City and Chelsea, who finished in the top four last season once again look like the most viable contenders for the title of league champions.Liverpool, coming on the back of a dominant campaign under Arne Slot, have had a busy summer to say the least. Big-money arrivals Florian Wirtz and Hugo Ekitike are expected to spearhead the attack, while Jeremie Frimpong and Milos Kerkez bolster the full-back positions.Luis Diaz and Darwin Nunez have departed, with Mohamed Salah now surrounded by a very different forward line. The Egyptian's record-breaking season that featured 29 goals and 18 assists will be hard to replicate. But surrounded by younger, more clinical players, his role may evolve. Defensively, they're still on the lookout. Moves for Marc Gu√©hi and Giovanni Leoni are all but finalised.Arsenal, after painstakingly coming close to the title, have addressed depth and injuries by bringing in Martin Zubimendi, Viktor Gyokeres and Noni Madueke. With several important players missing large parts of last season, Mikel Arteta will hope for a fitter, more consistent campaign.With Gyokeres home, Arteta's men will look to banish the demons of last season, where they made several chances, but failed to convert them into goals.Manchester City, despite the disastrous start to their campaign last season, finished 13 points behind Liverpool in third place. They need to answer questions over their defence despite new signings Tijjani Reijnders, Rayan A√Øt-Nouri and Rayan Cherki.With Rodri facing another setback during the FIFA Club World Cup, City will face the exact same problem that hounded them last season - the link that connects their defence to midfield. With Mateo Kovacic and Phil Foden also sidelined for the immediate future, Pep Guardiola has a gargantuan task at hand - to ensure that they don't stumble in similar fashion this time around.Chelsea, like every other summer in recent memory, has been extremely active in the transfer market. Their fourth place finish last season was made better when they schooled Paris Saint-Germain in the Club World Cup final.Their rapid squad overhaul, adding eight major signings including Jo√£o Pedro and Jamie Gittens are positive signs. Cole Palmer‚Äôs sensational year and Mois√©s Caicedo‚Äôs evolving influence in midfield give reason for optimism, yet the constant changes in squad composition may make things difficult.The Londoners lifted the Conference League title last year, but it's high time that they stamp their authority domestically as well. Can they answer the question of success without stability? Only time will tell.While the title may not be their realistic goal, as the new season begins, a bunch of Premier League clubs find themselves in the middle. They're not quite title contenders, but a change in fortune or a headstart may see them compete with the best for European slots. Some are looking for identity, others for a leap forward, and a few for stability.Manchester United have rebuilt their forward line with Benjamin Sesko, Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha after a goal-starved campaign. But their midfield depth remains thin, with Bruno Fernandes, Manuel Ugarte, Kobbie Mainoo and Casemiro the only senior options. This remains the same set of options that they had in a disappointing campaign. Ruben Amorim's time in charge saw them endure their 'worst' season ever as they finished 15th. With Amorim set to begin his first full season, fans can only hope that they start behaving like a big club - something they've found difficult to do in a few years.Newcastle United begin with uncertainty, given that their star striker Alexander Isak‚Äôs future remains in the balance. He scored over a third of their league goals last season, and replacing him mid-window would be a difficult task. Eddie Howe‚Äôs side ended last season in strong form and lifted the EFL Cup. New signing Anthony Elanga adds blistering pace, boasting 36.1 km/h last season, but their attacking set-up may not be clear until the window closes. Isak has been linked to Liverpool and a big-money move to the Saudi Pro League as well.Aston Villa have kept changes minimal, adding striker Evann Guessand from Nice. With Morgan Rogers and Youri Tielemans at their best in the middle of the park, Guessand‚Äôs presence could sharpen the attack if he slots in at his new club. However, the squad is largely the same as last year‚Äôs sixth-place finishers, leaving questions about whether they‚Äôve done enough to push on. Unai Emery will have to make do as his team will also be playing European football for the third season in a row after their sixth place finish last season. While they have a solid team capable of progressing to the knockouts, can they manage to do it without Marcus Rashford and Marco Asensio is the question.Tottenham Hotspur have parted ways with Ange Postecoglou and are banking on Thomas Frank to steer them upwards after a season that saw them barely avoid relegation. Frank has powered up the defence with new centre-backs and Jo√£o Palhinha on loan. Yet with Son Heung-Min gone and James Maddison sidelined, the attack rests on Mohammed Kudus and young prospect Mathys Tel. Can Spurs avoid embarrassment this time around and force a top-half finish? The answer will heavily rest on how well the new boss gets his players to play his game.","Premier League back in action on Friday, with champions Liverpool beginning their title defence at Anfield against Bournemouth.

Poll How do you feel about Gautam Gambhir's impact as India's head coach so far? Very Positive Somewhat Positive Neutral Negative

On Independence Day Gautam Gambhir kept it simple but powerful. Posting a picture with the tricolour, he wrote, ‚ÄúMy country, my identity, my life! Jai Hind!üáÆüá≥‚Äù ‚Äî a message that resonated with fans across India. It was more than a patriotic caption; it was a reflection of a man whose cricketing journey has always been intertwined with the nation‚Äôs pride.Now serving as India‚Äôs head coach, Gambhir carries the same passion he once showed as an opener. His tenure, which began in July 2024, has already been full of highs, lows and intense scrutiny. In Test cricket, results have been mixed. India has played 15 Tests under him, winning five, losing eight and drawing two.The most recent Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy in England was a thrilling battle ‚Äî India lost the first and third Tests, bounced back to win the second and final matches, with a high-scoring draw in Manchester sealing a 2-2 series result. It was a contest filled with tense finishes, resilient comebacks and moments that reminded fans of India‚Äôs fighting spirit.In white-ball cricket, Gambhir‚Äôs impact has been more immediate.India has dominated in T20Is, winning 13 out of 15 games, remaining unbeaten in series. ODIs saw an early stumble with a home series loss to Sri Lanka, but the team rebounded strongly, winning eight consecutive matches and lifting the 2025 Champions Trophy.Gambhir‚Äôs leadership style has sometimes drawn criticism for too much chopping and changing, but he remains steadfast in taking responsibility, famously saying, ‚ÄúWe lose together, we win together.‚Äù For a man who scored 97 in the 2011 World Cup final and 75 in the 2007 T20 World Cup final, that sense of accountability and love for the country is nothing new. His Independence Day post was a reminder that, for him, cricket and patriotism have always gone hand in hand.","Gautam Gambhir's tenure as India's head coach has been full of highs, lows and intense scrutiny.

World number one Jannik Sinner continued his dominant hardcourt run by defeating Felix Auger-Aliassime 6-0, 6-2 in the ATP-WTA Cincinnati Open quarter-finals on Thursday, marking his 25th consecutive hardcourt match victory. The Italian champion, who turns 24 on Saturday, dispatched his opponent in just 71 minutes to secure his eighth straight win at this event and 30th victory of the season.Sinner, competing in his first tournament since winning Wimbledon, will face either French qualifier Terence Atmane or Danish seventh seed Holger Rune in the semifinals.""I felt great on the court today, you could see that,"" Sinner said. ""But every day can be different. Let's see what I can do in the semis.""""I served well today, that was the key for me,"" Sinner added. ""I had a small drop in the second set and I'm happy that I broke back. He moves and serves well, he's difficult to play.""Auger-Aliassime struggled throughout the match, losing the first set in under 30 minutes with three double-faults in the final game. Despite breaking Sinner's serve early in the second set, he ultimately succumbed with his eighth double fault on match point.Fifth-seeded Ben Shelton advanced to the quarter-finals by defeating Jiri Lehecka 6-4, 6-4, securing the victory with back-to-back aces.""I'm hungry, I'm in a good rhythm and the body feels good,"" said Shelton, who will next face third-seeded Alexander Zverev, who has won all three of their previous encounters.In women's action, second-seeded Coco Gauff progressed to the quarter-finals with a 6-2, 6-4 victory over Lucia Bronzetti.""I could have maybe made some more first serves in that second set, but overall, I had a lot of aces and unreturnables,"" said Gauff, the 2023 Cincinnati and US Open champion. ""I'm happy considering where (my serve) was last week. I'm always trying to get better, but also just trying to take the little wins along the way.""""I'm just trying to be happy with where I'm at now, but still doing the things I need to do to improve,"" Gauff added.The American star secured her quarter-final spot by breaking Bronzetti's serve in the final game, as the 61st-ranked Italian hit long after 79 minutes of play.Gauff will face seventh seed Jasmine Paolini, who defeated 2024 Wimbledon champion Barbora Krejcikova 6-1, 6-2. Krejcikova received treatment for a left foot issue during the second set, which visibly affected her movement.""She's a great player and can do anything she wants with the ball,"" Paolini said. ""But I don't think she was at 100% today.""Paolini, who reached both the Roland Garros and Wimbledon finals in 2024, dominated the match by winning seven consecutive games to build a 4-0 lead in the second set. The quarter-final matchup against Gauff will be their second meeting in Cincinnati, with Gauff having won their previous encounter two years ago en route to her title.","World number one Jannik Sinner defeated Felix Auger-Aliassime 6-0, 6-2 in the ATP-WTA Cincinnati Open quarter-finals on Thursday.

Sehwag‚Äôs message for son Ayraveer



NEW DELHI: Former India opener Virender Sehwag has revealed that he came close to retiring from ODI cricket in 2007-08, only to be convinced otherwise by batting legend Sachin Tendulkar Speaking on Padamjeet Sehrawat's podcast, Sehwag recalled the turbulent phase during India's tri-nation series against Australia and Sri Lanka Down Under, when he was dropped from the side by captain MS Dhoni after the first three matches.‚ÄúIn the 2007-08 series against Australia, I played the first three matches and then MS Dhoni dropped me from the side. I wasn't picked for a while after that. Then I felt that if I can't be a part of the playing XI, then there is no point in playing ODI cricket,‚Äù Sehwag said.Frustrated and ready to walk away, Sehwag approached Tendulkar to share his decision.

He said, ‚ÄòNo. I went through a similar phase in 1999-2000, where I felt I should leave cricket. But that phase came and went. You are going through a trough, but it will pass. Don't make any decision when you are emotional.Give yourself some time and 1-2 series, and then take a call.'‚ÄùSehwag took the advice to heart, returned to the side, scored heavily in the following series, and went on to play a crucial role in India's 2011 World Cup-winning campaign.Sehwag went on to play 251 ODIs for India, amassing 8,273 runs at an average of 35.05 and a strike rate of 104.33, including 15 centuries and 38 fifties.The former opener also spoke about his son Aryaveer's budding cricket journey. Selected for Delhi's U-16 Vijay Merchant Trophy squad in December 2023, Aryaveer, Sehwag said, would inevitably face comparisons but should not take on undue pressure.‚ÄúThat pressure will always be on you, but you should not take that pressure. Pressure is something that you give, not take‚Ä¶ Hope he goes on to play either for India or the Ranji Trophy ,‚Äù Sehwag remarked.","Former India opener Virender Sehwag came close to retiring from ODI cricket in 2007-08.

England pacer Chris Woakes has provided a promising update on his recovery from a dislocated shoulder, raising hopes of his participation in the Ashes later this year.The 35-year-old sustained the injury while fielding during the final Test of the Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy against India at The Oval earlier this month.Speaking to Sky Sports on the sidelines of The Hundred, Woakes appeared without an arm sling and said his rehabilitation was progressing better than he initially anticipated.‚ÄúCertainly good news for me. That's the best way to look at it,‚Äù Woakes said. ‚ÄúObviously out of the sling and feel like I can move it a lot better now, which is good two weeks down the line.‚ÄúI suppose once you get a little bit more movement into it, feels a little bit more normal.

NEW DELHI: Former India captain Mithali Raj believes the current women‚Äôs team has what it takes to lift a maiden ICC Women‚Äôs ODI World Cup ‚Äî provided they can seize crucial moments during the tournament, which begins on September 30.India enter the eight-team event among the title favourites, but will have to contend with the experience and dominance of seven-time champions Australia and four-time winners England.‚ÄúI think (India) needs to seize those small moments during the big games. That's where the balance (is) of the teams that are in contention. They try to use more of those moments and try to shift the momentum to their side, and India need to seize those moments,‚Äù Mithali told ICC Digital on Thursday.Mithali, who captained India to runners-up finishes in 2005 and 2017, said winning the trophy at home would be a massive boost for women‚Äôs cricket in the country. ‚ÄúI mean, that is something that all the players, whoever picks up the bat, whoever wants to represent the country, would want to win the World Cup because so far India hasn't.‚ÄúYes, we've come close twice, but we haven't got our hands on the Cup. It would be great to win a World Cup at home because that's a very different stage altogether...and giving all of us an opportunity to see that,‚Äù she added.While the spotlight will naturally be on captain Harmanpreet Kaur Jemimah Rodrigues , Deepti Sharma, and Smriti Mandhana, Mithali believes a breakthrough performance from young pacer Kranti Goud could prove decisive. Goud, who emerged as one of the standout talents in WPL 2025, impressed during India‚Äôs ODI and T20I series wins in England and has played four ODIs so far.‚ÄúI was quite impressed with Kranti Goud in England with her raw talent. She has played WPL (Women's Premier League), but she does not really have that much experience. But the grit that she gets as a seamer trying to keep pegging in and getting wickets (is impressive), and she picked up a six-wicket haul (in England) as well, so I would love to see her in the World Cup playing at home,‚Äù Mithali said.","Former India captain Mithali Raj believes the current women's team has what it takes to lift a maiden ICC Women's ODI World Cup.

Poll What do you think is the main reason for Pakistan's poor performance in ODIs? Lack of quality players. Poor coaching strategies. Inexperienced team.

Former fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar has questioned the appointment of Mike Hesson as the new head coach of the Pakistan cricket team after they were bowled out for a paltry 92 in the third ODI against West Indies.‚ÄúMike Hesson is a good T20 coach, but I don‚Äôt know what qualities he has for ODIs.

Fresh from playing a pivotal role in RCB‚Äôs historic IPL 2025 triumph, the 35-year-old opened up on how his conversations with the star batter have shifted from playful banter to family matters.Speaking on the podcast Talk with Manvendra, Bhuvneshwar revealed that the bond between him and Kohli has matured with time.‚ÄúThings are different now. When we meet these days, we talk more about family or off-the-ground matters because everyone has a family now. We talk about how we are doing in life other than cricket. Earlier, when we weren‚Äôt married and were younger, it was more about the usual fun and jokes boys have. So that‚Äôs where the change has come,‚Äù Bhuvneshwar said.On the field, however, he insisted professionalism remains the driving force. ‚ÄúWe never really need that bond to perform well. If RCB has picked me, Virat, or any other player, they want us to perform regardless of friendship. Everyone knows what they have to do on the ground. But off the ground, of course, things have changed. We‚Äôve matured, we‚Äôve grown older, so now the conversations are different,‚Äù he added.Bhuvneshwar enjoyed a strong season, taking 17 wickets in 14 matches, while Kohli amassed 657 runs in 15 innings. The pacer also lauded Rajat Patidar ‚Äôs leadership during RCB‚Äôs title-winning run.‚ÄúThe best part was that since it was such an experienced team, Rajat didn‚Äôt have to do much. Where leadership was needed, he took decisions without hesitation. That‚Äôs a quality ‚Äî knowing when to step in and when to let things be,‚Äù Bhuvneshwar said.He credited RCB‚Äôs balanced contributions for breaking their 18-year title drought. ‚ÄúThis time, the biggest difference was that all players in the XI won matches at different times, in different situations.

Pakistan Shaheens opener Mohammad Nafay and Yasir Khan had a heated conversation in the middle of the pitch during their match against Bangladesh A at the TIO Stadium in Darwin, Australia.After 11 overs, Pakistan were cruising at 110 for no loss and both the openers were scoring at the brisk rate.In the first ball of the 12th over, there was a big mix-up as Nafay wanted to hoick Chowdhury out of the ground and failed to get any connection. Yasir Khan went off from the non-striker end and at one stage both the openers were at the same end, before Yasir decided to rush back, but he was too late as by then the Bangladeshi wicketkeeper had pounced the ball and threw it to the bowler, who dismantled the bails.A furious Yasir threw his bat on the pitch with frustration and hurled abuses to his opponent, before making a slow walk back to the pavilion.Pakistan Shaheens made a flying start to their Top End T20 Series campaign, defeating Bangladesh ‚ÄòA‚Äô by 79 runs in Darwin on Thursday evening.After electing to bat first at the TIO Stadium, the Shaheens piled up a commanding 227 for four in 20 overs. Openers Khawaja Mohammad Nafay (61 off 31 balls, 8 fours, 2 sixes) and Yasir Khan (62 off 40, 7 fours, 2 sixes) set the tone with a blistering 118-run partnership in just 11.1 overs.Abdul Samad then provided late fireworks with an unbeaten 56 off 27 deliveries, smashing five sixes, while skipper Muhammad Irfan Khan chipped in with 25 off 12 to push the total past the 200 mark.Bangladesh ‚ÄòA‚Äô began brightly in their chase, reaching 92 for one inside seven overs. However, left-arm spinner Maaz Sadaqat broke the momentum by removing Jishan Alam (33) in the eighth over. The Shaheens‚Äô spinners then took charge, with Faisal Akram (3-19) and Saad Masood (3-30) running through the middle order.

Former England captain Wayne Rooney has hit back at NFL legend Tom Brady over remarks made in a behind-the-scenes documentary about Birmingham City.Brady, who became a minority owner of the English club in 2023, was featured in the docuseries Built in Birmingham. In one clip that circulated widely online, the seven-time Super Bowl winner said he was ‚Äúa little worried about our head coach's work ethic,‚Äù referring to Rooney, who lasted just 83 days in charge before being dismissed as the team struggled in the Championship.Speaking to BBC, Rooney called the comment ‚Äúvery unfair‚Äù and suggested Brady‚Äôs view was based on limited exposure. ‚ÄúTom came in once, which was the day before a game, which is a little bit lighter anyway,‚Äù Rooney said. ‚ÄúAnd I don't think he really understood football that well at the time. Maybe he does now.‚ÄùRooney stressed the difference between the two sports, adding: ‚ÄúWhat he does understand is that he's a hard worker. We know that. So that's why I'm really disappointed with the comment, because football is not NFL. NFL works for three months in a year, players do need rest as well, so I think he was very unfair in the way he's come out and portrayed that.‚ÄùBirmingham were relegated at the end of that season but bounced straight back up the following year, returning to the Championship, which is one tier below the Premier League.Despite his frustration, Rooney was keen to underline his respect for Brady. ‚ÄúListen, I respect Tom Brady massively ‚Äî he's one of the greatest, if not the greatest athlete of all time,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAnd Birmingham do look like they are getting it right now, which is good.‚Äù",Wayne Rooney hits back at Tom Brady over comments made in documentary.

Poll Will Xabi Alonso's tactical flexibility improve Real Madrid's performance this season? Yes, definitely! No, it won't make a difference.

Real Madrid are set to begin the new season under new boss Xabi Alonso, aiming to leave behind the disappointing end to the Carlo Ancelotti era. The former midfielder, who took charge after Ancelotti‚Äôs departure, is targeting a more ambitious brand of football while reshaping the squad.Alonso‚Äôs early tests came at the Club World Cup in the United States, where Madrid suffered a heavy 4-0 defeat to Paris Saint-Germain in the semi-finals. ‚ÄúThings are going to be different... we are starting from scratch,‚Äù said Alonso, admitting the performance exposed areas needing improvement.The Basque tactician demonstrated tactical flexibility during the tournament, alternating between a four-man and three-man defence, which was in contrast to Ancelotti‚Äôs preference for a fixed backline. ‚ÄúWe need and want everyone to defend ‚Äî the 11 players on the pitch have to be involved defensively,‚Äù Alonso explained, stressing the importance of pressing from star attackers like Vinicius Junior and Kylian Mbappe Finding the right balance between attack and defence remains a priority, especially after Mbappe‚Äôs 43 goals last season failed to deliver major silverware. The Frenchman missed much of the Club World Cup group stage with illness, returning only for the defeat to PSG. ‚ÄúWe have to be self-critical, but it will also serve us as a guide for where we need to improve,‚Äù Alonso noted.This season marks Madrid‚Äôs first without Luka Modric in over a decade. Turkish midfielder Arda Guler is tipped to take on a more central role, especially with Jude Bellingham sidelined until mid-October after shoulder surgery. New signings Trent Alexander-Arnold, Dean Huijsen, Alvaro Carreras and Franco Mastantuono bolster the squad, alongside the return of Dani Carvajal from a long-term knee injury.Alonso, who promises to bring ‚Äúemotion and energy‚Äù to Madrid‚Äôs style, wants to restore focus on the club‚Äôs football and not off-field controversies in the months ahead.",Real Madrid kick off their La Liga campaign on August 19 against Osasuna.

Poll Who do you think was the standout player for PSG in the match against Tottenham? Lee Kang-in Goncalo Ramos Nuno Mendes Lucas Chevalier

Paris Saint-Germain secured their fifth trophy of 2025 by defeating Tottenham 4-3 in a penalty shootout at the UEFA Super Cup in Udine, Italy on Wednesday. PSG mounted a remarkable comeback, scoring two late goals to force penalties before clinching victory in the annual match between Champions League and Europa League winners.The match seemed to be going Tottenham's way when they established a 2-0 lead early in the second half through goals from their defenders. Micky van de Ven opened the scoring in the 39th minute, capitalizing after PSG's new goalkeeper Lucas Chevalier tipped Joao Palhinha's shot onto the crossbar.Newly appointed Tottenham captain Cristian Romero doubled the lead in the 48th minute with a header that Chevalier failed to save. Chevalier was playing in place of Gianluigi Donnarumma , who had announced his departure from PSG the day before.PSG, despite being less prepared due to their recent Club World Cup involvement until mid-July, showed remarkable resilience in the closing stages. Lee Kang-in brought them back into the game with a powerful low shot from the edge of the area in the 85th minute.Goncalo Ramos then forced the match into penalties with a dramatic equalizer, heading home Ousmane Dembele's cross in the fourth minute of stoppage time.In the penalty shootout, PSG overcame an early miss by Vitinha to convert their next four attempts.Tottenham's Van de Ven and Mathys Tel failed to score, ultimately leading to Nuno Mendes securing victory with the decisive penalty.The match marked Thomas Frank's first competitive game as Tottenham manager, having replaced Ange Postecoglou in the offseason. Postecoglou had led Spurs to their first trophy in 17 years with a Europa League final victory over Manchester United in May.The Super Cup victory adds to PSG's impressive trophy haul, following their Champions League-Ligue 1-Coupe de France treble last season and the Trophee des Champions victory in January. Their only setback came in the Club World Cup final loss to Chelsea.Tottenham appeared sharper throughout much of the match, benefiting from more extensive preseason preparation compared to PSG's players, who had only recently returned to training following their Club World Cup commitments.","Paris Saint-Germain defeated Tottenham 4-3 in a penalty shootout at the UEFA Super Cup in Udine, Italy on Wednesday.

Days after Oliver Rowland lifted his Formula E World Championship trophy in London this season, an interesting trend has come to the attention of Formula E and its fans. As a coincidence, all Formula E drivers who won the Mexico City E-Prix went on to win the Formula E World Championship that season, and this has been proved right for three consecutive years.Highlighting the same since 2023, a poster of three World Champions was shared on X by Formula E with the caption, ‚ÄúThe trend continues.

Finishing P4 in the Drivers‚Äô Championship and coming into the final weekend with a shot at runner-up is something to be proud of.‚ÄùAlso adding a note for teammate Sam Bird, as NEOM McLaren withdrew from Formula E after the end of the season, Barnard wrote, ‚Äú@sambird_official it wasn‚Äôt the weekend you deserved either.You‚Äôve been a huge part of my season both on and off the track, and I‚Äôm grateful for everything. You deserved more. To all the Papaya fans, thank you for the incredible support in our final race together.

How do Formula E and ABB work together?

What do ABB and Formula E say about the partnership?

After a successful Season 11, ABB and Formula E have announced that they will continue their partnership in the upcoming season. This gives ABB another opportunity to promote its new brand positioning via the ABB FIA Formula E World Championship, along with technologies that help industries take a cleaner route.Over a period of eight seasons, the partnership with Formula E has provided ABB a platform to showcase how technology can help industries outrun challenges, engage with customers around the world, and implement its own solutions into the series to improve reliability and efficiency. The partnership extension will provide a year-round opportunity for brand-building and activation, communicating ABB and its technology solutions to new global audiences, including Formula E‚Äôs international fanbase.ABB and Formula E will also join hands to engage a new generation of fans, collaborating with unexpected influencers and content creators to tell compelling stories that make advanced electrification and automation technologies tangible and exciting.The end of the mid-race car swap, a 150kW increase in power, top speeds that are 43 percent higher, and energy recovery increasing from 15 to 50 percent indicate how far Formula E technology has come to outperform on track.ABB has also built on its technical involvement in the series, supplying the race chargers from Season 9, and introducing its ABB Ability OPTIMAX¬Æ energy management software (Season 9) and Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) technology (Season 5) to the sport.ABB Head of Brand Paco Liebrand said, ‚ÄúWe are pleased to be continuing our partnership with Formula E which, like ABB, is striving for a leaner and cleaner future. The synergy between the two organizations, combined with the global appeal of the Championship, makes it a great platform to promote our brand positioning.‚ÄùHe further said, ‚ÄúFormula E is increasingly working with content creators, influencers, and celebrities, with initiatives such as the Evo Sessions making an impact through digital channels beyond the racing itself, which is also an essential part of ABB‚Äôs new brand strategy. Going forward, we will be enhancing the way we harness the benefits of this collaboration, ensuring the focus is on delivering content and activations that reinforce our new messaging, build familiarity, and tell the ‚ÄòEngineered to Outrun‚Äô story. ‚ÄùFormula E Chief Revenue Officer Tiziana Di Gioia said, ‚ÄúOur renewed partnership with ABB is a testament to the commercial power and benefit of Formula E as a global platform that drives both brand and business growth. ABB, like our wider partnership portfolio, has and continues to see enormous value in collaborating with the fastest-growing motorsport on the planet, with viewership, commercial integration, and brand storytelling continuing to accelerate. Over eight seasons, ABB has moved from brand visibility to brand activation‚Äîintegrating deeply into the fan experience, the sport‚Äôs ecosystem, and our innovation narrative.Also Read: Antonio Felix Da Costa shares happy memories as Porsche wins Formula E Teams and Manufacturers‚Äô World Championships ‚ÄúThis next chapter elevates the partnership even further.

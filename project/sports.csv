NEW DELHI: Marizanne Kapp etched her name in cricketing folklore on Wednesday, producing a record-shattering performance to propel South Africa into their first-ever ICC World Cup final — across men’s or women’s cricket. The veteran all-rounder delivered a spell for the ages as the Proteas thrashed England by 125 runs in the Women’s World Cup semi-final at Guwahati’s Barsapara Stadium.The 35-year-old was at her ruthless best, dismantling the four-time champions with a fiery opening burst. Kapp dismissed two English batters in her very first over before finishing with sensational figures of 5 for 20 in seven overs, including the prized scalps of Heather Knight, Nat Sciver-Brunt, and Amy Jones. England were bowled out for 194 while chasing 319, collapsing under relentless pressure from Kapp and her teammates.With this feat, Kapp surpassed Indian legend Jhulan Goswami ’s record of 43 wickets to become the leading wicket-taker in Women’s World Cup history — her 44th coming fittingly in a knockout clash that defined South Africa’s sporting history. She also became only the third player ever to claim a five-wicket haul in a World Cup knockout, joining Anya Shrubsole and Sophie Ecclestone.Remarkably, Kapp is now the first player to take two five-wicket hauls against the same opponent in World Cup history, having earlier dismantled England in 2022 with 5 for 45 at Mount Maunganui.Earlier in the day, captain Laura Wolvaardt blazed 169 off 143 balls, guiding South Africa to a commanding 319 for 7. Supported by Tazmin Brits (45) and Kapp (42), her innings laid the perfect platform for the bowlers to dominate.England’s chase never recovered from Kapp’s early double blow despite Sciver-Brunt (64) and Alice Capsey (50) fighting back briefly.As Wolvaardt lifted her arms in triumph, Kapp stood tall — rewriting records and leading South Africa to their first-ever ODI World Cup final.",South Africa beat England by 125 runs in Women's World Cup semi-final.

Poll Is Liverpool's season salvageable after the recent defeats? Yes, they can turn it around No, it's too late Maybe, depends on next few games

Liverpool’s season went from bad to worse on Wednesday night as they crashed out of the League Cup following a stunning 3-0 defeat to Crystal Palace at Anfield — their sixth loss in the last seven matches across all competitions.Ismaila Sarr struck twice before halftime and Yeremy Pino added a late third, as Palace inflicted yet another humiliation on Arne Slot’s struggling side. The defeat compounds Liverpool’s growing crisis, coming just days after their 3-2 Premier League loss to Brentford, which further derailed their title defence.Slot’s decision to rest several key players — including Mohamed Salah, Virgil van Dijk, Alexander Isak and Florian Wirtz — backfired spectacularly. With one eye on crucial fixtures against Aston Villa, Real Madrid and Manchester City, the Dutchman fielded a largely second-string team featuring teenagers Kieran Morrison, Rio Ngumoha and Trey Nyoni.“It’s not Liverpool standards to lose six out of seven,” Slot admitted after the match. “But with the squad we have — maybe 15, 16 fit first-team players — this was the choice I had to make. The schedule is brutal, and next week will be even tougher.”The weakened lineup struggled to keep up with Palace’s intensity. Joe Gomez’s defensive lapse allowed Sarr to open the scoring in the 41st minute, before the Senegalese winger doubled the lead just moments before halftime from Pino’s assist. Substitute Amara Nallo’s late red card only deepened Liverpool’s woes, and Pino’s composed finish in the 88th minute sealed the emphatic win.The result means Palace have now beaten Liverpool three times in 80 days — following their Community Shield shootout win and a 2-1 Premier League victory.Liverpool’s latest defeat leaves Slot under increasing pressure as the club’s season threatens to unravel. With top players out of form, mounting injuries, and growing fan frustration, the next two weeks — featuring clashes against Villa, Madrid and City — could define the fate of his debut campaign.Meanwhile, Manchester City, Arsenal, Chelsea and Newcastle all advanced to the quarter-finals after securing wins in their respective ties.","Liverpool crashed out of the League Cup following a 3-0 defeat to Crystal Palace.

What is Bronco Test? Will Rohit Sharma and Mohammed Shami be able to clear it? An expert explains!

NEW DELHI: Senior pacer Mohammed Shami on Tuesday reaffirmed his readiness for an India comeback, declaring that his “hard work is paying off” after a stunning performance for Bengal in the Ranji Trophy . The veteran fast bowler, who has been sidelined from national duties following ankle surgery, delivered a fiery spell to lead Bengal to a 141-run win over Gujarat at the Eden Gardens — a result that has reignited calls for his recall to the national side.“Grateful for the rhythm and hard work paying off. Always proud to represent my team,” Shami wrote on X, sharing photos from the match and the game ball — a subtle yet powerful message to critics and selectors alike.The 35-year-old pacer was at his vintage best, taking 5 for 38 in Gujarat’s second innings and finishing with eight wickets in the match. His figures marked his 13th five-wicket haul in first-class cricket and cemented his position among the top three wicket-takers in this Ranji season, with 15 wickets at 10.46 from just four innings.Speaking after the game, Shami said his motivation was simple: to stay fit and perform. “Every person wants to play for the country. So, I am ready for that again. My job is to stay fit and keep performing; the rest is in the selectors’ hands,” he said.The Eden Gardens win was particularly special — Bengal’s first Ranji victory over Gujarat since 2003 — and Shami’s devastating burst on the final day turned the match decisively.“It’s a relief, mentally and physically. Coming back after such a difficult time and still performing well shows that there’s plenty of cricket left in me,” he said.Shami, who was not selected for India’s recent white-ball tour of Australia, had been at the centre of a public spat with chief selector Ajit Agarkar over his fitness status. Agarkar claimed Shami wasn’t match-ready; the pacer responded sharply that updating selectors on fitness wasn’t his responsibility. His recent spell, however, seems to have done all the talking.Bengal head coach Laxmi Ratan Shukla hailed Shami’s effort, saying, “Mohammed Shami doesn’t need a certificate from anyone. His bowling is the certificate. He’s completely fit and in top rhythm.”","Mohammed Shami has been sidelined from national duties following ankle surgery.

Shreyas Iyer’s condition critical after suffering life-threatening injury in Sydney | Inside details

India cricketer Shreyas Iyer is now stable after a frightening on-field injury during the third ODI against Australia in Sydney on Saturday that led to internal bleeding and emergency ICU care.The 30-year-old suffered a spleen laceration while diving forward to catch Alex Carey. What first appeared to be a rib injury turned serious soon after, as Iyer’s body vitals dropped sharply in the dressing room, prompting an immediate rush to Sydney’s St Vincent’s Hospital. Doctors later confirmed he had sustained a blunt abdominal impact causing a ruptured spleen and internal bleeding.The BCCI , in a statement on Tuesday, confirmed the diagnosis: “The injury was promptly identified, and the bleeding was immediately arrested. His condition is now stable, and he continues to be under observation. A repeat scan on October 28 has shown significant improvement. The BCCI Medical Team, in consultation with specialists in Sydney and India, will continue to monitor his progress.”Iyer’s condition was initially life-threatening, with sources revealing that his blood pressure had dropped to “alarmingly low levels” before doctors acted swiftly to control the bleeding.He was shifted to the ICU and underwent a non-surgical medical procedure to stop the hemorrhage.BCCI secretary Devajit Saikia told TOI that Iyer’s recovery has been faster than expected.“Shreyas is much, much better. His recovery has been much faster than what doctors anticipated. He didn’t undergo surgery but a different procedure. He’s stable, out of ICU, walking, and eating normally now,” Saikia confirmed.The BCCI is also arranging for Iyer’s sister Shresta Iyer to travel to Sydney to be by his side. The board’s medical representative, Dr. Rizwan Khan, continues to oversee his treatment.Providing an update from Canberra, India’s T20I captain Suryakumar Yadav said: “We spoke to him the first day we found out. He’s been replying to messages and talking normally, which means he’s doing fine. The doctors there are taking good care of him.”Medical experts describe a spleen laceration as a delicate and potentially fatal injury, as the spleen is one of the most vascular organs in the body. Internal bleeding can be severe, making rapid diagnosis and control crucial.Iyer, who scored 496 runs in 11 ODIs this year, is expected to remain under observation for at least a week and could miss India’s upcoming South Africa ODI series starting November 30.For now, though, cricket fans can exhale — Shreyas Iyer’s vitals are stable, the bleeding has been controlled, and his recovery in Sydney is progressing well.",India cricketer Shreyas Iyer is now stable after a frightening on-field injury.

Pratika Rawal Father Interview: On daughter's hundred, the World Cup dream and more

GUWAHATI: Opening their Women’s World Cup with a 10-wicket loss to the same opponents at the same venue four weeks ago, South Africa brought out their A game this time to beat England by 125 runs in the first semifinal here at Barsapara Cricket Stadium on Wednesday to make the final.The thumping win was highlighted by skipper Laura Wolvaardt ’s maiden World Cup century and Marizanne Kapp ’s allround performance. While Wolvaardt scored 169 off 143 balls to set a daunting 320-run target for England, Kapp first scored 42 off 33 balls and then took 5/20 in 7 overs to dismiss the four-time champions for 194. Captain Nat Sciver-Brunt and Alice Capsey joined hands to put up some resistance but that wasn’t enough as England made heavy weather of an already difficult chase. Kapp set the tone of South Africa’s defence, opening with a double-wicket maiden over. She castled openers Amy Jones and Heather Knight, in the first over. Ayabonga Khaka sent back opener Tammy Beumont with her first ball in the second over. England were gasping at 1/3, their chase in tatters.It was a perfect start for the Proteas to book their maiden final berth in ODI World Cup. However, Sciver-Brunt and Capsey combined for a crucial 107-run partnership to stoke England’s hopes.But with Capsey’s departure to spinner Sune Luus in the 23rd over, South Africa clawed back in the game.Kapp then returned for her second spell to dismiss Sciver-Brunt and virtually put England out of the contest. In her seventh over. She was on a hat-trick dismissing Sophia Dunkley and Charlie Dean with consecutive balls. Sophie Ecclestone denied Kapp the feat, but it was already a starry night for the Proteas all-rounder.

In a magnificent knock of 169 off 143 balls, the captain hit 20 fours and four maximums.

Poll Who was the standout player in the Women's ODI World Cup semifinal between South Africa and England? Captain Laura Wolvaardt Marizanne Kapp

Captain Laura Wolvaardt produced a masterclass with the bat before Marizanne Kapp delivered a superb five-wicket haul as South Africa outplayed England by 125 runs to storm into their first-ever Women’s ODI World Cup final on Wednesday.Wolvaardt’s magnificent 169 off 143 balls anchored South Africa’s total of 319/7, setting England a record chase in the semifinal. Despite a fighting stand in the middle, the four-time champions were bowled out for 194 in 42.3 overs, with Kapp doing the bulk of the damage.“It still feels a bit unreal. You dream as a kid of scoring a hundred in a World Cup knock-out game,” Wolvaardt said after receiving the Player of the Match award. “This probably has to be right at the top considering the context, a World Cup semi-final. It is right up there,” she added.After being put in to bat, South Africa got a solid start through Wolvaardt and Tazmin Brits (45), who shared a 116-run stand for the opening wicket. Sophie Ecclestone led England’s fightback with figures of 4 for 44, twice halting South Africa’s momentum.However, Wolvaardt found able support in Marizanne Kapp (42) as the pair rebuilt with a 72-run partnership.From 202 for six, Wolvaardt’s calculated acceleration — mixing elegant drives with powerful strokes through midwicket — lifted South Africa past the 300-run mark. Her knock included 20 fours and four sixes, bringing up her 150 with a six over midwicket and also taking her past 5000 ODI runs.Late cameos from Chloe Tryon (33*) and Nadine de Klerk (11*) added 117 runs in the final ten overs, ensuring a strong finish for the Proteas.Chasing 320, England’s reply faltered early as Kapp struck twice in her opening spell, dismissing Amy Jones and Heather Knight to set the tone. Though Nat Sciver-Brunt (64) and Alice Capsey (50) stitched together a 107-run stand, Kapp returned to remove Sciver-Brunt, effectively ending England’s resistance.Kapp finished with 5 for 20, sealing a memorable win for South Africa — a performance that also erased memories of their league-stage collapse against the same opposition.Additionally, this is also South Africa's first World Cup final appearance across genders, making the win all the more historic.The second semifinal between India and Australia will be played on Thursday in Navi Mumbai.","South Africa beat England by 125 runs to reach their first-ever ODI World Cup final.

Navi Mumbai:

Pratika Rawal Father Interview: On daughter's hundred, the World Cup dream and more

Having somehow managed to stay alive in the tournament and make it to the semifinals with a mix of luck and pluck, hosts India, cheered on by a partisan capacity crowd of almost 55,000, will hope to pull off a miracle against mighty Australia in a blockbuster 2025 Women's ODI World Cup semifinal at the DY Patil Stadium on Thursday.There is some concern about rain affecting the big game — the IMD predicts “a partly cloudy sky with one or two spells of rain or thundershowers,” though a washout is unlikely.The record book heavily favours Australia, who have won 49 of 60 WODIs against India, including three in World Cups. However, India famously beat them in the 2017 semifinal at Derby, thanks to an inspirational knock by Harmanpreet Kaur . Australia haven’t lost a World Cup knockout since.If anyone can recreate that kind of innings, it’s vice-captain Smriti Mandhana . She is just four runs short of 1,000 runs against Australia in WODIs and has been in the form of her life. Before the World Cup, she smashed back-to-back centuries in a home series — a 77-ball ton at Chandigarh and a 50-ball century at Delhi. Picking up after a slow start, Mandhana is the tournament’s top run-getter with 365 runs in seven matches at 60.83, including one century and two fifties.India, though, will be hampered by the injury to her young opening partner Pratika Rawal, who has scored 308 runs in six matches at 51.33. Their prolific partnership of 1,799 runs in 23 innings at 78.21, including a record 212-run stand against New Zealand at this venue, will be missed. Mandhana will now open with Shafali Verma, who is explosive but inconsistent.India might consider bringing back left-arm spinner Radha Yadav , who took 3 for 30 and effected a direct-hit run out against Bangladesh. So far, the management has stuck with Sneh Rana, who went for 0-85 against Australia earlier in the tournament.India will hope captain Harmanpreet Kaur, who has managed just 151 runs in seven matches at 25.16, can find form. Jemimah Rodrigues’ unbeaten 76 off 55 against New Zealand was a huge boost, while Deepti Sharma (15 wickets at 22.46 and 133 runs at 26.60) remains key.There’s a minor concern over wicketkeeper-batter Richa Ghosh, who trained on Tuesday but rested on match eve.On a likely batting-friendly surface, India may prefer to bat first and post a big total against a not-too-threatening Australian attack, even though they lost after scoring 330 in the league stage at Vizag.Beating Australia, however, will be no easy task. The seven-time champions blew away South Africa for 97 in their last match, riding on Alana King’s 7 for 18. Having taken 13 wickets in six matches at 12.92, she poses a major threat with her wrist spin.Australia’s camp is watching captain Alyssa Healy’s fitness closely after a calf injury. “She trained well yesterday. We’ll give her as much time as she needs before the game,” said head coach Shelly Nitschke. Healy’s young opening partner, Phoebe Litchfield (503 runs in eight WODIs at 63.50 against India), also loves facing India.Australia stayed unbeaten in the league stage, but as Nitschke said, “Semifinals are anyone's game. It's a pretty level playing field. The team that holds its nerve under pressure will come out on top.”","India take on Australia in the 2025 Women's ODI World Cup semifinal.

India had reached 97/1 in 9.4 overs, with Suryakumar unbeaten on 39 off 24 balls, while Shubman Gill was not out on 37 off 20.Speaking on Star Sports, Chopra said Suryakumar’s game awareness allows him to manipulate field settings and bowlers’ strategies. “When the runs come in that area, the story becomes easy. To be fair, the kind of pitch this was or the Australian pitches will be, this shot becomes more productive. He has to hit one shot, and then the bowler goes off plan, that where should he bowl next, that he has to do something else, and then you walk into a trap where Suryakumar Yadav hits you a lot,” Chopra observed.Suryakumar’s knock included three fours and two sixes, including one off Josh Hazlewood early in his innings and another against Nathan Ellis shortly before rain stopped play for the final time.The Indian skipper also reached a personal milestone, becoming the fastest batter to 150 sixes in T20 Internationals, achieving the feat in just 86 innings.Chopra highlighted the India captain’s rare ability to generate power despite taking risks with his unorthodox technique. “The power he generates while taking the bat upwards from below is a rare skill. He has an incredible quality. You are praiseworthy if you can consistently score runs despite playing risky shots, and that's why he has reigned in the T20 format for a long time,” he said.The cricketer-turned-commentator also noted that the innings came at a timely moment for Suryakumar after a lean run. “He needed to score runs. You are the captain of a winning team and you have a lot of experience and pedigree as well, so there weren't any question marks as such, but there are murmurs at times. When you go to the ground with a bat in hand, you are a batter first and a captain later,” Chopra said.He added that Suryakumar’s fluent knock would help his leadership going forward. “It was important for the captain to be seen in his Surya avatar,” Chopra remarked.",Former India cricketer Aakash Chopra praised captain Suryakumar Yadav for his calculated approach in the first T20I against Australia.

COMEBACKS & GAME TIME

There couldn’t have been busier times in Indian cricket. Apart from the Women’s World Cup and the men’s series in Australia, at least two dozen matches are being played across age and gender categories on the domestic circuit. Add to it the South Africa ‘A’ tour — a prelude to the India-South Africa series later this month — comprising two Test matches, three One-Dayers, and five T20 matches, and it’s a calendar of abundance.But it isn’t all good. While the India ‘A’ vs South Africa ‘A’ four-day matches, which begin here at the BCCI Centre of Excellence on Thursday, provide a platform for players returning from injuries and those looking for some red-ball game time, the others have very little to gain, especially given the timing.After the two Test matches against South Africa — for which most players would pick themselves — India’s next red-ball engagement is a two-Test away series against Sri Lanka in August next year.But the ‘A’ series games mean several Ranji Trophy teams have been deprived of key players for two to three matches. In some cases, it has taken the sheen off state teams. If it were simply a question of game time, the players in need of it could have played in the ongoing Ranji Trophy.And for those who don’t make the playing XI for the ‘A’ series, it’s just a downright waste of time.The Indian side in both ‘A’ games will be led by Rishabh Pant , who returns from a three-month injury layoff that kept him out of the recently concluded home series against the West Indies.Pant, who broke his foot during the fourth Test against England in June, has spent a lot of time at the rehabilitation facility at the CoE. These matches are crucial for him, and the 28-year-old will look to get runs and game time under his belt at a venue that is batting-friendly and against a bowling attack which, on paper, is largely short on experience.The other Indian Test hopefuls who will be seen in action in the first match are Devdutt Padikkal and N Jagadeesan, along with top-order batter Sai Sudharsan, who has been named Pant's deputy. For the second match, to be held at the same venue from November 6, KL Rahul, Mohammed Siraj, Akash Deep, Prasidh Krishna , and Dhruv Jurel will join the squad.Sudharsan, speaking on the ‘A’ tour fixtures, said, “It is an opportunity as always. India ‘A’ matches are very important, and we are lucky to have them just before the main series. We will take this as a big opportunity to understand the conditions and will plan accordingly.”The visitors will be led by batter Marques Ackerman, while Test skipper Temba Bavuma, who has been out due to a calf injury, is expected to join the squad for the second fixture.",Rishabh Pant to lead India A against South Africa A in four-day match.

Poll How do you rate Sai Sudharsan's performance in the recent Test match against West Indies? Outstanding Good Average Needs Improvement

Since making his Ranji Trophy debut in the 2022-23 season, Tamil Nadu's Sai Sudharsan showcased class and craft across formats. There was no element of surprise when the bespectacled southpaw was handed the Indian Test camp in England. With an average of 21 in four Test matches, the top-order batter was under the pump ahead of the second and last Test against West Indies in New Delhi earlier this month. He came up with a morale-boosting 87 in the first innings and 37 in the second innings of the match.On Thursday, the eve of the first tour game against South Africa 'A', the 24-year-old revealed that head coach Gautam Gambhir 's pep talk before the match calmed his nerves.""The support was impeccable,"" he said of the team management backing during the home series.""Ahead of the Delhi Test match, after practice at the Feroz Shah Kotla nets, I was the last one to leave. GG sir (Gambhir) called me and said, 'You are not getting desperate, you are here because of many reasons. You are one of the best players in the country. So, do not think about any of the other things. Don't think that you have to score runs in this game, or what will happen if you don't,' revealed Sudharsan, who had a fine run in the tour games against Australia 'A' ahead of the West Indies series.His confidence got a booster shot when Gambhir confirmed his place in the line-up, ""He told me, 'you will play'. The way he told gave me so much confidence and freedom. I was trying to be freer and not think about external factors. But when you hear it from the head coach, the perspective and environment change drastically.""Sudharsan believes the runs were an offshoot of the conversation.

Poll What do you think about Shafali Verma's sudden recall to the squad? She is a perfect fit for the team. It's risky to change the lineup.

: It’s not easy to be in Shafali Verma’s shoes right now.Captaining Haryana in the Senior National Women’s T20 tournament at Surat, the young opener, who has been out of the India’s WODI team for exactly an year now - she last played in this format for India against New Zealand on October 29, 2024 at Ahmedabad suddenly learnt that she had to report to Navi Mumbai for India’s 2025 WODI World Cup semifinal against a formidable side like Australia at the DY Patil Stadium on Thursday due to an ankle injury that ruled Pratika Rawal from the tournament.Replacing an in-form player is never easy, but going by the actions and words of the 21-year-old, the young gun is ready for the challenge.On Tuesday, Shafali slogged it out during India’s training session under lights at the DY Patil Stadium on Tuesday. On Wednesday, in the pre-semifinal presser, she said that she felt that it was indeed divine intervention which would see her getting pitchforked into the India playing eleven in such a big game despite not even being a part of the reserves list.Rawal sustained a hairline fracture on her ankle while she fell awkwardly while fielding in the last group league game against Bangladesh.“What happened with Pratika, as a sportsperson, it wasn't a good thing. No one wants any sportsperson to sustain such an injury. But God has sent me here to do something good,” Shafali said philosophically.Luckily for India, Shafali is in good form. The young gun is currently the top-run getter in the ongoing Senior Women’s T20 League, having made 341 runs at a strike rate of 182.35 for Haryana.Her scores have been 55* vs Odisha (in the last match), 39 vs Hyderabad, 42 vs Andhra, 15 vs Karnataka, 107 vs Himachal, 13 vs Chhattisgarh & 70 against Tripura.Before this tournament, she had a good outing for India A in their recent tour to Australia.Verma, who made her ODI debut for India on June 27, 2021, against England, in Bristol, doesn’t boast of a great WODI record. In 29 ODIs, she has scored 644 runs at 23.00, including four fifties in ODIs and has a highest score of 71 not out. Her opening partnership with vice-captain Smriti Mandhana has yielded 893 runs in 25 innings at 37.20 - numbers which look pale in comparison to the fruitful pairing of Mandhana with Rawal.“I was playing domestic (cricket) and I was in a very good touch and talking about the semifinals, it's not like it's something new for me because I have played in the semifinals before. It depends on how I keep myself clear mentally and keep giving myself confidence. I have played in semifinals before,” she said.A regular in the T20Is for India, where she enjoys a strike-rate of 131 and has played 90 games, Shafali comes with a tag of ‘risky’ associated with her due to her tendency of going bang bang from ball one, which can be counterproductive at times.“I was playing T20s but as a batter, it's not that easy to switch. But we had a practice session today as well as yesterday. I tried to stay calm while batting. I tried to play good balls along the ground and those that were in my range, I tried to hit them well. I have had long batting sessions in the last two days, today and tomorrow and I felt great knowing I did all that I was trying to do,” the opener said.Having been around the international cricket circuit for a while now, Shafali knows what Australia bring to the table. “I have played against Australia a lot of times and it’s not the case where I would assess first and then react. I know how their bowlers bowl. I have to back my strengths (because) absolutely they will come hard at us and we have prepared well for it,” she said.Picked for the Women-in-Blue for this campaign out of the blue, Shafali revealed that she was welcomed into the India camp with open arms by all.“All the players I have spoken to, coach, captain and even Smriti di, they all said that I have to play my game. There is nothing to panic about and when I am getting this kind of freedom, I will try to respect the good balls and I will obviously hit those who are in my length (hitting range),” she said.","Shafali Verma will replace Pratika Rawal in India's ODI squad.

FIFA officially launched the second phase of ticket sales for the 2026 World Cup on Monday, putting another 1 million tickets up for grabs. This new phase marks the opening of a global ticket draw, which will run until 11 a.m. Eastern Time on Friday.A key feature of this round is the domestic exclusivity window for residents of the three host nations — the United States, Canada, and Mexico. During this period, local fans whose entries are selected in the draw will have the first chance to buy single-match tickets for games held in their respective countries.According to Heimo Schirgi, FIFA’s Chief Operating Officer for the tournament, interest in tickets has already been “massive” both globally and within the host nations. “This second phase, with its host country domestic exclusivity time slot, will allow us to say thank you to these local fans, while ensuring global opportunity as well,” Schirgi said.Fans from the three host nations can enter the draw until Friday. Winners will be randomly selected and granted a specific time slot between November 12 and 15 to make their ticket purchases. Notifications will be sent out at least 48 hours in advance.So far, residents of the U.S., Canada, and Mexico have led ticket purchases, followed by fans from England, Germany, Brazil, Spain, Colombia, Argentina, and France. After the domestic phase ends, more slots will open globally from November 17, with further sales rounds to follow.Over 1 million tickets have already been sold, with fans from 212 countries purchasing seats. Twenty-eight of the 48 teams have qualified so far.Despite the buzz, logistical questions remain, especially around visa requirements for international visitors amid stricter U.S. immigration rules. Earlier this month, an Argentina friendly featuring Lionel Messi had to be shifted from Chicago to Fort Lauderdale due to slow ticket sales, which some linked to visa concerns.The 2026 World Cup, set across 16 venues in North America, will feature 104 matches and an estimated 7.1 million available seats. While FIFA hasn’t disclosed how many will be released to the public, base ticket prices started at $60 for select games, with premium seats — such as those for the U.S. opening match in Inglewood — priced between $560 and $2,735.In a first for the World Cup, FIFA will use, meaning ticket costs could rise or fall based on demand — a move that might push prices even higher on resale markets, where some listings have already crossed $60,000.","FIFA officially launched the second phase of ticket sales for the 2026 World Cup on Monday.

Kerala Sports Minister V Abdurahiman displayed aggressive behaviour towards media personnel during a school ground inauguration event in Erumapetty, Thrissur, on October 27, 2025. The minister knocked over channel microphones when reporters attempted to question him about allegations of suspicious dealings related to bringing the Argentina football team to Kerala.The confrontation came shortly after MP Hibi Eden held a press conference raising concerns about potential irregularities in the arrangements made for the Argentina football team’s proposed visit to the state. The allegations prompted media representatives to seek the minister’s clarification during the school event.When journalists approached Minister Abdurahiman with questions about the controversy, he reacted by physically knocking over the microphones placed before him. The situation quickly escalated, with the minister’s team reportedly pushing against some journalists during the commotion that followed.Former minister A. C. Moideen, who was present at the venue, stepped in to defuse the situation, urging media personnel not to “create a scene” as the minister entered the school premises.The incident has since drawn sharp attention to the broader controversy surrounding the proposed visit of the Argentina football team — reportedly featuring global icon Lionel Messi — to Kerala.

Arsenal stretched their Premier League lead to four points on Sunday thanks to Eberechi Eze’s decisive strike against his former club Crystal Palace, while Manchester City’s title hopes took a blow with a 1-0 loss at Aston Villa.Eze, who joined Arsenal in a £60 million ($80 million) move in August, netted his first Premier League goal for the Gunners with a stunning volley from Declan Rice’s free-kick six minutes before half-time. Palace failed to clear the delivery, allowing the England international to fire in the match-winner. The victory keeps Arsenal’s defence solid, marking their 10th clean sheet in 13 games across all competitions this season.Manager Mikel Arteta , however, will be concerned as Rice and William Saliba were both forced off in the second half due to injuries. Despite not hitting top gear going forward, Arsenal’s mix of defensive resilience and set-piece efficiency has proved enough to maintain their grip at the top. The Gunners now lead fourth-placed City by six points and have a seven-point cushion over sixth-placed Liverpool.Manchester City’s loss at Villa Park ended Erling Haaland’s 12-game Premier League scoring streak.Matty Cash’s spectacular strike from outside the box in the 19th minute secured a third consecutive season win for Aston Villa at home and pushed Unai Emery’s side into seventh place. Haaland had a late goal ruled out for offside, and with no other City player scoring in the league for over a month, Guardiola’s side was left frustrated.Elsewhere, Bournemouth climbed to second after beating Nottingham Forest 2-0. Marcus Tavernier opened the scoring directly from a corner, with Eli Junior Kroupi adding a second to continue his prolific run. Forest remain in the bottom three despite Sean Dyche’s managerial start in Europe.At the foot of the table, Wolves remain in the relegation zone after Burnley claimed a dramatic 3-2 win at Molineux. Zian Flemming’s brace had put Burnley ahead before Wolves fought back, but Lyle Foster’s stoppage-time winner ensured Burnley pulled five points clear of danger, leaving Wolves six points adrift.Sunday’s results have left Arsenal in an enviable position atop the Premier League, while City, Liverpool, and other challengers face mounting pressure as the title race intensifies.",Arsenal beat Crystal Palace 1-0 to extend their lead at the top to four points.

Isiah Pacheco’s siblings : Travoise, Ricky, Felicia and Celeste



Isiah Pacheco keeps his siblings’ legacy alive



Since joining the Kansas City Chiefs in 2022, Isiah Pacheco has become one of the NFL ’s most inspiring young players. The running back won Super Bowls in each of his first two seasons and even scored a touchdown in his debut. Yet, behind the bright lights and roaring crowds lies a story filled with pain, love, and resilience. While celebrating his second championship in 2024, Pacheco’s thoughts were with his late siblings — a bond that continues to shape his journey.Isiah is the youngest of five children — Travoise Cannon, Ricky Fowler, Felicia Cannon, and Celeste Cannon. Raised in Bridgeton, New Jersey, before moving to Vineland, Pacheco’s childhood was marked by close family ties and playful sibling rivalry. His mother, Felicia “Jody” Cannon, fondly remembers young Isiah pestering his older siblings, especially Celeste, until they gave in to his requests.Felicia, named after her mother, shares a special bond with her family. The matriarch goes by “Jody,” and Isiah carries that love proudly. “My necklace says ‘Jody,’” he once shared during an NFL interview. “It’s my mom’s nickname. Her real name’s Felicia, but we call her Jody.You know that’s my heart.”Both Felicia and Ricky lead private lives, but Isiah often speaks about the powerful influence of his late siblings, Travoise and Celeste, who died tragically within a year of each other. “Football played a part in me and my oldest brother’s relationship. He wanted to be that big brother that always stood at the games and cheer me on,” Isiah said.When Travoise was killed in 2016, the loss left a deep scar. “It was hurting me because I didn’t have that same guidance when I would hear him scream my name at the football field,” he recalled. Still, he played on, turning pain into motivation. “Having an opportunity to play ball, it helps me a lot, not worrying about the tragedies that happened. It makes me want to go harder.”A year later, tragedy struck again when Celeste was murdered in 2017. “My sister was like my best friend,” Isiah told The Press of Atlantic City. Despite the heartbreak, he honored her memory on the field — rushing for 222 yards and a touchdown just days after her death. “I knew that she was looking down on me and took my game to another level because I had something to play for,” he said.Today, Pacheco channels his grief into purpose. He’s a loving uncle to Celeste’s children — Tazjae, Tazirah Kamora, and Donald III — and finds joy in their laughter. “My nephew, we’re trying to introduce him to football … but it’s sad thinking that my sister could be holding him right now,” he said.Through every touchdown dance, every championship, and every smile, Isiah Pacheco carries his siblings’ memory with him — proof that love, no matter how painful, can fuel greatness.Also Read: Inside Eagles’ surprising Michael Carter II trade: How it changes their defense and salary structure","Kansas City Chiefs running back Isiah Pacheco is the youngest of five children.

“Just being cruel”: Benedict Polizzi faces backlash after mocking Mark Sanchez’s stabbing with controversial Halloween costume,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/just-being-cruel-benedict-polizzi-faces-backlash-after-mocking-mark-sanchezs-stabbing-with-controversial-halloween-costume/articleshow/124924688.cms,"Comedian Benedict Polizzi sparked controversy by dressing as a stabbed Mark Sanchez for Halloween, mocking the former quarterback's recent near-fatal stabbing incident. Polizzi's costume, featuring fake blood and a torn jersey, was widely criticized as insensitive. Meanwhile, Sanchez himself responded with grace, mourning the loss of his former teammate Nick Mangold.

The comedian’s Halloween costume crosses a serious line



Mark Sanchez responds with grace amid personal and professional turmoil



Comedian Benedict Polizzi, known for his sharp humor and social media fame, has landed in hot water after dressing up as a stabbed version of former NFL quarterback Mark Sanchez for Halloween. What Polizzi intended as edgy comedy quickly turned into a full-blown controversy, with many calling the costume “insensitive” and “cruel.”Benedict Polizzi, who gained national attention through FBoy Island and his 3.7 million TikTok followers, posted a photo wearing a blood-stained New York Jets jersey, Sanchez’s former number 6, complete with shoulder pads, black eye paint, and fake blood smeared across his torso. The costume appeared to mock Sanchez’s real-life stabbing incident earlier this month in Indianapolis, where the former quarterback was hospitalized after being attacked near his rib cage during an altercation with a delivery truck driver.Doctors reportedly performed emergency surgery to save Sanchez’s life, and he remained under observation for a week. The incident left him and 69-year-old Perry Tole seriously injured.Sanchez has since pleaded not guilty to multiple charges, including felony battery resulting in serious bodily injury, and is expected to stand trial in mid-December.Polizzi’s decision to parody the event drew immediate backlash. In the caption of his post, he wrote that he would “pin the meanest comment to the top,” a remark fans found dismissive and tone-deaf. One viewer wrote, “There’s satire, and then there’s just being cruel,” capturing the general sentiment that Polizzi’s humor had crossed an ethical line.While the internet debated Polizzi’s tasteless joke, Sanchez broke his silence for a far more emotional reason, paying tribute to his late friend and former New York Jets teammate, Nick Mangold. The 41-year-old center recently passed away due to kidney complications.“We lost a good man today,” Sanchez wrote on X. “He was my big brother who introduced me to the NFL. He showed me the ropes. He was my friend and confidant.”As Polizzi faces backlash for exploiting a near-fatal tragedy for attention, Sanchez’s response showed the opposite—grace, humility, and empathy in a moment where others might have lashed out. His dignity amid chaos only highlights the stark difference between using pain for jokes and using it to show strength.Also Read: “Raise your kids right”: Kylie Kelce draws a clear line for Cowboys fans planning to trick-or-treat at her residence","Comedian Benedict Polizzi sparked controversy by dressing as a stabbed Mark Sanchez for Halloween.

Indiana Pacers fail to register a win despite Pascal Siakam’s high score

Dallas Mavericks register their second regular-season win

The Indiana Pacers faced their 4th consecutive loss against the Dallas Mavericks. Pascal Siakam’s highest score in the game could not turn the tables in the Pacers’ favor. He was even assisted by Jarrace Walker, who racked up another decent double-digit score. Despite this, the Pacers failed to register a win in the regular season until now. The team currently stands with a 0-4 loss.The Indiana Pacers started well with a lead in the first quarter. Towards the end of the quarter, the Pacers were taking a 5-point lead over the Dallas Mavericks. By the end of the game, Pascal Siakam racked up 27 points with 13 rebounds and 3 assists. Jarrace Walker and RayJ Dennis followed up with Siakam racking up 20 and 17 points, respectively. To add to it, Anthony Davis exited the game after adding 4 points with 4 rebounds to the team's final score. This happened during the first quarter itself. The player had entered the court with a bilateral Achilles tendinopathy, and during a dunk, the player landed on his left leg. This aggravated the injury, and Davis returned to the locker room. This might have just turned the tables in favor of the Pacers with Siakam’s highest score in the game. However, the Mavericks caught up in the second half and secured another win for themselves.It was the higher number of double-digit scores on the part of the Mavericks that favored the team in its victory. Brandon Williams led the team along with Dwight Powell, Cooper Flagg, Max Christie and D’Angello Russell. Brandom scored the team’s highest, racking up 20 points with 7 rebounds and 2 assists. It was the third quarter that saw the most dunks from the Mavericks. This cleared the gap for the team and also helped them secure a lead over the Pacers. Even though the Pacers scored more in the 4th quarter, they could not close in on the lead set by the Mavericks in the third quarter. The final score of the game stood at 107-105, favoring the Mavericks.After losing two back-to-back games, the Dallas Mavericks registered their first win of the season against the Toronto Raptors. However, the team faced a defeat right in the next game against the Oklahoma City Thunder. The Thunder team took a 7-point lead over the Mavericks in that game. While the Mavericks’ 5th game also started with a trail behind the Indiana Pacers, the Brandon Williams-led team quickly caught up with the deficit and registered a second win for themselves. The Mavericks will face the Detroit Pistons next on November 1.

Is Lionel Messi a fan of Stephen Curry? Football legend praises Warriors star



Lionel Messi’s continued excellence highlights his admiration for Stephen Curry



Golden State Warriors fans got a special treat recently as football icon Lionel Messi expressed his admiration for NBA superstar Stephen Curry. The team wasted no time to celebrate the moment with fans as the official social media shared the popular picture of Messi holding the Warriors’ No. 30 jersey with a beaming smile. Messi, currently starring for Inter Miami CF in Major League Soccer, called Curry one of the all-time greats across sports, joining a list of legendary athletes he respects.During an interview with NBC News’ Tom Llamas, Lionel Messi reflected on athletes who inspire him beyond football. He said, “From basketball, LeBron and Steph [Curry], they’re players I’ve admired a lot and I think they’ve read the game deeply and each of them elevates their sport in their own way.”Messi, who led Argentina to the 2022 World Cup title and recently captured the MLS Golden Boot with 29 goals this season, has long admired athletes who push their respective sports forward.He also highlighted Michael Jordan, fellow Argentine Diego Maradona, and tennis icons Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, and Novak Djokovic. “Competing for so long to be the best and being so close to each other made everything much more incredible,” Messi explained.The connection between Curry and Messi goes beyond mutual admiration. After Curry won his first NBA title and unanimous MVP in 2015, Messi publicly thanked him on social media after receiving a signed No. 30 jersey, celebrating Curry’s impact and achievements alongside his own.Curry has reciprocated the respect, telling Mundo Deportivo, “Messi? Greatness inspires greatness in many different ways. There’s nothing specific you can apply from football to basketball. But it’s the longevity, the creativity, his impact on sports and on the world.”At 38 years old, Messi continues to dominate in MLS, leading Inter Miami CF into the playoffs as the top seed in the Eastern Conference. His ability to maintain elite performance late in his career draws natural parallels to Curry, who remains a transformative force in basketball at 37, and LeBron James at 40.The Warriors’ social media also celebrated the moment, posting photos of Messi holding Curry’s jersey while smiling widely. Messi’s admiration underscores the universal language of sports excellence and the mutual respect that connects legends across disciplines.Also Read: ""He called me crying"": Stephen Curry's wife Ayesha Curry opens up about a heartbreaking moment in their lives amid her recent controversial remarks","Lionel Messi has expressed his admiration for NBA superstar Stephen Curry.

He shared how personal difficulties, including the death of Davis's mother due to cancer in 2019, inspired his son's resolve.Earlier that year, after discovering that Davis's MLB debut jersey would be included in the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame, ""Davis reached his dream. As parents, we, and his sisters, couldn't be prouder."" These statements, given in pre-World Series contexts, underscore the deep family bond that amplified the joy of Game 5.The reaction video blew up fast, racking up thousands of views and shares on X in just minutes. It was a touching reminder of the human side of baseball's biggest moments, transforming a simple family outing into a collective celebration seen by millions.Thanks to Schneider's amazing performance, the Blue Jays kicked off the first inning with a strong aggressive vibe. Guerrero then hit a massive homer to right-center, making it 2-0 and quieting the Dodger fans. In the fourth inning, Toronto scored again, bringing the score to 3-1, while the Dodgers managed to get one run from a single by Freddie Freeman.After his big swing, Schneider settled in and went 1-for-3 with a walk, showing the patience that characterizes his style. If they win, Toronto will take a 3-2 series lead as they head back to Rogers Centre for Game 6. In the later innings, the Blue Jays stayed strong, with their bullpen supported by closer Jordan Romano.Also Read: Can Shohei Ohtani repeat his Opal Chrome success with another record-breaking Topps Now card following his World Series performance?","Toronto Blue Jays' Davis Schneider hit a home run against the Los Angeles Dodgers in Game 5 of the World Series.

Is LeBron James alright? JJ Redick gives clarity on the Lakers star’s recovery timeline



Luka Doncic and LeBron James’ near return offers the Lakers renewed hope



The Los Angeles Lakers could soon welcome back two of their biggest stars. Head coach JJ Redick shared a much-anticipated update on LeBron James and Luka Doncic before Wednesday’s matchup against the Minnesota Timberwolves, revealing the team’s optimistic timeline for their return. Redick said James, who has been sidelined with sciatica, is expected back in the second or third week of November, while Doncic could rejoin the lineup “in the next couple of games. ”James has not played a single game this season as he continues to recover from nerve irritation in his lower back, an issue that first surfaced in early August. The 40-year-old veteran was initially ruled out for three to four weeks, but Redick’s latest comments suggest a slightly longer recovery window. Still, the team remains encouraged by his progress.“JJ Redick says there is no set return date in mind for LeBron James, but the team is eyeing the second or third week of November as the general range,” ESPN’s Dave McMenamin reported.If that timetable holds, James would miss at least the first ten games of the season, including a grueling five-game road trip that ends on November 18 against the Utah Jazz.James’ absence has not gone unnoticed. Beyond his leadership and scoring, the Lakers have missed his steady playmaking presence.His return could mark a turning point for a roster still finding its identity under Redick, especially with several rotation players — including Marcus Smart, Maxi Kleber, and Gabe Vincent — also sidelined.While James’ recovery remains a top concern, Luka Doncic’s situation appears more promising. Redick noted that Doncic’s sprained finger and leg contusion have improved significantly, saying the 26-year-old star could suit up “in the next couple of games.” Doncic didn’t travel with the team for its two-game road swing, but optimism is building that he’ll return soon after.Doncic opened the 2025–26 season on fire, averaging 46 points, 11.5 rebounds, and 8.5 assists in his first two outings before being forced to rest. Even with both stars sidelined, the Lakers have managed a 2–2 start thanks to Austin Reaves, who erupted for 51 points against Sacramento and 41 versus Portland.Also Read: Anthony Davis injury update: Dallas Mavericks face major concern as star forward exits after awkward fall","Lakers coach JJ Redick shared an update on LeBron James and Luka Doncic.

Is Anthony Davis alright? Dallas Mavericks star leaves game after awkward fall



Anthony Davis’ stats before injury



Dallas Mavericks star Anthony Davis left Wednesday night’s game against the Indiana Pacers after an awkward landing, sparking fresh injury concerns for a team already struggling early this season. The 32-year-old forward exited late in the first quarter after appearing to tweak his lower leg on a jumpshot, with the Mavericks later announcing he was questionable to return due to left lower leg soreness.Midway through the first quarter, Anthony Davis went up for a shot over Indiana Pacers center Tony Bradley. Though the play looked harmless at first glance, Davis began limping moments later as he made his way up the court.AD soon crouched near the scorer’s table, visibly uncomfortable, and asked out of the game. ESPN’s Tim MacMahon noted on X , “Anthony Davis just came up gingerly after scoring and asked out. Crouched down on the sideline during the timeout.”Moments later, Davis headed straight to the locker room accompanied by the Dallas Mavericks’ medical staff for evaluation. The team later confirmed that the issue stemmed from left lower leg soreness, a concern compounded by Davis’ pre-existing condition — bilateral Achilles tendinopathy — that had already placed him on the injury report as “probable” before tipoff.The injury couldn’t have come at a worse time for Dallas. The Mavericks entered Wednesday’s contest with a 1–3 record and were already missing star guard Kyrie Irving, who remains sidelined with a knee injury expected to keep him out until 2026. If Davis misses extended time, Dallas may be forced to rely on Dwight Powell, Naji Marshall, and Caleb Martin to absorb his minutes in the frontcourt.Davis has been a consistent bright spot in what’s been a rocky start to the season for Dallas. Davis scored 4 points and 4 rebounds in 7 minutes of play before Wednesday’s exit. He was averaging 25.0 points, 11.8 rebounds, and 2.8 assists per game while shooting over 52% from the field in his first full season with the Mavericks.His defensive presence and leadership have been crucial as the team transitions toward the Cooper Flagg era, following his blockbuster trade for Luka Doncic last February.The 10-time All-Star and 2020 NBA champion has battled numerous injuries throughout his career, and the sight of him limping off once again undoubtedly raised concern among Mavericks fans. The team awaits further evaluation results.Also Read: Is Trae Young alright?

Drake pulls up courtside and shares a moment with Kevin Durant during the Toronto Raptors vs Houston Rockets match,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/drake-pulls-up-courtside-and-shares-a-moment-with-kevin-durant-during-the-toronto-raptors-vs-houston-rockets-match/articleshow/124928482.cms,"(Image Source - Getty Images)

Kevin Durant and Drake share a light moment courtside during a heated Rockets vs Raptors matchup

Drake and Kevin Durant’s friendship grew stronger since their early NBA

The Rockets vs Raptors game had its standout moment long before the final buzzer sounded. When Kevin Durant turned to glance at Drake, who was courtside, the atmosphere in the arena shifted. It wasn’t about competition or tension, just two influential figures recognizing one another. Fans picked up on it immediately, and the video spread across the internet in minutes. For a few seconds, basketball and celebrity culture merged in the most organic manner.With the game heating up, Durant found himself at the free-throw line. Sitting just a few feet away in his iconic courtside seat was Drake, the Toronto native and dedicated Raptors fan. They locked eyes, exchanged a few words, and broke into big smiles, a short but significant break in the heat of NBA action.This interaction was totally unscripted and real; just a natural moment between friends. The video showed Durant leaning in a little while Drake was gesturing excitedly, both clearly enjoying themselves even with the rivalry on the court.In the end, the Rockets pulled off a 108-91 win, improving their record to 2-2 for the season and sending the Raptors down to 1-3.Durant played well, contributing 22 points, 7 rebounds, and 5 assists, which helped Houston keep the energy going from their recent 137-109 victory over the Brooklyn Nets, where he had 19 points and 6 rebounds with a shooting percentage of 42.9%.The bond between Drake and Durant goes way back, created in the intersecting realms of hip-hop, basketball, and a strong mutual respect. People really started to notice their connection during the 2018-19 season when Durant, who was with the Golden State Warriors at the time, kept bumping into the Raptors as they headed to the NBA Finals.A standout moment happened on January 13, 2018, during an exciting game where the Warriors narrowly defeated Toronto 127-125. After the game, reporters were curious about Durant's thoughts on Drake's lively behavior courtside and the vibe he adds to the Raptors' home games. With a cheeky grin, Durant playfully teased his buddy, addressing the gathered media, ""Don't give Drake that much credit.”He later added, “Do not give him that much credit. He's not the reason why it was fun out there. He does bring a different element to the game, someone that's so close to the organization and the city. Everybody realizes it when you play here in Toronto. It was a fun game. The crowd is always amazing here. It was a solid turnout and I'm glad we got the W."".The 2019 NBA Finals brought their story into the spotlight. As the Warriors went head-to-head with the Raptors in a challenging seven-game series (which Toronto clinched for their first championship), Drake's sideline remarks about Durant made headlines.From memes to moments when he was mic'd up, the rapper's playful trash talk added some spice, but Durant took it all in stride, later mentioning that this kind of fan energy is what makes playing in Toronto so special.Fast-forward to 2024, and their loyalty was evident during Drake's notable feud with Kendrick Lamar. As Lamar's diss track ""Not Like Us"" ruled the airwaves, Durant remained staunchly supportive of Drake.On April 15, 2024, he made his support known by posting the cover of Drake's Certified Lover Boy album on Instagram Stories, a subtle yet clear gesture of solidarity amidst the chaos of the rap battle.Their time spent off the court helps maintain their friendship as well. Just last month, in September 2025, Durant and ex-WNBA star Liz Cambage were seen together at a Drake concert in Toronto.The pictures ignited dating speculation, but Cambage swiftly dismissed those rumors in a statement on social media on October 2, 2025, setting the record straight for fans, ""We're just friends enjoying the show nothing more."" Durant hasn't made any comments, but the sighting revealed that Drake's events frequently provide a neutral space for their circle.Durant's journey through teams like the Thunder, Warriors, Nets, Suns, and now the Rockets hasn't weakened their bond. In fact, it seems to make it even stronger, as Drake frequently gives a shoutout to KD's plays on social media, and Durant returns the favor.Also Read: “He wanted to be the top scorer” — Phil Jackson reveals how his relationship with Carmelo Anthony completely collapsed","Kevin Durant and Drake share a light moment courtside during a heated Rockets vs Raptors matchup.

Trae Young’s suffers knee injury during Atlanta Hawks’ matchup against Brooklyn Nets



Atlanta Hawks’ growing injury concerns after Trae Young’s exit



Atlanta Hawks star Trae Young suffered a right knee injury during Wednesday night’s matchup against the Brooklyn Nets, cutting short what began as a promising start for Atlanta. The four-time All-Star collided with teammate Mouhamed Gueye late in the first quarter and was forced to leave the court. The Hawks later confirmed that Young would not return, diagnosing the injury as a right knee sprain.The incident occurred with just over two minutes left in the opening quarter. While defending an inbounds play, Mouhamed Gueye moved toward the basket after being pushed by Brooklyn’s Noah Clowney. He lost balance and crashed into Young’s planted right leg, which twisted awkwardly beneath him. Young immediately grabbed at his knee and stayed on the floor in visible pain.Despite the discomfort, Young tried to continue, remaining in the game for one more possession before motioning to the bench and heading to the locker room. Broadcast cameras captured him speaking briefly with head coach Quin Snyder before exiting.The Hawks’ medical team soon ruled him out for the remainder of the contest.At the time of his departure, Young had scored six points in seven minutes and helped Atlanta build a six-point lead. He entered the game averaging 20.8 points and 9.5 assists per game, though his shooting had been inconsistent at 36.4% from the field and 19.2% from three through the first four games of the season.Young’s absence couldn’t come at a worse time for the Atlanta Hawks, who began the night 1–3 despite lofty preseason expectations. The team has already dealt with several setbacks, including ankle injuries to Jalen Johnson and Zaccharie Risacher, and a brief illness sidelining Kristaps Porzingis. All three returned to face Brooklyn, but Young’s injury cast a shadow over the game and possibly the team’s near-term outlook.If the sprain keeps Young out for multiple games, Nickeil Alexander-Walker, Luke Kennard, and Dyson Daniels are expected to share ball-handling duties. Still, replacing Young’s offensive creativity and court vision is no easy task.The 27-year-old guard remains the heartbeat of Atlanta’s attack. He has been a dynamic playmaker who led the NBA in assists last season with 11.6 per game, a career high. Losing him for any stretch would be a major blow to a Hawks team still trying to find rhythm early in the season.Also Read: Why is Luka Doncic not playing vs the Minnesota Timberwolves?

This is a huge relief for Grizzlies fans, as Morant remains the cornerstone of Memphis’s offensive and leadership efforts amid a challenging start to the season. Ja Morant last appeared in the Grizzlies’ 131-118 loss to the Golden State Warriors earlier this week.

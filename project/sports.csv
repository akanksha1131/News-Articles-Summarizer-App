There is a fine process. Sai Kishore is a fantastic spinner. He has to wait because Ravichandran Ashwin has retired, and Washington Sundar is playing. He has to wait for his chance, and when he gets it, he will grab it with both hands.""Sai Kishore, who plays for the Gujarat Titans (GT) in the Indian Premier League ( IPL ) and Tamil Nadu in domestic cricket, has claimed four wickets at an average of 15.75 in three games. Last year, he represented India at the Asian Games in Hangzhou."" Mayank Yadav has a lot of talent, he is brilliant. There is another fast bowler, Umran Malik . There are many such IPL bowlers who are also performing well in domestic cricket. They are being produced in the MRF Pace Academy. They are working on the basics. India has such a great product, that they are coming one after the other,"" he added.Mayank was marred by injuries in 2024. Following two 'Player of the Match' performances in his first three Indian Premier League (IPL) games for the Lucknow Super Giants (LSG), where he consistently outpaced many sports stars with his accurate and controlled line-and-length and pace of over 150 kmph, he suffered an abdominal injury that prevented him from competing in the tournament. He had another injury while bowling at the National Cricket Academy (NCA) after he had recovered from the first one.He made his debut for India last October. He finished the series with four wickets after hitting the 145 kmph speed often in his four-over performance in the opening match. Before the T20Is against South Africa in November of last year, he suffered another injury. Although he hasn't played competitive cricket since, LSG spent Rs 11 crores to keep him during the mega auction because of his pace and potential.Umran rose to fame in the 2022 Indian Premier League after a 20-wicket season for Sunrisers Hyderabad, during which he reached the 150 kph threshold several times.

The elegant southpaw has been New Zealand's man for the big occasions in recent 50-over global tournaments.Having racked up runs and finished as NZ's highest scorer in the 2023 World Cup in India, Rachin appears to be on a mission to conquer other lands of Asian cricket in the Champions Trophy . The 25-year-old could not have asked for a better initiation to the CT; the 'comeback man', walking out with NZ in a precarious position in the chase, struck a well-compiled match-winning century in the victory over Bangladesh in Rawalpindi on Monday.His composed knock in the Group A clash put a smile on the face of Sriram Krishnamurthy , a coach who has seen Rachin grow from a player with talent to a potential superstar. The left-handed batter, who had credited Sriram for his resurgence in recent years, had worked extensively with him at different teams in NZ, before the latter moved to Chennai to take up the head coach's role at the Super Kings Academy .The two of them share a close bond and connect frequently with distance not being a barrier. ""Rachin does not make it too big in his head. It is normal for us to think that we are playing on a much bigger stage. Sometimes, that can cripple us in terms of our mindset and how we naturally play. But with Rachin, knowing the boy, he does not get bogged down by the magnitude of the events. He approaches the games just like any other matches,"" Sriram told TOI when asked how the Kiwi manages to dish out his best at the highest level.""It allows Rachin to succeed because he does the same things that he normally does. Of course, in cricket, one cannot succeed in every game. But it is a nice coincidence that he happens to do well in ICC events,"" Sriram added.The Super Kings Academy chief coach felt that Rachin could pose a threat to the spin-heavy Indian pack in the forthcoming group match in Dubai, courtesy his ability to handle slow bowlers well. ""He is a good player of spin. He had shown it during the WC in India; he had scored 80-odd (75) against India in Dharamsala. He did well in the Test series in India as well. There is every evidence that he can contribute to a healthy NZ batting lineup,"" Sriram said.""He has played in Pakistan in the last few weeks, so the ultimate challenge will be to adapt to the surface in Dubai. It will be a good test, given the unknown of the Indian bowling attack. With many left-handers in the NZ lineup, we do not know if India will use the same combination (two left-arm spinners and one chinaman).""Coach lauds batter's mentalitySriram lauded Rachin, who suffered a nasty blow to his head during the tri-series in Pakistan, for working towards his comeback with ""great mentality"".""After the injury that he had, we did chat a few times. We just acknowledged that he has to be ready for a game even without much practice. He knew that he had done a lot of work over the years which stood him in good stead.

NEW DELHI: The Champions Trophy Group B game between Australia and South Africa was called off due to persistent rain in Rawalpindi on Tuesday, with no play possible.The rain started early in the morning and despite easing to a drizzle, conditions worsened with poor light.This led to a delay in the scheduled toss at 1:30 pm local time.The continuous rainfall created water pools on the protective covers, which the ground staff couldn't clear, forcing the umpires to abandon the contest.A small number of supporters carrying South African and Australian flags waited hopefully but left disappointed without seeing any cricket action.Both teams received one point each from the abandoned match.Both Australia and South Africa remain in a strong position to reach the semi-finals, having won their previous matches.The Proteas lead the group with three points and a net run-rate of 2.14 following their 107-run victory over Afghanistan in their opening game.Australia hold second place with identical points but a lower net run-rate of 0.475.England and Afghanistan will face each other in Lahore on Wednesday.Both teams need a win to stay in the tournament after losing their first matches.India and New Zealand have already secured their semi-final spots from Group A.Meanwhile, defending champions Pakistan and Bangladesh have been eliminated from the competition.","Australia and South Africa's Champions Trophy Group B game called off due to persistent rain in Rawalpindi.

Champions Trophy: 'India put in more effort, were braver than us,' admits Mohammad Rizwan

Former cricketers in Pakistan expressed dismay on Tuesday following the team's group-stage exit from the ICC Champions Trophy , shortly after celebrating the nation's first major tournament hosting in almost three decades.The defending champions' campaign began with a 60-run loss to New Zealand in Karachi, followed by a decisive six-wicket defeat to India in Dubai. Their qualification prospects ended when Bangladesh couldn't overcome New Zealand on Monday, making Pakistan's final group match against Bangladesh in Rawalpindi inconsequential.Speaking to AFP, former Pakistan skipper Wasim Akram offered stern criticism. ""We have been backing these players for the last few years, but they are not learning nor improving,"" Akram said. ""It is time for a major shake-up. We need to improve our system of domestic cricket so that we can produce quality cricketers, not ordinary ones.""The substandard nature of domestic cricket competitions and low-quality pitch conditions are considered primary factors behind Pakistan's international difficulties. Analysts point to administrative instability and politically influenced appointments in cricket management as contributors to the decline.Former captain Rashid Latif shared similar views with AFP. ""I feel very despondent with the state of Pakistan cricket,"" Latif said. ""We have to follow merit and bring in professionals in the administration of the game, not people appointed on a political basis. Frequent changes in the Pakistan Cricket Board , selection committee, and captains have failed us in forming a proper set-up and team.""The early exit is particularly disappointing as it coincides with Pakistan's first major cricket tournament hosting in 29 years, following enhanced security measures. Recent performances show a concerning pattern, with early exits from both the 2023 ODI World Cup in India and the T20 World Cup in the United States and West Indies.The decline extends to Test cricket, with Pakistan finishing last in the World Test Championship following a drawn home series against the West Indies last month. This latest disappointment adds to the woes of a cricket nation previously known for its strong international presence.","Pakistan exit ICC Champions Trophy after defeat to India.

'Undeniable advantage'

Are India-Pakistan contests overhyped? | ICC Champions Trophy 2025 | IND vs PAK

Champions Trophy: 'Any victory against Pakistan is sweet,' says Shreyas Iyer

Former England captain Michael Atherton commented on the current state of the India-Pakistan cricket rivalry following India's recent victory in Dubai.India secured a six-wicket win, with 45 balls to spare, against Pakistan in their Group A match of the ongoing Champions Trophy on Sunday.""Well, it was completely one-sided. It looked very predictable from a long way out. An underpowered Pakistan batting line-up, as it was in that first game, actually, against New Zealand. There just seemed to lack a bit of energy and dynamism in the batting,"" Atherton said on the Sky Sports Podcast .Atherton shared his thoughts about the match expectations and reality.""There' a bit of an issue for that contest, isn't it? Because it's a highly anticipated contest for all kinds of reasons. Partly, you know, just because of the scarcity value. They only play each other in ICC events on neutral territory for obvious reasons. But there's such hype around that fixture. You kind of want the cricket to live up to that hype as well.""The former England captain analysed the recent history of India-Pakistan encounters.""If you look at the results in the last 10 years, I think they've played each other nine times in ODIs in the last 10 years. Pakistan have only won once, and that was in that final in the Champions Trophy at the Oval. So, it's a one-sided contest right now. But, you know, I looked at the numbers.""Atherton also highlighted the historical performance between the two teams.""Since the start of 2000, actually, Pakistan have been very competitive in ODIs against India. I think they've kind of won 26, lost 30, something like that. But in the last 10 years, in those nine games, it's pretty much all gone India's way with one exception."" Nasser Hussain and Atherton said India have ""undeniable advantage"" of playing all their Champions Trophy matches in Dubai. India are playing all their matches, including a potential final, at the neutral venue in Dubai due to security concerns.“What about the advantage India have in playing in Dubai, only in Dubai? Which seems to me to be a hard-to-quantify advantage, but an undeniable advantage,” said Atherton.“They’re playing at just one venue. They don’t have to travel either between venues or, you know, between countries, as a lot of other teams have to do.“Therefore, the selection, you know, can focus in on the conditions in Dubai. And obviously, they’ll know where they’re playing their semi-final as and when they get through to that. That seems to me to be an undeniable advantage, but, you know, kind of hard to quantify how big an advantage,” he added.Hussain said India have been smart with their selections and their decision to go with five-spinners in the squad makes sense.“It is an advantage. So, the best team in the tournament have that advantage. And I saw a tweet the other day saying ‘Pakistan host nation, India home advantage.’ It sums it up really,” he said.“They are at one place, one hotel, they don’t have to travel. They have one dressing room. They know the pitch, they have picked for that pitch.“They were very smart in their selection. They probably knew what Dubai is going to be like. They picked all their spinners. there was a bit of debate with Indian media saying why don’t you have gone for an extra seamer? Why all these spinners? Now we can seen why.“For example the other sides like England if they do get to the semis they have only one spinner (Rehan Ahmed is added as replacement of Brydon Carse), Pakistan have one frontline spinner. You can says that when the injuries came they should have change that and I have made that argument.“Other teams will have to pick playing XIs for different conditions in Karachi, Lahore and Rawalpindi and then they have to travel and adjust to those conditions.“So it is an advantage but what else could have happened. Once India refused to come to Pakistan, what could have happen. You can’t have a tournament like this without India-Pakistan. It had to be in Dubai.“They sit happily and comfortably there. They know they are going to play six games there and if they will win all those, they will win another global tournament,” he said.","India secured a six-wicket win, with 45 balls to spare, against Pakistan in their Group A match of the ongoing Champions Trophy.

: High-stakes battle for knockout berth

EXCLUSIVE: 'Rohit Sharma way better than Virat Kohli and Babar Azam' | Former Pakistan pacer

New Zealand and India have stormed into the semi-finals of the ICC Champions Trophy 2025 from Group A, leaving hosts Pakistan and Bangladesh out of contention.Rachin Ravindra 's sublime 112 powered New Zealand to a five-wicket win over Bangladesh in Rawalpindi on Monday, sealing their knockout berth and in turn confirming India’s progression as well. Both teams now boast two wins in two matches and will clash in Dubai on Sunday to determine the group winner.The tournament has been a disaster for Pakistan, the defending champions and hosts of their first ICC event since the 1996 ODI World Cup. They suffered back-to-back defeats against New Zealand and India, ending their campaign prematurely.New Zealand have been the dominant force in Group A, following up their emphatic 60-run win over Pakistan with a composed chase against Bangladesh. Michael Bracewell’s career-best 4-36 set up the victory, restricting Bangladesh to 236/9. New Zealand stuttered early but found stability in Ravindra’s ton and Tom Latham’s 55, securing a comfortable chase.With the Group A semi-finalists locked in, the focus now shifts to Group B, where Australia and South Africa will clash in a crucial match on Tuesday in Rawalpindi. Both sides, brimming with batting firepower, will look to take a decisive step toward the semi-finals.Australia, often doubted before ICC events, proved their critics wrong with a stunning record-breaking chase against England in Lahore, showcasing their resilience once again.Dew played a major role in that match and could influence the outcome again in Rawalpindi. Australia’s depleted bowling attack, missing Pat Cummins, Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood, is a concern, but their audacious batting — led by Josh Inglis, Matthew Short, Marnus Labuschagne, Alex Carey and Glenn Maxwell — has been a revelation.South Africa, meanwhile, will rely on their more potent bowling attack, spearheaded by Kagiso Rabada , to challenge Australia. Ryan Rickelton’s aggressive century against Afghanistan, coupled with strong middle-order performances, has boosted their confidence. However, Heinrich Klaasen’s availability remains uncertain after missing the previous match due to injury.Despite an underwhelming build-up, South Africa remain determined to challenge for the title, while Australia aim to prove their tournament pedigree once again. With a semi-final berth on the line, expect a high-stakes, high-intensity battle in Rawalpindi.","New Zealand and India have stormed into the semi-finals of the ICC Champions Trophy 2025 from Group A, leaving hosts Pakistan and Bangladesh out of contention.

Champions Trophy: 'India put in more effort, were braver than us,' admits Mohammad Rizwan

NEW DELHI: Former chairman of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) and cricketer Ramiz Raja raised concerns about Pakistan's strategy in the Champions Trophy after their six-wicket defeat to India in the Champions Trophy on Sunday.He questioned the decision to start their campaign against New Zealand instead of Bangladesh, considering Bangladesh as a relatively easier opponent compared to New Zealand.Raja believed that playing Bangladesh first would have put equal pressure on both teams in Group A, rather than allowing New Zealand to gain an early advantage. Pakistan's defeat to New Zealand added unnecessary pressure on the team, which was further compounded by their loss to India.""I wonder why Pakistan played their first match against New Zealand. They should have played their first match against Bangladesh. Even though Bangladesh is a strong side, it was still comparatively an easy match for them,"" Ramiz said on his YouTube channel.In the high-stakes clash against India, Virat Kohli 's exceptional performance played a pivotal role in jeopardising Pakistan's title defence. Kohli's unbeaten century, coupled with his calm and attacking approach, guided India to a six-wicket victory, leaving Pakistan in a precarious position.Ramiz praised Kohli's knock, describing it as a complete package, adding, ""Virat's knock had everything. There was calmness and attack. He maintained the pace well. Overall, Virat Kohli was a complete package. He keeps on challenging himself. He played confidently against every bowler and didn't allow anyone to settle.""","Former chairman of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) and cricketer Ramiz Raja raised concerns about Pakistan's strategy in the Champions Trophy.

Champions Trophy: 'India put in more effort, were braver than us,' admits Mohammad Rizwan

NEW DELHI: Hosts and defending champions Pakistan crashed out of the ICC Champions Trophy 2025 in the group stage after back-to-back defeats against New Zealand and India. While their campaign officially ends with a final match against Bangladesh, former women's team captain Sana Mir believes Pakistan’s fate was sealed before the tournament even began — when they announced their squad.Speaking on PTV Sports, Mir was direct in her criticism. ""I got a message from a friend when we were watching the match [against India]. When the second wicket fell at 100, my friend said, 'I think it's over.' I told my friend, 'No, it was over when we announced the squad.' We had lost more than half of the tournament the day we picked these 15 players.""She argued that even the greatest captains wouldn't have been able to turn things around with this squad. ""You could make MS Dhoni or Younis Khan the captain — none of them could do anything with this team. It's not suited to our conditions. Like Hafeez bhai said, one match was bound to be in Dubai. So how did we go in with just two part-time spinners? Abrar is still new to ODIs, and he has taken only two wickets in the last five months.""Mir also questioned the selection process, citing Mohammad Haris's omission. ""We talk about intent, and that boy plays with intent. But you drop him after he fails in West Indies matches. What incentive does he have to play freely when selection is based on averages?""Pakistan's squad selection saw last-minute uncertainty, with Saim Ayub ruled out due to injury and Fakhar Zaman sidelined after the first game. Their much-hyped pace attack of Shaheen Afridi , Naseem Shah, and Haris Rauf looked rusty, while Pakistan's decision to rely on part-time spinners backfired.Mir warned that Pakistan's system needs a complete overhaul. ""Too much power is not good, and too little power is not good either. If we keep making the same mistakes, nothing will change. Unfortunately whenever there has been a change in PCB, one person will come and say how domestic things should be. The people below him do not say anything, and nothing changes.""","Pakistan crashed out of the ICC Champions Trophy 2025 in the group stage after back-to-back defeats against New Zealand and India.

""Kohli always knew he'd perform against Pakistan"" | Rajkumar Sharma | Exclusive interview

NEW DELHI: Australian cricket legend Ricky Ponting has heaped praise on Virat Kohli , acknowledging the Indian superstar's consistency and longevity in One Day Internationals (ODIs). Speaking on The ICC Review, Ponting — himself one of the highest run-scorers in ODIs — expressed confidence in Kohli's ability to finish as the format's all-time leading run-getter.Kohli, during his stunning century against Pakistan in Dubai at the ICC Champions Trophy , surpassed the 14,000-run milestone, and is ahead of Ponting, who is fourth with 13,704 runs, in the all-time ODI run charts. With 14,085 runs, Kohli trails only Kumar Sangakkara (14,234) and Sachin Tendulkar (18,426).""He's obviously been a champion player for a long, long time. And particularly in the white-ball formats, where he's been an unbelievably good 50-over player,"" Ponting said. ""I don't think I've ever seen a better 50-over player than Virat Kohli. Now that he's gone past me and with only two ahead of him, I'm sure he would want to give himself the best chance to be remembered as the all-time leading run scorer in the game.""Ponting believes Kohli's fitness and hunger will play a crucial role in his bid to surpass Tendulkar's 18,426-run landmark, a record many once deemed untouchable. ""As long as the hunger's there — obviously physical-wise, he's probably as fit as he's ever been and works exceptionally hard on that side of his game,"" he added.Despite Kohli needing over 4,000 more runs to overtake Tendulkar, Ponting refuses to rule him out. ""It's crazy when you think about it, isn't it? Just how good Virat's been over such a long period of time, yet he's still 4,000 runs behind Sachin. It just goes to show how good Sachin was, but also his longevity in the game,"" Ponting said. ""But with someone like Virat, you never write him off. If the hunger's still there, then I'm never going to write him off.""Kohli's century against Pakistan was another testament to his brilliance in high-pressure situations. His unbeaten knock not only steered India to a six-wicket win but also cemented his legacy with more individual milestones.The Indian bowlers, led by Kuldeep Yadav (3/40) and Hardik Pandya (2/31), restricted Pakistan to 241, ensuring a manageable chase. India stumbled early, but Kohli's unshakable presence in the middle, combined with Shreyas Iyer's composed 56, helped the Men in Blue get across the line comfortably.","Ricky Ponting hails Virat Kohli's consistency and longevity in ODI cricket.

KOCHI: It's a maiden Ranji Trophy final appearance for Kerala. It's unchartered territory for all Kerala players but Aditya Sarwate . Even Jalaj Saxena , a domestic stalwart, hasn't been part of a match of this magnitude before.Sarwate happened to be an integral part of three Ranji finals, winning two and losing one. And all of these outings came for Vidarbha - Kerala's opponents in the final.Sarwate knows Vidarbha like the back of his hand. He played all his cricket for Vidarbha debut before moving to Kerala at the beginning of the season. It's home turf for the seasoned left-arm spinner. Sarwate's family stays half an hour from the Jamtha stadium in Nagpur, the venue for the final.""I never thought I would play a Ranji final here on against Vidarbha. It's a very different feeling,"" the 35-year-old told TOI. Having made his First-Class debut almost a decade back, Sarwate has been one of the pillars around which Vidarbha's success story revolved.In Vidarbha's maiden Ranji Trophy success in 2017-18, Sarwate formed a deadly spin combo with off-spinner Akshay Wakhare , taking 29 wickets in just six matches. By the time Vidarbha defended their title the next season, Sarwate became the fulcrum of their attack, claiming 55 wickets in the season to emerge as the third-highest wicket-taker in the country. He also claimed a 11-wicket haul in the final against Saurashtra to emerge as the player of the final.After he went wicket less in Vidarbha's third final last season which led to a defeat against Mumbai, Sarwate had a fallout with the team management. A hurt Sarwate wasted little time and moved on from Vidarbha. With 30 wickets from eight matches this season, Sarwate has propelled Kerala into the final. He credits his bowling partnership with Saxena for the revival.""I get to learn a lot from him. Bowling in partnership with Jalaj bhai helps. We plot our rival batter's dismissals,"" said Sarwate.Sarwate will be expected to share imparting his experience of playing a Ranji final with his Kerala teammates. After all, he understands the psyche of Vidarbha cricketers like no one else. ""I know the strengths and weaknesses of each player in Vidarbha, and they also know mine. Although there is video analysis of players these days, my tips can come in handy in a match situation,"" he said.Sarwate says he never felt out of place after joining Kerala and credits coach Amay Khurasiya for the team's magnificent show.""When Paras Mhambrey took over as Vidarbha coach, he brought with him that typical Mumbai khadoos (stubborn) attitude. That transformed the Vidarbha side. Chandrakant Pandit took it to a different level. I think Amay bhai has come up with a similar approach for Kerala cricket . He is a tough taskmaster but gets the best out of you. He makes you train hard and helps you iron out your flaws,"" stated Sarwate.His grand uncle Chandu Sarwate played for India in nine Test matches. Over the next five days, the Sarwates would be hoping Aditya builds on the legacy of the family, albeit for his adopted home Kerala.",Kerala face Vidarbha in the final of the Ranji Trophy.

While Vidarbha emerged toppers and have earned their stripes since, Kerala are still searching for glory.This time around, upstarts Kerala finally have their chance after roaring into the final. In 2017-18, Kerala reached the last-eight stage for the first time. Next year, they went a rung higher, reaching the semifinals. Both times, Kerala's tryst with destiny was cut short by Vidarbha, at Wayanad and Surat respectively. Vidarbha, on the other hand, emerged champions in both seasons.Can the Sachin Baby-led Kerala side put it past Vidarbha this time? Vidarbha skipper Akshay Wadkar , for one, doesn't think so. ""When we won the Ranji Trophy back-to-back, we defeated Kerala first in the quarterfinal and then in the semifinal. That is a big plus for us going into tomorrow's final,"" Wadkar said.Going by current form, though, Vidarbha doesn't need the mind games. The former champions are in dominant form, posting eight outright wins in nine matches and a solitary draw. Kerala have won thrice, while drawing the rest of six matches. Vidarbha batters have scored 13 centuries this season. Kerala in comparison have just three tons from their batters.Yash Rathod is leading Vidarbha's batting charge with 933 runs and five centuries. Skipper Wadkar, Karun Nair, and Danish Malewar have scored 550-plus runs this season. Kerala's batting has mostly revolved around Salman Nizar, Mohammed Azharuddeen and skipper Sachin Baby In the bowling department, Vidarbha have Harsh Dubey , the leading wicket taker of the season with 66 scalps. Still, it's Kerala who have an upper hand in the spin department. They boast the experience and variety of off spinner Jalaj Saxena and left-arm spinner Aditya Sarwate , who till last year played for Vidarbha.Both the camps face no injury issues going into the final. Aditya Thakare, Vidarbha's leading pacer has recovered from the hamstring niggle that kept him out of the semifinal against Mumbai. The Jamtha Stadium pitch has a fair covering of grass but is expected to dry out under the harsh sun by Day 2.

NEW DELHI: Former PCB chairman Najam Sethi on Tuesday indirectly held ex-Prime Minister Imran Khan responsible for Pakistan cricket’s downfall.In a post on X, Sethi, who served as PCB chairman from December 2022 to June 2023, expressed concern over the national team’s dismal performance, particularly after their early exit from the Champions Trophy ""The cricket fraternity believes Pakistan has hit rock bottom. How did a team that was once ranked No. 1 in T20s (2018) and Tests (2016), and won the ODI World Cup in 1992 and the Champions Trophy in 2017, fall to the level of Zimbabwe?"" Sethi questioned.According to him, the decline began in 2019 when a new management under a new Prime Minister—Imran Khan at the time—revamped the domestic cricket structure. The traditional system, which had served Pakistan well for decades, was replaced with an Australian-style hybrid model, which Sethi believes was ill-suited to the country’s cricketing needs.""Political interference persisted, and PCB policies became inconsistent. Foreign coaches were hired and then removed, selectors were appointed arbitrarily, and former players past their prime were brought in as mentors and managers,"" he stated.Sethi also highlighted internal issues within the team, pointing out that ""player power, captaincy disputes, and group divisions"" overshadowed effective management, leading to Pakistan's current struggles.Despite the crisis, he remains hopeful that Pakistan cricket can recover if the right issues are identified and addressed with integrity, experience, and professionalism.Sethi had resigned from the PCB soon after Imran Khan became Prime Minister, paving the way for Ehsan Mani ’s appointment as chairman.In 2019, under Imran’s direction, the PCB overhauled the domestic cricket system, replacing the old structure of 16-18 departmental and regional teams with a six-team first-class setup.Later, in 2021, Imran appointed Ramiz Raja as PCB chairman after Mani declined an extension. However, following Imran’s ousting from government in 2022, Raja was replaced by Sethi.","Former PCB chairman Najam Sethi indirectly holds Imran Khan responsible for Pakistan cricket's downfall.

DUBAI: Apart from making it to the semifinals of the 2025 Champions Trophy on Monday when they beat Bangladesh by five wickets at Rawalpindi, New Zealand were most relieved at the return of talented young gun Rachin Ravindra , who was returning to the action after suffering a nasty blow to his forehead which left him bleeding profusely, while taking a catch in the deep during the first match (against Pakistan at Karachi) of the Tri-series in Pakistan just before this tournament.Batting in the middle-order after Daryl Mitchell was ruled out due to illness, the 25-year-old cracked a 105-ball 112 to steer the Black Caps to their second win on the trot in the tournament.Soon after the Kiwis arrived on Tuesday for their final league match against India on March 2, their head coach Gary Stead , in an interview to NZC, expressed his relief at Ravindra's successful comeback from the injury, which saw him take a catch to send back Bangladesh's veteran 'keeper-batsman Mushfiqur Rahim off Michael Bracewell .""Look, you take a nasty blow to the head like that and there's always a chance that could dent your confidence. It was nice to see Rachin get a catch under a high ball pretty early on yesterday, which was probably good for his confidence as well. We've followed all the protocols around concussion and he's come back, and it's nice the way he just slots back in an unfamiliar position with Daryl (Mitchell) going down on the morning of the match (was unwell) as well,"" Stead said.The Black Caps' head coach was pleased with his team's bowlers, who restricted Bangladesh to 236 for nine after the Kiwis elected to field first. ""It was a really good bowling performance. It was a tough bowling surface out there. We stuck to our guns well. Michael Bracewell was outstanding in the way he bowled. He got his personal best figures as well, which is always nice to see. From a batting point of view, we had early hiccups, which can happen in cricket, but I thought Rachin and Devon (Conway) initially, and then Rachin and Tom, the partnership they put together was obviously game-changing. It’s put us in a position we are in now. We have obviously come here in Dubai to play India, but knowing that we've made the semifinal, which is great,"" Stead said.Welcoming the return to the fold of tall pacer Kyle Jamieson , who last played an ODI for the Black Caps against Bangladesh at Mirpur in Sept 2023, before he took one for 49 in nine overs against Sri Lanka at Rawalpindi, the Black Caps head coach said, ""It's fantastic. Kyle has done so much hard work behind the scenes, and there've been so many people that've helped him get to where he is. So, we are delighted to have him back and available to play for the Black Caps. He bowled pretty well without a lot of luck yesterday…to go for 48 off nine on a pretty batter-friendly surface was outstanding.""Stead said that, following an intense Tri-Series in Pakistan, in which they triumphed, and the first two matches of the Champions Trophy in quick time after that, the Kiwis were looking to relax for the next couple of days, before taking on India.""Probably a couple of nice, quite days for the guys to just put their feet up and recover. We've had six games in a couple of weeks, and it takes its toll. Certainly, when you're in the heat as well. It's been some tough matches in Pakistan. We get a couple of days off now, which will be nice. It'll be nice for the guys to just unwind a bit before they ramp up for the India game with a couple of days training as well and getting ready for that game.""",New Zealand beat Bangladesh by five wickets at Rawalpindi on Monday.

DUBAI: During Shubman Gill 's free-flowing 52-ball 46 against Pakistan on Sunday at the Dubai International Stadium, as he carved Shaheen Shah Afridi for three fours in the seventh over, one of the shots stood out. A booming straight drive which showed the hapless bowler the full face of the bat and raced the boundary like a 'tracer bullet.' The spectacular stroke, and the follow through, had the signature style of a certain Sachin Tendulkar - the legend who possessed perhaps the best straight drive in the game - in it.Apart from his short-arm pull, there's another Gill shot that his fans have been watching on loop ever since he unleashed it during his match-winning 101 not out off 129 balls against Bangladesh in India's 2025 ICC Champions Trophy opener at the same venue on Thursday. It came in the ninth over of India's chase, as he despatched seamer Tanzim Hasan Sakib into the second tier of the stands above deep mid-wicket, leaving even his opening partner and Indian captain Rohit Sharma gasping in awe.How fortunes change in cricket! Just a few months back, Gill faced a severe existential crisis in his career, after a rough tour of Australia for the 2024-25 Border-Gavaskar Trophy saw him accumulate just 93 runs in three Tests@18.60, with 31 as his highest score. While a finger injury forced him to miss the first Test and certainly affected his performance, the real low point for him was on Day of the fifth final Test at Sydney, when, needlessly distracted by Steve Smith 's sledging, he charged down the track to Nathan Lyon only to edge the ball to a gleeful Smith at slip.Gill doesn’t think there was anything wrong with his batting in Australia. ""I don't think there was any flaw in my batting in Australia that I couldn't score runs. But, definitely, sometimes there is a mental aspect and we start focusing on the batting, which leads us to think there has to be some fault in the batting that the runs aren't coming. But, I don't think every time it has something to do with batting. It is possible, we are lacking in some other facet. I haven't worked on any area in particular, but knowing I am going to play white-ball format now and then T20s, so I practised accordingly,"" the 25-year-old said before the India versus Pakistan match.Just after enduring an ordinary time Down Under, Gill showed signs of crawling his way back into form when he cracked a century (102) in Punjab’s innings & 207-run defeat against Karnataka at the Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bengaluru in a Ranji Trophy match.Being the Punjab head coach this season, former India opener Wasim Jaffer , himself an elegant batter like Gill, was impressed by Gill’s work ethics.“He practiced quite a lot before the game. At the nets, he used to bat additionally for about 30 to 45 minutes. He wanted to bat more, play a lot of balls. When a youngster spends so much time in the nets, that’s something very nice to see,” Jaffer told TOI from Mumbai.Jaffer felt that Gill was beginning to show signs of being back to his best during his century in that match. “He got out cheaply in the first innings. The wicket had a tennis-ball-like bounce, and the ball was coming slowly off the wicket. He was out caught behind off an inside edge. However, in the second innings, he spent time on the wicket and played beautifully. Obviously, he is not somebody who goes into his shell. He capitalised on the loose balls and got to his century in good time. We made 231, out of which he scored 102, which was nice to see,” Jaffer praised.“He looked like getting his rhythm back. Obviously, whenever you get a century-and he got one against England (in the ODI series) after that-you get some confidence back. That’s exactly what you see now with Gill,” Jaffer added.While refusing to share the details of what his advice to Gill was about his game, Jaffer did compliment the young gun for “setting high standards” for himself. “I didn’t ask him about the Australia tour. I did suggest some minor technical things, not anything major really. We spoke at length about what he feels, he had his opinion. He was aware of what I was saying. He is somebody who takes his game very seriously. He sets very high standards for himself,” the 31-Test veteran said.Raving about Gill's phenomenal rise, former India opener Shikhar Dhawan , who had to literally 'vacate' his spot for Gill in the Indian team, said, ""He's got a tremendous game sense. That's why his consistency and skill level is top-notch. He knows when to hold back, when to unleash himself. Even at such a young age, he has that temperament and knows the art of scoring centuries. It's impeccable. I'm very happy that one big superstar is on his way to create history.""Clearly, Gill, who averages a sensational 62.13 after scoring 2734 runs in 52 ODIs, loves opening the innings with Rohit in the ODIs-the pair has put on 1943 runs in 28 innings@71.96. ""The way we play the game in the powerplay is quite different to each other. Rohit bhai likes to play more aerial shots, and tries to hit those big sixes. And I like to play along the ground and pierce those gaps. In between, if I see that the bowler is under pressure, I like to go over the circle. I think that's the hallmark of us as a pair. We score boundaries with different shots. The bowlers really have to think which areas to target for us, because the areas where we play the shots are different from each other,"" Gill said.""It's a delight to watch [Rohit] from the non-striker's end. He has his own style and if at all it helps me to find my own groove. It's a delight to watch him from the non-striker’s end. We have had some really good partnerships over the past couple of years,"" Gill added.For someone who himself forged a hugely successful opening partnership with Rohit, Dhawan is now taking delight in the success of the Rohit-Gill opening duo, which is taking the bowlers apart in the ODIs. Showering compliments on the pair, Dhawan said, ""Both are quality players. Gill has such good skills, he has so much time. Against Bangladesh), he pulled (Tanzim Hossain) and hit a 90m six. You've to have great skills to do that.”",Shubman Gill scored 46 off 52 balls against Pakistan at the Dubai International Stadium. The 25-year-old's shot of the day was a booming straight drive off Shaheen Shah Afridi. Gill scored 101 not out in India's Champions Trophy opener against Bangladesh.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118559779,imgsize-40748,width-400,resizemode-4/118559779.jpg"

NEW DELHI: South African cricket legend Hashim Amla feels India opener Shubman Gill , along with Rishabh Pant and Ryan Rickelton , as the next stars in international cricket.Gill, now 25 and India's vice-captain for the Champions Trophy , recently reclaimed his position as the top-ranked ODI batter at the tournament's start, following his initial rise to the top in 2023.In Dubai, Gill showcased his skills with a century against Bangladesh and scored 46 runs against Pakistan, contributing to India's consecutive victories.""For India, you have got Shubham Gill; Rishabh Pant has been around for a while. For South Africa, we have Ryan Rickelton who has done really well off late,"" Amla told PTI.""Every country has about 2-3 cricketers who are going to come through and I think that's pretty normal, that you see that every five years some youngster poke in the head through international cricket, and possibly be the next best, big thing,"" he added.""He (Gill) is a brilliant player, the way he started in one-day cricket, he has been exceptional. He has been a huge part of India's success at top of the order.""To have him and Rohit (Sharma) at the top, it's a very potent and dangerous opening partnership, and then they have got Virat (Kohli) at No 3,"" Amla said.Amla believes South Africa's recent tri-series experience in Pakistan will benefit them in the Champions Trophy, particularly against spin bowling.""South African batters are well-equipped. They've had enough practice with the tour to Pakistan just before the Champions Trophy. They've also, by and large, had great success,"" he said.""You've got Heinrich Klaasen, who's been very successful against spinners. He's in the middle order. You've got David Miller, who's been an excellent finisher and (there is) Aiden Markram as well. That middle order has been vital for South Africa's success.""At the top, (Temba) Bavuma is a good player of spin and Rickelton has been very accomplished against spin over the last one and a half years,"" he added.Amla said both India and South Africa have got a ""great chance"" to win the Champions Trophy title.""India have obviously a very good chance, they have a fantastic team over the (last) 15-odd years,"" he said.""South Africa have (a) great chance (too), they have fantastic batting and bowling and whole unit looks very well balanced, they have a excellent chance to make it to top four and then hopefully win it.""With South Africa making finals of the T20 World Cup last year and the World Test Championship final against Australia, Amla said the Proteas did their best against whichever opponents they faced.""South Africa getting into the (WTC) final has been a great achievement. Lots of people have said the different teams you (could) have played against, but that's the group that South Africa were put in,"" he said.""For them to excel and win as many games as they have to get into a final, they did their part and they did their best and they are in the finals.""""It is going to be a really good final, with Australia being a very competitive team. But in a Test match, you (may) just need one or two players to stand up and yes, South Africa could be champions,"" he said.Amla said he has no intention of returning to Test cricket but expressed that competitions such as the IML should be a regular affair.""It's enjoyable, (there are) these elements of uncertainty that we haven't trained and (were) not involved in cricket for the rest of the year, or batting in nets, or playing matches, and that type of excitement, to just see how it all goes,"" he said.""The amount of excitement that has been built around some of the great ex-players, it can only bode well, and who doesn't want to see a (Brian) Lara (or a) (Jacques) Kallis bat?

On 19th February, around 9pm Pacific Standard Time, Agni Chopra boarded his Air India flight from San Francisco to Mumbai. It was also the night for the privately held Major League Cricket ( MLC ) domestic draft to which Agni looked forward to with nervous anticipation. That nervous energy would grip him for the next 17 hours as the flight provided no Wi-Fi option to communicate to the outside world. However, as he prepared for the take off, little did he know that his cricket career was about to take wings as well, in the country of his birth.""I couldn't wait to land. After landing I saw a text from my mom saying that I had been picked up by MI New York for $50,000! I was alone in the plane, and I couldn't really shout or do anything as that would have been very weird since we had just landed. It kind of felt like a full circle moment because I come from the city where the franchise is based. I have been a lifelong MI fan. I just had that moment of gratitude for everyone that's been part of my journey, my family, my coaches especially KP ( Khushpreet Singh Aulakh ) and all my teammates over the years,"" said Agni.Born into a showbiz family of celebrated Bollywood producer Vidhu Vinod Chopra and eminent film critic Anupama Chopra , the journey that Agni referred to, quite serendipitously carries the elements of a Bollywood blockbuster. Right from the time he set foot at Shivaji Park as a six-year-old, his journey has been of highs and lows. An enduring journey of a 'misfit' cricketer trying his best to be a 'Bambaiya' boy. A success story of a player and a coach with an unshakable faith in each other. And many things in between a bad break up and a terrific record break.Despite being brought up in a showbiz household, Agni never took to movies the way other star kids in the industry naturally do. ""My dad would always tell my mom, 'Yeh kiska beta hain? Mera toh nai ho sakta hain' after he saw that I was drawn to cricket and other sports and wasn't really interest in films (laughs)"". He had stars in his periphery as a child but the presence of that star quotient around him inspired him to strive for success and glory in the sphere of life he was fascinated to.""It was like a decision that I made for myself, and since I was six years old, I've always loved cricket, and there was no logic or no reason behind it. It wasn't like my parents made me watch cricket, or I was deliberately exposed to cricket. At six years old, I told my mom I wanted to play cricket, and she took me to Shivaji Park.""From privileged to the underprivileged, cricket is played by an entire strata of society in Mumbai. Moreover, the proportion of affluent class may have seen a dip in numbers on the Mumbai maidans in the recent years. For the 'privileged' young Agni it was always a constant battle at Shivaji Park and beyond in shedding the 'misfit' tag. About taking pains of vanquishing the preconceived notions about his background. And a perennial effort to be 'one of them.' If his privilege off the field was a boon, that privilege soon would become a bane on it.""At the age of eight or 10, people didn't look at me differently. I was just one of the boys. The only difference was that I didn't know Marathi coming from a Punjabi family. So at the time, I started learning Marathi. Then when I was about 12, I could kind of sense that people would look at me differently, or they would speak to me differently, and that at the time, I couldn't understand what it was. But then I understood that it was because of my background. And at the time, I became very aware of certain things, and I would try my best to fit in.""""One example is I used to practice at MiG ground, close to my school. But I would go from school to the ground, and I had a driver with me, so I would always tell the driver that he park the car a few blocks away. And then I'd walk five minutes to the ground, so that nobody knew that I was coming with a car or I had a driver because I didn't want to stand out in that way. And even when I leave, I'd do the same and make sure that nobody would see me. So that was just something that I tried to do to fit in, because I didn't want to be different, or I didn't ask to be different either.""Agni felt the pangs of 'privilege' not just amongst peers but in general perception amongst a few coaches and selectors as well. The dogmas around Agni's cricket had many even doubting his love for the game.""The preconceived notion was that 'he's not a good guy because he is a rich kid'. 'He doesn't care about cricket because he's a rich man's son'. 'He doesn't have to play cricket'. 'He'll quit cricket', and 'he's not interested in cricket'. Basically, that was kind of the notion that without me saying anything, or without meeting me or judging me as a person, that is what people thought. I knew a few selectors also thought similarly during my first couple of under-19 years. There were times where people would not like me or not think that I was fit to be in the Mumbai team, purely because of this reason.""Agni managed to get a level of acceptance in the cricketing fraternity by reaching across the aisle in different ways but he knew he could only command respect by what he does between the 22 yards.He enjoyed his first real moment in the sun after amassing nearly 800 runs in 10 games in the Col. C.K. Nayudu Trophy, a BCCI U-23 tournament, in the 2019-20 season. He ended up topping the run charts for Mumbai with three hundreds including a double century. Agni credited that reincarnation as a batter to his coach and now brotherly figure Khushpreet Singh Aulakh. The pair have been working together since July 2019.""When we first met, he didn't have that belief in himself. And that belief comes from practice. We elevated the level of his practice. He had never played over 200 balls in a net session before that. We set targets like playing 25,000 balls per month. A good thing about him is that he is not lazy. If I ask him to wake up at 5 am and train he was willing to do that,"" said Khushpreet.While Agni surrendered his mind and body to Khushpreet's modus operandi, it took time for him to be his guardian at heart. Agni had sent an SOS call to Khushpreet after failing in the first two games of the C.K. Nayudu trophy. Khushpreet left for Himachal Pradesh to help Agni turn the tide. The counsel worked as Agni duly notched a double hundred in the next game against Bengal and remained prolific with the bat throughout the tournament thereafter.""KP introduced me to Shubman Gill and he has been another major influence in my life. We struck it off right away and started spending a lot more time with each other. What was happening with me was that I only cared about results, and Shubman is completely opposite. Shubman cares about the process. He makes the process paramount and results irrelevant. I benefited a lot from being around him,"" added Agni.The summit of the 2019-20 season, however, was followed by an abyss post-COVID that stretched till mid 2023. He failed to get the backing of the Mumbai selectors for the 2020-21 Ranji Trophy season, something a youngster would typically get after a stellar CK Nayudu trophy. A freak nail injury had him grounded for a bit of 2022 and he came to his wits end when he lost his place in the XI at Dadar Union, his primary club.""It was at that moment I had given up my dream of playing in the Ranji Trophy for Mumbai. It was a really big blow to me. I felt like 'I'm done playing cricket.' Because I was 22 and had been dropped from my Mumbai club team. I was also with this girl at the time, and I went through a breakup. It was a bit messy, it wasn't the best situation. I'd never experienced that before, because I had never, kind of dated anyone. I was only playing cricket. But through that period I was very low. There were times where I would think about quitting and letting it go or doing something else, but that love for cricket really sustained me.""A call up to the Mizoram squad for the Ranji Trophy Plate Division aided Agni in putting those distractions to bed. That moment of reckoning he had yearned for while grinding day-in, day-out had finally arrived. The left-hander seized the moment by the scruff of its neck and blazed his way into the record books with four centuries in his first four First-Class games. He ended the season with a whopping 939 runs in six games. He emulated his superhuman effort the next season to sustain a collective average of 94.94 over 13 First-Class games.""I've never in my life thought that I have more than one game to play, or two games to play max, because if you don't perform well in two games, you're dropped in Mumbai. It's as simple as that. I was relishing the fact that I have an entire season to play here for Mizoram. You become a different cricketer after a sense of security and it has a positive impact in the way you practice as well.""Agni maintains that he has no qualms in retiring from the First-Class game in India despite the highs of the past two seasons. An American passport holder by virtue of his birth, he was pushed to come to this decision after BCCI mandated participation only from Indian passport holders for the Ranji Trophy. He confided that it wasn't an easy decision since days cricket is still the pinnacle of the game for him but it was more of a practical decision given the pecking order he finds himself in for India selection. Besides, the lure of locking horns against some of the best in the world while being at the peak of his powers was quite simply too big of an opportunity to let go.""It has always been my dream of playing the Ranji Trophy, playing in the Elite Division and going on to win the title. Playing in the MLC and US opens the doors for me to play international cricket as well. I would have still applied for an Indian passport and stayed if I had been picked in the Indian Premier League (IPL) but looking forward to my time in America now.""Agni is an avid reader and a big believer in the philosophical idea of manifestation. He read a self-help book titled 'Tipping Point' during COVID which professed a motivation theory through an extended metaphor of how seemingly insignificant adding a drop of water everyday to a glass is, until the time it overflows at some point. Agni takes great heart from the midnight oil he has been burning over the past five years which in turn has fuelled an unbridled surge in his runs and stocks - an ascent reflected in his selection as MI New York's No. 1 draft pick.","Agni Chopra was picked up by MI New York for $50,000.

Chelsea secured a spot in the Premier League 's top four with a commanding 4-0 victory over Southampton, while Aston Villa's Champions League aspirations took a hit following a 4-1 loss to Crystal Palace.Chelsea, coming off three straight defeats, found their form against bottom-placed Southampton, who appear headed for Championship relegation.The Blues dominated with three first-half goals from Christopher Nkunku, Pedro Neto, and Levi Colwill, marking only their third league victory in 11 matches.A small group of Chelsea supporters protested outside Stamford Bridge before the match, expressing concerns about the club's performance and ticket pricing.The match provided a much-needed boost for Enzo Maresca's team, with Nkunku scoring his 14th goal of the season, though only his third in the Premier League due to Nicolas Jackson's injury limiting his playing time.Nkunku opened the scoring with a header from a corner before setting up Neto for the second goal. Colwill added a third before halftime from Neto's free-kick delivery.Marc Cucurella completed the scoring with a composed finish from young Tyrique George's cross.""We needed that, the fans needed that and the club needed that so we are happy,"" said Maresca.""The priority is to bring this club to where this club should be - the Champions League. It will be like this until the end of the season - we will be up and down and we need to be ready.""Chelsea now sits two points above Manchester City in fourth place, with a top-five finish likely sufficient for Champions League qualification due to English clubs' strong European performances.Villa's European hopes suffered a setback at Selhurst Park, having won just once in their last seven league games.""After today, with a loss, it is difficult to try to explain everything,"" said Emery. ""We have to move on and be motivated in the competitions - FA Cup and Champions League and get the balance in the Premier League.""Palace's Ismaila Sarr scored first, with Morgan Rogers equalizing after halftime. Jean-Philippe Mateta restored Palace's lead before Sarr and Eddie Nketiah sealed the victory.Oliver Glasner's Palace have won seven of their last nine matches, rising to 12th place, six points behind 10th-placed Villa.Brighton secured a 2-1 victory over Bournemouth in a south coast clash between teams pursuing European spots.Joao Pedro converted a penalty he earned to give Brighton the lead.

Real Madrid 's Carlo Ancelotti expressed concerns on Tuesday about the demanding fixture schedule, labelling the football calendar as ""absurd"" and ""unsustainable"".The team could potentially play 72 matches this season if they advance in all competitions, including the Champions League , Copa del Rey and Club World Cup .They have already secured the Intercontinental Cup and European Super Cup but fell short against Barcelona in the Spanish Super Cup final in Saudi Arabia.Ancelotti acknowledged that teams competing at this level are performing admirably despite the challenging schedule. Los Blancos are set to face Real Sociedad in a Copa del Rey semi-final first leg in the Basque region on Wednesday.""In the span of 52 days, tomorrow will be our 17th game,"" continued Ancelotti.

Liverpool manager Arne Slot believes Mohamed Salah has a strong chance of winning the Ballon d’Or, but insists silverware will be key to securing the prestigious award.The Egyptian forward, 32, has been in outstanding form this season, scoring 30 goals and providing 21 assists across all competitions. He is considered a frontrunner for the Ballon d’Or, widely regarded as football’s top individual prize.However, Slot emphasised on Tuesday that Salah’s chances will significantly improve if Liverpool clinch major trophies this season.""It's a good sign that Mo is in the conversation because it means he is performing well, and so is the team,"" Slot said. ""But to remain in that discussion, he must maintain this level of performance for the rest of the season.""In general, players who win the Ballon d’Or usually win trophies as well. So, it’s a great challenge ahead—for him and for us as a team.""Liverpool currently sit 11 points clear at the top of the Premier League with 11 matches remaining. They are also in the League Cup final against Newcastle and set to face Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League last 16.Despite their commanding league position, Slot dismissed any concerns about complacency. ""These players have been in this competition far longer than I have. They know how tough every game is, and with 11 still to play, there’s a long way to go,"" he said.When asked if Salah’s current form could be compared to Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi at their peak, Slot was reluctant to make direct comparisons.""He has had some incredible seasons at Liverpool, and we hope he continues that for a long time. But to do so, he would need to extend his contract first,"" he noted.Salah has yet to sign a new deal to remain at Anfield beyond this season, and Slot was asked whether his stellar performances could complicate negotiations.""You can see it both ways,"" he said. ""The better he plays, the more expensive he might become. If he underperformed, we might have doubts about extending his contract.""So, it’s best for everyone that he continues performing at this level—maybe except for the one who has to pay him!""","Liverpool manager Arne Slot believes Mohamed Salah has a strong chance of winning the Ballon d’Or, but insists silverware will be key to securing the prestigious award.

Galatasaray , the Turkish Süper Lig leaders, announced plans to initiate criminal proceedings and report Fenerbahçe manager Jose Mourinho to FIFA and UEFA over alleged racist statements. The controversy emerged following a goalless draw between the two teams in Istanbul on Monday night.Mourinho had expressed satisfaction with the appointment of Slovenian referee Slavko Vinčić for the match.After the game, Mourinho shared his thoughts about the referee's performance during his post-match press conference.""The performance of the referee was a top performance. Anyone, not just from this country but also abroad, watched a big football match. I think the man responsible for that was the referee.""""I went to the referee's dressing room after the game.

A Turkish referee would have [given Akcicek] a yellow card after one minute, and after five minutes I would have to change him.""Galatasaray issued a strong response through an official statement:""Since the commencement of his managerial duties in Türkiye, Fenerbahçe manager Jose Mourinho has persistently issued derogatory statements directed towards the Turkish people. Today, his discourse has escalated beyond merely immoral comments into unequivocally inhumane rhetoric. We hereby formally declare our intention to initiate criminal proceedings concerning the racist statements made by Jose Mourinho, and shall accordingly submit official complaints to UEFA and FIFA. Furthermore, we shall diligently observe the stance adopted by Fenerbahçe -- an institution professing to uphold 'exemplary moral values' -- in response to the reprehensible conduct exhibited by their manager.""Mourinho has previously expressed concerns about officiating in Turkey this season.

How Mohun Bagan enjoyed a full bloom,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/how-mohun-bagan-enjoyed-a-full-bloom/articleshow/118545528.cms,"Coach Molina enjoys the spotlight after teaching Mariners winning mantra

KOLKATA: Sometimes you need a big bang to claim your world. Something radical and explosive, like a new birth. The big bang moment for Mohun Bagan SG came right at the outset of the season. And it was served in fashion typical of the famed Maidan culture, by showing the existing coach the door -in this case an ISL Shield winner in Antonio Lopez Habas, no less!In another outside-of-the-box flourish, in came Jose Molina . But his return to Indian football eight years after guiding ATK to their second title in a nascent league, was anything but smooth. His reign began with defender Anwar Ali's controversial switch to crosstown rivals East Bengal FC . More setbacks followed -a loss to NorthEast United in the season-opening Durand Cup final and then a shoddy defence of the ISL Shield title.Bagan were looking shaky and the call for Molina's head -especially after East Bengal FC decided to give Carles Cuadrat the sack - gained ground.Then, everything changed between Sept 28 when Bagan lost 0-3 to Bengaluru FC away and Oct 5, when they blew away Mohammedan SC 3-0 at home. The win over old Maidan rivals set in motion their all-conquering run at home this season. ""I'm not worried about a sacking. If it has to happen, it will happen,"" Molina had said on the eve of the match, ""I think the team is getting closer to where I want it to be. Takes time, but I'm happy.""On Sunday, an almost packed and febrile Salt Lake Stadium witnessed a different Molina when Bagan rode a Dimitrios Petratos ' stoppage time goal to edge Odisha FC 1-0 and become the first team to defend the ISL Shield. Usually restrained, a stoic face betraying little, the 54-year-old let his hair down -the celebration began with a leap and punch in the air, and a triumphant run in manic delight.The ambush completed, the Shield defended, the man needed that show-stealing stage to realize his moment of truth. ""To win a trophy, you need to be a team. It's not just about 11 players. You have to be a team, everybody has to feel important,"" Molina would tell everyone an hour later.This is perhaps what has set Molina's Bagan apart from the rest this season. Take for example Petratos. The Australian striker played an inspirational role in helping Bagan lift its first Shield last season but lost his starting place with the arrival of Jamie Maclaren. His last goal had come in a losing cause over two months ago, when Bagan went down 1-2 to Goa for only their second league defeat this term.""The last two months is not a failure. You only fail when you stop, so I never gave up,"" Petratos pointed out. Maclaren also provided another insight. ""We've shown that we don't rely on one goal scorer. That's a sign of a good team, that they are hungry from the back through to the front,"" said A-League's all-time leading scorer. The backline of Subhasish Bose, Tom Aldred and Alberto Rodriguez was instrumental in scripting 14 clean sheets in the season; it also resulted in record-breaking spell of 570 minutes without conceding a goal.Even more, Subhasish now has most goals by a defender in an ISL season (6), with Rodriguez chipping in with five more. Five months ago, it was a different battle for Molina who appeared to be in the firing line. Yet, he believed in his project, transformed Bagan into a winning machine and helped them find their place in the sun. In doing so, Molina reclaimed his world in Indian football.",Mohun Bagan SG are the first team to defend the ISL Shield. Bagan beat Odisha FC 1-0 in the final at the Salt Lake Stadium. Coach Jose Molina believes in his project and has transformed Bagan into a winning machine.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118545519,imgsize-119486,width-400,resizemode-4/118545519.jpg"
Why Liverpool have been unstoppable in Premier League,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/epl/top-stories/why-liverpool-have-been-unstoppable-in-premier-league/articleshow/118544329.cms,"Seldom in recent years has the English Premier League title been all but sealed as early as February. But such has been Liverpool 's supremacy in a season where otherwise perennial winners Manchester City slipped into oblivion, and closest challengers Arsenal have endured untimely setbacks in the title race, that it looks good as done. Arne Slot's Liverpool, who made a thumping statement with the league double over defending champions City on Sunday, enjoy a 11-point cushion at the summit with about one-third of the season remaining. TOI analyses the key factors for the Reds' dominant run among Europe's elite leagues this term…Fitting in the Slot: While Kop favourite Jurgen Klopp established a base for future success and left behind a fine squad for Slot to inherit, the Dutchman has surprised the sceptics by seamlessly adapting to the English game. In his maiden EPL season, Slot has gone toe to toe with the best, thanks to his flexibility and tactical tweaks - the 'relocation' of Cody Gakpo for one. The Dutch international is relishing his current role on the left wing after being used primarily as a striker under Klopp. ""It felt a little bit like the 'old me'. I feel really good in this position,"" Gakpo, owner of eight EPL goals this season, said. On Sunday, Slot showed his tactical nous again, employing midfielders Curtis Jones and Dominik Szoboszlai up front in the absence of an out-and-out striker.Run like the Egyptian: Mohamed Salah has been enjoying an extraordinary season, forever raising an already high bar. With 25 goals and 16 assists in 27 appearances, the north African has been the league's most productive player by a distance. For perspective, Salah's closest rivals (Alexander Isak (Newcastle United) and Erling Haaland (City)) trail him by six goals in the standings. ""He gets the ball and does something special, that is sometimes difficult. But not many things seem difficult for Mo,"" Slot said of his 32-year-old spearhead. ""We need another title. Me and the big guys in the team, we need another title,"" Salah, whose current deal is set to expire at the end of the season, said.Ryan's gig: Ryan Gravenberch has proved indispensable to Slot's system, so much that even a slight dip in form has been overlooked. Forging a strong partnership with Alexis Mac Allister in the middle of the park, the Dutch midfielder has shone in his deep-lying defensive role. The 22-year-old has been handed a start in every EPL match thus far and Slot has used like-for-like replacement in Wataru Endo off the bench. ""When you come to Liverpool, you always want to be in the first XI,"" Gravenberch had said. ""When Slot told me that he sees me as a No. 6, I knew what I had to do. Of course, I have had to adapt a little bit, but it has been going really well,"" the youngster had added.Moderate means more: Where everyone simply splashes the cash, Liverpool did not spend big in the last two transfer windows. The only senior arrival was Italian forward Federico Chiesa. Yet, despite not possessing a luxurious squad depth, Slot has managed available resources admirably. Liverpool have reaped the rewards of their emphasis on injury prevention, hardly losing key players to long-term injuries - nine players have made 25 appearances or more so far this season. Training sessions not being as intense as they were during Klopp's era and Slot's ""patient"" and ""possession-based"" style have greatly helped in this regard.Virgil's vigil: Led by their talismanic centre-half Virgil van Dijk , Liverpool have the second-best defensive record in the league; they are behind Arsenal, having conceded 26 goals. The Reds are perched at the top of the 'clean sheets' table with 11 shutouts, despite not being at their best defensively in recent fixtures. ""Clean sheets are one of the reasons why you win a lot,"" is the Slot maxim.","Arne Slot's Liverpool are 11 points clear at the top of the EPL table. The Dutchman has impressed since taking over from Jurgen Klopp. Liverpool have the second-best defensive record in the league, having conceded 26 goals. Mohamed Salah has been the league's most productive player.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118544297,imgsize-75418,width-400,resizemode-4/118544297.jpg"

KOLKATA: On a night when India and Pakistan were busy playing out cricket's greatest rivalry in Dubai, the sight of hundreds of cars causing a traffic jam on EM Bypass in this part of the world was not normal.On a night when Indian club football's biggest prize was up for grabs and runaway leaders Mohun Bagan SG were at home, the sight of Jose Molina's team huffing and puffing for a goal in the regulation time, and that too in their formidable fortress, was not normal. Then, everything became normal, almost with a sense of inevitability, at the Salt Lake Stadium on Sunday.Dimitrios Petratos , coming off the bench late in the second half, received a ball from Manvir Singh, swivelled to transfer his striking power from right to left foot and took an aim towards the goal from the edge of the box. The ball flew past a jungle of feet before settling into the bottom left corner of Odisha FC goalkeeper Amrinder Singh's net.It was the third of the nine-minute stoppage time but good enough for Mohun Bagan to beat a 10-man Odisha FC 1-0 and become the first Indian club to defend the ISL Shield . Unlike last season when the team under Antonio Lopez Habas required a win over Mumbai City in the last match of the league stage to lay their hands on the Shield, Molina's side sealed the deal with two games in hand.Their 12th straight wins at home this term also took their tally to 52 points from 22 matches, breaking another new ground in the league and turning nearest rivals FC Goa's late push into insignificance now.Sergio Lobera's Odisha came here with a plan. They were happy to play second fiddle to Bagan's buccaneering pace and potency, defending in numbers and hoping to catch the hosts off guard with quick counter-offensives whenever such an opportunity presented itself. Their ploy appeared to pay off until the 83rd minute when Mourtada Fall was forced into a challenge from behind on a goal bound Jamie Maclaren inside the D and referee Harish Kundu flashed a straight red card to Odisha's Senegalese defender.It proved to be a game-changer.Molina went for an all-out attack, bringing on Jason Cummings in place of defender Tom Aldred. This forced Lobera to react, sacrificing his Piano player Hugo Boumous and bringing in his place more defender in Narender.The tall order for Odisha suddenly had become even taller. Petratos - who replaced Aldred in the 78th minute - then seized his moment, bringing purpose to the occasion, delving into his trademark stein gun celebration and sending even a hard-nosed Molina to break into a jig.In the presence of more than 50000 green-and-maroon spectators at the stadium, the lingering anticipation had been palpable even before the kickoff. Bagan dominated, first forcing Amrinder to come up with back-to-back saves denying Greg Stewart and Maclaren in the closing stages of the opening half and Manvir and Maclaren awfully squandering more chances from close after the break.Thus reprieved, Odisha, now with 29 points from 22 matches, hoped to stay on track for making the playoffs.Then the visitors suffered the game changing fall through the expulsion of Fall. Bagan suddenly sensed their chances and Petratos made the most of it, sending the stands into rapture.Odisha's defeat also meant that Jamshedpur have qualified for the playoffs.",Mohun Bagan become the first Indian club to defend the ISL Shield.

Especially when you are in the title race, it is incredible,"" said Salah after Liverpool's first league win at the Etihad for a decade.""Me and the big guys in the team, we need another title.""This was another heartbreaking loss for the deposed English champions, who are currently 20 points behind the top, only days after losing to Real Madrid in the Champions League Throughout Pep Guardiola 's illustrious leadership, Liverpool has frequently failed in the great rivalry of English football in recent years.However, in Arne Slot's first season as manager, it currently looks as though they will be able to break Manchester United 's record of 20 English top-flight titles in a matter of months.""We work every single day to achieve this and it is three months of very hard work (ahead) to maintain this,"" said Slot.""It is important to understand why we are where we are.""The pressure on Liverpool, which had increased after they lost two of their previous three games at Everton and Aston Villa, was reduced by Arsenal's shocking 1-0 home loss to West Ham on Saturday.The hardest test of all has traditionally been a trip to the Etihad, but City's defensive weaknesses were readily shown, and they also missed the injured Erling Haaland 's offensive presence.In contrast, Liverpool's star was healthy and playing well, as Salah increased his incredible season total to 25 goals and 16 assists in 27 Premier League games.The Egyptian's masterfully performed set-piece move put the visitors ahead in the 14th minute.Szoboszlai flicked Alexis Mac Allister's corner into Salah's path, and his shot ducked off Nathan Ake and beyond Ederson's dejected dive.Omar Marmoush had gone offside before Phil Foden brought him in, but City's own Egyptian international shown his ability to finish at the other end.Trent Alexander-Arnold was being skipped past by City winger Jeremy Doku at will, but the Belgian kept missing with a telling cross or strike.When he sprinted onto a long ball over the top and teed up Szoboszlai to wrong-foot Ederson, Salah was not so understanding.If Liverpool had been equally accurate on the counterattack after the half, the ultimate result may have been far more humiliating for City.A VAR review disallowed Curtis Jones' third goal for offside after Szoboszlai's run through the center of the City defense was just not timed.Only an incredible last-ditch tackle by Abdukodir Khusanov stopped Szoboszlai a second goal, and Ederson was forced into a spectacular save by Luis Diaz.In last weekend's 4-0 victory over Newcastle, Marmoush scored a hat-trick and continued to be a dangerous threat by putting another effort in front of Alisson Becker's goal.However, City didn't produce enough to reach the 70 percent possession mark.Despite suffering their eighth league loss of the year, Guardiola's team is still in fourth place and will be sure to qualify for the Champions League the next year, as a top-five finish is probably sufficient.However, City now looks like yesterday's club following an incredible run of four straight victories, with Liverpool emerging as the new champions.",Liverpool beat Manchester City 2-0 at the Etihad Stadium.

It might have something to do with the 27-year-old's catchphrase 'responsibility' which has him turning inward.Rublev is back at the Dubai Duty Free tennis championships , where he was defaulted 12 months ago, following an animated rant at a lines judge at the fag end of the semifinals. The Russian, known as much for his mercurial temper as for his penchant for self-harm, beating himself with his racket and leaving his hands and legs bloodied, spoke about his struggles with burnout and depression.""I was completely lost. I was thinking what's the purpose of living,"" said Rublev, who has battled in the dark for a few years now. ""The thing is when it happens for a few months, you still have patience (that you can overcome), but when it goes on for years you feel you cannot take it anymore.""It's like a pain,"" he said, pointing at his arm. ""It starts to grow more and more, and you want to cut the arm.""Rublev, who fell in the first round of the Australian Open , won his 17th career title in Doha last week. ""I was taking antidepressants, but after one year of taking antidepressants, I realized that in the beginning you feel a bit better, then nothing afterwards,"" he said. ""After some time I realized that while it's not getting worse, something was weird. I didn't like that feeling so I stopped taking the medication.""With the help of his charismatic compatriot Marat Safin , a former World No. 1, Rublev started finding his way back. ""Marat made me understand myself, that was a bit of a restart from the bottom. From there, little by little, I started to move in a better direction,"" he said, adding, ""I'm not in a good or a bad place (now), but I'm not feeling any more stress, I'm not feeling anxious, I'm not having depression. I'm just neutral. Not happy, not bad, but I have found a base and that's a beginning.""The main thing is to be honest with yourself,"" the World No. 9 said. ""All of us think that we (may not be) honest with people, but with ourselves we are honest. This is a huge lie because most people are not even honest with themselves. I was the same. I (thought) I have no problem saying if I'm wrong, if I'm right, if I made a mistake.""I was lying to myself about many things. I didn't even want to understand or notice it. You need someone who can make you see yourself in an honest way.""""People put masks on, they make excuses for that, I'm doing that because someone hurt me or I don't want them to see the real me.,"" he said, ""They are already lying, running away from the problem, finding an excuse. They don't want to face themselves. The first thing is to be honest with yourself, then start to be more aware.""This search for his true self is stirred by a one-word reminder - responsibility -which Rublev writes on his shoes. Every time he looks down the word stares back at him. ""I'm putting that word there to remind myself that I'm the one, it's not because of anything or anyone.

""The hardest part is to be positive, to be there (in the moment) 100 per cent mentally, when things are not going your way.""For much of her near two-hours on court against the in-form Tauson, the Russian tried but couldn't produce the tennis that saw her put out three Grand Slam champions - Marketa Vondrousova, Iga Swiatek and Elena Rybakina - in a week. ""I told myself, you can either let that negativity come into your head or you can choose to fight for every point,"" Andreeva said. ""I've been listening to a lot of LeBron James interviews. He said it's easy to be confident and to play good when everything goes your way. What makes you a champion is when you're giving your best when you don't feel great. That's what I tried to do in the final.""Andreeva's goal for the 2025 season was to break into the top-10, now that she has debuted in the top tier at No.9 this week, the teenager promptly raised the bar.""The higher your ranking is, the slower the climb (becomes) because the difference in the points is very little,"" she said. ""If I win another tournament, I'm going to be top-eight maybe. If I win another tournament, I can still be top eight. It's going to be hard to enter the Top-five. That is the goal I'm going to set for myself, to be Top-five by the end of the year.""When asked what she'd do with this week's earnings of $597,000, Andreeva shrugged. She felt she had everything she needed.""I don't know what I want, I feel like I have everything. I won the tournament. I've already reached the goal that I had set for myself for the end of the year,"" she said, adding, ""My family is traveling with me. I have a great team. I feel happy, and this is all I need.""A couple of minutes later she was asked if she likes to shop, Andreeva's face mirrored a light bulb.""Yes, of course I like shopping, it doesn't matter what I buy, just as long as I buy something, I already feel good. It can be jewelry, a pair of jeans, socks, cap… As long as I buy something, I feel like the day is successful,"" Andreeva said, noting that her father Alexander doesn't like to shop. ""I like to buy something, even something from the grocery store.""It's easy to forget Andreeva's age when she's on the tennis court, serving big and painting the lines with her groundstrokes. Just as well that she doesn't hold back when she's not aiming for the lines.","Mirra Andreeva is the youngest winner of a WTA 1000 title.

In modern-day tennis, where power brings glory, the 26-year-old has had to 'adapt or die'.De Minaur, the second seed in the Dubai Duty Free tennis championships - a 500 Series event for the men which gets underway on Monday - is one of five men in the ATP's top25, who stands at 6 ft (183 cms), the shortest in the top-tier of the sport.The Aussie, ranked eighth in the world, broke into the top-10 for the first time last Jan, and has spent most of the last 14 months in that elite bracket.De Minaur, who opens against the 6-ft-6-in veteran Marin Cilic in the first round here, shares a 2-2 head-to-head record with the 36-year-old Croat. ""I'm looking forward to a tough first-round match - a veteran player with a lot of experience, very dangerous, especially on these types of courts. I'm expecting a battle,"" he said.De Minaur, who took Carlos Alcaraz the distance in the final at Rotterdam in early Feb, likes how he has started the year.""I'm happy, I have played some great tennis. I've lost to Jannik (Sinner), to Carlos (Alcaraz) and now I lost to Andrey (Rublev in Doha last week) after having a match point, the last one stings a little bit because I feel like I had my chances. It's all about putting myself in those situations, giving myself the opportunity.""De Minaur said, ""People are hitting the ball with a lot more force (today). You're losing a little bit of that variety that you had with the likes of Roger (Federer). It feels like everything's a lot more fast-paced, because of the tech, racquets, balls… Conditions are slower, everyone is hitting the ball so much harder.""Nice guy De Minaur, nicknamed 'Demon', found inspiration in where he finished last year, inside the top-10 and making the season-ending field in Turin.Mirra Andreeva became the youngest at 17 years to clinch a WTA 1000 title since its inception 16 years ago.

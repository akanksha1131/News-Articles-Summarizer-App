Mohsin Naqvi Cornered At ICC Meet In Dubai; Asia Cup Trophy Dispute Turns Into Diplomatic Face-Off





A controversial moment unfolded during the India A versus Pakistan Shaheens match in the Asia Cup Rising Stars tournament on Sunday. The incident involved a relay catch between Nehal Wadhera and Naman Dhir that was ultimately ruled not out by the third umpire.India A had set a modest target of 137 runs after experiencing a significant batting collapse.Pakistan A opener Maaz Sadaqat was dominating the chase with an impressive 31-ball fifty. The turning point occurred on the first ball of the 10th over when Suyash Sharma induced a lofted shot from Sadaqat towards deep field.The controversial play began when Nehal Wadhera chased the shot to the boundary. While airborne outside the rope, he managed to flick the ball back into play, and Naman Dhir completed what appeared to be a valid relay catch inside the field.Maaz Sadaqat had already started walking back, assuming he was dismissed. However, the on-field umpires asked him to wait for the third umpire's decision.The decision displayed as ""Not out"" on the screen left the Indian players stunned. Captain Jitesh Sharma immediately sought clarification from the officials regarding the ruling.Watch:The decision was based on a significant boundary fielding rule change announced by the MCC in June 2025.The amendment to Law 19.5.2 addressed confusion around airborne relay attempts and multiple touches outside the field of play.The previous rule only considered the first fielder's position and grounding. This allowed multiple airborne relay touches outside the boundary.The updated law now requires all fielders who touch the ball to meet specific grounding requirements. A fielder can touch the ball once while airborne outside the boundary but must land inside the field and remain there until the ball becomes dead.According to Sub-Clause 19.5.2.1, when a fielder touches the ball while airborne outside the rope and then lands outside, the ball is automatically considered a boundary.In this case, because Wadhera’s first contact after touching the ball occurred outside the boundary line, the dismissal was disallowed.The controversy deepened when neither a six nor a single run was awarded to Pakistan Shaheens on the delivery, as no batters crossed the crease.Taking advantage of this fortunate decision, Sadaqat guided Pakistan Shaheens to a convincing eight-wicket victory. This win secured Pakistan Shaheens a place in the semi-final.",Controversial moment unfolded during the India A versus Pakistan Shaheens match in the Asia Cup Rising Stars tournament.

During the Asia Cup in September, the Indian senior team avoided handshakes with Pakistan’s players in all three matches between the sides, including in the final. There was no handshake at the toss or after the games, and the same approach now appears to have carried into the Rising Stars tournament.The gesture, or lack of it, has again drawn attention to how both teams manage interactions in ICC and ACC events, especially at a time when bilateral cricket between the two countries remains suspended.The Asia Cup tournament had been fraught with tension from the very start, and the animosity carried into the final, which India won by five wickets.What started with India's refusal to shake hands to show solidarity with victims of the Pahalgam terror attack and the armed forces, descended into a full blown mocking match in the summit clash.The presentation ceremony got over an hour late without the champions laying their hands on the trophy as PCB chief and ACC chairperson Naqvi had walked away with it.The tension between the two sides had been palpable throughout the tournament.","India A vs Pakistan Shaheens match began with no handshake after national anthems.

Former India cricketers reacted strongly after the team’s 30-run loss to South Africa at Eden Gardens, a match in which India could not chase 124. The defeat has reopened questions about selections, planning and India’s struggles on turning pitches.Former cricketer Irfan Pathan said India’s ability to play spin has reduced over time.""Skills to play spin on turning tracks around the world have definitely gone down, but this kind of batting from India shows how much our own ability has dropped too. Soft hands, wrist work, all of it has declined drastically,"" Pathan said on X.Wasim Jaffer said India have not corrected mistakes seen in earlier defeats.""Looks like we haven't learned our lesson from NZ (New Zealand) series loss. The gap between our spinners and opposition spinners reduces on pitches like this. We need to go back to classic Indian pitches, like the ones in the 2016-17 season when Virat was captain and Eng and NZ toured,"" Jaffer said on X.Mohammad Kaif said South Africa used the conditions better.""South Africa showed if you bowl well, two spinners are enough to win a Test match in India,"" Kaif remarked.Venkatesh Prasad said the loss shows larger problems in India’s Test plans.""While we have been excellent in white-ball cricket, we can't call ourselves a top Test side with such planning. Selections without clarity and over-tactical thinking are backfiring. Poor results over a year in Tests barring a drawn series in England,"" Prasad said on X.Former Gujarat cricketer Priyank Panchal pointed to repeated errors in India’s approach.""First New Zealand, now this.

India suffered a 30-run defeat against South Africa in the opening Test at Eden Gardens on Sunday, with former cricket legend Anil Kumble criticizing India's decision not to give the first over to lead pacer Jasprit Bumrah on day three, as India failed to chase down a target of 124, getting bowled out for 93.India's challenge began with South Africa at 63 for 7, but their field placement and bowling choices came under scrutiny from Kumble.""A target of 123 was a bit too much. When the day started, South Africa were 63 for 7 and that was the lead. Temba Bavuma was still there. But having spread-out fields and not giving the first over to your best bowler, Jasprit Bumrah, was questionable. All three wickets that fell were to the fast bowlers,"" Kumble said on JioHotstar.Kumble highlighted South African captain Temba Bavuma's leadership, noting his impressive record as captain and recent batting performances.""Overall, India were certainly outdone by South Africa. Credit to Temba Bavuma — he doesn't get the recognition he deserves as a captain. He has won 10 out of 11 Test matches as skipper for South Africa and has won a Test Championship for them. He doesn't get the kind of credit other international captains receive,"" Kumble remarked.He further praised Bavuma's batting prowess, particularly highlighting his performances in the World Test Championship final and the current match.""As a batter, too, he has produced two quality innings, one in the WTC final and one here, literally back-to-back since he wasn't available for Pakistan. He has done exceptionally well both as a player and a skipper,"" he added.Kumble also commended Bavuma's tactical decisions during the match, particularly his bowling changes.""I thought he did really well in bringing on Aiden Markram when there were two left-handers at the crease. Washington Sundar had a good look at Simon Harmer and seemed comfortable. And maybe that one over from Keshav Maharaj, I felt that was where he got the wrong bowler on, because Axar was certainly taking him on,"" Kumble observed.He concluded his analysis by praising Bavuma's overall bowling strategy: ""But he took a gamble that ultimately paid off. It cost South Africa 16 runs, but it paid off. Overall, I thought his usage of bowlers was excellent. He never used Wiaan Mulder at all in the innings. He ensured that the tall Marco Jansen, Corbin Bosch, and the two spinners along with the smart use of Markram were enough.""","India suffered a 30-run defeat against South Africa in the opening Test at Eden Gardens on Sunday.

Updated World Test Championship standings after India vs South Africa first Test







NEW DELHI: Team India batters struggled again against quality spin in home conditions as South Africa beat them by 30 runs in the first Test at Eden Gardens in Kolkata on Sunday, their first win in India in 15 years.India were chasing a modest target of 124 but could not settle or build an innings in the way Proteas captain Temba Bavuma had done earlier in the day. They were bowled out for 93 in 35 overs. Shubman Gill, who was hospitalised with a neck injury, did not come out to bat on day three.The pitch was expected to help Ravindra Jadeja, Axar Patel and Kuldeep Yadav, but it was Simon Harmer who shaped the match. The off-spinner took eight wickets across the two innings and gave South Africa the advantage.This was India’s fourth home defeat in their last six Tests, including a 0-3 loss to New Zealand on spinning tracks last year. The result has reopened the discussion around how Indian batters handle turning surfaces, even at home.After this Test, reigning champions South Africa moved up to second place in the World Test Championship (WTC) standings with 24 points and a PCT of 66.67.

KKR now enters the auction with a substantial purse of Rs 64.3 crores, and Chopra believes Green could be an upgraded version of Russell.KKR's decision to part ways with Russell marks the end of a successful decade-long association that brought the franchise two IPL trophies. Russell, who was previously retained for Rs 12 crore ahead of the 2025 mega auction, was a key player for the team since 2014.""I think one must make an edit of Cameron Green in purple and publish it already. KKR need Cameron Green. They will control the auction now because they have a lot of money. The bowling will not get impacted by (Spencer) Johnson, (Anrich) Nortje, or Russell going away. You have four overs each from Harshit Rana, Vaibhav Arora, Varun Chakravarthy and Sunil Narine. Green would also give you three or four overs. They could also buy more overseas bowlers. Maybe Green could come in as an upgraded version of Russell,"" Chopra said on his YouTube channel.Russell's contributions to KKR have been significant, scoring 2,593 runs in 133 matches at an average of 28.81 and a strike rate exceeding 175.He also claimed 122 wickets at an average of 21.59, including one five-wicket haul and three four-wicket hauls.Green has shown promise in his IPL career, first with Mumbai Indians in 2023, where he scored 452 runs in 16 innings at an average of 50.22 and took six wickets. He was initially purchased by MI for Rs 17.5 crores.His performance continued with Royal Challengers Bangalore in 2024, contributing 255 runs at an average of 31.38 and taking 10 wickets in 13 matches during their playoff campaign.Green's recent T20I form has been impressive, scoring 258 runs in eight innings at an average of 43.00 and maintaining a strike rate above 168. His bowling capabilities have also improved, consistently reaching speeds of 135-140 kilometers per hour.KKR has released several other overseas players, including Moeen Ali, Anrich Nortje, Quinton de Kock, Rahmanullah Gurbaz, and Spencer Johnson. The team also released Venkatesh Iyer due to his recent form concerns.The franchise has retained a core group of players that combines youth and experience, including Ajinkya Rahane, Manish Pandey, Sunil Narine, Varun Chakaravarthy, Rinku Singh, Harshit Rana, and Angkrish Raghuvanshi.The complete list of retained players for KKR includes Ajinkya Rahane, Angkrish Raghuvanshi, Anukul Roy, Harshit Rana, Manish Pandey, Ramandeep Singh, Rinku Singh, Rovman Powell, Sunil Narine, Umran Malik, Vaibhav Arora, and Varun Chakaravarthy.The team currently has 13 available slots to fill, including six positions for overseas players, as they prepare for the upcoming season.","Aakash Chopra believes Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) should pursue Cameron Green in the upcoming Indian Premier League (IPL) 2026 auction.

AHMEDABAD: India’s age-level footballers need to play more competitive games to be able to challenge strong Asian footballing countries like Japan, said U-17 boys’ coach Bibiano Fernandes.“We need competition, and the competition is tough. Games competition improves players. So, a U-19 footballer from Japan plays 600 matches, while a U-19 footballer from India has played only 200 competitive matches. So, if we can cover up those games and get close to where Japanese players are, like at least 500 competitive matches by 19, then we can match in Asia,” Fernandes said ahead of the U-17 AFC Asian Cup qualifiers here next week.The U-17 team is here from Nov 1 as prep for the AFC U-17 Asian Cup qualifiers. Hosts India are clubbed with Iran, Palestine, Lebanon, and Chinese Taipei, and begin against Palestine on Nov 22, before taking on Chinese Taipei on Nov 26.

France have secured their spot in the 2026 World Cup, with Kylian Mbappé leading the charge. Meanwhile, Cristiano Ronaldo faces a potential ban from Portugal's opening match if his team manages to win their European qualifying group.France achieved qualification with a convincing 4-0 victory against Ukraine at home, highlighted by Mbappé's double contribution. Portugal's path hit a roadblock after a surprising 2-0 defeat to Ireland in Dublin, where Ronaldo received his first-ever international red card.The French dominance continued in the second half as Michael Olise and substitute Hugo Ekitiké added to the scoresheet.At Parc des Princes in Paris, Mbappé opened the scoring with a penalty in the 55th minute. Olise extended the lead with a curling shot in the 76th minute, followed by Mbappé's close-range finish in the 83rd. This brought Mbappé's international goal tally to 55, just two behind Olivier Giroud's national record.""The French national team will always be better with him in it. He makes things easier for us. He performed his role perfectly this evening, as both a player and the captain of the national team,"" said coach Didier Deschamps about Mbappé.Mbappé nearly completed his hat-trick but missed a clear opportunity shortly after his second goal.France lead Group D with 13 points, while Ukraine and Iceland share seven points each, setting up a crucial match for second place on Sunday.Portugal's situation became complicated when Ronaldo received a red card for elbowing Ireland's Dara O'Shea after an hour of play. The initial yellow card was upgraded to red following a video review.""I thought it was a bit harsh. He has never been sent off before in 226 games,"" Portugal coach Roberto Martinez commented on the incident.Ronaldo will miss Portugal's match against Armenia due to the mandatory one-game suspension.

Amid the ongoing turmoil in Indian football, Union Sports Minister Mansukh Mandaviya met representatives of I-League clubs in New Delhi on Thursday to discuss their concerns and explore possible solutions to the escalating standoff between the All India Football Federation (AIFF), the Indian Super League (ISL), and I-League teams.The meeting, attended by seven representatives from among the 14 I-League clubs, was also joined by Sports Secretary and SAI Director General Hari Ranjan Rao and Joint Secretary Kunal. According to a senior official present, Mandaviya “gave a patient hearing to the I-League representatives” and urged the Sports Authority of India to mediate discussions going forward for the time being.“The minister gave a patient hearing to the I-League representatives and for the time being instructed SAI to step in and engage with the stakeholders. He wants a constructive dialogue between officials of the AIFF, the Indian Super League (ISL) and I-League,” a source told PTI.The intervention from the ministry comes a day after I-League clubs boycotted a meeting convened by the AIFF to address the deepening crisis triggered by the federation’s inability to secure a new commercial partner.The fallout of the AIFF’s failed renewal with Football Sports Development Limited (FSDL), which had managed the ISL and related commercial activities, has left domestic football in uncertainty.With the partnership collapsing ahead of its December expiry, the 2025–26 ISL season remains on hold, and top I-League clubs, including defending champions Mohun Bagan, have suspended training sessions.The I-League clubs have demanded that all tiers of Indian football, namely the ISL, I-League, and I-League 2 be managed under a single commercial framework to ensure parity and stability.The AIFF’s search for a new partner is being monitored by the Supreme Court, which approved a revised constitution for the federation in October.The ministry is expected to facilitate further discussions between the AIFF, ISL and I-League representatives in the coming days to help break the deadlock.","Union Sports Minister Mansukh Mandaviya met representatives of I-League clubs in New Delhi on Thursday.

Poll Should Oscar consider retiring to prioritize his health? Yes, absolutely No, he should continue playing if possible





Former Chelsea and Brazil midfielder Oscar was taken to hospital after suffering a heart-related issue during a pre-season training session with São Paulo. The club confirmed that the 34-year-old is in stable condition and under medical observation.According to reports in Brazil, the incident occurred during fitness tests on an exercise bike when Oscar collapsed and briefly lost consciousness. He was attended to immediately by medical staff before being transported to hospital in an ambulance.São Paulo released an official statement confirming the episode and the player’s current status. “During tests carried out on Tuesday morning, at SuperCT, as part of pre-season preparation, athlete Oscar presented a complication with cardiac changes, and was promptly treated by the club's professionals and the medical team from Einstein Hospital Israelita, who were present at the scene,” the club said.It further added: “The player was then taken to the hospital, where he is clinically stable and remains under observation for further tests to clarify the diagnosis.”Oscar, who returned to his boyhood club São Paulo on a free transfer last December, has a contract with the team until 2027. He had spent several years playing in China before his return to Brazil.The midfielder was a key figure at Chelsea between 2012 and 2017, winning two Premier League titles and a Europa League crown during his time in England.He left the London club midway through the 2016–17 season to join Shanghai for a reported $73 million fee, becoming one of the highest-paid players in the Chinese Super League.Oscar also represented Brazil at the 2014 FIFA World Cup, playing alongside Neymar Jr, scoring the team’s only goal in the 7–1 semifinal thrashing to eventual champions Germany.Further medical updates on his condition are expected as São Paulo continue to monitor the midfielder closely.There are also reports that the player is considering retirement after his condition came to light. In 2021, Argentina's Sergio Aguero called time on his career after heart related issues after joining Barcelona on a free transfer from Manchester City.","Oscar was taken to hospital after suffering a heart-related issue during a pre- season training session with São Paulo.

Portuguese superstar Cristiano Ronaldo has urged Ireland fans to boo him when Portugal take the field in Thursday’s World Cup qualifier in Dublin. Speaking at a press conference on Wednesday, the 40-year-old said he hoped the home supporters’ focus on him might ease the pressure on his teammates as Portugal look to secure qualification for the 2026 World Cup.“The stadium will boo me, I’m used to it, I certainly hope they do — maybe it will take the pressure off other players,” Ronaldo told reporters in Dublin. Portugal sit five points clear at the top of Group F with two games left, and a win over Ireland would seal their spot in next year’s World Cup. Ronaldo, who is aiming to feature in his sixth edition of the tournament, said he expects a tough contest against an Irish side that will likely defend deep.“It will be a difficult match,” he said. “Ireland will sit back and make it hard for us to find space.”The Al Nassr forward was also asked about the possibility of scoring his 1000th career goal in the World Cup final, which he dismissed with a laugh. “You’ve been watching too many movies, that would be too perfect,” Ronaldo joked. “It’s always good to score goals — that’s my job. I want to play in this next World Cup, otherwise I wouldn’t be here, but let’s take it step by step.”Ronaldo has scored 953 career goals and holds the record for the most goals in men’s international football with 143. While he hinted earlier this week that the 2026 World Cup could be his last, Ronaldo chose not to dwell on his future this time.“There’s no point in being repetitive and losing focus,” he said. “Maybe later I’ll speak more clearly about what I think for the future, but right now, the goal is qualification.”","Cristiano Ronaldo has urged Ireland fans to boo him when Portugal take the field in Thursday's World Cup qualifier in Dublin.

It was a busy day at the Football House in New Delhi as the All India Football Federation (AIFF) convened back-to-back meetings with multiple stakeholders in order to address the current predicament facing Indian football.AIFF called for interactions on short notice with Executive Committee members, Indian Super League (ISL) captains, club CEOs and I-League owners on Wednesday (November 12). ISL clubs and captains - except that of Mohun Bagan Super Giant and East Bengal - explored the possibility of putting in all their resources to make the top-tier tournament happen.Eight I-League clubs, meanwhile, stayed away from the meeting and are due to meet Sports Minister Mansukh Mandaviya on Thursday.“Keeping in mind the fundamental importance of a multi- tier league National structure for the development of the football in the country (Tier 1-2-3), we suggest that all the three leagues in this case ISL, I League and I League-2 should be managed by one common league partner.

For the four teams that remain in the AIFF Super Cup, it is going to be business as usual - for now.East Bengal, Punjab FC, FC Goa and Mumbai City FC will play their AIFF Super Cup semi-finals on December 4 and 5 with the final on December 7. All matches will be played at the Fatorda Stadium in Goa.Sources within Punjab FC and Mumbai City FC have confirmed tothat the players have been given an extended break since their last encounter. Mumbai City FC last played on November 6 against Kerala Blasters and Punjab FC's last fixture came against Bengaluru FC on November 5.A Punjab FC insider revealed the players are due to report back for training on November 14.

Before the AIFF Super Cup semi-final, they will take on Iraq's Al Zawraa SC in the AFC Champions League Two on November 26.So, they will focus on the continental tournament ""independent of what is happening in Indian football.""Beyond the three teams that have stopped operations, Chennaiyin FC have told their players they're unsure of when the training will resume; NorthEast United have given players an extended break and Odisha FC are yet to get their pre-season underway.The period of uncertainty has been brought on since AIFF's tender to sell the commercial rights of the Indian Super League (ISL) found no bidders. The deadline to bid for the rights came once (November 5) and then again but eventually saw no interest by 5 pm on November 7.On Sunday, the bid evaluation committee comprising AIFF president Kalyan Chaubey, former SC Justice L.

When the football federation put the tender publicly, four bidders showed initial interest, before pulling out as request for proposal (RFP) wasn't considered to be ""commercially viable.""Meanwhile, with the season in serious threat and their livelihoods on the line, the players came together as one.“To put it simply,” said the players in a statement that was later shared on social media, “we want to play, and now.”“This is a plea to all those involved in running our sport in the country, to do whatever it takes to get the football season underway,” the statement read.“India needs its competitive football now more than ever.

Jacoby Brissett’s record day meant nothing to him and everything about the Cardinals’ direction

The 49ers controlled everything while Kyle Shanahan praised Brissett’s toughness





The Arizona Cardinals found a new way to lose on Sunday, and Jacoby Brissett ended up holding an NFL record he wanted nothing to do with. The veteran quarterback completed 47 passes in a 41-22 loss to the San Francisco 49ers, setting a new single-game regular-season completions record while Arizona fell to 3-7 and unraveled under 17 penalties.Brissett threw for a career-high 452 yards, but his reaction said everything about the state of the team. “Man, I’ll throw for three yards and win right now,” he said. The Cardinals have dropped four of his five starts since Kyler Murray’s foot injury, and the numbers stopped mattering the moment the scoreboard tilted out of reach.Brissett set the new NFL mark with 47 completions, passing Drew Bledsoe’s 45 from 1994 and Jared Goff’s 45 in 2019. His performance powered massive days for Michael Wilson, who caught 15 passes for 185 yards, and Trey McBride, who added 115 yards and a touchdown.None of it translated to anything meaningful. Arizona played from behind almost instantly after San Francisco returned the opening kickoff to the 1 and scored on the next snap. The Cardinals followed it with repeated mistakes, including a franchise-record 17 penalties.For a team that talked all week about playing clean football, it was another step backward.Even Jonathan Gannon knew his quarterback would not care about the milestone. The head coach said he did not expect Brissett to be thrilled, and he was right. “I promise you man, I can care less about that part of it,” Brissett said. “Man, I hope somebody breaks it tomorrow or whenever. I mean, I just want to win.”Brissett has averaged 314 passing yards across his five starts, but the Cardinals have nothing to show for it except his name in the record book. He said the 3-7 team still “have the opportunity to wake up,” but Arizona is running out of time.The 49ers barely broke a sweat. Brock Purdy returned from a toe injury and threw three touchdown passes while Christian McCaffrey scored three times and extended his own NFL history streak with a game featuring a rushing and receiving touchdown. The 49ers jumped to a 25-10 halftime lead and never lost control.San Francisco head coach Kyle Shanahan learned about Brissett’s record only after the game but said the performance matched what he saw in real time. “I’ve got a lot of respect for Jacoby every time we played him,” Shanahan said. “He made a few of those big throws down the field where we were hitting him as he let it go and he hung in there. Real tough player and I got a lot of respect for him.”The Cardinals did not give themselves much of a chance. A long Bam Knight touchdown was wiped out by a holding penalty, Eddy Piñeiro hit a 47-yard field goal only after Arizona gifted him a second attempt, and key injuries struck throughout the afternoon. Brissett was again forced to carry an offense missing Marvin Harrison Jr., who was inactive after appendicitis surgery earlier in the week.Arizona now hosts Jacksonville next Sunday, and Brissett will have another chance to lead an offense that keeps putting up numbers without winning games. The record will follow him, but it is not the one he wanted.",Jacoby Brissett completed 47 passes in a 41-22 loss to the San Francisco 49ers. The veteran quarterback set a new single-game regular-season completions record. Arizona fell to 3-7 and unraveled under a franchise-record 17 penalties.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125375032,imgsize-45100,width-400,resizemode-4/cardinals-meltdown-jacoby-brissett-nfl-record-49ers-loss.jpg"

Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Aaron Rodgers injury update brings mixed early news



More NFL coverage





Pittsburgh felt the tension rise the moment Aaron Rodgers hit the ground against the Cincinnati Bengals. The veteran quarterback went down in the second quarter when several defenders closed in on him, sending him hard to the turf on his left wrist. Moments later, he entered the blue medical tent, and the Steelers announced he was questionable to return. By halftime, that hope faded. Mason Rudolph stepped in, and Rodgers was ruled out for the rest of the game.As the team celebrated a 34-12 win, attention quickly shifted to the injury. Early scans brought a mix of relief and concern. The problem is real, but the situation does not look long-term. The Steelers now wait for Monday’s testing to know exactly what they face.Initial X-rays revealed a small fracture in Rodgers’ left, non-throwing wrist, which explains the pain that forced him out. NFL insider Tom Pelissero reported, ""Steelers QB Aaron Rodgers will undergo more tests Monday on his left wrist, but the initial belief is it’s nothing long term, sources tell me and @RapSheet. X-rays at the stadium showed a small fracture. They won’t know more until further scans."" The team hopes the follow-up evaluation will confirm that the fracture is minor and manageable.ESPN added that Rodgers may be dealing with ""a slight break"" and that Mason Rudolph is expected to start in Week 12 against the Bears. Adam Schefter noted that Monday’s tests will help build a clear recovery timetable. Rodgers is said to be optimistic, and insiders Ian Rapoport and Pelissero echoed that he does not expect an extended absence.Still, his long-awaited return to Soldier Field now looks doubtful. The fracture could keep him sidelined when the Steelers travel to Chicago on Nov. 23. It would mean Bears fans miss a familiar face who dominated their team for years. Rodgers went 25-5 against them and delivered one of the most memorable moments in the rivalry when he shouted, “All my [bleeping] life, I own you. I own you. I still own you.”His future also hangs in the balance. Rodgers, 41, has said he is “pretty sure” this will be his last season. He chose Pittsburgh partly because the schedule offered another trip to Chicago. “I love Chicago, though — way more than they love me,” he said in May. “It’s been a great relationship — all one way.”For now, the Steelers wait, the division tightens, and Rudolph prepares to lead until Rodgers can return.","Aaron Rodgers went down in the second quarter against the Cincinnati Bengals.

Andy Reid has firmly established himself as a veteran NFL coach who has guided many teams to victory, but the person who has stood with him the longest is his wife, Tammy. Her presence has shaped much of his personal life and career. Long before Kansas City celebrated championships under his leadership, the couple built a bond rooted in friendship, shared faith and quiet resilience. Their story is not only about football, but about two people choosing each other every day through wins, losses, grief and growth. As Tammy once said, their relationship works because they move through life as a team, always trusting the other.Their partnership began long before Andy held a play sheet on the sidelines. They met at Brigham Young University, living the normal, chaotic rhythm of college life. Neither imagined they would eventually build a family that spanned five children, several states and a demanding coaching career. Yet as the years unfolded, Tammy became the steady voice behind one of the NFL’s most successful coaches, offering encouragement whether things looked bright or bleak.Tammy Reid was born on November 6, 1959, and spent her childhood between New York, Memphis and Arizona.She later returned to her alma mater, Brigham Young University, as a physics professor. Beyond academics, she has spent years supporting Laurel House, an anti-domestic violence organization she feels deeply connected to. “I knew that Laurel House was something I could pour my heart into because I am married to one of the greatest men in the world,” she said about her work.Her admiration for Andy is something she expresses openly. She once told The Times Herald, “Andrew’s my best friend and we make a great team. I wish every woman could have the kind of loving, supportive relationship we have.” She has also stood behind him during the toughest stretches of coaching life, adding, “Maybe people don’t know this about me but I’m a very positive person and I have the ultimate trust in Andrew as a coach. No matter how bleak it looks, I always believe Andrew and his guys will figure out a way to do it.”Their first meeting at BYU came during a Fundamentals of Tennis class. Tammy noticed Andy’s confidence, though he refused to ask her out. She later laughed about how she pushed him to finally make a move. “He had this air about him, this confidence…but he wouldn’t ask me out,” she remembered. Their first date came after a competitive streak of tennis, badminton and racquetball. “Even though I’m really good, he killed me,” she admitted.The couple married on August 8, 1981, and went on to welcome five children. Their journey has included heartbreak. Their eldest son Garrett died of a heroin overdose in 2012. Andy shared at the time, “Words cannot express our sense of loss.” The family leaned on faith, football and each other to move forward.Today, as Andy continues leading the Kansas City Chiefs, Tammy remains the quiet anchor beside him. He still calls her his girlfriend, reminding everyone that love, like football, thrives when nurtured daily.","Tammy Reid is the wife of Kansas City Chiefs coach Andy Reid.

The AFC North produces tempers that run hot, and that was clear again in the Steelers’ 34-12 win over the Bengals. The rivalry has always had sharp edges, but the clash between Jalen Ramsey and Ja'Marr Chase pushed things into a place neither fanbase expected. What unfolded late in the fourth quarter moved beyond the standard shoving and shouting that comes with divisional football. It sparked claims, denials, and video evidence that is now under league review.Ramsey spent the final minutes of the game outside the action after he was ejected for throwing a punch at Chase. The two had been locked in tight coverage all afternoon, grabbing and jawing until it boiled over. When asked what triggered the final explosion, Ramsey said Chase crossed a hard line. ""He spit on me, so it's up,"" Ramsey said. ""I don't give a f--- about football after that, respectfully."" Chase fired back with an immediate denial, telling reporters, ""I ain't never opened my mouth to that guy. ""Chase hinted that the tension came from their trash talk more than anything else. ""He [didn't] like some of the swears I told him,"" he said. ""We'd been going back and forth the whole time so, I'm sure something got under his skin.""Their latest confrontation ended with unsportsmanlike penalties on both sides, but Ramsey’s punch pushed officials to eject him with 13:28 left in the game.After the dust settled, Ramsey explained that this wasn’t the first warning. ""He snatched my mouthpiece off my facemask, and that's when I pushed his facemask... that was just a little scuffle,"" he said. ""But the refs told us right there like, 'Aye y'all, chill, no more of this'... as soon as he spit, it was [expletive] that."" A video from FOX 19’s Austin Briski surfaced after the game, appearing to support Ramsey’s allegation.Chase continued to deny the accusation. ""I didn't spit on nobody,"" he said. Still, the league plans to review the video and all related reports. If the investigation confirms Ramsey’s claim, Chase could face a suspension. Similar incidents have resulted in discipline before, including Jalen Carter’s ejection in Week 1 for spitting at Dak Prescott. Ramsey may also face consequences, as Da'Ron Payne received a suspension earlier this season for punching Amon-Ra St. Brown.The teams have already split their season series, but neither player is likely to let this moment fade. If the Steelers and Bengals cross paths again in the playoffs, this chapter will not be forgotten.","Jalen Ramsey claims Ja'Marr Chase spit at him before throwing a punch on national TV.

The Kansas City Chiefs stepped back onto the field after their bye week with one goal in mind: grab a much-needed win against the Denver Broncos. The stakes were high, the pressure was real, and alongside the team came a familiar presence who always draws attention. Gracie Hunt returned to the sidelines with another look that instantly became part of the game-day conversation. Fans have come to expect her vibrant energy, and on Sunday, she delivered again.The 26-year-old daughter of owner Clark Hunt and Tavia Hunt has a reputation for bringing style to every stadium she walks into. Last season, her gold dress became the only bright spot during the tough Super Bowl loss to the Philadelphia Eagles. This year, she has continued that streak of standout appearances with pieces that spark reactions across social media, from her bold red dress to her sleek, all-Chiefs look during the loss to the Buffalo Bills.This weekend felt no different. After spending the bye week unwinding in Hawaii, where she visited her sister Ava Hunt, Gracie shared moments of the tropical escape, including photos of her enjoying the sun in her bikini.It was a brief break before getting back to the intensity of NFL Sundays. Ava’s absence from games this season has been noticeable, so the sisters’ time together made the trip even more meaningful.When Gracie arrived at Mile High Stadium, she stepped onto the sidelines wearing a custom Chiefs “Hunt” coat that fit the moment perfectly. It was bold, personal and unmistakably Chiefs. She wore it with confidence before kickoff, hoping it might be the spark the 5-4 team needed as they faced the 8-2 Broncos in a divisional showdown.Gracie hopes it’s a lucky fit as the Chiefs look to regain momentum. The three-time defending AFC champions understand the road ahead is long, but fans know one thing each week.

Shedeur Sanders finally had the moment his family, teammates and a restless Cleveland fan base had been waiting for. The Cleveland Browns’ fifth-round rookie quarterback spent most of the season watching from the sidelines, a surprising role for a player who entered the NFL with enormous expectations and the reputation of a record-setting college star. But when Dillon Gabriel was ruled out at halftime with a concussion during Sunday’s home game against the Baltimore Ravens, Sanders stepped onto the field and instantly shifted the energy inside the stadium.His path to this point has been anything but smooth. Sanders arrived in Cleveland after a dominant run at Jackson State and Colorado, where he set the FBS record for career completion percentage at 71.4 percent. His 2024 season with 4,134 passing yards and 37 touchdowns made him one of the most decorated players in the country, the type of quarterback many expected to go in the early rounds. Instead, he shockingly slid to the fifth, giving the Browns an unexpected chance to take a gamble on a future franchise hope.Before his debut, Sanders had appeared only in preseason action, completing 14 of 23 passes for 138 yards in his first outing against the Panthers on August 8.An oblique injury kept him out of the next game, and although he returned against the Rams on August 23, the night turned rough as he went 3 of 6 for 14 yards and took five sacks. A back issue after that further limited his practice time, slowing his progress toward regular-season snaps.Through it all, no one waited more eagerly than his mom, Pilar Sanders. She spent every week hoping her son would get his chance. On Sunday, she finally saw it unfold right in front of her. As soon as he jogged onto the field, she posted her immediate reaction, shouting, “He’s in! He’s in.” Moments later, she filmed his first completion while cheering, “toss that sucker.”Pilar, known for her bold custom “12” outfits and for sitting with her son Shilo at games, stayed loyal even while Shedeur rode the bench. She was there on draft day too, joining Deion Sanders, Shilo, and Shelomi for a rare family photo after Cleveland selected him.Now that Shedeur has finally taken his first NFL snaps, the question shifts to what comes next. Whether he starts next week against the Las Vegas Raiders is still uncertain, but Sunday offered a glimpse of the quarterback Browns fans have been waiting to see.","Shedeur Sanders makes long-awaited Browns debut as mom Pilar celebrates wildly in the crowd at Ravens game.

For a couple known for living at a pace few people can imagine, Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift have managed to protect one part of their day that belongs only to them. Their schedules move from stadiums to studios with little room to slow down, yet they still carve out a quiet ritual that shapes their bond. A report from Us Weekly says the two always start their mornings with coffee together. It seems like a small moment, but for them it has become an anchor. The calm at the start of the day helps them stay close while the rest of their lives demand constant attention.This simple habit also gives fans a different look at their relationship. People often see the travel, the bright lights and the pressure that surrounds them. What they rarely see is how they stay grounded. Kelce is locked into a crucial season with the Kansas City Chiefs while Swift spent last year completing her Eras Tour before releasing her album ""The Life of a Showgirl."" Between rehearsals, practices and crossing time zones, their mornings carry more weight than many realize. A source told Us Weekly that despite everything around them, their morning coffee is something they never miss.Their routine grows beyond that first cup. The report says they also meet friends every Sunday after Chiefs games for small gatherings that keep them connected to normal life. After Kansas City’s win on Oct. 19, they celebrated at Kelce’s new steakhouse 1587 Prime, which he co-owns with Patrick Mahomes. Swift has been present at several home games this season, although she has tried to stay more private as the attention around her often becomes overwhelming.Even with the noise around them, their evenings at home remain slow and steady. They cook, talk, watch their favorite shows and enjoy whatever time they get together. It shows that behind the headlines are two people choosing a steady path.Their engagement has added new excitement. Kelce proposed in their backyard in August, and they hope to marry next summer. Rhode Island has surfaced as a possible location, though nothing is confirmed. They are also thinking about a family and a long-term home.

More coverage from NFL:





Young Thug’s chaotic “I just put a baby in her” moment at the GQ Men of the Year event didn’t just send social media into meltdown, it also brought Joy Taylor’s name back into the chat. After Complex posted the clip confirming that Thug’s girlfriend, Mariah the Scientist, is pregnant, Joy reposted it with a playful jab at critics who questioned her earlier rant about motherhood.On Instagram, Joy reshared the news and wrote: “What were y’all sayin about my rant this week? 😂” It was her way of letting people know she meant every word she said on her podcast the day before and she isn’t backing off her stance just because a viral pregnancy clip hit the timeline.On herpodcast, Joy explained that people constantly assume she wants to be a mother, even though she’s made it extremely clear that she doesn’t. She said she’s tired of hearing that she’d make a “good baby mama,” telling listeners:She also went deeper into why she feels this way. Joy said men often hit her with what she calls “breeding kinks,” making uncomfortable comments about wanting her to have their child or give them a son to “continue their legacy.”She described these remarks as boundary-crossing and “very weird.”Joy didn’t just talk about baby mama stereotypes, she expanded on her stance. She said that even if someone approached her with a traditional mindset, like:it still wouldn’t change her mind about motherhood.She emphasized that raising a child is a bigger lifelong commitment than marriage, and she believes many men focus only on getting someone pregnant while expecting women to handle the rest.Young Thug’s wild, unfiltered line, “Of course, I just put a baby in her” instantly dominated social media. Because the Internet connects everything, his pregnancy confirmation naturally brought up Joy Taylor’s rant about motherhood, boundaries, and reproductive pressure.Even though Joy had already spoken her mind before Thug went viral, the timing made the two topics collide, and fans quickly linked her comments to the cultural moment.While some people agreed with her take and praised her for being blunt about her choice, others debated whether she was reading too much into things. Still, Joy didn’t argue, clap back, or explain further, she simply reshared the clip with a laugh and stood firm in her message.","Young Thug’s “I just put a baby in her” moment at the GQ Men of the Year event brought up Joy Taylor's comments about motherhood, boundaries, and reproductive pressure.

Chris Rodriguez opening games and getting early snaps shows the coaching staff’s trust

Croskey-Merritt’s mid-season dip opened the door for Rodriguez to take on a bigger role

More coverage from NFL:







If you’ve been following the Commanders this season, you already know their running back rotation has been chaos. One week it feels like a committee, the next week somebody gets hot, and the snaps get shuffled all over again. But lately, Washington has made its backfield preference pretty obvious and Chris Rodriguez Jr. has quietly moved into the lead-back role over Jacory Croskey-Merritt.In the team’s recent matchup in Madrid, Chris Rodriguez didn’t just rotate in, he got the first few carries and early snaps, which usually tells you exactly where the coaching staff’s trust sits. When a team wants to set a tone, they start the guy they believe won’t mess up the rhythm of the offense.One thing that immediately stands out is that Rodriguez was named an offensive captain before Week 10. That’s a big deal for a young running back, and it shows how much trust he’s earned inside the building. Captains don’t get that patch unless coaches and teammates see you as someone they can lean on in tight games, high-pressure drives, and messy downs.Jacory Croskey-Merritt has had big flashes this year, but the middle stretch of the season wasn’t his strongest.His efficiency dipped, and that’s exactly when Rodriguez started gaining momentum.In Week 10, Croskey-Merritt actually out-carried him 11–6, but that came in the middle of a blowout where the rotation was looser. Even in that game, Rodriguez’s presence in early snaps and key situations said more than the raw carry count.The coaching staff clearly views him as the steadier all-around option right now.The Commanders are leaning into a three-man committee with Rodriguez, Croskey-Merritt, and Jeremy McNichols all getting work. But even in a committee, there’s always a “first in line,” and that’s been Rodriguez for Weeks 10 and 11.Croskey-Merritt isn’t hurt, and nothing behind the scenes suggests anything other than performance and role. This is simply the staff rewarding the back who’s doing the most consistent work.Dan Quinn has repeatedly spoken highly of Rodriguez, his toughness, his consistency, and his ability to do everything the job requires. And in the NFL , when a coach keeps praising the same guy, that usually tells you exactly how the rotation is trending.Right now, Rodriguez is the Commanders’ “trust back.” Croskey-Merritt still has a role and still has big-play juice but the coaching staff keeps leaning on Rodriguez because he brings stability at a time when Washington needs it most.","Chris Rodriguez Jr. has quietly moved into the lead-back role for the Washington Commanders.

Kevin Byard’s interception puts more pressure on JJ McCarthy





Minnesota Vikings quarterback JJ McCarthy walked onto the field in Week 11 with a wrap on his right throwing hand, and this worried many people right away. His right hand is the hand he uses to throw the ball, so even a small injury can cause big trouble for the team. The wrap was there because JJ McCarthy bruised his hand in the Week 10 game against the Baltimore Ravens, where the Vikings lost 27–19. Bears insider Brad Biggs said on X that the bruise came from last week’s game and that fans would see close shots of his hand on TV.He also said JJ McCarthy is already completing only 53.7% of his passes this season, and a hurt hand makes things harder. McCarthy had a tough Week 10, with one touchdown, two interceptions, and only 20 completions out of 42 throws. Now the wrap brings more questions before the game against the Chicago Bears.In the third quarter of the Week 11 game, Kevin Byard made things worse for JJ McCarthy. On a play-action pass, McCarthy stepped up in the pocket but threw the ball high.Kevin Byard was right there to catch it near the Minnesota 30-yard line. He then ran the ball back and was stopped inside the 20. This big play gave the Chicago Bears great field position and changed the energy of the whole game.This interception was also special for Kevin Byard because it was his fifth interception of the 2025 season, which made him the league leader at that moment.It also added to his career total of 33 interceptions, the most by any active NFL player since he entered the league in 2016. His strong play showed how dangerous the Bears’ defense can be, especially when the quarterback is already hurt.JJ McCarthy’s bruise came from the Week 10 loss to the Baltimore Ravens. Reports said he bruised his hand during a play when his hand hit a helmet. In that same game, he passed for 248 yards, threw one touchdown, two interceptions, and rushed for 48 yards.He was sacked only once, but the two interceptions changed the momentum. The Vikings also had eight false-start penalties, which made things even harder for the rookie quarterback.Also Read: NFL Player Kris Boyd Health Update: Jets Cornerback Shot In Manhattan And Remains In Critical Care After Sudden Street Attack Now, with his right hand wrapped, every throw becomes more stressful. A bruise may sound small, but for a quarterback, it affects grip, power, and control. The Vikings hope the wrap will give support without slowing him down, but fans will keep watching closely to see if the injury limits his play in any way.","Minnesota Vikings quarterback JJ McCarthy walked onto the field in Week 11 with a wrap on his right throwing hand.

I answered and his response was ‘I wouldn’t pick anything crazy, I just really loved my mom’s car she had when I was a kid. ’ So I went on a mission these past months to find the car, shipped it across the country, got it fixed up and was able to surprise him with it today for his 30th!""She paired the post with photos of Towns as a child sitting in the original car, along with a reaction video that instantly went viral. In the clip, a stunned Towns says, ""This is so fire, this is the best thing ever."" The car, restored to match his mother’s model, triggered an overwhelming wave of fan reactions. Olympic gymnast Suni Lee commented with crying emojis.The celebration continued with Knicks teammates Josh Hart and Mikal Bridges joining a small gathering, complete with a trading card–themed cake crafted by a New York Black-owned bakery.

Jimmy Butler approached by an upset bettor showing a three thousand dollar parlay slip





What happened with Jimmy Butler outside the Smoothie King Center is exactly what Adam Silver has been warning about. Not a flare up between rivals, not a heated moment after a loss, but a fan melting down because his three thousand dollar parlay needed thirty points. Butler scored twenty two in a win, played efficiently, and moved on with his night. The fan didn’t. He treated Butler like a broken investment, yelling from a car window as if a player’s job is to satisfy a bet slip instead of helping his team win.That mindset is the new danger creeping into the game. Fans who gamble now feel personally wronged when a prop misses, as if players owe them something beyond their performance. Butler handled the confrontation with total control, which only highlights the imbalance in the moment. The fan lost a wager he voluntarily placed, then acted like Butler caused him harm. This is what happens when betting culture grows faster than the understanding that risk is part of the deal. And the Butler incident is a loud reminder of how messy that can get.The confrontation unfolded shortly after the Warriors' win at the Smoothie King Center.Butler, dressed in lime-green sweats, Timberlands boots, AirPods, and carrying an iced coffee, was strolling near the arena with a clear ""don't bother me"" vibe. A white sedan suddenly screeched to the curb, and the driver was an unidentified bettor, he leaned out, phone in hand, already in full meltdown mode.The fan wasted no time escalating, yelling directly at Butler while flashing his betting slip on his phone. The car pulled up abruptly, and the fan leaned out roasting Butler's outfit, shouting, ""Green apple looking a**"" while Butler glanced over the mid-sip of his coffee and continued walking.The fan then escalated, displaying his bet, ""I put 3,000 and needed 30!"" referring to a $3,000 parlay wager that hinged on Butler scoring over 30 points, as Butler slowed his pace and removed one AirPod.More frustration poured out, ""Why you ain’t have 30 points? You were supposed to go over!"" with Butler stepping closer to the car, maintaining a neutral expression, and muttering a short response—lip-readers debating it as either ""Chill, man"" or a variation of ""relax,"" delivered in a low, calm tone.The fan went full conspiracy mode, repeating on loop, ""You work for Vegas! You work for Vegas!""accusing Butler of rigging the game for betting houses, prompting Butler's face to tighten briefly before he flicked a dismissive wave, replaced his AirPod, and walked away as Warriors team security arrived on the scene.No physical contact occurred, no doors were slammed, and no police report was filed, per reports from the incident. The entire episode lasted under half a minute, but it quickly exploded online, amassing millions of views across platforms.Also Read: Luka Doncic and Anamaria Goltes confirm baby No. 2 is close as she posts her hospital bag is packed and ready","Butler handled the confrontation with total control, which only highlights the imbalance in the moment.

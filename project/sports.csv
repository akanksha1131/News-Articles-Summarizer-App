Bangladesh seek T20 WC match shift from India after Mustafizur Rahman's IPL exit

Poll What do you think about the Bangladesh Cricket Board's response to the crisis? They handled it well They should have acted sooner Their actions were inadequate

NEW DELHI: Bangladesh’s cricketers are set to return to action in the ongoing Bangladesh Premier League (BPL) 2025–26 after a turbulent day that saw players boycott matches, force administrative action from the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB), and ultimately accept a public apology from controversial director Najmul Islam.The standoff ended late Thursday following a tripartite meeting involving the BCB and the Cricketers’ Welfare Association of Bangladesh (CWAB), with players agreeing to resume participation from Friday after Najmul was stripped of his role as chairman of the board’s finance committee and issued a public apology for his remarks.The crisis erupted after Najmul made a series of incendiary comments earlier in the week. He labelled former Bangladesh captain Tamim Iqbal an “Indian agent” for suggesting dialogue between the two cricket boards to resolve the T20 World Cup venue deadlock triggered by Kolkata Knight Riders releasing Mustafizur Rahman from IPL 2026 on BCCI instructions. Najmul further inflamed tensions by suggesting that the BCB owed players no compensation if they missed the T20 World Cup, pointing to the team’s failure to win major trophies.The remarks drew sharp condemnation from players, who announced a boycott of all forms of cricket and demanded Najmul’s removal from the board. The protest forced the postponement of the scheduled BPL match between Noakhali Express and Chattogram Royals at the Sher-e-Bangla National Cricket Stadium.CWAB president Mohammad Mithun said the players had been left with no choice. “We will only play after they meet our demands. Everything has a limit. He has crossed everything. I didn’t find any respect for cricket from his words,” Mithun told reporters in Dhaka. “We don’t think he should remain in this position. As a cricket board director, what does he want to do?”Under mounting pressure, the BCB announced on Thursday that Najmul had been relieved of his responsibilities as finance committee chairman with immediate effect, citing the need to protect the smooth functioning of the board. Aminul Islam has been appointed as his replacement, while the BCB president will act as interim chairman of the committee.In a statement, the board stressed that “the interests of the cricketers remain its highest priority” and urged players to continue showing professionalism and dedication during a challenging period.The breakthrough came after Najmul issued a public apology, which CWAB agreed to accept. “We welcome the decision to remove Mr. Najmul Islam from the Finance Committee,” Mithun said. “Since he has publicly apologised and the formal process regarding his directorship is ongoing, we are ready to return to the field and resume playing.”As a result, the BPL will resume with revised dates, drawing a line under a dramatic 24 hours that brought Bangladesh cricket to a standstill before an uneasy truce restored order.","Bangladesh's cricketers are set to return to action in the ongoing Bangladesh Premier League (BPL) 2025–26 after a turbulent day.

Bangladesh seek T20 WC match shift from India after Mustafizur Rahman's IPL exit

NEW DELHI: The Cricketers’ Welfare Association of Bangladesh (CWAB) said on Thursday that players are prepared to return to cricket if Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) director M Najmul Islam issues a public apology and the process related to his removal from directorship of the board moves forward.""We have informed the BCB that if he apologises publicly and the process regarding his directorship continues, we will be ready to return to cricket from Friday,"" CWAB said in a press release.The players also said they had reviewed their earlier decision to boycott all forms of cricket, citing broader concerns for the game in the country.""We are continuing discussions among ourselves regarding the ongoing complications in Bangladesh cricket. Through our discussions, we, the cricketers, have realised that our women’s national team are currently playing in the World Cup qualifiers in Nepal, the men’s national team have the T20 World Cup ahead of them, and the men’s Under-19 team are currently taking part in the World Cup. The impact of suspending all forms of cricket could affect all these teams,"" CWAB said.""We also consider the Bangladesh Premier League (BPL) to be extremely important.Therefore, in the greater interest of cricket, we have reconsidered our earlier decision,"" the statement added.The development came hours after the BCB removed Najmul from his role as chairman of the board’s finance committee. He, however, continues as a board director, a position that can only be withdrawn through disciplinary action.""...Following a review of recent developments and in the best interest of the organisation, the BCB President has decided to release Mr. Najmul Islam from his responsibilities as Chairman of the Finance Committee with immediate effect,"" the BCB said in a statement.""Until further notice, the BCB President will assume the role of Acting Chairman of the Finance Committee. The BCB reiterates that the interests of the cricketers remain its highest priority.""The board also appealed to players to continue participating in the BPL.""BCB hopes that all cricketers will continue to display the highest standards of professionalism and dedication to the betterment of Bangladesh cricket during what is a challenging period for the game...and will do their utmost to ensure continued participation in the Bangladesh Premier League (BPL).""The dispute began after Najmul repeated Bangladesh’s decision not to travel to India for next month’s T20 World Cup due to what he described as ""security worries,"" and dismissed concerns over player payments if the team withdrew from the event.He said players would not be compensated, stating they had not earned that support after failing to win an ICC tournament. The remarks triggered strong backlash, with CWAB demanding his removal from the board.Bangladesh have refused to tour India following the exclusion of pacer Mustafizur Rahman from the IPL, a decision taken on BCCI’s instructions amid unspecified ""developments all around.""The BCB remains in discussions with the ICC after the governing body showed reluctance to move Bangladesh’s four matches in India to Sri Lanka.Najmul had earlier drawn criticism after calling former Bangladesh captain Tamim Iqbal an ""agent of India"" following Tamim’s call for restraint in dealing with the situation, warning that present decisions could have long-term consequences. CWAB had condemned those comments.","Bangladesh players say they are prepared to return to cricket if M Najmul Islam issues a public apology and the process related to his removal from directorship of the board moves forward.

Allan Donald on Virat Kohli’s legacy: Can he reach 100 centuries?

RAJKOT: New Zealand allrounder Daryl Mitchell ’s latest act of tormenting Indian bowlers began far away from the cameras back home in Lincoln, on dusty wickets prepared to simulate subcontinental surfaces.Those earlymorning sessions came roaring back into the spotlight on Wednesday at Rajkot’s Niranjan Shah Stadium, where the Hamiltonborn Mitchell produced a superb 131 not out (117 balls), sweeping and reverse-sweeping with such ease that India’s spin threat looked strangely muted as New Zealand chased down 285 with 15 balls to spare to force a series decider.“There’s been plenty, plenty mornings in the marquee down in the South Island in Lincoln on some prepared dusty wickets, to try and find ways to come up with game plans in this part of the world,” Mitchell told reporters. “That’s the stuff that a lot of people don’t see…the work that you put in, away from the shiny lights and the TV, but it’s always nice when you get the rewards from that.”No middle-order batter in recent times has dominated the Indian bowling attack like Mitchell has. In his last six matches against India, he has three centuries and two fifties, a run that has not just bruised India’s pride but also pushed up his own ODI numbers.In 53 ODI innings, he has aggregated 2,553 runs at an average of 56.73.Mitchell said the mental shift is as important as the shot-making when a New Zealander walks into the subcontinent.“For us as New Zealanders, we don’t grow up on these surfaces, we grow up on bouncy, grassy wickets and the nature of playing international cricket is you have to find ways to adapt your game,” he said.“I’m comfortable with how I want to go about my batting in these conditions, trying to find ways to put the bowlers under pressure. Whether that’s using feet, sweep (shot), using the crease, there are different ways that you try and find ways to put pressure on them (opposition). For me, it’s been a learning process over several years now,” he said.","New Zealand allrounder Daryl Mitchell has been tormenting Indian bowlers.

MELBOURNE: Carlos Alcaraz warned Friday that he was ""hungry"" to break his Australian Open title drought and become the youngest man to complete a career Grand Slam, calling it his primary target in 2026.The world number one from Spain is the title favourite along with two-time defending champion and great rival Jannik Sinner.The Melbourne Park crown is the only one of the four majors that Alcaraz has never won, his best performance the quarter-finals in 2024 and 2025.If he goes all the way this year he will surpass fellow Spaniard Rafael Nadal as the youngest man to win all four majors. Nadal was 24 when he achieved the feat.The 22-year-old Alcaraz, who begins his title assault against Australia's 79th-ranked Adam Walton, said he could not wait to get going.""I think this is my main goal for this year,"" said Alcaraz, whose only warm-up was a win against Italy's Sinner in a light-hearted exhibition match in South Korea.""So it's going to be really interesting for me how I prepared, which I think I just made a really good pre-season, just to be in a good shape.""I'm just hungry for the title, hungry to do a really good result here. I'm just getting ready as much as I can.""I'm really excited about the tournament beginning.""Alcaraz was asked by reporters if he would swap titles at all three of the other majors this year for one Melbourne crown.Underlining just how important winning the Australian Open and nailing the career Grand Slam is to him, he said he could not decide.""I don't know which one I would choose,"" he said, smiling broadly.""Obviously complete the career Grand Slam is something amazing to do, be able to be the youngest that has done it before, you know, is even better.""- No change after split -There has been much focus on Alcaraz's coaching team in the build-up to Melbourne.In December the six-time major champion abruptly announced that he was splitting from coach Juan Carlos Ferrero after seven hugely successful years together, with assistant Samuel Lopez taking over.Alcaraz began working with Ferrero, a former world number one, when he was a teenager.Quizzed by reporters for the reasons behind the surprise split, Alcaraz said that it felt like the right time to end the partnership and was a mutual decision.""With Juan Carlos, we decided to do it. I'm just having plenty of confidence in the team that I have right now,"" he said.""As I said, practice has been really good.

MELBOURNE: Jannik Sinner said Friday a three-month doping ban last year made him stronger as a person and more relaxed on court as he prepares to defend his Australian Open title.The 24-year-old arrived at Melbourne Park last year under intense pressure, not knowing his fate after a drugs scandal.He managed to put aside the noise and win the title but his career was put on hold afterwards as he served the three-month suspension for twice testing positive for a banned anabolic steroid in 2024.Sinner always maintained the product entered his system unintentionally through a massage from his physiotherapist, who had used a spray containing it to treat a cut.While the World Anti-Doping Agency said Sinner did not intend to cheat, it ordered him to serve the ban as he was responsible for the actions of his entourage.""Last year was definitely a much more difficult situation because in this moment last year I didn't know exactly what's going to happen,"" he said.""So I tried still to enjoy it when I went out on the court, but still had it in my head kind of.""It was difficult for me, but also for the family. I tried to stay with the people I really love, which at times worked very well. At times it was a bit disappointing, too.""Sinner's ban expired in May and he bounced back to win Wimbledon and the ATP Finals, ending the year as world number two behind fierce rival Carlos Alcaraz.He said the experience had made him a better person.""It is what it is, right? After that, I think everything happens for a reason,"" he said.""It got me even stronger as a person. The person I've become it's much more mature in a way because I see things when they're not going in the right direction different ways.""Whatever comes on court, result-wise, that's all an extra,"" he added.""I live the sport also in a very different way now, which is relaxed, but I give everything I have. It's a balance of everything. So yeah, I'm very happy.""- 'Dad Cahill' -Sinner saw off Alexander Zverev in straight sets to win the title a year ago, having come from two sets down to defeat Daniil Medvedev in the 2024 Australian Open final.Should he win three in a row he would join Novak Djokovic as the only men in the Open era to do so.The Serbian legend has done the three-peat twice during his 10 titles at Melbourne Park and could meet Sinner in the semi-finals this year, if both get that far.The Italian will get his campaign under way against France's Hugo Gaston, with master coach Darren Cahill again in his corner.The pair joined forces in June 2022 and Cahill has overseen Sinner's elevation to the top of the game.""He's so important for all of us, for all the team.

Sitanshu Kotak press conference: Conversations between coach Gambhir, Virat and Rohit, and more

Poll Which player do you believe is more crucial for India's ODI squad? Ravindra Jadeja Axar Patel Both equally

Opportunities on the bench

RAJKOT: It’s festive season in Ravindra Jadeja ’s hometown. The markets are teeming with locals preparing for Sankranti and the kite festival on Wednesday, the day of the second ODI. For Jadeja, though, it’s a different kind of hustle: holding on to the spot of India’s premier ODI spin-bowling allrounder ahead of Axar Patel Jadeja has been a constant during the optional training sessions on match eve. On Tuesday, his usual carefree demeanour took a back seat. He batted in the nets for close to an hour before bowling an extended spell. With the 2027 ODI World Cup about 20 months away, there is pressure on him to reestablish his credentials.TOI understands Axar Patel is currently the preferred choice for that tournament. He isn’t playing the ongoing ODI series because the selectors, it is learnt, want to preserve him for the upcoming T20I series in the lead-up to the T20 World Cup next month. Effectively, Jadeja is on trial to stay relevant in India’s ODI scheme of things. It’s also part of a wider plan: building a pool of backups for each position for 2027.The team management leans towards having a lefthanded batter in the middle order and also someone from the top order who can offer a few steady overs. That brought Ayush Badoni into the picture once Washington Sundar was injured in Vadodara on Sunday.If KL Rahul continues as the No. 1 wicketkeeper-batter over Rishabh Pant, it eventually becomes a shootout between Jadeja and Axar for the No.5 slot. Of late, Jadeja’s diminishing power-hitting hasn’t escaped the discerning eye.Axar’s rapid evolution as a batter had prompted the team management to push him up the order in the Champions Trophy when Jadeja was also in the XI on slow, turning pitches. Since the World Cup is slated to be played on South Africa’s pacier, bouncier pitches, there may be little scope to fit in both, with Hardik Pandya likely to come in and bat at No. 7.Batting coach Sitanshu Kotak refused to comment on where Jadeja stands in his white-ball career. Jadeja, though, couldn’t have asked for a better venue to regain his attacking touch than Rajkot.Kotak, however, asserted that Yashasvi Jaiswal and Ruturaj Gaikwad played in the last ODI series against South Africa only because Shubman Gill and Shreyas Iyer were not available. “The positive is that both of them got hundreds. But they will have to wait for their opportunities,” he said.There’s an underlying concern in the ranks: the decreasing number of ODIs played every year. As per the current schedule, India have only about 25 ODIs left before the World Cup. Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli play only one format and KL Rahul too is dependent on the format to keep his white-ball career going.“It’s very hard to convince the likes of Rohit, Kohli and Rahul to sit out. They will always argue that they get to play far and few between to build a rhythm. Prior to the home ODI season, it was discussed that Pant and Rahul will be rotated. Pant could have got a look-in this series if he didn’t get injured,” sources close to TOI said.“There are a lot of changes in the playing conditions for the ODI World Cup. Hopefully, we will get more ODIs after this T20 World Cup,” Kotak said.","Jadeja is on trial to stay relevant in India’s ODI scheme of things.

India vs New Zealand ODIs preview: Captain Shubman Gill, vice-captain Shreyas Iyer in focus

Similarity with India’s defeat Down Under

Two defensive coaches

Bazball arrived in Australia preaching fearlessness and fun, but left the Australian shores shredded. After almost four years of planning, England lost the Ashes in just 11 days, and the series 4-1.With an arsenal of raw pace fast bowlers, Ben Stokes ’ England and thousands of their travelling fans arrived Down Under with optimism and hope of reclaiming the urn in Australia after 15 years. Instead, the Bazballers were thrashed.Australia were brilliant throughout the series as Mitchell Starc emulated Ian Botham to produce a series of a lifetime with 31 wickets and two half-centuries. Travis Head became the first Australian opener to aggregate more than 600 runs in a series since Michael Slater’s 623 in the 1994-95 Ashes.Under the leadership of Starc and Scott Boland, who claimed 20 wickets, the Australian bowling attack was outstanding even without Josh Hazlewood for all five Tests, Pat Cummins for four of the five matches and Nathan Lyon for three.England, by contrast, struggled to keep their bowlers fit and did little to offset that weakness through selection.Before winning the Boxing Day Test, the fourth match of the series in Melbourne, the closest England came to winning a match was in the series opener in Perth.Guess how many fast bowlers they played there? Four. Jofra Archer, Gus Atkinson, Mark Wood and Braydon Carse.When Wood was injured and ruled out of the second Test, England did not bring in fast bowler Josh Tongue but opted for batting all-rounder Will Jacks, who also bowls off spin, at The Gabba.With a first-class bowling average of 43.47, only marginally better than Joe Root, Jacks at best was a batter who could bowl and not the other way around. It was a poor selection, made with the intent of shortening the England tail rather than taking Australian wickets.England did not correct this mistake across the series and never again played four frontline fast bowlers together in a match apart from the Perth Test.In the four Tests he played, Jacks took six wickets and bowled just 65.4 overs. By contrast, Josh Tongue took 18 wickets in the three Tests he played and bowled 97.2 overs. Interestingly, England’s lone spinner Shoaib Bashir, whom the current management had backed for 19 Tests, did not play a single game in the five-match series.By replacing a wicket-taking fast bowler with a batter who could deliver some off spin, Brendon McCullum and Ben Stokes effectively increased the workload and stress on England’s fast-bowling attack, led by Jofra Archer.England’s bizarre selection also allowed Australia’s lower order to add valuable runs and failed to fully exploit Australia’s own injury concerns.When India toured Australia for the Border-Gavaskar Trophy in 2024-25, they applied somewhat similar tactics and were defeated 3-1.In Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammed Siraj, Prasidh Krishna, Harshit Rana and Akash Deep, India had five frontline fast bowlers in their squad for the series. However, not once did they play four of them together in a match.Across all five Tests, Nitish Kumar Reddy effectively served as India’s fourth fast bowler. He bowled just 44 overs in the series, took five wickets and conceded runs at an economy of 4.31.With defensive selections throughout the series, the team management repeatedly put strain on Siraj and Bumrah. The selections not only broke Bumrah by the fifth Test but also reduced India’s chances of winning matches.With three fast bowlers, Nitish Reddy and a spinner, sometimes even two, India’s primary issue throughout the series was a lack of sustained threat suited to the conditions. Between 2018 and 2022, India played four fast bowlers in 14 Tests outside Asia, winning six and losing seven.In the same period, when they opted for three fast bowlers in 18 Tests, they won five and lost ten. Accepting a longer tail in SENA conditions has delivered better outcomes than protecting the batting at the expense of bowling strength.While they project aggressive personas and an appetite for results, both McCullum and Gautam Gambhir have often pursued respectable totals rather than maximising their chances of taking 20 wickets in Test matches.On their respective tours to Australia, both effectively communicated through selection that playing an extra batter or all-rounder instead of a frontline fast bowler strengthened their playing eleven.That is negative thinking. One additional bowler contributes more significantly to a bowling attack than one extra batter does to the batting unit. The runs conceded due to a lack of threat only make life harder for the batters, as opponents can attack for longer periods.England’s selections were aimed at providing extra batting cushion in the lower order in case of a collapse, rather than increasing their chances of taking 20 wickets.This is not to suggest that selecting a fourth frontline fast bowler would have won England the series. They would still have needed better catching, having dropped 17 chances, and more disciplined batting. However, it would have significantly improved their chances of dismissing Australia twice in a Test match and competing for victories.Winning Test matches in SENA countries is never easy for touring sides. It becomes harder still when teams dilute their bowling due to a lack of faith in their batting. India learned that lesson last year, and England have learned it again the hard way. Unless both sides adopt similar conservatism, as seen during India’s tour of England in 2025, this approach rarely succeeds.","England lost the Ashes in just 11 days, and the series 4-1.

Brief Scores:

Henil Patel stole the show with a sensational five-wicket haul as India U19 cruised to a six-wicket win over USA U19 in a rain-affected ICC Under-19 World Cup opener on Thursday. The right-arm pacer ran through the USA middle order with ruthless precision, finishing with outstanding figures of 5/16 from seven overs, including a maiden, as India opted to bowl under cloudy conditions. The visitors were bundled out for just 107 in 35.2 overs, leaving India with a modest target.Rain interrupted India’s chase, reducing the revised target to 96 in 37 overs under the DLS method. India had made a cautious start, reaching 21/1 in four overs before the weather intervened. Once play resumed, 14-year-old Vaibhav Sooryavanshi fell early for 2, bowled by Ritvik Appidi (2/24 in five overs) after attempting a risky step down the pitch. Skipper Ayush Mhatre showed intent with two boundaries but could not stay long, falling for 19. Vedant Trivedi (2) and vice-captain Vihaan Malhotra (18) also departed, leaving India slightly wobbling at 70/4.Abhigyan Kundu then anchored the innings, scoring a patient 42 not out from 41 balls, guiding India to victory with composure and ensuring Kanishk Chouhan (10 not out) stayed unbeaten at the other end.Henil’s brilliance with the ball had set the tone early. He struck in his first over, catching Amrinder Gill (1) behind the slips, then had Sahil Garg (16) caught at third man.He dismantled the USA captain Utkarsh Srivastava for a duck and Arjun Mahesh (16) in the same over. Khilan Patel added to the damage, trapping Amogh Arepally (3), while Nitish Sudini’s 36 offered the only resistance. Henil returned to clean up the tail, sending Sabrish Prasad (7) and Rishabh Shimpi (0) back to the pavilion.With this win, India begin their Group B campaign confidently alongside Bangladesh and New Zealand.USA: 107 in 35.2 overs (Nitish Sudini 36; Henil Patel 5/16)India: 99/4 in 17.2 overs (Abhigyan Kundu 42*, Ritvik Appidi 2/24)","Henil Patel stole the show with a sensational five-wicket haul.

India vs New Zealand: 'Ravindra Jadeja needs to look at his form or...'

Bangladesh all-rounder Mehidy Hasan Miraz has responded strongly to recent comments from within the Bangladesh Cricket Board, saying they have left the dressing room “deeply disappointed” and have fueled a misleading narrative about how players are compensated.Speaking at a press conference on Thursday, Miraz addressed remarks by BCB director and finance committee chair M Nazmul Islam, who had called Tamim Iqbal an “Indian agent” and suggested that players would face financial consequences if Bangladesh did not participate in the 2026 T20 World Cup in India. Miraz was clear in his criticism. “We always say the board is our guardian. When comments like these come from them, it is deeply disappointing for us,” he said.Miraz also pushed back against recurring claims that cricketers “live off taxpayers’ money.” “That’s not how it works at all,” he said. “The money the board has today is the result of every match played wearing the Bangladesh jersey. It’s earned through the hard work of players. Everyone has a rightful share in it.”He stressed that the issue extends beyond one comment, touching on both respect and the financial mechanics of the sport.“We play ICC tournaments and that's why we are earning money. If cricket doesn’t happen, sponsors won’t come. ICC revenue won’t come either. The board stands where it does today because players go out and play,” Miraz explained.The controversy has escalated into the players’ association arena, with the Cricketers Welfare Association of Bangladesh (CWAB) calling for Nazmul’s resignation and warning of a boycott if tensions continue.Miraz highlighted the broader impact of such remarks. “This isn’t just a personal issue. It’s embarrassing for the entire sports arena. I don’t know whether those comments were made knowingly or unknowingly, but from someone in that position, such remarks are simply unacceptable,” he said.Acknowledging that criticism comes with professional sport, he added, “If we don’t perform, we will be criticised. There isn’t a single cricketer who hasn’t faced criticism after poor performance.”He concluded by clarifying the financial reality for players. “No, we earn our money by playing cricket,” he stated plainly, defending the integrity and professionalism of Bangladesh’s cricketers.",Mehidy Hasan Miraz has responded strongly to recent comments from within the Bangladesh Cricket Board.

WPL Auction 2026: Full Breakdown of Every Major Number

South Africa’s captain Laura Wolvaardt has been awarded the ICC Women’s Player of the Month for December, following a sensational month in which she spearheaded her team to series victories against Ireland in both T20I and ODI formats. Building on a stellar ICC Women’s Cricket World Cup 2025 campaign, Wolvaardt rounded off the year with a remarkable sequence of performances, including three centuries across formats in a single month.Wolvaardt set the tone in the opening T20I with a breathtaking unbeaten 115, striking at an extraordinary rate of 205.35. Her innings featured 15 boundaries and four sixes, setting the foundation for South Africa’s dominance. The momentum carried into the ODI series, where she opened the batting and played a pivotal role in the whitewash. After scoring 31 in the first ODI, she returned with back-to-back centuries: 124 off 111 balls in the second ODI and an unbeaten 100 in the final match.Across the three ODIs, Wolvaardt accumulated 255 runs at an average of 127.50, maintaining a strike rate of 111.84. In the T20I series, she scored 137 runs at a strike rate of 190.27, being dismissed just once.This marks Wolvaardt’s second Player of the Month award in three months, having previously won the accolade in October 2025. Reflecting on the honour, she said, “I’m delighted to be named the ICC Player of the Month once again. To win it two times in three months is very special and something I’ll cherish for a long time. I loved batting throughout Ireland’s tour of South Africa, and it was hugely rewarding to contribute with runs across both the ODI and T20I formats. ”Looking ahead, Wolvaardt is focused on the ICC Women’s T20 World Cup 2026. “My focus is firmly on carrying this momentum forward. We’ve shown real progress in recent ICC events, and I’m excited about the summer ahead in England and Wales. I hope to continue playing my part and help take the team all the way,” she added.Wolvaardt edged out teammate Sune Luus, who scored 323 runs and picked up eight wickets across formats, and November winner Shafali Verma, who amassed 241 runs in five T20Is for India, to claim this latest honour.",South Africa captain Laura Wolvaardt named ICC Women's Player of the Month.

Australia’s star fast bowler Mitchell Starc has been named the ICC Men’s Player of the Month for December, following a dominant display in the 2025-26 Ashes series against England. The 35-year-old left-armer was exceptional with both ball and bat, taking 31 wickets across the series while also contributing two half-centuries, earning him the Player of the Series award.Starc’s performances in December alone were enough to secure the monthly accolade. Across three Tests during the month, he claimed 16 wickets and added 139 runs, showcasing his value as a genuine all-round threat. Speaking to the ICC, Starc said, “It’s an honour to be named the ICC Player of the Month, and even more special that it came on the back of such a successful home Ashes. To have played a part in winning such an iconic series in front of our home crowd is something we will all relish for a long time. ”He also highlighted the team’s broader ambitions, noting, “As a team, we’ve had some outstanding performances in the last few years. The focus now is on building that momentum towards a place in next year’s ICC World Test Championship Final.”Starc’s award came ahead of stiff competition from two other impressive performers. West Indies’ Justin Greaves had a standout month in New Zealand, scoring 283 runs at an average of 56.60 across three Tests, including an unbeaten 202 in the fourth innings of the first Test at Christchurch that helped his side secure a draw.Meanwhile, New Zealand fast bowler Jacob Duffy dominated the ball, taking 23 wickets at an exceptional average of 15.43 in the three-Test series against West Indies, playing a key role in New Zealand’s 2-0 series victory with his swing and precision.Starc’s recognition underlines his continued status as one of the premier all-rounders in world cricket and highlights his instrumental role in Australia’s home Ashes triumph.",Mitchell Starc named ICC Men’s Player of the Month for December.

'Not doing a lot': India coach throws Nitish Kumar Reddy under the bus after second ODI,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/india-vs-new-zealand/not-doing-a-lot-india-coach-throws-nitish-kumar-reddy-under-the-bus-after-second-odi/articleshow/126544016.cms,"Rajkot: India's KL Rahul, left, and Nitish Kumar Reddy (PTI Photo/Ravi Choudhary)

India vs New Zealand: 'Ravindra Jadeja needs to look at his form or...'

Indian assistant coach Ryan ten Doeschate offered a frank assessment after India’s seven-wicket defeat to New Zealand in the second ODI, conceding that all-rounder Nitish Kumar Reddy has struggled to make a telling impact despite being given repeated chances, while also pointing out that Rohit Sharma remains “short on cricket” heading into the series.Reddy, the only change in India’s XI for the match, endured a quiet outing as New Zealand chased down 284 with ease to level the three-match series. The all-rounder scored 20 runs and went wicketless in his two overs, failing to capitalise on what ten Doeschate described as a valuable opportunity.“With Nitish, we keep talking about developing him and getting him game time and then when you do get him game time, he often ends up not doing a heck of a lot in the games,” ten Doeschate said after the match.He stressed that situations like the second ODI were exactly the kind Reddy needed to embrace to strengthen his case for selection. “For someone who's making their way, particularly with the bat tonight, it was that perfect chance where you're walking in that situation and you've got a chance to spend 15 overs at the wicket. You really have to take those chances to push your case to be selected,” he added.Looking back, ten Doeschate admitted India may have misread the conditions.With New Zealand’s spinners extracting significant help from the surface, he felt an extra spinner could have been more effective than persisting with an all-round option.“If you look at the combinations we have played in the past, we do like the extra spinner,” he said. “To bring Ayush (Badoni) into the squad at the very last minute with Washy (Washington Sundar) going down in the last game, we thought Nitish should be better suited on this track.“Looking at the way the New Zealand spinners bowled, we could have done with another spinner.”Ten Doeschate also spoke about Rohit Sharma’s form, suggesting a lack of match practice could be a factor despite the India captain featuring in two Vijay Hazare Trophy games earlier in the season.“Rohit, I thought tonight particularly, both innings was a real new-ball wicket. It didn't look easy to bat,” he said. “Over a short period of time if you take the first ODI, he's not been as fluent as he has been and that's going to be a challenge for him, not playing cricket between series.”He dismissed suggestions that Rohit was consciously altering his approach. “I don't think it's a conscious approach. He's such a brutal player, but he's actually a touch player at the end of the day. He times the ball… so as soon as the wickets aren't very good, it's going to be difficult for him to look in fluent mode like he normally is.“It's just a combination of the wickets being slightly difficult and maybe just being a little bit short on cricket leading into the series.”On the batting order, ten Doeschate indicated that KL Rahul ’s current form opens up options, including a regular role at No. 5. “KL is certainly good enough to be at No. 5. That was a quality hundred there and also the toll that keeping takes on guys in 50-overs cricket isn't that bad. It's not like we're protecting him,” he said.“One of our strategies in the last 18 months has been to prolong that batting order and we do like to use the all-rounder either high up the order or at No. 5 like we've done with Washy in the past. But that certainly is an avenue to explore.”The assistant coach also backed Ravindra Jadeja despite his modest wicket returns in recent ODIs, insisting there was no cause for concern. “I don't think he's feeling the heat. His stats are crazy and he's probably been a bit light on wickets of late,” ten Doeschate said.“But it's not a concern. The things we've looked at in terms of his pace that he's bowling, the things we've asked him to work on, I feel like he is actually bowling better. So, hopefully the wickets will follow with a bit of a lag.”",India's assistant coach Ryan ten Doeschate says all-rounder Nitish Kumar Reddy has struggled to make a telling impact despite being given repeated chances.

Carrick meets challenge 'head on'

Jobs on the line

Can Arsenal fell Forest?

MANCHESTER: Michael Carrick has the chance to make a fine first impression to his short-term stint as Manchester United manager by derailing local rivals Manchester City's Premier League title challenge on Saturday.City, meanwhile, have the chance to cut the gap on leaders Arsenal to three points at Old Trafford, while United need the points to boost their chances of Champions League football next season.At the other end of the table, Tottenham's Thomas Frank and West Ham boss Nuno Espirito Santo are fighting to save their jobs as the sides clash in a London derby.AFP Sport looks at three talking points ahead of the weekend action:Carrick faces a baptism of fire with the Premier League's top two the opponents for his first two matches in charge of United.""It's what we live for (big games) - some are more challenging than others but it's why we are here. So we'll go for it head on,"" said Carrick.Before a daunting trip to Arsenal next weekend, the former United and England midfielder has the chance to galvanise a season at risk of coming completely off the rails.An FA Cup exit to Brighton last weekend followed a run of just one win in six league games for United either side of Ruben Amorim's dismissal.The Red Devils, however, remain well in contention for a place in next season's Champions League, just three points adrift of fourth-placed Liverpool.Carrick was unbeaten in a previous three-game interim spell at United after the departure of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer in 2021.Since then he gained far more managerial experience at second-tier Middlesbrough, but was sacked in June for failing to achieve promotion to the Premier League.""I understand the job, what it entails and the responsibility of it,"" added Carrick. ""Now I feel in a strong place to move forward and, hopefully, be successful here.""Both Frank and Nuno have defied speculation over their futures to remain in charge for Saturday's clash at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.Spurs have won just four of their last 17 games in all competitions to slip to 14th in the Premier League and bow out of both domestic cups.Frank is on the brink of joining a long list of managers who have failed to make the grade in north London, including Nuno, who lasted just 17 games as Tottenham boss in 2021.The Portuguese coach, already sacked once this season by Nottingham Forest, has managed just two wins in 16 Premier League games since joining the Hammers in September.West Ham desperately need a quick upturn in results as they sit seven points adrift of safety in 18th place,Top of both the Premier League and Champions League, the Gunners are on course for an unprecedented quadruple after FA and League Cup victories this week.But Mikel Arteta's men must overcome a poor record at the City Ground against a Forest side keen to make amends to their furious manager.Arsenal have won in just one of their last five visits to Nottingham.Forest were dumped out of the FA Cup by second-tier Wrexham on penalties last weekend, sparking an outburst from Sean Dyche.""It's unacceptable to me, but it's unacceptable to the badge as well,"" he said of his side's first-half performance left them battling back from 2-0 down before drawing 3-3.Fixtures (all times GMT)SaturdayManchester United v Manchester City (1230), Sunderland v Crystal Palace, Tottenham v West Ham, Liverpool v Burnley, Leeds v Fulham, Chelsea v Brentford (all 1500), Nottingham Forest v Arsenal (1730)SundayWolves v Newcastle (1400), Aston Villa v Everton (1630)MondayBrighton v Bournemouth (2000)",Michael Carrick takes charge of Manchester United for the first time on Saturday.

BARCELONA: Ferran Torres and Lamine Yamal fired Barcelona to a 2-0 win over Racing Santander and into the Copa del Rey quarter-finals on Thursday.The Spanish internationals' strikes helped holders Barca defeat second division leaders Racing to progress from a surprisingly tight last 16 clash and record an 11th consecutive victory across all competitions.The hosts had two goals disallowed for offside and record 32-time winners Barca did just enough to claim victory.""We didn't think they would be so hard to break down,"" admitted Torres to Movistar.""We knew that we had to stretch the game, be calm and in the end it went well.""Having seen Real Madrid eliminated at second-tier Albacete on Wednesday Barca coach Hansi Flick named a fairly strong side, including teenage star Yamal.After a 15 minute delay with some fans stuck outside, the match kicked off at Racing's Sardinero stadium, and Barca quickly took control of the ball.The Catalans struggled to turn possession into a meaningful opening though, and when they finally did Dani Olmo missed his kick from Marcus Rashford's dangerous cross.Racing looked to breach Barcelona's high defensive line but when they did get in behind the visitors managed to mop up well.Giorgi Guliashvili's low effort from range was fielded comfortably by Joan Garcia, and that was as close as the hosts came.Barcelona continued to push forward in the second half and Rashford had a shot tipped away and also drilled narrowly wide.Eventually the Spanish champions took the lead through Torres, after Fermin Lopez sent him through on goal. The Spain international rounded Racing goalkeeper Jokin Ezkieta and rolled home.The hosts were forced on the offensive and twice had the ball in Barcelona's net, but both of Manex Lozano's goals were ruled out for offside.Barca goalkeeper Garcia made a superb save to thwart Lozano one-on-one deep in stoppage time and avoid the game going to extra-time.Barca wrapped up their win with the last kick of the match, Yamal tapping in Raphinha's cross at the back post.""We played the game we had to play, we played a 10 out of 10 match, (with) two offside goals and the chance at the end... it's okay, it's football,"" said Racing defender Alvaro Mantilla.Elsewhere Valencia won 2-0 at Burgos to reach the last eight.",Barcelona beat Racing Santander 2-0 in Copa del Rey last 16.

NEW DELHI: The All India Football Federation (AIFF) said on Thursday that the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) has recognised the shortened 2025–26 Indian Super League (ISL) season, with clubs from India eligible only for indirect entry into the AFC Champions League 2 through zonal qualifiers.Because of the delayed start to the season, Indian clubs will not be able to complete the mandatory 24 matches — across the top-tier league and domestic cup — required for direct entry into AFC club competitions.Most clubs are expected to play a total of 16 matches during the season, including at least three games in the AIFF Super Cup and 13 matches in the ISL.""With the exception of any additional slot(s) allocated to a Member Association in accordance with Articles 3.4 and 3.5, Member Associations that fail to fulfil the Member Association Eligibility Criteria shall, subject to Article 4.4, be eligible to be allocated only indirect slots for the relevant AFC Club Competition,"" the AFC said in a letter to the AIFF dated January 15.""In such cases, the number of direct slots for the relevant Member Association(s) in the relevant AFC Club Competition shall be wholly converted into indirect slots (e.g. 2+1 becomes 0+3),"" Shin Man Gil, the AFC’s deputy general secretary, competitions and football, said in the letter.The 2025–26 ISL season is scheduled to begin on February 14, with all 14 clubs confirming their participation earlier this week.A total of 91 matches will be played in the curtailed season, with each team playing 13 single-leg matches against the other teams.""In light of the foregoing, kindly be informed that, should the 2025/26 ISL s season be organised as proposed in your letter, Article 4.3 of the Entry Regulations shall apply for the purposes of entry into the relevant AFC club competitions,"" the AFC letter stated.Earlier, ISL clubs had asked the AIFF to approach the AFC for a one-time relaxation of the 24-match requirement to allow direct entry into the ACL 2.Following the clubs’ request, AIFF deputy secretary general M Satyanarayan wrote to the AFC seeking a one-time exemption.""In light of the exceptional circumstances impacting Indian football this season, we respectfully request that your esteemed office grant the AIFF and the clubs participating in the ISL, a one-time exemption from the minimum requirements set forth in the AFC Regulations.""""Specifically, we request that a minimum of sixteen (16) matches be deemed sufficient for clubs participating in the ISL to qualify for direct entry into club competitions organized by the AFC, and the ISL season scheduled to take place between 14 February 2026 and […] along with the Super Cup held between 25 October 2025 and 7 December 2025, be considered to be sufficient for the purposes of maintaining direct entry slots in the relevant club competitions organized by AFC. """"Such an exemption would significantly support the AIFF's efforts to restart the league, serve as an important encouragement to the clubs during this challenging period for all stakeholders in Indian football,"" Satyanarayan added.Last Saturday, the AIFF asked clubs to submit details of their proposed home venues so that fixtures could be prepared and broadcast and commercial partners finalised.The ISL 2025–26 season had remained uncertain since July, after the AIFF’s commercial partner Football Sports Development Limited (FSDL), owned by the Reliance Group, put the league on hold amid uncertainty over the Master Rights Agreement (MRA).The MRA expired on December 8, 2025, after negotiations between the two sides failed.",The Asian Football Confederation has recognised the shortened 2025–26 Indian Super League (ISL) season.

MADRID: Real Madrid fell to a shock 3-2 defeat in the Copa del Rey last 16 on Wednesday as Alvaro Arbeloa's debut as coach ended in humiliation by second-tier opposition.Appointed on Monday to replace Xabi Alonso, Arbeloa and his side were ousted by Jefte Betancor's stoppage-time winner at the Carlos Belmonte stadium.Without French superstar Kylian Mbappe and various other key players, Arbeloa's side struggled against a side currently 17th in Spain's second division.Albacete took the lead through Javi Villar but Franco Mastantuono equalised just before half-time.Jefte put the hosts back ahead after 82 minutes and then scored the winner after Gonzalo Garcia's 91st-minute goal looked to have forced extra time for the 15-time European champions.""Here at this club a draw is already bad -- it's a tragedy. Imagine a defeat like this, it's painful,"" Arbeloa told reporters.""I'm sure all our fans feel the same way. Even more so when it happens against a team from a lower division, although we already know here how tough any opponent can be.""If anyone is responsible and to blame for this outcome, it's clearly me, the one who made the decisions regarding the line-up, how we wanted to play, the substitutions.""I can only thank the players for the way they welcomed me, for the effort they put in today.""After Madrid lost the Spanish Super Cup final on Sunday against rivals Barcelona, President Florentino Perez replaced Alonso with reserve team coach Arbeloa.The Spaniard selected two players currently playing in the reserves he led until Monday -- holding midfielder Jorge Cestero and right-back David Jimenez.As well as Mbappe he left out players including goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois and Jude Bellingham, to rest ahead of the return to La Liga action on Saturday against Levante.""I'd do the same again, I brought a team capable of winning,"" said Arbeloa.The first half was mostly played under heavy gloom, not just Madrid's mood but an intense fog which set in a few minutes into the game.Vinicius Junior smashed high and wide from long range as neither side produced any clear chances until shortly before half-time when the hosts took a shock lead.Villar escaped Mastantuono's attentions at a corner and nodded Albacete in front after 42 minutes.Arbeloa's side levelled before the breakthrough, also capitalising on a corner, with Mastantuono turning home from close range.- Jefte's double -Albacete frustrated Madrid after the break and then burst into life in attack to take the lead once more.Andriy Lunin pushed away an effort from Riki but shortly afterwards Jefte put Alberto Gonzalez's side ahead.Gonzalo Garcia's clearance fell to the striker in the box and he fired down into the ground with ball bouncing up and flashing past Lunin.Madrid's young forward made amends by pulling his team level in stoppage time with a well-placed header.However, there was a sting in the tale as Jefte produced a sensational lofted finish past Lunin to snatch a famous late victory for Albacete, their first ever against Real Madrid.""I'm not afraid of failure, I can understand that someone would want to call this defeat that,"" added Arbeloa.""Failure is on the path to success, for me they are not in opposite directions.""Madrid captain Dani Carvajal, who came on as a substitute and could not stop Jefte's winner, said the players would work hard to revert the club's slump.""We're not at our best moment, we have to work hard, we all have to give a lot more, it's a reality,"" Carvajal told reporters.""We ask for forgiveness for the fans. We were not up to the level of this club, me first of all, and we will give our lives in the next games and months (to turn it around).""Elsewhere Real Betis beat Elche 2-1 and Alaves defeated Rayo Vallecano 2-0 to reach the quarter-finals.Holders Barcelona visit second division leaders Racing Santander on Thursday.",Real Madrid lose 3-2 to Albacete in the Copa del Rey last 16 on Wednesday.

Eli Manning breaks down Travis Kelce’s retirement dilemma with a simple test every NFL veteran understands,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/eli-manning-breaks-down-travis-kelces-retirement-dilemma-with-a-simple-test-every-nfl-veteran-understands/articleshow/126555137.cms,"Travis Kelce’s retirement talk (Getty Images)

Travis Kelce’s retirement talk gets real as Eli Manning explains how players truly know it’s time



While Travis Kelce's future looks uncertain at this point of time, Eli Manning comes forward to give the star Chiefs TE some valuable advice. For Kelce, the question is not about fame or numbers. It is about desire. The grind never announces itself loudly, but it makes its presence known over time, and few understand that better than a quarterback who walked away on his own terms.Manning’s words come at a moment when speculation feels louder than clarity. Kelce remains productive, visible, and influential, yet the NFL rarely grants gentle exits. As the calendar turns, the debate shifts from performance to purpose, and from what a player can do to what he still wants to give.Eli Manning did not frame retirement as a verdict from outsiders. He framed it as an internal reckoning. Speaking to PEOPLE, he made it clear that the choice belongs only to Kelce. “That's his decision, that only he can make, and only he knows what his desire and commitment towards it is. And it's one of those deals as you get older, it's not like you can do less and get the same result. You gotta work twice as hard to get half the results — the injuries, the buildup, you're getting slower, the fast-twitch motions,” Manning told PEOPLE.That reality shapes the weeks ahead. Manning believes clarity arrives when routine calls again. “I think as [Kelce] thinks over these next few weeks or months, he'll kind of know like, ‘Hey, am I itching to get back there and start grinding and start training and start doing everything I need to do or am I ready for this next chapter?’ And he's got other opportunities, he's got other things that he can stay busy with.”Those opportunities matter. Manning noted that staying close to football without absorbing hits offers balance, a way to remain connected while protecting the body. Kelce’s podcast success, business ventures, and brand presence already reflect that shift.Manning’s own exit followed a similar realization. “I kinda woke up one day and I just said, ‘Yep, it's time. It's time to be done. It's just too hard, it's not worth the effort, and it's just too much of a grind. It’s just gotten too difficult to play at this level that I want and expect to play at,' "" he recalls.Kelce echoed that uncertainty after Kansas City’s final home game. ""I've got so much love for this team, this organization and the people here, so I’ll spend some time with them, go through exit meetings tomorrow and get close to the family and figure things out,” he said. Then came the truth many veterans recognize. ""Who knows? Either it hits me quick or I gotta take some time.”Now, when the offseason starts, all eyes will be on Travis Kelce and how he reacts to all these retirement talks.Also Read: Kylie Kelce spills on Jason Kelce’s new swag and gives credit for why they now have four kids","Eli Manning says Travis Kelce's future is up to the Chiefs TE.

Sam Darnold Injury: Will the Seahawks QB play on Saturday against 49ers?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/sam-darnold-injury-will-the-seahawks-qb-play-on-saturday-against-49ers/articleshow/126555115.cms,"Sam Darnold injury update (Getty Images)

Will Sam Darnold play against the 49ers?



Will Sam Darnold play against the 49ers is the question hovering over Seattle as the Seahawks prepare for their biggest game of the season. The timing could not be sharper. After earning the NFC’s top seed and watching Wild Card weekend from home, Seattle now faces a familiar rival with championship stakes on the line.The calm of a bye week was briefly disrupted when Darnold appeared on the injury report late in the week. A limited practice raised eyebrows across the league, especially given how central the veteran quarterback has been to Seattle’s rise. Within hours, clarity arrived, steadying a fan base that understands how fragile postseason momentum can be.All signs point to yes. Darnold acknowledged the issue himself and framed it as precaution rather than panic. “Sam Darnold told reporters after practice that he felt something in his side while throwing on air. Asked what percentage he may not play: ‘Very low percentage. Closer to zero,'” NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport wrote on X, formerly Twitter. The Seahawks listed him as questionable, but the quarterback later removed doubt with his own words.“Kind of just felt a little something on that oblique, just didn't want to push it,” Darnold said today.“Wasn't the day to push it so that was it. So I just came inside, got some rehab and feel like I'll be ready to go for Saturday.”That confidence matters. Seattle’s offense has flowed through Darnold all season, blending controlled passing with a punishing run game that helped secure a 14-3 record. His ability to manage tempo and protect the football has been a quiet strength, especially in tight, defensive battles like the ones Seattle played against San Francisco this year.The 49ers know Darnold well, and they will test him early with pressure and disguised coverages. If Seattle had to turn to Drew Lock, the game plan would shrink. With Darnold available, the playbook stays open, and so does Seattle’s belief that this season can end somewhere special.There is also a personal edge. Darnold has heard the talk about his postseason past. Saturday offers a chance to change that narrative against a rival that has defined Seattle’s road all year. First, he has to take the field. Everything suggests he will, and that alone tilts the spotlight back where it belongs, on a divisional clash with a trip to the NFC Championship Game at stake.Also Read: Fred Warner Injury Update: Seahawks’ playoff plans shaken as 49ers star trends toward playing in decisive Divisional Round clash","Seahawks quarterback Sam Darnold was listed as questionable for Saturday's game against the 49ers.

Russell Wilson takes meaningful steps toward Beninese citizenship alongside Ciara

Russell Wilson is not treating this offseason like a pause. It looks more like a pivot. After completing his 14th NFL season, the veteran quarterback has stepped away from the grind to focus on something deeply personal. While his future in football remains open, his recent actions show a man thinking far beyond the next snap.During a visit to Benin, Wilson publicly shared plans that extend well outside the United States. Standing alongside his wife Ciara, the longtime NFL star confirmed he is beginning the process to become a citizen of the West African nation, blending personal history with long-term vision.“First time being here in Benin,” said a smiling Russell Wilson, via Africa Facts Zone on X. “But I think what’s really exciting is that becoming a citizen here. We’re really pumped up. She’s [Ciara] already one, I get to become one, maybe our kids will one day become one. It’s just a cool experience.”He later added, “It’s an honor to be a citizen here. Hopefully, real soon also. I’ll see you guys soon.”Benin’s citizenship initiative focuses on reconnecting descendants of enslaved Africans with their ancestral roots.Wilson qualifies through documented family history, and the timing of his visit carried added meaning as it coincided with Vodun Days, a national celebration honoring ancestral religion and heritage.For Wilson, the move is not only about identity. He also sees an opportunity to leave a lasting impact. “We really want to bring American football here,” he said. “Bring football globally here, and start teaching the kids how to really play football. So, I’m gonna come back and teach the kids to play football. It’s gonna be a cool experience.”While this chapter unfolds, Wilson remains clear about one thing. Retirement is not on the table. The former Super Bowl winner with the Seattle Seahawks plans to continue playing after his stint with the New York Giants, believing his experience still holds value.At 37, Wilson is balancing legacy and ambition. His journey to Benin reflects a player shaping life after football while still chasing what comes next on the field.Also Read: Travis Kelce’s unusually personal comments comparing Taylor Swift to his mother Donna raise new questions","Russell Wilson has begun the process of seeking citizenship in Benin.

George Kittle’s wife Claire’s raw sideline reaction to his brutal injury leaves fans shaken and emotional



George Kittle's injury changed the emotional temperature of a playoff night that had started with hope and noise in Santa Clara. The San Francisco 49ers were chasing momentum when their All-Pro tight end went down in the second quarter, a moment that silenced the stadium and sent a shock through the sideline. As George Kittle lay on the turf after catching a pass, the reality set in fast. This was not just another hit. It was the kind of moment that reshapes a season.What made it even more raw was where the camera happened to be. Kittle’s wife Claire was filming a behind the scenes WAGs episode when the injury occurred. Her reaction, captured in real time, stripped away the polish of game day and revealed the human cost of elite football. Pain, disbelief, and fear all collided in seconds, reminding fans that greatness always carries risk.The day after surgery loomed, Kittle chose honesty over self pity. He shared a message that reflected both heartbreak and gratitude. “Football sucks sometimes. But I love it. I love these guys and this team. Heartbroken but have felt so much love and support from everyone reaching out. I’ll be good. Thank you. We aren’t done yet! Also when your team owner is the first person to meet you in the locker room, you know you’re in a special place.🥃 cheers, all my love.” The post landed because it sounded like him. Tough. Loyal. Forward looking.Claire later gave fans a deeper look into the moment that changed everything. Her words did not soften the truth. “Disbelief and stillness were all I felt as I yelled, get up, get up, over and over again. He always gets up. He's George. He can do all things. He just does it. It hurts. There’s no preparing for it. I love this man with everything I have in me,” she wrote. She followed with belief, not sympathy.“He is a unicorn in this world, and he will be back stronger and better than ever before. The mind of a heartbroken athlete is a determined one.” Then came pride in the bigger picture. “He is un----withable, as is this entire team,” she continued. “I’m proud of these guys and the rally-together grit they fight with each week. It’s a special year, you can feel that, and we're not done yet.”Kittle’s reply said everything in one line. “You're the best teammate on this journey.” Recovery is expected to take nine to twelve months, and the road will test patience. Still, if belief fuels healing, George Kittle already has a powerful head start.Also Read: Tom Brady leans into work over romance after Alix Earle rumors, says he does not ""have much time for a personal life""","All-Pro tight end George Kittle went down in the second quarter.

Viewers criticized her Secret Traitor role, arguing she lacked reality TV experience. While some defended her reserved approach, many felt the casting choice was unfair and driven more by publicity than gameplay.

Donna Kelce casting sparks outrage among The Traitors US viewers

The latest season of The Traitors US has ignited debate before alliances could even settle. This time, the controversy is not about betrayals or banishments. It is about casting. Fans online believe producers placed Donna Kelce in a role that set her up to fail, turning her early exit into a lightning rod for frustration.Kelce entered the game with goodwill and curiosity from viewers who know her as the grounded presence behind NFL stars Travis Kelce and Jason Kelce. Yet that familiarity quickly turned into concern. Fans argue the show underestimated how brutal the format can be for someone without reality TV instincts, especially when strategy outweighs sincerity.The decision to cast Kelce as a Secret Traitor drew the most criticism. Viewers felt the twist exposed her too quickly and robbed her of a fair runway. One Reddit user, Least-Plantain, summed up the mood by writing, “Donna isn’t a Reality TV Pro or actor. She would have been fine as a faithful.”Another fan echoed that sentiment more emotionally. Infamous_Animal_8149 posted, “She should have been a faithful she would have been the most faithful of all of the faithfuls and it would have been so precious.I am sooooo mad.”Others questioned whether Kelce ever fit the mold. FakeKhaby10 wrote, “It was also ‘on the nose’ she’s the one who’s out of place. She’s not an actor or a gamer or a housewife.’” Still, not everyone blamed production.TheKevmiester offered a softer defense, asking, “Is it so hard to believe that one woman who is not a celebrity, and has not been on TV would be quiet and more reserved when in a castle with all those huge TV personalities?”Some reactions were harsher. Ok-Confidence4455 claimed, “It almost had the feeling of a Make A Wish experience come true. Seems like a nice lady, just not for reality TV.” The most pointed frustration came from beyluvislandria, who wrote on X, “I’m so irritated that they wasted a traitor position on Donna. TIFFANY was right there.”Kelce’s casting was meant to draw attention, boosted by her connection to Taylor Swift and the NFL spotlight. Instead, it raised questions about fairness. For many fans, the issue is simple. They did not want spectacle. They wanted a genuine chance, and they believe Donna Kelce never truly got one.Also Read: Travis Kelce’s unusually personal comments comparing Taylor Swift to his mother Donna raise new questions","Donna Kelce was cast as a Secret Traitor on The Traitors US.

Since then, unverified claims about her relationships have surfaced repeatedly. This latest rumor placed her name alongside one of the most famous athletes in the world. Yet the noise surrounding the claim has far outpaced the facts supporting it.Online posts suggesting a Brady Kirk relationship traced back to parody and unverified accounts, with no reporting to confirm the claim.

I don't have much time for a personal life or much time for myself but I love working and I love my kids.” He expanded on that thought with another candid reflection. “I like to be busy and try to really stay fulfilled in the things I'm doing, so I'm working on some really cool projects and I'm involved with some great teams of people that are doing some really positive things.”Brady, who divorced Gisele Bündchen in 2022, shares two children with her and a third with Bridget Moynahan . With rumors flying around there are facts that are evident. There is no proven support of the Erika Kirk dating claim and even Brady himself is still focusing on work, family, and purpose rather than rumors.Also Read: “My health….”: Gisele Bündchen hints at the emotional toll of loving Tom Brady and how it became a turning point in her life","Viral posts have claimed Tom Brady is dating Erika Kirk, but no credible evidence supports the rumor.

Kylie Kelce spills on Jason Kelce’s new swag and gives credit for why they now have four kids,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/kylie-kelce-spills-on-jason-kelces-new-swag-and-gives-credit-for-why-they-now-have-four-kids/articleshow/126549465.cms,"Kylie Kelce credits Jason Kelce’s upgraded style for their growing family in hilarious podcast confession (Getty Images)

Kylie Kelce teases Jason Kelce’s sharp new style, joking it played a role in their family of six

Kylie Kelce's swag gap came up as a candid and surprisingly relatable moment when the podcast host returned for season 2 of Not Gonna Lie and decided to talk openly about style inside her marriage. Instead of turning it into a joke at her husband’s expense, Kylie used the moment to reflect on how comfort, confidence, and timing shape the way partners show up, especially after years together.Speaking as a mother of four and the wife of a recently retired NFL star stepping into television, Kylie set the context clearly. Her point was not about fashion trends or labels. It was about how Jason Kelce’s personal style has quietly evolved over the years, and how she has learned to laugh at the contrast between them while still owning her side of it.Kylie did not hesitate to admit where she stands in the style equation. “I am the one bringing the team down. It’s me, it’s not my husband,” Kylie said. “My husband, he’s the one who’s got the swag.” She explained that the so called swag gap became more obvious as their lives changed, not because either of them tried to impress anyone.Looking back to their early dating days, Kylie described Jason’s simple but effective approach to dressing.“That was Jason's MO. He would just wear the exact same shirt in a different color,” she said. “And let me tell you, it hugged the biceps. It hung off the shoulders nicely. And it also emphasized like how, just… it looked good.” At the time, the effort was minimal, but the impact was not.Jason’s style shifted again after his NFL retirement. Once known for avoiding formal wear, he now suits up regularly for ESPN’s Monday Night Countdown. “He's wearing a suit on a very regular basis,” Kylie explained, making it clear she enjoys the transformation.She summed it up with a line that quickly became a fan favorite. “And let me tell you something. Don't ever ask yourself why we have four kids. You know? That's self-explanatory. Turn on ESPN on Monday night. I said what I needed to say,"" she quipped.Still, Kylie drew a clear line between fashion and overall cool. “He clearly has, like, a cooler swag to the way he dresses. Swag in general, like overall swag — we've seen him dance, guys,” she said. “And I don't even need you to see me dance to know that's a low bar. And I will always knock him down a few pegs when it comes to him thinking he's a good dancer.” She followed that with affection, adding, “I mean, I find it cute and endearing, but, like, we've seen it. ”Later in the episode, Kylie shared plans for more date nights and a kid free trip in 2026. Experience has taught her caution. “You know what I do know? I know what came the last time Mom and Dad went on a no-kids trip,” she said. “So you know what else is in? Contraception.”By leaning into honesty and humor, Kylie Kelce turned a lighthearted style discussion into a genuine reflection on marriage, attraction, and growing together.Also Read: Jaxson Dart’s involvement hints at bigger plan as Giants host John Harbaugh for interview",Kylie Kelce opened up about her husband Jason Kelce's style on her podcast.

A newly released teaser shows the pop star playfully using Pringles chips as flower petals, signaling a lighthearted tone. The full ad will build on the brand’s “Once You Pop, The Pop Don’t Stop” campaign and air during the Big Game on Feb. 8.

Pop star Sabrina Carpenter teams up with Pringles for Super Bowl LX

Pringles Super Bowl Commercial Teaser 2026 ft Sabrina Carpenter

The Ad race of the Super Bowl has just realized its pop moment. It could not be a better moment than when Sabrina Carpenter enters the spotlight with her first-ever commercial during the Super Bowl. With brands competing over who gets the attention first before Super Bowl LX, Pringles used a star whose image as a jester and success in the chart fits well in the mass appeal. It was not announced loudly and yet hit hard.The teaser is more of a charm than a spectacle. The 15 seconds preview demonstrates Carpenter sitting on a floor of the kitchen, dressed plainly, with a Pringles chip shaped like a flower on his hands. The scene is personal and premeditated. It is not so much selling noise as beckoning the viewers in, a tone that is remarkable in a place where many others are usually noisy.In the teaser, Carpenter delivers the line with a teasing cadence. “He loves me, he loves me not,” she says, plucking chip petals as her tone shifts. After a pause, she grabs one last chip and declares, “He loves me!” before eating it. The scene closes with a wink of humor that fits both her personality and the brand’s voice.While Pringles is keeping most details sealed, the company confirmed the full spot will build on its refreshed Pringles slogan, “Once You Pop, The Pop Don’t Stop.” A press release hinted that more sneak peeks will drop in the coming weeks, stretching anticipation rather than dumping reveals all at once.Carpenter’s involvement marks a shift toward music-driven storytelling for the brand, which previously leaned on star-studded humor. In recent years, Pringles featured names like Adam Brody, Nick Offerman, James Harden, Andy Reid, Chris Pratt, and Meghan Trainor. This year’s approach feels lighter and more character-led.The commercial will air during Super Bowl LX on Feb. 8, 2026, hosted at Levi’s Stadium. With advertisers only beginning to show their hands, Carpenter’s debut sets an early tone. It suggests that subtle humor and pop culture timing may matter just as much as spectacle when the biggest night in advertising finally arrives.","The full ad will build on the brand’s “Once You Pop, The Pop Don’t Stop’ campaign and air during the Big Game on Feb. 8, 2026.

The remark ignited debate over Diggs’ off-field baggage and celebrity dating choices. While opinions split sharply, the controversy continues to grow as neither Cardi B nor Diggs has addressed the uproar publicly.

Cardi B dating chatter erupts after Mariah Rose’s blunt message goes viral

Celebrity relationships often spark debate, but this one detonated online. As whispers grow louder about Cardi B spending time with NFL wide receiver Stefon Diggs , a sharp voice cut through the noise. It did not come from a rival artist or sports pundit. It came from Mariah Rose, whose blunt words instantly took over social feeds.The daughter of NBA legend Jalen Rose did not tiptoe around her opinion. As Cardi navigates life after her split from Offset, Mariah’s comment reframed the conversation. It shifted from curiosity to critique. Her post questioned power, self-worth, and why high-profile women so often absorb public baggage that is not theirs to carry.The line that fueled the fire landed hard and spread fast. Mariah wrote, “I mean no disrespect to Cardi B when I say this, I’m a fan of hers, but I always wonder when I see a rich, bad b*tch, dating an embarrassing man, like why she’s doing that to herself?” The quote struck a nerve because it echoed a familiar frustration among fans who see success collide with chaos.The reaction was not built on romance alone. Diggs’ off-field history quickly entered the spotlight. Critics cited background controversy and legal distortion, and frequent headlines that have accompanied him outside of football.To most of them, Mariah did not attack them personally. It was more of a broader cultural criticism of the dating habits of celebrities and the price of relationships in the marketplace.Diggs fans backfired, labeling the comments as intrusive and unfair. Some praised the sincerity as they claimed that when the decisions of the leaders are made public stories, they are open to scrutiny. The controversy was further expanded to issues of responsibility, reputation, and whether love is superior to stability.Neither Cardi B nor Diggs has responded, and the silence has only amplified the discussion. Without a statement, fans have filled the space with opinion and projection.What began as a rumored relationship has now become a flashpoint about standards, independence, and the pressure placed on women who succeed loudly. In the age of instant commentary, Mariah Rose did more than speak her mind. She changed the conversation.Also Read: “Be violent”: Stefon Diggs fuels Patriots with anti-media speech that raised eyebrows league-wide amid ongoing assault charges",Cardi B found herself at the center of a fierce online backlash after a viral comment targeting Stefon Diggs fueled criticism of their rumored relationship.

Gisele Bündchen draws a line between her private life and Tom Brady rumors

Away from the noise of celebrity gossip and dating rumors, Gisele Bündchen has chosen a quieter message to begin 2026. As speculation swirls around her former husband Tom Brady and his social life, Bündchen has shifted the focus back to gratitude, family, and personal growth. Her latest Instagram post did not chase headlines.The supermodel shared rare, intimate moments from the past year alongside her husband Joaquim Valente and her children, offering a grounded glimpse into her private world. The timing was notable. Brady has recently drawn attention after being spotted at a New Year’s Eve celebration in St. Barths with social media personality Alix Earle. While online chatter intensified, Bündchen’s post struck a completely different tone.Her message was reflective and deeply personal. She wrote, ""As the new year unfolds, my heart is full of gratitude for the moments spent recharging with my family. May this year bring you love, health, peace, and new adventures."" She followed that with a second line that felt like a personal compass. ""May you find the courage to honor your heart's calling and to know and love yourself more deeply.""ID@undefinedCaption not available.The images shared featured tender moments with her newborn son and her older children, Vivian Lake, 12, and Benjamin Rein, 15. Both are from her previous marriage to Brady. The contrast between her calm reflections and the speculation surrounding her ex was striking.Sources close to Brady have downplayed the St. Barths sightings, noting there is no serious relationship forming. Earle herself addressed the buzz lightly, posting, ""Rumor has it we're still dancing ... New friends, new memories, and new beginnings to start off the new year :) words can't describe how amazing this trip was."" The post came shortly after her December 2025 split from Braxton Berrios.Bündchen’s reflections went deeper than seasonal wishes. In a separate caption, she shared that becoming a mother again “reshaped everything, my time, my priorities, my heart.” That message made one thing clear. While rumors swirl elsewhere, her life now moves forward with intention, stability, and family at its center.Also Read: “My health….”: Gisele Bündchen hints at the emotional toll of loving Tom Brady and how it became a turning point in her life","Gisele Bündchen shared rare photos with her husband and children.

It like goes till here. So comfy. I have been wearing it since they sent it to me. They have a matching pair of sweats.

They wrote, “Sophie Cunningham in the house sitting courtside for tonight’s @pacers game ❤️‍🔥. ” The fact that they posted the picture might indicate an extended time of Sophie’s with the team.","Sophie Cunningham gives a major shoutout to her friend’s ventures, Tribe Kelly and Verso l’alto.

New York Knicks injury update on Jalen Brunson's status



Jalen Brunson candidly shared his success with the New York Knicks



The New York Knicks face an immediate test on the road as they prepare for a demanding stretch without their floor general. Jalen Brunson was ruled out of Thursday night’s matchup against the Golden State Warriors after suffering a right ankle sprain in Sacramento. The injury came early, cutting short his night and shifting the tone of a back-to-back swing that already carried little margin for error.New York enters the Warriors game at 25-15, still near the top of the Eastern Conference standings. Brunson’s absence forces rotation changes against Golden State, while the Knicks weigh caution with their most important scorer and leader.The Knicks labeled Jalen Brunson as day-to-day, signaling optimism that the sprain is not severe. He exited Wednesday’s loss to the Kings at the 7:01 mark of the first quarter after planting his right foot while dribbling. The non-contact nature raised concern, though the team ruled him out at halftime rather than immediately.This marks another chapter in a familiar issue. Brunson missed two games earlier this season with a right ankle sprain and sat out nearly a month late last year after injuring the same ankle.Despite that history, New York has not indicated a long-term shutdown. The next opportunity for his return comes Saturday when the Knicks host the Phoenix Suns, though no firm timeline has been confirmed.Without Brunson, Miles McBride and rookie Tyler Kolek are expected to see expanded roles in the backcourt. The Knicks will also be without Mitchell Robinson due to injury management, while Landry Shamet remains sidelined with a shoulder sprain.Brunson’s importance to New York is reflected in his production. The All-Star guard is averaging a career-best 28.9 points and 6.3 assists, ranking among the league’s top scorers and earning recent Eastern Conference Player of the Month honors. He has also been the NBA’s reigning Clutch Player of the Year, often closing games that hinge on execution.Before the injury, Brunson spoke about what drives him at this stage of his career. “Success obviously now is that I want to win. That's how I define success I want to win,” he said. That mindset has helped steady the Knicks through pressure-filled moments in a demanding market.He has also pointed to the values that guide him. “What do I take pride in? Honestly, my work ethic I think can translate not just on the court but in life, and that's what I try to do with my foundation, and that's how I want to raise my kids as well,” Brunson stated.For now, New York’s priority is health. The Knicks will monitor Brunson closely, knowing the season’s direction often follows the availability of their captain.Also Read: Golden State Warriors vs New York Knicks (01-15-2026) game preview: When and where to watch, expected lineup, injury report, prediction, and more","Jalen Brunson was ruled out of Thursday night’s matchup against the Golden State Warriors.

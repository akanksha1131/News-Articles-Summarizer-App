GM Raunak Sadhwani Exclusive: Becoming Grandmaster at 13, hidden costs of the game, and more #chess





Seven-time Grand Slam singles champion Venus Williams will make a remarkable return to Melbourne Park after being handed a wildcard for the Australian Open, becoming the oldest woman ever to compete in the season-opening major.Tournament organisers confirmed on Friday that the 45-year-old American will feature in the main draw for the first time since 2021, marking her 22nd Australian Open appearance and her first at the venue in five years.“I’m excited to be back in Australia and looking forward to competing during the Australian summer,” Williams said. “I’ve had so many incredible memories there, and I’m grateful for the opportunity to return to a place that has meant so much to my career.”Williams first played at the Australian Open in 1998, famously defeating younger sister Serena in the second round before losing to Lindsay Davenport in the quarterfinals. She has since compiled a 54–21 win-loss record at Melbourne Park and finished runner-up twice, losing to Serena in the finals in 2003 and 2017.The five-time Wimbledon champion and two-time US Open winner will surpass the previous age record held by Japan’s Kimiko Date, who competed at the Australian Open aged 44 in 2015.Williams is set to begin her Australian summer swing at the Auckland Classic next week, where she has also received a wildcard, before playing in Hobart ahead of the January 18–February 1 Grand Slam. She returned to competitive tennis at last year’s US Open following a 16-month absence from the tour.A four-time Australian Open doubles champion, Williams continues to defy time and expectations. In a personal milestone, she married Danish-born model and actor Andrea Preti in late December in Florida.",Venus Williams has been handed a wildcard for the Australian Open.

Why Mumbai's iconic Azad Maidan is no longer safe for cricket | Bombay Sport Exchange

Your maiden List A hundred came in a win. How special was it for you?

With no Tests scheduled for the next seven months, how will you stay ready for red-ball cricket?

Your form has sparked talk of an India call-up in white-ball cricket...

What has it been like playing under UP captain

?

Dhruv Jurel’s maiden List A century — an unbeaten 160 off 101 balls against Baroda in Rajkot on Dec 29 — has come at a time when India are set to play a three-match home ODI series against New Zealand. The Uttar Pradesh wicketkeeperbatter’s form has pushed him into the selection conversation. Jurel has begun the Vijay Hazare Trophy by scoring 307 runs in three matches at an average of 153.5.Winning is what matters. All 11 players work towards one goal. Every contribution counts — someone scoring 30 off 15 balls can be as valuable as someone scoring 100. Matches are won through team effort, so I’m very happy.I’m always excited to play red-ball cricket and am very fortunate to have played Tests for India. Test cricket has its own value. When you go abroad and people call you a Test cricketer, it feels good. Red-ball is close to my heart and brings a different kind of respect. I’m already thinking about our series in Sri Lanka in 7-8 months, how I can prepare, the sessions we get with spinners, how I can tackle spin better. These little things — the planning and visualisation — keep going on.I don’t set too many goals for myself. I focus on the process. Even before the Vijay Hazare Trophy, when I got some time, I was batting for 4-5 hours and creating scenarios in my mind about what I can do. Whatever the result and selection may be, no one can take my hard work away from me. That’s why I work hard. It has brought me this far and will take me further.It has been very good. I’ve watched him since childhood. He is one of India’s best finishers. I try to learn from him. There is good energy around Rinku bhai.",Dhruv Jurel scored his maiden List A century against Baroda in Rajkot on Dec 29.

With an eye on Los Angeles three years from now, a crucial Olympic cycle unfolds for India from the New Year onwards. Keeping in mind a busy, demanding 2026 for Indian sportspersons across major disciplines — culminating in the Asian Games in Aichi and Nagoya in Sept-Oct — TOI draws up a line-up of young, hungry aspirants who could be forces to reckon with this year.Hitesh Gulia is increasingly being viewed as the standard-bearer for Indian men’s boxing heading into a crucial Olympic cycle, with the Asian Games headlining the events next year. The 20-year-old 70kg boxer from Haryana emerged as India’s brightest male prospect on the international stage in 2025, delivering a season that combined consistency, composure and an unmistakable sense of arrival. Gulia stamped his authority across the World Boxing Cup circuit, with the defining moment coming at the seasonending Finals, where he clinched gold in front of the home crowd. Navigating a field stacked with experienced campaigners from Europe and Central Asia, he showcased tactical maturity beyond his years, blending sharp counter-punching with disciplined defence — reinforcing his ability to deliver under pressure.Earlier in the season, Gulia served notice of his international credentials by winning gold at the World Boxing Cup Stage I in Foz do Iguaçu, Brazil. That triumph, achieved in unfamiliar conditions and against physically imposing opponents, was widely seen as a breakthrough moment.At Stage II of the World Boxing Cup in Astana, Kazakhstan, Gulia added a silver medal to his tally, narrowly missing out on a second consecutive title. As 2026 approaches, with the Commonwealth Games and Asian Games looming large, Gulia’s upward trajectory places him firmly at the centre of India’s medal ambitions. If 2025 was about validation, the year ahead offers him a platform to translate promise into sustained excellence on the biggest stages.In 2025, Indian long jumper Shaili Singh staged a notable comeback. After setbacks that included missing qualification for the Paris Olympics and a careerthreatening injury, the 21-year-old from Jhansi returned to top form. Her comeback gained momentum at the Federation Cup in Ernakulam in April, where she produced a standout performance and drew widespread attention as she broke the meet record held by her mentor, Anju Bobby George, leaping 6.64m to better Anju’s 2002 mark of 6.59m.Ranked among the world’s top 20 under-21 long jumpers, Shaili is viewed as one of India’s strongest medal prospects for the Asian Games in 2026. Her next major goal is the national record of 6.83m set by Anju, and to qualify for the 2028 Olympics. “I’ll be looking to qualify for Los Angeles, which will be my main focus. I don’t want to make any mistakes,” she said.If 2025 belonged to any Indian boxer, it was unquestionably Jaismine Lamboria. The 57kg featherweight, competing in one of the toughest Olympic divisions, turned the year into a catalogue of triumphs and consistency that underlined her rise as India’s most distinguished female pugilist on the international stage. The 24-year-old’s crowning achievement came at the World Boxing Championships in Liverpool, where she claimed gold with a series of authoritative performances. Against a field packed with Olympic medallists and world champions, Jaismine displayed remarkable ring intelligence, controlling distance with her footwork and punishing openings with precise combinations. The title not only marked a personal milestone but also signalled India’s growing depth in women’s boxing at the elite level.Jaismine’s dominance extended to the World Boxing Cup circuit. At Astana’s Stage II, she showcased adaptability and endurance to clinch gold, thriving in a demanding environment against physically strong opponents. She capped off a stellar year by winning another gold at the World Boxing Cup Finals in Greater Noida, delivering under the pressure of expectations on home soil. What made her success even more remarkable was the category she ruled. The 57kg class, steeped in international depth, has long demanded exceptional all-round skill and adaptability. Jaismine met that challenge with a maturity that reflected her evolution. As India looks ahead to the Commonwealth Games and Asian Games in 2026, Jaismine emerges as the fulcrum of the women’s boxing programme. If 2025 was about establishing supremacy, the year ahead offers her the opportunity to convert dominance into multi-sport Games glory.Shahnawaz Khan became the 12th Indian man to clear the eight-metre barrier in long jump when he leapt 8.04m at the Indian Open, a World Athletics Bronze-level meet in Bhubaneswar in August. The effort also made him the youngest Indian to achieve the mark. With his career gaining momentum, Khan is now targeting the Asian Games and aiming to raise his level on the international stage. Known for his agility and sound technique, he has mapped out an intensive 2026 training plan to add distance, sharpen consistency, and improve competitiveness against elite fields.“At the world level, 8m doesn’t mean much. Maybe it’s a big deal because I’m a junior. But my aim is to cross the 8.50 mark. I don’t know whether I’ll be able to achieve it this year, but it is one of my main targets in the future,” said the 17-year-old boy from Madhaipur village in Uttar Pradesh’s Pratapgarh district. Progress has been steady. He won gold at the 38th National Games in February with 7.70m, then claimed another at the Junior Federation Cup in June. His tall, muscular frame gives him explosive take-off power, helping him stand out among many leaner rivals. Shahnawaz draws inspiration from his uncle Mohammad Hadees, a former national-level javelin thrower. After Shahnawaz lost his father to cancer at age 10 in 2018, Hadees became a key support. In a key move, in 2020, he helped the nephew secure admission to Panvel’s SAI centre.With stalwart PR Sreejesh calling time on his illustrious career after the Paris Olympics, the No. 16 jersey in India’s senior men’s hockey team has been retired. In the junior ranks, however, Princedeep Singh, another No. 16, has emerged as a goalkeeper who is showing promise of stepping into those giant shoes. The Pathankot-born custodian has impressed over the past year with performances that suggest he is prepared for the next step. Pushing senior goalkeepers Kishan Pathak and Suraj Karkera, Prince has shown composure and maturity beyond his years.Trained under the watchful eyes of Sreejesh — now the junior team’s chief coach — his game reflects the hallmarks of his mentor: sharp communication, sound judgment of angles, and an ability to thrive under pressure. The traits were on display at Chennai’s Junior World Cup, where Prince played a pivotal role, particularly in the penalty shootout win over Belgium that took India into the semifinals. With the senior setup in transition, 2026 could mark Princedeep’s arrival on the bigger stage.By beating PV Sindhu in the prequarterfinals of the China Open in July this year, Unnati Hooda gave indications of a change of guard in Indian badminton. It was the first time in six years that the peerless Sindhu had lost to an Indian shuttler. Of course, everyone sat up to take notice. The 18-year-old Unnati finished her maiden year on the senior Badminton World Federation circuit with a ranking of 23, five spots below Sindhu.Unnati started playing badminton at the age of eight at Rohtak’s Chhotu Ram Stadium, an arena known more for producing wrestlers. Today, she trains at the Hooda Academy in her hometown, which was established by her father, Upkar Hooda. An aggressive shuttler who likes to dictate points against her rival, Unnati played a crucial role in India’s bronzemedal finish at the World Junior Team Championships in Oct and bagged the Odisha Masters Super 100 title. She will have to shore up her net play to get the better of the best as the badminton circuit gets more demanding.“I think there should be a mix of both attacking and patient play. But I have to think when to attack and when to play patiently,” she had said. Her performances in next year’s Asian Games in Japan and the World Championships in Delhi next year will define her future career, but how busy things will get from now on for the youngster can be seen up close with the Indian Open in the capital from early January onwards.When they began saying that Indian badminton, after over a decade of being among India’s top sports, was headed for a long slump, they had not accounted for the likes of Unnati Hooda, Charishma Tamiri, and Tanvi Sharma. The first Indian to win two medals in a single edition of the World Junior Championship, the baby-faced Tanvi has emerged as India’s most promising shuttler on the junior circuit, having risen to a world ranking of 42.But 2026 will be a different kettle of fish for the 17-year-old, her prime challenge being to translate those performances to the senior circuit. Trained by renowned coach Park Tae-sang, Tanvi already showed signs of her potential when she beat former world No. 1 Nozomi Okuhara at the Syed Modi International earlier this year. A huge PV Sindhu fan, Tanvi understands the scope of improvement in her game.“I will have to work on my fitness, court endurance and net skills to go to the next level because playing at the highest level is not easy,” she says. The 17-year-old has a remarkable ability to hit sideline smashes and has a good backcourt game. But having lost three finals in 2025, the girl from Punjab will have to improve her big-match temperament if she hopes to continue her upward climb, knowing well how a nation that has learnt to follow and love badminton over the years will be looking at her to deliver.Treesa Jolly and Gayatri Gopichand didn’t have the best year in 2025, as a string of mixed results and a shoulder injury to the latter laid them low. However, by claiming the Syed Modi Open women’s doubles title — their third BWF crown towards the end of the year — the two 22-year-olds showed they are getting back to their best and are now placed 20th in the world rankings.“We are combining well, and the understanding we share is the mantra behind our success,” says Gayatri. Having been on the circuit for over four years, the fire-and-ice combo of Indian badminton faces a make-orbreak year ahead and would like to emulate the success of their compatriots on the men’s tour, Satwiksairaj Rankireddy and Chirag Shetty.As the men’s hockey team sets its sights on a hat-trick of podium finishes at the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics, a realignment of talent and strategy has become imperative. The midfield is where India’s transition could prove most defining, especially with Hockey India looking beyond Manpreet Singh, who has held fort for almost 15 years. In that context, 20-year-old Manmeet Singh and Rosan Kujur are potential long-term answers.Manmeet’s strength lies in his defensive work and ability to break opposition momentum, while Kujur, 21, offers greater ball-carrying ability. Together, they represent the kind of balanced midfield profiles that India needs. The challenge over the next cycle will be to blend experience with emerging talent — and if the early signs are any indication, the next generation appears ready to shoulder the responsibility.With the average age of the Indian shooting team shrinking by around eight years in the last decade, a teenager winning worldlevel medals has become the norm. Yet, a shooter with the spark of a youngster and the consistency of a veteran is still a delight whenever it is discovered. Haryana’s Suruchi Phogat has been one such discovery in 2025. The 18-yearold shooter made her senior international debut by winning gold in the women’s 10m air pistol at the Buenos Aires World Cup. Her first medal, a gold, came after beating double Olympic champion Jiang Ranxin of China.That Suruchi didn’t wish to be a onetime wonder is evident from the way the soft-spoken shooter won three more gold and a bronze at the World Cups. She concluded her year with another gold at the ISSF World Cup Finals in Dec. Suruchi first aspired to be a wrestler — an obvious choice for a girl who hails from Jhajjar in Haryana. Her father, Inder Singh, took voluntary retirement from the army to look after his children’s training. Suruchi’s brother is also a shooter.As 2026 approaches, the Indian pistol team will face a problem of plenty, with many contenders in the fray — especially when Olympic quotas will be at stake. With shooters like Suruchi setting the bar higher with each performance, her competitors cannot afford to put their feet up.Before November, not many had heard of Samrat Rana. The Karnal shooter made sure his name would be remembered by becoming the first-ever pistol world champion in the Olympics category with a coveted gold in the Cairo World Championships. Samrat’s 10m air pistol gold on debut was remarkable for the way he shot, nailing the toughest targets under pressure.Samrat, 20, defeated arguably the best shooter of the year, Hu Kai of China, who has won individual gold in all four editions of the World Cup this year, along with an Asian Championship gold and two mixed-team golds in World Cups. Hu concluded the year by winning gold at the World Cup Finals in Doha. Pertinently, the only silver he won this year was in the World Championships, behind Samrat by 0.3 points.Samrat, who started shooting six years ago, trains at a modest range built by his father. The youngster proved his Cairo gold wasn’t a fluke by winning bronze at the World Cup Finals. Samrat’s arrival on the international scene has strengthened India’s men’s pistol team that once was strongest courtesy of Saurabh Chaudhary and Abhishek Varma, who had ruled the world stage. Following their decline in form, Varun Tomar has been the only consistent name for India. If this young duo holds its ground, India will have a strong men’s 10m air pistol team for the Los Angeles Games in 2028.",Hitesh Gulia is increasingly being viewed as the standard-bearer for Indian men’s boxing heading into a crucial Olympic cycle.

Player of the match:





Abu Dhabi Knight Riders kept their ILT20 Season 4 campaign alive with a commanding 50-run win over Dubai Capitals in the Eliminator at the Dubai International Stadium on Thursday.A blistering opening stand between Michael Pepper and Phil Salt set the tone before the Knight Riders’ spinners took complete control, ensuring the Capitals never found a way back after the early damage.The victory sets up a Qualifier 2 clash against MI Emirates on Friday, with a spot in Sunday’s final against Desert Vipers on the line.Pepper continued his rich vein of form, registering his second successive half-century. He top-scored with 72 from 49 deliveries, striking seven fours and three sixes. Alongside Salt, who contributed 43 off 34 balls, Pepper powered the Knight Riders through a 122-run opening partnership in just 81 balls. The Capitals hit back late, claiming seven wickets for 36 runs to restrict the total to 158 for 7, but it proved more than enough.Dubai’s chase unravelled quickly under relentless pressure. Jason Holder struck in the second over to remove Toby Albert before Ajay Kumar followed up by dismissing Jordan Cox. Sunil Narine then tightened the screws, trapping Shayan Jahangir lbw and bowling Navin Bidaisee with a trademark delivery, leaving the Capitals four down inside the powerplay and already behind the required rate.Narine struck again to remove Gulbadin Naib, and the squeeze only intensified when Liam Livingstone had Rovman Powell caught in the deep. With just 16 runs coming between overs seven and ten, and wickets falling at regular intervals, the Capitals limped to 64 for 6 at halfway, the chase already slipping out of reach.The end came swiftly. Livingstone removed James Neesham and David Willey in quick succession before Holder delivered the decisive blows in the 16th over, dismissing Mohammad Nabi and then trapping Muhammad Jawadullah first ball. The Capitals were eventually bundled out for 108, never threatening to bridge the gap.Earlier, after choosing to bat, the Knight Riders exploded out of the blocks. Pepper was particularly severe in the powerplay, peppering the boundary as the pair raced to 55 without loss. While Salt played a steadier role, Pepper surged to a 36-ball fifty, and the duo brought up their second straight century stand when Salt cleared long-on to reach 100 in just 70 balls.The innings took a dramatic turn once Salt fell in the 14th over. From 122 without loss, the Knight Riders suddenly lost five wickets for eight runs, with Pepper run out after a mix-up and Andre Russell dismissed soon after. Nabi and Waqar Salamkheil added to the collapse, reducing the Knight Riders to 130 for 5.Holder’s calm presence at the end proved vital. The captain struck an unbeaten 22 off 11 balls, including a productive final over, to lift the total to 158 for 7 — a score that the Knight Riders’ bowlers and spinners then defended with authority.Player of the match Sunil Narine said, “Winning games changes everything—it means a lot. We haven’t made the playoffs in three years, and that’s something we’ve been pushing hard for. It’s emotional because we’ve played good cricket before without getting the results.”Dubai Capitals’ skipper Mohammad Nabi said, “At one point it looked like they might get close to 200, but we did well to pull things back with the ball. With the bat, though, we weren’t good enough as a unit. There wasn’t excessive turn, but they bowled very well to their areas. The plan was to rotate strike and avoid early wickets, but it didn’t come off.”(Michael Pepper 72, Phil Salt 43, Jason Holder 22 not out, Mohammad Nabi 3 for 25, Waqar Salamkheil 1 for 25)(Mohammad Nabi 27, James Neesham 19, Sunil Narine 3 for 12, Jason Holder 3 for 18, Liam Livingstone 3 for 26)Sunil Narine","Abu Dhabi Knight Riders beat Dubai Capitals by 50 runs in the ILT20 Season 4 Eliminator.

'If they get pummelled…': Ex-England captain issues warning for Ben Stokes and Brendon McCullum ahead of Sydney Test,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/ashes/if-they-get-pummelled-ex-england-captain-issues-warning-for-ben-stokes-and-brendon-mccullum-ahead-of-sydney-test/articleshow/126288390.cms,"England's captain Ben Stokes shakes hands with teammate Shoaib Bashir (AP Photo/Gary Day)

India can survive without Virat and Rohit, not without Bumrah





Former England captain Michael Vaughan has described England’s Boxing Day Test victory at the Melbourne Cricket Ground as a “lottery”, insisting the result should not be used as a benchmark for judging the success of the current Brendon McCullum–Ben Stokes regime. Writing in the Sydney Morning Herald, Vaughan said England must now avoid a heavy defeat in the fifth and final Ashes Test in Sydney if the leadership group is to emerge from the tour without serious scrutiny.England had already conceded the Ashes after losing the first three Tests of the series before producing a surprise win in Melbourne. The match, however, was played on a highly bowler-friendly surface, saw all 36 wickets fall to pace, and was wrapped up inside two days, prompting Vaughan to question its value as a proper Test contest.Josh Tongue starred for England at the MCG, finishing with match figures of 7 for 89, including 5-45 in the first innings. His effort made him the first England bowler in the 21st century to claim a five-wicket haul in a Boxing Day Test at Melbourne.The victory also ended England’s long wait for success in Australia, marking their first Test win Down Under since 2011 and snapping a drought that stretched beyond 5,000 days. Under head coach Brendon McCullum , England have now won 25 Tests and lost 17 from 45 matches.Despite acknowledging the significance of the Melbourne result, Vaughan said the upcoming Sydney Test carries far greater weight, arguing that England must prove they can win a full, competitive game of Test cricket.“I think it's a massive game for England [in Sydney]. It's nice to win a game of cricket, but let's be honest, it was a complete lottery in Melbourne. It wasn't a proper game of Test match cricket. For the future and for this management in particular, they need to win a strong game of cricket here ... that's not a two-dayer,” Vaughan said, as quoted by the Sydney Morning Herald.Vaughan suggested that while Stokes and McCullum are likely to continue in their roles, a strong showing in Sydney is necessary to remove any lingering doubt. He warned that a heavy loss would trigger difficult internal discussions.“For this management to carry on, the likes of Ben and Baz – I'm pretty sure they will carry on – but I think they need a good week for that to be absolutely rock solid. There's a huge appetite within the group to keep [McCullum] on. But fundamentally, if they get pummelled in Sydney, there needs to be some honest conversations,” he added.The former skipper also urged England to avoid knee-jerk changes after the tour but stressed the importance of owning up to their mistakes. According to Vaughan, denying flaws would pose a greater long-term problem than poor results.“I think chopping and changing is not necessarily the right thing for English cricket. Whatever happens at the end of this tour, they've got to accept that they got a lot of things wrong. If they're going to be so stubborn to think that they were a bit unlucky, or things didn't quite go the way they wanted ... well, we have a problem going forward. The key is maturity and that's the one thing that I think this team can be a lot better at, in terms of the way they play and talk. If they can accept that, I have no problem with the management staying the same,” Vaughan said.",Michael Vaughan says England's Boxing Day Test victory at the MCG was a 'lottery' Former skipper says England must avoid a heavy defeat in the fifth and final Ashes Test in Sydney.

Can Virat Kohli chase down Sachin Tendulkar's hundred hundreds?





Travis Head’s rise as an all-format force has made him one of Australia’s most reliable match-winners and one of the most recognisable faces in world cricket. Set to feature in all five Ashes Tests, the left-hander has topped the run charts and heads into 2026 after an especially demanding 2025, a workload that could see him step back from parts of the domestic calendar as the year progresses.The Big Bash League is the first commitment Head appears likely to sacrifice. The Australian batter has admitted that January may need to be reserved for recovery, with the T20 World Cup in India looming next month and the IPL scheduled soon after. That combination of major tournaments has prompted him to reassess how much cricket his body and mind can realistically absorb.Head has acknowledged that being fully involved throughout the Ashes, even with Australia’s dominance early in the series and relatively short matches, has taken its toll both physically and mentally.“Probably unlikely with the emotional drain of an Ashes series, and what’s coming up in terms of the World Cup,” Head told the Daily Telegraph when asked about turning out for the Adelaide Strikers this BBL season.The Strikers have made a steady start to their campaign with two wins from four matches, but the absence of their marquee batter would still be a blow. Head’s experience and aggression at the top of the order would have been invaluable, yet with the T20 World Cup approaching and a key role awaiting him at the top alongside captain Mitch Marsh, international priorities appear to have taken precedence.Reflecting on his Ashes performances, Head underlined the emotional intensity of the series. “You go into every series wanting to have a good contribution. I felt like I’ve been close to that and played really well. And the emotional drain of actually being in an Ashes series and playing it is always tough,” he said.After beginning the series batting at number five, Head has since moved to the top of the order alongside Jake Weatherald, a shift that has done nothing to slow his scoring rate. He has already piled up 437 runs in the series, highlighted by centuries in Perth and at his home ground, the Adelaide Oval.Beyond his own schedule, Head also raised broader concerns about player workload as the calendar becomes increasingly congested due to the expansion of franchise cricket and shrinking windows for international fixtures.“So I think it’s important to go into a World Cup fresh, but we’ll see where we get to though. It’s a concern with how much we’ve already been playing and how much time we’ve got on the road,” he said.Looking ahead, Head is keen to spend some time at home before an extended stint in India with both Australia and Sunrisers Hyderabad. Family considerations are becoming more central as well, particularly with another ODI World Cup cycle approaching in 2027.“You look at that year with the young family as well … my mind’s more so with my family. How can I make that year work?” Head said, underlining the balancing act facing modern-day cricketers.",Travis Head has scored 437 runs in the Ashes so far.

'Slow death' – R Ashwin's chilling warning on ODI cricket after Virat Kohli-Rohit Sharma era,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/slow-death-r-ashwins-chilling-warning-on-odi-cricket-after-virat-kohli-rohit-sharma-era/articleshow/126286217.cms,"Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli (ANI)

Can Virat Kohli chase down Sachin Tendulkar's hundred hundreds?

Ash Ki Baat





Former India off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin has raised serious doubts over the long-term future of One-Day International cricket, warning that the format could struggle to survive beyond the 2027 World Cup once Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma step away.Ashwin acknowledged the excitement generated by Kohli and Rohit’s recent appearances in the Vijay Hazare Trophy but pointed out that the growing dominance of T20 leagues, coupled with Test cricket’s enduring value, is steadily squeezing the space available for 50-over cricket.“I am not sure about future of ODI after 2027 World Cup. I am a little worried about it. Of course, I am following Vijay Hazare Trophy but the manner in which I followed SMAT, I am finding slightly difficult to follow,” Ashwin said on his Hindi YouTube channelHe stressed that audience preference can no longer be ignored while shaping the game’s future. “Also, we need to know what audience wants to watch. I feel Test cricket still has space but ODI cricket, I truly feel it doesn’t have the space,” he said, offering a blunt assessment of the format’s current standing.Ashwin, India’s second-highest wicket-taker across formats with 765 dismissals, underlined how heavily ODI cricket still leans on the presence of its biggest stars.With Kohli and Rohit sharing 86 ODI centuries between them, their influence remains central to the format’s relevance.“Look, Rohit and Virat came back to Vijay Hazare Trophy and people started watching it. We have known that sport is always bigger than individuals but at times these players need to come back to make the game relevant,” he observed.Referring to domestic one-day cricket, Ashwin added, “Vijay Hazare Trophy, of course, is a domestic competition that not a lot of people follow, but they did because Virat and Rohit were playing. Even then, what happens when they stop playing ODIs?”Ashwin also spoke about how the nature of ODI batting has shifted dramatically under the influence of T20 cricket. He recalled a time when the format allowed players to build innings patiently, citing MS Dhoni as the perfect example.“One-day cricket, once upon a time, was an amazing format because it gave a player like MS Dhoni who would take singles for 10-15 overs before he went berserk at the end,” he said.According to Ashwin, that style has all but disappeared. “You don’t have players like that anymore and there isn’t any requirement to play like that, as you are playing with two new balls and five fielders inside circle,” he said, describing modern ODIs as being played in just two extremes, either all-out attacking or complete collapse on tougher pitches.Turning his attention to the international calendar, Ashwin urged the ICC to rethink its approach, while acknowledging the importance of revenue for the sport’s sustainability.“The ODI format has become redundant and to top it, ICC needs to see how they are conducting these World Cups. Every year, there is an ICC tournament for revenue generation pattern, but then look at how FIFA is doing it,” he said.He compared cricket unfavourably with football’s global structure. “There are leagues happening and they do their World Cup once in every four years. The World Cup is having value as it’s a marquee tournament. Too many bilaterals, too many formats, too many World Cups, so it’s a little bit of an overkill,” Ashwin added.Ashwin also suggested that certain match-ups in the upcoming T20 World Cup, such as India facing USA or Namibia, could risk alienating viewers rather than attracting them.When asked about possible solutions, Ashwin offered a stark proposal for preserving ODI cricket’s relevance. “If you really want to make ODI cricket relevant, then just play these leagues and play ODI World Cup once in four years, so when people turn up for events, there will be sense of expectation,” he said.Summing up his concerns, Ashwin concluded with a grim warning for the format’s future. “I feel it is going towards slow death.”","Ravichandran Ashwin has raised serious doubts over the long-term future of One- Day International cricket.

Australia squad for fifth Ashes Test:





Australia have named a 15-member squad for the fifth and final Ashes Test against England, set to begin on January 4 at the Sydney Cricket Ground, as confirmed by cricket.com.au. Steve Smith will continue to lead the side in the absence of Pat Cummins. The regular captain missed the opening two Tests of the series after failing to recover in time from a lower back injury. Cummins returned for the Adelaide Test, where he resumed captaincy and helped Australia secure the Ashes on home soil. However, the team management has now opted to rest the fast bowler for the remainder of the series.The decision has been taken to carefully manage Cummins’ workload and ensure he remains fully fit ahead of the ICC T20 World Cup 2026, which will be hosted by India and Sri Lanka. Cummins has been named in Australia’s provisional squad for the global tournament.Usman Khawaja has also retained his place in the squad despite ongoing speculation surrounding his Test future. The 39-year-old began the series as Australia’s established opener but has endured a disrupted campaign. He was unable to bat in the second innings of the Perth Test due to back spasms, missed the Brisbane Test altogether, and was initially left out for Adelaide before being recalled to bat at number four following Steven Smith’s illness.In the fourth Test, Khawaja continued in the middle order alongside Travis Head and Jack Weatherald, scoring 29 in the first innings before being dismissed for a duck in the second. Across the series so far, he has accumulated 153 runs from three matches and five innings at an average of 30.60, with his only half-century coming in Adelaide.Steve Smith (captain), Scott Boland, Alex Carey, Brendan Doggett, Cameron Green, Travis Head, Josh Inglis, Usman Khawaja, Marnus Labuschagne, Todd Murphy, Michael Neser, Jhye Richardson, Mitchell Starc, Jake Weatherald, Beau Webster.Australia head into the Sydney Test looking to respond after a four-wicket defeat to Ben Stokes’ England in the Boxing Day Test at Melbourne.",Australia have named a 15-member squad for the fifth and final Ashes Test against England.

Kohli struck scores of 131 and 77 in successive innings, reaffirming his class and enduring hunger for runs.Those performances also saw him create history in List A cricket, as he became the fastest batter to reach 16,000 runs, eclipsing a long-standing record held by Sachin Tendulkar.

Sunrisers Eastern Cape:

Paarl Royals:





Paarl Royals captain David Miller spoiled the Sunrisers Eastern Cape’s New Year’s Eve celebrations with a captain’s knock that delivered his side their first win of SA20 Season 4 at St George’s Park on Tuesday.Chasing a modest target of 150, the Royals found themselves in serious trouble early as Marco Jansen and Anrich Nortje tore through the top order. Jansen reached a milestone during the spell, becoming the first bowler to claim 50 wickets in SA20 history. Paarl slipped to 35 for four, with Lhuan-dre Pretorius, Asa Tribe, Rubin Hermann and Kyle Verreynne all dismissed cheaply.With the chase threatening to unravel, Miller produced a masterclass in composure and controlled aggression. The left-hander anchored the innings with an unbeaten 71 off just 38 balls, timing his acceleration to perfection. He found a reliable partner in rising star Keagan Lion-Cachet, who played a crucial supporting role with a mature 45 off 40 deliveries.The pair stitched together a match-turning 114-run partnership for the fifth wicket, steadily draining the pressure from the Sunrisers. Lion-Cachet fell late in the chase, but Miller ensured there were no further hiccups.Drama lingered until the final moments, with the St George’s Park crowd hoping for a Super Over. Those hopes were dashed when Lewis Gregory bowled a costly wide, sealing the Royals’ victory with two balls to spare.Earlier, Paarl’s bowlers had laid the platform, led by teenage sensation Nqobani Mokoena. In just his second SA20 appearance, the 19-year-old seamer delivered career-best figures of 4/34, including the prized wicket of Quinton de Kock during the Powerplay. Ottneil Baartman complemented him well, returning figures of 3/36 against his former side.Jonny Bairstow (33) and Jordan Hermann (47) offered resistance for the Sunrisers, but regular wickets restricted them to 149 all out. Despite the loss, Sunrisers remain top of the table on 10 points, while the Royals climbed off the bottom with a timely win.149 all out in 19.4 overs (Jordan Hermann 47; Nqobani Mokoena 4/34, Ottneil Baartman 3/36)150 for 5 in 19.4 overs (David Miller 71 not out, Keagan Lion-Cachet 45; Anrich Nortje 2/21, Marco Jansen 2/25)",Paarl Royals beat Sunrisers Eastern Cape by two wickets on New Year's Eve.

The club issued a statement on Wednesday revealing the diagnosis following medical tests, adding that his condition will be monitored over the coming days.The Spanish giants did not provide a clear timeline for the 27-year-old forward’s return. However, a source close to the France international told AFP that Mbappe is expected to be sidelined for a minimum of three weeks.Mbappe’s injury places his availability in serious doubt for Sunday’s home league fixture against Real Betis, Madrid’s first match after the winter break. Carlo Ancelotti’s side currently sit four points behind Barcelona in the title race. The forward could also miss the Spanish Super Cup semi-final against Atletico Madrid in Saudi Arabia on January 8, along with a league encounter against Levante and a Champions League meeting with his former club Monaco.Real Madrid have not disclosed when or how the injury occurred. Mbappe was involved in full training with the squad on Tuesday before undergoing an MRI scan the following day.The setback comes after an exceptional year for Mbappe. In 2025, he matched Cristiano Ronaldo ’s club record of 59 goals in a calendar year and has often been the driving force behind Madrid’s performances, easing pressure on head coach Xabi Alonso.Since arriving on a free transfer from Paris Saint-Germain 18 months ago, Mbappe has scored 73 goals in 83 appearances for the club.He finished last season as La Liga’s leading scorer with 31 goals, four more than Barcelona striker Robert Lewandowski . This campaign, he already has 18 league goals and holds a seven-goal advantage over Barcelona’s Ferran Torres.Mbappe’s absence further compounds Real Madrid’s injury concerns.

RAW TALENTFancy a swig of raw milk? Good for your gut, and legs it seems. Head too. It’s superfood, just ask Super Haaland. He loves to visit a Cheshire farm to get his locally sourced bottles. And as you know, he rarely bottles up in front of goal – scoring 25 times in his 23 matches for City so far.

PSG’s success story in 2025 is one to behold -- How Luis Enrique rebooted the continent’s nearly men into European champions with discipline, teamwork, tactics, belief while deleting the individualist approach.All for one and one for all, Luis’ musketeers reeled in trophy after trophy but there was one battle PSG lost, to former talisman Kylian Mbappe, in the boardroom and the courtroom. In this sabre fencing, Paris employed the slashing technique, cutting off the Frenchman’s salary that included a so-called ‘ethics bonus’. Mad in Madrid, Mbappe’s riposte was of the legal kind. After the back and forth, the court ruled that the former employers pay up unpaid wages of 60m euros. Back in Spain, Mbappe earned some Real love from the Bernabeu faithful, after scoring 59 goals in 59 games, equaling his ‘hero’ Cristiano Ronaldo’s record, the most in a calendar year. How did he celebrate it? Siuuuuu…NO FAN’S LANDThe Big Leagues’ global expansion was put on hold.

The league had also chartered planes to take around 2,000 to 3,000 Villarreal fans to the US of A. In Oct, there were league-wide protests, stopping active play to express displeasure. Ultimately, Tebas had to bow down as organisers pulled out. Last week, a high-profile plan to stage a Serie A match -- AC Milan vs. Como -- in Perth was scrapped.DIAMONDS ARE FOREVEROne of the most viral pics of 2025 was of Georgina Rodriguez’s oversized diamond engagement ring reported to be valued between $2 and 5m, the kind of flashy display that one can associate with her fiancé Cristiano Ronaldo.

Ryan Rickelton press conference: 'Been tough last couple of months mentally in India'

Florian Wirtz's first Liverpool goal fired the Reds into the Premier League 's top four despite an unconvincing 2-1 win over Wolves on a day both clubs paid tribute to Diogo Jota . Jota, who was killed in a car accident alongside his brother Andre Silva in July, won four trophies after joining Liverpool from Wolves in 2020.Two of his children led the teams out as mascots, while his wife Rute Cardoso watched on from the sidelines.Both sets of fans sang chants in Jota's name in the 18th and 20th minutes -- the shirt numbers he wore during his spells at Molineux and Anfield respectively.""After the tragedy happened until now, I have seen so many special moments -- where the fans remembered him or our players conducted themselves unbelievably in the circumstances,"" said Liverpool boss Arne Slot.""Not only our fans but the fans of away teams have shown the respect both Diogo and his brother deserved. It was special to see his children being the mascot and how emotional it was before the game and then in the 20th minute.""On the field, both clubs have suffered this season with Wolves staring down the barrel of relegation after taking just two points from their opening 18 league games.Liverpool's form has improved of late and Wirtz is beginning to show flashes of the brilliance that lured the English champions into paying Bayer Leverkusen £100 million ($135 million) for the German international.The 22-year-old registered his first Premier League assist last weekend for a goal that came at some cost to Liverpool as Alexander Isak suffered a broken leg in opening the scoring against Tottenham.Shorn of the most expensive player in English football history for the coming months, there is even more pressure on Wirtz to deliver on his hefty price tag.""He's been very important for us throughout the season. But in football it is about results, you are mainly judged on results or on goals and assists,"" added Slot.""I think today he showed much more than just the goal he scored; he was special for us in many parts of the game.""Wirtz finally opened his account in his 23rd Liverpool appearance by prodding home Hugo Ekitike's pass to double the home side's lead.Just 90 seconds earlier, Liverpool had made the breakthrough when Ryan Gravenberch slammed in Jeremie Frimpong's cross.Yet, even with a 2-0 half-time lead against a side on course to become the worst in Premier League history, Slot could not relax.Santiago Bueno exposed Liverpool's frailty from set-pieces to pull a goal back just six minutes into the second half.Slot's men have made a habit of late collapses at Leeds and Tottenham in recent weeks and needed a perfectly-timed tackle from Conor Bradley to deny Jhon Arias a late equaliser.","Liverpool beat Wolves 2-1 in Premier League.

This year, most scrambled to check the Google Maps to find Curacao when the smallest-ever nation, in terms of population and size, qualified for next year’s mammoth World Cup 2026. With 155,000 inhabitants, the Caribbean island was guided to the top tier by Dick Advocaat, the former Rangers and PSV boss who has also worked with eight national teams including his native Netherlands (1992-94).Sebastian Migne never set foot on Haiti, another Caribbean nation, because international flights do not land there. They played all their World Cup home qualifiers in Curacao, some 500 miles across the sea.These football stories are the brightest beacon of 2025. In contrast, the darkness around Indian football seems to have grown deeper, unfathomable, with no light at the end of the tunnel.The year gone by has seen All India Football Federation officials spend more time making rounds of the courts than the national team spent on the field.It might delight a research scholar to know that AIFF has presented itself to the Supreme Court 16 times and counting.The national team has played only 12 matches. None of it, though, will bring cheer to the fans.Never since Independence has Indian football slipped into such a deep abyss. For the first time since 1996, when the national league was begun by then-AIFF president Priya Ranjan Das Munshi, it has stalled.One can say with a heavy heart that the league is an orphan now.The sponsorship ran out. The new occupants of Football House, who took charge in 2022, were aware of the matter. But the negotiations just refused to yield any money, assurance, or hope.Since 2010, the AIFF received Rs 50 crore every year from Football Sports Development Limited (FSDL), a Reliance Industries subsidiary, as part of an agreement. The 15-year contract ran out on Dec 8.It was obvious to all, except those in Football House, that no one wants to waste money to keep Indian football – once called a sleeping giant by Sepp Blatter just over a decade and a half ago – alive and awake.Till reports last came in, the AIFF plans to start the elite league around Feb 7-8 after presenting a 20-year plan to the ISL clubs. In accordance with the constitution, the league will be owned and operated by the AIFF and will “implement the principles of promotion and relegation.”“I am convinced we can start the league and then work out a long-term solution,” said IFA secy Anirban Dutta, a member of the committee to resolve the ISL crisis.All year, the stakeholders went into hair-splitting debates and nuanced offerings but the outcome, sadly, has been zero. Even a few clubs had temporarily stopped paying salaries to the players. There has been a frustrating sense of ennui.Last heard, there was some warmth shown by the beleaguered clubs towards the AIFF’s proposals. The format for a truncated league is expected to be confirmed in the year’s final week.Add to it the dismal performance of the national team. Hours after India lost to Bangladesh in their last Asian Cup qualification engagement, Haiti’s ticket to the World Cup sent euphoric shock waves around the world. To watch India’s matches this year, under coaches Manolo Marquez and Khalid Jamil, was like visiting the dentist with a severe toothache.The Indian senior men’s team failed to qualify for the 2027 AFC Asian Cup, which means no competitive football until at least Nov 2027. That is nearly three years without meaningful matches. One wonders what will be Khalid Jamil’s work schedule now?One question keeps haunting, though. If Curacao are able to hire the services of a world-renowned coach like Advocaat, why could India, claimed to be the fourth-largest economy in the world, never reach beyond the Manolos and the Stimacs and the Koevermans? One can keep waiting for an answer but there will only be silence from the All India Football Federation.Following some creditable performances against Bahrain (2-0) and Brunei (6-0), U-23 coach Naushad Moosa got stuck in Doha. Not one to be easily perturbed, even by the sudden bombing of the Qatari capital, Moosa showered rousing praise on the boys. But his enthusiasm was laced with bleakness.“What’s next for the boys? They will go back to their clubs and warm the bench. They won’t be getting any minutes,” he had said in Sept. With the U-17s, Bibiano Fernandes also made headlines by helping the boys cross the Asian Cup qualification hurdles.Repeating himself, Moosa confirmed his apprehensions in Dec. “Nothing is happening. The players too are sadly cooling their heels.” And we couldn’t but recall the days not too long ago, when the AIFF had to put a cap of 45 matches on the national team players.One may point out that these are silver linings. If so, then why can’t Manolo or Jamil do without Sunil Chhetri , India’s weather-beaten warhorse who is past 40? The striker had to break his retirement vows and don the India shirt again, confirming that Indian football’s cupboard is starkly bare.The year 2025 will stay in memory as the lowest point in Indian football.LEAGUE UNCERTAINTY: It’s the end of December, half-time in most football seasons, a time when clubs redraw their strategies, depending on the progress they’ve made in the league. This year, nothing. Indian football has never seen anything like this. There’s no word on the top tier ISL or the I-League, because the AIFF has simply failed to find a commercial partner. Everything’s at a standstill: clubs have paused first team operations, players have stopped training and many foreigners plan to move elsewhere once the transfer window opens on Jan 1. One club has told players they will have to “forego salaries” for months and they’d be “happy to resume payments” only from the date of restart.CAMPS WITHOUT PLAYERS: National team camps often kicked off without half the players. Coach Khalid Jamil wanted more time with the boys, but clubs refused to release players outside the FIFA international windows. It was no different for U-23 assignments. The trust deficit between the two parties has grown so much that Mohun Bagan SG, who have the maximum players at national camps, even accused the federation of negligence over the handling of their captain Subhashish Bose.MONUMENTAL FAILURE: In the 15 months between May 2024 and August 2025, the national team had three coaches — Igor Stimac, Manolo Marquez, Khalid Jamil — none of whom could ensure that India makes it to the AFC Asian Cup, the country’s first failure since the tournament was expanded to accommodate 24 teams. In the final round of qualifiers, India were the highest-ranked side but finished at the bottom, unable to register a single win and in five matches, scoring just twice. The defeat to Bangladesh in Dhaka, the first in 22 years, rankled the most.THE BIG EXIT: The City Football Group’s exit from Mumbai City FC was probably the biggest reflection of the mess that is Indian football. CFG, the world’s leading private owner and operator of 13 clubs, including Manchester City, had joined hands with Mumbai City with much fanfare. Their decision to divest its shareholding in the club is a huge blow. The reason: “CFG made this decision following a comprehensive commercial review and in light of the ongoing uncertainty surrounding the future of the Indian Super League (ISL). ”BUT, A SILVER LINING: The women’s team provided joy in an otherwise grim state. The senior team defied the odds to defeat World Cuppers Thailand and qualify for the AFC Asian Cup. The U-17 and U-20 teams also left India with three continental competitions to play for in the opening months of 2026. At club level, East Bengal’s SAFF Club Championship triumph and a first group stage win in the AFC Women’s Champions League brought cheer.UNDER MANOLO MARQUEZUNDER KHALID JAMILIndia won Bronze Medal at CAFA Nations CupTOTAL MATCHES: 11India Won: 3India Lost: 5Drawn: 3Goals Scored: 8Goals Conceded: 12","Indian football has slipped into such a deep abyss.

Rayan Cherki steals the show as Manchester City edge Nottingham Forest to go top of the Premier League,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/rayan-cherki-steals-the-show-as-manchester-city-edge-nottingham-forest-to-go-top-of-the-premier-league/articleshow/126206283.cms,"Manchester City's Rayan Cherki celebrates with Erling Haaland (Barrington Coombs/PA via AP)

Rayan Cherki delivered another decisive statement of his growing influence at Manchester City as his late strike secured a 2-1 Premier League win over Nottingham Forest and lifted Pep Guardiola’s side to the top of the table on Saturday.The France international was at the heart of everything City did well at the City Ground. After setting up Tijjani Reijnders for the opening goal early in the second half, Cherki returned in the closing stages to fire home the winner, capping a standout display that underlined his importance to City’s title push.City had to weather sustained pressure from Forest, who matched Guardiola’s men for large spells and were level soon after falling behind. Omari Hutchinson, scoring his first goal for the club, punished a rare City mistake to bring the home side back into the contest and briefly threaten another memorable result against the champions.Guardiola’s team eventually found a way through, extending their winning run to eight matches in all competitions and six straight league victories. The result moved City one point clear of Arsenal, although the Gunners could reclaim top spot later in the day with a home win over Brighton.Before kick-off, Forest paid tribute to club legend John Robertson, who passed away on Christmas Day at the age of 72. The former Scotland winger was a central figure in Forest’s back-to-back European Cup triumphs in 1979 and 1980, and his flair and end product were fondly remembered by the City Ground crowd.Cherki, who joined City from Lyon in the summer, appears to share that same blend of creativity and cutting edge. At just 22, he has quickly become a key figure in Guardiola’s side and, should City edge Arsenal to the title, his contribution is likely to be pivotal.Guardiola had set a stern tone over the festive period, warning his players against excess and making it clear that fitness standards would not be compromised. He even cancelled a planned rest day after last weekend’s win over West Ham. When asked about his squad’s condition, Guardiola joked that he was the only one who had put on weight.Despite that discipline, City looked flat before the break and Forest had the better chances. Morgan Gibbs-White went close after meeting a Callum Hudson-Odoi cross, while City struggled to impose themselves. Erling Haaland, who has 19 league goals by Christmas, the joint-most at this stage in Premier League history, was largely kept quiet.The visitors finally found their rhythm just after the interval. Cherki drifted inside and slipped a clever pass to Reijnders, who finished calmly from 12 yards for City’s first shot on target. Cherki then tested goalkeeper John Victor with a fierce effort moments later.Forest responded swiftly. Reijnders lost possession near his own area, allowing Gibbs-White to release Igor Jesus, whose cross was drilled home by Hutchinson from close range. With City wobbling, Neco Williams forced Gianluigi Donnarumma into a save before Nicolo Savona blazed over from the rebound.The decisive moment arrived in the 83rd minute. A loose ball fell to Cherki just inside the box and the Frenchman lashed an unstoppable finish past Victor. He celebrated by mimicking Haaland’s trademark calm pose in front of the travelling supporters.It was a fitting end to a performance that highlighted why Cherki is fast becoming one of Guardiola’s most trusted match-winners as City continue their relentless pursuit of another Premier League crown.",Manchester City beat Nottingham Forest 2-1 at the City Ground.

The All India Football Federation (AIFF) on Friday proposed a new structure for the Indian Super League (ISL), under which the league would be owned and operated by the national body in accordance with its new constitution for the next 20 seasons.According to the new proposal the AIFF formulated after a meeting with the ISL clubs, the league will implement a promotion and relegation system from the upcoming season. Each season will be calculated from June 1 to May 31 of the next year.""We have sent the proposal to the clubs, we have to wait for their response in the next couple of days before finalising our plan,"" an AIFF source told PTI.""Let the clubs respond, we will try to find a solution after hearing them.""It is expected that the AIFF and the clubs will have two more rounds of meetings -- one on Sunday and the other on Monday.If all goes well, the ISL season may start in the first week of February, according to the source.According to the proposal, the ISL will have a predetermined 'Central Operational Budget' for every year that would come from yearly contributions from all 'revenue share holders' proportionate to their revenue share in the league.""This would be known as the 'League Membership Contribution'. Any operational expenses required for the league to be conducted and for clubs to comply with their applicable licensing criteria with the addition of prize money distribution would be capped and borne out of this budget,"" the proposal said.""Governance would be overseen by a Board that would be empowered by the AIFF general body with certain operational autonomy over commercial matters of the League. The jurisdiction of the board would be limited to the utilisation of unrestricted funds within the yearly operational budget earmarked for the same.""Each club, under the proposal, will pay the AIFF a 'standard participating fee' of Rs 1 crore a year at the beginning of the season. This would, however, be independent of any calculations of the 'Central Operating Expenditure'.""This amount would be fully reimbursable from the central revenue prior to distribution of 'Net Revenue'. The total participation fee for all clubs would be put at 20% of the 'central operational budget' of the League. In case the Board decides to raise the 'central operational budget' by 10% in the future, the 'standard participation fee' would proportionately increase.""Any profit, or savings from the operational budget, will be distributed equally amongst all revenue shareholders in proportion to the respective revenue shares.On December 20, a proposal from 10 ISL clubs for ""perpetual"" operational and commercial ownership of the country's top-tier competition failed to get the approval of the AIFF's General Body, which formed a committee to look into the matter.The AIFF panel was tasked with holding discussions with representatives of five clubs - Chennaiyin FC, Mumbai City FC, Delhi Sporting Club, NorthEast United FC and Mohun Bagan Super Giant from December 22 to 29.Under the AIFF's proposal, the total outlay of the first season of the ISL will be Rs 70 crore with the AIFF's revenue share pegged at 10 per cent (that is Rs 7 crore) in the first season, while 50 per cent (Rs 35 crore) will come from the clubs -- 14 as of now unless there is any pull out.But interestingly, a revenue share of 30 per cent has been reserved for a potential commercial partner. The AIFF is yet to get a commercial partner as it did not receive any bid after a tender was floated on the supervision of a Supreme Court-appointed committee under a retired SC judge.Though the AIFF has included a 30 per cent revenue share for a potential commercial partner in the proposal, it is learnt that since the number of matches this season could be less than earlier years, the ISL can be run with a 'central operating budget' of less than the proposed Rs 70 crore.",The All India Football Federation (AIFF) has proposed a new structure for the Indian Super League (ISL) The league would be owned and operated by the national body in accordance with its new constitution for the next 20 seasons.

RABAT: Organisers at the Africa Cup of Nations in Morocco are allowing supporters in for free after kick-off in matches where stadiums are not full, a Confederation of African Football source told AFP.The Group F game between Cameroon and Gabon on Wednesday in Agadir kicked off in front of almost empty stands but the ground filled up significantly over the course of the first half despite incessant rain.The official attendance was later announced as 35,200 inside a venue which can hold over 45,000.There have been similar scenes at numerous matches across the opening days of the competition, even leading to confusion over the attendance figures themselves.The crowd at Tuesday's Group D encounter between the Democratic Republic of Congo and Benin at Rabat's Al Medina Stadium -- which filled up considerably over the course of the game -- was initially announced as 6,703 before later being corrected to 13,073.The CAF source indicated that organisers, in agreement with African football's governing body, were opening stands around 20 minutes into games to allow fans gathered outside to enter without paying.Filling stadiums is an important issue for Cup of Nations organisers in Morocco, for which a successful hosting of the tournament is key as it builds towards the 2030 World Cup to be jointly held in the North African country, Spain and Portugal.CAF's official ticketing platform on Thursday showed seats available for almost all remaining group matches for prices starting at 100 dirhams ($10.96).The only matches shown as sell-outs were hosts Morocco's games against Mali on Friday and Zambia on Monday, as well as Algeria against Burkina Faso on Sunday and Algeria versus Equatorial Guinea next Wednesday.","Africa Cup of Nations organisers are allowing supporters in for free after kick- off in matches where stadiums are not full.

Welcoming her third child in February, her first with husband Joaquim Valente, brought deep personal growth. The reflection also marks a new chapter in her life following her divorce from Tom Brady, grounded in gratitude and renewal.

Gisele Bündchen reflects on motherhood, growth, and trust as she steps into 2026





Gisele Bundchen is entering 2026 with less bang and more headlines and more of the beat of motherhood. Before the end of the year, the Brazilian supermodel preferred not to show the spectacle, but a very personal message in which she expressed the extent to which the last twelve months changed her inner world. It did not represent a career milestone that made 2025 her own. It was home living, growing and changing once more.Bundchen celebrated the end of 2025 in one of her New Year Eve Instagram posts by opening a window into her emotional reset. She also talked about her sense of purpose redefined by the new birth of another child in addition to hidden pregnancy photographs and scenes with husband Joaquim Valente. It was a tone based, thankful and distinctly human, an indicator of a chapter to be influenced by presence instead of speed.“As 2025 comes to an end, my heart is full. This year brought deep lessons and profound growth. Becoming a mother again reshaped everything—my time, my priorities, my heart,” Gisele gushed.ID@undefinedCaption not available.ID@undefinedCaption not available.Those words capture a turning point. In February 2025, Bündchen welcomed her third child and her first with Valente, adding a new layer to a life already rich with experience.At 44, she framed motherhood not as a return, but as a transformation. “I’m grateful for these sacred moments that changed me in ways words can’t fully hold,” she continued.Her message closed with intention rather than certainty. “Thank you, 2025. I step into this new year with gratitude, love, and trust for what’s next.”The post arrived shortly after reports that Bündchen and Valente quietly married earlier in December during an intimate ceremony at their home. Together, these moments reflect stability after years of public change.Bündchen is also mother to Vivian Lake, 12, and Benjamin Rein, 15, whom she shares with ex husband Tom Brady. While her past with the NFL legend remains part of her story, her present feels firmly rooted elsewhere. Less about reinvention. More about alignment. And for Gisele Bündchen, that shift appears to have reshaped everything.Also Read: “So good to be…”: Gisele Bündchen and Tom Brady enter the 2025 holiday season with new marriages and major life changes","Bundchen celebrated the end of 2025 in one of her New Year Eve Instagram posts by opening a window into her emotional reset.

A New Year post from Brittany Mahomes confirmed he is still on crutches, reinforcing the long road ahead. Andy Reid stressed patience, noting Mahomes remains around the team while prioritizing recovery over travel or timelines.

Patrick Mahomes welcomes 2026 focused on rehab as Chiefs shift from urgency to patience





The Kansas City Chiefs are closing out a season few in the locker room expected, and the unease has little to do with the standings. For the first time in years, the focus in Kansas City has shifted away from playoff math and toward patience. At the center of it all is Patrick Mahomes, whose recovery has quietly become the franchise’s most important storyline heading into 2026.While Andy Reid addressed the situation publicly, it was Brittany Mahomes who offered the most telling glimpse. A New Year’s Instagram post showed a joyful family moment, fireworks overhead, children close by. Yet one detail stood out. Patrick Mahomes was still on crutches, his knee wrapped in a heavy brace. The image said more than any official update. Rehab remains the priority, and the process is far from over.Mahomes suffered ACL and LCL tears late in Week 15 against the Chargers while pushing to keep the season alive. That single play reshaped the Chiefs’ winter. The expectation inside the organization is cautious optimism, with a hopeful return near Week 1. Until then, progress is measured in small, deliberate steps, not timelines.Reid confirmed Mahomes has stayed deeply involved, even if he will not travel with the team for the Week 18 finale. As the coach explained, “He’s around, so he’s in the building and working and doing his rehab, and spending a lot of hours doing it.” Reid added, “He’s really attacked that and will continue to do that. He’s around and sees the guys, but most of his time is being spent rehabbing.”Asked about Mahomes joining the team on the road, Reid shut that down quickly. “Probably not this soon, no,” he said.The decision reflects caution, not concern. Knee injuries demand discipline, and the Chiefs see no value in unnecessary strain. Rehab will stretch through the offseason, likely into training camp, with careful checkpoints along the way.For now, Mahomes enters 2026 grounded, surrounded by family, focused on recovery. The season may be ending, but belief in Kansas City remains firmly intact.Also Read: “Hate will not get us out”: Brittany Mahomes addresses hate and healing during emotionally charged moment off the field","Patrick Mahomes is entering 2026 focused entirely on rehab after suffering ACL and LCL tears late in the season.

This time around, she wanted to be less intrusive.”As per Radar Online, the source continued, ""Neither she nor Travis wants their engagement to overshadow the game…”However, neither Taylor Swift nor Travis Kelce has confirmed the speculations yet as they continue to be focused on the last match of the Kansas City Chiefs in this season.For the unversed, in the last few seasons, Taylor Swift was present in almost all home games of the Kansas City Chiefs and was often spotted on the fields after a win to celebrate it with Travis Kelce.But that’s not all; Taylor Swift was often accompanied by her high profile celebrity friends, including Blake Lively, Selena Gomez, Ryan Reynolds as they all cheered on Travis Kelce.This had raised many eyebrows as many NFL experts felt that Taylor Swift was a “distraction” at the matches.This resulted in Taylor Swift even being booed at last season’s Super Bowl when the Kansas City Chiefs brutally lost against the Philadelphia Eagles.While Taylor Swift is maintaining a low profile, Travis Kelce is surrounded by retirement rumors.A few days ago, Travis Kelce addressed the retirement rumors as he said, ""I'd rather just keep the focus of the media and everything on this team right now...

Why the Cowboys finally decided to release Diggs





The Dallas Cowboys officially waived cornerback Trevon Diggs on December 30, 2025, ending a turbulent chapter for the two-time Pro Bowler. Known for his early-career dominance, Diggs’ time in Dallas was increasingly marred by injuries, inconsistent play, and a series of off-field questions. The move comes as the Cowboys prepare for their season finale and the team’s focus shifts to roster adjustments for 2026.The decision to part ways with Diggs wasn’t sudden. Cowboys head coach Brian Schottenheimer cited multiple factors behind the release. While Diggs had been a cornerstone of the secondary early in his career, injuries and missed time had limited his impact.Reports confirm that Diggs missed multiple games due to knee surgeries and a concussion suffered in October 2025. He returned to practice and games but never regained the level of production that once made him an All-Pro. In eight games this season, he recorded just 25 tackles and had no interceptions, a stark contrast to his dominant 2021 season.The Cowboys also cited issues with protocol and rehab attendance. Diggs was docked $500,000 earlier in the season for completing his rehabilitation away from the team’s facility, which was contractually required.While the team wanted him at the Dallas facility, he opted for rehab in South Florida. These factors, combined with inconsistent performance, contributed to the organization’s decision.There’s been plenty of speculation surrounding Diggs’ concussion and time away from the team. Verified reporting confirms that the concussion occurred when a TV mount and pole fell on his head at home not from any wild or mysterious accident.Additionally, after the Cowboys’ Christmas Day game in Washington, Diggs requested to remain in D.C. with family rather than return to Dallas immediately. The team denied the request. While some online rumors suggested he defied team orders to attend a concert, there’s no credible reporting confirming this.It’s also important to note that the Cowboys did not publicly label Diggs a “mental headache” or publicly blame him for poor practice habits. While internal frustration was likely, fans and insiders have sometimes exaggerated these narratives.With the waiver claim process underway, the Green Bay Packers picked up Diggs the day after his release. For the Cowboys, releasing Diggs ahead of the season finale reduces cap hits for 2026 and opens the door for roster flexibility as the team prepares for the offseason.For Diggs, this is a chance to restart in Green Bay, where he could regain his form if he remains healthy. He acknowledged his time in Dallas on social media, expressing gratitude for the opportunity and optimism for the future.Also read - Will Jordan Love play in Week 18 after clearing concussion protocol?

Denise DeBartolo York’s family net worth hit $8.4B on the 2025 Forbes 400

The San Francisco 49ers and Leeds United explain the York family’s money trail





Denise DeBartolo York and her family landed at No. 163 on the 2025 Forbes 400, with Forbes estimating their net worth at $8.4 billion. That figure comes from Forbes’ latest ranking, as reported Sept. 19, 2025.This is not some mystery-money story. Forbes ties the York family fortune primarily to their ownership of the San Francisco 49ers, where the family holds more than 90% of the franchise.The Forbes 400 list is basically a “you’re in or you’re out” snapshot of America’s richest. In 2025, Forbes said the 400 wealthiest Americans held $6.6 trillion combined, and you needed at least $3.8 billion to make the cut.The York family cleared that bar easily. WFMJ’s report notes the family’s wealth has climbed hard over the last decade, tracking Forbes wealth history data: $1.9 billion in 2016, $3.2 billion by 2020, and then the 2025 Forbes 400 estimate at $8.4 billion.They also landed ahead of other famous names on that same 2025 list, including Mark Cuban and Steven Spielberg, per the same report.Here’s the straight line: Edward DeBartolo Sr. bought the San Francisco 49ers for $13 million in 1977, and the family still controls the franchise today.Denise DeBartolo York took control of the 49ers in 2000. Her oldest son, Jed York, is now the team’s CEO. Forbes also lists the 49ers as the NFL’s sixth-most valuable franchise, and the team finished as the Super Bowl runner-up in 2023.Then the family pushed further into global soccer. The 49ers’ ownership arm agreed to buy the remaining 56% stake in Leeds United in 2023 after already owning 44%.The WFMJ report said the family paid more than $200 million to acquire that remaining stake.Bottom line: the Yorks aren’t climbing because of a random side hustle. Their net worth rises when their sports assets rise. And the biggest one is still the 49ers.","Denise DeBartolo York and her family landed at No. 163 on the 2025 Forbes 400, with Forbes estimating their net worth at $8.4 billion.

Michael Porter Jr. remains on Bucks’ radar as Warriors’ interest stays uncertain

Michael Porter Jr.’s massive contract complicates Warriors talks as Bucks stay desperate for help





Michael Porter Jr., a forward with the Brooklyn Nets, might have a change of scenery before the trade deadline on February 5. The Milwaukee Bucks, Detroit Pistons, Golden State Warriors, and Chicago Bulls are all possible trade destinations for Porter, according to NBA source Jake Fischer.As the trade deadline draws near, the Milwaukee Bucks are anticipated to be active buyers in an effort to complement Giannis Antetokounmpo with another star. There has been a lot of talk lately regarding the Golden State Warriors' possible interest in trading for forward Michael Porter Jr. of the Brooklyn Nets.Four viable possibilities that may have a big impact on the Bucks have surfaced thus far. Michael Porter Jr., Jerami Grant, Zach LaVine, and Malik Monk are among Milwaukee's top trade targets this season, according to Sam Amick of The Athletic. According to Amick:""It remains to be seen whether he can pull off anything significant, as Milwaukee is (by its own doing) limited in assets and options. The list of names under consideration is likely much longer than what is publicly known, but a few have emerged…”Brett Siegel of ClutchPoints gave an update on the Warriors' potential pursuit of the seasoned shooter prior to the trade deadline on February 5. On Tuesday's ""Clutch Scoops"" live feed, Siegel reported:“I haven’t been told that there’s anything brewing in terms of Michael Porter Jr. going to the Warriors.”Siegel said of Warriors trade buzz around MPJ:“It would take a lot of contracts to get him, and they’ll have to sacrifice draft capital because of how well he’s playing.”LaVine of the Kings is also a confirmed target, according to ESPN,“Sacramento’s Malik Monk and Portland’s Jerami Grant. League sources say Brooklyn’s Michael Porter Jr. is a name worth watching as well..”Jake Fischer of The Stein Line revealed on Thursday that the Warriors had ""had internal discussions about whether to pursue Porter.""But regrettably, Fischer continued for Warriors supporters, Brooklyn “has not shown much interest in acquiring Jonathan Kuminga dating back to last summer.""According to Siegel, Porter earns $38.3 million this season and an additional $40.8 million in 2026-2027, thus the Warriors would have to give up a number of players in a possible trade. Siegel stated that the Warriors had made enquiries about Nets centre Nic Claxton as they search the league for athletic big men, although ruling out any potential trade interest in MPJ.The Bucks are in dire need of an acquisition to help them get back into contention because they are having a difficult season. With a 14-20 record, they are now ranked 11th in the East.

Cooper Flagg’s maximum contract details: Exploring the Duke phenom’s massive NBA contract and rising stardom,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/cooper-flaggs-maximum-contract-details-exploring-the-duke-phenoms-massive-nba-contract-and-rising-stardom/articleshow/126294059.cms,"Cooper Flagg is a talented rookie (Image via NBA)

Cooper Flagg’s historic rookie contract highlights NBA’s new money era and soaring expectations

Cooper Flagg breaks LeBron James’ long-standing record with stunning 42-point night despite Mavericks loss





In accordance with the new, higher rookie compensation structure for the 2025 NBA Draft, Cooper Flagg signed a four-year rookie contract with the Dallas Mavericks worth roughly $62.7 million, with roughly $28.3 million guaranteed in the first two years. He has a basic salary of about $13.8 million for the first year, team options for years three and four, and the possibility of significant extensions if he becomes eligible for supermax compensation.The first overall draft pick has agreed to a four-year rookie contract with the Mavericks. When the team announced the contract on Wednesday, they did not reveal any specifics. According to Spotrac, the top pick on the 2025–26 rookie wage scale will sign a contract worth roughly $62.7 million, with a first-year compensation of roughly $13.8 million. These figures are subject to modest variation.Few rookies ever see the spotlight, which is where Cooper Flagg's NBA career begins. The Duke phenom, who was selected first overall by the Dallas Mavericks, is immediately making news for both his skill and the investment that accompanied him. The deal's implications for the league's future are just as important as his salary. Despite Flagg's youth, the potential rewards and expectations are substantial.Cooper Flagg's contract serves as an example of the profound changes occurring in the NBA today. With a projected salary cap of $154.6 million, up 10% from the previous year, Flagg, the youngest No. 1 draft pick since LeBron James, will enter a redesigned rookie wage system.His four-year contract includes team options for the third and fourth years, totaling roughly $62.7 million at the maximum 120% slot value, and guarantees for the first two years (~$28.3 million).In a recent interview with Bob Costas, seasoned sports writer Howard Bryant said that Flagg cleared more than $28 million in NIL agreements during his rookie year at Duke. A live audience gasped at the amount, which greatly exceeded On3's initial $4.8 million assessment of Flagg's earnings.At 51:10 in the conversation, Bryant stated:""He had a $13 million deal with New Balance and then $15 million with Fanatics.""According to reports, both agreements, which were signed on undisclosed terms, accompany Flagg into the NBA and cover one NIL year. Although it's probable that he has previously made the stated amounts, they probably cover the entirety of his multi-year contracts. In any case, Flagg continues to be among the highest-paid athletes in collegiate athletics.In August 2024, the native of Newport, Maine, signed his NIL contract with New Balance. Before signing a deal with the Boston-based business, Flagg and his family visited with a number of brand reps who offered ""north of seven figures per year,"" according to Boardroom. In January 2025, fans revealed an ""exclusive, multi-year"" contract with the freshman that included trading cards and memorabilia.Just a few days before turning 19, Cooper Flagg smashed a decades-old LeBron James record on Monday night. Even so, the Dallas Mavericks were unable to defeat the Utah Jazz. In a 140-133 overtime loss against the Jazz on Monday at the Delta Centre, Flagg scored a career-high 42 points.James' record for the most points scored in a single NBA game by an 18-year-old was shattered by that. In the Mavericks' 140-133 overtime loss in Utah, Flagg finished with 42 points. Although he was obviously upset that his team had blown a nine-point lead in the fourth quarter.The performance only served to highlight the fact that the native of Newport, Maine, is among the greatest youngsters to have ever played in the NBA. LeBron James' 2003 record for the most points scored by an 18-year-old in an NBA game was surpassed by Flagg's scoring explosion.Also read: Kelsey Plum’s net worth: Exploring the Los Angeles Sparks star’s WNBA salary, contract details, and more","The first overall draft pick has agreed to a four-year rookie contract with the Mavericks.

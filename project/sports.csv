Poll Do you think KL Rahul should change his tactical approach for future matches? Yes, absolutely No, he should stick to his style

NEW DELHI: India captain KL Rahul admitted his team “needed to be sharper” in crucial phases but firmly pointed to the toss and heavy dew as the biggest factors in India's four-wicket defeat to South Africa in the second ODI in Raipur on Tuesday.Despite piling up a massive 358/5 on the back of majestic hundreds from Virat Kohli (102 off 93) and Ruturaj Gaikwad (105 off 83), India were stunned as South Africa chased down the target in 49.2 overs, finishing with 362/6 — their highest successful run chase in ODIs on Indian soil.Rahul, who lost the toss for the second match in a row, did not hide his frustration.“Toss plays a big role so I'm kicking myself,” he said with a rueful smile after the match.Explaining why defending even 358 became a nightmare, he added, “There's so much dew and it's so difficult to bowl in the second innings. Not really a tough one to swallow when you know how hard it is.”While acknowledging the role of conditions, the Indian skipper stressed that the team must adapt better going forward.“I know that 350 looks good, but we have been talking in the dressing room about how we can get the extra 20-25 runs to give bowlers a cushion with a wet ball,” Rahul said.He was full of praise for his century-makers, especially Gaikwad, who registered his maiden ODI ton.“It was beautiful watching Rutu bat, the way he picked up the tempo after his fifty. Virat, we've seen do it 53 times, he just goes about doing his job.”South Africa's chase was powered by Aiden Markram (110), with strong support from Matthew Breetzke (68) and Dewald Brevis (54). Their clinical effort thrilled skipper Temba Bavuma , who hailed the record chase.“Unbelievable game, record chase… it shows how well we have to play against this Indian side,” Bavuma said, adding that the move to send Brevis early was a tactical masterstroke.He also credited internal competition for their improved performance.“There's high competition for places; performances like these do good for our confidence.”","South Africa beat India by four wickets in second ODI in Raipur.

Inside details of Shubman Gill's rehab at BCCI CoE, set to return for SA T20Is

NEW DELHI: A light and endearing moment took place during the second ODI in Raipur when wicketkeeper-batter Rishabh Pant spotted an eyelash on Rohit Sharma ’s face just before South Africa began their chase. Though not part of the playing XI, Pant walked up to Rohit near the boundary and gently removed the eyelash, placing it on the back of his hand and asking him to make a wish. Rohit smiled, closed his eyes, and completed the little ritual — a brief but wholesome exchange that quickly caught the attention of cameras and fans.Earlier in the match, India put up an imposing 358/5 after being asked to bat first — marking the 20th instance in ODIs where the opposition opted to field first against India. Rohit, despite a promising start featuring three boundaries, departed for 14 off just eight deliveries. Virat Kohli once again stole the spotlight with his red-hot form, scoring a superb 102 off 93 balls. The knock marked his 53rd ODI century and second straight hundred of the series. With it, Kohli also overtook Sachin Tendulkar’s record for the most ODI tons from a single batting position.Ruturaj Gaikwad played the perfect ally, registering his maiden ODI century with a fluent 105 off 83 balls, helping stabilize the innings after early wickets.Their partnership laid the groundwork for a dominant total.Stand-in skipper KL Rahul added a late flourish with an unbeaten 66 from 43 balls, ensuring India crossed the 350-run mark with momentum.During the break, Rohit — who was recently named ambassador for the 2026 T20 World Cup — joined BCCI officials and Tilak Varma to unveil India’s new T20I jersey. The fresh design features a dark blue base with bright orange accents and a tricolour-themed collar.Speaking after the unveiling, Rohit reflected on India’s victorious 2024 T20 World Cup campaign and voiced confidence in the team’s prospects for the 2026 edition, set to be co-hosted by India and Sri Lanka.“It’s been a long journey. We won our first World Cup in 2007, and we had to wait more than 15 years to win the next one. It’s been a long road with plenty of ups and downs, but it felt great to lift the trophy again,” Rohit said.“Now, with the World Cup happening in India, it’s going to be an exciting tournament. My best wishes are always with the team, and I’m sure everyone will be behind them and supporting them for doing their best,” said Rohit, who is now the brand ambassador for the 2026 T20 World Cup, where India enters as defending champions.","Wicketkeeper-batter Rishabh Pant spotted an eyelash on Rohit Sharma ’s face just before South Africa began their chase.

India Test and ODI vice-captain Shubman Gill , who has been out of action for the last few weeks due to a neck injury, is all set to return for the T20I series vs South Africa, starting December 9. Gill, as first reported by TimesofIndia.com, reached the BCCI Centre of Excellence on December 1 and has been undergoing rehabilitation at the facility in Bengaluru since then.It has been reliably learnt that Gill has already had a couple of batting sessions and his workload will be gradually increased in the coming days. Fielding and catching drills have also been added to his schedule as the medical team at the CoE is in no mood to take any chances with India's T20I vice-captain.Gill is yet to receive the Return to Play (RTP) clearance from the CoE and it's likely to happen after he undergoes a match simulation in the next 48 hours. The moment there are no red flags, he will get the clearance to play. As of now, he could link up with the squad in Cuttack on December 6 if there are no last-minute hiccups.TimesofIndia.com has learnt that India's T20I squad, which is likely to be announced in the next 24 hours, will have Gill's name, but a rider of ""subject to fitness"" could follow. The men's senior selection committee, chaired by Ajit Agarkar, has been communicated about Gill's current status and there are no roadblocks at the moment.In case the management isn't comfortable rushing him back to action, he could miss the series opener, but even that is unlikely at this stage.Gill injured his neck during the first innings of the Kolkata Test vs South Africa and missed the next game in Guwahati and was also ruled out of the ongoing three-ODI series vs the same opposition. He was advised rest by a spine specialist in Mumbai and has been away from action since.","India Test and ODI vice-captain Shubman Gill has been out of action for the last few weeks due to a neck injury.

WPL Auction 2026: Full Breakdown of Every Major Number

NEW DELHI: MS Dhoni 's impact at Chennai Super Kings has long been hailed for its calmness, loyalty and unmatched leadership — but former CSK star Mike Hussey has now lifted the curtain on a lesser-known side of the franchise: the off-field bonding culture built around Dhoni's open-door hospitality.In a fascinating revelation on The Overlap Cricket podcast, Hussey said Dhoni's room effectively became CSK's unofficial team lounge during every IPL season. Players drifted in and out at all hours, discussing cricket, bantering, sharing meals — and for some, unwinding with shisha.“Dhoni is just the most amazing guy. His room is available open 24 hours a day. Anyone can go up there and just sit. He has got his lounge room, players just sit around, they start talking cricket, some of them like the shisha, you know, the flavoured tobacco stuff. That is their way of socialising. Credit to Dhoni, he opens his room up — lots of players go up, they bring food up, it is fantastic,” Hussey said, offering a glimpse into the camaraderie that defined CSK's IPL dynasty.The anecdote echoes former CSK batter George Bailey 's earlier revelation that Dhoni often hosted relaxed hookah sessions to help younger players settle into the team.Bailey had said Dhoni's informal approach broke down hierarchy and helped create a sense of belonging — a trademark CSK value over the years.Hussey also shared a surprising detail about Dhoni's preparation habits: despite being one of the game's greatest wicketkeepers, he almost never practised the skill in training.“I think the only time I've seen him catch a ball was when we wanted to knock in a new pair of gloves. I've never seen him practise his keeping ever. But he bats a long, long time — he hits thousands and thousands of balls,” Hussey revealed.With Dhoni set to return for IPL 2026 after being retained by the five-time champions, stories like these underline why CSK players past and present continue to call the franchise a “family” — one built on trust, comfort and a legend whose door was literally always open.",Mike Hussey reveals MS Dhoni's open-door hospitality at Chennai Super Kings.

Sharma your pet project. In an interview with TimesofIndia.com, he categorically mentioned that your inputs have made him a better player.

Dinesh Karthik spent a lot of time working with Jitesh Sharma in the RCB dugout.

In India, why are there so few finishers? No one wants to do the dirty job. Is batting at 6 and 7 difficult, or is the role thankless?

Who do you think is the best finisher in T20 cricket at present?

If you could talk about the science behind power-hitting?

Former India cricketer Dinesh Karthik reflects on shifting from SA20 to ILT20, explaining the stark differences between a Test-nation league and an associate-nation tournament.In an exclusive interview with TimesofIndia.com, Karthik talks about his new team Sharjah Warriors, his influence on India player Jitesh Sharma at the Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB), also touched upon the topic about why finishing is a specialist’s craft, and why Tim David is the world’s best middle-order hitter. He also breaks down the technical science behind power-hitting.First up, SA20 is a very different tournament. All six teams are IPL-owned and the league is very well supported. Their domestic system and domestic players are very strong. This setup is very different because ILT20 belongs to an associate nation. You obviously don’t have the strength and quality that a current Test-playing nation would have, and that is a big difference. In terms of crowds as well, I don’t think it will be anywhere close to what SA20 can draw.So the dynamics of this tournament are very different. In SA20, seven locals play along with four foreigners.Here, many more foreigners feature — about eight of the eleven will be overseas players, with three from associate nations. So the dynamics are very different.Speaking about Sharjah Warriors, I think it is very nice to see a group like Capri Global willing to invest in sport. Not just cricket — they’ve invested in kabaddi as well. And seeing how involved their daughter is in sport, it’s a great opportunity for them as a company to experience the ebbs and flows of what it means to be part of sport. Representing them is something I’m very happy about. They are slowly but steadily rising in the sporting world and I wish them all the success. I’m happy to represent them and do the best I can.I think it’s a very noble thought, and it’s great that Jitesh feels that way about me. But as a player, the amount of time you can spend influencing someone is mostly through actions. When you’re a coach, the dynamic is very different. I’m more than happy to see if, while playing, I get the opportunity to influence somebody. But I have to say that Jitesh is someone I’ve enjoyed working with, and there are many such players in this league as well. Whenever I get time, I’ll try to spend a little bit and see if I can help them in any way.First of all, I don’t think it’s thankless. In fact, I feel finishers get paid enormously well because the role is very niche, and people have now started seeing the value in a finisher, even if they play far fewer balls than the top order.I don’t think it’s “dirty” either because there is so much work to do and it is extremely challenging. You encounter far more failures in the middle order compared to being an opener or a top-order batter because you face fewer balls and have to take many more risks.Tim David, according to me, is the best middle-order batsman in the world. When you watch him bat, there is a lot of method behind the shots he plays. It’s not blind hitting. There is so much skill and technique that he has harnessed and worked on, and now he’s proving to himself and to the world how good and consistent he can be. There is a lot of skill involved, and also plenty of mental aptitude needed to understand what to do in different situations. It’s a very fun job if you truly enjoy it.First comes the flow and the position — then how you use certain basics like a good wide base. You need to be beside the line. It’s about small things. You have to work one step at a time, understand what you’re lacking, and figure out how to get better. That’s how you improve.",Former India cricketer Dinesh Karthik will play for Sharjah Warriors in the ILT20. He spent a lot of time working with Jitesh Sharma at the Royal Challengers Bengaluru.

Still have doubts? Virat Kohli blows World Cup trumpet with another masterclass

Poll Who do you think is primarily responsible for India's decline in Test cricket? Players Team Management Both equally External Factors

NEW DELHi: Former head coach Ravi Shastri has delivered one of his most pointed critiques yet of India's dramatic fall in Test cricket, declaring that both players and the team management must take responsibility for the decline. The former India head coach, who oversaw the team's successful run alongside Virat Kohli, said he is deeply hurt by the sight of a side that once dominated home and away now suffering whitewashes against New Zealand and South Africa at home.Shastri, speaking to Prabhat Khabar in a podcast teaser, was visibly frustrated while recalling India's collapse in the Guwahati Test. “You tell me. What happened in Guwahati – from 100/1, you skip to 130/7? This team is not that bad either. They have this much talent at least. The players should take some responsibility too. You have played spin since you started playing cricket,” he said.Asked whether he was defending new head coach Gautam Gambhir , Shastri was blunt. “I'm not protecting [him]. One hundred per cent he is responsible too. When am I saying anything otherwise?” he said.Then came his most striking comment. “Agar yeh mere saath hota, main pehla responsibility leta (Had this happened with me, I would have been the first one to take responsibility). But then, I wouldn't have spared the players either in the team meeting.”The frustration stems from high standards Shastri's own tenure had set. Between 2017 and 2021, India became the world's best travelling Test side, winning two historic series in Australia, staying No. 1 for 42 months and losing only two matches at home under Kohli.While Rahul Dravid revived the team after a slow start, leading India to home series wins and a second WTC final, that trajectory has stalled under Gambhir. India have managed just two Test series victories in 14 months — against Bangladesh and West Indies — while suffering heavy defeats in Australia and a draw in England.",Ravi Shastri says both players and team management must take responsibility for India's dramatic fall in Test cricket.

South African opener Aiden Markram scored a magnificent 110 runs off 98 balls to lead his team to a successful chase of 359 runs against India in the second ODI at Shaheed Veer Narayan Singh International Stadium on Wednesday. The four-wicket victory helped South Africa equal the record for the highest target chased against India in ODIs, matching Australia's feat in Mohali in 2019.South Africa has now achieved three successful run chases of 350 or more in ODIs, joining India with the most such accomplishments.After receiving the Player of the Match award, Markram discussed his team's positive approach to cricket and their strategy to pressure opposition bowlers.""Yes, exactly. You've got to get through that initial period. We saw in the first game what the middle order did and from my side I did feel a bit responsible that we just came up short. If you kick on into the 70s, the outcome could easily be different.""Tonight, under lights, the wicket had a bit more pace and swing, so the plan was to get in, find some rhythm, and then push on from there.""I can't remember the exact over, but later in the innings we (himself and Bavuma) chatted and felt we were both set.That's normally when I try to play my shots. If one of us gets out, then you rebuild with the next batter. The partnership felt solid.""I'm proud of the boys for getting us over the line. It was tricky at the end, high-pressure moments, but the guys stayed calm and got the job done. It definitely helps (having a long batting line-up),"" Markram said.""When you've effectively got 8 batters and Kesh, who can also chip in, that gives you a lot of freedom. As a team we want to play a positive brand, take the game on and put bowlers under pressure. When you've got depth, you feel that freedom.""The middle order has really put their hands up over the past year. Now it's up to us at the top to set things up so they can entertain. It's tough to pick (opening or middle order). Everyone says opening is great because the field is up and the ball comes onto the bat nicely.""That's true but when it's swinging in and out, it can be a challenge. Still, I'm happy either way. It's only been a few innings at the top again, so I think once I settle in, I'll start enjoying it even more,"" Markram added.The series-deciding third match is scheduled for Saturday.",South Africa beat India by four wickets in second ODI.

Harshit Rana press conference: On social media trolls, outside noise, Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma

RAIPUR: Displaying the kind of tough character which saw them win their first Test series in India a few days back, South Africa equalized the ODI series 1-1 with an incredible four-wicket victory in the second game here on Wednesday night.Undaunted by India setting a formidable total of 358/5, the South Africans — powered by a brilliant hundred from Aiden Markram (110 off 98b; 10x4, 4x6), a half century from new sensation Matthew Breetzke (68; 64b, 5x4), Dewald Brevis’ 54 (34b, 5x6, 1x4) and a vital knock from skipper Temba Bavuma (46 off 48b; 3x4, 1x6) — successfully chased down the tar get under lights.Making full use of the dew and some ordinary bowling by India, SA justified their decision to bowl first with some terrific batting. This is only the second time that India have lost an ODI after posting 350-plus while batting first. Interestingly, on that occasion too, against Australia in Mohali in 2019, they had scored 358.SA’s magnificent chase meant the efforts of the peerless Virat Kohli , who smashed a second successive hundred (102 off 93 balls; 7x4, 2x6) and an impressive Ruturaj Gaikwad (105 off 83 balls, 12x4, 2x6) — who cracked his maiden ODI century off just 77 balls — went in vain.So did stand-in-captain KL Rahul’s 66 not out (43 balls, 6x4, 2x6).While their three spinners took just one wicket between them in 21 overs while conceding 147 runs, of particular concern to India will be the way pacer Prasidh Krishna went for 2-85 in just 8.2 overs, putting a huge question mark on his selection.India were left to rue a missed opportunity when Markram was dropped by Yashasvi Jaiswal at long-on while batting on 53 off Kuldeep Yadav in the 18th over. South Africa lost opener Quinton de Kock (8) but were put back on track by a 101-run stand in 96 balls for the second wicket between Markram and Bavuma.After Bavuma perished to a hook shot off Krishna in the 21st over, Markram put on 70 in 55 balls for the third wicket with Breetzke. When Harshit Rana had Markram caught at long on off a slow bouncer, India heaved a sigh of relief.However, Breetzke and Brevis added 92 in 64 balls for the fourth wicket to provide wings to SA’s superb chase. Brevis pulled Harshit Rana for back-to-back sixes in the 40th over. The consistent Breetzke, who scored 72 off 80 balls in the first ODI in Ranchi, has enjoyed a splendid start to his ODI career, having scored six fifties and a hundred in his first 11 ODIs. With 27 needed in five overs, Tony de Zorzi retired hurt on 17. However, Corbin Bosch took SA home with four balls to spare.Earlier, Kohli and Gaikwad put on 195 in just 156 balls for the third wicket, India’s highest ever partnership against South Africa in ODIs.","South Africa equalized the ODI series 1-1 with an incredible four-wicket victory in the second game here on Wednesday night.

Inside details of Shubman Gill's rehab at BCCI CoE, set to return for SA T20Is

RAIPUR: In a big boost for India, Test and ODI captain Shubman Gill and premier white-ball allrounder Hardik Pandya , who were both out due to injuries, are back for the five-match home T20I series against South Africa starting from Dec 9 in Cuttack.Gill, India’s vice-captain in T20Is, seems to have recovered from his neck injury and was included subject to a fitness clearance from the BCCI ’s Centre of Excellence in Bengaluru. Meanwhile, Pandya, who was sidelined due to a quadriceps injury since the Asia Cup in Sept in UAE, re-covered after undergoing rehab at CoE.On Tuesday, while playing his first competitive match in almost two months, Pandya smashed a match winning 77* off just 42 balls for Baroda against Punjab in the Syed Mushtaq Ali T20 Trophy match in Hyderabad, be sides taking 1/52.Chief selector Ajit Agarkar and BCCI secretary Devajit Saikia were also present when the squad for the home T20I series against South Africa was picked here on Wednesday, just before the commencement of the second ODI between India and South Africa at the Shaheed Veer Narayan Singh Stadium.Gill sustained the injury during the opening Test against SA in Kolkata and retired hurt. Normally, the selection committee names squads for ODIs and T20Is at the same time during a series, but the selectors delayed picking the T20I squad as they waited for a final word from the BCCI’s medical specialists on Gill’s injury.Gill underwent rehab at the BCCI’s CoE in Bengaluru.Left-hand batter Rinku Singh and allrounder Nitish Kumar Reddy, who were part of the squad that toured Australia, were both dropped.Meanwhile, sources also denied reports that BCCI officials were planning to hold a meeting with Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma, coach Gautam Gambhir and Agarkar on any simmering tensions in the dressing room.","Gill, India’s vice-captain in T20Is, seems to have recovered from his neck injury.

BENGALURU: The Vijay Hazare Trophy will mark Virat Kohli ’s return to the white-ball domestic competition after a 15-year hiatus.It will also mark his return to Bengaluru after the tragic stampede outside the M Chinnaswamy Stadium during Royal Challengers Bengaluru’s maiden Indian Premier League title triumph in June this year.PTI on Tuesday quoted DDCA president Rohan Jaitley as saying, ""He [Virat Kohli] has confirmed his availability to play in the Vijay Hazare Trophy. How many games he will feature in, that is not clear yet.""The 37-year-old will turn out for Delhi, his domestic team, who are slated to play all seven of their Group D league games in Bengaluru.As per the original schedule, Delhi, who begin their campaign against Andhra on Dec 24 at the KSCA Alur Stadium, will play five matches at Alur and two at the Chinnaswamy — against Services on Jan 3, and Haryana on Jan 8.India’s wicketkeeper-batter Rishabh Pant is also likely to feature in these league fixtures, adding further star power.Confirming the fixtures, KSCA managing committee member in charge of cricket, MS Vinay, told TOI, “The matches are as per schedule at the two KSCA facilities. We have been hosting BCCI domestic matches since the start of the season without any hindrance. We will call for a managing committee meeting soon and discuss it.”But as the association continues to be denied permission to host matches with spectators, the question that looms is whether fans will be allowed into the Chinnaswamy.Vinay said the decision will rest with government authorities, adding, “Allowing spectators at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium is a decision that will be taken in consultation with the police department and other authorities. We can't say just yet that the matches will be held behind closed doors.”Even the Alur facility, though located on the city’s outskirts, has seen its share of crowd chaos. In 2017, when MS Dhoni turned up for Jharkhand in the same competition, with no spectator galleries at the venue, fans found vantage points along the compound wall.Expecting similar frenzy this time — perhaps more, given Kohli’s presence — the KSCA has begun preparations early.“We will also approach the city police commissioner concerning security at both venues,” Vinay added.",Virat Kohli will play for Delhi in Vijay Hazare Trophy.

Erling Haaland carved his name deeper into Premier League folklore on Tuesday night, becoming the fastest player in history to reach 100 Premier League goals as Manchester City edged Fulham 5–4 in a pulsating contest at Craven Cottage. The Norwegian superstar reached the landmark in just 111 league appearances, obliterating Alan Shearer’s long-standing record of 124 matches.Haaland’s milestone moment came in the 17th minute when Jeremy Doku picked him out with a sharp cut-back. The striker timed his run perfectly and hammered a ferocious finish past Bernd Leno — his 15th league goal of the season and 20th in all competitions.Pep Guardiola could only marvel at his No. 9. “It’s incredible, impressive… He was unbelievable today,” the City boss said. “Hopefully he’s starving hungry to continue with this club to make more and more goals.”Haaland later turned provider, slipping a clever pass to Tijjani Reijnders for City’s second before Phil Foden took charge, scoring twice as City raced into a seemingly unassailable 5–1 lead.But the night nearly turned disastrous. Fulham mounted a furious comeback, with goals from Emile Smith Rowe, Alex Iwobi and a brace from Samuel Chukwueze dragging the match to the brink of a historic upset.Only Josko Gvardiol’s last-gasp goal-line clearance denied Josh King an equaliser in stoppage time.Despite the win, Guardiola looked exasperated as his side once again flirted with collapse. “Of course I was concerned,” he admitted. “This will help us in future games… I’m so old, and the players don’t respect me!” he joked, reflecting the tension of the chaotic final half hour.City, now just two points behind leaders Arsenal, know they will need Haaland firing relentlessly if they are to secure a seventh league title under Guardiola. After going three matches without a goal, the 25-year-old ended his mini-drought in style — with a record that may stand for generations.","Erling Haaland became the fastest player in Premier League history to reach 100 Premier League goals as Manchester City beat Fulham 5-4.

Iranian defender Amirmahan Afrooziani’s attempt to connect with it failed, and as he fell down, India midfielder Gunleiba Wangkheirakpam, lurking on the left flank, took two touches before unleashing a fierce shot that took the deflection of Mohammad Ali Rahnama before landing in the Iranian goal. The goal sparked wild, delirious celebrations on the Indian bench, and Gunleiba was cautioned for his shirtless celebration.India still needed to keep Iran at bay for more than 40 minutes, and they defended with composure and rare resoluteness.

Alexander Isak scored his first Premier League goal for Liverpool, leading to a crucial 2-0 victory against West Ham at the London Stadium on Sunday.The Sweden forward had not scored in five Premier League appearances since his British record £125 million transfer from Newcastle in September.This was only Isak's second goal in 11 matches across all competitions for Liverpool, following his initial score in a League Cup victory against Southampton.Liverpool secured their first win in four games when Cody Gakpo added a second goal during stoppage time.""There's definitely a feeling of relief because if you have lost so many times, then winning is important. We hardly conceded a chance and we were able to create chances ourselves,"" Reds boss Arne Slot said.""It helps if you don't go 1-0 down after five minutes because then you are more open. We played the game I wanted us to play. What I saw meant a lot to our players and our fans. This is a good first step for us. We won and had a clean sheet.""Isak's performance had been affected by injuries and lack of match fitness after missing pre-season due to his extended transfer negotiations.The 26-year-old's goal marked his first league score since playing for Newcastle against Brighton in May, ending a 10-match goalless streak for both club and country.""I think it does feel significant,"" Slot said.Liverpool had faced recent challenges, including a 4-1 defeat against PSV Eindhoven in the Champions League and 3-0 losses to Manchester City and Nottingham Forest.The team had lost nine of their previous 12 games, marking their worst performance since 1953-54, including six defeats in seven league matches.The victory helped Liverpool move to eighth place, providing relief for Slot who faced mounting pressure.Mohamed Salah's performance has been a concern, with only five goals this season, leading to his third bench placement.West Ham honored their former captain and manager Billy Bonds, who passed away at 79, with a minute's applause.Despite West Ham's strong start, Liverpool gradually took control of the match.Isak initially struggled, missing a clear chance from the edge of the area and having a bicycle kick saved by Alphonse Areola.The Swedish striker finally scored after 60 minutes, converting Gakpo's assist with a low shot past Areola.Isak was substituted shortly after scoring, receiving acknowledgment from Slot on the sideline.West Ham's situation worsened when Lucas Paqueta received a red card in the 84th minute for two yellow cards, both for dissent against referee Darren England.The match concluded with Gakpo scoring from 12 yards following a defensive error by West Ham.","Liverpool defeated West Ham 2-0 at the London Stadium on Sunday.

Joshua Zirkzee scored his first Premier League goal in nearly a year, while Mason Mount secured the winning goal as Manchester United defeated Crystal Palace 2-1 on Sunday.Ruben Amorim's team initially fell behind when Jean-Philippe Mateta scored a first-half penalty at Selhurst Park. However, Zirkzee and Mount's second-half goals helped United secure their first victory in four matches.United overcame their slow start with Zirkzee's first Premier League goal since his strike against Everton in December 2024. The Dutch striker had experienced a 24-game goalless streak in the league, raising questions about his £36 million transfer from Bologna in 2024.Zirkzee, aged 24, had not found the net in his previous eight appearances since April. Mount, who has faced injury setbacks since joining from Chelsea, celebrated only his second goal of the season.This victory marked United's first win since October, providing relief for Amorim after their recent loss to 10-man Everton at Old Trafford. The win was particularly significant as it ended Palace's unbeaten home record in the Premier League, which had stood since February 15.""There are no excuses"" for United's struggling start to the season, Amorim had stated earlier in the week.Casemiro nearly gave United an early lead within the first minute when a long throw created confusion in Palace's defense, but Dean Henderson saved his close-range shot.Mateta missed an opportunity at the other end, failing to score after getting past Leny Yoro with only goalkeeper Senne Lammens to beat. Lammens then made saves from Daichi Kamada's low shot and helped defend against Yeremy Pino's attempt.Palace took the lead in the 36th minute through a penalty. Yoro fouled Mateta, who initially scored but had his goal disallowed for a double-touch violation.A new rule implemented this season allows successful penalties with accidental double-touches to be retaken. This rule clarification followed Julian Alvarez's disallowed penalty for Atletico Madrid against Real Madrid last season.Mateta successfully converted his second attempt past Lammens. Zirkzee, who had been quiet in the first half, equalized in the 54th minute with a remarkable shot from a difficult angle after receiving Bruno Fernandes' free-kick.Shortly after scoring, Zirkzee almost contributed to an own goal when he deflected the ball toward his own net, but it was cleared to safety.Mount put United ahead in the 63rd minute, scoring from a free-kick assist by Fernandes. His low shot went under the Palace wall and past Henderson from 20 yards out.",Manchester United defeated Crystal Palace 2-1 at Selhurst Park.

I feel it’s a good chance. It would be better if we have more Indian overseas players with Indian passport. If he’s available and playing outside, it would be very good. It would definitely improve our performance. In the last game (against Bangladesh) had Ryan Williams been there, we could have performed better,” Jamil remarked.After relinquishing his Australian passport to become an Indian citizen, Williams travelled to Dhaka as a member of Jamil’s squad but could not play because of the delay in getting the mandatory Fifa approval with respect to the change of member association.",Jamil’s stint with the Blue Tigers began with a creditable third-place finish in their maiden CAFA Nations Cup but it turned out to be false dawn earlier than anticipated.

Inter Miami head coach Javier Mascherano showered praise on Lionel Messi , calling him “extraordinary”, after the Argentine icon guided the club into their maiden MLS Cup final with a commanding 5-1 victory over New York City FC on Saturday.Miami’s charge to the championship match was led by a brilliant Tadeo Allende hat-trick, while Mateo Silvetti and Telasco Segovia also found the net in a dominant performance at Fort Lauderdale.Messi, 38, didn’t score on the night, but produced a moment of pure class when he set up Silvetti for Miami’s third goal. That assist came just as New York were closing in on an equaliser and effectively put the contest to bed.Mascherano, who previously shared the pitch with Messi for Barcelona and Argentina, said his star man continues to redefine what is possible.“Leo has spoiled us with the extraordinary,” Mascherano said. “He is unique, someone we won’t see again. Maybe people expected a goal today, but he brought calmness with that third goal. Only he can spot that pass. It basically ended the match.”Miami will now welcome either San Diego FC or the Vancouver Whitecaps, who face off later on Saturday, in next weekend’s MLS Cup final.The team enters the title clash in peak form, having smashed FC Cincinnati 4-0 in the previous round and now dismantling New York with similar ruthlessness.Allende was at the centre of Miami’s attacking storm once again. The 26-year-old struck first in the 14th minute after beating the offside trap, then doubled the lead with an outstanding header shortly after.New York responded through Justin Haak’s headed effort in the 37th minute and almost levelled when Julian Fernandez drew a superb save from Rocco Rios Novo in the 66th minute.That moment proved pivotal. Miami instantly countered, with Rodrigo De Paul and Jordi Alba combining before Messi threaded a perfectly weighted pass to Silvetti, who fired home for 3-1.Segovia made it 4-1 in the 83rd minute, and Allende completed his hat-trick a minute later, setting off huge celebrations.Mascherano credited the squad for turning around a season that once looked in disarray.“The players deserve the praise. They understood the direction we needed to take,” he said. “We grew stronger together and reached this stage with a real sense of unity. Everyone pulls in the same direction, and who starts doesn’t matter. The strength of this group is unshakeable.”",Inter Miami beat New York City FC 5-1 in MLS Eastern Conference final.

Jordon Hudson hopes Belichick makes an NFL comeback



Former New England Patriots coach Bill Belichick has been named among the finalists for the 2026 class of the Pro Football Hall of Fame. The Hall announced the news Wednesday morning, confirming that the eight time Super Bowl winner stands as the lone finalist in the coaching category. At 73, Belichick is not only a storied figure in the game but someone who continues to remain relevant in football discourse, even after shifting his career path to college coaching. According to ESPN sources, many of the Hall voters already view him as a clear favorite for induction.Later in the day, Belichick issued a heartfelt message reflecting on this milestone. His statement read: ""To be in this position is extremely humbling. I am honored to be named the Coaching Finalist for the Pro Football Hall of Fame Class of 2026. Thank you to the Selection Committee and the Pro Football Hall of Fame. I am thankful for the organizations and thousands of players and coaches that I worked with for my 49 years in the NFL. This is a cherishable reflection of all of my teammates throughout my NFL career. Congratulations to the other finalists Roger Craig, Kenny Anderson, L.C.Greenwood, and of course, Robert Kraft. I hope to see all of the deserving Patriots selected this year.""While Belichick has committed himself to another season at the University of North Carolina after a disappointing year, the personal side of his life intersects directly with his career decisions. Reports suggest that Jordon Hudson, whose relationship with Belichick has often sparked headlines, is quietly rooting for him to return to the NFL someday.

Taylor expressed disbelief at his comments, suggesting he lacks empathy for Americans struggling financially. This follows the administration's delayed action on affordability plans and a previous incident where Trump reportedly insulted a reporter, highlighting Taylor's consistent engagement with political matters.

Joy Taylor expresses skepticism regarding the President's empathy for the American public

Joy Taylor, the former FS1 host and popular sports analyst, did not hold back her criticism of U.S. President Donald Trump following his controversial comments regarding the rising cost of living in America. Taylor's sharp reaction came after Trump, during a Cabinet meeting, dismissed widespread worries about increasing prices, labeling the entire concern as a political fabrication.1The President's assertion that ""affordability is a hoax started by Democrats, who caused the pricing problems"" immediately drew fire from critics who argue the administration has failed to adequately address the financial struggles faced by everyday Americans. Taylor took to social media to amplify her disapproval, sharing a graphic of his remarks originally posted by the Democratic Party and adding her own potent commentary that quickly spread across platforms.The core of Trump's statement was a dismissive stance on the economic pain points of his constituents. He further characterized those expressing concern over prices, which he claimed he had already ""fixed,"" as ""scam artists.Con men and women."" The President's comments garnered particular scrutiny given the eight-month-long lack of action on a promised plan to tackle rising costs.Back in March, the administration, including Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, announced intentions to appoint an ""affordability czar"" to specifically focus on lowering prices for average citizens. Despite the public commitment, the position remains unfilled, and a concrete strategy is noticeably absent, undermining the administration's stated focus on cost-of-living issues.Reacting to the President's unapologetic dismissal of these financial struggles, Joy Taylor’s response was brief, yet deeply emphatic and widely shared. She wrote: “I’m CRYING laughing… he don’t give A F**K about y’all,”Taylor’s commentary highlights a growing public sentiment that the administration is disconnected from the economic realities of many Americans. This is not the first instance of the sports analyst using her platform to critique President Trump’s behavior. In a separate, earlier incident on November 14, Trump was reported to have snapped at Bloomberg White House reporter Catherine Lucey, telling her, “Quiet, piggy,” after she posed a question about the Jeffrey Epstein emails.Taylor reacted to that moment as well, sharing a Complex Instagram post with a joking comment directed at another figure, demonstrating her consistent willingness to weigh in on the President's conduct. Her ongoing commentary reflects a broader intersection of sports media figures engaging with high-profile political and social issues.Also Read: “I will make sure…”: Erika Kirk aimed to outshine Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce's stadium spectacle in tribute to Charlie Kirk","Joy Taylor took to social media to express her disbelief at President Donald Trump's comments on rising living costs.

Steinfeld described feeling ""more like myself and more beautiful"" in her Tamara Ralph gown, while Allen was ""stunned"" by her appearance. Their intimate San Ysidro Ranch wedding celebrated genuine love and shared presence.

Hailee Steinfeld choosing to see Josh Allen before the ceremony gives their wedding a refreshingly real twist

Hailee Steinfeld’s wedding to Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen wasn’t just another celebrity fairytale, it felt strikingly personal, intentional, and grounded in emotional closeness. Fresh off her honeymoon, Steinfeld opened up about the big day in her “Beau Society” newsletter, revealing the choice that truly set the tone for their celebration.Instead of adhering to the long-standing superstition that couples shouldn’t see each other before the ceremony, she and Allen began their day side by side. That decision gave a glimpse into a relationship built on connection rather than theatrics, a wedding focused less on ritual and more on reality, love, and shared presence. It’s a rarity in the spotlight, and fans are eating it up.In her newsletter, Steinfeld explained exactly why she turned tradition on its head. She wrote, “I don't think I could've gone the whole day without seeing him!” Instead of staying separate until the aisle, the couple shared a 7 a.m breakfast, with her “favorite lemon ricotta pancakes”, before getting ready. It was ordinary in the sweetest way.When it came to the gown, Steinfeld didn’t hold back on emotion: “On our wedding day, when I put on this dress, I actually lost my breath.I've never felt more like myself and more beautiful.” Designed by Tamara Ralph on a tight six-week timeline, the dress became a symbol of trust and creative intuition. Allen’s reaction was everything, she recalled him appearing “stunned” as she approached the altar.She gushed over Allen’s look as well, saying he appeared “like the man of every dream I've ever had.” Their ceremony at San Ysidro Ranch featured white roses, a sheer canopy, and a moment of surreal stillness as she walked toward him. After being pronounced husband and wife, they exited to Stevie Wonder’s “Signed, Sealed, Delivered (I’m Yours),” followed by thunder and later a late-night celebration that went until 3 a.m.By the time she concluded with, “Now we're back and it's been a whole 13 days of being married, and we'll be staying on this high forever!” it was clear: this wasn’t Hollywood pageantry. It was intimacy, honesty, and love, shared first thing in the morning over pancakes, and sealed in front of family, friends, and a sky rumbling with good omen.Also Read: Taylor Swift makes another drastic change to her wedding vision with Travis Kelce, hinting at a more personal ceremony","Hailee Steinfeld and Josh Allen defied wedding traditions by sharing breakfast before their ceremony.

Was the “Super Bowl Shuffle” more than a song and did it permanently change NFL pop culture?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/was-the-super-bowl-shuffle-more-than-a-song-and-did-it-permanently-change-nfl-pop-culture/articleshow/125745638.cms,"Super Bowl Shuffle (Getty Images)

How does the new documentary unravel the real story behind the “Super Bowl Shuffle” and its unexpected legacy?





The Shuffle | Official Trailer | HBO

The Super Bowl Shuffle was not supposed to work. It was a risky musical gamble, recorded before the Chicago Bears even secured their spot in the championship game. Yet something remarkable happened. The track took on a life of its own and turned into one of the most iconic sports-culture crossovers in American history, long before the word viral even existed. Today, a new generation gets a fresh look at that moment through HBO’s new documentary short, The Shuffle, which goes behind the curtains of how this oddball idea became a cultural phenomenon. It reveals the humor, hesitation and huge personalities behind the song that defined a season and electrified a city.The film takes viewers back to 1985, when cameras rolled, voices tightened, and the Bears danced through both uncertainty and optimism. The story unfolds not as a music project, but as an unlikely team-building experiment that welded athletes together in an unexpected way and ultimately became a rallying cry for their championship push.It was an unlikely success, and the documentary shows just how much so, detailing how “The Super Bowl Shuffle,” starring The Chicago Bears, became more than just a music video.Directed by Jeff Cameron and featuring Willie Gault, Mike Singletary, Jim McMahon and Gary Fencik, the film highlights how the song was recorded for charity, with proceeds going to the Chicago Community Trust. Yet convincing high-profile players to rap and dance about a game they had not yet earned was a challenge.As Gary Fencik recalls, “It just was one of those nights where you couldn’t imagine we could play that bad.” The Bears had just been humbled by the Miami Dolphins, losing 38 to 24, and still returned to Chicago to record the song. The stakes amplified as Mike Singletary admits the team “had to win the Super Bowl.”Behind the fun and swagger was a real struggle. The filming exposed how rhythm on turf did not translate to rhythm on stage. As Mike Fayette explains, “The fact that these guys couldn’t dance together actually became a post-production problem, because we had to create the illusion that they had some talent.” The solution was simple. “When you watch the video itself, you seldom had a take that’s more than two seconds long,” Fayette explains. The Fridge nailed his performance in one take. Other stars like Walter Payton and Jim McMahon resisted, skipping the shoot out of superstition, and were later edited in separately.The song soon swept across Chicago, peaking at number 41 on the Billboard Hot 100 and later earning a Grammy nomination. Fans bought VHS copies, radio stations kept it in constant rotation and Chicago embraced it as both a musical novelty and a badge of sports identity. As Singletary reflects, “We brought a city together.” That unity helped fuel the team’s confidence and momentum until they claimed victory in Super Bowl XX.Today, as the Bears enjoy a strong season, fans remember that magical winter when a rap video became a symbol of belief. The Shuffle documents not just a song, but a moment when culture, sport and community collided, shaping a legacy that still makes people smile, dance and remember.Also Read: Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift’s romance safeguarded by Chiefs president’s one beautiful promise: ""We're not going to monetize it""","The Super Bowl Shuffle was recorded before the Chicago Bears even secured their spot in the championship game.

Kayla Nicole’s comments on men needing constant attention spark speculation she’s calling out Travis Kelce,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/kayla-nicoles-comments-on-men-needing-constant-attention-spark-speculation-shes-calling-out-travis-kelce/articleshow/125742422.cms,"Kayla Nicole's recent comments on communication in relationships, particularly regarding instant responses, have sparked renewed interest due to her past with Travis Kelce. She advocates for balance, emphasizing that constant availability can signal insecurity rather than affection. Nicole is now focusing on her own ventures and defining relationships on her own terms.

Kayla Nicole’s current stance shows a deeper mindset shift beyond her past relationship narrative

Kayla Nicole’s recent comments about communication in relationships have created new buzz across NFL and celebrity culture, especially with her past connection to Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce . Speaking at “CultureCon Uncut,” she shared an insight that reflects not just personal preference, but a wider shift in how modern dating expectations are perceived.Nicole explained that eagerness and availability early in a relationship may look like affection, but can later expose insecurities or possessiveness. Her point resonates with many who value connection but also personal space: a reminder that constant digital availability shouldn’t be mistaken for emotional loyalty. This discussion resurfaced a familiar moment from her time with Kelce, giving fans new context through a different lens.When asked to name something that seems positive at first but ultimately backfires, Nicole pointed to the expectation of instant responses in dating. She noted that at first, being always reachable might feel exciting, almost flattering, but later it can become suffocating.“Like at first, when a guy is overly communicative and always available, cause it's like, ‘You call me, I pick up. I call you, you pick up. You text me, I respond immediately,’” she said.The key point, she added, is balance: “I love a communicator, also like, let's be understanding of like, I don't live in my phone. And I can't respond to you immediately at all times.”That emphasis on autonomy is notable given the resurfaced video from October 3, where Kelce leaned in and said: ""Just drink the wine so we can go,” followed by “Oh, my God. Get off your phone. Get off your phone. … You’re not even drinking your wine anymore, can we go?”While the internet eagerly linked her new stance to her old relationship, Nicole isn’t playing into the speculation. In fact, she’s moving in the opposite direction, lightheartedly joking on the “Boyfriend Material” podcast that she’s done dating players and is ready to date “the owners of the teams.”The comment may have been half-humor, half-intention, but it showed something clear: Nicole’s mindset has shifted from reaction to aspiration. She’s carving her own lane with Tribe Therepe and “Welcome To The Pregame,” and most importantly, defining relationships on her terms, not on the internet’s.Also Read: Taylor Swift makes another drastic change to her wedding vision with Travis Kelce, hinting at a more personal ceremony","Kayla Nicole’s recent comments about communication in relationships have created new buzz across NFL and celebrity culture.

Tom Brady “got screwed” for ignoring the biggest red flag in his marriage: Gisele Bündchen’s past with Leonardo DiCaprio,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/tom-brady-got-screwed-for-ignoring-the-biggest-red-flag-in-his-marriage-gisele-bndchens-past-with-leonardo-dicaprio/articleshow/125741574.cms,"Cultural commentator Pearl Davis reignited scrutiny of Tom Brady's romantic judgment, suggesting he overlooked Gisele Bündchen's past with Leonardo DiCaprio. Davis argued this created an imbalance, claiming Brady should have chosen a partner less accustomed to extreme celebrity. Despite the commentary, Brady and Bündchen have navigated their post-marriage life amicably.

Pearl Davis’ critique reopens conversations about power dynamics and high-status relationships

If Tom Brady Can't Win, Who Can?

In the years following Tom Brady and Gisele Bündchen’s high-profile separation, the narrative surrounding their relationship has shifted from tabloid fixation to retrospective analysis. But when cultural commentator Pearl Davis resurfaced this old conversation earlier in 2025, it reignited scrutiny of Brady’s romantic judgment.Davis argued that Brady, known for meticulous preparation on the field, failed to exhibit the same diligence in his personal life, particularly by overlooking Bündchen’s dating history, including her years with Leonardo DiCaprio. While this assessment arrived long after the divorce headlines cooled, it invited a fresh round of commentary on how fame, ego, and expectation can complicate relationships at the highest levels of celebrity.Davis didn’t mince words in her analysis, claiming Brady “got screwed” by not vetting Bündchen’s past partners with the same intensity he applied to game film. She asserted, “He didn’t look at Gisele’s dating history or really care about it… You know who Gisele dated before Tom Brady? Leonardo DiCaprio. So of course Gisele is going to think that Tom Brady is like a scrub.”Her angle wasn’t simply about jealousy, it was about comparative status.To Davis, being the follow-up to one of Hollywood’s biggest stars created an unavoidable psychological imbalance.She went even further, suggesting Brady might have avoided emotional fallout entirely had he chosen a partner who wasn’t accustomed to extreme celebrity attention. “He should’ve went to Boston College or something and found him a nice little 19-year-old, because now Tom Brady is going to be the most exciting thing that that 19-year-old has ever seen.”While many found her commentary inflammatory, others viewed it as insight into the complexities of relationships where public perception becomes part of the emotional equation. What stands out in hindsight is how Brady and Bündchen ultimately navigated post-marriage life with maturity, co-parenting amicably and building separate futures. Bündchen once explained that their children “get to learn from two different worlds and that’s wonderful for them. ”Today, with Brady’s post-NFL career flourishing, from broadcasting deals to expanding business ventures, the Pearl Davis commentary feels less like judgment and more like cultural speculation on a relationship that belonged to a very different era of celebrity.Also Read: Drake Maye’s wife Ann Michael becomes the new Patriots darling as fans poke fun at Gisele Bündchen","Pearl Davis’ critique reopens conversations about power dynamics and high-status relationships.

Did Travis Kelce push back against Taylor Swift’s strict prenup demands? Podcaster stirs debate,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/did-travis-kelce-push-back-against-taylor-swifts-strict-prenup-demands-podcaster-stirs-debate/articleshow/125741430.cms,"Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce's engagement is a major talking point. Fans are discussing their finances and relationship. Swift's upcoming docu-series offers a look at their romance. The couple's journey began with an unexpected public interaction. They are navigating their engagement under intense public attention. Their wedding plans are eagerly awaited.

Financial boundaries, romantic optimism, and what the prenup talk says about their dynamic

Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce’s engagement hasn’t just thrilled fans of music and football, it has ignited a full-on cultural debate around money, marriage, and modern celebrity relationships. With Swift’s billion-dollar empire and Kelce’s NFL fortune colliding, fans are curious how the pair intends to navigate financial boundaries while protecting their personal bond.This speculation has been amplified by Swift’s upcoming Disney+ docu-series and podcast discussions dissecting behind-the-scenes glimpses of their romance. Yet beneath all the noise lies something deeper: a relationship that started not with private dinners or elite networking, but with a very public display of awkward charm that blossomed into something real.On the “Pop Apologists” podcast, Lauren Atkinson floated her impression of how Swift might approach the financial agreement, suggesting, ""I don't know there's just something about this where I could see her being like yeah, like there is just no combining of assets. I could see the prenup being just like what's yours is yours and what's mine is mine.”“Whatever we each make stays ours..."" Her tongue-in-cheek advice for Kelce added a layer of humor: ""...andwhat I think Travis Kelce should do is he should say no. What's yours is yours and what's mine is also yours. That is only way to approach a prenuptial agreement.""This framing captures what fans love most about the couple: Swift’s independence and Kelce’s affectionate, slightly self-deprecating devotion. And while financial negotiations are likely pragmatic rather than dramatic, the public conversation underscores how invested people have become in their love story.Meanwhile, Swift’s docu-series, The End of an Era, offers a rare emotional window into the relationship. Reflecting on its humble spark, Swift says, “The most meaningful relationship I’ve ever had… started with a man saying he was butthurt that I didn’t want to meet him,” referencing Kelce’s now-famous complaint on his “New Heights” podcast after failing to connect with her at Arrowhead Stadium.From financial planning to playful origin stories, Swift and Kelce are navigating engagement under a spotlight few couples could endure. Whether their wedding lands right after the NFL season or later, the world isn’t just waiting for a date, it's watching the evolution of a modern-era celebrity partnership built on humor, respect, and surprisingly relatable beginnings.Also Read: Taylor Swift makes another drastic change to her wedding vision with Travis Kelce, hinting at a more personal ceremony",Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce's engagement is a major talking point.

Insider opens up about Will Campbell’s brutal injury



The New England Patriots’ star player, Will Campbell, suffered a brutal knee injury in Week 12 when the team won against the Cincinnati Bengals.Since then, Will Campbell has not returned to the field and even though the Patriots are dominating the field, fans are still concerned about the star player. Amid this, NFL insiders have opened up on Will Campbell’s injury and a possible return timeline.A few hours ago, popular NFL insider, ESPN's Jeremy Fowler, opened up about Will Camobell and Milton Williams’ return to the field.ESPN’s Jeremy Fowler said, ""Williams has validated his massive free agent contract with impressive play, and Campbell has protected Drake Maye's blind side with ferocity…Both should be back before the playoffs, but how New England holds up in the meantime bears watching.""A few days ago, on NBC Sports Boston’s pregame coverage, Sports Illustrated’s Albert Breer opened up about Will Campbell’s brutal injury.Sports Illustrated’s Albert Breer said, “Well, he’s not out for the year, but this is a very significant injury. He has a Grade 3 MCL sprain. That essentially means his MCL is torn. It’s a four-to-six week injury.”The popular NFL insider added, “They’re going to try to get him back for the last game of the regular season…Even that may be pushing it a little bit.This is not a minor injury, though. This is an MCL tear, a Grade 3 MCL sprain, which again necessitates a four-to-six-week recovery.”Sports Illustrated’s Albert Breer continued, “I just think it’s one of those where you have to be careful about guys pushing it…It’s the type of injury that you can aggravate, and you can make worse by playing on it. So I think in a certain way, the Patriots put him on IR, trying to look out for him and trying to make sure that he does go through as full a recovery as you can in season.”However, neither the team, the New England Patriots nor the star player, Will Campbell, has confirmed the possible timeline for him to return to the field.Also Read: Drake London injury update: Falcons coach breaks silence on his recovery and possible comeback timeline after brutal loss to the New York Jets","NFL insiders have opened up on Will Campbell’s injury and a possible return timeline.

Deshaun Watson back in Browns practice: What the 21-day return window really means



After months of waiting, Browns fans finally have some good news, QB Deshaun Watson is back on the practice field. The 2025 season hasn’t gone as planned for Cleveland, and Watson hasn’t played a single game since re-injuring his Achilles last year. Now, with the team designating him for a return to practice, the quarterback has a 21-day window to show he’s ready to rejoin the roster. It’s a cautious step, but for a player with such a high-profile contract and injury history, it’s a huge moment.On December 3, 2025, the Cleveland Browns officially designated Watson for return to practice. This starts a 21-day evaluation window, during which the team decides whether to activate him to the 53-man roster or keep him on the reserve/PUP list. Coach Kevin Stefanski stressed that the focus isn’t rushing Watson into games, it’s simply getting him back on the field, throwing passes, and participating in drills. This procedural move confirms Watson is physically progressing but doesn’t guarantee game action.Watson’s journey back hasn’t been easy. He ruptured his right Achilles in Week 7 of the 2024 season and later re-ruptured it during rehab, requiring a second surgery in January 2025.With over a year out of action, many assumed he’d miss the entire 2025 season. Adding to the drama, his massive $230 million fully guaranteed contract has kept him in the spotlight, making his recovery and potential return a major talking point for fans and analysts alike.Even with Watson back in practice, the Browns’ quarterback situation remains complicated. Shedeur Sanders and Dillon Gabriel have been leading the team this season, with Joe Flacco briefly in the mix. Watson’s return is largely about testing his health and giving him a chance to acclimate to football activities again. If he impresses during the 21-day window, he could see limited late-season action, but his presence may be more valuable as a mentor and insurance policy than as an immediate starter.Browns fans on social media are buzzing. Some are cautiously excited, hoping to see Watson back under center, while others are skeptical given his long layoff. Regardless of opinions, one thing is clear, Watson’s name is trending again in Cleveland, and fans are glued to updates.Even if he doesn’t suit up in 2025, Watson’s progress gives hope for 2026 and keeps his legendary contract in play, while showing that the Browns are committed to getting him back in action safely.Also read - Is Jayden Daniels returning this week?

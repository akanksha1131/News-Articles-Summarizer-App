Jannik Sinner defeated Novak Djokovic in straight sets 6-4, 7-5, 7-6 (7/3) at the French Open semi-finals on Friday, setting up a final clash with defending champion Carlos Alcaraz, who advanced when Lorenzo Musetti retired due to injury. This victory marks Sinner's first Grand Slam final appearance, while ending Djokovic's quest for a record-breaking 25th major title.World number one Sinner maintained his impressive form, remaining undefeated in sets throughout the tournament. The match lasted three hours and 16 minutes on Court Philippe Chatrier.""He is the best player in the history of our sport, playing against him here is amazing,"" said Sinner. ""Of course I try to not think about this but before coming on court you feel the tension.""The 23-year-old Italian showed remarkable composure, particularly when breaking back immediately after failing to serve out the second set. He hit 44 winners across the three sets and successfully defended three set points in the tenth game of the third set.Djokovic, at 38, remained resilient throughout the contest but ultimately couldn't convert the crucial set points in the third set.""Obviously Wimbledon is next, which is my childhood favourite tournament,"" said Djokovic. ""I'm going to do everything possible to get myself ready. I guess my best chances maybe are Wimbledon, to win another Slam, or faster hard court, maybe Australia or something like that.""The Serbian champion reflected on his future at Roland Garros: ""This could have been the last match ever I played here, so I don't know. I don't know really what tomorrow brings in a way at this point in my career. You know, I'm going to keep on keeping on.""In the other semi-final, Alcaraz advanced when Musetti retired with a leg injury while trailing 4-6, 7-6 (7/3), 6-0, 2-0.""It's never great to go through or win a match when it's like this,"" said Alcaraz. ""He's done an incredible clay season. I wish him all the best, a quick recovery and that he'll be back soon.""The 22-year-old Spaniard, seeking his fifth Grand Slam title, expressed confidence ahead of the final: ""It's been three intense weeks and now I have one step to make. I'll give everything on Sunday, I've been playing great tennis this tournament.""Sinner acknowledged the challenge ahead, considering his recent record against Alcaraz, who has won their last four encounters, including the Italian Open final following Sinner's return from a three-month doping ban.""Sunday is going to be very difficult, I know my head-to-head lately doesn't look great against Carlos but let's see what I can do,"" said Sinner.The upcoming final marks several significant milestones. It will be the first Grand Slam final between two players born in the 2000s, with neither finalist having lost a major final before.The tournament also features a rare occurrence where the top two seeds will contest both the men's and women's finals, with Aryna Sabalenka and Coco Gauff set to compete for the Coupe Suzanne Lenglen on Saturday.Musetti's semi-final match saw him take the first set before Alcaraz gained momentum. The Italian received treatment on his left thigh during the third set, where he managed only five points in 22 minutes before retiring early in the fourth set.",Jannik Sinner beats Novak Djokovic in straight sets to reach French Open final.

NEW DELHI: KL Rahul stormed back into form with a sublime century on the opening day of the second unofficial Test against England Lions in Northampton on Friday.Put into bat first, India A tweaked their playing XI from the previous game, promoting Rahul to open alongside Yashasvi Jaiswal, while skipper Abhimanyu Easwaran moved down to No. 3. But Chris Woakes struck early, removing Jaiswal (17) and Easwaran (11) cheaply, leaving Rahul to steady the innings.Rahul combined caution with well-timed aggression as he expertly built his innings. He reached his hundred in the 56th over and went on to score 116 off 168 balls, laced with 15 fours and a six — a classy knock that couldn’t have come at a better time, with the five-Test series against England starting June 20 at Headingley.Since making his Test debut at the MCG in 2014, Rahul has played 58 Tests for India, scoring 3,257 runs at an average of 33.57. Among the current Indian squad touring England, he remains one of the most seasoned in English conditions. In nine Tests there, he has tallied 614 runs at 34.11, including two centuries and a fifty, with a best of 149.At the other end, Dhruv Jurel extended his fine run of form. After scores of 94 and 53* in the first unofficial Test, the young wicketkeeper-batter compiled a gritty 52 off 87 balls.His 121-run partnership with Rahul helped revive India A’s innings after the early blows.Jurel’s stay ended when George Hill bowled him through the gate.

NEW DELHI: Mitchell Starc remains “heavily committed” to Delhi Capitals in the Indian Premier League, but admitted that “time will tell the repercussions” of his decision not to return for the remainder of the tournament, unlike some of his Australian teammates. The pacer opted out of the IPL’s resumption on May 17, following a 10-day break triggered by Operation Sindoor — a military response to Pakistan-backed terrorists killing 26 civilians in Pahalgam.Starc, who played a key role in Delhi Capitals’ bowling attack with 14 wickets in 11 games, last featured in the May 8 clash against Punjab Kings in Dharamsala. That match was abandoned after the stadium lights went out abruptly.His wife and Australia Women’s team captain Alyssa Healy was also present at the stadium when the match was halted and an urgent evacuation was ordered due to Dharamsala’s proximity to the international border.Starc revealed he had apprehensions before taking the field in that game between Delhi Capitals and Punjab Kings amid growing tensions.“I’m comfortable with my decision and how I felt about the whole situation and how it was handled,” Starc was quoted as saying by The Age.“That’s why I made my decision post-that, and my focus changed to red-ball cricket for about a week prior to coming over here (the UK).”“Time will tell with repercussions or how it looks with guys that didn’t return.But I’ve had my questions and concerns leading into that game, and obviously we saw what happened, which played a part in my decision,” he said.Citing similar concerns, Starc had earlier chosen not to travel to Pakistan for the Champions Trophy with the Australian squad.“There was a little bit of that to my decision around the Champions Trophy (in Pakistan) and then once the tournament (IPL) was delayed, you start to think about guys’ preparation for the Test match,” he said, referring to Australia’s upcoming World Test Championship final against South Africa at Lord’s starting June 11.Starc also pointed out that the situation in Dharamsala was handled differently across teams and individuals. Both teams and the broadcast crew were evacuated to Delhi from Pathankot via a special train.“Things were handled differently for different players and different teams, the guys up in Dharamsala, the Punjab guys were part of that, and while both teams had similar experiences up there, all those guys returned for Punjab, and Jake (Fraser-McGurk) and I chose not to,” he said.“It was a very individual decision, and I’m happy to live with whatever comes of that.”“I’m still heavily committed to the Delhi group, and I’m not someone that’s gone into tournaments and pulled out after being picked up in an auction or whatever that looks like. These are different circumstances,” he added.Starc, who was part of the Kolkata Knight Riders’ title-winning campaign last season, also explained that a lack of clarity contributed to his decision to skip the second half of the season.“It was more a question of not having enough information leading into making a decision (about) things of that degree. I had a discussion back home then came to a decision, and whatever comes from that I’m comfortable with that and we move forward,” he said.","Mitchell Starc says he is 'heavily committed' to Delhi Capitals in Indian Premier League.

NEW DELHI: After over two decades of dedicated service to Indian cricket , leg-spinner Piyush Chawla has officially announced his retirement from all forms of the game.A veteran of the sport, Chawla’s journey has been marked by early promise, notable comebacks, and contributions to India’s most iconic cricketing triumphs: the 2007 ICC T20 World Cup and the 2011 ODI World Cup.Chawla’s statement on Friday reflected deep gratitude and emotion, as he thanked his family, IPL franchises, and fans.He credited his late father for being the guiding force behind his career, saying his support laid the foundation for a path that saw Chawla go from bowling out legends like Sachin Tendulkar at just 17, to delivering match-winning spells on the world stage.Making his India debut as a teenager, Chawla impressed early on with a clever mix of googlies and quicker deliveries.He played three Tests, 25 ODIs, and seven T20Is for India, with career-best figures of 4/23 in ODIs.His international appearances might have been limited, but his impact in domestic and franchise cricket was immense.With 446 first-class wickets and 319 T20 wickets, Chawla remained a consistent performer for Uttar Pradesh and various IPL teams, including Kolkata Knight Riders, where he won the title in 2012 and 2014.The IPL, in particular, was a significant chapter in his career, and Chawla leaves as one of the league's highest wicket-taking spinners.

Carlo Ancelotti's debut as coach of Brazil ended in a goalless draw in Ecuador in South American World Cup qualifying on Thursday.Argentina, already assured of a place in next year's tournament, beat Chile 1-0 in Santiago with a goal from Julian Alvarez, a result which guarantees Lionel Scaloni's team top spot and leaves bottom placed 'La Roja' with virtually no hope of qualifying.Ancelotti, the 65-year-old Italian, who left Real Madrid at the end of the European season, has been charged with taking Brazil through the latter stages of qualifying for the 2026 World Cup.The former AC Milan and Chelsea manager replaced Dorival Junior, who was sacked at the end of March after the 4-1 thrashing at the hands of reigning champions and bitter rivals Argentina.Thursday's result leaves the Selecao in fourth place in the qualifying table on 22 points while Ecuador, the surprise package in the campaign, remain in second on 24 points.Argentina lead the standings on 34 points and are the only team to have officially secured their place in the tournament which will be held in the USA, Canada and Mexico.Paraguay, who enjoyed a 2-0 win over Marcelo Bielsa's Uruguay, sit in third place, level on points with Ecuador.Ecuador knew a win would put them on the brink of qualification and there was a packed crowd at the Estadio Monumental in Guayaquil.But the home side were dealt a blow just before kick-off when goalkeeper Hernan Galindez suffered a muscle strain in the warm-up and replacement Gonzalo Valle was hurriedly sent out to make his debut.If Valle had any nerves they eased when he did well to parry a shot from inside the box from Vinicius Jr. who had been set up by Gerson following a turnover.Chances were limited in a contest where neither side was able to get control of midfield.The pattern continued after the break with Ecuador, missing their injured striker and talisman Enner Valencia, struggling to pose a threat.Real Madrid star Vinicius was quiet for much of the game and with Rodrygo absent, Brazil also lacked potency in attack.The best opening came in the 75th minute when Vinicius broke down the left and cut back to Casemiro, but the Manchester United midfielder, recalled to the national side by Ancelotti, saw a tame side-footed effort easily dealt with by Valle.While there was no instant impact from Ancelotti, Vinicius, who played under the coach in Madrid, said he needed time to make his impact felt.""I'm very happy to have Ancelotti here with us, because I've always said he's the best coach I've ever worked with. Having the opportunity to work with him in the Brazilian national team is the best,"" the winger told SporTV.""He hasn't had time to show his work, his game plan, because he's only had two or three days of training,"" he added.Atletico Madrid striker Alvarez put Argentina ahead at the Estadio Nacional in the 16th minute with a deft finish after he had been put through by a perfectly weighted pass from Thiago Almada. Lionel Messi came off the bench in the 57th minute but Chile sensed a chance to get something from the game and created more as the game progressed.Argentina keeper Emiliano Martinez made a series of crucial saves and Lucas Cepeda went closest with a fierce shot which struck the bar.Cepeda then had the best chance of the game when he was found at the back post but he blasted his volley wide.Messi set up Giuliano Simeone with a chance to make it 2-0 but the son of former Argentina captain and Atletico Madrid coach Diego, fired his shot into the side netting.A header from midfielder Matias Galarza just 13 minutes into the game and a late penalty from Julio Enciso earned Paraguay a crucial victory over a depleted Uruguay.The victory left Paraguay on the verge of securing their return to the World Cup for the first time since qualifying for the 2010 finals in South Africa.Victory in Sao Paulo on Tuesday against Brazil would secure their place in the tournament.The top six teams in the 10-team qualifying group head directly into the World Cup draw while the seventh placed team must enter the inter-confederation playoffs.",Carlo Ancelotti's debut as coach of Brazil ends in a goalless draw in Ecuador in South American World Cup qualifying.

Uzbekistan and Jordan made history on Thursday by qualifying for their first World Cup, while the pair will be joined in next year's tournament by perennial participants South Korea.Uzbekistan, one of the fastest-rising national teams in Asia, drew 0-0 with the UAE in Abu Dhabi to take the second automatic spot in Group A, although top place is still in play after already qualified Iran lost 1-0 to Qatar in Doha.Heading into the third round's final set of fixtures on Tuesday, Iran sit at the summit, two points ahead of Uzbekistan.The top two teams in each of the three Asian groups go straight to the World Cup, while those finishing third and fourth -- the UAE and Qatar hold those slots in Group A -- enter a fourth round of qualifiers.In Group B, South Korea confirmed their place in an 11th straight World Cup by defeating Iraq 2-0 in Basra.The victory, sealed by second-half goals from Kim Jin-gyu and Oh Hyeon-gyu, means South Korea reclaim top spot from Jordan, whose 3-0 victory against Oman earlier on Thursday ultimately proved enough to secure their participation at the expanded 48-team showpiece in the United States, Canada and Mexico.Jordan's King Abdullah II congratulated the team on social media.""This historic qualification is well-deserved by our team, which includes stars and cadres of whom we are proud,"" he wrote on X.""Special thanks go to our loyal fans who have been our support and encouragement.""Ali Olwin netted a hat-trick as the 2023 Asian Cup runners-up etched their name in the record books.Iraq were reduced to 10 men midway through the first half when Ali Al Hamadi's foul on Cho Yu-min was upgraded to a red card following a VAR review.Iraq sit third in Group B, with Oman and Palestine still able to progress to the fourth round of qualifying. Palestine, who defeated Kuwait 2-0 in Ardhiya, host Oman on Tuesday, while Iraq face Jordan in Amman.Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia and Australia will go head-to-head on Tuesday for the second automatic spot in Group C.Australia remain in pole position following their last-gasp win against group leaders Japan in Perth.Defender Aziz Behich was the home hero in front of more than 57,000 fans, rifling into the corner in the 90th minute to give Tony Popovic's side a crucial 1-0 victory.""We know there's room to grow and room to improve, but we've done something special tonight,"" said Popovic, who saw his team outplayed for long periods by an experimental Japan side.Saudi Arabia ensured the race for second place will go down to the wire courtesy of a 2-0 win against Bahrain in Riffa. Goals in either half from Musab Al Juwayr and Abdulrahman Al Obud saw Herve Renard's men stay three points behind second-placed Australia.However, the Saudis will have to win in Jeddah by five goals to leapfrog the Socceroos.Popovic, who replaced Graham Arnold in the dugout in September, added: ""We've all played a part in getting us to this point. We want to go to Saudi Arabia and really finish the job off.""Also in Group C, Patrick Kluivert's Indonesia kept alive their hopes of reaching a first World Cup since the country's independence in 1945 with a 1-0 win over China.That leaves Indonesia fourth in the group, one point behind Saudi. Ole Romeny scored the only goal, his controversial penalty just before half time following a VAR check leaving China rooted to the bottom of the group and thus ending their hopes of making a second World Cup.",Uzbekistan and Jordan qualify for their first-ever FIFA World Cup tournament.

Portugal secured a 2-1 comeback victory against Germany in their Nations League semifinal in Munich on Wednesday.

PATHUM THANI (THAILAND): A lacklustre India lost 0-2 against Thailand in an international football friendly in a reality check ahead of their crucial Asian Cup qualifying round match on Wednesday.Benjamin Davis and Poramet Arjvilai scored for Thailand in the 8th and 59th minute respectively as the home side dominated the match at the Thammasat Stadium.India had won the last two matches between the two sides before Wednesday's defeat but Thailand, ranked 99th in the world, were clearly the better side on the day.India are currently ranked a lowly 127th.The talismanic Sunil Chhetri , who had scored twice in India's 4-1 win against Thailand in the 2019 AFC Asian Cup, nearly scored in the 24th minute but his glancing header was saved by a diving Thailand goalkeeper Saranon Anui.India had also beaten Thailand 1-0 in the Kings Cup in 2019.Thailand were technically bettered equipped and more clinical while India were left ruing missed opportunities and costly defensive lapses. The Indian midfield also lacked creativity.This was the Indian team's second defeat in seven matches under head coach Manolo Marquez, the last one being 0-3 loss to Syria in the Intercontinental Cup last year in Hyderabad.Out of the five remaining matches under his charge, four were drawn games while the lone win came against Maldives (3-0) in March in an international friendly.Thailand made their early dominance count. Phitiwat Sookjitthammakul found Korawich Tasa near the edge of the Indian box in the eighth minute. Tasa smartly laid it off for Ben Davis, who took a deft first touch to steady himself before unleashing a thunderous right-footed shot past Indian goalkeeper Vishal Kaith.It was Davis’ fourth goal in seven appearances for Thailand, and the Indian backline was left exposed, reacting too late to close him down.India gradually grew into the game, using the width of the pitch to stretch the Thailand defence. Liston Colaco, operating fluently between midfield and the left flank, was a standout performer, linking up well with Sunil Chhetri and forward Ashique Kuruniyan.India's first opportunity to level the score in the first half came in the 24th minute. Colaco delivered a teasing free-kick from the left which Chhetri met with a clever header, timing his run perfectly to get ahead of his marker. However, Thailand goalkeeper Saranon Anuin dived to his left to pull off a sharp save.Thailand continued to pose threat on the Indian citadel, with long-range efforts from Korawich Tasa and Arjvilai narrowly missing the target.The momentum began to shift slightly in India’s favour as the half wore on. Abhishek came close with a driven shot from distance that missed the horizontal by inches in the 40th minute.But the golden opportunity arrived in first-half stoppage time. Chhetri played a sublime through ball from midfield to find Colaco’s run, splitting the Thai defence. Colaco brought the ball under control but couldn’t finish the one-on-one chance as Anuin narrowed the angle to eventually thwart the danger with a timely save.In the 59th minute, a miss pass in the midfield gifted Thailand ball possession. The ball was quickly fed to Arjvilai on the left flank. Spotting Vishal Kaith slightly off his line after sidestepping Ashish Rai, Arjvilai curled a magnificent effort into the top-right corner to double Thailand’s lead and deflate Indian hopes.Substitute Lallianzuala Chhangte got a fine chance in the 80th minute but his left footer went just wide of the upright.The Changsuek, meanwhile, looked to exploit the spaces India left behind and could have added a third if not for a crucial intervention by Anwar Ali, who threw himself in front of a goal-bound shot in the dying moments.The match was part of preparation for India's crucial AFC Asian Cup qualifying round match against Hong Kong on June 10 in Kowloon.The same was also the case for Thailand as they face Turkmenistan in their AFC Asian Cup final round qualifier.",Benjamin Davis and Poramet Arjvilai scored for Thailand in the 8th and 59th minute respectively.

PANAJI: Naushad Moosa has returned as head coach of the India under-23 squad. This time, he has been handed a longer rope, stretching a year, and tasked with preparing the team for next year’s Asian Games and the AFC U-23 Asian Cup, qualifiers for which will be held in September.Last year, Moosa, assistant to Juan Pedro at NorthEast United, was in charge of the under-23 team for two friendlies against Malaysia in Kuala Lumpur.“The longer contract helps me understand the players better,” Moosa told TOI in a recent interview. “I spoke with the AIFF and told them it’s important to have longer camps as well, so that we can properly assess the players and opponents. I want to bring the best out of these players. Getting them to gel together, though, will be a challenge.”Moosa, a former international who played for India between 1994 and 1998 and won the SAFF Championship in 1997, has named a 29-member probable squad for the two friendlies in Dushanbe against Tajikistan and Kyrgyz Republic, later this month. A concern for Moosa is that a majority of players are with ISL clubs. Many of them are without enough playing time in the top tier of Indian football.“The younger under-19 players, all of them want to play for ISL clubs. My advice is don’t jump (straightway) into the ISL. Of course, you should try, but only a few make it to the top. The youngsters can sign for clubs where they get to play. At this age, it’s important for them to be playing competitive matches. Sitting on the bench for financially-rich clubs doesn't really help in their growth as players,” said Moosa.“The younger players in the ISL are not getting enough opportunities. There are a lot of promising players in the I-League who we will track,” added Moosa.From amongst the 29 probables, only a handful have featured regularly for their teams in the ISL. Just one among them, Vibin Mohanan, has a senior team appearance, though Ayush Chhetri, Abhishek Singh and Suhail Bhat, all aged below 23, are currently under Manolo Marquez with the national team.Mohammed Sanan, Nikhil Barla (both Jamshedpur), Korou Singh, Bikash Yumnam (both Kerala Blasters), Macarton Louis Nickson, Parthib Gogoi (both NorthEast United) and Dipendu Biswas (Mohun Bagan) are the more recognisable names among the under-23 probables.Only two players -- Rahul Raju (Gokulam Kerala) and Mohammad Arbaz (Real Kashmir) – are doing duty in the I-League, the second tier tournament.“We need to have more camps, more exposure matches. If we cannot travel abroad, we can play here, but with stronger opponents. Losing is not a problem. It’s important we play stronger opponents to prepare for the challenges. Our aim should not be to win SAFF. We must look at the bigger stage where we will be properly judged,” said Moosa.India U-23 will face Tajikistan and Kyrgyz Republic in two friendlies on June 18 and June 21 as part of the AIFF’s long-term plans to smoothen a pathway to the senior national team.The team is in Kolkata where they will train before setting off for Dushanbe on June 16.",India U-23 coach Naushad Moosa has been handed a long-term contract by the AIFF.

Jadon Sancho will leave Chelsea when his loan spell ends on June 30 after failing to agree on personal terms for a permanent transfer, despite having helped the club secure Champions League qualification with a fourth-place Premier League finish. The Englishman scoring in the UEFA Conference League final against Real Betis was not enough to hand him a permanent deal at Stamford Bridge.The 25-year-old winger joined Chelsea last summer from Manchester United on a temporary deal that included a £25million obligation to buy clause, subject to personal terms being agreed upon with the player.However, the club have opted against it and will now have to pay a fine of £5million to get out of the obligation. The Manchester United player, who still has a year left on his deal at Old Trafford is now exploring options both in England and across Europe for his next move.During his time at Chelsea, Sancho's numbers did not amount to anything significant, although he bagged five goals and ten assists in 42 appearances across all competitions.Speaking after the Conference League final, Maresca addressed Sancho's future, stating: ""From now on is when we sit down with the club and decide about next year.""The manager further praised Sancho's contribution, saying: ""Jadon Sancho, if we finished fourth, it's because of Jadon, if we won tonight it's because of Jadon. It's also because of Robert Sanchez — during the season, everyone is up and down a little bit, that's part of the game. ""While unable to strike a deal with the Blues, the 25-year-old is on the lookout for a new club, be it in the Premier League or elsewhere. While United prepares to negotiate with other clubs to offload the high-wage winger, who reportedly makes close to£300,000 a week, his current wage may prevent a permanent deal from materialising. Sancho has been linked with the likes of West Ham United and the Saudi Pro League.","Jadon Sancho will leave Chelsea when his loan spell ends on June 30.

The two had started in the same positions on the grid but in reverse order. It was, nevertheless, a double gain for Porsche on Sunday.Talking about the Round 11 race, Wehrlein said, “Very tricky conditions especially in the beginning, I think it got a little bit better towards the end, but our pace was good. Not good enough for P1, but quite far ahead of the guys behind. Personally I’m very happy about the result today because today was the first time that I felt like we were very competitive in the wet, which wasn’t the case in Tokyo and Monaco. I think we’ve found a good way there and in the end a happy ending for us. ”The two also scored double podiums at the Mexico E-Prix and then again in Miami, where Wehrlein won. He earned another podium at the Tokyo E-Prix.With such a strong performance this year, Wehrlein currently holds second place in the Formula E Driver Standings with 103 points.“It was a very strong result today in very tricky and challenging wet conditions,” Porsche Formula E boss Florian Modlinger stated after the double podium in Round 11.

We'd like to address those comments that he made I believe on the team radio. Number one, thank you for the free publicity. We'll take that any day of the week.

Starting second and finishing third is not ideal – in the beginning I thought we had something, but then it was clear to me that I didn’t have the pace of the two cars in front, so it was all about bringing the podium home.”Antonio now stands third in the 2025 Formula E Driver Standings with 88 points.Taking to Instagram after the race, Antonio Felix Da Costa shared a picture of himself spraying champagne from the podium.

Midway through the first set of the French Open women’s singles semifinals, after world No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka had taken a 4-1 lead, which was duly narrowed and eclipsed, the Belarusian battled inner demons.The crowd on Court Philippe Chatrier appeared to be behind the four-time champion Iga Swiatek, and then, the 27-year-old gave herself a talk.“Fight,” she told herself, looking down at the tiger tattoo on her left forearm, “fight”, she reminded herself again.The top seed, who was blasting the ball off both flanks, gave it everything she had for the next couple of hours to score a 7-6 (1), 4-6, 6-0 win in two hours and 19 minutes to make her first Roland Garros final.In Saturday’s title clash, she’ll play World No. 2 Coco Gauff, who stopped French wildcard entrant Lois Boisson’s fairytale run with a 6-1, 6-2 win.Sabalenka, who came into the last-four clash as the in-form player, demonstrated how far ahead of the field she was in the deciding set which she wrapped up in 22 minutes.Swiatek won just six points in the set in which her opponent had zero unforced errors.Swiatek, who has the highest winning percentage at Roland Garros in the Open Era (95.2 per cent, 40-2), had won her last 26 matches in the French capital, equalling the longest winning streak at a Grand Slam event this century (26, Serena Williams at the US Open 2012–2015), was put on the back foot by Sabalenka’s power.The 5’11’’ Belarusian, who can be seen stretching between points — neck, shoulders and arms — dominated with her power.Sabalenka had 28 winners in the match; add to that the Pole’s 26 forced errors — 15 on the forehand side and 11 on the backhand — the result of the 27-year-old opening her shoulders and moving the ball from corner to corner.“It feels incredible, but I also understand the job is not done yet,” Sabalenka said. “I’m thrilled with my performance. Iga is the toughest opponent, especially on clay and at Roland Garros. I’m proud I was able to get this win. It was a tough match, it was tricky, but I managed it somehow and I’m super proud right now. I’m glad I found my serve (in the third set). 6-0.”Swiatek applauded Aryna’s effort. “She served really well, and she read my serve much better,” the 24-year-old said.Italian pair Sara Errani and Andrea Vavassori beat Americans Taylor Townsend and Evan King 6-4, 6-2 to win the French Open mixed doubles title. It is their second Grand Slam title together following their victory in the same event at last year’s US Open.","Aryna Sabalenka beats Iga Swiatek 7-6 (1), 4-6, 6-0 at Roland Garros. World No. 1 will play Coco Gauff in Saturday's final. Italian pair Sara Errani and Andrea Vavassori win French Open mixed title.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121667295,imgsize-148482,width-400,resizemode-4/121667295.jpg"

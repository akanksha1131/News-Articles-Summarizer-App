NEW DELHI: India’s crushing 51-run loss to South Africa in Mullanpur on Thursday did not just level the five-match series 1-1 — it also underlined an uncomfortable statistical reality. This was India’s 13th T20I defeat to South Africa in 33 matches, the most losses they have suffered against any opposition in the format. Australia and England follow with 12 each, but the Proteas now stand alone atop a list India would rather avoid.South Africa’s domination added another layer of statistical significance. Their pacers produced a rare, ruthless performance to dismiss India entirely with pace, marking the first time South African fast bowlers have taken all ten wickets in a T20I innings. India’s collapse — all ten wickets falling to pace — is also their worst such outing in T20Is, surpassing previous lows against the West Indies (nine wickets lost to pace in 2022) and Pakistan (nine in 2024).The numbers around India’s failed chase were equally damning. Set 214 after Quinton de Kock’s blazing 90 (46 balls), India folded for 162 in 19.1 overs. The defeat reaffirmed a long-standing hurdle: India have never successfully chased a 210-plus target in T20Is.Their record now reads: seven attempts, seven defeats.The 51-run margin also enters India’s list of biggest defeats by runs in T20Is — second only to the 80-run hammering by New Zealand in Wellington (2019). It also joins heavy losses against Australia (49 runs, 2010), South Africa (49, 2022) and New Zealand (47, 2016).South Africa’s response to their 74-all-out embarrassment in Cuttack was emphatic. De Kock led the revival with seven sixes, while Donovan Ferreira’s 30 off 16 powered a 49-run burst in the final three overs. Ottneil Baartman, one of three changes, sealed the win with a superb 4 for 24.India’s chase never took flight. Shubman Gill fell in the first over, Abhishek Sharma sparkled briefly, and captain Suryakumar Yadav’s struggles continued. Tilak Varma’s 62 (34 balls) was the lone resistance, but even he could not prevent India from suffering their first T20I defeat in 14 matches with both Jasprit Bumrah and Arshdeep Singh in the XI.The series now moves to Dharamsala for the third T20I on Sunday, with India seeking answers — and redemption — before the T20 World Cup at home in February.","South Africa beat India by 51 runs to level the five-match series 1-1.

U-19 Asia Cup press conference: What Ayush Mhatre said before the tournament

NEW DELHI: India captain Suryakumar Yadav admitted that his side was “far from good enough” after a crushing 51-run defeat to South Africa in the second T20I in Mullanpur on Thursday, repeatedly stressing that “we learn, we try” in an attempt to explain one of India’s most erratic performances in recent months.Chasing a stiff 214 on a batting-friendly pitch, India folded for 162, undone by early wickets and a muddled batting plan. In the spotlight was the reliance on Abhishek Sharma , whose short burst of 17 off eight balls once again provided the only spark at the top. But the opener’s early dismissal exposed a familiar fragility.“I think myself, Shubman… we could have given a good start because we can’t rely on Abhishek all the time,” Suryakumar said, candidly accepting the blame. “The way he’s been batting, he might have an off-day. Me, Shubman and a few other batters should have taken it. I should have taken that responsibility, batted a little deeper.”Gill, dismissed off the first ball, and Suryakumar, out for 5, left India reeling in the powerplay. The captain brushed aside excuses, but his repeated emphasis on “learning” said enough. “As I said, we learn… we try to do better in the next game.”One decision that drew scrutiny was the promotion of Axar Patel to No. 3 as a pinch-hitter — an experiment that backfired as he crawled to 21 off 21 balls, draining crucial momentum. Suryakumar’s explanation didn’t inspire confidence. “We saw Axar bat well in the longer format. We wanted him to bat the same way. Unfortunately, it didn’t work… we will see what’s up for the next game.”India’s bowling was equally rattled. Jasprit Bumrah and Arshdeep Singh were smashed for nine sixes between them as both struggled to control a wet ball in heavy dew, repeatedly missing yorkers and offering full tosses.“We should have had a second plan if the yorker wasn’t working,” Suryakumar admitted. “It’s a learning process. Just learn and move forward.”The captain insisted India had “taken lessons” from how South Africa’s pacers executed their lengths, promising adjustments in the decider. But with two top-order failures in two games and an overdependence on Abhishek, India’s T20 blueprint suddenly looks shakier than expected — even as the captain continues to bank on learnings “for the next game.”","India captain Suryakumar Yadav admits his side was “far from good enough” after a crushing 51-run defeat to South Africa in the second T20I in Mullanpur on Thursday.

Smriti Mandhana opens up on 'love', World Cup win and more

NEW DELHI: India’s 51-run loss to South Africa in the second T20I in Mullanpur on Thursday has triggered a fresh wave of scrutiny, with questions directed at the form of Shubman Gill, Suryakumar Yadav and the team’s bowling discipline.Former India all-rounder Irfan Pathan summed up the growing concern on social media, writing on X: “Shubman Gill & Suryakumar’s form? Thirteen full tosses today while bowling. How to negate that? These are the questions Team India needs to answer going forward. Hopefully they answer them with positive impact.”Both Gill and Suryakumar endured another disappointing outing on what was a true batting pitch.South Africa, powered by a sensational 90 off 46 balls from Quinton de Kock, posted a commanding 213/4 after being put in to bat.India’s chase fizzled out early as the top order crumbled in the powerplay, with the hosts losing Abhishek Sharma (17), Gill (0) and Suryakumar (5) inside the first five overs.The local crowd had hoped to see their home stars flourish, but Gill’s struggles in T20Is deepened when he edged a superb away-seamer from Lungi Ngidi first ball.Abhishek fell in the next over, caught behind off Marco Jansen, and Suryakumar followed soon after, nicking another Jansen delivery angled across him.Axar Patel (21 off 21), promoted to No. 3, also departed cheaply as the pressure mounted.Only Tilak Varma stood tall, producing a fluent 62 off 34, but with wickets tumbling and the required rate surging, India were bowled out for 162 in 19.1 overs, allowing South Africa to level the five-match series 1-1 ahead of the Dharamsala clash on December 14.Earlier, De Kock’s brutal hitting, including seven sixes, many over deep square leg, dismantled India’s attack.Arshdeep Singh endured a nightmare 11th over, leaking 18 runs including seven wides, while Jasprit Bumrah was taken apart in the final over by Donovan Ferreira (30 not out off 16).India conceded 123 runs in the last 10 overs, a collapse in discipline that will concern Gautam Gambhir’s management as they search for answers before the next game.","South Africa beat India by 51 runs in second T20I in Mullanpur.

NEW DELHI: All eyes will be on young batters Vaibhav Sooryavanshi and Ayush Mhatre during India’s Asia Cup U-19 campaign, but a key point of attention will be whether the BCCI permits the players to shake hands with the Pakistan team, a gesture seen as basic sporting courtesy at the junior level.The India U-19 team, captained by Mumbai and CSK opener Mhatre, will start its campaign against the UAE on Friday. The match against Pakistan on Sunday is expected to draw the most attention in a tournament viewed as preparation for next year’s U-19 World Cup.In the senior men’s Asia Cup, the Women’s ODI World Cup and the Rising Stars Asia Cup T20, Indian players did not shake hands with Pakistan players as a gesture of support for the Indian Army and victims of the Pahalgam terror attack.For the U-19 players, it is understood that the ICC prefers that political issues not be linked with junior cricket and that regular protocols of sportsmanship be followed.""The boys haven't been told anything. But obviously BCCI has given explicit instructions to its manager Anand Datar. Now if Indian boys don't shake hands with Pakistan team then match referee will have to be informed in advance. We know for a fact that ICC doesn't want politics to take front seat when it comes to junior cricket.So it is a case of both bad optics and public sentiment,"" a BCCI official was quoted as saying by the news agency PTI.In the tournament, India and Pakistan are expected to make the semi-finals as the top two teams from Group A. Malaysia and the UAE are the other group members and have limited experience in 50-over cricket.Both Sooryavanshi and Mhatre enter the event after strong performances in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy. Mhatre contributed with consecutive centuries and a fifty in the group stage, while Sooryavanshi became the youngest player to score a SMAT century, against Maharashtra.In India’s 15-member squad, these two players have played more than 30 senior matches across formats and have a combined total of nine centuries. This is the highest number of senior-level centuries when compared to all the other seven teams together, making India strong contenders in the tournament.","India U-19 team, captained by Mumbai and CSK opener Ayush Mhatre, will start its campaign against the UAE on Friday.

MULLANPUR:

Rovman Powell Unfiltered: 'Playing in the IPL changed my life'

After bringing up his half-century in the first T20I in Cuttack on Monday evening, Hardik Pandya raised his bat high, looked at the dressing room with a straight face and simply got back to business. The unbeaten 28-ball 59 may have seemed like a par-for-the-course T20 knock from the talented allrounder, but Pandya’s innings offered a timely reminder of exactly what Team India have been missing in white-ball cricket in his absence.Pandya, an inherently flamboyant character, now exudes a sense of calm in a team packed with youngsters high on adrenaline. Coming out to bat on a damp pitch with India struggling at 78/4 in the 12th over against a shrewd South African bowling attack, he did not look flustered.India’s designated T20 hitters — Abhishek Sharma, Suryakumar Yadav and Tilak Varma — had all succumbed to the choke applied by South Africa’s bowlers. Pandya, re turning from a two-month layoff because of a quadricep injury, batted as if he had never gone away.The Indian team management and selectors took a harsh call when they dropped Pandya as a leadership contender after the victorious T20 World Cup campaign in 2024.This was largely due to the frequency of his injuries.Every time he does return after injury, though, Pandy reminds the world what the team has been missing. That the team management had to constantly shuffle its playing XI in ODIs in Pandya’s absence is a case in point. The two ODI series in Australia and against South Africa at home exposed India’s lack of power hitters in the back-end of the innings. Besides, Pandya is also the sixth bowler.“I’ve stood strong. I’ve done a lot of things with grace and that has helped me to become even more confident, back myself and really trust my skillset. I really believe in myself as a player,” Pandya told bcci.tv.Through his career, power and swagger have been part of Pandya’s cricketing identity, but now he has risen above mindless slogging and developed an ability to absorb pressure consistently without compromising the needs of the team. Since the Asia Cup, the middle order hasn’t really been as explosive as required in modern T20. The likes of Suryakumar and Tilak have not really been able to break free in conditions where the ball doesn’t come on to the bat at a consistent pace. Axar Patel ’s promotion up the order has been up for debate for over a year now.Former India wicketkeeper Deep Dasgupta explained the team’s thought process behind sending Pandya after Axar. “India have not been playing on flat pitches. They are likely to play more on pitches that will aid Varun Chakravarthy and Kuldeep Yadav in the T20 World Cup. It’s important for the younger batters to bat with more freedom knowing Pandya is there to steady the innings lower down. That’s the thing about Pandya now. He is the stabiliser in this batting lineup. Coming in after the 12th over is the sweet spot for him,” Dasgupta told TOI.Dasgupta established the point by highlighting how Pandya could bat with a high strike-rate and yet look risk free. “He was hitting straight and with ease. There were no risks taken. Once he came in to bat, he played the situation beautifully and also ensured the run-rate went up. It wasn’t an easy pitch to bat on but he took responsibility. That’s what India have been missing. Pandya is the link between the top-order and the lower middle-order,” he said.Pandya has endured a lot. Every time it looked like his career had found new wing, he would be bogged down by injury or off-field controversies. India will need this strong and calm Pandya to contribute more in white-ball cricket.",Hardik Pandya's unbeaten 59 in the first T20I in Cuttack was a timely reminder of exactly what Team India have been missing in white-ball cricket in his absence.

NEW DELHI: The Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ) is expected to take up a long-awaited revision of domestic match fees for women cricketers during the Apex Council meeting scheduled for December 22. The meeting, which will be held virtually, comes in the wake of India’s triumphant ODI World Cup campaign and growing calls for stronger financial support for women competing in domestic tournaments.While pay parity exists at the international level, significant gaps remain in the domestic structure. With the women’s game gaining momentum, the BCCI is now poised to address the issue formally, with the proposal listed as a key agenda item.Another major point of discussion will be the annual central contracts for the men’s team. Much attention will be on the grading of Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli , both of whom stepped away from Tests and T20Is over the past year and now play only ODI cricket. Their revised workload may prompt adjustments to their contract categories.In contrast, all-format players such as India captain Shubman Gill, vice-captain Ravindra Jadeja, and lead pacer Jasprit Bumrah are expected to feature in the A+ bracket, reflecting their central roles across formats.The BCCI will also evaluate a proposal to revise match fees for umpires and match referees, a long-pending demand within the domestic circuit. An update on the board’s digital properties, which includes streaming rights, website upgrades, and fan-engagement platforms, is also slated for discussion.This will be the first Apex Council AGM since the recent administrative changes within the BCCI.

Pakistan fast bowler Shaheen Afridi has revealed how Australian left-arm pacer Mitchell Starc has influenced his cricket career, particularly citing Starc's performance in the 2015 ICC Men's Cricket World Cup as a pivotal moment in shaping his bowling technique.Starc has recently surpassed Pakistan legend Wasim Akram 's record for the most Test wickets by a left-arm fast bowler. The 25-year-old Afridi expressed his admiration for Starc ahead of his first Big Bash League appearance in Australia.""He's a legend. When 'Starcy' played that 2015 World Cup, I was playing for the Under 16 Pakistan team at that time, so...I followed him to try to bowl many times the way he swung the ball. He bowled a fuller ball throughout that World Cup and had very good success,"" Afridi said.The young Pakistani bowler acknowledges that observing Starc's bowling style helped him understand the importance of attacking lengths for left-arm fast bowlers, a principle he continues to implement in his cricket.Starc, now 35, has maintained his exceptional form, claiming 18 wickets and securing consecutive Player of the Match awards in the first two Tests of the ongoing Ashes series, helping Australia gain a 2-0 lead over England.Afridi regularly seeks opportunities to engage in conversations with Starc during international encounters. Their most recent interaction was marked by Afridi's candid appreciation of Starc's influence.""The last time we chatted, I told him that I watched him (in 2015)… And that's why I bowl fuller to batters.

Poll What do you think is the biggest lesson sports can teach us? Teamwork Resilience Dedication

NEW DELHI: India vice-captain Smriti Mandhana made her first public appearance on Wednesday after calling off her wedding with musician Palash Mucchal, choosing the Amazon Smbhav Summit stage to speak not about the turbulence in her personal life but about the unwavering force that continues to define her — cricket. Calm, composed and extremely clear about what fuels her, Mandhana offered an emotional reflection on her journey, her motivation and the power of wearing the India jersey.Mandhana said that over 12 years of international cricket have taught her one life-defining truth: nothing comes close to the love she feels for the sport. That conviction came through in a dramatic passage that soon went viral. “The love for the game… I don’t think I love anything in life more than cricket,” she said. “When you go out to bat or represent your country, no other thoughts exist. When you put on the Indian jersey, the only thing you want to do is win the match for India. Once you put on the jersey, you just keep all your problems aside because you are one of 2 billion people representing the country. That thought alone gives you razor-sharp focus.”The remarks carried added weight because this was Mandhana’s first public appearance since she confirmed on Sunday that her wedding had been called off. In her Instagram statement, she had urged privacy for both families while reaffirming her commitment to representing India “for as long as possible.” At the event, she stayed away from any personal references, instead speaking deeply about the emotion and purpose attached to her cricketing journey.Mandhana described her childhood dream of becoming a world champion and the years of struggle that culminated in India’s World Cup triumph last month. She recalled how the team had visualised the final, how seeing the moment unfold gave them goosebumps, and how the presence of legends Mithali Raj and Jhulan Goswami added a layer of emotion that made the victory feel like a milestone for women’s cricket itself.She also spoke candidly about the internal dynamics of the team, saying disagreements are healthy because they come from a shared passion to win. Every player, she said, has an opinion on how India can win, and those discussions — not arguments — are what make the team stronger.Mandhana concluded by sharing the two biggest lessons cricket has taught her: every innings begins from zero, and the game is always bigger than the individual. She said playing for the person next to her — not for herself — is a value that shapes not only cricket but life beyond it. Her words, delivered in her first appearance since a deeply personal decision, reinforced a single message: her purpose remains unchanged, and her love for the Indian jersey remains her strongest anchor.","India vice-captain Smriti Mandhana speaks at Amazon Smbhav Summit.

Gautam Gambhir Press Conference: Team India head coach heaves fire after 2-1 ODI series win over SA

Poll Which batting strategy do you find more effective in ODIs? Fixed batting order Floating batting lineup Mixture of both

NEW DELHI: India's convincing ODI series win over South Africa has sparked a fresh debate on batting flexibility in white-ball cricket — and this time, two of the sharpest minds in the modern game are on the same side.Head coach Gautam Gambhir set the conversation rolling when he said batting positions in ODIs are “overrated”, except for the opening pair. “In a one-day format, you should know the template you want to play with,” Gambhir said after India sealed the series. “I've always believed that in white-ball cricket, batting orders are very overrated, except the opening combination.”His comment struck a chord with former South African superstar AB de Villiers , who delivered a powerful endorsement on his YouTube channel.“I do agree with him to a certain extent,” ABD began, before expanding on why the idea works. “I've always enjoyed a floating batting lineup in ODIs. But it's a fine line — you can't play around too much with players' roles. It's the top three, four to six, and then the tailenders.

It's incredible,” he said. “It tells you something is heading in the right direction. It's the depth of Indian cricket,” ABD added.That depth has created a selection dilemma of its own.

But Shubman played before him in the Sri Lanka series — he deserved that spot. Sanju was ready to bat anywhere from 3 to 6.”With Gambhir's philosophy now shaping India's approach — and ABD offering emphatic support — the message seems unmistakable: In modern white-ball cricket, rigid batting orders are out; adaptability and imagination are in.","India's convincing ODI series win over South Africa has sparked a fresh debate on batting flexibility in white-ball cricket.

U-19 Asia Cup press conference: What Ayush Mhatre said before the tournament

A good performance in the Syed Mustaq Ali Trophy (SMAT), in which he is the leading wicket-taker, has boosted Rajasthan pacer Ashok Sharma’s IPL auction chances. The 23-year old leads the bowling charts with 19 wickets from seven league games at an economy rate of 8.84, including two four-wicket hauls. Dale Steyn admirer, Ashok was a net bowler for Royals in 2021, 2023 and 2024. Kolkata signed him for Rs 55 lakh in 2022 and ahead of IPL-2025, Royals brought him into the fold for Rs 30 lakh. He is yet to make his IPL debut.“When I was with KKR in 2022, Pat Cummins told me to stay disciplined and keep backing the hard lengths because that’s my strength,” Ashok said.Three days ago, riding this rich vein of form, Ashok dashed off from Pune, where Rajasthan are playing the SMAT Super League games, to Mumbai to attend trials for Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB). With the IPL mini auction looming, the in form seamer looks certain to be a wanted man.During his stint with Rajasthan Royals later on, Shane Bond pushed him further. “Bond said I must mix in bouncers, yorkers and slower balls so the batsman is never settled,” he added.The variations are showing results too. “Most wickets have still come from hard lengths, but I’ve worked hard on the yorker especially, it’s fetched me a few key scalps,” said the Jaipur pacer who regularly clocks 140kph.Three days ago, riding this rich vein of form, Ashok dashed from Pune, where Rajasthan are playing SMAT Super League games, to Mumbai to attend trials for Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB).

His family wasn’t financially well off and Ashok, inspired by his elder brother, took to cricket. Their father, a farmer, was unable to fund coaching for both sons, so the elder brother sacrificed his dreams. At 17, Ashok joined an academy in Jaipur.Strong performances earned him a place in the U-23 Rest of India side, a trip to a high-performance camp at the Centre of Excellence and finally a Ranji Trophy debut this season.The maximum speed he has touched is 149kph against Punjab in an U-23 Rest of India game, according to his coach Jagsimran Singh. “The main reason behind Ashok’s success is his speed and accuracy.

NEW CHANDIGARH:

U-19 Asia Cup press conference: What Ayush Mhatre said before the tournament

The 46 balls Quinton de Kock spent at the crease on Thursday evening showed what the world missed in the 16 months he had been away from international cricket.The marauding 90-run knock that cracked open India’s otherwise potent bowling attack helped South Africa overcome nightmares of the 74 all-out effort in Cuttack just two days earlier and post 213/4 at the new PCA Stadium here. That one imperious knock was enough for South Africa to put the game beyond the Indian batting lineup, which tamely surrendered 51 runs short of the target.Local boy Abhishek Sharma may have become the most-feared T20I opener going around in the last one year. De Kock chose Abhishek’s hometown to declare that he can still match the standards set by the new generation of Indian batters, all of whom are bred on a pure diet of T20 cricket.De Kock also ensured it wouldn’t be a good day for India pacer Arshdeep Singh, who has been de Kock’s nemesis whenever the two have squared up against each other in the past. The batter’s on slaught on Thursday rattled the left-arm seamer to such an extent that Arshdeep delivered seven wides in an over to stay away from de Kock’s hitting arc.By the end of the Powerplay during India’s chase, Abhishek had fallen early, with Marco Jansen dismissing him caught behind for 17 off eight balls.Shubman Gill and Suryakumar Yadav ’s struggles continued as they were dismissed caught behind for a duck and five respectively. Only Tilak Varma, with 62 off 34 balls, looked up for the challenge on a night when the big South African fast bowlers resorted to a back of-a-length, hit-the-pitch-hard plan. India’s late-order power-hitting woes were exposed once again as Jitesh and Dube fell swinging wildly.De Kock’s hitting is a departure from contemporary muscular slogging in T20Is. He stood steady in his crease and cleared the boundary behind square on the on-side with consummate ease.Once he unleashed a couple of his trademark pick-up shots off both front and back foot against Jasprit Bumrah and Arshdeep early on, it was clear he had hit his straps. It is rare when one sees both Arshdeep and Bumrah conceding 54 and 45, besides going wicketless, in the same match.Marco Jansen and Ottneil Bartman’s spells of 2/25 and 4/24 respectively was a reminder for India’s pacers that there is scope for another plan besides just sticking to either bowling full and swinging deliveries or slower ones. The pitch was undeniably flat for the batters but these two bowlers are proven game changers. Earlier, David Miller and Donovan Ferreira hammered an unbeaten 23-ball 53-run partnership for the fifth wicket once de Kock was bizarrely run out trying to steal a run, with the ball still in wicketkeeper Jitesh Sharma’s hands.Only Varun Chakravarthy stayed true to his billing, returning figures of 1/29 in his four overs. It was an evening when India bowled 16 wide deliveries and Bumrah failed to execute every yorker he tried to bowl. The Indians repeatedly wiped the ball to suggest the dew had taken effect. However, the South African bowlers did not struggle at all.There was some questionable captaincy from Suryakumar Yadav too, as he brought back Arshdeep to bowl the 19th over even though Shivam Dube had covered for him, bowling two comparatively steady overs and conceding only 18 runs.",South Africa beat India by 51 runs in second T20I match.

NEW DELHI: India fell short in their chase of 214 and were bowled out for 162 in 19.1 overs at New Chandigarh’s Maharaja Yadavindra Singh International Cricket Stadium, which hosted its first men’s international match on Thursday. South Africa won the second T20I by 51 runs and levelled the five-match series 1-1.India lost wickets regularly and never built momentum in the chase. Tilak Varma scored 62 off 34 balls and was the lone warrior for the Men-in-Blue.

He hit seven sixes and five fours, with most of the sixes going towards deep square leg.De Kock, who recently reversed his ODI retirement and was uncertain about his T20 plans after last year’s World Cup, returned with strong intent. An innings like this just less than a week before the IPL mini auction will also create the buzz among the franchises, who might indulge in a bidding war for the multi-skilled cricketer.India chose to bowl first after winning the toss. Arshdeep Singh, who dismissed de Kock in the series opener, went for runs this time. De Kock began with a six over mid-wicket off Arshdeep before adding another with a pull shot. Jasprit Bumrah also conceded 16 runs in his second over after Reeza Hendricks hit him for a six. Hendricks was later dismissed by Varun Chakravarthy, but de Kock kept scoring and took South Africa to 53 for one in the powerplay.Arshdeep returned in the 11th over but struggled with his lines after de Kock hit him for a straight six. The over included seven wides and went for 18 runs. De Kock looked set for a second T20I hundred but was run out by wicketkeeper Jitesh Sharma while attempting a single.South Africa continued to score quickly after his dismissal.

Batter Shubman Gill ’s lean patch in T20Is continued on Thursday as the opener was dismissed for a golden duck in the second T20I against South Africa in Mullanpur, triggering a wave of criticism and trolling on social media.Gill lasted only one delivery before Lungi Ngidi found his outside edge with a perfectly pitched good-length ball that nipped away, leaving Reeza Hendricks to complete a sharp catch at slip.The dismissal, more reminiscent of a Test-match setup, renewed concerns over Gill’s form in the shortest format, with fans expressing frustration online.In the first T20I, Gill could only score four runs in two balls.Gill’s early exit came in the shadow of a formidable batting display from South Africa, who piled up 213 for 4 after being put in to bat.The innings was dominated by Quinton de Kock , who produced a scintillating 90 off 46 balls, showcasing his full range on a true batting surface. De Kock, who has recently re-emerged in international cricket after reversing his ODI retirement, unleashed seven sixes, several of them dispatched effortlessly over deep square leg.His timing and clean hitting kept India under pressure through the powerplay and beyond.India’s bowlers struggled collectively, conceding 123 runs in the final 10 overs. Arshdeep Singh , who had dismissed de Kock in the series opener, endured a particularly difficult outing.After being launched for a straight six early in his spell, he completely lost rhythm in the 11th over, spraying seven wides and giving away 18 runs in a 13-ball over.Jasprit Bumrah, usually India’s most dependable option in the death overs, also had an uncharacteristic off day, yielding 18 runs in the final over as Donovan Ferreira (30 not out off 16) went on the attack.De Kock’s innings ended in an unusual run-out while attempting a non-existent single, but the momentum he generated carried South Africa comfortably past the 200 mark.Late bursts from Ferreira and David Miller (20 not out off 12) ensured the visitors finished strongly, setting India a steep chase, one made even tougher by Gill’s early departure.","Gill lasted only one delivery before Lungi Ngidi found his outside edge.

Arshdeep Singh: The Poet Who Bowls Thunder | Stories from His Father & Coach

NEW DELHI: India's pace man Arshdeep Singh lost his radar somewhat on Thursday during the second T20I against South Africa in New Chandigarh.In the 11th over of the South African innings, the left-arm fast bowler bowled not one, two, or three but seven wides in a single over.With a set Quinton de Kock on the strike, Arshdeep Singh tried to bowl wide yorkers, but failed drastically in his attempt and bowled six wides on the off side, and one on the leg side.The first ball of the over de Kock smoked over the bowler for Six runs. Then Arshdepp bowled two wides in a row, trying both times to go full and wide outside off, but missed the tramline.Arshdeep then bowled the second legal delivery of the over and it was a dot ball.The left-arm pacer then bowled four consecutive wides, trying the same thing to bowl well outside off.

Indian pacer Arshdeep Singh had a forgettable outing in the second T20I against South Africa in Mullanpur on Thursday, delivering an unprecedented 13-ball over that drew visible frustration from head coach Gautam Gambhir and placed the left-arm seamer alongside an unwanted world record.Arshdeep’s 11th-over meltdown, featuring seven wides and a six, matched Afghanistan’s Naveen-ul-Haq for the most balls ever bowled in a single over in men’s T20I cricket.The chaotic over leaked 18 runs as Quinton de Kock , already in fluent touch, continued his assault.De Kock smashed the first ball for a towering six over the sightscreen before Arshdeep sprayed a sequence of wayward wides attempting full and wide yorkers.The over stretched to 13 deliveries, marked by growing restlessness in the crowd and visible concern in the Indian dugout.Cameras repeatedly cut to a stern-faced Gambhir and bowling coach Morne Morkel, both unimpressed with the loss of control.Arshdeep’s struggle also coincided with de Kock’s dominance in the innings.Earlier, India won the toss and opted to bowl first, sticking with the same XI that delivered a thumping 101-run win in the opening match.Skipper Suryakumar Yadav cited dew as a key factor, praising his bowlers for their clinical performance in the series opener.South Africa, seeking a strong response after their heavy defeat, made three changes, bringing in Reeza Hendricks, George Linde, and Ottneil Baartman.While the surface at the newly inaugurated Maharaja Yadavindra Singh International Cricket Stadium offered good batting conditions, Arshdeep’s wayward spell became the talking point of the innings.",Arshdeep Singh bowled the most balls ever bowled in a single over in men's T20I cricket.

Twelve Indian Super League clubs have approached the All India Football Federation with a request to modify what they call ""commercially restrictive"" clauses in its constitution. This request was made ahead of the Annual General Meeting (AGM) scheduled for December 20.The ISL teams, with East Bengal being the only exception, have suggested that the AIFF should transfer the long-term rights of the top-tier league to the clubs if the federation cannot implement necessary amendments or provide a viable commercial structure.""...the AIFF should either expressly support removal of commercially restrictive clauses in the Constitution, or itself undertake these amendments at the forthcoming AGM on 20 December 2025,"" the clubs wrote in a letter to the AIFF President Kalyan Chaubey.""Thereafter, the federation along with the support of the Government and the Clubs proceed to transparently identify an appropriate commercial partner.""If the AIFF is unwilling or unable to support the necessary amendments or provide a commercially viable framework for the league, then the only logical solution is for the Federation to transfer the long-term rights of the league to the Clubs.""This latest communication follows a previous letter where the clubs had proposed forming a consortium to operate the league as majority owners, alongside the federation and aligned investors, if a suitable commercial partner cannot be found.The AIFF's recent tender for ISL commercial rights failed to attract any bidders.""Clubs must have commercial flexibility, including the ability to attract sponsors, investors, and long-term partners. This is not possible until the commercially restrictive clauses in the AIFF Constitution are amended or removed. Without this change, no sustainable league structure can be built, regardless of good intentions,"" the letter stated.The AIFF responded to the clubs' letter, noting that their options are limited due to the matter being before the Supreme Court.""As the matter is currently sub judice before the Hon'ble Supreme Court, and with the report already submitted by Justice L. N. Rao to the Court, our options remain limited,"" AIFF deputy secretary general K Satyanarayan wrote in his reply.""At present, there are two possible approaches: 1. To await the final directions of the Hon'ble Supreme Court; or 2. To collectively explore an amicable alternative solution.""Mohun Bagan Super Giant director Vinay Chopra, writing on behalf of all clubs, expressed their readiness to operate and develop the league, writing:""The time for procedural exchanges, meetings without purpose, and administrative delay has expired... such a meeting must have clear, time-bound decisions, not reiterating constraints that have been known for months.""The stakes are existential... Indian football faces the genuine risk of losing its only professional league, investors, sponsors, and the confidence of fans.

Arsenal secured a dominant 3-0 victory against Club Brugge in the Champions League on Wednesday, with Noni Madueke and Gabriel Martinelli scoring spectacular goals, helping Arsenal maintain their perfect record of six wins in six matches and virtually assuring automatic qualification to the last 16.Madueke, the former Chelsea winger, opened the scoring with a powerful long-range strike in the first half and added his second with a close-range header after the break. Martinelli sealed the win with a curling right-footed shot from outside the box.The comprehensive victory puts Arsenal at the top of their Champions League group with 18 points, nearly guaranteeing a top-eight finish with two games remaining. This positioning ensures direct entry to the last 16, eliminating the need for a playoff round.""To play in the Champions League and to win away from home and especially when we have that many players out, it makes the task bigger but I talked to the boys,"" Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta told TNT Sports. ""It was about showing how much we wanted it, the resilience and how we prepared and I think there were some great examples, for example Christian Norgaard, which is a player that probably prepares the best out of all of them.Arsenal entered the match following their first defeat since August, a 2-1 loss to Aston Villa in the Premier League. The match also marked Ivan Leko's return as Brugge manager after Nicky Hayen's dismissal on Monday.Arteta made five changes to his lineup, including starts for Norgaard at center back and Viktor Gyokeres, who hadn't started since November 1.Arsenal nearly took the lead when Piero Hincapie deflected Myles Lewis-Skelly's shot onto the post midway through the first half. Minutes later, Madueke broke the deadlock with his spectacular strike from the right side of Arsenal's attack.While Brugge showed occasional threat through Carlos Forbs on the right wing, Arsenal maintained control. Brugge's Aleksandar Stankovic and Christos Tzolis tested goalkeeper David Raya before halftime.Madueke extended Arsenal's lead early in the second half, heading in Martin Zubimendi's cross. Martinelli, who has played a limited role this season, added the third goal in the 56th minute.The match concluded with Arsenal substitute Gabriel Jesus, returning after an 11-month absence, hitting the crossbar as the visitors continued to press for more goals.The Premier League leaders, who have never won the European championship, demonstrated their strength despite missing several key players through injury.

Poll Should Xabi Alonso be given more time to turn Real Madrid’s fortunes around? Yes, he deserves support No, it's time for a change Only if results improve quickly

Manchester City delivered a dramatic comeback to beat Real Madrid 2-1 at the Santiago Bernabeu on Wednesday, a result that has pushed Xabi Alonso closer to the brink amid growing uncertainty over his future. Despite taking an early lead, Madrid’s frailties resurfaced and Pep Guardiola’s side capitalised, leaving the Spanish giants facing both a Champions League struggle and a coaching dilemma.Madrid, missing injured superstar Kylian Mbappe, began brightly and struck first through Rodrygo Goes, who ended a draining 33-game goal drought. The Brazilian finished a flowing counter-attack initiated by Alvaro Carreras, drilling low past Gianluigi Donnarumma after being played through by Jude Bellingham. Rodrygo’s celebration — embracing Alonso on the touchline — was a pointed show of support during what he later called “a difficult moment” for the squad and its manager.But the momentum flipped abruptly. City equalised in the 35th minute after Thibaut Courtois spilled Josko Gvardiol’s header, allowing Nico O’Reilly to pounce and tap home. The error punctured Madrid’s early rhythm, and frustration inside the Bernabeu grew as whistles rang out during a disjointed second half.City then struck again just before halftime. Antonio Rudiger hauled Erling Haaland to the ground inside the box, and the Norwegian made no mistake from the spot, sending Courtois the wrong way to give City a 2-1 lead they would protect until the end.Madrid continued to press for an equaliser but produced few clear openings. Courtois redeemed himself with sharp stops to deny Haaland, Rayan Cherki, and later Jeremy Doku, but the hosts lacked creativity and conviction. Alonso introduced 19-year-old Endrick late on, and the youngster nearly rescued a point when his effort clipped the crossbar with minutes remaining.Spanish media had widely reported that defeat would all but seal Alonso’s dismissal, and the atmosphere reflected those stakes. Madrid have now won just two of their last eight matches across competitions, slipping dangerously in the Champions League league-phase standings.Guardiola admitted City were second-best early on but praised his side’s resilience: “Until the goal we scored, they were much better.”Defender Raul Asencio insisted the dressing room remains behind Alonso, but with President Florentino Perez monitoring closely, Madrid could be headed for yet another change in the dugout.","Manchester City beat Real Madrid 2-1 at the Santiago Bernabeu on Wednesday.

Trump ERUPTS On Stage As Peace Prize Surprise Drops After 'Saving Millions Of Lives' | FIFA

Human rights group FairSquare has filed a formal complaint to FIFA's ethics committee, alleging that world football president Gianni Infantino violated the organisation's neutrality rules by endorsing US President Donald Trump. The controversy stems from Infantino awarding Trump FIFA's first-ever Peace Prize during the December 6 draw for the 2026 World Cup, which will be hosted by the United States, Canada and Mexico.In its complaint, FairSquare argues that the award itself represents a serious ethical breach. The group says granting a peace prize to a “sitting political figure is in and of itself a clear breach” of Article 15 of FIFA's code of ethics, which prohibits officials from expressing political preferences.FairSquare also targeted the way FIFA is being run. Calling the current leadership system “absurd”, the NGO accused Infantino of undermining the organisation's integrity and acting against the interests of global football.“This complaint is about a lot more than Infantino's support for President Donald Trump's political agenda,” FairSquare programme director Nicholas McGeehan said. “This is about how FIFA's absurd governance structure has allowed Gianni Infantino to openly flout the organisation's rules and act in ways that are both dangerous and directly contrary to the interests of the world's most popular sport.”The NGO has also asked the committee to investigate how the FIFA Peace Prize was created and why Trump was selected. It highlighted Infantino's previous praise for Trump, including his public plea in October that the US President be considered for the Nobel Peace Prize, along with three other political statements favourable to him.","Human rights group FairSquare has filed a formal complaint to FIFA's ethics committee.

With questions around his future at Liverpool, Mohamed Salah sent a message on Tuesday without using words. After the reaction to his comments on Saturday, Salah shared a photo on Instagram and X, showing him alone in the gym at Liverpool’s training base.In the image, Salah is seated on a workout bench facing a mirror, holding his phone for a selfie, with no expression on his face. The Egypt forward was not included in Liverpool’s squad for the Champions League match against Inter Milan. Despite that, the post showed he had reported for training and was working out at the club’s facilities.The post followed stronger comments he made after being left out of the team for the third match in a row, as Liverpool drew 3-3 with Leeds on Saturday.""It seems like the club has thrown me under the bus. That is how I am feeling. I think it is very clear that someone wanted me to get all of the blame,"" he said during an unscheduled interaction with reporters outside the stadium.Salah was aware of the impact of those remarks, made at a time when Liverpool’s title defence has struggled and pressure has increased on head coach Arne Slot.He did not travel with the squad to Milan on Monday. Slot said he was unsure whether Salah would play for the club again.""I cannot answer that question at this point in time,"" Slot said. ""I am a firm believer that there is always a possibility to return for a player. I can leave it with that I think.""Former Liverpool player and Sky Sports analyst Jamie Carragher was more critical.""I thought it was a disgrace what he did after the game,"" Carragher said on Monday Night Football. ""Some people have painted it as an emotional outburst, I don’t think it was.""Carragher added that Salah had decided ""to go for the manager and maybe try and get him sacked.""Salah is among Liverpool’s most successful players. He has won two Premier League titles, the Champions League and several other trophies with the club.Last season, he was named player of the year for the third time after scoring 34 goals in all competitions and helping Liverpool win a record-equaling 20th league title.He ended speculation about his future in April by signing a two-year contract extension, which reports said made him the club’s highest-paid player. However, his form has declined during a difficult start to the season, with Liverpool winning only two of their last 10 league matches.Salah has scored four league goals in 13 appearances this season. He was first left out against West Ham last month, then named on the bench against Sunderland, and later remained an unused substitute against Leeds.Those decisions led to his remarks, including saying he felt like ""someone doesn’t want me in the club.""He also said he has ""any relationship"" with Slot.""It is not the first or last time a player who doesn’t play says something similar to what he did,"" Slot said Monday. ""But my reaction to that is clear and that’s why he is not here tonight.""Salah is set to leave for the Africa Cup of Nations next week.

Lionel Messi has secured the MLS MVP award, making history as the first player to claim this honour in consecutive years. As the captain of the MLS Cup champions, Inter Miami, Messi has established himself as the dominant force in Major League Soccer.At 38, the Argentine star continues to break records, adding another milestone to his illustrious career. His outstanding performance included 29 goals and 19 assists during the regular season, leading the league in scoring.Messi joins Preki as only the second player to win multiple MVP awards in MLS history. While Preki won in 1997 and 2003, all other recipients have earned the award only once.""He was fantastic the whole season, with the numbers and also with the commitment,"" Inter Miami coach and longtime Messi teammate Javier Mascherano said.Despite playing in only half of Inter Miami's regular-season games in 2024, Messi's impact was undeniable. While last year's vote was close, this year's decision was clear-cut.The voting results showed Messi receiving 70.4% of total votes. San Diego's Anders Dreyer finished second with 11.2%, followed by LAFC's Denis Bouanga at 7.3%, Cincinnati's Evander at 4.8%, and Nashville's Sam Surridge at 2.4%.Messi's career accolades include eight Ballon d'Or titles, eight Pichichi trophies, six La Liga best player awards, three Best FIFA Men's Player awards, three UEFA Men's Player of the Year wins, two FIFA World Cup Golden Balls, and 15 selections as Argentina's best player.He has won 47 trophies with club and country, including the 2022 World Cup.""The reality,"" Mascherano said as the regular season was ending, ""is that Leo clears all doubts.""Messi becomes the sixth player to win both MVP and a championship in the same MLS season. Only Josef Martinez of Atlanta United in 2018 had previously achieved the triple feat of MVP, title, and Golden Boot in one year, which Messi matched in 2025.In MLS history, only four players have been MVP finalists the year after winning the award: Carlos Valderrama (1996-1997), Marco Etcheverry (1998-1999), David Villa (2016-2017), and Josef Martinez (2018-2019).Messi has committed his future to Inter Miami with a three-year contract extension. He will be present when the team opens its new stadium near Miami International Airport next season.Back-to-back MVPs are common in other major US sports leagues. Recent examples include Shohei Ohtani and Aaron Judge in baseball, A'ja Wilson in the WNBA, Nikola Jokic in the NBA, Aaron Rodgers in the NFL, and Alex Ovechkin in the NHL.","Lionel Messi has secured the MLS MVP award, making history as the first player to claim this honour in consecutive years. As the captain of the MLS Cup champions, Inter Miami, Messi has established himself as the dominant force in Major League Soccer. He joins Preki as only the second player to win multiple MVP awards in MLS history.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125873457,imgsize-86838,width-400,resizemode-4/it39s-messi-repeat-messi-the-inter-miami-star-is-mls39-first-back-to-back-mvp-winner.jpg"
Russell Wilson vs Ciara Net Worth: How the Giants QB’s massive career income compares to the Grammy winner’s empire,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/russell-wilson-vs-ciara-net-worth-how-the-giants-qbs-massive-career-income-compares-to-the-grammy-winners-empire/articleshow/125923503.cms,"Russell Wilson's new Giants deal fuels debate on household earnings versus wife Ciara's diverse empire. While Wilson boasts over $283 million in NFL salary, Ciara, a Grammy winner, commands significant income from music, endorsements, and acting. Their contrasting yet powerful success stories highlight distinct forms of achievement in sports and entertainment.

Breaking down Russell Wilson’s massive NFL earnings versus Ciara’s music, endorsement, and entertainment empire

When Russell Wilson signed his new one-year, $10.5 million deal with the New York Giants, the sports world immediately reignited a familiar question: between Wilson and his superstar wife Ciara, who is really the higher earner in the household? Their careers couldn’t be more different, one built on NFL dominance and record-breaking earnings, the other powered by chart-topping hits, brand partnerships, acting roles, and global name recognition.Yet both have become cultural fixtures in their own lanes. As Wilson steps into a fresh chapter with the Giants and Ciara continues to balance motherhood, music, and business, their financial trajectories highlight two distinctly powerful forms of success.Wilson, now 36, remains one of the most accomplished quarterbacks of his generation. After a decade with the Seattle Seahawks, including a Super Bowl championship and a season with the Pittsburgh Steelers, he now heads to New York with incentives that could push his contract to $21 million.His career earnings tell the fuller story: Wilson has accumulated more than $283 million in NFL salary alone, a staggering figure unmatched by most in the league. Celebrity Net Worth places him at $165 million, and that number may still be conservative following his latest signing.Ciara, meanwhile, represents a different kind of longevity. At 39, the Grammy-winning singer has collaborated with some of the biggest names in music: Justin Timberlake, Missy Elliott, Ludacris, and Chris Brown and delivered enduring hits like “Like a Boy” and “Get Up.”Her Grammy win for “Lose Control” marked her as more than a performer; she became a household name.Add to that her high-profile partnerships with Adidas, Verizon, and Rocawear, plus her acting projects such as The Color Purple remake, and she has built a multifaceted brand that extends beyond music. Her estimated net worth stands at $20 million.While Wilson undeniably brings in the larger financial numbers, Ciara’s career shines through its versatility, cultural influence, and staying power across industries. Together, they form one of entertainment and sports’ most dynamic power couples, each successful in their own lane, yet equally impactful far beyond the numbers.Also Read: “Definitely happening”: Ciara sparks talk of baby No. 5 as she hints at growing her family with Russell Wilson","Russell Wilson signed a new one-year, $10.5 million deal with the New York Giants.

"""Slap in my face"": Cam Newton vents frustration as Colts turn to 44-year-old Philip Rivers",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/slap-in-my-face-cam-newton-vents-frustration-as-colts-turn-to-44-year-old-philip-rivers/articleshow/125923587.cms,"Cam Newton fumes after Colts bring back Philip Rivers instead of giving him a shot (Getty Images)

Cam Newton calls Colts decision a ‘slap to my face’



The NFL spent the week buzzing after the Indianapolis Colts decided to call 44-year-old Philip Rivers, a man who has not taken a snap since 2020. The move surprised fans, analysts and even former players. But no reaction stood out more than Cam Newton’s, who admitted the decision left him puzzled and a little offended. Newton said he had been open to opportunities, had stayed in shape and had never closed the door on football. Yet his phone did not ring.Newton shared his frustration on his podcast, speaking with the kind of candor he usually saves for his closest circle. He said the signing made him rethink how teams decide who gets a second chance and who gets left waiting. It pulled back the curtain on the complicated judgments teams make, and it revealed how deeply players feel these decisions, even long after their peak years.Newton made his feelings known on his latest episode of the “4th&1” podcast. He said the Rivers workout did not bother him because Rivers is a rival or a peer. It bothered him because of what it suggested about how teams viewed him. “For 44 years old, coming out of retirement…It’s almost like a slap in my face,” he said.Newton made it clear he would have accepted a workout immediately if the Colts had reached out.His co-host asked whether Newton’s growing media presence might confuse teams about his interest in returning. Newton rejected the idea. “Did Philip Rivers send any type of signs that he was available?” he said. “Why you asking me to do something that everybody else didn't do. I ain't no sucka, I ain't no lab rat.” He added that people often expect him to meet standards they never apply to anyone else. “People be holding people to a standard that they ain't even hold anybody else to that standard. ”To show he has stayed ready, Newton pointed fans toward his Snapchat, where he frequently posts his workouts. He contrasted that with Rivers, who had fully stepped away. Newton lightened the mood by joking about their shared reputation for having large families. “That’s from my brother from another that got's a lot of sisters and brothers that came from his scrotum,” Newton said. “He's got a lot of kids like me!”The Colts will learn soon whether their gamble pays off. Rivers is expected to suit up when Indianapolis travels to Seattle on Sunday. Newton, meanwhile, left the door wide open. “Call my boy, man. Reach out to us. We taking workouts… we taking chances,” he said. He closed with a final message that carried more weight than anger. “I want to be who really want me. If you don’t want me, don’t send for me.”Also Read: As Patrick struggles on field, Brittany Mahomes turns heads in stunning all-white look with surprise twist","Cam Newton calls Colts decision to bring back Philip Rivers a ‘slap to my face’ Newton said he had been open to opportunities, had stayed in shape and had never closed the door on football.

Nicki Minaj vs Cardi B feud deepens as Vance enters the spotlight



The political world woke up to an unexpected twist when Vice President JD Vance stepped into a music rivalry that has dominated rap culture for years. His late night post on X instantly stirred reactions across politics, entertainment and social media. The moment felt surreal to many users, who watched a sitting vice president join a feud known for its sharp lyrics, bold personalities and a history of public clashes. It marked a rare moment where Washington’s attention drifted into hip hop’s most persistent rivalry.People rushed to screenshot Vance’s post before the conversation grew louder across the platform. The vice president wrote, “Nicki > Cardi,” in response to a now deleted message from Nicki Minaj. The comment spread quickly, not just because of the bluntness, but because it placed a top elected official directly into an argument that fans have fueled for nearly a decade.Minaj’s deleted post appeared to read “Vance > Rants,” based on screenshots that circulated before she removed it. No one knows what sparked it, but it matched the playful tone of the posts still live on her account. She followed up with more lines aimed at Vance, including “Vance > Ants in the pants,” paired with a smiling photo of 50 Cent.A short time later she added, “The Vance > The Gav Nots,” and then praised the growing meme storm. Her longest message read, “Nothing brings me joy like the Vance memes & knowing he leaned into it like a boss … But make no mistake, Vance is an assassin. Don’t debate him. On anything. Quick as a computer. Maybe quicker.”Her activity on X this week did not stop at the jokes. Minaj also resurfaced older discussions about Donald Trump. She reposted a tweet about Melania Trump’s kidney procedure in 2018 that claimed he sent her a “beautiful” letter and cleared his schedule. Those details have not been supported by reporting, yet her reposts drew wide attention. She also shared a video of Trump performing the well known “Trump dance” and captioned it, “Mood. ”While Vance’s comment sparked headlines, the underlying feud between Minaj and Cardi has run since 2017. Their split began after their work on “MotorSport” and reached a peak during a New York Fashion Week fight in 2018. Even after moments of calm, the tension returned through subtle jabs and eventually a heated exchange online earlier this year.Their differences extend beyond music. Stefon Diggs' girlfriend Cardi B has long criticized the Trump administration. Minaj has taken the opposite direction, voicing support for causes that align with the MAGA movement. Last month she spoke at a United Nations event and said, “I would like to thank President Trump for prioritizing this issue. And his leadership on the global stage in calling for urgent action to defend Christians in Nigeria and to combat extremism and to bring a stop to violence against those who simply want to express their natural right to freedom of religion or belief. ”Vance’s short post linked politics, culture and celebrity drama in a way few expected. What began as a simple message may now grow into a much larger conversation as fans and lawmakers react to a feud that refuses to fade.Also Read: Patriots QB Drake Maye settles fan confusion, revealing the real name everyone should use for wife Ann Michael","Vice President JD Vance tweeted, “Nicki > Cardi,” in response to a now deleted message from Nicki Minaj.

Why did Denver Broncos decide to waive oldest tight end Marcedes Lewis just after 4 appearances,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/why-did-denver-broncos-decide-to-waive-oldest-tight-end-marcedes-lewis-just-after-4-appearances/articleshow/125923513.cms,"(Image Source - Getty Images)

Why Denver Broncos considered the waiving of Marcedes Lewis

The Denver Broncos waived veteran tight end Marcedes Lewis on Thursday, December 11, 2025, less than a week after his most recent game appearance. At the age of 41, Lewis had just become the oldest tight end in NFL history a month prior, celebrating a significant achievement in his 20th year in the league.This move is seen as procedural and creates a roster spot as the Broncos get ready for their Week 15 clash with the Green Bay Packers on Sunday, with several players returning from injuries. Lewis may not have recorded any stats, but his time on the field as a blocker showed just how much the team needs depth at tight end during this challenging time.The Broncos decided to waive Lewis due to a mix of roster management and players coming back from injuries. This is seen as a ""procedural move"" to enhance their depth as they head into the playoffs. A major reason for this is the expected return of backup tight end Nate Adkins from injured reserve, where he’s been out since late October because of a knee injury.Adkins, who was out for the last six weeks and five games, got back to limited practice this week, taking part on Wednesday and Thursday. He was a key blocker before his injury, similar to Lewis, but now that Adkins is back, he fills the same role Lewis did, which makes the veteran less necessary on the active roster.On top of that, Lewis has used up all three of his practice squad elevations for the season, which is a league rule that restricts how many times players can be brought up without getting a permanent promotion.By waiving him, the Broncos are looking to bring Lewis back to the practice squad if he goes unclaimed on waivers, keeping his value as a leader and backup option while not taking up a spot on the active roster.The timing matches up with the overall roster changes. This week, the Broncos put guard Ben Powers (biceps) on the list and defensive tackle D.J. Jones came back from injured reserve, both participating in practice but in a limited way.Powers' 21-day activation period kicked off on Wednesday, December 10, putting extra pressure on managing the 53-man roster effectively.With the team sitting at 11-2 and on a 10-game winning streak while holding the AFC's top seed, head coach Sean Payton stressed the importance of flexibility in the game plan for handling these returns.Also Read: “I’ve been through more than most”: Cincinnati Bengals Quarterback Joe Burrow opens up about mental and physical toll of injuries","The Denver Broncos waived veteran tight end Marcedes Lewis on Thursday, December 11, 2025, less than a week after his most recent game appearance.

His wife, Dani Watt, a former athlete, provides support. Dani had a successful soccer career, playing professionally in the US and Iceland. She retired in 2023. She married TJ in 2022 and they have a daughter, Blakely. Dani's strength is a key focus as TJ recovers.

Dani Watt’s journey from standout collegiate athlete to devoted partner and new mother

TJ Watt’s unexpected lung injury has left Pittsburgh Steelers fans shaken, but the spotlight has also shifted to the woman who has stood beside him long before NFL fame, his wife, Dani Watt. As the star linebacker remains under medical evaluation following sudden breathing discomfort during practice, many have begun asking the same question: who is Dani Watt, the former athlete-turned-new mom whose quiet strength has become central to the Watt family’s resilience?Beyond her identity as TJ’s partner, Dani has built an impressive career of her own, marked by elite athleticism, global experience, and an inspiring decision to step away from professional sports to embrace a new chapter.Long before she became known as TJ Watt’s wife, Dani carved out her own legacy as one of Wisconsin’s top young athletes. A multi-sport standout, she excelled in both soccer and basketball before committing to the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where her talent quickly became undeniable. Her collegiate résumé includes being named the Big Ten Forward of the Year in 2019, an honor that confirmed she was among the conference’s most dangerous offensive players.After graduation, Dani’s professional path took her from the Chicago Red Stars to a soccer club in Iceland, an experience she later described as life-changing. When she announced her retirement from the sport in 2023, her heartfelt message reflected deep gratitude: “This was not an easy decision for me, but my body and my mind are ready and excited for another chapter.”That next chapter included marrying TJ in a destination ceremony in Mexico in 2022 and, in 2025, becoming a mother to their daughter, Blakely Marie Watt. Dani’s social posts reveal not only her pride in her family but also her joy in building a life that balances love, ambition, and grounded simplicity.Her tribute to TJ during their wedding encapsulated this sentiment: “When I was a little girl I never thought I'd find someone special enough to ever change my last name... But I found him and couldn't be happier to share a name with the man of my dreams.”As TJ recovers from his lung issue, one Coach Mike Tomlin described carefully, stating the linebacker was “comfortable”, Dani’s presence once again becomes a pillar for the family. And for fans searching to understand the woman behind one of the NFL’s toughest players, her story is one of talent, devotion, and unwavering grace through every season of life.Also Read: T.J.

Was Paige Shiver forced into an abortion?

The university's swift action and police involvement fuel speculation about the true severity of the allegations, leaving the public questioning what remains unsaid.

Online speculation intensifies as viral accusations raise concerns of coercion, secrecy, and misconduct



Michigan football has been rocked by a scandal that grows more chaotic by the hour, and the fallout surrounding former head coach Sherrone Moore shows no signs of slowing. Moore’s abrupt firing for an “inappropriate relationship with a staff member” ignited predictable curiosity, but the speculation escalated into a firestorm after a viral X post accused him of far more serious behavior.Assistant Paige Shiver, whose salary spike and sudden social-media disappearance have made her a focal point online, is now at the center of unverified pregnancy rumors. As the public digs for answers, a darker question looms: was a staffer pressured into an abortion behind the scenes, and is that part of what the university isn’t saying?While the university has not identified the staff member involved, internet investigators immediately fixated on Shiver, largely because of timing, proximity, and circumstance rather than confirmed evidence. Her 55% salary increase and rapid retreat from public view have only added to the narrative vacuum.But the conversation shifted dramatically when a commentary account claimed in a now deleted tweet, “Sherrone Moore cheated on his wife of 3 kids, got his staffer pregnant, forced an abortion, stalked her, doubled her salary, held a knife to her, broke into her house, threatened suicide to his wife, but he was out here tweeting shit like this in 2012.The signs were there. We need to pay attention to what people tweet and post. Even what they wear on their shirts, they’re not joking.”The allegations remain unverified, yet the specific mention of a forced abortion has led many to ask whether this is the piece of the puzzle that explains why the university acted so swiftly and why authorities detained Moore within hours of his dismissal.Coercion, especially within a workplace power imbalance, is a grave accusation, one that could move the situation from misconduct to criminal territory. Even without confirmation, the possibility alone is enough to fuel outrage among fans, advocates, and observers who believe the university may be withholding details to protect the integrity of a developing investigation.Shiver has not commented, and Moore remains silent as well. With police still determining whether charges will follow, the unanswered questions are becoming the story. Until the investigation provides clarity, the public is left weighing rumors against possibility and wondering whether this scandal is far more serious than an affair gone wrong.Also Read: What disease does Paige Shiver have?

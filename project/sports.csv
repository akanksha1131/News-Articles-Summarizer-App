Shane Watson hits out at IPL rule, explains Shubman Gill captaincy situation and more

NEW DELHI: India face a selection dilemma ahead of their first Test against World Test Championship winners South Africa on November 14, with vice-captain Rishabh Pant and Dhruv Jurel both vying for the wicketkeeper-batter slot. Former cricketer Aakash Chopra has suggested that both should find a place in the playing XI.Jurel has strengthened his case with consistent performances, including a century against the West Indies and another ton for India A against South Africa A.""Both Dhruv Jurel and Rishabh Pant are there in the squad. Rishabh Pant will play. He is the vice-captain. He is going to play, and he should play. But I feel Dhruv Jurel should also play,"" Chopra said on his YouTube channel.""A place should be created for him in the XI. The question will be whether you will compromise Sai Sudharsan from the top or Nitish Kumar Reddy from lower in the order,"" Chopra added.Recommending a possible combination, Chopra advised the team management — led by Shubman Gill and Gautam Gambhir — to retain Sai Sudharsan at No. 3 and drop all-rounder Nitish Kumar Reddy.""I think Sai Sudharsan should be allowed to play at No. 3. You haven't got Nitish Kumar Reddy to do his job properly thus far.So you can actually sacrifice him and keep Dhruv Jurel there,"" stated Chopra.Jurel’s recent form bolsters his case further — he scored 125 against the West Indies in the first Test in October and followed it up with an unbeaten 132 for India A against South Africa A.His potential inclusion as a specialist batter gains weight from Nitish Reddy’s limited bowling contribution in home conditions.",India face a selection dilemma ahead of their first Test against South Africa.

Inside details of how PCB chief Mohsin Naqvi ran away with the Asia Cup trophy!

All eyes were on the ICC Board meet in Dubai on Friday as the Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ) secretary Devajit Saikia was expected to raise the Asia Cup trophy matter. The issue, however, was neither raised at the Chief Executives Committee (CEC) meet earlier this week nor at the Board meet. It wasn't part of any official agenda and never came up for a formal discussion during the last few days in Dubai.It is learnt that there were some informal discussions on the sidelines of the Board meet where Saikia pointed out that India, the winners of 2025 Asia Cup, are yet to get the trophy. While Saikia was representing the Indian cricket board, Mohsin Naqvi represented the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB).There was a lot of suspense around Naqvi's attendance for the meet but, as TimesofIndia.com had reported earlier , the PCB chief reached Dubai just an hour before the formal Board meet was to get underway. It is further understood that the Board members had lengthy informal discussions before the official session but Naqvi skipped that as he left for Dubai only on Friday morning. He was scheduled to stay in Dubai overnight and the feeling in the room was that the trophy impasse could end soon.""There were no heated arguments or anything. The matter was brought up during an informal discussion and both PCB and BCCI would work towards resolving it at the earliest.Whether it needs intervention from ICC - by forming a committee or something - is not decided at this stage, but it was all very healthy and cordial,"" says an administrator who attended the meetings in Dubai this week.""Yes there were serious doubts whether Mr Mohsin Naqvi would come for the Board meet but once he came, routine followed and the trophy matter was only discussed on the sidelines,"" he added.TimesofIndia.com reached out to BCCI secretary Devajit Saikia for a comment and the story will be updated the moment he responds.",Mohsin Naqvi reached Dubai just an hour before the formal Board meet was to get underway.

NEW DELHI: India secured victory in the 4th T20I against Australia in a low-scoring match in Queensland, where several players, including Abhishek Sharma and captain Suryakumar Yadav , faced batting challenges on a difficult pitch.

Manjurul denies allegations as 'baseless'

The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) announced on Thursday that it will establish a committee to investigate allegations made by fast bowler Jahanara Alam regarding inappropriate behaviour by a former selector during the 2022 ODI World Cup. The board has given the committee 15 working days to submit its findings and recommendations, demonstrating its commitment to addressing the serious nature of these allegations.Jahanara Alam, who currently resides in Australia, revealed in an interview with journalist Riasad Azim that a former selector, who served as both selector and manager of the women's team, behaved inappropriately towards her. She specifically mentioned that the individual asked her lewd questions during their interactions.""I faced several times (indecent proposal), not once. Definitely, when we are involved with the team, we cannot speak out about many things, even if we want to. When it comes to your bread and butter, when you are known by a few people, you cannot say or protest many things even if you want to,"" Jahanara told Azim's YouTube channel.The fast bowler, who has represented Bangladesh in 135 matches, also alleged that multiple BCB officials acted inappropriately with her.She stated that she had reported these incidents to former BCB director Shafiul Islam Nadel and the board's chief executive Nizamuddin Chowdhury.""In 2021, Towhid Bhai approached me through Babu Bhai (Coordinator Sarfaraz Babu). I've said this many times before. I don't know why they misbehaved with me. I tried hard to stay quiet and focus on cricket. But when I tactfully avoided the proposal, Manju Bhai began humiliating and insulting me from the very next day,"" Jahanara said in the video.""Towhid Bhai never spoke to me directly - he sent Babu Bhai instead. After about a year and a half, I submitted an 'Observation Letter' to the CEO, not a complaint, explaining everything. Babu Bhai had told me to 'look after Towhid Sir,' but I replied, 'He's the in-charge, what is there for me to look after?' I deliberately pretended not to understand the proposal. I'm sharing this so that other girls can also protect themselves this way. That's when Manju Bhai's bad behaviour started.""""The second proposal came from Manju Bhai during the 2022 World Cup. I decided to inform the BCB about everything that had happened over the past year and a half. I told Nadel Sir several times - he'd offer a temporary fix, but soon things went back to the same. I even informed the CEO.""Jahanara revealed that Manjurul had the tendency of getting too close to female players. Many of them started avoiding him because of this habit.""During our pre-camp, while I was bowling, he came up and placed his hand on my shoulder. He had a habit of pulling girls close, pressing them to his chest, and talking near their ears. We used to avoid him - even during handshakes after matches, we would extend our hands from a distance so he couldn't pull us in. Among ourselves, we'd joke nervously, 'He's coming, he'll hug us again.'""Narrating an incident, Jahanara said that the former selector came too close and asked about her period cycle.""Once he came near me, held my hand, put his arm on my shoulder, leaned close to my ear, and asked, 'How many days has your period been?' He already knew, since physios track players' cycles for health reasons as per ICC guidelines. I don't know why a manager or selector needed that information. When I said, 'Five days,' he replied, 'Five days? It should've ended yesterday. When your period is over, tell me - I have to look after my side too. ' I just looked at him and said, 'Sorry, Bhaiya, I didn't understand.'""Manjurul has categorically denied these allegations, calling them 'baseless'. ""What can I say apart from terming it as baseless. You can ask other cricketers whether I was good or bad"" Manjurul told Cricbuzz.""It's unfortunate she is dragging a dead man. I just want her to come up with proof instead of making baseless accusations,"" said Babu.""The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) has noted with concern the allegations reported in the media made by a former member of the Bangladesh national women's cricket team regarding alleged misconduct by certain individuals associated with the team,"" the BCB stated in their official release.""As the matter is of a sensitive nature, the BCB has decided to form a committee to investigate the allegations thoroughly. The committee will submit its findings and recommendations within 15 working days. The BCB is committed to ensuring a safe, respectful, and professional environment for all its players and personnel. The board takes such matters with utmost seriousness and will take appropriate action based on the findings of the investigation. ""These recent allegations follow Jahanara's previous claims where she accused Bangladesh captain Nigar Sultana of physically abusing her teammates. The BCB had dismissed these earlier allegations as ""baseless.""Jahanara Alam has established herself as a significant player in Bangladesh women's cricket, taking 48 wickets in ODIs and 60 wickets in T20Is throughout her career. Her achievements extend beyond national cricket, as she holds the distinction of being the only Bangladesh player to have participated in both the Women's T20 Challenge in India and the FairBreak Invitational T20.","Jahanara Alam has alleged abuse by ex-Bangladesh selector during the 2022 World Cup. The fast bowler, who has represented Bangladesh in 135 matches, also alleged that multiple BCB officials acted inappropriately with her. Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) has noted with concern the allegations reported by a former member of the women's cricket team.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125151931,imgsize-33902,width-400,resizemode-4/jahanara-alam-getty-images.jpg"

Former Australia captain Steve Waugh calls Virat Kohli the ODI GOAT

Poll Do you think Virat Kohli's calmness has positively impacted his performance? Yes, absolutely No, his aggressiveness is what sets him apart

NEW DELHI: Former India cricketer Mohammad Kaif believes Virat Kohli has become a calmer and more composed cricketer in recent years, crediting his maturity and understanding of the game for the change.Speaking on his YouTube channel, Kaif said he had noticed a clear difference in Kohli ’s approach compared to his early playing days. “Virat Kohli has become a bit calm now. There is a lot of difference between how he was before marriage and how he is after marriage,” Kaif said.Recalling a chat with Kohli during an IPL match, Kaif added that the star batter’s decision-making has evolved. “When I see him playing now… he hit (Kagiso) Rabada for a boundary coming down the ground, maybe he had scored a half-century and won the game. But he was very calm. He told me that if I had not attacked Rabada early on, he would not have let me play. So I wanted to hit him off the first ball,” Kaif said, adding that Kohli’s “understanding of cricket has improved with calmness. ”Kaif, who shared the dressing room with Kohli at Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB), said the 37-year-old’s attitude towards people remains unchanged despite his superstar status.“He still wants to improve his game after having played for so many years.And he still meets me the same way even now. If he called you a brother before, he will call you a brother now as well. When you meet him off the field, he will remember that he has played with you and will give you that respect. There is no change there,” Kaif said.Kohli recently featured in the ODI series against Australia, bouncing back with an unbeaten 74 in the final game after consecutive ducks in the first two matches.Addressing speculation about Kohli’s contract situation with RCB, Kaif said the batter was taking a cautious approach amid ownership changes. “There are rumours that the next season might not have the RCB name. Virat Kohli did not sign the commercial contract as he was waiting to see what direction the new owners would take,” he said.",Mohammad Kaif believes Virat Kohli has become a calmer cricketer in recent years.

Breaking: T20 cricket to be part of 2028 Los Angeles Olympics as IOC approves proposal

With cricket set to make a return to the Olympics after over a century, the International Cricket Council (ICC) has finalised how the six participating teams will be picked for the 2028 Los Angeles Games. During its recent Board meeting in Dubai on Friday, the global cricket body confirmed that six teams each from both men's and women's categories will feature in cricket's first appearance at the Games since the 1900 Paris Olympics.The ICC has been in a huddle discussing the possible arrangements, and the initial idea of just the top six teams as per the ICC T20I rankings has been put to rest. It will now be an arrangement where the top team from each region/continent will make the cut, and the sixth team will come through a global qualifier.""There have been discussions around the participation of teams, and it has been decided that the six teams will come through the top-ranked team from each region/continent, while the sixth comes from the global qualifier. The details will be shared by the ICC in due course, but the roadmap has more or less been frozen,"" says a veteran administrator who was part of the meeting in Dubai.The arrangement means every top side from each continent/region will make the first five teams. That essentially means that, based on current rankings, India qualify from Asia, Australia from Oceania, England from Europe, South Africa from Africa, and it will be interesting to see whether the USA — considering they are hosts — qualify from the Americas or West Indies would take the spot. The details of the global qualifier are likely to be shared by the global cricket body soon.Additionally, there is a small possibility of seeing an India vs Pakistan contest at LA28, as the details of the global qualifier are still unknown. In the detailed statement after the meeting, the ICC mentioned the success of women's cricket and shared an update on the LA28 Games.""The Board reviewed the ICC’s ongoing engagement with the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the Los Angeles 2028 Olympic Games (LA28), as cricket deepens its footprint in the global multisport landscape. At LA28, both the men’s and women’s T20 events will feature six teams each, comprising 28 matches in total,"" read the media release.",Cricket set to return to the Olympics after over a century.

NEW DELHI: On this day in 2020, Mumbai Indians reaffirmed their dominance as the most successful franchise in IPL history by clinching their fifth title with a five-wicket win over Delhi Capitals in the final at Dubai. Played behind closed doors during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, the match served as a fitting conclusion to a unique season contested entirely inside bio-secure bubbles in the UAE.Under the leadership of Rohit Sharma , Mumbai were the standout team of the tournament and once again demonstrated their all-round superiority in the summit clash, outclassing a determined Delhi Capitals outfit appearing in their maiden IPL final.Opting to bat first, Delhi’s innings got off to a disastrous start as Trent Boult struck with the very first ball, dismissing Marcus Stoinis for a golden duck. Boult’s fiery opening spell, aided by Nathan Coulter-Nile and Jayant Yadav, left Delhi reeling at 22 for 3 within the first four overs. Shikhar Dhawan (15) and Ajinkya Rahane (2) fell cheaply, forcing captain Shreyas Iyer and wicketkeeper Rishabh Pant to steady the innings.The duo staged a valuable recovery, with Iyer anchoring the innings for an unbeaten 65 off 50 balls, while Pant played freely for a quickfire 56 from 38 deliveries. Their partnership lifted Delhi to a fighting total of 156 for 7 from 20 overs — one that looked below par against Mumbai’s strong batting lineup.For Mumbai, Boult was the star with the ball, taking 3 for 30 in his four overs. Coulter-Nile provided excellent support with figures of 2 for 29, while Jasprit Bumrah, though wicketless, kept the pressure tight throughout.Chasing 157, Mumbai began with intent and authority. Skipper Rohit Sharma led from the front with a captain’s knock of 68 off 51 balls, hitting five fours and four sixes. He was well supported by Quinton de Kock (20 off 12) in an aggressive 45-run opening stand that set the tone early.Suryakumar Yadav (19) and Ishan Kishan (33* off 19) maintained control of the chase, ensuring there were no late hiccups. Mumbai crossed the target with eight balls to spare, finishing on 157 for 5 and sealing their fifth IPL crown — all under Rohit’s captaincy following triumphs in 2013, 2015, 2017, and 2019.","Mumbai Indians clinched their fifth title with a five-wicket win over Delhi Capitals in the final at Dubai.

Hardik Pandya's iconic celebration pose

Pakistan secured their sixth Hong Kong Sixes title with a remarkable performance this weekend. They narrowly defeated Australia in the semifinals and claimed a convincing 43-run victory over Kuwait in the final.The Pakistani team displayed dominance throughout the tournament at the Mission Road Ground in Mong Kok, with their only setback being a loss to India during the group stages.Muhammad Shahzad's celebration after the victory caught significant attention. The young cricketer recreated Hardik Pandya 's iconic celebration pose from India's T20 World Cup victory in Barbados last year.Shahzad, a fast-bowling all-rounder, mimicked Pandya's famous stance by posing with the trophy on the ground while shrugging his shoulders. The image was shared on his social media platforms.Shahzad emerged as Pakistan's leading wicket-taker in the tournament, claiming 7 wickets on their path to victory. The intent behind his celebration remains unclear, whether it was a tribute to one of Asia's premier seam all-rounders or a response to recent exchanges between the two nations.The celebration pose originally gained prominence when Pandya first performed it after dismissing Shadab Khan during India's victory over Pakistan in last year's T20 World Cup. The gesture became iconic after India's ICC trophy triumph and was repeated during their ICC Champions Trophy victory in the UAE this year.While Shahzad has represented Pakistan at the U-19 level, he is yet to make his senior team debut. He recently made headlines in the President's Cup final representing Pakistan TV, where he achieved a remarkable feat of taking a five-wicket haul including a hat-trick, followed by an unbeaten century in the subsequent innings.The tournament's semifinal proved challenging for Pakistan as they faced Australia. The Australian team needed six runs off the final ball but could only manage a boundary, resulting in Pakistan's victory by one run.The final against Kuwait saw Pakistan in commanding form. Abbas Afridi's explosive innings of 52 runs off just 11 balls helped Pakistan post 132 runs. Their bowling attack then restricted Kuwait to 93 runs, securing a comfortable victory and their record sixth Hong Kong Sixes title.This structured tournament success highlighted Pakistan's continued dominance in the Hong Kong Sixes format, adding another trophy to their impressive collection. The combination of experienced players and emerging talents like Shahzad contributed to their successful campaign.The tournament showcased Pakistan's ability to perform under pressure, particularly evident in their tight semifinal victory and their dominant display in the final. Their only defeat came against traditional rivals India, but they bounced back strongly to claim the ultimate prize.The victory strengthens Pakistan's position as the most successful team in Hong Kong Sixes history, with their sixth title setting a new benchmark in the competition. The tournament also provided a platform for young talents like Shahzad to display their skills on an international stage.",Pakistan secured their sixth Hong Kong Sixes title this weekend.

Is Sanju Samson a misfit in India middle-order? Here's how he has been preparing in the nets

NEW DELHI: Mult ipl e IPL franchises have been tracking the conversations related to Sanju Samson ever since the glovesman expressed his desire to leave Rajasthan Royals (RR) after a seven-season association. Many enquired, most interacted, but months after chatter, negotiations and a lot of interest, Samson trade could well remain on Chennai Super Kings ' (CSK) table - a conversation which first happened months back.As TimesofIndia.com had reported on November 1, RR had reached out to CSK for a potential deal involving Ravindra Jadeja but there wasn't any movement, and it remained on the backburner because Delhi Capitals (DC) and RR were actively involved in negotiations. The two parties were closing in on a swap involving Samson and Tristan Stubbs, and while there was an agreement of sorts on that, the dealbreaker, it is learnt, turned out to be the uncapped player demand by RR to go with Stubbs.RR demanded the services of Sameer Rizvi, and there was a lot of reluctance within the DC camp to let go of the player they see a lot of potential in. The Stubbs deal was so close to getting inked that it even reached the ears of senior players in the DC unit, and some prominent overseas names involved in the franchise. With the negotiations ending abruptly, RR, which had smartly kept other options active, knocked on CSK's doors again.The five-time champions, meanwhile, are understood to have reached out to Jadeja during that period, to gauge his plans and what he had in mind. It's understood that they gave their sharpest administrator the responsibility of doing the tough talk with Jadeja and getting clarity on the future.It is worth noting that this wasn't the first time RR and CSK were engaging on the Samson trade, but this time, there was a lot of intent. That intent came from the fact that active negotiations and conversations with other franchises didn't materialise into a trade, and that CSK remained the interested party.While the franchise CEO Kasi Viswanathan maintained that they are hopeful of seeing MS Dhoni back on the park in 2026, if the Samson deal materialises, that could change or reduce the appearances of the former captain.""We are extremely hopeful that he (MS Dhoni) will be playing the next season,"" Kasi Viswanathan had told TimesofIndia.com.The IPL trade remains a fluid conversation, and it is not just a direct swap involving Jadeja and Samson but another CSK player. It could be either Matheesha Pathirana or Sam Curran as RR have been very proactive in extracting the most out of this transaction. Names of Dewald Brevis and Shivam Dube also came to the discussion table but were rejected by CSK.The next few days could provide more clarity on the matter, but as of now, the DC deal is off, and Samson either goes to CSK or back to the auction pool.",IPL franchises have been tracking the conversations related to Sanju Samson.

Andy Bichel Interview | Why the former Australia cricketer compared Virat Kohli with Ricky Ponting

Poll Do you agree with Asadullah Khan's view that Cricket Australia is politicizing cricket by refusing to play against Afghanistan? Yes, I agree No, I disagree

NEW DELHI: Former Afghanistan cricketer and current chief selector Asadullah Khan has lashed out at Cricket Australia (CA) for its continued refusal to play bilateral series against Afghanistan, calling the move “unfair, political, and against the gentleman's spirit” of the game.In an interview with PTI, Asadullah criticised Australia's stance of linking sports with politics, after CA once again avoided a scheduled series citing Taliban's restrictions on women's rights.“Our women's cricket team hasn't played any matches in recent years, and this will take time to change. But Cricket Australia and other Boards linking cricket with politics — I don't think that's a good sign for the gentleman's game,” said Khan.Reiterating that Afghanistan's rise in world cricket was based purely on merit, the former player said the country deserved respect, not isolation.“We didn't get ICC full-member status as a charity; we earned it through performance and credibility. Our spin attack is among the best in the world, and our winning percentage is impressive. If, despite all this, some countries are politicising our cricket, it's like bringing a great team down,” he asserted.Cricket Australia had withdrawn from a three-match T20I series last year, stating that playing Afghanistan would be inconsistent with its commitment to supporting women's rights. Asadullah, while acknowledging Afghanistan's internal challenges, said isolating its cricket team was not a solution.“There are cultural factors involved, and change takes time. But refusing to play with us because of that will only hurt the men's game too,” he observed.Khan expressed gratitude to India and the BCCI for standing by Afghan cricket, especially by hosting their home matches and accommodating players in the IPL.“We are thankful to all teams that continue to play with us, especially India. The BCCI has played a major role by providing us grounds and IPL exposure,” he said.Confident about Afghanistan's upcoming T20 World Cup campaign, Khan added, “Our unit is strong — the openers are settled, and our spin and pace attacks can beat any team. We genuinely believe we can win the World Cup.”","Former Afghanistan cricketer and current chief selector Asadullah Khan has lashed out at Cricket Australia (CA) for its continued refusal to play bilateral series against Afghanistan.

NEW DELHI: India's swashbuckling opener Shafali Verma opened up on the intense emotions and thought process that powered her to a match-winning performance in the ICC Women's World Cup final, saying she was determined to “stay calm and execute her plans” despite the nerves of the big stage.Speaking at a felicitation event in her hometown Rohtak on Sunday, the 21-year-old reflected on the journey that took her from a year of personal struggle to the pinnacle of world cricket.“The last one year was very tough for me.

India cricketers look very happy after win over Australia | Visuals from ground

Having been forced to settle for draws in their last two matches against Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan after enjoying a winning start to their 2025-26 Ranji Trophy campaign against Jammu & Kashmir, Mumbai look set to return to their winning ways in their fourth round Elite Group D clash against a hapless, disappointing Himachal at the MCA ground in BKC.On a hot Sunday, Mumbai, dishing out some clinical cricket in familiar surroundings, turned on the heat, literally, on Himachal, reducing the visitors to 94 for seven in 37 overs after keeping them out on the field for 137.2 overs while putting up 446. With the surface offering some turn and variable bounce on Day Two, Himanshu Singh, a young, tall, promising off-spinner who was last season asked to bowl in the India nets by the national selectors, took three quick wickets while conceding 26 in eight overs after fast bowlers Tushar Deshpande (two for 21 in six overs) and captain Shardul Thakur (1-21 in seven overs) bowled a hostile spell then saw Himachal reeling at 18 for three at tea.Before the match, Himachal captain Ankush Bains, exuding confidence in his side, had said, “There’s no pressure on us about playing against Mumbai. We are taking this positively. We have defeated Mumbai once or twice in One-dayers before. We’ve come to play good cricket, and we’ll do that.” So far, Bains and his team have hardly walked that talk, and have been completely outclassed by a determined Mumbai, which has fought back brilliantly to pin the opposition on the mat after being reduced to 35 for three and 73 for four in the first session of the match.Bains, a wicketkeeper-batter and opener, was the first to succumb, in just the second over for one, while top-edging a pull shot off Tushar Deshpande. Trailing by 352 runs with just three wickets in the bag, Himachal look set to face the ignominy of being asked to follow-on. Unless the visitors put up some sort of a fight in the second innings, Mumbai will be hoping to wrap this game up on Day Three on Monday and grab an outright win with a bonus point, which would yield them seven points, which could all prove to be crucial in the end.Before the bowlers decimated Himachal's top and middle-order, allrounder Shams Mulani (69, 122b, 9x4) once again delivered with the bat, scoring his 21st First-Class half-century to help Mumbai, who resumed the day at 289 for five, add 157 runs to its total. When they lost Thakur's wicket (stumped or one off Aryaman Singh), Mumbai were 358 for eight. However, a 75-run partnership in 125 balls for the ninth wicket between Mulani and Deshpande (38, 66b, 3x4, 1x6), who had scored a hundred while batting at No 11 against Baroda at BKC in the Ranji Trophy quarterfinal back in Feb 2024, tortured Himachal's bowlers further.Looking fluent from the start, Mulani, who later bowled a tight spell (1-12 in 11 overs), cut the first ball he faced for a four before unleashing some more shots.The sole bright spot in Himachal's bowling was left-arm spinner Mayank Dagar, who toiled manfully for as many as 48.2 overs while taking four for 111. centurion Siddhesh Lad, who added 27 runs to his overnight score of 100, being amongst his victims. Failing to apply themselves at the wicket and looking in a hurry to join their colleagues in the dressing room, Himachal’s batters failed to learn anything from Lad’s patient 348-minute vigil that steered Mumbai out of choppy waters into a dominant position in the game.","Mumbai reduced Himachal to 94 for seven in 37 overs after keeping them out on the field for 137.2 overs while putting up 446.

Manchester City marked Pep Guardiola’s 1,000th game as a manager in style, cruising to a 3-0 victory over Liverpool to reignite their Premier League title charge on Sunday. At the other end of the table, Nottingham Forest boosted their survival hopes with a 3-1 win over Leeds.Erling Haaland missed an early penalty at the Etihad but made amends soon after, opening the scoring to set City on their way. Nico González doubled the lead before half-time, and Jeremy Doku — the standout performer — sealed the result with a third after the break.It was a fitting celebration for Guardiola, the former Barcelona and Bayern Munich boss, who has now racked up 716 wins in a glittering 17-year managerial career.With the win, second-placed City sit just four points adrift of leaders Arsenal, who dropped points after conceding a stoppage-time equaliser in their 2-2 draw at Sunderland on Saturday.It was a fitting celebration for Guardiola, the former Barcelona and Bayern Munich boss, who has now racked up 716 wins in a glittering 17-year managerial career.With the win, second-placed City sit just four points adrift of leaders Arsenal, who dropped points after conceding a stoppage-time equaliser in their 2-2 draw at Sunderland on Saturday.""My players gave me a good present with this performance against the champions. They all performed to the highest level,"" Guardiola said.""Proud to do it here in Manchester in front of my family, especially against Liverpool. I have a huge respect for that club.""City's seventh win in their last eight games in all competitions was a major blow to Liverpool's hopes of retaining the title.The troubled champions have lost seven of their last 10 matches in all competitions and trail Arsenal by eight points.They are marooned in eighth place after the momentum from successive wins over Aston Villa and Real Madrid dissipated into the rainy Manchester air.""We struggled a lot in the first half. It was obvious they were better than us,"" Liverpool boss Arne Slot said.""We need to improve but I didn't need this game to know this.""Haaland squandered a golden opportunity to put City ahead in the 12th minute when VAR ruled Doku was tripped by Liverpool goalkeeper Giorgi Mamardashvili just inside the penalty area.Mamardashvili made amends as he dived to his left to save Haaland's spot-kick.But Haaland was unfazed by his miss and the Norwegian put City in front in the 29th minute.At the climax of a flowing 20-pass move that carried City from deep inside their own half, Matheus Nunes crossed towards Haaland, who rose above Ibrahima Konate to head home from 10 yards.It was Haaland's 99th Premier League goal since signing from Borussia Dortmund in 2022.Haaland has scored 19 times in 15 games in all competitions for City this season.Virgil van Dijk's headed equaliser late in the first half was controversially disallowed by VAR for offside against Andrew Robertson.""It is obvious and clear that the wrong decision has been made,"" Slot said.Gonzalez unloaded a long-range drive that deflected in off Van Dijk just before half-time.Doku delivered the knockout blow when he curled a superb strike past Mamardashvili from 25 yards in the 63rd minute.At the City Ground, Forest trailed to Lukas Nmecha's 13th-minute opener.But Ibrahim Sangare equalised two minutes later and Morgan Gibbs-White headed home after 68 minutes before Elliot Anderson scored a stoppage-time penalty.It was Forest's first league victory since beating Brentford on the opening weekend of the season in August.Nuno Espirito Santo was in charge of Forest then, before being sacked to make way for Ange Postecoglou, whose brief reign also ended with his dismissal before Sean Dyche took charge.Second-bottom Forest's maiden top-flight victory under Dyche's management lifted them to within one point of safety.Aston Villa thrashed Bournemouth 4-0 to make it five wins from their last six league games.Emiliano Buendia, Amadou Onana, Ross Barkley and Donyell Malen scored at Villa Park, while Bournemouth's Antoine Semenyo had a penalty saved by Emiliano Martinez.Newcastle's miserable away form continued with a dismal 3-1 defeat at Brentford.Kevin Schade's 56th minute equaliser cancelled out Harvey Barnes' first half opener.Newcastle defender Dan Burn was sent off in the 73rd minute after conceding a penalty that Igor Thiago converted before the Brazilian struck again in stoppage-time.Newcastle are 14th and have failed to win an away league match in nine attempts since April.Crystal Palace and Brighton shared a 0-0 draw at Selhurst Park to leave both teams in mid-table.","Manchester City beat Liverpool 3-0 at the Etihad in Pep Guardiola's 1,000th game as a manager.

Real Madrid settled for a goalless draw against Rayo Vallecano on Sunday, maintaining their position at the top of La Liga. The result put them five points ahead of Villarreal and six points clear of Barcelona, who were scheduled to face Celta Vigo later.The derby match saw Rayo Vallecano put up a strong defensive display against the league leaders. While Real Madrid created more chances, the home team also had opportunities to win in what turned out to be a scrappy encounter.Rayo successfully contained La Liga's leading scorer Kylian Mbappe , while also keeping Vinicius Junior and Jude Bellingham in check. This marked Real Madrid's second dropped points in the league this season, following their Champions League loss to Liverpool at Anfield.""I want to keep growing, improving, with positive and constructive self-criticism -- this is Real Madrid, we all know where we are and what we want. We're in November, there's a long way to go, we need to be demanding of ourselves (but) also be measured,"" Alonso told reporters.The match began with Rayo showing early initiative as Andrei Ratiu tested Madrid goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois. Madrid gradually took control of the game, but Rayo remained resolute at their Vallecas stadium.Both teams had their chances in the first half. Raul Asencio missed a good heading opportunity, while Batalla made an impressive save to deny Vinicius.The home team effectively limited Mbappe's involvement, preventing the French striker from making his usual impact. At halftime, Madrid's coach Alonso substituted Dean Huijsen with Eder Militao.The second half saw De Frutos come close to scoring for Rayo, hitting the side netting from Pacha Espino's cross. Bellingham tested Batalla with a well-controlled shot, while Mbappe managed his first attempt on the hour mark.Valverde's long-range effort was saved by Batalla, and Alvaro Garcia fired over for Rayo. In the closing stages, Trent Alexander-Arnold made an appearance as he continues his return from injury.Arda Guler nearly broke the deadlock in stoppage time with a deflected shot, but Rayo held on for a point.""I'm happy with the team's work, and we had chances too to take all three points,"" Rayo Vallecano goalkeeper Augusto Batalla told DAZN.

Poll Should more overseas-born players be allowed to represent India in football? Yes, it enriches the team No, focus on homegrown talent Only if they have Indian heritage

NEW DELHI: Indian football took another step into a new era on Sunday as Ryan Williams, the Australia-born forward who recently became an Indian citizen, officially joined the national team camp in Bengaluru ahead of the AFC Asian Cup qualifier against Bangladesh on November 18.The All India Football Federation (AIFF) confirmed his arrival, saying, “Forward Ryan Williams and defender Jay Gupta have joined the senior men’s national team camp in Bengaluru.” The camp, led by newly appointed head coach Khalid Jamil, began on Thursday and has already welcomed overseas-based players Abneet Bharti and now Williams, reflecting a fresh and ambitious direction for Indian football.Williams’ inclusion adds international quality to the squad. The 32-year-old, who plays for Bengaluru FC in the Indian Super League, is known for his pace and technical ability — assets India will hope to harness in the must-win qualifier in Dhaka.Though the former Australian international’s decision to relinquish his Australian passport made headlines last week, his participation in the national camp marks the first official step towards his potential debut in Indian colours.The citizenship handover ceremony was held at Bengaluru FC’s training facility, where Williams received his Indian passport from captain Sunil Chhetri , a symbolic moment that underscored his commitment to his new home.“Honoured to make official what’s long felt true… India, I’m one of your own,” Williams had written earlier on Instagram.Born in Perth to a Mumbai-born mother and English father, Williams has previously represented Australia at U-20 and U-23 levels, and made a senior appearance in a 2019 friendly against South Korea.Before moving to India, he played for Fulham and Portsmouth in England.

I saw a film today, oh boy. It was a day in the life of superstar Erling Haaland — how he loves his eggs sunny side up and his morning coffee laced with maple syrup, drunk from a mug titled ‘good vibes only’. He can barbecue a mean ‘tomahawk’ steak, with a little help from his girlfriend Isabel, who assists with a bearnaise sauce. Does Gordon Ramsay live next door?There’s a bit about LED red light therapy also, and ice baths, along with a section on his liking for raw milk which reportedly unleashed this whole new debate in England. “It’s all about maintaining high energy levels, staying motivated and doing what’s best for both my body and my mind so I’m prepared for whatever comes next,” Haaland told TOI in an exclusive interaction facilitated by JioHotstar.So far, the documentary uploaded on his YouTube channel has 6.7m views. You can see the big bear, but you don’t see the little one. “My life has changed a bit since my son was born, so there are some new routines and responsibilities compared to previous seasons,” he added.Being a father and unwinding at home has definitely helped the 25-year-old reach a new level of prolificacy — Liverpool, beware, he has already scored 13 goals in 10 EPL games — and this bundle of joy has added more lightness to his power-packed frame.“I’ve never felt better,” Haaland had alluded to this welcome change after scoring five goals in a Norwegian demolition of Moldova in Sept. “You need the balance between focusing and the opposite — not focusing at all. ”The defender’s nightmare has another dream record to add to his collection. A goal against his old club Dortmund midweek saw him become the first player to score in five consecutive Champions League games for three different clubs, Salzburg his first love in the striker’s marauding run.No wonder, City coach Pep Guardiola has started comparing him to the untouchables Messi and Ronaldo, in terms of influencing a team. “I should not think I am something just because I’m scoring goals. I’m just Erling and this will never change,” Haaland gave some classic quotes, downplaying Pep’s tall praise.The ‘boyhood blue’ who was born a month after his father Alf-Inge joined the City of Maine Road, however, did say he was the ‘same Erling but with more experience’. And more guidance from the master teacher, who will be in charge of his 1000th game as a manager, against Liverpool at home this Sunday. “Since joining City, Guardiola has significantly helped me refine my movements and put myself in positions where I can score,” Haaland told TOI. “He’s a genius, and his support has played a big role in my development as a goal scorer.”Will he score and help City keep up with Arsenal and put daylight between them and Liverpool? “I try not to focus too much on other people’s expectations. It’s important to keep my mind clear, not overthink. There’s always pressure, but I prefer to stay in my own zone, whether things go as planned or not.”“I keep reminding myself to keep perspective,” said ‘Just Erling’, the 6ft 4in ‘kid’ from agrarian Byrne. His local hop to a Cheshire farm, among other things, keeps him grounded.(WATCH MANCHESTER CITY VS LIVERPOOL IN THE PREMIER LEAGUE ON NOV 9, LIVE & EXCLUSIVE ON STAR SPORTS NETWORK AND JIOHOTSTAR)","Erling Haaland is the first player to score in five consecutive Champions League games for three different clubs.

Poll Do you think Antoine Griezmann should start more matches for Atletico Madrid? Yes, he deserves more playtime No, Alvarez and Sorloth up front is better

Antoine Griezmann came off the bench to score twice and steer Atletico Madrid to a 3-1 victory over Levante in La Liga on Saturday, keeping Diego Simeone’s men firmly in the top-four race.The French forward, who has started only one of Atletico’s last five matches, made an instant impact after being introduced just past the hour mark. He scored 28 seconds after coming on, which was incidetally the fastest goal by a substitute in La Liga in the past decade. He then went on to sealin the win late on.Atletico took the lead in the 12th minute when Pablo Barrios’ cross-shot was parried by goalkeeper Mathew Ryan onto defender Adrian de la Fuente and into the net for an own goal.Levante hit back quickly as Manu Sanchez headed in from a corner in the 21st minute, becoming the first player to score against Atletico in four league matches.Simeone turned to Griezmann midway through the second half, and the veteran forward responded immediately, finishing from close range after Marcos Llorente’s cutback to restore Atletico’s advantage.Levante came close to equalising through Goduine Koyalipou, but Jan Oblak produced a strong save to keep the hosts in front.Griezmann then grabbed his second of the night with 10 minutes left, pouncing on a rebound after Ryan had denied Julian Alvarez.Levante thought they had reduced the deficit in stoppage time through Carlos Alvarez, but the goal was ruled out for offside against Matias Moreno.“It’s hard for us to find solutions sometimes, but those of us who come on from the bench are always bringing a boost,” Griezmann told. “Teams that go far in all competitions do that because they have good depth, and we all have to be ready.”Reflecting on his limited starts, he added: “I prefer to play, in the end when you’re a player you want to play... but I accept it, I am a professional and I have to continue like this to support my team-mates.”The win provisionally lifted Atletico into third place ahead of Villarreal’s late fixture, while Levante remain hovering above the relegation zone.Afterwards, Villarreal took second spot in the standings, with Barcelona third and Atletico just behind, with 25 points in 12 games. Real Madrid lead the pack with 30 points in 11 league outings.","Atletico Madrid beat Levante 3-1 in La Liga on Saturday. Antoine Griezmann came off the bench to score twice for Diego Simeone's side.

Poll Should Arsenal be concerned after their first winless game in weeks? Yes, it's a worrying sign No, they will bounce back immediately

Arsenal’s 10-match winning streak came to a dramatic end as Brian Brobbey struck deep into stoppage time to earn Sunderland a 2-2 draw in the Premier League on Saturday, while Manchester United salvaged a last-minute equaliser in a 2-2 thriller at Tottenham.At the Stadium of Light, former Arsenal defender Dan Ballard gave Sunderland the lead in the 36th minute with a powerful finish, ending the Gunners’ run of eight consecutive clean sheets in all competitions.Bukayo Saka brought Arsenal level nine minutes into the second half with a calm finish, and Leandro Trossard’s strike from the edge of the area in the 74th minute seemed to have secured another victory for Mikel Arteta’s side.But in the fourth minute of added time, Brobbey pounced on Ballard’s header to snatch a point for the hosts.It was Arsenal’s first game without a win since their 1-1 draw with Manchester City in September, though they remain six points clear of second-placed Chelsea, who beat Wolves 3-0 earlier in the day.City could trim the gap to four points with a win over Liverpool on Sunday.“We conceded two similar goals, which is not good enough for ourselves,” said Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta.“But it’s true that we showed an incredible resilience and courage to come back. Even at the end after we conceded the goal we had a massive chance to win it.”At the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, Manchester United were forced to settle for a draw after a dramatic finish. Bryan Mbeumo opened the scoring for United in the 32nd minute, silencing the home crowd as frustration grew among Tottenham supporters.Spurred by late momentum, Tottenham levelled through Mathys Tel in the 84th minute before Richarlison’s deflection off a Wilson Odobert shot put them 2-1 ahead in stoppage time. But Matthijs de Ligt rescued United with a towering header in the 96th minute, extending their unbeaten run to five matches.“We have so much to grow as a team because today was our day to win,” United manager Ruben Amorim said. “If we have a little bit more bravery, we can kill this game.”Tottenham manager Thomas Frank admitted his side fell short defensively, saying, “A lot of things we could have done a bit better. The last goal is all about the urgency, maybe don’t give the cross away and defend better.”","Arsenal's 10-match winning streak came to a dramatic end as Brian Brobbey struck deep into stoppage time to earn Sunderland a 2-2 draw in the Premier League on Saturday.

The New England Patriots are officially back to looking like the powerhouse fans once knew. With a thrilling 28-23 victory over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, the Patriots notched their seventh straight win, improving to 8-2 and claiming the top spot in the AFC East. Quarterback Drake Maye once again showed why he’s the frontrunner in the NFL MVP race, throwing for 270 yards and two touchdowns despite missing key offensive weapons. From the stands, his wife Ann Maye couldn’t hold back her excitement, posting a short but powerful message on Instagram: “Pats win again! 🥳”It’s been quite the ride for the young couple. Drake, the former UNC Tar Heel superstar and No. 3 overall pick in the 2024 NFL Draft, has seamlessly transitioned into the Patriots’ franchise quarterback. Ann, who also attended UNC and whose brother Tad once played alongside Maye, has been by his side since their middle school days. The two tied the knot in June 2025, and she’s quickly become a familiar face to fans—often sharing her stylish game-day looks, from all-red fits to striking blue ensembles. This week, though, she let the team’s win speak louder than fashion.Drake Maye’s rise in New England feels like a modern echo of the Tom Brady-Bill Belichick era.With 2,555 passing yards, 19 touchdowns, and just five interceptions this season, Maye is redefining what it means to be the Patriots’ quarterback. Against Tampa Bay, he showed poise and precision, connecting on deep plays—including a 72-yard touchdown strike to Kyle Williams—that kept the Buccaneers defense on its heels.Even without top receiver Kayshon Boutte and star running back Rhamondre Stevenson, Maye elevated everyone around him. His ability to read defenses, stretch the field, and deliver under pressure is turning skeptics into believers. The Patriots’ offense, once known for its grind-it-out approach, has suddenly become one of the league’s most explosive units.Maye’s consistent excellence has kept him firmly atop the MVP leaderboard with +250 odds, ahead of Matthew Stafford, Jonathan Taylor, and Josh Allen. As New England prepares to host the Miami Dolphins on Thursday night, all eyes are on whether Maye can extend the streak to eight.For Patriots fans, the message is clear—after years of uncertainty post-Brady, they’ve finally found their next great leader.

Detroit Lions quarterback Jared Goff once kept his relationship a secret

Detroit Lions quarterback Jared Goff and model Christen Harper’s love story didn’t start under the bright lights or viral headlines. The two, now happily married since June 2024, began their relationship away from public scrutiny. Goff, who was drafted first overall by the Los Angeles Rams in 2016, met Harper three years later—but the budding romance was something he chose to share only with a few close friends and family. For a player constantly in the media spotlight, Goff valued keeping that part of his life quiet. That discretion, in many ways, defined the early phase of their relationship.When Goff was traded to the Detroit Lions in 2021, Harper proved her loyalty by moving across the country to be with him. Leaving behind her career and comfort zone in Los Angeles, the model embraced a completely new chapter. “We’ve always been in California, so there was an excitement to a fresh start, but at the same time, my whole career has been in L.A. and I did not know what it was going to look like moving away from that,” Harper told the New York Post. “I feel lucky to kind of start branching out into doing different things. I think the space allowed me to do that because if I stayed in L.A.,I probably would have continued to do the same work I’ve done for years.”Before Harper entered his life, Goff admitted that dating in Los Angeles wasn’t easy. While meeting people came naturally, maintaining meaningful connections was tougher. He told ESPN, “It’s not tough to meet them (women). No, I mean, you can meet a bunch of girls out here. It’s tough to keep them.” The quarterback also confessed to Bleacher Report that career success played a role in his personal life, saying, “Do you think Tom Brady is with Gisele [Bundchen] if he doesn’t win a Super Bowl? No. There’s nothing that matters if you don’t win games. It’s just like if you’re an actor or actress or a rapper or anything. If you don’t produce, people won’t care.”But things changed in 2019 when Goff met Harper on the celebrity dating app Raya. At the time, Harper had no plans to settle down. “I was truly not looking for anything at the time,” she told Sports Illustrated. “I had just gotten out of a long relationship, and I was trying to stay single for a year. Then I met him and the rest is history, baby.”From keeping their relationship hidden to becoming one of the NFL’s most admired couples, Jared Goff and Christen Harper’s story is a blend of quiet beginnings, mutual sacrifice, and enduring love. Their marriage in 2024 and the birth of their daughter, Romy, in July 2025, mark a new chapter—one that’s no longer a secret but a celebration of everything they’ve built together.","Detroit Lions quarterback Jared Goff and model Christen Harper have been married since June 2024.

The New York Giants once again let a winnable game slip away, and this time, it came against the Chicago Bears. A late touchdown run from Caleb Williams sealed a stunning 24-20 loss for the Giants in Week 10, leaving their playoff hopes all but buried. It was another night of heartbreak for New York fans who watched a 10-point lead vanish in the final minutes. The defeat marked the team’s fourth straight loss, dropping them to 2-8 and anchoring them at the bottom of the NFC East.The frustration reached boiling point when quarterback Jaxson Dart left with a concussion, forcing veteran Russell Wilson to step in. Despite his experience, Wilson couldn’t find enough rhythm to close out the game, as the Bears mounted a fierce late rally. The collapse added fresh pressure on head coach Brian Daboll, who once again found himself at the center of job speculation that exploded online moments after the final whistle.No — the New York Giants have not fired Brian Daboll. Rumors about his dismissal spread like wildfire on Sunday after a fake post on X claimed the team had parted ways with the head coach. The post, from the parody account Wesley Steinberg, fooled thousands of frustrated fans and quickly went viral, gaining over two million views and thousands of shares.While no credible NFL insider has reported anything about Daboll being fired, the buzz reflects a growing discontent among the Giants’ fanbase. Team president John Mara reportedly considered firing Daboll after the Week 7 loss to the Denver Broncos, but the move didn’t gain enough internal backing. After another late-game meltdown, those discussions could easily resurface.When asked about his job status after the Bears game, Daboll told ESPN’s Jordan Raanan, “I’m just focused on these guys in the locker room.” His response was brief but telling — a sign that the pressure is mounting. The Giants’ recurring collapses, coupled with questionable in-game decisions, have left ownership in a difficult position.For now, Daboll remains the head coach, but his seat has never been hotter. With another disappointing season unfolding and fan patience wearing thin, the Giants must soon decide whether they still believe in Brian Daboll’s vision — or if it’s time to start over once again.","The New York Giants lost 24-20 to the Chicago Bears in Week 10.

Jordon Hudson’s “banned” necklace fuels Belichick family tension



More NFL coverage

Things are looking frosty in the Belichick family these days. During North Carolina’s tight 20–15 win over Stanford on Saturday, head coach Bill Belichick’s girlfriend, Jordon Hudson, and his daughter-in-law, Jennifer Schmitt, appeared to keep their distance. The two women attended the game at Chapel Hill but reportedly avoided each other entirely — a scene that didn’t go unnoticed by fans and cameras alike. While Belichick focused on leading his Tar Heels, the off-field drama between Hudson and Schmitt quietly took center stage.Jordon, 24, was seen standing with folded arms in a white tank top and a blue reptile miniskirt, while Jennifer matched the team colors in a white crop top and blue shorts. The chilly atmosphere between them follows their very public online feud earlier this year.The tension dates back months when Jennifer, who’s married to Belichick’s son Stephen, took a jab at Hudson’s behavior during Bill’s interview with CBS' Tony Dokoupil. Jennifer wrote, “Publicists act in a professional manner, and don’t 'storm' off set delaying an interview” — a pointed comment aimed squarely at Jordon. The young model had stepped in during that interview, prompting Bill to later defend her, saying she only intervened after he repeatedly told CBS Mornings producers he wanted to discuss his book, “The Art Of Winning: Lessons from My Life in Football.Since then, Hudson’s presence around UNC football has sparked constant headlines. Despite the Tar Heels’ 4–5 record, her game-day appearances continue to draw more attention than the team’s performance. At Saturday’s game, it was her outfit — especially a necklace featuring one word that seemed to reference her rumored “ban” from UNC facilities — that caught fans’ eyes.Back in May, rumors swirled that Hudson had been banned from team grounds, though the school denied them. Still, her choice of jewelry seemed like a subtle, perhaps petty, response to those claims. Standing on the sideline in stylish white boots, Hudson appeared unbothered and intent on making her presence felt.For now, the Tar Heels are finding their rhythm with two straight wins and another test coming against Wake Forest. But even as Bill Belichick brings his winning touch to Chapel Hill, it’s clear that the family drama off the field isn’t cooling down anytime soon.",Bill Belichick's girlfriend and daughter-in-law kept their distance during Saturday's game.

The Detroit Lions walked into Week 10 needing a spark, and Dan Campbell provided exactly that. Amid rising doubts after losing two of their last three games, Campbell made a gutsy, unannounced move that shifted the tone of the season. The head coach appeared to reclaim offensive play-calling duties during Sunday’s matchup against the Washington Commanders, and the impact was immediate.“#Lions HC Dan Campbell has a play sheet and is doing the talking into the headset in between plays,” reported Mike Garofolo of NFL Network via X. “Lots of indications of a disconnect between [offensive coordinator] John Morton and the players and coaches. Campbell appears to have taken over offensive play calling, which he indicated was possible.”It wasn’t just a change in voice—it was a full-scale revival. Campbell’s aggressive approach breathed life into an offense that had looked sluggish in recent weeks. The Lions dominated from the first whistle, scoring on all eight offensive possessions and finishing with a resounding 44-22 victory. Quarterback Jared Goff was sharp, completing 24 of 32 passes for 312 yards and three touchdowns, while the ground game piled up 139 rushing yards and another score.Amon-Ra St. Brown added flair to the night, breaking out the “Trump dance” after his first-quarter touchdown with President Donald Trump in attendance. Meanwhile, rookie standout Jahmyr Gibbs continued his breakout season, finding the end zone three times.The shift in play-calling came at a critical time. Morton, in his first year as Detroit’s offensive coordinator after Ben Johnson’s departure to the Chicago Bears, had struggled to replicate the Lions’ offensive success from previous seasons. Under Johnson, the Lions ranked among the league’s top four offenses over the past three years. Heading into Week 10, they sat just outside the top 10—a clear step backward.Campbell’s decision paid off instantly, marking Detroit’s highest offensive output in a month and reaffirming the Lions’ identity as one of the NFC’s most dangerous teams. The victory pushed them to 6-3, tied with the Bears atop the NFC North and back in the hunt for postseason contention.Next up, Detroit faces its biggest test yet—a Week 11 primetime clash against the defending Super Bowl champion Philadelphia Eagles. If Sunday’s performance is any indication, Dan Campbell’s bold hands-on approach might just be the key to keeping the Lions roaring through November.","Dan Campbell appeared to reclaim offensive play-calling duties during Sunday’s matchup against the Washington Commanders.

Aaron Rodgers’ ‘phantom’ wife mystery deepens as Steelers march forward



More NFL coverage

The Pittsburgh Steelers sit in first place atop the AFC North after their impressive win over the surging Indianapolis Colts. But while Aaron Rodgers is commanding headlines for his on-field performance, it's his mysterious wife, Brittani, who has everyone talking off the field. As Rodgers prepares to lead the Steelers against the Los Angeles Chargers in primetime on Nov. 9 — his first-ever game at SoFi Stadium — fans are wondering why the quarterback’s wife remains unseen.Rodgers, 41, first sparked marriage rumors after wearing a wedding ring to the Kentucky Derby in May. A month later, the four-time MVP confirmed that he had married Brittani shortly after signing his new deal with the Steelers. Yet, despite his openness about being married, there’s one glaring detail missing — no one has actually seen Brittani.During his tenure with the New York Jets, Rodgers reportedly met and fell in love with Brittani. But even now, in Pittsburgh, she remains a mystery. Not a single person in his close circle, including teammates and their partners, has met her. “She’s like a phantom,” a Steelers player’s wife told The Daily Mail before the Chargers game.“We all want to meet her, to invite her out, get to know her,” the woman added. “While there’s a social group of team wives and girlfriends... we haven’t met her yet. We don’t even know who she is.”A tip submitted to celebrity gossip site DeuxMoi claimed someone spotted Brittani at Novaria Coffee Co. in Pittsburgh. But the report raised more questions than it answered, as there was no description or confirmation that the woman was indeed Rodgers’ elusive wife.Rodgers addressed the speculation during an interview with ESPN’s Pat McAfee in June, saying, “I’m with somebody who’s private, who doesn’t want to be in the public eye, didn’t sign up to be a celebrity, doesn’t want to be a part of it.”He added, “If and when she wants to be out and there’s a picture, she’ll choose that.” Yet even Rodgers’ family hasn’t met Brittani. “I get being secretive, but come on,” a family member told The Daily Mail. “All anyone wants is for Aaron to be happy, so if he’s happy with her, we’d love to meet her. I don’t understand the cloak-and-dagger part of it all.”","Rodgers, 41, first sparked marriage rumors after wearing a wedding ring to the Kentucky Derby in May.

Lions weigh the medical reality as the NFL reviews Daron Payne’s conduct and potential additional discipline

More coverage on NFL:

Detroit Lions fans froze for a moment on Sunday, not because of a scoreboard swing, but because one of the most important players on the roster suddenly wasn’t on his feet. In real time, the moment barely looked real: Washington Commanders defensive tackle Daron Payne threw a punch at Amon-Ra St. Brown in the second quarter, and within seconds the referees went from yellow flag to ejection.What followed was both football chaos and medical urgency. Teammates gathered, trainers rushed in, and supporters immediately started asking one question: is St. Brown OK? His reliability and leadership make him more than just a receiver, he’s the calm heartbeat of the Lions offense.St. Brown was evaluated immediately and walked off with supervision and that alone was an encouraging early sign. Stadium-level reporting indicated he was “alert and communicating with trainers,” which eased the panic among fans who initially braced for the worst. Detroit hasn’t released a formal medical update yet, but the internal plan is to re-evaluate and rule out head or neck complications before determining his practice status.On the disciplinary side, Rule 12, Section 3, Article 1 is clear. Punching another player is automatically unsportsmanlike conduct, and a flagrant strike can warrant immediate disqualification.Payne was ejected on the spot, and the NFL will review the film. Historically, fines of $10,000 to $50,000 are common in cases like this, and repeat offenders can face suspensions.In terms of football impact? St. Brown isn’t just a chain-mover, he is Jared Goff’s rhythm stabilizer. Detroit’s entire short-area timing offense often begins with him in the slot. If he misses any time, even one practice block, the Lions may need Jameson Williams and Josh Reynolds to scale up usage in a hurry.For now, his status remains day-to-day, but the concern shows how irreplaceable he has become. Detroit knows this situation is bigger than one game. Until the medical update arrives, the organization will proceed cautiously. If St. Brown returns quickly, it stabilizes Detroit’s playoff push, if not, the offensive stress level instantly intensifies.","Amon-Ra St. Brown was injured after a punch from Washington's Daron Payne, causing immediate concern.

Giants QB Jaxson Dart ruled out with concussion after hard hit vs. Bears

More coverage on NFL:



The New York Giants just took another hit, literally. Rookie quarterback Jaxson Dart was ruled out of Sunday’s game against the Chicago Bears after suffering a concussion late in the matchup. What started as one of Dart’s best games of the season quickly turned worrying when he was taken to the locker room following a brutal hit that left him visibly shaken.The scary moment came late in the third quarter when Dart scrambled out of the pocket near midfield and was tackled hard while attempting to extend the play. The ball popped loose, resulting in a Bears recovery, but attention quickly shifted to Dart, who stayed down for a few moments before being helped to the sideline by trainers.He was taken to the blue medical tent for evaluation and soon after ruled out with a concussion. At the time of his exit, the rookie QB had been having an impressive outing, completing 19 of 29 passes for 242 yards, rushing for 66 yards, and scoring two touchdowns on the ground. His dual-threat playmaking had the Giants very much in the game before the injury derailed their momentum.Once Dart was sidelined, the Giants had to rely on their backup quarterback to finish the game but things didn’t exactly go smoothly.The offense, which had been clicking under Dart, struggled to find rhythm in his absence, allowing Chicago to pull ahead late.Head coach Brian Daboll addressed the injury after the game, confirming that Dart would enter the NFL’s concussion protocol. “He took a tough hit, and we just wanted to make sure we did the right thing,” Daboll said. “We’ll evaluate him throughout the week.”With the Giants facing a short turnaround before next week’s matchup, Dart’s recovery timeline becomes crucial. Under the league’s concussion policy, he must clear several medical steps before returning something that often takes at least a week or more.Dart’s absence would be a major setback for a Giants offense that’s finally shown flashes of life behind his arm and mobility. His ability to extend plays has been one of the few bright spots in a tough season, and fans are hoping the promising young QB can bounce back quickly.","Giants QB Jaxson Dart ruled out with concussion after hard hit vs. Bears.

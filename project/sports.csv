India Dominate Day 4! Siraj & Akash Deep Rattle England

Poll Was India's performance in the second Test a turning point in the series? Yes, definitely! No, it's too early to tell

NEW DELHI: India's commanding 336-run victory over England in the second Test at Edgbaston not only levelled the five-match series 1-1 but also triggered praise from former cricketers Dinesh Karthik and Michael Atherton, who hailed the performance as both ""satisfying"" and ""massive"" in context.One of the heroes of the match was 28-year-old pacer Akash Deep, who delivered career-best match figures of 10/187, including a superb 6/99 in the second innings, stepping up magnificently in the absence of rested ace Jasprit Bumrah. Playing just his eighth Test, Akash Deep helped dismiss England for 271 on Day Five as they attempted to chase an improbable 608.Reflecting on India’s historic first-ever Test win at Edgbaston, Dinesh Karthik said on Sky Sports, ""That's quite the performance. Look, we speak a lot about white-ball cricket, but you ask any cricketer who's played the longer format - the satisfaction that you get when you fight for five days and end with a win, there's not many better feelings in this sport.""India captain Shubman Gill added his own chapter to the record books, becoming the first player in Test history to score 250 and 150 in the same match, with innings of 269 and 161. He has now scored three centuries in his first two Tests as captain.Former England skipper Michael Atherton called it a “massive win”, especially given India’s comeback after the Headingley defeat.“Doing it without Jasprit Bumrah is a huge psychological statement,” Atherton said. “I think it's disappointing that England couldn't bat out a day's worth of cricket on a good pitch. India were fantastic, but England should have made a better fist of it.”England’s Jamie Smith (88) was the lone second-innings resistance, following his unbeaten 184 in the first. But with better fielding, relentless pace, and inspired leadership, India dominated every aspect of the Test.The teams now head to Lord’s for the third Test, beginning July 10, with the series finely poised.",India beat England by 336 runs in the second Test at Edgbaston. The result levelled the five-match series at 1-1.

Akash Deep press conference: On replacing Jasprit Bumrah, message from Gautam Gambhir and more

Akash Deep and Mohammed Siraj played a pivotal role in India’s 337-run win over England in the second Test at Edgbaston.The duo shared 17 wickets between them on a placid track, where bowlers had hardly anything throughout the five days.Akash Deep, who came as Bumrah’s replacement in this Test, bagged his maiden five-wicket haul of 6 for 99, dismissing England for 271 in their second innings. He took 10 in the match, and became only the second Indian bowler since Chetan Sharma in 1986 to finish the match with a 10-wicket haul.Meanwhile, Mohammed Siraj picked up seven wickets, including a six-fer.After the match, left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh shared a video on social media, which has gone viral.In the video, both Akash Deep and Siraj can be seen standing with the match souvenir, and Arshdeep has given the duo a new moniker.“Do bhai dono tabaahi (Two brothers, both destructive),” Arshdeep said, which left Siraj and Akash Deep in splits.Earlier in the Test, when Siraj bagged a fifer and was giving an interview to BCCI .tv, the left-arm seamer was again at his best.Arshdeep intervened and said: “Now change your dialogue.I only believe in myself and Jassi bhai.”The comment was on Siraj’s famous quote after India won the T20 World Cup in Barbados in 2024. After winning the trophy, Siraj had said: “I only believe in Jassi bhai, the game-changing player he is.”With the series level at 1-1, the third Test will be played at Lord’s, starting from Thursday.","Akash Deep and Mohammed Siraj played a pivotal role in India’s 337-run win over England in the second Test at Edgbaston.

Yashasvi Jaiswal on Team Culture & Supportive Dressing Room | IND vs ENG 2nd Test

NEW DELHI: Shubman Gill etched his name into Indian cricketing history on Sunday, becoming the youngest Indian captain to win a Test match overseas, leading his team to a record-breaking 336-run win against England in the second Test at Edgbaston.At 25 years and 301 days, Gill surpassed Sunil Gavaskar's long-standing record set in 1976 in Auckland. Gavaskar was 26 years and 202 days old when his side beat New Zealand almost half a century ago.The win - India’s first-ever at Edgbaston and biggest overseas victory in terms of runs - saw them level the five-match series 1-1. It surpassed the previous away record set in 2019, when India defeated West Indies by 318 runs at North Sound.Gill’s performance with the bat was nothing short of historic. He became the first batter in Test history to score 250 and 150 in the same match, compiling majestic innings of 269 and 161. This came on the back of his 147 in the first Test at Headingley, where India lost despite his century.With 585 runs at an average of 146.25 in just two Tests, Gill is now chasing Don Bradman’s legendary record of 974 runs in a series - a mark that has stood for 90 years.Speaking after the win, a composed yet proud Gill said, “Especially when you are the captain, I think you need to lead by example... so whenever there is another player in that situation, you can tell that player, this is what the team requires right now.”He added, “If a good ball gets me out, it gets me out. But as long as I am there, I want to play as long as possible.”Pace duo Mohammed Siraj and Akash Deep played key roles in England’s collapse, while Gill’s leadership - under the added weight of succeeding Rohit Sharma and filling Virat Kohli’s No. 4 slot - signaled a new era in Indian Test cricket.The third Test begins July 10 at Lord’s, where Gill’s India will now look to turn the tide further in their favour.","Shubman Gill becomes youngest Indian captain to win a Test match overseas.

'Any attack of ours can take 20 wickets anywhere': Shubman Gill hails Mohd Siraj, Akash Deep after historic Edgbaston win

Former India captain Virat Kohli was one of the first to congratulate Shubman Gill and Co. after their thumping 337-run win over England at Edgbaston. The win levelled the Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy, and the third Test will start on July 10 at Lord’s.“Great victory for India at Edgbaston. Fearless and kept pushing England to the wall,” Kohli wrote on X.“Brilliantly led by Shubman with the bat and in the field and impactful performances from everyone.“Special mention to Siraj and Akash for the way they bowled on this pitch. 👏🇮🇳 @ShubmanGill @mdsirajofficial #AkashDeep.”Replying to Kohli’s tweet, Siraj said: “Thank you bhaiya,” with a face holding back tears emoji.Siraj picked up seven wickets in the match, including a six-fer in the first innings.Siraj’s effort was also praised by another former India captain, Sourav Ganguly.“What a performance from Shubman Gill and his team… with the bat and now with the ball… Akash Deep and Siraj just brilliant. Indian attack looking far superior to the English attack. Akash Deep and Siraj are workhorses. India win without Bumrah… Can’t be a better result with the fantastic Gill in charge.What a fantastic batting effort,” Ganguly wrote on X.Siraj replied with courtesy, saying “Thank you sir,” with a folded hands emoji.Former India opener Virender Sehwag too showered praise on the Indian speedster.“Outstanding win in Birmingham.

NEW DELHI: Shubman Gill 's young India shattered a 58-year-old jinx with a thumping 336-run win over England in the second Test at Edgbaston, marking India’s first-ever victory at the venue and the longest wait for an Asian team to win at an away Test ground - 19 matches.This historic win surpassed the previous record held jointly by Pakistan at Lord’s (17 Tests, 1982) and Sri Lanka at Kensington Oval (17 Tests, 2018). India's own long wait at Gabba (16 Tests before winning in 2021) now stands behind Edgbaston on the list.While Shubman Gill's record-breaking innings (269 & 161) made headlines, it was Akash Deep, who emerged as the emotional and tactical backbone of the win. The 28-year-old pacer produced a stunning match haul of 10/187, including his maiden five-wicket haul (6/99) in the second innings.With Jasprit Bumrah unavailable, Akash stepped up in sensational fashion. Striking with sharp incutters, he dismantled England's top and middle order - dismissing Duckett, Root, Pope, and Brook - while his sister's cancer diagnosis remained a constant presence in his mind.“Every time I ran in, I thought of her,” Akash said quietly after the game.England resumed day five at 72/3, chasing an improbable 608, but resistance was brief. Jamie Smith (88) provided lone defiance before Akash dismissed him with a clever slow bouncer. Fittingly, Akash took the final wicket - caught by Gill - to seal India’s milestone win.The victory has reignited India’s series hopes as they head to Lord’s for the third Test, with Bumrah set to return and Akash Deep likely eager to continue his dream run down the famous slope.",India beat England by 336 runs in the second Test at Edgbaston.

NEW DELHI: India captain Shubman Gill has confirmed that pace ace Jasprit Bumrah will return for the third Test at Lord’s, after the visitors thrashed England by 336 runs at Edgbaston to level the Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy series 1-1.Despite Bumrah’s absence in the second Test, debutant Akash Deep stepped up in spectacular fashion — delivering match-winning figures of 10/187, including a stunning 6/99 in the second innings. The 27-year-old became only the second Indian bowler to claim a 10-wicket haul in a Test in England, after Chetan Sharma’s 10/188 at Birmingham in 1986.When asked about Bumrah’s availability for the third Test at Lord’s, Gill’s response was direct and confident: “Definitely.”India’s historic victory — their first-ever Test win at Edgbaston and their biggest away win by runs — came after they were trailing 0-1 in the series and without key players like Bumrah and Kuldeep Yadav.England, chasing a mammoth 608-run target, were bowled out for 271 with more than a session remaining on Day 5. In addition to Akash Deep’s heroics, India’s bowling unit saw contributions from Mohammed Siraj, Prasidh Krishna, Ravindra Jadeja, and Washington Sundar — all chipping in with one wicket each.Shubman Gill, leading from the front, starred with the bat by scoring 269 and 161 in the match — celebrating his maiden win as India’s Test captain in style.Reflecting on the team’s turnaround after the Leeds loss, Gill said:“All the things we spoke about after the first game, we were spot on. Our bowling and fielding was tremendous to see. We knew if we get 400–500 on this kind of wicket, we’ll be in the game. Not every time we’re going to drop that many catches.[Akash Deep] bowled with so much heart. The areas and lengths he hit — he was getting the ball to move both ways. On wickets like this, it’s difficult to do that. I’d say I’m feeling comfortable with my game. If we win the series with my contributions, I’ll feel happier.I’ve said this before — I want to play as a batsman, think as a batsman.”","India captain Shubman Gill confirms Jasprit Bumrah will return for the third Test at Lord's.

Real Madrid held off a late Borussia Dortmund surge to clinch a 3-2 win and book their place in the semi-finals of the FIFA Club World Cup, where they will face European champions Paris Saint-Germain. The match, played under sweltering heat at the MetLife Stadium near New York City, saw Gonzalo Garcia and Kylian Mbappe steal the show for the Spanish giants.Gonzalo Garcia, 21, opened the scoring in the 10th minute, slotting home his fourth goal of the tournament after an inch-perfect cross from Arda Guler. Ten minutes later, full-back Fran Garcia doubled the lead, finishing off a flowing move that included a cutback from Trent Alexander-Arnold. Real Madrid dominated the opening stages, stifling Dortmund’s rhythm and forcing them to chase shadows.Coach Xabi Alonso praised his team’s display but acknowledged the chaotic finish: “Everything was going under control… but the last 10 minutes were kind of crazy. Overall, a good 80 minutes and the last 10 minutes to improve.”Indeed, Dortmund mounted a dramatic late comeback.Maximilian Beier fired in from a loose clearance in the 93rd minute to make it 2-1. But Real’s response was emphatic — Mbappe, who came off the bench in the second half, produced a sensational overhead kick to restore the two-goal cushion.Mbappe, still yet to start in the tournament due to recent illness, now has his first goal of the Club World Cup and 44th of the season. ""It will be a great challenge for us to face PSG, but let's take positives from today and move on for the next one,"" said Alonso ahead of the semi-final showdown.There was still more drama to come, as Dean Huijsen was sent off for bringing down Serhou Guirassy, who converted the resulting penalty to bring Dortmund back within a goal.Despite the scare, Real held on, much to the delight of the 76,611 fans in attendance — a repeat of the 2024 Champions League final, but with far more twists.Dortmund coach Niko Kovac reflected, “It is a deserved win for Real Madrid. We showed our qualities and it is not a failure if you go home after a defeat against them.”","Real Madrid beat Borussia Dortmund 3-2 to reach the FIFA Club World Cup semi- finals.

Work and commitment

A late own-goal by goalkeeper Weverton took Chelsea through to the Club World Cup semi-finals on Friday as the Premier League side edged Palmeiras of Brazil 2-1 in a last-eight tie that had been lit up by a moment of magic from young star Estevao Willian.The teenage Brazil forward, who will join Chelsea after the tournament, was eager to impress his future employers and his brilliant 53rd-minute finish cancelled out Cole Palmer's opener in Philadelphia.But a deflected Malo Gusto cross went in off Palmeiras 'keeper Weverton in the 83rd minute to take Chelsea through to a semi-final showdown with another Brazilian side in Fluminense.""In the first half we were in control of the game and could have scored more than one goal,"" said Chelsea coach Enzo Maresca, dismissing suggestions his team had been fortunate.""They started the second half better than us and the dynamic of the game changed, but then in the last 25 minutes we were in control again and I think we deserved to win without being lucky.""The scoreline was a repeat of Chelsea's victory when the teams met in the final of the Club World Cup under the tournament's old guise in 2022.""Overall Chelsea was better. They have better players and a better coach,"" admitted Palmeiras coach Abel Ferreira.""They were lucky with the way they scored the second goal but it can happen in football and we need to accept it and move on.""Chelsea will now be fancied to go on and reach the final, with Fluminense standing in their way in the last four at the MetLife Stadium in New Jersey on Tuesday.If not everyone has yet been won over by the tournament, the intensity levels on the pitch are rising as it reaches the business end and there was a big-game atmosphere in Philadelphia.Lincoln Financial Field was almost sold out, with 65,782 fans in attendance despite much of the city having emptied out for the July 4 holiday and long weekend.This game played out to a backdrop of Independence Day fireworks lighting up the sky over the nearby Delaware River, but there were fireworks on the pitch too.Chelsea lit the spark first, going ahead in the 16th minute thanks to a moment of class from England international Palmer.After drifting into a pocket of space just outside the Palmeiras box, Palmer controlled a Trevoh Chalobah pass on the half-turn, carried on into the area and dispatched a low shot past Weverton.It was the ideal start for Chelsea, who lost to Flamengo when they last faced Brazilian opposition in the same stadium during the group stage.Maresca added extra Brazilian flavour to the occasion by handing a first start to young midfielder Andrey Santos.With Moises Caicedo suspended, Santos occupied the holding midfield role for Chelsea while Pedro Neto lined up on the right wing, choosing to play despite having to come to terms with the tragic death of his Portugal teammate Diogo Jota on Thursday.Playing on the right wing for Palmeiras was Estevao, the 18-year-old Brazil prodigy set to join Chelsea in a big-money transfer agreed over a year ago.He knew this could be his last game for the Sao Paulo side, and Chelsea probably should have been two ahead before the interval only for Christopher Nkunku to blaze over after being teed up by Palmer.Instead Palmeiras equalised eight minutes into the second half, with Estevao the inevitable scorer.Positioned inside the Chelsea box to the right, Estevao controlled a pass by Richard Rios and took a touch to get in front of Levi Colwill, another to steady himself, and then surprised goalkeeper Robert Sanchez with an early shot that went in off the bar.Chelsea responded by sending on new signing Joao Pedro for his debut, the Brazilian becoming the 27th player used by Maresca during the tournament.The Blues pushed in search of a second goal but extra time was looking likely when the Premier League side grabbed a scrappy winner with seven minutes of the 90 to play.Following a corner played short, Enzo Fernandez found Malo Gusto and his attempted low centre from the left side of the box deflected off the toe of Agustin Giay to surprise Weverton, with the ball striking him on its way in.Substitute Hercules struck a 70th-minute winner as Brazil's Fluminense defeated Saudi Arabia's Al Hilal 2-1 on Friday to reach the semi-finals of the Club World Cup.A fine left-foot finish from Matheus Martinelli had put the Rio club ahead in the 40th minute but Al Hilal's Brazilian forward Marcos Leonardo levelled six minutes into the second half before Hercules stole the show to the delight of the vast majority of the 43,091 crowd.Al Hilal had pulled off the biggest upset of the tournament, beating Manchester City 4-3, to reach the last eight and Simone Inzaghi's side fought hard until the end to keep their adventure alive.They bow out of the tournament having been unbeaten through the group stage, including holding Real Madrid to a draw, and having truly made their mark on the world stage.There was a moment's silence before the kick-off in memory of Liverpool and Portugal forward Diogo Jota and his younger brother Andre Silva, who died in the early hours of Thursday after their car veered off a motorway in Spain and burst into flames.Al Hilal's line-up featured two of Jota's Portugal team-mates in Ruben Neves and Joao Cancelo.The first half was a tight and tactical affair with few chances until Martinelli opened the scoring when he picked the ball up from Gabriel Fuentes inside the box and span out to give himself space for a left-foot shot that rocketed past Yassine Bounou.Al Hilal went close to a quick response when Kalidou Koulibaly's header forced Fluminense's 44-year-old goalkeeper Fabio into a fine save.The Saudi side were awarded a penalty when Samuel Xavier was ruled to have brought down Marcos Leonardo in the box but Dutch referee Danny Makkelie was eventually sent to the monitor where he overturned his own decision after seeing there had been no contact between the two players.After going in at the break trailing by a goal, Al Hilal came out strongly for the second half and drew level when Koulibaly headed a Neves corner down to Marcos Leonardo who poked home.Al Hilal's Brazilian full back Renan Lodi had a let off when his poor backpass fell straight at the feet of German Cano but the Fluminense striker's attempt to round Bounou was denied by the smart work of the Moroccan keeper.But the outcome was settled with 20 minutes remaining when half-time sub Hercules saw a shot from distance blocked but from the loose ball Samuel headed the ball back to the forward who raced into the box and fired past Bounou to make it 2-1.Al Hilal produced a flurry of corners and some intense pressure in the final minutes as they desperately sought a way to keep their dream alive but the Brazilians were good value for their victory.""We didn’t have many chances but we made the most of them, the entire group worked and were committed,"" said Fluminense coach Renato Gaucho.""Our fans here in the USA and those in Brazil, they can be proud and I ask them to wear a jersey, in the mall, street, beach, wherever, wear that shirt – they should all be proud to wear that jersey,"" he said.The Fluminense coach was full of praise for the performance of his 40-year-old central defender Thiago Silva who ensured the Brazilians were able to withstand the second half pressure from Al Hilal.""Thiago Silva is huge for us, I worked with him 15 years ago, he is a coach on the pitch, very helpful and conveys calm and experience to the others. He is our captain and a leader and in hard matches like these against big clubs, its important to have people like him. He is key and fundamental,"" he said.Al Hilal coach Inzaghi said his side had been unfortunate to end on the losing side.""It has been a good World Cup for us but clearly we leave with a little bit of a bitter taste in our mouth because after what happened in that second half, we deserved much more,"" he said.""It was a tight match, decided by episodes, as happens in football. Fluminense are very well organised team that are having an excellent tournament,"" he added.",Chelsea beat Palmeiras 2-1 to reach the Club World Cup semi-finals in Philadelphia.

We're all aware of the tragedy. We have two Portugal players Rúben Neves and João Cancelo who were friends to them. Today has been a very difficult day for all of us. We tried to work in the same way but the atmosphere was different. It's a very, very sad tragedy.""Neves shared his feelings through an emotional Instagram post: ""Wherever you are, I know you'll read this. We've never been that stupid and maybe now I regret it a little, but you know what you mean to me as much as I know what I mean to you… Life brought us together and now it can't separate us.

BENGALURU: Former India coach Igor Stimac who was sacked by the All India Football Federation (AIFF) last year and replaced with Manolo Marquez, who stepped down on Wednesday, said he was not surprised to hear that the Spanish gaffer had to leave the job after being in charge of the national team for just eight games.“The AIFF is run badly, without any clear idea on what to and how to do it,” Stimac told TOI. Stimac, who lost his job after India crashed out of the World Cup qualifiers had won a compensation of $ four lakh as compensation as the AIFF sacked him with one year left on his contract.Presenting his arguments on India's downward spiral from a world rank of 102 in 2023 to 127 in 2025, the former Croatian international said Indian players are not improving their skills through tournaments like the Indian Super League “Players are not progressing their game in such leagues like ISL which is without enough game intensity and pressure of results. Also, there's no relega- tion and lack of quality games,” Stimac said.He also said the national team does not get enough time to prepare. “FIFA windows are not long enough for preparation time when facing strong opponents. So the AIFF needs to reschedule the ISL calendar in favour of the national team.”Stimac also said the Indian footballers should come out of their comfort zone. “Unrealistic players’ salaries in ISL are putting players in a comfort zone.

Sebastien Buemi wins third spot on the podium in Jakarta



Sebastien Buemi’s performance in 2025 Formula E season

Coming as major good news for Envision Racing driver Sebastien Buemi, the removal of a time penalty from the last Jakarta race has landed him on the podium. Buemi is now officially promoted to third place, while Nico Mueller, who had originally celebrated a podium alongside Dan Ticktum and Edoardo Mortara at the Jakarta E-Prix, has been moved to fourth.The five-second penalty initially handed to Sebastien Buemi at the Jakarta E-Prix for contact with Mahindra Racing’s Edoardo Mortara was recently overturned following a FIA hearing. Due to the penalty, Buemi had finished eighth in Round 12 of the Jakarta race in June. However, the reversal has now reshaped the podium — much to Mueller’s disappointment.According to FormulaE.com, additional footage from Envision Racing's roll hoop camera, which was not available at the time the penalty was applied, was reviewed in detail. Buemi had received the penalty for an on-track collision with Mortara.The FIA stated: “The driver of Car 16 (Buemi) argued that the new element shows his overtaking manoeuvre was legitimate, that he was always in control of his car, and that when the slight contact occurred, he was fully alongside Car 48 (Mortara).”They further added: “The driver of Car 48 agreed with the assessment and mentioned he barely felt the contact.Upon careful consideration of the circumstances, the Stewards find that no single party bears whole or predominant responsibility for the collision. Therefore, the Stewards decide to reverse Decision 12. As a result, the penalty (i.e., five-second time penalty and one penalty point) on Car 16 is removed, and no further action will be taken in relation to this collision. ”With this update, Buemi moved to 10th in the Formula E Driver Standings with 63 points. In addition to his newly awarded Jakarta podium, he also has one win this season, in the Monaco E-Prix during Round 7.Also Read: Nico Mueller happy with Jakarta podium but adds, “It could have been even better with Jake” Buemi will now head to Berlin for Rounds 13 and 14 of the Formula E season.

What sets the Berlin E-Prix apart

What’s challenging about the Tempelhof Circuit?

Past Berlin E-Prix winners

Season 11 of Formula E is now nearing its close, with four races remaining across two venues. Next up is the Berlin E-Prix, scheduled from July 11–13. Berlin is the only venue to have hosted a Formula E race every season since the championship's inception, making it one of the most special events on the calendar for multiple reasons. It has been held annually without a miss since 2015, and its scenic venue — the historic Tempelhof Airport — adds to its charm. Here are some interesting facts about Rounds 15 and 16 of the Formula E season in Berlin.One look at the Tempelhof circuit explains why the Berlin E-Prix is so special. With imposing aircrafts parked on one side of the barrier and a vast expanse of open space on the other, it’s arguably one of the most picturesque tracks in motorsport.Formula E cars are second only to airplanes when it comes to reaching top speeds — hitting 322 km/h in less than a minute. The most distinctive aspect of the Tempelhof Airport circuit is that it was originally designed for airplanes to take off and land, making it a unique surface for electric racing.The surface of the 2.343 km-long Tempelhof circuit is composed of layered concrete slabs designed for aircraft operations.While it supports Formula E racing, it presents challenges in energy management, tyre wear, and grip. The hot summer temperatures in Berlin can further test the drivers. Despite that, the wide layout, long corners, and even an indoor tunnel make the track exciting and full of overtaking opportunities.The Berlin E-Prix is a home race for DS Penske driver Maximilian Gunther. He won the event in 2020 and secured a third-place finish in 2023. The German driver recently expressed his excitement on Instagram. Reflecting on the Jakarta race, Gunther wrote, “Didn’t go our way this Saturday in Jakarta. Thanks for all the love, Indonesia. Now all eyes on Berlin – my home race.”However, it is TAG Heuer Porsche’s Antonio Felix da Costa who holds the record for the most Berlin E-Prix wins, having triumphed three times — twice in 2020 and once in 2024. Envision Racing’s Sebastien Buemi, Lola Yamaha ABT’s Lucas di Grassi, and TCS Jaguar Racing’s Nick Cassidy have each won the race twice.Also Read: Season 11 Berlin Rookie Test: Formula E teams announce nominations, eligibility rules explained However, this year’s race may see a new winner, as has been the case in several recent Formula E rounds.

Most wonderful shots from Jakarta E-Prix

It was a dusty yet thrilling Formula E race in Jakarta, with the championship returning to Indonesia after two years. Formula E has now shared some of the best videos from the Jakarta E-Prix for fans to relive the Indonesian race again and again. The real footage appears as eye-catching as scenes from a racing movie — complete with synchronized reactions from the audience and ground staff.The shots from the Jakarta E-Prix were shared by Formula E on Instagram with the caption: “Our race in Jakarta would have made a beautiful movie.” The first video is a still camera shot from a turn on the circuit, as the GEN3 Evo cars speed down the track.

Do front row starts matter in Formula E? Oliver Rowland’s dominance says yes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/formula-e/do-front-row-starts-matter-in-formula-e-oliver-rowlands-dominance-says-yes/articleshow/122142779.cms,"Image credit: Oliver Rowland/Instagram

Formula E drivers with the most front row starts

Does pole position — or a front row start — guarantee a win? Well, in most cases, it does. If not, it at least enables the driver to finish the race on the podium or earn some points to add to their score in the Driver Standings. This season, it’s Nissan’s Oliver Rowland who has clinched five front row starts and is leading the 2025 Formula E Driver Standings. He is far ahead of the competition and is almost certain to have secured the ABB FIA Formula E World Championship title this year.Oliver Rowland is far ahead of the competition at the top of the Formula E Driver Standings with 172 points. He has taken pole twice and started on the front row in three other races this year.There is hardly any scenario in which anyone can beat him in the remaining four races — except one. If Pascal Wehrlein, who is second in the Driver Standings, wins and Rowland fails to score any points, then only can Rowland’s top spot be challenged. However, that is highly unlikely, and Rowland will most probably lift the world championship trophy in London with ease.TAG Heuer Porsche driver Pascal Wehrlein has three front row starts, including two poles.This suggests that front row starts do play a major role in a driver’s chances of a podium finish.Pascal, however, is behind Taylor Barnard, who has delivered the most impressive performance on track this year. The NEOM McLaren driver recorded four front row starts, including two poles this season. He already has four podium finishes in what can be considered his first year as a full-time Formula E driver.Meanwhile, DS Penske driver Maximilian Gunther, TAG Heuer Porsche’s Antonio Felix da Costa, and Andretti’s Jake Dennis have two front row starts each this season. Among others who have grabbed pole position are Nissan’s Norman Nato, Mahindra Racing’s Nyck de Vries, Cupra Kiro’s Dan Ticktum, and Jaguar TCS Racing’s Nick Cassidy.Also Read: Oliver Rowland’s daughter Harper turns four, Nissan driver shares glimpse of her birthday celebrations There are four more races to go before the current Formula E season comes to an end.

Poll How impressed are you with Carlos Alcaraz's performance so far at Wimbledon? Very impressed Somewhat impressed Not impressed

Carlos Alcaraz surged into the Wimbledon quarter-finals on Sunday, showing flashes of brilliance after a rocky start to defeat Russia's Andrey Rublev 6-7(5), 6-3, 6-4, 6-4. The 22-year-old Spaniard, aiming for a third consecutive title at the All England Club, once again delivered under pressure to keep his title defence alive.Alcaraz, who has looked vulnerable in the early rounds - dropping three sets in his first three matches - fell behind to the 14th-seeded Rublev under the Centre Court roof. But true to form, the five-time Grand Slam champion raised his level, thrilling fans with trademark shot-making and resilience.“I think I played intelligent and smart today against him, tactically,” Alcaraz said post-match. “A really good match, which I’m really proud about.”He credited his belief and mental strength for the turnaround: “One point can change the match completely, turn everything around. In tennis, you have to stay there all the time. Being strong mentally, to stay there. I knew that I was going to play better.”Next up for Alcaraz is Britain’s Cameron Norrie, who survived a five-set battle against Chile’s Nicolas Jarry to become the last home hope at Wimbledon.In the women’s draw, top seed Aryna Sabalenka continued her dominant run, defeating Elise Mertens 6-4, 7-6(4) to book a quarter-final spot against Germany’s Laura Siegemund. “With your support guys, I think everything is possible,” said Sabalenka, who has yet to lose a set this year.Elsewhere, Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova overcame Britain’s Sonay Kartal in straight sets despite a controversial line-calling glitch that temporarily derailed her momentum.Karen Khachanov and Taylor Fritz also advanced, the latter after Australian Jordan Thompson retired hurt.","Carlos Alcaraz beat Russia's Andrey Rublev 6-7(5), 6-3, 6-4,6-4.

Taylor Fritz moved into the Wimbledon quarterfinals for the third time in four years on Sunday, though not in the fashion he would have preferred. The No. 5 seed advanced after Australian Jordan Thompson was forced to retire due to injury, trailing 6-1, 3-0 after just 41 minutes of play.Thompson, who entered the match carrying back and leg issues, took a medical timeout early in the second set but was unable to continue after a brief attempt to play through the pain.“Just played a lot of tennis on a body that shouldn't have been, and it just took its toll,” the unseeded Australian said after the match.Fritz, who had battled through multiple five-setters earlier in the tournament, acknowledged the unfortunate circumstances: “It’s obviously not the way I want to go through. It’s just sad... Respect to him for coming out. His body’s not right.”The American will next face No. 17 seed Karen Khachanov, who defeated Poland’s Kamil Majchrzak 6-4, 6-2, 6-3.While Khachanov holds a 2-0 record over Fritz, their last meeting was back in 2020.“We practice all the time, so we’re pretty familiar with each other’s games,” Fritz said. “But I think I’ve improved a ton since then.”In a five-set thriller, Cam Norrie got the better of Nicolas Jarry.In the women’s draw, top seed Aryna Sabalenka booked her 11th straight Grand Slam quarterfinal, beating No. 24 Elise Mertens 6-4, 7-6(4).She’ll face veteran Laura Siegemund, who followed her win over Madison Keys by defeating lucky loser Solana Sierra 6-3, 6-2. The 37-year-old drew cheers from the crowd when her age was mentioned, joking, “It’s not that often you get such a compliment for being old.”Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova also returned to the Wimbledon quarterfinals for the first time in nine years, beating Britain’s Sonay Kartal 7-6(3), 6-4 despite a controversial missed call after a system outage.","Taylor Fritz moves into the Wimbledon quarterfinals for the third time in four years.

Defending champion Barbora Krejcikova suffered an emotional and painful exit from Wimbledon on Saturday, while Novak Djokovic cruised to his 100th career victory at the All England Club with a commanding performance. On a day of high drama and historic milestones, contrasting fortunes for the Czech star and the Serbian legend took center stage.Krejcikova, seeded 17th, was reduced to tears during her third-round clash on Court One as she succumbed 3-6, 7-6(4), 1-6 to American 10th seed Emma Navarro. Battling ongoing injury issues, the two-time Grand Slam winner appeared physically drained in the final set, capping off a difficult few months marred by fitness setbacks.""I was definitely enjoying myself and feeling quite well. Suddenly out of nowhere I just lost all my energy and couldn’t really gain it back,"" Krejcikova said. ""It’s very sad for me and very unfortunate.""Since lifting the Wimbledon trophy in 2023, Krejcikova has been plagued by a back injury, an early French Open exit, and a recent thigh strain that forced her out of Eastbourne. Despite valiant efforts earlier in the tournament, including a tough win over Caroline Dolehide, her body ultimately gave way.Meanwhile, Djokovic showed no signs of slowing down at age 38. The seven-time Wimbledon champion demolished compatriot Miomir Kecmanovic 6-3, 6-0, 6-4 in under two hours to reach the fourth round for a 17th time.""It’s very historic. It sounds very nice,"" said Djokovic, who celebrated with his daughter from the players’ box. ""Wimbledon is a favourite tournament and a dream for so many players.

Poll Which aspect of Sabalenka's game do you think contributed most to her victory? Mental resilience Powerful serves Strategic shot selection

Aryna Sabalenka’s third round match against Briton Emma Raducanu was about a couple of minutes old, but the Belarusian was already letting her frustration show.She gestured with her hands, and her face mirrored a storm. The roof over Centre Court was closed, which amplified the sound from the stands. The 15,000-strong crowd threw its weight behind the home player.Sometime, over the course of that 74-minute first set, when she saved eight set points, the 27-year-old turned inward. Only the odd shout of ‘come on’ scaled the decibel of her grunt. Every now and then she looked at her box and quietly pumped her fists.Sabalenka’s 7-6 (6), 6-4 two-hour win put her in the fourth round, where she faces Elise Mertens. Her real victory, however, wasn’t the one over the world No. 40, but was achieved as she held herself together when the home crowd egged on her opponent, signing up as a third feature in the match, just like on Chatrier, a month ago in Paris. ‘Break her, Emma!’ they urged between points, a few times between serves.Sabalenka found opportunity in her loss to Coco Gauff in the French Open, where she went down in a flood of 70 unforced errors.She had let the crowd get into her head, and later, she refused to give credit to her opponent.“I learned from that difficult lesson,” she said. “In the match, I just kept telling myself, you cannot let it happen again. Whatever happens on the court, you just have to be respectful, you have to be calm. I reminded myself I’m strong enough.”The truth is, when Sabalenka is playing her tennis, she’s destruction on a pair of strong legs. A couple of new elements make her more dangerous – drop shot, underspin, that allows her time to stay in the point. More times than not when she finishes on the wrong side of a score line, it is she who has lost the match.Sabalenka is not the first player to want the crowd on her side, Novak Djokovic knows about it. Unfortunately for the world No.1, the geopolitical situation being what it is, she has faced the brunt from the public, especially at Majors. Friday, however, wasn’t about the outside noise, it was about the calm she found inside her.","Aryna Sabalenka beat Emma Raducanu 7-6 (6), 6-4 in the third round.

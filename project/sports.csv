NEW DELHI:

Why the cricket maidaans of Mumbai are dying | Bombay Sport Exchange with Nadim Memon

Indian athletes have claimed the top rank in dope violations once again. The country’s athletes notched up a record 260 involvements in dope-related activities in the year 2024, as revealed by the latest World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) report. According to the report published on Wada’s website late on Tuesday, it has listed India as the worst doping offender globally for the third consecutive time.The findings emerged on the backdrop of India’s preparations to host the centenary edition of the Commonwealth Games in 2030 and is aggressively pushing for a bid to host the 2036 Olympics. The Inter national Olympic Committee (IOC) had red-flagged concerns over rampant doping when an Indian delegation visited its headquarters in the Swiss city of Lausanne in July to assess the feasibility of hosting the Olympic and Paralympic Games.Wada says, India accounted for 260 adverse analytical findings (AAFs), reflecting a positivity rate of 3.6 per cent — the highest among all countries that conducted 5,000 or more tests. The Delhi-headquartered National Anti-Doping Agency (Nada) conducted 7,113 tests last year, comprising 6,576 urine samples and 537 blood samples.Of these, 253 urine samples (196 in-competition and 57 out of-competition) returned positive for prohibited substances, while seven blood samples (four in-competition and three out-of-competition) failed the dope test.Nada insisted that the latest figures reflected the anti doping watchdog’s more aggressive testing approach, when a total of 213 cases returned dope positive from 5,606 samples collected in 2023.However, several leading sporting nations recorded far lower positivity rates despite more extensive testing. France tested 11,744 samples and recorded 91 anti-doping rule violations (ADRVs), a 0.8 per cent positivity rate. Russia accounted for 76 ADRVs from 10,514 samples, a 0.7 per cent rate, after leading the global doping charts until 2021. China had just 43 dope failures, with a minimal 0.2 percent positivity rate from 24,214 samples. The US anti-doping agency did a lesser number of tests than India, 6592 in total, and had a positivity rate of 1.1 per cent.The report highlights how deep the menace runs in the Indian sporting culture and again emphasised on the need to have a robust scientific and research system in the country. The figures also highlighted that Indian coaches, doctors and physiotherapists – attached with teams of different disciplines – lack basic knowledge of the use of performance-enhancing supplements and medicines.“While this position may appear concerning at both national and international levels, it is essential to underscore that the figures are a direct outcome of India’s intensified anti-doping efforts, marked by expanded testing and stronger detection mechanisms rather than a surge in doping prevalence,"" stated a statement from Nada as it explained the continued high rate of positivity.In 2025, Nada has said it has so far conducted 7068 tests with a positivity rate of 1.5 per cent after a relatively lower adverse results count of 110.To tackle the doping menace, the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) recently formed a new anti-doping panel while the govt has passed a national anti-doping bill aiming to ensure the highest standards of integrity in sports.","Wada says, India accounted for 260 adverse analytical findings (AAFs), reflecting a positivity rate of 3.6 per cent — the highest among all countries that conducted 5,000 or more tests. The findings emerged on the backdrop of India’s preparations to host the centenary edition of the Commonwealth Games in 2030.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126048910,imgsize-27592,width-400,resizemode-4/doping.jpg"

Prashant Veer's parents react after their son gets a Rs 14.20 crore IPL deal

NEW DELHI: The fourth T20I between India and South Africa never saw a ball bowled on Wednesday night, but it still triggered a fierce debate after senior Congress leader and noted cricket enthusiast Shashi Tharoor took aim at the deteriorating air quality and questioned the decision to host the match in Lucknow.Persistent fog — officially cited as “excessive fog” — enveloped the Bharat Ratna Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee Ekana Cricket Stadium throughout the evening, making play impossible. The toss, scheduled for 6:30 pm IST, was first delayed to 6:50 pm before a series of inspections were conducted. With visibility showing no improvement, umpires finally abandoned the match around 9:30 pm.As players waited through long delays before retreating to the dressing rooms, frustration mounted both inside and outside the stadium. The issue soon spilled onto social media, where Tharoor delivered a sharp critique of the conditions and the Board of Control for Cricket in India’s ( BCCI ) venue selection.“Cricket fans have been waiting in vain for the #INDVSSAODI to start in Lucknow,” Tharoor posted on X. “But thanks to dense smog, pervasive in most north Indian cities, and an AQI of 411, visibility is too poor to permit a game of cricket. They should’ve scheduled the game in Thiruvananthapuram, where AQI is about 68 right now!”Tharoor’s post struck a chord, amplifying concerns about player welfare and fan experience amid hazardous pollution levels. Air quality in Lucknow remained firmly in the danger zone, with PM2.5 levels reportedly more than five times the World Health Organization’s recommended limits. The severity was visible on the field, with Indian all-rounder Hardik Pandya spotted wearing a surgical mask during warm-ups — an image that quickly went viral.A BCCI statement later confirmed the match was abandoned due to unsafe playing conditions caused by fog.

MUMBAI:

Prashant Veer's parents react after their son gets a Rs 14.20 crore IPL deal

It’s not for nothing that they say an IPL gig is often a life-changing event for most players. Onkar Tarmale is another example of the motto of the tournament: When talent meets opportunity. He overcame years of family hardship to secure an Indian Premier League (IPL) contract after Sunrisers Hyderabad bid Rs 30 lakh for the right-arm pacer at the mini auction held at Abu Dhabi on Tuesday.Tarmale, 23, from Shere, Shahapur taluka, a quiet hamlet around 60 kilometres from Mumbai’s entry point, had been able to bowl only two overs during the Sunrisers Hyderabad trials because of the hamstring injury. Despite this, SRH bowling coach Varun Aaron was impressed by his pace and “may have recommended his name to the franchise”.During the trials, he (Aaron) was impressed with the pace I bowled. He told me, “I see something different in you which can be developed. You have the potential.” But unfortunately, I could bowl only two overs before I pulled up my hamstring. As I couldn’t bowl at length, I never expected that SRH would bid for me, but they eventually did,” reveals Tarmale.The bid prompted a night-long celebration in his village, complete with a procession and firecrackers.“More people turned up to celebrate my success than a marriage function. It is a huge thing for our village. Even people from adjoining villages joined in and wished me luck,” Tarmale says.Tarmale has graduated from the university of hard knocks. His father, Tukaram, a small-time farmer, mortgaged gold jewellery and took loans to support his son’s cricketing dream. “My family has sacrificed a lot for me. This is huge for us financially as well. They got very emotional when I got picked up. My father always wanted to see me play in the IPL, and with God’s grace, I have managed to fulfil his dream,” he adds, recalling that he even invoked divine powers by praying at the nearby Hanuman temple when the auction was under way.Tarmale’s cricketing journey, like many others', began with a tennis ball. The switch to a cricket ball happened a bit late, at the age of 18. and that too came about on the advice of his coach. “My coach Narendra Diwane told me that I have the potential to play leather ball cricket. Previously, I used to run in and just bowl fast. He fine-tuned my action and moulded me into a proper pacer,” he says.Tarmale toiled in the dusty maidans of Mumbai playing in the lower divisions often without any recognition or reward. In 2024, A heart to heart with his dad soon followed as he advised Onkar to look for other avenues like “trying for a police job or something else”.Tarmale though is all praise for his father for not forcing his decisions on him.“My father made me aware of the family's financial condition, but he didn’t force the decision on me. They left it to me. They were more worried about my health as daily travel to Mumbai was taking a toll on my health. Deep down I knew that opportunity was just around the corner. I asked them for some more time to crack it. Thankfully, they were convinced. Everyone who was around me cricket wise, knew that I can make it,"" says the pacer who now plays for Sindh SC and BPCL.He adds: “I trained harder, improved my fitness, and got noticed.”Luck smiled on him in the 2025 T20 Mumbai League, when Thane Eagle Strikers picked him after mentor and former Mumbai and India pacer Dhawal Kulkarni noted his potential. “Dhawal Sir spoke to my father about my potential and told him to let me play. After that, my father was convinced, and he has never told me to stop playing thereafter,” Tarmale says.Although he featured in just two matches before a finger fracture, his pace—around 140 kmph, peaking at 145 kmph—caught the eye of scouts and led to his IPL trial. Under Kulkarni’s guidance, Tarmale has added yorkers, wide yorkers, slower balls and slow bouncers to his growing bag of tricks.Following the auction celebrations, Tarmale slept at 4 am on Wednesday and was back at the Mumbai Cricket Association’s BKC facility for an early training session. He described his IPL selection as “just another pit stop” on a journey he intends to pursue with renewed focus.","Onkar Tarmale, 23, from Shahapur taluka, a quiet hamlet around 60 kilometres from Mumbai’s entry point.

LUCKNOW:

Abhishek Sharma's sister is very proud of her brother, and India win

Opening batter and vice-captain Shubman Gill was ruled out of the final T20 International against South Africa after sustaining a toe injury, sources close to the team told TOI. The injury is understood to have occurred during a training session, with the team management “exercising caution” to aid his recovery.According to sources, Gill had an extended batting stint in the nets on the eve of the fourth T20I, during which he was struck on the toe towards the end of the session. He was visibly in pain and struggled to walk thereafter.At this stage, his participation for the final T20I in Ahmedabad is “highly doubtlful”.Gill’s injury could open a window for the team management to assess its bench strength, not just for the Ahmedabad T20 but also with an eye on the five-match T20I series against New Zealand in Jan next year. Also, it could pave the way for players like Yashasvi Jaiswal to get a look-in, while also activating the option of Sanju Samson returning to the opening slot.Gill’s injury comes just when the elegant right-hander seemed to have put a frightening medical scare behind him. While a toe injury might sound innocuous in isolation, for Gill and the Indian management, it is the latest chapter in a worrying saga of physical fragilities that is beginning to cast a long shadow over the team’s preparations for the upcoming T20 World Cup going to be held in India and Sri Lanka from Feb 7 to March 8 next year.The timing of this injury is particularly cruel. Gill had only just returned to the playing XI for the T20I series, featuring in the first three matches after a lay-off.His previous absence was precipitated by a genuinely alarming incident during the first Test against South Africa at Eden Gardens in Kolkata. While attempting a sweep shot, Gill felt a severe discomfort in his neck. He retired hurt immediately.Subsequent medical assessments revealed a disc bulge in his neck that was impinging on a nerve. That injury forced him to miss the second Test in Guwahati and the entire three-match ODI series against the Proteas.Unfortunately, this stop-start narrative has become the defining theme of Gill’s recent career. The past year has seen the prodigious opener spend nearly as much time in the recovery room as he has in the middle.In November 2024, Gill suffered a freak injury during an intra-squad training match at the WACA in Perth. While fielding in the slips, he took a blow that resulted in a hairline fracture on his left thumb, ruling him out of the critical first Test against Australia.Just a month prior, in October 2024, it was his neck that betrayed him again; complaints of stiffness forced him to sit out the first Test against New Zealand in Bengaluru.This recurring pattern — thumb, neck, disc bulge and now a toe — paints a picture of a body struggling to cope with the rigorous demands of all-format international cricket.This inability to stay fit is no longer just a personal heartbreak for Gill, it is evolving into a strategic headache for the Indian team management.A World Cup campaign on home soil demands a settled line-up, and Gill is theoretically a cornerstone of India’s top order. Gill is viewed as the bridge in India’s explosive batting line-up, a player capable of anchoring an innings as well as accelerating at will.However, the concern is that India might head into the mega event with an undercooked top order, or worse, with a key player whose fitness is hanging by a thread.","Shubman Gill ruled out of final T20 International against South Africa with toe injury.

IPL Mini Auction: Manoj Badale, Mahela Jayawardena & Mo Bobat Speak After bidding war

The phone hasn’t stopped ringing at the Fuletra household in Rajkot since Tuesday and the celebrations have continued right since Krains Fuletra’s name came up for bidding at the mini-auction in Abu Dhabi. Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) bought the left arm wrist spinner from Saurashtra at his base price of Rs 30 lakh. The net bowler for SRH in 2025, is set to be part of their main squad for next year’s edition of the IPL.“My family is delighted. This is a dream come true moment for my parents and me. Firecrackers are being burst at Maadiya village, from where we come. We had a farm and my father ran a paan shop there. Here in Rajkot, we celebrated by distributing sweets,” an ecstatic Krains told TOI.Although 14 wickets in seven matches at a strike rate of 27 and an economy rate of 6 in the Men’s U-23 one-dayers and eight wickets from three matches in the ongoing CK Nayudu Trophy aren’t returns that will make heads turn, it is the bowling variety he offers which forced SRH to bet on him.His bowling found a fan in Heinrich Klassen, one of the fiercest and longest hitters of the white ball. In a podcast with former South Africa captain Faf du Plessis, Klassen heaped praise on Krains.“Last year at the IPL, one of our net bowlers was a very tiny left-arm leg spin bowler. He just bowled that size, and he wanted to bowl to me the whole time,"" Klassen had said.“I’ve faced enough left-arm leggies in my life, but I just couldn’t hit him. Every time if you hit one, then next it was slower or went wide. At this stage, I just wanted the ball to come to me. I need to hit you now. I just struggled the whole time,” admitted the South African.Klassen needn’t face Krains anymore, but if the bowler gets his lengths and variations right, opposition batters could find themselves in a spin at IPL 2026.“Left-arm wrist spin comes naturally to him,” Saurashtra U-23 coach Rakesh Dhruv told TOI, “ He flights the ball generously and uses his variations like the flipper and googly very smartly. He deceives batters by altering his length.”",Krains Fuletra is set to be part of Sunrisers Hyderabad's main squad for next year's edition of the IPL.

LUCKNOW:

Franchise boom vs Test cricket: Tom Moody’s honest take

The fourth T20 International between India and South Africa at the Ekana Cricket Stadium in Lucknow on Wednesday never moved beyond anticipation, the game eventually abandoned without a ball being bowled as a dense layer of smog rendered playing conditions unsafe and severely hampered visibility.What began as a delayed toss slowly turned into a familiar, frustrating script for North Indian winter cricket. A thick grey blanket hung over the stadium from late afternoon, visibility steadily deteriorated, and despite six separate inspections spread over more than two hours, the umpires had little room to manoeuvre. KN Ananthapadmanabhan and Rohan Pandit, the two umpires, in consultation with match referee Richie Richardson, finally took the inevitable call.The visuals were telling. Floodlights glowed hazily through the smog, the far end of the ground appeared swallowed by the murk, and fielding from the deep would have bordered on guesswork. In a sport, where split-second reactions define outcomes and fast bowlers operate at high speeds, compromised visibility is not merely inconvenient — it is dangerous.With the Air Quality Index in Lucknow’s Ahimamau area (the locality in which the Ekana Stadium is situated) hovering between 400 and 500 through the evening, the decision to call off the match was unavoidable.Star allrounder Hardik Pandya was seen wearing a surgical mask to counter the pollution while the Indian team warmed up ahead of the game.Yet, while the abandonment itself drew little argument, it once again raised an uncomfortable but pertinent question: why does international cricket continue to be scheduled in North India during a period when weather conditions are so inconducive?From late November through January, venues like Delhi, Lucknow, Dharamshala, Jaipur, Chandigarh and Mohali routinely battle either dense fog, biting cold or hazardous air quality. It is no longer an occasional anomaly; it is an annual certainty.The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has, for years, insisted on spreading matches across regions to ensure equitable access for fans and state associations. That principle, in theory, is sound. In practice, however, it appears increasingly disconnected from on-ground realities. Climate patterns, pollution cycles and winter weather trends are well documented. Scheduling international fixtures in North India during the peak smog season appears to reflect a reluctance to adapt, rather than mere misfortune.Lucknow’s experience on Wednesday fits into a long list of similar disruptions. Domestic cricket offers even starker evidence. Ranji Trophy matches in December are frequently curtailed, delayed or outright abandoned due to fog and poor light in northern centres.Teams often start play late, lose entire sessions or compete in truncated matches that distort competition and outcomes. Players, coaches and match officials privately acknowledge that winter scheduling in these regions is a compromise at best.At the international level, the human cost has been visible. During the Test match against Sri Lanka in Delhi in December 2017, Mohammed Shami was seen vomiting on the field and later complained of chest discomfort while bowling in toxic smog conditions. Several players from both sides wore masks during training, and the match proceeded amid widespread criticism from players’ associations and health experts.A T20I against Bangladesh in Delhi in 2019 was played under similarly alarming air quality, with players clearly uncomfortable and visibility compromised.What makes the situation more puzzling is the availability of alternatives. India boasts world-class stadiums in other regions that are far less affected by winter pollution — Ahmedabad, Mumbai, Chennai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad and even coastal centres like Thiruvananthapuram. These venues offer better air quality, milder winters and far more reliable playing conditions during the same period.Ahmedabad, incidentally, will host the fifth and final T20I of this series on Friday, a reminder that better planning is not just possible but already embedded within the same tour. India currently lead the five-match T20 series 2-1.The abandonment in Lucknow should not be seen as an unfortunate one-off, but as another warning signal. Cricket calendars are planned years in advance, with enough data available to avoid predictable pitfalls.",The fourth T20 International between India and South Africa at the Ekana Cricket Stadium in Lucknow on Wednesday never moved beyond anticipation.

IPL Auction Analysis: Why franchise broke the bank for uncapped Indians

NEW DELHI: The fourth match of the five match T20I series between India and South Africa in Lucknow was abandoned on Wednesday without a single ball being bowled after extremely poor visibility caused by a thick blanket of smog engulfed the Ekana Stadium. The washout has once again triggered debate over the BCCI’s decision to schedule international matches in north Indian cities during the peak winter months.Although the official reason cited was “excessive fog”, conditions inside the stadium told a different story, with smog severely restricting visibility. Air quality levels in Lucknow remained in the hazardous category throughout the day, with the AQI crossing 400, raising fresh concerns over player safety and welfare.The match was scheduled to begin at 7 pm, but repeated inspections made it increasingly clear that conditions were unlikely to improve as the night progressed. Players eventually abandoned their warm-up by 7:30 pm and returned to their dressing rooms, while spectators who had turned up despite the cold slowly began leaving the stadium soon. After a sixth inspection, the game was officially called off at around 9:30 pm.Indian all-rounder Hardik Pandya was seen wearing a surgical mask during the warm-up, underlining the severity of the pollution. BCCI vice-president and Uttar Pradesh Cricket Association strongman Rajeev Shukla also walked out for one of the inspections, though his visible disappointment after speaking with officials reflected the inevitability of the outcome.The abandoned fixture has put the spotlight on the venues chosen for the India-South Africa series, which was spread across cities such as New Chandigarh, Dharamsala, Lucknow, Ranchi, Raipur, Visakhapatnam, Cuttack, Ahmedabad, Guwahati and Kolkata during November and December. This is traditionally the time when pollution levels in cities like Lucknow, New Chandigarh and Dharamsala are at their worst.With no reserve day scheduled, both teams will now head to Ahmedabad for the fifth and final T20I on Friday, with India currently leading the series 2–1.While the BCCI follows a rotational policy when allocating venues, the situation has revived questions about planning. The board could have explored swapping venues with the upcoming white-ball series against New Zealand, which begins on January 11 and will be played largely across western and southern India, including Vadodara, Rajkot, Indore, Nagpur, Raipur, Visakhapatnam and Thiruvananthapuram, with Guwahati the only north-eastern stop.Weather-related disruptions have frequently impacted matches at north zone venues during winter. Just last week, the third T20I in Dharamsala was played in temperatures below 10 degrees Celsius. After that game, India spinner Varun Chakravarthy admitted the conditions were difficult to cope with.“I’ve never played at a ground this cold, so I did find it quite challenging,” he had said.On that day, the AQI in Dharamsala was rated ‘poor’, while New Chandigarh experienced ‘severe’ air quality during the second T20I. The repeated issues have led to questions about whether the BCCI’s operations team adequately factored in historical weather and pollution data, or considered alternative options such as afternoon start times that could have at least ensured play for fans in attendance.","The fourth match of the five match T20I series between India and South Africa in Lucknow was abandoned on Wednesday.

Brief scores:

For the second successive match in the Physical Disability T20 Series at the Wankhede Stadium, opener Wasim Iqbal stood out with the bat. Iqbal slammed an unbeaten 85 off just 45 balls to help India Seniors chase down India A’s target of 143. Iqbal’s fantastic effort was the highlight of the second game of the series on Wednesday.The third and final game of the series will be played on Thursday.After opting to bat, India A posted a modest 143 for 6 in their 20 overs. Jitendra VN (35 not out) and Akash Patil (37 not out) were the stars with the bat as they added an unbroken 57 runs for the seventh wicket. Both came together with their side in a spot of bother at 86 for six. From there on, the pair helped end the innings on a high. For India Seniors, the wickets were shared around.In their response, India Seniors chased down the target with absolute ease thanks to Iqbal’s effort. He smashed an unbeaten 85 off just 45 balls, hitting eight boundaries and five sixes. Iqbal shared a fine 50-run opening stand with Vrushant Gunjal (32 off 18 balls, 4 fours, 2 sixes). From there on, it was a one-way street.India Seniors finally chased down the target in 14.5 overs to finish on 144 for three.Looking back on the experience of the two games so far, India A skipper Majid Margray was thrilled to get a chance to play at the Wankhede Stadium.“It has been an excellent experience. It was always a dream to play at the Wankhede Stadium. From the time I entered, it has been a surreal feeling for me and my team. This is the Lord’s of India and a matter of pride for all of us. To be in the same dressing room where some of our icons and legends of the game have been is a big thing in our lives. All thanks to DCCI and MCA for this initiative. As a group, we have been very excited about the whole experience. We may have lost both our games, but in terms of preparation for the upcoming series, this is the perfect stage for our young talent. Imagine being at the venue and experiencing the dressing room, outfield and the general atmosphere. This has been a life-changing experience,” said Margray, an all-rounder from Anantnag in Kashmir.These sentiments were echoed by rival captain Ravindra Sante as well. The Mumbai-based player was over the moon about the experience.“Being from Mumbai, I have played a few times at Wankhede. I played the President’s Cup final with Vikrant Keni. Both of us were the only differently abled players then. I have also had other experiences here, but this is a different feeling altogether. All thanks to the efforts of DCCI and MCA for giving us this opportunity. I have played in Ahmedabad, Lord’s and Wankhede, and this must be the best feeling for any cricketer. To be at the same venue where India won the 2011 World Cup is a big step up for all of us. We have had a few youngsters ask a lot of questions about the venue, so I have been advising them about picking the ball up from the background because sometimes, when the ball comes parallel to the ground, you can lose it.

The Age

England were weighing up whether to formally approach the match referee over the use of Snickometer technology in Australia after the company supplying the system accepted responsibility for a possible operational mistake on the opening day of the third Ashes Test at the Adelaide Oval.The controversy centred on Australia wicketkeeper batter Alex Carey , who was batting on 72 when he appeared to edge the first delivery of the 63rd over from Josh Tongue . England’s fielders, led by wicketkeeper Jamie Smith, appealed immediately for a catch behind. On-field umpire Ahsan Raza turned the appeal down, prompting England to go upstairs for a review.Replays using Real-Time Snickometer showed a distinct spike, but it appeared several frames before the ball passed the bat. Third umpire Chris Gaffaney explained during the review that the spike occurred “before the bat” and that the ball seemed to have gone “well under” the edge, concluding there was “a clear gap” and no evidence to overturn the decision.Carey went on to make the most of the let-off, adding 34 more runs on his way to a century. After the day’s play, the Australian admitted he believed he had made contact with the ball.“I thought there was a bit of a feather or some sort of noise as it went past the bat,” Carey said.“It looked strange on the replay with the sound coming early. If I’d been given out, I probably would have reviewed it, though not with full confidence. There was a nice sound as it went past.”Carey also made it clear that walking was not part of his approach. “Snicko didn’t line up, did it? That’s cricket sometimes. You need a bit of luck, and maybe it went my way today,” he added.According to ESPNcricinfo, Warren Brennan, founder of BBG Sports, the company responsible for Snickometer in Australian Tests, toldthat an operator error was the likely cause. Brennan said the most plausible explanation was that the wrong stump microphone had been selected for audio processing and confirmed that BBG Sports accepted full responsibility for the mistake.On the field, Australia closed the opening day strongly at 326 for 8 after choosing to bat first. Carey scored 106, while Usman Khawaja contributed 82. For England, Jofra Archer was the standout bowler with figures of 3 for 23, while Brydon Carse and Will Jacks picked up two wickets each. Josh Tongue claimed one scalp.","England weighing up whether to formally approach the match referee over the use of Snickometer technology in Australia.

NEW DELHI: Adelaide Strikers secured a thrilling three-wicket win over Sydney Sixers in the fourth match of the ongoing Big Bash League (BBL) 2025-26 season. Jamie Overton was named Player of the Match for his outstanding all-round performance.With this victory, the Strikers climb to third in the BBL standings with two points, while the Sixers, suffering consecutive defeats, remain at seventh.Batting first, Sydney Sixers posted 159/9 in 20 overs. Babar Azam struggled again, scoring just nine runs off 10 balls, including a four, while wicketkeeper-batter Josh Phillippe top-scored with 46 from 28 deliveries, hitting eight fours and a six. Jack Edwards contributed a fighting 32 off 21 balls, including four boundaries, as the Sixers posted a competitive total. For Adelaide, Luke Wood (3/26), Jamie Overton (2/22), and Lloyd Pope (2/25) shared the wickets.During the chase, Liam Scott smashed 51 off 31 deliveries, including three fours and three sixes. Jamie Overton, after brilliant bowling figures, added 30 runs off 20 balls, including four boundaries, as the Strikers chased down the 160-run target in 19.2 overs.After receiving the Player of the Match award, Overton said the chase felt controlled.""I'd like to think so (if the chase was under control), but those first games of the season, you always just want to get over the line. So it's nice to do that and get our first win on the board. Coming up against these guys is never easy; they're one of the best franchises in the world, so to get the win in the opening game is very satisfying. Yeah, I think it's been around 8 years, so it was great to break that duck. That makes it even more special,"" Overton said.""We felt pretty comfortable at the break (chasing 160). At times it was a bit sloppy - I think we gave away around a dozen extras - and there was some swing early on. So the plan was to play the conditions, get through the start, and then try and take the game on at the back end. Once we did that, it felt like we were mostly in control. Absolutely (enjoying his time). It's my third season here and I love coming back, playing in front of the Adelaide fans and travelling around Australia. It's one of my favourite places in the world, so I'm really enjoying it,"" Overton added.","Adelaide Strikers secured a thrilling three-wicket win over Sydney Sixers.

He wasn't spotted with the rest of the squad during the pre-match routine in Lucknow.""Yes, he injured his toe while batting.

AIFF fined USD 1,000 for delayed restart

Indian football faces administrative paralysis

Amid unprecedented uncertainty in Indian football, the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) on Wednesday handed a triple blow to Mohun Bagan Super Giant, imposing a continental ban and fines totaling USD 100,729 (approximately INR 91 lakh) after the club withdrew from the 2025-26 AFC Champions League Two.The AFC Disciplinary and Ethics Committee ruled that the reigning Indian Super League champions wrongfully withdrew from the competition following their refusal to travel to Iran for a group-stage match against Sepahan SC. Mohun Bagan was handed a one-season ban from AFC competitions.In Decision VVC 20251217DC21, the committee found the Kolkata-based club guilty of breaching Article 5 (Withdrawal from the Competition) of the ACL Two Competition Regulations after failing to fulfil its fixture once the group stage had begun.As part of the sanctions, the Mariners were ""fined USD 50,000,"" ordered to pay ""USD 50,729 as compensation for damages and losses"" claimed by the AFC and Sepahan SC, and ""disqualified from participating in the next AFC club competition for which they would otherwise qualify, with the ban remaining effective up to and including the 2027–28 season.""The committee also ruled that Mohun Bagan would forfeit all subsidies linked to their participation in the 2025-26 ACL Two season, including participation fees, performance bonuses, and travel subsidies.Any amount already paid must be repaid within 30 days.""The compensation shall be paid to the AFC within thirty (30) days of the date that this Decision is communicated,"" the order stated.Terming the decision ""biased,"" a Mohun Bagan official told PTI that the matter is pending at the Lausanne-based Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), and they are ""hoping for a resolution.""""It's a biased decision against our club; our matter is pending at CAS and we're hopeful of a resolution. However, the club may pay up the fines,"" he added.The ruling comes after Mohun Bagan cited player safety concerns, as six foreign players declined the trip to Iran following advisories from their governments. The club had requested a venue change and later approached CAS, but the AFC deemed it a withdrawal, triggering strict disciplinary action. The case mirrors the previous season, when Mohun Bagan similarly did not travel to Iran to face Tractor SC but had escaped sanction.In Decision VVC 20251217DC08, the AFC Disciplinary and Ethics Committee fined the All India Football Federation (AIFF) USD 1,000 for delaying the restart of the second half during India’s AFC Asian Cup 2027 final-round qualifier against Bangladesh on November 18, 2025.The committee found that AIFF representatives caused a delay of one minute and 43 seconds in commencing the second half, breaching Article 2 (Official Countdown) of the AFC Competitions Operations Manual. The AIFF was ordered to settle the fine within 30 days, under Article 11.3 of the AFC Disciplinary and Ethics Code.In another ruling (VVC 20251217DC19), the AFC fined FC Goa USD 5,000 for failing to ensure stadium safety during their ACL Two group-stage match against Saudi Arabia’s Al Nassr on October 22.The committee found the club violated Article 64 (Organization of Matches) of the AFC Disciplinary and Ethics Code after a spectator invaded the area surrounding the field of play. The ruling noted that FC Goa failed to fully comply with safety regulations and did not take all precautions required to maintain law and order. The fine must be paid within 30 days of communication.The AFC’s disciplinary actions come at a time when Indian football is grappling with deep structural and administrative uncertainty. The domestic season remains in limbo, with no confirmation on the ISL, I-League, or I-League 2 following the expiry of the 15-year agreement between Football Sports Development Limited (FSDL) and the AIFF on December 8.The ISL usually starts in September, while the I-League was scheduled to begin on October 19. With the impasse continuing, the Union Sports Ministry, led by Minister of Youth Affairs and Sports Dr Mansukh Mandaviya, has stepped in to hold meetings with all stakeholders to prevent a complete collapse of the domestic calendar.A proposed resolution is expected within the next week, as officials race against time amid fears that India could go without a men’s domestic league season for the first time since 1996—a scenario that would further damage the country’s standing in Asian football.","Mohun Bagan handed a continental ban and fines totaling USD 100,729 (approximately INR 91 lakh) The Kolkata-based club withdrew from the 2025-26 AFC Champions League Two.

Manchester United and Bournemouth played out a thrilling 4-4 draw at Old Trafford, with United squandering the lead three times and missing the chance to move up to fifth in the Premier League. Despite United's strong attacking display under Ruben Amorim's management, their defensive vulnerabilities were exposed as Bournemouth repeatedly fought back to secure a point.Amad Diallo opened the scoring for United in the 13th minute, nodding into an empty net after Petrovic failed to properly handle Cunha's header. The hosts displayed their best attacking form of the season but struggled defensively without injured defenders Harry Maguire and Matthijs de Ligt.Antoine Semenyo equalized for Bournemouth against the run of play in the 40th minute, taking advantage of Luke Shaw's weakness to score his first goal since October 3. United regained the lead before halftime through Casemiro's header from a Fernandes corner, aided by a goalkeeping error from Petrovic.The second half saw Bournemouth score twice in seven minutes through Evanilson and Marcus Tavernier. Evanilson struck just 37 seconds after the restart, while Tavernier converted a free-kick from the edge of the area.United maintained their record of not losing a home league game when leading at half-time since May 1984, as Bruno Fernandes scored from a brilliant free-kick and Matheus Cunha capitalized on Adam Smith's defensive error to make it 4-3.Eli Junior Kroupi leveled the score for Bournemouth with six minutes remaining. The visitors nearly claimed victory in stoppage time, but United goalkeeper Senne Lammens denied David Brooks twice.""It was a fun game for everyone at home,"" said Amorim. ""When you win away you should win at home. The performance today was different from the last two at home. The result is the same, it is frustrating but the performance is different.""""It's very difficult to explain because so much happened,"" said Bournemouth manager Andoni Iraola. ""I suppose it was entertaining for everyone. Two teams that attacked much better than we defended.""The result extends Bournemouth's winless run to seven games but moves them up to 13th place. United climb to sixth place, ahead of Liverpool on goal difference.This draw continues United's recent struggles at home, following their failure to defeat 10-man Everton and West Ham in previous matches.The match highlighted United's improving attack under Amorim's leadership, with their expensive forward line showing promising signs despite defensive shortcomings.Mbeumo missed a clear opportunity from close range during the second half, while Petrovic made an uncertain save from Cunha's powerful shot as both teams continued to create chances throughout the match.",Manchester United and Bournemouth played out a thrilling 4-4 draw at Old Trafford.

NEW DELHI:

Fans throw objects, vandalise stadium after Messi leaves early | Hyderabad next

It’s time for reels, memes and thrills. Finally, Lionel Messi graced the Capital with his friends, Luis Suarez and Rodrigo de Paul, and entertained a 30,000 odd gathering of the city’s elite fans at the sun-soaked Arun Jaitley Stadium on Monday.The next most-popular word the city is breathing these days, AQI, hovered around 451 which is marked severe. Braving the unhealthy air, parents escorted their children to catch a glimpse of the Argentinian superstar, who glided into the stadium at half past four in the afternoon, wrapped in a cloud of security personnel. Thankfully, they weren’t over bearing. They allowed the three musketeers from Inter Miami, the MLS Cup winners in football in the US, to take a lap of honour, kick around two dozen footballs into the crowd that went delirious, and enjoy a kickabout with kids. Perhaps, no one alerted them about the Delhi air.Divyansh and Manik travelled all the way from Ludhiana and managed to catch one of the balls that landed in the terraces. They walked out clutching it like a baby. “Cannot frame words to how happy we are,” breathless, they could barely blurt.Academy boys and girls, who got the opportunity to pass the ball to Messi, would remember forever the late afternoon of delight. Something they will share with their grandchildren some 60 years on.The delegates and the fortunate ones who managed a close look at the football legend in a pink tee, were starstruck. Messi, too, regaled them with his boyish grin. Never for a moment, since he landed in Kolkata on Saturday, did the smile leave his face.The unseemly Kolkata incident seemed a distant memory. On Saturday, irate fans ripped up seats and invaded the Salt Lake Stadium pitch after feeling duped by poor organisation where they could barely get a glimpse of the eight-times Ballon d’Or winner despite paying a bomb for tickets. Events in Hyderabad and Mumbai followed without any sore points and the Capital proved no different.However, two serious Messi fans did point out, “The organisers could have arranged something for the kids on the ground rather than keep them waiting for two hours.”Messi’s arrival was delayed by an hour, but one can guess that the children won’t complain.What followed was a photo session with the Delhi chief minister Rekha Gupta and chairman of the International Cricket Council (ICC) Jay Shah. Shah presented Messi, Suarez and de Paul with T20 World Cup tickets, a cricket bat, and Indian team jerseys.Former India captain Bhaichung Bhutia also shared the stage with the trio and former India goalkeeper, Aditi Chauhan, got her jersey signed by Inter Miami mates.Ranked 142, India’s struggles on and off the football pitch were a constant source of comparison as Messi walked the stadium waving at the fans. Does he know the dark state of Indian football where the leagues cannot start because there is no one willing to sponsor it? Unlikely. A score or more miles away, across town, the Football House wears a desolate look, frustrated by court hearings and paucity of funds.Dusk descended gently on the stadium. Messi took over the microphone and served the parting shot. “It was beautiful to receive all the love and support. I knew it was there, but to receive it first hand was, well, amazing,” Messi told the crowd, in Spanish. “I will definitely be back.” The crowd cheered, grasping the essence of the words even though the language was alien.Messi spoke the language of football. Everyone present understood it — one and all.","Lionel Messi entertained a 30,000 odd gathering of the city's elite fans at the sun-soaked Arun Jaitley Stadium on Monday.

Delhi’s worsening air quality cast a shadow over Lionel Messi ’s farewell appearance in India, as a section of the crowd at the Arun Jaitley Stadium voiced its anger at the political leadership even while welcoming the global football icon.As Chief Minister Rekha Gupta stepped onto the stage on Monday to receive Messi during the final leg of the GOAT India Tour, chants of “AQI, AQI” rang out from parts of the stands. The reaction came amid hazardous pollution levels in the national capital, with the Air Quality Index touching 498 in the morning before easing slightly to 427 by evening, remaining in the ‘severe’ category for the third consecutive day. Visibility across the city dropped sharply, with a thick haze obscuring the skyline.The chants contrasted sharply with the celebratory atmosphere inside the stadium, where nearly 25,000 fans had gathered to catch a glimpse of Messi. The Delhi leg marked the conclusion of a tour that had begun chaotically in Kolkata but ended on a more organised note in the capital. Spectators packed the stands, many wearing Argentina’s blue and white jersey with the iconic No. 10, while celebrities and dignitaries watched from inside the ground.Messi, speaking briefly in Spanish, thanked the crowd for the affection shown throughout his India visit. He described the experience as intense but unforgettable, saying the love he received exceeded expectations and promising that he would return to India someday, possibly to play a match.After arriving at the stadium, Messi walked around the field smiling, watched the 7x7 celebrity match conclude, and waved repeatedly to the crowd. Alongside Inter Miami teammates Luis Suarez and Rodrigo De Paul, he kicked footballs into the stands during a lap of honour and later felicitated the Minerva Academy football team. The reception was notably freer than in Kolkata, where heavy security and political entourages had limited fan interaction.The tightly scripted 30-minute programme revolved largely around Messi. He was joined on stage by Rekha Gupta, ICC chairman Jay Shah , DDCA president Rohan Jaitley and former India football captain Bhaichung Bhutia towards the end of the event.While Messi mania dominated the evening, the chants inside the stadium underlined a growing public frustration over Delhi’s air crisis, turning a celebratory sporting moment into a pointed reminder of the capital’s ongoing environmental emergency.",Delhi's worsening air quality cast a shadow over Lionel Messi’s farewell appearance in India.

Lionel Messi India tour: Inside story of what went wrong in Kolkata

NEW DELHI: The footballing god descended upon the city, and the Lionel Messi GOAT India Tour, which had begun in disorder, found its finish in Delhi at the Arun Jaitley Stadium, where fans gathered to see a player whose actions on the field often defy explanation. What mattered most was that the tour ended the way it was meant to, after a chaotic opening in Kolkata on Saturday.The stands at the stadium were filled with spectators, while a small group of Indian celebrities and dignitaries watched from inside the ground, as the city played host to one of the world’s most recognisable athletes. For many, it was the chance to be close to a figure who has shaped the sport over the last two decades.Messi spoke briefly in Spanish, a language unfamiliar to most in the crowd, saying, ""Gracias Delhi! Hasta pronto"", a moment that drew a loud cheer from the stands.Addressing the crowd in Spanish, Messi said, ""Thank you for all the affection you have shown us here in India over these days. Truly, it was a unique experience for us to be able to share this. Although it was intense and very short, it was wonderful to receive all this love, which I already knew was there, but experiencing it firsthand was incredible.""He added, ""Everything you did for us over these days was astonishing, pure madness. So thank you all for the love, and we will surely return someday — perhaps to play a match or on some other occasion — but we will definitely visit again. Thank you very much, thank you.""After arriving at the stadium, Messi walked around the ground smiling and watched the 7x7 celebrity match conclude, as spectators — many wearing Argentina’s blue and white jersey with No. 10 — chanted his name. He stood waving to the crowd, something he could not do in Kolkata, where he had been surrounded by politicians and their aides at the Salt Lake Stadium.Messi was later seen kicking the ball towards the stands along with Inter Miami teammates Luis Suarez and Rodrigo De Paul while taking a round of the stadium, which recorded an attendance of around 25,000. He also felicitated the Minerva Academy football team.The programme appeared designed around Messi, and he moved through it smoothly. Delhi chief minister Rekha Gupta, ICC Chairman Jay Shah, DDCA president Rohan Jaitley and former India football captain Bhaichung Bhutia were present with him towards the end of the 30-minute event.Earlier in the day, Messi arrived in Delhi for the final leg of the GOAT India Tour after his flight from Mumbai was delayed due to weather conditions. He was scheduled to land around 10:45am, but fog delayed his charter flight. He eventually landed at Indira Gandhi International Airport at around 2:30pm and proceeded to the Leela Palace Hotel for a meet-and-greet with a select group of people.","Messi arrived in Delhi for the final leg of the GOAT India Tour after his flight from Mumbai was delayed due to weather conditions.

He headed straight to The Leela Palace Hotel for a one-hour meet-and-greet with a select group of guests.The GOAT Tour had earlier faced organisational challenges in Kolkata, where a massive turnout at Salt Lake Stadium led to frustration due to poor crowd management. In Hyderabad, Messi engaged in a number of fan-friendly activities, including playing with children, taking photos, and waving from the VIP box during a club match at Uppal Stadium.Before reaching Delhi, Messi spent the evening in Mumbai, interacting with cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar , Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, current and former Indian footballers, as well as film stars, celebrities, and politicians at the Wankhede Stadium, creating another memorable moment of his India tour.","Messi presented with India vs USA Men’s T20 World Cup 2026 tickets by ICC chairman Jay Shah.

Philadelphia Eagles rookie Cooper DeJean and Nikki Bella spark offseason curiosity after a locker room photo surfaces,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/eagles-rookie-cooper-dejean-and-nikki-bella-spark-offseason-curiosity-after-a-locker-room-photo-surfaces/articleshow/126049557.cms,"Cooper DeJean and Nicki Bella (Image via: IG/Getty)

The offseason curiosity began with a locker room photo and grew after a brief RAW comment

Wrestling star Nikki Bella and Philadelphia Eagles rookie Cooper DeJean became an unexpected offseason talking point after a quiet moment at training camp began circulating online. A photo taken inside DeJean’s locker room showed the two standing together, relaxed and casual, without any public explanation attached. The image did not come with context, but the setting alone drew attention. Locker rooms are personal spaces, and appearances by celebrities inside them are rare enough to invite questions.As the photo moved across social media, fans focused less on what was shown and more on what was missing. There was no caption spelling out the reason for Bella’s presence. There was no follow-up post from either side. In the slower stretch of the NFL calendar, that absence of detail allowed curiosity to grow naturally rather than being pushed.The moment gained added traction after a comment made on WWE RAW in Philadelphia. During the show, WWE star Grayson Waller casually revealed why DeJean was in attendance. “DeJean went to RAW in Philly because he wanted to see Bella,” Waller said. The line was brief, but it quickly connected the dots for fans who had already noticed the locker room photo.Since joining the Eagles, the rookie cornerback has kept his focus firmly on football.Training camp has been about learning the system, earning trust, and adjusting to the pace of the league. Personal headlines have not followed him so far, which made this crossover moment stand out even more.Bella’s presence, meanwhile, naturally brings visibility. A longtime WWE star with a broad fan base, her appearances often spark conversation without effort. Still, she has not commented on the photo or addressed the speculation that followed. There has been no confirmation of why she visited Eagles camp or how the interaction came about.At this point, the facts remain simple. A photo was taken. A comment was made on RAW. Everything else lives in interpretation. Neither DeJean nor Bella has offered clarification, and until that happens, the situation remains firmly in the realm of observation rather than assumption.In an offseason where storylines are scarce, even a single image can linger longer than expected. Whether the moment fades quietly or gains further context will depend on whether either side chooses to speak. Until then, it stands as one of the more unexpected intersections of sports and entertainment this summer.Also read: Chiefs’ heiress Gracie Hunt shared a quiet Christmas Story that instantly caught fans’ attention for its message","Wrestling star Nikki Bella and Philadelphia Eagles rookie Cooper DeJean became an unexpected offseason talking point.

How Ring doorbell footage exposed Bill Belichick’s secret Airbnb meetings with Jordon Hudson and who leaked it,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/how-ring-doorbell-footage-exposed-bill-belichicks-secret-airbnb-meetings-with-jordon-hudson-and-who-leaked-it/articleshow/126049075.cms,"The real story behind shock Ring footage of Bill Belichick and Jordon Hudson (Getty Images)

Bill Belichick Ring doorbell footage mystery unraveled



Bill Belichick rarely loses control of a narrative. Yet a grainy doorbell clip flipped the script, turning a private moment into public curiosity. The video, showing the legendary coach shirtless outside a quiet New England home, refused to fade. It resurfaced just as whispers about his relationship with Jordon Hudson grew louder, and suddenly the internet had a mystery to solve. Who owned the house. Why was he there. And how did a routine security camera capture a viral moment tied to one of football’s most guarded figures.As new reporting surfaced, the story shifted from gossip to something stranger and more revealing. What looked like a personal slip became a lesson in how easily privacy cracks in the digital age. Behind the clip were stunned homeowners, a rented Airbnb , and an unlikely online detective trail that pulled the curtain back further than anyone expected.The home was not Hudson’s at all. According to Pablo Torre, it was an Airbnb in Winthrop, Massachusetts, owned by a couple who woke up confused and uneasy. On Torre’s show, the woman, who chose to remain anonymous, recalled their first reaction.""We saw the Ring video in the morning, not knowing who this was,"" the woman said, ""but it was an older gentleman with a very young woman who checked in the night before.""Her husband jumped in, explaining the alarm bells that rang before recognition set in.""She’s said, ‘She’s with this creepy old guy.' She thought her relative or a drug dealer was the first thing because of the age discrepancy. Remember you went, ‘Must be a freaking coke dealer.’ I was like, ‘What? Come on.""So that was her first reaction. And then I start looking [and] I’m like, ‘That does look like Belichick!’""The couple confirmed Hudson booked the stay and even shared a strange but harmless exchange about golf equipment.""I didn't think anything of it at the time,"" the woman said.What followed pushed the story beyond the clip. Torre revealed he relied on a GeoGuessr expert to pinpoint the location, describing the process on Vice TV.""It wasn't easy,"" he said. ""The only thing I could think of was those GeoGuessr guys.""""‘I get the coordinates from Rainbolt: Winthrop, Massachusetts,’"" Torre added, explaining how public listings led him to the exact rental.As Belichick and Hudson made their relationship public, tension followed. Hudson later accused Torre of “factually incorrect, slanderous, defamatory and targeted” reporting, especially after claims about her access to the University of North Carolina football facilities were denied by the school.The documentary Out of Bounds deepens the intrigue, spotlighting Hudson’s strained interactions with media figures and her growing influence around Belichick. One quote from podcaster Charlotte Wilder captures the unease.""It's been pretty wild to watch... [she] does literally the opposite of what any PR expert would advise you to do.""A shirtless clip may have sparked the attention, but the aftermath shows how quickly a fleeting moment can reshape reputations, invite scrutiny, and refuse to stay private.Also Read: Myles Garrett’s viral kiss with Chloe Kim leaves her dad hilariously cringing as Browns star chases history","Ring doorbell video shows Bill Belichick shirtless outside New England home.

Myles Garrett balances NFL history chase with a viral personal moment



Cleveland Browns fans have learned to live in two realities at once this season. Sundays bring flashes of dominance from Myles Garrett, even as losses pile up around him. At 3-11, the Browns are playing out the string, yet Garrett is still chasing history with the same fury he shows every snap. One more sack would place him alongside the greatest single-season pass rushers the league has ever seen. In a year filled with frustration, his pursuit of 22.5 sacks has become must-watch theater.Away from the field, Garrett’s name is buzzing for a very different reason. A brief moment caught on camera during a November game turned into an unexpected viral hit. It was not about strength or speed, but about timing, family, and a reaction that said far more than words ever could.At 29, Garrett remains the clear heartbeat of Cleveland’s defense and one of the NFL’s most feared defensive ends. He already owns a Defensive Player of the Year award from 2023 and could earn another nod if he breaks the single-season sack record currently shared by Michael Strahan and T.J. Watt. With three games left, every snap feels heavier, every pressure louder. For a struggling Browns team, Garrett’s brilliance has been the rare constant.Off the field, his life has taken on a new spotlight through his relationship with Chloe Kim. The two-time Olympic gold medalist snowboarder and Garrett were first linked in March after appearing together at the Crunchyroll Anime Awards in Tokyo. Since then, they have embraced the public eye in small, playful ways, including an adorable race across a football field that fans loved.During the November 25 matchup against the Cincinnati Bengals, Kim was in the stands with her family, cheering Garrett on. After a big moment, the couple shared a quick kiss. That might have been the end of it, but the camera drifted to Kim’s father, Jong Jin Kim. His reaction was instant and unforgettable. He turned away, placed his hand on his forehead, and shook his head. The clip exploded online.The moment struck a chord because of cultural context. Kim is Korean American, born in Long Beach and raised in Torrance, with parents who emigrated from South Korea. In traditional Korean culture, public displays of affection are often discouraged, especially in front of elders. That lens made the reaction both relatable and hilarious for many viewers.Garrett, standing 6-foot-4 and over 270 pounds, towers over Kim, who is 5-foot-3. Yet in that viral second, the NFL star chasing history felt like any other boyfriend navigating family dynamics. As Garrett closes in on a record and Kim’s legacy as a back-to-back Olympic champion continues to inspire, this small, human moment reminded fans why sports stories resonate beyond the scoreboard.Also Read: Philip Rivers appears to have outsmarted the NFL with a Colts return that unlocked huge insurance money","Cleveland Browns defensive end Myles Garrett has 22.5 sacks this season.

Puka Nacua blames Taylor Swift for Chiefs’ struggle as Rams prepare for defining NFC West showdown



For nearly a decade, the Kansas City Chiefs carried an aura that bent logic. Slow starts never mattered. Injuries felt temporary. Even flawed seasons ended with confetti or at least a deep January run. That belief finally cracked this year. An offense that once struck fear stalled at key moments, close games slipped away, and the margin for magic disappeared. When a late loss sealed their fate, the Chiefs were eliminated from playoff contention before Christmas, an unfamiliar and jarring reality.The ending felt abrupt and heavy. Patrick Mahomes, the engine of the franchise, suffered the first season-ending injury of his career on a fourth-quarter scramble. The defeat shifted the conversation from postseason plans to rehab schedules, roster questions, and hard reflections. For the first time in years, inevitability no longer followed Kansas City. The dynasty aura faded, leaving space for outside voices to fill the silence.One of those voices came from an unexpected place. As the Los Angeles Rams locked in for a monster Thursday night clash against the Seattle Seahawks, wide receiver Puka Nacua went viral during a casual live stream.The timing raised eyebrows. With the Rams fighting for the NFC West crown, their rising star drifted into commentary far removed from route trees and coverage reads.Nacua touched on several topics, some lighthearted, others reckless. He jabbed at the Chargers, vented about officiating, and wandered into humor that missed the mark. Then came the remark that lit up social media, tying Kansas City’s collapse to pop culture rather than personnel or play calling.Rams star WR Puka Nacua blames Taylor Swift's relationship with Travis Kelce as the main reason the Chiefs missed the playoffs this season.""It's got to be the Swift curse. After they ran out of the little bit of juice.""The line spread fast, not because it offered insight, but because it collided celebrity, football, and frustration. For a franchise accustomed to being untouchable, the Chiefs suddenly became a punchline. Yet inside league circles, the reasons were far more grounded. Injuries piled up. Margins shrank. The safety net that once caught every stumble was gone.Back in Los Angeles, the Rams moved quickly to quiet the noise. Sean McVay and the organization shut down further distractions, reinforcing that nothing outside the facility helps them beat Seattle. Nacua remains central to the game plan, not for his words, but for his production.As kickoff approaches, the contrast is sharp. Kansas City faces an uncertain offseason. The Rams face a defining night. For Nacua, the next statement that matters will come under the lights, with the ball in his hands.Also Read: How Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce protect their relationship and prioritize ""alone time"" during an intense, ""demanding"" year","Rams star Puka Nacua blames Taylor Swift's relationship with Travis Kelce as the main reason the Chiefs missed the playoffs this season.

Munn previously addressed being unfairly blamed for Rodgers’ family rift and career struggles. Her experience has fueled speculation that Rodgers’ extreme privacy is a deliberate effort to shield his wife from similar public scrutiny.

Olivia Munn’s resurfaced comments shed light on scrutiny Aaron Rodgers may be avoiding

Aaron Rodgers is once again dominating headlines, but this time the spotlight extends beyond football. While the veteran quarterback recently returned to the field as the Pittsburgh Steelers’ starter, public fascination has shifted toward his intensely private personal life. Rodgers’ quiet marriage to a woman named Brittani, whose face, background, and even last name remain undisclosed, has sparked widespread curiosity.As fans speculate about why the NFL star chose secrecy over celebration, old comments from his former girlfriend, actress Olivia Munn, have resurfaced, adding emotional context to the discussion. Her reflections offer a glimpse into the toll public narratives can take, raising questions about whether Rodgers’ privacy-first approach is rooted in lessons learned from the past.Olivia Munn’s past remarks have gained renewed attention as debates swirl around Rodgers’ hidden marriage. During a June 2025 appearance on Armchair Expert, Munn addressed long-standing rumors that blamed her for Rodgers’ estrangement from his family during their 2014–2017 relationship.She firmly rejected that narrative, saying: ""There's this whole big narrative that stayed with me for so many years. But there was just this dynamic in the family that had nothing to do with me.They didn't speak for months before we started dating.""Munn also revealed that she actively encouraged Rodgers to repair those relationships. Her account was later validated when Rodgers himself acknowledged in a 2024 biography that she had “nothing to do with all the years” of family tension.Beyond personal blame, Munn expressed frustration over receiving no acknowledgment for her behind-the-scenes support during some of Rodgers’ most successful seasons: ""During the time that I was with him, he had three Hail Marys, I think two NFC championships, not wins, but he made it into the NFC championship, which is very hard…No one would want to talk about that. I didn't get credit for any of the wins.""Against that backdrop, Rodgers’ decision to keep Brittani completely out of public view feels intentional. He confirmed in mid-2025 that they married privately and explained that she did not choose a life in the spotlight. As he put it on The Pat McAfee Show: ""If and when she wants to be out and there's a picture, she'll choose that.""For many observers, the contrast between past public scrutiny and present secrecy suggests growth, not mystery, an effort to protect love from becoming collateral damage in the court of public opinion.Also Read: Aaron Rodgers’ dating history: Everyone the NFL star has been linked with",Olivia Munn’s resurfaced comments shed light on scrutiny Aaron Rodgers may be avoiding.

Lane Kiffin and a family moment unfolding between campuses



Lane Kiffin’s December looks different this year. While the new LSU Tigers coach is settling into Baton Rouge and tying up responsibilities before the holidays, his family story continues to unfold in parallel, miles away and very much in the public eye. College football fans have followed his career moves for years, but lately, attention has shifted beyond the sidelines. This chapter blends ambition, reconciliation, and a family rediscovering its rhythm under bright lights.Away from Louisiana, Layla Kiffin has been writing her own narrative. Southern California has once again become her backdrop, and she has not faded into the background. Her presence, confidence, and sense of style have drawn notice all season, turning routine appearances into moments that travel fast across social feeds. It is not about headlines chasing fashion. It is about visibility, timing, and a family adjusting to change without losing its spark.Lane and Layla Kiffin’s reunion after years apart has added a deeply human layer to an already high profile career shift. Divorced since 2016 after 12 years of marriage, they found their way back to each other during a season filled with travel, pressure, and public scrutiny. Layla became a familiar sight at Ole Miss Rebels games, earning praise for bold looks that matched the energy of fall Saturdays.From denim statements in Oklahoma to an all white look alongside daughter Landry, her appearances felt intentional and confident.That visibility did not stop when Lane accepted the LSU job. Layla and Landry continued to turn heads even as Lane stepped into his new role and faced the cameras at his introductory press conference. The family bond remained front and center. Recently, all eyes landed on Landry’s 21st birthday, where Lane joined Layla and their three children, Landry, Presley, and Knox. The celebration hinted at a quick return to Oxford, Mississippi, showing that family time still finds space amid a demanding schedule.Layla later returned to Manhattan Beach, California, where the family spent last Christmas. Lane is expected to join them when his schedule allows. Before that reunion, Layla shared another standout moment, posing in a sleeveless black outfit with fellow “mamas” at a holiday party. It was effortless and striking, the kind of image that reinforces her growing presence.As the holidays approach, the Kiffin household appears poised for balance. Lane handles the weight of expectations in Baton Rouge. Layla continues to shine wherever she lands. Together, their story blends football, family, and a renewed sense of unity, with Layla’s sparkle often stealing the scene.Also Read: How Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce protect their relationship and prioritize ""alone time"" during an intense, ""demanding"" year","Lane and Layla Kiffin’s reunion after years apart has added a deeply human layer to an already high profile career shift.

Followers who had grown used to seeing Diggs regularly pop up in Cardi B’s comments section are now questioning his sudden absence.The timing, tone, and contrast between Cardi’s recent posts and her earlier content have only fueled speculation. While neither Diggs nor Cardi has publicly addressed the shift, the online silence has been loud enough to keep fans talking and scrolling for clues.Throughout late November and early December, Diggs appeared fully tuned into Cardi B’s Instagram presence. He frequently reacted to her glamorous photos and videos, often commenting on multiple consecutive posts.ID@undefinedCaption not available.Fans noticed that the pattern became especially consistent starting December 7, when Cardi began sharing a series of highly styled, eye-catching looks. Diggs was a familiar presence, leaving enthusiastic reactions that many interpreted as public support and admiration.That streak, however, abruptly ended around December 13. Cardi’s content shifted from glammed-up appearances to more personal moments, including fitness clips filmed in a hijab and abaya and a makeup-free video documenting her return home to crying babies after her Saudi Arabia trip. Notably, Diggs did not appear in the comments on either post, breaking what had become a daily routine for observant fans.The contrast stood out even more given Cardi’s busy schedule in Riyadh, where she performed at the MDLBEAST Soundstorm Festival from December 11 to 13. In one clip from her pre-tour preparations, she said, “We in Saudi Arabia, baby. I told you, after giving birth I gotta get ready for the Little Miss Drama Tour. It is two months away,” reinforcing her focus on work and recovery.ID@undefinedCaption not available.As of now, Diggs has remained silent about the change, leaving fans to draw their own conclusions. Meanwhile, Cardi B is moving forward professionally, preparing for her Little Miss Drama Tour, set to run from February through April in support of her latest album, Am I the Drama?. Whether the social media pause means anything deeper remains unclear, but the internet, as always, is watching closely.Also Read: Cardi B goes all-in on Patriots fandom as Stefon Diggs’ playoff push turns her into an unlikely NFL diehard","Stefon Diggs’ sudden silence on Cardi B’s Instagram sparks fresh speculation among fans.

A new chapter with Brittani

Aaron Rodgers has built a Hall of Fame résumé on the football field, but his personal life has often attracted just as much attention. Known for guarding his privacy fiercely, the former Green Bay Packers quarterback, now one of the NFL’s most talked-about veterans, has still found himself linked with several high-profile names over the years. From Hollywood actresses to sports icons, Rodgers’ dating history reflects both his fame and his evolving outlook on relationships.One of the earliest names connected to Rodgers was actress Jessica Szohr in 2011. The relationship was never formally confirmed, but the two were spotted together multiple times and reportedly reconnected briefly in 2014. While it stayed largely out of the public eye, it marked the beginning of Rodgers’ association with celebrity dating.Rodgers’ most prominent early relationship came with actress Olivia Munn, whom he dated from 2014 to 2017. The couple frequently appeared together at events, and Munn was a regular presence at Packers games. During this period, Rodgers openly discussed the challenges of maintaining a relationship under constant scrutiny. Their three-year relationship ended amid widespread speculation, something Rodgers later said reinforced his discomfort with public attention on his personal life.In 2018, Rodgers began dating former NASCAR star Danica Patrick, a relationship that lasted over two years. The pairing brought together two elite athletes from different sports and was heavily documented on social media. Rodgers credited Patrick with influencing his interest in mindfulness and personal growth. However, the relationship ended in mid-2020, with Patrick later describing the breakup as emotionally difficult.Perhaps the most unexpected chapter in Rodgers’ dating history involved actress Shailene Woodley. The two began dating in late 2020 and announced their engagement in early 2021, catching fans by surprise. Both spoke publicly about their deep connection, but the engagement was short-lived. By April 2022, the couple had split, with reports suggesting differences in lifestyle and priorities played a role.Following his breakup with Woodley, Rodgers was briefly linked to Mallory Edens, a model and the daughter of Milwaukee Bucks co-owner Wes Edens. The relationship was described as casual and low-key, aligning with Rodgers’ desire to keep his personal life out of headlines.In late 2024, Rodgers confirmed he was in a serious relationship with a woman named Brittani, deliberately sharing very few details. He later revealed that she does not use social media, signaling a conscious shift toward privacy. By 2025, Rodgers described the relationship as an important part of his life, emphasizing personal commitments beyond football.As Aaron Rodgers’ career winds through its later stages, his dating history mirrors a broader evolution: from high-profile celebrity romances to a more guarded, intentional approach to relationships. While fans may remain curious, Rodgers has made it clear that this chapter of his life is one he intends to keep mostly his own.","Aaron Rodgers has been linked with several high-profile names over the years.

Taylor Swift’s viral male AI look sparks unexpected Joe Alwyn comparisons

The internet’s obsession with celebrity AI transformations has found a new muse in Taylor Swift, and the reaction has been louder and more emotional than most fans expected. After gender-swapped images of Kendall Jenner and Hailey Bieber dominated timelines, Swift’s AI-generated “male version” ignited a fresh wave of commentary that quickly drifted from novelty into nostalgia.What began as a playful TikTok trend soon turned into a deep dive into Swift’s past, with fans drawing striking comparisons to her former partner Joe Alwyn. The viral moment underscores how Swift’s personal history, lyrics, and relationships remain tightly woven into fan culture, even when the trigger is an algorithm-generated image.A TikTok video shared by user @helenajessica showcased multiple AI-generated images reimagining Swift as a man, and viewers immediately fixated on the resemblance. Comments flooded in, with fans exclaiming, “Yeah she looks exactly like joe!” while others echoed, “Wait a minute – [crying emoji] joe?” and “Why does she look like Joe a little bit [crying emojis].”The reactions weren’t just about physical similarity, they reopened conversations about Swift’s longest relationship, her nearly six-year romance with actor Joe Alwyn that ended in 2023. For many fans, the AI images acted like a visual time capsule, pulling memories of that era back into focus.One lyric resurfaced repeatedly in the comments, especially from Call It What You Want, where Swift sings, “Trust him like a brother,” a line fans still associate closely with Alwyn.What makes the moment more fascinating is its timing. Swift is now engaged to NFL star Travis Kelce after two years of dating, firmly in a new chapter of her life. Yet the viral comparison shows how quickly the internet can pivot backward, even when an artist has clearly moved on.Beyond Alwyn, fans also tossed out playful comparisons to male celebrities like Austin Butler and Alex Pettyfer, with one jokingly suggesting Vecna from Stranger Things. The trend highlights a broader reality: AI-driven pop culture moments aren’t just about technology, they’re mirrors reflecting how deeply fans remain invested in Swift’s evolving story.Also Read: Could Blake Lively make a surprise appearance with Travis Kelce in Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour documentary?

Spin-heavy teams in Asia — smart move or risk? Paul Adams answers

Poll What should be PCB's priority in this situation? Support Bangladesh's cause. Prioritize Pakistan's cricket interests. Maintain harmony with the ICC. Balance both sides carefully.

NEW DELHI: Former Pakistan cricketers and ex-board officials have cautioned the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) against boycotting the upcoming ICC Men’s T20 World Cup in solidarity with Bangladesh, warning that such a move could damage Pakistan cricket and strain relations with the world governing body.The PCB has deferred its final decision on participation after Bangladesh were removed from the tournament, with chairman Mohsin Naqvi setting Friday or Monday as the deadline to either confirm Pakistan’s participation or pull out. The uncertainty has sparked strong reactions from former players, many of whom believe support for Bangladesh should not come at the cost of Pakistan’s own cricketing interests.As per a PTI report, former Pakistan Test captain Muhammad Hafeez clearly backed participation, insisting the team must be sent to the World Cup. Former PCB chairman Khalid Mahmood and ex-board secretary Arif Ali Abbasi also found little logic in withdrawing from the event.“I can understand Pakistan supporting Bangladesh but what purpose will PCB achieve by not sending its team apart from spoiling relations with the International Cricket Council and member boards,” Abbasi said, stressing that the PCB must prioritise Pakistan cricket.Abbasi, who served during the tenure of influential administrators like Jagmohan Dalmiya and I.S. Bindra, also raised logistical and financial concerns. “What about our relations with Sri Lanka? Obviously Sri Lanka will suffer losses if Pakistan doesn’t go as all our matches are in Sri Lanka, including matches with India,” he pointed out.Mahmood described the PCB’s stance as “laudable” but urged pragmatism. “We have to remember that except for Pakistan, no other cricket board supported the Bangladesh demand to move matches from India. I can understand the stance taken by the Bangladesh board but it is also a fact no one supported them in the ICC meeting,” he said.Former Test batsman, chief selector and head coach Mohsin Khan echoed similar views. “We have issues with India but we are playing all our matches in Sri Lanka,” he said, adding that reports suggested the Bangladesh Board would not appeal the ICC decision. “So then on what grounds will the PCB not send its team to the World Cup? It will be bad for our cricket,” he cautioned.Former captains Inzamam-ul-Haq and Mohammad Yousuf urged the PCB to weigh all factors carefully. “I personally would like to see Pakistan compete in the World Cup. We have some good players and our cricket needs to see our team doing well in big events,” Inzamam said.Former Test batsman and ex-chief selector Haroon Rasheed summed up the mood: “We supported Bangladesh, which is a good thing. We took a principled stance, but now is also the time to look at our own cricket interests.”",Former Pakistan cricketers and ex-board officials have cautioned the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) against boycotting the upcoming ICC Men’s T20 World Cup in solidarity with Bangladesh.

"'One bad day can undo everything': Rahul Dravid cautions Team India, reflects on 2023 WC pain",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/one-bad-day-can-undo-everything-rahul-dravid-cautions-team-india-reflects-on-2023-wc-pain/articleshow/127635039.cms,"Rahul Dravid (Getty Images)

Why Gautam Gambhir is not the ONLY problem | Greenstone Lobo predicts India coach future

Former India coach Rahul Dravid has tipped India as strong favourites to defend their T20 World Cup crown, starting February 7. Dravid, who celebrated the fulfilment of a long-held dream on June 29, 2024, when India ended a 13-year ICC title drought, believes the current team’s approach under Suryakumar Yadav and coach Gautam Gambhir is exceptional. With India unbeaten in T20I series for nearly three years — their last loss coming against the West Indies in August 2023 — the Men in Blue appear a daunting force heading into the home World Cup.Yet, Dravid offered a reminder that in T20 cricket, one off day can undo everything. Reflecting on November 19, 2023, he said, “Irrespective of how strong the Indian team is, one bad day in the office can undo everything.” Dravid had considered stepping down after India’s brilliant 10-match winning streak at the last World Cup, only to be persuaded by Rohit Sharma to continue for another six months.Highlighting India’s dominance in T20 cricket, Dravid noted their 80% success rate in recent years. “They clearly start as favourites, and they will make it to the semi-finals, but as I have learned to my bitter disappointment, it’s about the better team on the day. Anybody can play a good knock and upset you,” he added at an event celebrating the book The Rise of the Hitman by R. Kaushik.Dravid also credited Rohit Sharma for transforming India’s white-ball game. Following the disappointing 2022 T20 World Cup exit against England, Rohit sparked a batting revolution that continues to bear fruit.“There was a feeling that we were slightly behind in white-ball cricket and needed to push the envelope a little more. Run rates were going up, risk-taking was increasing, and we needed to adapt to that reality,” Dravid said.“What was brilliant was that Rohit took the lead immediately. He took responsibility for setting the tempo himself, rather than asking others to do it. When your leader stands up and says, ‘I will do this, even if it comes at the cost of my average or my personal numbers,’ it becomes much easier to pass that message through the team. I thought Rohit managed the transition into leadership really well. The team never felt that he had changed, and that is a rare and important quality in a leader. ”","Rahul Dravid tipped India as strong favourites to defend their T20 World Cup crown, starting February 7.

Why Gautam Gambhir is not the ONLY problem | Greenstone Lobo predicts India coach future

India opened their Super Six campaign at the U-19 World Cup with a statement performance, dismantling Zimbabwe by a massive 204-run margin on Tuesday. Middle-order batter Vihaan Malhotra played the defining role with a composed, unbeaten century, while Abhigyan Kundu continued his rich vein of form as India piled on the misery for their opponents.Fresh off a flawless group stage in which they comfortably brushed aside the USA, Bangladesh and New Zealand, India showed no signs of easing up. Batting first, they amassed a formidable 352 for 8, maintaining the aggressive approach that has defined their tournament so far.At the heart of the innings was Malhotra’s assured 109 not out from 107 deliveries, an effort built on patience and sound shot selection. Kundu complemented him perfectly with a fluent 61 off 62 balls as Zimbabwe’s bowling attack struggled to find answers. The early momentum was provided by Vaibhav Sooryavanshi, who tore into the attack at the top, racing to 52 off just 30 balls as India surged to 100 inside 11 overs.A brief wobble followed in the 11th over when India lost Sooryavanshi and skipper Ayush Mhatre in quick succession, slipping to 101 for 3. The setback, however, barely slowed the scoring rate. Malhotra and wicketkeeper-batter Kundu steadied the innings before accelerating, stitching together a vital 113-run partnership for the fifth wicket that lifted India from 130 for 4 to 243 for 5 by the 36th over.Zimbabwe’s persistence with pacer Nigel Mazai proved expensive, with the bowler conceding 86 runs from his eight overs. India finished strongly, with Malhotra adding valuable lower-order runs alongside RS Ambrish and Khilan Patel to push the total beyond 350.The chase never gathered momentum. Pacers Ambrish and Henil Patel struck early, sharing the new ball to reduce Zimbabwe to 24 for 3 within nine overs. Although Kian Blignaut and Leeroy Chiwaula showed resistance, the required rate spiralled out of reach. Skipper Mhatre’s part-time off-spin and Udhav Mohan’s left-arm pace completed the rout, bowling Zimbabwe out for 148 in 37.4 overs.With six points, India now sit atop Group 2 of the Super Six, making a commanding start to the business end of the tournament.",India thrash Zimbabwe by 204 runs.

NEW DELHI: KL Rahul has revealed that retirement has crossed his mind, though he insists it is still ""some time away"" and promises he won’t prolong the decision when the moment arrives. In a candid chat with former England captain Kevin Pietersen on his YouTube channel, Rahul said stepping away from cricket would not be a tough choice, noting that life continues beyond the sport.""I've (thought about it). I don't think it's (retirement) gonna be that difficult,"" the 33-year-old told Pietersen.""If you're honest with yourself, when it's time, it's time. And there's no point dragging it. Obviously, I'm some time away.""Rahul’s impressive international record includes 4,053 runs in 67 Tests at an average of 35.8, 3,360 runs in 94 ODIs at 50.9, and 2,265 runs in 72 T20Is at 37.75, with a strike rate of 139.He also reflected on his perspective regarding fame and importance, explaining that seeing himself as just another player helps make the retirement decision easier.""Just quit. Just enjoy the stuff that you've got and you have your family and just do that.That's the hardest battle. So I try and tell myself that I'm not that important. Cricket in our country will carry on. Cricket in the world will carry on. There are more important things in life and I think this mindset I've always had, but ever since I've had my first baby, it's just like, the way you look at life is completely different,” he said.Rahul further discussed the ""hardest battle"" of dealing with recurring injuries, which forced him to question his ability to continue at the top level. “There have been times when I'm injured and I've been injured so many times and that's the hardest battle that you have to face. It's not the pain that the physio puts you through or the surgeon puts you through. It's the mental battle where your mind just gives up. When it happens so many times, your mind is just like, you've done enough. You've been lucky enough that cricket's given you enough money. You can survive for the next how many ever years.""Looking ahead, Rahul is set to represent Karnataka in a crucial Ranji Trophy clash against Punjab in Mohali on Thursday.","KL Rahul says retirement has crossed his mind, though he insists it is still ""some time away"" He promises he won’t prolong the decision when the moment arrives.

Ravi Bishnoi press conference: on reading conditions, bowling plans & staying focussed

Poll Do you think Bumrah should bowl with the new ball more often? Yes, absolutely Maybe, depending on the situation No, I prefer him in the death overs

GUWAHATI: If flexi-cap mutual funds delivered returns like Jasprit Bumrah , they wouldn’t need that familiar fine print about ‘market risk’. In a format where even good balls can disappear over the ropes, Bumrah offers something rarer than pace and swing — certainty.T20 is built on volatility: take wickets, leak runs, bowl tight, miss breakthroughs. Bumrah keeps breaking that trade-off. Whether he is asked to attack up front, disrupt in the middle or shut the door at the death, he gives India’s captains the same thing — dot balls, wickets and control, often all in the same over.Captain Suryakumar Yadav has largely held Bumrah back in this five-match series against New Zealand, using him as a middle-overs enforcer and a death-overs closer rather than a new-ball specialist. It hasn’t dulled the impact one bit.Rested for the second T20I, Bumrah was brought on in the final over of the powerplay in Sunday’s third game here at the Barsapara Cricket Stadium. Harshit Rana and Hardik Pandya shared the new ball, Ravi Bishnoi slipped in an over. Then Bumrah arrived — and struck immediately. First ball, Tim Seifert’s offstump was uprooted.Bumrah angled one in from over the wicket, hit a hard length and beat the opener for pace and movement.Rana and Pandya had already removed Devon Conway and Rachin Ravindra early but Bumrah — with Bishnoi squeezing in tandem — ensured New Zealand never rebuilt. Bumrah finished with his familiar miserly figures of 4-0-17-3 to earn Player of the Match as New Zealand were restricted to 153/9.“I was keeping an eye when Harshit and Hardik bowled, what is the best option over here (on this pitch). Obviously when I came on, the ball had become a little scuffed up,” Bumrah said at the presentation. “Usually, the white ball doesn’t swing for long. So it was about using my best option.”His spell was a study in authority. He bowled the sixth over to finish the powerplay, returned in the 11th to keep the squeeze on and then cleaned up the back end. Kyle Jamieson was bowled in his 18th-over burst, Bumrah was involved in the run-out of Matt Henry soon after and he came back in the final over to have Mitchell Santner picked out in the deep.Asked if he was enjoying being used away from his customary new-ball role, Bumrah sounded perfectly at home with the shifting brief. “I’m happy as far as I’m able to contribute. So if the team wants me to bowl with the new ball, I’m more than happy. If they want me to bowl in the end, I’m happy to do that (too),” he said, stressing that flexibility is non-negotiable in modern T20 cricket.The night also carried personal weight. Bumrah has completed 10 years in international cricket, a milestone he spoke about with a touch of emotion.“I, as a child, only dreamt to play one game. Ten years playing for your country, being a pure fast bowler, fighting aches and pains, assumptions, opinions,” he said. “People gave me six months. It’s a feather in my cap (playing for 10 years) and I’ll keep it with me.”","Jasprit Bumrah was named Player of the Match in the third T20I against New Zealand in Guwahati.

NEW DELHI: World No.1 women's tennis player Aryna Sabalenka produced another milestone moment at the Australian Open on Sunday, and in the process, she broke a Grand Slam record previously held by legend Novak Djokovic By dominating yet another tiebreak, Sabalenka claimed her 20th consecutive tiebreak win at Grand Slam events, moving past Djokovic’s mark of 19 and becoming the outright leader in the Open Era.The achievement quickly drew a reaction from Djokovic himself, who responded publicly and with humour.While acknowledging Sabalenka’s remarkable consistency under pressure, the Serbian star joked about losing the record, writing on X, “I’m upset right now.”His light-hearted comment highlighted the significance of the moment and showed respect for Sabalenka’s growing place in tennis history.Sabalenka reached the quarterfinals after a straight-sets victory over Canada’s Victoria Mboko, winning her Round of 16 match 6-1, 7-6 (1) on Sunday.Although Mboko is just 19 years old and seeded No. 17, Sabalenka took control early and set the tone with powerful serving and aggressive shot-making.She hit three aces in the opening set, controlled the rallies, and broke serve quickly. She wrapped up the set in only 31 minutes while looking calm and confident throughout.The second set proved more challenging, as the Belarusian made more unforced errors and Mboko lifted her level.Mboko chased every ball and played with belief, pushing Sabalenka and forcing longer rallies.Sabalenka built a 4-1 lead and later served at 5-4, but she missed three match points, allowing Mboko to gain momentum and force a tiebreak.However, once the match reached the tiebreak, Sabalenka’s dominance returned. She took control from the start, closed it out with ease, and sealed the record-breaking win.Sabalenka’s success in Melbourne has been consistent. She won the Australian Open in 2023 and defended her title in 2024 after finishing runner-up the year before, and she has also captured two US Open titles.","World No.1 Aryna Sabalenka breaks Novak Djokovic's Grand Slam tiebreak record.

Chennai Super Kings (CSK) IPL trade, retentions and releases: Why the Yellow Army is in a deep mess!

MS Dhoni has begun batting practice ahead of the upcoming Indian Premier League (IPL) season, with Chennai Super Kings (CSK) sharing a video of the session on social media.The official CSK Instagram handle posted visuals of the 44-year-old working on his defence and back-foot shots. The post was captioned: ""A treat, every time he bats. Superfans, you know what time it is. ""Despite skipper Ruturaj Gaikwad being in strong form in domestic cricket, CSK continue to have Dhoni as their marquee player as they look to target a sixth IPL title. The franchise has won the tournament five times.CSK finished last in the previous season, managing four wins from 14 matches. Dhoni had a modest campaign, scoring 196 runs in 13 innings at an average of 24.50 and a strike rate of 135.17, with a top score of 30 not out. He also led the side in matches where Gaikwad was unavailable due to injury.With wicketkeeper-batter Sanju Samson joining CSK through a trade with Rajasthan Royals, Dhoni’s role and future have come under focus.

NEW DELHI: Indian all-rounder Hardik Pandya marked a significant milestone in his career on Monday, reflecting on completing 10 years in international cricket and insisting that his journey with India is far from over.Hardik, who made his international debut against Australia in an ODI at Adelaide on Republic Day in 2016, took to Instagram to share an emotional message on completing a decade at the highest level. “10 years of this journey, the year I turn 33. It is one thing to play the sport I love with all my heart, and it is another to be able to serve my country through it,” Hardik wrote.Expressing gratitude for the challenges that shaped him, he added, “I love you all, thank you for everything. Thank you God for the trials and tribulations that got me here… The chances that so many people took… The opportunity to live this life.”Far from sounding reflective or content, Hardik stressed that he sees this phase as a new beginning. “This year has taught me that this is merely the beginning. I am only just getting started on the path I truly wish to walk,” he said.Looking back at his formative years, Hardik spoke about the sacrifices and setbacks that defined his rise. He recalled being “a young Hardik running an extra few miles to get to play from Baroda”, bowling extra balls in the nets, becoming an all-rounder at 19, and facing rejection along the way. “Getting to play for my desh has been the most worthwhile journey for me,” he wrote.“God had great plans for me when he let me debut on the 26th of January. I have become a man while playing this sport, and I will grow old playing it too,” Hardik concluded.Since his debut, Hardik has been central to India’s white-ball success, winning the 2024 T20 World Cup and the 2025 Champions Trophy.

(AP)

Suryakumar Yadav press conference: On India T20I Playing XI, personal form and more

Moments after India completed a 10-over chase of 154 in Guwahati, New Zealand batter Daryl Mitchell walked up to Suryakumar Yadav and examined his bat, smiling as he did so.Suryakumar had just struck 57 off 26 balls, following up his 37-ball 82 in Raipur in the previous match. It was his second fifty in as many games in the series.Two matches, two fifties, and suddenly the questions that had followed him for months were quieter. Perhaps Mitchell wanted to know what kind of willow could do that. Or perhaps it was simply recognition of a batter who, when timing and intent align, can make the field feel too small.For the Indian team management, however, the feeling was less about admiration and more about reassurance. With the T20 World Cup less than a month away, the return of form of the captain is a key development.Until January 23, the picture had been different. Suryakumar had gone 23 innings without a fifty, with his last half-century coming on October 12, 2024. In that period, he managed only one score in excess of 40 and one above 30.There was also a pattern that raised concern. During that stretch, he was dismissed by fast bowlers 15 times within the first 10 balls of his innings.The second T20I at Raipur proved to be a turning point, aided by an unexpected match situation. The early dismissals of Abhishek Sharma and Sanju Samson, both back in the pavilion within 1.1 overs, forced Suryakumar into a role that required patience rather than instant acceleration.With the openers gone early, there was no demand on him to match a fast start. He had the chance to steady the innings and assess conditions.He began cautiously, scoring 10 runs from his first 10 balls. That strike-rate of 100 was unusual for him, but it allowed him to read the pitch and bowlers.Once settled, Suryakumar shifted gears. He scored 72 runs off his next 27 deliveries, targeting the fast bowlers who had troubled him in recent months.Zak Foulkes conceded 41 runs from 12 balls. Matt Henry went for 14 off six, while Jacob Duffy was taken for 16 off 11. Foulkes, in particular, bore the brunt, with boundaries behind fine leg, over long-on, through point and deep third man, and straight down the ground.It marked the return of the 360-degree strokeplay that defines Suryakumar’s batting.Former India captain Sunil Gavaskar highlighted the importance of that innings during the broadcast.""The knock gave him exactly the confidence he needed. He hasn’t been short of form; he’s been short of runs. He has been batting very well in the nets. He’s not struggling there, he’s hitting the ball cleanly and all around the ground.""It just wasn’t working for him in matches. Sometimes, all it takes is a bit of luck to get going. This time, he didn't even need luck. That innings was exactly what he needed. His confidence is back,"" Gavaskar said.The impact of that confidence was visible in the third T20I at the Baraspara Stadium on Sunday.This time, Suryakumar walked in under different circumstances. India were 53 for two in 3.2 overs while chasing 154. With more than 100 runs required and plenty of overs left, there was time to build an innings.He again started cautiously, scoring eight runs from his first eight balls, while Abhishek Sharma continued scoring freely at the other end.Suryakumar did not try to match his younger partner’s pace, even as Abhishek scored at a strike-rate of 345. Instead, the 35-year-old chose his match-ups carefully, focusing on the spinners.Glenn Phillips went for 15 runs off five balls. Ish Sodhi conceded 14 from eight, while Mitchell Santner was taken for 18 off eight. Many of the runs came through the sweep and slog-sweep.The innings underlined that Suryakumar has settled into his role at No. 4, giving India a safety net if the openers fail.Former India opener Aakash Chopra shared a similar view during a chat show.""He seemed to have realised that he needs to spend some time (in the middle). You have to accept that you need runs. Therefore a lot of strokes (to be played) along the ground, and not taking too many chances.""More importantly, he never allowed his ego to come in when Ishan Kishan was going hammer and tongs at one end. These are important things as you are not thinking only about this bilateral series, as this is a preparation for the World Cup,"" Chopra said.","Suryakumar Yadav has scored two fifties in as many games in the series. The 35-year-old had gone 23 innings without a fifty, with his last half-century coming on October 12, 2024.

Poll Do you believe Pakistan is interfering in Bangladesh's decision regarding the T20 World Cup? Yes, definitely No, not really

NEW DELHI: BCCI vice-president Rajeev Shukla has accused Pakistan of misleading Bangladesh over security concerns that ultimately led to Dhaka’s refusal to play its ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2026 matches in India, triggering Scotland’s late inclusion in the tournament.Speaking to ANI, Shukla said Bangladesh had been assured of full security and that its concerns were addressed, but the situation was aggravated by outside interference. “We wanted Bangladesh to play, and we also assured full security, but since they have made this decision, it is very difficult to change the entire schedule at the last moment. This is why Scotland was brought in,” Shukla said.He was far more direct while referring to Pakistan’s role in the episode. “Pakistan is intervening in the matter without any reason and provoking Bangladesh. Everyone knows the brutality done by Pakistan on the Bangladeshis, and now they are trying to mislead them, which is completely wrong,” he added.The comments come amid uncertainty over Pakistan’s own participation in the T20 World Cup, to be co-hosted by India and Sri Lanka from February 7 to March 8.Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman and Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi had earlier indicated that Islamabad could rethink its participation following Bangladesh’s withdrawal from matches in India.According to Dawn News, Naqvi suggested Pakistan could reconsider playing in the tournament, a stance he later followed up by delaying a final decision. On Monday, Naqvi said a call on Pakistan’s participation would be deferred by up to a week. After meeting Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif, Naqvi described it as a “productive meeting” and said the premier had “directed that we resolve it while keeping all options on the table”. He later posted on X that the final decision would be taken “either on Friday or next Monday”.Despite the uncertainty, Pakistan announced a 15-member squad for the World Cup a day after Naqvi’s initial remarks, even as local media reported that the PCB was also considering boycotting a February 15 clash against arch-rivals India due to political tensions.Pakistan backed Bangladesh during an ICC Board meeting, citing last year’s Champions Trophy precedent where India played their matches in Dubai due to security concerns in Pakistan. However, the ICC stood firm, prioritising the integrity of the tournament schedule.",BCCI vice-president Rajeev Shukla accuses Pakistan of misleading Bangladesh over security concerns that ultimately led to Dhaka’s refusal to play its T20 World Cup 2026 matches in India.

Why Tilak Varma will miss T20Is vs New Zealand | Comeback date revealed | T20 World Cup

Poll Do you agree with cricket Scotland's replacement of Bangladesh in the ICC Men's T20 World Cup? Yes, they deserve the opportunity No, Bangladesh should have participated

NEW DELHI: Cricket Scotland chief executive Trudy Lindblade has expressed sympathy for Bangladesh after the International Cricket Council (ICC) confirmed Scotland as their replacement for the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2026, while admitting the circumstances of their qualification were far from ideal.“We certainly have (sympathy) for the Bangladesh team,” Lindblade said, as quoted by ESPNcricinfo, after the ICC removed Bangladesh from the tournament scheduled to be played from February 7 to March 8 in Sri Lanka and India.“Obviously, this is not how we wanted to go to a World Cup. There is a qualification process, and nobody wants to qualify or attend or be invited to a World Cup in the way that we have done. We acknowledge it is certainly unique circumstances by our participation, and we do feel for the Bangladesh players,” she added.Bangladesh were removed from the 20-team event after the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) refused to participate under the published match schedule. The ICC rejected the BCB’s request to move Bangladesh’s matches from India to Sri Lanka, stating there was no credible or verifiable security threat to the Bangladesh national team in India.Responding to criticism around Scotland’s inclusion, Lindblade struck a measured tone. “I wouldn't use those words. People will have their views, and they are entitled to their views,” she said. “All we know is that we have been invited to participate in the World Cup. We are a team that is ranked 14th in the world. We are also a strong team that plays consistently throughout the year.”Reflecting on Scotland’s failed qualification campaign, she added, “That World Cup [qualifier] for us was not how we normally play, and therefore we are just pleased to be at this World Cup. We are happy to step in, although it is unique and challenging circumstances, and we absolutely recognise that.”In its official release, the ICC said it undertook an extensive process over more than three weeks to address BCB’s concerns, including multiple rounds of dialogue, independent security assessments, and sharing detailed federal and state-level security plans. After the BCB failed to confirm participation, the ICC moved to identify a replacement in line with governance and qualification processes.Scotland, ranked 14th in T20Is, are the highest-ranked team not to have originally qualified, sitting above seven teams already in the tournament, and will now take their place on the world stage.","Cricket Scotland chief executive Trudy Lindblade has expressed sympathy for Bangladesh after the ICC confirmed Scotland as their replacement for the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2026.

Allan Donald on Virat Kohli’s legacy: Can he reach 100 centuries?

Playing aggressive cricket, the pair shared a 70-run partnership off 31 balls and launched a stunning late-innings assault that took the game right down to the very last ball.Despite their efforts, the Capitals fell agonisingly short by just three runs against the Gujarat Giants at the BCA Stadium in Vadodara on Tuesday.Needing 60 runs from the final 24 balls, the duo targeted the experienced Sophie Devine in the 17th over, taking her to the cleaners with 23 runs. Their assault continued in the 19th over against Ashleigh Gardner, where they plundered another 20 runs, dramatically bringing the required equation down to just 9 runs in the nail-biting final over, bowled by Devine.Ultimately, the vast experience of the New Zealand allrounder shone through as she dismissed Sneh on the fourth delivery and then claimed Niki’s wicket on the very last ball, sealing the tense match.The Giants now are in the second position, while the Capitals dropped to the fourth place.The Giants’ win was built on opener Beth Mooney ’s knock.

In a nail-biting finish at the Kotambi Stadium in Vadodara, Gujarat Giants eked out a three-run victory over Delhi Capitals in the 17th match of the Women’s Premier League 2026, completing a season double against their rivals. The victory was sealed thanks to veteran all-rounder Sophie Devine, who displayed remarkable composure under pressure to defend the final over.Chasing a competitive target of 175, Delhi needed nine runs from the last over with Sneh Rana and Niki Prasad at the crease. Devine, who had already shown her mettle earlier in the season against the same opponents, kept a tight line in the first three deliveries, conceding just four runs. She then struck decisively, trapping Rana lbw and leaving Prasad to face the final ball requiring four. Prasad went for a big swing, only to send the ball straight to Ashleigh Gardner in the deep, handing Gujarat a dramatic victory.Earlier, Gujarat posted 174 for 9, powered by an elegant 58 from Beth Mooney off 46 balls and a lively 39 from Anushka Sharma. Tanuja Kanwar’s late cameo of 21 not out off 11 balls helped lift the total into a defendable range.On the bowling front, Shree Charani led Delhi’s attack with career-best figures of 4 for 31, while Chinelle Henry claimed 2 for 38 and Minnu Mani added 1 for 23.Delhi’s innings began positively as Shafali Verma raced to 26 in just 2.2 overs but was removed by Rajeshwari Gayakwad . Laura Wolvaardt (24) and Lizelle Lee (11) failed to build momentum, and Jemimah Rodrigues (16) fell to Devine. Marizanne Kapp’s golden duck and Chinelle Henry’s 9 left Delhi in trouble. A late stand between Rana (29) and Prasad (47) offered hope, but Devine’s expert death bowling ensured the Giants held their nerve.With this win, Gujarat Giants climb into second place on the points table, while Delhi Capitals are left to rue their inability to convert starts into big scores.","Gujarat Giants eked out a three-run victory over Delhi Capitals in the 17th match of the Women’s Premier League 2026.

NEW DELHI: Harry Brook and Joe Root produced contrasting centuries to power England to a 53-run victory over Sri Lanka, sealing a 2-1 win in the one-day international series on Tuesday. Brook smashed an unbeaten 136 off just 66 balls, hitting nine sixes and 11 fours, while Root followed up his second-ODI half-century with 111 off 108 balls as England posted a commanding 357-3.For Sri Lanka, Pavan Rathnayake top-scored with 121 off 115 balls, becoming the last batter dismissed as the hosts were bowled out for 304 in the 47th over.“Working on a few things in the nets and it paid off,” Brook said. “Glad me, Rooty and Beth could get us to that total … Root is exceptional, to have him in the side helps every day.”Spinners once again played a key role in England's first major ODI series win away from home since 2023, with Will Jacks (2-43), Liam Dawson (2-48) and Adil Rashid (2-61) sharing six wickets.The defeat marked Sri Lanka’s first home series loss in five years, their previous setback coming against India in 2021.England’s innings had a shaky start, slipping to 40-2 in the 11th over when Ben Duckett fell to offspinner Dhananjaya de Silva’s first delivery and Rehan Ahmed holed out off Wanindu Hasaranga’s third ball. However, Root and Jacob Bethell regained control, displaying confidence against both pace and spin.Bethell contributed 65 runs in a 126-run third-wicket partnership with Root, who dominated the spinners with sweeps and reverse sweeps en route to his 20th ODI century.Brook’s brutal assault in the final five overs proved decisive, as he and Root added 191 runs off just 113 deliveries.Experienced legspinner Wanindu Hasaranga, playing his first match of the series, and Jeffrey Vandersay ended with expensive figures of 1-76 each, while pacer Asitha Fernando conceded 0-77 off nine overs, giving away 10 boundaries and two sixes.Sri Lanka’s chase had a bright start with Pathum Nissanka scoring a rapid 50 off 25 balls, but the home side slipped to 94-3 in the 10th over. The young Rathnayake, in his fourth ODI, displayed plenty of promise, striking a dozen fours and a six before Sam Curran bowled him clean with a perfect yorker.“The result was disappointing,” Sri Lanka skipper Charith Asalanka said. “Positive was we found a good player at No. 4, Pavan Rathnayake. (It is) really tough, was thinking the ball might turn, that’s why we played 3-4 spinners, but when it’s not turning, it’s hard to bowl spin.”","England beat Sri Lanka by 53 runs to win one-day international series 2-1.

Fans have been treated to countless nail-biters in ODIs and T20Is, with both formats regularly producing edge-of-the-seat finishes. Particularly in T20Is, matches have often turned dramatically within a single over, whether through explosive batting or decisive bowling, completely altering the course of the game. But Test cricket has never been far behind. The longest format has also delivered unforgettable thrillers, with the Men in Whites keeping spectators captivated when contests went down to the wire and were decided by the barest of margins.One such classic unfolded in 1993, when West Indies edged Australia by just one run in Adelaide.For West Indies, it was a triumph built on composure and discipline. For Australia, it became a heartbreak etched into Adelaide folklore.That one-run victory remained the smallest margin in Test history for 30 years, until New Zealand matched the feat with their dramatic one-run win over England in Wellington in 2023.West Indies scripted one of Test cricket’s most dramatic finishes at Adelaide Oval, defeating Australia by a single run to extend their unbeaten Test series run against the hosts to 13 years. In a nerve-shredding finale played out on Australia Day, Courtney Walsh and Curtly Ambrose held their nerve to seal a result that now ranks among the game’s great thrillers.Chasing a modest target of 186, Australia seemed in control early before Ambrose ignited a collapse by trapping David Boon lbw for a duck. What followed was a remarkable unravelling. Mark Taylor fell cheaply, Steve Waugh, Allan Border and Ian Healy departed in quick succession, and when Merv Hughes was dismissed, Australia were staring at 74 for 7.Debutant Justin Langer then mounted a defiant resistance with a patient 54, keeping Australia alive. His effort, combined with Tim May’s spirited unbeaten 42, turned what looked like a lost cause into a gripping contest.From 144 for 9, the final pair pushed West Indies to the brink, drawing Australia closer to an improbable victory as a packed Adelaide Oval watched in silence.With just two runs required, drama peaked when Craig McDermott was adjudged caught behind off Walsh by Darrell Hair — a decision that continues to be debated. McDermott’s dismissal ended Australia’s chase at 184, triggering wild celebrations in the West Indies camp and leaving the home crowd stunned.Earlier, West Indies had laid a solid foundation in the first innings. Brian Lara top-scored with 52, while Desmond Haynes and Phil Simmons contributed 45 and 46 respectively. Junior Murray’s unbeaten 49 guided the visitors to 252, with Merv Hughes claiming five wickets for Australia.Australia replied with 213, undone largely by Ambrose’s devastating figures of 6 for 74. Steve Waugh battled with 42 and Hughes added a valuable 43 lower down the order, but the hosts still conceded a 39-run deficit.Richie Richardson then anchored West Indies’ second innings with a fluent 72, supported by Carl Hooper’s 25, before Tim May ran through the tail with 5 for 9 to dismiss the visitors for 146 and set Australia a target that initially appeared straightforward.What followed was a masterclass in fast bowling under pressure. Ambrose claimed four wickets in the final innings, Walsh took three, and together they engineered a collapse that delivered a one-run victory — a margin that stood unmatched for three decades.Test cricket has long been celebrated for its five-day drama, but few moments capture its cruelty and brilliance quite like matches decided by just a handful of runs. A select group of contests, separated by the narrowest margins, serve as timeless reminders that every delivery can shape history.At the top of that rare list sits West Indies’ iconic one-run victory over Australia in Adelaide in January 1993. Chasing 186, Australia were bowled out for 184 after 79 overs in a heart-stopping finish that preserved Caribbean dominance and silenced the home crowd. For 30 years, it remained the smallest winning margin in Test cricket.That record was finally matched in February 2023, when New Zealand edged England by one run in Wellington while defending 258, producing another instant classic.England’s famous two-run win over Australia at Birmingham in August 2005 — the Edgbaston epic — also features prominently, while Australia’s three-run triumph over England in Manchester in 1902 stands as one of the earliest examples of Test cricket’s razor-thin outcomes. England later returned the favour with their own three-run victory in Melbourne in 1982.New Zealand appear twice on the list, having also beaten Pakistan by four runs in Abu Dhabi in 2018. South Africa’s five-run win over Australia in Sydney in 1994 added another chapter, before Australia registered a six-run victory over England in Sydney in 1885. More recently, India joined this elite group with a six-run triumph over England at The Oval in July 2025 while defending 374.Australia’s famous seven-run win over England at The Oval in 1882 — a match that directly led to the birth of the Ashes — also features among the top 10 smallest margins of victory in Test history.","West Indies beat Australia by a single run in 1993 in Adelaide.

Former India batsman Jacob Martin was arrested early Tuesday morning after reportedly crashing his luxury SUV into three parked vehicles in Vadodara, police said. Martin, 53, who represented India in 10 ODIs, was taken into custody following the accident.According to the Akota Police, the incident occurred around 2:30 am near Punit Nagar Society, when Martin, allegedly under the influence of alcohol, lost control of his MG Hector and collided with the cars parked outside a residence. The impact caused significant damage to the vehicles, police officials told PTI.A complaint lodged by the owners of the damaged cars led to the registration of a case under relevant sections of the BNS addressing rash and drunk driving. The police have also impounded Martin’s vehicle as part of the investigation.Martin, who previously captained Baroda in the Ranji Trophy, has a history of legal troubles. In 2011, he was arrested by Delhi Police in connection with a human trafficking case.This latest incident adds to the former cricketer’s controversial record and has prompted authorities to begin further inquiries.","Former India batsman Jacob Martin was arrested early Tuesday morning after reportedly crashing his luxury SUV into three parked vehicles in Vadodara.

NEW DELHI: Struggling opener Sanju Samson received a strong show of backing from India bowling coach Morne Morkel on Tuesday, with the former South African pacer expressing confidence that the right-hander is just one innings away from turning around his lean patch. Samson has managed only 16 runs across three T20Is so far, with a highest score of 10, even as fellow top-order batters Abhishek Sharma, Ishan Kishan and Suryakumar Yadav have dominated New Zealand’s bowling attack.""Sanju is one knock away from getting that confidence, getting that form back. For us, building up to the World Cup it's important for the guys to find that peak performance at the right time. He's training well, he's hitting the ball very well,"" Morkel said on the eve of the fourth T20I here.Despite the session being optional, Samson spent over 30 minutes honing his skills in the nets, taking on a range of bowlers including Axar Patel, Varun Chakravarthy, Abhishek and side-armer Raghu.After a brief period of rustiness, Samson began finding his rhythm, sending the ball racing to the far corners of the ACA-VDCA Stadium.The Kerala batter later engaged in an extended discussion with head coach Gautam Gambhir and batting coach Sitanshu Kotak on the sidelines, while Shreyas Iyer continued his own practice routine nearby. Both coaches were seen patiently offering guidance to the out-of-form batter.Morkel, however, played down concerns around Samson’s struggles, stressing that team success remained the priority over individual returns.""So, I think it's just a matter of time for him to get his foot on the board. But the main focus is that the team is winning, and I think that's important. We're 3-0 up in this series at the moment, the boys are playing some very good cricket.""We've got a couple of games now before the start of the World Cup, and I have no doubt that Sanju will find his form,"" added the South African.","India coach Morne Morkel backs struggling Sanju Samson.

NEW DELHI: Music composer and singer Palash Muchhal appeared at Andheri Court on Saturday to file a criminal defamation case against Marathi actor-producer Vidnyan Mane, seeking Rs 10 crore in damages. The legal move comes after Mane levelled allegations of cheating and financial fraud worth over Rs 40 lakh against the composer.Muchhal arrived at court accompanied by his legal team and kept a low profile throughout the proceedings.Dressed simply, he declined to comment on the accusations or his cancelled wedding with Indian cricketer Smriti Mandhana . After the hearing, the composer exited the premises without addressing the media and left directly in his car.The controversy marks another turbulent chapter for Muchhal, who has remained in the headlines since his highly publicised split with Mandhana last year.The cricketer’s wedding with Muchhal was reportedly called off after allegations emerged that the musician had been unfaithful.Mane, Mandhana’s childhood friend, has since made explosive claims, alleging that Muchhal was caught with another woman during wedding celebrations and was subsequently confronted.Recalling the incident, Mane told Hindustan Times, “I was at the wedding celebrations (November, 23, 2025) when he was caught red-handed with another woman in bed. Bhayanak scene tha. He was beaten up by the Indian female cricketers.""Mane has also accused Muchhal of cheating him of Rs 40 lakh in connection with an investment in an unreleased film.He further claimed that Muchhal’s family later asked him to invest an additional Rs 10 lakh, warning that he would otherwise lose his earlier investment.Following Mane’s statements, Muchhal issued a strong rebuttal on social media, calling the accusations baseless. “In light of the allegations made by Sangli-based Vidnyan Mane on social media, I wish to state that these claims against me are entirely baseless and factually incorrect…,” Muchhal wrote, adding that his lawyer Shreyansh Mithare is pursuing legal remedies.On Saturday, Muchhal confirmed that a Rs 10 crore defamation notice had been sent to Mane for what he described as “false, outrageous and highly defamatory accusations.” His lawyer reiterated that no money had reached the composer-filmmaker and said the claims were aimed at damaging his client’s image.",Music composer Palash Muchhal files criminal defamation case against Vidnyan Mane.

NEW DELHI: Legendary spinner Anil Kumble has thrown his weight behind Varun Chakravarthy to lead India’s spin department at next month’s T20 World Cup, expressing confidence that the mystery spinner will cope better with evening dew than wrist spinners such as Kuldeep Yadav . The marquee event will be staged from February 7 to March 8 across venues in India and Sri Lanka.Speaking on JioHotstar, Kumble acknowledged that dew is expected to be a significant factor during the tournament.""...especially during the time of the World Cup in February and March, with matches being played late in the evening. It's not going to be easy. As spinners, you tend to get used to bowling with a wet ball; it's nothing new.""However, one aspect that India can certainly take comfort from is that I don't think it affects someone like Varun Chakaravarthy because of the grip he has on the ball and the pace at which he bowls.""India’s spin trio of Varun Chakravarthy, Kuldeep Yadav and Axar Patel have delivered consistent performances in recent months, but Kumble highlighted Varun as the standout among them.""I don't think dew will bother him (Varun) that much. Yes, it's not the same as bowling with a dry ball, of course, but with a wet ball, I don't see Varun struggling too much.""Similarly, Axar Patel should also be fine. The one person who might find it a bit more difficult is Kuldeep Yadav with a wet ball because of his bowling style.Having said that, Kuldeep is also used to bowling in these conditions.""Given their method of delivery, wrist spinners are generally more vulnerable when operating with a wet ball.India head into the tournament in impressive form and currently hold a 3-0 lead in the ongoing five-match T20I series against New Zealand.Kumble also feels the defending champions are well placed to attempt a rare title defence — a feat yet to be achieved in the competition’s history.""I think when it comes to World Cups, winning back-to-back titles is not easy, especially in the T20 format. No team has been able to defend its title, and this presents a great opportunity for India to do that.""I certainly believe that the kind of form the team is in, and the strength of the playing squad, means India are well equipped to face any situation. India should certainly qualify for the semi-finals, and from there on, it's anybody's game.""But I genuinely believe India have a great chance to win the World Cup and make it a truly special one by winning back-to-back titles,"" Kumble said.",Anil Kumble backs Varun Chakravarthy to lead India’s spin department at T20 World Cup.

VILA-REAL: Kylian Mbappe netted twice to earn Real Madrid a 2-0 win at Villarreal on Saturday and take his side to the top of La Liga.Alvaro Arbeloa's team moved two points clear of arch-rivals Barcelona, who host bottom-of-the-table Real Oviedo on Sunday.La Liga's top scorer Mbappe reached 21 goals for the season in the competition to help Madrid see off a spirited Villarreal side, who are now fourth.Arbeloa's side have won three consecutive matches across all competitions and victory at Villarreal could be a vital step in the revival of their season.After the shock Copa del Rey defeat at second-tier Albacete in Arbeloa's first match at the helm just 10 days ago after replacing Xabi Alonso, his Madrid have started to take shape.The coach has made clear how important his star players are and none has been more crucial this season than French superstar Mbappe, who has netted 34 times across all competitions.Mbappe and Vinicius Junior ""are the best players in the world, they are players who can really unbalance teams, we try to get the ball to them as much as possible,"" Arbeloa told Real Madrid TV.""They're two players who... I'm really happy to have in this state of form and above all, because of the great work they are doing.""They are really committed to the team, they are the first who are pressing... they're giving this effort and solidarity that we need from them, so I'm very happy that their reward comes in the form of goals.""It was a lively but imprecise start at Villarreal's Estadio de la Ceramica, as the game glowed but neither side was able to seriously threaten.Georges Mikautadze lashed a volley narrowly wide after veteran forward Gerard Moreno found him with a floating cross.At the other end, Madrid midfielder Arda Guler fired straight at Villarreal stopper Luiz Junior after some tidy footwork, and then shot high over the bar at the end of a swift break.Villarreal's Juan Foyth limped off hurt in a blow for the hosts, who created a good chance for Pape Gueye just before the break.The Senegal midfielder, a champion at the Africa Cup of Nations last weekend, powered narrowly wide of the post.Vinicius, who excelled in Madrid's 6-1 Champions League rout of Monaco in midweek, also came close with a rasping effort that sailed across Luiz Junior's goal and wide.The 25-year-old Brazil forward went a 13th straight La Liga match without scoring, but was involved as Mbappe found the net two minutes into the second half.- 'Nightmare for defences' -Vinicius came into the box from the left flank and his low cross was blocked but Mbappe was on hand to squeeze home his 20th league goal of the campaign from close range.""They are a nightmare for defences,"" said Madrid goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois. ""I hope they can keep bringing joy.""Villarreal had the better of the second half as they worked hard to pull level, but Moreno spurned their best chance by firing inches over when well-placed.In stoppage time, Mbappe was felled clumsily by Alfonso Pedraza in the box and the French forward cheekily dinked home the resulting penalty to seal Madrid's victory.Mbappe's team-mate Brahim Diaz, who missed a similar attempted Panenka penalty for Morocco in the Africa Cup of Nations final, was on the pitch to see it as he returned to action for his club.""For you,"" Mbappe appeared to say to Diaz during the celebration, indicating it was a gesture of support.""For me, the most important thing is that (the players) are united, we saw it last Wednesday with Vinicius's goal (against Monaco) and we saw it again today, with Brahim,"" Arbeloa told reporters.The Yellow Submarine are now 10 points behind leaders Madrid, having played one fewer match than Arbeloa's side.""We have to be a bit more accurate in attack against these kinds of teams,"" admitted Villarreal midfielder Alberto Moleiro.Elsewhere, fifth-placed Espanyol fell to a 3-2 defeat at Valencia that left them seven points behind Villarreal.",Kylian Mbappe scores twice as Real Madrid beat Villarreal 2-0 in La Liga.

Having made a blockbuster €140 million move from Bayer Leverkusen to Anfield, Florian Wirtz has had a tricky start to life at Anfield and in the Premier League . Widely regarded as one of Europe’s most gifted creative attackers, the 22-year-old Germany international arrived at Liverpool on the back of a standout spell in Bundesliga, where his freedom, intelligence and ability to control games marked him out as a generational talent.In the 29 games he's played at Liverpool across competitions, he's scored four goals and provided seven assists.Before the eventual move to the Merseyside, there was interest also from Bayern Munich. But Wirtz’s decision to embrace the Premier League underlines both his ambition and belief in Liverpool’s long-term vision.In this wide-ranging exclusive conversation with TimesofIndia.com, facilitated by JioStar, Wirtz reflects on the pull of Liverpool’s history, the challenge of meeting sky-high expectations, and the clarity provided by the manager’s plans for the team.Liverpool's immense stature as a club first and foremost. The team that clinched the Premier League last year. Above all, the manager's vision convinced me.Tactics aren't much different from the Bundesliga or Germany duty.In-game, it's the physicality I need to adapt to most.They've had many great midfielders. I just focus on giving my best on the pitch. I don't know what sets me apart—whether I do better or they did. I simply want to play my game and achieve success with the club.Probably the first Newcastle game. It was wildly intense — the early red card, endless long balls, two-footed tackles, everything. The crowd went berserk. That moment made me think, 'This league is different from the Bundesliga.’I don't measure success in specific terms. I focus on delivering my best performance wherever I am — at Liverpool or with the national team—to be vital for the squad and drive achievements.

Trump Booed Loudly As Miami Stadium Erupts During College Football Playoff

AI to help with planning itineraries

BENGALURU: For those who are preparing to pack their bags to watch the likes of Lionel Messi, Kylian Mbappe, and Lamine Yamal in any of the 11 American cities that will host the World Cup 2026 matches, the Americans are determined to make it football’s best ever showpiece event. Awaiting the fans are fast-tracked visas and curated experiences, including road trips to explore the heart of the US, Route 66 being the most famous of them.The US joins Mexico and Canada to host the FIFA World Cup, the games in the US will begin with the hosts taking on Paraguay in a Group D match in Los Angeles on June 12, day after the tournament kicks off in Mexico City. That will set football (soccer for Americans) rolling across 11 cities for the next one month. The Americans, who put American football, baseball and basketball, above the world’s most popular sport are keen to make it the biggest ever spectacle for the millions of fans offering them an unbelievable time.“From New York to Miami to LA and Seattle, it’s quite a diverse list of host cities. I think each of the host cities are excited to put on a great show, and really engage their communities because it is very much about the communities that are hosting as well.The fan fests are going to be a great way to go beyond the stadium into the community. Local food, culture, music, and engaging with local communities as well. It’s hard to describe how exciting it’s going to be. I think it's going to be beyond any of our expectations,” Fred Dixon, president and CEO of Brand USA, told TOI in an exclusive interview.Speaking on the sidelines of the Brand USA Travel Week India held here, Dixon said the authorities also plan to make it easy for the spectators to get the US visa. “If you decide to buy tickets to the World Cup and you don’t have your visa yet, there actually is a way to facilitate that process to identify yourself as a ticket holder, and then the State Department will work to facilitate the visa processing faster for those travelers,” Dixon said.Dixon was particularly excited to welcome the Indians travelling for the World Cup. “In places like New Jersey and New York, places like Atlanta and Dallas, Texas, those are obviously big communities. The communities will come to life through the fan fests and so there will be the official fan fest events for every host city. So you'll be in the communities with the locals or with your friends and the people you're traveling with. With more than 5 million Indians living in the US, seeking out and traveling with or spending time with family and friends will be a big component of that,” Dixon said.On whether there will be any relaxation for the fans from Haiti and Iran, Dixon didn’t have an answer. “You’d have to check with the State Department,” he said.For those millions who get entry into the US and the special ones who get lucky through the draw, FIFA said there were 500 million requests for tickets to watch the matches, the US wanted to wow them. On top of the list are the road trips including the iconic Route 66.“It’s a unique moment as well because it’s the 250th anniversary of America. So you have America, 250 activities happening all across the country as well. The other anniversary that’s happening this year is Route 66. It's the 100th anniversary of the famous highway (opened on Nov 11, 1926) that connects California and Chicago -- from Chicago to Santa Monica. It winds through small, interesting towns all across the west of the US. And so you’re going to see a lot of themes around road trips, that freedom of the open road in America. So I think there will be a lot of curated experiences around road trips,” said Dixon.“In the host cities themselves, you’re going to have lots of curated experiences, whether it relates to museums, art, exhibitions. The travelers are going to benefit from the focus on a lot of Americana, both historical, but also what American brands, I think, have meant to the world. The Fleet Week, which is one of the big celebrations in New York every year in the harbour, has been moved from what is normally in late May. It’s now moving to July 4th. So just imagine the Statue of Liberty with fireworks and all the Navy fleets, you know. It’s expected to have the largest gathering of tall ships in the world for America 250, which will travel up the east coast of the US. So there is an unlimited amount of curated experiences to have,” Dixon added.“At americathebeautiful.com , we actually have AI integration to help with trip inspiration, particularly when you are dealing with an event that is multi-city, multi-date. We know what the group schedule will be, but as teams advance beyond the group, who’s going to the quarterfinals, who’s going to the semifinals, how would you route yourself? The itineraries may be dynamic if you’re following a particular team. And so our new website has an AI component built into it to help with itinerary suggestions and plannings and ideas.“You also can integrate what your passion points are. So if it’s culture, if it’s history and food, it will help give you highlights and ideas for how you can route yourself. It’s not a booking platform, but it's an inspiration platform. We’ve used AI in a way to help tap into really what is the best of America, and then to inspire travelers to travel, you know, far and to travel deep when they're in the US to explore the World cup, specifically,” Dixon signed off.","The US joins Mexico and Canada to host the FIFA World Cup.

He is survived by his wife, two daughters, and two sons.The All India Football Federation (AIFF) condoled the death of Pasha, who was one of the best footballers to have come out of Karnataka.A committed and soft-spoken footballer, Pasha carved out a distinguished career in an area of the field that demanded resilience and composure - defence.Primarily operating as a right wing-back, he was renowned for his impeccable sense of timing, calm demeanour, and ability to read the game astutely.Rarely flustered under pressure, Pasha's disciplined positioning and well-judged tackles ensured that opposing left wingers found little joy on his flank, while goalkeepers behind him operated with added confidence.At the international level, Pasha made his senior India debut on January 27, 1987, against Bulgaria in the Nehru Cup at Kozhikode.He went on to earn eight international caps, featuring in two editions of the Nehru Cup (1987 and 1991), the 1991 SAF Games, and the 1992 Asian Cup qualifiers.Pasha began his football journey with Vinayaka Football Club, Vyalikaval, in north Bengaluru, where he also resided.His consistent performances soon earned him a move to Indian Telephone Industries in the mid-1980s, a period that marked his emergence at the national level.From 1987 onwards, he became a regular feature for Karnataka in the Santosh Trophy , representing the state at the tournaments held in Kolkata in 1987, Quilon (now Kollam) in 1988, and Guwahati in 1989.His performance in Guwahati stood out, as Karnataka narrowly missed out on a final berth. He also won two Santosh Trophy titles with Bengal in 1993 and 1995.On the back of his domestic exploits, Pasha was signed by Mohammedan Sporting, where he continued to enhance his reputation, winning the Sait Nagjee Trophy and the Nizam Gold Cup in 1989.He later joined East Bengal, a move that ushered in the most defining phase of his club career. Representing the iconic red and gold from the early 1990s through the end of the decade, Pasha became an integral part of one of the club's most successful eras.He captained East Bengal during the 1993-94 season and was a trusted figure under the late coach Subhas Bhowmick.With the Red and Gold Brigade, he won the Calcutta Football League on five occasions (1991, 1993, 1995, 1996 and 1998), the IFA Shield five times (1990, 1991, 1994, 1995 and 1997), and the Durand Cup four times (1990, 1991, 1993 and 1995).His trophy cabinet also included two Rovers Cups (1990, 1994), the Federation Cup (1996), the historic Wai Wai Cup in Kathmandu (1993), Airlines Trophy titles in 1990, 1992, 1995 and 1997, the Bordoloi Trophy (1992), ATPA Shield (1992), Kalinga Cup (1993), McDowell Trophy (1995, 1997), and the Super Cup in the 1996-97 season.He was also a member of East Bengal's celebrated triple crown-winning side in 1990 and captained the team to its first international title at the Wai Wai Cup in 1993.He also wore the captain's armband when East Bengal registered a sensational 6-2 victory over Iraq's Al Zawraa SC in the 1993-94 Asian Cup Winners' Cup.He got a special Lifetime Achievement Award from East Bengal in 2012.The AIFF said it has joined the Indian football fraternity in mourning the loss of Pasha, a defender of rare composure and consistency, to honour his lasting contributions to the game.In Kolkata, the East Bengal flag was kept at half-mast on the day, while the club's Under-16 team observed a minute's silence before training.Former East Bengal skipper Falguni Dutta, who played alongside Pasha for two years, remembered him fondly. ""I came to know early in the morning. I was shocked.""When I came to the club in 1997, I was a raw talent and he was there to guide me as a mentor. He played in the same position as me, but I never saw any jealousy in him. He was like an elder brother -- a guide and a coach. He inspired us,"" Dutta said.East Bengal Club bid a final farewell to Pasha at his Bengaluru residence.Working committee member Dipten Bose paid his respects, while former players Saravanan, Thomas and Feroz were also present.","Former India and East Bengal defender Ilyas Pasha dies at 61.

AIFF have no bargaining power

Time for recalibration

What does the current RFP say?

Poll What is your opinion on the AIFF's decision to issue a second Request for Proposal for ISL broadcast rights? It's a necessary step for improvement It shows a lack of planning It's too late to make a difference I have no opinion on this

Last week, the All India Football Federation (AIFF) floated a Request for Proposal (RFP) tender looking for a broadcast partner for the 2025-26 Indian Super League (ISL) season. This was the second time in six months that the AIFF had issued such a document as the first version, released in October 2025, demanded an annual minimum guarantee of Rs 37.5 crore. For a variety of reasons, that didn't find any takers.Ever since, Indian football is in a free fall.AIFF's deal with Football Sports Development Limited (FSDL), which had started the ISL in 2014, expired on December 8, 2025. Between AIFF Constitutional changes, court visits, lack of commercial partners and eventual intervention by the Sports Ministry, ISL has taken a massive hit to its credibility, even if it now has a start date in February 14.The fixtures for ISL 2025-26, which have been tucked away in the draft folder for days due to home venues being in shambles, add to the challenge for any prospective broadcast bidder(s).With 91 matches to be played in the upcoming truncated season in a single leg home-and-away format, this race against time only gets trickier with each passing day. The fact that AIFF have not officially appointed an agency to oversee the broadcast bids process doesn't bode well either.In 2021, the BCCI brought in audit, tax and financial advisory consultants KPMG to advise them on the media rights sale for the IPL. The objective was clear: earn 'top dollar.' It resulted in media rights for the IPL going at Rs 48,390.32 crore over five years - a 100 percent jump in value per match.AIFF, which has hardly showcased its competence in the past few months, is alone in this regard. Before FSDL stepped away, the ISL had a broadcast deal worth Rs 550 crore over two seasons with games showcased on linear TV and OTT. At first, ISL matches were broadcast on the Star Sports Network before moving to the Viacom18-owned Sports18/JioCinema.The Rs 275 crore-a-year deal was reportedly a 37.5 percent increase on what Star India, who had a majority stake in the ISL, had been paying in the first 10 years of the competition.This Rs 275 crore funded things such as match production, league marketing, revenue for the clubs and fixed payments to the federation. Despite this, FSDL posted losses of Rs 14.34 crore in FY23, Rs 46.3 crore in FY22, Rs 13.7 crore in FY21 and Rs 27 crore in FY20. The league only turned profitable when operations were scaled down, posting a net profit of Rs 45.2 crore in FY24.Now, in this post-FSDL era, AIFF and, by extension, the ISL clubs have little room to negotiate with any potential bidders. With the ISL set to be played in multiple cities, it adds to the costs involved with only Rs 9.77 crore budgeted for Production and Transmission. In the past, it hovered around Rs 70 crores.It means the quality output of the broadcast will be lower. Instead of multi-camera setups in different parts of the ground, one can expect 3-4 cameras, similar to the I-League coverage where equipment is placed at a high vantage point, behind the goal and near the half-way line.An ISL club official, who spoke to TimesofIndia.com on the condition of anonymity, said that organising the league in multiple cities could dissuade potential bidders. He also reminded that options are limited anyway, as February-March is also the period for the T20 World Cup in India and Sri Lanka, which JioStar will broadcast.The logic is simple: higher viewership means higher sponsorship for clubs and with an inferior product, that Rs 5-6 crore piece of the puzzle is going to take a hit. All clubs are braced for another year of red in their balance sheet. Even though many will cut costs operationally and have reduced player wages, the losses are expected to be three times the normal in the absence of commercial revenue.Like other aspects of the ISL including franchise fees and player salaries, the broadcast rights value also needs to be recalibrated for a healthier future. While this upcoming season can largely be logged as a stop-gap solution-finding exercise, the exercise towards an economically viable product needs to begin now. As ICC and BCCI have found out, mindless pricing of broadcast deals will drive away smaller players in the streaming space. And unlike sports like cricket and kabaddi - whose audience still consumes coverage on linear TV - football's young viewership exists on OTT.Subsequently, if players stay away due to pricing, it will further dwindle AIFF's options. Among the major broadcast players - on linear TV and digital - there are few options outside of JioStar and Sony Sports Network.AIFF's RFP for media rights of the ISL is a 39-page document that lays down the detailed eligibility framework for prospective bidders and specifies the timelines for bids to be submitted, examined and assessed.As per the schedule, the AIFF has fixed January 23 for a pre-bid meeting with interested parties, while any written queries or requests for clarification may be addressed by up to January 27.Bids must be submitted no later than 5:00 pm IST on February 1, with each submission accompanied by a security deposit of Rs. 5 lakh.Eligibility conditions require bidders to be broadcasters or internet operators with a minimum of three years’ operational experience.In addition, bidders must have recorded a net worth of at least Rs. 10 crore in the most recent financial year (2024–25) and an average annual revenue of no less than Rs. 10 crore across the last three completed financial years — 2022–23, 2023–24 and 2024–25.In the case of consortium bids, a maximum of three entities may come together under a special purpose vehicle (SPV). One member must be designated as the ‘Lead member’ and hold at least a 51 percent equity stake in the SPV’s paid-up and subscribed share capital.Each bid will be evaluated in two components — Technical and Financial — carrying weightages of 70 percent and 30 percent respectively. The bidder securing the highest overall score will be awarded the rights for the forthcoming season.","The All India Football Federation (AIFF) floated a Request for Proposal (RFP) tender looking for a broadcast partner for the 2025-26 Indian Super League (ISL) season.

France’s sports minister on Tuesday said the country's government is not considering, as of now, a boycott of the 2026 football World Cup in the United States, despite rising political tensions linked to US President Donald Trump’s remarks on Greenland.""At the moment we are speaking, there is no desire from the ministry to boycott this major, much-anticipated competition,"" sports minister Marina Ferrari told reporters, as cited by news agency Associated Press""That said, I am not prejudging what might happen.""Ferrari said she wants sport to remain separate from politics.""The 2026 World Cup is an extremely important moment for all sports lovers,"" she said.The men’s World Cup is scheduled to begin in June and will be jointly hosted by the United States, Canada and Mexico.

(Image via Getty)



Shedeur Sanders reacts after a late Pro Bowl call-up

Shedeur Sanders did not expect the call. Rookie QBs rarely do, especially ones who started only 7 games and played behind a messy roster. Yet on Jan 27, Sanders found himself packing for San Francisco after learning he would represent the Cleveland Browns at the Pro Bowl Game.For a league still looking for stability, the moment felt unexpected. Cleveland finished 5–12, fired Kevin Stefanski earlier this month, and remains without an HC. Still, Sanders' selection added a rare bright spot to a season filled with hard lessons, criticism, and constant doubt.Shedeur Sanders was added to the AFC Pro Bowl roster as a replacement for Patriots QB Drake Maye, whose team advanced to Super Bowl LX. With Patrick Mahomes and Bo Nix nursing their injuries, the NFL turned to Sanders as the next available option.Speaking before leaving for San Francisco, Sanders addressed his selection in comments shared by Browns beat reporters. ""Thank you, God. I'm beyond excited,"" Sanders said while speaking to the media ahead of team travel. ""Extremely grateful for all the love and support from the coaches, players, and fans. This wouldn't be possible without the support behind me. Still plenty of work to do.""The credentials explain why the selection surprised fans.Sanders appeared in 8 games during the 2025 regular season, starting seven. He finished with 1,400 passing yards, 7 TDs, and 10 interceptions. His completion rate sat at 56.6 per cent. Cleveland went 3–4 in its starts, slightly better than its overall record.Those stats ignited debate across the league. Some folks doubted whether popularity played a role. Sanders entered the NFL with national attention as the son of Pro Football Hall of Fame Deion Sanders. The Browns selected him in the fifth round of the 2025 NFL Draft, and every snap drew focus.The contrast with Maye only sharpened the discussion. Maye threw for 4,394 yards, 31 TDs, and eight interceptions across 17 games. Still, availability rules opened the door, and Sanders walked through it. The honor places Sanders among a short list. He became the 16th quarterback to earn a Pro Bowl selection in his rookie season, a milestone that players like Tom Brady never reached.But analysts across the league do support the young QB. Among them, Skip Bayless is the noticeable voice. He said, ""He's a Pro Bowler to me. On interest detonated, he's a Pro Bowler. On magnetism, on eyeballs, all the things we talked about on this show, people watch Shedeur Sanders.He further added, ""So, for me, the NFL made a shrewd move because ... nobody watches this anyway. It's a dying breed of a game.""Now comes the bigger test. Cleveland continues its HC hunt, with Nate Scheelhaase, Todd Monken, and Jim Schwartz reported as finalists. Sanders fits a pocket-based system that needs protection and rhythm. His Pro Bowl nod changes nothing about that reality, but it does set a higher standard. The Pro Bowl Game take place on Feb. 3 at 8:00 PM ET in San Francisco.","Shedeur Sanders was added to the AFC Pro Bowl roster as a replacement for Patriots QB Drake Maye, whose team advanced to Super Bowl LX.

“What does a guy have to do?”: Bill Belichick issues furious five words after Hall of Fame rejection,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/what-does-a-guy-have-to-do-bill-belichick-issues-furious-five-words-after-hall-of-fame-rejection/articleshow/127669010.cms,"Bill Belichick Hall of Fame snub (Getty Images)

Bill Belichick’s quiet response framed the fallout

For more than two decades, Bill Belichick defined certainty in the NFL. His teams won when it mattered. His preparation became legend. His résumé screamed consistency. Because of that, when the Pro Football Hall of Fame voting opened for the Class of 2026, suspense never entered the conversation. Around the league, first-ballot induction felt inevitable.Instead, certainty gave way to disbelief. When the votes were counted earlier this month, Belichick’s name did not cross the final line. The decision instantly shifted the conversation from accomplishments to standards, raising a larger question about what the Hall values when history and controversy intersect.Earlier in January 2026, the Hall of Fame’s 50-member selection committee met to decide this year’s inductees. To gain entry, a finalist needed at least 40 votes. According to ESPN reporters Seth Wickersham and Don Van Natta Jr., Belichick fell short of that number.As a result, on Jan. 23, 2026, a Hall of Fame representative called Belichick to inform him he would not be inducted this summer in Canton, Ohio. Notably, there was no public rebuttal. No interview. No campaign. Instead, Belichick reacted privately.Later that day, during a personal conversation reported by ESPN, Belichick posed a simple question to an associate. “Six Super Bowls isn’t enough?” He followed it with another. “What does a guy have to do?”That moment carried weight because of its setting. Belichick did not deliver those words at a press event or league function.He said them quietly, underscoring frustration without turning it into a spectacle.Context only deepened the surprise. Belichick, 73, coached the New England Patriots from 2000 to 2023. During that span, he compiled a 333-178 overall record, including postseason play. Only Don Shula won more games in NFL history. His teams captured 17 AFC East titles, nine AFC championships, and six Super Bowls, a level of sustained dominance unmatched in the modern era.Yet despite those numbers, the voting room reopened old debates. According to multiple sources cited by ESPN, discussions repeatedly returned to Spygate and Deflategate. One longtime voter said those incidents influenced several ballots. Another voter said former Colts executive Bill Polian urged members to delay Belichick’s induction as a form of accountability for Spygate. This 2007 scandal resulted in fines and the loss of a first-round draft pick.As news spread, reactions across the league followed quickly. On Wednesday, Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes expressed disbelief on social media, calling the outcome “insane” and questioning how it could have happened.Belichick never joined that debate publicly. Instead, his message stayed rooted in results. Championships. Wins. Longevity. He will remain eligible in 2027. While induction still appears inevitable, the delay already reshaped the conversation. In the end, Belichick did not challenge the Hall. He challenged the standard.","Bill Belichick will not be inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2026.

Aaron Rodgers’ future with Steelers: Mike McCarthy makes clear he wants veteran QB back



Aaron Rodgers’ name dominates conversations in Pittsburgh following the Steelers’ announcement of Mike McCarthy as their new head coach. Rodgers, 42, could return to the NFL under McCarthy, who openly expressed his desire to reunite with the veteran quarterback. “Definitely, I don’t see why you wouldn’t,” McCarthy said when asked if he wants Rodgers on the roster, leaving little doubt about his intentions.The timing of Rodgers’ potential decision adds suspense. While McCarthy has spoken with the quarterback, he emphasized the importance of giving Rodgers space. “Knowing Aaron long enough, going through seasons, I think when players…they need time to step away and decompress. I think that’s very important,” McCarthy explained, signaling patience in awaiting a response.Aaron Rodgers’ presence could serve as a bridge quarterback for the Steelers, guiding young talent like sixth-round pick Will Howard or a 2026 rookie. The 2025 season highlighted Rodgers’ mentoring abilities, particularly with Howard, showing his investment in developing future stars. His experience offers Pittsburgh both leadership and a reliable hand while the team eyes the 2027 quarterback class.Team president Art Rooney II reinforced this approach, stating, “We’ve left the door open” for Rodgers, underscoring the Steelers’ interest in a potential reunion. Rodgers’ 2025 season was solid but not MVP-level, with highlights including late-season wins over the Ravens and a key comeback to secure the AFC North. Despite a tough playoff loss to Houston, Rodgers hinted at openness to returning. “Whenever the season ends, I’ll be a free agent, so that will give me a lot of options, if I still want to play…there’ll be options, I would think maybe one or two if I decide I still want to play. ”The Steelers also face a shifting quarterback draft landscape. Once promising, the 2026 class has thinned, leaving top prospects Fernando Mendoza and Ty Simpson with limited experience. This context makes Rodgers’ potential return more strategic for Pittsburgh, offering stability while younger QBs develop.McCarthy’s history with Rodgers adds emotional weight. The duo won Super Bowl XLV together, and McCarthy’s remarks at his introductory press conference captured a personal connection. “Pittsburgh is my world,” he said, signaling a blend of professional ambition and personal loyalty.For now, the NFL world watches and waits. Rodgers’ decision could shape Pittsburgh’s immediate future and impact the broader quarterback landscape, leaving fans and analysts eager for clarity in the coming weeks.","Aaron Rodgers could return to the NFL under Mike McCarthy.

(Image via Getty)

Brian Daboll’s net worth reflects promise, volatility, and a short Giants tenure

John Harbaugh’s net worth shows what sustained winning and leverage really buy

NFL head coaching money usually follows one rule. Stability pays more than potential. In 2026, Brian Daboll and John Harbaugh are proof of that gap.Daboll, once seen as a rising offensive mind in New York, exits the Giants with a modest net worth and an unfinished rebuild on his résumé. Harbaugh leaves Baltimore after 18 seasons with a Super Bowl ring, nine-figure leverage, and another massive contract already waiting. Same profession. Very different financial outcomes.Brian Daboll’s net worth sits between $9 million and $12 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth, built almost entirely through coaching salaries rather than endorsements or outside ventures. That figure reflects both his late rise and how quickly his New York tenure ended.Hired by the Giants in 2022, Daboll signed a five-year deal valued between $25 million and $30 million, averaging roughly $5 million per year. His first season justified the investment. New York went 9-7-1, reached the playoffs, and won its first postseason game in 11 years. Daboll was named Associated Press NFL Coach of the Year.The momentum did not last. The Giants collapsed to 3-14 in 2024, and despite ownership publicly backing his vision, the regression defined his legacy more than the breakout year.On Nov. 10, 2025, New York fired Daboll, cutting short what was supposed to be a long-term rebuild.Financially, Daboll never reached the elite coaching tier. His value was tied to scheme, quarterback development, and upside rather than longevity. Even with multiple Super Bowl rings from earlier assistant roles and his work developing Josh Allen in Buffalo, his earnings remained in the middle class of NFL head coaches.Daboll’s future value now hinges on what comes next. A coordinator reset could rebuild credibility. Another head coaching job would require trust from an organization willing to bet on rebound rather than résumé.John Harbaugh enters 2026 with an estimated $50 million net worth, and that number is about to rise. His wealth reflects something Daboll never had time to build: institutional trust.Harbaugh spent 18 seasons as the Baltimore Ravens head coach, compiling a 180-113 regular-season record, 13 playoff appearances, and a Super Bowl XLVII championship. His consistency allowed him to renegotiate from a position of strength. By the time Baltimore fired him on Jan. 6, 2026, Harbaugh was earning $12 million annually, placing him among the NFL’s highest-paid coaches.The firing itself worked in Harbaugh’s favor. Reports indicated he and his agent insisted on being formally fired rather than “mutually parting ways,” triggering a fully guaranteed payout worth $55 million on his final Ravens contract.That leverage carried directly into his next job. After a competitive 2026 hiring cycle, Harbaugh agreed to become the New York Giants’ next head coach on a massive deal. NFL insider Ian Rapoport reported, “The Giants and new coach John Harbaugh have now agreed upon and finalized the five-year deal for Harbaugh to be the new coach, per The Insiders. Done and done. First opening filled.”NFL insider Jordan Schultz later reported the contract is expected to be worth around $100 million over five years, giving Harbaugh a projected $20 million annual average value, tied with Andy Reid as the highest-paid head coach in the league.Harbaugh’s net worth also benefits from timing. New York offers increased media exposure, potential endorsements, and post-coaching opportunities that Baltimore never provided at the same scale. His résumé buys patience. His history buys money.","Brian Daboll’s net worth sits between $9 million and $12 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth.

Ann Michael Maye reflects the Patriots’ family spirit



Drake Maye's wife Ann Michael Maye stepped into the spotlight long before the confetti settled, turning a cold night of football into a warm moment fans could feel. As the Patriots clinched their Super Bowl LX berth, celebration did not stay locked inside the locker room. It spilled into living rooms across social media, led by the people who live every snap with the players.That emotion came alive when Ann Michael Maye and Parker Henry, wife of tight end Hunter Henry, shared a playful TikTok dance. It felt unscripted and honest. The clip did not chase perfection. It captured relief, pride, and the joy that follows months of pressure. Fans saw the Patriots win through a personal lens, one filled with laughter and shared excitement.The timing of the dance mattered. Earlier that day, New England leaned on composure and grit. On a tense third down with five yards needed, Drake Maye trusted his instincts. He kept the ball, surged ahead for seven yards at Empower Field at Mile High, and shifted the game’s fate.

Travis Kelce retirement decision and the Chiefs’ delicate wait



Travis Kelce retirement decision sits at the center of Kansas City’s offseason, shaping conversations from the front office to the locker room. As the Chiefs look toward 2026, the question is not only whether Kelce can still play, but whether he wants to keep pushing his body after more than a decade of elite football. For the franchise, his choice carries weight beyond numbers on a stat sheet. It touches leadership, identity, and timing at a fragile moment.Kansas City enters this offseason in transition. A 6–11 finish, a rare playoff absence, and uncertainty around Patrick Mahomes’ recovery have shifted the tone around a team used to dominance. Yet even in decline, Kelce remained a steady presence. His 851 yards and five touchdowns in 2025 came in a turbulent year, one that demanded resilience more than fireworks. That context explains why the Chiefs are treading carefully, letting respect guide urgency.Owner Clark Hunt left little doubt about where the organization stands.“As an organization, we certainly hope that he will come back,” Hunt said Tuesday on Good Morning Football. “He had another great year, maybe not on par with where he was four or five years ago, but still had over 800 yards, and was really one of the leaders on the offensive side of the ball for us.So there's no doubt in my mind that he can still play. We're trying to be respectful and let him have the time that he needs to make a decision.“He has sort of a busy offseason coming up with his engagement and marriage, so we want to be respectful and give him the time he needs to make a decision. But we certainly hope that he'll be back.”Those words reflect more than optimism. They signal trust built over 13 seasons. Kelce, now 36, understands the cost of that mileage. He admitted earlier this year that he needs to see how his body responds before committing again. The timing matters. With the draft approaching and roster planning underway, clarity would help. Still, Kansas City appears willing to wait.There are hints pulling Kelce back. The return of Eric Bieniemy, a coach who helped shape his prime, clearly resonates.“I can't wait to see him back in the building,” Kelce said. “He's one of my favorite coaches of all-time, one of my favorite people of all time. I've had so many unbelievable growing moments under him as a player, as a person, and I just love the guy and it's going to be awesome to see him back in the building and see him back wearing the Chiefs logo, baby.”For now, the door stays open. Whether Kelce walks through it again depends on health, heart, and how much fight he feels remains.","Travis Kelce's retirement decision sits at the center of Kansas City’s offseason.

Sign this or don’t come: Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift reportedly silence wedding guests with strict NDAs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/sign-this-or-dont-come-travis-kelce-and-taylor-swift-reportedly-silence-wedding-guests-with-strict-ndas/articleshow/127660750.cms,"Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce’s upcoming wedding is drawing attention for its intense secrecy rather than its details. Guests are reportedly required to sign multiple non disclosure agreements, highlighting the couple’s push for total privacy. The move has sparked debate, with fans split over whether the strict rules protect their personal moment or reflect excessive celebrity control.

Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce turn their wedding into a legal fortress

Rumors around Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce ’s wedding have taken a sharp turn toward secrecy, and not because of an official date or location. Instead, the spotlight has landed on the strict legal boundaries reportedly surrounding the guest list. Multiple non disclosure agreements are said to be part of the invitation process, signaling just how controlled the event is expected to be.For a couple living under constant global attention, privacy is no longer optional. It is a strategy. Swift’s cultural reach and Kelce’s NFL stardom have turned even small personal moments into public spectacles. That reality appears to be shaping every layer of their wedding planning, from who attends to what can be shared afterward.The most revealing detail came not from Swift or Kelce, but from a familiar television voice.Veteran host Graham Norton confirmed he has already signed multiple NDAs, fueling speculation about the scale of the event. Speaking on his podcast, he shut down questions with a laugh and a legal reminder.“Ah, lovely Taylor Swift. I can say nothing. I've signed so many NDAs,” he said.When his co host teased him about attending, Norton doubled down on the secrecy.“Right, over my husband's dead body.”That level of caution reflects more than celebrity excess. For Swift, NDAs help prevent leaks, unauthorized photos, and viral moments that could hijack the day. For Kelce, one of the most recognizable faces of the Kansas City Chiefs, the risks are amplified by nonstop sports media coverage.Swift previously hinted at the wedding’s size during an appearance on The Graham Norton Show, joking with Norton and confirming the celebration would be anything but small. She has also explained why large guest lists feel less stressful to her, saying she wants to avoid putting people “on the bubble.”The couple became engaged last August after more than two years together. Swift later called the proposal “perfect,” with a custom ring designed by Kindred Lubeck featuring an Old Mine Brilliant Cut diamond.While rumors suggest a possible June 2026 date, planning may be on pause as Kelce weighs his NFL future. One thing seems certain. If you attend this wedding, silence is part of the dress code.","Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce's wedding is drawing attention for its intense secrecy rather than its details.

"Who is Joe Brady’s wife? Meet Lauren Brady, the woman stepping into focus after Bills’ surprise head coaching move",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/who-is-joe-bradys-wife-meet-lauren-brady-the-woman-stepping-into-focus-after-bills-surprise-head-coaching-move/articleshow/127663860.cms,"Joe Brady’s Wife Lauren (Instagram)

Who is Joe Brady’s wife Lauren Brady ?



Who is Joe Brady’s wife is suddenly a question many Buffalo Bills fans are asking, as the franchise turns a new page with a bold coaching decision. The Bills went inside the building to replace Sean McDermott, handing the job to offensive coordinator Joe Brady. The move signals urgency after seven straight playoff exits and no Super Bowl trips. At just 36, Brady represents a shift in philosophy, youth, and energy. With the spotlight now fixed on him, attention has naturally widened to include the person closest to him off the field.Brady steps into the role after four seasons with Buffalo, including three running an offense that was never the weak link. Even in a crushing 33-30 divisional playoff loss to Denver, the unit delivered 30 points. Now trusted with the entire operation, Brady begins his head coaching journey backed by a quarterback he knows well in Josh Allen, and by a steady presence at home.Joe Brady is married to Lauren Brady, formerly Lauren Bateman, and her story carries its own weight. The couple tied the knot on June 25, 2022, in a winery setting in Carmel Valley, California, after several years of dating and an engagement in June 2021. They are now parents to two young children, a son born in April 2023 and a daughter welcomed in late 2025.Lauren’s professional path has been anything but linear. In her early 20s, she built health and fitness websites and earned about $4,000 a month, until a sudden Google algorithm change wiped out the business. She pivoted to teaching music, only to find the workload draining and unsustainable. Determined to regain control, she moved into helping others grow businesses and even opened two commercial teaching locations. Then 2020 hit, and government shutdowns erased 35 percent of her revenue.Instead of folding, Lauren adapted again. She leaned fully into online music education, posting her first guitar video on YouTube in 2017. Early feedback was rough, but persistence paid off. By April 2020, her online guitar courses generated $16,000 in a single month. That year ended with $120,000 in total revenue from courses and advertising. Today, her business reportedly brings in between $65,000 and $150,000 each month, supported by more than 600,000 subscribers and over 50 million views.As Joe Brady takes on the biggest job of his career, Lauren’s resilience mirrors the mindset Buffalo hopes will finally carry the Bills to the sport’s highest stage.","Joe Brady is married to Lauren Brady, formerly Lauren Bateman.

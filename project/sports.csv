'We got desperate': Rohit Sharma on what clicked at 2025 Champions Trophy

Poll Should Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli participate in domestic tournaments to prove their commitment for the 2027 World Cup? Yes, it's essential for their selection No, they have proven themselves already Only if the selectors request it Unsure, depends on their form

NEW DELHI: Former India spinner Ravichandran Ashwin has weighed in on the recent debates surrounding Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli ’s future in the ODI setup, supporting the BCCI and selection committee’s decisions while urging the senior batters to prove their seriousness for the 2027 World Cup through domestic tournaments.Speaking on his YouTube channel, Ashwin acknowledged Rohit’s achievements as captain, having led India to the 2024 T20 World Cup and the 2025 Champions Trophy, but noted the selectors’ primary considerations were long-term planning and form sustainability.“There is nothing debatable to speak about Rohit's captaincy. But is he the direction for the 2027 World Cup? That will be the question asked by the selection committee and the coach. They obviously had a discussion, and two things might have emerged: one, Kohli and Rohit are not in our 2027 World Cup plans; two, if they are indeed included, can they maintain their form until the ICC tournament in 2027? Both are big questions,” Ashwin explained.The veteran bowler suggested that participation in India A series or the Vijay Hazare Trophy would allow the duo to regain rhythm and signal their commitment.“If you need their services, you have to find a way… you must give them the opportunity. If you have given them the chance and they said no, then it is clear. If the selector or the coach has told you that I want you to play this series, not for selection purposes, but only to get into the rhythm. It is only to show that they are serious about playing,” he said.Ashwin also emphasised that selectors wouldn’t dismiss Rohit or Virat lightly, acknowledging their experience. “I don't think any selector or coach will have the heart to say that Virat and Rohit's services are no longer needed… You cannot go leading up to the World Cup with so many question marks,” he said.On the ODI captaincy change, Ashwin backed Shubman Gill’s appointment, explaining the rationale: “The selectors might say that if Rohit remains captain and he is unfit in 2026, we will not have enough time to groom a new leader. From a selection perspective, they have taken a rational decision.”Ashwin’s comments underline a pragmatic approach: balancing respect for cricketing legends while ensuring India’s long-term World Cup strategy remains on track, with domestic performances serving as a key indicator of commitment and form.",Former India spinner Ravichandran Ashwin has weighed in on the recent debates surrounding Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli’s future in the ODI setup.

'We got desperate': Rohit Sharma on what clicked at 2025 Champions Trophy

Poll Do you think Mohammed Shami should have been selected for the Australia tour? Yes, he deserves a chance No, he needs to prove himself more

NEW DELHI: India pacer Mohammed Shami has once again been overlooked for the national squad, this time for India’s upcoming tour of Australia starting October 19. The 35-year-old, who last played in the 2025 Champions Trophy, has been struggling with fitness issues, though he has remained active in the IPL and domestic cricket for Bengal.Breaking his silence on the non-selection, Shami addressed the rumors and speculation on his YouTube channel.“People want to know my opinion on the non-selection for the Australia series. I will just say that getting selected is not in my hands; it's the job of the selection committee, coach, and captain. If they feel I should be there, they will select me, or if they feel some more time is needed, it's in their hands. I am ready and practicing,” he said.Shami also assured fans that his fitness is in top shape, adding: “My fitness is also good. I will try to do better because when you are away from the ground, you need to remain motivated. I played in the Duleep Trophy. I felt very comfortable, my rhythm was good, and I bowled around 35 overs. There are no issues with my fitness.”Despite Shami’s confidence, former India batter Aakash Chopra questioned his chances of returning to the national team, citing his lack of recent match practice.“I feel it won’t be good because if his name has not come now, the chances of his name coming in India are very less in any case… He is playing domestic cricket and he has asked people why they are after him if he wants to play, and that is absolutely fine,” Chopra said.Chopra acknowledged Shami’s talent but noted the veteran pacer has fallen behind in the race for India’s fast-bowling spots.“His name can come, but the chances have become very less, unless there is an incredible IPL,” he added.For now, Shami’s international future remains uncertain. His best path back appears to be strong performances in domestic cricket and the upcoming IPL 2026, which could provide the selectors with the confidence to recall him to the Indian team.","Mohammed Shami has been overlooked for India's upcoming tour of Australia.

Rohit Sharma sacked as ODI captain, Shubman Gill to take over from Australia ODIs

Poll Do you think India can continue their dominance without Ravichandran Ashwin? Yes, they have a strong squad. No, Ashwin's absence is significant.

NEW DELHI: Former India spin legend Ravichandran Ashwin was a notable absence during India’s dominant innings-and-140-run win over the West Indies in the first Test at the Narendra Modi Stadium, Ahmedabad. It was the first home Test without the ace spinner since 2010, as Team India fielded a spin trio of Kuldeep Yadav, Ravindra Jadeja , and Washington Sundar.After the victory, Ravindra Jadeja, who starred with four wickets and a century, admitted that he missed having Ashwin alongside him.“Obviously, we miss him. Ash has contributed so much to Indian cricket for so many years. He has been a match-winner. Playing a Test in India without Ash, somewhere it feels Ash would bowl now, but then the realisation comes that he is not there,” Jadeja said.In a lighthearted yet affectionate response, Ashwin told Jadeja not to dwell on his absence — after all, his presence might have meant fewer wickets for the all-rounder.“If I was playing, I would have taken 2-3 wickets from the ones he took, so he should not be missing me. Jitna faayda hai utna lena chahiye (He should capitalise on whatever there is). He is becoming a bona fide legend of Test cricket, I am really happy for him,” Ashwin said on his YouTube channel.Ashwin also acknowledged the challenges Jadeja faces in guiding a largely new Indian Test side.“After hearing his comments, I know that he is showing affection, but more than anything else, I don’t think he has anyone to talk to now. All of them are new boys. There used to be small talk between us, and when you reach a level of super seniority, you have to think before making small talk to the youngsters. He must be thinking whether the youngsters would judge him, but if Ash was here he will not judge. When Puji retired, I felt the same, we used to sit together,” Ashwin added.India’s Test squad has undergone a major overhaul recently, with Ashwin, Cheteshwar Pujara, Virat Kohli , and Rohit Sharma announcing retirements in quick succession.Ashwin’s playful yet heartfelt remarks highlight not just his camaraderie with teammates but also the continuity of excellence in Team India, even as legends step away from the field.","Ravichandran Ashwin was a notable absence during India’s dominant innings- and-140-run win over the West Indies in the first Test at the Narendra Modi Stadium, Ahmedabad.

Shubman Gill named India's new ODI captain, replaces Rohit Sharma ahead of Australia series

Poll Do you agree with the BCCI's decision to appoint Shubman Gill as the new ODI captain? Yes, it's a great choice. No, I prefer Rohit Sharma.

NEW DELHI: Veteran India pacer Mohammed Shami has thrown his full support behind Shubman Gill ’s appointment as India’s new ODI captain, urging fans to stop the online criticism and memes surrounding the change in leadership. The BCCI ’s bold move to replace Rohit Sharma with Gill, 26, marks a generational shift aimed at building a team for the 2027 ODI World Cup.The decision, though strategic, sparked heated debates and a flood of memes on social media — with many questioning the timing of the change, given that Rohit led India to glory in the 2025 Champions Trophy, where he was also the Player of the Match in the final against New Zealand.Shami, however, believes the selectors and management made the right call. Speaking on his YouTube channel, he said: “Bahut hi zyada memes ban rahe hai is sawal ko leke. (There have been a lot of memes on this question.) I feel there should not be any objection. This is the decision of the BCCI, selectors and coaches. Shubman captained India in England, and he is the skipper of the Gujarat Titans as well. So, he has the experience. Someone had to be given this responsibility, and the BCCI chose Shubman Gill for that, so we should accept it.”The 35-year-old pacer also reminded fans that captaincy is never permanent in cricket, and that transitions are part of the natural cycle of the game.“People should not raise questions over the captaincy. This is not in our hands. Someone is the captain today, and there will be someone else tomorrow. This cycle will continue,” Shami said.Shami himself missed out on the upcoming Australia ODI series, with the selectors preferring Harshit Rana, Mohammed Siraj, Arshdeep Singh and Prasidh Krishna in the pace attack. Yet, the Bengal veteran remains focused on his domestic commitments, set to spearhead Bengal’s bowling in the Ranji Trophy 2025-26 season starting October 15.As debates rage on over India’s captaincy shuffle, Shami’s message is clear — it’s time to move past memes and stand behind the new leader, as Shubman Gill begins a new chapter in Indian cricket.","Mohammed Shami has thrown his full support behind Shubman Gill's appointment as India's new ODI captain.

'Jay Shah Deserves Credit for How He Ran BCCI' | Arun Dhumal on BCCI’s Commitment & Leadership

Poll Do you think the BCCI should be allowed to refer to its players as 'Team India'? Yes, they represent the country. No, they are a private body.

NEW DELHI: The Delhi High Court on Wednesday came down heavily on a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) seeking to restrain the Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ) from referring to its players as the “Indian cricket team”, dismissing the plea as a “sheer wastage” of judicial time.A Division Bench of Chief Justice Devendra Kumar Upadhyaya and Justice Tushar Rao Gedela rebuked the petitioner, advocate Reepak Kansal, who argued that since the BCCI is a private body and not a government-recognised sports federation, it has no authority to call its side “Team India.”The court was quick to reject this line of reasoning.“Are you saying the team doesn’t represent India? This team, which is going everywhere and representing India, you are saying they don’t represent India? Is it not Team India ? If it is not Team India, please tell us why is it not Team India,” Justice Gedela questioned sharply.Chief Justice Upadhyaya was equally firm, calling the petition a frivolous use of court time.“It is sheer wastage of the court’s time and your own time. Tell us about a national team in any sport that is selected by government officials. Whether it’s the Commonwealth Games, Olympics, hockey, football, or tennis — are they not representing India?”Kansal’s PIL claimed that the BCCI, registered under the Tamil Nadu Societies Registration Act, is not a statutory body or a “State” under Article 12 of the Constitution.It further alleged that referring to the team as “India” or using the national flag violated the Emblems and Names (Prevention of Improper Use) Act, 1950 and the Flag Code of India, 2002.However, the Bench dismissed these claims, observing that using the flag or national name for representation in sports does not amount to misuse.“If you want to unfurl a flag in your house, are you prohibited from doing so?” the court remarked.The judges also noted that international sports bodies like the International Olympic Committee (IOC) discourage government interference in sports administration.Ultimately, the court dismissed the PIL, reaffirming that India’s cricket team — regardless of BCCI’s private status — represents the nation in every sense.",Delhi High Court dismisses a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) seeking to restrain the Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ) from referring to its players as the “Indian cricket team” PIL claimed that the BCCI is not a statutory body or a “State” under Article 12 of the Constitution.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124401938,imgsize-133946,width-400,resizemode-4/team-india.jpg"

Rohit Sharma sacked as ODI captain, Shubman Gill to take over from Australia ODIs

Poll Do you think Rohit Sharma's fitness will impact his performance in the upcoming series against Australia? Yes, a leaner physique will enhance his game No, fitness doesn’t guarantee results It might have a minimal effect

NEW DELHI: Mumbai witnessed a glittering evening on Tuesday as the 27th edition of the CEAT Cricket Rating Awards honoured cricketers and former stars from across the globe. While the event recognised excellence in cricket, it was former India captain Rohit Sharma and his wife Ritika Sajdeh who captured the hearts of fans with their endearing moments throughout the night.Rohit, who received a special recognition award from cricketing legend Sunil Gavaskar , made his first public appearance since being removed as India’s ODI captain ahead of the upcoming series in Australia. Known for his charm and cricketing prowess, the swashbuckling batter looked leaner, fitter, and more determined than ever, sending a subtle message to selectors that he remains ready for international duty.However, beyond the glitz and glamour, it was the lovebirds’ interactions that stole the limelight. Rohit was spotted sharing affectionate chats and playful smiles with Ritika while seated at the table, even reacting to a mimicry act by Shaarang Shringarpure, who performed impressions of Dhoni, Morrison, and Ponting. Fans quickly noticed the duo’s chemistry, and visuals of them enjoying the evening together have already gone viral on social media.During the ceremony, Rohit also spoke about the upcoming ODI series against Australia, where he will feature alongside Virat Kohli despite relinquishing the captaincy to Shubman Gill . “I love playing against them. I love going to Australia. It's a very challenging country to play cricket. People there love the game as well,” he said. He added, “But certainly, Australia is a different challenge every time they have played against us. Having been there now several times, I do understand what to expect. Hopefully we can go there and do what the Indian team is supposed to do and get the result in our favour. ”Amid the awards, glimmering lights, and cricketing tributes, it was the warmth between Rohit and Ritika that resonated most with fans, reminding everyone that behind every great cricketer is a supportive partner sharing every triumph, smile, and moment of joy.",The 27th edition of the CEAT Cricket Rating Awards honoured cricketers and former stars from across the globe.

Thoda afsos hai

Poll Do you believe it's worth moving abroad for better opportunities in sports? Absolutely Maybe Not sure No

NEW DELHI: Being away from home never gets easier. Every day, you stand in front of the mirror, wondering what your family is doing. The pain doesn’t fade, it quietly settles in. Your mother’s warmth becomes a few seconds of buffering on a video call, and your father? He watches silently from the sidelines.No one leaves home because it is easy. They leave because it is necessary. For better opportunities, better facilities, and a better chance at chasing a dream that refuses to let go. As Tony Stark says in ""Iron Man"", ""Sometimes you gotta run before you can walk.""For Indian basketball player Arvinder Singh , it doesn't stop at running; it’s about dribbling, defending, diving for every rebound, and keeping his balance not just on the court, but in life. And right now, he’s doing that not in India, but in Japan, thousands of kilometres away from his home in Barnala, Punjab.(I feel alone sometimes),” he tellsfrom Yamaguchi, his home away from home. “But I train every day, listen to music, go to the gym. That keeps me occupied.”It has been only a few weeks since he landed at Yamaguchi in Japan. Playing for Yamaguchi Patsfive in the Japanese B3 League, the Punjabi boy is leading a life that is simple, but lonely.“I cook for myself. Since I’m a vegetarian, it’s difficult to find veg food here. So I watch YouTube, try to make roti and sabzi myself. Sometimes my mom guides me on call,” he says, with a small laugh, somewhat suggesting that scoring a three-pointer is much easier than making a perfectly round roti.But this is what chasing dreams looks like when your home country doesn’t offer you one. India, despite producing players of immense potential, still doesn’t have a stable basketball league.“It’s tough. Leagues start in India but don’t continue regularly,” Arvinder says. “If we had regular matches and exposure trips, we would all be better players. That’s how we improve. Since that’s not happening in India right now, I accepted this offer from Japan to play here and develop my game further.”His comments, though, are not an epitome of frustration but merely a representation of muted disappointment, the kind that comes from knowing what could have been.Arvinder, now 23, has always been one of India’s most promising players.A product of Ludhiana Basketball Academy (LBA) in Ludhiana, which has been a cradle for budding Indian cagers. Growing up, he was a shotputter untill he turned 13 and a LBA coach Rajinder Singh, spotted him and requested his father, an assistant sub-inspector (ASI) in Punjab police to thrust the boy in basketball. And within a year, Arvinder was drafted in NBA academy in Greater Noida.The 23-year-old was also part of the Indian team that beat Kazakhstan, India's first in 27 years, in the FIBA Asia Cup Qualifiers last year. But the team couldn’t sustain the momentum in the main tournament as they finished winless in the Asia Cup earlier this year.“We lacked experience,” he explains. “All their players play in professional leagues regularly. Playing consistently against tough opponents gives them exposure. Their game vision and court awareness improve naturally.”It’s this understanding that brought him to Japan.But it’s not easy to fit in.“I’ve been here for weeks,” he admits. “Coaches and players mostly speak Japanese. But we have a translator who helps. A few Japanese players also speak English, so they help too. You also learn a lot from body language, and we use signs and gestures on court to communicate plays.”He laughs, but there’s a trace of fatigue under his smile. Loneliness is a quiet companion here.What hurts more, though, is the possibility that he might miss representing India this time in the World Cup qualifiers in November as a result of playing basketball in Japan. His Japanese club is against the idea of releasing him.“There’s a chance I’ll miss it,” he admits softly. “Our league runs for seven months, and the Japanese staff are very strict. Even if I want to go, I’d need to leave a month early for the national camp. The selection happens after the camp. If we skip it, we lose our spot. Going to India isn't possible right now.”Then, after a pause, he adds, “(It hurts a little). Playing for India is always special.”Still, he doesn’t sound defeated: “If you perform well abroad, you’ll always get your chance in the national team. I believe in that. I believe in myself.”For Indian basketball, nevertheless, some hope is left. The Basketball Federation of India, along with ACG Sports, has announced the country’s first-ever professional basketball league, set to begin in 2026.When Arvinder talks about it, his voice suddenly picks up hope: “That’s a big step. It’ll help players a lot. It’ll help the game grow. We’ve waited for this for so long.”And then, when asked what basketball means to him, he smiles. You can hear it in his tone.“Basketball has given me everything. Exposure, a job, a purpose. My parents are happy that through basketball, I’ve found my path and that I’m making the country proud,” adds Arvinder, who represents Railways in nationals.Somewhere between the bouncing of the ball and the silence of an empty apartment in Japan, Arvinder Singh is learning what it really means to ""run before you can walk"".ALSO READ: Exclusive | 'I tried to live as a man but couldn't': First-ever trans chess player to reach WIM, now French women's champion","Arvinder Singh is one of India's most promising basketball players.

Former India batting coach Vikram Rathour

Dhruv Jurel (PTI Photo)

'Meticulous' is the word which former India batting coach Vikram Rathour generously uses when he talks about Dhruv Jurel. Rathour has seen the 24-year-old closely — first in the Indian dressing room and then with the Rajasthan Royals (RR) in the Indian Premier League ( IPL ).“Great work ethic. Very sincere guy. Nice kid. Very nice to speak to. Understands his cricket. Very intelligent as far as his game is concerned,” Rathour says in a freewheeling chat withabout Jurel.Jurel had played only 15 first-class matches, with a highest score of 249 against a weak Nagaland side. But there was something about him that caught the eye of the Indian selection panel, headed by Ajit Agarkar, and he received his maiden call-up. Rishabh Pant was still recovering from a horrific car accident, KS Bharat played the first two Tests against England, and then in Rajkot, Jurel got his chance.“Rajkot was the first time I saw him play. And then in Ranchi, he played a fantastic knock, that partnership with Kuldeep (Yadav) was phenomenal. In that series, a couple of knocks he played were incredible. The chase in Ranchi is something I will always remember. It was difficult conditions, we were under pressure, and the series was on the line,” recalls Rathour.Jurel burst onto the scene during the 2020 Under-19 World Cup and then had a breakthrough campaign as a finisher in IPL 2023.But Rathour explains how adapting to the longer format wasn’t an easy transition.“In that England series, he showed great temperament and great technique. Somebody who I could see wants to work hard. He kept pushing for more batting, more batting. Even before the start of the day, he wanted to come early and bat in the nets. And then I got the chance to work with him at RR as well. He’s somebody who has really good technique, a great mindset, and works very hard on his game,” says Rathour.Rathour feels Jurel’s wicketkeeping is as good as former India gloveman Wriddhiman Saha’s. One of the coaches, who wished to not be named, has worked with Jurel from his formative years agrees.“Jurel is unbelievable. He is at Saha’s level. He is a next-level keeper. Against spin, he is probably the best keeper in India. And against fast bowling, he is absolutely unbelievable,” the coach tells TimesofIndia.com.“At the trials, I got him confused with Aryan Juyal. I had to see his video again. He hit an inside-out shot over covers and I was sold,” says the coach.“Honestly, whether it was Sanju Samson all those years ago, or Riyan Parag and Yashasvi Jaiswal recently. All of them I picked based on one shot. I can remember the shots even today. Jaiswal came in and flicked the first ball over fine leg. Riyan Parag hit a six over mid-wicket. Sanju pulled the first ball for a six in Jaipur. That shot Jurel hit showed the spark in him. The rest of the innings was okay, not outstanding, but that shot stayed in my head,” he adds.Talegaon is a small village about 100 kilometres from Nagpur, in Maharashtra’s Wardha district, a region often mentioned for its distressing farmer suicide rates. The only trace of industry here involves crafting iron goods such as knives, daggers, and kitchen tools.From this unlikely setting, where Rajasthan Royals have their training base, where the RR coaches helped shape one of India’s brightest young stars. Jurel spent countless weeks and months in Talegaon, sharpening his skills much like the blades the village is known for.“Jurel was completely different. We had to change everything. The good thing was that we started from scratch because we had the time, he wasn’t playing in the side, so we could completely restructure him,” says the coach.“You see his back-lift, how he takes the first step in his pre-movement, everything has been meticulously planned.“It was planned for a proper three years. For example, even when he came into the Indian side and almost scored a hundred against England in Ranchi, three days before that Test, he was at our academy. We set up this practice session for him where he batted for 130 overs in two hours and twenty minutes.“We still talk about that. He says, ‘Sir, no one believes me that I’ve done this much.’ I told him to leave it, only he knows how much he improved in that one session. He went from 50–60% to 80%,” he recalls.Like Rathour, one of Jurel's coaches praises the 24-year-old's work ethic, his hunger for improvement, and compares his temperament to Rahul Dravid’s.“His work ethic is out of this world. He can just keep going. He reminds me of Rahul Dravid with that level of discipline. He’ll keep batting for hours,” he says.In the ongoing West Indies series, Jurel got another chance as Rishabh Pant was yet to recover from his injury, and the Agra lad grabbed the opportunity with both hands, slamming his maiden Test century at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad.Before the series, he had an incredible outing against Australia A, scoring 140, 1, and 56. In the first innings of the second match in Lucknow, he was trapped for 1 by pacer Henry Thornton.“Oh my god. He had to address that issue that very evening. He called, panicking ‘I’m not able to do this, I’m not able to do that.’ He’s an emotional chap; I deal with him very carefully. We addressed all those issues that day itself. I said, we can’t let this happen again.“So, we made some technical changes. There’s a lot of releasing of the back foot that he does now. If you see him playing straight or on the on-side, he keeps releasing the back foot into the ball. That helps him play shots down the ground, through mid-wicket and square leg — anywhere from mid-on to square leg. By releasing the back foot, he gets into a beautiful position. It’s something Sachin Tendulkar used to do when hitting down the ground. Sachin would always release that back foot beautifully. Not many people can do that,” explains the coach.The coach says Jurel keeps him on his toes all the time. “He asks difficult questions, a proper cricket nerd.”“He has an insane work ethic, and it’s helped him become the readymade product he is now. He’s putting in the work — morning, noon, and night. He doesn’t leave anything.“He’ll call all the time ‘Sir, is this okay? Is that okay?’ He keeps sending videos. In terms of the meticulous way he prepares, he’s the number one guy. Others check when something goes wrong, but he checks even when he’s done well. His video will come,” he says.With India going through a transition and the middle order far from settled, Jurel could be a solid middle-order option, with Pant donning the gloves.“Who knows, I think somebody like Jurel is good enough to play even as a batter in Tests,” says a confident Rathour.Jurel has every attribute to carve a space for himself purely as a batter — and as a keeper, he’s a superman, among the very best in the business.",Dhruv Jurel has been called up to the India squad for the first Test against West Indies.

Rohit Sharma removed as India ODI captain, a glorious era comes to an end

Poll Do you think Rohit Sharma is ready to make a strong comeback in international cricket? Yes, absolutely! Not sure, let's wait and see.

Rohit Sharma (R) with Shreyas Iyer and Sanju Samson

NEW DELHI: Former India captain Rohit Sharma made his first public appearance since being stripped of the ODI captaincy — and he did it in trademark style. Attending the 27th edition of the CEAT Cricket Rating Awards in Mumbai on Tuesday, Rohit looked leaner, fitter, and more determined than ever, sending a strong message to selectors that he remains ready for the international stage.The veteran opener, who led India to two successive ICC titles — the 2024 T20 World Cup and the 2025 Champions Trophy earlier this year — stole the spotlight at the glitzy event. Receiving a special recognition award from Sunil Gavaskar , Rohit charmed fans and experts alike with his renewed energy and physical transformation.Rohit’s fitness has often been a talking point, with critics quick to scrutinise his appearance. But on Tuesday night, the 38-year-old looked in peak form — slim, sharp, and confident — a clear statement of intent to those questioning his readiness.Having shed noticeable weight, Rohit’s transformation was evident as he interacted warmly with fans and the media. His focus, however, remained on cricket. “I love playing against them. I love going to Australia. It's a very challenging country to play cricket. People there love the game as well,” Rohit said about the upcoming ODI series starting October 19.He added, “Australia is a different challenge every time they have played against us. Having been there now several times, I do understand what to expect. Hopefully we can go there and do what the Indian team is supposed to do and get the result in our favour.”Despite losing the ODI captaincy to Shubman Gill , Rohit’s words and presence exuded the confidence of a player far from done. The veteran, who guided India to two unbeaten ICC campaigns, now eyes another successful tour Down Under — one that could reaffirm his place in India’s long-term plans ahead of the 2027 ODI World Cup.","Former India captain Rohit Sharma made his first public appearance since being stripped of the ODI captaincy.

Poll What do you think about the confrontation between Prithvi Shaw and Musheer Khan during the warm-up match? It was unnecessary drama. It's part of competitive cricket. Teammates should resolve issues privately. I support Shaw's reaction.

The reason behind the heated fight between Maharashtra opener Prithvi Shaw and Mumbai all-rounder Musheer Khan on the opening day of the warm-up fixture ahead of the Ranji Trophy 2025-26 season has been revealed.Prithvi Shaw showcased his batting prowess for his new side Maharashtra by scoring a century against his former team Mumbai in a Ranji Trophy warm-up match on Tuesday. The 25-year-old reached his hundred off 140 balls and shared a massive 305-run opening stand with Arshin Kulkarni. Shaw’s innings ended at 181, but not before a brief heated exchange with his ex-teammates.The confrontation occurred after Shaw was caught at deep fine leg attempting a slog sweep off Musheer Khan. Tensions flared momentarily with Mumbai players, but the umpire stepped in to calm the situation, allowing Shaw to walk off.Maharashtra were 430 for three at the stumps on Day 1.Cricbuzz reported that Musheer allegedly sledged Prithvi Shaw by saying, ""Thank you."" The send-off angered Shaw, who also tried to grab Musheer's collar and also swing his bat at the Mumbai player.""It's a practice match. They are all former teammates. Such things happen.It's all okay now and there is no issue,"" said Ankit Bhawne, the captain of the Maharashtra side.Having recently switched from Mumbai to Maharashtra, Shaw had already hinted at his intent with the new team by scoring 111 against Chhattisgarh in the Buchi Babu tournament.Shaw has 4,556 runs in 58 first-class appearances at an average of 46.02, scoring 13 centuries and 18 half-centuries, with a highest score of 379. In List-A games, he has 3,399 runs at 55.72 with a strike rate of 125.74. In T20s, his 2,902 runs have come at a strike rate of 151.54 and an average of 25.01. He was unsold in the IPL 2025 mega auction. Shaw was captain of the Indian team that won the 2018 Under-19 World Cup, with current Test captain Shubman Gill being the player of the tournament.Rated as a highly talented batsman from the start, Shaw made a sensational Test debut by scoring a century (134) against the West Indies in 2018 at Rajkot at the age of 18. He played the last of his five Tests (339 runs @ 42.37, including two half-centuries) at Adelaide (pink-ball Test) in 2020. He has featured in six ODIs and one T20 International and last played a white-ball match for India in July 2021.",Prithvi Shaw and Musheer Khan involved in confrontation during warm-up match. Shaw was caught at deep fine leg attempting a slog sweep off Khan. Shaw also tried to hit Khan with his bat in anger.

Poll What do you think about Abrar Ahmed wanting to box Shikhar Dhawan? Light-hearted fun Unnecessary provocation Disrespectful

NEW DELHI: Pakistan cricket team spinner Abrar Ahmed has once again found himself in the spotlight, but this time not for his on-field antics but for comments made off the field. During a recent appearance on a Pakistani YouTube channel, the 27-year-old leg-spinner was asked which cricketer he would like to face in a boxing ring.Responding to the question —— Abrar replied,Which player do you want to face in the boxing ring, and you have a lot of anger against? - I want to box and want Shikhar Dhawan in front of me)The comment, referring to former India opener Shikhar Dhawan, quickly went viral after a clip of the interview surfaced online. Fans shared mixed reactions, with some calling it a light-hearted jibe and others viewing it as unnecessary provocation.Abrar represented Pakistan in the recently concluded Asia Cup, where India defeated Pakistan three times including the all-important final. His statement has gained attention especially after the fiery exchanges and celebrations that marked the India-Pakistan clashes in Dubai.The Asia Cup final was a memorable one for India, who clinched their ninth title with a five-wicket win.Chasing 147, India recovered from 20/3 as Tilak Varma’s unbeaten 69 and Shivam Dube’s 33 powered the team home with two balls to spare. Earlier, Pakistan had collapsed from 113/1 to 146 all out, with Kuldeep Yadav’s 4/30 triggering the slide.Abrar, who took 1/29 in his four overs, also drew attention for his signature wicket celebration directed toward India’s dugout after dismissing Sanju Samson. Following India’s victory, Arshdeep Singh, Jitesh Sharma and Harshit Rana were seen mimicking the same gesture, with Arshdeep later posting the clip captioned “No context.”While Abrar’s on-field performances continue to draw praise, his latest remark has added yet another chapter to the heated rivalry and sentiment surrounding the India-Pakistan rivalry.","Pakistan spinner Abrar Ahmed has made a controversial claim that he wants to face a legendary Indian batter in the boxing ring.

India U19 batter Vaibhav Suryavanshi was left stunned after being given out in controversial fashion during the second Youth Test against Australia U19 in Mackay on Tuesday.The 14-year-old visibly protested the decision, signaling to the umpire that there was a clear gap between bat and ball.The teen prodigy was dismissed for 20 off the bowling of Charles Lachmund.Suryavanshi, who had struck a rapid 113 off just 86 balls in India’s innings-and-58-run win in the first match, hit two fours and a six from the 14 balls he faced this time.Earlier, a disciplined bowling attack led by the Patel duo of Henil and Khilan helped India U19 bowl Australia U19 out for 135 runs and take a slender nine-run first-innings lead.Right-arm pacer Henil Patel and left-arm spinner Khilan Patel scalped three Australian wickets each for 21 and 23 runs respectively to trigger a batting collapse of the home side, who were all out in 43.3 overs.Wicketkeeper Alex Lee-Young top-scored for Australia U19 with 66 off 108 balls.In reply, India were 144 for 7 from 40 overs at the draw of stumps, with Henil and Deepesh batting on 22 and 6 respectively.Vaibhav Suryavanshi has set the Australian shores on fire.After playing brisk cameos in the Youth ODIs, he smoked a century in the Youth Tests.The boy, who made his first-class debut at 12, bagged his million-dollar IPL deal at 13, and then made history as the youngest player to hit a century in men’s T20s off just 35 balls.Earlier this year, he hit the fastest century on record in Youth ODIs against England at Worcester. He already has a big fan following — when he travelled to the UK, he was stopped for selfies at the airport, and fans reached the venue to get his autograph.Yes, it is only a youth international, but he is the youngest player in either squad by two and a half years. He has looked at least a level or two above the rest.","India U19 batter Vaibhav Suryavanshi was given out in controversial fashion during the second Youth Test against Australia U19 in Mackay on Tuesday.

Poll How crucial is Virat Kohli to India's chances in the ODI World Cup? Extremely crucial Not very crucial He can easily be replaced

The future of Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma in international cricket continues to dominate discussion, especially after the BCCI named Shubman Gill as India’s new ODI captain for the upcoming three-match series in Australia, beginning October 19.Both Rohit and Kohli have been included in the squad purely as specialist batters, but the uncertainty surrounding their long-term roles has sparked debate. With the 2027 ODI World Cup as the team’s main focus, speculation is rife that the Australia tour could mark the final chapter of the two veterans’ decorated international careers.Chief selector Ajit Agarkar recently made it clear that players must participate in domestic cricket when fit and available if they wish to remain in contention for national selection. However, former England pacer Steve Harmison believes Agarkar could be misstepping with this approach, especially when dealing with players of Rohit and Kohli’s stature.“Unfortunately I think there might be a messy end for Ajit Agarkar there. If anybody is going to win here I think it is the former captains rather than the former all-rounder,” Harmison said on. “But it all depends on, if Agarkar is saying this just to fuel the fire of Kohli and Sharma, then fair enough.You put your cards on the table and see what comes.”Harmison further explained that while both players remain crucial to India’s setup, Kohli’s influence in 50-over cricket stands apart.“I think Kohli has got a little bit of skin in the game. Runs in the bank, his reputation. Sharma, not as much. Sharma’s a little bit older. He’s not been as influential in 50-over cricket as Virat has,” he said.The former England quick also warned that India could feel Kohli’s absence deeply if the selectors attempt a rebuild without him.“If Virat turns around and says, ‘All right, you go to the 50-over World Cup without me... when you’re chasing 350 in 50 overs to win against Australia or England, and you haven’t got that bloke who averages 90 winning games at number four, see where your team’s at.’ There could be a messy end in that way,” Harmison added.To stress the size of the issue Agarkar is dealing with, he added, ""If Agarkar's looking for a fight, he's going to get one, but he's not going to win it.""Harmison further added with a tinge of humour, ""I reckon a private jet will be put on from London."" He joked that the Indian Team will surely miss Kohli if he isn't around for the next ODI World Cup and they start losing.India’s first ODI against Australia is set to take place in Sydney on October 19.","The future of Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma in international cricket continues to dominate discussion.

Poll Who do you think will have the upper hand in the match between South Africa and India? South Africa India It's a tie Can't predict

South African all-rounder Nadine de Klerk said that beginning well with both bat and ball holds crucial in the match against India at the ACA-VDCA International Cricket Stadium in Visakhapatnam on Thursday.She feels that India are a talented side and they need to bring their best to come out triumphant. ""It's a really exciting challenge. The key is to start well by taking wickets early and gain some momentum to sort of silence the crowd. It's actually been a big topic over the last couple of months, to be honest. The only way you put teams on the back foot really is by taking wickets. When you bowl first, you want to strike early. And when you bat first, you want to try and combat that by not losing two or three wickets in the power play,"" said Nadine.The medium pacer also said breaking the opening partnership of Smriti Mandhana and Pratika Rawal and putting the middle-order in the middle early will make things tough for the hosts.""Yeah, she (Mandhana) is a quality player. She has done well against us in the past. But I think with conditions being a bit on the slower side, we're going to really back ourselves to either keep her quiet or try to put her under pressure and get her early.We will try and break that opening stand that has been successful over the last couple of months and really try and get that middle-order in as early as possible. We all know if you haven't quite spent as much time in the middle, it's quite difficult in tricky conditions to walk in and put up massive scores. So yeah, hopefully everything goes according to plan,"" she said.She also expected the Indian new-ball bowlers to pose challenges to their batters. “India have quality bowling in attack, especially their new ball bowlers have been quite successful, even in conditions that suit the spinners. They're looking to swing the ball early on and kind of put the teams on the back foot by picking up a few early wickets. But we do expect them to be spin heavy. It has been so, whenever we've played them. So, I think spin is going to be really key for both sides. I think whoever plays spin the best will come out on top,"" she concluded.",South African all-rounder Nadine de Klerk said that beginning well with both bat and ball holds crucial in the match against India.

With the second Test against the West Indies set to begin on Friday at the Arun Jaitley Stadium, Team India gathered for a special dinner hosted by head coach Gautam Gambhir at his residence in New Delhi on Wednesday evening.The players and support staff arrived together by bus, dressed casually for the relaxed occasion. India skipper Shubman Gill sported a white t-shirt paired with blue jeans and black glasses, while most teammates, including Jasprit Bumrah, Dhruv Jurel, Axar Patel, KL Rahul, and Prasidh Krishna, were seen in white outfits. Assistant coach Ryan ten Doeschate, bowling coach Morne Morkel, and BCCI vice-president Rajeev Shukla were also in attendance.The informal get-together came at a perfect time, with the hosts leading the two-match series 1–0 following a dominant victory in Ahmedabad. India had overwhelmed the visitors by an innings and 140 runs, powered by vice-captain Ravindra Jadeja’s all-round brilliance.India’s pace attack, led by Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Siraj, had earlier set the tone by dismissing the West Indies for 162 in 44.1 overs on a green-tinged surface.The duo made full use of the bounce and movement available on the red-soil pitch.In reply, India’s top order stamped their authority. KL Rahul (100), Ravindra Jadeja (104*), and Dhruv Jurel (125) all produced fine knocks to help the hosts post a commanding 448/5 before declaring. The West Indies faltered again in their second innings, folding for 146 and handing India a comprehensive victory.As the action now shifts to Delhi, the pitch is expected to favour batters early on, featuring black soil and patches of grass. Spinners, however, are likely to come into play as the match progresses.The capital last hosted a Test in 2023 during the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, where India defeated Australia by six wickets inside three days — a result they will be eager to replicate when they face the West Indies this week.","Team India gathered for a special dinner hosted by head coach Gautam Gambhir at his residence in New Delhi on Wednesday evening.

Despite Indian batting order not performing to its potential, hosts have managed to stay undefeated after two matches in the ongoing Women’s World Cup. Though they have recorded comfortable victories over Sri Lanka and Pakistan in the first two games, India are still searching for a perfect game and that is 'scary’ for the opposition, reckons Indian batter Jemimah Rodrigues “We have had new match winners every match. I feel if the opponent team is watching us, they will know that we have batting till the end. That is scary for the opponents to know that we have not had a perfect match yet, but we are still on the winning streak,” said Jemimah on the eve of India’s clash against South Africa in Visakhapatnam, on Wednesday.“And I think in such tournaments, because it's so long, it's important to peak at the right time. But like I said, we have so much more confidence knowing that till the end we have batting and everyone is a match winner. But we are not desperate for the perfect match,” he revealed.The Mumbai cricketer backed the openers Smriti Mandhana and Pratika Rawal to come good saying that the duo is in bests of forms. “Our opening partnership has been the best so far. I think they have scored more than 1000 runs. I think we are on the right track,” she assured.Jemimah herself is not among runs but the batter is confident of scoring runs that are impactful for the team.“I mean, in the first match (against Sri Lanka), the ball was very good. I couldn't do anything extra in that match. Second match, if you see I had a partnership of I think 47 runs with Harleen. So, I am not looking at my own score. The team's score is challenging. That wicket was challenging. We took out that time and gave a foundation so that the rest of the team could reach 250. I am not thinking so much about myself. My only approach is that I want to do whatever it takes for the team. And if I do that and my mindset is right, I know performance and everything will follow. But I want to make sure I do my job for the team first,"" she said.She also expected the pitch to be a batter-friendly, unlike what they faced in the tournament so far. “I think the pitch, again, was under covers today.

Sai Sudharsan might not have had the dream start to his Test career, but India’s team management continues to place full trust in the young batter’s potential.Assistant coach Ryan ten Doeschate confirmed that the Tamil Nadu left-hander enjoys the backing of captain Shubman Gill and the support staff as India prepare for the second Test against West Indies starting Friday.Sudharsan, who turns 24 next week, has scored 147 runs in seven innings so far with one half-century.

You know, you saw Karun Nair get four Test matches in England.""The coach also dismissed any talk of panic over Sudharsan’s form. “Certainly there is no panic or no worry, particularly in a winning team, you can absorb that,” ten Doeschate said, adding that Sudharsan will get enough chances to prove himself in the ongoing series.He also highlighted the challenges of irregular scheduling between Test matches. “It doesn't help that you have five Test matches in the UK and then you wait six weeks to play the next. But again, that is the nature of Test cricket in this era, and he has to find a way to do it,” ten Doeschate added.",Sai Sudharsan has scored 147 runs in seven innings so far with one half-century.

The Desert Vipers on Wednesday signed Afghanistan wrist-spinner Noor Ahmad for season four of the ILT20.The 20-year-old will step in for Wanindu Hasaranga , as the Sri Lankan all-rounder is expected to have domestic commitments during the tournament.“I am excited for this opportunity and very thankful for the faith shown in me by the team’s coaching and management staff, especially Tom Moody and James Foster ,"" said Noor.""The Vipers have a fantastic squad, full of high-quality players in every department, and I cannot wait to get to Dubai and start the tournament.”Earlier this year in the Indian Premier League (IPL), Noor claimed 24 wickets for Chennai Super Kings , making him the second-highest wicket-taker of the tournament, just one behind Gujarat Titans’ Prasidh Krishna.Noor was also named Player of the Tournament in the 2024 Caribbean Premier League, topping the wicket-taking chart with 22 scalps for first-time winners St Lucia Kings.He has been capped by Afghanistan in both white-ball international formats, playing 13 One-Day Internationals (ODIs) and 22 Twenty20 Internationals (T20Is) for his country.Noor was part of the squads for the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup in the Caribbean and the USA in 2024 and the Asia Cup in the United Arab Emirates in 2025.His T20I economy rate is an exceptional 6.08 runs per over.Tom Moody, the Desert Vipers Director of Cricket, said: “We are thrilled to have secured the services of Noor Ahmad, who is clearly one of the leading spin bowlers in world cricket at the moment.“We are obviously sad to miss Wanindu Hasaranga, as he has been a Viper since day one. He is an outstanding all-round cricketer, and we know what the Vipers mean to him.“But Noor’s wealth of experience around the globe in franchise cricket will certainly be something we benefit from.“Also, his familiarity with the UAE and the DP World ILT20 venues puts him in a strong position and will add significant value to the franchise.“Noor joins two other Afghanistan cricketers we secured in the recent auction – Qais Ahmad and Faridoon Dawoodzai – so we are thrilled to complete a hat-trick of Afghanistan players representing us in season four of the ILT20.”","Noor Ahmad has been signed by the Desert Vipers for season four of the ILT20.

Poll Do you believe that the Indian cricket management effectively communicates with senior players like Kohli and Rohit? Yes, they communicate well No, there is a lack of communication Not sure

Former India off-spinner R. Ashwin has spoken candidly about the handling of senior players Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma , emphasizing the need for knowledge transfer (KT) and transparent communication from the Indian cricket management.“On one side is selection, on the other side is Kohli and Rohit. These are two sides of the same coin. Upon examining the selection, it is clear that the selectors are moving forward,"" he said on his Youtube channel.""However, in this process, they have two players who are nearing the end of their careers. One thing I would like to mention is that you need to improve the way you handle such players.""It is very easy to say they have grown old and should retire. One of the reasons we feel this way is that we see many young players in the IPL performing well, and we believe they can replace these experienced players.""However, during this process, one thing we often overlook is solid communication and knowledge transfer. I request that this be addressed in the future,” Ashwin said.Ashwin clarified that KT doesn’t mean teaching new shots. “Knowledge transfer, or KT, doesn’t mean Kohli and Rohit will be teaching Shubman Gill and Abhishek Sharma new shots; rather, it will show them how to handle pressure situations and deal with injuries.The way Kohli and Rohit batted in the 2023 ODI World Cup, they have nothing to prove, but does KT have any space? There is actually no space for KT in Indian cricket because there is no transition phase. ”Ashwin cited the coaching example of Rahul Dravid and Gautam Gambhir to highlight the lack of structured transition.“Rahul Dravid was a coach at one time, then Gautam Gambhir took over. We did not have any template that, after Dravid, Gambhir would be the coach, so taking KT from Dravid was not possible. And after Gambhir, for whom will the KT go? If there is no roadmap from the management side, this cannot happen from the players’ side.”“I really hope the conversation has already taken place with Kohli and Rohit. But if it happened now, why didn’t it happen during their retirement from T20Is in the World Cup last year? Had they been told then, they would have said, ‘Okay, boss, do we want to play because this is what the team wants to take a direction and these are the choices?’ But this leaves a lot of uninformed space, which leads to speculation. And there shouldn’t be speculation. It should have been a straight conversation. If the communication is not clear and transparent, and if it is not done with a forward-looking vision, it leaves players in a very vulnerable position,” he said.",Former India off-spinner R.

Poll Should the match between Italy and Israel be postponed due to political tensions? Yes, safety is a priority No, the game should proceed as planned

Italy’s hopes of automatic qualification for the 2026 World Cup are under pressure, as the national team prepares to face Israel in Udine next Tuesday amid rising political tensions. The match comes at a sensitive time, following a weekend of some of Europe’s largest pro-Palestinian demonstrations across Italy.Hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets to protest Israel’s ongoing military offensive in Gaza, which followed a Hamas attack on Israeli communities on October 7, 2023. Calls to ban Israel from international sport have grown louder, and demonstrators even targeted the Italian team’s training centre in Florence, demanding the qualifier be called off.Only around 4,000 tickets have been sold for the Udine match, a city chosen to minimize potential disorder. Udine previously hosted Israel in September 2024 during the Nations League, a match that passed largely without incident but required heavy security, including soldiers stationed on the stadium roof. Despite these precautions, the mayor of Udine, Alberto Felice De Toni, has requested the game be postponed due to fears of larger protests.Italy coach Gennaro Gattuso described the situation as “very sad”, lamenting the unusual atmosphere for a crucial match.“There will be 10,000 people outside the stadium and 5-6,000 inside it... I would have preferred to play a home match in front of an enthusiastic crowd like we did in Bergamo (where Italy beat Estonia 5-0) a month ago,” he said.Italy sit second in their World Cup qualifying group, level on nine points with Israel but six behind leaders Norway, who hold a 16-goal advantage in goal difference. Only the group winner secures automatic qualification, leaving Italy to realistically aim for a play-off spot. The team has failed to reach the knockout stage of a World Cup since winning it in 2006, and missed out entirely in 2022 despite being reigning European champions.With four remaining matches, including a crucial San Siro clash against Norway, Italy must win all remaining games while hoping for slip-ups from Erling Haaland’s side to top the group. The external political pressure, coupled with the crucial stakes on the field, has made Gattuso’s task more challenging than ever, as Italy fight to keep their World Cup dreams alive.",Italy face Israel in a World Cup qualifier in Udine next Tuesday.

Poll Do you think hosting La Liga matches outside Europe is a positive development for football? Yes, it's a great opportunity for global exposure. No, it undermines the league's traditions.

In a landmark decision, Barcelona will play Villarreal in Miami on December 20, marking the first European league fixture to be held outside Europe, La Liga announced on Wednesday. The match will take place at Florida’s Hard Rock Stadium, originally scheduled to be played at Villarreal’s home ground.La Liga president Javier Tebas called the move a historic step for Spanish football.“With this match we take a historic step that projects La Liga and Spanish football into a new dimension,” Tebas said. “We understand and respect the concerns that this decision may generate, but it is important to put it into context — it is a single match out of the 380 that make up the season.”While the move is groundbreaking, it has faced criticism. UEFA , the European football governing body, earlier expressed opposition to overseas league games but allowed this one on an exceptional basis. Real Madrid, Barcelona’s arch-rivals, also voiced disapproval, warning that playing a La Liga game abroad could “alter the competitive balance” and set an “unacceptable precedent.”Fan reaction has been mixed. In September, 18 supporter groups from both clubs expressed complete opposition to the match being held abroad.To ease concerns, Villarreal has announced measures to compensate season ticket holders.“Season ticket holders will be able to travel for free to the match, and those who choose not to travel to Miami will enjoy a 30 percent discount on their season ticket price as part of the measures designed to reward their support and loyalty,” La Liga said.La Liga has previously attempted to host matches overseas dating back to 2017, but faced resistance from the Spanish football federation (RFEF), despite successfully staging the Spanish Super Cup in Saudi Arabia.The December 20 fixture between Barcelona and Villarreal represents a historic moment for European football, as the league seeks to expand its global reach, despite concerns over tradition, competitive fairness, and fan sentiment. The match in Miami will undoubtedly be watched closely as a potential blueprint for the future of European club football abroad.",Barcelona will play Villarreal in Miami on December 20.

Salah then added his second goal in the 84th minute to complete the win.The twice African Footballer of the Year played a pivotal role in Liverpool’s record-equalling 20th Premier League title last season, winning the Golden Boot with 29 goals, although he has struggled for form this season, scoring only three goals in nine appearances in all competitions.Egypt, winners of a record seven Africa Cup of Nations titles, have historically found World Cup qualification challenging. Salah’s leadership on and off the field was instrumental in ensuring the Pharaohs’ return to football’s biggest stage.Elsewhere in Africa, Ghana edged closer to qualification with a 5-0 win over Central African Republic, thanks to goals from Thomas Partey, Mohammed Salisu, Alexander Djiku, Jordan Ayew, and Kamaldeen Sulemana.Ghana now needs just one point from their final match against Comoros to qualify.Meanwhile, Cape Verde came from behind to draw 3-3 with Libya, keeping their hopes alive for a first World Cup appearance.

Poll Which aspect do you think has a bigger impact on team success: talent or teamwork? Talent Teamwork

Former England and Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard has revealed that ego and club rivalries prevented England's talented generation from achieving international success during his playing career. Speaking on the Rio Ferdinand Presents podcast, the 45-year-old, who earned 114 international caps, discussed how internal divisions among players from different Premier League clubs hindered the national team's performance.Gerrard, who led Liverpool to Champions League glory in 2005, was part of England's ""golden generation"" that failed to progress beyond quarter-finals in major tournaments despite having exceptional talent from top clubs.The squad included Manchester United stars Rio Ferdinand, Paul Scholes, and Wayne Rooney , alongside Chelsea players Ashley Cole, John Terry, and Frank Lampard, who all achieved success in Premier League and Champions League.""We were all egotistical losers,"" Gerrard said on the podcast, noting the contrast with the current camaraderie between the same players in their punditry careers. ""So why didn't we connect when we were 20, 21, 22, 23? Was it ego? Was it rivalry?""""It was down to the culture within England. We weren't friendly or connected. We weren't a team. We never at any stage became a real good, strong team.""England continue to seek their first major men's international trophy since the 1966 World Cup, though they reached the finals of the last two European Championships under Gareth Southgate, who recently stepped down after Euro 2024.""Gareth Southgate is underrated for how he connected with the England team,"" Gerrard said. ""Because for me, the talent was there. The players were there. The level of games we were all playing at was there to go and do better than what we did.""""We had a little bit of bad luck with penalties or whatever. We have to take responsibility, but I've got a big frustration when I look back at England that we never did better. I think it's a combination of different things, but one of the big things for me was we weren't a team. We were a group of individuals with talent and it never works like that.""Thomas Tuchel has taken charge of England's World Cup campaign next year following Southgate's departure.Gerrard's own managerial career has faced setbacks after unsuccessful spells at Aston Villa and Saudi Arabian club Al Ettifaq. He is now among the favourites to return to Rangers, where he won the Scottish Premiership in 2020/21.Regarding his managerial future, Gerrard said: ""There's a part of me that still feels that there's a bit of unfinished business in terms of wanting to go in and face another couple of exciting challenges. But I want a certain type of challenge. If in an ideal world they come available, I'll jump at them. If they don't, I won't go back in. I want to be at a team that's going to compete to win because I think that suits me better.

Inter Miami left-back Jordi Alba announced his retirement from professional football through an Instagram post on Tuesday, prompting an emotional response from teammate Lionel Messi . Alba's decision comes shortly after midfielder Sergio Busquets also announced his retirement , marking the end of an era for the former Barcelona teammates who reunited at Inter Miami, alongside Messi.Alba made the announcement with a simple message on social media expressing his gratitude to the sport, stating ""Thank you, football, thank you so much.""Messi responded to Alba's retirement announcement with a heartfelt comment acknowledging their long-standing partnership on the field. ""Thanks to you, Jordi. I'm going to miss you so much. After so much together, it's going to be weird to look to the left and not see you there… Crazy how many assists you gave me all these years.. Who's gonna give me back passes now???"" Messi wrote.The duo played 413 matches together across their time at Barcelona and Inter Miami, forming a formidable partnership that saw Alba consistently providing assists to Messi from the left flank. Alba provided Messi with 33 assists during their time on the pitch, only Luis Suarez (60), Dani Alves (42), and Andres Iniesta (37) assisted more.Their partnership, which began at Barcelona, continued when they reunited at Inter Miami in Major League Soccer, where they maintained their on-field chemistry despite being in the latter stages of their careers.Alba had previously shared his motivations for joining Inter Miami in an interview with CBS Sports last year. ""I don't get tired of winning. I want to keep winning, to keep competing. If I did not have that excitement, I would not have come here. I would have stayed in Barcelona, at home, not playing football,"" he said.The Spanish defender also explained his decision to join Inter Miami was influenced by the presence of his former teammates. ""The opportunity was very attractive. I also wanted to get back with Leo [Messi] and Busi [Sergio Busquets] and now Luis [Suarez] has also come. So these were the incentives that led me to make that decision,"" Alba stated.Alba's career has been marked by significant achievements, including six La Liga titles with Barcelona and a Champions League trophy.

MADRID: Midfielder Rodri has been dropped from Spain's squad for upcoming World Cup qualifying games because of an injury sustained when playing for Manchester City in the Premier League this weekend.Spain said Monday that Rodri will not play against Georgia and Bulgaria during the international break. The Spanish soccer federation said it made the decision after receiving the results of medical tests conducted by Man City.Spain is already missing young Barcelona forward Lamine Yamal because of a groin ailment.Rodri was forced off with a suspected hamstring problem in the first half of Man City's 1-0 win at Brentford on Sunday, the latest injury blow to hit last year's Ballon d'Or winner.Rodri said after the game he ""felt a little bit in the hamstring but it seems like it's not that much.""""I stretched the leg a little bit, a bit like in the Euros final. I stretched a little bit but it's part of the process,"" he said. ""I don't feel that I feel tired muscle-wise, I feel fresh but the most important thing is it's not that big.""Rodri said ""the good thing is the break so it will be even better in this sense to recover these days and hopefully I can be in the next game.""Rodri looked forlorn as he walked gingerly off the field in the 21st minute, moments after slumping to the ground while clutching the back of his right leg. He was replaced by Nico Gonzalez.Rodri sustained ACL damage in September last year that kept him out for eight months. He missed the start of this season after picking up another injury, reportedly to his groin, at the Club World Cup and has complained of knee pain in recent weeks.","Rodri was forced off with a suspected hamstring problem in the first half of Man City's 1-0 win at Brentford on Sunday.

PARIS: Kylian Mbappe is receiving treatment for a ""small niggle"" in his right ankle after meeting up with his international team-mates ahead of the latest round of 2026 World Cup qualifiers, France coach Didier Deschamps said Monday.The France captain sustained the knock at the end of Real Madrid's 3-1 La Liga victory over Villarreal on Saturday, casting doubts over his availability to the national team for their upcoming qualifying matches against Azerbaijan and Iceland.""I spoke with Kylian, he had a small niggle but it's not serious, otherwise he wouldn't be here today,"" Deschamps told reporters at the French team's Clairefontaine base near Paris.""We will take the time with the medical staff to assess the situation and then see how it develops.""Liverpool defender Ibrahima Konate also underwent tests, after coming off injured in the Reds' 2-1 defeat at Chelsea on Saturday.The pair received treatment on Monday during training and are set to continue treatment on Tuesday, according to the French national team's coaching staff.The French football federation (FFF) also confirmed Paris Saint-Germain forward Bradley Barcola would be sent home from Clairefontaine due to a hamstring injury.""After consulting with the French national team doctor... (Barcola) has been diagnosed with a chronic injury to his right hamstring since Paris Saint-Germain's Champions League match against Atalanta (on September 17),"" the FFF said.PSG then publicly rejected the diagnosis of the 23-year-old by France's medical team.""The information published in this statement does not correspond in any way to the medical information provided by Paris Saint-Germain's medical teams,"" the club posted on social media.""Prior to the gathering (at Clairefontaine) and following the Ligue 1 matchday 7 fixture against Lille, Paris Saint-Germain provided the French national team with a medical report on Bradley Barcola that made no mention of any chronic injury following the match against Atalanta.""The attacker played 60 minutes of PSG's Ligue 1 draw at Lille on Sunday before being replaced, showing no apparent signs of injury during the encounter.Should Barcola end up facing time on the sidelines, he would be a further addition to PSG's lengthy injury list which already includes fellow France forwards Ousmane Dembele and Desire Doue, as well as Marquinhos, Khvicha Kvaratskhelia, Fabian Ruiz and Joao Neves.Last month there was friction between the two parties after PSG criticised the French national team staff following injuries suffered by Dembele and Doue during France's opening Group D win over Ukraine.Les Bleus are top of their group with two wins from two so far in qualifying. They host Azerbaijan on Friday at PSG's Parc des Princes stadium before travelling to Iceland three days later.","Kylian Mbappe is receiving treatment for a ""small niggle"" in his right ankle.

What’s common between the three Formula E world champions

How the three World Champions fared in Formula E Season 11

Days after Oliver Rowland lifted his Formula E World Championship trophy in London this season, an interesting trend has come to the attention of Formula E and its fans. As a coincidence, all Formula E drivers who won the Mexico City E-Prix went on to win the Formula E World Championship that season, and this has been proved right for three consecutive years.Highlighting the same since 2023, a poster of three World Champions was shared on X by Formula E with the caption, “The trend continues. Each winner of the #MexicoCityEPrix from the past three seasons has gone on to become World Champion.”The special poster features 2023 Formula E World Champion Jake Dennis from Andretti, then TAG Heuer Porsche’s Pascal Wehrlein, who won in 2024, and the new World Champion, Nissan driver Oliver Rowland. All three of them won in the Mexico E-Prix and went on to lift the winner’s trophy in the Formula E World Championship that year.Oliver Rowland had strengthened his chances of winning the Formula E World Championship this year much earlier. He was leading the Formula E Driver Standings ever since he won Part 2 of the Jeddah E-Prix, which was his second win of the season after winning the Mexico E-Prix. In the last leg, the Nissan driver got nervous for a while as Pascal Wehrlein, who was following him in the number two position, closed the gap after grabbing quite a few podiums while Rowland had a dull period.Things became serious for Rowland when he failed to finish the Round 13 race in Berlin, while Wehrlein won second spot on the podium. But he eventually managed to confirm his championship in Berlin after four wins and three more podiums.Sharing about his bad race in Berlin, Rowland had said, “I was hoping before the weekend that the outcome could be [the World Championship], but after yesterday (Saturday) and this morning (Sunday), I was more worried that it might never come.”Also Read: Oliver Rowland reacts to daughter’s sweet radio message after Formula E Championship win: “It’s amazing” Things, however, changed for Wehrlein, who was pushed to third position after Nick Cassidy made a late entry in the Formula E Driver Standings by registering three consecutive wins.

Wehrlein registered one win and five more podiums this season.Meanwhile, Andretti driver Jake Dennis finished in seventh position in the Formula E Driver Standings.

Taylor Barnard on losing top three spot in Formula E World Championship

Fans hail Taylor Barnard for his fantastic rookie season

It was Taylor Barnard’s rookie season this year, and the NEOM McLaren driver put up a fantastic performance by temporarily making it to the top three in the Formula E Driver Standings by ousting the much more experienced Porsche driver Antonio Felix Da Costa.

Barnard took to Instagram to share his feelings on losing out on the top three in his first-ever season and his claim to the championship.Taking to Instagram after the London E-Prix, Barnard wrote, “London wasn’t what we hoped for, easily being the toughest weekend of our season.

Finishing P4 in the Drivers’ Championship and coming into the final weekend with a shot at runner-up is something to be proud of.”Also adding a note for teammate Sam Bird, as NEOM McLaren withdrew from Formula E after the end of the season, Barnard wrote, “@sambird_official it wasn’t the weekend you deserved either.You’ve been a huge part of my season both on and off the track, and I’m grateful for everything.

We couldn’t have done it without you all — your trust and support have never been taken for granted,” he added.Praising the two McLaren drivers, he wrote, “Sam clinched McLaren’s first-ever fully electric win at the São Paulo E-Prix in Season 10, pulling off one of Formula E’s all-time great overtakes, before being waved across the line by none other than Emerson Fittipaldi – McLaren's first Formula 1 World Champion. While Taylor has been a rookie sensation in Season 11, securing five Formula E records, including the youngest driver to start a race, the youngest points scorer, the youngest driver to lead a lap, the youngest podium finisher, and the youngest polesitter. ”He ended the letter saying, “Some of us have been together since the day we first launched this team, while others have seamlessly fitted in along the way and flourished within the environment we have cultivated. For many, I am sure that we will cross paths again soon, but whatever the future holds for those here at Bicester, whatever path they choose to follow, I have no doubt that it will be bright.

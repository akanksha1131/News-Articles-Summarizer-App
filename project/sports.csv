INDIA vs PAKISTAN : Scenarios

Scenario What happens Result India beat Pakistan India win the Super Six match India qualify for semi-finals as Group 2 toppers India lose by small margin Pakistan win, but not by a big enough margin India still qualify on superior net run rate Pakistan bat first, score 250 Pakistan must beat India by 89 runs or more Pakistan qualify for semi-finals, India knocked out Pakistan chase 251 Pakistan must reach target in 33.2 overs or fewer Pakistan qualify for semi-finals Pakistan chase lower target Pakistan must chase at an even faster rate Pakistan qualify only if NRR overtakes India Pakistan win but fail NRR margin Victory not big/fast enough India qualify for semi-finals

NEW DELHI: Five-time champions India will head into Sunday’s Super Six showdown against arch-rivals Pakistan with revenge firmly on their agenda at the ICC Men’s Under-19 World Cup in Zimbabwe. More than just pride is at stake, with the clash set to decide the fourth and final semi-final spot, as the ICC has outlined detailed qualification scenarios for both teams.The fixture carries extra significance following India’s heavy 191-run loss to Pakistan in the Under-19 Asia Cup final in Dubai last December — a setback that came after India had earlier beaten their rivals by 90 runs in the group stage of the same tournament.Under the leadership of Ayush Mhatre, the Indian side will now aim to set the record straight on the world stage.India are also expected to stick with their ‘no handshake’ policy against Pakistan, a stance they adopted during both the group match and final of the Asia Cup. The decision comes against the backdrop of the Pahalgam terror attack and Operation Sindoor carried out by the country’s armed forces.In terms of the tournament picture, Australia, Afghanistan and England have already booked their places in the semi-finals.The final berth will be decided solely by the outcome of the India-Pakistan contest. England currently lead Group 2 with eight points and a net run rate of +1.757, followed by India on six points with a strong NRR of +3.337. Pakistan sit third with four points and an NRR of +1.484.For India, the path is clear: a victory will confirm their semi-final qualification and also see them finish on top of the group, setting up a last-four meeting with Afghanistan. Even in defeat, India remain in a favourable position, as a narrow loss would still keep them ahead of Pakistan thanks to their superior net run rate.Pakistan, by contrast, face a much steeper climb. As per ICC calculations, if Pakistan bat first and post a total of 250, they would need to beat India by at least 89 runs to leapfrog them into second place and qualify at India’s expense.If Pakistan are chasing, the challenge becomes one of speed. For example, a target of 251 would have to be overhauled in 33.2 overs or fewer to stay alive in the tournament, with any lower target requiring an even faster chase.With both sides aware of the exact equations, Sunday promises a tense battle, and the full picture will become clear at the innings break. With a semi-final spot hanging in the balance, expect a gripping contest at Queen’s Sports Club in Bulawayo.","Five-time champions India will head into Sunday’s Super Six showdown against arch-rivals Pakistan with revenge firmly on their agenda.

Sanju Samson or Ishan Kishan? | Greenstone Lobo predicts the ideal player for T20 World Cup

NEW DELHI: The spotlight was firmly on Sanju Samson when India took on New Zealand in the fifth and final T20I in Thiruvananthapuram. Enduring a lean patch, Samson was expected to come out firing on his home ground, backed by fans eager to see him regain form. That, however, did not materialise as the opener failed yet again, managing just six runs.Fellow opener Abhishek Sharma struck a quick 30 off 16 balls but departed in the fifth over with India at 48 for 2. From there, Ishan Kishan and Suryakumar Yadav turned the game on its head, adding 137 runs off just 57 balls — the second-highest partnership for any wicket for India against New Zealand. Kishan brought up his fifty in 28 balls and then went into overdrive, racing to his next fifty in only 14 deliveries.He eventually completed his century off 42 balls — the fastest hundred against New Zealand and the fifth quickest overall for India. It was also the seventh-fastest T20 century overall.Suryakumar, meanwhile, scored 50 off 26 balls. The pair powered India close to the 200 mark before Yadav was stumped off Mitchell Santner in the 15th over. Kishan then combined with Hardik Pandya for a further 48 runs off 18 balls before the centurion was dismissed, caught.Pandya smashed four sixes and a four as India surged past 250 in the 19th over, setting a daunting target for the Kiwis.India batting great Sunil Gavaskar criticised Samson’s struggles during the series.""I think the selection committee was quite forthright, giving Sanju Samson all the opportunities. But now, with Ishan Kishan's innings here and Tilak Varma likely to return, the batting order looks definite,"" Gavaskar said on Star Sports.Samson featured in all five matches of the series but could manage only 46 runs in total.Samson is part of India’s squad for the 2026 T20 World Cup.""It is really difficult to drop him. And dropping him for whom? Tilak Varma is a proven performer at this level. Sanju Samson is also a proven performer, but he is not in form. It has got nothing to do with his ability. In a tournament like the World Cup, you can't take chances. This is the reason I think that after giving him five matches - I think his highest score is 24 - and he has got out in odd manners, he is definitely short on confidence. Unless Tilak Varma is not fit, I don't see him (Samson) being part of the XI on February 7 (vs USA in the T20 World Cup),"" Gavaskar said after the match ended.Kishan wrapped up the series with 215 runs, including a century and a fifty, finishing second on the run charts behind Suryakumar Yadav.","India beat New Zealand by eight wickets in the fifth and final T20I in Thiruvananthapuram.

NEW DELHI: Pakistan defeated Australia by 90 runs in the second T20I in Lahore on Saturday. The match also saw controversy after Cameron Green showed frustration towards Pakistan spinner Usman Tariq over his bowling action.Pakistan captain Salman Agha played a brilliant knock and recorded his highest score in T20Is. He made 76 runs off 40 balls. Usman Khan also impressed with 53 runs from 36 balls. Pakistan posted 198-5, their highest T20I total against Australia.During Australia’s chase, a moment grabbed attention. Usman Tariq dismissed Cameron Green in the 11th over. Tariq paused midway in his action and delivered the ball with a low arm.Green tried to hit a six but mistimed it and was caught at point. Green looked angry after his dismissal.While walking back, he made a throwing gesture, suggesting Tariq was chucking. He repeated the gesture again after crossing the boundary.Watch:Green was Australia’s top scorer with 35 runs from 20 balls. At that time, Australia had already lost five wickets and were struggling in the chase.Pakistan’s spinners dominated the game. Abrar Ahmed took 3-14, and Shadab Khan picked up 3-26, while Tariq amassed 2-16.All ten Australian wickets fell to spin. Australia were bowled out for 108 in 15.4 overs. This became Pakistan’s biggest T20I win over Australia, beating their previous 66-run victory in 2018.""It has to be a perfect game,"" said Agha. ""We batted well and then were outstanding with the ball. Fielding was outstanding.""The win gave Pakistan an unbeatable 2-0 lead in the series.""We want to play in the same way, forget the 2-0 scoreline and come again with the same intensity and go to the World Cup with the same energy,"" said Agha of the event starting in India and Sri Lanka from February 7.Australia captain Mitchell Marsh admitted his team was outplayed.""Pakistan outplayed us,"" said Marsh.

Sanju Samson or Ishan Kishan? | Greenstone Lobo predicts the ideal player for T20 World Cup

Thiruvananthapuram: Ishan Kishan ’s blistering 42-ball century was the heartbeat of India’s mammoth 271/5 at the Greenfield Stadium on Saturday, transforming what might have been a competitive total into a match-winning one. On the smallest playing area of the series, and on a pitch dry on top yet tacky underneath, India’s innings was a masterclass in timing, power, and ruthless intent. In pursuit, New Zealand were bundled out for 225, with only Finn Allen’s 80 off 38 offering any semblance of resistance.The 46-run victory capped a dominant 4–1 series triumph for India.The partisan Thiruvananthapuram crowd had come expecting fireworks from local hero Sanju Samson , but it was Kishan who stole the show. Lockie Ferguson, making his international comeback after 2024 for New Zealand, supplied the only early sting with genuine pace and bounce, removing both Samson and Abhishek Sharma Abhishek’s 30 off 16 set the tone with brisk aggression, but Samson’s six-ball six ended in silent disappointment — a forlorn walk off the field greeted by a deafening silence from the home fans.Kishan, returning from a niggle, started measured and non-fussy, letting the pitch and outfield settle beneath him. Once in rhythm, he unleashed sheer carnage. Partnering captain Suryakumar Yadav , who carved 63 off 30 with effortless elegance, India torpedoed from 100 to 200 in just 5.2 overs, the duo adding a 137-run stand for the third wicket.Kishan’s ruthlessness was particularly brutal against leg-spinner Ish Sodhi, whom he hammered for 29 runs in a single over. The defining moment came in the 17th over against New Zealand captain Mitchell Santner: two consecutive sixes brought up Kishan’s century, immediately celebrated with a bear hug from Hardik Pandya at the non-striker’s end.Ten sixes and six fours punctuated a knock of explosive efficiency, power, and timing in perfect harmony.Even after Kishan and Suryakumar departed, the carnage continued. Hardik Pandya bludgeoned 42 off 17, while Rinku Singh and Shivam Dube closed the innings with flair.The Kiwi chase began in flames. Tim Seifert fell for 5 in the first over to Arshdeep Singh, and though Finn Allen — the Big Bash run-topper with 466 runs at a 184.2 strike rate — played a scintillating 80 off 38, wickets at key moments slowed the momentum. By 10 overs, New Zealand were 131/2, needing 141 from the remaining 10 overs — a near-impossible ask. The visitors surged to 166 by 14 overs, but from there, the asking rate ballooned to alarming proportions.The wrecker-in-chief during this phase was Arshdeep, who bore the brunt of Finn’s early assault before returning to remove Rachin Ravindra, Mitchell Santner, and Kyle Jamieson, finishing with figures of 5/51 from four incisive overs.""Great learning for me to stay in the game. That was the message from the coaching staff. Lately, I've been going for runs consistently, I'm trying to stay in the game with Morne Morkel's help,"" Arshdeep said after the game.Beyond the numbers, the match carried a subtle T20 World Cup subtext: Kishan taking over wicketkeeping duties from Samson signals India’s intent to finalise combinations for the showpiece event starting next week.","Ishan Kishan's 42-ball century was the heartbeat of India's mammoth 271/5 at the Greenfield Stadium.

Chennai Crowd Standing Ovation to Pakistan Cricket Team. Chennai Test 1999. Amazing sportsmanship

For those who have begun watching India vs Pakistan cricket only in recent times, it can be easy to assume that matches between the two sides have always been dominated by politics, hostility, aggression from crowd, and the absence of even basic sporting courtesies.While there have always been some kind of political context to their encounters, and an ""at your face"" approach whenever both sides faced each other, there was some kind of respect for the players and the great game that they were playing, to not let politics or jingoism take over the sport. Perhaps nothing captures it better than the Chennai Test of 1999, which India lost, after a batting masterclass by Sachin Tendulkar.The political atmosphere was high then, too. Pakistan arrived in India for the first Test between the two arch-rivals in nine years, but the venue for the first match of the series had to be changed as, weeks before the series was set to kick off, some extremists dug up the pitch at the Firoz Shah Kotla Stadium in Delhi, the original venue for the first Test.Chennai's MA Chidambaram Stadium, which originally was due to host the second Test, was then selected to host the first match as venues for the first and second Test matches were swapped.The outrage by some fringe extremist groups continued, and against this backdrop, the first Test of the series began on January 28, 1999, at the MA Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai. The Stadium was guarded by 3,000 police and military officials.Pakistan captain Wasim Akram won the toss and opted to bat first as India handed Sadagoppan Ramesh his Test debut. Pakistan were once struggling at 91-5 as Kumble and Srinath sent Saeed Anwar, Shahid Afridi, Ijaz, Inzamam, and Saleem Malik back to pavillion. However, Moin Khan (60) and Mohammad Yousuf (53) fought back to guide the visitors to a first innings score of 238.Debutant Ramesh and VVS Laxman put on a brisk 48 for India on the evening of day one, but both were dismissed by Wasim Akram within half an hour of play resuming. Then Saqlain Mushtaq took the first of his 20 wickets in this series when his tantalising length accounted for Tendulkar; the batsman dashed down the wicket, mis-hit and scooped a catch to backward point for a third-ball duck. But Dravid and Ganguly helped India towards a narrow 16-run lead before the spinners finished them off.By the end of Day 2, Pakistan were 34/1 and day three belonged to Shahid Afridi as he struck 141 off 191 balls, hitting 21 fours and three sixes. He got ample support from Inzamam ul-Haq (51), and Saleem Malik (32) as Pakistan finished their second innings at 286. Venkatesh Prasad took 6 wickets in the innings as India were set the target of 271 to chase in the fourth innings on a tough Chennai pitch.India finished day 3 at 40/2, with both openers, Ramesh and Laxman, back in the hut. On the day 4 morning, Akram removed Dravid thanks to an absolute peach of a delivery. Then Saqlain Mushtaq got the better of India captain Mohammad Azharuddin (5) and Sourav Ganguly (2). At 82 for 5 before lunch on the fourth day, 271 looked distant for India, and a defeat inevitable. But Sachin Tendulkar stood firm and tall, despite battling a back injury.Saqlain Mushtaq and Wasim bowled in tandem after lunch. Facing them, Tendulkar and Mongia. India didn't lose a wicket between lunch and Tea.Pakistan took the new ball in the third session with 95 needed and Sachin and Mongia still on the wicket for India. Tendulkar's back had ""all but given up"" on him. The next five overs brought 33.India were still 53 short when Mongia slogged Wasim across the line and got the top edge, ball went straight to Waqar Younis at covers.Still, Tendulkar kept going, despite a back strain. At 254 for 6 on the day 4 afternoon, India needed only 17 to win with Tendulkar still at the crease, batting at 136 off 273 balls. But then he mistimed a lofted drive off Saqlain Mushtaq, and Wasim Akram caught him at mid-off.Commentator Harsha Bhogle called it on air: ""Oh dear… he's got the leading edge… man's under it… it's taken… what have we got here… Sachin Tendulkar's knocked on the door… it's still closed…""Tendulkar walked out of the ground after a masterful innings, and with him went India's hope as Wasim Akram and Saqlain Mushtaq ran through India's lower order, taking the last 3 wickets for just 4 runs. India were out for 258, and Pakistan clinched a historic victory by 12 runs. Saqlain Mushtaq took 10 wickets in the match.Pakistani players bowed to the ground in prayer and embarked on a lap of honour. Instead of hostility, they were met with a standing ovation from the Chennai crowd.Bhogle, on air, said he had never seen ""a stronger statement in favour of sport than this."" ""We’ve had a fascinating game of cricket, but this is the best sight you will see anywhere in the world. Pakistan are going on a victory lap and the crowd here in Chennai are standing up and applauding them. If you ever wanted to see a victory for sport, here it is on your television screens, in your drawing rooms. Pakistan are taking a victory lap far away from their homeland, here in Chennai in India, and they are getting a rousing reception,"" Bhpgle said.""I’ve never seen a stronger statement in sport than this. This crowd has been absolutely fantastic. Pakistan realizes that. There has been no jingoism. The spectators have supported the home team as they must, but they have also appreciated everything that has happened in this match. If this isn’t what sport stands for, I don’t know what is.""The match ended on this day, January 31, in 1999.","Sachin Tendulkar scored 273 not out in the first Test against Pakistan in Chennai in 1999. The match was played at the MA Chidambaram Stadium, which was guarded by 3,000 police and military officials. India lost the Test by 16 runs, and Pakistan won the series 1-0.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127823603,imgsize-82656,width-400,resizemode-4/lkj-28.jpg"

Poll Will Pakistan participate in the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup? Yes, definitely No, they will not participate

NEW DELHI: As the cricketing world awaits final confirmation from the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) on the team’s participation in the upcoming ICC Men’s T20 World Cup, captain Salman Ali Agha has removed at least one uncertainty by firmly locking in his batting position for the global event.Pakistan are scheduled to depart for Colombo early on February 2, a move that has been widely interpreted as a strong signal that the team will take part in the tournament, co-hosted by India and Sri Lanka from February 7. A source close to the board told PTI that all travel arrangements are already in place, making a last-minute boycott highly unlikely.Even as the political and administrative suspense continues, Salman has made it clear that on-field plans are already taking shape. Following Pakistan’s opening T20I win over Australia in Lahore, the skipper confirmed that he will bat at No. 3 during the World Cup.“Yes, I’ll be batting at No. 3. We expect to face a lot of spin, and I believe I can dominate spin during the Powerplay. That’s why I moved up, and that is where I’ll stay,” Salman was quoted as saying by the ICC.The decision marks a significant shift for the right-hander, who has traditionally batted lower down the order in T20Is.His promotion was on display against Australia, where he struck a fluent 39 at No.3 to anchor Pakistan’s innings in their 22-run victory.Salman admitted Pakistan could have pushed on further with the bat but expressed confidence in his bowling unit. “We started well but couldn’t finish the way we wanted. After the first 10 overs, the ball stopped coming onto the bat,” he said. “To be honest, I felt 170 was enough. Our spin bowling is outstanding, and I knew it would be tough for them.”Pakistan defended 168 successfully, with Australian batters struggling against spin, losing six wickets in the chase.Off the field, speculation over Pakistan’s participation has refused to die down, following Bangladesh’s removal from the tournament. However, insiders insist the PCB’s approach is rooted in protecting Pakistan cricket’s long-term interests and maintaining relations with the ICC.","Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha confirms he will bat at No. 3 during the T20 World Cup.

Sanju Samson or Ishan Kishan? | Greenstone Lobo predicts the ideal player for T20 World Cup

With the ICC T20 World Cup 2026 just days away, Pakistan find themselves at the centre of a growing storm, with questions mounting over their participation despite having already announced their squad. While official signals suggest preparations are underway, a series of developments have kept boycott rumours alive and fans on edge.As per a report by news agency PTI, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) on Thursday said the team is scheduled to depart for Colombo early on February 2 — a move that appears to rule out any withdrawal from the tournament or the marquee clash against India on February 15. However, uncertainty continues to linger behind the scenes.The PTI report added that the PCB had expressed full support for the Bangladesh Cricket Board over their “security concerns” regarding playing in India, but acknowledged the board is constrained in taking the matter further without jeopardising its position within the ICC. A formal confirmation of Pakistan’s participation is expected on Friday.Despite these assurances, speculation in sections of the media about Pakistan pulling out of the World Cup or refusing to face India has refused to die down.The suspense deepened after reports surfaced that Pakistan’s official T20 World Cup kit launch had been abruptly cancelled.According to a report by ASports, the unveiling was scheduled to take place after the toss of the second T20 against Australia.

Shivam Dube press conference: On mindset shift, reading bowlers and dominating middle overs

Poll Do you believe Shivam Dube will significantly impact India's performance in the upcoming T20 World Cup? Yes, definitely Maybe, depends on form No, unlikely

It’s hard to find positives in a 50-run loss in a T20I game but the Indian team won’t be too unhappy with what transpired in the fourth T20I in Vizag. The 23-ball 65 by Shivam Dube after a top-order wobble was a reminder to opposition teams about the dynamite batter India will have up their sleeve in the middle order in the T20 World Cup starting next month.IPL watchers will know that teams are wary of using spin against Chennai Super Kings ’ Dube after the 10th over. In CSK, where the gentle giant has been playing since 2022, Dube has flourished in this role.Incidentally, Dube had made his T20I debut for India before he played for CSK. But in the 13 T20Is that he played before that as a middle-order batter who could bowl medium-pace, the left-hander failed to carve his niche. CSK first took note of him during an inconsequential IPL game in Abu Dhabi in 2021, when they had already qualified for a top-two finish.In that match, Dube was playing for Rajasthan Royals. Chasing 190, Dube came up with a 42-ball 64 which led to CSK’s defeat. MS Dhoni and CSK coach Stephen Fleming identified the talent that Dube had against spin and in the auctions for the 2022 edition, he was picked for Rs 4 crore.Still, Dube wasn’t a sure-fire selection. Before the IPL, five-time champions CSK had a training camp in Surat.During that camp, Dube’s over-boundaries, using his long levers against spin, were often beating MS Dhoni’s sixes by 20-30 metres. Some of those sixes even broke the window panes in the fourth-tier balconies of the stadium.That show convinced the management of his big-hitting abilities but Dube’s CSK stint hadn’t started on a happy note. He had given away 25 runs in the 19th over against LSG in Mumbai and had become a bit of a villain for the fans of the ‘Yellow Army’. But Dhoni stressed that bowling wasn’t the reason CSK had bought Dube and persisted with him purely as a batter.The temperamentally sound southpaw eventually announced himself with a 46-ball 95 against RCB in Mumbai, when he took down the likes of Wanindu Hasaranga and Glenn Maxwell. He hasn’t looked back since and despite several attempts by other franchises to lure him out of CSK, the team management has stuck with him, making him one of their highest-paid retainees for Rs 12 crore.While Dube has gone from strength to strength with his performances against spin, sometimes his technique against genuine pace has been a bit of a worry. The short ball has troubled him on and off but Dube has worked on it. These days, he is quite effective against medium-pacers, as was evident on Wednesday when he took on the likes of Zak Foulkes and Jacob Duffy.But during his four-year stint in CSK, one area that has been neglected a bit is his bowling. Due to the impact player rule, the think-tank hasn’t found the necessity to give him enough overs. But the Indian team management wants to use his bowling skills as well and in the Asia Cup final against Pakistan in Dubai last year, he was given the responsibility of opening the attack in spinfriendly conditions.Dube has developed a clever change of pace and the occasional wide yorker. One feels he isn’t too far behind with the ball to Nitish Reddy, who is being prepared as a back-up mediumpace allrounder for Hardik Pandya .",Shivam Dube has flourished in the middle order for Chennai Super Kings.

Highlighting that shift, Google CEO Sundar Pichai has backed the use of artificial intelligence in cricket following Google’s new partnership with the International Cricket Council (ICC).Announcing the collaboration on social media, Pichai — a known cricket enthusiast — summed it up with a witty post on X: “Now Google can help with your Googly.” The remark underlined how AI is moving beyond stats sheets to decoding the nuances of the game as it unfolds.As part of the partnership, Google demonstrated how its latest AI model, Gemini 3 Pro, can analyse live cricket footage. The technology is capable of watching a match, listening to commentary and explaining what is happening in simple, accessible language.Google said the initiative aims to make cricket more engaging and inclusive, especially for newer audiences. The collaboration will span multiple Google platforms, including Android, Google Gemini, Google Pay and Google Pixel, creating an integrated digital ecosystem around the sport.From discovering highlights to understanding key moments and celebrating victories, the focus is on enriching the entire fan journey.In a separate post, the Google Gemini account explained the technology’s potential: “We partnered with @ICC to show how Gemini 3 Pro can analyse video content. By uploading a segment of the Cricket World Cup, Gemini can seamlessly process visual and audio data to identify key players, explain techniques, and highlight crucial turning points.”With the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup set to begin on February 7 in India and Sri Lanka, the timing of the announcement signals how AI-driven insights could soon become part of how fans consume and understand cricket.","Google CEO Sundar Pichai has backed the use of artificial intelligence in cricket.

Nobbs’ India coaching stint lasted from June 2011 to July 2013.Nobbs was a member of the Australian team at the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles.

Nobbs successfully defeated cancer when it was initially diagnosed five years ago but suffered a relapse earlier last year.Nobbs took over the reins of the Indian men’s team at a particularly tough time. The highlight of Nobbs’ tenure was India’s qualification for the 2012 Olympics in London after the Beijing fall without losing a single match (six in total) during the qualifiers.

Virat Kohli's handle is back

The cause of the panic earlier

NEW DELHI: After hours of confusion, concern and meme-fuelled speculation on Friday morning, India's batting legend Virat Kohli ’s Instagram account is back online. India’s most-followed Instagram handle, which had suddenly disappeared earlier on Friday, reappeared without any official explanation from either the former India captain or Instagram, bringing relief to millions of cricket fans who had feared something was amiss.Kohli’s verified account — followed by over 274 million users — had vanished from searches and Instagram page, with fans encountering the familiar message: “This page isn’t available.” The unexplained blackout triggered widespread panic across social media, with supporters flooding platforms like X and Instagram in search of answers. As speculation snowballed, no clarification emerged from Kohli, his management team or Meta, leaving fans to fill the silence with theories, humour and concern.The sudden return of the account later in the day has eased nerves, but the lack of an official statement has kept the mystery alive. It remains unclear whether the disappearance was the result of a technical glitch, a temporary deactivation or a platform-related issue.During the brief outage, fans even turned to Kohli’s wife, actor Anushka Sharma, flooding her comment sections with anxious and playful messages asking about the cricketer’s missing account.Anushka, who has largely stayed away from the spotlight in recent months, did not respond publicly, consistent with the couple’s recent preference for privacy.Adding to the intrigue, Kohli’s brother Vikas Kohli’s Instagram account was also reported missing during the same period, further fuelling speculation. Meanwhile, Kohli’s account on X remained active throughout, though he did not address the Instagram episode there either.The blackout came at a time when Kohli has been in strong cricketing form, recently enjoying a productive run in international cricket and gearing up for the upcoming IPL 2026 season with Royal Challengers Bengaluru. His Instagram account, a major hub for brand collaborations, personal updates and fan engagement, is considered one of the most influential athlete profiles in the world.For now, the King is back on Instagram — but with silence from all sides, fans are still waiting for answers on what caused India’s biggest social media scare of the day.","Virat Kohli's Instagram account is back online after disappearing on Friday morning.

Italy’s landmark moment

Italy will make their T20 World Cup debut against Bangladesh on February 9 at the Eden Gardens in Kolkata. (Photo by Special Arrangement)

Cricket arrived in Italy long before it ever found an audience.Introduced by British sailors, diplomats and merchants, the game took root in pockets of Italian society before being overshadowed by football and, later, by political ideology. For decades, it survived on the fringes, sustained by expatriates and a small group of ""believers"". Yet the sport never disappeared.On February 9, at the iconic Eden Gardens, Italy will lock horns against Scotland, who have featured in the last four editions of the T20 World Cup but are playing this one only because Bangladesh pulled out. Italy are in Group C at the 2026 T20 World Cup alongside Scotland, England, Nepal and the West Indies.The squad reflects a striking blend of cultures and life stories, with players drawn from multiple countries and continents. Alongside Italians of Indian heritage are players with Pakistani and Sri Lankan roots, as well as from South Africa, England and Australia.Their circumstances vary just as widely. Some earn their living from the game, others balance semi-professional commitments or franchise cricket, while several juggle cricket with everyday jobs, from teaching and physiotherapy to hotel work.The Azzurri will be led by 42-year-old Wayne Madsen. The 15-member squad also includes former South African international JJ Smuts, and two pairs of brothers, Harry Manenti and Benjamin Manenti, and Anthony Mosca and Justin Mosca.The captain is buoyant and has warned that they are not going to be pushovers.“We’re looking to win games, and we believe we have the quality to play good cricket,” Madsen tells TimesofIndia.com from Dubai, where they played a three-match series against Ireland.“The boys have been together for a while and our preparation has been very good, so we’re confident and hopeful.”Cricket in Italy goes back centuries.Admiral Horatio Nelson arrived in Naples in 1793 with a clear objective, to secure reinforcements for the British Mediterranean fleet during the war against Revolutionary France. The mission succeeded, with more than 6,000 Neapolitan soldiers sent to Toulon in support of the British. During their stay in the Kingdom of Naples, Nelson and the sailors aboard HMS Agamemnon found ways to fill their spare time, leading to what is believed to be the first recorded cricket match played on Italian soil.A century later, in 1893, English consuls established the Genoa Cricket and Athletic Club. Initially focused on cricket, the club’s direction shifted in 1897 when James Richardson Spensley championed football. Genoa soon became better known for the new sport and won Italy’s first football championship in 1898.In 1899, Herbert Kilpin, considered the first English footballer to play abroad, met businessman Alfred Edwards in a Florence tavern and persuaded him to fund a new club. That club, founded as Milan Cricket and Football Club, later became AC Milan. While cricket initially formed part of its identity, it was abandoned by 1919 as football took precedence.Although cricket resurfaced briefly in the 1960s through informal tournaments in Rome, its English origins and Italy’s political climate ensured it remained on the margins, increasingly seen as a historical curiosity rather than a living sport.Luca Bruno Malaspina, the CEO of the Italian Cricket Federation, says cricket in Italy has found its second wind and they are targeting schools as a starting point to make the sport popular.“Cricket in Italy is growing from the ground up. Schools are the starting point, and through initiatives like the Scuola Attiva project, the number of schools involved in cricket is steadily increasing,” Malaspina tells TimesofIndia.com.“This is where the connection with local communities begins, introducing the sport to young people, building familiarity, and turning cricket from something perceived as foreign into a game that feels increasingly Italian.”Interestingly, if you are a young Italian, you will witness Italy's cricket team play a World Cup before the Azzurri take the field for the FIFA World Cup. Italian football is in shambles and has failed to qualify for the World Cup in 2018 - for the first time since 1958 - and then again in 2022. They are now in danger of missing the 2026 edition as well.On July 11, Jaspreet Singh, who hails from Phagwara in Punjab and moved to Italy in 2006, was in the middle of the most coveted moment in Italian cricket history. Jaspreet bowled the last ball of the men’s T20 World Cup Europe qualifier against the Netherlands. Although Italy lost the match by nine wickets, it sealed Italy’s first-ever qualification for the 2026 Men’s T20 World Cup.Jaspreet began by playing informal tape-ball games before finding his way to Bergamo Cricket Club, located about a 40-minute drive from his home in Telgate, a town about 60 kilometres north-east of Milan. His performances in competitions organised by the Italian Cricket Federation from the 2016–17 season helped fast-track his rise, leading to an international debut in 2019.Now based largely in Birmingham, Jaspreet trains there and features in the Birmingham District Premier League. To pursue his cricket career, he was forced to give up working as an Uber driver in the UK.The 32-year-old says the preparation for the World Cup has been spot on for the team and that he cannot wait to live his childhood dream.",Italy will make their T20 World Cup debut against Bangladesh on February 9 at the Eden Gardens in Kolkata.

T20 World Cup | Finn Allen eager to make the most out of India's smaller boundaries and flat wickets

NEW DELHI: Pakistan sealed a T20 series victory over Australia with a dominant 90-run win at Gaddafi Stadium on Saturday, even as uncertainty continued over their participation in the upcoming T20 World Cup.Spinners played a key role as Australia were bowled out for just 108 in 15.4 overs while chasing 199. Leg-spinners Abrar Ahmed (3-14) and Shadab Khan (3-26) led the charge and shared most of the wickets.Earlier, captain Salman Ali Agha’s 76 off 40 balls and Usman Khan’s 53 off 36 balls helped Pakistan post 198-5 after winning the toss and choosing to bat on a slow surface. Pakistan made a strong start and reached 72-2 in the powerplay, with Agha attacking both spin and pace confidently. However, Babar Azam continued to struggle in his new No. 4 role and he managed only 2 runs before getting out lbw.After the match, Agha said, ""I can easily say it was a perfect game for us and we want to replicate it tomorrow. I promoted myself at No. 3 because I know I can play spin well and intend to do the same in Sri Lanka."" Pakistan are scheduled to play their T20 World Cup matches in Sri Lanka, as the tournament will be co-hosted by India and Sri Lanka from February 7.Pakistan’s participation in the T20 World Cup remains unclear after the PCB cancelled the official unveiling of the team’s jersey, citing “unavoidable circumstances.”Reports suggest the board is waiting for government approval before confirming involvement.Australia struggled against spin throughout their innings. Travis Head fell cheaply again, while Mitchell Marsh scored 18 before getting out to Abrar. Josh Inglis and Matt Renshaw also failed to build partnerships. Cameron Green top-scored with 35 but could not prevent defeat.Australian captain Mitchell Marsh admitted, ""They put us under great pressure in the power play. It was probably a 160-170 wicket. We have got experienced guys who know that partnerships are really important in run-chases. We were not able to do that today, so some really good lessons.""The T20I series is already in Pakistan's pocket with a 2-0 edge. However, they will look to pull off a series sweep, which will be a massive boost in their T20 World Cup preparation.",Pakistan beat Australia by 90 runs to win T20 series 2-0. Australia bowled out for just 108 in 15.4 overs while chasing 199. Leg-spinners Abrar Ahmed and Shadab Khan took three wickets each.

The German football federation has ruled out a boycott of the World Cup despite calls from within to send a message to U.S. President Donald Trump “We believe in the unifying power of sport and the global impact that a FIFA World Cup can have, the federation said in a statement issued late Friday. “Our goal is to strengthen this positive force — not to prevent it. ”The federation, known as the DFB, said its executive committee met and discussed the option of a boycott of the tournament in the United States, Canada and Mexico, a consideration first proposed last week by DFB vice president Oke Göttlich.Göttlich, who is also the president of Bundesliga club St. Pauli, referred to Trump's recent actions and statements and said it was time to “seriously consider” a boycott.In what appears to be a public rebuke to Göttlich, however, the DFB said “debates on sports policy should be conducted internally and not in public.”The DFB said a boycott “is not currently under consideration. The DFB is in contact with representatives from politics, security, business, and sports in preparation for the tournament” from June 11-July 19.Trump has sowed discord in Europe with his takeover bid for Greenland and threats to impose tariffs on European countries that opposed it, while U.S.actions in Venezuela and at home in dealing with protests in American cities have also raised alarm.Former FIFA president Sepp Blatter last week advised fans to stay away from the tournament.When president, however, Blatter opposed calls to boycott the 2018 World Cup in Russia over concerns about Ukraine.“Football can not be boycotted in any country,” he said at the time.Ahead of this summer's tournament, fans have concerns about high ticket prices, while travel bans imposed by the Trump administration could also prohibit supporters from some competing nations from attending.Germany’s team, at least, will be there.“We want to compete fairly against the other qualified teams next summer,” the DFB said. “And we want fans worldwide to celebrate a peaceful festival of football in the stadiums and at fan zones — just as we experienced at the 2024 European Championship in our own country.”","The German football federation has ruled out a boycott of the World Cup despite calls from within to send a message to U.S. President Donald Trump.

Poll How do you feel about the crowd's behavior during the African Cup final? Completely unacceptable A result of passion Somewhat understandable

Africa’s football governing body has handed down fines exceeding $1 million and imposed multiple bans following a chaotic African Cup final that descended into protests, crowd trouble and ugly scenes on and off the pitch.The Confederation of African Football (CAF) announced the sanctions on Wednesday in response to the disorder-marred final between Senegal and hosts Morocco on January 18, a match that featured a dramatic walk-off protest, fans attempting to storm the field and even scuffles involving journalists. Crucially, CAF clarified that the bans apply only to African competitions and will not affect the upcoming World Cup in June, for which both Senegal and Morocco have already qualified.CAF fined the Senegalese Football Federation $615,000 and the Moroccan federation $315,000 for unsporting and improper conduct by players, coaching staff and supporters. Senegal coach Pape Thiaw received the heaviest individual punishment — a five-match ban in CAF competitions and a personal fine of $100,000 — after leading his players off the pitch in protest at a late penalty awarded to Morocco.The final was halted for around 15 minutes following the walk-off.When play resumed, Morocco missed the penalty and Senegal went on to clinch the African title with a 1-0 win after extra time.The fallout extended far beyond the walk-off. Supporters tried to breach the pitch, players from both teams clashed on the sidelines, and reporters from Senegal and Morocco were involved in fights in press areas. One of the most bizarre flashpoints came when Moroccan ball boys attempted to snatch a towel from Senegal goalkeeper Edouard Mendy, apparently to distract him. That incident alone resulted in an additional $200,000 fine for Morocco’s federation.Morocco coach Walid Regragui later described the spectacle as giving African football a “shameful” image, a comment that resonated as scrutiny intensified on the country, which will co-host the 2030 World Cup with Spain and Portugal and hopes to stage the final at the 115,000-capacity Hassan II Stadium currently under construction.CAF also banned Senegal’s Iliman Ndiaye and Ismaila Sarr for two matches each, while Morocco’s Achraf Hakimi received a two-match ban with one suspended. Ismael Saibari was hit with a three-match ban and a $100,000 fine for unsporting behaviour.An appeal by Morocco to have the result annulled and the title awarded to them was dismissed. The match even strained diplomatic ties, though Senegal Prime Minister Ousmane Sonko later played down the fallout, calling the reaction “emotional outbursts produced by fervor” rather than a deeper rift.","Africa's football governing body hands down fines exceeding $1 million.

The Chinese Football Association (CFA) announced Thursday that 73 people, including former national team coach Li Tie, have been banned for life, and 13 professional clubs have been fined for match-fixing and corruption.The punishments come as part of a wider anti-corruption campaign under President Xi Jinping, which has removed several CFA officials and banned dozens of players for match-fixing and gambling.The statement did not say when the most recent match-fixing occurred or give details of the cases.The punishments were made after a ""systematic review"" and were needed ""to enforce industry discipline, purify the football environment, and maintain fair competition"", the CFA wrote on its official social media account Thursday.Li Tie, a former Everton player who coached China’s national team from 2019 to 2021, is already serving a 20-year prison sentence for bribery, after being sentenced in December 2024.Chen Xuyuan, former CFA chairman, is also serving a life sentence for accepting $11 million in bribes.Of the 16 teams in the 2025 Chinese Super League, 11 will face point deductions and fines.Tianjin Jinmen Tiger and last season’s runners-up Shanghai Shenhua will each lose 10 points and pay a one million yuan ($144,000) fine when the 2026 season begins.Shanghai Port, champions for the past three seasons, and Beijing Guoan will each lose five points and pay a 400,000-yuan fine.","73 people, including former national team coach Li Tie, have been banned for life. 13 professional clubs have been fined for match-fixing and corruption.

The fixtures, running until May 17, are provisional as the All India Football Federation (AIFF) is looking to find a broadcaster to showcase India's top-division football.The AIFF is in the process of finding a suitable bidder to produce and broadcast the 91-match competition. If and when the bidder is found, the fixtures could be jiggled to meet the broadcasters' criteria.Four entities - FanCode, Sony Sports Network, Zee Sports and UK-based Two Circles - had attended the pre-bid conference. There is a possibility that more could throw their hat in the ring before the February 1 final date for submission of bids.As the process continues to unravel behind the scenes at the Football House (AIFF's headquarters) in New Delhi, there are a couple of questions that remain unanswered. Chief among them is the relegation clause.Promotion has been a part of the ISL since the 2022-23 season with Inter Kashi the latest team to come up the ladder from the I-League. Relegation, however, has never been a feature of the league that began in 2014.After Football Sports Development Limited's (FSDL) contract to run the ISL expired in December 2025, it is the first time that the AIFF are in charge of operating the ISL. The position on relegation gets trickier because of the Supreme Court-ratified Constitution.As per the Constitution adopted in October 2025, AIFF have the control over relegation rule. As per Article 63, ""Without prejudice to the foregoing, the AIFF shall have the right and discretion to take all decisions of any nature pertaining to any aspect of any competition. While exercising such discretion, the AIFF shall have due regard to the interests of the sport of Football in India and shall not be bound by any request or demand of any third party in this regard. If any of its powers or functions are delegated to third parties, such delegation shall be done in good faith and also ensuring that the AIFF retains primacy on all Essential Aspects.""A closer look at the definition of ""Essential Aspects"" explains it as ""preservation of the sanctity of promotion and relegation, and ensuring of compliance with FIFA/AFC statues with respect to the sport of football.""In essence, promotion and relegation are mandatory from the 2025/26 season onwards in the ISL.An AIFF insider told TimesofIndia.com that the relegation rules will be followed as per what is written in the Constitution.However, a majority of ISL clubs are not happy with the idea. With the season already starting five months late and to be played in a truncated format, the clubs are expecting minimal revenue. The financial strain has forced the clubs to reduce costs through operational cutbacks and salary corrections. A few clubs even paused first team operations before a headway arrived on January 6 courtesy Sports Minister Mansukh Mandaviya's intervention.One ISL club official has even asked AIFF to take cognisance of the situation and invoke force majeure, which is possible as per the AIFF Constitution.Article 78 reads: ""The General Body shall have the final decision on any matters not provided for in this Constitution and Regulations, or in cases of force majeure. General Body shall be competent to decide whether a situation amounts to force majeure scenario or not.""As things stand, AIFF has not approached the Supreme Court seeking a one-time relaxation from relegation for the 2025-26 ISL season. With two weeks to go into the start of the season, it remains to be seen if they will go against not just the Constitution but also the AFC Statutes.","The 2025-26 Indian Super League (ISL) season is tentatively scheduled to get underway on February 14.

Mike Macdonald keeps the Seahawks locked in despite Drake Maye's injury



Head Coach Mike Macdonald On Super Bowl Preparations & The Importance Of The Team's Culture

Drake Maye’s name on the injury report has changed the tone of Super Bowl week in Las Vegas. The Patriots QB is now dealing with a right shoulder issue and an illness, just days before New England faces the Seahawks in the most-awaited Super Bowl LX on Feb. 8, 2026.What made the situation louder was not panic from Foxborough, but calm from the other sideline. Seahawks HC Mike Macdonald spoke openly and made it clear that Maye’s injury has not changed Seattle’s mindset.Macdonald addressed reporters during Seattle’s Super Bowl media session on Friday. When asked if Maye’s shoulder issue altered his defensive game plan, his answer was short.“None,” Macdonald said at the podium during media availability.“Our focus is on preparing for the championship game.”That response came as concern grew around Maye’s status. The star QB missed Friday’s practice because of the shoulder injury and a non-COVID illness, per the team’s injury report. He remains listed as questionable.The injury happened during the AFC Championship Game against the Denver Broncos. Safety Talanoa Hufanga tackled Maye at the end of a 13-yard scramble in the third quarter.Hufanga landed on Maye’s throwing shoulder, and the quarterback stayed down briefly before returning.Despite the setback, Macdonald continued to stress respect for Maye’s game:“He is a tremendous player,” Macdonald said during Super Bowl Opening Night in Las Vegas. “He’s strong. He’s fast. Great arm talent. Great decision-making. We’ve got to be on our stuff.”HC further added in the same interview: “We’re going through that process right now of how we want to play,” Macdonald said. “I think the key is trying to create as many of those (third-and-long) situations as possible.”Maye’s numbers explain the concern. He threw for 4,394 yards, 31 TDs, and eight interceptions during the 2025 regular season. He also rushed for 450 yards. In the playoffs, he added 4 passing TDs and ran for 131 yards across two games.Maye spoke about his shoulder on Thursday during an interview with WEEI in Boston.“I’m feeling good,” Maye said. “It’s been a long stretch of throwing. Thirty weeks straight can add up. I got extra rest, and I’ll be ready.”Seattle also has its own health concerns. Seahawks QB Sam Darnold is nursing an oblique injury. He practiced on a limited basis this week but is expected to start.The injury report may grow longer, but Macdonald’s message stayed simple. Seattle is preparing for the same Drake Maye. Hurt or not, he remains the center of this Super Bowl.","Drake Maye missed Friday’s practice because of the shoulder injury and a non- COVID illness.

"""It’s over"": Cardi B issues clear warning to Stefon Diggs that infidelity and cheating would end their relationship",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/its-over-cardi-b-issues-clear-warning-to-stefon-diggs-that-infidelity-and-cheating-would-end-their-relationship/articleshow/127829869.cms,"Cardi B has reportedly made her expectations clear to boyfriend Stefon Diggs, warning that any infidelity or secret children after they became official would end their relationship. While supportive of Diggs as a father, sources say Cardi B views loyalty and honesty as non negotiable and has drawn firm boundaries amid ongoing public scrutiny.

As scrutiny grows, Cardi B draws clear relationship limits with Stefon Diggs

Public relationships survive on trust, but celebrity relationships survive on clarity. Cardi B has made hers unmistakably clear. As attention swirls around Stefon Diggs and his rapidly expanding family tree, the rapper has privately set firm boundaries about what she will and will not accept going forward.Those close to the couple say this is not about revisiting old history. It is about protecting the future. Cardi B, now navigating motherhood and public scrutiny at the same time, has reportedly told Diggs that loyalty is non negotiable. If another child appears after they became official, she would be “done”. The word choice is simple. The message is final.“She’s been very clear with Stefon: if he messes up, if another woman comes forward with a baby after they became official and started a family together, she’s done,” an insider told the Sun in a report published on Saturday. “She told him plainly that if he cheats or has a child behind her back, it’s over.”Diggs’ personal life has followed him almost as closely as his football career. In 2025 alone, he reportedly welcomed four children with four different women, including a son with Cardi B in November. The numbers sparked online debate, memes, and criticism, but insiders say Cardi B never tried to rewrite his past. Instead, she focused on who he is now.Her friends state that she is very supportive of Diggs as a father and honors his co parenting duties. She is said to consider the children as one of the extended family and values that he is still there in their lives. Such support, however, comes with terms that are based on honesty and accountability.The time of this strong position is important. Diggs is also experiencing legal problems that are not related to his relationship but this has only added more attention to the interest of the people on his personal decisions. Throughout it, Cardi B has been by his side when criticism is dripping down social media. Sayeth sources that that loyalty is not blind. It is measured.In the case of Cardi B, love is not a matter of silence and a complete lack of sacrifice. It is making mental drawing lines and taking a stand by them. Her message will not go the same in an industry where cynicism can be taken as dedication. Scandal is not the subject of this chapter. It is concerning limits, being an adult and the price of betraying trust, in the face of everything being on the table.","Cardi B has reportedly made her expectations clear to boyfriend Stefon Diggs, warning that any infidelity or secret children after they became official would end their relationship.

“Soft launch of the breakup”: Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift face growing questions over delayed wedding,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/soft-launch-of-the-breakup-travis-kelce-and-taylor-swift-face-growing-questions-over-delayed-wedding/articleshow/127819998.cms,"Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift have reportedly paused their wedding plans, sparking online speculation about deeper issues. While the delay has been linked to Kelce’s uncertain NFL future and outside pressures, fans and pundits are questioning whether the carefully framed explanation masks strain or strategic silence surrounding one of pop culture’s most scrutinized relationships.

Fans question timing of Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce wedding pause

Speculation around Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce has intensified again, this time fueled by reports that their wedding plans have quietly stalled. What initially sounded like a practical pause tied to football decisions has quickly taken on a life of its own. In the Swift-Kelce universe, nothing lands as just logistics. Every detail invites interpretation.The timing has raised eyebrows. Kelce is weighing his future in the NFL, while Swift continues navigating public scrutiny that now stretches beyond music. Fans are not simply asking when the wedding will happen. They are asking why this story needed to surface at all. That question has opened the door to theories that go well beyond scheduling conflicts.A TikTok creator known as isitherightword pushed back on the official framing, suggesting the explanation felt incomplete. “To me, that just, quite frankly, does not sound like the full truth,” the creator said, adding, “Why would you need to announce it to the press?” The creator went further, arguing the timing could signal something else entirely, calling it “a soft launch of the breakup.”Other online chatter has layered on additional tension. Blind items referenced by fans hinted at “prenup negotiations not going as planned,” while past questions surrounding Kelce’s charity resurfaced.One commenter noted, “That whole charity mismanagement thing is very antithetical to the Taylor Swift brand.”External pressures may also be at play. A report cited Kelce’s concern that Swift’s recently revealed text messages, connected to legal filings involving Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni, could result in her being called to testify. “The possibility of having to cancel or reschedule plans because of a court appearance would be a massive disappointment in his eyes,” a source told The U.S. Sun. The same source said the situation left Kelce feeling “stressed. ”Not all fans believe trouble is brewing. Some argue the couple may be shielding their plans from overexposure. “It’s wild to me that nobody is considering that they’re leaking these stories so that their actual wedding day ends up being a secret,” one contributor suggested.Adding to that view, Swift’s mother Andrea and Kelce’s mom Donna were recently seen together at Sundance, an image that hinted at calm rather than crisis. For now, the pause remains undefined. Whether it signals strategy or strain, the silence keeps fans guessing and watching closely.",Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift have reportedly paused their wedding plans.

Jeff Rodgers brings over two decades of NFL expertise

Joe Brady continues reshaping his coaching staff

The Buffalo Bills are still changing their coaching staff under new head coach Joe Brady. Their most recent hire adds both experience and steadiness. The team has hired Jeff Rodgers as its new special teams coordinator. Adding a seasoned coach to a staff that is undergoing significant change ahead of the 2026 season.Rodgers joins Buffalo after an eight-year stint with the Arizona Cardinals, where he served as special teams coordinator and assistant head coach. With more than two decades of NFL experience in special teams, the 48-year-old coach steps into a key role as the Bills look to fine-tune every phase of their roster following another playoff exit.Rodgers enters his 23rd NFL season as a special teams coach. Before his time in Arizona, he held the same role with the Chicago Bears from 2015 to 2017. His resume also includes stops with the Denver Broncos, Carolina Panthers, and San Francisco 49ers.Over the years, he has built a reputation for developing reliable kicking units and disciplined coverage teams. During his tenure with the Cardinals and Broncos, he worked closely with veteran kicker Matt Prater, who set multiple franchise and league records for long-distance field goals under Rodgers’ guidance.Rodgers replaces Chris Tabor, who departed Buffalo after one season to join the Miami Dolphins. For Brady, bringing in a coach with such extensive experience signals a focus on details and execution, especially in close games where special teams often prove decisive.The Rodgers hire comes as part of a broader restructuring in Buffalo. Since taking over, Brady has quickly filled key positions on his staff. The Bills recently brought in Pete Carmichael Jr. as offensive coordinator and reportedly hired Jim Leonhard to lead the defense.While Brady is expected to continue calling plays on offense, his additions show a clear intent to surround himself with experienced coordinators who can handle their units independently.Special teams may not grab headlines like offense or defense, but they remain crucial in playoff-caliber matchups. Field position, kicking accuracy, and return efficiency can swing tight contests, an area Buffalo will be eager to improve after falling short in the postseason once again.","Buffalo Bills have hired Jeff Rodgers as their new special teams coordinator.

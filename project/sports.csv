Rohit Sharma’s last press conference as a captain

NEW DELHI: The IPL match between Punjab Kings and Delhi Capitals on Thursday was abandoned midway due to air raid alerts in the neighbouring cities of Jammu and Pathankot, casting a cloud of uncertainty over the remainder of the tournament. Punjab Kings were in a dominant position at 122 for 1 in 10.1 overs when the lights suddenly went out — initially assumed to be a floodlight malfunction.The game had already started later than scheduled, with growing concerns over the escalating cross-border tensions in the region.As security agencies swung into action, both teams and the packed crowd — around 23,000 spectators at the scenic Dharamsala venue — were safely evacuated from the stadium.Amid the evacuation, several fans were heard chanting anti-Pakistan slogans as panic and anger spread through the stands.Before the abrupt halt, Punjab’s opening pair had provided a fiery start — Prabhsimran Singh was unbeaten on 50 off 28 balls, while Priyansh Arya smashed a quickfire 70 off 34 before falling to pacer T Natarajan.With the situation tense, players and support staff from both franchises will now be transported to Delhi via a special train arranged from Pathankot, roughly 85 km away from Dharamsala.""We are organising a special train from close to Dharamsala to bring everybody home safely. As of now the match has been called off and the stadium has been evacuated. We will take a call on the tournament's future depending on the situation tomorrow. As of now, players' safety is utmost important. The match couldn't have continued tonight because of the situation.

As of now, there is no clarity over the game in Lucknow tomorrow (between Lucknow Super Giants and Royal Challengers Bengaluru).The Indian cricket board will proceed further based on the directive they get from the Indian government, and all teams will act as per the guidelines they receive.

Chennai Super Kings, long out of the playoff race, played spoilsport at Eden Gardens with a spirited victory over Kolkata Knight Riders in Match 57 of IPL 2025. The win, only their third of the season, has dented KKR’s campaign at a crucial juncture.KKR, who were pushing for a late surge into the top four, remain stuck on 11 points from 12 games. Their Net Run Rate (NRR) has also taken a hit, pushing them further behind Delhi Capitals in the mid-table battle. With just two games left, KKR now not only need to win both but also hope for favourable results from other matches to stay alive in the playoff race.CSK, meanwhile, are still at the bottom of the table. They now have 3 wins from 12 games, While still out of contention, the win was a morale-booster for a side enduring its toughest IPL season in recent memory.Gujarat Titans sit atop with 16 points from 12 matches and a robust NRR of +0.753. Their eighth win puts them within touching distance of a playoff berth.Royal Challengers Bengaluru are second with 16 points as well, having played one game fewer. Their NRR of +0.482 gives them a good cushion. Punjab Kings remain in third with 15 points from 11 games and a healthy NRR of +0.376. They’re hot on the heels of the top two.Quiz: Who's that IPL player? Mumbai Indians are fourth with 14 points and the best NRR in the league at +1.156.

Delhi Capitals are fifth with 13 points in 11 matches, staying in contention with a NRR of +0.362.KKR are now sixth, still on 11 points from 12 games, with NRR of +0.193 and their path to qualification looks increasingly steep.

They had lost 12 consecutive matches while chasing 180+ totals prior to this win.Only Punjab Kings (15 between 2015-2021) have endured a longer losing streak in such chases, while Royal Challengers Bengaluru also had 12 unsuccessful attempts from 2019 to 2023.CSK's chase of 180 is now the second-highest successful run chase in IPL history after being 75 or fewer for 5 wickets. They were 60 for 5 at one stage. The only higher successful chase in such a scenario came earlier this season when Delhi Capitals chased down 210 after being 65 for 5 against LSG in Vizag.","Chennai Super Kings beat Kolkata Knight Riders by two wickets.

Mumbai: In developments that have cast a dark shadow over the remainder of IPL 2025 , the match between Punjab Kings and Delhi Capitals at the Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association Stadium in Dharamshala was called off on Thursday night due to attacks from Pakistan in various parts of India.The match was halted after 10.1 overs, with Punjab Kings cruising at 122/1, when the floodlights were suddenly turned off.All players, IPL officials, and support staff were immediately evacuated from the stadium.Sources said the BCCI fears the development could cause panic in IPL camps, and foreign players could be uncomfortable about staying back. At the time of going to print, no call had been taken on Friday’s game in Lucknow.“It is on as of now but obviously it is an evolving situation,” IPL chairman Arun Dhumal told PTI, adding: “A decision will be taken keeping the best interest of all stakeholders in mind. We haven’t received any directive from the government. We are reviewing the situation right now.”BCCI secretary Devajit Saikia told TOI , “We have abandoned Thursday’s match considering the security of the players, officials and spectators. There’s no direct threat in Dharamshala but in view of developments in nearby areas, we’ve taken this precautionary call.”Asked about the fate of the remaining matches and whether the IPL would continue, Saikia added, “We will assess tonight’s developments and take a decision tomorrow.”There were reports suggesting that players, support staff, team owners (including Punjab Kings co-owner Preity Zinta, who was present at the venue), and fans might be evacuated by train. “I can’t disclose logistical details. There are multiple travel options from Dharamshala. With the airport shut, we’ll have to explore alternatives,” said Saikia.An emergency meeting of the IPL governing council was reportedly convened in Dharamshala, which incidentally is the home ground of the IPL chairman. Videos showing Dhumal urging fans to evacuate the stadium quickly went viral on Thursday night.The capacity of the picturesque ground here is approximately 23,000 and it was packed to about 80% at the time of evacuation. “There was no panic from the spectators. They (spectators and players) were moved out of the stadium very carefully and safely,” an HPCA source said.Prabhsimran Singh was batting at 50 off 28 balls while his opening partner Priyansh Arya made 70 off 34 balls before getting dismissed by pacer T Natarajan before proceedings came to a halt as the floodlights went out.(With inputs from agencies)","The match between Punjab Kings and Delhi Capitals at the Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association Stadium in Dharamshala was called off on Thursday night.

Lucknow’s remaining three matches are vital, two at home and one away.Even if they win all three, they will need a lot of other results to go their way.

They have enjoyed one of their most consistent seasons. Importantly, Virat Kohli has continued to pile on the runs, providing the platform for the likes of Romario Shepherd to explode at the end.

Rishabh Pant-led Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) will lock horns with Rajat Patidar's Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) in match no. 59 of the Indian Premier League (IPL) at the Ekana Cricket Stadium , Lucknow, on Thursday.LSG have endured four losses in their last five games and are currently placed seventh on the table with 10 points from 11 matches.RCB, on the other hand, have been sensational this season, winning eight and losing just three of their 11 matches to sit in the top two in the standings.LSG's middle order has looked vulnerable. Captain Rishabh Pant has been horrible this season, and David Miller also hasn't scored many runs.Meanwhile, for Bengaluru, Virat Kohli has been immaculate with the bat. He has scored 505 runs, including seven fifties. He is currently fourth on the Orange Cap leaderboard and only six runs away from claiming the top position.Mixed soil (70% black, 30% red), slightly off-centre, balanced but favours spinners. The red-soil pitch offers bounce and carry for pacers early, while black-soil aids spin in the middle overs.Behaviour: Two-paced with grass patches, supports change-of-pace bowling. Batters thrive in the powerplay (avg. run rate 8.94), but spinners dominate later.Quiz: Who's that IPL player? : Aiden Markram, Nicholas Pooran, Rishabh Pant (w/c), Abdul Samad, Ayush Badoni, David Miller, Akash Maharaj Singh, Digvesh Singh Rathi, Avesh Khan, Mayank Yadav, Prince YadavImpact Sub: Mitchell Marsh: Jacob Bethell, Virat Kohli, Devdutt Padikkal, Rajat Patidar (c), Jitesh Sharma (w), Tim David, Krunal Pandya, Romario Shepherd, Bhuvneshwar Kumar , Lungi Ngidi, Yash DayalImpact Sub: Suyash SharmaRCB and LSG have faced each other in 5 matches in the IPL.

TOI has learnt that the 3:30 pm match on May 11 between Punjab Kings and Mumbai Indians, originally scheduled at the Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association Stadium in Dharamshala, has been moved to Ahmedabad.This change comes as the Dharamshala airport — located in the hilly state of Himachal Pradesh near the Pakistan border — remains shut until May 10.“The BCCI approached us with a request to hold the match and we expressed our readiness for it,” Gujarat Cricket Association (GCS) secretary Anil Patel told TOI .The match at the Narendra Modi Stadium is expected to begin at 3:30 pm, the same time it was originally scheduled to start.

‘Baby AB’: CSK discover its new enforcer in IPL 2025,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/ipl/top-stories/baby-ab-csk-discover-its-new-enforcer-in-ipl-2025/articleshow/121014811.cms,"Chennai Super Kings' Dewald Brevis (PTI Photo)

CHENNAI: In a season where much has seemed offcolour for Chennai Super Kings , powerhitter Dewald Brevis seems a bright spot for the fivetime IPL champions. The 22-year-old South African, known as ‘ Baby AB ’ (for his AB de Villiers-esque strokeplay), went unsold at the IPL mega auction following a relatively quiet stint with Mumbai Indians. But fate had other plans.Drafted mid-season as a replacement for Gurjapneet Singh, Brevis was handed a crucial role that CSK had struggled to fill, that of an aggressive middle-order enforcer who can tilt the tempo in the middle and back end of an innings.“I watched the first half of the IPL and it was torturing. I was eager just to get here,” Brevis had said.Brevis wasted no time making an impact. Slotted into a misfiring batting unit, Brevis settled seamlessly into the middle order (at No. 5 & No. 6). In the four matches he has played, the explosive batter has accumulated 126 runs, with three scores above 30, and a healthy strike rate of 163.64 — his best in the IPL so far.On Wednesday against KKR, Brevis showed spark and spunk to illustrate just how quickly he can turn a game. His base-ball bat arcs and down-theground brutality brought a kind of raw, fearless power that CSK’s batting had sorely lacked earlier this season. He played a superlative knock (52, 25b; 4x6, 4x4) at a strike rate of 208.00 and unleashed a relentless assault on KKR seamer Vaibhav Arora, plundering him for 30 runs in an over: 6, 4, 4, 6, 6, 4.Former Australia cricketer Tom Moody, who has coached various IPL sides, said, “This could be one of CSK’s best signings of the decade. Brevis is an exceptionally talented player and he’s just starting to realise that talent.”That single over shifted the momentum in CSK’s favour, propelling them to victory. “That over was basically very ‘in the moment’. I took it ball by ball. The last ball, when I just slammed it towards the covers, that was so satisfying. It was just watching the ball and reacting to it. This is what IPL is all about, the moment. When there’s an open door, slam it down,"" Brevis said.","Dewald Brevis was drafted in as a replacement for Gurjapneet Singh. The 22-year- old South African went unsold at the IPL mega auction.

India may miss Rohit Sharma in England,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/india-may-miss-rohit-sharma-in-england/articleshow/121014694.cms,"രോഹിത് ശർമ

MUMBAI: It is ironic that the man often hailed for hitting the maximum number of sixes by an Indian cricketer in international cricket (637) is being remembered for the number of deliveries he left alone during India’s 2021 Test tour of England.Rohit Sharma, who retired from Test cricket on Wednesday after wearing Cap No. 280 — presented by Sachin Tendulkar in 2013 — 67 times, shouldered arms 182 times in four Tests on that England tour, during which he scored 368 runs.He faced a mammoth 866 balls. And he did not allow the ego of the God-gifted strokemaker to infiltrate his resolve in playing out 680 dots.That tour came in the middle of a five-year patch — starting 2019 — when he was arguably India’s best Test batter, after having metamorphosed into an opener in the home series against South Africa.That happened thanks to the encouragement from then-captain Virat Kohli and coach Ravi Shastri, who were keen to create an opening for someone who could play high pace comfortably and did not want to compromise on playing five bowlers, which meant playing a batter less.“The ability to adapt and adjust to conditions because of tremendous maturity,” says former India skipper and chief selector Dilip Vengsarkar on what made Rohit, a white-ball monster, a successful Test batter.“Fantastic defensive game and an in-born game-sense that every Mumbai batter usually has,” analyses former India batter and Mumbai coach Pravin Amre, under whom Rohit made his Ranji debut.Vengsarkar, who saw a young Rohit smash a hundred in one of the matches for a U-19 tournament in 2004 as Mumbai chief selector and chairman of the Talent Resource Development Wing (TRDW), says, “He has that rare gift to pick length early. That allows him to defend or attack off front or back foot.”Rohit’s temperament also is another key attribute that Vengsarkar highlights. “He never takes pressure about bowlers or conditions.”Vengsarkar, the only batter to have scored three successive centuries at Lord’s, veered away from popular sentiment about the timing of Rohit’s quitting. “I fear that India will miss him as an experienced opener. He batted very well in 2021, left a lot of balls and batted time. He should have waited till the tour of England and then quit.”Rohit was a beneficiary of living in Mumbai, where people bend rules to accommodate kids with special gifts. Ramakant Achrekar ferried Sachin Tendulkar on his scooter between maidans to get him match practice.For Rohit, Amre, Mumbai’s coach in 2006, did something similar. The Australian team were in India for the 2006 Champions Trophy and were playing Mumbai in a warm-up match at MIG. Rohit was out for eight to Brad Hogg, but Amre wanted people to see Rohit’s talent.“I met captain Ricky Ponting and coach John Buchanan and asked them if Rohit can bat again. Since it was a warm-up game, they allowed it, and he smashed 41 in 19 balls, hitting three fours in a Nathan Bracken over.” It was mission accomplished. Rohit was in the Mumbai team.“And in his third game against Gujarat, he smashed 205 to turn around a season in which the domestic giants were battling relegation and ended up winning the trophy. Batting overnight on 102 on Christmas Day in 2006, Rohit told reporters at the end of play at the Wankhede, “ Kal do sau maaronga (I will hit 200 tomorrow).”“He had that confidence always,” says Amre, and adds that as a coach, what drew attention was the sound Rohit’s bat always made.“He used to play a lot of shots and get caught in the outfield initially. Maybe that is why the early consistency was lacking. But once he figured out his game, he became consistent. But I still feel he did not do justice to his talent as a Test batter.”That could be because of the early desperation of not being able to break into the team. Says Vengsarkar, “India had Virender Sehwag, Rahul Dravid, Sachin Tendulkar, and VVS Laxman. There was no place.”When the opportunity came in 2010 in Nagpur vs South Africa as Laxman was injured, he stepped onto Wriddhiman Saha’s foot while playing a game of rocket ball and twisted his ankle. Guess who debuted as a batter? Saha.It was indeed a quirk of fate that his renaissance as a Test batter happened against South Africa in Vizag in 2019. And for four-and-a-half years and 32 Tests since then, till England left Dharamshala in March 2024, only two other openers averaged more than Rohit’s 50.03 — Sri Lanka’s Dimuth Karunaratne (52.40) and Usman Khawaja (51.08). It was a bowling dominated era in which teams played on spicy pitches to accumulate WTC points.While Rohit’s career and impact transcended stats, here is another one that merits attention. All 12 of his hundreds resulted in an India win.","Rohit Sharma retired from Test cricket on Wednesday after wearing Cap No. 280 — presented by Sachin Tendulkar in 2013 — 67 times.

But fate had other plans.Drafted mid-season as a replacement for Gurjapneet Singh, Brevis was handed a crucial role that CSK had struggled to fill – an aggressive middle-order enforcer who can tilt the tempo in the middle and back end of an innings.“I’ve been watching the first half of the IPL, and it was torturing. I was sitting and eager just to get here,” Brevis had said in a video posted by CSK on their social media.Brevis’ hunger was evident as he wasted no time making an impact. Slotted into a misfiring batting unit, Brevis settled seamlessly into the middle order (at No. 5 & No.6). In the four matches he has played, the explosive batter has accumulated 126 runs, with three scores above 30, and a healthy strike rate of 163.64 — his best in the IPL so far. And on Wednesday against Kolkata Knight Riders, Brevis showed spark and spunk to illustrate just how quickly he can turn a game. His base-ball bat arcs and down-the-ground brutality brought a kind of raw, fearless power that CSK’s batting had sorely lacked earlier this season. He played a superlative knock (52, 25b; 4x6, 4x4) at a strike rate of 208.00 and unleashed a relentless assault on KKR seamer Vaibhav Arora, plundering him for 30 runs in an over: 6, 4, 4, 6, 6, 4.Former Australia cricketer Tom Moody, who has coached various IPL sides, said in a post-match show: “This could be one of CSK’s best signings of the decade. Brevis is an exceptionally talented player, and he’s just starting to realise that talent.”That single over on Wednesday shifted the momentum in CSK’s favour, propelling them to victory. “That over was basically very ‘in the moment’. I took it ball by ball. The last ball, when I just slammed it towards the covers, that was so satisfying. It was just watching the ball and reacting to it. This is what IPL and T20 cricket is all about, at this moment. When there’s an open door, you have to slam it down,” Brevis said after the match.But Brevis is not content with explosive cameos; he has a bigger goal in mind. He aims to evolve into a dependable finisher, a role which skipper MS Dhoni has mastered over the years.“He’s (MS) a legend. It’s great to be part of his team and learn from him, because my goal is that I want to also be the guy that’s there at the end, getting the team over the line. I think it’s a process, you have to learn it your way and be true to yourself. The more I play, the more I will figure my way out,” Brevis, who also occasionally bowls leg spin, said.It’s still early, but Brevis has shown signs of being more than a temporary fix. He could well be one of the missing pieces that CSK have been yearning for over the last couple of seasons.","Dewald Brevis has been a bright spot for Chennai Super Kings this season.

Explained: Why Rohit Sharma retired from Test cricket

Match 58 of IPL 2025 between Punjab Kings and Delhi Capitals on Thursday was cancelled midway following air raid alerts in neighbouring cities of Jammu and Pathankot , putting the entire league at risk of being called off due to India's ongoing military conflict with Pakistan. Punjab were 122 for 1 in 10.1 overs when lights went out which at first was attributed to floodlight failure.Both teams were awarded a point each.Punjab, now on 16 points from 12 matches, stay in third place with a steady Net Run Rate (NRR) of +0.376. With two games still to play, they remain very much in control of their own destiny. Delhi Capitals, on the other hand, moved to 14 points from 12 matches with the extra point, but will now likely need to win both of their remaining fixtures to secure qualification given the congestion at the top.The shared points also leave the door slightly ajar for Kolkata Knight Riders and Lucknow Super Giants , both of whom need near-perfect finishes and some favourable results to break into the top four.Gujarat Titans remain top with 16 points from 12 matches and a strong NRR of +0.793. Royal Challengers Bengaluru also have 16 points from 11 matches and a solid NRR of +0.482, putting them in a strong position.Punjab Kings, with today’s point, are third on 16 points from 12 matches and an NRR of +0.376. Mumbai Indians sit fourth with 14 points and the league’s best NRR of +1.156 from 12 matches.Delhi Capitals follow in fifth with 14 points from 12 games and an NRR of +0.362. Their playoff hopes remain alive but the road has narrowed.Kolkata Knight Riders are sixth with 11 points from 12 games and an NRR of +0.249. They’ll need big wins and help from other results to keep hopes alive. Lucknow Super Giants have 10 points from 11 matches with an NRR of -0.469 and must win out while improving their net run rate.Sunrisers Hyderabad (7 points, NRR -1.192), Rajasthan Royals (6 points, NRR -0.718), and Chennai Super Kings (6 points, NRR -1.117) are already out of playoff contention.","Match 58 of IPL 2025 between Punjab Kings and Delhi Capitals was cancelled midway following air raid alerts in neighbouring cities of Jammu and Pathankot.

It has been a long, hard road,"" PSG captain Marquinhos told broadcaster Canal Plus.""The job is done in terms of getting to the final but it's not finished, we want more.

NEW DELHI: With only two days remaining for the official commencement of the SAFF U-19 football championship in Arunachal Pradesh , concerns have arisen about the seamless organisation of the six-nation tournament due to the absence of a ‘ Protected Area Permit ’ (PAP) or ‘Restricted Area Permit’ (RAP) document. This mandatory official paper is required for entry into the north-eastern state by visiting foreigners, including the participating teams.Hosts India are drawn alongside Nepal and Sri Lanka in Group B of the event, while Maldives, Bhutan and Bangladesh form Group A.The championship – the third edition of the regional U-19 men’s tournament – is scheduled to be played at the Golden Jubilee stadium in Arunachal’s Yupia from May 9 to 18. However, it’s been learnt that the organisers of the event are still awaiting the PAP/RAP clearance, so that the visiting teams can enter the state.While sources in the central govt say some state authorities who have been delegated the powers to issue a PAP/RAP can provide the same at their end, the state officials have instead been putting the onus on the Centre – primarily the ministry of home affairs (MHA), ministry of external affairs (MEA) and ministry of youth affairs and sports (MYAS) – to issue the document for the smooth conduct of the tournament.Under the Foreigners (Protected Areas) Order, 1958, issued by MHA, all areas falling between the ‘Inner line’ and the International Border of the state have been declared as Protected Area, which include the whole of Arunachal. All foreigners visiting the state will have to first register themselves with the Foreigners Registration Officer (FRO) of the state within 24 hours of their arrival.After that, the foreigners – in this case the visiting teams – are required to obtain a PAP/RAP from a competent authority to enter or visit a ‘Protected/Restricted Area’ (for playing the SAFF tournament in Arunachal), without which they won’t be allowed to compete.","The SAFF U-19 football championship in Arunachal Pradesh is set to begin on May 9.

NEW DELHI: In a thrilling Champions League encounter on Tuesday, Davide Frattesi secured Inter Milan 's place in the final with a decisive extra-time goal , leading to a remarkable 4-3 victory over Barcelona , with an aggregate score of 7-6.The Italian midfielder Frattesi sealed the intense match at a rain-soaked San Siro in the 99th minute, following an impressive setup by Marcus Thuram, igniting jubilant celebrations amongst the capacity crowd.Inter will face either Arsenal or Paris Saint-Germain in Munich later this month, where they aim to secure their fourth European crown after emerging victorious from this extraordinary contest.Frattesi, who has established himself as a reliable substitute for Inter, replicated his late-scoring prowess from the first leg of their quarter-final victory against Bayern Munich.""It's just incredible, I don't know what to say. I thought after the Bayern game I couldn't ever feel the same emotions, but tonight was even more incredible,"" Frattesi told Sky Sport.""This has been my career, really.

But you have to play to win any final,"" stated Federico Dimarco.Barcelona must now focus on maintaining their four-point advantage over Real Madrid in La Liga following their missed opportunity for a clean sweep of trophies this season.""The truth is we are sad. We wanted to get to the final, we were having a great Champions League campaign,"" Ronald Araujo shared with Movistar.""We were very close and it got away from us.""Frattesi's winning strike, his seventh this season and arguably his most significant, was particularly notable given Inter's near elimination.With two minutes of regular time remaining, Inter faced elimination after Raphinha completed Barcelona's comeback from a two-goal deficit, establishing a 3-2 lead on the night.Francesco Acerbi stunned the stadium, particularly the celebrating Barcelona supporters, by converting Denzel Dumfries' cross in the second minute of additional time.This unexpected goal came when Barcelona had dominated the second half, having earlier trailed to Lautaro Martinez's brilliant finish and Hakan Calhanoglu's penalty just before halftime.Eric Garcia and Dani Olmo equalised for Barcelona in the 54th and 60th minutes, both from excellent Gerard Martin assists, requiring exceptional saves from Yann Sommer to keep Inter competitive.Sommer produced an outstanding save between Barcelona's first two goals, denying Eric Garcia from a rapid counter-attack.The Swiss goalkeeper proved crucial again in the 113th minute with another remarkable save from Lamine Yamal, who struck the post moments before Acerbi's equaliser.Inter successfully resisted Barcelona's pressure as the home supporters anxiously awaited the final whistle of this season's most compelling match.",Inter Milan beat Barcelona 4-3 on aggregate to reach Champions League final.

Solidarity Contribution

KOLKATA: The Indian Super League Shield and Cup winners Mohun Bagan Super Giant have been handed a surprise national ban on registration of new players because of a ‘technical glitch’ linked to the transfer of Australian striker Jason Cummings two years ago.The club said on Monday that it’s a minor issue which is expected to be resolved soon. Sources said that a FIFA rule in the international transfer system — called ‘solidarity contribution’ — has led to the ban for Jose Molina’s side.Bagan announced the signing of Cummings on a threeyear contract on June 28 in 2023. However, the FIFA Clearing House has flagged Bagan’s failure in clearing the SC linked to Cummings’ transfer.(SC) is a mechanism Fifa introduced with the international transfer system (ITS) following the Bosman ruling. When a Fifa-registered player makes an international transfer to another club in a different national association or country, a small percentage of the transfer fees (paid by the new club) is used as a form of compensation or solidarity fund and is given to the clubs and academies which have helped train and develop the player between ages 12 and 23 years.",Indian Super League Shield and Cup winners Mohun Bagan Super Giant have been handed a surprise national ban on registration of new players.

PANAJI: The All India Football Federation ( AIFF ) has approached Jamshedpur FC coach Khalid Jamil with an offer to prepare the under-23 team for next year’s Asian Games and the AFC U-23 Asian Cup , qualifiers for which will be held in Sept.The AIFF wants to start early with the preparations and has identified Jamil, contracted with Jamshedpur and adjudged AIFF Coach of the Year, as the best man for the job. Should Jamil take up the job, he will be allowed to coach club and country. “The AIFF has spoken to us as well as Khalid, but nothing has been decided,” Jamshedpur CEO Mukul Choudhari told TOI on Monday. “The decision has been left to Khalid. He has to decide. His stint with us has been outstanding.”According to sources, Jamil is yet to make up his mind. AIFF officials will need to convince India’s best coach of the under-23 national team assignment’s importance.Jamil has received rich praise from all quarters after taking Jamshedpur to the playoffs in the Indian Super League (ISL), with a frugal budget. Players too have improved under his tutelage.

He (Jamil) was champion with Aizawl in I-League. He played the ISL playoff with Northeast United. He played the playoff this season with Jamshedpur.

Nick Cassidy shares glimpses of his podium win and personal life



Nick Cassidy was a relieved man as he stood on the third spot on the podium at the Monaco E-Prix Round 7 on Sunday. The Jaguar TCS Racing driver confessed he was actually “jumping up and down” on the inside as he reached the podium for the first time this season. However, it is his third consecutive podium at the Monaco E-Prix, his home race. A day after the race, Cassidy made multiple attempts to at least share a post to mark his first Formula E win of the year before finally dropping a bunch of stunning pictures on his Instagram page.Nick Cassidy shared a picture of himself holding the trophy at the Monaco E-Prix Round 7 on Instagram on Monday, along with several stunning pictures of his family and more. He wrote, “Not on here much these days.. No other way around it - been a super tough start to the year and it’s great to have an awesome Podium in Monaco with @jaguarracing. 3 years in a row on the steps at home is super special. Thanks to all those in my corner.”Just before dropping the post, he took to his Instagram Stories to share a screenshot of his many attempts at making an Instagram post to assure his followers that he was trying to share at least one post on the special occasion.Nick had won the Monaco E-Prix once in 2023 when he was racing for Envision Racing and had taken the second podium spot in 2024 with Jaguar TCS Racing. Nick Cassidy picked his way through the field from 14th position on the grid to third spot on the podium in the Monaco E-Prix Round 7. He capitalised on a strong energy advantage built early on in the race to yield late progress as he neared the finish line and ended third.Sharing his first reaction after the race, Nick Cassidy said: “It feels very very sweet. I can’t fault my guys - it’s been an extremely tough start to the year, it’s no secret I’ve not been the happiest guy at times, but this one feels like a big monkey off the shoulders and I’m really proud of everyone’s efforts.

Oliver Rowland couldn’t translate his pole into victory in Monaco Round 7





There is no stopping Oliver Rowland , who had double gains at the recently held Monaco E-Prix double-header and is “really pleased” with his position in Round 7. The Nissan driver won Round 6 and had said, “Normally you’d be looking forward to the champagne, but you’ve already got one eye on tomorrow.” He did keep the champagne celebrations under control after his win in Monaco and yielded results with his podium finish the next day.Oliver Rowland had won the pole position and was confidently leading in the first half of the race, but as if the pole curse continues to be in place ever since 2022, he couldn’t manage to cross the finish line first. It was Envision Racing’s Sébastien Buemi who ended his more than six-year-long wait for a win by lifting the winner’s trophy on Day 2 of the Monaco E-Prix. Only António Félix da Costa had managed to translate his pole into a victory at the Formula E Monaco race in 2021.Sharing his take on the Monaco race, Rowland said, “I think honestly when he [Buemi] took his Attack Mode, he knew I had more to do — I think he was trying to back me into the pack, so when I took it, I lost quite a lot. But, first and second here doesn’t get much better, so I’m really, really pleased. We just need to keep pushing. We’ve got Tokyo next week where I was really strong last year, so hopefully we can have a real big push for that double-header and then keep pushing in the right direction.”Many believed Rowland was in his own race as he took a three-second lead in the first half. However, he lunged at the chicane on Lap 21, and it was Buemi who surpassed him at the right time. The Nissan driver's move was later judged over-exuberant by the stewards, forcing him to cede the position to Jean-Éric Vergne in recompense, but the damage cost the DS Penske driver a crack at the race win, as Mahindra Racing's Nyck de Vries and Buemi made it by as Vergne bogged down in avoiding action.Rowland once again gave up the lead to Vergne as he took his final mandatory 50kW, four-wheel drive Attack Mode activation, to use that overlap of extra power and traction to push past Vergne and de Vries on Laps 23 and 24 respectively, for second place at the flag, some four seconds back from Buemi.Also Read: Monaco E-Prix Round 6 winner Oliver Rowland delays celebrations for Round 7: “Normally you’d be looking forward to the champagne but…” Up next is the Tokyo double-header on May 17 and 18.

Poll How do you feel about Washington Sundar's return to the T20I squad? Excited Indifferent Concerned about his fitness Uncertain about his performance

In a positive development, Washington Sundar is all set to join India's T20I squad in Delhi ahead of the World Cup fixture vs Namibia on February 12. India captain Suryakumar Yadav revealed this after the win over USA in Mumbai, informing that the all-rounder is ""good. """"Washi (Washington Sundar) is joining us in Delhi. He's good. Everything is fine,"" said Surya at the post-match presentation.Sundar last played a competitive fixture nearly a month ago during the ODI series vs New Zealand. The all-rounder injured himself while bowling in the 1st ODI in Vadodara and went on to miss the remainder of the series, and the five T20Is which followed. As TimesofIndia.com had reported on January 28, the left-hander resumed batting at the BCCI Centre of Excellence and got his workload gradually increased in the coming days.The BCCI didn't mention the exact nature of his injury but TimesofIndia.com has learnt that it was a mild fracture in addition to the side strain which delayed the return to match fitness. He even consulted Dr Dinshaw Pardiwala before checking into the Bengaluru facility and the initial few days were more about pain management and allowing the injured area to heal. Even the first batting session, which lasted around 30 minutes, was done with some tenderness around the injured rib region.""Washington Sundar underwent scans after reporting an acute onset discomfort in his lower rib area while bowling during the first ODI against New Zealand at the BCA Stadium, Vadodara, on 11 January. This was followed by an in-person consultation with an expert. He has been diagnosed with a side strain and has been advised rest for a few days, following which he will report to the BCCI Centre of Excellence (COE) for further management of his injury,"" read a BCCI statement on January 16.On the reported lines, the Indian management played the waiting game and was in no rush to replace the all-rounder from the World Cup squad. His addition is unlikely to affect the Playing XI dynamics but gives the management an interesting match-up card up their sleeve.Bumrah missed the tournament opener due to illness and even opener Abhishek didn't take the field during the second innings of the fixture vs USA. The left-hander wasn't spotted in the dugout, forcing the Indian management to assign fielding coach T Dilip to drinks duties.Abhishek was nowhere to be seen even during the post-match handshakes, and Surya later confirmed that both are still under the weather.""Bumrah, he was having high fever due to because of weather, like how Abhishek was under the weather,"" said Surya.Mohammed Siraj, however, revealed the Abhishek has an upset stomach but assured his return in the next game vs Namibia.""Everything is fine. His stomach was a little upset, so he didn’t come out to field. He’ll be back in the next match and show his magic with the bat,"" said Siraj.","Washington Sundar set to join India's T20I squad in Delhi ahead of the World Cup fixture vs Namibia on February 12.

T20 World Cup: 'God changed my destiny' - Mohammed Siraj on emotions of lucky comeback

NEW DELHI: Fourteen-year-old Vaibhav Sooryavanshi summed up a historic night in simple, heartfelt words — grateful for the moment, proud of the contribution, and clear-eyed about the journey ahead. “Abhi bohot dur tak hai jaana,” the teenage sensation wrote after scripting one of the most extraordinary performances in Under-19 World Cup history.Sooryavanshi’s scintillating 175 off just 80 balls powered India to their record-extending sixth ICC Under-19 World Cup title as they crushed England by 100 runs in the final at Harare on Friday. His knock — a breathtaking blend of fearless strokeplay and maturity beyond his years — completely outshone a valiant century from England’s Caleb Falconer.After India opted to bat, Sooryavanshi produced a record-shattering masterclass, smashing 15 fours and 15 sixes to propel the side to a daunting 411/9.Skipper Ayush Mhatre chipped in with a composed 53, while Abhigyan Kundu’s brisk 40 ensured India never lost momentum. In response, England faltered after a promising start, sliding from 142/2 to 177/7.Falconer fought a lone battle with a powerful 115 off 67 balls, but the target proved far too steep as England’s wait for a second U-19 crown — stretching back to 1998 — continued.Later, the young batting prodigy from Samastipur, Bihar, took to Instagram, posting a photo with the trophy and reflecting on the moment. “Really enjoyed myself out there and happy that I could contribute to a win that will hold a special place in my heart forever,” he wrote, expressing gratitude for the overwhelming support.India’s dominant campaign drew praise from across the cricketing fraternity. Virat Kohli , who captained India to the U-19 title in 2008, hailed the team’s sustained excellence at the age-group level, while head coach Gautam Gambhir declared, “The bright future is here.”For Sooryavanshi, though, the message was clear — this was just the beginning.",India beat England by 100 runs to win ICC Under-19 World Cup in Harare.

T20 World Cup: 'God changed my destiny' - Mohammed Siraj on emotions of lucky comeback

NEW DELHI: The bond between Suryakumar Yadav and Rohit Sharma has long been cherished by Indian cricket fans, and a heartwarming moment ahead of India’s ICC Men’s T20 World Cup opener against the USA captured it perfectly. As Suryakumar walked out for the toss at the Wankhede Stadium, he spotted Rohit passing by, briefly stepped away and ran across to hug his former skipper. The gesture drew loud cheers from the crowd, with the video quickly going viral on social media.Moments later, Suryakumar led from the front in far tougher circumstances, producing a magnificent unbeaten 84 off 49 balls to rescue India from a dramatic collapse and guide them to a defendable 161 for 9.India were reeling at 77 for 6 in the 13th over after USA pacer Shadley van Schalkwyk ripped through the top and middle order with figures of 4 for 25, dismissing Ishan Kishan, Tilak Varma and Shivam Dube in a decisive burst.Suryakumar counter-attacked with authority, finding boundaries at will and ensuring India had something to bowl at.The bowlers then delivered a disciplined performance to secure a 29-run victory and start the campaign on a winning note. Mohammad Siraj , drafted into the XI after Jasprit Bumrah fell ill, rose to the occasion with a lion-hearted spell of 3 for 29. Arshdeep Singh (2/18) and Axar Patel (2/24) provided excellent support as the USA were restricted to 132 for 9 in their chase.Siraj struck early to remove openers Andries Gous and Saiteja Mukkamalla, while Arshdeep sent back skipper Monank Patel for a duck as the USA slipped to 13 for 3.Sanjay Krishnamurthi and Milind Kumar added some resistance, but regular breakthroughs kept India in control. Despite spirited knocks from Krishnamurthi, Milind Kumar and Shubham Ranjane, the USA fell short, handing India their second World Cup victory over them.",India beat USA by 29 runs in their T20 World Cup opener. Suryakumar Yadav scored 84 off 49 balls to guide India to a defendable 161 for 9.

Baartman like Mohammed Shami

Poll Do you think Ottneil Baartman deserved a spot in the T20 World Cup squad for South Africa? Yes, he is the highest wicket-taker in SA20. No, other players were more deserving.

South Africa's T20 World Cup preparations have been marred by injury-related concerns. Ryan Rickelton and Tristan Stubbs replaced Tony de Zorzi and Donovan Ferreira. David Miller missed the series against the West Indies, but has been deemed fit to play the 20-team competition co-hosted by India and Sri Lanka.But it is in the bowling department that there has been quite the kerfuffle. Ottneil Baartman was left out of the squad despite taking five wickets in the three matches against India in December, including a four-wicket haul.The decision to leave Baartman out became even more controversial when the bowler claimed he wasn't kept in the loop about the decision. This contrasts with Lhuan-dre Pretorius, who, although not in the squad, was notified by the selectors.The conflict developed further when Patrick Moroney, the convenor of selectors, stated he had called Baartman after he was left out of the squad. At the same time, he did shed light on the decision to leave Baartman out.""Unfortunately, in the make-up of a side, there's no space for (Lungi) Ngidi and Baartman. They bowl more or less the same kind of pace and have the same variations,"" Moroney told SportsBoom.""So, you had to pick a player, and Ottneil was made very aware in the conversation that we had on the 1st of January that he's part of the backup list and that he will be monitored.If the need arises, then we will push on his button if need be.""Despite having his leg heavily strapped in the latter stages of the SA20, Lungi Ngidi has made the trip. So has 19-year-old Kwena Maphaka despite taking just four wickets from eight matches in the recently concluded SA20.Baartman, on the other hand, finished as the leading wicket-taker in the SA20. The 32-year-old took 20 wickets from nine matches at an average of 13.55 and an economy of 9.13. He took a hat-trick during a five-wicket haul, the only fifer this season, against the Pretoria Capitals. Incidentally, Ngidi was the other hat-trick taker this season.The flurry of wickets in the fourth edition allowed him to become the highest wicket-taker in the SA20 history with 61 wickets to his name - just one ahead of Marco Jansen - at an average of 15.15 and economy of 8.32.The voices questioning the decision to leave Baartman out of the T20 World Cup squad found a familiar tone in the form of ex-South Africa seamer Dale Steyn.The Proteas legend, who worked with Baartman for three seasons as the bowling coach of the Sunrisers Eastern Cape, wrote on social media: ""He's the highest wicket taker in SA20, won the league twice and made a final, let me remind you, that's a comp [competition] that has 4 INTERNATIONAL players (often batters) plus all the PROTEAS! He's number 1,"" Steyn tweeted. ""Thats TOP quality, but he'll be sitting home for this years 20/20 WC. ""In a country where cricket is a rich person's sport and players get picked from elite private schools and academies, 32-year-old Baartman is an outlier. He was born in the Klein Karoo region, in the small town of Oudtshoorn, nicknamed the 'Ostrich capital of the world'.One of two children raised by a single mother, Baartman didn't have a father figure growing up. His mother Maria, provided for the family and ensured neither of the two kids slept on an empty stomach.“My mother was a mother and father. I never had a father figure. I met my father, but he was never around,” Baartman had said before.“To raise me with nothing, and for me to be here, means the world to me. If it weren't for her, I would not be here.“That's massive for me. Still with nothing, she makes it work. I can't help but get emotional, but to raise two kids the way she did was exceptional. The biggest thing for me for now is that I know I play for my family.”His first brush with cricket came at the local Bridgton Sports Ground, where his cousin Douglas played for the Union Stars Cricket Club. In the absence of a TV until his teens, this was Baartman's only tryst with the sport. Everything he picked up on the sidelines was then replicated back home, on the streets, with his buddies.The dream of playing for the Proteas meant he needed to get out of Oudtshoorn where top-level domestic cricket remained absent. Having played for the South-Western Districts and Northern Cape at the provincial level, he moved to the province of Free State, before a jump to KwaZulu-Natal with the much more fancied Dolphins.It took a decade of toiling in domestic cricket to be recognised and picked for the national side. In 2021, he was called up to the South Africa Test squad but wasn't included in the playing XI. The same year, he became the inaugural winner of the Makhaya Ntini Power of Cricket Award.The right-arm seamer finally got his due when he featured against the West Indies in May 2024. His ODI debut came not long after, versus Ireland in October. Despite featuring in the 2024 T20 World Cup, Baartman has played only 23 international matches, taking 30 wickets at an average of 23.2.Even though he largely remains on the sidelines for the Proteas, the 32-year-old has performed effectively in the SA20 and T20 franchise cricket. In the SA20 auction in 2025, Paarl Royals spent R5.1 million (Rs 51 lakh) on him. Elsewhere, he was linked with the Delhi Capitals in the IPL, Hampshire in England's T20 Blast, and came in as an injury replacement for the Texas Super Kings in USA's Major League Cricket (MLC).Now a father, his objective is the same as that of his mother - focusing on the family.""My daughter, my son, my wife are back home now. I'm assuming they're screaming back home now, but yeah, it means so much to my family,"" he said after the hat-trick and fifer this season.“I’ve hardly seen them for the last four months. Obviously, I was in Pakistan, and then I went from there to India, and then straight from there, it's SA20.“And then, probably from here, I go back to the domestic franchise team. So, probably to them (his family) because they sacrifice a lot. I don't see them often, but yeah, they support me so much from the sidelines.”Rather ironically, Baartman was part of South Africa's T20 World Cup squad run in 2024, rewarded for his 18-wicket showing in the second season of the SA20. Still uncapped when the squad was announced then, Baartman took five wickets in the tournament, including a four-wicket haul against the Netherlands. His shining moment came against Nepal when he successfully defended 7 runs in the final over.He's only played 11 of South 32 T20Is since then, taking 13 wickets in the process. Unlike Ngidi and co. who boast of slower ones and variety in their arsenal, Baartman relies on his ability to get the ball to skid through.In Indian conditions, a ball coming quicker, staying low, going underneath a batter's swinging arc would have made a world of difference.Steyn had compared Baartman early on to an Indian seamer, who also fails to get his dues despite going about his job effectively in domestic cricket.""He reminds me a lot of Mohammed Shami where his seam comes down, he’s got a great wrist and his lines are perfectly straight, so very rarely does he bowl a short wide-cut ball, or a ball which goes down leg. Something similar to Anriche Nortje, his lines are gun barrel straight and his seam is really good. He comes with little problems, he’s easy to coach and it’s easy for him to kind of zone in on a particular area which is important when you’re playing at the highest level,"" said the legendary bowler.All this, unfortunately, counts for nothing as South Africa go into the T20 World Cup with their best white-ball bowler sitting at home.",South Africa's T20 World Cup preparations have been marred by injury-related concerns. Ryan Rickelton and Tristan Stubbs replaced Tony de Zorzi and Donovan Ferreira. Baartman was left out of the squad despite taking five wickets in the three matches against India.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128057230,imgsize-110662,width-400,resizemode-4/ind-vs-sa-2nd-t20i-match.jpg"

T20 World Cup | 'Our flight is booked and we are going' - Suryakumar Yadav on Pakistan's boycott

India wicketkeeper-batter Rishabh Pant has singled out Abhishek Sharma as the most dangerous batter in world cricket right now, citing the youngster’s consistency and fearless approach at the top of the order.Speaking on India Today’s Salaam Cricket, Pant said Abhishek ’s current run of form is no coincidence, stressing that sustained success at the highest level can only come from a solid process backed by belief.“Going by current form, it is Abhishek Sharma. He is so consistent. Even in the IPL, he has maintained his peak, which means his process works and he is backing it with belief. Every day cannot be tukka,” Pant said.Pant, himself known for his aggressive style, pointed out that performing at a high level across multiple IPL seasons is a strong indicator of a batter’s quality and mental strength.Abhishek is set to feature in his maiden T20 World Cup and goes into the tournament as one of the most prolific batters in the format. Since making his international debut in mid-2024, the left-hander has been in red-hot form, scoring close to 1,300 runs from 38 matches at a remarkable strike rate of 195.Pant also reflected on the influence Rahul Dravid has had on his career, revealing that the former India head coach’s advice continues to shape his mindset.“I think the key is not thinking about it too much and not dwelling on it. There’s one really good line I learnt from Rahul (Dravid) bhai. He always told me one thing: ‘Rishabh, no matter what happens, try to be the same person when you score a hundred and when you score a zero,’” Pant said.The wicketkeeper-batter admitted that maintaining emotional balance remains one of the toughest challenges for any athlete.“I think, as an athlete, that’s the hardest thing to do — to remain who you are. Emotions sometimes get the better of you, but that line always stays with me. So personally, I try that. Whether I score zero or a hundred, I want to be the same guy. Maybe when I get out, it hurts more. I don’t enjoy scoring runs as much as I feel the pain of getting out,” Pant concluded.","India wicketkeeper-batter Rishabh Pant has singled out Abhishek Sharma as the most dangerous batter in world cricket right now.

T20 World Cup | 'Our flight is booked and we are going' - Suryakumar Yadav on Pakistan's boycott

England Test captain Ben Stokes has revealed the extent of a nasty facial injury after being struck flush on the face by a cricket ball during a training session. The all-rounder shared an image on Instagram showing a badly bruised and swollen right eye, a cut on his cheek and lip, and a bandage packed into his nose.Despite the severity of the blow, Stokes took the incident in good humour, captioning the post: “You should see the state of the cricket ball,” accompanied by a laughing emoji.Stokes is currently not part of England’s white-ball plans and will miss the upcoming T20 World Cup. He is expected to make his return during England’s Test series against New Zealand in June.The incident comes in the aftermath of a difficult Ashes campaign for England, which ended in a heavy 4-1 defeat in Australia. Expectations had been high ahead of the tour, with England aiming to win the Ashes Down Under for the first time since 2010–11. However, defeats in the first three Tests meant Australia retained the urn within 11 days. England managed a consolation win in the Boxing Day Test at the MCG before losing the series finale in Sydney.Stokes himself endured a tough series with the bat, averaging just 18.40 across 10 innings. He was more effective with the ball, finishing with 15 wickets at an average of 25.13.His leadership also came under scrutiny. Fast bowling legend James Anderson questioned Stokes’ public praise of his players following the defeat, expressing surprise at the tone of the captain’s comments.“When I saw Stokes come out and say, the way (Josh) Tongue and (Brydon) Carse have just run in like consistently, I had a Roy Keane moment,” Anderson said on BBC Radio. “I was like, that’s your job. If you’re not willing to run in all day for your team, don’t bother. You’re in the wrong sport.”Stokes defended his side after the fifth Test, insisting effort and commitment were not the issue.“We’ve dropped a lot of catches on this tour which have been very costly to the overall situation of the games. In terms up of stepping up, I can never fault anyone’s commitment or energy that they’ve given into this. We haven’t performed well, we know that, we hold our hands up to that. But no one should question the care and commitment to try and go out there and give it your absolute best. It’s just been down to the lack of execution,” he said.Stokes later admitted he had made significant mistakes as captain during the series. England’s tour was also marred by off-field controversy, with a mid-series trip to Noosa drawing attention amid reports of a drinking culture within the camp.As Stokes recovers from his facial injury, the focus now shifts to his return in the longest format, where England will hope for a reset after a bruising Ashes campaign, both on and off the field.Also Visit: England Under-19 vs India Under-19 Final: Match Details, Teams, Date and Venue","England Test captain Ben Stokes reveals extent of a facial injury.

Poll Do you support Sri Lanka Cricket's plea for Pakistan to reconsider the boycott of the India-Pakistan T20 World Cup match? Yes, I support the plea No, I do not support Unsure

Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) wrote a letter to the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) on Thursday, urging it to reconsider its decision to boycott the India vs Pakistan fixture at the T20 World Cup 2026, scheduled for February 15 at the R. Premadasa International Cricket Stadium in Colombo.TimesofIndia.com is in possession of the two-page letter written by SLC, in which it reminded the PCB of Sri Lanka’s past support to Pakistan during challenging times and urged the board to reconsider its stance. The letter also highlights significant financial, logistical and reputational consequences for the co-hosts if the game does not go ahead as planned.“We wish to place on record that Sri Lanka is highly anticipating the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2026, particularly in its capacity as a host venue for matches assigned to Sri Lanka. All commercial, operational, logistical and security-related arrangements in respect of these matches have already been finalised. This includes, inter alia, hospitality planning and the sale of match tickets,” the letter read.“It is pertinent to note that ticket sales for the matches scheduled to be hosted in Sri Lanka, in particular the India versus Pakistan fixture, have already been finalised and have recorded exceptionally strong demand, with tickets being sold fast, reflecting unprecedented public interest and significant commercial expectations for Sri Lanka Cricket.Any non-participation in a scheduled marquee fixture of this nature would therefore have wide-ranging implications, including substantial financial exposure for SLC and the potential loss of anticipated tourism inflows and broader economic benefits arising from heightened international interest in the tournament. ”The board pointed out that tickets for matches in Sri Lanka, especially the India–Pakistan fixture, have been sold amid exceptional demand, underscoring unprecedented public interest and significant commercial expectations.SLC cautioned that non-participation in a marquee fixture of this scale would have far-reaching consequences, exposing the board to major financial losses while also impacting tourism inflows and the broader economy.“The Government of Sri Lanka is attentive to the potential impact of a boycott, given the significant economic benefits expected from hosting these matches. Any change to the scheduled fixtures would therefore affect not only Sri Lanka Cricket but also the wider range of stakeholders involved in ensuring the successful conduct of the tournament.""Six Sri Lankan players were wounded in March 2009 when gunmen opened fire on their team bus as it was driving to Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore for a Test match.The incident led to international teams staying away from Pakistan for nearly a decade. That streak was broken when Sri Lanka became the first to play a Test match in Pakistan after a 10-year gap (in 2019).“In this context, we respectfully recall that Sri Lanka Cricket and the Sri Lanka National Team have, on several occasions, toured Pakistan and participated in international fixtures notwithstanding exceptionally challenging and sensitive circumstances, including serious security-related incidents. These have included, inter alia, the attack on the national team convoy, as a result of which certain Sri Lankan players and officials sustained injuries, some of whom continue to carry physical impacts from those injuries to date, while others were left with profound and lasting psychological trauma. In more recent instances, further security incidents, including bombings in the region, placed additional emotional and professional strain on team members, with some compelled to contemplate withdrawal from ongoing engagements,” SLC said in the letter.Newswire, a Sri Lankan media outlet, has reported that Sri Lanka’s tourism and hospitality sector has already felt the impact of Pakistan’s reported decision to skip the February 15 match in Colombo, with widespread hotel booking cancellations across several Colombo-based properties.“Notwithstanding the gravity of these circumstances, Sri Lanka Cricket, in close coordination with the Government of Sri Lanka, remained steadfast in its support of Pakistan and the Pakistan Cricket Board, and continued to honour its commitments to international cricket in the broader interests of the game and international solidarity, at times when several other cricketing nations were hesitant or unwilling to tour Pakistan,” the letter read.“In light of this longstanding support and cooperation, SLC respectfully expects the same spirit of reciprocity and mutual respect to prevail, particularly where the matches in question are scheduled to be played in Sri Lanka, a country that has extended every assurance with regard to security, neutrality and professionalism.“In view of the foregoing, and if any decision has indeed been taken to boycott or abstain from participating in the India vs Pakistan match scheduled for February 15, 2026, we respectfully and earnestly request the PCB to reconsider such a decision.

NEW DELHI: Royal Challengers Bengaluru captain Smriti Mandhana summed up a historic night with a familiar chant — “Ee sala cup namdu” — after guiding her side to a second Women’s Premier League title and completing what she called an “amazing” run of success for the franchise across formats.RCB women had broken the title drought with a landmark triumph in 2024 before the men lifted the IPL trophy last year. Now, Mandhana’s side sealed another chapter in the franchise’s resurgence by defeating Delhi Capitals by six wickets in the WPL final, chasing down a daunting 204.“Very pleased. RCB fans are the best in the world, wherever we play we get a lot of support. Three titles in three years for the franchise — it is amazing,” Mandhana said after the win, dedicating the moment to the loyal fan base. “This one’s for you guys… Ee sala cup namdu 2!”Despite conceding 203 in the summit clash, Mandhana revealed the dressing room remained calm. “We definitely thought it was a good surface to bat on. Of course, 200-plus in a final is a good score, but the way we bowled in the last four overs helped,” she said, singling out Lauren Bell’s economical spell as the match-winning moment.Mandhana also credited Georgia Voll’s aggressive intent at the top for setting the tone in the chase. “Volly led the way… I had a feeling 10–15 days back that she would play a match-winning knock in the final.She has been working extremely hard and I’m happy it paid off,” she added.A key theme throughout Mandhana’s remarks was the role clarity provided by the support staff. “Right from the auction, everyone knew what was expected — the batting order, the phases to bowl. That makes our job easier,” she said, praising head coach Malolan Rangarajan and the management group.She highlighted the team’s collective work ethic as the driving force behind their belief. “When girls are putting in hard yards in the gym and training, you feel you can chase any score,” she noted.While Delhi Capitals suffered a fourth straight final defeat, skipper Jemimah Rodrigues praised her team’s fight, saying, “Could not be more proud of this group… everyone gave their best.”",Royal Challengers Bengaluru win second Women's Premier League title.

Poll What do you think was the key factor in RCB's WPL title win? Smriti Mandhana's performance Teamwork and synergy Effective coaching Support from fans

NEW DELHI: Royal Challengers Bengaluru sealed a historic second Women’s Premier League title with a stunning win over Delhi Capitals in Vadodara on Thursday, but for spinner Shreyanka Patil, the triumph meant something far more personal — a tribute to skipper Smriti Mandhana , who delivered a match-winning performance after navigating a turbulent phase in her personal life.Mandhana, who recently faced turmoil after her wedding was called off, responded in the most emphatic way possible — smashing 87 in the final, the highest individual score in a WPL title clash. Her knock, alongside Georgia Voll’s 79, powered RCB to a record-breaking chase of 204, sealing the trophy in dramatic fashion.After the victory, Patil dedicated the title to her captain, underlining the emotional weight behind the win. “Would love to mention three people — number one, Smriti, because she has gone through a lot in the last couple of months. Would love to dedicate this win to her. Malo and Anya… Today is Anya’s son’s first birthday. And again, Malo — first time he’s the head coach and it’s a special win for all of us,” she said.Calling it a “very special” season after her comeback, Patil thanked fans for backing the team despite the daunting 200-plus target.She finished the 2026 campaign with 11 wickets in nine innings, playing a crucial role in RCB’s title run.Mandhana’s heroic innings not only anchored the highest successful chase in a WPL final but also reinforced her status as one of the league’s biggest match-winners. Delhi Capitals, meanwhile, were left searching for answers after ending their fourth straight season without a trophy.All-rounder Radha Yadav praised the management’s backing and the team’s situational training sessions, saying the hard work behind the scenes played a big role in the title run.For RCB, however, the night belonged to Mandhana — a captain who turned personal adversity into championship glory.","Royal Challengers Bengaluru sealed a historic second Women’s Premier League title with a stunning win over Delhi Capitals in Vadodara.

Suryakumar Yadav press conference: on the India vs Pakistan clash, T20I world cup preps & Washington Sundar injury

85.71% - Rohit’s success percentage in T20 World Cups, the best among captains who have led in 10+ matches.

2 - Rohit is one of only two players to have appeared in the first nine editions of the T20 World Cup between 2007 and 2024, the other being Bangladesh’s Shakib Al Hasan. Rohit also has the most appearances in the T20 WC (47) followed by Shakib’s 43 matches.

1 - Rohit is the only cricketer to win the T20 World Cup both as player (2007) and captain (2024).

9 - Series won by India, including the last 8 in a row, out of 10 T20I series played under Suryakumar Yadav since Nov 2023. The two-match series vs South Africa in South Africa in Dec 2023 ended in a draw.

165.48 - Suryakumar’s strike rate is the highest among batters with 3000+ runs in T20Is.

MUMBAI: When Team India lines up for the National Anthem at the Wankhede Stadium prior to their T20 World Cup opener against USA on Saturday, they will be watching former captain Rohit Sharma place the coveted trophy — which he lifted on June 29, 2024 in Barbados — on the podium. Rohit is the tournament ambassador for this edition of the World Cup.While his selfless explosiveness as opener is being probably matched by another Sharma, in Abhishek, one wonders whether Rohit, who has been part of every T20 World Cup since 2007, will be missed more as a leader. Of course, under Suryakumar Yadav too, India have built up a stellar record in the shortest format.In a pressure-soaked environment of a home World Cup though, Rohit, who often was the zen architect with excellent man-management skills, coupled with tactical empathy for his bowlers and clutch composure, will probably be on SKY’s speed dial during the course of the event.Former India pacer and bowling coach Paras Mhambrey , who combined superbly with head coach Rahul Dravid and skipper Rohit Sharma for three ICC events (2022 T20 WC, 2023 ODI WC and 2024 T20 WC), feels the current regime’s pragmatic approach is based on the reality that Rohit is not with the squad. “The question of missing him does not arise.”Mhambrey, though, hails the impact of Rohit the captain, especially when India ended an 11-year ICC trophy drought in the USA and West Indies.He also endorsed Jasprit Bumrah’s views of Rohit as a “bowler’s captain”, who allows the bowlers to set fields and steps in only when their plans do not work. Paras explains the reasons why he became such a bowler’s captain, despite being such a destructive and classy opening batter who prioritised impact over milestones.“He was completely involved during bowlers’ meetings. When you’re the captain and are playing a World Cup, there’s so many other things happening. Yet, he gave so much of his time to the bowlers and to us as coaches. He was there for discussions. That gave us great communication on the field, knowing the captain was very clear with plans. The bowlers were locked in on them too. If things didn’t work out, he h a d o p t i o n s ready. And what really makes great captains is instincts to read situations and rely on an option which is contrary to the popular one.”That perhaps explains the way he rotated his resources in two high-stakes encounters in the 2024 T20 WC. In the defence of 119 in the league phase vs Pakistan in New York, he kept holding Bumrah back rather than use him up in desperate search of wickets on a pitch that had begun to ease out. Conversely, in the final, when South Africa needed 30 off 30 balls with six wickets left in Barbados, he used Bumrah in the 16th and 18th over, rather than waiting for him to bowl the 18th and 20th.Paras feels the bowlers and the team look for calmness in the leader when things are not going well, and that is something which Rohit gave them. “Rohit is not very expressive and exudes a calm body language. That dilutes pressure and stops it from getting transferred to the bowler. In that game vs Pakistan, despite him wanting the bowlers to defend 120 and look for wickets, he never looked desperate.”Apart from prioritising high batting tempo in the powerplay, the Rohit-Rahul Dravid era will also go down in history probably as India’s most data-driven think-tank. Paras conforms to that view and highlights how Rohit often called Hari Prasad Mohan, the analyst, late at night before games during the WC, saying he needed data on some player.“Another fab guy, Hari, who worked very hard behind the scenes. During conversations, he used to often tell me and Rahul: ‘Rohit called me late at night, wanting a particular bit of data.’ Just shows how much Rohit was thinking all the time,” Paras stresses.The challenge, though, in team environments is often making people see your point of view or buy into what plans you have. Data, something which Rohit was heavily invested in, was one aspect. How did he make others accept the fact that data is important and filter it in a way that did not complicate things? “I don’t think anyone told him that they weren’t comfortable with data,” reveals Paras, and adds that he had the gift of filtering information in a way that the bowlers felt comfortable using. “Maybe, individual X wanted to know four points. Someone else wanted to know only two, depending on what stage of the game he was bowling and to whom. He addressed both quite well.”While SKY has imbibed most things from Rohit’s captaincy style, Paras feels it would be wrong to compare individuals. “When you entrust a captain with responsibility, you got to allow him to function the way he wants. Not every game will run the way you want it to run, but as long as you are consistent with your thought processes, things should be fine.”—Stats: Rajesh Kumar",Rohit Sharma is the only cricketer to win the T20 World Cup both as player (2007) and captain (2024) Rohit is one of only two players to have appeared in the first nine editions of the T 20 World Cup between 2007 and 2024.

T20 World Cup: 'God changed my destiny' - Mohammed Siraj on emotions of lucky comeback

MUMBAI: Perhaps this is exactly why the decision-makers in Indian cricket kept patience and never lost belief in the ability of India’s T20 captain Suryakumar Yadav , even as he went through a terrible slump that saw him end up without even a half-century in 2025.Leading from the front and by example on a Saturday night on which India’s ‘six-hitting machine’ malfunctioned badly against a spirited USA in their opening match of the 2026 T20 World Cup at the Wankhede Stadium, ‘SKY’ rescued his team when it was tottering at 77 for six in the 13th over, with a scintillating knock-a dazzling 84 not out off just 49 balls. Playing the role of a one-man army, the Indian captain took his team to 161 for nine, a total which seemed far from possible at one stage when India were in a freefall, thanks to a brilliant spell by South Africa-born medium-pacer Shadley van Schalkwyk, who took four of 25 in four overs.After taking his time to get his eye in on a two-paced pitch where strokemaking seemed tricky, the Mumbaikar, refusing to be rattled by India’s rapid fall of wickets, charmed a packed home crowd with some typically breathtaking ‘360 degree’ strokeplay to reach his half-century off 36 balls. Like South African legend AB de Villiers, the 35-year-old uses all the angles of the ground to pull off some audacious strokes-many of them behind the wicket.USA had an opportunity to get rid of Suryakumar when he was on just 15, but Shubham Ranjane grassed a chance off his own bowling that Surya offered in the 10th over- a missed opportunity that may well cost them the match. Two years back, Surya had stroked a 49-ball 50 to help India overcome USA’s low total on a difficult pitch, and on this occasion, he again proved to be a thorn in USA’s flesh.Pouncing on Saurabh Netravalkar in the final over of the innings, which went for 21 runs, Surya smashed the ex-Mumbai left-arm pacer for back-to-back sixes and a four-two out of those shots were scoops/laps which came even as he lost his balance and fell while pulling them off. Left nervous by the assault, Netravalkar delivered a full toss which was promptly dispatched to the stands behind long off. In the 2024 T20 World Cup, Netravalkar had taken two for 18 in four overs to deliver a fine spell against India at New York. At Mumbai, bullied by SKY, he ended up conceding 65 -the highest by any bowler in an innings in a T20 World Cup match, beating Sanath Jayasuriya's 64 way back in 2007.Hampered severely by the injuries to pacer Ali Khan (1-13) and allrounder Ranjane (0-16 in two overs), USA were forced to ask the off-colour Netravalkar to complete his quota of overs, and with Surya, batting in a belligerent mood, feasted on the software engineer with aplomb.India were staring at the barrel when Hardik Pandya (5), playing a poor shot, holed out to sweeper cover off a turning delivery from former Mumbai left-arm spinner Harmeet Singh, who, capitalising on the grip on the surface, bowled superbly on his ‘home ground,’ taking two for 26 in four overs. However, refusing to give up, Surya added 41 in just 24 balls for the seventh wicket with Axar Patel (14, 11b, 2x4) to help India rally from the crisis. After Axar was gone, he only had tail for company, but taking charge of the situation with just the tailenders left, Surya then put on 22 in 14 balls for the eight wicket Arshdeep Singh and 21 in six balls with Varun Chakravarthy for the ninth.In a collapse which must worry them, India looked down in the dumps, getting off to the worst-possible start when Abhishek Sharma was out for a ‘golden duck’ on his T20 World Cup debut, hitting Ali Khan to Sanjay Krishmamurthi at deep extra cover in the second over. Putting on 37 in 24 balls for the second wicket, Ishan Kishan (20, 16b, 1x4, 2x4) and Tilak Varma (25, 16b, 3x4, 1x6) seemed to be going well, before van Schalkwyk struck thrice in the sixth over, sending off the duo and Shivam Dube for a golden duck-all the three batters perishing to poor shots off gentle medium-pace.India’s woes increased and many thought an upset was on the cards when Rinku Singh (6) mistimed a shot off leggie Mohammed Mohsin, who bowled impressively to finish with 1-16 in four overs, and Pandya was gone too. However, on a night during which he seemed unstoppable, ‘Captain Surya’ was enough to take India’s ship to safe waters, even as the deck was half-burnt.Earlier, India suffered a blow even before USA asked them to bat first, when their premier pacer Jasprit Bumrah was forced to sit out of the opener unavailable due to illness.",Suryakumar Yadav scores 84 not out as India beat USA in 2026 T20 World Cup. India were bowled out for 161 by USA at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai. Surya hit back-to-back sixes in the final over of the innings for 21 runs.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128058266,imgsize-50654,width-400,resizemode-4/surya-usa2_0802-s.jpg"

Highest score in debut innings as captain (T20 WC)

India’s opening night of the T20 World Cup had both chaos and class, and two standout numbers from the match told the story better than anything else.Saurabh Netravalkar finished with figures of 0 for 65, the most expensive spell ever recorded in T20 World Cup history. It surpassed Sanath Jayasuriya’s 0 for 64 against Pakistan in Johannesburg back in 2007. The numbers were harsh, but they also reflected the damage done at the death by an Indian captain who refused to let his team sink. Suryakumar Yadav ’s unbeaten 84 off 49 balls was more than just a rescue act. It also placed him second on the list of highest scores in a debut innings as captain in T20 World Cups. Only Chris Gayle ’s iconic 88 against Australia in 2009 stands above it.88 Chris Gayle vs Aus The Oval 200984*Suryakumar Yadav vs USA Wankhede 202668*Babar Azam vs Ind Dubai 202165 Mahela Jayawardene vs Ken Joburg 200761 Mohd Ashraful vs WO Joburg 2007India’s innings began on a nervous note after USA captain Monank Patel won the toss and chose to bowl. Abhishek Sharma fell for a duck off the very first ball he faced, setting the tone for a difficult powerplay.The pressure only intensified as wickets kept tumbling. Tilak Varma and Ishan Kishan departed in quick succession, and Shadley van Schalkwyk ripped through the middle order.Although Suryakumar walked in earlier at number four, the situation worsened rapidly around him. India slid to 77 for 6, with Hardik Pandya and Rinku Singh both caught in the deep. The Wankhede crowd, stunned into silence, watched their defending champions teeter on the brink.From that point on, Suryakumar took complete control. He paced the innings with remarkable calm, shepherded the tail, and then shifted gears decisively. The counterattack began in the 16th over when he exploded against Saurabh Netravalkar, hammering three fours and a towering six to swing momentum India’s way. His fifty came off 36 balls, and he was far from done. The final over summed up his authority, as Suryakumar smashed 21 runs off Netravalkar, including two more sixes, dragging India past the 160 mark and giving their bowlers something to work with.Van Schalkwyk finished with an impressive 4 for 25, but the night ultimately belonged to India’s captain.

T20 World Cup | 'Sense of peace' - Faheem Ashraf on heroics for Pakistan vs Netherlands

The Netherlands were left distraught after a heartbreaking defeat against Pakistan in their T20 World Cup opener, with right-arm pacer Paul van Meekeren saying the match slipped away due to poor execution in the final overs rather than Pakistan outplaying them.Chasing 148, Pakistan were 90 for 2 at the halfway mark but then lost wickets quickly to slip to 114 for 7 in 16.1 overs, still needing 34 runs. At that point, Pakistan appeared close to defeat.However, Faheem Ashraf, who came in at No. 8 and was dropped on 7, changed the game. He scored an unbeaten 29 off 11 balls. Pakistan needed 29 from the final two overs when Ashraf hit three sixes and a four off Logan van Beek, before finishing the chase with a four in the last over. Pakistan reached 148 for 7 in 19.3 overs. Max O’Dowd dropped Ashraf on seven off the second ball of the 19th over.""I mean, I want to be very clear. Pakistan didn't win the game today. We lost the game against ourselves,"" van Meekeren said at the post-match press conference.""…we just probably didn't execute the way we wanted to. Yeah, you know, these World Cup moments, it's small margins, sometimes one ball. But yeah, it's just a very disappointed feeling at the moment.""Also read: How Pakistan's T20 World Cup nearly ended on day one Van Meekeren said the Netherlands were a few runs short of a winning total but praised the team’s effort.""I'm very proud of the guys. I think we probably didn't get the runs on the board that we wanted, but to fight back after a strong start from Pakistan with the bat that shows how the culture that we've created in the team and they never give up.""We weren't a better team today, especially in the bowling department. And we should have deserved to win the game. And there were moments. There was moments in the back. You got yourself to about 123 for 4 after 15 overs.""He still credited Pakistan for staying calm and seeing the match through.""I think the one thing I have to give Pakistan credit for is taking the game deep. I mean, we should have probably done it with the bat. Maybe taking the innings a little bit deeper,"" he said.""Because you can see what you can do if you've got a batsman who's in the last two overs and be able to take a bit more risk. But I think the conditions were very nice for us to ball to. And I mean, there was a lot of pressure on Pakistan in those last few overs.""Van Meekeren said the Netherlands would move on and focus on their next match against Namibia.""So obviously, there are a few guys who are actually disappointed in the change room. But we stand behind them. We back them all the way for the next game to turn it around.""They don't even need to turn it around, just to be the best they can be and win the next game for us against Namibia,"" he said.He identified the dropped catch of Ashraf as the key moment.""Probably the last real recognised batter, that's it. First ball goes for six and he (Max O’Dowd) dropped the catch. And then after that, it's six, six, four, something like that.""""We lost against ourselves. We deserved to win that game.

India T20 World Cup squad: In search of ideal combination, Agarkar & Co. drop Shubman Gill

‘Playing cricket in Afghanistan will be bigger than WC’

CHENNAI: Rashid Khan caught many by surprise at the pre-match press conference on Saturday ahead of their opening game against New Zealand, casually dropping a couple of Tamil words in the middle of his responses. That charming effort to adapt to the local language is akin to the wizardry he produces with his variations on the field, across venues.The Afghanistan skipper, the world’s finest T20 wrist-spinner, is just four wickets away from becoming the first bowler ever to reach 700 in T20 cricket. “Feeling nalla (good). I’ve only played 9–10 years of international cricket overall, and to be the leading wicket-taker is more than a dream for me. But I never counted my wickets. I only knew about it through the media. 700 wickets is not something small. To get there, it takes a lot of time and hard work. But I’m blessed, and I’m so happy to be reaching this milestone,” a cheerful Rashid said.Even as Rashid chases a milestone, he knows competition from Afghanistan’s next generation, the very players who once idolised him, is pushing him to work even harder. The country’s Under-19 team went down in the semifinals of the recent ODI World Cup.Speaking about the new crop, especially spinners coming up, he said: “Pretty much happy. If I’m not playing tomorrow or if I’m not there, we have the back-ups, and we have the options where they can come in with the good skills and do well for the team. We have a number of players who did well in the Under-19 level. And it made us push ourselves a lot and makes us work very hard.“If we don’t take things seriously, they are the ones who are going to step in. If you are not performing, a youngster will have more hunger than you and will have more commitment than you, so you have to step back and give him an opportunity. That’s why we have to keep pushing ourselves.”After achieving so much on the international stage, Rashid’s dream remains unfulfilled. He is yearning to see international cricket played on Afghan soil.“That’s bigger than the World Cup, to be honest. For me, for the team, and for every individual, that’s something more than a dream...To be playing international cricket in your own country. When you play IPL here, when you play an international game, you see how much their international stars are supported by the local fans, and how much love they get. I’m not saying we don’t get love here, but when you play in your own country, it’s a completely different feeling. The world will see Afghanistan as well, and how beautiful it is. But hopefully, hopefully one day, we make that possible,” said Rashid.","Rashid Khan is just four wickets away from becoming the first bowler ever to reach 700 in T20 cricket.

Trial by spin for New Zealand against Afghans,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/icc-mens-t20-world-cup/trial-by-spin-for-new-zealand-against-afghans/articleshow/128044783.cms,"CHENNAI: The MA Chidambaram Stadium here has undergone a makeover with the outfield completely dug up and relaid. The pitches, however, remain untouched, and Chepauk has not hosted a competitive game since IPL 2025 in April.With no recent competitive action to offer clear cues, it adds spice to the opening Group D clash of the T20 World Cup between New Zealand and Afghanistan on a Sunday morning. Group D also features South Africa, and with only two teams qualifying for the Super-8s, it is being dubbed as the Group of Death for a reason.The 11am start eliminates any dew factor and further favours the spinners on a venue traditionally known for assisting turn. Afghanistan will pin their hopes on the familiar spin quartet of skipper Rashid Khan , Noor Ahmad, mystery spinner Mujeeb Ur Rahman and seasoned Mohammad Nabi to turn the screws on a solid NZ batting unit.No one in the Afghan line-up knows Chepauk better than Noor, the crafty chinaman who has enjoyed considerable success at this venue during his IPL stint with Chennai Super Kings. They also have offie Darwish Rasooli and left-arm spinner Shahidullah Kamal in their ranks.That depth of spin is something captain Rashid Khan is well aware of, though he is quick to stress execution over reputation. “Yes, we do have good spinners, but we still have to bowl well and hit the right areas.They have a strong batting line-up, and the pitch looks good to bat on. But we have to use that knowledge and experience of playing IPL and bowl our best,” Rashid said on the eve of the match.His caution is well placed. While Rashid & Co. hold the spin edge, the Kiwis, led by Mitchell Santner , arrive with their own firepower at the top despite a chastening 1-4 series defeat to co-hosts India ahead of the World Cup. Their three-week stint in India for the series was disrupted by injuries and unavailability. But those concerns have since eased.“I think we do have all 15, which is nice, because at one stage we thought we were going to field nine in that warm-up game. So yes, I think we’re ready to go, which is good,” the skipper said.The return of explosive opener Finn Allen bolsters their line-up significantly; he has the ability to tackle spin even in tough chases. Paired with wicketkeeper-batter Tim Seifert, the opening duo could prove lethal in the powerplay against Afghanistan. They also have proven match-winners in Glenn Phillips, Daryl Mitchell, Michael Bracewell and Jimmy Neesham. Their pace-heavy bowling unit adds solid balance to the attack.That said, Santner feels the ‘Chepauk pitch has changed over time’. “Chepauk has changed a little over time. In the last couple of years, it’s (the pitch) been nice and flat, especially during the IPL. For us, it’s about seeing what it looks like tomorrow,” Santner said.","The MA Chidambaram Stadium here has undergone a makeover with the outfield completely dug up and relaid.

T20 World Cup Groups Explained: Who Can Reach the Super 8

NEW DELHI: India kicked off their T20 World Cup campaign with a win over the USA, but captain Suryakumar Yadav admitted the team had to dig deep after a shaky start.India posted 161/9, thanks largely to SKY’s unbeaten 84 off 49 balls after the top and middle order collapsed. The USA then managed 132/8 in reply, as India’s bowlers kept things under control.After the match, Suryakumar was honest about India’s batting struggles. He said, ""Only I can tell at the position we were in at 77/6, how much pressure we were in… We could've batted a little better.""He also spoke about the conditions, noting the pitch and morning light were unusual, but stressed that the team should not make excuses.""It was a little different wicket from what it is always at Wankhede. But at the same time, we knew when we woke up in the morning, we saw outside there wasn't a lot of sun outside,"" he added.Surya, who got the Man of the Match award for his exceptional knock, explained how he approached his innings when India were in trouble, adding, ""I always felt that there was a need for a batter to bat till the end. I never felt that it was a 180-190 wicket. I felt it was a 140 wicket.""He revealed that coach Gautam Gambhir also advised him to stay till the end and back himself.""Gauti bhai told me the same thing during the break after the 14 overs. He told me, just try and bat till the end, you can cover it any time,"" he continued.Drawing on his experience of playing in Mumbai maidans, he focused on timing his shots and managing the innings under pressure.He also reflected on his personal journey, saying, ""I knew definitely someday it was going to come… I was trying to bat in such a way, hold the innings for the team, but it wasn't happening.""India’s bowlers then stepped up. Mohammed Siraj, Arshdeep Singh and Axar Patel shared key wickets to keep the USA chase in check. Though Milind Kumar, Shubham Ranjane and Suraj Krishnamurthi fought back with useful knocks, they could not match India’s experience in crunch moments.Earlier, India were rocked at 77/6 after Shadley van Schalkwyk ripped through the batting with four wickets, including a triple strike in one over.But Suryakumar’s calm and aggressive knock rescued India and gave the bowlers enough runs to defend.In the end, India won by 29 runs, an important but hard-earned victory that showed both their resilience and the areas they still need to improve.",India beat USA by 29 runs in their opening match of the T20 World Cup.

NEW DELHI: India’s new-ball bowlers Arshdeep Singh and Mohammed Siraj struck with the new ball to leave the USA reeling at 13 for 3 inside the first three overs, after the co-hosts had earlier been restricted to 161 for 9 in their opening 2026 T20 World Cup match in Mumbai on Saturday.The early damage proved decisive. The USA never recovered from the collapse, and India went on to register a 29-run win.Milind Kumar and Sanjay Krishnamurthi attempted to steady the innings with a 58-run stand for the fourth wicket. However, the damage done by Siraj and Arshdeep with the new ball meant the USA middle and lower-middle order faced a stiff task against Axar Patel, Varun Chakravarthy and Hardik Pandya.At the halfway stage of the chase, the USA still needed 113 runs to pull off an upset against the defending champions, with the required rate climbing beyond 10 an over. Wickets continued to fall at regular intervals, and the innings never gathered momentum.The USA could score only 132 runs for the loss of 8 wickets in their 20 overs. Milind Kumar (34), Shubham Ranjane (37) and Suraj Krishnamurthi (37) fought well but were no match to the big-match experience of Indian bowlers.Pacers Mohammad Siraj (3/29) Arshdeep Singh (2/18) and left-arm spinner Axar Patel (2/24) were the pick of the bowlers.Earlier, India were lifted by skipper Suryakumar Yadav, who played a counter-attacking knock of 84 not out from 49 balls, hitting 10 boundaries and four sixes, even as wickets fell steadily at the other end.India were in deep trouble at 77 for 6 in the 13th over before Suryakumar guided them to a competitive total. USA pacer Shadley van Schalkwyk had led the bowling effort, picking up 4 for 25, including three wickets in a single over to dismiss Ishan Kishan (20), Tilak Varma (25) and Shivam Dube (0).Despite Suryakumar’s effort, India finished with what was considered a below-par 161 for 9, after a collective batting failure against a disciplined USA attack.Van Schalkwyk ended with figures of 4-0-25-4 as India’s batting line-up, apart from Suryakumar, struggled throughout the innings. India failed to score off the first four balls, with USA maintaining tight lines and denying room to the batters.Ishan Kishan broke the shackles with a six off the fifth ball, but India lost Abhishek Sharma for a first-ball duck in the second over. The top-ranked batter hit Ali Khan straight to Sanjay Krishnamurthi at deep cover, silencing the Wankhede Stadium.Tilak Varma showed intent by stepping out to hit Saurabh Netravalkar straight in the third over and followed it up with three fours off van Schalkwyk. Just as India seemed to find rhythm, Ishan hit Ali Khan for another six but then holed out to mid-off off van Schalkwyk on the first ball of the sixth over.Tilak soon followed, mistiming a pull shot off a short delivery from van Schalkwyk and offering a catch to Monank Patel. Shivam Dube was dismissed for a duck, beaten by a slow bouncer and caught by Netravalkar at short fine leg.Rinku Singh scored 6 from 14 balls before finding long-on off Mohammad Mohsin. Hardik Pandya fell for 5 while attempting a big shot against Harmeet Singh, and Axar Patel made 14 before being dismissed while looking for late runs.With the responsibility resting solely on him, Suryakumar managed the strike carefully and played his shots with control. He was the only Indian batter to fully read the pitch and accelerated in the final overs, scoring 34 runs off the last two, including 21 off the final over bowled by Netravalkar.That effort proved enough, as India’s bowlers completed the job to seal a comfortable win.","India beat USA by 29 runs in opening 2026 T20 World Cup match in Mumbai.

The 2026 T20 World Cup is the largest edition so far in terms of participating teams.""It's always good to have more teams in the World Cup, that's why lots of nations come in and you see lots of new talent, which you haven't seen and different teams come in, they give tough time to the oppositions and I think that's how the World Cup becomes bigger and bigger,” Rashid said on the eve of Afghanistan’s match against New Zealand.""It doesn't matter if you are losing or winning the game, but you show to the world that you are capable of beating any side, any time as long as you have that belief,"" he added.Afghanistan are placed in Group D along with New Zealand and South Africa. Rashid said the team is ready for the challenge in a tough group.“In World Cup, you don't get things easily, it's always very tough and that's the beauty of T20 cricket. You have to pass through the tough lines to achieve something bigger and I feel like that's something which is a challenge for us.If you want to achieve bigger things, you have to go through tough routes and we have tough oppositions.""“But still you have to keep that belief in yourself and keep pushing yourself in the ground, as we have done in the ‘24 World Cup, where we have beaten big teams. I think the confidence is there, but it's just about making sure we do the right things at the right time,” he added.Rashid said the experience Afghan players have gained from playing in the IPL will help them during the tournament.“We do have good spinners, but still you have to bowl well. And the wicket looks good, I think it looks good to bat on, but still the experience you have of playing a lot in IPL in here, I think you have to use that experience here and you can bowl the best to the batter, so it's going to be a good game,” he said.",Afghanistan are placed in Group D along with New Zealand and South Africa.

T20 World Cup Groups Explained: Who Can Reach the Super 8

CONFIDENT OF BEATING 'BIG' TEAMS

INDIAN FOOD ON DRACA'S TO-DO LIST

NEW DELHI: Italy all-rounder Thomas Draca is eager to step onto the field and soak in the sea of support from his country in the T20 World Cup. Long celebrated as a football-mad nation that has produced legends like Alessandro Del Piero, Gianluigi Buffon, Andrea Pirlo, Franco Baresi, Paolo Maldini, Roberto Baggio, and Francesco Totti, Italy is now scripting a new chapter — one that puts cricket on the national sporting map. Draca is determined to experience every moment, especially the chants of “Forza Italia! Forza Italia!” as Italy take the field for their T20 World Cup opener against Scotland on Monday at Eden Gardens in Kolkata.Draca was just six years old when Italy won the FIFA World Cup in 2006. That victory, their fourth, came after a thrilling 5–3 penalty shootout win over France, a moment that left a lasting impression on the young sports enthusiast.“The moment is going to be surreal. It’s a dream come true. I was only six years old when Italy won the football World Cup in 2006, and that was probably the first World Cup I remember watching. Funny enough, I was supporting Australia at the time. People often joke about the comparison between Italian football and Italian cricket. The football team hasn’t qualified for a World Cup in a while, so it’s become a bit of a running joke.I remember playing a league game in Nepal when commentators kept saying, ‘Thomas Draca is playing in a cricket World Cup when the football team can’t even make it.’ That line always comes up. I was six when they won, and now here we are,” Draca told TimesofIndia.com in an exclusive interview.“Football was my main sport growing up. I played until around 2016 and went through academy systems in Australia. In 2013, I went to Stoke City in the UK to try and make it professionally, and in 2014 I played in the MIC Cup in Spain against teams from Madrid and Barcelona. That’s when I really saw the standard in Europe — those kids were on another level and clearly destined to turn professional. I was a bit of a late bloomer and realised I couldn’t quite match that level. Cricket, at that stage, was something I played casually — backyard games and junior cricket on Saturdays, just for fun. But over time, cricket became my true love. Growing up, football was the dream; now, cricket is that dream,” the Italy all-rounder added.For Draca — who has played nine T20Is and taken 11 wickets so far in his career — sport at home was always a battle between football and cricket. His father loved football and his mother loved cricket.“My dad never pushed me into anything. He always told me to choose what I wanted to do. Some of my extended family were probably a bit disappointed when I gave up football, but they’re completely behind my cricket now. During the Ashes, my mum suddenly started watching cricket — something I’d never seen before. She even called me to ask about Pat Cummins’ haircut. That was probably the first time she’d ever spoken to me about cricket. My parents never had a bias about which sport I chose. Once they saw I was serious, they supported me fully. Looking back, I’m glad I chose cricket,” he said.Italy earned a historic spot in the 2026 ICC Men’s T20 World Cup by defeating hosts Netherlands in the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup Europe Region Final.This milestone is not just significant for Thomas Draca but signals the beginning of a new era for cricket across Italy.Drawn in a challenging group alongside Scotland, West Indies, Nepal, and England, Italy are set to make their maiden appearance on the world stage.With little external hype surrounding the team, Draca remains confident, believing that Italy has the talent and energy to compete with — and even upset — big teams in the tournament.After playing Scotland on Monday, Italy will take on Nepal on February 12, England on February 16 and West Indies on February 19.“Our group is strong, but if we can get one or two early wins and then go into the England game on the 16th with momentum, you never know in T20 cricket — anything can happen. We’re coming off a tri-series against Ireland that we lost 1-2, and every game was extremely close. The margins were small, and by the third match we felt we had figured things out. Grant Stewart’s performance in the final game, when he hit three sixes in a row to seal the win, showed what we’re capable of. Performances like that earlier in the series could have changed outcomes as well,” he added.“We’ve got a strong coaching staff and an open environment where ideas are constantly shared. Our focus is on being the best-prepared team possible. Now the task is Scotland, and we’re ready. If we can knock off a West Indies or an England, it could really make people sit up and take notice. We’re excited about the challenge and we’ll give it everything,” he said.Among all his plans, Draca has made sampling India’s diverse cuisines a top priority on this trip.""I’d love to experience the different foods and cultures. When I was in Nepal, I didn’t really leave the hotel much, so this time I’ve promised myself I’ll get out, explore, visit some tourist spots, and really take in the culture. A few friends are flying to India as well, and we’re planning to do this together. It should be a great opportunity to experience everything properly and try different foods,"" Draca said.",Thomas Draca is eager to step onto the field and soak in the sea of support from his country in the T20 World Cup. Draca was just six years old when Italy won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.

Barcelona strengthened their grip on the La Liga title race with a commanding 3-0 victory over Mallorca on Saturday, opening up a four-point lead at the top of the table. Teenage sensation Lamine Yamal played a central role, responding to an earlier miss with a stunning long-range finish that underlined his growing influence. Robert Lewandowski set Barça on their way in the first half before 18-year-old academy graduate Marc Bernal wrapped up the points late on with the first goal of his senior career. The result gives Barcelona breathing space at the summit, although second-placed Real Madrid have the chance to cut the deficit to a single point when they travel to Valencia on Sunday.Lewandowski broke the deadlock in the 29th minute, reacting quickest after Marcus Rashford’s initial effort down the left was blocked. The striker calmly brought the ball under control, shifted it away from a defender and finished with precision from close range.Rashford’s growing confidence was evident again just before the interval. His curling free kick in stoppage time forced an excellent save from Mallorca goalkeeper Leo Roman. The rebound dropped invitingly for Jules Koundé inside the area, but his mishit effort fell to Yamal, who surprisingly failed to convert from virtually on the goal line.Lewandowski, one of the game’s most prolific scorers with more than 650 club goals to his name, was quick to encourage the young winger after the miss. Yamal made amends in emphatic fashion in the 61st minute. Skipping past a defender on the edge of the box, he unleashed a fierce, dipping left-footed strike into the bottom corner, leaving Roman rooted to the spot.Both Yamal and Lewandowski were substituted later in the match and watched on approvingly as Bernal added the third in the 83rd minute. Barcelona cut through Mallorca’s midfield with a sharp passing move that released the teenager, who showed impressive composure to glide past a defender and slot the ball neatly inside the post.Elsewhere in La Liga, two fixtures were postponed. Rayo Vallecano’s home clash with Oviedo was called off due to safety concerns over the pitch at Vallecas Stadium, while Sevilla’s match against Girona was also postponed because of adverse weather.

NEW DELHI: Few clubs in Indian football have risen as swiftly or as symbolically as Real Kashmir FC. From their debut season to becoming consistent contenders in the Indian Football League (IFL), the Srinagar-based club has carved out a reputation for resilience and ambition. Yet, as the upcoming I-League season prepares to kick off on Feb 21, the Snow Leopards find themselves navigating a familiar terrain of uncertainty both on and off the pitch.Real Kashmir, back-to-back IFA Shield winners (2020 and 2021), have finished among the top five six times in I-League in the seven seasons they have competed. However, the postponement of the season has created significant logistical and financial challenges, not just for Real Kashmir but for clubs across the league.Club owner Arshad Shawl, who took over as part of the leadership group in 2019, candidly said that the turmoil is the result of a system that leaned too heavily on a single private entity for over a decade.“You have to understand the ecosystem of Indian football over the last 15 years,” Shawl told TOI. “When that private support was pulled out, there was no contingency plan in place.”With the All India Football Federation (AIFF) under financial strain, I-League clubs have been forced to absorb much of the operational burden themselves.For Real Kashmir, the challenge is compounded by geography and climate. Pre-season preparations in sub-zero temperatures, coupled with an an uncertain calendar, have made the task even tougher.“Starting this season is like starting a frozen engine in minus temperatures and asking it to run a rally,” Shawl added.Despite the obstacles, the club’s philosophy stays firmly rooted in local identity. Real Kashmir have consistently prioritised Kashmiri players and home grown talent, a vision reflected in the appointment of former India international and Kashmir native Ishfaq Ahmed as head coach. Under his guidance, the club has become a platform for local footballers to dream bigger. “This club has put Kashmir on the front pages for a happier reason,” Shawl said. “It allowed the world to look at Kashmir through the lens of football.”Beyond the first team, Real Kashmir has invested in a structured youth development, blending local prospects with experienced Indian and overseas players. A capable backroom staff supports the squad.”What continues to hold the club back, Shawl insists, is beyond its control. “We are doing everything that we can control,” he said, pointing to ownership stability, player commitment, and grass roots development.","Real Kashmir have been consistent contenders in the Indian Football League (IFL) The Snow Leopards have finished among the top five six times in the seven seasons they have competed.

Marissa Ayers brings spotlight as Giants future takes shape



Marissa Ayers became an unexpected Super Bowl week talking point as New York Giants optimism quietly found a new rhythm. Even without playoff football, the franchise generated buzz for reasons that go beyond the standings. A coaching reset and a rookie quarterback who looks comfortable in the spotlight have reshaped how the Giants are being discussed across the league and on social media.What unfolded in the days leading up to Super Bowl LX was not about wins or losses. It was about visibility, confidence, and the sense that the Giants are finally building something that feels modern. From the hiring of John Harbaugh to Jaxson Dart’s growing presence off the field, the franchise is drawing attention in places it rarely reached in recent years.Marissa Ayers entered Super Bowl week already commanding a massive digital audience, and her appearance alongside Jaxson Dart at the NFL Honors ceremony on February 5 only amplified that reach. Ayers, who has built a following of 1.6 million TikTok users, quickly became part of the broader Giants conversation. Her visibility is now closely tied to Dart, the quarterback many believe could anchor the team for the next decade.That attention peaked a day later when Ayers posted a TikTok showing what she described as her “little red outfit of the day!” The video, filmed as she headed out to support Dart during media obligations, focused on her outfit details, jewelry, and styling choices. It spread fast, proving that Giants headlines are no longer limited to game film and press conferences.Dart appears comfortable with that spotlight. His rookie season already hinted at leadership qualities, and the front office doubled down by pairing him with Cam Skattebo in the backfield. The chemistry between the two has fueled internal optimism, while Harbaugh’s arrival has given the locker room a long-term voice of authority.Ayers has been candid about her role in Dart’s world. She has said she does not know much about football and mainly follows the Giants. That honesty has only made her more relatable to fans discovering her through Dart. She has also picked her side for Super Bowl LX game.Their relationship timeline mirrors the steady rise in public interest. The pair went on their first date in October, shared Halloween together, and sparked rumors after being seen at a party. By December 1, Ayers attended her first Giants game against the Patriots in Foxborough. A winter trip to Salt Lake City later confirmed their status, and they made it Instagram official on January 9.For the Giants, the combination of a credible coaching hire, a promising quarterback, and a growing cultural presence signals momentum that feels real.","Marissa Ayers became an unexpected talking point as New York Giants optimism quietly found a new rhythm.

Dave Portnoy questions Buccaneers’ timing as Patriots return to Super Bowl stage



With Super Bowl LX just hours away, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers found themselves pulled into the spotlight for reasons unrelated to this season. On Saturday, the team’s official social media account shared a throwback video featuring former stars Tom Brady and Rob Gronkowski celebrating their Super Bowl LV win. While the clip highlighted a proud moment in franchise history, the timing raised eyebrows, especially as attention across the league remains fixed on the New England Patriots and Seattle Seahawks preparing for Super Bowl LX.The post quickly drew a sharp reaction from Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy, who felt the Buccaneers were inserting themselves into a moment that did not belong to them. With New England back on the Super Bowl stage for the first time since the Brady era, Portnoy argued that the focus should remain on the teams competing on Sunday, not on memories from a past championship.Portnoy did not soften his criticism when responding to the post on social media. “It’s embarrassing. Never seen a franchise try to mooch off another franchise more than this,” he wrote, a comment that quickly gained traction among Patriots fans online. His reaction reflected a broader sentiment that Brady’s legacy is still closely tied to New England rather than Tampa Bay.Brady spent 20 seasons with the Patriots and won six Super Bowls during his time there, becoming the face of one of the most successful dynasties in NFL history.Although his move to Tampa Bay in 2020 led to immediate success, including a Super Bowl LV title, many fans still view his greatest achievements through the lens of his Patriots career. In that championship game against the Kansas City Chiefs, Brady threw for 201 yards and three touchdowns, two of them to Gronkowski, in a dominant 31-9 victory.Since Brady’s departure, the Patriots have endured a long championship drought. That storyline may finally be changing. Under new head coach Mike Vrabel, New England has rebuilt its identity and emerged as an unexpected Super Bowl contender. The team secured the AFC title with a gritty 10-7 win over the Denver Broncos and now faces Seattle in Super Bowl LX.As kickoff approaches, Portnoy’s comments underline a clear message. For Patriots supporters, this Super Bowl represents a chance to write a new chapter, one that stands on its own without being overshadowed by reminders from another franchise’s past.","The Tampa Bay Buccaneers shared a throwback video of Tom Brady and Rob Gronkowski celebrating their Super Bowl LV win.

Stefon Diggs drops an honest reality check after Patriots teammates mock his age,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/stefon-diggs-drops-an-honest-reality-check-after-patriots-teammates-mock-his-age/articleshow/128056786.cms,"Stefon Diggs resoond to teammates age jokes(Image via: IG/X)

Stefon Diggs shares how locker room jokes about his age led to a simple reminder he once heard as a young player

Stefon Diggs did not lose his cool when the jokes started flying. Instead, he smiled and leaned into the moment. During Super Bowl LX week, the Patriots wideout admitted the younger guys in the room keep taking playful shots at his age. He answered with a calm reminder that hit deeper than the laughter.The timing makes it more interesting. New England is preparing for the biggest game of the season, yet the locker room still has space for banter. Diggs, now 32 and one of the oldest players on the roster, has turned those jokes into a small lesson about how fast an NFL career moves.Stefon Diggs spoke to reporters during the Super Bowl LX media conference in Santa Clara, where he opened up about the running joke inside the Patriots' wide receiver group. He kept the mood relaxed while explaining how often it comes up.“They make fun of me all the time,” Diggs said during the Super Bowl LX media session. The line did not come out of nowhere. Diggs said he once did the same thing earlier in his career. He recalled a moment with veteran receiver Mike Wallace that stayed with him over the years.“Mike Wallace told me a long time ago when I was young,” Diggs added.The popular wideout continued, “I think I met him in year seven or eight.I was like, 'Damn, you're old. 'And he'd say, 'You're going to be old one day too. 'I will never forget that statement. At this point, Pop [DeMario Douglas], Kyle Williams, and even Kayshon—they make fun of me all the time.""To which popular WR responds, ""Look, you’ll all be old one day too, and we’ll revisit this conversation again.”That memory now shapes how he handles jokes from younger teammates such as DeMario Douglas, Kyle Williams, and Kayshon Boutte. Instead of pushing back, he turns it into perspective. In his view, every young player reaches that point sooner than expected.The context around the moment matters. Diggs is in his first season with New England after signing a three-year, 69 million dollar deal last offseason. Despite the age talk, he still delivered on the field with his seventh 1,000-yard season, finishing with 1,013 yards as the Patriots pushed toward the Super Bowl.He also spoke about his growing chemistry with quarterback Drake Maye in that segment. “His maturation process is second to none,” Diggs said. “He’s still super young, but he plays at a high level. I’m a huge fan of him.”That mix of humor, memory, and production explains the moment. The jokes may be harmless, but Diggs answered with a veteran truth shaped by years in the league.",New England Patriots wideout Stefon Diggs is one of the oldest players on the roster.

Shannon Sharpe addresses speculation after reuniting with Stephen A. Smith on Radio Row

The unexpected reunion between Shannon Sharpe and Stephen A. Smith on Radio Row quickly became one of the most talked-about moments of Super Bowl week. The longtime media figures appeared together during a live taping of Sharpe’s Nightcap podcast with Chad “Ochocinco” Johnson, instantly reviving the familiar chemistry that once defined their on-screen debates. Short clips from the appearance spread rapidly across social media, drawing attention well beyond Radio Row.The timing of the reunion only added to the intrigue. With Super Bowl week placing every media interaction under a microscope, the moment sparked fresh conversation about what it could mean moving forward. While there was no official announcement attached to the appearance, the lack of clarity fueled growing debate about whether this was simply a one-off crossover or a sign of something more.As the buzz grew, Shannon Sharpe addressed the speculation directly in comments to Front Office Sports, making it clear that any decision about his next step is out of his hands.“That’s not my call. I would love to go back if they were to call. Burke [Magnus], Jimmy [Pitaro], and Dave Roberts,” Sharpe said. “That is their call. But obviously, I’m more than willing; I’m more than capable.”Rather than focusing on titles or roles, Sharpe pointed to his audience reach.His Club Shay Shay podcast continues to rank among YouTube’s most-watched sports shows, driven by viral interviews and steady engagement.The conversation also demonstrates the turns in the recent career of Sharpe. In June 2023, he parted with Skip Bayless after six years with Undisputed on FS1, and the split concluded one of the most controversial collaborations in the sports television industry. The move was not only well-known but also a turning point in his media career.Sharpe then returned on the First Take show with Stephen A. Smith, where his commentary and humor soon became viral. In June 2024, he signed a multi-year extension, suggesting long-term plans.Now, after a brief but telling Radio Row reunion, the conversation has returned. Whether it leads to a bigger role or remains a moment of speculation, the growing debate shows that Shannon Sharpe’s voice still carries undeniable influence in sports media.",Shannon Sharpe and Stephen A.

Is Travis Kelce really considering retirement? Insider reveals private conversations from tight end’s camp,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/is-travis-kelce-really-considering-retirement-insider-reveals-private-conversations-from-tight-ends-camp/articleshow/128056051.cms,"Travis Kelce retirement rumors (Getty Images)

Travis Kelce’s retirement outlook remains fluid as Chiefs wait on his call



Travis Kelce's retirement talk refuses to cool down, but the facts right now point toward patience, not panic. The Kansas City Chiefs tight end remains undecided about his future, even as people close to him quietly lean toward another season. What matters most is simple. Kelce has not said he is done, and the Chiefs are prepared to welcome him back if he chooses to continue.That uncertainty defines this moment. After a rare losing season in Kansas City, questions around age, motivation, and legacy have followed Kelce into the offseason. Still, league insiders and team leadership see signs of unfinished business. For a player who has shaped an era at his position, the decision is bigger than one final year or one more run at a ring.Reports from The Athletic’s Dianna Russini suggest that retirement has been discussed, but not locked in. “I’m told that while retirement has been discussed, many close to Travis Kelce believe he could return for a 14th season,” Russini reported on Friday. “The future Hall of Famer has yet to make a final decision about his future.” That belief carries weight because it reflects conversations happening beyond microphones and press conferences.The Chiefs are clearly on board if Kelce wants to return for the 2026–2027 season. Team CEO Clark Hunt made that clear while balancing optimism with respect. “As an organization, we certainly hope that he will come back,” Hunt said. “He had another great year. Maybe not on par with where he was four or five years ago, but still had over 800 yards, was really one of the leaders on the offensive side of the ball for us. So there’s no doubt in my mind that he can still play. ”Kelce’s production backs that up. He finished the 2025 season with 76 receptions for 851 yards and two touchdowns on a team that struggled to find rhythm. Those numbers do not scream decline. They suggest adaptation. At 36, Kelce remains a reliable target and a locker room anchor, even as the Chiefs search for their next offensive identity.The long-term picture only strengthens his case. Kelce’s résumé already reads like a Hall of Fame blueprint. He owns 13,002 receiving yards, 1,080 receptions, and 82 receiving touchdowns, along with seven straight 1,000-yard seasons. Add 11 Pro Bowls, seven All-Pro selections, and three Super Bowl titles, and the question is no longer if he will reach Canton, but how quickly.Kelce himself is still weighing the personal cost. Tony Gonzalez, another gold-standard tight end, shared insight after spending time with him late in the season. “I did an interview with him on Christmas, sat down with him, spent some time with him after that on a personal level, and I really believe — he said it in the interview — he’s like, ‘I really don’t know.’ I believe him,” Gonzalez said. “Even in the interview, I was kind of like, ‘Come on, you know a little bit, you got to know something. ’”That honesty matters. Kelce also came up short at NFL Honors, leaving without the Walter Payton NFL Man of the Year Award after being nominated by the Chiefs. Bobby Wagner ultimately won, but the week reinforced Kelce’s standing as a respected figure on and off the field.For now, the noise around Travis Kelce retirement is louder than the answers. The Chiefs are waiting. The league is watching. And Kelce is taking his time, which may be the clearest signal that this story is not finished yet.","Travis Kelce's retirement talk refuses to cool down, but the facts right now point toward patience, not panic.

A fan message shifts focus on Shedeur Sanders’ first NFL season



Shedeur Sanders’ 24th birthday unfolded far differently from a typical celebration, marking a reflective moment in his young NFL journey. Now in his first year as a professional quarterback with the Cleveland Browns, Sanders reached a personal milestone shaped as much by scrutiny as by opportunity. His rookie season delivered moments of promise, but it also came with steady criticism that followed him from college into the league, fueled by expectations tied to his last name and draft-night storyline.Instead of a flood of birthday wishes, Sanders found himself at the center of a deeper online conversation. A long post shared on X by a user @Horvah76 quickly gained traction, standing out for its tone and intent. The message urged Sanders to stop carrying the weight of outside judgment and view his setbacks as part of a longer journey. As the post spread, it sparked discussion across NFL circles and soon drew attention well beyond the usual fan chatter.“Shedeur Sanders, I understand that today is your birthday, but this is not a 'Happy Birthday' post,” the user wrote. “This is a message.” The post challenged the narratives built around Sanders during the NFL draft process and questioned the faith placed in league decision-makers, including Browns head coach Kevin Stefanski.“God picked you….to have your character falsely attacked and assassinated by the national media in the months leading up to the draft,” the post continued. It also referenced Sanders falling out of the first round, framing the moment as public humiliation rather than a true measure of his talent. The message positioned those experiences as tests meant to shape Sanders’ character and future, rather than define his ceiling in the league.The emotional weight of the post caught the attention of Deion Sanders, who has remained closely connected to his son’s football path. The Colorado head coach reacted publicly, keeping his response short but meaningful. “This is Heavy! Lawd Jesus,” Sanders wrote, signaling how deeply the message resonated. For Shedeur Sanders, the viral moment underscored how closely his career continues to be watched.His rookie year included growth, learning, and criticism, much of it amplified by draft-night narratives and national attention. As he turns 24, the focus briefly shifted from results to resilience. With another season ahead, Sanders moves forward carrying lessons from a challenging first year.","Shedeur Sanders' 24th birthday marked a reflective moment in his NFL journey.

All eyes on Super Bowl 2026 as Kim Kardashian and Kylie Jenner attempt to bury the Kardashian curse with Seahawks,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/all-eyes-on-super-bowl-2026-as-kim-kardashian-and-kylie-jenner-attempt-to-bury-the-kardashian-curse-with-seahawks/articleshow/128055157.cms,"Kardashian sisters curse and Super Bowl LX (Getty Images)

Can the Seahawks break the Kardashian curse? Kim Kardashian and Kylie Jenner think Super Bowl 2026 is the moment



The Kardashian Curse has returned to the sports spotlight just days before the Super Bowl, driven by Kim Kardashian and Kylie Jenner turning a viral myth into a public wager. The long-running internet theory claims that athletes linked romantically to the Kardashian-Jenner family suffer sudden career misfortune. This time, the sisters are flipping the narrative using high-stakes sports betting, humor, and social media reach to challenge the superstition head-on.What makes this moment notable is not the rumor itself, but how deliberately the family is engaging with it. Rather than brushing off the chatter, Kim and Kylie are leaning in, placing real bets, and inviting millions of followers to watch the outcome unfold during one of the biggest nights in American sports.Kim Kardashian addressed the rumor directly while sharing her Fanatics Sportsbook slip ahead of the Feb. 8 Super Bowl matchup between the Seattle Seahawks and New England Patriots. “Here me out … I’m proving the curse ISN’T real because one of us will win,” she wrote on Instagram Stories Feb. 6. Her 69-cent wager on the Seahawks carries a potential payout of $347,222, a symbolic move that quickly went viral.Kylie Jenner followed with her own playful nod. “Kim traded on the Seahawks,” the 28-year-old posted on Instagram Stories Feb.8. “Am I saying I copied her by trading on the Seahawks?” The comment echoed Kim’s famous family joke about copying weddings, turning a betting choice into a pop culture callback.Meanwhile, Kendall Jenner took a different route. Seeking a more analytical angle, she consulted Tom Brady on The Tonight Show. “I am trying to figure out who I want to go for for the Super Bowl and I am an information person,” Kendall told Brady. “I feel like I need all the information I can get to make an educated decision. I was thinking you’re the perfect person to ask for that information.” After the call, she declared, “I feel I’m going to go Patriots. ”Kendall has also leaned into the myth through satire. In a new Fanatics Sportsbook ad, she jokes, “Haven’t you heard? The internet says I’m cursed.” She adds, “Any basketball player who dates me kind of hits a rough patch,” before closing with, “Kardashian Curse…it’s not even my last name.”",The Kardashian Curse has returned to the sports spotlight just days before the Super Bowl.

“That’s my man”: J Balvin fuels Super Bowl buzz backing Bad Bunny while rumors swirl about his secret guest appearance,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/thats-my-man-j-balvin-fuels-super-bowl-buzz-backing-bad-bunny-while-rumors-swirl-about-his-secret-guest-appearance/articleshow/128054599.cms,"J Balvin weighs in on Bad Bunny Super Bowl controversy (Getty Images)

J Balvin fires back at critics questioning Bad Bunny’s all-Spanish Super Bowl show



The Bad Bunny Super Bowl halftime show has become one of the most debated entertainment decisions in recent NFL history, and it will finally unfold on Sunday in Santa Clara. The league’s choice to hand the Super Bowl LX stage to the Puerto Rican superstar has stirred excitement, anger, and political noise in equal measure, weeks before a single note is played. Bad Bunny , born Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio, will perform as the Seattle Seahawks face the New England Patriots, carrying the weight of cultural expectation along with the spotlight. Much of the backlash centers on language and politics, but close friend and global hitmaker J Balvin believes the controversy misses the point of music itself.J Balvin has been clear about why English-speaking audiences do not need translation to feel Bad Bunny’s performance. Speaking to TMZ, the Colombian singer framed the issue through his own experience as a young listener discovering hip-hop.“I learned and grew up listening to hip-hop,” Balvin said. “I didn’t know what they were saying. I would just vibe with it.”For Balvin, rhythm and emotion come before lyrics. “They just gotta jump on the flavor, that’s all they gotta do,” he added. “That’s followers.” His comments underline a broader idea the NFL appears to be embracing: the Super Bowl is no longer just an American event but a global one, shaped by sounds and cultures that travel beyond borders.The resistance, however, has been loud. President Donald Trump has been among the most vocal critics, while Hall of Fame running back Eric Dickerson questioned the NFL’s decision to look outside the local music scene. “Why can't we get somebody from right here, from home?” Dickerson asked. “I don't see why they chose that.” He also raised doubts about how a Spanish-language performance would land with a national audience.On being asked his favorite Bad Bunny song, Balvin said,""“All of them!” he said. That’s my man.”Bad Bunny has not softened his stance amid the criticism. He recently renewed his condemnation of ICE during his Grammy speech, continuing a pattern of speaking openly about issues that matter to him. The pressure has been intense. Days before the show, he admitted the buildup has been exhausting. “Thinking about the Super Bowl at 4am, that's what I've been doing,” he said. “Last night I couldn't sleep, I was thinking about it. ”Still, his focus remains on the moment itself. “I want to think it's 13 minutes of doing what I love,” Bad Bunny said. “I know I'm gonna have fun.”",J Balvin says Bad Bunny controversy misses the point of music.

With Super Bowl LX one day away, DoorDash leaned into personality, rivalry, and humor, creating a moment that landed with both fan bases.Super Bowl LX marketing found its heartbeat on February 7, when DoorDash rolled out a playful social media duel featuring Ann Michael Maye and Katie Hoofnagle. The campaign asked a simple question with big appeal. Which city eats better. Hoofnagle spoke up first, framing Seattle as the clear winner with confidence and a wink.She praised the Pacific Northwest staples and took a clever jab at New England comfort food.“Best coffee, best food, best fans,” Hoofnagle said while arguing Seattle’s case, adding that ramen is “kind of like clam chowder, just better”. The message was sharp, casual, and tuned perfectly for Super Bowl week scrolling.Ann Michael Maye answered with equal flair. Her video defended New England’s reputation, spotlighting iced coffee, baked goods, and the region’s signature seafood. She leaned into regional pride with lobster rolls that, in her words, “Seattle could never” match. The caption sealed the moment and invited debate with a grin. “Let’s settle the beef, Seattle”.Despite the mock rivalry, the tone stayed warm.

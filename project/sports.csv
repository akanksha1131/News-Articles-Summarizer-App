The Indian junior men's hockey team players demonstrated sportsmanship by exchanging pleasantries with their Pakistani counterparts during the Sultan of Johor Cup in Malaysia on Tuesday, contrasting with the recent ""no handshake"" incidents between the countries' cricket teams following security tensions.Videos and photos circulating showed U-21 players from both sides greeting each other and engaging in high fives during their encounter.This friendly exchange came shortly after India and Pakistan's cricket teams avoided handshakes during their Asia Cup matches in UAE and World Cup game in Colombo, following the Pahalgam terrorist attack and India's retaliatory Operation Sindoor The cricket teams maintained their stance of no handshakes across three Asia Cup encounters, with the women's teams following suit during their World Cup match in Sri Lanka.India's refusal to shake hands and accept the Asia Cup trophy from Asian Cricket Council chairman Mohsin Naqvi led to Pakistan filing official complaints with the ACC and ICC.""India cannot accept the trophy from a person who is waging a war against the country,"" the BCCI stated, justifying the team's refusal after Naqvi, who serves as PCB chief and Pakistan's interior minister, declined to present the trophy.The hockey match itself proved competitive as India and Pakistan played to a 3-3 draw in their third group-stage match of the age-group tournament.India displayed resilience by overcoming a two-goal deficit to take the lead, before Pakistan scored late to level the match.The draw helped India maintain their undefeated status in the tournament.",India and Pakistan played out a 3-3 draw in the Sultan of Johor Cup.

Italy secured a 3-0 victory against Israel in their 2026 World Cup qualifier in Udine on Tuesday, amid protests and clashes between pro-Palestinian demonstrators and police. Around 10,000 protesters marched through the city, with some engaging in disorder despite Monday's Gaza ceasefire deal and a hostage-prisoner exchange between Israel and Hamas.Over 1,000 police officers and army personnel were deployed, with helicopters and drones monitoring the demonstration. The protest was kept several kilometers away from the Bluenergy Stadium hosting the Group I fixture.""It's pointless hiding it, today was not easy, neither for us nor for you. There were many days in which we thought that there might be the possibility that we might not even play the match. We came here knowing it wouldn't be a party atmosphere and we felt that. I hope that in the future things will be a bit calmer. I think it will be, I don't know what other problems could come out,"" Italy coach Gennaro Gattuso told journalists after the match.Security checkpoints were established around the stadium, with spectators passing through concrete barriers and metal detectors to watch the crucial match in Italy's bid to qualify for their first World Cup since 2014.The initially peaceful march began at 1800 local time, featuring drumming and sound systems accompanying dancers of all ages waving Palestinian flags and banners reading ""show Israel the red card.""""There's no more bombs and that makes us happy, but the problem with this peace plan is that there is no talk of a Palestinian state. There's no talk of self-determination, no talk about the West Bank nor of the fate of Gaza... it seems like Gaza will be governed by Tony Blair and Donald Trump, without any involvement from the Palestinians. We shouldn't be playing this match because a team that represents a nation that has committed a genocide is playing,"" said Amer Hasan, a 61-year-old Palestinian representative from the West Bank.The march was organised by Palestinian communities in Veneto and Fruili-Venezia Giulia regions, along with four other associations, welcoming over 340 activist groups from across Italy.Protesters called for FIFA to exclude Israel from international competition, similar to Russia's exclusion following the Ukraine invasion in February 2022. They chanted slogans including ""Free Palestine"" and ""Genocidal Israel.""The death toll in the Gaza Strip has reached 67,869 Palestinians since Israel's military offensive began following Hamas's cross-border assault on October 7, 2023.Italian football federation's refusal to boycott matches with Israel has sparked anger, contrasting with Norway's Football Association's stance calling for sanctions against Israel.""The Norwegian FA has begun taking a position against the presence of Israeli teams, there's a totally different type of behavior across the board compared to what you see here,"" said Carlina, an activist from Udine Committee For Palestine.The match proceeded with a small crowd of 10,000, where Italian fans booed the Israeli national anthem before being overwhelmed by applause.Mateo Retegui scored twice for Italy, first from a penalty in first-half stoppage time and again with a curling finish in the 74th minute. Gianluca Mancini added a third goal late in the match.The victory secured at least second place and a play-off spot for Italy in their group. Norway leads Italy by three points with a superior goal difference and two matches remaining, with only the top spot offering automatic qualification for next summer's finals in the USA, Canada, and Mexico.The protest ended with police using water cannon and tear gas on some marchers who threw projectiles at officers.","Italy secured a 3-0 victory against Israel in their 2026 World Cup qualifier in Udine on Tuesday, amid protests and clashes.

NEW DELHI: Rain denied Pakistan what could have been a memorable victory over four-time champions England, as the two sides ended up sharing points in an ICC Women’s World Cup encounter on Wednesday.Chasing a revised target of 113 in 31 overs after England had battled to 133/9 around the first rain interruption, Pakistan looked in control at 34 without loss in 6.4 overs when heavy rain forced the match to be abandoned.Earlier, Pakistan captain Fatima Sana produced a brilliant spell to restrict England, reducing them to 54/5 by the 10th over. Sana (4/27) caused early damage with her in-swingers, dismissing dangerous opener Tammy Beaumont (4), skipper Heather Knight (18), and last match’s centurion Nat Sciver-Brunt (4). Her fiery performance gave Pakistan hope of securing their first win in the tournament.When play resumed after rain, England struggled at 79/7 in 25 overs, managing only 54 runs in the final six overs. Charlie Dean (33) was the top scorer for England, who had won all three of their previous league matches by significant margins.For Pakistan, who had lost all three of their earlier games, Sana’s inspired spell was a rare highlight and showed the team’s potential to challenge the tournament favorites. However, relentless rain meant the contest ended in a draw, with both sides sharing points.","Pakistan and England share points in ICC Women's World Cup encounter.

Poll Do you think veteran players like Siddhesh Lad should make way for young talents? Yes, Always No, Experience Matters It Depends on Performance

When Siddhesh Lad returned to Mumbai set-up last campaign, the brief to him was clear: “You will only get an opportunity when those playing for India aren’t available.”The 33-year-old had no issues with it. After all, he could only thank his stars for walking back into the Mumbai dressing room which is known to phase out veterans to make way for youngsters.Lad played for Goa in the 2022-23 but took a cooling break, and scored heavily in Mumbai’s local tournaments, in 2023-24 to be eligible for Mumbai before making it to the squad last season.It was a successful comeback as he finished as Mumbai’s top-scorer with 602 runs in seven games. He started batting at No. 5 and 6 before being pushed up to No. 3.Before Mumbai’s Ranji Trophy opener at the Sher-I-Kashmir Stadium against Jammu & Kashmir, there was no clarity on whether the veteran will get a chance, but it didn’t matter to him. For three days he followed his routine religiously—focusing on fitness and spending long hours in the nets.On Wednesday, given an opportunity, he didn’t disappoint and started from where he had left last season, scoring a fighting 156-ball 116 to put Mumbai in drivers’ seat, repaying the faith shown in his ability by the selectors.Knowing what he brings to the table, the right-hand batter was asked to play at No. 4, termed as one of the crucial spots in world cricket, and he lauds the clearly defined role the coach Omkar Salvi, and captain Shardul Thakur have given to him.""I know what my role is in the team. I must stabilize the innings whenever I go in and depending on the situation, like today, spend some time on the wicket. There is a clear message from the coach and captain on what I must do, and that is what I'm trying,” said Lad, who was a tad disappointed after he couldn’t see off the day.He added: “Because I scored in the last season, I wanted to carry that confidence into this season. I'll thank my support staff, especially our head coach Omkar Salvi, and dedicate this 100 to them because for the last three-four months they've worked hard on my fitness and every aspect of my game.”Despite scoring all the runs last season, he may have not played the opening match but as luck had it, Shivam Dube got injured, and Lad was drafted in.“I’m okay with that,” Lad said of the eventuality of him sitting out.He added: “I'm 33 now, and if some youngster is playing in place of me, I'm very happy to let them have that opportunity, and whenever the team needs me, I'm there for them.”At the fag end of his career, his focus is on making vital contributions to the team’s cause rather than “individual honours”.“I want to do something for the team because my aim right now is not to score 1000 runs but I play crucial knocks that will help us win the Ranji Trophy. That will give me more satisfaction.”","Siddhesh Lad scored 116 in Mumbai's Ranji Trophy opener against Jammu & Kashmir.

South Africa, Ivory Coast and Senegal all won convincingly on Tuesday to fill the last three automatic places reserved for Africa at the 2026 World Cup.Senegal were the most impressive winners, hammering Mauritania 4-0, while Ivory Coast beat Kenya 3-0 and South Africa were also 3-0 winners, against Rwanda.The trio will join Algeria, Cape Verde , Egypt, Morocco, Senegal and Tunisia at the global showpiece in the United States, Canada and Mexico.Cameroon, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Gabon and Nigeria kept alive hopes of swelling the African representation to 10 nations by finishing as the four best-ranked runners-up.They will meet in two single-match semi-finals and a final in Morocco during November and the winners advance to inter-continental play-offs in March with two World Cup places up for grabs.Former Liverpool star Sadio Mane scored just before and after half-time for Group B table-toppers Senegal, with Iliman Ndiaye and Habib Diallo also netting for the Teranga Lions.Senegal finished with 24 points, two more than DR Congo, who edged Sudan 1-0 in Kinshasa through a Theo Bongonda goal.Manchester United winger Amad Diallo completed the scoring for the Ivory Coast, who led from the seventh minute in a convincing triumph over Kenya in Abidjan.Franck Kessie put the reigning African champions ahead and Yan Diomande added the second goal soon after half-time.Ivory Coast topped Group F with 26 points, one more than Gabon. Gambia overwhelmed the Seychelles 7-0 to come third.Thalente Mbatha and Oswin Appollis scored for South Africa in the first half and Evidence Makgopa sealed victory with a goal midway through the second period in Mbombela.South Africa topped Group C with 18 points, one more than Nigeria, who hammered third-placed Benin 4-0 in Uyo with Victor Osimhen claiming a hat-trick.It will be the fourth appearance by South Africa at the global showpiece. They qualified for the 1998 and 2002 tournaments and were automatic participants in 2010 as the host nation.Belgium-born South Africa coach Hugo Broos was thrilled as he represented his country as a player at the 1986 World Cup in Mexico and wanted to coach a team at the tournament before retiring.""We all knew that we could do it, we believed in ourselves. We are going to the World Cup and it is fantastic,"" said the 73-year-old.""In the last three years we changed players and every time it was the right choice. What happened tonight is the work of three years and the future looks very bright for South African football.""We have the Africa Cup of Nations in Morocco during December and then the World Cup. There are no words to express how I feel.""Winger Appollis was voted player of the match after scoring and creating the other goals as South Africa regained their scoring touch after failing to find the net in a draw with Zimbabwe last Friday.""What an amazing feeling for the group going to the World Cup. I am so happy for the boys,"" he told reporters.""I know we had a draw in our last game, but I knew that we would come here to Mbombela tonight and win.""Qualification was a huge relief for South Africa, who saw a five-point lead with four rounds remaining turn into a two-point deficit behind Benin entering the final round.South Africa dropped points in home draws with Nigeria and Zimbabwe and forfeited three points for fielding the ineligible Teboho Mokoena in a victory over Lesotho.South Africa needed to beat Rwanda and hope Nigeria defeated Benin, and that is what transpired with the home teams making dream starts.Nigeria were ahead within three minutes through Osimhen while Mbatha scored the first South African goal with just five minutes gone.A snap shot from Appollis midway through the opening half put South Africa in control and Rwanda spent most of the match on the back foot.Makgopa, a late call-up in place of the injured Iqraam Rayners, headed into the net off a corner on 72 minutes to complete the scoring.Osimhen netted a second time before half-time and completed his hat-trick six minutes into the second half. An added-time goal from Frank Onyeka completed the rout.Qatar and Saudi Arabia became the latest teams to book their spots at the 2026 World Cup, with each finishing top of their respective groups on Tuesday in the fourth round of Asian qualifying.In Group A, Qatar saw off the United Arab Emirates 2-1 in their must-win clash in Doha, where second-half goals from captain Boualem Khoukhi and Pedro Miguel sealed the 2022 hosts's place at next summer's finals in the United States, Canada and Mexico.Then, later in Jeddah, the Saudis came through a goalless draw at home to Iraq to book a berth at the 2026 showpiece.In qualifying on merit for a first World Cup, Qatar went some way to atoning for three years ago, when they entered the history books as the first hosts to lose all three group games.Against the UAE on Tuesday, the winners of the past two Asian Cups took the lead four minutes into the second half at the Jassim Bin Hamad Stadium where Khoukhi headed home Akram Afif's in-swinging free-kick.On 74 minutes, the hosts doubled their lead, this time Pedro Miguel making the most of a mistake by UAE goalkeeper Khalid Essa to nod into the empty net.Coached by former Spain, Real Madrid and West Ham boss Julen Lopetegui, Qatar had to survive Tarek Salman's sending-off late on for a studs-up tackle, while the UAE were provided a lifeline from substitute Sultan Adil's volley eight minutes into injury-time.To their credit, though, Qatar held on to take their place at a first World Cup on foreign soil.In Group B, Saudi Arabia made it through to a third successive finals by avoiding defeat to Iraq at their King Abdullah Sports City.The 2034 hosts, who recorded a stunning victory against eventual winners Argentina at the 2022 World Cup, needed only a draw to seal a berth at a seventh showpiece event.Herve Renard's side could have had taken the lead two minutes into the second half, but Lens full-back Saud Abdulhamid sent his effort over the Iraq crossbar with the goal at his mercy.Moments later, Al Ahli midfielder Saleh Abu Al Shamat forced a fine save from range from Jalal Hassan, while the Iraq goalkeeper soon thwarted both Saudi captain Salem Al Dawsari and namesake Nasser Al Dawsari.It took a save from goalkeeper Nawaf Al Aqidi deep into injury-time to ignite celebrations among the 60,000-plus crowd in Jeddah, but Saudi had done it.Iraq, last participants in 1986, remain in the hunt for the World Cup: next month, they contest a two-legged tie against the UAE, with the winner then going into an intercontinental playoff.","South Africa, Ivory Coast and Senegal all won convincingly on Tuesday to fill the last three automatic places reserved for Africa at the 2026 World Cup.

India fail to qualify for 2027 AFC Asian Cup after 1-2 loss to Singapore,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/india-fail-to-qualify-for-2027-afc-asian-cup-after-1-2-loss-to-singapore/articleshow/124566924.cms,"A dejected Sahal Abdul Samad (in blue) after India lost to Singapore in their Asian Cup qualifier in Fatorda, Goa. (Times of India)

India failed to qualify for the 2027 AFC Asian Cup after going down 1-2 to Singapore who rallied to humble the hosts with a brace from Korea-born attacking mid-fielder Song Ui-young in the third round qualification match here on Tuesday.Lallianzuala Chhangte's 14th minute strike was cancelled out by Song's equalizer in the 44th minute, and then he struck what proved to be the winner, in the 58th minute as India were left to rue many missed chances.The two teams were locked 1-1 at the half-time break at the Jawahar Lal Nehru Stadium, having played a 1-1 stalemate in the first leg in Singapore on October 9.In the day's other Group C match, Hong Kong and Bangladesh shared the spoils after a 1-1 draw in Hong Kong, a result that did not help India's cause who entered the game with two points from three matches.India were the dominant team in the first half and enjoyed long spells of possession, and it was appropriate that the Blue Tigers scored the opening goal in front of a lively home crowd.Chhangte received the ball some distance away from the edge of the box and unleashed a screamer with his left foot that beat the Singapore goalkeeper on its way to the back of the net.However, Song had other ideas as he struck twice in ether side of the break to dash Indian hopes.Just before the interval, Singapore struck back against the run of play courtesy Song, who found space inside the Indian box and kept his composure to level the score at 1-1, the equaliser leaving the Indian players distraught for they were the ones dictating play for most parts of the first half.On resumption, the visitors looked much sharper and more confident thanks to that equaliser, and they were rewarded when Song capitalised on India's defensive lapse to slot the ball home from close range and put his side ahead 2-1.Desperate for an equaliser, India head coach Khalid Jamil made plenty of substitutions hoping to inject some pace and urgency, bringing Rahim Ali and Udanta Singh in place of Liston Colaco and Sunil Chhetri. But all these changes did not work as India ended on the wrong side of the result.Brandon Fernandes missed out on a great chance to restore parity for India on the 90th minute after excellent work from Udanta Singh and Rahul Bheke. He hit the ball wide with his weaker foot with the goal at his mercy.Only the group winner will qualify for the Asian Cup and Hong Kong and Singapore currently lead the table with eight points each.Coming into the game with just two points from three matches, India needed nothing less than a win to stay in contention for the top spot in the group.India also missed couple of chances in the first half, during a period of play when they were dominating the contest.Jamil attributed the defeat, and rightly so, to ""lack of concentration"" on part of the India players, who have endured another disappointing campaign.","Singapore beat India 1-2 in their Asian Cup qualifier in Fatorda, Goa.

England secured their spot in the 2026 World Cup with a commanding 5-0 victory over Latvia, while Portugal's qualification was delayed after a 2-2 draw with Hungary on Tuesday. The matches were marked by notable performances from Harry Kane and Cristiano Ronaldo , while pro-Palestinian demonstrations preceded Italy's crucial win against Israel.England maintained their perfect record in Group K, securing their sixth consecutive win in Riga. The victory gave them an unassailable seven-point lead at the top of the group with 18 points, confirming their World Cup qualification with two games remaining.Anthony Gordon initiated the scoring for England before Harry Kane added two goals, including a penalty, to make it 3-0 by halftime. Kane's performance continued his impressive run, bringing his total to 21 goals in 13 games this season for club and country.""It comes rarely that you qualify for a World Cup, so the mood is very, very good,"" said England manager Thomas Tuchel.The match concluded with an own goal by Maksims Tonisevs and a fifth goal from Eberechi Eze, cementing England's dominant performance.In Group F, Portugal's qualification celebrations were put on hold after a dramatic 2-2 draw with Hungary in Lisbon. Hungary took the lead through Attila Szalai's header before Ronaldo equalized and later scored again, extending his international scoring record to 143 goals in 225 appearances.Ronaldo's performance also earned him the record for most goals in World Cup qualifying with 41, surpassing Guatemala's Carlos Ruiz's previous record of 39. However, Hungary's Dominik Szoboszlai scored in injury time to secure the draw.Italy's match against Israel in Udine was preceded by protests, with pro-Palestinian demonstrators clashing with police while thousands peacefully marched through the city. The demonstrations were sparked by concerns over hosting the match amid Israel's military offensive in Gaza.The Azzurri secured a 3-0 victory in the Group I fixture, with Mateo Retegui scoring twice and Gianluca Mancini adding a third. The win ensures Italy will finish at least second in the group, positioning them three points behind leaders Norway with two games remaining.Spain continued their strong qualifying campaign in Group E, defeating Bulgaria 4-0 in Valladolid. Mikel Merino scored two headers, bringing his qualifying tally to six goals in four games, while an own goal by Atanas Chernev and a penalty from Mikel Oyarzabal completed the scoring.""We don't have much further to go to get to the World Cup, but it's not done yet... I hope we keep winning,"" Merino stated after the match.In other matches, Serbia overcame an early setback to defeat Andorra 3-1, keeping them one point behind Albania in Group K.

Khalid Jamil promises 'attacking mode' as India take on Singapore in AFC Asian Cup 2027 qualifiers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/khalid-jamil-promises-attacking-mode-as-india-take-on-singapore-in-afc-asian-cup-2027-qualifiers/articleshow/124546071.cms,"Indian football team (X)

Margao:

At the pre-match media interaction, India coach Khalid Jamil used the word “positive” five times, not surprising given his known approach to games. But, quite uncharacteristically, he referenced activating an “attacking mode” right from the start three times.That’s probably the biggest cue of what to expect from India when they face Singapore in a must-win game of the AFC Asian Cup 2027 final round qualifiers at the Nehru Stadium, Fatorda, on Tuesday.India drew 1-1 against Singapore with a last-gasp goal away last week. With five points between Jamil’s side and leaders Hong Kong in the group at the halfway stage, the hosts are left with no option but to attack.“It’s our home game. We have to be in an attacking mode from the start,” Jamil said while responding to a query from TOI during the pre-match media interaction. Against Singapore last week, India fought bravely for a 1-1 draw, despite Sandesh Jhingan being sent off two minutes into the second half.Jamil now wants his side to carry the same spirit forward as the teams face off again in Goa. The last time Singapore played here in 2004, they lost by a solitary goal.India started their campaign with a goalless draw against Bangladesh at home in March and then suffered a 0-1 loss against Hong Kong, both under Manolo Marquez.Last week’s draw means India have two points, with Hong Kong (7) on top and Singapore next on five.With Jhingan suspended, Jamil had to summon left-back Subhasish Bose to fill the void in defence, while Lalengmawia Ralte (Apuia) has been drafted in place of Macarton Nickson, who was handed his national team debut just last week. Both were left out for the away clash.“We required them, especially Subhasish, because we don’t have an extra left-back. Sandesh is out and Apuia I think deserves to be back again because of his experience. I have seen his (recent) game and he was good, so we thought this is the right time to use the players,” said Jamil.Only the top team qualifies for Saudi Arabia 2027, so it won’t be easy for India, who need to win all their remaining three games to give themselves a chance of qualifying. If they turn it around, it will be for a record three editions in a row.Singapore are also chasing their own piece of history, having never played at the AFC Asian Cup before. They were on course for three points after a dominating performance at home against India, only to shoot themselves in the foot in the final minute of regulation time.","India face Singapore in a must-win game of the AFC Asian Cup 2027 final round qualifiers at the Nehru Stadium, Fatorda, on Tuesday.

Switzerland forced to wait

Injury-hit France were held to a 2-2 draw by Iceland in 2026 World Cup qualifying on Monday, while Germany won in Northern Ireland with a Nick Woltemade goal and Belgium beat Wales to stand on the brink of a place at next year's finals.France, World Cup winners in 2018 and runners-up in 2022, were without a host of players in Reykjavik including captain Kylian Mbappe and Ballon d'Or winner Ousmane Dembele, both out injured.They fell behind to a Victor Palsson goal late in the first half, but Christopher Nkunku equalised just after the hour mark.Crystal Palace striker Jean-Philippe Mateta then gave Les Bleus the lead midway through the second half, getting his first senior international goal on his first start.However, Iceland were back level almost from the restart as Kristian Hlynsson of FC Twente ran through unchallenged to make it 2-2.France could have clinched qualification for next year's tournament in North America with a win in Reykjavik combined with Ukraine failing to beat Azerbaijan at the same time.But while they were dropping points, Ukraine were beating Azerbaijan 2-1 in the Polish city of Krakow -- Oleksiy Hutsuliak and Ruslan Malinovskiy scored for Ukraine either side of a Vitaliy Mykolenko own goal.France are nevertheless three points clear at the top of Group D with two games remaining next month, and a win at home to second-placed Ukraine in Paris will wrap up top spot.""We totally controlled the game. Iceland had two shots on target and scored two goals,"" France coach Didier Deschamps told TFI.""But we have another point on the board and next month will be decisive.""Germany have now recorded three consecutive victories in Group A after beginning their campaign with a defeat in Slovakia last month.Newcastle United forward Woltemade headed in the only goal of the game as Germany beat Northern Ireland 1-0 in Belfast, and Julian Nagelsmann's team are top of the group with nine points.""It was a very important three points for us,"" Woltemade told Germany's RTL, adding that ""in this atmosphere and in a bit of an ugly game, you have to win and we did well"".Slovakia sit second only on goal difference as they defeated Luxembourg 2-0 at home, Adam Obert and Ivan Schranz scoring the goals in the second half.The 12 group winners in European qualifying will go to the World Cup, with runners-up continuing on to play-offs set for next March -- the meeting between Germany and Slovakia in Leipzig next month will therefore be decisive.Belgium have almost qualified from Group J after Kevin De Bruyne converted two penalties in a 4-2 win over Wales in Cardiff.Joe Rodon had given Wales an early lead but De Bruyne's spot-kick double came either side of a Thomas Meunier goal.Nathan Broadhead pulled it back to 3-2, only for Leandro Trossard of Arsenal to seal Belgium's victory at the death.Rudi Garcia's Red Devils -- who beat Wales 4-3 at home in June -- now know one win from their two games next month away to Kazakhstan and at home to Liechtenstein will clinch top spot.Meanwhile, Wales must try to catch second-placed North Macedonia, who were held 1-1 at home by Kazakhstan on Monday with Enis Bardhi replying for the hosts after Dinmukhamed Karaman's opener.Switzerland could have qualified from Group B with the right combination of results, but will have to wait until next month after a 0-0 draw in Slovenia.The Swiss are now only three points clear of Kosovo, who beat Sweden 1-0 in Gothenburg thanks to a solitary strike by Fisnik Asllani of Hoffenheim.Sweden's campaign has proven to be a disaster as they sit bottom of the section with just one point despite having Viktor Gyokeres and Alexander Isak starting together up front -- they have failed to even score in their last three matches.",France held to a 2-2 draw by Iceland in 2026 World Cup qualifying.

Cape Verde, a small island nation of 550,000 people, made history on Monday by qualifying for their first-ever FIFA World Cup . They defeated Eswatini 3-0 in Praia to secure their spot in the 2026 tournament, becoming the second-smallest country after Iceland to reach the World Cup finals.The Blue Sharks dominated Group D with 23 points, finishing ahead of eight-time World Cup participants Cameroon. Goals from Dailon Livramento, Willy Semedo, and Stopira in the second half sparked wild celebrations across the capital city Praia.""Giving this happiness to these people is enormous... it's a victory for all the Cape Verdean people and, above all, a victory for those who fought for our independence,"" said coach Pedro Brito, known as Bubista, highlighting the achievement's significance during the country's 50th independence anniversary.The victory triggered a carnival-like atmosphere in Praia. Fans poured onto the streets, honking horns and setting off fireworks. Local reggae and funana music filled the air as people danced in celebration.The team's success is remarkable given their rocky start to the campaign. After drawing with Angola and losing to Cameroon, they won five straight matches to secure qualification. The Blue Sharks rely heavily on players born outside the country to Cape Verdean parents or grandparents.Emotional captain Ryan Mendes said: ""Honestly, I don't have the words to describe this moment. I'm very, very happy."" Veteran goalkeeper Vozinha, 39, added: ""I have been dreaming of this moment since I was a child. It's time to celebrate.""FIFA President Gianni Infantino praised the historic achievement, saying it would likely ""power a new generation of football lovers"" across the nation.Cape Verde join Algeria, Egypt, Morocco, Tunisia, and Ghana as the six African teams that have already qualified for the 2026 World Cup, to be held in the United States, Canada, and Mexico.The triumph is particularly meaningful for this former Portuguese colony, which gained independence in 1975 and first attempted World Cup qualification in 2002. The team has shown steady progress, reaching the Africa Cup of Nations quarter-finals in both 2013 and 2023.","Cape Verde become second-smallest country after Iceland to reach World Cup finals.

Nas prioritizes artistry over spectacle



Looking ahead: Bad Bunny headlines Super Bowl LX halftime show



Nasir Jones, famously known as Nas , has made it clear he won’t be taking the Super Bowl Halftime Show stage anytime soon. During a recent interview with Complex, the 52-year-old hip-hop icon described the event as ""super rockstar shit"" but insisted it’s not for him. “Nah, I don't want to do ... I can't say I don't want to do the Super Bowl, but I don't,"" Nas said. ""Why would I do that? Leave it to the professionals. Leave it to the pros. I'm a pro at what I do."" He added that he prefers to watch the amazing halftime shows being delivered these days, giving respect to those who take on the spectacle.For decades, Nas has built a reputation as one of hip-hop’s most respected lyricists, focusing on storytelling and artistry rather than flashy performances. While the Super Bowl Halftime Show is one of the most high-profile stages in music, Nas values his craft and prefers staying true to his approach. He believes the show’s spectacle is better left to artists who thrive in that environment, while he enjoys the performances as a fan.Recent halftime shows have been nothing short of visually stunning and culturally impactful. Stars like Rihanna, Travis Scott, and Shakira have raised the bar with performances that blend music, choreography, and cutting-edge production.Nas seems content to watch these moments unfold from the audience, appreciating the artistry without feeling the need to be center stage.The next Super Bowl Halftime Show promises to be historic. Bad Bunny, the Puerto Rican singer and rapper, will headline Super Bowl LX on February 8, 2026, at Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara, California. He will become the first primarily Spanish-language artist to headline the event solo, following his 2020 performance alongside Shakira and Jennifer Lopez.Bad Bunny has achieved global fame with hits like “Diles” and his groundbreaking album El Último Tour Del Mundo, the first all-Spanish album to top the Billboard 200. Fans can catch the Super Bowl at 6:30 p.m. CST on NBC, with streaming available via Peacock. For Des Moines residents, NBC affiliate WHO 13 will broadcast the game.While Nas steps aside, leaving the Halftime Show to others, his influence on hip-hop and music remains unquestioned, proving that true artistry doesn’t always need the brightest stage lights to shine.Also Read: “Something’s wrong with him”: Stephen A.

NFL upholds Brian Branch’s suspension after calling his act a violation of league conduct rules

Brian Branch apologizes for postgame behavior and reflects on missed calls during game

The Detroit Lions are going into an important NFC game missing one of their key defensive players. Safety Brian Branch’s suspension has been confirmed after his on-field incident caught everyone’s attention. The NFL labeled his behavior as ""aggressive"" and unacceptable, but Branch claims there’s more to the situation as tensions flared in Kansas City.On Tuesday, October 14, 2025, the NFL swiftly imposed a one-game suspension without pay on Branch, citing his ""aggressive, non-football act"" as inappropriate and a breach of the league's conduct and sportsmanship guidelines.In a letter from Jon Runyan, the NFL's Vice President of Football Operations, the league pointed out that Branch's slap ""posed a serious risk of injury"" and ""reflected poorly on the NFL."" This is just the latest in a string of disciplinary problems for the third-year safety, who has been fined 10 times since the beginning of the 2024 season adding up to over $111,000 in lost wages—including three fines this year alone for unsportsmanlike conduct or unnecessary roughness.One previous incident involved Branch hitting Arizona Cardinals tight end Trey McBride in the face after a field goal attempt last season.Branch contested the suspension on the same day it was made public. The appeal hearing was held virtually and led by Jordy Nelson, who acts as an impartial judge because of his post-retirement role in NFL disciplinary matters.Nelson's ruling to uphold the suspension was announced on Wednesday evening by Michael Signora, the NFL's senior vice president of football and international communications, leaving Branch unable to participate in the Buccaneers game and resulting in a loss of $76,625 in game-day pay.Detroit Lions head coach Dan Campbell spoke about the incident right after the game during his post-game press conference at Arrowhead Stadium. He called Branch's actions ""inexcusable"" and apologized to the Chiefs organization, coach Andy Reid, and Smith-Schuster directly.""He knows it. Our team knows it. So, that’s not what we do,"" Campbell told reporters. He emphasized that such actions have no place in the sport, drawing an analogy to road rage: ""Look, this is one instance of something that happened. It doesn’t matter what led to it... You can’t cross that line. Our players know that. Brian knows it.""During Tuesday's team practice, Campbell adjusted his tone but still held everyone accountable, chatting with reporters at the Lions' Allen Park facility. ""He’s an outstanding young man, he really is. He’s got a big heart, and he made a mistake. He’ll learn from it,"" the coach said, defending Branch's character despite the lapse in judgment.Branch echoed this remorse in the locker room immediately after the game, telling beat writers his decision was ""childish."" ""I did a little childish thing, but I’m tired of people doing stuff in between the play and refs don’t catch it"".He acknowledged his annoyance once more regarding the unneeded block. No public remarks from Smith-Schuster or Chiefs coach Andy Reid were available right after the appeal decision, although Reid had accepted Campbell's apology on the field Sunday night.Also Read: Taylor Swift stops everything to interact with young Travis Kelce fan at Kansas City Chiefs game","NFL upholds Brian Branch’s suspension after calling his act a violation of league conduct rules.

Travis Hunter’s baptism story before the game takes an unexpected turn after one reporter’s bold question



Travis Hunter’s new chapter beyond football



It was more than just another Sunday for Jacksonville Jaguars rookie Travis Hunter. Before taking the field against the Seattle Seahawks, the 22-year-old star made a life-changing decision—he got baptized. The ceremony, held at Celebration Church in Jacksonville, became a deeply personal milestone that spoke volumes about Hunter’s journey of faith, transformation, and purpose beyond football.A video captured by a churchgoer quickly spread across social media, showing Hunter’s baptism led by pastor Tim Timberlake. For many, it was striking to see a professional athlete prioritize his spiritual life just hours before stepping into an NFL matchup. But for Hunter, the decision had been a long time coming.“It’s a crazy question. Why did I get baptized? It’s Sunday, it’s God’s day, and I’ve been planning to get baptized for a minute,” Hunter told reporters after the game. “I want to change my life, I want to become a better man.”Those weren’t just words—they were a declaration. Hunter, who played under Deion Sanders at both Jackson State and Colorado, has long been open about his faith and personal growth.Sanders’ mentorship clearly continues to guide him, not only as an athlete but as a man striving to live with integrity and humility.The young star described his baptism as a symbolic rebirth. “It means a lot, you know, becoming a better man, leaving my old flesh and just becoming the new Travis,” he said, reflecting on the meaning behind the moment.Hunter’s wife, Leanna Lenne, celebrated his decision in a heartfelt comment online: “A huge party is going on in heaven, celebrating your decision. THIS is your greatest achievement to me.” The couple, who married earlier this year and welcomed their first child in August, continues to inspire fans with their grounded and faith-centered relationship.Hunter’s journey tells us that personal victories sometimes outshine professional ones. While his stats—20 receptions and nearly 200 yards this season—speak of his athletic promise, his baptism marks a more profound win. As pastor Timberlake put it, “Love you!! This right here is what winning at what matters most looks like.”In a world where fame often overshadows faith, Travis Hunter’s story stands out—a young man determined not just to play the game, but to live it with purpose.Also Read: “Something’s wrong with him”: Stephen A.

Stephen A. Smith questions if Cowboys owner has lost his mind



Cowboys fans share Smith’s frustration



Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones just turned 83, but it’s not his birthday that’s got everyone talking. Jones, known for decades of bold yet baffling remarks, once again found himself under fire — this time from ESPN’s Stephen A. Smith, who questioned whether the longtime Cowboys boss has lost touch with reality after his latest comments about the team’s defense.The Cowboys’ 2-3-1 start to the season has raised plenty of concerns, but the biggest head-scratcher came from Jones himself. Despite the defense ranking among the worst in the league, the team owner confidently declared, “Where we are potentially our strongest is pass rush.”Those words stunned fans, especially considering that Dallas traded away star pass rusher Micah Parsons to the Green Bay Packers after refusing to negotiate a new deal. Since then, the Cowboys have allowed the most passing yards and are tied for the most passing touchdowns in the NFL . Yet, Jones seems convinced that the defensive line remains the team’s greatest asset.Smith didn’t hold back his disbelief during ESPN’s First Take, where he wished Jones a happy birthday before bluntly adding, “Something’s wrong with him.”“This man will double down with the best of them,” Smith said. “You traded Micah Parsons. Clearly it was not the wisest thing to do. Of course it was going to compromise your pass rush... Total yards — dead last. Scoring — 31st. Passing yards — dead last. Third downs — dead last.The only thing you’re decent at is against the rush, and that’s not decent because you’re 25th.”For many fans, Smith only said what they’ve been thinking for weeks. The Cowboys’ defensive collapse has been glaring, and Jones’ refusal to acknowledge the issue feels like denial. His unwavering confidence might once have been endearing, but now it’s being seen as stubbornness that hurts the franchise.Smith even revealed he has expressed his concern directly to Jones, saying he’s “worried about him.” It’s not the first time the outspoken analyst has gone after the Cowboys owner, but his comments this time hit differently — because, for once, much of the NFL world seems to agree.At 83, Jerry Jones remains one of the most powerful figures in football. But as Stephen A. Smith made clear, power doesn’t always mean perspective — and Cowboys fans are left wondering when reality will catch up in Dallas.Also Read: ""I made a mistake"": Tua Tagovailoa tries to mend fences with emotional apology — but questions remain inside Dolphins camp","ESPN's Stephen A.

Tua Tagovailoa’s emotional comments spark controversy



Owning the moment and learning as a leader



The Miami Dolphins’ season has spiraled into frustration, and quarterback Tua Tagovailoa found himself at the center of a storm this week. Following Miami’s 29-27 loss to the Los Angeles Chargers, Tagovailoa’s emotions spilled over as he openly criticized some teammates for lack of discipline and accountability — comments that sparked a wave of controversy within the locker room and beyond.After the disappointing loss, Tagovailoa didn’t hold back. “I think it starts with the leadership and helping articulate that for the guys and what we’re expecting out of the guys,” he said. “We have guys showing up to player-only meetings late; guys not showing up to player-only meetings. There’s a lot that goes into that… It’s a lot of that nature that we have to get cleaned up.”The remarks hit a nerve. Fans and analysts quickly questioned whether Tagovailoa had broken the unspoken rule of keeping locker-room matters private. Head coach Mike McDaniel subtly agreed, noting that the postgame setting “was not the forum” for airing such frustrations.But within days, Tagovailoa stepped forward to take full responsibility for his words. Opening his weekly media session unprompted, he said, “I, as a leader of this team, the comments that had been said, I would say I’ve made a mistake, and I’m owning up to that right now.” He explained that he had since spoken with teammates and team leaders to clarify his intentions.“They know my heart, they know the intent was right,” he added.For Tagovailoa, this episode became a lesson in leadership and restraint. “I felt like I let the emotions get to me after the game, and that’s something that I can learn from as a leader on this team,” he admitted. “What happens in-house should be protected, and none of that should’ve gotten out. I want to publicly apologize about that.”Despite the controversy, Tagovailoa’s accountability resonated with some teammates. Linebacker Jaelan Phillips defended him, saying, “I know Tua’s heart. If he did say anything, it was under good intentions. I don’t think he’s trying to call anyone out in particular other than we’re holding each other accountable.”At 1-5, Miami’s season has reached a critical point, and so has its leadership test. Tagovailoa’s words — both the emotional ones and the reflective ones — may ultimately shape how the Dolphins regroup from here. For now, his public apology stands as both a humbling moment and a reminder that even leaders learn through missteps.Also Read: Rams get unexpected help from MLB’s Baltimore Orioles ahead of crucial Week 7 London showdown — Here's how",Miami Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa apologized for his comments after a loss to the Chargers.

Keanu Reeves reveals painful injury that left Jason and Travis Kelce stunned

Comedy proves tougher than action for the Hollywood icon

Every Chief's Gotta Eat, NFL Meatheads & Keanu Reeves on Comedy Dangers, Life Advice & More | EP 160

Keanu Reeves is known for enduring bone-crunching stunts in action blockbusters like John Wick and The Matrix, but his worst on-set injury surprisingly came during a comedy. The 61-year-old actor revealed that he suffered a painful and rare “vertical kneecap break” while filming his new film Good Fortune, directed by Aziz Ansari.During an appearance on New Heights, the popular podcast hosted by NFL brothers Jason and Travis Kelce, Reeves opened up about the freak accident that occurred off-camera. “I was doing a scene, and I was going back to the dressing room, which was at a residence, and they had a carpet laid down to protect the owner’s carpet,” he explained. “And then there was a little section, and it caught my foot, and I started to fall, and then I spiked my left knee, and my left patella went like this. ”Using his hands to demonstrate, Reeves described how his kneecap “had a vertical break. It didn’t break the top or bottom.” Both Kelce brothers were visibly shocked, with Travis blurting out, “A vertical break? I’ve never heard of this!” Reeves calmly added that it was “better than suffering a horizontal break,” prompting Jason to reply, “Well, that’s good. At least it’s better than a horizontal, but that still sounds pretty messed up.Despite the intense pain, Reeves refused to stop filming. “Until they pulled the blood out of the capsule, the pain was banana cakes,” he admitted, using his trademark humor to lighten the story.Reeves didn’t need surgery, opting to wear a brace while continuing to shoot Good Fortune, in which he plays an unlucky angel who loses his wings and must navigate life as a human. “Anyway, so comedy is hard,” he joked, earning laughs from the Kelce brothers.The film, also starring Seth Rogen, Keke Palmer, and Sandra Oh, hits theaters on October 17. For fans, Reeves’ revelation is a reminder of his dedication, even when the genre shifts from gunfights to punchlines, the actor’s commitment never wavers.Also Read: “Collecting A-list actors like Pokémon”: Fans go wild as Travis and Jason Kelce announce Keanu Reeves as next guest on ‘New Heights’ podcast","Hollywood star Keanu Reeves sustained a rare vertical kneecap break during filming of the comedy ""Good Fortune"" The accident occurred off-camera when his foot caught on a carpet.

"Molly Qerim opens up about her future plans after ‘First Take’ exit, but keeps details under wraps",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/molly-qerim-opens-up-about-her-future-plans-after-first-take-exit-but-keeps-details-under-wraps/articleshow/124592795.cms,"Molly Qerim teases fans with vague update on what’s next after shocking ‘First Take’ departure (Instagram)

Molly Qerim hints at new beginnings after ESPN exit, but refuses to reveal her next project



Why Molly Qerim really left ESPN, according to insiders



It’s been a month since Molly Qerim said goodbye to ESPN and First Take, ending a 19-year journey that made her one of sports television’s most familiar faces. The Emmy-winning host’s departure came as a shock to fans who had grown used to seeing her mediate fiery debates between Stephen A. Smith and his guests each morning. Yet, despite the speculation swirling around her next move, Qerim has chosen silence—perhaps signaling a time of reflection before her next act.In her heartfelt farewell, Qerim wrote, “To my First Take family, after much reflection, I’ve decided it’s time to close this incredible chapter and step away from First Take. Hosting this show has been one of the great honors of my career.”Since then, the 41-year-old has largely stepped out of the spotlight. Her social media has been unusually quiet, aside from one stylish appearance after leaving the network. Interestingly, her Instagram bio still reads “Host of First Take on ESPN,” hinting that she hasn’t yet secured a new role. The quote on her profile, “Let no one come to you without leaving better & happier,” from Mother Teresa, feels almost poetic—reflecting the bittersweet nature of her exit.After nearly two decades of nonstop television, it’s possible Qerim is taking time to recharge and redefine her career path. Her professionalism, poise, and warmth have made her one of the most respected figures in sports media, so whatever comes next is sure to draw attention.Veteran broadcaster Chris “Mad Dog” Russo believes Qerim’s departure may not have been entirely voluntary. Speaking on the SI Media Podcast, Russo claimed she likely left because she felt “embarrassed” by ESPN’s plans to move her from First Take. “They probably wanted to move her around a little bit and try something different,” he said. “If I’m not going to do First Take, I don’t want to do SportsCenter. She probably felt that would be a demotion. ”Adding to the speculation, former ESPN star Marcellus Wiley revealed that Qerim was earning around $500,000 per year—significantly less than her co-host Stephen A. Smith, whose contract reportedly pays him $20 million annually. Wiley suggested she felt “disrespected” by the pay gap and frustrated by ESPN’s reluctance to give her her own show.ESPN’s President of Content, Burke Magnus, later confirmed that renewal talks had stalled, but praised Qerim as “a wonderful person and an unbelievable teammate,” adding that after ten years, “she wanted to do other things.”Whatever the reason behind her exit, one thing remains certain: Molly Qerim’s story in sports broadcasting is far from over. Her next chapter—whenever it begins—is one fans will be watching closely.Also Read: Rams get unexpected help from MLB’s Baltimore Orioles ahead of crucial Week 7 London showdown — Here's how","Molly Qerim left ESPN and First Take last month after 19 years.

"Bills fans unleash fury, accuse Josh Allen of losing his focus after marrying Hailee Steinfeld",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/bills-fans-unleash-fury-accuse-josh-allen-of-losing-his-focus-after-marrying-hailee-steinfeld/articleshow/124592374.cms,"Josh Allen's comments about his relationship with Hailee Steinfeld have sparked debate, with some fans attributing the Bills' recent losses to his perceived softening. Despite these claims, Allen's statistics remain strong, and the ""Hailee effect"" is largely seen as a narrative driven by fan impatience rather than a true distraction for the quarterback.

When a heartfelt moment turns into controversy

Stats tell a different story as Bills search for answers

The “Hailee effect” is more myth than reality

Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen has unintentionally become the center of one of the NFL ’s most unusual debates and it has nothing to do with his arm strength or game plan. Following a candid interview with ESPN’s Marty Smith ahead of the Bills’ Monday Night Football loss to the Atlanta Falcons, Allen’s comments about his wife, actress and singer Hailee Steinfeld , have ignited a firestorm among fans and pundits.During the interview, Allen was asked what he has learned from his relationship with Steinfeld. His reply was calm and reflective: “Maybe that I am more than a football player,” he said. “My whole dream as a kid was to be in this position, but there is life after it as well.”Those words meant to show maturity and balance, quickly became the subject of heated debate online. With the Bills now on a two-game losing streak, some frustrated fans have suggested that marriage has softened their star quarterback, claiming he has “lost his edge.” Others argue the criticism is baseless, pointing out that Allen remains one of the NFL’s most competitive and productive players this season.Despite Buffalo’s recent struggles, Allen’s numbers tell a more complex story. He’s completing nearly 69 percent of his passes for 1,397 yards and 11 touchdowns, while adding three more scores on the ground. However, his performance against Atlanta, two interceptions and four sacks has added fuel to critics questioning his rhythm and decision-making.Head coach Sean McDermott has brushed off the personal-life chatter, saying the team needs to “get back to basics” after back-to-back losses. Analysts have echoed that sentiment, noting that Buffalo’s offensive line woes and inconsistent play-calling have been far more damaging than Allen’s marriage.In truth, the so-called “Hailee effect” says more about fan impatience than Allen’s mindset. The quarterback’s focus, leadership, and competitiveness remain unquestioned by those inside the locker room. What’s changed is the narrative, an offhand comment becoming tabloid fodder during a tough stretch.Also Read: “Collecting A-list actors like Pokémon”: Fans go wild as Travis and Jason Kelce announce Keanu Reeves as next guest on ‘New Heights’ podcast As the Bills prepare for Week 7, the real test for Allen isn’t his marriage, it’s silencing the noise with a statement performance.

Rams practice at Camden Yards before London trip



Sean McVay grateful for Orioles’ hospitality



The Los Angeles Rams found an unlikely ally in Major League Baseball as they prepared for their Week 7 clash against the Jacksonville Jaguars in London. Instead of returning to California after defeating the Ravens in Baltimore, the Rams stayed behind and turned Camden Yards — home of the Orioles — into their temporary practice ground.On Wednesday, the usually baseball-only field at Camden Yards transformed into a makeshift football facility. The setup wasn’t quite what the Rams are used to, but it worked. The grounds featured two smaller fields — one 25 yards and another 60 — laid out across the outfield near the infield. Even uprights were installed so the special teams could run through their drills.Players like Davante Adams and his teammates took the change in stride, enjoying the novelty of running routes in a baseball park. It wasn’t the sprawling turf of SoFi Stadium, but the experience added an element of fun and focus before the long flight across the Atlantic.The Maryland Stadium Authority, which oversees both Oriole Park and nearby M&T Bank Stadium, approved the Rams’ use of the facility earlier this month. The Rams are covering the operating expenses for the week and plan to continue practicing at Camden Yards through Friday before departing for London.Head coach Sean McVay made sure to express his gratitude for the Orioles’ gesture. “Just want to thank the Baltimore Orioles,” McVay said. “What an amazing opportunity, and really, just how gracious they've been to offer up the opportunity to be able to use their facilities. And it's a really cool thing for our players, and hopefully it's going to lead to a great week of preparation. Had a good walkthrough, looking forward to having a good practice. So, very grateful for them.”For the Rams, this collaboration made logistical sense — saving time, easing travel fatigue, and allowing uninterrupted preparation before facing the Jaguars at Wembley Stadium. The two teams will kick off their international matchup on Sunday at 9:30 a.m. ET, with Los Angeles hoping their unique week of training pays off on the London stage.Also Read: Madison Beer steals the spotlight with sultry look at Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show as romance with Justin Herbert heats up",Rams practice at Orioles' Camden Yards ahead of London trip.

Amen Thompson and Jose Alvarado throw hands during a NBA pre-season game

The NBA world has often seen tensions explode between players during matches. In all those instances, things often get out of hand and lead to physical scuffles between two stars on the court. A similar incident took place during a recent pre-season match between popular NBA stars, Amen Thompson and Jose Alvarado, which made headlines and garnered significant attention from NBA fans.The New Orleans Pelicans squared off against the Houston Rockets at the Legacy Arena in Birmingham, Alabama, in a preseason match. The fast-paced action took a drastic turn when the two guards for their respective teams got into an altercation on the court. During the second quarter of the match, a moment saw Jose Alvarado lose his balance during a rebound attempt and grab Amen Thompson's jersey to break his fall.The Rockets player tried to shove him off, but the Pelicans star kept pushing away, which led him to collapse and drew the ire of Thompson. As soon as that happened, he got back up on his feet and shoved Alvarado back before a scuffle broke out between the duo for a couple of seconds.However, before things could get out of hand, their teammates intervened to break things up.Due to the altercation, Alvarado was slapped with a technical foul, and Thompson received a flagrant 1 for their actions. However, neither man left the arena with a bad taste in their mouth. At the end of the game, Alvarado and Thompson shook hands and hugged to bury the hatchet and make peace with each other. Moreover, it is expected that things will remain cordial between the two NBA players with a new season on the horizon, and their respective teams will square off several times, starting with their first match on December 18.In regard to the outcome of the match, the Houston Rockets defeated the New Orleans Pelicans with the final score being 130-128. The match saw splendid performances by players like Trey Murphy III, Zion Williamson, and Yves Missi. While the game did not count for any major outcome, it has possibly set the tone for the upcoming season for both teams.Also read: “That’s the truth” — Patrick Beverley slams Los Angeles Lakers for unfairly destroying Russell Westbrook’","Amen Thompson and Jose Alvarado got into a scuffle during a pre-season match.

Sacramento Kings invest in Keegan Murray’s long-term future



Injury setback won’t derail Murray’s impact in Sacramento



The Sacramento Kings have made a clear statement about their future, locking in forward Keegan Murray with a lucrative five-year, $140 million contract extension that will keep him in Sacramento through the 2030–31 season. The deal, confirmed by multiple outlets including ESPN’s Shams Charania, reflects the franchise’s long-term commitment to building around their homegrown talent, even as Murray recovers from a significant thumb injury that will sideline him to start the 2025–26 campaign.Keegan Murray’s extension arrives at a pivotal moment for Sacramento. The 25-year-old forward, selected fourth overall in the 2022 NBA Draft, has evolved into one of the Sacramento Kings’ most versatile two-way players. Despite undergoing surgery to repair a torn ulnar collateral ligament in his left thumb, the Kings showed no hesitation in finalizing the deal before the rookie extension deadline.This contract marks a major milestone for Murray, who has been a model of consistency since entering the league. He’s played in 233 of a possible 246 games over three seasons, starting nearly all of them. His defensive instincts and ability to stretch the floor with his shooting make him an indispensable part of the Kings’ system.Over his career, Murray has averaged 13.3 points, 5.6 rebounds, and 1.4 assists per game, while shooting an efficient 37% from beyond the arc.The Kings believe the $140 million investment will pay off, especially as the roster continues to evolve. With Russell Westbrook joining on a one-year, $3.6 million deal, Sacramento appears intent on balancing veteran experience with youthful energy heading into a crucial season.Murray’s left thumb injury — a torn UCL suffered during a preseason game — will likely keep him out for four to six weeks. “It probably takes three to six months for the ligament to repair or for the injury to fully heal,” said Dr. Amy Ladd of Stanford University (via NBC Sports California), cautioning that his recovery may extend into the early season.Still, Sacramento’s front office made clear that Murray’s value transcends short-term availability. He remains one of the team’s most trusted perimeter defenders and a proven shooter, joining an elite group of players — including Anthony Edwards and Derrick White — to record 500 threes, 150 steals, and 150 blocks over the past three seasons.With Doug Christie now officially at the helm as head coach, the Kings are banking on Murray’s leadership and defensive versatility to anchor a deeper playoff run.Also Read: What did Kendrick Perkins say about LeBron James?

The 2025 NBA preseason hasn’t started on a good note for Los Angeles Lakers. With LeBron James taking a backseat due to sciatica and Luka Doncic taking the lead, the Lakers were expected to start with a great preseason game after they faltered during the 2024-25 NBA championship. Lakers’ coach JJ Redick did not hold back from expressing his frustration with the team’s embarrassing loss against Phoenix SunsLos Angeles Lakers coach JJ Redick is a man of few words.

Following the 113-104 loss against the Suns during the ongoing preseason, JJ Redick slammed the Lakers during the postgame press conference. He said,""It's very simple, actually: I'm trying to form consistent habits. So you're trying to do that; that means everybody. That doesn't mean three guys. You need everybody doing that. I thought there were some really good things tonight on both ends of the floor... But if you want to have a good time, you have to do it every single time. You have to do the right thing every single time.”The former Clippers star further pointed out the inconsistent performance of the Lakers. Redick mentioned,""That's where I don't think any of the groups tonight were as consistent as they need to be. To me, we took a step forward with some of the defensive stuff from the other night against Golden State. We took a step backwards tonight. That's a little bit frustrating.""This is not the first time JJ Redick has openly spoken about the Los Angeles Lakers’ performance.

Dallas Mavericks vs Los Angeles Lakers: Recent Form and Team Trends

Dallas Mavericks vs Los Angeles Lakers: Who Has the Edge?

The highly anticipated NBA preseason clash -matchup on October 15, 2025, in Las Vegas - promises an exciting look at both teams’ readiness before the regular season tips off. This comprehensive breakdown covers everything from betting odds and predictions to team records, form, prop bets, and performance analytics to help fans and bettors make informed choices.The Mavericks come into this final preseason matchup with a strong 2-1 record, showcasing steady chemistry and offensive cohesion. Meanwhile, the Lakers have faced challenges, sitting at 1-3 and entering the game on the second night of a back-to-back following a 113-104 loss to the Phoenix Suns.Oddsmakers have given the Mavericks a slight edge as -4.5 favorites (at -130 odds), with their moneyline set around -285. The Lakers, positioned as underdogs, are listed at +4.5 points (+115) and +225 on the moneyline. The over/under total sits near 219 points, suggesting expectations of a moderately high-scoring contest with fast-paced play from both sides.Prop bets for this matchup revolve around player production, scoring efficiency, and rotation depth. Given that the Lakers are expected to reintroduce several key players who sat out the previous night, certain player props may carry additional risk. Bettors should look closely at these prop bet opportunities:• Scoring totals for Mavericks’ shooters and rookies expected to log extended minutes.• Rebound and block totals for active Lakers frontcourt players like Rui Hachimura, Jarred Vanderbilt, and Jaxson Hayes.• Whether team total points exceed or fall below the 219-point line.Dallas coach Jason Kidd has suggested that starters including Klay Thompson, Cooper Flagg, Dereck Lively II, P.J. Washington, and Anthony Davis will see more floor time. This strategy points to a competitive outing from the Mavericks, making their player props and spread bets especially appealing. In contrast, the Lakers may restrict minutes for players who featured heavily in the previous night’s loss.Both teams have displayed distinct identities through the preseason:• Dallas Mavericks (2-1): Averaging around 114 points per game, the Mavericks have thrived on perimeter shooting and fluid offensive movement. However, their defense has occasionally faltered in transition and on fast breaks.• Los Angeles Lakers (1-3): Scoring roughly 103 to 104 points per game, the Lakers have relied on defensive toughness and veteran leadership but continue to struggle with offensive rhythm and outside shooting.Historically, the Mavericks hold a narrow edge in their overall head-to-head record at 27-22. Across these encounters, the average total score has hovered around 214 points. Notably, the Lakers have covered the spread in seven of their last eight meetings as underdogs, but this trend may be in jeopardy due to their current struggles and injury setbacks.• Mavericks: Dallas has found momentum with recent wins, including a confident performance against the Utah Jazz. Their 5-5 record in the last 10 games indicates inconsistency but forward progress overall.• Lakers: Los Angeles enters the game with only one victory in their last five outings, coupled with three consecutive defeats. The absence of LeBron James due to injury has significantly reduced their offensive punch.The back-to-back schedule and ongoing rotation management put the Lakers at a disadvantage. The Mavericks, benefiting from rest and a more consistent lineup, appear better prepared to close out their preseason on a high note.Taking into account form, lineup strategy, and injury concerns, the Dallas Mavericks are the logical pick to win this contest. Their combination of healthy starters, efficient scoring, and defensive balance positions them well against a Lakers squad still adjusting rotations and coping with player absences. Expect Dallas to cover the -4.5 spread and control the pace of play throughout the game.The Dallas Mavericks vs Los Angeles Lakers preseason matchup in Las Vegas offers fans and bettors a final look at two Western Conference contenders before the real competition begins. With the Mavericks entering in superior form and boasting a deeper, fresher lineup, they are favored both straight up and against the spread.For bettors, the optimal plays lie in taking the Mavericks to cover -4.5 and exploring prop bets involving their starters’ scoring and efficiency. The total line of 219 points presents a fair target, though Dallas’ offensive rhythm and the Lakers’ rotational fatigue could push the total slightly over.In the Dallas Mavericks vs Los Angeles Lakers game, while the Lakers bring experience and defensive grit, their inconsistency and ongoing injury issues tilt the advantage toward Dallas in this preseason finale. Beyond the box score, this matchup will serve as a valuable glimpse into emerging rotations, player chemistry, and early tactical adjustments that will shape the 2025–26 NBA season.","The Dallas Mavericks and Los Angeles Lakers meet in their final preseason game on October 15, 2025, in Las Vegas.

World No. 204 Valentin Vacherot from Monaco took the tennis world by storm on Saturday, defeating an ailing Novak Djokovic 6-3, 6-4 in the Shanghai Masters semi-finals. The 26-year-old qualifier overcame the 38-year-old Serbian, who struggled with vomiting, leg injuries, and fatigue under 31°C heat and 62 percent humidity, to book a spot in Sunday’s final against either his cousin Arthur Rinderknech or Daniil Medvedev.“I’m trying to pinch myself, is this real?” Vacherot said after his career-defining win. “To have Novak on the other side of the court was first of all an invaluable experience for me. I have a hundred feelings right now.”But who exactly is Valentin Vacherot? Tennis runs deep in his family. Born in 1998, he started playing at a young age and went on to play college tennis for Texas A&M University. Turning professional in 2022, he is coached by his half-brother Benjamin Balleret, who himself is the son of former players Bernard Balleret and Alexia Dechaume-Balleret. Tennis talent clearly runs in the family, as Vacherot’s cousin Arthur Rinderknech is also a former US Open pre-quarterfinalist.Vacherot first came into the spotlight by winning his maiden ATP Challenger title at the Nonthaburi Challenger in 2022. He made his Grand Slam debut last year at Roland Garros, becoming the first player from the Monegasque Tennis Federation to reach the main draw, though he lost in the first round to Alejandro Davidovich Fokina.Against Djokovic, Vacherot’s composure shone through. After Djokovic broke in the opening game, Vacherot immediately broke back. As Djokovic’s physical troubles worsened in the seventh game, requiring medical treatment and repeated stretches, Vacherot seized the moment, breaking again to take the first set with two aces. Despite a brief resistance from Djokovic in the second set, Vacherot held his nerve to serve out the match, denying Djokovic a chance at a fifth Shanghai Masters title.This remarkable victory cements Vacherot’s arrival on the big stage and marks a career-defining moment for the young Monegasque, whose journey from college tennis to shocking one of the sport’s greatest legends will be remembered for years to come.","Valentin Vacherot beats Novak Djokovic 6-3, 6-4 in the Shanghai Masters semi- finals.

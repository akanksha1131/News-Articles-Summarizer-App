Champions Trophy Squad: Chief selector Ajit Agarkar and skipper Rohit Sharma PC

NEW DELHI: BCCI chief selector Ajit Agarkar and captain Rohit Sharma addressed the media in Mumbai on Saturday to announce India’s squad for the ICC Champions Trophy 2025 . Among the key talking points was the omission of wicketkeeper-batter Sanju Samson from the team.Samson last represented India in the T20I series against South Africa in November last year, where he delivered two remarkable centuries. His exceptional form had sparked calls for his inclusion alongside KL Rahul and Rishabh Pant as a wicketkeeping option.However, Samson's absence from the Vijay Hazare Trophy , India’s premier 50-over domestic tournament, may have played a role in his exclusion from the Champions Trophy squad.Kerala Cricket Association (KCA) president Jayesh George criticised Samson for his approach, revealing that the batter had informed the association of his unavailability with just a 'one-line text'.Speaking about Samson’s absence, George said, “I am not sure if Samson missing the tournament was the reason he was excluded. The reason he was not added in the Vijay Hazare squad was because he sent a one-line text saying he would not be available for the 30-member preparatory camp. We were all of the impression that he would be leading the team since he is our white-ball captain and had led in the SMAT season as well.”“So we went ahead and announced the squad and later he sent a message stating he is available for selection. Be it Sanju Samson or any other player, KCA has a policy in place that needs to be respected. We all know that Sanju does not need a camp to come into the squad, but is the Kerala team one that he can come and represent only when he feels like? How did Samson reach the Indian team? It was only through the KCA. That doesn’t mean you turn up only when you feel like for the Kerala team,” George told MediaOne.Meanwhile, Samson has been named in the squad for the upcoming five-match T20I series against England, starting February 22. He is one of two wicketkeepers in the squad, alongside Dhruv Jurel.The series opener is scheduled for Wednesday at Eden Gardens in Kolkata.The second T20I will take place on January 25 at the MA Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai, followed by the third on January 28 at Niranjan Shah Stadium in Rajkot.The fourth game will be held on January 31 at the Maharashtra Cricket Association Stadium in Pune, with the fifth and final T20I slated for February 2 at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai.","Sanju Samson omitted from India's squad for ICC Champions Trophy 2025.

Champions Trophy Squad: Chief selector Ajit Agarkar and skipper Rohit Sharma PC

NEW DELHI: During a press conference in Mumbai on Saturday, India captain Rohit Sharma and men's selection committee chairman Ajit Agarkar announced the 15-member squad for the upcoming Champions Trophy . Prior to the start of the conference, cameras captured a private conversation between Rohit and Agarkar, which later went viral on social media.In the footage, Rohit can be heard discussing new guidelines with Agarkar, mentioning an upcoming meeting with the BCCI secretary. The conversation also highlighted players' concerns about the guidelines.[Now I will have to sit with the secretary to discuss family, family matters, everyone is telling me],"" Rohit was recorded saying to Agarkar in the viral video.A 10-point guideline was recently released following India's series defeat to Australia earlier this month.One of the key points of contention in the policy document is a return to the old system, where families are allowed to join players only for 14 days on long tours. Any deviation from this would require approval from coach Gambhir.When Rohit was asked about the new guidelines, he responded, ""Who told you about these rules? Has it come from the official handle of the BCCI? Let it come officially."" However, Agarkar confirmed that an SOP had indeed been drafted.Agarkar was asked why, just six months after winning the T20 World Cup with the same set of players, the BCCI felt the need to introduce a travel policy document. Agarkar, who was also part of the review committee that discussed the Australia debacle, said, ""We'll probably talk about it endlessly if we keep going on.""He continued, ""I suppose every team has some rules in place. We've spoken about various things you see over the last few months where you can improve as a team, where you can get a bit closer as a team. It's not a school. It's not a punishment,"" he explained, attempting to rationalize the decision.""It's just (that) you have some rules in place and when you're playing for the national team, you just follow those rules. Again, these are mature individuals. They are superstars in their own rights in international sport.""Many former players have described these rules as long-standing, with Agarkar calling them protocols that must be followed when representing the national team.","A 10-point guideline was recently released following India's series defeat to Australia earlier this month.

NEW DELHI: The wait is finally over. India men's senior selection committee chaired by Ajit Agarkar will pick India's provisional squad for the upcoming Champions Trophy tomorrow (January 18) in Mumbai and they are set to face a happy headache while doing the same. While top-order is more or less clear, they need to find the right pieces for the middle-order puzzle. There are plenty of players in the mix for those 3-4 positions but Shreyas Iyer remains a no-brainer for the middle-overs period.With the right mix of caution and aggression, he has aced the 50-over game in the past and had a stellar 2023 ODI World Cup where he amassed 530 runs in 11 innings. The runs came at a healthy strike-rate and he hit two hundreds and three half-centuries during India's campaign. The right-hander had a turbulent little period where he lost out on an annual contract but bounced back in emphatic fashion during the IPL where he led KKR to the title.There were three ordinary outings against Sri Lanka in the ODIs but he rediscovered the touch during the domestic season where he made substantial contributions, across formats, for Mumbai. 452 runs in five First Class innings were followed by 345 runs in Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy and 325 runs in five List A fixtures. He has the weight of runs behind him but more importantly has the game suited for the surfaces in Dubai. With spin expected to play a major role in the tournament, Iyer has what it takes to control the middle period of the game like he did during the 2023 ODI World Cup.He has time and again reiterated that he is not fussy about batting positions and that flexibility will certainly come good. The England ODIs will definitely help coach Gautam Gambhir and captain Rohit Sharma to finalise composition of their middle-order, and it will make a lot of sense if it revolves around Iyer.Yes, there are plenty of right-handers in the middle-order mix at the moment but India do have some flexible left-handers in the lower-order who they can seamlessly move around as per the match situation. Those movements were on display during the three ODIs vs Sri Lanka and it could well continue in the upcoming ODI assignments.Axar Patel or Ravindra Jadeja? Or both?India picked both the left-arm spin all-rounders for the T20 World Cup but only Axar played the Sri Lanka ODIs as Jadeja was rested. The selectors now need to take that tough call because Axar did exceedingly well in the T20 World Cup and looked good in the ODIs vs Sri Lanka too. Jadeja, on the other hand, last played an ODI back in November 2023.It now remains to be seen whether the management moves on from Jadeja or carries both. It will be very difficult to ignore Axar because he lends a lot of balance to the Playing XI with his all-round abilities.All the questions will be answered in a few hours' time as the men who matter will get in a huddle to pick the squad for the multi-nation tournament.",India men's senior selection committee will pick provisional squad for Champions Trophy.

David Miller lauds Lhuan-dre Pretorius after Paarl Royals beat MI Cape Town

Dinesh Karthik on Lhuan-dre Pretorius, start for Paarl Royals in SA20

Jasprit Bumrah injury: Where things stand with BOOM!

Lhuan-dre Pretorius may be living life in the fast lane at the Paarl Royals in the SA20 , but the teenager’s dad Abe is still picking up traffic fines.Pretorius has burst on the global cricket scene in spectacular fashion with the former South Africa U-19 star smashing two half-centuries in three matches to top the SA20 run-scorers list.He has surprised many with the maturity he’s shown at the crease. Unfazed at the prospect of facing up to the likes of Trent Boult, Kagiso Rabada, Marco Jansen and Ottniel Baartman.But Abe Pretorius - Lhuan-dre’s father - claims his son is still just a normal teen finding his way in the world.“I remember when Anrich Nortje bowled to him. He told me an interesting story: ‘Dad, I wasn’t scared of the ball. I was more scared of me running into him because I saw it on TV.’ He was never afraid. Pace never bothered him,” said the senior Pretorius.“But he’s still a baby. He’s only 18. He has a mustache. But his beard is soft. He's still a kid and sometimes I forget.“But he's also not a kid getting all the speed fines. The car is still in my name. It's crazy!”The Pretorius family have certainly been there to support Lhuan-dre and fellow South African schools prodigy Vihan - ‘he’s my baby and can do no wrong’ - cricket aspirations since they first picked up a cricket bat.Abe installed a training net at their home in Potchefstroom early on and since they stayed close to Senwes Park - home of the North West Dragons - would regularly take his sons there to train.Lhuan-dre, therefore, had the privilege of spending time with the likes of SA20 stars Bjorn Fortuin and Rassie van der Dussen from a very young age.“He always wanted to play the game. He was brought up next to the field at Senwes Park. So, I was privileged to have a hospitality suite there. And that’s where he met Bjorn and Rassie.“He always played with them or next to the field to see them playing. And that's what's so nice. He plays now with Bjorn. There's a bit of banter going on between them.”At this critical age parents can often become over-indulged with their children’s sporting careers, forcing them to train when they may no longer enjoy it.Abe was never confronted with this issue.“He lives for cricket. He YouTubes cricket every night. I don’t think he’s watched a cartoon ever in his life. From a young age, before any big game, he would wake me up at five.“And we had a net in our yard at the back. So I needed to throw to him before school. And when he gets picked up and then he's ready in the afternoon.“I think more waking him up for academics. He never wanted to study. That was a headache and we had to get a tutor to assist him.”Whilst it was almost the perfect childhood growing up in Potchefstroom, the major cricket-playing high schools are based in Johannesburg. That’s close to 120 kilometres away.It is common practice for young South African boys to leave their family homes at 12-13 years old after being afforded scholarships to attend these ivy-league schools as hostel boarders.But Abe was having none of it. Instead, he packed up and relocated the entire family to “The Big Smoke” - as Johannesburg is colloquially referred to - for Lhuan-dre to attend the prestigious St Stithians College - alma mater of Kagiso Rabada, Grant Elliot and a certain Kwena Maphaka.The latter is, of course, the same age as Lhuan-dre with their cricket journeys following an almost identical path. They played together at school, youth provincial Lions teams, SA U19, and now at the Royals.And according to Abe, it's Lhuan-dre, who kept wicket for most of this period, that knows how to inspire the tearaway rookie fast bowler.“Lhuan-dre knew just how to switch Kwena on. He would always go up to Kwena and whisper something in his ear, and Kwena would get spitting mad,” he said.“After that, Kwena would run through the teams. There are a lot of video clips of when they were at school together, especially when Lhuan-dre was keeping. They were a mean team.”With Lhuan-dre being a left-handed opening batter that keeps wicket, has Gunn & Moore as his bat sponsor, and also having an aversion to a prospective academic career, the comparisons with Proteas and Durban's Super Giants star Quinton de Kock were inevitable.But according to Abe, Lhuan-dre would not want it any other way, and is looking forward to the Royals’ first clash against the Super Giants at Kingsmead on Thursday, January 23.“He’s had a photo up of Quinny since he was very young. He’s still Quinny’s biggest fan. He simply loved Quinny.“Everything about him is Quinny. Yeah, I think you're going to see when they're going to play each other. It's going to be a challenge. I think he's going to be a star-struck!""Everything is happening at the speed of light for Pretorius right now. If he maintains this early season momentum through SA20 Season 3, it would not be far too to suggest that the powerful left-hander could come into the reckoning as a potential replacement at the Indian Premier League (IPL) in the near future.So, how does a father keep a teenager in check when the whole world suddenly wants to give him everything his heart has always desired?“I'm Afrikaans! That's all. He knows me. I don’t play.“I'm a mining oak and I'm Afrikaans. So, he'll know his way.“That's a cultural thing. He knows how it works. You stay humble.”",Lhuan-dre Pretorius has scored two half-centuries in three matches for Paarl Royals in the SA20. The 18-year-old has surprised many with the maturity he’s shown at the crease. Abe Pretorius says his son is still just a normal teen finding his way in the world.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117332449,imgsize-38972,width-400,resizemode-4/117332449.jpg"

Numbers elicit praise from likes of Sachin

NAGPUR: Ironic as it may sound, the buzzword in Indian cricket over the past weeks has been a non-cricketing term - PR. Fan wars on social media, ignited by the debacle in Australia, sparked debates on 'paid news' versus authenticity.With the debate still raging, a post on X went viral on social media on Thursday evening."" Karun Nair has a serious shot at making it to the Indian team if he can afford hiring a PR agency for a while,"" said the post.The witty remark struck a chord, highlighting the one element missing in Nair's arsenal - a robust social media presence. But in the Vijay Hazare Trophy , it wasn't PR that spoke for him; it was his bat, loud and clear.A total of 752 runs, at an unbelievable average of 752 was enough for Nair to trend on X. Social media has been abuzz, with many urging Indian selectors to draft Nair into the Indian squad for the forthcoming England ODI series and the Champions Trophy scheduled in Pakistan and Dubai.With an unstoppable 88* off just 44 balls on Thursday, Nair, who had been knocking on the selectors' door, almost broke it in the semifinal. Coming in to bat in the 35th over, the Vidarbha skipper unleashed his magic in the final 15 balls he played in the match, stacking up 55* runs. His ball-by-ball figures read 4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 6, 6, 1, 6, 4, 0, 6, 4, 4, 6. He hit boundaries for fun and toyed with the field at will.Cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar lauded Nair's run on Friday. ""Scoring 752 runs in 7 innings with 5 centuries is nothing short of extraordinary, @karun126. Performances like these don't just happen, they come from immense focus and hard work. Keep going strong and make every opportunity count,"" he posted on X.Former Indian spinner Harbhajan Singh too was vocal on his Youtube channel, questioning the double standards of selectors. ""Different rules for different people… that shouldn't be the way. When Nair is scoring runs, you need to play him, right? He doesn't have tattoos, doesn't wear fancy clothes, is that the reason you're not picking him? Does he not work hard,"" he said.Some also drew comparisons of Nair's purple patch with that of VVS Laxman before the stylish batsman was re-drafted in the Indian squad. ""When Laxman made a comeback into the Indian team, he made a big statement with 1,400-odd runs. Nair's stupendous show should be enough for him to launch his comeback,"" a post read.Nair's super show has rewritten history books too. He now tops the list of most runs as a captain in the Vijay Hazare trophy. He is also set to finish as batsman with highest average in Vijay Hazare history.Prior to being dismissed for 112 against Uttar Pradesh, Nair had set a new List A record of scoring 542 runs without being dismissed, going past former New Zealand allrounder James Franklin","Vidarbha batsman Karun Nair scores 752 runs at an average of 752 in Vijay Hazare Trophy.

Hopefully, 2025 will be a better season for us: Sharjah Warriorz captain Tim Southee

ILT20: Captain speak on media day ahead of third season

Sharjah Warriorz clinched a thrilling victory over Dubai Capitals in their first home game of the season, thanks to a stunning counter-attacking innings by Sri Lankan batter Avishka Fernando . With this win, the Warriorz have climbed to the second spot on the points table.The Sharjah Warriorz chased down the target with 5 wickets and 11 deliveries to spare , despite facing a daunting chase of 202 runs. Captain Tim Southee praised Fernando's incredible performance, especially considering he had just arrived on the morning of the match.""To chase down a score like that and that innings from Fernando was incredible. To get off the plane in the morning and do that is special. Fernando was outstanding for us,"" Southee said.Southee acknowledged that there were areas for improvement, particularly in fielding and bowling, but he was pleased with the team's depth, as several players stepped up to perform despite some being sick.Coach JP Duminy echoed Southee's sentiments, emphasising the need to work on their fielding as a collective effort. He expressed the team's desire to excel in this aspect of the game.""Fielding is an area of our game that we can work on. We try to collectively put in a big effort in the field. So, that's something we want to work on and fielding is something we want to be better at for sure,"" Duminy said.Avishka Fernando, who scored a blistering 81 off just 27 deliveries, with 8 sixes and 6 fours, credited his success to focusing on his natural game and maintaining a positive mindset while chasing a formidable target. Fernando's knock was the fastest-ever 50 in the history of the ILT20 .""Focussing on my natural game and thank the lord for today's knock. The wicket was nice to bat today, the thoughts when chasing 200 was to be positive, it came naturally and thankful for that. I did not realise that I have broken the record for the fastest-ever 50.""Coach Duminy showered praise on Fernando, commending his confidence and ability to perform despite having just joined the team. He emphasised the importance of creating an environment where players feel at ease, which is something the Sharjah Warriorz strive for.""Just the mindset that he came in with, he got off the plane last night and got introduced to the team after that. And to have the confidence to arrive and play the way he did, shows, not only his character but also his ability. And just for him to feel at ease in our environment is something we (Sharjah Warriorz) strive for, but that was certainly one of the most special knocks we have seen,"" the coach added.Duminy revealed that the team talk at the halfway stage was light-hearted, focusing on the quality of the pitch and the need to play to their abilities. He emphasised that intent would never be lacking in their lineup and that consistency was the key moving forward.Sharjah Warriorz will face the MI Emirates in their next match at Sharjah on Sunday.",Sharjah Warriorz beat Dubai Capitals by five wickets.

We're a better outfit than the last two games: Super Giants coach Lance Klusener

Keep improving and play some better cricket: Sunrisers' Liam Dawson

Durban's Super Giants faced another setback in the ongoing SA20 League , suffering a 58-run loss to defending champions Sunrisers Eastern Cape at Kingsmead on Friday. The defeat marked their second consecutive loss at home, leaving head coach Lance Klusener visibly disappointed with his team's performance.""We have a proud record from last season playing at home, so this is absolutely disappointing,"" Klusener said after the match. ""I think we're a better outfit than how we turned out in the last two games. While the surfaces have been challenging, that's no excuse. We lacked the aggression to take the first punch, and when you're on the back foot, it's tough to recover.""The Sunrisers, who entered the match on the back of three consecutive losses, delivered a resounding comeback. Klusener credited their sharpness and determination. ""They came in with three losses, so for them to bounce back the way they did was outstanding. They were running well between the wickets, and we all know how well they field. Sometimes it's the small things that make the big difference.""The Super Giants' batting woes continued to be a concern, with the team failing to capitalise on starts. ""It's not about the batting quality; we have outstanding batters. The problem lies in not building partnerships or capitalising on starts. This evening that surface was tough to make a comeback against some quality spin,"" Klusener explained.Noor Ahmad was the standout performer for Super Giants, taking 4 for 25. Klusener praised his former Afghanistan players, Ahmad and Naveen-ul-Haq , the latter finishing with 1 for 44. ""Noor has been an outstanding performer for a few years now. He bowls at a good pace, making it tough to pick him through the air. That's his strength. Naveen is quality too - most wickets in T20s last year. It's great to see them both step up.""Looking ahead, Klusener emphasised the need for self-reflection. ""We need to focus on ourselves rather than worrying too much about the opposition. The way we batted, especially without building partnerships, needs to change. While our bowling is in a better place, we need to score more runs to be competitive,"" he said.Meanwhile, Sunrisers Eastern Cape finally broke their losing streak in the SA20 season with the big win. The defending champions, who had struggled in their first three matches, delivered a performance that Liam Dawson described as crucial for their campaign.""It was a very important win. We know how good they are, especially at home,"" Dawson remarked in the post-match press conference. ""They've got two quality spinners in Noor Ahmed and Keshav Maharaj. So we knew it was going to be tough coming here and getting a win. As a group, we’ve been honest with ourselves—we haven’t played to our potential at all yet in this tournament. This was a massive game for us, and we’re very, very happy to get the win.""Dawson highlighted the team’s resolve to use this victory as a turning point. ""Without doubt, we’d love this to be the catalyst for more winning performances and points on the board. We know we’ve been below our standards in the first three or four games. We’ve got to come back Sunday and try to produce another good performance against a very strong side,"" he said.Acknowledging the competitive nature of the SA20 League, Dawson stressed the need for continuous improvement. ""Every team is strong in this competition. We won’t take this win for granted at all. There’s a lot we need to improve on as a group. The focus is on keeping the momentum and playing better cricket,"" he added.",Durban's Super Giants lost 58-run to Sunrisers Eastern Cape at Kingsmead. Defeat marks their second consecutive loss at home in the SA20 League. Head coach Lance Klusener was visibly disappointed with his team's performance.

What does the horoscope of struggling Prithvi Shaw say?

Former India cricketer Aakash Chopra has expressed surprise over the BCCI 's decision to enforce mandatory travel rules for players, requiring them to travel together with the team for matches and practice sessions. Speaking on his YouTube channel, Chopra questioned the necessity of such a regulation and suggested it might have been introduced due to prior misuse.""Players cannot travel separately with families.All players are expected to travel with the team to and from matches and practice sessions. I am extremely surprised by this rule. Going for practice or the match is with the team only,"" Chopra said. ""This has been happening forever. If someone wants to practice more, they request the coach. But has someone been leaving early? Some abuse must have happened; that's why this rule is being enforced,"" he added.The BCCI's decision follows a review meeting held after India's 1-3 loss to Australia in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, attended by captain Rohit Sharma , head coach Gautam Gambhir , and chief selector Ajit Agarkar Referencing recent incidents, Chopra clarified that isolated lapses, like Yashasvi Jaiswal reportedly arriving late to a session, do not reflect a widespread issue. ""I am pretty sure everyone wouldn't have been flouting the rule. Yashasvi Jaiswal couldn't reach recently, and he got punished for being late. That's a different story,"" he explained.Chopra also highlighted the importance of accountability for those who might have allowed exceptions in the past. ""If someone claims they don't need to travel with the team because they're staying elsewhere or it's their city, then whoever permitted this should be called out,"" he asserted.The new rule requires players seeking to travel separately to obtain permission from both the head coach and the chairman of selectors. While acknowledging that such regulations might feel overly strict, Chopra remarked, ""Such things are bound to happen if rules are abused.""",Aakash Chopra has expressed surprise over the BCCI's decision to enforce mandatory travel rules for players.

NEW DELHI: Smaran Ravichandran 's stylish 92-ball 101 overshadowed Dhruv Shorey 's third straight century as Karnataka clinched their fifth Vijay Hazare Trophy title with a 36-run win over Vidarbha in a high-scoring final in Vadodara on Saturday.The win in the summit clash helped Karnataka create history as they now have a five out of five record in VGT final.Ravichandran masterful ton, combined with keeper-batter Krishnan Srijith's 78 off 74 balls, laid the foundation for Karnataka's commanding total.

MUMBAI: It's clear Indian captain Rohit Sharma has some serious reservations about certain clauses in the 10-point disciplinary guidelines prepared by the BCCI , which have come out in the media after a review meeting of India's dismal tour of Australia, and is set to discuss the issue with the Board secretary Devajit Saikia .Interestingly, while the guidelines, which include a 14-day limited window for the players' wives to be on a tour that is of a 45-day duration or longer, have clearly been made at the behest of head coach Gautam Gambhir and chief selector Ajit Agarkar , Rohit too was present in the review meeting for a long time.The BCCI has not officially announced the guidelines, but the 10-point diktat has already been published by the media.As Rohit sat beside chairman of selectors Ajit Agarkar before the start of the press conference to announce the Indian team for the ODI series against England and the Champions Trophy at the Wankhede Stadium on Saturday, he was heard telling his former Mumbai teammate: ""Ab mere ko baithna padega secretary ke saath. Family, wamily ka discuss karne ke liye, sab mere ko bol rahe hai yaar (I will have to discuss with the BCCI secretary about this (families on tour) issue. Everyone is asking me (to do so).""Rohit's comment wasn't on record, but it was caught on the microphone.When Rohit was asked about the BCCI's guidelines, he snapped back, ""Who told you about these rules? Has it come from the official handle of the BCCI? Let it come officially.""However, Agarkar confirmed that the BCCI had indeed drafted an SOP for the Dos and Don'ts on tour for Team India Asked what exactly changed in six months with the same set of players who won the T20 World Cup that BCCI needed stringent SOPs, the ex-India pacer explained, ""We'll probably talk about it endlessly if we keep going on. I suppose every team has some rules in place. We've spoken about various things you see over the last few months where you can improve as a team, where you can get a bit closer as a team. It's not a school. It's not a punishment.""It's just you have some rules in place and when you're playing for the national team you just follow those rules. Again, these are mature individuals. They are superstars in their own rights in international sport.""Agarkar said that many of these protocols for Team India were already in place, it's just that they were spelled out now.""But at the end of the day you're eventually representing your country. There are certain things that you just inherently follow as every team does. I think a lot of them have been in place. Maybe, we've spoken about it now and it's been put out, but a lot of them have been in place in any case. You keep on refining it as you go along eventually what suits the team, you want to try and do,"" he asserted.Rohit insisted that the India head coach had full trust on his leadership skills on the field and they were on the same page.""Both of us are very clear in what we want to do. I'm not going to sit here and discuss what goes behind every game tactically but it's very clear in my mind. Gambhir is somebody once we enter the field, he trusts what the captain is doing on the field. The basic talks that happen are only off the field, in the ground or maybe the changing room. ""But once we take the field it's all about what I do on the field. That's the kind of trust we have in each other and that's how it should be. That's about it,"" the Indian captain stressed.",Rohit Sharma has some serious reservations about the new BCCI disciplinary guidelines. Sharma is set to discuss the issue with the Board secretary Devajit Saikia. The guidelines include a 14-day limited window for the players' wives to be on a tour.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117356879,imgsize-31402,width-400,resizemode-4/117356879.jpg"

Delhi Ranji Squad for the next two matches:

What does the horoscope of struggling Prithvi Shaw say?

NEW DELHI: The suspense surrounding Virat Kohli 's availability for Delhi's upcoming Ranji Trophy matches has ended with the announcement of the team squad, excluding the India star.Kohli, who has been managing a persistent neck sprain, has been ruled out of the games against Saurashtra (January 23) and Railways (January 30).As reported earlier by TimesofIndia.com, Kohli has been carrying a niggle in his neck and even received an injection to address the issue . And thus, he will not be playing the upcoming Ranji matches for Delhi.A meeting of the Senior Men’s Selection Committee at the DDCA on January 17 finalised the 21-member squad, led by Ayush Badoni .Ayush Badoni (C), Sanat Sangwan, Arpit Rana, Yash Dhull, Rishabh Pant (w.k), Jonty Sidhu, Himmat Singh, Navdeep Saini, Money Grewal, Harsh Tyagi, Siddhant Sharma, Shivam Sharma, Pranav Rajvanshi (w.k), Vaibhav Kandpal, Mayank Gussain, Gagan Vats, Ayush Doseja, Rounak Waghela, Sumit Mathur, Rahul Gahlot, Jitesh Singh.In the ongoing Test cricket season, Kohli's form has been under scrutiny. The batting maestro, once considered invincible, has shown signs of vulnerability outside the off stump.After a promising century in Perth against the old Kookaburra ball, his performances Down Under declined sharply.Kohli managed an average of 22.47 in 2024 and only 23.75 across five Tests in Australia, with repeated dismissals on balls outside the fifth or sixth stump. His struggles highlight a potential technical issue that needs addressing, and playing domestic cricket could help him overcome the bad patch.Meanwhile, Delhi's Ranji squad shows promise, with Rishabh Pant as the designated wicketkeeper and the likes of Yash Dhull, Navdeep Saini, and Harsh Tyagi forming the core.","Virat Kohli ruled out of Delhi's next two Ranji Trophy matches.

NEW DELHI: Spin duo of Noman Ali and Sajid Khan put Pakistan in a commanding position against the West Indies on the second day of the first Test in Multan.The pair combined to take nine wickets, skittling the West Indies for a meager 137 in response to Pakistan's first innings total of 230.At the close of play, Pakistan extended their 93-run lead to 202, reaching 109 for 3 in their second innings.Kamran Ghulam and Saud Shakeel were unbeaten on nine and two respectively when bad light forced an early end to play.Left-arm spinner Jomel Warrican struck twice for the West Indies, removing Muhammad Hurraira for 29 after an opening partnership of 67 and trapping Babar Azam lbw for just five.Skipper Shan Masood looked solid for his 52, hitting two sixes and two fours, before being run out by Warrican while attempting a quick single.The Multan pitch, dry and devoid of grass, has already produced 22 wickets in six sessions despite several hours lost due to poor visibility on the first two days.Noman claimed 5 for 39, his seventh five-wicket haul in Tests, while Sajid finished with 4 for 65 as the West Indies innings lasted just 25.2 overs.Sajid made an immediate impact, removing Mikyle Louis (one), Keacy Carty (0), Kraigg Brathwaite (11), and Kavem Hodge (four) in his first three overs.

India’s ODI Squad Against England:

What does the horoscope of struggling Prithvi Shaw say?

NEW DELHI: Besides the confirmation of the 15-man squad for the ICC Champions Trophy 2025 , the BCCI (Board of Control for Cricket in India) on Saturday announced a 16-member squad for the ODI series against England.A significant talking point in it was the inclusion of Harshit Rana as cover for Jasprit Bumrah , who is yet to fully recover from a recent back injury.Bumrah, India’s spearhead in the bowling attack across all formats, has been sidelined for five weeks to manage his workload and recovery from a back injury.During the squad announcement, chief selector Ajit Agarkar clarified that Bumrah's availability for the series remains uncertain, with more clarity expected by early February.""With Jasprit Bumrah we are waiting to hear about his fitness and when is he likely to be available so Harshit Rana is going to be a part of the One-day squad against England right now... I don't think he is likely to be fit for the first couple of games,"" Agarkar noted.The selectors, therefore, chose to play it safe, naming Rana as an interim option with Bumrah unlikely to feature in the first two ODIs.Rana’s inclusion highlights the team management’s strategy of balancing depth with opportunity. Primarily recognised as a right-arm medium pacer, Rana has already displayed his versatility in the Test arena with two appearances in Australia.Despite modest returns in Tests (4 wickets at an average of 50.75), his ability to maintain consistency and extract movement has made him an appealing prospect.Rana is not just about bowling; his all-round skills add value to the squad.A consistent performer in first-class cricket, Rana boasts a highest score of 122 not out in 12 matches, with an average of 34 and a strike rate of 82.78.Also See: 2025 Champions Trophy His dual capacity to bat and bowl makes him a potential utility player in the 50-over format.

Harshit Rana joins Kuldeep Yadav, Mohammed Shami, and Arshdeep Singh in the bowling contingent.By opting for Rana, the selectors have somewhat prioritised flexibility and long-term planning, allowing Bumrah the time to regain full fitness ahead of the high-stakes Champions Trophy.","Jasprit Bumrah is yet to fully recover from a back injury.

Leaders Liverpool strike late as Darwin Nunez sinks Brentford,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/epl/top-stories/leaders-liverpool-strike-late-as-darwin-nunez-sinks-brentford/articleshow/117359989.cms,"Darwin Nunez. (LFC Photo)

NEW DELHI: Darwin Nunez delivered a late heroics to fire Liverpool back into Premier League title contention with a dramatic stoppage-time brace, securing a hard-fought 2-0 victory over Brentford at the Gtech Community Stadium on Saturday.Liverpool entered the match desperate to end a run of two consecutive league draws, and Nunez, who had struggled for form with just four goals in 26 appearances this season, emerged as the unlikely hero. The Uruguayan's double lifted the Reds seven points clear of second-placed Arsenal, though the Gunners have an opportunity to close the gap with a win over Aston Villa later in the day.The result provided a massive boost to Arne Slot ’s side, who remain in control of their title destiny with a game in hand. It also marked Liverpool’s first league win in three games, after a series of disappointing results that included a draw against Nottingham Forest and a League Cup semi-final first-leg defeat to Tottenham.Brentford, boasting the joint-best home record in the Premier League, made life difficult for the visitors early on. The Bees nearly took the lead when Mikkel Damsgaard failed to convert Mads Roerslev's inviting ball across the six-yard box. Bryan Mbeumo also tested Alisson Becker with a fierce drive from the edge of the area.Liverpool, meanwhile, created a host of chances but were thwarted by Brentford’s resilient defense and in-form goalkeeper Mark Flekken. Dominik Szoboszlai came agonizingly close to breaking the deadlock, smashing a 25-yard strike against the crossbar, while Cody Gakpo and Luis Diaz both missed opportunities to find the net.In the second half, Brentford continued to threaten on the counter, with Alisson twice denying Mbeumo and Nathan Collins making a crucial goal-line clearance to keep Salah's deflected shot out.With time running out and frustration building, Slot turned to Nunez, bringing him on alongside Andrew Robertson. The move paid off spectacularly in stoppage time. Trent Alexander-Arnold delivered a pinpoint cross, and Nunez calmly slotted home from close range, sparking wild celebrations on the Liverpool bench.Moments later, Nunez struck again, this time latching onto Harvey Elliott’s perfectly weighted pass and rifling a fierce shot past Flekken to seal the win. The Uruguayan’s decisive contributions silenced his critics and ensured Liverpool stayed firmly in the title race.For Brentford, the defeat marked a missed opportunity to capitalize on Liverpool's recent struggles. Thomas Frank's men, who had shown resilience in their 2-2 draw with Manchester City earlier in the week, were left to rue missed chances and late lapses in concentration.Liverpool’s victory not only ended their mini-slump but also sent a statement to their title rivals. With Nunez rediscovering his scoring touch, the Reds are primed for a strong push in the second half of the season.",Darwin Nunez scores stoppage-time brace as Liverpool beat Brentford 2-0.

NEW DELHI: Justin Kluivert delivered a sensational performance with a hat-trick as Bournemouth ended Newcastle 's winning streak in emphatic fashion, securing a dominant 4-1 victory at St. James’ Park on Saturday.The result propelled Bournemouth into the Premier League 's top six while halting Newcastle’s bid for a club-record 10th consecutive win across all competitions.The Cherries, now unbeaten in 11 matches, stunned the Magpies with their relentless energy and clinical finishing. Kluivert, the son of former Newcastle striker Patrick Kluivert , stole the spotlight before Milos Kerkez added the finishing touch with a late fourth goal in stoppage time.Newcastle, still in fourth place, saw their cushion over Bournemouth in the race for a Champions League spot shrink to just one point. The defeat also ended Alexander Isak’s remarkable scoring streak, as the Swedish striker, who had scored in eight consecutive Premier League games, was effectively neutralized by Bournemouth's resolute defense.Andoni Iraola’s Bournemouth started brightly, dominating from the first whistle. They nearly went ahead in the opening minutes when Dango Ouattara’s shot was saved by Martin Dubravka, and Antoine Semenyo blasted the rebound over the bar. Just two minutes later, they found the breakthrough as Semenyo’s cut-back was clinically swept into the far corner by Kluivert.Though Newcastle managed to briefly equalize through Bruno Guimarães, who headed in Lewis Hall’s corner, Bournemouth restored their lead before halftime. Kluivert doubled his tally with a composed finish from Ouattara’s precise pass, leaving the hosts reeling.The second half saw Bournemouth continue to dominate, with chances falling their way. Ouattara had a goal disallowed following a VAR review, and David Brooks was denied by a combination of Dubravka and the post.Unlike their midweek disappointment against Chelsea, where they conceded a stoppage-time equalizer, Bournemouth ensured there would be no repeat this time.Kluivert completed his hat-trick with a stunning strike from outside the box, marking his second treble of the season—though this one was particularly special as all three goals came from open play, unlike his hat-trick of penalties against Wolves in November.Milos Kerkez then capped off the victory in style, drilling home Bournemouth’s fourth. The 19-year-old Hungarian left-back, rumored to be on the radar of Liverpool and Manchester United, added insult to injury for Newcastle with his impressive strike.The defeat marked a humbling afternoon for Eddie Howe’s men, who were thoroughly outplayed in front of their home crowd. Meanwhile, Bournemouth’s stunning form continues to raise expectations as they make a push for European football.",Justin Kluivert scores hat-trick as Bournemouth beat Newcastle 4-1 at St. James' Park.

NEW DELHI: Manchester City star Erling Haaland on Friday signed a new contract with the Premier League champions that will keep him at the club until 2034.City announced the nine and a half year extension for the 24-year-old striker, who has netted an impressive 111 goals in 126 matches since his arrival from Borussia Dortmund in 2022.The extension marks the longest contract in the league's history, surpassing the nine-year agreement Cole Palmer signed with Chelsea last year. Haaland’s salary is reportedly set at £500,000 ($610,000) per week.Haaland, who joined City in 2022, made an immediate impact by scoring 52 goals across all competitions in his debut season. His stellar performances helped the club secure a historic treble, winning the Champions League, Premier League, and FA Cup. He continued his remarkable form last season, netting 38 goals and contributing to the team’s fourth consecutive league title.""I am really happy to have signed my new contract and to be able to look forward to spending even more time at this great club,"" said a joyous Haaland.""Manchester City is a special club, full of fantastic people with amazing supporters, and it's the type of environment that helps bring the best out of everybody.""I also want to thank Pep (Guardiola), his coaching staff, my team-mates and everyone at the club as they have all helped me so much in the past couple of years.

NEW DELHI: Amad Diallo's remarkable 12-minute hat-trick rescued Manchester United from a potentially embarrassing defeat against struggling Southampton at Old Trafford on Thursday.The visitors, who are battling to avoid finishing the season as the worst team in Premier League history, took a deserved lead through Manuel Ugarte's own goal late in the first half.Southampton had numerous opportunities to extend their advantage, with Ivan Juric's side playing with confidence and intensity.However, Diallo's introduction in the second half proved to be a game-changer for the hosts.The young forward equalised in the 82nd minute, capitalising on a defensive lapse to score his first goal. Eight minutes later, he latched onto a clever pass from Christian Eriksen to put United ahead.Deep into stoppage time, Diallo completed his hat-trick, taking advantage of another defensive mistake from the visitors.The 3-1 victory provided a much-needed boost for Manchester United, who had endured three consecutive Premier League defeats prior to this match.It also lifted them to 12th in the table, while Southampton remained 10 points adrift of safety.Despite the eventual scoreline, Southampton's performance was commendable, as they caused numerous problems for United's defence throughout the match.Kamaldeen Sulemana was particularly impressive, tormenting the home side's right-back with his pace and trickery.Ruben Amorim's decision to introduce Diallo and make other attacking substitutions proved to be a masterstroke, as the forward's clinical finishing ultimately secured all three points for Manchester United in a match that appeared to be slipping away from them.","Manchester United beat Southampton 3-1 at Old Trafford on Thursday.

Kylian Mbappe 's notable performance included a controversial opening goal, followed by Vinicius contributing to Madrid's lead.However, Celta Vigo's persistence paid off with Jonathan Bamba's late goal and Marcos Alonso 's penalty in stoppage time, pushing the game into extra time.In the additional period, Madrid displayed their offensive strength with Endrick scoring his second, Fede Valverde adding another, and Endrick sealing the win with a backheel goal.""This is Madrid, you fight until the end to win,"" said Endrick. ""We never go down, we're always fighting... it was a tough game, but we got the goals and we won.

NEW DELHI: Brazilian football star Neymar jr recently shared his perspective on the dynamics within the Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) team during his time there.In a podcast hosted by Romário, a Brazilian World Cup winner, Neymar discussed the impact of Lionel Messi's arrival at the club in August 2021.According to Neymar, his former teammate Kylian Mbappé became ""a little jealous"" after Messi joined the team. Neymar suggested that Mbappé, who has since joined Real Madrid, didn't want to share the spotlight with anyone else, leading to some conflicts and a change in behaviour.“No, he is not. I have my things with him, we had a little fight, but he was fundamental for us when he arrived. I used to call him golden boy. I always played with him, said he was going to be one of the best. I always helped, talked to him, he came to my place, we had dinner together,” Neymar said.Neymar acknowledged that he had a good partnership with Mbappé initially, referring to him as the ""golden boy"" and praising his potential to become one of the best players.“We had some good years of partnership, but after Messi came he was a little jealous. He didn't want to split me with anyone. And then there were some fights, a change in behavior,” the Brazilian further added.While Neymar didn't explicitly name individuals, he mentioned that big egos within the team often hindered their performances in crucial matches.“It is good to have egos, but you have to know that you don't play alone. There needs to be another guy by your side. (Big) egos were almost everywhere, it can't work,” Neymar said. “If nobody runs and nobody helps, it is impossible to win anything.”Neymar also reflected on the possibility of returning to Brazil after his contract with Al-Hilal in Saudi Arabia expires later this year.It's worth noting that neither Mbappé nor Messi has responded to Neymar's comments as of now.","Neymar discussed the impact of Lionel Messi's arrival at Paris Saint-Germain.

Barcelona advanced to the quarter-finals of the Copa del Rey with a resounding 5-1 victory over Real Betis on Wednesday. The star of the show was 17-year-old Lamine Yamal , who put on a dazzling display at the Olympic Stadium.Gavi opened the scoring for Barcelona early in the match, and the Catalans continued to dominate with goals from Jules Kounde, Raphinha, Ferran Torres, and Yamal himself. The young winger's performance was particularly impressive, as he scored and helped create two more goals.Barcelona's confidence was high coming into the match, having recently won the Spanish Super Cup in Saudi Arabia by thrashing Real Madrid. Despite resting key players like Robert Lewandowski, the team's attacking prowess was on full display.Pau Cubarsi, a 17-year-old defender who came through Barcelona's youth academy alongside Yamal, praised his teammate's performance.""I've been enjoying watching him for many years, now the whole world is, and he deserves it all.""Barcelona's dominance was evident from the start, with Dani Olmo, who recently obtained a temporary playing license, starting as a false nine in place of Lewandowski.

Although Kounde had a second goal disallowed for a marginal offside, Barcelona continued to create chances.In the second half, Yamal had a goal of his own disallowed for an offside in the build-up, but it didn't matter as Raphinha scored minutes later after another surging run from the young winger.

London: Arsenal reignited their Premier League title challenge with a 2-1 victory over Tottenham on Wednesday, while Newcastle secured a spot in the top four thanks to a brace from Alexander Isak.In other matches, David Moyes had a disappointing return to the Everton dugout as his team lost 1-0 to Aston Villa at Goodison Park.The win at the Emirates lifts Arsenal to within four points of league leaders Liverpool, who drew 1-1 with Nottingham Forest on Tuesday, and ended a three-match winless run for the Gunners across all competitions.Tottenham took the lead through Son Heung-min in the 25th minute, but Arsenal equalised 15 minutes later when Gabriel's header from a corner deflected off Dominic Solanke for an own goal.Arsenal completed the turnaround just before halftime, with Leandro Trossard blasting a shot past new Spurs goalkeeper Antonin Kinsky.Despite numerous chances to extend their lead, Arsenal failed to do so and had a nervous moment when Pedro Porro hit the post in stoppage time.Arsenal now sits on 43 points after 21 matches, four points behind Liverpool, who have a game in hand.Mikel Arteta, the Arsenal manager, praised his team's performance, calling it ""outstanding.""""We had some big chances and big situations. At the end we had to suffer more than we wanted,"" he told the BBC.""When you have opportunities (to close the gap) you have to take them. We are on a really consistent run in the Premier League. It's about recovery tomorrow and Aston Villa on Saturday, going and going.""The defeat is another setback for injury-plagued Tottenham, who have taken only five points from their last nine Premier League games and have fallen to 13th in the table.Tottenham manager Ange Postecoglou was critical of his team's performance, saying, ""Nowhere near good enough, especially in the first half. We were too passive.""Newcastle moved into fourth place, ahead of struggling Chelsea, with a 3-0 victory over Wolves, thanks to a record-chasing performance from Isak, who scored for the eighth consecutive league match.Isak's deflected shot off Wolves defender Rayan Ait-Nouri put Newcastle ahead in the 34th minute, and he doubled the lead before the hour mark with his 15th league goal of the season.Anthony Gordon added a third goal for Newcastle.""I feel amazing,"" said Isak, who has Jamie Vardy's record of scoring in 11 straight Premier League games in his sights.""Individually I feel free and confident but looking at the team we are doing so well as well, defending and with threats going forward. It is a team and I have to keep contributing with goals.""At Goodison Park, Ollie Watkins scored the only goal for Aston Villa in the 51st minute, slotting past England teammate Jordan Pickford after being sent through by Morgan Rogers.Despite their efforts, Everton lacked creativity, which is unsurprising for a team that has scored only 15 league goals in 20 matches this season.The result lifts Aston Villa to seventh in the table, while Everton remain in deep trouble, just one point above the relegation zone in 16th place.Everton, who have been in the top flight since 1954, have struggled against relegation for the past three seasons and are once again in a perilous position.David Moyes, who enjoyed success during his 11-year stint at Goodison Park from 2002 to 2013, was brought back by Everton's new American owners, the Friedkin Group, after they sacked Sean Dyche last week.""Obviously it's been a bit of a whirlwind,"" Moyes said. ""Sean Dyche left a group of players that have great character and a great attitude.""I'm really pleased to take over that. What I need to do is add quality and find a way of getting results but you can't change the whole thing around straight away.""In another match, Leicester suffered their sixth consecutive league defeat, losing 2-0 to Crystal Palace, which leaves them second from bottom in the table.Jean-Philippe Mateta scored for Palace early in the second half, and Marc Guehi secured the points with a late second goal.","Arsenal beat Tottenham Hotspur 2-1 to move within four points of Premier League leaders Liverpool.

NEW DELHI: Danielle Collins endured a challenging evening at the Australian Open in Melbourne on Saturday, facing a chorus of boos as she exited the tournament with a 6-4, 6-4 loss to fellow American Madison Keys in the third round.The 31-year-old Collins had stirred controversy two days earlier when she became a polarizing figure at Melbourne Park . During her second-round win over Australian wildcard Destanee Aiava, Collins sarcastically thanked hecklers for ""paying my bills"" and engaged provocatively with the home crowd by blowing kisses, cupping her ear, and pointing to her backside.""Every person that's bought a ticket to come out here and heckle me or do what they do, it's all going towards the Danielle Collins Fund,"" she remarked afterward.Her arrival on Rod Laver Arena for the match against the 19th-seeded Keys was met with a mixed reception, as a combination of cheers and boos filled the air. The crowd's reactions intensified when Collins committed her first double fault, prompting further applause from some spectators.As tensions mounted, the chair umpire intervened at the end of the opening set, urging fans to respect both players.Collins, seeded 10th, required a medical timeout late in the second set while trailing 4-3. She returned to the court with heavy strapping on her left leg but was unable to mount a comeback. By the time the match concluded, the stadium was only half-full, with the remaining crowd offering a blend of cheers and boos as Collins exited.Despite the controversial atmosphere, Keys remained composed throughout the match, letting her tennis do the talking as she advanced to the fourth round.","Danielle Collins loses to fellow American Madison Keys in third round of Australian Open.

(AP Photo)

MELBOURNE: Gael Monfils fired a 215 kmph serve down-the-middle on match point and it brooked no response from an opponent with enviable wingspan. The 38-year-old Frenchman immediately broke into a dance, shaking to the rhythm of victory as the sun cast a glow on Melbourne Park .Monfils – maverick shot maker and athlete extraordinaire – closed out a 3-6, 7-5, 7-6 (1), 6-4 win after three-hours and eight-minutes against the fourth-seeded American Taylor Fritz to move into the Australian Open fourth round.“I felt good, I felt that I want to do that (dance) in that moment, be myself,” the Frenchman said. “It was my way to express my joy.”Monfils, who climbed to a career-best No.6 in the world in 2016, will play another American 22-year-old Ben Shelton on Monday in what will be a clash of generations.Monfils -- the second-oldest man (after Roger Federer) to reach the Australian Open fourth round since the tournament moved to Melbourne Park in 1988 -- notched his eighth consecutive match win of the season.The 38-year-old, who sent down 24 aces in the match, pulled off a massive hold in the fourth game of the fourth set to make his intentions clear. Monfils then broke in the ninth game when Fritz picked up a low volley off his shoe strings and dumped it into the net.“I keep playing for these matches - big player, big stadium, good crowd and good energy. It's exactly why I'm playing,” he said matter-of-factly.The 38-year-old Frenchman, who continued the blazing start to his 22nd season on Tour, becoming the oldest man in almost 50 years to win an ATP Tour title in Auckland one week ago, was asked how big his dreams were. Could he go on to win the tournament?“No! This is not even a dream, to win the tournament. My dream is to be old and with a lot of kids and healthy,” Monfils said.Monfils was reminded that he had taken out the fourth seed in four sets and from where he was the title may not be such an impossible task.“That's your dream, I guess, to win a Slam. I tell you my dream,” he told the reporter, adding, “My dream is to have an unbelievable family. Tennis is cool. Of course, you want to have a goal, a dream, whatever. But my dream is out there.”Saturday’s result against Fritz was Monfils’ first top-5 win at a Grand Slam since 2008.“I did not even know this stat, I don't look at the stat, I was just fortunate today to win,” he said. “Numbers are numbers, on the court, you play a number 4, or 10, or 100, it’s a battle out there.”Not long after he left the Margaret Court Arena, Monfils returned courtside to cheer on his wife Elina Svitolina , who had to work her way back into her third-round clash. The Ukrainian, who returned to the Tour in the spring of 2023 after maternity leave, is seeded 28, and was also up against a fourth seed -- Italian Jasmine Paolini.The 30-year-old rallied to score a 2-6, 6-4, 6-0 win and will face Russian Veronika Kudermetova in the fourth round on Monday.Svitolina, flaunting an aggressive style in her second innings in the sport, found her fight in the second set, playing from closer to the baseline and using the court. She bageled the 29-year-old in the deciding set and broke into a dramatic fist pump, far removed from her husband’s dance moves.Monfils was the face of joy at Melbourne Park on Saturday evening.“It was a crazy battle, I want to say that I was inspired by my husband’s win, but the first set went so bad, I don’t know if I was inspired or not,” said Svitolina, who added that her fight was characteristic of the people of Ukraine.Before the 30-year-old left the court, she penned on the camera, Ukraine, Love.",Gael Monfils beats Taylor Fritz in three sets to reach Australian Open fourth round. The 38-year-old Frenchman is the second-oldest man (after Roger Federer) to reach the fourth round since the tournament moved to Melbourne Park in 1988.

MELBOURNE: Emma Raducanu tried to ask the questions, she threw in the extra ball and attempted to force the extra step from her opponent, but the world No.2 Iga Swiatek had all the answers and then some more in their Australian Open third-round clash on Rod Laver Arena .“For sure I felt great,” Swiatek said after her 6-1, 6-0 win. “I felt like the ball was listening to me. I felt like all the tactics and everything I wanted to do, I was able to. So I just kept going.”Swiatek, a five-time major winner, who will play German lucky loser Eva Lys in the fourth round on Monday, expanded on what exactly she meant by ‘the ball listening to her’, not that she needed to draw it out given that she had 24 winners and only 12 unforced errors in the 70-minute affair.“I feel like that on a practice court most of the time,” she said. “Sometimes during matches I feel like I’m more precise and actually know where the ball is going to go. On the practice court at home, I feel it all the time, but I'm used to the court, I like the conditions and everything.”Swiatek, who has never been past the semi-finals at Melbourne Park, is beginning to feel at home on these courts.“Sometimes you need to get through some matches where you totally don’t know where the ball is going to land,” the 23-year-old said. “Every day is different, you have to work to get these feelings, not expect that you're going to get them because it's not so easy.”The thing about a Raducanu-Swiatek contest is that the Briton’s game plays right into the Pole’s striking range, and every time Raducanu, the 2021 US Open champion, tried to push the world No.2 simply accelerated, she reached and swung.Swiatek, who bowed out in the third round here last year, said she was in a whole different place this time.“Last year was the toughest Australian Open I have ever had,” she said. “The draw was pretty unlucky for me, still, if you play well, you're able to get through that. I was tight, I didn't move well. Now I feel much more fresh. I feel like everything is in the right spot and working. I can just focus on the game, and that's it.”","Iga Swiatek beats Emma Raducanu 6-1, 6-0 in third round of Australian Open. Pole will play German lucky loser Eva Lys in fourth round on Monday.

NEW DELHI: Defending champion Jannik Sinner showcased his ruthless form on Saturday, storming into the last 16 of the Australian Open in Melbourne with a commanding straight-set victory over American Marcos Giron .The world number one, who had dropped a set for the first time in 14 matches during his second-round encounter with Australian wildcard Tristan Schoolkate, showed no signs of inconsistency on Rod Laver Arena .He overpowered the unseeded Giron with a clinical 6-3, 6-4, 6-2 win in just over two hours, firing 35 winners and eight aces.Next up for Sinner is a clash with either Serbian Miomir Kecmanovic or Danish 13th seed Holger Rune. The Italian enters the matchup riding a remarkable 17-match winning streak that dates back to his loss to Carlos Alcaraz in Beijing last October.“Very happy to be in the next round,” said Sinner, who added eight titles to his name last year, including the US Open and ATP Finals .“Every match has its own challenges. Today, I felt he was solid from the baseline and served well. I still have room to improve, but every win is a step forward.“Mental focus is crucial for us tennis players,” he continued. “If I want to go further in this tournament, I’ll need to raise my game.”The 23-year-old, defending a Grand Slam title for the first time following his thrilling five-set triumph over Daniil Medvedev in last year’s final, wasted no time asserting his dominance against Giron.He broke the American in the first service game, and though he committed 11 unforced errors in the opening set—two more than Giron—the early break proved decisive.In the second set, Sinner waited patiently for his opportunity, breaking in the fifth game when Giron misfired a forehand. From there, the Italian controlled the tempo, consistently outmaneuvering Giron in extended rallies.Sinner’s backhand winner early in the third set secured another break, giving him a 2-0 lead. While Giron, ranked 46th, showed resilience by breaking back to level at 2-2, Sinner quickly responded by breaking again and winning the next four games to seal the victory.For the American, who was seeking to reach the fourth round of a Grand Slam for the first time, Sinner’s relentless performance proved too much to overcome.",Jannik Sinner beats Marcos Giron in straight sets to reach last 16 of Australian Open.

Hit some big shots down the line and used some shape with my forehand, some slice with my backhand and served well,"" he said.""I have a strong belief in myself, a strong belief I can still do some damage and with a little bit of luck we are in the second week of the Australian Open.""Throughout his lengthy career, Monfils has never advanced past the major semifinals.With two strong baseline rallies, one reaching 29 shots and another reaching 24, the two went toe-to-toe at the beginning.Fritz was given a break for 5-3 by a double fault from Monfils, and the American held service to win the opening set.With two strong baseline rallies, one reaching 29 shots and another reaching 24, the two went toe-to-toe at the beginning.Fritz was given a break for 5-3 by a double fault from Monfils, and the American held service to win the opening set.Fritz survived two break points to stay on serve at 3-3 after requiring a medical timeout at the changeover to address his right foot.The Frenchman dominated a progressively irate Fritz in the third set, which ended in a tiebreak.

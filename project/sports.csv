India’s thrilling five-wicket win over Pakistan in the Asia Cup 2025 final was already memorable for the tight finish and dominant performances. But the post-match celebrations focused on an extraordinary coincidence involving Rinku Singh and Tilak Varma.Rinku Singh, who had not played a single match in the tournament until the final, was drafted in after Hardik Pandya was ruled out due to injury. His inclusion itself surprised fans, but what followed left everyone stunned.During the final moments of India’s chase, Singh walked in to face the last over with the scores level. On the very first ball he faced, he smashed Haris Rauf for a boundary over mid-on, hitting the winning runs and sealing India’s ninth Asia Cup title.Presenter Sanjana Ganesan revealed an incredible backstory - that he had written on a card before the tournament that he wanted to hit the winning runs of the Asia Cup 2025 on September 6. This prediction made days before the tournament even began.Tilak, who top-scored in the final with an unbeaten 69 off 53 balls, had also written on a card that he wanted to score runs in the final and help India win. True to his words, Varma anchored the innings alongside Shivam Dube, contributing a vital 60-run partnership for the fifth wicket, with Dube adding 33 off 22 balls.Earlier, India’s bowlers restricted Pakistan to 146 all out in 19.1 overs. Sahibzada Farhan (57 off 38) and Fakhar Zaman (46 off 35) had provided a strong start, but the Indian spin trio of Kuldeep Yadav (4/30), Varun Chakravarthy (2/30) and Axar Patel (2/26) triggered a dramatic collapse, with Pakistan losing their last nine wickets for just 33 runs. Jasprit Bumrah also picked up two wickets.Chasing 147, India initially stumbled to 20/3 after four overs, including early wickets of Abhishek Sharma, Shubman Gill, and captain Suryakumar Yadav. But Tilak's calm innings and the support from Dube steadied the chase, allowing India to cross the finish line with two balls to spare.This was India’s third victory over Pakistan in the tournament, having already beaten them in the group and Super 4 stages. The performances of Rinku Singh and Tilak Varma, and their pre-tournament predictions, have since gone viral, giving the final a near-fairytale finish for the duo.",Tilak Varma and Rinku Singh both wrote down that they wanted to help India in the final by scoring runs ahead of the tournament.

India clinched the 2025 Asia Cup title with a thrilling five-wicket win over Pakistan on Sunday, but the post-match press conferences drew equal attention. India skipper Suryakumar Yadav had surprised everyone by announcing that he would donate his entire match fees from the tournament to the Indian armed forces.Capping off his press conference, he said, “As a gesture, I want to donate my match fees from all the games in this tournament to the Indian Army. I don’t know if people will call it controversial, but for me, it’s the right thing to do.” He concluded his session promptly, putting on display the style that has become his trademark.Following the final, Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha mirrored the India captain's approach, announcing a donation as well. “We as a team, are donating our match fees to all the civilians who lost their lives during the Indian attack and to our kids who were affected by it. We are donating it to them,” Agha said, ending his press conference with a hurried “Thank you very much” before walking out.On the field, India held their nerve in a tense chase. Tilak Varma starred with 69 not out off 53 balls, including a crucial six off Haris Rauf in the 20th over, while Shivam Dube contributed a vital 33 from 22 deliveries.Rinku Singh hit the winning boundary on his only ball of the tournament.Pakistan had earlier posted 146 all out after collapsing from 113/1 in 19.1 overs at Dubai International Cricket Stadium.

Partnerships between Tilak, Samson (24), and Dube then steadied the chase, with Varma and Dube adding a decisive 60 runs off 40 balls to secure victory.The final was also marked by continued tension between the teams.

Despite this, Team India found a way to celebrate, taking to social media to share their joy and mock the situation.The drama unfolded when Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman and Asian Cricket Council (ACC) president Mohsin Naqvi, who also serves as Pakistan’s interior minister, arrived to present the trophy and medals. The Indian team refused to accept them.Afterwards, BCCI secretary Devajit Saikia said, “We decided not to accept the Asia Cup 2025 trophy from the ACC chairman, who represents a country currently at odds with ours. That was our stance. But this does not give him the right to take the trophy and medals. It is extremely unfortunate and unsportsmanlike. We hope the trophy and medals are returned to India as soon as possible. We will launch a serious protest at the ICC conference in Dubai this November. ”The standoff delayed the presentation for over an hour.

India opener Abhishek Sharma credited head coach Gautam Gambhir and captain Suryakumar Yadav for backing him through the highs and lows of his early international career, saying their constant support allowed him to play fearless cricket in the Asia Cup 2025.Abhishek finished the tournament as the leading run-getter and won the Player of the Tournament award. He amassed 314 runs in seven innings with an explosive strike rate of 200. It was his six-hitting prowess that caught everyone's attention. The southpaw smoked 19 sixes in the tournament, the most by any batter.India 'lifted' the Asia Cup with a five-wicket win over Pakistan in the final, but the celebrations were tinged with controversy after the Asian Cricket Council (ACC) failed to present the champions with a trophy.Abhishek, however, brushed off the disappointment with a cheeky remark. “Obviously everyone has a plan to win a trophy. And we actually got one — Surya bhai brought it! We felt it, we knew its weight. The smiles in the dressing room and the atmosphere after the win matter more than anything else,” Abhishek said with a grin.Reflecting on his role in the tournament, Abhishek underlined the influence of Gambhir and Suryakumar in helping him develop the confidence to take risks at the top of the order.“I feel Surya bhai and Gautam sir have given me immense confidence. When you play with high risk, there will be failures. But the way they handled me, the way they spoke to me at that time — because of that, I am able to play this way. It is very important to have that kind of support,” he said.The 25-year-old was also full of praise for Suryakumar’s leadership during a challenging campaign.“I wanted to talk about Surya bhai first. As a batter, when you’re not scoring runs, it’s very difficult. But as captain, he never let it show. Whether he scored a hundred or got out early, he was always smiling, always leading from the front. That’s the best quality I’ve seen in him, and I want to learn that balance,” Abhishek noted.Looking back at his own journey, Abhishek said his rise has been full of ups and downs but insisted this was just the beginning. “I have done a lot of work on my game. To come into this team, I had to push myself harder. I think this is just the start for us as a group. There is a lot more to come — miracles will happen,” he said.","Abhishek finished the tournament as the leading run-getter and won the Player of the Tournament award.

Bayern Munich's Harry Kane achieved a remarkable milestone by scoring his 99th and 100th goals for the club in just 104 games during their 4-0 victory against Werder Bremen on Friday, reaching the century mark faster than football stars Cristiano Ronaldo and Erling Haaland did for their respective clubs.Kane's achievement came one game sooner than both Ronaldo, who needed 105 games to reach 100 goals for Real Madrid in 2011, and Haaland, who also took 105 games to hit the century mark for Manchester City last year.""It's crazy even for me, to be honest. Obviously it's an honor to reach 100 goals for this great club. A big thanks to all the staff, the players, everyone who helped me get to where I am. But 100 goals, to do it that quickly, is something I'm really proud of. But as I always say, it's on to the next one now and hopefully I can reach another hundred as soon as possible,"" Kane told broadcaster Sky.The match began with Jonathan Tah's backheel giving Bayern the lead, followed by Kane's first goal from a penalty in the 45th minute after being fouled by Marco Friedl. His landmark 100th goal came in the 65th minute from Luis Díaz's assist, making it 3-0.Kane's form has been exceptional this season, scoring 15 goals in eight games for Bayern in 2025-26, plus one goal for England against Serbia.He was substituted for Nicolas Jackson in the 78th minute, missing the chance for his third hat trick of the season. Konrad Laimer completed the scoring with Bayern's fourth goal in the 87th minute.""I honestly have to say that isn't a topic for us. We don't discuss that, we don't need to discuss that,"" coach Vincent Kompany told Sky when asked about Kane's potential return to the Premier League next year. ""What he's showing now is how he feels, I believe, and that was another nice moment for him today.""The victory strengthened Bayern's position at the top of the Bundesliga with their fifth consecutive win. They now prepare for their Champions League match against Pafos in Cyprus on Tuesday.Bremen currently sits in 14th place in the 18-team league and risks dropping into the relegation zone depending on weekend results.The match featured Bayern wearing a special grey and green Oktoberfest commemorative shirt, which prompted protests from fans.

Aston Villa secured their first win of the season with a 1-0 victory over Bologna in their Europa League opener, while Rangers suffered a 1-0 home defeat to Genk on Thursday, intensifying pressure on their manager Russell Martin. The matches marked the beginning of the Europa League campaign for both teams.Villa, despite being pre-tournament favorites and reaching the Champions League quarter-finals last season, had struggled with their form, failing to win any of their first five Premier League games. The victory came amid internal tensions, with manager Unai Emery recently criticizing his players and sporting director Monchi departing the club.John McGinn's strike in the 13th minute proved decisive for Villa. The Scotland international found the bottom corner with a shot from the edge of the area.Ollie Watkins, who started on the bench due to his goalless run this season, missed a penalty in the second half with Łukasz Skorupski making an easy save.Bologna came close to equalizing when Santiago Castro's header hit the crossbar, but Villa managed to hold on for the win, repeating their success against the Italian side from their previous Champions League encounter.""Important to get a win at home after not our strongest start to the season,"" McGinn said. ""We haven't been good enough. We've had a lot of praise the past couple of seasons and we're rightly being criticised at the minute.""Rangers' situation worsened as they played with ten men after Mohamed Diomande's red card before halftime for a dangerous challenge.Former Celtic striker Oh Hyeon-Gyu missed a penalty for Genk in first-half stoppage time but redeemed himself by scoring the winning goal ten minutes into the second half.Martin, who joined Rangers in June, has now gone eight games without a win in both Scottish Premiership and European competitions.In other Europa League matches, Lille secured a 2-1 victory over Norwegian side Brann with Olivier Giroud scoring the winner.American player Tanner Tessmann helped Lyon defeat Utrecht 1-0.Stuttgart emerged victorious with a 2-1 win over Celta Vigo.Porto claimed a 1-0 away victory against RB Salzburg.","Aston Villa secured their first win of the season with a 1-0 victory over Bologna.

Barcelona secured a 3-1 comeback victory against Real Oviedo in La Liga on Thursday, with Robert Lewandowski and Ronald Araujo scoring headers after Eric Garcia's equalizer cancelled out Alberto Reina's opening goal. The win keeps Barcelona two points behind league leaders Real Madrid.Barcelona fell behind in the 33rd minute when goalkeeper Joan Garcia's error allowed Reina to score from 40 yards out into an empty net. The Catalans equalized through Eric Garcia early in the second half.Substitute Lewandowski put Barcelona ahead with a header that went in off the crossbar from Frenkie de Jong's cross. Araujo sealed the victory in the 88th minute by heading in Marcus Rashford's corner.""In the second half, I said to my team, we have to continue, we have to play with calmness, to be convinced about playing with the ball, and we did it well,"" said Barcelona coach Hansi Flick.The victory marked Barcelona's fourth consecutive win across all competitions, achieved without injured star winger Lamine Yamal.Oviedo, playing in Spain's top flight for the first time since 2000/01, featured 40-year-old midfielder Santi Cazorla making his first start of the season.Rashford, who started on the left wing after being benched last weekend for tardiness to a team meeting, created several chances. Oviedo goalkeeper Aaron Escandell made multiple saves from his attempts.""I saw the goalkeeper's mistake and I went first time, and in the moment I kicked it, I saw it was good,"" Oviedo midfielder Reina told DAZN. ""My first in the top flight, I'll never forget it.""Flick defended his goalkeeper's mistake: ""It's the style that we want him to play in, and it can happen. He's a fantastic goalkeeper... one mistake and they use it, but it's football.""De Jong's introduction at halftime helped Barcelona increase their tempo. Escandell continued making saves from Raphinha and Torres before Lewandowski's breakthrough.""The changes were at the right time, with Frenkie and also with Lewy,"" said Flick.Lewandowski, who has mainly been used as a substitute this season following an early injury, showed patience: ""I'm patient, I'm not in a hurry, the season is long and we have a lot of games.""Despite the loss, Oviedo's goalscorer remained positive: ""All footballers dream of nights like this, to play against these players and with these fans.

Indian Women's League: Women-heavy coaching team for Sethu FC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/indian-womens-league-women-heavy-coaching-team-for-sethu-fc/articleshow/124130026.cms,"Rutuja Gunwant

CHENNAI: Indian Women’s League (IWL) club Sethu FC have appointed women in positions of power for the upcoming season. While Rutuja Gunwant has been roped in as the head coach, Kulsum Bi Shaikh and Surbhi Manjrekar have been anointed the head of women’s football and assistant coach respectively.The 2025-26 IWL is expected to begin in the first week of November and end in April, with the top-tier league taking a big break for the AFC Women’s Asian Cup – where the India senior team will compete – in Australia in March.Rutuja will fill the seat vacated by Arun Kumar, who had replaced Shareef Khan midway through the previous season. Rutuja had represented Sethu as a player in the club’s formative years and most recently served as a coach for the Gokulam Kerala FC women’s team. As for Kulsum, she was associated with Odisha FC in the last IWL season.“We felt that it would be better to hand over the coaching duties to a known face. We wanted to have people who are familiar with the system (Indian women’s football). I personally felt that women coaches would be able to handle our players in a better way. That is why we have gone with a women-heavy coaching and staff contingent this time,” Seeni Mohaideen, founder and owner of the Tamil Nadu-based club, told TOI on Thursday.Having finished a disappointing fifth in the previous IWL campaign, Sethu, champions of the 2018-19 season, are determined to once again battle for top honours. In the close season, they have shown ambition, securing the services of forward Lynda Kom and midfielder Grace Lalrampari by paying transfer fee to the now-relegated Odisha.Sethu have retained approximately 14 domestic players and are likely to sign two foreign outfield members – from Africa – and an overseas goalkeeper. “We have players who are part of the India team. We also have young talent in the squad, so it should be a good mix. Our ultimate goal is to get to the AFC Women’s Champions League (the IWL winners will have an opportunity to qualify for the tournament),” Seeni added.Seeni also stressed that the IWL clubs are finding it increasingly difficult to plan for the season ahead, due to lack of clarity regarding the schedule. “The fixtures are yet to be finalised by the AIFF, so we do not know when we will play our home matches. We need to book the stadium soon,” said Seeni while confirming that Chennai’s Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium will remain the club’s home venue.Sethu FC staff: Rutuja Gunwant (head coach), Kulsum Bi Shaikh (head of women’s football), Surbhi Manjrekar (assistant coach), Aadil Ansari (goalkeeping coach), John Mark Danny (strength and conditioning coach), Akshayaa (physiotherapist), Parthiban (head of operations).",Sethu FC appoint women in positions of power for the upcoming season.

(AP Photo/Jose Breton)

Antony's late goal denied Nottingham Forest a winning return to European football as Real Betis grabbed a 2-2 draw in their Europa League opener on Wednesday, while Roma won at Nice.Forest, managed by Ange Postecoglou who won the tournament with Tottenham last season, are playing in Europe for the first time in 30 years.They are only in the Europa League rather than the Conference League because English FA Cup winners Crystal Palace fell foul of UEFA 's rules governing multi-club ownership.Last season's Conference League runners-up Betis struck first in the 15th minute when Antony's pass picked out Cedric Bakambu inside the area, before the veteran striker turned and fired the ball into the roof of the net.But Forest levelled three minutes later as a sweeping move finished with Morgan Gibbs-White's low ball across the face of goal being tapped in from close range by Igor Jesus.Brazilian Igor Jesus, who scored his first goals for Forest since his summer move from Botafogo against Swansea last week, completed the turnaround midway through the first half with a clinical header from Douglas Luiz's corner.Postecoglou's men threatened to seize complete control before half-time, as Igor Jesus twice went close to a hat-trick and Callum Hudson-Odoi hit a shot against the post.Betis managed to stay in the game, though, and a period of late pressure paid dividends when Antony slotted in Marc Roca's ball at the back post with five minutes remaining.""I think first I should be proud of the players' efforts. It's a difficult place to come, difficult conditions,"" Postecoglou, still waiting for his first win in charge since replacing the sacked Nuno Espirito Santo, told TNT Sports.""The thing I could fault is we didn't put the game to bed.""Roma got their campaign for a first Europa League title under way with an impressive 2-1 victory at Nice.Gian Piero Gasperini's men, who have reached at least the semi-finals in three of the previous five seasons, secured a winning start thanks to two goals in the space of three second-half minutes from Evan Ndicka and Gianluca Mancini.Terem Moffi pulled one back for Nice from the penalty spot with 13 minutes to play, but Roma held on.Local authorities and prosecutors said 102 people identified as Roma ultras, many of whom caught with potential weapons, were arrested in the build-up to the game for intending to commit violence.Celtic, playing in the competition for the first time since 2021 after an embarrassing loss to Kairat Almaty in Champions League qualifying, were held to a 1-1 draw by fellow former European champions Red Star Belgrade in Serbia.A long spell of Celtic pressure at the start of the first half culminated in Kelechi Iheanacho's second goal since signing on a free transfer from Sevilla earlier this month.Red Star hit back, though, in the 65th minute as Marko Arnautovic turned in Franklin Tebo Uchenna's cross.Elsewhere, Dinamo Zagreb beat Fenerbahce 3-1 in the Croatian capital, while Bundesliga side Freiburg clinched a 2-1 home win over Basel.",Nottingham Forest held 2-2 by Real Betis in Europa League opener.

Each winner of the #MexicoCityEPrix from the past three seasons has gone on to become World Champion.”The special poster features 2023 Formula E World Champion Jake Dennis from Andretti, then TAG Heuer Porsche’s Pascal Wehrlein, who won in 2024, and the new World Champion, Nissan driver Oliver Rowland. All three of them won in the Mexico E-Prix and went on to lift the winner’s trophy in the Formula E World Championship that year.Oliver Rowland had strengthened his chances of winning the Formula E World Championship this year much earlier. He was leading the Formula E Driver Standings ever since he won Part 2 of the Jeddah E-Prix, which was his second win of the season after winning the Mexico E-Prix. In the last leg, the Nissan driver got nervous for a while as Pascal Wehrlein, who was following him in the number two position, closed the gap after grabbing quite a few podiums while Rowland had a dull period.Things became serious for Rowland when he failed to finish the Round 13 race in Berlin, while Wehrlein won second spot on the podium. But he eventually managed to confirm his championship in Berlin after four wins and three more podiums.Sharing about his bad race in Berlin, Rowland had said, “I was hoping before the weekend that the outcome could be [the World Championship], but after yesterday (Saturday) and this morning (Sunday), I was more worried that it might never come.”Also Read: Oliver Rowland reacts to daughter’s sweet radio message after Formula E Championship win: “It’s amazing” Things, however, changed for Wehrlein, who was pushed to third position after Nick Cassidy made a late entry in the Formula E Driver Standings by registering three consecutive wins. He was pushed from second place to third, with Cassidy in second. Wehrlein registered one win and five more podiums this season.Meanwhile, Andretti driver Jake Dennis finished in seventh position in the Formula E Driver Standings. He won two podium spots this season.","All three Formula E drivers who won the Mexico City E-Prix went on to win the Formula E World Championship that season.

Taylor Barnard on losing top three spot in Formula E World Championship

Fans hail Taylor Barnard for his fantastic rookie season

It was Taylor Barnard’s rookie season this year, and the NEOM McLaren driver put up a fantastic performance by temporarily making it to the top three in the Formula E Driver Standings by ousting the much more experienced Porsche driver Antonio Felix Da Costa.

Taking 0 points away as a team from a doubleheader hurts, but one weekend doesn’t define the year we’ve had.”He further wrote, “As the season closes, I want to say a massive thank you to the entire team, both trackside and behind the scenes, for everything this season. Finishing P4 in the Drivers’ Championship and coming into the final weekend with a shot at runner-up is something to be proud of.”Also adding a note for teammate Sam Bird, as NEOM McLaren withdrew from Formula E after the end of the season, Barnard wrote, “@sambird_official it wasn’t the weekend you deserved either.You’ve been a huge part of my season both on and off the track, and I’m grateful for everything. You deserved more. To all the Papaya fans, thank you for the incredible support in our final race together. You always go above and beyond. ”Reacting to his post, a fan wrote, “An incredible debut season, huge congrats and excited to see where you go next!” Another said, “I know I said it the other day, but you’ve been incredible to watch this last year and a pleasure to support you in Papaya — there are many of us that can’t wait to support you in whatever you do next!” One more commented, “You were incredible all season around, Taylor.

We couldn’t have done it without you all — your trust and support have never been taken for granted,” he added.Praising the two McLaren drivers, he wrote, “Sam clinched McLaren’s first-ever fully electric win at the São Paulo E-Prix in Season 10, pulling off one of Formula E’s all-time great overtakes, before being waved across the line by none other than Emerson Fittipaldi – McLaren's first Formula 1 World Champion. While Taylor has been a rookie sensation in Season 11, securing five Formula E records, including the youngest driver to start a race, the youngest points scorer, the youngest driver to lead a lap, the youngest podium finisher, and the youngest polesitter. ”He ended the letter saying, “Some of us have been together since the day we first launched this team, while others have seamlessly fitted in along the way and flourished within the environment we have cultivated. For many, I am sure that we will cross paths again soon, but whatever the future holds for those here at Bicester, whatever path they choose to follow, I have no doubt that it will be bright.

The partnership extension will provide a year-round opportunity for brand-building and activation, communicating ABB and its technology solutions to new global audiences, including Formula E’s international fanbase.ABB and Formula E will also join hands to engage a new generation of fans, collaborating with unexpected influencers and content creators to tell compelling stories that make advanced electrification and automation technologies tangible and exciting.The end of the mid-race car swap, a 150kW increase in power, top speeds that are 43 percent higher, and energy recovery increasing from 15 to 50 percent indicate how far Formula E technology has come to outperform on track.ABB has also built on its technical involvement in the series, supplying the race chargers from Season 9, and introducing its ABB Ability OPTIMAX® energy management software (Season 9) and Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) technology (Season 5) to the sport.ABB Head of Brand Paco Liebrand said, “We are pleased to be continuing our partnership with Formula E which, like ABB, is striving for a leaner and cleaner future. The synergy between the two organizations, combined with the global appeal of the Championship, makes it a great platform to promote our brand positioning.”He further said, “Formula E is increasingly working with content creators, influencers, and celebrities, with initiatives such as the Evo Sessions making an impact through digital channels beyond the racing itself, which is also an essential part of ABB’s new brand strategy. Going forward, we will be enhancing the way we harness the benefits of this collaboration, ensuring the focus is on delivering content and activations that reinforce our new messaging, build familiarity, and tell the ‘Engineered to Outrun’ story. ”Formula E Chief Revenue Officer Tiziana Di Gioia said, “Our renewed partnership with ABB is a testament to the commercial power and benefit of Formula E as a global platform that drives both brand and business growth. ABB, like our wider partnership portfolio, has and continues to see enormous value in collaborating with the fastest-growing motorsport on the planet, with viewership, commercial integration, and brand storytelling continuing to accelerate.

Croatian tennis legend Nikola Pilic, the pioneering coach who trained Novak Djokovic and the only captain to lead three countries to Davis Cup glory, has died at the age of 86, the Croatian Tennis Association announced on Tuesday. Pilic passed away on Monday in the western Croatian town of Opatija.Born in Split in 1939, Pilic began representing the Yugoslav youth national team just four years after starting tennis. He went on to dominate national competitions, winning five Yugoslav singles titles, seven doubles crowns, and one mixed doubles championship. His greatest achievement on the court came in 1973 when he finished runner-up at the French Open to Ilie Nastase. He also claimed the US Open doubles title in 1970 alongside Pierre Barthes.Pilic was already a prominent figure when tennis turned professional in 1968, becoming one of the first eight men, dubbed the “Handsome Eight,” to sign with Lamar Hunt’s World Championship Tennis tour. He reached a career-high singles ranking of No. 6 and won nine singles titles along the way.Off the court, Pilic’s influence was even greater. After retiring in 1978, he enjoyed a distinguished coaching career, leading Germany to Davis Cup triumphs in 1988, 1989, and 1993, guiding Croatia to victory in 2005, and serving as an adviser when Serbia won in 2010.His academy near Munich nurtured future stars including Michael Stich, Goran Ivanisevic, and Novak Djokovic, who affectionately called Pilic his “tennis dad.” In 1999, Djokovic’s first coach Jelena Gencic sent the young player to train under Pilic, shaping the foundation for his 24 Grand Slam titles.“Nikola Niki Pilic will be remembered as the only captain ever to lead three different nations to Davis Cup titles,” the Croatian Tennis Association said. His contributions were recognised with a Lifetime Achievement Award from Croatia in 2019 and Serbia’s Gold Medal of Merit in 2020.",Croatian tennis legend Nikola Pilic has died at the age of 86.

Team World def. Team Europe 15-9

Taylor Fritz held off Alexander Zverev 6-3, 7-6 (7/4) to seal Team World's triumph in the Laver Cup on Sunday as two wins for Carlos Alcaraz on the final day proved too little for Team Europe.Fritz fired a backhand volley winner on his first match point to give Team World a 15-9 victory over Europe in the global tennis event, sparking jubilant celebrations from his teammates and World captain Andre Agassi at Chase Center -- home of the NBA's Golden State Warriors.""The energy from the team, it just feels the moments of winning feel so much better, the moments of losing feel so much worse because you're doing it for all these guys,"" Fritz said.""It just fires me up so much,"" added the fifth-ranked American, who had beaten Alcaraz on Saturday when Team World swept all four matches to seize a 9-3 lead.Fritz had raced through the opening set against a weary-looking Zverev.The German stepped it up in the second set, but he was down a break and trailing 4-3 before he finally mustered his first break points of the night.He converted his third to level the set at 4-4 to the delight of his Europe teammates and captain Yannick Noah.A quick hold from Zverev left Fritz serving to stay in the set.He held to love and they battled to the tiebreaker, where Fritz took a 3-0 lead only for Zverev to win three straight points before Fritz won four of the final five.Alcaraz, fresh off his sixth Grand Slam title at the US Open, had kept Europe's title defense alive with a blistering 6-2, 6-1 victory over Argentina's Francisco Cerundolo.Alcaraz and Casper Ruud had sliced Europe's deficit with a 7-6 (7/4), 6-1 doubles victory over Reilly Opelka and Alex Michelsen to open Sunday's action.But Australian world number eight Alex De Minaur then beat Czech Jakub Mensik 6-3, 6-4 to push Team World's lead to 12-6, with 13 points needed to claim the Cup and each match on Sunday worth three points.De Minaur, a late replacement on Team World for Frances Tiafoe, had nabbed two wins on Saturday -- beating Zverev in singles and coming through again in doubles.Team World regained the title they surrendered to Europe last year in Berlin.Europe have won five of eight editions of the event co-created by Swiss great Roger Federer , which will be held in London next year.Ruud def.

SHENZHEN: Jasmine Paolini beat Jessica Pegula on the fourth match point as defending champion Italy won the Billie Jean King Cup with a comprehensive victory over the United States on Sunday.Italy won both singles ties in straight sets, meaning there was no need for a decisive doubles match. The No. 8-ranked Paolini beat seventh-ranked Pegula 6-4, 6-2 after No. 91 Elisabetta Cocciaretto won 6-4, 6-4 against Emma Navarro, breaking her serve three times.Paolini broke Pegula's serve with a two-hand backhand down the line to take the first set and move Italy closer to success at the Shenzhen Bay Sports Center Arena in China.But with Paolini serving for the match at 5-1 she wavered a little. Pegula saved three match points and then two unforced errors from Paolini allowed Pegula to break back to 5-2 down.A strong looping forehand gave Paolini - the runner-up at the French Open and Wimbledon last year - a fourth match point and she took it, clinching victory when Pegula's two-handed backhand clipped the net and landed wide.Paolini raised her arms in the air, then walked over to hug her teammates.All the staff members joined them on the court as they danced in a circle before celebrating with blue-shirted, flag-waving Italy fans.Pegula and Navarro each came from a set down to defeat Britain and reach the final.But not this time.Italy boasted a doubles pairing of Olympic champions Paolini and Sara Errani, who also won the French Open doubles together this year. They would have faced Pegula and top-ranked doubles player Taylor Townsend in what might have been an exciting trophy decider.The BJK Cup was formerly known as the Fed Cup, and the United States is the most successful team as an 18-time winner, but not since 2017.Italy was contesting its third straight final and clinched its sixth title.

Poll Do you think it’s important for public figures like Bjorn Borg to share personal struggles with addiction? Absolutely, it can inspire others Yes, but only if they feel comfortable Not really, it's their personal life

Swedish tennis icon Bjorn Borg has made a deeply personal revelation in his newly released autobiography Heartbeats: A Memoir, published on Thursday, disclosing his long-hidden battles with cocaine addiction and a recent prostate cancer diagnosis.The 69-year-old former world No.1, who dominated tennis in the 1970s and early 1980s, confessed that his first experience with cocaine in the early 1980s at New York’s legendary nightclub Studio 54 gave him “a rush as strong as what tennis had given me in the past.”His darkest years, Borg recounts, came in the 1990s when he was living in Milan with then-wife, Italian singer Loredana Bertè. “We had bad influences, and… drugs and pills within reach. There, I was plunged into the deepest darkness,” Borg writes.The low point arrived in 1996, when Borg collapsed on a bridge in the Netherlands just before an exhibition tournament. “When I awoke in hospital, my father was standing next to me. He said nothing, it was so embarrassing. I was terribly ashamed,” he told Swedish talk show Skavlan.In the memoir, Borg also reveals that he was diagnosed with prostate cancer in September 2023.“The risk of it coming back still exists, and it’s something I will have to live with… with the anxiety of not knowing if the cancer was caught in time,” he wrote, adding that he undergoes check-ups every six months.Despite his health challenges, Borg stressed that he exercises daily, though he admitted he has not “played tennis in six years.”The 11-time Grand Slam champion also touched on doping in modern tennis, expressing concern about junior players and questioning Jannik Sinner’s decision to rehire fitness coach Umberto Ferrara after the Italian’s brief suspension for a steroid violation.Borg, who retired shockingly at just 26 after conquering Wimbledon five times and the French Open six times, said his memoir is about confronting demons, shame, and survival.",Tennis great Bjorn Borg has released his autobiography Heartbeats: A Memoir.

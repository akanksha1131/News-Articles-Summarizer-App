LIVE: R Ashwin retires: Is India’s spin future in safe hands? | India vs Australia

NEW DELHI: Tributes have been flowing in ever since star Indian allrounder Ravichandran Ashwin announced his retirement from international cricket.Ashwin made the announcement on Wednesday at a hastily-called media conference following the drawn Test between Australia and India at the Gabba in Brisbane for the ongoing Border-Gavaskar Trophy .Ashwin played 106 Tests for India since his 2011 debut, taking 537 wickets. He took more wickets against Australia than any other country, with 115 at 28.58 in 23 Tests against them.On Friday, the Indian cricket board ( BCCI ) shared a heartfelt tribute to Ashwin who finished seventh on the all-time list for most wickets and second only to Anil Kumble (619) for India.The video shows Ashwin taking his first wicket in Test cricket and goes through with the spinner grabbing his 200th, 300th, 400th and 500th Test wickets apart from also reaching one of his six Test hundreds.Ashwin says in the video, ""Look I don't know here to begin honestly, I think I made myself a promise in 2012, we lost a series against England, a tricky one, it was very early in my career and I was just telling myself we are not going to lose another one. Ever. And that's what I promised myself.""Ashwin, the only Indian allrounder to score 3000 runs and take 500 wickets, formed a deadly combination with Ravindra Jadeja which was the cornerstone of India's decade-long Test domination at home. The duo became a nightmare for visiting teams on the turning tracks in India.A clip from 2016 has Ashwin saying, ""All I would like to do is to enjoy my game here, my name is announced to come out to bowl or bat, the way the crowd will erupt is something I really look forward to.""Ashwin ceased to be a regular feature in the Test XI overseas but ended with 154 away wickets.A clip from 2019 has Ashwin saying, ""I believe I need to keep improving as a cricketer. It's been a magical season and it's going to be pretty difficult to replicate this again.""Ashwin was more than a handy batter, scoring 3,503 runs with six centuries and 14 fifties.Cut to 2021 and Ashwin says, ""It's been a sort of a dreamy ride, it's been a fairytale I must say.""India's 12-year home supremacy and their 2020-21 Border-Gavaskar Trophy victory in Australia were both greatly aided by Ashwin.A clip from 2021 has Ashwin saying, ""How many ever wickets you take, how many ever runs you make, in ten years time you won't remember them, it's the memories that matters.""Ashwin shares the record for 11 Player-of-the-Series accolades with the legendary Muttiah Muralitharan of Sri Lanka and is one of only 11 all-rounders with 3000 Test runs and 300 wickets.Ashwin continues in the video, ""But if somebody had told me in 2011 that I would be getting so many wickets, I'd be retiring on 2024 December, the 18th, I wouldn't have believed them because I knew that this is the game that I love but I never did expect that I would get so much so love, so many wickets and so many runs as well. I'm very glad, deep sense of gratitude for everyone that supported me, everyone that's challenged me. So happy today. Thank you.""Ashwin also played 116 one-day and 65 Twenty20 internationals and was a part of the sides that won the ODI World Cup in 2011 and the Champions Trophy in 2013.","Ashwin played 106 Tests for India since his 2011 debut, taking 537 wickets. He finished seventh on the all-time list for most wickets and second only to Anil Kumble (619) for India. He took more wickets against Australia than any other country, with 115 at 28.58.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116521034,imgsize-91226,width-400,resizemode-4/116521034.jpg"

NEW DELHI: There's no denying the fact that the Aussies are in awe of India pace spearhead and vice-captain Jasprit Bumrah With 21 scalps from 3 Tests in the ongoing Border-Gavaskar Trophy , Bumrah is the top wicket-taker in the series against Australia.Talking to TOI, former Australia captain Allan Border expressed his admiration of Bumrah and his rare art.""Bumrah, these days, is on that pedestal. His wrists, his release points are different to other bowlers. Because of that hyperextension, he's releasing the ball a foot further down than other bowlers. He's got a unique shuffling run-up, and then the snap of these wrists, he's amazing. Being different, plus having that skill, it's a whole different level of difficulty for the batsman,"" Border said.Bumrah became India's top Test wicket-taker in Australia during the third Test in Brisbane, surpassing the great Kapil Dev , grabbing nine wickets to surpass the legendary pacer's record of 51 and reach 53 in Australia.Bumrah was the player of the match in India's 295-run triumph in Perth in the first Test.With 21 wickets in the series thus far at an almost unbelievable average of 10.90, he is the most prolific bowler on both sides.On a bouncing Perth wicket, Bumrah, who was captaining the first Test in the absence of Rohit Sharma , made life miserable for the Australian batters.Border added, ""Bumrah will do a very good job (as captain). In Perth, he used himself properly. Captaincy-wise, the way he set the fields, you couldn't fault him.""Australia were dismissed for 104 in Perth after Bumrah took 5-30 from 18 overs. In the second innings, he added 3-42 to help India win by 295 runs.On fast bowlers as captains, Border said, ""It's a tough one, because after your over, you need to go down to fine leg for a break and a drink! As captain, you can't do that. You need to be at mid-on, directing the field. But Bumrah did well, he's aggressive as a bowler, but not as aggressive as a person. He's always got that smile on his face. Cummins too.""",Jasprit Bumrah is the top wicket-taker in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy series.

Top-order woes force Aussies to make big changes ahead of

Boxing Day Test

Stadium Walkthrough series: Inside The Gabba

MELBOURNE: There seems to be little cheer in the Aussie camp ahead of the Christmas weekend. After making all the right noises in support of their new opener, the George Bailey-led selection committee has made an about-turn and dropped the struggling Nathan McSweeney for the remainder of the series.McSweeney's continuing troubles against Jasprit Bumrah meant a call-up for 19-year-old Sam Konstas , who will now shoulder the team's opening burden at a crucial stage in the series. The other senior under-performing opener, Usman Khawaja , retains his place for now.Bailey cited ""the need to throw something different at India"" and Konstas, if he opens at the MCG, will get the chance to show he has the steel for the top rung after having been in fine form this season.The New South Wales opener was overlooked at the start of the series in spite of becoming the youngest player since Ricky Ponting to hit twin tons in a Sheffield Shield game-152 and 105 against South Australia in Sydney in Oct. He also scored a 107 for the PM's XI in the tour game against the Indians and an 88 against Western Australia earlier this month while averaging 55.83 this season.Konstas will become the fourth-youngest debutant for Australia in Tests if he gets a game at the MCG. Josh Inglis and Beau Webster have also been retained in the squad as reserve batters.""I acknowledge that it's a tough call on Nathan,"" Bailey said on Friday. ""It's been a challenge at the top of the order for both teams. I think Sam's method, his style, is different to Nathan's, providing the option of a different look and a different make-up for the XI come Boxing Day. We'd like the ability to throw something different at India.""Standing in the path of Australia's newest batting sensation will be Bumrah, who dismissed the 25-year-old McSweeney four out of six times in the series.McSweeney can be said to have got a raw deal, since he was thrust into the role of Test opener and had not opened at first-class level before this season. He now leaves with an average of 14.40 from three Tests, with the crucial 39 in Adelaide as his highest, but he hasn't been the only one struggling in the top order across both teams. The 38-year-old Khawaja has even less runs, averaging 12.6 with a highest of 21 in the first innings in Brisbane, and looked equally at sea against Bumrah. Jhye Richardson , meanwhile, has earned a recall in place of the injured Josh Hazlewood, though Scott Boland is expected to walk into the XI in the fourth Test. Speedster Sean Abbott is also back in the squad.Since David Warner's retirement, Khawaja has been paired with makeshift openers Steve Smith and McSweeney with little success. Australia's openers have contributed 243 runs at an average of 22 from 14 innings since saying goodbye to Warner, meaning Konstas has to now shoulder some big responsibilities on his teen shoulders.SQUAD: Pat Cummins (C), Sean Abbott, Scott Boland, Alex Carey, Travis Head, Josh Inglis, Usman Khawaja, Sam Konstas, Marnus Labuschagne, Nathan Lyon, Mitchell Marsh, Jhye Richardson, Steve Smith, Mitchell Starc, Beau Webster",Nathan McSweeney dropped for remainder of series against India.

Stadium Walkthrough series: Inside The Gabba

Excerpts from an interview...

In your playing days, you were one of the fittest around, playing 153 consecutive Tests.

You led in 93 Tests, second only to Graeme Smith's 109...

Your batting made Australia a powerhouse, but in that World Cup win (1987), it was your left-arm spin that caused Mike Gatting's brain fade.

When you see today's cricketers pulling off these extraordinary shots with such ease, what's your reaction?

Is T20 changing Tests, or do these shots just wow more when played in the longer format?

And you still need your openers to blunt the new ball…

Do you like what you see about

?

In the early days of your captaincy, Australia was in a period of tough transition. How did you go about the leadership at that point in time? The current Indian and Australian teams are facing a similar situation, with so many senior players who can't go on for too much longer. What's the best way to rebuild?

Define 'a bit'? How much time are you prepared to give that potential?

We no longer have a leg-spinner calling the shots in an Australian home summer. Wasn't Australia supposed to be the land of leg-spin with its hard, bouncy pitches?

So T20's idea of containment has seeped through to Test captains?

As a fielder, you always had a fantastic, fast throw that threw the batsman off.

The most difficult bowler you faced?

You spoke about Bumrah lighting up this series.

Bumrah captained in Perth, might captain India again in future...

How do you look at pacer-captains in general?

is another.

Modern batters talk a lot about the problems of having to adjust to different formats. Did you make too many technical adjustments on the fly?

How do you remember the tied Test (Madras, Sept '86)?

MELBOURNE: We are sitting at the rain soaked Gabba as the third Test drips away to meaninglessness. The legendary Allan Border, one of Australia's most durable captains, one of their most determined and prolific batsmen, is lounging on a sofa, staring at the TV screen. There was a time when it was hard to imagine an Australian team without Border as leader. He stepped up at a difficult time, adapted to the role and by the time he left, Australian cricket had metamorphosed into the relentless winning machine it is today.It's not for nothing that Australia's cricketer of the year gets to wear the Allan Border medal. Border is now 69, his memory still sharp as a razor's edge. He is concerned, though, when asked about his personal health. ""Oh, man,"" he sighs. ""I mean, you know I've got Parkinson's Disease. I'm not 100%. Luckily, I've got good medical help."" The talk moves on to cricketing matters, and Border is himself again.Alastair Cook has the most (159). I was very fortunate as far as injury is concerned. The times I did have injury was in the off season. I didn't ever miss games because of injury. That's luck. Occasionally I'd have an injury that I probably shouldn't have played with, but I did, like a broken finger.I just loved the game! So even if there was a little niggle, you tried and played if it wasn't debilitating. If you had sort of like a knee (issue), you could always field at slip.I'd probably have bowled more if I wasn't captain. It wasn't necessarily a plan to get 'Gat' out. He was batting well. He had taken to our spinner, Tim May. If you remember, he had hit a few boundaries and was starting to look comfortable. I didn't have another spin option. I thought, if I come on, 'Gat' might think, 'I don't want to get out to a part-timer.' So, he might change the way he plays. The way I set the field, I knew he was going to try and hit me through the offside. I bowled way outside leg stump, and he had predetermined to play the reverse sweep. It was just so wide, he had to really reach for it and got the top edge. It would have been called wide for sure!Those days, we hadn't seen the reverse sweep very often. The guys in England had started to play it in county cricket, because they used to have seven-two fields. That's how it started. I look at it positively. Even in this series, we've seen how Travis Head walks in and the game changes. All of a sudden, you've got a deep point, deep backward square. He's attacking the bowling, attacking even Jasprit Bumrah . I'm watching and thinking, 'It's amazing.'Head looks like he's batting on a different pitch because he's being aggressive. He's backing his ability to play the right shot to the right ball. He might still block a ball or let it go, but his mindset is to attack. Rishabh (Pant) is the same. All the players who seem to be having some success on these difficult pitches have this aggressive mindset. I'm not in awe, but I really respect that mindset. I know myself. I was probably the other way. I would go more defensive.The contest between bat and ball is better in Tests. In T20s, they're trying to take the ball out of the game. They want to see aggressive batting. The bowler is secondary. In Tests, the bowling has a big say. I'm a real fan of Tests for that reason. It's a better contest between bat and ball, a truer contest rather than a game set up purely for batting and power hitting. Just look at Bumrah. His presence has lit up this series. I like T20 for what it brings, but it's a different crowd. I don't think it has hurt Test cricket.That's why I say you've always had guys like Travis. You think back to different eras, we've had guys who've been attacking players. You've also had guys at the top of the order that take the shine off the new ball. Pujara, for example, from the last two series. It was fantastic the way he blunted the bowling. The rest of the players could bat around him. In T20, you can't have that.I like the backstory. We're talking about a really tough kid here. For him, with his struggles, to get to the Test team of a country with 1.2 billion people, it's unbelievable. He's got incredible talent, obviously that's come through. He'll have his moments because he's new. People haven't seen much of him. It'll take a while for bowlers to start working him out. He's going to be the sort of player who might go through a little (bad) patch, then work himself out and come back a better player. I think he's very good.All Australia's players are 30-plus. They have a rebuild that will have to happen over the next few years. What you don't want to do is push it. You want to try and do it gradually.When I think back to 1985, 1986, that period, and two years before that, with Greg Chappell, Dennis Lilee, Rod Marsh, they all went together in one Test (SCG, 1984). The next day we're playing, they're not there. Then we had guys going to South Africa, so they're not playing for Australia. It was a real difficult period in that you changed the whole side. It takes a while to build up.What we did wrong initially in that period was chop and change the side. Every time someone missed out once or twice, it was 'move on, move on'. Next, next, next. That's a totally wrong thing. You've got to try and identify players. Even if it's just potential, if you identify that, you can stick with that for a bit.You can't give someone a year, two years. You can give them a series. You can tell pretty quickly if someone is cut out for it over three Test matches. Two Tests are not enough, three probably is. And then you wait and watch and see their development. It took Steve Waugh a couple of years to find his mark. He ended up getting dropped and then coming back a very, very good player. Nearly everyone who has an international career has been dropped at some stage. Even Bradman. If it's happened to Bradman, you shouldn't worry about yourself.I'm surprised India haven't brought (Yuzvendra) Chahal or Kuldeep Yadav . It's hard to develop a leg-spinner. A Shane Warne doesn't come along every day. I don't think captains use leg-spinners very well. They want them to be like Warne, crowding men around the bat, on the attack. I see captains bring on a leggie and they've got bat-pad, two slips and a gully.Captains are very defensive. They need to realize it's going to take a while for a young leg-spinner to develop. You need to give him protection. He's going to bowl one half-tracker or a full toss. They don't necessarily get blokes out bat-pad or caught at slip. You've got to have the captaincy to bring the best out of a leggie. Finger spinners are tighter. It's a containment thing, and then you wait for the batsmen to get themselves out. Whereas with the leggie, the tendency is to be a bit loose. Warney was different because he was very accurate and could spin the ball. That just shows how hard that art is to master.Yes, but the best way to contain is to take wickets. In T20, guys are going to attack. You don't have to be over-attacking. If you spin a little bit and the guy can't pick you, that'd be a lot of T20 wickets!I was a baseballer in my younger days. Baseball is based on good throws. When I was a kid, baseball was a winter game, cricket was the summer game. I played both. It's a good complimentary game for cricket. These days kids pick their sport. In my day you could play three, four sports. I learnt how to get to the ball quickly and get rid of it quickly. That's baseball.Malcom Marshall. He wasn't very tall, but he skidded on a bit. He would drop his pace when he could swing it a little bit, but then he could bowl rapidly as well. All those West Indians were tough, but Marshall had a very fast arm and was tough to pick.Bumrah, these days, is on that pedestal. His wrists, his release points are different to other bowlers. Because of that hyperextension, he's releasing the ball a foot further down than other bowlers. He's got a unique shuffling run-up, and then the snap of these wrists, he's amazing. Being different, plus having that skill, it's a whole different level of difficulty for the batsman.He'll do a very good job. In Perth, he used himself properly. Captaincy-wise, the way he set the fields, you couldn't fault him.It's a tough one, because after your over, you need to go down to fine leg for a break and a drink! As captain, you can't do that. You need to be at mid-on, directing the field. But Bumrah did well, he's aggressive as a bowler, but not as aggressive as a person. He's always got that smile on his face. Cummins too.No. The One-Day game wasn't played differently, we'd just be more aggressive towards the end of the innings. We didn't really change our games too much. Whereas now, going from T20 to Tests is tough.Maninder (Singh) still says he got a little inside edge (laughs). Can they take out the old footage and do a 'Snicko' on it? I suppose not. We had a couple of heroes. One was Deano with his double hundred. But a lot of people forget Greg Matthews. He got 10 wickets. We declared at 574/7 in our first innings and we still should have lost the game. It just shows how long, drawn out periods in Test cricket can still produce a fantastic game. We should have lost in the last afternoon, but we just somehow hung in there.I was very worried about Ravi (Shastri). Ravi was someone who was just going to wait, wait, wait and then hit the last ball. But then he took that single, you know. Why? I've never asked him, I think I should! I think his theory was, if I took that single and tied the scores, then Maninder would somehow get bat on ball, perhaps.We didn't deserve to win, because we made two declarations, and India, to their credit, kept going for the win. That tactical to and fro, the way Ravi played, it was tremendous. Every time we got ahead, he would go boom boom and push the field back.Sunny (Gavaskar) played one of the best knocks I've ever seen. It was like a cover-drive clinic. I've never seen Sunny bat better. He made 90. I know he has bigger scores but in the context of this game, where you need 348 on the last day and he starts off at No. 1, makes 90 quickly, you're in the game then, aren't you?","Allan Border, Australia's greatest captain, talks to TOI about the perils of rapid chopping & changing, how aggressive batting has ruled in this series & the rare art of batting.

Australia squad:

NEW DELHI: Ahead of the Boxing Day Test against India, Australian selectors have called up uncapped teenager Sam Konstas , aiming to inject a fresh dynamic into their top-order batting. Selection chair George Bailey explained the decision, emphasizing the need for a different approach to counter India’s formidable pace attack.Bailey acknowledged that Australia’s current top three - Usman Khawaja Nathan McSweeney , and Marnus Labuschagne - have struggled to keep the scoreboard moving, with strike rates of 46.3, 33.9, and 33.2 respectively in the series.""You can say the way our top three have been playing has been reasonably similar, and we'd like the ability to throw something different at India,"" Bailey said. ""If you look more broadly, I don’t think necessarily the top six has functioned to the level that we need in this series as a whole.""By comparison, India’s top three - KL Rahul, Yashasvi Jaiswal, and Shubman Gill - have adopted a more aggressive approach, striking above 50 runs per 100 balls faced. This disparity in intent has highlighted the need for Australia to counterattack rather than merely survive against Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Siraj’s relentless pace.Bailey noted that Konstas’ batting style offers a point of difference: ""I think Sam’s method and style is different to Nathan’s... and different again to Beau (Webster) and Josh (Inglis) as the other batting options within that squad.""While Konstas is in contention for a debut, other options include reshuffling the order or promoting auxiliary batter Josh Inglis to open - a role he has filled in white-ball formats but never in first-class cricket.The selectors also bolstered the squad with all-rounder Beau Webster and pacers Sean Abbott and Jhye Richardson, considering the three-day turnaround between the Melbourne and Sydney Tests.""Looking forward, Melbourne-Sydney is clearly a quick turnaround. We’re just making sure we’ve got options between those two Tests,"" he said.The Boxing Day Test at the MCG, with the series tied 1-1, promises to be a litmus test for Australia’s revamped lineup.Pat Cummins (c), Travis Head (vc), Steve Smith (vc), Sean Abbott, Scott Boland, Alex Carey, Josh Inglis, Usman Khawaja, Sam Konstas, Marnus Labuschagne, Nathan Lyon, Mitchell Marsh, Jhye Richardson, Mitchell Starc, Beau Webster","Australian selectors call up uncapped teenager Sam Konstas for Boxing Day Test.

One gate would be towards India, the other gate would be towards Pakistan.

NEW DELHI: Indian spin legend Harbhajan Singh has shared how his once-bitter feud with Australian all-rounder Andrew Symonds evolved into a deep friendship, highlighting how one of cricket's most infamous scandals ended on a positive note.The 2007-08 Test series between India and Australia was marred by the ""Monkeygate"" controversy, where Symonds accused Harbhajan of racially abusing him during the Sydney Test. The allegation led to Harbhajan being handed a three-match ban, later reduced after appeals. The saga nearly derailed India's tour of Australia, with tensions flaring on and off the field.Despite the acrimony, the pair eventually reconciled after being teammates for the Mumbai Indians in the Indian Premier League IPL ). Harbhajan recounted how their friendship began when Symonds visited his home in Chandigarh with a bottle of Bundaberg Rum, a gesture that broke the ice between the two rivals.""We sat together for a long, long time and talked about it. At the end of the conversation, we had a long hug,"" Harbhajan said in an interview with Code Sports. ""The picture of the hug became very famous in our chat groups. A very ugly spat became a great friendship.""Reflecting on the incident, Harbhajan admitted the controversy should never have escalated to the level it did. ""That Sydney thing should never have exploded like it did. We did sort out everything. We left the controversy behind and went on to win the IPL championship together,"" he said.Harbhajan also expressed profound grief over Symonds' untimely death in a car crash in May 2022 at the age of 46.""When I heard the news of his accident, I just hoped it was false. I couldn't believe it,"" Harbhajan said. ""I was shattered. When I was in Brisbane last week, I thought if he were still alive, I'd have gone to his place that night, and we would have gone out. That's the bond we shared.""The two cricketers' journey from animosity to camaraderie serves as a testament to the transformative power of sports and mutual respect. Harbhajan concluded by emphasizing the enduring impact of Symonds on his life, saying, ""Andrew is missed every day.""","Indian spin legend Harbhajan Singh has shared how his once-bitter feud with Australian all-rounder Andrew Symonds evolved into a deep friendship. The 2007-08 Test series between India and Australia was marred by the ""Monkeygate"" controversy. Symonds accused Har Bhajan of racially abusing him during the Sydney Test. The saga nearly derailed India's tour of Australia, with tensions flaring on and off the field.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116495495,imgsize-38336,width-400,resizemode-4/116495495.jpg"

Amid talk of transition, the spotlight will be on India's underperforming middle order heading into the fourth Test. Australia share similar concerns, but it's their top order that's facing the heat

Rohit Sharma press conference: On Ashwin, Gabba draw and his form

MELBOURNE: Will the abrupt manner of Ravichandran Ashwin 's exit from the international arena affect India's spirit? Will Australia find all the negative talk about the top order overwhelming? These are the two major questions facing these era-defining teams as they go into the fourth Test facing identical issues about poor batting returns and inevitable change.For India, Ashwin's retirement could be a portent of things to come. For Australia, David Warner's last Test in Sydney against Pakistan at the beginning of the year kick started plans which have yet to come to fruition. Bluntly put, Australia have yet to find a proper replacement, showing the perils of forced transition.Australia's pace lineup too is ageing but is still formidable and has kept such questions at bay. The same can't be said of some of the senior batting stars on both sides, but they aren't the only ones under the microscope any more - some inconsistent youngsters too must share the blame.Both these teams are finding it hard to trust their batting lineups right now, but to what degree can teams contemplate alterations ahead of what is expected to be a series defining Test?As Ashwin told his teammates in the dressing room at the Gabba, ""Trust me, everybody's time comes."" Change may be inevitable, but Australia's canny skipper Pat Cummins is punting on being the enemy of change for now.Faced with a barrage of questions on sticking with the opening combo of Nathan McSweeney and Usman Khawaja, who haven't exactly set the series on fire, Cummins retaliated, ""There is so much more to picking a side than just looking at the Internet. (It's about) going on with really strong philosophies, working with players as a unit.""There is no dearth of conspiracy theories when it comes to Australian cricket. Former player and coach Darren Lehmann has even suggested chief selector George Bailey is too close to the team and hence unable to make ""hard decisions"". Cummins shot back, saying, ""The most important thing is you stay objective. They've made some really bold calls over the past couple of years in all formats. Probably bolder than I've seen other selectors make.""The ""bold call"" everyone wants now is to address Australia's struggling top three of Khawaja, McSweeney and Marnus Labuschagne, who have a combined average of 14.4, the lowest for Australia's top three in a home summer since 1887-88. Cummins feels there is no need to panic since some tough batting conditions have meant both teams have struggled to score.""Everyone's always hoping to score more runs. The trend in cricket, pretty much all around the world, is the top three is a really hard place to bat at the moment, particularly in Australia. The wickets are tough,"" Cummins said. ""I'd like them to score more runs, but they've made some important contributions that others have benefited from.""For India, the whole focus has been on the lack of runs from captain Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli 's unconvincing stays in the middle, apart from the century in Perth. But after a promising start, opener Yashasvi Jaiswal has fallen flat. No. 3 Shubman Gill and No. 5 Rishabh Pant too have been unable to convert starts. India, obviously, have the edge in the opening combine given KL Rahul 's good form, with the openers averaging 42.8 from 12 innings here compared to Australia's paltry 13.5.It's the middle order, from No. 3-6, that has been the real disappointment for India as a unit, averaging just 17.78 from a combined 20 innings to Australia's 31.95. India have clearly missed an in-form enforcer like Travis Head, a task entrusted to the likes of Pant.So, while both batting units have problems, they are different ones. Nos. 7-11 have performed similarly on both sides, Australia averaging 21.41 to India's 22.82, though India's last pair did heroically to avoid the follow-on in Brisbane to claim bragging rights.It appears the captains think alike about the batting issue. Like Cummins, Rohit too focused on the overall attitude instead of individual returns. ""It might appear that we lagged behind (in the third Test at the Gabba) but we take a lot from here. I'm immensely proud of the attitude we've shown because runs and wickets are one thing, but if your attitude and character are good then you can turn the impossible into possible,"" he said.Going into the MCG Test, only two things are clear on both sides. The younger batters will in all likelihood get a longer rope. And the veterans will be challenged to change themselves. How well they do so may decide which side comes out on top.",India and Australia face identical issues about poor batting returns and inevitable change. Ravichandran Ashwin's retirement could be a portent of things to come. Australia's canny skipper Pat Cummins is punting on being the enemy of change for now.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116486752,imgsize-77950,width-400,resizemode-4/116486752.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Indian women's cricket team vice-captain Smriti Mandhana delivered a record-breaking performance in the series-deciding third T20I against the West Indies on Thursday, cementing her status as one of the greatest batters in the shortest format. Her explosive knock of 77 runs, combined with Richa Ghosh 's whirlwind fifty, propelled India to their highest-ever T20I total of 217/4.Mandhana's innings was a masterclass in consistency and aggression. With this knock, she achieved multiple milestones, most notably breaking Suzie Bates’ world record for the most 50+ scores in women’s T20Is.Mandhana now has 30 such scores in 148 matches, surpassing the New Zealand legend’s 29 in 171 appearances. She also overtook Bates’ long-standing record for the most fours in women’s T20Is, taking her tally to 506 boundaries.Adding to her growing list of achievements, Mandhana also claimed the record for the most runs in a bilateral T20I series for India, amassing 193 runs in the three-match contest against the West Indies. This surpasses Mithali Raj ’s 192 runs scored in a five-match series against South Africa in 2018.Mandhana’s performance this year has been nothing short of extraordinary. With 763 runs in 23 matches, she now holds the record for the most T20I runs in a calendar year, overtaking Sri Lanka's Chamari Athapaththu, who has 720 runs in 2024.While Mandhana’s brilliance laid the foundation, Richa Ghosh added the finishing touches with a stunning 54 off 21 balls, equaling the world record for the fastest fifty in women’s T20Is.India’s dominant performance, highlighted by these incredible individual feats, not only sealed the series but also showcased the formidable depth and talent in the squad.","Smriti Mandhana scored 77 runs as India beat West Indies in third T20I.

Australia squad:

Former Australian captain Michael Clarke has fiercely criticized the national selectors for dropping Nathan McSweeney midway through the ongoing Border-Gavaskar Trophy against India. McSweeney, who was handed the opening role earlier in the series, has been replaced by Sam Konstas for the final two Tests.McSweeney's dismissal comes after a series of underwhelming performances, with scores of 10, 0, 39, 10, 9, and 4 across six innings. However, Clarke believes the selectors should have persisted with the young opener instead of making a hasty decision.""Nathan McSweeney has been dropped. I can't believe that,"" Clarke said on the Beyond 23 Cricket podcast. ""No matter who they picked in that opening position, they had to give them the series. I think the selectors have got this wrong.""Clarke was especially critical of chief selector George Bailey and questioned the logic behind McSweeney's omission, given the struggles of several senior players in the side.""We've got Usman Khawaja who is 38 years old, and he's made no runs. He's a senior player,"" Clarke pointed out. ""We've got Marnus Labuschagne , who before the series was under pressure and has made one decent score. Steve Smith batted like a genius to make a hard-fought hundred, but he's also been under pressure. Everyone apart from McSweeney is over 30 years of age, some in their high 30s.""Clarke expressed concerns about Australia's long-term plans for the opening position, particularly with Khawaja nearing retirement.""What happens if Usman Khawaja retires in two Test matches? Does McSweeney then come back in, or does he go to the back of the queue? They've got to come out and say, ‘We made a mistake picking him,'"" Clarke remarked.Despite his reservations, Clarke wished Konstas well ahead of a potential debut at the MCG.""I hope he walks out there, lives his dream, makes a hundred on debut. Something like that would be amazing,"" Clarke concluded.The fourth Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy is set to begin on December 26 in Melbourne, with the series currently tied at 1-1.Pat Cummins (c), Travis Head (vc), Steve Smith (vc), Sean Abbott, Scott Boland, Alex Carey, Josh Inglis, Usman Khawaja, Sam Konstas, Marnus Labuschagne, Nathan Lyon, Mitchell Marsh, Jhye Richardson, Mitchell Starc, Beau Webster",Nathan McSweeney has been dropped by Australia for the final two Tests against India.

Rohit Sharma press conference: On Ashwin, Gabba draw and his form

India skipper Rohit Sharma on Wednesday provided a key update on premium pacer Mohammed Shami ’s availability for the remaining two Tests against Australia.With two crucial matches remaining in the series, Shami's inclusion will surely strengthen India’s chances of clinching the series against the formidable Aussies.Speaking at a press conference after the drawn Gabba Test in Brisbane, Rohit categorically stated that it's high time someone from National Cricket Academy (NCA), where the ace pacer is undergoing rehabilitation after ankle surgery in November 2023, should talk about it as they are the ones who will give Shami green signal for the international cricket.""I think it's high time somebody from NCA talked about him. That's our national cricket academy where he is rehabbing. Those guys are the ones who need to come up and give us some kind of update. But look, I understand he's playing a lot of cricket back home, but there have been some complaints about his knee as well,"" Rohit said in the post-match press meet.""The last thing you want is the player coming here and then pulling out in the middle of the game. You know what happens when that kind of thing happens,"" Rohit quipped, referring to the disruption caused by mid-series injuries.Shami has been away from international cricket since participating in India's ODI World Cup Final in November 2023. His path back to competitive cricket has involved playing domestic tournaments.Following his surgery and comprehensive rehabilitation, the seasoned fast bowler resumed playing through the Ranji Trophy, and later delivered strong performances in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy.The Indian cricket team's management remains cautious about Shami's return, insisting on definitive clearance from the NCA. Rohit emphasised that the team would only consider including him in the squad after receiving complete assurance regarding his fitness from the academy.""There's no way we want to take that chance unless we are like, not a hundred percent, 200 hundred percent sure. We're not going to take any risk. But yeah, like I said in the last press conference, the door is open. If those guys at the NCA feel that he's okay to go and recovered and play, I will be happy to have him,"" he added.The five-match series is currently tied at 1-1 after the third Test in Brisbane ended in a draw on Wednesday.

Pakistan secured an emphatic 81-run victory against South Africa in the second ODI at Newlands, Cape Town, clinching the three-match series with an unassailable 2-0 lead. While the contributions of veterans Babar Azam (73) and Mohammad Rizwan (80) were pivotal in setting a competitive total of 329, and the bowling heroics of Shaheen Afridi (4/47) and Naseem Shah (3/37) sealed the win, the match’s narrative was dominated by a heated on-field confrontation during South Africa’s chase.The incident occurred when South African batter Heinrich Klaasen , who scored a valiant 97, appeared visibly agitated after an exchange with Pakistan pacer Haris Rauf following the delivery of a ball. Klaasen’s discontent escalated into a verbal spat, involving teammate David Miller and Pakistan skipper Rizwan, who is typically known for his calm demeanor.It was a tense scene as Rizwan and Klaasen engaged in a finger-pointing argument, prompting the umpires to intervene and defuse the situation. Babar Azam, Pakistan’s star batter and team stalwart, ran over to mediate and prevent further escalation. His timely interjection calmed an approaching Haris Rauf, averting what could have become a larger altercation.Once tempers cooled, play resumed without further incident, but the moment left fans buzzing on social media, with opinions divided about the exchange's origins and implications.Despite the drama, Pakistan’s dominant performance shone through. The partnership between Babar and Rizwan laid a solid foundation, and Afridi and Naseem’s fiery spells dismantled South Africa’s batting lineup, ensuring a comprehensive win.This victory marks Pakistan’s third consecutive ODI series win after their victory against Australia and Zimbabwe, underscoring form as they gear up to host the ICC Champions Trophy .

NEW DELHI: Ravichandran Ashwin , one of India's most celebrated spinners, announced his retirement from international cricket on Wednesday, marking the end of a 14-year career that established him as one of the finest bowlers in the game. Ashwin's 537 Test wickets and 765 international wickets place him as India's second-highest wicket-taker in both categories, behind only the legendary Anil Kumble The comparison between Ashwin and Kumble, two titans of Indian cricket, is inevitable, though challenging due to the different eras and conditions in which they played.Kumble's dominance is reflected in his 619 Test wickets and 953 international scalps, records that have stood the test of time. His career spanned nearly two decades, during which he delivered consistent match-winning performances. Known for his unrelenting accuracy and subtle variations, Kumble remains the highest wicket-taker in Indian cricket history.Ashwin, however, surpassed Kumble in terms of efficiency. He holds the distinction of being the fastest Indian bowler to reach every milestone from 50 to 500 Test wickets, achieving these feats in fewer matches than Kumble. With a bowling average of 24.00 and a strike rate of 52.6, Ashwin edges Kumble, who averaged 29.65 with a strike rate of 65.9 in Tests.Ashwin also holds the record for the most five-wicket hauls (37) by an Indian bowler. His dominance at home is unmatched as 383 of his 537 Test wickets came in India. His ability to outfox left-handers is particularly noteworthy; his 268 dismissals of southpaws are the most by any bowler in Test cricket history.Ashwin's prowess with the bat sets him apart from most bowlers, including Kumble. With 3,503 Test runs at an average of 25.75, including six centuries, Ashwin has contributed significantly down the order. In comparison, Kumble amassed 2,506 Test runs at an average of 17.77, with one century to his name.Ashwin's all-round capabilities are reflected in his rare double of 3,000+ runs and 500+ wickets in Tests, a feat achieved only by Shane Warne and Stuart Broad apart from him.While Ashwin's numbers suggest a slight edge in efficiency and versatility, Kumble's longevity and sheer volume of wickets underscore his unmatched contribution to Indian cricket. Both spinners were game-changers, single-handedly turning matches in India's favour.As Ashwin retires, cricket fans celebrate two extraordinary careers, each embodying excellence and redefining Indian spin bowling in their unique way. Both will remain etched in history as legends who raised the bar for generations to come.","Ravichandran Ashwin announced his retirement from international cricket on Wednesday.

NEW DELHI: Mumbai batter Prithvi Shaw has been on the wrong side of news lately, facing criticism over poor fitness, discipline and attitude.The 25-year-old recently drew flak from a Mumbai Cricket Association official, who brought to the notice that even seniors in the Mumbai side were complaining about his attitude.In the midst of the criticism, Shaw, late on Friday, shared a cryptic post on his Instagram, pointing out that many have been commenting on him without knowing full facts.""If you don't understand it fully, don't speak on it. Too many people have full opinions, with half the facts,"" Shaw wrote.Earlier, Shaw had voiced his frustration after being left out of the 16-member squad for the Vijay Hazare Trophy, despite playing a key role in the team's title-winning campaign in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy.Responding to Shaw's outburst, an MCA official told news agency PTI that Shaw is 'his own enemy'""In the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy, we were playing with 10 fielders as we were forced to hide Prithvi Shaw.

NEW DELHI: According to former Team India head coach Ravi Shastri , India's resilience on the final day of the third Test against Australia in Brisbane has been a defining moment in the ongoing series, providing the team with a psychological boost ahead of the Boxing Day Test at the MCG.Shastri highlighted the importance of India avoiding the follow-on at the Gabba, with the last pair of Jasprit Bumrah and Akash Deep setting the tone for the next phase of the game.“You should celebrate,” Ravi Shastri said. “It required a lot of character from the last pair with 35-36 runs needed. That celebration showed, they knew the importance of that effort within the dressing room in the context of the series.”Shastri drew parallels with India's recent history, recalling the remarkable partnership between Bumrah and Mohammed Shami at Lord's during the 2021 series against England, which turned the game in India's favour.“It's one thing following on, it's one thing then again being 2-3 down as opposed to, you going ahead and rattling the Australian top-order. It is fully justified,” he added. ""It reminded me of the celebration, when in COVID times, when Jasprit and Mohammed Shami were involved in a partnership at Lord’s, which turned the game on its head.""“England were odds on favourites on the final day to win the Test. And that partnership, I think of about 80 or 90, suddenly turned the game on its head and by the end of the day, India had won the Test match,” he added.He emphasized the significance of the tail-enders' stubbornness and resilience, citing instances like Ravichandran Ashwin and Hanuma Vihari's steadfast batting in Sydney, which has been handy for India in recent times.According to Shastri, such performances lift the entire team and provide a psychological advantage in high-stakes series. He believes that the fight shown in this Test could prove crucial for India as the series moves forward, with the series now tied at 1-1 ahead of the Boxing Day Test.“They've been kept in this series single-handedly by Jasprit Bumrah,” Shastri said. “If the big boys wake up, and step up to the plate which I just get the gut feeling they will, then Australia has a problem on their hands.""“Yeah, they got out of jail but they are not on bail. They are free birds in Melbourne. They can do what they want and come and attack Australia on Boxing Day,” he concluded.","Ravi Shastri hails India's resilience on final day of third Test against Australia.

Australia have been consistent in this WTC cycle and will likely retain their spot in the final, even if they lose their upcoming matches against Sri Lanka.

South Africa, though inconsistent, have sufficient buffer to stay ahead of India even if they falter in their series against Pakistan.

How Sri Lanka Could Surpass India?

Stadium Walkthrough series: Inside The Gabba

NEW DELHI: India’s hopes of making it to the World Test Championship (WTC) Final face a steep challenge as the Border-Gavaskar Trophy enters its final stretch.With the five-match series currently level at 1-1, any slip-up could have significant consequences on their qualification chances.In the weather-affected third Test at the Gabba, persistent rain denied both teams a result, with Australia setting India a target of 275 runs before rain forced play to be abandoned with India at 8/0.The drawn match leaves India needing strong performances in the remaining two Tests to maintain their WTC Final aspirations.However, if India lose the series either 1-2 or 1-3, they will finish the WTC cycle with a percentage points tally (PCT) of 51.75%—not enough to secure a place in the top two of the WTC standings.This scenario would eliminate India from contention, with Australia and South Africa cementing their positions above them.The equation becomes more complicated with Sri Lanka’s involvement. If Sri Lanka win their upcoming series against Australia 2-0, they will climb to a PCT of 53.85%, overtaking India and securing a place in the WTC Final.To avoid elimination, India must avoid defeat in the ongoing series. Stronger contributions from the top order, an improved spin strategy, and fitness clarity for key bowlers like Jasprit Bumrah are essential.With the WTC Final at stake, India not only need to focus on their own performance but will also rely on other results falling in their favour. Anything less than a series draw or win will leave Rohit Sharma and his men watching the WTC Final from the sidelines.",India's hopes of making the World Test Championship Final face a steep challenge.

Mohun Bagan Super Giant were threatening to leave everyone behind in the race for the coveted Shield, but the defending cham -pions were pegged back by a determined, or as coach Manolo Marquez would say, motivated FC Goa at the Nehru Stadium in Fatorda on Friday.Goals in either half from local boy Brison Fernandes helped Goa hand Mohun Bagan their first defeat in nine games.Dimitrios Petratos kept his record of scoring against Goa – he has now scored in the last four games – with a secondhalf penalty to end his six-match ISL goal drought, but the hosts survived the onslaught from the opponents for the last quarter. The win took Goa to third on the table with 22 points at the end of the first leg, with Bagan now on top with 26.1-0 wins no issue for Mumbai City boss Kratky ahead of Chennaiyin clash: Two wins, no defeats and no goals conceded from their last three fixtures are encouraging numbers for Mumbai City going into Saturday’s ISL clash with Chennaiyin at the Mumbai Football Arena.Should they have fared better, though, considering those victories came against teams occupying the bottom two spots in the standings? That was a question thrown at Islanders coach Petr Kratky at Friday’s prematch press conference. His response was telling when the questioner asked him if it was time for his men to be more clinical, with the season at the halfway mark.“I hope so,” the Czech said with a laugh, “But sometimes one goal is, for me, enough. Yes, we want to win (scoring) three, four, five or six. That’s good for the fans, but for the team, sometimes that one-nil, it’s more impor -tant than three, four or five.”","FC Goa beat Mohun Bagan 2-0 in first leg of ISL Shield semifinal.

Paul Pogba’s Recent Struggles

Mathias Pogba , the brother of World Cup-winning midfielder Paul Pogba , was sentenced by a Paris criminal court on Thursday to three years in prison, with two years suspended, for his involvement in an extortion and kidnapping case.Having already spent time in custody, Mathias will serve the remainder of his sentence under house arrest with electronic monitoring. The ruling aligns with the prosecution’s request, but Mathias’ lawyer has announced plans to appeal.The trial stemmed from allegations that Mathias and five others attempted to extort Paul Pogba in 2022.The group reportedly demanded €13 million ($13.6 million) from the French midfielder and allegedly held him at gunpoint in March 2022.Roushdane K., identified as the mastermind behind the blackmail, was sentenced to eight years in prison. Other accomplices also received jail terms.Mathias Pogba had faced charges of attempted extortion and criminal conspiracy.Paul Pogba, who did not attend the trial, revealed during the investigation that he had paid €100,000 ($104,000) to the group, which included his brother.The court determined that Pogba suffered financial losses of €197,000 ($204,000) and moral damages of €50,000 ($52,000).It ordered all defendants, except Mathias, to jointly compensate the footballer.The case gained public attention after Mathias posted social media threats to reveal 'explosive' information about his brother, fellow French star Kylian Mbappé, and agent Rafaela Pimenta.Once regarded as one of the world’s best midfielders, Paul Pogba has faced numerous challenges off the field. Earlier this month, Juventus announced the mutual termination of his contract, a decision influenced by his doping ban.Pogba tested positive for testosterone in August 2023 and was initially handed a four-year suspension. However, the ban was reduced to 18 months by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), which cited the unintentional use of a doctor-prescribed supplement. Pogba will be eligible to resume his career in March 2025.A former record-breaking transfer, Pogba joined Manchester United in 2016 for €105 million ($116 million) but returned to Juventus in 2022 as a free agent.Injuries limited him to just eight Serie A appearances before his doping case emerged.The 30-year-old’s career highlights include playing a pivotal role in France’s 2018 World Cup triumph. Despite his recent setbacks, Pogba could make a comeback in professional football after his suspension ends.","Mathias Pogba sentenced to three years in prison, with two years suspended.

NEW DELHI: British billionaire businessman and chairman of chemicals company INEOS , Jim Ratcliffe , has increased his stake in Manchester United to nearly 29 percent after completing the cash injection he promised when purchasing a minority share of the Premier League club.Last year, it was announced that Ratcliffe had agreed to buy a 25 percent stake in the club, including investing an additional $300 million (£238 million) into infrastructure on top of his $1.3 billion purchase price.The deal was ratified in February, and the US Securities and Exchange Commission has confirmed that the final $100 million (£79.3 million) was paid on Wednesday.The SEC filing also revealed that all of Ratcliffe's shares in United are being transferred to INEOS from Trawlers Ltd, which initially bought the stake from the US-based Glazer family , who remain the club's majority owners.With INEOS now in charge of United's football operations , Ratcliffe has made what he calls ""difficult and unpopular decisions"" since becoming co-owner.Around 250 members of staff have left, while former United manager Alex Ferguson is being stripped of his ambassadorial role at the club.Additionally, the mid-season decision to increase prices of remaining home tickets to £66 ($83) per match, without any concessions for children or pensioners, sparked anger and protests among United fans.Ratcliffe, 72, recently stated that the club ""needs to sweat every pound"" if they are to return to former glories, with the team currently looking to climb from 13th place in the Premier League table under newly-appointed manager Ruben Amorim .""To get Manchester United to where we need to get it -- it's a bit like the country (Britain) -- we have to make some difficult and unpopular decisions,"" said Ratcliffe. ""If you shy away from the difficult decisions then nothing much is going to change. We won't get everything right and it won't happen overnight, but we haven't been sat on our hands for nine months. There has been a lot of change.""","British billionaire Jim Ratcliffe has increased his stake in Manchester United to nearly 29 percent.

Novak Djokovic will run out of energy: Andre Agassi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/novak-djokovic-will-run-out-of-energy-andre-agassi/articleshow/116235405.cms,"American legend

Andre Agassi

believes Djokovic will miss Federer & Nadal, the guys he came to the dance with

Excerpts:

Djokovic's longevity:

Andy Murray coaching Djokovic:

Carlos Alcaraz

and longevity…

American men haven't had results like the women:

Graf was the hardest victory I ever had: Agassi

BENGALURU: Andre Agassi wondered if the 24-time major winner Novak Djokovic would miss his greatest rivals -- the now-retired Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer -- in the last leg of a glittering career where the 37-year-old goes for more history.The eight-time Grand Slam champion, in the city for the TiE Global Summit, assessed Djokovic's run and the Serb's recent partnership with friend and rival Andy Murray in a candid chat with media.It's hard to say, Father Time always wins. He has already done so much for so long, it's hard to imagine longer. We said that about (Roger) Federer too. I think Novak will run out of energy more than capability. Cannot be easy, especially when the people you came to the dance with have left, that's a big thing.When Pete (Sampras) retired it was a blow to me, it set me back a little bit. It made me rediscover my inspirations on some level. Djokovic has lost the guys he made history with. It'll probably get tougher and tougher emotionally, but I would never bet against them. Bet against them at your peril.In any coach-student relationship you need trust and trust can take time, but it's nice when it starts with believing in somebody because you know that they know your experience. There's an asset to their history as competitors.Any success of a relationship is based on complete buy-in and that's always the part you have to wait and see. It's not what I know that changes your career, information doesn't lead to transformation, somebody has to counter that. That's the connector. I'm sure there's going to be a lot of trust immediately, we'll see how the results go.Alcaraz defends like Novak, has more power and spin like Nadal, hands and finesse like Federer but just because he has the best of all the three doesn't mean he can do what they did. There are so many parts to the game such as decision-making, injuries, luck. So how long can (Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner) do it (for)? They could do it for 20 years or not.The women's game hasn't had to deal with Roger Federer, Novak Djokovic, Rafael, Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz, but they have their version of it. Serena Williams is the Novak of the women's game and you got Coco as a potential, like Alcaraz has potential and Sinner has potential.How the game evolves is interesting. The women's game has gotten very powerful, just straight power. For lack of a better example, Lindsay Davenport was powerful, tall, precise through the court and now you have a lot of that. There's still room for somebody who can offset that kind of power, like an Ash Barty.The men's game has changed in the sense that guys have gotten bigger with longer levers, which means they're better athletes, they can move and they need more time, they start playing further back. Soon you're going to start seeing the net game start coming back, everything morphs in its own way. But the biggest issue for American (men) not winning is an unfortunate set of decades where the guys were very stingy and very greedy -- 66 Grand Slams in the same generation. There's not a lot left there (for others)!Andre Agassi - the second of five men to achieve a career Grand Slam in the Open Era and the first man to complete a career golden slam - has won it all, including a stirring love match.""She was the hardest victory I ever had,"" said Agassi of his wife German tennis legend Steffi Graf, a 22-time major winner.Agassi, who has won eight major titles and the Olympic gold, speaking during a session at the TiE Global Summit, said, ""We all live a hero's journey - first part of life is about performing and achieving. Then life hits us with broken relationships and dreams. I went through it all. Finally, in the last phase of the journey, it's about serving others.""The 54-year-old said, ""At 28 my (tennis) career started over. Without the struggles, I would've never gotten Steffi to say yes. I tried to get her for years.""On a lighter note, Agassi said he likes to keep his trophies out of the house. ""I don't bring my trophies home, because if I bring my trophies home, then she brings her trophies home - and that's bad math!""",Andre Agassi believes Novak Djokovic will run out of energy more than capability.

NEW DELHI: Legendary player Andre Agassi observed that Carlos Alcaraz embodies distinct qualities from Novak Djokovic Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal , while advising the tennis world against anticipating the young Spaniard to match the extraordinary achievements of these tennis legends.The collective Grand Slam victories of Federer, Nadal and Djokovic stand at 66, whilst Alcaraz, aged 21, has secured four major titles thus far.""I'm not a genius and I don't have a crystal ball. What I can tell you is Alcaraz defends like Novak, has power and spin like Nadal and has hands and finesse like Federer,"" said Agassi during a talk session in Bengaluru.The eight-time Grand Slam victor Agassi elaborated on why excessive expectations shouldn't burden Alcaraz.""Just because he has the best of all those three doesn't mean he can do what they did because there're so many other parts to the game, which mean decision-making, injuries, you know, luck,"" he said.With Djokovic at 37, approaching retirement, Agassi noted that the Serbian's competitive edge might diminish without Nadal and Federer in the arena.""He's already done so much, so long, and it's hard to imagine longer. I think he'll run out of the energy for it more than the capability of it, I would imagine.""It cannot be easy, especially when the people you came to the dance with have left.""The American provided additional context to his assessment.""When Pete (Sampras) retired, it was a blow to me. It set me back a little bit. It made me have to rediscover my inspirations on some level.""And he's (Djokovic) lost the guys that he's made history with. So, it's probably emotionally going to get tougher and tougher quickly, but I would never bet against him. Bet against him at your own peril,"" said Agassi.Regarding Djokovic's recent appointment of Andy Murray as coach to extend his career, Agassi expressed interest in their partnership's development.""They've been fierce rivals on court, and now Murray will be coaching Djokovic.

NEW DELHI: Tennis icon Andre Agassi on Tuesday highlighted how sports should remain integral to education, noting their role in teaching children to cope with defeat.At a Bengaluru event focussed on sports and education's role in fostering excellence, Agassi shared his insights.""Even when you have a failure, you have to get up and play again the next day. So, what sports is teaching you is that focusing on winning and losing is really a distraction from what we need to be thinking about. We need to be thinking about how to get better,"" he said.Since 2001, Agassi has invested in education for underprivileged children, establishing 130 schools serving approximately 80,000 students in the United States. He attributes this achievement to his persistent drive to overcome obstacles.His demanding tennis career shaped his ability to maintain focus and adapt when necessary.""Sports is all about problem-solving. Tennis taught me how to navigate a very intense environment and maintain my objectivity and problem-solving abilities. It forces me to be present, but also to understand the context of what I'm doing,"" Agassi said.Regarding his earlier defiant period, Agassi acknowledged it as a necessary phase in his journey.""Vulnerability is essential for growth, and I think vulnerability eventually leads to humility,"" he added.He recognised technology's crucial role in education, particularly in providing individualised learning opportunities for children. This belief influenced his investment in the Indian EdTech company, Square Panda .""I think technology can play an essential role, not just in scalability, but also in optimising personalised learning. That's why I got involved with Square Panda.

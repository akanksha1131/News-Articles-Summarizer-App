Shubman Gill ruled out of South Africa ODIs; three captaincy candidates emerge

Shubman Gill is looking to recover in time for the first T20I against South Africa on December 9.

India Test and ODI captain Shubman Gill is all set to commence his rehabilitation at the BCCI Centre of Excellence from December 1. As TimesofIndia.com had reported on November 23, Gill was scheduled to reach Bengaluru on either December 1 or 2 - roughly a week before the T20I series against South Africa starts.It is learnt that the 26-year-old had physiotherapy sessions in Mumbai before he flew to Chandigarh to spend time with his family. He will be flying to Bengaluru from Chandigarh on Monday. The recovery is on track at the moment and he hasn't faced any discomfort despite the multiple flights taken. During this period, he's stayed away from the nets but he is expected to pick the bat in the coming days under the watch of the BCCI medical team at CoE.""There are no red flags at the moment and he has taken multiple flights - Kolkata to Guwahati, Guwahati to Mumbai, Mumbai to Chandigarh and now Chandigarh to Bengaluru - without any discomfort. All efforts right now are aimed at having him back on the park but it will not be a rushed process.""The moment he is 100% and feels ready for the grind, he will be back with the squad. He is an important all-format player and everyone wants him to be absolutely ready,"" said an official privy to developments.After injuring his neck during the first innings of the first Test vs South Africa in Kolkata, Gill was hospitalised and ruled out of the fixture and the next game in Guwahati too While he did travel with the team for the second game , he wasn't able to regain match fitness in the short turnaround time. After reaching Mumbai, Gill consulted a spine specialist in Mumbai and was advised more rest before commencing rehab, training and skill activity.The next few days could decide his participation in the five match T20I series vs South Africa, starting December 9. Having already missed the Tests and ODIs, Gill is leaving no stone unturned in regaining fitness before the shortest format.",India Test and ODI captain Shubman Gill is all set to commence his rehabilitation at the BCCI Centre of Excellence from December 1.

Why Indian cricket needs Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli... more than ever

Poll Who impressed you the most in India's victory over South Africa? Virat Kohli Rohit Sharma Kuldeep Yadav Harshit Rana

NEW DELHI: India captain KL Rahul couldn’t hide his admiration — or his nerves — after Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma produced commanding innings to script India’s tense 17-run win over South Africa in the opening ODI in Ranchi on Sunday. Kohli’s majestic 135 off 120 balls, his 52nd ODI century, and Rohit’s composed 57 laid the foundation for India’s 349/8, giving the hosts a 1-0 lead in the three-match series.Rahul, speaking after the match, marvelled at how effortless the senior duo made batting look. “Watching Rohit and Kohli play like that is always fun. They've made oppositions look silly and show why they are who they are,” he said. “I've seen this for a long time, but it’s a lot more fun to see them around in the dressing room.”But despite the strong batting display, the final overs left the skipper on edge.“I’d be lying if I said there were no butterflies in my stomach. We’re playing ODI cricket after a while and there’s some expectation,” Rahul admitted. “But we kept taking wickets and the bowlers stuck to their plans. They pushed us and kept coming hard.”Rahul, who is adapting to a new role in the middle order, said batting at No. 6 was helping him evolve. “Batting at No. 6 is okay… that’s the role I’ve been given in the last 2–3 series. It’s helping personal development.”He also reserved praise for Harshit Rana and Kuldeep Yadav , who held their nerves under pressure. “Harshit’s done really well… tall, bowls fast, and has great potential. Kuldeep is doing this job — key for us to take wickets.”Kuldeep, who finished with four wickets, revealed he relied on variation to outfox the Proteas batters.“We wanted to attack despite it being tough to bowl… I was mixing scrambled seam and seam-up, trying to bowl back of a length. It was very challenging — the ball was getting wet,” Kuldeep said. “You can’t rely only on stock balls. You have to keep batters guessing.”South Africa’s captain Aiden Markram praised his team’s fight but admitted the top-order collapse hurt them. “Proud of the chase… but the top order falling was defining. Small pieces to do better,” he said.India now head into the second ODI with momentum.",Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma produced commanding innings to script India’s tense 17-run win over South Africa in the opening ODI in Ranchi on Sunday.

Yuzvendra Chahal did not hold back on Sunday. The leg-spinner, long known for his close bond with Virat Kohli , was at his expressive best on social media after Kohli sealed a record-breaking 52nd ODI century during India’s commanding 349/8 against South Africa in Ranchi.As Kohli marched to a sublime 135 off 120 balls — the innings built on clean hitting, precise placement and a blistering late surge — Chahal turned into the most enthusiastic commentator outside the JSCA stands.His first post summed up the mood, delivered with trademark humour: “Bus mujhse 52 century's jayda. Waiting kab @imVkohli bhaiya aap 100 century's jayda honge mujhse #INDVSSAODI"" (Just 52 centuries ahead of me. Waiting for when you'll be 100 centuries ahead of me).The line, playful on the surface, also referenced the long-standing benchmark — Sachin Tendulkar’s 100 international hundreds. Kohli sits second on the all-time list with 82, all formats combined. While he now features exclusively in ODIs for India, the chase remains a talking point every time he crosses another milestone. As Chahal hinted, the wait to see whether Kohli can catch or surpass the iconic mark continues.Incidentally, the ton also meant that Kohli is now the all-time leader in terms of most centuries in a single format. His 52 in ODIs is now second to none, not even the legendary Sachin, who has 51 tons in Test cricket.The spinner kept the tributes flowing. Another post, full of admiration and swagger, read: “Jahan Charche Bade hote hai .. Wahan Virat bhaiya KHADE hote hai.""Chahal also shared a string of Instagram stories: one capturing the moment Kohli reached his century, filmed straight off his television screen and another celebrating Rohit Sharma’s half-century, with the playful caption ""Sharma Rohitaa Sharamaaaa"".Kohli’s knock had given Chahal plenty to gush over. Starting with an early slice of luck and building into controlled aggression, Kohli shifted gears after his fifty, launching two sixes off Bosch and punishing spin with authority. His acceleration after the century — including a 20-run burst off Subrayen — pushed India beyond 260 by the 40th over before he finally fell for 135.KL Rahul’s 60 and Rohit Sharma’s fluent 57 completed India’s imposing total.But beyond the scorecard, the day belonged to Kohli’s milestone — and to Chahal, who turned the achievement into a mini-festival online, celebrating his “Virat bhaiya” with unfiltered joy.","Yuzvendra Chahal posted several messages celebrating and congratulating Virat Kohli's ton vs South Africa in Ranchi.

Andre Russell retires from IPL: Returns to KKR in new role,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/ipl/top-stories/andre-russell-retires-from-ipl-returns-to-kkr-in-new-role/articleshow/125669881.cms,"Andre Russell (ANI)

KKR IPL 2026 trades, retentions, releases, squad update: Are they missing Gambhir?

Kolkata Knight Riders’ iconic allrounder Andre Russell has announced his retirement from the Indian Premier League, ending a decade-long association with the franchise. The 37-year-old will now transition into a support staff role with KKR as the team’s new “Power Coach” from the 2026 season.Russell made the announcement on Instagram, addressing KKR fans directly. “I’ve made a decision to retire from the IPL. I will still be active playing in various leagues around the world and for all the other KKR franchises,” he wrote. He reflected fondly on his IPL career, recalling the sixes, match-winning performances, and MVP awards that made him one of the most feared T20 players in the world.Explaining his timing, Russell said, “I don’t want to fade out. I want to leave a legacy behind. It's best to retire when fans ask ‘why? You still have some more in you,’ instead of ‘yeah, you should have done it years back.’” He also admitted that seeing himself photoshopped in jerseys of other franchises made him realise his strong attachment to KKR’s purple and gold.Russell credited KKR’s management for supporting him through this transition. “There have been a lot of conversations between me and Mr. Venky Mysore and also Mr. Shah Rukh Khan . They have shown me love and respect and appreciated whatever I’ve been doing on the field.To be in a setup that’s familiar matters a lot.”As KKR’s Power Coach, Russell plans to impart his unique expertise and energy to the next generation. “When I heard that name – ‘Power Coach’ – I felt that describes Andre Russell the best, because the power that I possess when I bat, the energy I show in the field with the ball in hand, I can help in any department,” he said.Russell’s IPL legacy is monumental: two-time KKR champion (2014 and 2024), 223 sixes (joint-seventh all-time), 16 Player-of-the-Match awards, and the 2019 IPL Player of the Tournament. Across 139 appearances, Russell’s fearsome batting, explosive death-over bowling, and unmatched fielding have made him synonymous with KKR’s identity.He concluded with a heartfelt message to fans: “So Kolkata, I’ll be back. Korbo Lorbo Jeetbo.”Russell’s retirement from IPL cricket marks the end of an era, but his journey with KKR enters a new chapter — this time off the field, shaping future stars.","Andre Russell has announced his retirement from the Indian Premier League.

Sitanshu Kotak press conference: Big statement on Virat Kohli, India win and more

Poll Which player had the most significant impact on India's total score? Virat Kohli Rohit Sharma KL Rahul Ravindra Jadeja

RANCHI: Despite it being a Ro-Ko show here on Super Sunday, South Africa continued to dish out spoiler alerts throughout their innings but stopped 17 runs short of a record chase at JSCA International Stadium.Chasing an improbable 350 under lights, South Africa had a horrible start but recovered to remain in the game till the end. Finally, Corbin Bosch's valiant innings of 67 off 51 balls came to an end as he holed out to Rohit Sharma at cover, which gave India a 1-0 lead in the three-match ODI series.With Rohit scoring his last ODI century against Australia in Sydney on Oct 25 this year, Kohli continued his love affair with Ranchi to score his 52nd ton in the format here on Sunday. As the duo fired in unison, breaking multiple records on the day, India left behind the Test debacle suffered five days ago at the hands of the same opponents.With Ro-Ko playing the major role with a 136-run stand for the second wicket, India amassed the highest total in Ranchi — 349/8 from 50 overs — and tried to bat South Africa out of the contest with heavy dew expected in the second innings. South Africa, full of confidence after their Test heroics, slumped to 11 for 3, but they took the game deep with some sensible batting in the middle and down the order.However, it proved to be a task beyond them as India held their nerve and their catches.Earlier, a change in captaincy could not change India's luck with the coin as they lost their 19th straight toss in ODIs and were asked to bat first by South Africa skipper Aiden Markram. Temba Bavuma, their regular ODI skipper, was out due to a niggle.As India lost opener Yashasvi Jaiswal cheaply following a brisk start, Ro-Ko sunk their teeth into the game and continued with the form they showed in Sydney in their 392nd international appearance together. This was the highest for an Indian pair, bettering the iconic Sachin Tendulkar-Rahul Dravid's 391 games together across formats.The duo's 20th century stand in ODIs, behind only Tendulkar and Sourav Ganguly's 26 100-run partnerships, is now joint second with the Tillakaratne Dilshan-Kumar Sangakkara pair.Sharma-Kohli racked up their 100-run stand in 82 balls, with the former racing to a 43-ball half-century. Sharma departed scoring 57 off 51 balls with five fours and three sixes, becoming the batter with the most sixes in ODI history with 352 to his tally, breaking Shahid Afridi's all-time record.Kohli showed his vintage form and enthralled the full house with 11 fours and seven towering sixes.

BCCI secretary Devajit Saikia has addressed recent media speculation regarding Virat Kohli 's potential return to Test cricket. The rumours suggested that the cricket board was planning to approach Kohli about reversing his Test retirement decision.These speculations gained momentum following India's recent struggles in Test cricket. The national team has faced setbacks, including two home series losses in the past two years, which has impacted India's traditionally strong home record.""What's being said about Virat Kohli is just a rumour.

Why Indian cricket needs Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli... more than ever

Former Indian cricket legend Sunil Gavaskar has criticised South Africa head coach Shukri Conrad's 'grovel' comment during the second Test match between India and South Africa.South Africa won the Test series 2-0 against India. During the second Test in Guwahati, despite having a substantial first-innings lead of 288 runs, South Africa chose to bat again instead of enforcing the follow-on.When questioned about this decision at the press conference, Conrad stated: ""We wanted them (India) to really grovel.""On the JioHotstar show 'Cricket Live', Gavaskar addressed Conrad's controversial remark.""You could say it was an ill-advised use of the word. We need to look back at South Africa's re-entry into international cricket. It was the Indian Cricket Board that proposed South Africa's readmission after more than 20 years of isolation, and their first international match on return was played in India,"" he said.""When you consider the current landscape of South African cricket, especially the SA20, five out of the six franchises are Indian-owned. These owners are significantly supporting South African players--not just the international stars who are well taken care of, but the fringe players as well--giving them opportunities to build strong careers.""Gavaskar emphasised the historically positive relationship between Indian and South African cricket.He suggested that while an apology wasn't necessary, Conrad should acknowledge his comment.""Indian and South African cricket have shared a positive, collaborative relationship for decades. Across all the years and encounters between the two teams, the cricket has always been competitive and tough, but never hostile. I have witnessed nearly every India-South Africa contest, and it has always been hard, fair cricket. Nothing beyond that. So yes, it may have been an ill-advised remark--wrong time, wrong place,"" he added.""I hope that in his next media interaction, he addresses it. I don't think an apology is necessary; I personally don't believe in apologies. But acknowledging it and making up for it would be accepted by everyone. These things happen. In the heat of the moment, you can get carried away and say something that goes a bit over the top. Given the strong connection between Indian and South African cricket over the last 30 years, I think he can simply clarify that he got a bit carried away.

Inside India nets in Ranchi: How Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma prepared for first ODI vs South Africa

NEW DELHI: Star batter Virat Kohli produced another innings of authority and patience on Sunday while also stepping into territory that has belonged to only one man for two decades.With his 52nd One Day International hundred in the first ODI against South Africa, Kohli went past Sachin Tendulkar ’s tally of 51 Test centuries and became the only cricket er in history to score more than 51 centuries in a single format of international cricket.The feat also marked the 7000th international hundred in men’s cricket.India lost former captain Rohit Sharma after a fluent 57 off 51 balls, but Kohli stood firm on a pitch that demanded both discipline and calculated strokeplay.He came in early, settled quietly and gradually took control of the innings as the partnership with Rohit began to flow. Their stand of 136 off 109 deliveries gave India the platform they needed after a brisk start.The moment of history arrived in the 38th over.Marco Jansen delivered one back of a length outside off, and Kohli opened the bat face neatly to guide the ball past third man.The timing was effortless, and the boundary took him to a landmark that had been approaching steadily through the afternoon.Kohli leapt, punched the air and acknowledged a Ranchi crowd that rose in one voice. It was not overplayed, simply a celebration of mastery, built brick by brick.He eventually fell for a brilliant 135 off 120 balls, caught by Rickelton running back from cover after mistiming an attempted loft.As he walked off he raised his bat to all four stands, and Ranchi responded with a standing ovation befitting the moment.A record surpassed, a new peak reached and history rewritten in Kohli’s name.",Virat Kohli scores 52nd One Day International hundred in first ODI against South Africa.

Alexander Isak scored his first Premier League goal for Liverpool, leading to a crucial 2-0 victory against West Ham at the London Stadium on Sunday.The Sweden forward had not scored in five Premier League appearances since his British record £125 million transfer from Newcastle in September.This was only Isak's second goal in 11 matches across all competitions for Liverpool, following his initial score in a League Cup victory against Southampton.Liverpool secured their first win in four games when Cody Gakpo added a second goal during stoppage time.""There's definitely a feeling of relief because if you have lost so many times, then winning is important. We hardly conceded a chance and we were able to create chances ourselves,"" Reds boss Arne Slot said.""It helps if you don't go 1-0 down after five minutes because then you are more open. We played the game I wanted us to play. What I saw meant a lot to our players and our fans. This is a good first step for us. We won and had a clean sheet.""Isak's performance had been affected by injuries and lack of match fitness after missing pre-season due to his extended transfer negotiations.The 26-year-old's goal marked his first league score since playing for Newcastle against Brighton in May, ending a 10-match goalless streak for both club and country.""I think it does feel significant,"" Slot said.Liverpool had faced recent challenges, including a 4-1 defeat against PSV Eindhoven in the Champions League and 3-0 losses to Manchester City and Nottingham Forest.The team had lost nine of their previous 12 games, marking their worst performance since 1953-54, including six defeats in seven league matches.The victory helped Liverpool move to eighth place, providing relief for Slot who faced mounting pressure.Mohamed Salah's performance has been a concern, with only five goals this season, leading to his third bench placement.West Ham honored their former captain and manager Billy Bonds, who passed away at 79, with a minute's applause.Despite West Ham's strong start, Liverpool gradually took control of the match.Isak initially struggled, missing a clear chance from the edge of the area and having a bicycle kick saved by Alphonse Areola.The Swedish striker finally scored after 60 minutes, converting Gakpo's assist with a low shot past Areola.Isak was substituted shortly after scoring, receiving acknowledgment from Slot on the sideline.West Ham's situation worsened when Lucas Paqueta received a red card in the 84th minute for two yellow cards, both for dissent against referee Darren England.The match concluded with Gakpo scoring from 12 yards following a defensive error by West Ham.","Liverpool defeated West Ham 2-0 at the London Stadium on Sunday.

Joshua Zirkzee scored his first Premier League goal in nearly a year, while Mason Mount secured the winning goal as Manchester United defeated Crystal Palace 2-1 on Sunday.Ruben Amorim's team initially fell behind when Jean-Philippe Mateta scored a first-half penalty at Selhurst Park. However, Zirkzee and Mount's second-half goals helped United secure their first victory in four matches.United overcame their slow start with Zirkzee's first Premier League goal since his strike against Everton in December 2024. The Dutch striker had experienced a 24-game goalless streak in the league, raising questions about his £36 million transfer from Bologna in 2024.Zirkzee, aged 24, had not found the net in his previous eight appearances since April. Mount, who has faced injury setbacks since joining from Chelsea, celebrated only his second goal of the season.This victory marked United's first win since October, providing relief for Amorim after their recent loss to 10-man Everton at Old Trafford. The win was particularly significant as it ended Palace's unbeaten home record in the Premier League, which had stood since February 15.""There are no excuses"" for United's struggling start to the season, Amorim had stated earlier in the week.Casemiro nearly gave United an early lead within the first minute when a long throw created confusion in Palace's defense, but Dean Henderson saved his close-range shot.Mateta missed an opportunity at the other end, failing to score after getting past Leny Yoro with only goalkeeper Senne Lammens to beat. Lammens then made saves from Daichi Kamada's low shot and helped defend against Yeremy Pino's attempt.Palace took the lead in the 36th minute through a penalty. Yoro fouled Mateta, who initially scored but had his goal disallowed for a double-touch violation.A new rule implemented this season allows successful penalties with accidental double-touches to be retaken. This rule clarification followed Julian Alvarez's disallowed penalty for Atletico Madrid against Real Madrid last season.Mateta successfully converted his second attempt past Lammens. Zirkzee, who had been quiet in the first half, equalized in the 54th minute with a remarkable shot from a difficult angle after receiving Bruno Fernandes' free-kick.Shortly after scoring, Zirkzee almost contributed to an own goal when he deflected the ball toward his own net, but it was cleared to safety.Mount put United ahead in the 63rd minute, scoring from a free-kick assist by Fernandes. His low shot went under the Palace wall and past Henderson from 20 yards out.",Manchester United defeated Crystal Palace 2-1 at Selhurst Park.

KOLKATA: Khalid Jamil seems to have a quick fix for stemming the rot in the Indian national football team — bringing more Ryan Williams-like Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) players to the table.Jamil’s stint with the Blue Tigers began with a creditable third-place finish in their maiden CAFA Nations Cup but it turned out to be false dawn earlier than anticipated with India failing to make the Asian Cup final round with back-to-back losses to Singapore and Bangladesh.“We need more OCI players like Williams in the national team,” Jamil said during an interaction with mediapersons on Saturday. “One or two more such players have been shortlisted and we’ll reveal their names once everything is confirmed. I feel it’s a good chance. It would be better if we have more Indian overseas players with Indian passport. If he’s available and playing outside, it would be very good. It would definitely improve our performance. In the last game (against Bangladesh) had Ryan Williams been there, we could have performed better,” Jamil remarked.After relinquishing his Australian passport to become an Indian citizen, Williams travelled to Dhaka as a member of Jamil’s squad but could not play because of the delay in getting the mandatory Fifa approval with respect to the change of member association.",Jamil’s stint with the Blue Tigers began with a creditable third-place finish in their maiden CAFA Nations Cup but it turned out to be false dawn earlier than anticipated.

Inter Miami head coach Javier Mascherano showered praise on Lionel Messi , calling him “extraordinary”, after the Argentine icon guided the club into their maiden MLS Cup final with a commanding 5-1 victory over New York City FC on Saturday.Miami’s charge to the championship match was led by a brilliant Tadeo Allende hat-trick, while Mateo Silvetti and Telasco Segovia also found the net in a dominant performance at Fort Lauderdale.Messi, 38, didn’t score on the night, but produced a moment of pure class when he set up Silvetti for Miami’s third goal. That assist came just as New York were closing in on an equaliser and effectively put the contest to bed.Mascherano, who previously shared the pitch with Messi for Barcelona and Argentina, said his star man continues to redefine what is possible.“Leo has spoiled us with the extraordinary,” Mascherano said. “He is unique, someone we won’t see again. Maybe people expected a goal today, but he brought calmness with that third goal. Only he can spot that pass.

Shedeur Sanders’ performance and mom Pilar’s unwavering support



Shedeur Sanders stepped onto the field for his first professional home start with the Cleveland Browns on Sunday against the San Francisco 49ers, and all eyes were on both him and his supportive mom, Pilar Sanders. The rookie quarterback, drafted in the fifth round despite high expectations, has already started making waves after a victory over the Las Vegas Raiders last week. Throwing for 209 yards, a touchdown, and one interception, Shedeur proved he could rise to the occasion when given the opportunity.This week, after being named QB1 over Dillon Gabriel, Sanders balanced preparation with family support. He spent time at his mother’s home with brother Shilo, enjoying home-cooked meals and studying film before the big game. But pregame attention wasn’t reserved for his on-field performance alone. Shedeur made headlines with a self-promoting outfit from his Legendary brand, and Pilar followed suit with a bold statement fit of her own. Browns fans and media couldn’t help but notice, as she continues to turn heads with her stylish game-day ensembles.Despite the cold, Pilar was at the stadium to cheer her son on in person. She previously stole the spotlight during Shedeur’s NFL debut with a custom t-shirt, and Sunday’s winter-ready look was just as memorable.On the field, Shedeur completed 16-of-25 passes for 149 yards, adding a touchdown and a seven-yard rush. While the Browns fell short against the 49ers, the young quarterback’s potential remains clear.“Very committed to working at it, doing a great job, communicating with coaches, with the players,” Browns coach Kevin Stefanski said of Sanders. “Good work week, but nothing different. I think any player, though, once you get one game under your belt, you got the next one coming. I think it can only help.”Shedeur Sanders is not only focused on proving himself on the field but is also buoyed by the confidence and style of his mom. Whether he maintains the starting role for the rest of the season remains to be seen, but one thing is certain: Pilar Sanders will be there, front and center, cheering him on every step of the way.Also Read: While Drake Maye preps quietly for Giants, wife Ann’s viral gym photo brings unexpected buzz to Patriots fans","Shedeur Sanders made his NFL debut against the San Francisco 49ers on Sunday.

Justin Herbert injury update clouds Chargers playoff hopes



Los Angeles Chargers quarterback Justin Herbert might’ve finished his team’s win over the Las Vegas Raiders after suffering an injury, but there’s no guarantee the superstar won’t miss time soon. The situation turned serious after head coach Jim Harbaugh confirmed Herbert needs to undergo a “medical procedure” after suffering a broken bone in his left hand, according to ESPN’s Kris Rhim. Harbaugh being Harbaugh, the veteran head coach wouldn't get further into specifics, and that includes whether Herbert needs to miss time.The injury unfolded early. Herbert left the eventual win in the first half, going to the locker room with trainers after injuring the non-throwing hand. He returned with a bulky glove, operated mainly from shotgun, and while the offense lagged at points, he still managed to guide the team to a convincing victory.The moment Herbert stepped up in the pocket in the first quarter, scrambled left, and was then tackled by safety Jeremy Chinn, everything changed. His left hand struck the defender’s helmet, and while Herbert popped up and even threw a touchdown on the very next play, slow-motion replays revealed the tip of his finger bent in a disturbing angle.That was the turning point.He completed 15 of 20 passes for 151 yards with two touchdowns and an interception, even with a compromised hand that looked almost mannequin-like beneath the heavy glove. The Chargers earned a 31-14 victory, their largest margin in this rivalry since 2008, but the price might be steep.The recovery timeline matters. Surgery is immediate, and recovery times after surgery are far less predictable. The Chargers do get a small scheduling advantage with an extended break before hosting Philadelphia on Monday night in Week 14. Still, the looming schedule is unforgiving with matchups against Philadelphia, Kansas City, Dallas, Houston and Denver. They likely need at least two wins to remain in realistic postseason contention.Herbert has taken hits all season without missing time. That streak ended Sunday. Yet even injured, he lifted his team with touchdown connections to Quentin Johnston and Ladd McConkey, supported by Kimani Vidal’s career-high 126 rushing yards. This was a hard-earned AFC West win that also leaves the franchise holding its breath.Herbert fractured his left hand in the win and will undergo surgery Monday, Jim Harbaugh confirmed. The question now is not whether Herbert can play through pain. He has shown he can. It is whether the Chargers can survive what might come next.Also Read: Did Justin Herbert secretly purchase a $25 million estate with Madison Beer?

As the Buffalo Bills fight through a critical matchup with the Steelers, the tension stretches beyond the gridiron and into the personal world of Hailee Steinfeld. The constant scrutiny surrounding Josh Allen and his marriage has created a daily storm of attention. Steinfeld has now decided to step back from the noise and give herself permission to breathe. In her newsletter, she revealed she is stepping away from Instagram for the weekend, choosing to focus on peace, presence and family time rather than public reaction.Her decision comes directly from a place of emotional honesty. “Even if just for the weekend, I’m currently a week into an Instagram detox,” her newsletter mentioned. For someone with over twenty million followers, this is a noticeable silence. What stands out is how candid she is about the emotional benefit. She explains that unplugging transforms her mood and eases her mind. “Every time I do this, I wonder why I don’t do it more often,” she added in her weekend checklist. The quote carries a gentle truth many can relate to: the endless scroll can drain more than we realize.For fans of the couple, the sentiment is layered. They are happy that Steinfeld and Allen get more uninterrupted time together, yet there is a longing for updates.She hasn’t posted a photo with Allen since their wedding in May. The couple shared a rare peek into their personal joy on June 18 when she wrote, “HUSBAND !,” and Allen captioned his own post, “Wifey ❤️”. Since then, they have kept their private life more protected and selective.The timing of this detox is not accidental. It aligns with a high-stakes Week 13 game between the Buffalo Bills and the Pittsburgh Steelers on November 30 at Acrisure Stadium. Avoiding the flood of reactions, commentary and speculation might be her way of maintaining calm during a pivotal weekend for her husband’s career.Steinfeld has been open about the future she envisions with Allen. She has shared with Bustle that starting a family is on the horizon, and she feels she is stepping into the dream version of her life. Gratitude anchors her daily perspective, and she continues to adapt her schedule to support Allen during the NFL season.

Over the past week, social media lit up with claims that Los Angeles Chargers quarterback Justin Herbert and singer Madison Beer were in the process of buying a $20 to $25 million mansion together.Posts on Facebook, Instagram and Threads all pointed to Deuxmoi as the source, and many took it as fact. There is just one problem. None of it is true. The story began with user generated posts claiming Herbert and Beer were looking for a luxury estate, and it escalated into a full blown belief that the pair were investing in real estate together.The mansion speculation grew because the posts looked polished and used the same confident language, often paired with photos of Herbert and Beer. Fans shared them widely, and the claim jumped from platform to platform with surprising speed. No official report supported the allegation, but the public visibility of the couple made it easy for many to assume that something major was happening behind the scenes. They were first spotted together in August, then caught on camera sharing a pregame kiss on Oct. 5 before the Chargers played Washington. Later, they appeared courtside at a Lakers game and showed up at Dodger Stadium during the World Series.With every appearance, public curiosity grew.What their real relationship looks like is far simpler. Herbert is known around the league for maintaining a quiet personal life. He does not post intimate moments and rarely discusses anything that is not football related. That calm silence leaves room for speculation. Beer has also remained private, even as she prepares for her next album release in early 2026. The two have been seen together often this season, and Beer has been photographed supporting him at multiple Chargers games. Their relationship seems steady and genuine, but there is no credible indication that they are making a major financial purchase together.There is no legal filing or credible real estate record showing Herbert and Beer are purchasing a mansion. Fact checking confirms that it remains an unverified claim. Meanwhile, Herbert is locked in on the Chargers playoff hopes, throwing for 2,691 yards with 19 touchdowns and nine interceptions this season. Herbert and Beer are dating. That part is real. The mansion rumor is not.Also Read: Aaron Rodgers injury update: Steelers offense derailed after veteran QB suffers another setback in physical Bills clash","Los Angeles Chargers quarterback Justin Herbert and singer Madison Beer were rumored to be buying a $20 to $25 million mansion together.

Steelers forced to turn to Mason Rudolph



Pittsburgh’s hopes took a heavy blow on Sunday when Steelers quarterback Aaron Rodgers was knocked out of the game against the Buffalo Bills after a punishing sack. The crowd fell silent as Rodgers, already battling a healing wrist fracture, hit the turf with visible pain on his face. The moment shifted the momentum of the matchup and raised fresh concerns about the team’s stability under center.Rodgers was hurt on the first play of the second quarter after Joey Bosa burst through from behind and forced a fumble. Bills cornerback Christian Benford recovered the ball and ran it back for a touchdown, while Rodgers was left shaken. The quarterback had blood on his face, and the hit appeared to aggravate his already injured left wrist. He had fractured it earlier this season and only just returned to practice this week. The sight of him clutching that wrist had Steelers fans holding their breath.With Rodgers sidelined, the Steelers turned to backup quarterback Mason Rudolph. On his first attempt, he threw an interception to Christian Benford, a tough welcome into a high pressure situation. Rudolph had previously started in the team’s loss to the NFC-leading Chicago Bears on Nov.23, where he completed 24 of 31 passes for 171 yards with one touchdown and one interception. His experience helped, but the offense looked unsettled without Rodgers leading.Rodgers was taken to the blue medical tent soon after the hit. Observers saw him later return to the sideline with a jacket on and without his helmet. At that point, reporters noted, “Rodgers has emerged from the tent but gave his helmet to someone on the sideline and has put on a jacket. For now, it looks like his day might be done.” The team had not issued an official medical update, but the uncertainty was heavy.He had already missed Week 12 after suffering three fractures in his left wrist in Week 11 against the Cincinnati Bengals. That kept him out for the second half of that game and then the full game the following week. Rodgers returned to practice heading into Week 13 without an injury designation. Now, the concern is whether this latest blow worsened the injury and what it means for Pittsburgh’s playoff aspirations. The hit also caused a bloody nose, which raised worries about his head, and potentially a concussion evaluation. The coming days will reveal whether this was a minor setback or a major turning point in the Steelers season.Update: Rodgers returned to the game after some time.Also Read: Travis Kelce hypes up Shedeur Sanders after standout Browns performance, fueling excitement around rising NFL star","Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Aaron Rodgers was knocked out of the game against the Buffalo Bills.

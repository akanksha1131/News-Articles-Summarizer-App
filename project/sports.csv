"World Chess Championship: D Gukesh vs Ding Liren: Deception, play-acting, et al - The other side of the chequered game",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/chess/d-gukesh-vs-ding-liren-deception-play-acting-et-al-the-other-side-of-the-chequered-game/articleshow/115584143.cms,"D Gukesh and Ding Liren

Poker-faced Gukesh, expressive Ding a study in contrasts

China's Ding Liren is already being hailed a moral victor, even before the first chess piece has moved in his World Chess Championship match against D Gukesh that starts in Singapore from Monday.For, despite the general perception of Chinese being inscrutable and stoic, the chess community is almost united in their assertion that the 32-year-old World No. 23 is not faking his mental vulnerability and that it is not his strategy to lure Gukesh into complacency.Elite GM Levon Aronian told TOI: ""Ding is not a tricky guy. I don't see that. He may not be in the best state, it is maybe caused by the lingering effects of the Covid pandemic or him not being able to play for a long period. But he is going to fight it out. He won't come to Singapore and resign, no.""But what is also clear that all of the chances are on Gukesh's side,"" Aronian reiterated.RB Ramesh, coach and R Praggnanandhaa's mentor, too provided some insight. ""Ding is genuinely suffering,"" he said, ""When Prag faced Ding in January, I remember him telling me after the game, ‘His hands were shivering while making the moves.' Something is not right with Ding. And playing against youngsters makes him even more stressful. So, he won't enjoy this match.""Gukesh's early coach Vishnu Prasanna said, ""You start doubting Ding when he says, ‘I am not afraid of losing but I am afraid of losing badly'. There is no need to say that.""Is Ding being too forthright? Gukesh has said he is prepared to play the best version of Ding, eliminating concerns of complacency.Faking, or deception, is not only allowed in sport but often marvelled at due to its brilliance in execution, and impact. But in chess, a cerebral sport, this feigning is so subtle that it goes unnoticed by the spectators, many watching the board and not the players.In his 2008 title match in Bonn, Viswanathan Anand famously scored two wins with black against Vladimir Kramnik . In one of those wins, he had prepared an entire line. Conventional wisdom said that it was better for white. But the Indian genius had found an exciting initiative with black.The trick lay in the fact that during the game, Anand had to give the impression of being ""out of the book"" and trying to attain equality. For, even a hint of the line being prepared would have alerted Kramnik and he would have deviated to a safer territory. Talk about being poker faced!Soft signals too are important in the game. Anand had said elite players won't need a cheating gadget but just a small hint — eg. a chess engine's evaluation number (plus 1, minus 2, etc.) — is enough to take the position to the desired territory. Gukesh is unlikely to give an inch to Ding in terms of body language. For, he is poker faced almost all the time, giving away nothing, making it quite difficult to judge whether he is placed better or not. But some players, Garry Kasparov , famously, are expressive and can convert that into a tool of gamesmanship.It includes removing the wristwatch, pressing the chess clock harder or moving the pieces forcefully, sipping water, rubbing their faces with their hands, making expressions with eyes and holding eye contact. Anand had said the players also learn to decipher breathing signals from the opponents.While all this doesn't change the board position, it can influence the course of the game in a big way. Such novelty is not announced. In chess, that bubbly must be uncorked without noise.","Ding Liren is already being hailed a moral victor, even before the first chess piece has moved in his World Chess Championship match against D Gukesh.

The IPL Auction 2025 on November 24 and 25 in Jeddah is set to be an exciting event, with teams strategizing to build their squads under the influence of the Impact Player Rule and other evolving dynamics.Here's an overview of how players are selected during the IPL auction process and what to expect for 2025:Players (both domestic and international) interested in participating in the IPL register through their respective boards and agents.Emerging talents from India register through the BCCI , while international players apply via their respective cricket boards.Franchises review the complete list of registered players and submit a shortlist of players they are interested in. This results in the final auction pool.Players are divided into categories based on their roles (batsmen, bowlers, all-rounders, wicketkeepers) and set with a base price, ranging from Rs 20 lakh to Rs 2 crore. The base price helps franchises gauge starting bids.The auction typically begins with marquee players who are high-profile and expected to fetch top bids.These include star Indian players, popular international players, and performers from the previous IPL or ICC tournaments.The rest of the auction is conducted in blocks, organized by roles like:BattersBowlers (fast and spin)All-roundersWicketkeepersA separate round is held for uncapped players (players who haven't represented their national team). These include emerging domestic talents and breakout performers from domestic tournaments like the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy.Toward the end of the auction, unsold players are reintroduced in quick succession. Teams often pick value players in these rounds.Each player enters the auction with a base price, and franchises bid in increments to secure the player.Intense bidding wars often happen for marquee players or those fitting a team's specific needs.Once bidding slows, the auctioneer announces the player as sold to the highest bidder.Players who receive no bids in the initial round can be brought back into the accelerated rounds if teams show interest later.To ensure a balanced squad, teams must adhere to specific rules:18 players25 playersA maximum of 8 overseas players per squad.Teams must operate within a fixed budget.Teams aim for a mix of specialists and all-rounders to adapt to the Impact Player Rule.Before the auction, franchises are allowed to retain key players. This limits the number of available marquee players in the pool.Teams can trade players with other franchises in the trading window before the auction.Teams will focus on players offering flexibility (all-rounders, utility players).Teams might prioritize death bowlers or spinners, given their impact in crucial stages.Uncapped Indian players and emerging stars could attract significant attention.All-rounders who can bowl economical overs and finish games will see intense bidding wars.The IPL 2025 Auction will follow a structured yet dynamic format, with teams leveraging the latest trends and rules to build versatile squads.Expect franchises to go all-out for flexible, impactful players who can adapt to mid-game changes-a key factor in the modern IPL.","The IPL Auction 2025 on November 24 and 25 in Jeddah is set to be an exciting event.

(AP Photo)

On dramatic Day 1, captain Bumrah stars with 4-wicket haul to leave Oz gasping for air as India fight fire with fire after being bowled out for 150; hosts reeling at 67/7

'It was a great feeling': Debutant Nitish Reddy on getting cap from idol Virat Kohli

India captain Jasprit Bumrah showed ample evidence of the endless spirit in his heart and the freakish skill in his bowling bones as he brutalized Australia with his initial spell of 6-2-9-3. With the shadows of the stands engulfing Perth's Optus Stadium, he even returned later on Day One to dismiss his opposite number, Pat Cummins , to end the day with 4/17.It left the hosts reeling at 67/7. As many as 17 wickets fell on Friday, on a surface that offered liberal seam and bounce.That was after Bumrah himself had made a questionable call at the toss of electing to bat on a grassy pitch where India got bundled out for 150 at the stroke of tea. Josh Hazlewood (4/29) and Mitchell Starc (2/14) suffocated the Indian batters by bowling a relentless line and length and Mitchell Marsh showed that his West Australian teammate Cam Green's injury-forced absence wouldn't affect Australia's team balance.'The Bison', as Marsh is nicknamed for his broad shoulders, trundled in post lunch to send back Dhruv Jurel and Washington Sundar to offer the legendary pace trio of Cummins, Starc and Hazlewood a solid helping hand.If the first two sessions were a setback for the Indians, the final session was all about their fightback, and it was Bumrah that made it possible. He dismissed debutant Nathan McSweeney LBW by bowling fuller and successfully reviewing a decision adjudged not out by Richard Kettleborough.After a few unsuccessful overs from over the wicket to the stubborn Aussie lefthanded opener Usman Khawaja, Bumrah switched to round the stumps and opened Khawaja up to have him edging to Virat Kohli at second slip. Kohli, who had dropped Marnus Labuschagne off the second ball that the batter faced, made no mistake this time.The next ball, Bumrah dismissed India's perennial nemesis Steve Smith LBW when the batter indulged in his customary shuffle to meet the ball, but the 140.5 kmph thunderbolt seamed in sharply, skidded and struck him plumb in front. Harshit Rana, who was one of the two debutants India fielded along with Nitish Kumar Reddy, then castled the tormentor of India's dreams in global events, Travis Head. Rana's wobble seam delivery in the high 130s from round the stumps came in with the angle, hit the seam and moved 1.36 degrees away after pitching. Head had no chance in hell playing that one, especially sans footwork.Mohammed Siraj, bowling with better rhythm than he has shown in the past six weeks, played his part too, sending back Mitchell Marsh and Marnus Labuschagne after a painful 52-ball stay in which the Queenslander managed just two. In terms of turnarounds in moods and fortunes, this was as emphatic as it could get after Indian batters once again floundered to be dismissed in 49.4 overs, giving catching practice to men behind the sticks.Nine of them perished to catches in the slips or the 'keeper. Starc first accounted for Yashasvi Jaiswal as the batter did exactly what one is told not to do at Perth, drive on the rise, loosely. He was caught by McSweeney in the gully. Devdutt Padikkal, who was roped in as a makeshift No. 3 to replace the injured Shubman Gill, was nicked off by the metronomic Josh Hazlewood for a 23-ball duck.Virat Kohli walked in at 2-14 and employed an aggressive forward press technique with interception points earlier than all his previous outings. But Hazlewood got one to lift from a length to devour the Indian star for another single digit score.The much maligned and heavily trolled KL Rahul ironically looked the best batter on view as he defended stoutly and left judiciously. His controversial caught behind for 26 off Starc sunk India's hopes of going into lunch just three down. Rishabh Pant (37) and Nitish Kumar Reddy counterattacked for an entertaining 48-run stand, with Pant's falling scoop off Cummins over fine leg for six making it to the few batting highlights of a day dominated by bowlers.Both were enterprising against offspinner Nathan Lyon, hitting him out of the attack. Cummins, though, dismissed both close to tea. The Aussie skipper, however, would be disappointed with his returns of 67 from 15.4 on a pitch that offered so much help.He would also be annoyed at not reviewing a caught-behind appeal of Reddy off Starc when the debutant was still new to the wicket, as his 41 could prove decisive in a Test that is low-scoring and fast-moving.",Jasprit Bumrah takes 4-17 to leave Australia reeling at 67-7 on Day 1. India bowled out for 150 at the stroke of tea on a grassy pitch in Perth. Josh Hazlewood (4/29) and Mitchell Starc (2/14) suffocated the Indian batters.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115582967,imgsize-134270,width-400,resizemode-4/115582967.jpg"

His knock propelled Delhi to an imposing 623/5 declared in reply to Meghalaya’s 260.While Aaryavir's near-triple century was the cricketing highlight, his father’s tongue-in-cheek message resonated widely among fans, drawing attention to the pressure - and humor - of being the son of a cricketing great.","Aaryavir Sehwag came agonizingly close to a triple century with a spectacular knock of 297 in the Cooch Behar Trophy.

NEW DELHI: The 2024-25 edition of the Border–Gavaskar Trophy on Friday got off to a chaotic start as a record 17 wickets fell on the opening day of the Perth Test .As batters found themselves in the firing line, the quicks from both the sides enjoyed the grassy and bouncy conditions, pulling off incredible performances.And amid a bowlers' show at the Optus Stadium in front of a packed house, a KL Rahul contentious call added more spice to the drama as his caught behind dismissal became a big talking point of the day.Late in the first session, Rahul, batting on 26, was adjudged out caught behind by the third umpire after on-field umpire Richard Kettleborough had ruled the decision in Rahul's favour.As the on-field umpire gave a cold shoulder to the appeal from the Aussies, the hosts used DRS to challenge the decision. Third umpire Richard Illingworth then surprisingly overturned the call despite not having sufficient evidence to overturn the on-field call.The decision sparked outrage with former players from both the countries questioning the third umpire's decision to overturn the on-field official's not out call.Here's a look at who said what on the Rahul controversial call:""It got overturned obviously, but I thought it was regulation, the sound it made, the timing of it, I thought it was just a regulation wicket,"" Australian quick Mitchell Starc said after day's play.""First of all, disappointed with what was provided to the TV umpire,"" Manjrekar said on Star Sports.""He should have got more evidence. Based on just a couple of angles, I don't think such an important decision in the match should have been made. My point is, with the naked eye there's only one certainty and that's the pad being hit by the bat. It's the only visual certainty we've got that with the naked eye. For everything else, you needed the aid of technology, which is Snicko.""So ideally, if there was bat, as an edge to the ball, there should have been an earlier spike because clearly two events there, and the umpire obviously heard one noise. The visual certainty was bat hitting the pad. If that was the spike, then there wasn't an outside edge. If we were shown two spikes, then you could say the first one was the bat. So it was a poor supply of technology to TV umpire, and he should have said he can't nail it.""If there weren't two spikes, they should have gone with the visual evidence which was bat hitting the pad. I think it was poor all around, and I don't blame the on-field umpire. You got to feel for KL Rahul, the amount of hard work that's been put opening the innings. And such a big moment personally for him when you look at his career and for India too. Travesty in a way,"" Manjrekar added.",A record 17 wickets fell on the opening day of the Perth Test on Friday.

The middle-order will be manned by skipper Jitesh and Wankhade. Shubham Dubey and Karnewar are likely to be drafted in to provide the late flourish and also roll their arm over. Akshay Wadkar, the longer format skipper, is tipped to get the lone slot left in the batting order.The SMAT will also see the return of white ball specialists Yash Thakur, Darshan Nalkande and Dipesh Parwani. Harsh Dubey , who was in red-hot form in the longer format, is certain to be in the playing XI as the lone specialist spinner.In the last edition of the tournament, Vidarbha reached the quarterfinal stage where they lost to Delhi.

KOLKATA: With the Border-Gavaskar Test series getting off to an interesting start, all eyes will be on Mohammed Shami 's fitness and performance when Bengal open their Syed Mushtaq Ali (T20) campaign against Punjab in Group 'A' encounter in Rajkot on Saturday.The pacer announced his comeback to competitive cricket almost after a year by picking after seven wickets against Madhya Pradesh in the Ranji Trophy last week. The India team management are keen to have Shami back in the India side but preferred to give the pacer some more time to get his rhythm back. BCCI 's head of sports science Nitin Patel and National Cricket Academy (NCA) trainer Nishant Bordoloi have travelled with Shami to Rajkot to monitor his progress.India's highest wicket-taker in the 2023 ODI World Cup, Shami will once again spearhead the white-ball attack with Ishan Porel as Bengal will look to make a winning start. With veterans Anushtup Mazumder and Wriddhiman Saha not playing the tournament, the onus will be on skipper Sudip Kumar Gharami and Sudip Chatterjee to ensure runs on the board. Bengal will look to youngster Abhishek Porel, who is back from India 'A' tour Down Under, to carry on his last IPL form and give them an explosive start. All-rounder Shahbaz Ahmed is also likely to play a key role for the side.Bengal bowlers will have their task cut out against a strong batting Punjab line-up led by skipper Abhishek Sharma. The opener has not quite fired against South Africa in the recently-concluded T20I series and will like to make a statement in the tournament.

NEW DELHI: Looking to secure a back-to-back World Test Championship final berth, reigning champions Australia collide with powerhouse India in the marquee Border-Gavaskar Trophy that commenced from November 22 in Perth.With India suffering a shock home series whitewash to New Zealand recently, the race to the WTC final spot has now spiced up with as many as five teams vying for a place in the finale at Lord's in June next year.However, Australia sit pretty at the top of the WTC table at the moment with a solid 8 wins in 12 matches in the current 2023-25 cycle.After India's unprecedented loss to the Kiwis, second-placed Aussies jumped to the top of the table and currently have 90 points from 12 games and a percentage point of 62.50.But this doesn't guarantee the champions a spot in the final yet as they still need to win a minimum of four of their remaining 7 matches against India (5 Tests at home) and Sri Lanka (2 Tests away).In the ongoing cycle, Australia have been a force to reckon with but they too have had a couple of shock results coming their way. While the West Indies stunned them in their own backyard, the Aussies also drew the Ashes in England despite having a 2-0 lead.As Australia now gear up for their last leg of this WTC cycle, here's a look at how they have fared so far in the third edition of the WTC:1st Test - Birmingham, June 16-20 -2nd Test - Lord's, London, June 28-July 02 -3rd Test - Leeds, July 06-09 -4th Test - Manchester, July 19-23 -5th Test - The Oval, London, July 27-31 -1st Test - Perth, December 14-17 -2nd Test - Melbourne, December 26-29 -3rd Test - Sydney, January 3-6, 2024 -1st Test - Adelaide, January 17-19 -2nd Test - Brisbane, January 25-28 -1st Test - Wellington, February 29-March 03 -2nd Test - Christchurch, March 8-11 -Currently at the top of the table, Australia still need four wins if they are to defend their title and they can have a best possible finish of 76.32 percentage points.This means that even if Australia end their home series against India with a 2-2 result, they will still have two Tests against a relatively weaker Sri Lankan side next year to make it to the final.",Reigning champions Australia face off with India in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy.

The storyline will be the fate of India's ageing quick bowlers, Bhuvneshwar Kumar Umesh Yadav , and Ishant Sharma All three pacers had tasted success at the international level but find themselves on the wrong side of 30 and not in the scheme of things in the national set up, raising the question: will IPL franchises still place their bets on these experienced pacers?Bhuvneshwar, once a vital cog in India's limited-overs bowling attack, was released by Sunrisers Hyderabad ahead of the auction. While his swing bowling and ability to bowl in the powerplay remain assets, his form has fluctuated.The right-arm pacer, who last donned the Indian jersey in November 2022, recently featured in the Uttar Pradesh T20 League, where he had an underwhelming performance, managing just seven wickets in 11 matches.His below par performance in UPT20 might have an impact in determining whether franchises feel he can still be the go-to bowler, particularly for his swing skills that could come in handy on fresher pitches.Umesh Yadav, another seasoned campaigner, has been a key figure for India in Test cricket, but his limited-overs appearances have been fewer in recent years. Known for his fiery pace and ability to bowl with aggression, Umesh has often been inconsistent.He was released after featuring in just seven matches for the Gujarat Titans in 2024, where he claimed eight wickets at an average of 26.25 and an economy rate of 10.00. His inconsistent form, coupled with the team's overall performance, resulted in him being sidelined for several games.However, his ability to generate pace, especially in the first six overs, could make him an attractive option for teams looking for an experienced fast bowler who can deliver under pressure.Ishant Sharma, who has been a stalwart in India's Test line-up, has proven to be a force in longer formats but hasn't been a consistent presence in the shorter formats. His height, bounce, and disciplined line and length could appeal to teams looking for an experienced bowler to lead their attack.The lanky pacer, who has been with Delhi Capitals since 2019, was released by the franchise ahead of the auction.","The IPL 2025 mega auction is just around the corner.

Argentina to play two friendlies, says

sports minister; assures fans

will be part of squad

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Kerala, it appears, has its mind, and heart, firmly set to deliver Argentina - and Lionel Messi - to its people. Even if the budget of this exercise runs up to anything between Rs 30-40 crores.Kerala sports minister V Abdurahiman on Wednesday assured the state's football fans that the world champion football team, including their talismanic captain, will play two international friendlies but stopped short of making a formal announcement. The minister also mentioned that representatives of the Argentina Football Association (AFA) will visit Kerala within a couple of months to finalise La Albiceleste's trip to the state.""The world's No 1 football team Argentina is coming to Kerala. Lionel Messi too will be here,"" V Abdurahiman declared during a media interaction at the state secretariat on Wednesday.""There will be two matches. (But) It is not right on my part to make a formal announcement. That will be done by AFA,"" he added.The idea of football diplomacy seems to have the full backing of state chief minister, Pinarayi Vijayan as well. ""Kerala is set to make history as World Cup champions Argentina are expected to visit next year! This dream is becoming a reality thanks to the state government's efforts and the support of @ AFASeleccionEN. Let's gear up to welcome the champions and celebrate our love for football!"" the CM posted on his official X handle.Argentina's opponents for the friendlies have not been finalised, but indications are that it will be a prominent Asian side. It is understood that AFA officials have requested the state govt to provide them with a list of opponents, from which the AFA will pick their rivals.The dates of the matches will also be finalised after the AFA team's visit, but it is understood that the state govt is exploring the possibility of hosting the matches next Oct.Abdurahiman has sought the help of traders in the football-mad state to mobilise funds to bankroll such a high-profile fixture. TOI had first reported in Jan this y ear that the Kerala govt was keen on hosting the South American giants, possibly during the Oct 2025 international window. ""The estimated amount to bring the Argentine national team to India is said to be between Rs 30-40 crore,"" the report said.Though the minister claimed that Messi would return to play in India 14 years after he and Argentina first played in Kolkata in 2011 against Venezuela, it would be too premature to confirm his presence in the squad.","Argentina to play two friendlies, says Kerala sports minister.

It was the best doubles of our lives.""For Britain it felt like a massive opportunity missed to win the competition for the first time and reach the final for the first time since losing to the United States in 1981.After Raducanu fought off the hard-hitting Hruncakova to seal her third singles win on the spin, Britain's number one Boulter, who like Raducanu had not lost a set in the ties against Germany and Canada, seemed in control.The world number 24 cruised the first set 6-2 but Sramkova then found another level to seize command of the second.She led 4-1 and although Boulter clawed it back to 4-4, Sramkova kept her country in the hunt by taking it to a decider.Sramkova carried the momentum into the third set to lead 3-1 but again Boulter fought back, cheered on by a sizeable British contingent in the small arena, to make it 3-3.It was Sramkova who kept her nerve though and at 4-5 down, Boulter served a double fault to give her opponent match points and she then struck a ball tamely wide to end the contest.Mihalikova and Hruncakova then took apart a disappointing British doubles duo to book Slovakia's place in Wednesday's showdown when they will again be big underdogs.Italy will be led by world number four Jasmine Paolini who will also partner Sara Errani, with whom she won gold at the Paris Olympics, in the doubles.""We are underdogs again but our confidence is growing,"" Liptak, in charge since 2009, said.""It's a dream, I've been a captain for many years and this was my dream to play in the final.""",Slovakia reach the Billie Jean King Cup final as doubles pairing Tereza Mihalikova and Viktoria Hruncakova complete a stunning comeback victory.

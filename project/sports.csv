Since topping the table and finishing runners-up in 2014, PBKS have reached the playoffs just once in a league that has spanned 18 seasons.Now, with the long wait finally over, Punjab are not just dreaming of a top-two finish — they’re daring to push all the way to the final and chase a maiden IPL title.Their confidence has received a timely boost with the arrival of their overseas quartet — Marcus Stoinis, Josh Inglis, Aaron Hardie, and Kyle Jamieson — who joined the in-form Indian core in Jaipur three days ago.All four are available for selection as PBKS look to seal a top-two spot with a win over a demoralised Delhi Capitals side, who were knocked out of playoff contention following a heavy loss to Mumbai Indians on Wednesday.Total matches played: 33Punjab Kings won: 17Delhi Capitals won: 16Punjab Kings and Delhi Capitals have faced off 33 times in the IPL, with PBKS holding a narrow edge, having won 17 matches compared to Delhi’s 16 victories.Weather won’t be a concern in Jaipur on Saturday, with no rain forecast for the match. Temperatures are expected to soar, with a high of 41°C and a low of 28°C.The pitch at the Sawai Mansingh Stadium promises a balanced contest between bat and ball.

Where to follow India's Test squad announcement?

India's cricket selectors will kick off the team's long transition in the Test format when they announce a new captain and finalise the squad for what is expected to be a challenging five-match series in England.The 25-year-old Shubman Gill is the leading contender for the captaincy role, as India begin a new cycle in the World Test Championship (2025-27) following the retirements of key players Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma within a week.By straightforward logic, Jasprit Bumrah, who served as vice-captain during the last tour of Australia, should be promoted to captain. However, concerns over his long-term fitness and workload are likely to be obstacles in the decision-making process.Rishabh Pant, despite a poor IPL, remains an essential part of India's transition phase in Test cricket. He could be named vice-captain.Apart from the leadership puzzle, no significant changes are anticipated in the squad.KL Rahul and Yashasvi Jaiswal are expected to open in the first Test at Leeds starting June 20, with Sai Sudharsan as a strong candidate for a reserve opener.There is also speculation over whether Karun Nair, Sarfaraz Khan, or Shreyas Iyer will be included as an additional specialist batter.With R Ashwin retired, Ravindra Jadeja is set to be the lead spinner, and it will be interesting to see if the team opts for two or three spinners in English conditions.If only two spinners are chosen, Washington Sundar may get the nod over Kuldeep Yadav, who has proven his worth across formats.Pant remains the primary wicket-keeper and the likely reserve, with Dhruv Jurel expected to retain his spot.Chief selector Ajit Agarkar is scheduled to speak to the media after the squad is announced, discussing the team's rebuilding phase.While there’s enough experience in the pace attack led by Bumrah, questions remain about his endurance for a five-match series, along with concerns over Mohammed Shami's fitness.Can Shami recover quickly enough to handle the demands of a long series? Mohammed Siraj is anticipated to be the third quick, but if five fast bowlers are selected, Prasidh Krishna, Akash Deep, and Arshdeep Singh (who has yet to play Test cricket) will also be options.If the team opts for a left-arm pacer, Arshdeep will face competition from Khaleel Ahmed.India's squad for the England tour will be announced on May 24, 2025 in Mumbai.India's Test squad for England will be announced at 1:30pm IST (approximately)TimesofIndia.com will track and get you live updates of India's Test squad announcement for the five-match series vs England.","India's Test squad for the England tour will be announced at 1:30pm.

Philadelphia Union's form and potential threats

This weekend, Inter Miami will be looking to turn things around after a recent downturn, and the Union is just trying to keep space in the playoff picture. Inter Miami hopes to turn its season around with the return of star forward Lionel Messi, while Philadelphia aims to build on its unbeaten home streak.Both teams are going to go with robust lineups in what shapes up as a high-stakes and intense encounter with playoff implications on the line.Expect coach Javier Mascherano to set up a 4-4-2. Oscar Ustari, the veteran goalkeeper, is the natural choice to start between the sticks. Potentially also in the backline: Ian Fray at right-back, Tomas Avilés and Noah Allen as center-backs, and Jordi Alba on the left. Sergio Busquets is expected to anchor the midfield along with Yannick Bright in the center, with Benjamin Cremaschi and Telasco Segovia outside him. Luis Suárez will spearhead the attack, with Lionel Messi coming back from a slight adductor strain to perhaps partner him up front.Here's the projected Inter Miami CF lineup:Luis Suárez has been the most consistent offensive performer for FC Cincinnati despite those recent challenges. Messi can add a layer of creativity to bring Inter Miami back to form.Philadelphia Union comes into the match having not lost in six matches and will likely be organized and difficult to break down.Striker Tai Baribo has been in incredible form, with seven goals in league play and 12 in his last 11 competitive games. A good sign for Union attackers is that after sitting out a week and a half ago with a minor hamstring issue, he fully recovered in time for this match.A big boost for the Union defensively comes from the return of Olwethu Makhanya, who is back from suspension.

With One Knox becoming established at Covenant Health Park and further building its swift climb through the United Soccer League ranks, Fuller views Knoxville as fertile ground for professional soccer—even with potential in Major League Soccer.As One Knoxville SC prepares to play Indy Eleven on May 24 at Covenant Health Park, head coach Ian Fuller already has long-term visions. The former Minnesota United FC assistant coach thinks the city can sustain a Major League Soccer franchise — but only if the city itself comes to support soccer outside college campuses and Friday night lights.Fuller, who played professionally for Clemson University and was drafted by the New England Revolution in 2002, signed with One Knoxville SC this year with a purpose: to assist East Tennessee in developing into a soccer town. With more than a decade of coaching experience within Major League Soccer and extensive participation in developing clubs such as Orlando City SC and Minnesota United FC, Fuller understands what it takes to construct a franchise from the beginning.For Ian Fuller, there's more to it than victories. He talks of overall growth, explaining, “First and foremost, I care about the guys. I care about them as men ... I love coaching now, wanting to get the best out of our guys. I don't want them to give up opportunities. I don't want them to wake up at 40 and their careers are over and realize they didn't take advantage of everything.”The Fullers themselves have embraced Knoxville life, with Ian’s wife, Susannah Collins — a former CBS Sports soccer commentator — joining him in the move from New York City to Maryville. The change in pace has proven rewarding, with Ian saying, “We're enjoying every second of it. We sit on our wraparound porch. We sit out there every day and look at the Smokies.”Also read: Highest-paid MLS players in 2025: Where does Lionel Messi and Riqui Puig rank For One Knoxville SC and Ian Fuller, the journey is just beginning.

Brandon Williams admits to hazardous driving and insurance offenses



Court to decide fate of former Manchester United defender



Former Manchester United defender Brandon Williams was brought before the court after being involved in a high-speed collision, as he faces a maximum sentence of two years in prison. The 24-year-old footballer, who used to earn £3.4 million annually at Manchester United, pleaded guilty to dangerous driving. Prosecutors reported that Brandon Williams was traveling at almost 100mph as he sucked on a balloon, which has brought very serious issues of his conduct while driving into question.Manchester United youngster Brandon Williams is now facing the consequences of his actions in court after a devastating incident on August 20, 2023, in Cheshire. The Crown Prosecution Service confirmed that Brandon Williams was traveling in an Audi A3 at 99mph in a 70mph area on the A34 near Handforth. The crisis deepened when witnesses claimed to have spotted a balloon in his mouth during the incident—usually an indicator of nitrous oxide inhalation, though no official release came confirming the substance.Brandon Williams had a young woman with him at the time, and his driving style was ‘erratic, said authorities. He pleaded guilty to both offenses—dangerous driving and driving without third-party insurance—during an appearance in court that could lead to a custodial sentence of two years.Brandon Williams' run-ins with the law follow close on the heels of his stint with Manchester United coming to an end. Once touted as a talented full-back in the club's setup, Williams earned media attention for his active play and ability on the pitch early in his career.Nevertheless, his choices off the field have now eclipsed his athletic success.The judge will take several considerations into account when handing out the sentence, such as his prominent profile, the wantonness of his actions, and the possible risk to public safety. A prison term is still a possibility, awaiting the judge's ultimate decision.Also read: Ben Johnson says Caleb Williams is proud to be a Bear, despite early NFL Draft drama As sentencing looms, Brandon Williams waits with bated breath for the verdict that may decide the next chapter of his life.

Stoffel Vandoorne shares their strategy for Tokyo race

It cannot be just a coincidence that Maserati MSG Racing driver Stoffel Vandoorne started from the 14th position on the grid and went on to win the Tokyo E-Prix Round 8. He even managed to beat Nissan’s Oliver Rowland, who had started from pole. Vandoorne shined while others struggled with poor visibility, a slippery track, and grip issues as it rained cats and dogs during the Tokyo race. Not only that, he also recovered from a spin on the wet track to cross the finish line first. The Tokyo winner says it’s all because of how their plan fell in place to perfection.Stoffel Vandoorne revealed that their winning strategy involved a calculated risk of taking the Pit Boost early in the race, which could have worked in their favor if there had been a race stoppage, allowing them to save time during the gap.""It was not an easy race, but a lot of opportunities with the rain and the management. We kind of gamble a little bit with our strategy but it was also calculated at the same time. The plan perfectly played in our hands, and the chances of this happening in Formula E are very, very slim,” Vandoorne told Formula E in an interview.""It was difficult because I had to manage so many things. I was on the radio with my engineer in between laps and he was giving me advice on the gap that I had to Oliver (Rowland) to make sure I was safe enough with my energy.I was struggling, and I was down to 10% at some point and I had to bring the car home so there was a lot of management to do,"" he added.Vandoorne moved to Maserati MSG Racing last season and is in love with his new team. Talking about the same, he said, ""I’m just happy for the team, for myself, it’s been a little while. They are such a good group of people, some familiar faces from the past as well, their vibe is super cool, their base is Monaco and that is my home as well.

Tennis Fan Pope Leo XIV Meets With Italian Player Jannik Sinner, But 'Refuses' To Play With Him

Poll Do you believe the crowd's support will affect Sinner's performance? Yes, positively Yes, negatively No, it won't matter

World number one tennis player Jannik Sinner, returning from a three-month doping ban, addressed the media on Friday about his expectations for the French Open, acknowledging he anticipates a different atmosphere when he faces French player Arthur Rinderknech in the first round at Roland Garros.Sinner recently made his comeback at the Italian Open, reaching the final before losing to Carlos Alcaraz. The 23-year-old Italian had not played since winning the Australian Open in January.The tennis star served a doping suspension after testing positive twice in March last year for traces of clostebol, which doping authorities accepted was accidental contamination.""It's definitely going to be different. I know that. But I don't think they have something against me, no? It's right that they support the players who are from here, who are local here. It's the same when I play against American players in the US Open. So it's normal. You know, I got an amazing atmosphere in Rome because I'm Italian. It's right that the player who play in this city or country, that they got more support. So I know that. Last year I played also against some French players here.So I know a little bit what to expect.""When questioned about potential hostile reception in Paris following his doping suspension, Sinner remained uncertain, stating: ""Different moment because whatever happened happened. So let's see. I cannot answer that question.""Reflecting on his performance in Rome, Sinner acknowledged room for improvement. His best French Open performance was reaching the semi-finals last year, where he lost to eventual champion Alcaraz in five sets.""For sure it was great after three months coming back making final. It was my first big final on clay, which is not to underrate, because we worked a lot for that, but also it was a great feeling to be part of this final. Hopefully we are on time to make small changes for here. There are no miracles. I need some time. Matches are different than practice sessions.""The Italian champion expressed awareness of the challenges ahead in the Grand Slam format: ""But, you know, best-of-five is going to be a great test for me, trying to understand where I am. Yeah, let's see how my body will respond here. We have seen a couple of things where I can improve, and Grand Slams are just different. You know, you have to be mentally ready, physically too trying to use the right energy. It's all about being consistent and solid.

""Throughout the years I've improved a lot (on clay) and today I feel physically, mentally. .. my game is pretty much ready to play on clay. Yeah, I definitely feel stronger than ever,"" Sabalenka told journalists.Last year, an out-of-sorts Sabalenka was shocked by Russian teenager Mirra Andreeva in the quarter-finals in Paris. And she is taking no chances as she opens on Sunday against 75th-ranked Russian Kamilla Rakhimova.""I'm definitely not going to go for the same meal as before that quarter-final match, the lesson is learned,"" she smiled. ""I'm super motivated because I feel like last year I was really ready to be in the last stages of the tournament but my body didn't really feel the same. ""This year I'm motivated more than I was last year.""Sabalenka's reign as two-time defending Australian Open champion ended in a defeat in the final in Melbourne to American Madison Keys in January.""It honestly doesn't matter your ranking when you arrive in the big tournaments, as we see in the past. There is so many crazy upsets happening,"" continued Sabalenka, whose best finish on the Paris clay was the semi-finals in 2023.""I'm just trying to focus on my game, and nowadays I know I can do well in clay, so arriving here, I feel really strong and super excited, and hopefully this is going to be the year when I'm really going to be proud of myself on the clay court. ""At this point of my career, it's all about winning the titles, the big trophies, and I think you have to set up really huge goals for yourself.""Yeah, maybe sometimes really crazy goals. Yeah, I'm more into, like, winning than just reaching the finals, because losing in the final sucks, I hate it, so that's not the goal for me.""Clay is a surface on which the reigning US Open champion has had to work hard to get to a top level, but she believes she now has the ammunition. ""On clay court, power is not enough.

Former world number one Iga Swiatek was in a defiant mood as she looks to put a turbulent start to the season behind her ahead of the French Open Speaking to AFP on Friday just days out from the start of her title defence at Roland Garros, the five-time Grand Slam winner said ""people don't know me so they should stop finding reasons"" for her struggles in 2025.Swiatek fell at the semi-final stage of the Australian Open in January to eventual winner Madison Keys despite holding match point in the topsy-turvy tie. Since then, the 23-year-old has failed to reach a final this season and slipped to surprising defeats to Coco Gauff in the last four at Madrid and to Danielle Collins in the third round of the Italian Open.""Obviously it (losing in Melbourne) hurt because I was super close, and I never had a situation where I lost from a match point. So it was a little bit different,"" Swiatek said. However, the Pole insisted the defeat was not haunting her despite her poor subsequent form.""I wouldn't say (it hurt) for a long time, because it's my fifth year on tour, or sixth. So I already understand there's no point of being in a bad place for a long time after a match you lost,"" she explained. ""I was, on the other hand, happy with my performance in Australia, because all my matches were really solid, and my level was high.""So when I looked at the whole tournament and the whole picture, you know, I was happy about it.

However, her early exit from the Italian Open earlier this month has provided Swiatek more time to prepare for Paris and she said she has used that time well.""You know, right now, I felt like I had the most peaceful time to practice since the beginning of the season,"" Swiatek said. ""It has been going great. And on a practice court, I feel really good. We were working on some details in my serve and my forehand. But overall, you know, it looks great. I just need to implement that during the matches.""In addition to working on technical aspects of her game, Swiatek added she had thought deeply about her approach to matches.""In every match, you need different solutions. So it's not like you have one recipe of how you should do this,"" she said. ""For sure, I didn't play well against Danielle in Rome. And I took some time to think about why, and I found some solutions.

Novak Djokovic , who had not won a clay-court match this season before this week, starts his latest quest for a record-setting 25th major against American Mackenzie McDonald.Seeded sixth, Djokovic could have been drawn to meet either Alcaraz or Sinner in the quarter-finals, but Thursday's draw spared him from that prospect.Instead, he could run into 2024 runner-up Alexander Zverev in the last eight before a potential semi-final against Sinner. Alcaraz is in the other half of the draw.Zverev opens against US teenager Learner Tien.Alcaraz could play Fabian Marozsan or Luca Nardi in the second round, with towering Frenchman Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard a possible third round-opponent.The Spaniard is on course to meet 2021 runner-up Stefanos Tsitsipas or Ben Shelton in the last 16. Two-time finalist Casper Ruud is seeded to face him in the quarter-finals.In-form Lorenzo Musetti and fourth seed Taylor Fritz are also in that half of the field.""The confidence is really high right now. I've been playing great matches, I've got great wins in this clay season. I'm excited,"" Alcaraz said on Thursday.The 22-year-old has won in Monte Carlo and Rome this season. He also reached the final in Barcelona.Should Sinner get past the 72nd-ranked Rinderknech, he could go up against Richard Gasquet in what is the 38-year-old Frenchman's final tournament before retirement.Alejandro Davidovich Fokina potentially lurks in the third round with Andrey Rublev and Arthur Fils possible rivals in the last 16.Sinner could meet fifth seed Jack Draper or Alex de Minaur in the quarter-finals ahead of what would be a blockbuster clash with Djokovic.Three-time French Open titlist Djokovic would likely have to get beyond the likes of Denis Shapovalov and Daniil Medvedev to make another deep run.The 38-year-old Djokovic is appearing at Roland Garros for the 20th time.

NEW DELHI: As the clay court season reaches its big stage with Roland Garros , it once again reinforces the point in Indian tennis that the focus is on doubles and not singles. Leading the charge on that front is Yuki Bhambri , who was once the flag bearer in the singles department.The year, though, didn’t begin as Bhambri might have hoped. At the Australian Open, partnering Albano Olivetti, the duo bowed out in the first round.What has followed is a string of partner changes, not by design but by necessity, as Olivetti's injury and the volatile nature of the rankings forced Bhambri to adapt.His journey resumed with Croatian veteran Ivan Dodig at the ATP 250 in Montpellier. Since then, the Indian ace has had to recalibrate often. 2025 has so far witnessed Bhambri partnering with seven different players in 13 tournaments.Despite the instability, the results speak volumes. Bhambri (and Alexei Popyrin) clinched the ATP 500 title in Dubai, made it to the quarters at Indian Wells and Miami, and became India’s No. 1 in doubles last March, overtaking Rohan Bopanna , who had held that position since October 2019.Speaking to TimesofIndia.com before the Madrid Open, Bhambri acknowledged the highs and lows, ""I think it's part and parcel of our tennis, of rankings going up and down. I think tennis rewards you for consistency, and I've had good success over the last few months or so, which has just shown in the rankings.""But now comes another test, the clay. On the red dirt, Bhambri hasn't had the best results in the run-up to the French Open. Four of his last five clay appearances ended in first-round exits, with Robert Galloway being his regular companion in the latest tournaments.The 32-year-old, however, remains undeterred.""When you move on to clay, it's a lot slower. So you have to have a lot more patience. You have to be prepared to hit a lot of balls. You have to be prepared to slide on the court, find your footing, you know, be prepared for the bad bounces at times. So you're playing a very slow and patient game,"" he added.The only exception to Bhambri's clay troubles came in Bordeaux, partnering Galloway again. The pair fought in the ATP Challenger final but fell just short, losing 6-7(1), 6-7(2) to the fourth-seeded pairing of Francisco Cabral and Lucas Miedler.His dethroning of Bopanna ended a 286-week reign, coupled with a steady upward trend in his doubles rankings since the COVID-19 pandemic, signals nothing but sheer improvement.While Bhambri's stay at the top did not last long enough as the old warhorse Boppana has again occupied the India No.1 spot in the latest ATP doubles rankings, the New Delhi-born, who spends his days back in India mentoring kids at Roundglass Tennis Academy alongside his childhood coach Aditya Sachdeva, has grown more stubborn than ever.""I think the ultimate goal is to try and do better from here, to try and compete for more trophies. The French (Open) coming up, Wimbledon coming up soon in July, those would be the two key goals where I would really like to hopefully put my best foot forward and succeed,"" he noted.With Roland Garros just around the corner, the elements of something remarkable are there, but the big question remains: Can Bhambri, amid all the changes and challenges, find the right formula on clay? Indian tennis won’t have to wait long for an answer.",Yuki Bhambri is India's No.1 doubles player. The 32-year-old has had a string of partner changes this year.

He also reached the final in Barcelona.Finishing runner-up is still a hugely positive result for Sinner in his first tournament since his three-month ban for testing positive twice in March last year for traces of clostebol, a contamination doping authorities accepted was accidental.His progress in Rome also sets up the possibility of another final clash with Alcaraz at Roland Garros, with the two young stars of men's tennis set to be the two top seeds in Paris.Sinner was gunning to become the first Italian man to win at the Foro Italico since Adriano Panatta back in 1976, but he failed to make it a hat-trick of triumphs for home players in the Italian capital.Earlier Jasmine Paolini became the first woman since Monica Seles in 1990 to win the Rome singles and doubles titles when she and Sara Errani beat Veronika Kudermetova and Elise Mertens 6-4, 7-5.Paolini secured that brace of victories a day after overcoming former US Open champion Coco Gauff in straight sets, and becoming the first Italian woman to win the Rome singles title since Raffaella Reggi in 1985.","Carlos Alcaraz beat Jannik Sinner 7-6 (7/5), 6-1 in the Italian Open final.

Bombay Sport Exchange Ep 5: Shane Watson on how IPL gave him a lifeline & his tribute to Phil Hughes

CHENNAI: Young shuttler Sathish Kumar Karunakaran notched up the biggest win of his career yet as he defeated world No. 7 Chou Tien Chen of Chinese Taipei 21-13, 21-14 in the Malaysia Masters men’s singles opening round in Bukit Jalil on Wednesday.His dominance throughout the contest was a highlight; he pressed on the accelerator from the get-go to set the tone early. The 24-year-old Sathish has added variety to his game over the past year, and his efforts have paid off. The Tamil Nadu shuttler used jump smashes and his receptive skills to perfection, putting Chou in trouble.While Sathish has been inconsistent this season so far, this victory should do a world of good and restore his confidence. “I was searching for the breakthrough for quite some time and I am happy to have recorded my biggest win. What went in my favour was that I controlled the game better. For example, going to the net quickly, and that gave me an advantage,” Sathish told TOI from Malaysia.Sathish moved from training with Ajit Wijetilekk to working with his junior coach, Jivananthan Nair from Malaysia. “It has been a year under Jiva sir and everything is working well.My choices of shots have become much better than what they were earlier and that is making a big difference,” Sathish added.For Jivananthan, the latest result in singles was not a surprise, but he did not expect his ward to register a convincing victory. “We have been working on quite a few technical aspects, refining some parts of the game. Sathish was always a very straightforward player. He had to add variation to his game to compete against the top-10 players. And that is exactly what I did.“When you add variations, what happens is that consistency tends to drop for a while. It is a process. We knew that the process would take time and we were prepared for it. It was good that he was able to put those variations into good use as his opponent was not ready for it,” Jivananthan said.Sathish took a break from competitive action after the Sudirman Cup and shifted his focus to training. Considering the packed schedule, he had to pick and choose tournaments. “I skipped the Chinese Taipei Open and I will not be playing the Singapore Open next week as well. I did not have the option to take a break earlier and wanted to represent my country in the Badminton Asia Championships and Sudirman Cup.”Like in singles, Sathish has had an inconsistent run in mixed doubles. On Wednesday, after his singles win, the Sathish-Aadya Variyath duo lost 15-21, 16-21 to Indonesia’s Yustin Mulia and Ayu Kusumawati in the round-of-32. Although Sathish is going through a rough patch in mixed doubles, he believes that playing doubles is helping his singles game.","Sathish Kumar Karunakaran defeated world No. 7 Chou Tien Chen of Chinese Taipei 21-13, 21-14 in the Malaysia Masters men’s singles opening round in Bukit Jalil on Wednesday.

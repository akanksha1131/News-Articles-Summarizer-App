After a day of high drama, intense spells, and swinging fortunes, Mohammed Siraj lightened the mood with a humorous behind-the-scenes anecdote involving none other than Jasprit Bumrah Following his fiery four-wicket haul that helped India roar back into contention on Day 2 of the fifth Test against England, Siraj revealed a heartwarming exchange with his senior pace partner.“I told Jasprit Bumrah, ‘Why are you leaving? Whom would I hug after taking five wickets?’” Siraj shared in a video posted by the BCCI . “He said, ‘I’ll be here. You just take the five.’”Although Siraj narrowly missed the five-wicket mark, his spell was instrumental in dismantling England for 247, after they had looked dominant early in the day. His aggressive burst in the afternoon session, which included key wickets like Joe Root and Ollie Pope, showcased not just skill but character after a tough opening spell.Prasidh Krishna, who also grabbed four wickets, spoke about the growing bond within India’s pace unit: “Siraj and I have been playing together for five years, including in the IPL. We talk a lot off the field. Same with Akash Deep — the fast bowling group is looking really sharp.”The camaraderie off the field is clearly translating into performance on it. After England’s blazing start, 109 for 1 before lunch, India’s pace trio stormed back, triggering a collapse and ending the innings with just a 23-run deficit.India ended the day on 75 for 2, with Yashasvi Jaiswal unbeaten on 51, giving them a lead of 52. But while the numbers tell one story, the chemistry between Siraj and Bumrah, built on shared fire and mutual respect, continues to fuel India’s fast-bowling revolution.","Mohammed Siraj shared a humorous behind-the-scenes anecdote with Jasprit Bumrah.

The tension in the fifth and final Test between India and England reached a boiling point late on Day 2 as Sai Sudharsan and Ben Duckett were involved in a heated confrontation moments after Sudharsan was given out LBW on Friday at The Oval, London.The fiery exchange lit up an already dramatic day, which saw 15 wickets fall, the most in a single day of the series so far.The flashpoint occurred in the 18th over of India’s second innings, when Gus Atkinson trapped Sudharsan in front with a delivery that stayed low and skidded into the pads.The decision looked plumb to the naked eye, and despite a lengthy chat with his partner, Sudharsan opted to review. Replays confirmed what most already suspected: no bat, pitching outside off, impact in line, crashing into leg stump.But just as Sudharsan turned to walk off, Ben Duckett reportedly said something that stopped him in his tracks.Watch:The two cricketers came face to face in a fiery exchange, with words clearly being exchanged. It took Harry Brook and Ollie Pope to step in and diffuse the situation before things escalated further.The incident came just hours after Duckett and Zak Crawley had smashed the Indian bowlers in a wild opening session, putting on a 92-run stand in just 77 balls. Emotions have been simmering throughout the match, and Friday’s spat was the second heated moment of the day, following an earlier exchange between Joe Root and Prasidh Krishna.Despite the flare-up, the match remains finely poised. At stumps, India were 75/2, leading by 52 runs, with Yashasvi Jaiswal unbeaten on 51. But the Sudharsan-Duckett confrontation added a layer of drama and intensity to what’s already shaping up to be a classic series decider.","Sai Sudharsan and Ben Duckett involved in heated confrontation on Day 2 of the fifth and final Test between India and England at The Oval.

Yashasvi Jaiswal led the fightback with an unbeaten 51, showing class and intent in tough conditions.

His decision drew mixed reactions, with some calling it tactical, others questioning England’s approach in the final overs.As the players walked off, nightwatchman Akash Deep stood unbeaten with Jaiswal, and India led by 52.

Poll How likely is it that India will level the series after this Test match? Very likely Somewhat likely Unlikely

England’s fielding woes continued as Liam Dawson dropped a straightforward chance to dismiss Yashasvi Jaiswal during the second innings of the fifth Test at The Oval on Friday. The drop came in the 14th over when Jaiswal was on 40. Josh Tongue banged one short and Jaiswal, late on the pull, miscued it flat towards long leg — only for Dawson to spill the simplest of chances.This was the second life for Jaiswal in the innings. Earlier, when he was on 20, a thick edge off his bat was put down by Harry Brook at slip. Jaiswal, who scored a double hundred earlier in the series, seemed to be riding his luck once again.To make matters worse for England, Brook was also guilty of spilling a catch offered by Sai Sudharsan. These three missed opportunities may come back to hurt the hosts on a surface that has already shown signs of uneven bounce.India had lost KL Rahul early in the innings, caught behind off Tongue with the score on 7. Despite the early setback, the visitors will feel buoyed after a strong bowling performance earlier in the day.

Rain may have paused action at The Oval momentarily, but not before Harry Brook lit up the final Test with a shot that had glimpses of Rishabh Pant.Facing Mohammed Siraj, who has already picked up three wickets and was in the middle of a fiery spell, Brook produced a moment of brilliance that had fans and commentators talking. In the 48th over of England’s innings, the 26-year-old right-hander played a sweep off the pacer, falling over in the process but still managing to clear the long leg fence for six.Brook’s unorthodox hit and the way he lost his balance but still middled the ball reminded many of Pant’s fearless and improvisive batting. The England batter’s improvisation was especially striking because it came against a fast bowler amidst a strong spell.Ravi Shastri, on air at the time, summed it up perfectly, as he chimed, “Typical Harry Brook.”Pant, who is currently recovering from injury and supporting Team India from afar, shared a clip of England batting on Instagram with the caption, “Let’s go!!! @indiancricketteam”.The six also drew laughter from fans in the stands, with cameras catching a group of spectators visibly amused.Brook, who had made headlines for his unexpected over of spin in the drawn fourth Test and a minor incident with Washington Sundar, once again found a way to stay in the spotlight.While India were earlier bowled out for 224, England raced to 92 before Duckett fell.

Poll Do you believe that appointing an Indian coach for the national team is a step forward for Indian football? Yes, it shows trust in Indian managers No, we need international experience

Khalid Jamil, appointed as the new head coach of the Indian men’s football team on August 1, 2025, brings with him decades of experience and a deep understanding of the domestic game. Born in Kuwait City on April 21, 1977 to Punjabi parents, Jamil's early love for football was shaped by an under-14 camp where he met French legend Michel Platini. .After moving to India, Jamil turned down early offers from clubs like East Bengal and Mohun Bagan due to sponsorship reasons. He began his playing career with Mahindra United and later turned out for Air India and Mumbai FC.As a midfielder, he earned 40 international caps for India between 1998 and 2006 before injuries forced him to retire in 2009.Jamil's true impact, however, has been as a manager. Starting with Mumbai FC in 2009, he built a reputation for doing more with less. Over seven seasons, he kept the club competitive in the I-League despite limited resources.His biggest achievement came with Aizawl FC in the 2016/17 season, when he guided the underdog club to a historic I-League title , which was also the first ever by a team from Northeast India. The triumph made his name even more popular and showcased his ability to build winning teams.Stints with East Bengal, Mohun Bagan, and NorthEast United followed. In the 2020/21 season, he became the first Indian coach to guide a team to the ISL playoffs, leading NorthEast on a 10-match unbeaten run. Later, he was also named as the league’s first permanent Indian head coach with the same club.Jamil has also coached Bengaluru United, Nepal's Chitwan FC, and Jamshedpur FC, with valuable experience across various levels. With Jamshedpur, he led the side to a Super Cup semi-final in 2024.Now at the helm of the Indian national team and the first Indian to take on the role since 2012 , the 48-year-old brings a grounded, hard-working, and tactical approach. Known for his deep tactical understanding and ability to connect with players, his appointment shows India's attitude in putting trust in Indian managers and a step forward in shaping the next phase of Indian football.","Khalid Jamil has been appointed as the new head coach of the Indian men’s football team on August 1, 2025.

With Khalid Jamil’s appointment as the new head coach of the Indian men’s national football team, the All India Football Federation (AIFF) has brought back an Indian at the helm after over a decade. Jamil becomes the first Indian head coach since Savio Medeira in 2011–12 and joins an exclusive list of Indians to have led the national side in the 21st century.Jamil’s appointment was confirmed by the AIFF on Friday following a meeting of the federation's Technical Committee. He was selected from a final shortlist that included former India coach Stephen Constantine and Slovakian manager Stefan Tarkovic. The panel, which included national team director Subrata Paul, emphasised the importance of cultural familiarity and domestic experience, which was the criterion that tilted the decision in Jamil’s favour.His appointment comes after the departure of Spaniard Manolo Márquez, who stepped down last month following a winless year in charge. Márquez had taken over from Igor Štimac, whose five-year term ended after India failed to make significant progress in World Cup qualifying and regional tournaments.Jamil, a former India international midfielder, has earned praise in recent years for his work in the I-League and Indian Super League (ISL), most notably leading Aizawl FC to a historic I-League title in 2017.His ability to extract the best out of domestic talent and his deep understanding of the Indian football ecosystem were key factors in his selection.With the national team set for a period of rebuilding, Jamil's task will be to stabilise performances, integrate the next generation of talent, and lead India into the 2026 AFC Asian Cup qualifiers with a renewed sense of belief.Here’s a list of all national team head coaches in the 21st century:",Khalid Jamil has been appointed as the new head coach of the Indian men’s national football team.

Biggest signings so far ahead of the 2025/26 season

Poll Do you believe Liverpool will benefit the most from their signings this season? Yes No

As the 2025/26 football season gears up for action across Europe and beyond, the summer transfer window has once again provided major talking points. With leagues like the Premier League and La Liga kicking off in mid-August, clubs have made significant moves in the market to bolster their squads. Unsurprisingly, the Premier League clubs have led the way in spending, but teams across Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Germany have also made headlines.Liverpool dominate the top of the chart, making two of the summer’s most expensive signings. The headline-grabber is Germany’s Florian Wirtz, who joined the Reds from Bayer Leverkusen for a massive €125 million. The 22-year-old attacking midfielder arrives with high expectations after his stunning season in the Bundesliga and with the German national team at the Euros.Liverpool also landed French-Cameroonian striker Hugo Ekitiké from Eintracht Frankfurt for €95 million, signalling a clear shift to rebuild their frontline after the departure of Luis Díaz.Díaz, in turn, left Anfield for Bayern Munich in a €70 million move. The Colombian winger will look to revitalize Bayern’s attack after a transitional season under new management.One of the more surprising deals this summer is Victor Osimhen’s transfer from Napoli to Galatasaray for €75 million.The Nigerian forward was expected to move to another top-five European league, but Galatasaray’s ambition and financial power brought him to the Turkish champions in a statement signing.Manchester United have been active as well, adding firepower with Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford (€75 million) and Matheus Cunha from Wolves (€74.2 million). Both bring Premier League experience, with Mbeumo expected to slot in as a wide attacker and Cunha offering depth behind the main striker.Arsenal, chasing depth for another serious title push, secured the services of Spanish midfielder Martín Zubimendi from Real Sociedad for €70 million and Swedish striker Viktor Gyökeres from Sporting CP for €65.8 million. Zubimendi’s composure and tactical discipline will be a good fit for Arsenal’s midfield, while Gyökeres adds a dominant goalscoring presence up front.1. Florian Wirtz – Bayer Leverkusen to Liverpool – €125.00m2. Hugo Ekitiké – Eintracht Frankfurt to Liverpool – €95.00m3. Victor Osimhen – Napoli to Galatasaray – €75.00m4.

Jamie Gittens – Borussia Dortmund to Chelsea – €64.30mIn the Saudi Pro League, Al-Qadsiah continued their recruitment drive, landing Italy international Mateo Retegui from Atalanta for €68.25 million. The 26-year-old forward is expected to be a key figure in their attacking plans.To complete the list of the top 10 most expensive signings, Chelsea brought in promising English winger Jamie Gittens from Borussia Dortmund for €64.3 million. At just 20, Gittens is seen as one for the future, but the price tag shows Chelsea's continued commitment to investing in youth.With kickoff dates approaching fast and pre-season games already underway, fans won’t have to wait long to see how these blockbuster signings settle into their new roles.","The summer transfer window has once again provided major talking points.

How do Formula E and ABB work together?

What do ABB and Formula E say about the partnership?

After a successful Season 11, ABB and Formula E have announced that they will continue their partnership in the upcoming season. This gives ABB another opportunity to promote its new brand positioning via the ABB FIA Formula E World Championship, along with technologies that help industries take a cleaner route.Over a period of eight seasons, the partnership with Formula E has provided ABB a platform to showcase how technology can help industries outrun challenges, engage with customers around the world, and implement its own solutions into the series to improve reliability and efficiency. The partnership extension will provide a year-round opportunity for brand-building and activation, communicating ABB and its technology solutions to new global audiences, including Formula E’s international fanbase.ABB and Formula E will also join hands to engage a new generation of fans, collaborating with unexpected influencers and content creators to tell compelling stories that make advanced electrification and automation technologies tangible and exciting.The end of the mid-race car swap, a 150kW increase in power, top speeds that are 43 percent higher, and energy recovery increasing from 15 to 50 percent indicate how far Formula E technology has come to outperform on track.ABB has also built on its technical involvement in the series, supplying the race chargers from Season 9, and introducing its ABB Ability OPTIMAX® energy management software (Season 9) and Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) technology (Season 5) to the sport.ABB Head of Brand Paco Liebrand said, “We are pleased to be continuing our partnership with Formula E which, like ABB, is striving for a leaner and cleaner future. The synergy between the two organizations, combined with the global appeal of the Championship, makes it a great platform to promote our brand positioning.”He further said, “Formula E is increasingly working with content creators, influencers, and celebrities, with initiatives such as the Evo Sessions making an impact through digital channels beyond the racing itself, which is also an essential part of ABB’s new brand strategy. Going forward, we will be enhancing the way we harness the benefits of this collaboration, ensuring the focus is on delivering content and activations that reinforce our new messaging, build familiarity, and tell the ‘Engineered to Outrun’ story. ”Formula E Chief Revenue Officer Tiziana Di Gioia said, “Our renewed partnership with ABB is a testament to the commercial power and benefit of Formula E as a global platform that drives both brand and business growth. ABB, like our wider partnership portfolio, has and continues to see enormous value in collaborating with the fastest-growing motorsport on the planet, with viewership, commercial integration, and brand storytelling continuing to accelerate. Over eight seasons, ABB has moved from brand visibility to brand activation—integrating deeply into the fan experience, the sport’s ecosystem, and our innovation narrative.Also Read: Antonio Felix Da Costa shares happy memories as Porsche wins Formula E Teams and Manufacturers’ World Championships “This next chapter elevates the partnership even further. With ABB’s new positioning, we are co-creating opportunities across content, digital storytelling, and market engagement, transforming a title partnership into a year-round, value-generating relationship. It’s a model of how modern sponsorships should evolve, rooted in purpose and cultural alignment but measured by impact,” she added.Formula E Season 12 will begin with testing in Valencia in October.","ABB and Formula E have announced that they will continue their partnership in the upcoming season.

His strong performance at the ExCeL Arena helped Mahindra finish fourth in the Formula E Teams’ Championship and fifth in the Manufacturers’ Championship. He was joined on the podium on Sunday by Envision Racing’s Sébastien Buemi.Nyck de Vries’ double podium in London brought his season tally to three, having also finished second in Monaco. Reflecting on his second consecutive podium, de Vries said, “It was certainly a very challenging race. Obviously, Nick [Cassidy] didn’t want to get too low on energy compared to everyone behind, so he was making sure he stayed on the same energy level as us. That resulted in a bit of a concertina effect behind us. ”He added, “I’m very pleased to bring home another podium and secure P4 for our team, because they’ve done an incredible job. To think that last year we qualified last on merit, and now we’ve come such a long way to finish fourth in the championship — this is a great effort.I’m very proud of everyone at Mahindra.”Envision Racing’s Sebastien Buemi also earned his third podium of the season in London, finishing third behind Nick Cassidy and Nyck de Vries in Sunday’s Round 16.

I think I was lucky enough to avoid them well. I saved quite a bit of energy at the beginning, and that basically allowed me to take Attack Mode properly. So, in the end, I’m very happy with that.

Nick Cassidy takes third spot in Driver Standings

N ick Cassidy seems to have all the luck on his side as he went on to win his third race of the season, just days after announcing his exit from Jaguar TCS Racing at the end of this season. The New Zealander won the London E-Prix Round 15 race at the ExCeL Arena on Saturday. He himself called the win “unbelievable,” which was also witnessed by his grandmother at the circuit. Not only that, he also secured a front-row start for the Round 16 race on Sunday.Nick Cassidy himself was in disbelief over his third win and said, “It’s unbelievable! To win here at home for Jaguar and our team, in front of a lot of our friends, family, and partners who are here today, is incredible.”Talking about their strategy and the car, he said, “I wasn’t the happiest guy this morning, but that was for a reason, and I knew we had good potential in the car. In that race, I was able to show that, which is pretty cool.To be honest, it was a little bit fluid — a huge shoutout to my strategy team. I was really scared about not coming out of the pits after Pit Boost in the lead of that second group, and it was tight, but I was able to hang on there, and that’s what made the race.It meant that we could do the Attack Modes later, which was really powerful.”Nick Cassidy also shared a video montage of his podium celebration, where he sprayed champagne and celebrated with his team and family. He wrote, “Parked it in Victory Lane in London! That was incredibly special and will take a while to sink in.

Kush Maini is a pro when it comes to cricket knowledge

Who is Kush Maini?

Mahindra Racing’s Indian Formula 2 champion Kush Maini is not just an impressive presence on the track but also well-versed in his country’s favourite sport — cricket. The racer from Bengaluru recently took a cricket quiz and nearly scored a perfect 10/10, answering almost every question with precision. He is the only Indian to have won a Formula 2 race in Monaco and recently delivered an impressive performance at the Berlin Rookie Test, finishing among the top three in both sessions.A video of Kush Maini’s cricket quiz shows him getting momentarily confused with the first question, though he gave the correct answer initially. When asked about the number of players in a cricket team, he initially said “eleven” but changed it to “twelve” after counting the number of openers and following players.After that brief hiccup, Maini breezed through the quiz like a pro. He correctly answered questions about the criteria for a four and a six, and explained terms like LBW, duck, and clean bowled. He also knew the number of overs bowled in T20, One-Day, and Test matches.When asked which team Virat Kohli represents in the IPL, Maini confidently replied, “RCB… that’s me, can’t get that wrong.” He also tackled a question about the British singer who joked about not understanding cricket despite coming from the country that invented it.Maini answered “Ed Sheeran” — and was pleasantly surprised to learn he was right. He also knew that David Beckham was the English footballer who once played a friendly match with Sachin Tendulkar.Watch Kush Maini’s candid video here Kush Maini moved to England at the age of 13–14 to pursue racing. Originally from Bengaluru, he now spends more time abroad than in India. He became the first Indian to win the prestigious Monaco Grand Prix in Formula 2 earlier this year.He recently showcased his racing talent during the Berlin Rookie Test, representing Mahindra Racing. He finished second in the morning session and third in the afternoon. Speaking after the test, he said, “In the morning, we focused on 350kW runs, and in the afternoon, more on race runs. Whatever the run, we were always in the top three and really fast, so a good step was made. Whenever I get into this car, I leave with a smile on my face. ”Also Read: Berlin Rookie Test standouts Gabriele Minì and Kush Maini share insights after impressive runs Maini continues to shine on the track and, following his impressive performance in Berlin, may even join Formula E one day.","Kush Maini is the only Indian to have won a Formula 2 race in Monaco.

FIA and Formula E comment on agreement extension



In good news for Formula E, a multi-year agreement extension has secured the rights to the FIA Formula E World Championship for an additional 10 years from 2038, when the current agreement ends. This ensures a long and thrilling future for the FIA Formula E World Championship. The long-term extension will enable Formula E to grow further, build strategic long-range partnerships, and drive greater fan engagement.At present, Formula E continues to focus on its phased development strategy for its racing cars — delivering faster top speeds, greater acceleration, enhanced aerodynamics, and improved tyre performance. These developments highlight the series' increased relevance to consumers and the wider EV market, with greater “race to road” technology transfer.With electric vehicle sales projected to rise to over 40% of global vehicle sales by 2030, and global lithium-ion battery production expected to triple by 2030, the relevance of Formula E and its technological advancements is more critical than ever. The Formula E GEN3 Evo already represents a step-change in performance: 0–60 mph in just 1.82 seconds (30% faster than a current Formula 1 car), a 200 mph top speed, and nearly 50% of the energy needed to complete a race regenerated during the event.It is designed with sustainability at its core and includes tyres made with 35% recycled materials and bodywork incorporating recycled carbon fibre and natural fibres.Formula E sees the participation of major automotive manufacturers including Porsche, Jaguar, Nissan, Maserati, Stellantis, Mahindra, and Lola-Yamaha. Since its first race in Beijing in 2014, Formula E has grown by 20% year-on-year, reaching around 400 million fans globally and attracting a television audience of approximately half a billion.The Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA), the global governing body for motorsport and mobility organisations, has announced a multi-year extension to its agreement with Formula E Holdings Limited (majority-owned by Liberty Global).Mohammed Ben Sulayem, President at the FIA, said, “The extension of the agreement governing the FIA Formula E World Championship is a fantastic outcome for the sport and a clear reflection of our ongoing strategy at the FIA to foster long-term stability, innovation, and growth across all areas of motorsport.”He further said, “This milestone reaffirms our commitment to innovation, sustainability, and technological progress, which are all central to the Championship’s unique identity and purpose. It also aligns with our broader goal of increasing global participation and driving more accessible motorsport for all. We are delighted to be continuing this journey with Formula E, and I look forward to seeing it grow even further, both on and off the track, in the years to come. ”FIA Chief Commercial Officer Craig Edmondson, said, “Formula E has not only demonstrated impressive growth since its inception, but has also led the way on sustainable innovation in our industry. This is a landmark agreement for the FIA and Formula E, and we are excited to be working with the Championship in the years to come.”Liberty Global CEO Mike Fries said, “We’ve believed in Formula E since day one, and this extension reaffirms our confidence in where it’s headed. This is the motorsport of the future - a championship that combines the very latest technology, close-combat racing, and a mission that really matters.“With the FIA’s continued backing, we can now take the next big steps - scaling the sport, growing its global fanbase, and continuing to push the boundaries of what electric racing can achieve. With this new agreement in place, Formula E is now positioned better than ever to define the future of motorsport - more innovative, more inclusive, more sustainable - and to inspire the next generation of fans, drivers, and partners around the world. ""Also Read: Formula E London E-Prix 2025: Pascal Wehrlein tops FP1, Jake Dennis finishes second Formula E CEO Jeff Dodds also added, “Formula E’s growth since its inception has been nothing short of extraordinary, with hundreds of millions of fans and world-class teams and drivers deciding to choose highly competitive electric racing. This long-term extension of the partnership enables us to continue building the brand, investing in the product and delivering some of the most captivating racing that has made us famous. With this long-term extension, the opportunity that Formula E now has to impact world motorsport will be truly transformational.”","The FIA Formula E World Championship has been extended by 10 years.

Toronto:

Wimbledon champion Iga Swiatek cruised, Naomi Osaka battled through and Canadian Eugenie Bouchard called time on her WTA career with a gutsy second-round loss in Montreal on Wednesday.Switzerland's Belinda Bencic sent Bouchard into retirement with a 6-2, 3-6, 6-4 victory -- but not before the Canadian thrilled her hometown fans by seizing an early break in the third set.Spectators were on their feet, trying to will Bouchard to another victory on the heels of her first-round triumph on Monday -- her first WTA win since 2023.But Bencic won five of the last six games to vanquish Bouchard, who had announced earlier in July she would retire after a final appearance in her home tournament.""I think it's so special to play my last match here in Montreal on this court in front of you guys,"" a teary Bouchard said as she was honoured on court after the match.""I remember being a little kid sitting in these stands, hoping and dreaming that I would play on this court one day.""I grew up playing on these courts, and courts all around Montreal and near here, so it feels like such a full circle moment to finish my career here.""Bouchard, who rose as high as fifth in the world rankings, shot to prominence in 2014 when she reached the Wimbledon final and made semi-final runs at the Australian and French Opens.But her career was hindered by injuries, including a concussion suffered in a locker room slip at the 2015 US Open and a shoulder injury that required surgery in 2021.There was no drama for Poland's Swiatek, who breezed past Chinese qualifier Guo Hanyu 6-3, 6-1 in her first match since her crushing victory over Amanda Anisimova in the Wimbledon final.Swiatek, seeded second, broke Guo's serve six times to book her spot in the third round.It was much harder going for Japan's four-time Grand Slam champion Osaka, who saved two match points in a 4-6, 7-6 (8/6) 6-3 triumph over Liudmila Samsonova.Osaka, now working with Tomasz Wiktorowski after announcing on Monday she had split with coach Patrick Mouratoglou, surrendered early breaks in each of the first two sets.Wimbledon quarter-finalist Samsonova served for the match at 5-4 in the second and led 40-15. The Russian fired a forehand long on her first match point and on her second a lackluster drop shot effort gave Osaka an opening and the Japanese star pounced.Samsonova's double fault on break point allowed Osaka to level the set, and after storming back from 5-2 down in the tiebreaker to force a third set Osaka took control early, breaking Samsonova twice on the way to a 4-1 lead.""She definitely came out really hard and, for me, I was definitely overwhelmed and I didn't know if I should also be hitting winners,"" Osaka said. ""After a while I just tried to keep the ball in court.""Jessica Pegula, the two-time defending champion and third seed, saved five set points in the opening set on the way to a 7-5, 6-4 victory over Maria Sakkari of Greece.Australian Open champion Madison Keys, the sixth seed, opened her campaign with a 6-2, 6-1 victory over Laura Siegemund, avenging a third-round loss to the German at Wimbledon.Second-seeded Taylor Fritz struggled with three rain delays and a stubborn Spanish opponent on Wednesday, pulling out a tight 7-5, 7-6 (7/1) win over Roberto Carballes Baena at the ATP Toronto Masters.The second-round match was halted repeatedly by light rain, with the final 18-minute pause coming just as the second-set tiebreaker was about to start.But Fritz, winner of Stuttgart and Eastbourne titles this season, quickly sprinted to victory before heavier rains were expected to set in.The American was far from pleased with a win which was marred by 45 unforced errors and confessed that he has not yet felt on his game in Canada.""Even in practice I'm having a hard time putting the ball into the court,"" he said. ""But I'm happy to get through this one.""Everything is not feeling great, it's tough to control the ball.""Since I've been here it's been absolutely brutal. But I have another match to figure it out and hopefully I can play myself into the tournament.""Fritz's fourth-seeded compatriot Ben Shelton had no complaints after earning his first career win over gritty Frenchman Adrian Mannarino 6-2, 6-3.Shelton had dropped two prior meetings with 37-year-old qualifier Mannarino but said he was able to vary his serve to get over the line this time.""This win was huge for me. He's a shotmaker, he can take the racquet out of your hands,"" Shelton said. ""I've played well against him in the past and come up short, he can make things really difficult.""- Tiafoe hangs on -American Frances Tiafoe squeezed out a win after more than two and a quarter hours against Japan's Yosuke Watanuki, hailing his opponent's fighting spirit after a 1-6, 7-5, 7-6 (7/5) triumph.""He can hit a winner on any shot,"" Tiafoe said. ""I needed some luck in those last two sets to win.""Tiafoe managed just 19 winners to the 45 of his 158th-ranked foe, but now lines up against Australian Alexsandar Vukic, who defeated Briton Cam Norrie 6-3, 6-7 (2/7), 6-3.Andrey Rublev, runner-up in Canada a year ago to Alexei Popyrin, won his 250th career match on hardcourt as he beat France's Hugo Gaston 6-2, 6-3.The sixth seed needed four match points to advance after 86 minutes and now plays Italian Lorenzo Sonego, a 6-1, 6-4 winner over China's Bu Yunchaokete.Wimbledon quarter-finalist Flavio Cobolli of Italy delivered four aces in the final game of a rain-interrupted match to clinch a 6-4, 5-7, 6-4 victory over Canadian Alexis Galarneau.But Canadian Gabriel Diallo came out on top against his Italian opponent, beating Matteo Gigante 6-3, 7-6 (7/5) to next face Fritz.Montreal's Felix Auger-Aliassime suffered another early disappointment, losing his opening match in his home Masters for a third straight year as he fell to Fabian Marozsan 6-4, 6-4.Former top 10 ranking regular Stefanos Tsitsipas, now 30th in the world, continued a downward slide with a 6-4. 4-6, 6-2 loss to Australian Christopher O'Connell.Alex de Minaur, winner in Washington on Sunday, defeated Francisco Comesana 6-4, 6-2.""It was not pretty by any means,"" Australia's de Minaur said. ""The wind and rain made it quite tough. I'm happy I was engaged and focused from the first point to the last.""Backing up a good week is the toughest ask in tennis. You don't have a lot of time to enjoy the moment after a week of emotional highs.""You have to find a way to re-set and do it all over again.""","Wimbledon champion Iga Swiatek cruised, Naomi Osaka battled through.

Unmukt Chand Exclusive: Why he moved to the USA, playing in T20 leagues and ambitions

NEW DELHI: Chennai Super Kings kept their IPL playoff hopes alive with a thrilling two-wicket win over Kolkata Knight Riders , effectively knocking the defending champions out of contention on Wednesday.Chasing 180, CSK got over the line with two balls to spare. Dewald Brevis led the charge with a blistering 52 off just 25 balls, while Shivam Dube contributed a vital 45. Skipper MS Dhoni stayed unbeaten on 17 to guide his team home in the tense finish.For KKR, Vaibhav Arora was the pick of the bowlers with 3 for 48. Harshit Rana (2/43) and Varun Chakaravarthy (2/18) also chipped in with two wickets each.Earlier, after electing to bat, Kolkata posted 179 for 6. Captain Ajinkya Rahane top-scored with 48, while Andre Russell (38) and Manish Pandey (36 not out) made valuable contributions.For CSK, Noor Ahmad starred with the ball, claiming four wickets.This was the first time since 2019 that CSK successfully chased a target of 180 or more in the IPL. They had lost 12 consecutive matches while chasing 180+ totals prior to this win.Only Punjab Kings (15 between 2015-2021) have endured a longer losing streak in such chases, while Royal Challengers Bengaluru also had 12 unsuccessful attempts from 2019 to 2023.CSK's chase of 180 is now the second-highest successful run chase in IPL history after being 75 or fewer for 5 wickets. They were 60 for 5 at one stage. The only higher successful chase in such a scenario came earlier this season when Delhi Capitals chased down 210 after being 65 for 5 against LSG in Vizag.",Chennai Super Kings beat Kolkata Knight Riders by two wickets. Dewald Brevis top-scored for CSK with 52 off just 25 balls.

Rohit Sharma’s Final Test Practice: Exclusive Farewell Visuals

NEW DELHI: Former Indian cricket team captain Sourav Ganguly offered praise for Rohit Sharma following his retirement announcement on Wednesday, acknowledging India's numerous trophy victories under his leadership.""He is a great player for India, but someone has to leave the game. My best wishes to him. He had a good career, he will play One Day for India and IPL... BCCI's work is to support the player. When I was part of BCCI, we thought he would be a great captain for India and so he was. We won World Cup, Champion's trophy, Test Cricket under him,"" Ganguly told ANI.On Wednesday, Rohit Sharma announced his retirement from Test cricket, concluding a notable phase in his international career. The 38-year-old cricketer shared this news on Instagram, expressing appreciation to supporters whilst reflecting on his time in Test cricket.Rohit's Test career began against the West Indies in November 2013, spanning 67 matches. He accumulated 4,301 runs with an average of 40.57, including 12 centuries and 18 half-centuries.His highest score of 212 was achieved during a home series against South Africa in 2019, placing him as India's 16th-highest run-scorer in Tests. His journey began impressively with a score of 177 against the West Indies at Eden Gardens, Kolkata in 2013.Despite showing potential and delivering notable performances, Rohit initially faced challenges establishing himself in the Test format, particularly in away matches. Between 2013-18, he participated in 27 Tests, scoring 1,585 runs at an average of 39.63, with three centuries and 10 fifties in 47 innings.His highest score stood at 151. The right-handed batsman encountered difficulties away from home, notably in SENA countries (South Africa, England, New Zealand, Australia). Success in these nations is considered a benchmark for Indian batsmen.Rohit's home performance was exceptional, scoring 2,535 runs in 34 Tests at an average of 51.73, with 10 centuries and eight fifties across 55 innings. However, his overseas record showed 1,644 runs in 31 Tests at an average of 31.01, with two centuries and 10 fifties in 57 innings.In neutral venues, he played two Tests, scoring 122 runs at an average of 30.50, with a highest score of 43. His most notable overseas performance came during the 2021-22 Pataudi Trophy in England, where he led India's scoring with 368 runs in four Tests at an average of 52.57, including a century of 127, his sole hundred in SENA nations.","Rohit Sharma announced his retirement from Test cricket on Wednesday.

NEW DELHI: Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) secured their Champions League final spot with a 2-1 victory against Arsenal in the second leg of their semi-final, achieving a 3-1 aggregate win on Wednesday.Fabian Ruiz struck from outside the box in the 27th minute at the Parc des Princes, following Arsenal's initial attacking pressure.With PSG already ahead from Ousmane Dembele's first-leg goal, they maintained control despite Vitinha's missed penalty in the latter half.Achraf Hakimi extended their lead in the 72nd minute, whilst Bukayo Saka managed a consolation goal for Arsenal.The victory sparked celebrations across Paris, including the Champs-Elysees, as PSG advanced to face Inter Milan in Munich on May 31.This marks PSG's second Champions League final appearance, following their 2020 loss to Bayern Munich in Lisbon.""We have worked hard as a club to get this and to deserve it. It has been a long, hard road,"" PSG captain Marquinhos told broadcaster Canal Plus.""The job is done in terms of getting to the final but it's not finished, we want more. We really want to win the trophy.""Arsenal's European aspirations ended, falling short of reaching their second final since losing to Barcelona 19 years ago in Paris.With their last trophy being the 2020 FA Cup, Arteta's squad now focuses on securing another second-place Premier League finish.""To do what we have done in Paris today against this team is remarkable, but the fact is that we are out,"" admitted Arteta.""Sometimes you have to applaud the opposition, and what the 'keeper did in both games. He won the game for them,"" he added regarding PSG's Gianluigi Donnarumma.The electrifying atmosphere in Paris witnessed PSG reaching a final before their supporters for the first time, unlike their 2020 semi-final victory against RB Leipzig during the pandemic's closed-door period.Despite pre-match excitement, PSG's previous Champions League disappointments and Dembele's absence from the starting lineup due to a hamstring issue raised concerns.Arsenal, strengthened by Thomas Partey's return from suspension, initially dominated with Rice heading wide and Donnarumma denying both Martinelli and Odegaard within eight minutes.PSG gradually improved, with Kvaratskhelia striking the post before Ruiz netted his first Champions League goal from Partey's clearance.Donnarumma's outstanding saves continued, notably denying Saka, before a controversial handball penalty against Lewis-Skelly, which Raya saved from Vitinha.Hakimi's subsequent goal, assisted by substitute Dembele, appeared decisive until Saka's response. Arsenal's hopes finally ended when Saka missed an open goal from Calafiori's cross, confirming PSG's triumph.",Paris Saint-Germain beat Arsenal 2-1 in Champions League semi-final second leg.

Rohit Sharma Unplugged: Funniest Press Conference Moments

Chennai Super Kings, long out of the playoff race, played spoilsport at Eden Gardens with a spirited victory over Kolkata Knight Riders in Match 57 of IPL 2025. The win, only their third of the season, has dented KKR’s campaign at a crucial juncture.KKR, who were pushing for a late surge into the top four, remain stuck on 11 points from 12 games. Their Net Run Rate (NRR) has also taken a hit, pushing them further behind Delhi Capitals in the mid-table battle. With just two games left, KKR now not only need to win both but also hope for favourable results from other matches to stay alive in the playoff race.CSK, meanwhile, are still at the bottom of the table. They now have 3 wins from 12 games, While still out of contention, the win was a morale-booster for a side enduring its toughest IPL season in recent memory.Gujarat Titans sit atop with 16 points from 12 matches and a robust NRR of +0.753. Their eighth win puts them within touching distance of a playoff berth.Royal Challengers Bengaluru are second with 16 points as well, having played one game fewer. Their NRR of +0.482 gives them a good cushion. Punjab Kings remain in third with 15 points from 11 games and a healthy NRR of +0.376. They’re hot on the heels of the top two.Quiz: Who's that IPL player? Mumbai Indians are fourth with 14 points and the best NRR in the league at +1.156. They remain well-placed, but cannot afford slip-ups. Delhi Capitals are fifth with 13 points in 11 matches, staying in contention with a NRR of +0.362.KKR are now sixth, still on 11 points from 12 games, with NRR of +0.193 and their path to qualification looks increasingly steep. LSG follow with 10 points and a NRR of -0.469, meaning their playoff push hinges on big wins and other results.Sunrisers Hyderabad (3 wins, NRR -1.192) and Rajasthan Royals (3 wins, NRR -1.173) are officially out.As the league enters its final week, the playoff race remains intense — and today’s result shows that even the bottom teams can still turn the tide on those chasing the top four.","Chennai Super Kings beat Kolkata Knight Riders in Match 57 of IPL 2025.

Kolkata Knight Riders face a must-win clash against Chennai Super Kings at Eden Gardens on Wednesday, with their playoff hopes hanging by a thread.KKR, currently on 11 points, must win all three of their remaining matches to reach 17, with qualification likely coming down to net run rate and other results. They come into the game on the back of a dramatic one-run win over Rajasthan Royals, boosted by Andre Russell’s explosive return to form.Venkatesh Iyer, under pressure due to his hefty price tag, will be keen to contribute significantly, while Russell’s battle against CSK’s spinners, especially Ravindra Jadeja and Ravichandran Ashwin, could prove decisive on a surface offering some grip.CSK, though out of the playoff race, are not expected to make it easy for the hosts. Youngster Ayush Mhatre has been a revelation, stepping in for injured captain Ruturaj Gaikwad. The 17-year-old made an instant impact with a 32-run cameo against Mumbai Indians and followed it up with a stunning 94 off 48 balls versus RCB, despite the team’s narrow loss.With little to lose, CSK are likely to play with freedom, making for a high-stakes and entertaining encounter between two high-profile sides.The Eden Gardens surface presents a fascinating challenge. With dimensions of 66m and 60m square, and 74m straight, it’s a relatively small ground, favouring big hitters. The pitch itself appears dry and dark with patches of dead grass and a few bare areas. Although it lacks live grass, the surface is holding together well and is unlikely to break up or behave inconsistently like the occasional jigsaw-type Eden wicket. There could be some early grip for spinners as it may slow down in the first half, but overall, it looks good for batting.Rahmanullah Gurbaz (w), Sunil Narine, Ajinkya Rahane (c), Angkrish Raghuvanshi, Moeen Ali, Venkatesh Iyer, Rinku Singh, Andre Russell, Ramandeep Singh, Varun Chakaravarthy, Vaibhav AroraImpact Player – Harshit RanaShaik Rasheed, Ayush Mhatre, Sam Curran, Ravindra Jadeja, Dewald Brevis, Deepak Hooda, MS Dhoni (w/c), Noor Ahmad, Khaleel Ahmed, Anshul Kamboj, Matheesha PathiranaImpact Player - Shivam DubeAjinkya Rahane (c), Rinku Singh, Quinton de Kock (wk), Rahmanullah Gurbaz (wk), Angkrish Raghuvanshi, Rovman Powell, Manish Pandey, Luvnith Sisodia, Venkatesh Iyer, Anukul Roy, Moeen Ali, Ramandeep Singh, Andre Russell, Anrich Nortje, Vaibhav Arora, Mayank Markande, Spencer Johnson, Harshit Rana, Sunil Narine, Varun Chakaravarthy and Chetan Sakariya.MS Dhoni (c, wk), Shaik Rasheed, Ayush Mhatre, Deepak Hooda, Sam Curran, Ravindra Jadeja, Dewald Brevis, Shivam Dube, Noor Ahmad, Khaleel Ahmed, Matheesha Pathirana, Anshul Kamboj, R Ashwin, Kamlesh Nagarkoti, Ramakrishna Ghosh, Jamie Overton, Vijay Shankar, Rahul Tripathi, Shreyas Gopal, Devon Conway, Rachin Ravindra, Mukesh Choudhary, Nathan Ellis, C Andre Siddarth, Urvil Patel.Played: 30KKR wins: 11CSK wins: 19Kolkata will experience a partly sunny and very warm Wednesday, with a chance of isolated thunderstorms in the afternoon, but the weather is expected to clear up by evening.

Surya Kumar Yadav edges ahead in the Orange Cap race with 510 runs, maintaining his top spot by scoring a steady 35 in his recent outing against Gujarat Titans. Though Mumbai Indians couldn’t secure the win, Surya’s form has been a standout throughout the season. With an impressive average of 63.75 and a blazing strike rate of 170.56, he continues to anchor the MI batting order.His ability to consistently contribute, even under pressure, has made him one of the most dependable performers this IPL. As the playoff race intensifies, Surya’s form could be crucial for MI’s campaign.Hot on his heels are Sai Sudharsan (509 runs) and Shubman Gill (508 runs), both of whom remain in red-hot form. Gill, in particular, made a big impact in the last match, guiding GT to a DLS win over MI with a composed and match-winning knock, earning him the Player of the Match award. Virat Kohli (505 runs) continues to showcase his vintage form for RCB, while Jos Buttler (500 runs) remains a key force in Gujarat’s top order. Other strong performers like Yashasvi Jaiswal, Prabhsimran Singh, and Nicholas Pooran are also keeping the run charts competitive with impactful contributions.On the bowling front, Prasidh Krishna firmly holds the Purple Cap with 20 wickets in 11 matches. His pace and control have made him Gujarat Titans' most reliable bowler this season. Although he went wicketless in the last game, his tight lines and economy under pressure helped restrict MI to a chaseable score. Close contenders like Josh Hazlewood and Trent Boult (18 wickets each) continue to deliver for their teams, while bowlers like Noor Ahmad, Varun Chakaravarthy, and Arshdeep Singh are making their mark as the tournament heats up.As the race for both the Orange and Purple Caps narrows, every run and wicket becomes crucial. The fight for individual glory is adding even more spice to the playoff race.","summarize: IPL Orange Cap Updated List 2025. IPL Purple Cap updated list 2025. Player Name. Team. Name.

Bombay Sport Exchange Ep 4: Prof. Ratnakar Shetty on BCCI, cricket politics & Indian cricket's growth

Mumbai Indians were supposed to fly to Chandigarh on Wednesday evening and from there to Dharamsala, but that plan has now been cancelled due to logistic hurdles. This is because several airports along the border of Pakistan – Jammu, Srinagar, Leh, Jodhpur, Amritsar, Bhuj, Jamnagar, Chandigarh, and Rajkot – have been closed until 5:30 am IST on May 10th, following India's strikes on Pakistan terrorist camps early Wednesday as part of Operation Sindoor.There is no clarity yet on whether they would be able to fly out of Mumbai. The team was all packed and set to fly, but with the government order on airport shutdowns, they are still camped in Mumbai. However, Mumbai airport runway operations are scheduled to be closed for six hours tomorrow (Thursday, May 8th) for pre-monsoon maintenance, not due to Operation Sindoor.Multiple airlines have already issued advisories and have suspended operations because of the current geopolitical situation. It is now set to impact the travel plans of few Indian Premier League (IPL) teams who are in Dharamsala, and were scheduled to reach this week for their respective matches.While Punjab Kings (PBKS) and Delhi Capitals (DC) are already there for their match on May 8, Mumbai Indians (MI) were scheduled to reach later this week.As of now, unless there is a government directive, the match between DC and PBKS will go as per schedule.With Dharamsala airport, and neighbouring Amritsar and Chandigarh airports shut, the teams and the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) would look to swing a travel plan in action.""We will have to wait and watch for now.

Poll What do you think was the main reason for MI's defeat against GT? Poor weather conditions Sub-par batting performance Dropped catches No-balls bowled by MI

Bombay Sport Exchange Ep 4: Prof. Ratnakar Shetty on BCCI, cricket politics & Indian cricket's growth

NEW DELHI: Mumbai Indians captain Hardik Pandya described the no-balls bowled by him and his teammates as a ""crime"" following their three-wicket defeat via the DLS method against Gujarat Titans in a thrilling contest at the Wankhede Stadium. In the midst of a tight playoffs race, heavy rain momentarily swung momentum in Mumbai’s favour, with the hosts ahead by five runs on the DLS chart after 18 overs.As MI waited in the dressing room, hoping for a rain-shortened win, Gujarat Titans remained ready for any opportunity.Eventually, there was just enough time left on the clock for a one-over shootout to determine the winner. GT needed 15 runs off the final six deliveries, and Mumbai were left with only four fielders outside the inner circle after being penalised for a slow over rate.Deepak Chahar was handed the task of bowling the final over. He conceded a boundary and then a massive six, reducing the equation to five runs from three balls. Succumbing to pressure, he bowled a no-ball that handed the momentum squarely to the Titans.In addition to Deepak’s costly error, Hardik himself overstepped twice during his 11-ball eighth over. The no-ball troubles weren’t MI’s only missteps—earlier, they dropped a crucial catch of Gujarat captain Shubman Gill on the second ball of the 12th over. Gill miscued a shot off Ashwani Kumar, and though Tilak Varma sprinted in to take the catch, he failed to hold on.Reflecting on the defeat, which ended MI’s six-match winning streak, Hardik said, ""Catches did not really cost us, but the no-balls, with my no-balls and even in the last no-ball, in my eyes in T20s, it is a crime and more often than not, it bites you. But I am really happy with the boys for giving their 120 per cent, ensuring we were in the game and not giving up.""Mumbai's bowlers had fought valiantly after the batters put up a sub-par performance. Despite top-order failures, Will Jacks (53), Suryakumar Yadav (35), and Corbin Bosch (27) managed to take MI to 155/8—helped by some fortunate moments.Jasprit Bumrah and Trent Boult then led a spirited bowling effort. Bumrah dismissed Gill and Shahrukh Khan, while Boult trapped Sherfane Rutherford lbw to keep MI in the hunt.Hardik admitted that Mumbai were 20–30 runs short of a competitive total but commended the bowling unit for their resilience.""Yes, definitely (tough way to go down). We fought well with the total we had. Most of the time, we were out of the game, but we pushed as a group. It was a game of margins,"" he said.""It was definitely not a 150-wicket. It was a 175-wicket, we were short in batting by 20-25 or maybe 30 runs if we had batted well. Credit to the bowlers. They kept fighting, and we could not finish the job,"" he added.Rain repeatedly interrupted the match, and although Hardik acknowledged the disruptions were far from ideal, he stressed the need to adapt.""The ground, in the first innings, was not wet, but post that, throughout, the ball kept getting wetter. Not sure if it helped us or not, it was difficult. Rain kept coming in, not ideal to have stoppages and start again. But the game goes on, we had to play a game (in the end), and we definitely did,"" he concluded.","Hardik Pandya describes no-balls bowled by Mumbai Indians as a ""crime"" MI lost by three wickets via the DLS method against Gujarat Titans.

Rohit Sharma’s Final Test Practice: Exclusive Farewell Visuals

Rohit Sharma Unplugged: Funniest Press Conference Moments

Defending champions Kolkata Knight Riders are virtually out of the IPL 2025 playoff race after suffering a heartbreaking two-wicket defeat to Chennai Super Kings at Eden Gardens on Wednesday. In a match full of momentum shifts, CSK held their nerve in a tense chase to seal their third win of the season and dent KKR’s fading hopes of qualification.Chasing 180, CSK were rocked early, losing both openers for ducks. But debutant Urvil Patel brought the chase back to life with a dazzling 31 off just 11 balls, displaying fearlessness against the new ball. However, his dismissal triggered another collapse as CSK stumbled to 60/5.Just when it seemed KKR were on course to defend the total, Dewald Brevis flipped the script with a blistering 52 off 25 balls. The South African took apart Vaibhav Arora for 30 runs in a single over, drastically tilting the momentum in CSK’s favour.Shivam Dube held the innings together with a calm and composed 45 off 40 balls. And with the ever-reliable MS Dhoni at the other end, CSK ensured there would be no panic. Even two wickets in the penultimate over didn’t rattle Dhoni, who delivered a trademark six in the final over. Anshul Kamboj hit the winning runs, taking CSK over the line with just a ball to spare.Earlier, KKR opted to bat first and rode on a solid foundation laid by skipper Ajinkya Rahane , who scored 48 off 33 balls. Sunil Narine contributed with a brisk start, while Andre Russell chipped in with a powerful 38 (21). Manish Pandey provided support through the middle overs with an unbeaten 33.But the innings belonged to CSK’s young Afghan spinner Noor Ahmad, who picked up a stunning 4/31. He triggered a mid-innings collapse by dismissing Narine, Raghuvanshi, Russell, and Rinku, ensuring KKR were restricted to 179/6 — a total that looked competitive but proved just short.KKR, now on 11 points from 12 matches, have just two games left and are heavily reliant on other results and net run rate , to have any chance of sneaking into the top four. For CSK, already out of playoff contention, the win was a morale boost and a reminder that pride still matters.","Kolkata Knight Riders are virtually out of the IPL 2025 playoff race after suffering a heartbreaking two-wicket defeat to Chennai Super Kings at Eden Gardens on Wednesday.

NEW DELHI: With only two days remaining for the official commencement of the SAFF U-19 football championship in Arunachal Pradesh , concerns have arisen about the seamless organisation of the six-nation tournament due to the absence of a ‘ Protected Area Permit ’ (PAP) or ‘Restricted Area Permit’ (RAP) document. This mandatory official paper is required for entry into the north-eastern state by visiting foreigners, including the participating teams.Hosts India are drawn alongside Nepal and Sri Lanka in Group B of the event, while Maldives, Bhutan and Bangladesh form Group A.The championship – the third edition of the regional U-19 men’s tournament – is scheduled to be played at the Golden Jubilee stadium in Arunachal’s Yupia from May 9 to 18. However, it’s been learnt that the organisers of the event are still awaiting the PAP/RAP clearance, so that the visiting teams can enter the state.While sources in the central govt say some state authorities who have been delegated the powers to issue a PAP/RAP can provide the same at their end, the state officials have instead been putting the onus on the Centre – primarily the ministry of home affairs (MHA), ministry of external affairs (MEA) and ministry of youth affairs and sports (MYAS) – to issue the document for the smooth conduct of the tournament.Under the Foreigners (Protected Areas) Order, 1958, issued by MHA, all areas falling between the ‘Inner line’ and the International Border of the state have been declared as Protected Area, which include the whole of Arunachal. All foreigners visiting the state will have to first register themselves with the Foreigners Registration Officer (FRO) of the state within 24 hours of their arrival.After that, the foreigners – in this case the visiting teams – are required to obtain a PAP/RAP from a competent authority to enter or visit a ‘Protected/Restricted Area’ (for playing the SAFF tournament in Arunachal), without which they won’t be allowed to compete.","The SAFF U-19 football championship in Arunachal Pradesh is set to begin on May 9.

NEW DELHI: In a thrilling Champions League encounter on Tuesday, Davide Frattesi secured Inter Milan 's place in the final with a decisive extra-time goal , leading to a remarkable 4-3 victory over Barcelona , with an aggregate score of 7-6.The Italian midfielder Frattesi sealed the intense match at a rain-soaked San Siro in the 99th minute, following an impressive setup by Marcus Thuram, igniting jubilant celebrations amongst the capacity crowd.Inter will face either Arsenal or Paris Saint-Germain in Munich later this month, where they aim to secure their fourth European crown after emerging victorious from this extraordinary contest.Frattesi, who has established himself as a reliable substitute for Inter, replicated his late-scoring prowess from the first leg of their quarter-final victory against Bayern Munich.""It's just incredible, I don't know what to say. I thought after the Bayern game I couldn't ever feel the same emotions, but tonight was even more incredible,"" Frattesi told Sky Sport.""This has been my career, really. I wasn't blessed with incredible talent, but I never give up and always believe and this is the reward for all my effort and dedication.""The victory salvaged Inter's season following their elimination from treble contention after defeating Bayern.Inter lost their Serie A lead to Napoli, who are now favourites for the league title, whilst AC Milan eliminated them from the Italian Cup.However, Inter ended Barcelona's quadruple aspirations and approach the season's conclusion with renewed optimism, having reached their second Champions League final in three seasons.""We know that there are two really strong teams in the other semi.

We wanted to get to the final, we were having a great Champions League campaign,"" Ronald Araujo shared with Movistar.""We were very close and it got away from us.""Frattesi's winning strike, his seventh this season and arguably his most significant, was particularly notable given Inter's near elimination.With two minutes of regular time remaining, Inter faced elimination after Raphinha completed Barcelona's comeback from a two-goal deficit, establishing a 3-2 lead on the night.Francesco Acerbi stunned the stadium, particularly the celebrating Barcelona supporters, by converting Denzel Dumfries' cross in the second minute of additional time.This unexpected goal came when Barcelona had dominated the second half, having earlier trailed to Lautaro Martinez's brilliant finish and Hakan Calhanoglu's penalty just before halftime.Eric Garcia and Dani Olmo equalised for Barcelona in the 54th and 60th minutes, both from excellent Gerard Martin assists, requiring exceptional saves from Yann Sommer to keep Inter competitive.Sommer produced an outstanding save between Barcelona's first two goals, denying Eric Garcia from a rapid counter-attack.The Swiss goalkeeper proved crucial again in the 113th minute with another remarkable save from Lamine Yamal, who struck the post moments before Acerbi's equaliser.Inter successfully resisted Barcelona's pressure as the home supporters anxiously awaited the final whistle of this season's most compelling match.",Inter Milan beat Barcelona 4-3 on aggregate to reach Champions League final.

KOLKATA: The Indian Super League Shield and Cup winners Mohun Bagan Super Giant have been handed a surprise national ban on registration of new players because of a ‘technical glitch’ linked to the transfer of Australian striker Jason Cummings two years ago.The club said on Monday that it’s a minor issue which is expected to be resolved soon. Sources said that a FIFA rule in the international transfer system — called ‘solidarity contribution’ — has led to the ban for Jose Molina’s side.Bagan announced the signing of Cummings on a threeyear contract on June 28 in 2023. However, the FIFA Clearing House has flagged Bagan’s failure in clearing the SC linked to Cummings’ transfer.(SC) is a mechanism Fifa introduced with the international transfer system (ITS) following the Bosman ruling. When a Fifa-registered player makes an international transfer to another club in a different national association or country, a small percentage of the transfer fees (paid by the new club) is used as a form of compensation or solidarity fund and is given to the clubs and academies which have helped train and develop the player between ages 12 and 23 years.",Indian Super League Shield and Cup winners Mohun Bagan Super Giant have been handed a surprise national ban on registration of new players.

Should Jamil take up the job, he will be allowed to coach club and country. “The AIFF has spoken to us as well as Khalid, but nothing has been decided,” Jamshedpur CEO Mukul Choudhari told TOI on Monday. “The decision has been left to Khalid. He has to decide. His stint with us has been outstanding.”According to sources, Jamil is yet to make up his mind. AIFF officials will need to convince India’s best coach of the under-23 national team assignment’s importance.Jamil has received rich praise from all quarters after taking Jamshedpur to the playoffs in the Indian Super League (ISL), with a frugal budget. Players too have improved under his tutelage. If proof was needed that the team’s performance in the ISL – where they lost narrowly against eventual champions Mohun Bagan Super Giant in the semis – was no flash in the pan, Jamshedpur made it to the final of the Super Cup for the first time.“In terms of results, he is the best Indian coach, without any doubt,” said national team and FC Goa coach Manolo Marquez after his side defeated Jamshedpur in the Super Cup final. “People can like or not like his style of football, but the results are there.

The Nissan driver won Round 6 and had said, “Normally you’d be looking forward to the champagne, but you’ve already got one eye on tomorrow.” He did keep the champagne celebrations under control after his win in Monaco and yielded results with his podium finish the next day.Oliver Rowland had won the pole position and was confidently leading in the first half of the race, but as if the pole curse continues to be in place ever since 2022, he couldn’t manage to cross the finish line first. It was Envision Racing’s Sébastien Buemi who ended his more than six-year-long wait for a win by lifting the winner’s trophy on Day 2 of the Monaco E-Prix. Only António Félix da Costa had managed to translate his pole into a victory at the Formula E Monaco race in 2021.Sharing his take on the Monaco race, Rowland said, “I think honestly when he [Buemi] took his Attack Mode, he knew I had more to do — I think he was trying to back me into the pack, so when I took it, I lost quite a lot. But, first and second here doesn’t get much better, so I’m really, really pleased. We just need to keep pushing. We’ve got Tokyo next week where I was really strong last year, so hopefully we can have a real big push for that double-header and then keep pushing in the right direction.”Many believed Rowland was in his own race as he took a three-second lead in the first half. However, he lunged at the chicane on Lap 21, and it was Buemi who surpassed him at the right time. The Nissan driver's move was later judged over-exuberant by the stewards, forcing him to cede the position to Jean-Éric Vergne in recompense, but the damage cost the DS Penske driver a crack at the race win, as Mahindra Racing's Nyck de Vries and Buemi made it by as Vergne bogged down in avoiding action.Rowland once again gave up the lead to Vergne as he took his final mandatory 50kW, four-wheel drive Attack Mode activation, to use that overlap of extra power and traction to push past Vergne and de Vries on Laps 23 and 24 respectively, for second place at the flag, some four seconds back from Buemi.Also Read: Monaco E-Prix Round 6 winner Oliver Rowland delays celebrations for Round 7: “Normally you’d be looking forward to the champagne but…” Up next is the Tokyo double-header on May 17 and 18.

Oliver Rowland on his winning strategy

Oliver Rowland showed who’s the boss on the first day of the Monaco E-Prix . The Nissan driver went on to win the Round 6 on Saturday, registering his third win of the 2024–25 Formula E World Championship . The 32-year-old hinted that they would have been enjoying the champagne after the sweet victory but since this is a double header, the party will have to wait till Sunday. The Round 7 of the Miami E-Prix is scheduled on Sunday.Talking about his quick strategy that resulted in a win for him, Oliver Rowland said, “You never know what to do with the strategy especially with these Pit Boost races - it’s the second race but we kind of had a plan and we stuck to it. It was a bit trickier to pass Taylor [Barnard] to be honest, but we kept calm - even at the end I was pretty worried during that second Attack Mode: I dropped back to fifth and I was behind two Mahindra's, and I was like ‘right now we need to get cracking’, but great job by the team and very well executed.”The 32-year-old added, “I was thinking Taylor was pushing the barriers of the rules at some points, but fair play to him - in the end we got the job done so it doesn’t really matter. We’ve started the season really well, but it feels a bit different now. Normally you’d be looking forward to the champagne but you’ve already got one eye on tomorrow.”A key factor in Rowland's success was the strategic deployment of Pit Boost by Nissan, allowing him to overtake polesitter NEOM McLaren driver Taylor Barnard on Lap 13. Despite briefly losing the lead to Mahindra Racing’s Nyck de Vries on Lap 26, Rowland masterfully utilised his final Attack Mode on Lap 27 to reclaim the lead, ultimately winning the race by a comfortable two-second margin.Also Read: Monaco E-Prix Round 6: Oliver Rowland wins, Nyck de Vries second, Jake Dennis secures third spot on podium despite penalty Rowland is currently on top of the FIA Drivers' World Championship standings with 94 points.

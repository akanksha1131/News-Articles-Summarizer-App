When will CSK legend MS Dhoni retire from IPL? Astrologer Greenstone Lobo predicts

Gully To Glory: Ramandeep Singh's journey from Chandigarh to Team India via KKR

Kolkata Knight Riders batter Rinku Singh revealed the significance behind his tattoos during an episode of 'Knight Bite' on Sunday, particularly highlighting the one that reads ""God's Plan, Beautifully Done"" with a clock showing 2:20 - the moment his life transformed when KKR selected him in 2018.""When I was picked by KKR in 2018 for Rs 80 lakhs, that amount was huge for me and my family. We did not have much money before that. My family's life changed completely. My siblings' marriages became easier, and we even bought a house with that money,"" Singh shared.""That is why I got this tattoo with the family written here. It was exactly 2:21 or 2:20 when I was picked, and everything changed from that moment,"" he added while discussing the tattoo that represents his connection with the Kolkata franchise.Singh's initial three years with KKR saw limited playing time, but he emerged in the 2022 season with 174 runs at an average of 34.80 and a strike rate exceeding 148.His career-defining moment came in the 2023 season when he hit five consecutive sixes against Gujarat Titans' Yash Dayal in the final over, successfully chasing 205 runs in Ahmedabad.The 2023 season proved exceptional for Singh as he accumulated 474 runs in 14 matches, maintaining an average of 59.25 and a strike rate of 149.53, including four half-centuries.His performances led to his India debut, and he has since played two ODIs, scoring 55 runs. In T20 internationals, he has amassed 546 runs in 33 matches at an average of 42.00 and a strike rate above 161.Singh was part of India's T20 World Cup-winning squad as a reserve player last year. He later secured his first IPL title with KKR, contributing 168 runs in 11 innings at a strike rate of 148.67.In the current IPL 2025 season, Rinku has scored 61 runs in four matches at an average of 30.50 and a strike rate over 148, with his highest score being 32 not out.His next match is scheduled against Lucknow Super Giants at Eden Gardens, Kolkata, on Tuesday, with KKR currently positioned fifth in the points table after winning two and losing two matches.","Kolkata Knight Riders batter Rinku Singh reveals significance behind his tattoos.

Poll Which Was The Game-Changer In The DC vs CSK Clash? Early Wickets In The Powerplay KL Rahul’s Anchor Knock

Bombay Sport Exchange Ep. 2: GroupM's Vinit Karnik on IPL's growth and emerging sports

NEW DELHI: KL Rahul played a sublime knock under pressure to steer Delhi Capitals to their third straight victory in the Indian Premier League 2025, defeating Chennai Super Kings by 25 runs at the MA Chidambaram Stadium on Saturday. With this win, DC not only extended their unbeaten streak this season but also scripted their first win at Chepauk in 15 years.The foundation of Delhi’s 183/6 was built on Rahul’s elegant yet powerful 77 off 51 deliveries. Mixing finesse with brute force, the stylish right-hander struck six boundaries and three sixes, anchoring the innings masterfully. Despite a shaky start — losing Jake Fraser-McGurk early to Khaleel Ahmed — Delhi recovered through Abishek Porel’s brisk 33 off 20 and a steady middle-order partnership between Rahul and Sameer Rizvi (20).While Tristan Stubbs added a quickfire 24 not out at the end, Matheesha Pathirana’s tidy final over ensured CSK restricted DC from posting a bigger total.In reply, CSK stumbled early in their chase. Ruturaj Gaikwad, Rachin Ravindra and Devon Conway fell inside the powerplay, with Mitchell Starc, Mukesh Kumar and young spinner Vipraj Nigam (2/27) denting the top order. At 41/3, CSK were always chasing the game.Vijay Shankar fought hard with a well-made 69 not out, and MS Dhoni remained unbeaten on 30, but the asking rate kept climbing. With the pitch offering grip and Delhi’s bowlers maintaining discipline, Chennai managed only 158/5 in their 20 overs.Earlier, DC captain Axar Patel’s cameo (21 off 14) and his six off Jadeja hinted at a flourish, but he too fell after getting set. Rahul, meanwhile, held one end firmly and reached his 38th IPL fifty in style. His knock not only stabilised DC’s innings but also allowed others to play freely around him.With three wins in three games, Delhi Capitals look like early title contenders. For CSK, however, the loss marks a worrying trend, with questions looming over their inconsistent top order and inability to control games at home.",Delhi Capitals beat Chennai Super Kings by 25 runs at the MA Chidambaram Stadium.

IPL: Fleming admits batting woes after CSK's third straight defeat

NEW DELHI: Chennai Super Kings (CSK) head coach Stephen Fleming has responded sharply to criticism directed at his team on Ravichandran Ashwin’s YouTube channel after their defeat to Delhi Capitals (DC) on Saturday.In a post-match press conference, Fleming appeared surprised when asked about the remarks, admitting he didn’t even know Ashwin had a YouTube channel.The controversy arose after a video featuring former RCB analyst Prasanna Agoram, popularly known as Pdogg, aired on Ashwin’s channel.During the episode, Pdogg questioned CSK's decision to play Afghanistan spinner Noor Ahmad over veterans like Ravindra Jadeja and Ashwin himself. The video was later taken down, sparking curiosity and speculation among fans and the media.When asked about the criticism, Fleming responded with calm dismissal: “I have no idea. I didn’t even know he had a channel, so I don’t follow that stuff. That’s irrelevant.”The incident comes at a tough time for CSK, who suffered their third consecutive loss in IPL 2025 after going down to Delhi Capitals (DC) by 25 runs at Chepauk — their first defeat to DC at home in 15 years.With this victory, DC topped the points table, while CSK find themselves under pressure in the mid-table shuffle.Despite a solid start by DC, thanks to KL Rahul’s composed 77 and some finishing firepower from Tristan Stubbs, CSK faltered in the chase.Star players like Devon Conway, Shivam Dube, and Jadeja failed to convert, while MS Dhoni’s late cameo couldn’t turn the tide.As questions swirl around CSK’s team selection and performance, Fleming’s dismissive stance signals the team’s intent to stay focused on the field -- not the noise off it.",Stephen Fleming responds sharply to criticism directed at his team on Ravichandran Ashwin’s YouTube channel.

NEW DELHI: Skipper Shubman Gill led from the front with a composed unbeaten half-century, while Mohammed Siraj delivered a fiery spell to guide Gujarat Titans to a dominant seven-wicket win over Sunrisers Hyderabad in their IPL 2025 clash at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium on Sunday.Chasing a modest target of 153, Gujarat comfortably crossed the finish line with 20 balls to spare, thanks to Gill’s sublime 61 not out off 43 balls and a blistering cameo by Sherfane Rutherford (35* off 16 balls). However, it was Siraj’s stunning figures of 4/17 that laid the foundation for the victory.Put in to bowl first, the Titans restricted Hyderabad to 152/8. Siraj rattled the SRH top order, removing both openers Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma cheaply. Head (8) was caught at mid-wicket by Sai Sudharsan, while Abhishek holed out to mid-on, continuing SRH’s woes at the top.Siraj returned later to claim two more wickets, finishing with match-winning figures. He was ably supported by R Sai Kishore (2/24) and Prasidh Krishna (2/25), who exploited the sluggish pitch expertly. Despite a 50-run stand between Nitish Kumar Reddy (31) and Heinrich Klaasen (27), SRH never really gained momentum. Both batters fell to Sai Kishore in quick succession, as the hosts collapsed from 105/4.In reply, Gujarat were jolted early as Mohammed Shami and Pat Cummins reduced them to 16/2. B Sai Sudharsan (5) was caught off Shami, while Jos Buttler departed for a duck off Cummins.However, Gill and Washington Sundar , promoted to No. 4, steadied the ship with a crucial 90-run third-wicket stand. Sundar played aggressively, hammering 49 off just 29 balls, including two sixes and four boundaries in a single over from Simarjeet Singh, which released the pressure.Gill reached his fifty in 36 balls, anchoring the chase with poise. Sundar fell just one short of a well-deserved half-century, but Rutherford’s explosive finishing ensured GT wrapped up the win without a hiccup.With this victory, Gujarat Titans climbed to second place on the points table, while Sunrisers Hyderabad languish at the bottom, suffering their fourth loss in five games.",Gujarat Titans beat Sunrisers Hyderabad by seven wickets in IPL 2025 clash.

Bombay Sport Exchange Ep. 2: GroupM's Vinit Karnik on IPL's growth and emerging sports

Once hailed as Indian cricket’s ultimate ‘finisher’, MS Dhoni is under increasing pressure in IPL 2025 after failing to make an impact with the bat for the third consecutive match. Chennai Super Kings , the five-time IPL champions, began their season with a narrow win over Mumbai Indians but have since stumbled with three back-to-back losses while chasing — against Royal Challengers Bengaluru, Rajasthan Royals, and Delhi Capitals — leaving them at ninth place on the points table.Although Dhoni continues to be sharp behind the stumps, his strike rate has seen a significant dip — down to 138.18 from a remarkable 220.55 in the previous season. His inability to find boundaries consistently has been a cause of concern, especially in high-pressure chases.Former Pakistan captain and wicketkeeper Rashid Latif didn’t hold back in his assessment, suggesting Dhoni should have stepped away from the game some time ago.“He should have left a long while back, a wicket-keeper's age is usually 35, I am an example of this. If I was on TV then I am a performer and when I don’t do it at a high level then my reputation will come down. Even if you have done it for 15 years, the younger generations will not be impressed,” Latif said.He further questioned CSK ’s decision to persist with Dhoni, saying: “His playing did not benefit his team in 2019 (ODI World Cup) as well, they should have understood then. If you are choosing the team over one player then it is unfair to the game which is why they are getting trolled.“I saw 2-3 games and the crowd gets very loud but CSK need points right now, they are at the bottom of the table and if the reason is only one or two players then you should realise the need of the hour,” Latif told IANS.Amid swirling speculation over Dhoni’s potential retirement, CSK head coach Stephen Fleming declined to weigh in after the team’s loss to Delhi.“No, that's not my role to put an end to it. I have no idea. I'm just enjoying working with him still. He's still going strong. I don't even ask these days. You are the ones who ask,” Fleming said in the post-match press conference.","MS Dhoni is under increasing pressure in IPL 2025 after failing to make an impact with the bat for the third consecutive match.

NEW DELHI: Sunrisers Hyderabad ’s star openers Abhishek Sharma and Travis Head endured another disappointing outing with the bat, falling cheaply against Gujarat Titans in their IPL 2025 clash at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium in Hyderabad.Abhishek, who began aggressively with four crisp boundaries, looked in fine touch, while Head also found the fence twice early on. The duo appeared poised to provide a solid platform for SRH.However, Mohammed Siraj had other plans.The fiery pacer struck early, removing Head in the very first over. Abhishek followed soon after, falling to Siraj in the fifth over, as both openers departed inside the Powerplay.Also See: IPL Live Score, SRH vs GT Their early dismissals didn’t sit well with Sunrisers Hyderabad owner Kavya Maran , who was seen visibly frustrated in the stands, gesturing and murmuring in disappointment.Siraj claimed 4-17 to restrict Sunrisers Hyderabad to 152/8 in 20 overs.Invited to bat first, Travis Head struck two consecutive fours off Siraj before the pacer dismissed him on the final ball of the opening over.Ishan Kishan and Abhishek Sharma struggled to score freely in the powerplay overs as the pair only added 29 runs for the second wicket before the latter was sent back to the pavilion by Siraj in the fifth over.After losing both their openers early, Hyderabad were 45/2 after the end of the powerplay, their second-lowest in nine innings since 2024.Kishan, who had spent a decent time on the crease, couldn't capitalise on the start and was picked by Prasidh Krishna for 17 in the eighth over.Meanwhile, Nitish Kumar Reddy and Heinrich Klaasen gave some respite to Hyderabad's struggling innings as the duo kept on rotating strikes against Rashid Khan and Sai Kishore in the middle overs. The duo amassed a 50-run stand for the fourth wicket before Kishore got the better of both batters in successive overs. Klaasen departed after scoring 27 including a six and two fours while Nitish scored 34-ball 31.Sunrisers Hyderabad's hope for a late flourish in the death overs also hit a blow when Krishna put an end to Kamindu Mendis' (1) five-ball stay at the crease, leaving them for 120/6 after 17 overs.In the next over, Siraj, bowling his final over of the spell, showcased exceptional death bowling skills and clinched the scalps of Aniket Verma (18) and Simarjeet Singh (0) to complete his four-fer.

Navi Mumbai: 2-0 it finished to Real Madrid Legends at the DY Patil Stadium on Sunday, a small feel-good win for the Los Blancos stars of yesteryear, seeing as El Clasico , otherwise, hasn’t been too kind to Real Madrid of late.A delightful chip with the outside of his boot saw former Ballon d’Or winner Luis Figo create the opening goal for Madrid, neatly finished by Fernando Morientes. In the second half, David Barral seized his moment to beat a couple of Barcelona defenders and tap home.But this ‘Legends Faceoff’ wasn’t about the result, even if the thousands of Madrid fans among the crowd might strongly disagree. This was an exhibition game meant to give football fans here a just a small bite of the most storied rivalry in club football across the world.And for most of them, seeing Luis Figo dance past defenders like it were 2001, seeing Xavi looking to thread the ball through to Rivaldo and Patrick Kluivert, seeing Pepe thwart a Barcelona attack, or seeing Carles Puyol, his curly locks flying about in the humid Navi Mumbai air, try to rally his teammates, was a fulfilling experience in itself.Even Mumbai City captain and India international Lallianzuala Chhangte, who watched the game from the press box with a couple of his club teammates, was left in awe. “Xavi is just wow, the way he glances over his shoulder to check where he should be. These are things sadly they don’t teach us here,” the winger remarked.Shortly after the full-time whistle blew, a few ambitious fans weren’t quite ready to accept that the evening was done. One young boy channelled his inner-Figo and tried desperately to skip his way past security and get closer to the players. Halted in his tracks by a guard, it looked like he would be heading home disappointed, until Christian Karembeu, a two-time Champions League winner with Real Madrid, walked up to him and handed the lad his jersey.",Real Madrid Legends beat Barcelona Legends 2-0 at the DY Patil Stadium.

PANAJI: It’s a title race like no other, and this time, the stakes are higher too.The I-League, Indian football ’s second-tier club competition, has seen some thrilling action in the past with teams snatching the title on the concluding day. But this season’s battle has been extraordinary, with four clubs now in contention to win the title and seek qualification to the Indian Super League (ISL).On Sunday, six teams will be involved in three matches to be played across the country. Four of them, Churchill Brothers , Inter Kashi , Real Kashmir and Gokulam Kerala , can win the I-League crown, depending on which way the results go.So, who are the favourites?The I-League table suggests it’s Churchill, who have everything in their own hands. Should they draw in Kashmir, they will finish on top.A win will be even better for the two-time former champions, since the pending appeal for three points from Inter Kashi will then be out of the equation.But there’s a slight hitch. No visiting team has returned home from Srinagar with a win this season. Real Kashmir have won seven of their ten matches at home, with the other three ending in draws. Across all home games, they have conceded just seven goals, making life difficult for their opponents.“We are facing a very, very, very, very difficult team,” said Churchill coach Dimitris Dimitriou. “They are a team with the best record in home games. It makes our job harder and more difficult.”Real Kashmir are nursing title ambitions of their own. It’s quite a task: defeat Churchill by at least three goals and hope Gokulam Kerala do not edge past Dempo. The big prize? A ticket to the ISL next season.","Churchill Brothers, Inter Kashi, Real Kashmir and Gokulam Kerala can win the I-League crown, depending on which way the results go. The big prize?

When will CSK legend MS Dhoni retire from IPL? Astrologer Greenstone Lobo predicts

MUMBAI: One wasn't keeping count, but on quite a few occasions at Saturday's press conference here ahead of the ‘Legends Faceoff', Pepe broke into a wide-eyed smile. It straight-away struck you that that was surely a side of the iconic Portuguese centre back Lionel Messi or Neymar couldn't have encountered on a football pitch whenever Real Madrid and Barcelona battled it out.A player renowned for his defensive tenacity and fiery personality, which often drew him into prickly situations during matches, Pepe is a key figure, not just in Real Madrid history, but one who played in an era where the famed El Clasico rivalry peaked. Think back to 2010 to 2012 when Jose Mourinho's Real Madrid, featuring Pepe, resorted to every tactic, every trick in the book, in an attempt to topple Pep Guardiola's majestic Barcelona.Now, the 42-year-old defender, who ended his playing career less than a year ago, is here, in the city, eager to give Indian football fans a taste of what that rivalry is like. At DY Patil Stadium on Sunday, Pepe will be part of the Real Madrid Legends taking on their Barcelona counterparts in a game set to witness several former stars of the two LaLiga giants. It's not just the rekindling of an old rivalry, but some fond old memories too!""Every single Clasico between Real Madrid and Barcelona that I played has been very special, and I got the opportunity to enjoy some of them,"" Pepe said through a translator on the eve of the exhibition game. ""When Mourinho and Guardiola were there, things kind of heated up from both sides. But keeping aside those fights, I think football always won because people got to focus and enjoy the match in a better atmosphere.""There were fights between clubs, between trainers, between players, between Messi and Cristiano (Ronaldo), but those years were incredible years for Spanish football. I could see them from the inside and they've been awesome games, both for the fans and for the players,"" he added.Having played alongside Ronaldo at Madrid for eight seasons, as well as with the Portugal national team, Pepe also had the opportunity to go up against his compatriot much after both players had left Madrid. It compelled a reporter to ask, whom did he find more challenging to defend against, Messi or Ronaldo? There came the smile! ""If I had to choose, I would say Cristiano because he's someone who has given a lot to football, especially his passion and his effort.""Also I've been training with him for a long time, so I know him and he's been my teammate, so I know what training with him is like. He's a player that has given a lot to Real Madrid, to Manchester United, to Juventus and to the Portuguese national team, so he's worked really hard,"" said Pepe, a three-time Champions League winner.With 2002 World Cup winner Edmilson also in attendance, the former Barcelona star was asked how he would compare El Clasico to the passionate South American derby featuring Brazil and Argentina. ""Today the rivalry between Barca-Madrid is a little bit higher,"" the Brazilian said, offering a critical explanation. ""I think the players play better in Real Madrid or Barcelona than in their national team.""For Javier Saviola, the diminutive former Argentina striker who is part of a distinguished group of players to have experienced El Clasico in both Barcelona and Real Madrid colours, there's no comparison. ""There are some countries with great football traditions such as Brazil and Argentina. However, on the field, there's nothing in the world compared to Barca against Madrid.""","Pepe will be part of the Real Madrid Legends taking on their Barcelona counterparts in a game set to witness several former stars of the two LaLiga giants. The 42-year-old defender, who ended his playing career less than a year ago, is eager to give Indian football fans a taste of what that rivalry is like.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120031450,imgsize-31446,width-400,resizemode-4/Legends.jpg"

He has registered 247 goals and 273 assists for the club in that time.In recent seasons, Muller has started from the bench more regularly, leading to growing speculation he could leave the club.The midfielder did not reveal where he would play next season, although German media has speculated he could make a late-career move to the United States to play in the MLS .Former teammate at Bayern Eric-Maxim Choupo Moting, who plays for the New York Red Bulls in the MLS, told Kicker that Muller was ""welcome here"" in March.""Thomas is a Bayern legend so I would be happy for him if he continues there. If he wants to take the step (to the US), we'll see.""Thomas, you already speak English...

""If a final is already a huge motivation, imagine playing against your most direct rival.""Real Madrid secured their place in the final after a 5-4 aggregate victory over Real Sociedad, following a 4-4 draw at the Santiago Bernabeu on Tuesday.Barcelona manager Hansi Flick reinstated Raphinha to the starting lineup, with the Brazilian winger becoming a target for Atletico's defensive tactics.Cesar Azpilicueta received a yellow card for a challenge on Raphinha, surviving a VAR review for a potential red card, while Rodrigo de Paul was also booked for a hard tackle.Seventeen-year-old Lamine Yamal impressed on the opposite wing, creating chances and providing the assist for Torres's goal with a well-weighted pass.Atletico Madrid introduced Alexander Sorloth at halftime, who had scored in the previous three meetings between the teams this season.Sorloth missed a clear opportunity early in the second half, opting to shoot instead of passing to an unmarked Antoine Griezmann.The Norwegian striker later had a goal disallowed for offside as Atletico increased their pressure on Barcelona's defense.""We played really bravely here, it was not easy, especially in the second half,"" Flick told Barca One.

Nottingham Forest secured a crucial 1-0 victory over Manchester United at the City Ground on Tuesday, strengthening their Champions League hopes, while Arsenal maintained pressure on league leaders Liverpool with a 2-1 win against Fulham, marked by Bukayo Saka's return from injury and goal.Former Manchester United winger Anthony Elanga scored the decisive goal for Forest just five minutes into the match with a remarkable solo effort, running from his own half before beating Andre Onana with a low shot.Third-placed Forest now hold a 10-point advantage over Newcastle in sixth position, with the top five teams likely to qualify for Champions League due to English clubs' strong European performances this season.Forest, two-time European champions, haven't competed in the Champions League since 1980 when they were title holders.Elanga, who left United in 2023, has found success under Nuno Espirito Santo at Forest.""He's a special boy and he gives this team his speed.

NEW DELHI: Jannik Sinner , the three-time Grand Slam champion , received a three-month ban after testing positive twice for the banned substance clostebol .The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) agreed to the ban after Sinner admitted ""partial responsibility"" for team mistakes.Umberto Ferrara , Sinner's former physical trainer, has spoken publicly about the scandal for the first time. He claims to be blameless and places the responsibility squarely on Sinner's former physiotherapist, Giacomo Naldi .""I was perfectly aware that it was banned so I always kept it safely stashed away in my wash bag. I suggested to Naldi to use it for a cut which had not healed and was affecting his work. I was absolutely clear when I spoke to him about the nature of the product and it was imperative it never came into contact with Jannik. In effect I told him to use it only in my bathroom. Naldi did not deny he had been told, but he said he could not recall,"" he told Gazzetta dello Sport.Ferrara states that he had been using a spray containing clostebol, prescribed by a doctor for an illness, and had kept it safely stored away.He suggested that Naldi use the spray for a cut that was not healing, but explicitly warned him to use it only in Ferrara's bathroom and to ensure it never came into contact with Sinner.According to Ferrara, Naldi did not deny being warned about the nature of the product but claimed he could not recall the instructions.Ferrara alleges that Naldi treated Sinner without gloves and without washing his hands after using the spray, despite the warnings.Ferrara acknowledges that, in hindsight, he would not have handled the situation the same way. He expresses regret over the behavior of others and claims to have suffered due to the ""bad faith of some.""Sinner's suspension ends on May 4, allowing him to return in time for the French Open. The clay-court tournament in Hamburg will be his second tournament after his return, followed by the Italian Open in Rome.","Jannik Sinner received a three-month ban after testing positive twice for the banned substance clostebol.

World number one Aryna Sabalenka secured her first Miami Open title by defeating American Jessica Pegula 7-5 6-2 in the WTA 1000 event final at Hard Rock Stadium on Saturday. This victory marks Sabalenka's second title of 2025, following her Brisbane triumph in January, and her eighth WTA 1000 title overall.Sabalenka, who had recently lost the Indian Wells final to Russian teenager Mirra Andreeva, showed determination not to repeat that outcome in Miami.""I'm super happy to have this trophy, I was able to play my best tennis in the final,"" said Sabalenka, acknowledging Pegula's performance and referencing their previous encounter at the US Open final.The first set was marked by service struggles, featuring seven breaks of serve. Pegula challenged Sabalenka by drawing her to the net, but the momentum shifted when Pegula served at 6-5 down.Sabalenka secured the first set with a combination of a delicate forehand drop and a down-the-line winner.Despite losing her first service game in the second set, Sabalenka quickly regained control. She broke twice to establish a 3-1 lead and maintained her dominance to complete the victory in one hour and 27 minutes.""I think I was able to completely forget about (it being) the final, about the outside things and I was just so focused on the game,"" Sabalenka reflected.The Belarusian has won 12 of her last 14 matches against top 10 players, attributing her success to her performance in crucial moments.""It is all about those key moments of the match, about playing aggressive and staying with the game plan, going for shots without being afraid of losing the point,"" she explained.This marked Pegula's third loss to Sabalenka in a final. The American acknowledged Sabalenka's superiority on hard courts.""I consider myself one of the world's best hard-court players, but she's probably the best,"" Pegula stated after the match.""She just keeps ... raising her level in key moments of the match when she needs to, and I feel like that was the big difference today and the last few times I have played her,"" Pegula added.Despite the loss, Pegula expressed satisfaction with her tournament performance: ""Happy to be in another big 1000 final and having consistent results and keep going deep in tournaments. The reason we play is to put ourselves in good chances to win these events. I was able to do that the last couple weeks.""At 26, Sabalenka has accumulated 19 WTA Tour titles, with 17 on hard courts, including three Grand Slam singles titles - the 2023 Australian Open, 2024 Australian Open, and 2024 US Open.Sabalenka's on-court demeanour has evolved from her earlier years, showing more composure during challenging moments.""I think before, every time I would lose my serve, one game, I could just completely lose the match because I would still be thinking about that first game,"" she reflected.Sabalenka credited her past serving challenges for developing a stronger overall game and mental approach.""When I was struggling with my serve I had to push myself on the return and had to play with something else. So now, every time I am losing (serve) I know that I have weapons, that I can return well and that I can break back,"" she said.""I think that challenge really helped me to be more focused and not get too crazy on court after losing a game on my serve,"" she added.The Miami Open men's final is scheduled for Sunday, featuring Novak Djokovic against Czech teenager Jakub Mensik, with Djokovic pursuing his 100th professional title.","Aryna Sabalenka beats Jessica Pegula 7-5 6-2 in the final of the Miami Open.

Football superstar and Argentina's World Cup-winning captain Lionel Messi was in attendance at the Hard Rock Stadium on Friday, where Novak Djokovic advanced to the Miami Open final with a commanding victory over 14th-seeded Grigor DimitrovIn pursuit of his 100th singles title, and seventh in Miami, Djokovic won 6-2, 6-3 and will face upstart Jakub Mensik, who upset Taylor Fritz 7-6 (7-4), 4-6, 7-6 (7-4) in the other semfinial, for the title.During his post-match court interview, Djokovic recognised that Messi, who currently represents Inter Miami in Major League Soccer, was present, referring to him as ""King Leo.""Djokovic revealed that Messi, accompanied by his wife and children, visited the locker room where they exchanged presents. While Djokovic had previously attended Messi's matches, this marked the first occasion where the football star watched him play.""Obviously, it's a thrill to have his whole family,'' Djokovic said. ""It's a huge honour. He's such a great athlete, not just a football player. His impact on the world of sports in the last 20 years has been immense.""To have him watch me live brings me great joy and excitement and also a little pressure. It's definitely different when he brings his family. I was touched by that.""The 37-year-old Djokovic's performance hasn't been up to his lofty standards, beginning with a withdrawal due to injury at the Australian Open in January. At Indian Wells earlier this month, he suffered a first-round defeat against Botic van de Zandschulp.During the third game, play was halted when security personnel escorted a disruptive spectator from the venue. The chair umpire descended from his position and approached the stands while summoning security staff.Dimitrov engaged in a verbal exchange with the spectator and proceeded to direct the umpire's attention to the location of the troublesome fan at the sideline.""It's just heckling, it's fine,'' Dimitrov said. ""I'm a very calm guy overall. I don't pick any fights but don't trigger me.''Despite Dimitrov securing an early break against Djokovic in the opening game, the Serbian regained composure and secured the first set in 32 minutes.The current men's record holder of 24 Grand Slam titles displayed remarkable serving efficiency, landing 87% of first serves with merely six misses throughout the match. He maintained exceptional control, recording only five unforced errors during the 70-minute contest.""Now I know how it feels to be (John) Isner and (Reilly) Opelka,'' Djokovic said of two serving behemoths. ""Maybe my serve has been a bit underrated.""Djokovic extended his dominant head-to-head record against Dimitrov to 13-1. The Bulgarian player showcased his finest performance during the match.""He wears confidence like a stain on your shirt,'' Dimitrov said. ""It's beautiful to see. Only a few athletes on earth possess that quality.''Mensik, who entered the Miami Open as world number 54, has yet to reach a final in an ATP 1,000-point tournament.In a crucial moment against Fritz, he displayed remarkable composure at 4-4 in the final tiebreaker, securing victory by winning three consecutive points.Throughout the match lasting two hours and 25 minutes, Mensik failed to break serve but managed to win with a brilliant backhand winner down the line at 5-4. Fritz subsequently lost the next two points, sending a forehand long after a 20-shot exchange and netting a forehand on match point.Prior to the match, Mensik had a handshake with Messi. ""I didn't wash my hands before I stepped on the court,"" Mensik said.Tennis inspiration came to Mensik through Djokovic, whom he faced in a three-set match at the Shanghai Masters last October. The age difference between them stands at 18 years.","Novak Djokovic beats Grigor Dimitrov 6-2, 6-3 to reach Miami Open final.

She has spent six years immersed in tennis, training alongside top coaches and aspiring tour players.Her disciplined approach stems more from family influence than her academy training.""It's not something I learned in the academy.

I really wanted to have my family see me winning, but I know they'd be happy just to see me compete in this setting.""""And Toni also came in to Miami. That did mean a lot, because I have been working closely with him for so long, alongside my main coaches from the academy, it showed a lot about the confidence and the pride the academy has in me.""Eala recalled a previous photograph with Swiatek at an academy graduation event two years ago.

Miami Gardens: Alexandra Eala , a 19-year-old wildcard from the Philippines, produced a huge upset at the Miami Open on Wednesday, defeating world number two Iga Swiatek 6-2 7-5 to reach the semi-finals.Ranked 140th in the world, Eala, the first woman from her country to reach the last eight of a WTA 1000 tournament, took advantage of a unusually poor display from Swiatek, keeping her focus as she fought back from 4-2 down in the second set.Eala broke the Pole for the eighth and final time when Swiatek was serving to stay in the match at 6-5 down in the second set and looked stunned as she struggled to contain her emotions.""I'm just in disbelief right now.

However, Zheng made adjustments and came out strong in the second set, breaking Sabalenka twice to establish a 4-2 lead.Sabalenka faced significant pressure at 0-40 but, after showing some frustration, rallied to hold serve and tie it at 4-4. She then unleashed a powerful finish, breaking Zheng again to lead 6-5 and serving confidently to clinch the match.""Honestly every match is tough against her, I always have to work really hard to get the win and today was an incredible level from both of us,"" said Sabalenka.""I'm super happy to get this win.

CHENNAI: Sankar Muthusamy recorded the biggest win of his nascent career yet, defeating World No. 2 Anders Antonsen of Denmark 18-21, 21-12, 21-5 in the Swiss Open men’s singles pre-quarterfinals in Basel late on Thursday.What surprised many was the way in which the Indian dominated the deciding game. Despite losing the opener, the 21-year-old did not give up and pushed the match to the decider. He was helped by a flurry of unforced errors that Antonsen committed — the Dane hitting the shuttle wide and long on multiple occasions. Sankar made the most of the opportunity and succeeded.The Chennai lad entered the tournament as a qualifier and registered two wins to enter the main draw.“It feels good, and I have been doing well in this tournament. The first game (against Antonsen) lasted for close to 30 minutes and I feel that he became tired after that. I was able to score points from long rallies and capitalised on the situation. I was focusing on one point at a time and did not think much about the result,” Sankar, ranked 64th, told TOI from Basel.“In the deciding game, I was just expecting him to come back at me and was ready to handle the situation. My aim was to move him around the court and make him tired.”Sankar, who was a former junior World No. 1, lacked consistency in the 2024 season due to various reasons. However, he started the 2025 season on a bright note, reaching the quarterfinals of the Thailand Masters. He was later down with fever and could not give his best in the next few tournaments. However, Sankar recovered well ahead of the Swiss Open.The youngster, who is known for his defensive play, has improved his attacking skills and stroke-making.“My strokes have become sharper than usual, and I am able to finish off points from the rear court. My power is gradually increasing, and I am working on it. There is still a long way to go,” he said.Sankar’s long-time coach Aravindan Samiappan said that the win has come at the right time for his ward.“The moment has not sunk in properly. Sankar was an underdog and had nothing to lose. Our plan was to stay neck-to-neck on points and towards the end anything could have happened. But none would have expected such a scoreline in the decider. It was a bit shocking but that happens sometimes,” Aravindan said.The coach feels that opponents can no longer come prepared for Sankar, as he lends unpredictability into his game now.“Sankar can vary the pace of the match whenever required, and this was not the case one and a half years ago. Players could anticipate what he was going to do, as he played at a single pace. Now, you cannot predict him, and that is the major difference in his gameplay,” pointed out the coach.","Sankar Muthusamy defeated World No. 2 Anders Antonsen of Denmark 18-21, 21-12,. 21-5 in the Swiss Open men’s singles pre-quarterfinals in Basel late on Thursday.

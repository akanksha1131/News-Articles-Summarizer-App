When Cristiano Ronaldo started his YouTube channel ' UR Cristiano ' earlier this year, his kids told him, ""Daddy, MrBeast is better than you."" That gave the football legend the idea to host one of the most famous internet personalities in a video.It happened, and when the video was premiered on November 30, within hours it received more than seven million views.""I know you have a challenge for me, but I also have a challenge for you; it'll be fun,"" Ronaldo is heard telling MrBeast as they both walk onto the pitch of the Al Nassr stadium -- the Saudi club Ronaldo plays for.The video shows Ronaldo presenting a challenge to MrBeast, where both needed to kick the ball and hit a cardboard cut-out of MrBeast placed in the middle of the goalpost from three different distances. Each distance had a different score. The number of cardboard cutouts kept increasing as they shot from further away.""I am horrible at football,"" said Mr. Beast, as Ronaldo tried to teach him how to kick while warming up with a few attempts.""I am getting lessons from Ronaldo. I feel like people will pay a million bucks for this,"" said MrBeast.Ronaldo, who has hit 915 career goals so far, was asked a question that would be on the list of every fan of the football legend.""Are you going to hit 1000 (goals)?"" MrBeast asked.Ronaldo replied: ""I have to play two more years for that.""When the challenge reached a distance of 30 metres from the post, Ronaldo upped it, while MrBeast added a challenge within the challenge.""If in three balls, I don't touch one (placard), you win the game,"" said Ronaldo.MrBeast replied: ""If you hit it in the next three balls, I will turn all my subscribers to you. If you don't, you turn all your subscribers to me.""","Football legend Cristiano Ronaldo hosted YouTube personality MrBeast in a video.

NEW DELHI: England secured a commanding eight-wicket victory in the first Test against New Zealand on Sunday, efficiently reaching their target of 104 runs on day four to lead 1-0 in the three-match series.Whilst Zak Crawley managed only one run and Ben Duckett scored 27, Test debutant Jacob Bethell and veteran Joe Root , in his 150th Test match, guided the visitors to victory before the tea interval.Bethell reached his half-century off 37 balls with a single to deep square leg that sealed the win, accompanied by Root's contribution of 23 runs from 15 balls.Harry Brook, whose crucial first-innings score of 171 proved decisive, remained unused in the grandstand, fully padded up.Earlier, Brydon Carse delivered an impressive performance in his third Test, claiming six wickets for 42 runs as England bowled out New Zealand for 254 before lunch, setting up the victory opportunity.Despite Daryl Mitchell's resilient 84, the hosts could only delay the outcome, with England confident of chasing any target around 100 on the favourable batting conditions at Hagley Oval.New Zealand started the day precariously at 155-6, leading by just four runs. Carse secured his first Test five-wicket haul by dismissing Nathan Smith and Matt Henry in quick succession.Tim Southee, in his farewell series, struck two sixes, bringing his Test total to 95, before Joe Root caught him at deep midwicket off Gus Atkinson's bowling.England experienced a brief concern when captain Ben Stokes pulled up whilst bowling, requiring Atkinson to complete his over.Carse completed his first ten-wicket match haul when Chris Woakes caught Mitchell in the deep, adding to his first-innings figures of 4-64.The series continues with the second Test in Wellington on Friday before concluding in Hamilton.",England beat New Zealand by eight wickets on day four of the first Test.

NEW DELHI: Former India batting legend Sunil Gavaskar is of the opinion that India will make at least two changes for the day-night Adelaide Test against Australia that starts from December 6.After the stupendous victory in the first Test against Australia in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy , India is scheduled to play a two-day warm-up match against Prime Ministers XI at the Manuka Oval in the Australian capital of Canberra from Saturday.The pink ball warm-up match in Canberra is of utmost importance for India as it will be the only practice game they will get to play ahead of the day-night second Test in Adelaide.And it will be also the first game for captain Rohit Sharma on this trip to Australia as he missed the first Test in Perth due to the birth of his son.Talking to 7Cricket, Gavaskar said, ""I think there will be two changes for sure, both Rohit Sharma and Shubman Gill coming back into the 11.""Young Devdutt Padikkal is set to be replaced by returning captain Rohit Sharma in the Indian playing XI for the second Test in Adelaide.Everyone will be intrigued by KL Rahul 's batting position in the pink ball warm-up match in Canberra.Rahul might be positioned at number three instead of Padikkal, depending on whether the injured Gill recovers in time for the game.Gill missed the first Test match and has not yet begun batting in the nets after suffering a hairline fracture during the intra-squad match at the WACA.Gavaskar continues, ""My feeling is that the batting order will change. Where Rohit Sharma will replace Rahul, Shubman Gill will bat at three, Padikkal and Jurel will go out of the team, Rahul will bat at six.""At the Adelaide Oval, spin bowling might be the only tactical change made to the starting lineup.In Perth, Washington Sundar was selected ahead of the two veteran spinners, Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja.Before the 36-all-out occurred in the December 2020 Pink Ball Test in Adelaide, Ashwin handed India the lead in the first innings with statistics of 4 for 45, including a brilliant dismissal of Steven Smith.However, based on their recent performance in the nets, Ashwin, Jadeja, and Washington don't now provide much of a choice. Additionally, batting becomes crucial in Pink Ball Tests because the spinners aren't used as often.Gavaskar concludes, ""And one other change that could happen is that Jadeja comes in place of Washington Sundar.""India's success in overseas Test matches has been mostly attributed to Jadeja's batting, although Washington, a left-hander, has also performed admirably in Test matches. In Perth, he helped India surpass the 500-run mark with an 89-run partnership with Virat Kohli",Sunil Gavaskar believes India will make at least two changes for Adelaide Test.

NEW DELHI: Rishabh Pant shattered records at the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2025 mega auction in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, becoming the highest-paid player in the league's history. The Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) secured the dynamic wicketkeeper-batter for an unprecedented Rs 27 crore.Pant's previous franchise Delhi Capitals attempted to retain their star player by exercising the Right to Match (RTM) card at Rs 20.75 crore. However, LSG’s aggressive bid of Rs 27 crore forced Delhi Capitals to step back, sealing Pant’s move to the Lucknow-based franchise.Pant’s record-breaking contract caps off a remarkable comeback story. After surviving a near-fatal car accident in 2022 and undergoing extensive rehabilitation, he returned to international cricket with a renewed focus for the 2024 season of the IPL.Now, Pant is expected to lead LSG as captain in the upcoming IPL 2025 season, which is scheduled to begin on March 14.While Rs 27 crore headlines Pant’s historic contract, the actual net payout will be a different story due to tax implications.Lucknow have committed Rs 27 crore per season for Pant's services with the team. The Indian government will claim Rs 8.1 crore in tax (30%) from his total contract value. This leaves Pant with a net salary of Rs 18.9 crore per season from his IPL team.Speaking about Rishabh Pant's move to LSG, former India player Robin Uthappa opined, “I think the fact that Shreyas was bid for by Punjab Kings was a planned thing, because even if they didn’t go for him, because they had the luxury of having such a big bank, they could have gotten Pant for a little less. I think there was communication where Rishabh really wanted to move on from everything that was DC in the past and go on to other things in life and I think that is why there was less interest from Ponting and Punjab Kings for Pant and more interest in Shreyas.”Another ex-India player, Mohammad Kaif, said, ""With Rishabh Pant joining LSG, the team has gained both a strong brand value and a recognisable face—an essential factor for any franchise. While LSG do not have many big names apart from Pooran, Pant’s presence will significantly benefit them. The decision to jump from ₹21 crore to ₹27 crore was aggressive, but it’s a move that seems justified. They now have an Indian captain, and securing Rishabh Pant at ₹27 crore is a worthwhile deal for LSG.""Rs 27 crore (per season)Rs 8.1 crore (as per Indian government regulations)Rs 18.9 crore (per season).","Rishabh Pant becomes most expensive IPL player after he goes to LSG for Rs 27 crore.

And the manner in which they have won, so convincingly, one-sided, there has been no problem. India's batting in the second innings after their first innings debacle is just incredible.

IPL Auction: Will it be MS Dhoni's 'last hurrah'?

NEW DELHI: Joe Root , one of England's greatest-ever cricketers, marked a significant milestone by becoming the fourth English player and the 11th in the world to play 150 Test matches. The first Test against New Zealand in Christchurch was expected to be a celebration of Root's illustrious career, but it turned into an anticlimactic occasion as the premier batter was dismissed for a duck in the first innings.The 33-year-old Root, who had entered the match with a staggering 12,754 Test runs at an average of 51.01, was bowled by New Zealand medium-pacer Nathan Smith . Attempting to punch the ball through the covers, Root got an inside edge that brushed his back thigh before deflecting onto the stumps.The dismissal placed Root in an unfortunate club, as he became only the third batter to be out for a duck in their 150th Test. He joined Australian legends Steve Waugh , who suffered the fate against Pakistan in Sharjah in 2002, and Ricky Ponting , who was dismissed for zero against England in Adelaide in 2010.Despite the disappointment in Christchurch, Root’s recent form has been nothing short of spectacular. He has amassed 1,338 runs this year alone at an average of 55.75, including five centuries and four fifties. With 35 Test centuries in his career, Root continues to be a pivotal figure for England, although Friday's duck was the 13th in his 12-year Test career.Root's achievement of reaching 150 Tests underscores his longevity and consistency at the highest level of the game. While the milestone innings may not have gone as planned, it serves as a testament to a career filled with remarkable contributions to England's Test cricket legacy.","Joe Root becomes the fourth English player and the 11th in the world to play 150 Test matches.

His fifth Test half-century came off 100 deliveries and featured three boundaries and a six off part-time spinner Kavem Hodge, as the West Indies turned to spinners in fading light.Bangladesh's early troubles stemmed from Kemar Roach, who struck twice in quick succession to dismiss Mahmudul Hasan Joy and Mominul Haque, leaving the visitors reeling at 10/2. However, Shadman and Shahadat Hossain (12 not out) stitched an unbroken 59-run stand, aided by sloppy fielding.Shadman was dropped by Kraigg Brathwaite at short extra cover off Justin Greaves, marring what was otherwise a celebratory match for the West Indies captain. Playing his 86th consecutive Test, Brathwaite surpassed Sir Garfield Sobers’ record of 85 for the most consecutive matches by a West Indies player.Shahadat also benefited from a fielding error, with Alick Athanaze and Kavem Hodge failing to hold on to an edged drive off Jayden Seales in the slips.Reflecting on the day's play, Roach, who claimed both wickets, said, “It’s just about pegging away, just to keep challenging guys on the front foot. It’s been a pretty even day for us.”Roach’s two scalps brought his tally of Test wickets against Bangladesh to 50, with an overall career haul of 279.The day's play began late due to damp conditions caused by torrential rain over the past three days, despite bright sunshine earlier in the morning.",West Indies close Day 1 of second and final Test at 69/2 after electing to bat.

The warm-up also offered a vital opportunity for Indian pacers like Prasidh Krishna and Akash Deep to bowl with the pink ball under Australian conditions for the first time, adding to the importance of the fixture.Despite the weather disruptions, India’s morale remained high after their commanding 295-run victory in the first Test at Perth.Rohit’s leadership and the team's overall performance in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy put them in a strong position to qualify for the ICC World Test Championship final.","Rohit Sharma was overwhelmed by the support he received in Australia.

The way we came back after getting out for 150 and then getting them for 100 (104 runs) and winning comfortably... that has set the tone,"" he said.

NEW DELHI: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has informed the International Cricket Council (ICC) of its willingness to accept the 'Hybrid' model for the Champions Trophy 2025 . This signifies a shift from its earlier boycott threat. The PCB 's condition is that the same model be applied to ICC events scheduled in India until 2031.The information, initially revealed by a PCB source in Karachi, was later confirmed by PCB chief Mohsin Naqvi in Dubai. The Champions Trophy is slated for February-March next year. India has expressed security concerns about traveling to Pakistan.""I don't want to comment too much because that can ruin things. We have given our point of view (to the ICC), the Indians have also given theirs. The effort is to ensure a win-win for all,"" Naqvi told reporters.Naqvi addressed the media, emphasizing the importance of a mutually beneficial solution. He stressed the need for cricket to take precedence while respecting all parties involved.""Cricket should win, that's most important but with respect for all. We are going to do what's best for cricket. Whichever formula we go for, it would be on equal terms.""""Pakistan's pride is most important.

Goa exploit Blasters' defensive frailties to eke out a 1-0 victory,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/indian-super-league/top-stories/goa-exploit-blasters-defensive-frailties-to-eke-out-a-1-0-victory/articleshow/115789736.cms,"KOCHI: Kerala Blasters once again paid a heavy price for their defensive mistakes as they slumped to a 0-1 defeat against FC Goa in the Indian Super League match at Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium here on Thursday.The decisive moment of the game came in the 40th minute when Boris Singh capitalised on goalkeeper Sachin Suresh 's lack of alertness and agility to score the all-important goal. The defeat was particularly concerning for the home fans as the visitors secured their victory despite limited playing time from their key players-Armando Sadiku, Borja Herrera, and Udanta Singh-who spent less than 20 minutes on the pitch.The victory propelled FC Goa to fifth spot in ISL standings with 15 points from nine games, while Blasters are stuck in ninth place with 11 points.Goa dictated the opening exchanges but waited almost until half-time to break the deadlock. Boris marched forward on the right flank and, as he approached closer to the box, unleashed a shot from a narrow angle. However, Blasters' goalkeeper Sachin not only failed to parry the ball away but saw it deflect off his hand and land in the goal, much to the dismay of his teammates and local fans.While Sachin's mistake led to the goal, the responsibility extends beyond him. The defensive lapses evident from the beginning of the match played a crucial role in Blasters conceding. Boris exploited a substantial gap on the right flank, which emerged when Blasters' left wing-back Naocha Singh advanced forward. Midfielder Freddy Lallawmawma, tasked with covering this space, couldn't track Boris' run and allowed him the chance to unleash a shot from close to the box.In the 57th minute, Blasters' coach Mikael Stahre made a triple substitution, bringing in Korou Singh, Kwame Peprah, and Sandeep Singh to replace Pritam Kotal, Jesus Jimenez, and Rahul KP respectively. These changes proved beneficial and provided Blasters with renewed momentum. The partnership between Peprah and Korou on the right wing proved effective, as the duo generated numerous attacking possibilities in the Goa penalty area. However, a goal eluded the hosts.In the 81st minute, Blasters nearly equalised from Luna's freekick. His excellent strike targeted the top right-hand corner of the goal, but Goa's goalkeeper Hrithik Tiwari made an outstanding save. The closing minutes saw intense pressure from Blasters, but the Goa defence held firm. Their best opportunity came in the final minute of added-on time when Luna's precise header found Sandeep Singh inside Goa's box. However, his execution was poor, and the ball missed the target.",Boris Singh capitalised on goalkeeper Sachin Suresh's lack of alertness and agility to score the all-important goal.

NEW DELHI: Following Real Madrid 's 2-0 loss to Liverpool in the Champions League on Wednesday night, the Spanish club's team bus was involved in a traffic collision on the M40 motorway in England.Social media footage showed the stationary team bus crashed into a lorry (semi-truck). While no players or staff were aboard at the time, the vehicle was transporting the team's equipment and kit.Warwickshire Police issued a statement confirming they responded to reports of a collision involving a car, lorry, and the busof a ""well-known football team"" on the M40 southbound between junctions 16 and 15. No serious injuries occurred as the police noted the players were not on board the bus when the incident happened.“Our officers responded to reports of a collision involving a car, a lorry, and the coach of a well-known football team on the M40 southbound between junction 16 for Hockley Heath and junction 15 for Warwick. Fortunately, nobody was seriously injured. The players from the well-known football team were not on the coach at the time,"" the statement from Warwickshire Police reads.It is standard practice for teams to fly home immediately after European away matches.However, the team bus still needs to be driven back to the club's home city. The M40 would be the conventional route for a vehicle travelling from the northwest of England back towards the south coast of Spain.Real Madrid, the defending Champions League winners, suffered a disappointing 2-0 defeat at Anfield against Liverpool. Alexis Mac Allister and Cody Gakpo scored for Liverpool, while Kylian Mbappe missed a penalty for Real Madrid as his struggles continued.This was not the first time Real's team bus was involved in a crash. In February, after a Champions League match against RB Leipzig, the bus collided with a Toyota car during the journey from the airport due to a re-routing caused by a strike.The newly designed luxury Real Madrid team bus was unveiled in October 2024, featuring hi-tech branding intended to match the club's revamped $1.5 billion Bernabeu stadium renovation.","Real Madrid's team bus was involved in a traffic collision on the M40 motorway in England.

TOI

KOLKATA: Monkey D Luffy, the famous manga and anime character, is an embodiment of strength, flexibility and quest for freedom – the three attributes of Alaaeddine Ajaraie that have taken Indian Super League ( ISL ) by storm en route his record-breaking show so far.So, the NorthEast United star’s chosen Luffy celebration after each of his 14 goals for the Highlanders — some of which were outrageous individual efforts — so far is not borne out of flippancy and the Highlanders fans have loved it each time, making it a trend on their social media handles.“I don’t watch anime too much, but I love this one. I liked the character of Luffy and that’s how I thought of doing this celebration,” Alaaedine said in an exclusive interview with. “I started it only this season because that is how I want people to remember me and when I see our Young Highlanders celebrate like me, it gives me happiness.”The 31-year-old – from a football-loving family with his father once a footballer in native Morocco – began his ISL sojourn with NEUFC after a lacklustre season in the Moroccan top tier, scoring just thrice in 29 appearances for his hometown club FAR Rabat.However, upon discussion with compatriots at NEUFC, Hamza Regragui and Mohammed Ali Bemammer, who told him about “the CEO, the head coach and the entire staff, who make everything possible”. Hence, Alaaeddine joined NEUFC on a one-year contract and was on song from his first game. His goalscoring spree that broke and bettered Brazilian Elano’s record of scoring consecutively in first six ISL games to eight, only took a break after 11 goals, in his ninth game of the league last week.“Frankly, I did not know about this record. After the game, I opened ‘Instagram’ and saw our club’s post. It makes me happy that my name is taken in the same breath as Elano, who has achieved so much in Indian football and football in general,” said ISL’s Player-of-the-Month for October.“I am happy that I have so far managed to help the team with 11 goals. It’s a long season and I am fully focused on my job of helping the team and without their help, I wouldn’t be able to score so many goals.”Head coach Juan Pedro Benali, who has had Alaaeddine on his radar courtesy the experience of working in Morocco, has also given his star attacker the freedom to play in different positions. And he has thrived as a striker, a winger or a No. 10 as his teammates have supported him in all the roles.The Moroccan’s scorching form has been a major factor in NEUFC’s best start to an ISL season and has catapulted them to the third spot on the league table, ahead of Friday’s clash against East Bengal here.“At NEUFC, we are a very good team, (with) nice people working to improve each day. So, if we continue the hard work and trust the process, we believe the results will take care of themselves,” the Moroccan opined. “The first step would be to qualify for the playoffs and then we take it from there. But for us, it’s always about one game at a time.”Having also plied his trade in Qatar, Alaaeddine also spoke of ISL as the perfect fit for his game.“ISL is a competitive league, and I felt that I could thrive here. I had offers from other clubs as well, but I chose NEUFC because of the good things I had heard,” he said. “The level of competition is very high in ISL. When I compare it with Qatar, I feel that the ISL is better for me as a player because of the high volume of quality players that makes it a tough league.”But his most memorable game is still the title-winning Durand Cup final against Mohun Bagan here, in which he had begun the second-half fightback for his team.“The Durand Cup final comes to my mind first. Everybody thought that Mohun Bagan would win the final. But the way we came back was special. It feels nice to win the first-ever trophy in the history of NEUFC,” said the 31-year-old.The Highlanders fans hope for more such adventures for their Luffy and more occasions to celebrate with their hero.","NorthEast United star Alaaeddine Ajaraie has scored 14 goals so far in Indian Super League.

CHENNAI: Chennaiyin FC head coach Owen Coyle has said that scouting players at a young age is critical and that tournaments like the Reliance Foundation Development League ( RFDL ) are much-needed as they provide a platform for youngsters to climb the ladder in Indian football.The RFDL 2024-25 season kicked off in Goa on Monday and features 54 teams, including sides from Indian Super League (ISL) and I-League clubs.It is to be remembered that some youngsters who are currently playing in the ISL – N Sivasakthi, Naorem Roshan Singh (both Bengaluru FC), Vibin Mohanan and Mohammed Aimen (both Kerala Blasters FC) – had competed in the RFDL before rising through the ranks.“With the population of India, I think that we have huge potential in football, especially at the youth level. Initiatives like the RFDL are the need of the hour to provide a much-deserved platform and opportunity for talented players,” said 58-year-old Coyle, who is into his fifth season in Indian football (first being 2019-20).“While the ISL is doing its part for the senior teams, I think that we must catch these talented players at a young age, provide them with the right kind of opportunities and enable them to make their way into the India national team,” added Coyle.A few months ago, Coyle had spoken about the importance of clubs producing and developing home-grown talent. “There is talent in India, there is no doubt about it. There should be more investment at the grassroot level; it is not about getting players when they are 16 or 17 years old. Players will have to be spotted at eight or nine,” Coyle had said.“I need to find a pathway for young players coming through (via the CFC development team). Nothing will please me more than getting young players from Tamil Nadu. That is important… you have them playing for Chennaiyin and TN. It will be great and amazing for everybody. It will also help associate better with the fans,” Coyle added.","Reliance Foundation Development League ( RFDL) kicks off in Goa on Monday.

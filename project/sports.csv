Former India wicketkeeper Farokh Engineer has expressed concerns over Karun Nair's performance in the ongoing Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy, highlighting the batsman's inability to convert promising starts into substantial scores for the Shubman Gill-led Indian team, with pressure mounting for his spot in the playing eleven ahead of the fourth Test in Manchester starting July 23.Nair's current form in the series has been a matter of concern, managing only 131 runs across six innings at an average of 21.83, with his highest score being 40 in the first innings of the third Test at Lord's.The team's failure to chase down a target of 193 at Lord's has put additional scrutiny on the batting lineup, particularly on Nair's position at number three.""Karun Nair has been getting brilliant 20s and 30s. He's (Nair) scored beautiful 30 runs, beautiful cover drives and all that. But a beautiful 30 is not expected from a No. 3. You've got to get a not-so-beautiful 100. You need runs on the board.

India and England are set to face off in the fourth Test of the Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy at Old Trafford in Manchester after a 9-day break following India's loss at Lord's. The upcoming match is crucial for India as they need a win to level the series 2-2, with wicketkeeper-batsman Rishabh Pant approaching Rohit Sharma 's World Test Championship (WTC) run record for India.Pant currently has 2677 runs in WTC history for India, trailing behind Rohit Sharma's record of 2716 runs.

Ravindra Jadeja rounds out the top five with 2212 runs in 64 innings.Pant's availability for the fourth Test was initially uncertain due to a finger injury sustained while keeping wickets during the first innings at Lord's.

Why was the ban imposed in first place?

Poll What is your main concern regarding the return of away fans? Increased violence and incidents Allocation of police resources General public safety

Argentina's football federation has announced plans to gradually lift a 12-year ban on away fans in local leagues, which was originally implemented to curb stadium violence but proved ineffective.The first test of this new policy will occur during the Clausura tournament's second matchday when Lanús hosts Rosario Central.""It's a day that marks a before and after in our league,"" Argentine Football Association president Claudio Tapia said. ""It's the kind of football (with visitors) we all grew accustomed to since we were kids. We have to get back to that path. Clubs that are in a position to host visiting fans can do so.""The ban was initiated in 2013 following two tragic incidents: a Lanús fan's death during a police intervention in a clash with Estudiantes supporters, and the deaths of two Boca Juniors fans in a faction-related shootout.The restriction began in Buenos Aires province before expanding nationwide. However, violence persisted with continued deaths among ""barrabravas"" groups.Under the new protocol, 6,500 Rosario Central supporters will be permitted in the Lanús away section. The plan includes strict security measures and designated tickets for proper fan identification.""The idea isn't to go back to what we had before because the visitors were kicked out for a reason,"" Buenos Aires security minister Javier Alonso said. ""We have to eradicate the culture of violence. It's sad to see 10-year-olds singing about drugs or that someone needs to be killed. It has to be a family celebration, with flags and drums.""The initial implementation will be limited to Buenos Aires province, though other provinces have expressed interest in joining the initiative.The plan has faced opposition from some quarters in Buenos Aires. Critics argue that allocating police resources to protect visiting fans could compromise general public security amid rising crime concerns.The away fan restriction only applied to professional league matches and other divisions in Argentina, while international tournaments like Copa Libertadores and Copa Sudamericana continued to allow visiting supporters.""This is what football fans and society want. Many matches have been organised with two sets of fans, and that's why we decided to announce the start of the return of visiting fans,"" Tapia added.",Argentina's football federation has announced plans to gradually lift a 12-year ban on away fans in local leagues.

After 17 unforgettable years, I'm retiring from professional football with deep gratitude and pride,"" Aditi wrote in a social media post on Thursday.""This game gave me more than just a career; it gave me an identity. From chasing a dream in Delhi to carving out my own path all the way to the UK, where I pursued my Master's in Sports Management and played for West Ham United – I walked a road with no clear map.""I never had to choose between education and passion. I fought hard to do both, and that balance has defined me.""Aditi represented India 57 times and was part of three SAFF Women's Championship winning teams in 2012, 2016, and 2019.""I gave everything to the game — my focus, my fire, my body — all in pursuit of that No. 1 jersey for India. But behind the highlights were the quiet battles: the fear of the unknown, the pressure to justify that my path was valid, and the persistent question from society - 'How would you possibly make a living playing football?'"" She further wrote.""And then, the injuries. Coming back not once, but twice from ACL injuries, I believe I set an example for other players that one could overcome anything with mental courage. The pain, the doubt, the silence - it was a battle I had to win from within.""Her European journey included two seasons with West Ham before she returned to India in 2018.She later joined Gokulam Kerala FC, winning two Indian Women's League titles in 2019-20 and 2021-22.""What I'm most proud of as a professional athlete is the consistency. Across 17 years, I kept coming back, through setbacks, through injuries, through every doubt, and earned the No. 1 spot time and again.""""My parents stood by me, picked me up when I needed, pushed me when I slacked a bit. Everything that I am, the things I've been able to achieve have been possible because of my mom, who's quietly just ridden this crazy ride with me and I can't thank god enough for giving her as my mom.""In her final season, she played for Sribhumi FC, helping the Kolkata team secure third place in the IWL.""As I now step into life beyond the pitch, I carry that belief with me – not as a player anymore, but as someone committed to building a stronger pathway and ecosystem for the next generation.""My second half is about giving back to the game that gave me everything.""The formula remains the same: dream big, believe in yourself, and put in the work.""","Aditi Chauhan, the first Indian woman to play professional football in Europe, has announced her retirement after a 17-year career.

'When the period hits, it's difficult'

Poll What do you think is the most important factor in Garhwal FC's success? Strong team spirit Effective coaching Commitment to training Supportive infrastructure

NEW DELHI: 25 young female footballers sharing seven rooms in a Noida apartment doesn't paint a pretty picture, does it? Along with the staff, they cook their food, train every day, and live like a family.This is the home of Garhwal FC, a women’s team from Delhi that just completed an unbeaten domestic season, winning all 24 of their matches across three tournaments.Even when big sponsors, camps abroad or a share of the spotlight are alien to them, their coach Akshay Unni's five-year plan to lead Garhwal FC to the top division, Indian Women’s League (IWL), has come to fruition a year before schedule, culminating in an inspirational four years from finishing second-last in the Delhi Women's League to now preparing to go toe-toe with the best teams in the country.Despite a ""very bad"" back injury ending his playing days and forcing him to work in a corporate job, Akshay eventually chose to follow his passion.Troubled with the pain of his injury, even after opting for a career far from the football pitch, Akshay says, “If I have to suffer anyway, why not do something I love?”“From day one, it was not just about football. It was about making better people.If we get that right, football becomes easier to teach,” Akshay, who started working with Bhaichung Bhutia Football Schools (BBFS) back in 2017, coaching kids aged 6 to 10 and later training the IIT Delhi football team, adds.From qualifying for the Indian Women’s League to not dropping a single game, the side has scripted history in its own way, almost eight years after Akshay made the switch from advertising to football coaching.It all started in 2021, when Akshay got the opportunity to take charge of the Garhwal FC women’s team, a BBFS-affiliated club. With a minute budget of Rs. 10–15k, he kicked off his journey.“But I was given full freedom,” he recalls. “No one told me what to do. They just said, ‘It’s yours. Build it.’”Though, the results did not follow the anticipation, with the team finishing second-last in the league that year. BBFS had centres across India, and in them, he saw the potential to build a team that stood a fighting chance.Fast forward to another season, and the team finished second in the Delhi League.“The girls had to travel 2–3 hours to reach training,” he remembers. “We didn’t have the best accommodation. But we had belief. And the girls knew — wherever they went, we went with them. That trust kept us going.”In 2023, when Garhwal FC came heartbreakingly close to qualifying for the second division of the Indian Women’s League (IWL), captain Sanfida Nongrum, a 20-year-old midfielder, echoed the same drive and determination, akin to the rest of her teammates.Speaking to TimesofIndia.com, the No. 10 said, ""In 2023, we lost by one point because we took it very casually. We learnt from that. I'm glad that we lost, because we got to learn.""She highlighted the L&D (Learning and Discussion) sessions, a two-hour session every Wednesday, where the CEO, Kishore Taid, comes to have discussions on ownership, honesty, trust, happiness, and anyone can ask anything.The change in mindset wasn’t just restricted to their captain. The other players, too, made changes. They gave up junk food, cut down on sugar and limited their screen time to under two hours per day for four months.With players from across the country, their residence in Noida is a melting pot of cultures. Sanifda, who only learnt Hindi in the last six months or so, now also knows a lot of Bihari, owing to the songs played on loop by her friend and teammate Shruti, who is from Bihar.The 2024 season is where everything clicked for them. Garhwal FC won all 24 matches they played across the Delhi Futsal League, Delhi Women’s League, and IWL 2.To put their dominance and technical superiority into context, it is the respective state champions that participate in the IWL 2, where they played 8, won all 8, scored 28 and conceded just once.Striker Lhingdeikim ended the season as top scorer, bagging an impressive 12 goals in the IWL 2 and as many in the Delhi Women’s League.What’s more? Many of the players who joined as teenagers are now 18, and seven of them are in India’s U-21 team. “What was the first vision? We can actually develop young girls to develop this club and make them reach India level,” the manager explains.When asked about what the toughest part of his team’s inspirational journey was, 'staying consistent' was the immediate answer.“It’s easy to say you’ll quit sugar or train every day. But after two days, you realise it's difficult. That’s the hard part,” he notes.As a coach, his role isn't restricted to the pitch and training sessions either.“Everybody came from different backgrounds, so we had girls from 10 states. They will be motivated for 20 days of the month, but when the period hits, it's going to be difficult. For the first 2-3 days, you will have to let them cut off, and you cannot push them when they aren’t at their best,” the coach adds.“Three or four girls cry in front of me every other day. My job as a coach or my team's job as staff officials was to, without scolding them or being hard on them, how can we make them understand,” added Akshay.Now, Garhwal are preparing for their biggest challenge yet, competing in the Indian Women’s League. It’s a tougher format with home and away matches and considerably stronger teams.After all, in the coach's words, to teach them (his players) to be good human beings is the priority. Playing good football is a by-product.","Garhwal FC, a women's team from Delhi, just completed an unbeaten domestic season. They won all 24 of their matches across three tournaments.

Lamine Yamal, just days after turning 18, was officially unveiled as the new heir to the iconic No 10 at FC Barcelona. The storied history of the Spanish side is only furthered by the legendary stars that have donned the Blaugrana colours over the years. With 18-year-old Lamine Yamal becoming the new No 10 for Hansi Flick's side, as confirmed by posts on the club's social media handles, here's a closer look at the history of the No 10 jersey.Ansu Fati was the last Barcelona player to wear the jersey at the club, after he took over from Lionel Messi back in 2021. However, the player has largely been unable to make a name for himself and after recurring injuries and poor form, has now been loaned out to French side AS Monaco. Fati's failure to emulate previous legends who wore the No 10 only highlights the extreme pressure of expectations that come along with it.Yamal, after taking over the number in an event held at the club shop at Spotify Camp Nou, said, ""Messi made his path and I will make mine."" The 18-year-old recently came under fire in the media for reportedly hiring people with dwarfism as entertainers for his birthday party. However, he responded to the same by saying, ""When I'm away from (the club) I enjoy my life, and that's all.""So, as Lamine Yamal takes the next big step in his way to becoming an indispensable and iconic figure in the history of the club, here are the last five players to have worn Barcelona's iconic number 10:Tipped as Messi’s successor, Fati took the No 10 shirt in 2021. Despite flashes of brilliance, injuries derailed his progress. After several stop-start campaigns with the club, he has now been loaned out to Ligue 1 side AS Monaco. He was previously loaned to Brighton in the Premier League.Arguably the greatest player in the club’s history, Messi wore the No 10 for over a decade and redefined what it meant at Barça. He is the recipient of a record eight Ballon d'Or awards and remains the player to have worn the No 10 for the longest time in the club's history.

Poll Do you think Lamine Yamal can live up to the legacy of Lionel Messi in the number 10 shirt? Yes, he has the talent. No, that's a huge expectation.

Wearing the number 10 for FC Barcelona is one of the most prestigious and demanding responsibilities at the same time. Lamine Yamal has done just that, as he took over the number 10 shirt at Barcelona, previously worn by club legend Lionel Messi. The 18-year-old winger, already a key player for the Catalan side, made the switch official at an event held at the club shop at Spotify Camp Nou.""Messi made his path and I will make mine,"" said Yamal. ""I will work as hard as I can, give everything and try to make those Barca fans who are there happy and those who are at home.""Yamal, a La Masia graduate like Messi, helped Barcelona to a domestic treble last season and signed a contract extension until 2031 in May, becoming one of the club’s highest-paid players.""I hope to enjoy myself more than last year and make my dreams come true,"" he added. Yamal expressed his desire to win both the Champions League with Barcelona and the World Cup with Spain.Having debuted in 2023 at just 15 years old in the number 41 shirt, Yamal has already made over 100 appearances and scored 25 goals for the club. He wore number 27 last season before switching to 19, which was Messi’s shirt number in the Argentine's early years at the club.""Barca is my life, I've been here since I was seven, for all kids from La Masia their dream is to make it to the first team and I'm doing it and I have to keep working,"" said Yamal. ""When I was little I dreamed of being at Barca and having this numbe,."" said the player to reporters, as quoted by AFP.Ansu Fati had previously worn the number 10 shirt after Messi’s 2021 departure, but injuries curtailed his impact, and he recently joined Monaco on loan.""(Messi, Maradona, Ronaldinho) are three legends of football, three legends of this club,"" Yamal said. ""I am grateful for what they gave the club and I will try to continue this legacy.""The youngster also responded to recent scrutiny over his birthday celebration: ""In the end I work for Barca, I play for Barca, but when I'm away from (the club) I enjoy my life, and that's all.""The player has been the center of attention for reportedly hiring people with dwarfism as entertainers for his 18th birthday party. Association for People with Achondroplasia and Other Skeletal Dysplasias (ADEE) has vowed to take legal and social action against the young star.","Lamine Yamal has been handed the number 10 shirt at Barcelona.

Oliver Rowland’s journey in Formula E was full of ups and downs

Oliver Rowland shares his happiness on Formula E championship win

Things weren’t always well-planned for Oliver Rowland, who has just clinched the Formula E World Championship. The 32-year-old Nissan driver took major risks throughout his career, including walking away from a team without another offer in hand. He describes that time as one of the toughest periods of his life. But Rowland eventually bounced back, joining a new team and going on to win the championship this season.Oliver Rowland made his one-race debut in Formula E with Mahindra Racing at the 2015 Punta del Este ePrix, replacing the injured Nick Heidfeld. He quickly disappeared from the scene afterward.Reflecting on that strange start in Formula E’s second season, Rowland told Formula E’s official website, “If you go back to Punta del Este, I remember having no idea about anything when I arrived and leaving thinking, ‘I'm not sure I want to do that again, because it was pretty tough.’”He eventually returned as a full-time Formula E driver with Nissan e.dams in 2018. After delivering notable performances over a few seasons, he switched to Mahindra Racing in 2021. However, midway through the 2023 season, Rowland made another bold move — quitting the team without a confirmed offer elsewhere. Nissan brought him back the following season, leading to two remarkable years that culminated in him winning the Season 11 championship.Speaking about his decision to leave Mahindra Racing in 2023 after two seasons, Rowland said, “I took a huge risk for my career and for my family because my contract is what keeps us all fed and watered, so walking away from that was a really, really tough period in my life. I remember not sleeping for like, two, three weeks at some point. To kind of write the story and come out on the other side with the team that I started in Formula E with is just perfect. ”He added, “As a racing driver, a lot of days are bad, and you have to keep believing in yourself — that you're capable of doing it. Going into this year, I was confident that we would have a good chance.”Now, Oliver Rowland has become the Formula E World Champion in just his second year back with Nissan. “The moment I arrived in the championship and looked at the caliber of drivers here and the previous World Champions, it's such a good achievement for me to become World Champion. To be part of that is incredible,” he said.Also Read: Oliver Rowland’s rise to champion: Rare childhood moments highlighted in touching video Rowland will now race in front of his home crowd in London, where he’ll lift the World Championship trophy.

How Taylor Barnard surpassed Antonio Felix Da Costa in Driver Standings

This is 21-year-old Taylor Barnard’s first full-fledged season as a rookie driver, and the NEOM McLaren racer has achieved what many of his peers couldn’t. At the recently held Berlin E-Prix, Barnard put up a strong performance on the track, managing to surpass Antonio Felix Da Costa and take the third spot in the standings. With two races remaining, Barnard still has a chance to overtake Pascal Wehrlein for the second place.Taylor Barnard outperformed TAG Heuer Porsche’s Antonio Felix Da Costa in Berlin. Da Costa, who had been comfortably sitting in third, has now slipped to fourth in the standings.Taking to Instagram to reflect on his Berlin performance, Barnard wrote, “Reflecting on Berlin. Definitely a weekend of what could have been, but we scored good points across both races, closing the gap to P2 in the standings. An unfortunately timed SC on Sunday cost us the chance of going for the win, but we will maximise our efforts to go into London as strong as possible.Taylor Barnard finished fourth in Round 13 and sixth in Round 14 race at the Berlin E-Prix, collecting a total of 20 points. In comparison, Da Costa finished 10th and 8th in the two races, scoring just 5 points — enabling Barnard to leap ahead of him in the standings.Currently, Oliver Rowland has sealed the Formula E Championship title with 184 points.Pascal Wehrlein holds second place with 125 points, while Barnard trails closely behind with 112. A strong performance in London could be enough for Barnard to overtake Wehrlein and claim second place in the championship.So far this season, Barnard has secured five podium finishes — one each in Sao Paulo, Tokyo, and Shanghai, and two in Jeddah — though he is yet to clinch his first Formula E race win.Barnard will now race on home soil in London alongside his McLaren teammate Sam Bird.

Oliver Rowland was worried after how Round 13 turned out in Berlin

Formula E Berlin Round 14 – 60‑Second Blitz!

Pascal Wehrlein’s Round 14 performance sealed Oliver Rowland’s championship win

Oliver Rowland’s fans kept their fingers crossed and waited with bated breath for the Nissan driver to seal his Formula E World Championship at the Round 13 race in Berlin on Saturday. But the day ended on a sad note for the driver as he failed to even finish the race, while his closest competitor, Pascal Wehrlein, clinched second spot on the podium, closing the gap between them in the Formula E Driver Standings. Rowland has confirmed that he did doubt his championship win when things didn’t play out well that day.There was reason to be worried for Nissan driver Oliver Rowland when TAG Heuer Porsche’s Pascal Wehrlein closed the gap between them in the Driver Standings to 50 points. He was second in the Formula E Driver Standings and could have changed the championship outcome with two more races remaining in the season.Sharing his fears in an interview with Formula E, he said, “I was hoping before the weekend that the outcome could be [the World Championship], but after yesterday (Saturday) and this morning (Sunday) I was more worried that it might never come.”Pascal Wehrlein ended 15th in the Round 14 race on Sunday despite starting from pole position.Rowland eventually bounced back to finally seal his championship win by finishing fourth in the race. He missed out on the podium, which had Jaguar TCS Racing’s Nick Cassidy as the winner, but his 12 points, along with his closest competitor Pascal Wehrlein’s disappointing performance, were enough for him to clinch the championship.“I wasn't aware of where Pascal was at all. My engineer came on, I think with four or five laps to go, and said ‘P4 is good,’ and I thought that's a bit weird. Then I looked at the TV screen, and I got to about eighth, and I thought, ‘Oh, he's not in the top eight then.’ The next time I came around looking again, I found him when I started from the bottom. I didn't know if he'd had a problem, so then I was aware that fourth would be enough if Wehrlein didn't score, so I knew that myself. I didn't want to ask, because I didn't want to jinx anything,” he said.Oliver Rowland took to Instagram on Wednesday to share a post to mark his Formula E Championship win. Sharing a few pictures of his celebrations with his team, the Nissan driver wrote: “2025 FIA FORMULA E WORLD CHAMPION! It still hasn’t quite sunk in what we have achieved this season. I couldn’t have imagined being in this position 2 years ago! Thank you to my incredible team @nismo & everyone that’s supported me!

The race was won by Jaguar TCS Racing’s Nick Cassidy, while DS Penske’s Jean-Eric Vergne finished third.Sharing a picture of the champagne celebrations on the podium at the Tempelhof Airport Circuit, Dennis wrote on Instagram: “P2!!

World champion looks good on you!”Speaking after the race, Dennis reflected on his recent struggles, having finished 17th in consecutive races leading up to Berlin.“We had a really good race car and the strategy we took into the race was perfectly executed. I had every opportunity to win this race, and we got pretty close. I’m not too surprised to be up here — I’m just super happy for myself and for the team. We’ve been on a real bad luck streak recently, so to reward them with a P2 is the least I could do,” he said.Looking ahead to his home race in London, which also serves as the Season 11 Formula E finale, Dennis said, “I’m excited to have this little boost going into the final stretch, my home race in London.

Pascal Wehrlein clinches podium in Berlin Round 13

Pascal Wehrlein fights to secure his position in Formula E Driver Standings

It was a special day for German driver Pascal Wehrlein at his home race, the Berlin E-Prix, on Saturday. Despite facing a three-place grid penalty, the TAG Heuer Porsche driver delivered a stellar performance to reach the podium. Wehrlein, driving car No. 94, finished second in Round 13 at the Tempelhof Airport Circuit and celebrated the moment with his daughter on stage.Pascal Wehrlein secured his fifth podium of the season at the Berlin E-Prix on Saturday, overcoming a grid penalty received for colliding with teammate Antonio Felix Da Costa during FP1 on Friday. He also earned extra points for setting the fastest lap in the race.After the event, Wehrlein shared several photos on Instagram, including a heartwarming one of him holding his daughter. He captioned it: “I promised you a trophy. P2 at our first home race of the season. Grateful to have family and friends here to share the moment. Let’s go again tomorrow.”The achievement was even sweeter as it helped Wehrlein close the gap with championship leader Oliver Rowland to just 50 points. Rowland failed to finish Saturday’s race and retired early. However, on Sunday, fortunes reversed — Wehrlein couldn’t convert his pole position into a podium, while Rowland finished fourth, securing enough points to clinch this year’s Formula E World Championship.Sharing his thoughts after the Round 13 race, Wehrlein said, “It was an important day and a good race, starting from P9. Finishing second is a good result, but we had a small taste of the victory. I think pace-wise, we were the quickest, so I tried really hard and it was close in the end. I think we can be happy with today, good points for the team, good points for the championship. Every race is all-in and we try to maximise every one. ”His second-place finish also gave a crucial boost to TAG Heuer Porsche in the Teams’ and Manufacturers’ Championship.Following Sunday’s race, where Pascal Wehrlein failed to score and Oliver Rowland picked up 12 points, Wehrlein remains second in the Formula E Drivers’ Standings with 125 points. While he can no longer catch Rowland, he will need a strong finish in the remaining rounds to protect his position.

Mitch Evans has 14 wins in Formula E



As Mitch Evans crossed the finish line at the Berlin E-Prix on Saturday, the Jaguar TCS Racing driver joked on the radio with his team that they might have to remind him where the podium was.

There were tricky conditions, and I was managing some issues with the brakes towards the end of the race, which wasn’t easy. I was quite happy with a bit of a gap, but nonetheless, the car was competitive throughout the race and there were some good strategy calls from the team. My guys did so well. There’s always some work to do, but this is a nice reward for everyone back at Jaguar TCS Racing.”Evans had secured pole position in the qualifying session. The Duels were cancelled due to rain, so the grid was determined based on the results of the group stage.Formula E later announced that Evans is now tied for the most wins in the championship’s history. He and Sebastien Buemi both have 14 career victories.Reacting to the post, a fan wrote, “14 and counting! Congratulations Mitch, many more wins to come.” Another wrote, “History created in style.”Also Read: Berlin E-Prix 2025 Results: Mitch Evans clinches second win of season, Pascal Wehrlein closes points gap with Oliver Rowland Despite the win, Evans remains 13th in the Formula E Driver Standings for the season with 50 points.

If

How do you, when beaten to the ground, bruised and busted, get back on your feet? Jannik Sinner knows.The 23-year-old wore his pain plainly in Paris, seated at his court side space, having finished at the wrong end of the five-hour 29-minute epic against Carlos Alcaraz.Five weeks later, on a dazzling Sunday in July, he punctuated a five-match losing streak against his arch nemesis, and brought a rivalry to life on Wimbledon ’s lawns. No tennis player has crossed the channel with greater purpose than Sinner, turning the Paris heartbreak to a memorable hurrah, his fourth Major title, and first in this leafy London suburb.The mental miles the 23-year-old Italian covered in the five weeks must anoint him as the sport’s newest mentalist.On the wall of the players’ entrance to Centre Court are the words from, a Rudyard Kipling poem: “If you can meet with triumph and disaster/ And treat those two impostors just the same.”In terms of expression, Sinner doesn’t give much away, no passionate celebration like Alcaraz on Paris’ red clay, just a smile that sparked his eyes. The turnaround was scripted during a stretch that features a diabolic switch of surfaces, from stubborn red clay to slick grass.It was when the Italian picked himself up, and in washing away the stains of squandering three successive match points, he underlined the size of his fight.There were big questions surrounding Sinner’s morale coming into Wimbledon. “This is the part I’m the proudest of because it has not been easy,” said Sinner, who tried to take positives from his loss in Paris. “It’s much better that you lose a Grand Slam final that way than someone kills you, you make two games.”The Italian’s coaches — Darren Cahill and Simone Vagnozzi — discussed Roland Garros threadbare with Sinner for about 24 hours after the final but didn’t bring it up again thereafter.“For us it was important to move forward as quickly as possible,” Cahill said. “The week leading to Wimbledon was the best practice week we’ve ever had as far as attitude and form. We knew we had something special coming in. We knew that he had already put Roland Garros behind him. He was playing with real purpose. You could see that from the first match that he played, he wasn’t carrying any baggage from Roland Garros.”Following his win on Sunday, the world No. 1 leaves London with a hefty 3,430-point lead over Alcaraz.Sinner’s struggles of the last six months — when he served a three-month doping ban (February to May) for testing positive for anabolic agent clostebol — included the reactions of the locker room, most of who weren’t supportive of the Italian. A large section of the players thought the four-time Major winner had been treated favourably, add to that the vitriol directed at him on social media, and he was wading through murky waters.The 23-year-old, a methodical creature, turned to work, shrugging the weight off his shoulders. “We’ve tried to push at every practice session, I was struggling at times mentally,” Sinner explained. “Maybe even more in practice sessions because I feel when I play the match, I can switch off and just play.”Sinner’s win on Sunday was significant as much for himself as for this young rivalry. While the Italian is obviously too good a player to never beat the Spaniard again, the five successive losses across a near two-year stretch was beginning to gnaw. Sinner said, “When you lose several times against someone, it’s not easy.”Cahill pinned Sinner’s victory to the details. “You saw a bit more energy from him in the big moments, a bit more focus to knuckle down and make sure that when he had his nose in front, he kept on closing the door against Carlos,” the Aussie said.Vagnozzi added, “He was brave today, in the important moments he was really brave.”Alcaraz, the charismatic Spaniard, now leads the rivalry 8-5, but these numbers become irrelevant on the court where the margins are infinitesimal. Also, Sinner and Alcaraz are a level above the rest of the field.“Our level is really high, we don’t watch a level like this when other players are playing against each other,” Alcaraz said. “This rivalry is becoming better and better. We’re building a really great rivalry, we’re playing in the finals of Grand Slams, Masters, the best tournaments in the world. It’s going to get better and better.”That’s the bargain the Italian spent a little over three hours on Sunday signing on.",Jannik Sinner beat Carlos Alcaraz to win Wimbledon men's singles title. Italian had lost five matches in a row against his arch nemesis. The 23-year-old won his fourth Major title and first in London. Sinner is the sport's newest mentalist.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122492867,imgsize-118582,width-400,resizemode-4/122492867.jpg"

Poll Will Sinner's Wimbledon victory change the future of Italian tennis? Yes, it will inspire future generations No, it won't have a significant impact

Jannik Sinner whipped a forehand cross-court that had Carlos Alcaraz scrambling to his right. The energetic Spaniard was on it in a flash. Two shots later, it was Alcaraz's turn to have Sinner on the run - moving to his right on a short, angled ball. The Italian responded with a cracking forehand down the line that looked destined to be a winner. In most cases, against most opponents, that would have been a winner or at least forced an error. Instead, Alcaraz took a couple of steps to his left, flung his backhand with some spin, and it landed in - much to everyone's surprise. The crowd on Centre Court was up on its feet.Still, 44 minutes into the Wimbledon final, Jannik Sinner could be forgiven for thinking about yet another title clash he had let slip. Just four weeks ago, Sinner was two sets up against Alcaraz in the French Open final. The Italian had three championship points, and failed to capitalise. Alcaraz went on to turn the match around to clinch his fifth major title.The script was turning out to be quite similar so far. Sinner led 4-2 in the first set and hadn’t put a foot wrong. Yet, Alcaraz elevated his level to bag four games in a row, including that seemingly unwinnable point, to take the opener.The turning point came a game later. It wasn’t a stellar shot, or a crucial juncture in the contest, or one of the many dramatic points played between these two new rivals in men’s tennis. It was a routine forehand that Alcaraz sent long at 30-40 in the second set. It gave Sinner the service break and the momentum, which he never let go of.Forty-eight minutes after seeing that ball land in, dropping the first set and possibly getting those flashes of Paris, it was Sinner’s turn to hit a remarkable shot to clinch the second set. The 22-year-old Spaniard’s angled backhand pushed Sinner to his left. The 23-year-old went down the line before Alcaraz forced him into covering the vacant court. On the run – seemingly with sliding shoes on – Sinner threw the kitchen sink at it, firing a forehand cross-court winner. “Unbelievable,” chimed the commentator. The crowd, on its feet, felt similarly, with the decibel level rising.The dramatics of that Paris evening on June 8 were not repeated – even if there were hints of it. In the fourth set, having taken the third, Sinner broke early like he had in Paris. But he never gave it back – unlike Paris. There was a whiff of danger as two break-point chances came and went for Alcaraz at 4-3.There were no signs of nerves, either, as Sinner closed out the match to win his first Wimbledon title with a 137mph serve his fastest of the day.“He needed that win today,” Sinner’s coach Darren Cahill said. “So he knew the importance of closing this one out when he had the opportunities. I think you saw a bit more energy from him in the big moments and a bit more focus to knuckle down and make sure that when he had his nose in front, that he kept on closing the door against Carlos.”The emotions at the end showed how much it meant to him. He raised both arms before going down on his haunches in the middle of the court and tapping the grass, as the applause grew bigger and louder. The top-ranked player then made his way to his coaches, his family, and friends including his brother, who didn’t miss it this time for a Formula 1 race!Sinner’s ability to out-hit opponents cannot be doubted. As he became the first Italian to win a singles title at Wimbledon, his mental fortitude stood out as well.“It’s the part I’m most proud of because it hasn’t been easy. I always try to be honest with myself. Things can happen. If you lose a Grand Slam final that way, it’s much better than losing where someone kills you by losing two games,” he said of bouncing back from the disappointment of losing the French Open final. “That’s why I said after Roland Garros that it’s not the time to put me down because another Grand Slam is coming up – and I did great here,” he added.Sinner had the champagne cork between his fingers during the second set as an overzealous fan popped some bubbly at SW19. At the time, all the Italian did was usher it to the ball girl, who got rid of it. “Only here at Wimbledon – but that’s exactly why we love playing here,” he said after the match when asked if he’d ever had that happen before. “It’s a very expensive tournament, you know,” he added to laughs.At the time, getting his hands on some champagne was premature. Now, with the job done, and deservedly so, he got his hands on the champagne, the trophy, and £3,000,000 in prize money.",Jannik Sinner beat Carlos Alcaraz in straight sets to win Wimbledon men's singles title.

Indian-American Ronit Karki may not have cleared the final hurdle in the Wimbledon junior boys event on Sunday, but the 17-year-old has done enough these last two weeks working his way through the qualifying draw and making the title round -to show that he’s a talent to watch out for.Karki went down 2-6, 3-6 to world No.6 Ivan Ivanov, the 16year-old from of Bulgaria, in the boy’s final. Earlier in his run to the final, Karki, ranked 52, took down No.9 Yannik Alexandrescou of Romania, No. 8 Jack Kennedy of the United States, No.14 Alan Wazny of Poland, and No. 12 Alexander Vasilev of Bulgaria. Karki played the J300 at Roehampton two weeks ago, making the third round, when competing for the first time on grass.The New Jersey-born teen, who trains in Florida, was just one out of the main draw, but said he wouldn’t change a thing about playing the qualifiers. “Everything is connected, so maybe playing the qualifying draw was a good thing, and maybe the reason why I’m here right now,” he said.Karki, whose family home is in East Brunswick, New Jersey, took to tennis because his father Trilok started playing the sport when he lived in New York with his wife Kanchan. “My sister (Naomi) started playing tennis too, then I just picked it up because my sister and my dad played it,” Karki said, “My dad is the reason I play tennis.”","Ronit Karki, 17, lost 2-6, 3-6 to world No.6 Ivan Ivanov in the Wimbledon junior boys final.

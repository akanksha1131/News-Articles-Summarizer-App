India Outplayed at Headingley | England Go 1-0 Up in the Series | IND vs ENG 1st Test

Mohammed Kaif, one of the best fielders India had ever produced has pointed out the reasons why Yashasvi Jaiswal is dropping so many catches.Jaiswal had dropped four crucial catches against England in Leeds which cost India dearly and the visitors lost the match by five wickets as England chase down 371 runs on the final day.In the first innings, Ollie Pope attempted to guide a delivery from Jasprit Bumrah through the slip cordon but ended up edging it thickly. Positioned in the cordon, Yashasvi Jaiswal failed to grab the chance as the ball struck his wrists and fell to the ground. Pope capitalised on the reprieve and went on to score 106.Later in the same innings, Jaiswal put down another opportunity—this time offering a lifeline to Harry Brook. Brook, trying to steer Bumrah past the slips, edged it towards Jaiswal at fourth slip, who couldn’t hold on to a straightforward catch.In England’s second innings, Mohammed Siraj bowled a bouncer with a packed leg-side field. Jaiswal sprinted in from the deep, covered good ground, and got both hands to the ball, but failed to complete the catch. Siraj’s frustration was evident, while Duckett—who benefited from the dropped chance—went on to score a match-winning 149.Kaif blamed the strap which Jaiswal has put around his hands playing a key role in youngster spilling so many catches.""Why is Yashasvi Jaiswal dropping catches? We are practicing with Duke’s ball, and when we get hurt, we put a strap,"" Kaif said in a video posted on X.""In such a situation, the fingers are stuck and there is no free movement. You can’t hold onto the catch because the strap becomes a sponge.""The ball bounces off it, so that’s the drawback. The natural connection with the ball shouldn’t be lost.""The second Test between India and England will start from July 2 in Birmingham.","Yashasvi Jaiswal had dropped four crucial catches against England in Leeds.

India Outplayed at Headingley | England Go 1-0 Up in the Series | IND vs ENG 1st Test

Australia and West Indies engaged in a fierce bowling battle on the opening day of their first Test match in Barbados, with the hosts dismissing Australia for 180 before losing four quick wickets to end the day at 57-4 at Kensington Oval on Wednesday.West Indies fast bowlers Jayden Seales and Shamar Joseph dominated the Australian batting lineup, with Seales taking five wickets for 60 runs and Joseph claiming four for 46.The West Indies, seeking their first home Test victory against Australia in 22 years, saw their bowlers maintain consistent pressure throughout the day.Joseph, who had previously recorded a match-winning seven-wicket haul against Australia in Brisbane 17 months ago, continued his impressive form by removing four of the first six Australian wickets.The Australian innings was marked by missed opportunities in the field, with debutant Brandon King dropping three chances at gully. Captain Roston Chase also dropped a crucial catch when Usman Khawaja was on six.Khawaja went on to score 47 runs and formed a crucial 89-run partnership with Travis Head after Australia had slumped to 22-3 in the morning session. Head top-scored with 59 runs, including nine boundaries in his 78-ball innings.Australia's decision to bat first after winning the toss quickly came under scrutiny as Joseph removed Sam Konstas and Cameron Green early in the innings.Seales claimed the wicket of Josh Inglis in the morning session and later dismissed Alex Carey just before tea. He then cleaned up the tail by removing Mitchell Starc, Pat Cummins, and Josh Hazlewood.""This was really special for me,"" Seales said. ""I was injured when last I played a Test against them so to come back here and get five was really satisfying. With the new ball we knew we had to bowl a bit fuller. This pitch was also a bit slower than the Australians would have expected and that worked in our favour with them playing at balls they didn't have to.""The Australian pace attack responded strongly in the final session, with Starc dismissing both openers Kraigg Brathwaite and John Campbell.Cummins removed Keacy Carty while Hazlewood took the wicket of nightwatchman Jomel Warrican, leaving Brandon King and Roston Chase at the crease at stumps.The West Indies batting performance was particularly challenged during the late evening session, with their top order struggling against the Australian pace attack.The match remains evenly poised heading into day two, with both teams having shown their bowling prowess on a pitch that has favored the pacers.The three-match series opener has already displayed the competitive nature of both teams' bowling attacks, setting up an intriguing contest for the remaining days.",West Indies bowl Australia out for 180 on opening day of first Test in Barbados.

Nitish Rana hails Starc: haven’t seen death bowling like this in a long time

Two years after switching to Uttar Pradesh, 31-year-old Nitish Rana is likely to return to the Delhi for the upcoming domestic season.Former Delhi captain Nitish Rana had moved to UP from Delhi in 2023. ""(Nothing comes close to your home),"" Rana's childhood coach Sanjay Bharadwaj told TimesofIndia.com.""Yes, he will be playing for Delhi this season. I had asked him not to move out then also. He didn't had a great season with Uttar Pradesh. As a professional cricketer, you have too much pressure.""It is a wise decision from him that he is returning to Delhi. This is where he has played all his cricket, right from the age-group level. He even got his first India call-up while playing for Delhi. It is a smart move,"" said Bharadwaj, who has shaped the careers of Gautam Gambhir, Amit Mishra, Joginder Sharma, Unmukt Chand, and Priyansh Arya.Rana had a forgettable outing for Uttar Pradesh in the 2024-25 domestic season. In the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy, he managed only 111 runs in nine games. He featured in only two List A matches in the Vijay Hazare Trophy, managing only 17 runs, before he was dropped. He was booted out of the Ranji Trophy team following a string of low scores. Rana scored 150 runs in four games.However, his return doesn't guarantee him a place in the Delhi side, but the southpaw will be part of the second season of the Delhi Premier League (DPL), which will have eight teams this time around.""This is not a dump station. When he asked for the No Objection Certificate (NOC) in 2023, we had requested him to stay and play for Delhi,"" said a source close to the development.""He will have to earn his spot. There is no guarantee that he will get a chance right away.""Rana had an underwhelming IPL 2025 with the Rajasthan Royals , who bought the southpaw for a whopping Rs 4.20 crore in the auction. The southpaw managed only 217 runs in 11 outings for the Royals.It would be interesting to see how Rana will be welcomed back to the Delhi unit, as he was involved in a heated exchange with Delhi captain Ayush Badoni in the quarterfinals of the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy last year.

India Outplayed at Headingley | England Go 1-0 Up in the Series | IND vs ENG 1st Test

India head coach Gautam Gambhir has made it clear he’s not interested in celebrating individual milestones after India’s defeat in the opening Test against England at Headingley.Despite five Indian centuries, including two from vice-captain Rishabh Pant , the team fell short, and Gambhir wasn't ready to sugar-coat the result.When asked about Pant’s twin tons and whether they were a silver lining in the loss, Gambhir, as per PTI, brushed off the question.“There are three more centuries as well. Those are big positives as well. Thank you,” he replied tersely, underlining his focus on the collective rather than the individual.India, despite posting a mammoth 835 runs across both innings, were unable to defend 371 in the final innings. England pulled off a record chase, thanks to Ben Duckett ’s rapid 149 and key contributions from Zak Crawley and Joe Root.The game also made history — never before had a team lost a Test after scoring five centuries.Meanwhile, fast bowler Harshit Rana has been released from the squad ahead of the second Test, as reported earlier by TimesofIndia.com Initially brought in as injury cover, Rana was not seen with the team as they departed Leeds for Birmingham. Gambhir confirmed there was no longer any injury concern, and hence, Rana would return home.“I haven’t spoken to the chairman of selectors yet, but there was a bit of a niggle in the group.That’s why we wanted him as backup. But at the moment, everything looks fine,” Gambhir had earlier said during the press conference.India now have two days to recover before regrouping for the second Test at Edgbaston on July 2.With England leading the five-match series 1-0, the pressure is on the visitors to bounce back; and for Gambhir, results, not reputations, will dictate the narrative.","Gautam Gambhir says he's not interested in celebrating individual milestones after India's defeat in the opening Test against England at Headingley.

It was around 3 AM in Canada when Damandeep Singh's mobile started buzzing. When he finally woke up, there were hundreds of congratulatory texts about his son, Harvansh Singh Pangalia, getting selected for India’s U-19 squad for the upcoming tour of England ""15-16 ghante truck chalaane ke baad neend kahaan khulti hai (After driving a truck for 15-16 hours, you can't wake up that easily from a mobile's vibration),"" Damandeep told TimesofIndia.com over the phone from Brampton.""There are so many congratulatory messages. It feels good. It brings back so many memories of when Harvansh said 'no' to me about moving to Canada. He was rigid, and he's living his dream,"" said Damandeep.India U-19 wicketkeeper-batter Harvansh Singh hails from Gandhidham, a small town in Gujarat's Rann of Kutch. Growing up, he saw his father, Damandeep Singh, and uncle, Kunwarajeet Singh, who played cricket in their town. Interestingly, both of them were wicketkeepers. Now, Harvansh's family is settled in Canada, where his father drives a truck in Brampton.""My elder brother and I were crazy about cricket. We used to play for the sake of a hobby,"" he recollected.""Even Rajkot is 200 km away from our city. It was only in 2012 when the Saurashtra Cricket Association (SCA) opened an academy in our town. I enrolled Harvansh in it when he was six. He picked up 'keeping from me, as I used to don the gloves as well. But he turned southpaw because of Yuvraj Singh . He's a massive Yuvraj fan and hasn't seen peak Yuvraj, but he was obsessed with the video of him hitting six sixes off Stuart Broad,"" said Damandeep.Damandeep never thought a video of Yuvraj Singh's six sixes would make his son so obsessed with the game that he would vow to represent his country.In 2017, Damandeep decided to move to Canada to join his elder brother and sister, but his son Harvansh refused to leave. He wanted to pursue cricket and was hell-bent on making a name for himself in the sport.""My mother, elder brother, and sister all moved to Canada. My plan was the same, but Harvansh wouldn't agree to leave India. He wanted to pursue his dream of playing for India. My wife, Jaspreet Kaur, and I tried hard to convince him, but he was determined,"" said Damandeep.""Papa India hi khelna hai (I want to play for India only). Many relatives tried hard to make him understand that it would be easier for him to play cricket in Canada because the competition is less there. But he kept on arguing, 'easy kuch bhi nahi chahiye aur jab khelna hi hai toh India ke liye khelunga' (I don't want anything easy in my life, and when I play, I will play for India only).'""After a while, Damandeep and Jaspreet gave up.""I told him, 'Fine, you play your cricket. Let's make a decision after U-19. If you don't get picked for India, then just pack your bags and move to Canada,'"" he said.The family got divided. Damandeep is settled in Brampton, putting in hours driving a truck on the road to earn money, while Harvansh stayed back in Gandhidham with his mother. The teenager, however, made a promise to his father that one day he would get them back to India.""I live with my mother, and he lives with his,"" laughed Damandeep.The academy in which Harvansh was first enrolled was Kachchh District Rural Cricket Academy (KDRCA) and later after U-14, he joined Neelkanth cricket academy. His mentor is Nakul Ayachi, whose father Shekhar Ayachi is the president of KDRCA.While Harvansh took a giant step in cricket with the help of SCA, and especially Jaydev Shah (president of the SCA), who has taken a keen interest in Harvansh's career growth, Damandeep, on the other hand, is battling the ongoing recession in Canada.""I used to sit in our office and look at our transport business. Here in Canada, I'm driving a truck. Life is hard here—six days a week on the road, driving 15-16 hours every day. It's not easy. But when I see him taking these giant leaps, I feel the hardship is worth it. He keeps telling me to come back. And like any desi father, I tell him that I'm saving money for his future if cricket doesn't work out,"" said Damandeep.Damandeep is set for another 14-hour drive, while about 13,296 km away in Bengaluru, Harvansh has checked into the National Cricket Academy (NCA) for their one-month camp before the England tour. Damandeep is hopeful that one day there will be no distance, and he will be cheering every run hit, every catch, and every stumping by Harvansh from the stands.","India U-19 wicketkeeper-batter Harvansh Singh hails from Gandhidham, a small town in Gujarat's Rann of Kutch.

India Outplayed at Headingley | England Go 1-0 Up in the Series | IND vs ENG 1st Test

Former Indian cricket selector and wicketkeeper Kiran More has urged for patience with India's Test team following their five-wicket defeat to England in the first Test at Headingley. He specifically highlighted fielding as the main issue in the loss.“We played very well for four days,” More told IANS. “I think the mistake came on the last day when England played outstanding cricket. Fielding was where we slipped. Those were simple catches — no one drops those — and that made the difference.”England successfully chased down a target of 371 runs on the final day to take a 1-0 lead in the Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy, with India six . Ben Duckett scored 149, while Joe Root remained unbeaten on 53 and Jamie Smith scored 44 not out. This victory marked England's second-highest successful chase and their highest against India.""In the first two days, we were really good, and I felt we could've added another 100–150 runs to our total. If we had scored 450 in the first innings, things might've been different. In the second innings, Rishabh and KL Rahul did well. But again, we collapsed at key moments.""India's first innings total of 471 included centuries from Shubman Gill (147), Rishabh Pant (134), and Yashasvi Jaiswal (101). However, they lost seven wickets for just 41 runs. England responded with 465, featuring contributions from Duckett (62), Ollie Pope (106), and Brook (99), with their last five wickets adding 189 runs.In their second innings, India's position looked strong at 333/4, powered by a 195-run partnership between Pant (118) and K.L. Rahul (137). The team then lost six wickets for 31 runs, being dismissed for 364 and setting England a target of 371.""We've got a good, balanced team, but this team is still in transition. I think we need to give them time — a year or so — to settle, find the right combination, and grow into a strong unit. We've scored over 750 runs across both innings, so the batting is there. But we can't keep depending on Bumrah. He needs support — especially from the spinners."" Jasprit Bumrah went wicketless in the second innings despite his efforts. Prasidh Krishna proved expensive, and multiple dropped catches, particularly of Harry Brook, proved costly for India.""We've seen it before — from Gavaskar, Kapil Dev, Sachin, to Kohli and Rohit. Now it's time for new faces to step up. They need time and support. If we keep playing like this and keep making the same mistakes, we won't improve. But give this group time, and we'll have a good team.""The successful chase at Headingley marked the third time a target over 350 has been achieved at this venue. This match also became only the third in Test history where all four innings exceeded 350 runs.",Former Indian cricket selector and wicketkeeper Kiran More has urged for patience with India's Test team following their five-wicket defeat to England in the first Test at Headingley.

India suffered a five-wicket defeat to England in the first Test at Headingley on Tuesday, as England successfully chased down 371 runs on the final day, prompting criticism from former players including Sunil Gavaskar who blamed poor batting, bowling, and fielding performances from the young Indian team under new captain Shubman Gill.The match saw five Indian batters, including captain Gill, score centuries. However, two significant collapses in both innings proved costly, with India falling from 430-3 to 471 all out in the first innings and 333-4 to 364 in the second innings.India's fielding woes were highlighted when Yashasvi Jaiswal dropped Ben Duckett on 97, who went on to score 149 runs to guide England to victory.""Full credit to England. Despite India having five centurions, they seemed to have that confidence. That is what made them take the final wickets. So that is where India also missed out because those extra runs could have made the difference. As far as the fielding was concerned, it's just not the catch but the out-fielding was pretty ordinary. Not Test class,"" said""Very good pitch to bat on so very tough to criticise the bowlers. Bumrah bowled so well. If he had somebody, keeping it a bit tight, that would have been big help. But this is the first Test. Hopefully, lessons have been learned. There are eight days for the next match. ""Jasprit Bumrah, who claimed 5-83 in the first innings, struggled in the second innings and went wicketless. Ravindra Jadeja also disappointed on the fifth-day pitch, taking just 1-104.""I'm going to be critical of Jadeja because this is a final-day pitch. There was rough for him to play with, and in the end, I know there were a couple of chances there, but we have to expect more from Jadeja,"" former India battersaid.The Indian team, playing without retired veterans Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma, saw Duckett dominate Jadeja with a series of reverse sweeps, including a six over deep cover.India's head coach Gautam Gambhir defended the lower-order batting performance: ""I think they were more disappointed than anyone, because they knew we had the opportunity. Hopefully they'll learn, and hopefully we'll get better performances from our tail.""Former India head coachpulled no punches and urged Gautam Gambhir to have a tough chat with the team in the dressing room.Speaking to, Shastri said Gambhir must address the team’s issues and hold individuals accountable, suggesting that he shouldn't be afraid of upsetting some.“I think (there is) a big role of the coaching staff,” Shastri said.""Take the positives out of the contest. As a captain, he (Shubman Gill) has done more than what can be asked of him. He got a hundred; there were five hundreds scored in the game. If anything, you want the basics to be done better. There are things that are out of his control.""Dropping catches is not in his control. That's where the team as a unit can work harder and get better. Similarly, when you come to bat, you've got to put a price tag on your wicket. You can't come out and blow a situation where you can get about 550-600 by just being timid and meek.“These are the areas where you've got to be hard at times as a coach, really hard in that dressing room. There are certain things where you tick off a few guys. But, there were a lot of positives in this Test,” said Shastri.","India suffered a five-wicket defeat to England in the first Test at Headingley.

Poll Do you believe the German soccer federation (DFB) should face harsher penalties for tax evasion? Yes, definitely No, the fine is sufficient

The German soccer federation has been convicted of tax evasion related to its successful 2006 World Cup bid.It brought an end of sorts on Wednesday to a 10-year process prompted by allegations that Germany used a slush fund to buy votes from FIFA executive committee members to be certain of hosting the tournament.A regional court in Frankfurt fined the federation, known by its German acronym DFB, 110,000 euros ($128,000) at the culmination of a nearly 16-month trial at the end of the investigation process. Prosecutors had been pushing for a larger fine after accusing the DFB of failing to pay approximately 2.7 million euros (now $3.1 million) in taxes related to its payment of 6.7 million euros ($7.8 million) to FIFA, world soccer's governing body, in April 2005. 'That payment settled a loan that Germany great Franz Beckenbauer, the head of the World Cup organizing committee, had accepted three years earlier from Robert Louis-Dreyfus, a former Adidas executive and then part-owner of the Infront marketing agency.The money was channeled through a Swiss law firm to a Qatari company belonging to Mohammed Bin Hammam, then a member of FIFA's Executive Committee. The exact purpose of the money was never determined.Theo Zwanziger, who was DFB president at the time, told Spiegel magazine in 2015, ""there was definitely a slush fund in the German World Cup bid."" He accused his successor, Wolfgang Niersbach, of lying about it. Both were on the World Cup organizing committee.The DFB concealed the repayment of the loan as a contribution toward a planned World Cup opening gala, which was later canceled, and falsely declared it a business expense a year later. Zwanziger, Niersbach, and DFB general secretary Horst R. Schmidt were originally charged in the trial. The proceedings against all three, who consistently denied the allegations of tax evasion, were eventually dropped upon payment of fines.""The court is certain without a doubt that the DFB evaded taxes and that those involved put up with it,"" presiding judge Eva-Marie Distler said Wednesday in comments reported by news agency dpa.The DFB was initially fined 130,000 euros ($151,000), but 20,000 euros was waived because of the ""procedural delays"" in the case. Distler was scathing in her criticism of the DFB, saying it presented a ""catastrophic image"" in its investigation of the affair and must bear the costs for the proceedings.""The clock ticks differently at the DFB. It generates astronomical legal fees. The responsible people externalize responsibility. No one has to face personal consequences,"" Distler said. ""No DFB representative participated in either the investigation or the trial. You have to ask, are they not taking the justice system seriously?""The DFB has one week to appeal the ruling.","The German soccer federation has been convicted of tax evasion related to its successful 2006 World Cup bid.

In one of the most astonishing results at the 2025 Club World Cup, and in football altogether, Auckland City, a side ranked 4,971st in the world by Opta, held South American side Boca Juniors, ranked 152 on the planet, to a 1-1 draw on Tuesday.Auckland, the lowest-ranked team in the tournament and already eliminated after two heavy defeats - a 6-0 thumping by Benfica and a 10-0 demolition by German giants Bayern Munich, produced a defiant display to deny Argentina's six-time Copa Libertadores winners a spot in the knockout stages. Boca needed a win to stand a chance of progressing.Despite being out-shot 40 to 4 and conceding nearly 70% possession, Auckland’s grit and determination paid off.To put the scale of the upset into perspective, this was the equivalent of Scottish third-tier side Cove Rangers (ranked 4,844th) drawing with Juventus (ranked 25th), as per Opta.Boca went ahead in the 26th minute after Lautaro Di Lollo’s header hit the post and ricocheted in off Auckland goalkeeper Nathan Garrow for an unfortunate own goal. But Garrow recovered impressively, pulling off a series of second-half saves to preserve the scoreline.Auckland struck back in the 52nd minute when Christian Gray powered in a header from Jerson Lagos’ corner, which was incidentally the team’s first goal of the tournament.“It’s been a tough trip, we’ve had some tough results but I’m just happy for the team and the boys, I think we deserve it, we got a little bit of respect back I hope,” said goal scorer Gray to",Auckland City beat Boca Juniors 1-0 in their Group C clash. The result is the first time a South American side has beaten an Argentine side in the Copa Libertadores. Boca had already been thrashed 6-0 by Bayern Munich in their opening game.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122069424,imgsize-132756,width-400,resizemode-4/122069424.jpg"

Indian football is in freefall. Once seen as a nation on the rise, India now find itself sliding down the global and continental ranks with alarming speed.A 0-1 defeat to Hong Kong in a must-win AFC Asian Cup 2027 qualifier has brought things to a breaking point. Ranked 133rd in the latest FIFA rankings — just two spots above their worst position in a decade — the Indian men’s team has now won just one of their last 16 games across competitions.The loss to Hong Kong stung more because of how it unfolded. After a relatively encouraging first half, India conceded in the 94th minute when goalkeeper Vishal Kaith fouled Michael Udebuluzor in the box.Hong Kong’s Stefan Pereira slotted the penalty with ease. Another game lost. Another opportunity wasted.Missed chances defined India’s night — Ashique Kuruniyan missed a sitter, and even the returning Sunil Chhetri couldn’t convert from close range. The team has managed just five goals in two years, underlining the deepening crisis in attack.Chhetri’s comeback from retirement offered a glimmer of hope, but at 40, even his leadership and presence can’t mask the lack of quality and cutting edge in the squad.On that, scoring just five goals in two years highlights how significantly the Indian forwards have declined over time.In the broader Asian picture, India now rank 24th out of 46 AFC nations — behind countries like Vietnam, Kyrgyzstan, and Lebanon. Compare this to 2018, when India were ranked 96 in the world and competing closely with teams like Jordan.That same Jordan team is now in the 2026 World Cup and recently reached the AFC Asian Cup final. India, meanwhile, are still struggling to score.The situation off the field offers little reassurance. The national setup remains unclear, with coaching duties currently being split — officially or otherwise — between club and country.India's golden moment in football feels like a distant memory. Without a clear strategy, youth development pipeline, or consistent results, the path to recovery appears long and uncertain.The dream of qualifying for major tournaments like the AFC Asian Cup and even the World Cup now seems more distant than ever.","India lost 0-1 to Hong Kong in a must-win AFC Asian Cup 2027 qualifier.

Gautam Gambhir Explosive Press Conference: On Drop Catches, Batting Collapse, Shubman Gill Captaincy

At this time of the year, the city’s famed Maidan comes alive with its rain, rainbow and football’s pre-season rituals.The Calcutta Football League — Asia’s oldest football league — is set to commence on Wednesday and the city’s representatives in the Indian Super League , Mohun Bagan SG, East Bengal FC and Mohammedan SC, have already hit the ground running with their reserve teams, while others in the fray are aspiring to give the Big Three a run for their money in this traditional curtain-raiser.In the past, the CFL has served as a breeding ground for young talents to stake claims to the big league across the country. Like previous years, Bengal’s Santosh Trophy-winning coach Sanjoy Sen will be watching the players with his notebook. Scouts for big teams will also be on the alert, hoping to catch some of them young and unleash them in a bigger and better stage.There’s a catch, though. The sight of the big league seems as clear as mud. “We are also supposed to get going with our pre-season by this time, no?” asked an India player, “Is it happening?”Is the ISL happening? That’s the question hanging over Indian football as a pregnant pause this season. And the scenes in Kolkata could serve as a microcosm of the confusion and doubts plaguing Indian football stakeholders across the country.Despite there being no clarity over a fresh Master Rights Agreement (MRA) between the AIFF and Football Sports Development Limited (FSDL) which runs the ISL, the federation has obtained permission from the sports ministry to conduct the league from “second week of Sept 2025 to last week of April 2026.”Equally crucially, the subject pertaining to restructuring of the AIFF’s internal governance through a revised constitution is waiting for a Supreme Court go-ahead.Quiz: Who's that IPL player? Given this uncertainty, the clubs have not taken any decision about when the senior team players and coaches will arrive. Mohun Bagan and East Bengal are yet to sign the agreement to take part in Durand Cup (July 22 onwards) while Mohammedan SC are keeping the option open of participating in it with their CFL side.Several players — former and current — that TOI caught up with expressed concerns about this unprecedented state of play, the financial implications foremost on most minds. “If there’s no ISL, it will no doubt impact the players financially. If players can’t take care of themselves and their families, it is bound to affect their performance,” said former India player Alvito D’Cunha. “I only hope all stakeholders come together and get this problem resolved amicably,” he added.Bengal coach Sen too agreed that a swift end to this impasse was imperative. “Nowadays, most clubs enter into long-term deals with players. But for those youngsters, who aspire to be in the big league, it can be a difficult time,” pointed out Sen. Sen would know, having guided Mohun Bagan to an I-League trophy and once serving as an assistant coach with now-defunct ATK in the ISL.The FSDL is understood to have verbally informed the ISL club owners that the next edition of the league will not start until there is clarity on the MRA. However, players believe that the league will continue.“What is happening is unfortunate. After all, future of so many players, that too in the country’s premier league, is at stake,” said a former India player, associated with an ISL team but wishing to remain anonymous, “Like others I also expect this uncertainty to be over soon.”Mohammedan SC could be a case study in what all can go wrong with a football club.

.”

It turned out to be a historic outing for the Indian women’s national football team as they registered their biggest win ever in an official AFC match, hammering Mongolia 13-0 on Monday, June 23. The emphatic victory in Tashkent is now the Blue Tigresses’ fourth-largest winning margin in their history.Just six months ago, India had beaten the Maldives 14-0 in a friendly in Bengaluru, while their biggest-ever win remains the 18-0 demolition of Bhutan during the 2010 SAFF Championship in Cox’s Bazar.Monday’s win was not only a massive boost to their goal difference but also an early statement of intent in their bid to top the qualifying group and secure a spot for the AFC Women’s Asian Cup in Australia next year.Head coach Crispin Chettri, however, insisted his side can still be sharper in front of goal.Sometimes, you don’t have to look at shorelines. You need to move on. We just need to do our job, and that is to score goals. I know scoring is not always easy, no matter who the opponents are. At the same time, we must be more clinical and more professional and finish whatever chances come our way. We can be much better, I knowChettri said after the game.Despite a slightly sluggish start, India led 4-0 at half-time. On a slippery pitch, the floodgates opened in the second half. Pyari Xaxa was unstoppable, netting five of the first six goals, with Grace Dangmei setting up three of those and scoring the 12th herself from the penalty spot.Soumya Guguloth dazzled with her dribbles and a stunning left-footed volley, while Rimpa Haldar kept the Mongolian defence busy throughout. Second-half substitutes Malavika and Priyadharshini Selladurai capped off the scoring with their maiden goals for India.Looking ahead, Chettri said, “Our movement on the flanks was much better in the second half. We want more composure in midfield. We want more people to take shots from outside the box. We want more variation in attackIndia next face Timor-Leste on June 28, with eyes firmly set on building momentum before the decisive clash against hosts Thailand on July 5.","India beat Mongolia 13-0 in Tashkent on Monday, June 23.

Poll Do you think North Korea's censorship of sports broadcasts is justified? Yes, it's their media No, it's unfair to athletes

Pyongyang’s Korean Central Television (KCTV) has once again demonstrated its strict media censorship by blurring South Korean footballer Lee Kang-in’s moment of glory during a delayed broadcast of the 2025 FIFA Club World Cup.The North Korean state broadcaster aired the match between Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) and Atlético Madrid five days after it was played at the Rose Bowl Stadium in Los Angeles last Sunday. With PSG leading 3–0 deep into stoppage time, Atlético conceded a handball, handing Lee a penalty in the 97th minute, which he converted for his first goal in the tournament. But North Korean viewers could only see an 'altered' version of the same. KCTV pixelated Lee’s face and number during the penalty and merely stated that PSG defeated Atlético Madrid, avoiding any mention of the South Korean midfielder’s name.This selective editing aligns with Pyongyang’s long-running practice of erasing South Korean sporting achievements from broadcasts. KCTV typically airs sports matches an hour or two before its evening news at 5 p.m., frequently showing Premier League and Champions League games involving top European clubs.But matches featuring South Korean stars like Tottenham’s Son Heung-min, Wolverhampton’s Hwang Hee-chan, or Lee Kang-in himself are either heavily censored or omitted altogether.The regime’s ruling Workers' Party dictates all televised content, and football is no exception. The authorities have consistently refused to show South Korean flags and have gone so far as to refer to the national team as a “puppet South Korean team.” KCTV even pixelated the flag during broadcasts of the 2022 FIFA World Cup and the AFC U-17 Women’s Asian Cup last year.Six months into the 2024/25 Premier League season, KCTV began airing matches in January — but with what US-based website 38 North described as “heavy-handed intervention” from Pyongyang’s censors. This means any clubs with prominent South Korean players are practically off-limits for broadcast, a source of frustration for North Korean football fans who might secretly admire players like Son or Hwang.",South Korean footballer Lee Kang-in's moment of glory was blurred out during broadcast of 2025 FIFA Club World Cup.

Nyck De Vries pens a post after Jakarta race



Nyck De Vries of Mahindra Racing has finally spoken up after his controversial race at the Jakarta E-Prix, where he received a ten-second time penalty for hitting Andretti’s Jake Dennis just moments before the race ended. Both were aiming for the podium, but the collision ended their chances of gaining any points or a podium finish. In his latest post on Instagram, De Vries summed up the race day and also mentioned his teammate Edoardo Mortara for his much-awaited podium.Nyck De Vries shared a heartbreaking picture of himself sitting dejectedly with his back to the chicane. He wrote along with it, “Unfortunate end to a good day. P3 in qualifying, leading the race, 6 seconds gap, 7 laps to go, forced to retire the car. Overall a positive weekend, a great podium by @edomortara and good performance all round. Proud of our team. Terima kasih (thank you) Jakarta.”His fans, however, refused to leave his side and showed their support in the comments section. One fan wrote, “Terimakasih for trying your best Nyck. Rooting for you for the remainder of the season! We can’t change the past but we can come back stronger! See you in Berlin.” Another said, “You did great, Nyck! Keep your chin up.”One more fan commented, “Man..... I was rooting for you. Come back stronger next year.” A comment also read, “Nyck, you did super amazing and you will win 100% very soon. We wish you the best.”Nyck De Vries was among the top four and could have even grabbed a podium had he not made contact with Jake Dennis. Recently, Dennis told a reporter that he could have won the race had the incident not happened.Meanwhile, his teammate Edoardo Mortara secured second place on the podium at the Jakarta E-Prix.

Dan Ticktum bares his feelings after maiden Formula E win



Dan Ticktum’s fans hail him for his unfiltered note



Dan Ticktum shared several memorable pictures from race day and the victory celebration after winning his maiden Formula E race in Jakarta. He penned a long note on his breakthrough win and, true to his unapologetic self, the Cupra Kiro driver didn’t mince words while opening his heart to fans on Instagram, along with a bunch of pictures. He reflected on the time when he was taking baby steps in Formula 1 but had to quit the field amid controversies.Dan Ticktum’s note comes just days after his first-ever Formula E win, following his victory at the Jakarta E-Prix and the traditional champagne bath on the podium. Starting from the very beginning, he wrote, “So there it is, first win in @fiaformulae in the books. I am immensely proud of what this great team of people have achieved this year. As some of you know, I was very close to being in F1 several years ago, but due to some political s****, it wasn’t meant to be. (For those too ignorant — no, it wasn’t down to my attitude). I was ready to give up racing, as at the time, my dream — to me at least — was over.”Moving to his switch to Formula E, he added, “However, an opportunity arose to take part in this exciting, relatively new championship, full of the best drivers in the world.@alexhuigusto and @russellohagan were instrumental in giving me this opportunity, and they, along with the rest of the team, have stuck by me during three very tough years being the least funded team on the grid. This year, with our new investment, it has enabled us to embark on an exciting new chapter with @porsche.motorsport and @cupra_official. The support from them has been immense.”He further wrote, “Long story short — I’m glad I didn’t give up and kept trying to pursue big things in motorsport. The @fiaformulae championship, and @jeffformulae in particular, have given me an environment where I can be me (mostly), and I can finally say that this year I’m enjoying my job again. Thank you to everyone who has supported me to this point. I know it’s only one race win, but it conjured up a lot of emotions for me personally, along with my father and family, who sacrificed so much. Plenty more to come, I hope. Onto Berlin!”Posting pictures of himself showing middle fingers to the camera, he added at the end, “P.S. Last 2 slides are for all those who doubted me.”IndyCar racer Louis Foster reacted to his post, saying, “Mega mega mega mate.” There was also a congratulatory message from the FIA Formula E page. Social media star Juca Vipari wrote, “YESSSSS BROTHER! The first of many!!”A fan also told Ticktum in the comments section, “Enjoy 1 million beers.” Another said, “A fight-or-flight mode and you chose the harder option with an EXTREMELY high reward — and it paid off! Congrats Dan! The first of many.” One more added, “So deserved. Thinking from the end of last year to where you and the team are now — seriously amazing work.

Antonio Felix Da Costa misses out on podium in Jakarta

Antonio Felix Da Costa continues to hold third place in the 2025 Formula E Driver Standings. He missed out on the podium at the recently held Jakarta E-Prix by just one position, but he did give race winner Dan Ticktum a hug on his first-ever Formula E victory. The Porsche driver has now revealed his race routine with a pinch of humour. His fans obviously loved the video shared by Porsche on its official Instagram handle.Porsche has shared a short, fun video featuring Antonio Felix Da Costa’s race routine on Instagram with the caption: “Race day with António – stay close or stay back.”The video starts with Da Costa waking up at 6:29 a.m. for media day and cruising to the circuit, as it was a casual Monday. There’s then a glimpse of the garage, which smells like “focused rubber and podium energy.” He even has his own name for media day, which he calls “Smile until your face hurts.”It’s also revealed that Da Costa sits with the engineers to understand the data – and he actually gets it. As he suits up in his race gear, it’s said to be “30 percent style and 70 percent sweat.” The video also offers a close look at his Porsche electric car, which he races in the Formula E Grand Prix this season.His fans loved the fun video and called it “awesome”. One fan wrote, “Cool guy, super driver!” Another reacted, “That's our Antonio!” with fire and heart emojis. A third fan wrote in Portuguese (translated to English), “The purest reality!

Congrats @dan_ticktum on your first victory in @fiaformulae.”At present, the Porsche driver sits third in the Driver Standings with 100 points. He is behind championship leader Oliver Rowland and his own teammate Pascal Wehrlein.

Sergio Aguero takes on the race track in a GEN3 Evo



All about GEN3 Evo Sessions

Manchester City star Sergio Aguero is one of the few chosen ones to get a chance to drive a Formula E car on a race track. The footballer had his own GEN3 Evo session, guided by none other than TAG Heuer Porsche driver Pascal Wehrlein. And Aguero nailed it by driving the electric race car like a pro, although he missed his engineer’s message to slow down to cool the tyres.Sergio Aguero got the opportunity to drive the Porsche 99X Electric GEN3 Evo Formula E car during Miami’s Evo Sessions on March 5 and 6. The video from his Evo session is pure entertainment, as he takes lap after lap, clearly enjoying the thrill of driving a race car.Earlier, the official handle of FIA Formula E shared a video from Sergio’s Evo Session on Instagram. It showed how the footballer missed the messages to slow down and continued at high speed despite the need to cool the tyres. He later asked them to raise the volume and eventually slowed down. Pascal Wehrlein was seen doing a great job coaching him over the radio.The 37-year-old told Formulae.com about the opportunity, “This is absolutely crazy: from footballer to racing driver in one of the fastest racing cars in the world.Every child is familiar with Porsche. The brand represents an iconic heritage, particularly in motorsport. I am absolutely delighted and would like to thank everyone involved for this unique opportunity.”Aguero and other participants underwent detailed training, which included simulator sessions, physical conditioning, driver coaching, hardware customization, and engineering briefings. It not only gave them the thrill of driving a race car but also gave viewers insight into the intricate world of Formula E — how a driver is trained and how the car is driven during a race. A complete documentary will be released later this year, showcasing the entire Evo Sessions footage.Sharing his reaction when Formula E CEO Jeff Dodds first presented the idea, he said, “The initial reaction when I presented the concept of ‘Evo Sessions’ to our teams and partners was, ‘This is wild!’ — which is when I immediately knew we had to bring it to life. We wanted to do something that has never been done before in motorsport; something that would give audiences and our fan base a unique perspective into the world of a Formula E driver, through the eyes of some of their favourite online personalities. ”He added, “Formula E is the fastest-growing motorsport in the world, and we have a clear target to hit half a billion fans by 2030. Through collaborating with some of the biggest names in popular culture right now, we’re able to open up Formula E to a whole new fanbase.”Also Read: Pascal Wehrlein on second place in Shanghai: “First time I felt like we were very competitive in the wet” Even the trainers are among the best Formula E drivers in the world.

Edoardo Mortara on being part of Mahindra Racing



Formula E Season 11 has turned out well for most teams, with new podium winners emerging in each round. At the recently held Jakarta E-Prix, it was Mahindra Racing’s Edoardo Mortara who secured his first podium of the season and the team’s second. While he’s happy to have claimed second place in Jakarta, he feels they could have achieved even more. His teammate, Nyck De Vries, was handed a ten-second time penalty for colliding with Jake Dennis as they approached the finish line.Edoardo Mortara joined Mahindra Racing in 2023 and had been chasing a podium finish ever since. Speaking after securing second place at the Jakarta E-Prix, the 38-year-old said, “I’m feeling kind of disappointed for the team because I think that more was possible for us, but actually happy for me. It’s been a long time coming, this podium, and if I look back, there were several occasions where, with a bit more luck, we could have changed it. ”Mortara found his podium opportunity when both his teammate Nyck De Vries and Andretti’s Jake Dennis were removed from contention after their collision. “But nevertheless, super happy with today’s race. I think we managed the strategy pretty well, especially with the first Attack Mode.We got a little bit unlucky with the Safety Car and Full Course Yellow because I think I could have made good use of my Attack Mode and passed Dan [Ticktum]. I was in front of him before the second Attack Mode. Nevertheless, super happy with second place and already looking forward to the next one,” he said.However, Mortara regrets that Jakarta isn't a double-header this year, unlike its last edition in 2023. ""Right from the start of the year, we're showing more and more performance, and this weekend we were really, really good. It's a shame that we only have one race here. I would have hoped to have a second one,"" he told FormulaE.com in an interview.Now running high on confidence, Mortara aims to continue the momentum in the upcoming Berlin double-header. He has achieved multiple podiums in Berlin in previous years, including one win.Reflecting on Mahindra Racing’s significant improvement this season, Mortara said, ""This year has been crucial for us. We brought some big updates in terms of software that helped us close a bit of the gap with the front-runners. I feel that now we have a package that is capable — not always, but on certain race weekends — of challenging at the front, and we probably had the best package in the race. Nevertheless, this result (Jakarta) shows great promise for the final race weekends, especially Berlin, which has always been a good one for me.

But yeah, we’ll take that podium and hopefully carry the momentum into the last four races. ”When asked how he felt after the podium finish, Mueller had told the media, “Very good! We always had the race pace all season long. Qualifying has always been our Achilles’ heel, if you want to call it that. Today I felt like I had a car to get into the [qualifying] duels, but a slight mistake in these very dusty conditions cost me a lot.”Speaking about how he improved in the race, he added, “But then in the race, I managed to move up early and worked my way into the top eight. We were a bit lucky with the strategy, but I also think we executed really well. Whenever we had an opportunity to move forward, we took it, and we had good pace at the end. Very happy with how it all went — obviously super pleased for the whole team and my crew. They really deserve this podium, and I hope we can keep that momentum going into the last four races. ”Also Read: Nyck De Vries collides with Jake Dennis at Jakarta E-Prix; fans compare him to Max Verstappen Mueller is now 14th in the Formula E Driver Standings with 47 points, while his teammate Jake Dennis holds 10th place with 59 points.","Nico Mueller took to Instagram to share his joy at the podium finish at the Jakarta E-Prix.

Formula E fans compare Nyck De Vries with Max Verstappen

Dan Ticktum won his first Formula E race in Jakarta on Saturday. But the result of the race could have been different had Mahindra Racing’s Nyck De Vries not made contact with Andretti’s Jake Dennis. De Vries was issued a ten-second time penalty during the race, but it also killed the chances of either of them reaching the podium. In the end, it was the other Mahindra Racing driver, Edoardo Mortara, who took the second spot on the podium, with the other Andretti driver, Nico Mueller, finishing in third position.At Lap 20, the Mahindra Racing cars made a sandwich at the top, squeezing Dennis into second position, but De Vries’ contact with Dennis killed both their chances of reaching the podium.

As a result of the collision, debris from both cars was seen flying onto the track, with the Andretti car suffering more damage after losing its front wing.

The penalty, however, changed the order at the top.Jake Dennis highlighted the collision by sharing the video on his Instagram Stories and wrote, “Leading the race then get welcomed with this.” The Andretti driver was a contender for the winner’s trophy after securing pole. He had earned two podiums at the Jakarta double-header in 2023 and was very much in form to win another podium on Saturday.The video was shared on Formula E’s social media channels. A fan reacted to the video, “Thought that was Max Verstappen.” Another called it a “Classic Dutch move.” One more said, “Dutch drivers incapable of racing wheel to wheel with British drivers? I’ve seen this one before.”Also Read: Jakarta E-Prix 2025 results: Dan Ticktum registers first Formula E career win, Edoardo Mortara and Nico Mueller join him on podium Fans went on to compare Nyck De Vries with Formula 1 champion Max Verstappen of Red Bull, who had made contact with Mercedes driver George Russell during the recent Spanish Grand Prix.

I've been in Formula E nearly four years now, but the whole time I’ve known this is what I can do. Now I’ve got a good car and I’m doing it. I’m very, very happy. I think a lot of people forgot I used to be quite handy on the F1 ladder back in the day, and now I’m just going to start proving it again. ”Praising his team, Cupra Kiro, Ticktum added, “The guys are pretty remarkable – in six, seven months, the rate of improvement we’ve had over this season is incredible. We started in quite a not-great place, and I was a little bit underwhelmed at the beginning of the season, but we chipped away.Since Miami, it’s been quite a steep upward trajectory, so I’m very, very proud of them. I’ve been with them since day one here, and to deliver that is very special for them – and a great feeling for me. ”Ticktum was part of the Red Bull Junior Team from 2017 to 2019.

How Formula E is making an impact in Jakarta

Jakarta Race Promo: Heat, Grit & Gen3 Evo on Street Wheels | Formula E S11 R12

Formula E is not only introducing the fastest electric car, the GEN3 Evo, at the Jakarta E-Prix this year but also making an impact off the track. Several Formula E members participated in a beach clean-up on Thursday at Pantai Beach in the Ancol resort, where the race will be held. They are also engaging in local partnerships, educational initiatives, and community outreach to help reduce the environmental impact in the city.On Thursday, June 19, Formula E, Waste4Change, and over 100 volunteers—including FE team members and drivers—joined local community members for a large-scale beach clean-up. The initiative focused on conserving marine habitats and addressing waste management, a key issue in coastal Jakarta.Julia Pallé, VP of Sustainability at Formula E, said about the drive: “Plastic pollution is a growing problem that affects everyone around the world and is a growing challenge here in Jakarta — threatening both coastal habitats and the health of nearby communities. At every race, we are committed to engaging with local communities and aim to leave a place better than we found it. We are united as a championship with the community to clean the local area of plastic rubbish and ensure it is sustainably managed and not put back into landfill.To further minimize waste at the event, free hydration stations will provide water refills to reduce reliance on single-use plastic bottles. Visitors will also receive biodegradable eco-cups made from corn starch flour as an alternative to traditional plastic. Six dedicated waste stations will be set up for proper recycling and plastic waste management.Formula E has undertaken several more sustainability initiatives in Jakarta. A Formula E delegation visited the Waste4Change recycling center on Tuesday to learn about effective waste management practices and the role of the circular economy in conserving resources.On Wednesday, a school visit featured a panel talk on environmental education and youth leadership, along with art and cultural exchanges between students and Formula E members.Following the race, a paddock plant donation is scheduled. Trees and plants used during the event will be donated to local schools. After the race on Saturday, Formula E will host a ceremony on-site with local school students to mark the donation.Also Read: Jakarta E-Prix 2025: Schedule, how to watch Round 12 Formula E race, weather prediction In addition, Formula E’s Better Futures Fund is providing a €25,000 donation to Yayasan Perempuan dan Anak Amirah.

Jakarta E‑Prix Essentials: Everything You Need to Know | Formula E Season 11, Round 12

Season 11 of the ABB FIA Formula E World Championship is coming to a close, with five races remaining on the calendar. The Jakarta E-Prix is a crucial race, and it's hard to predict who may lift the trophy in Indonesia this year. The current season has already seen seven different race winners and fifteen drivers on the podium. Not only that, but every single team has achieved a podium finish so far — a clear indication of how tight and unpredictable the competition is.Nissan's Oliver Rowland is far ahead of the competition so far, as he dominates the FIA Drivers' World Championship standings with 171 points — significantly ahead of Pascal Wehrlein, who sits in second position with 103 points for TAG Heuer Porsche. Rowland has a total of four wins and three second-place finishes this season, and he may continue his winning streak in Jakarta as well.Maserati MSG Racing’s Maximilian Gunther is being counted among the hot favourites to bag a podium at the Jakarta E-Prix. He has two wins under his belt this year and will be trying his best to maintain his stronghold in the city and add more points to his tally.He had secured third place in the Part 1 race in 2023, having started from Julius Bar Pole Position — a historic moment as Maserati's first single-seater motorsport pole since 1958.He again bagged the pole the next day of the double-header and went on to win his first race in the iconic blue livery of Maserati MSG Racing. It marked Maserati’s first single-seater championship podium since Juan Manuel Fangio's 1957 German Grand Prix victory, en route to that year’s Formula One title.Pascal Wehrlein won one of the two races at the Jakarta E-Prix’s last edition, and the TAG Heuer Porsche driver is very much in form at present, with a win in Miami and three more podium finishes in the Formula E 2025 World Championship so far. He is second in the 2025 Formula E Driver Standings with 103 points and will be aiming for a win to catch up with Rowland.Jaguar TCS Racing’s Mitch Evans has been away from the podium for a long time now after winning the first race of this season in Sao Paulo. But this could also indicate his growing hunger for a win — or at least another podium — possibly in Jakarta, before the season comes to a close. Evans had won the first edition of the Jakarta E-Prix in 2022, when three drivers crossed the line within a single second. The other two drivers were Jean-Éric Vergne and Edoardo Mortara, who took second and third positions in that Season 8 race.He also bagged the third spot on the podium in Race 2 of the Jakarta double-header in 2023.

'I had so much hate'

London: Carlos Alcaraz warned his Wimbledon rivals that he ""feels great"" on grass after the world number two defied his own expectations by winning the Queen's Club title for a second time.Alcaraz battled to a bruising 7-5, 6-7 (5/7), 6-2 victory over Czech world number 30 Jiri Lehecka in the final of the Wimbledon warm-up event on Sunday.The 22-year-old has extended his career-best winning streak to 18 matches, putting him in the perfect position to defend his Wimbledon title.Alcaraz has won the French Open, the Rome Masters and Queen's during his blistering run.But the five-time Grand Slam champion had arrived in west London concerned about his ability to make the tricky transition from the clay-court season to the unique demands of the brief grass campaign.Underling the difficulty of the task, Alcaraz is the first player to win Roland Garros and Queen's back to back since Rafael Nadal in 2008.""I'm going to say it's really complicated, the switch from clay to grass in just few days, because that's the time I had before the tournament began, just two days of practising,"" Alcaraz said.""So I came here with no expectations at all. I came here with a goal to play two or three matches, try to feel great on grass, and give myself the feedback of what I have to improve.""But I got used to the grass really quick, and I'm really proud about it. My goal was complete, and I'm not talking about lifting the trophy or making the final.""It was just to feel great, to feel really comfortable on grass once again.""For a player raised on the clay courts of Spain, Alcaraz has become a formidable force on the lawns of Queen's and Wimbledon.He is only the third Spanish man to win four grass-court tournaments after Nadal and Feliciano Lopez.""It's great to be with Rafa and Feli, such great players from our country,"" he said.""Hopefully now I will not stop here. Hopefully keep going.""A key part of Alcaraz's winning formula is his ability to switch off from tennis after tournaments to ensure he is refreshed when he returns to the court.The former world number one partied in Ibiza after his epic five-set French Open final triumph against Jannik Sinner earlier this month.He won't have time for a similar holiday before Wimbledon starts on June 30, but he plans to relax as much as possible in London before focusing on his bid for a third successive All England Club crown.""A lot of people ask me the same question: Are you going to go back to Ibiza? I wish! As I said, I'm a player who needs days off to enjoy, days for myself to spend with my friends, with my family, just to turn off my mind,"" he said.""I can't go back home. I'm going to stay here in London, hopefully enjoy it a little bit, then be back and preparing Wimbledon the best way possible.""While Sinner crashed out in the Halle second round against Alexander Bublik this week, Alcaraz's success at Queen's moved his record since losing to David Goffin at the Miami Masters in March to a formidable 27-1.Alcaraz believes that defeat was a transformative moment in his season.""I had so much hate when I lost in Miami. A lot of people started to say 'What's going on with this guy. He just lost in the first round, and he didn't practice, he didn't go to the court',"" Alcaraz said.""I think that was the key, just to have five, six days off, not grabbing a racquet, not stepping on the court. Just go to vacation with my family, to turn off my mind, to think what should I have done better?""I just got the joy back. I started to enjoy playing tennis again, realising what is the most important thing for me.""","Carlos Alcaraz wins Queen's Club title for second time. Beats Jiri Lehecka 7-5, 6-7 (5/7), 6-2 in the final on Sunday. World number two extends his winning streak to 18 matches. He is the first player to win Roland Garros and Queen's back to back since Rafael Nadal.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122014918,imgsize-66630,width-400,resizemode-4/122014918.jpg"

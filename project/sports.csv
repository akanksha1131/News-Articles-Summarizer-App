'Shubman Gill used his brains a lot more than the other guys'

NEW DELHI: Abhishek Sharma stole the spotlight with a breathtaking 59 off just 20 balls, setting the tone for Sunrisers Hyderabad ’s emphatic six-wicket win over Lucknow Super Giants in Match 61 of IPL 2025 at the Ekana Stadium .The young left-hander’s fireworks at the top helped SRH chase down a challenging target of 206 with 10 balls to spare, dashing LSG’s hopes of making the playoffs.Opening alongside Atharva Taide, Abhishek came out with aggressive intent, taking on the bowlers from the outset.He smashed four boundaries and cleared the rope six times in his whirlwind knock, reaching his fifty real quick.His fearless hitting saw SRH race to 99 in under eight overs before he was dismissed by Digvesh Rathi, slicing a wide googly to sweeper cover, a moment that sparked a heated exchange between the two players.Even after Abhishek’s departure, SRH maintained control. Ishan Kishan contributed a brisk 35 off 28, while Heinrich Klaasen added a fluent 47 off 28 to ensure the chase stayed on track.Brief interruptions, including Kamindu Mendis retiring hurt, didn’t slow the innings, as Aniket Verma and Nitish Reddy finished the job comfortably in the 19th over.Earlier, Lucknow Super Giants posted a solid 205/7, thanks to Mitchell Marsh (65 off 39), Aiden Markram (61 off 38), and a late flourish from Nicholas Pooran (45 off 26).However, LSG’s bowling lacked sting, with only Digvesh Rathi (2/37 in 4 overs) managing breakthroughs. Their inability to contain runs during the powerplay and middle overs proved costly.With this result, SRH keep their campaign alive while LSG bow out of the playoff race.

Poll Do you think LSG can bounce back next season despite their injury challenges this year? No, injuries will continue to plague them. Yes, they have a strong batting line-up.

'Chances are still there': Abishek Porel believes in IPL 2025 playoff miracle

NEW DELHI: Captain Rishabh Pant on Monday acknowledged that the Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) struggled to fill the gaps left by injured key bowlers, as their six-wicket defeat to Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) ended their hopes of making the IPL 2025 playoffs.The defeat marked the end of a challenging campaign for LSG, whose bowling unit remained under pressure throughout the season due to multiple injury setbacks.""Definitely it could have been one of our best seasons but coming into the tournament we had a lot of gaps, injuries and as a team we decided to not talk about that, but it became difficult to fill those gaps for us,"" Pant told the broadcaster after the loss.LSG were plagued by injuries even before the tournament began, with Mohsin Khan, Avesh Khan, Akash Deep, and Mayank Yadav sidelined. Though they roped in Shardul Thakur mid-season and saw Avesh and Akash return to action, Mayank’s participation was limited to just a couple of games before injury ruled him out again.""The way we planned the auction, if we would have had the same bowling.. but this is cricket, sometimes things go your way and sometimes they don't, we take pride in the way we played and take the positives from the season than the negative side.""Despite his own struggles with the bat, Pant pointed to LSG's batting strength as a major takeaway.""We have a strong batting line up, have enough firepower and that is the biggest positive for the season,"" he said.Reflecting on the campaign, Pant admitted the team couldn’t keep up with rivals as the playoff race intensified.""The first half of the season we played really well but the second half it became tougher and tougher to catch up with the teams on the brighter side,"" he added.He also lauded young spinner Digvesh Rathi ’s emergence as a bright spot in an otherwise underwhelming campaign.""(Digvesh) Rathi has come up nicely for us, his first season, the way he bowled, he is one of the positives, but you need to keep improving yourself and get better and better as the seasons go,"" Pant noted.",Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) lost to Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) in IPL 2025.

'Chances are still there': Abishek Porel believes in IPL 2025 playoff miracle

NEW DELHI: Former India cricketer and 2007 T20 World Cup hero Joginder Sharma believes the time has come for Chennai Super Kings ( CSK ) legend MS Dhoni to “rest.” The five-time IPL champions, known for their consistency with 12 playoff appearances, endured a disappointing campaign in the 2025 season, failing to make it past the group stage. After regular captain Ruturaj Gaikwad was ruled out due to injury, Dhoni stepped in to lead a struggling side.Speculation around Dhoni’s future in the IPL has intensified since CSK’s early exit. Retirement rumours gained traction last month when Dhoni’s family attended the match against Delhi Capitals at Chepauk.The 43-year-old's move down the batting order further stoked the chatter, especially after head coach Stephen Fleming admitted Dhoni couldn't ""bat for 10 overs running full stick.""Joginder, who bowled the iconic final over under Dhoni’s captaincy in the 2007 T20 World Cup final, feels the veteran wicketkeeper-batter should call time on his illustrious 18-year IPL career.""Considering Mahi's fitness level, he should bat higher up to prove his form, but I believe it's time for him to rest,"" Joginder said.Earlier this month, Dhoni addressed questions about his retirement after playing a match-winning role against defending champions Kolkata Knight Riders. He acknowledged that any decision would depend on how his body holds up in the next few months.""After this IPL gets over, I have to work hard for another 6–8 months to see if my body can take this pressure. Nothing to decide now, but the love and affection I have seen is excellent,"" Dhoni said at the post-match presentation.","Former India cricketer and 2007 T20 World Cup hero Joginder Sharma believes the time has come for Chennai Super Kings ( CSK ) legend MS Dhoni to “rest.” The five-time IPL champions endured a disappointing campaign in the 2025 season, failing to make it past the group stage.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121279771,imgsize-39846,width-400,resizemode-4/Dhoni-2005-IPL.jpg"

Bombay Sport Exchange Ep 5: Shane Watson on how IPL gave him a lifeline & his tribute to Phil Hughes

Poll Do you believe Stokes made the right choice by opting out of IPL auctions? Unsure It depends on his recovery No, he should play both formats Yes, for his Test career

Widely regarded as England's all-time best amongst all-rounders, 33-year-old Ben Stokes has been out of action ever since December 2024. The test skipper has been in recovery ever since and is expected to return for the one-off test against Zimbabwe set to commence on May 22.Stokes' recovery post-surgery has nearly concluded, and the veteran hopes to play a significant role against Zimbabwe in the test to come. Speaking to the Untapped podcast, Stokes admitted that recovering from injuries have become significantly more challenging for him, and that he has to put in so much effort just to be in a position that allows him to give his best for the team. The player, after the 2023 Indian Premier League season, also opted out of successive auctions to prolong his Test career.""After my first major injury, I remember the shock of it, after the initial adrenaline had stopped, thinking: ‘How has this happened? We did have a bit of a drink four or five nights ago, could that have played a part? It wouldn’t have helped"", said Stokes.Reflecting on what changed in his attitude towards drinking, the Englishman added, ""OK, I need to start changing what I do.’ I don’t think I’ll ever be completely sober but I’ve not had a drink since 2 January. I said to myself: ‘Not until I finish my injury rehab and get back on the field.’ I think the day I wake up and can’t be bothered to do the training programme is getting towards that time you don’t really want it any more. But I haven’t got any interest in stopping.While Stokes later clarified that he has no plans on giving up drinking completely, it is imperative that he abstains form the same until he has fully recovered and able to perform at the peak of his abilities. The player has also signed with an alcohol-free spirits brand called CleanCo, and admitted that his urge to drink nowadays is rather moderate.Stokes first injured himself at the hundred, after which he tore his hamstring, needing surgery in the tour of New Zealand in December.",Ben Stokes is set to return to red-ball cricket against Zimbabwe on May 22.

IPL 2025: The unsung heroes of India's T20 league

NEW DELHI: At the season-opening Diamond League meet in Doha on Friday, all eyes were on Indian star Neeraj Chopra , who finally broke the elusive 90m barrier with a superb 90.23m throw.But one notable name missing from the javelin throw lineup was Pakistan’s Arshad Nadeem , the reigning Olympics gold medallist.Nadeem’s absence wasn’t due to injury or form issues, it was part of a planned training strategy.The 27-year-old is currently focused on preparing for the Asian Athletics Championships , set to take place in Gumi, South Korea, from May 27 to 31.According to his coaching team, Nadeem will depart for South Korea on May 22, prioritising peak performance at the continental event over early-season showings like the Diamond League.While Nadeem sat this one out, Chopra and Germany's Julian Weber made a statement in Doha.Under the guidance of legendary coach Jan Zelezny , the world record holder, Chopra became only the third Asian and 25th athlete in history to breach the 90m mark.His 90.23m effort wasn’t enough to win, though, as Weber edged ahead with a final-throw bomb of 91.06m. Still, for Chopra, it was a massive psychological and physical breakthrough.Chopra credited Zelezny’s presence and ideal weather conditions for his performance and expressed confidence that even longer throws are possible this season. As the reigning world champion, Chopra will head into the World Championships in Tokyo (Sept 13–21) with high momentum.""I am very happy that Jan Zelezny is my coach, and we worked very hard in South Africa. We are still working on some aspects. My next goal remains 90m,"" he said.",Neeraj Chopra broke the 90m barrier with a superb 90.23m throw.

Rishabh Pant will be eager to reset his faltering IPL campaign as Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) face Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) in a crucial encounter on Monday.LSG must win all their remaining three matches to keep their slim play-off hopes alive, needing not just victories but dominant ones to overcome a poor net run rate of -0.469.Pant, who fetched a record Rs 27 crore in the last IPL auction, has endured a torrid season, scoring just 128 runs in 11 games at an average of 12.80 and a strike rate below 100. With his name in contention for India’s Test vice-captaincy, the LSG skipper will be keen to deliver impactful performances to boost both his form and image.SRH, already out of play-off contention, will play for pride. Players like Nitish Kumar Reddy and Ishan Kishan will look to gain form ahead of India A’s England tour, while Abhishek Sharma will aim to prove a point after his omission.LSG will bank on Nicholas Pooran and openers Aiden Markram and Mitchell Marsh. Their bowling has struggled, with only Digvesh Rathi impressing. SRH’s in-form batting could exploit LSG's inconsistent attack in this do-or-die match.The red soil pitch offers a well-balanced contest between bat and ball. With a hard, well-rolled surface, it promises pace and bounce for the fast bowlers and some grip for spinners, especially in the first half. Average scores hover around 190, but the large ground dimensions — 72m and 60m square, 78m straight — can keep totals in check. The pitch has been used before and should allow for free-flowing stroke play, especially for top-order batters. Given previous match trends, it may slightly assist spin early and become better under lights, making it a likely ""win the toss and chase"" scenario.Aiden Markram, Nicholas Pooran, Rishabh Pant (c & wk), Abdul Samad, Ayush Badoni, David Miller, Akash Maharaj Singh, Digvesh Singh Rathi, Avesh Khan, Mayank Yadav, Prince YadavImpact Sub: Mitchell Marsh/Ravi BishnoiAbhishek Sharma, Ishan Kishan (wk), Sachin Baby, Heinrich Klaasen, Aniket Verma, Abhinav Manohar, Pat Cummins (c), Harshal Patel, Jaydev Unadkat, Zeeshan Ansari, Eshan MalingaImpact Sub: Travis Head/Mohammed ShamiA hot and sunny day is expected in Lucknow on Monday, with temperatures peaking around 40°C and no chance of rain.

With 10 games remaining in the league stage, CSK, RR, SRH and KKR are already out of contention for the playoffs.GT, RCB and PBKS are now sure to make the playoffs, but MI still have a fair chance and DC relatively less so, while LSG have slim chances.There remain 1,024 possible combinations of results, so nothing is for sure yet for any of the six remaining in the race.There are 1,024 possible combinations of results remaining with 10 games to go.For each team, we looked at how many of these end up with them being among the top four either singly or tied.We also looked at how many combinations put each team in the top two either singly or jointly.For instance, GT finish in the top two in 848 of the possible combinations of match outcomes, translating to a 82.8% chance of being first or second, singly or jointly.","With 10 games remaining in the league stage, CSK, RR, SRH and KKR are already out of contention for the playoffs.

Gujarat Titans (GT) opener Sai Sudharsan has credited captain Shubman Gill for his ""straight talks"" during their partnerships, which have helped him improve as a cricketer in this year's Indian Premier League (IPL).On Sunday evening, the southpaw smashed 108 not out off 61 balls as GT chased down 200 in 19 overs. He was well supported by captain Shubman Gill, who remained unbeaten on 93 off 53 balls.“There's a lot of understanding between us (him and Shubman Gill). Running between the wickets is one thing we talk about, and when I make a mistake, he points it out — and similarly from my side as well,” said Sudharsan during the post-match presentation ceremony.Asked how he aced the chase, Sudharsan said, “It feels great to help the team win. I missed out quite a few times in doing so this season, and during the break, I was thinking about it — and it paid off today.”“After the six overs, during overs 7 to 10, they bowled really well, and the momentum dipped a bit. But we were cool and calm enough to take the game deep. We got a couple of big overs around 12–13, which helped. In previous games, I took chances and got out, but this time I was more aware and took the right matchups.”Sudharsan is currently sitting on top of the Orange Cap race with 617 runs to his name. He is closely followed by his captain Shubman Gill, who has amassed 601 runs so far this season.The 10-wicket win against Delhi Capitals has propelled the Titans to their third playoffs. Captain Gill was a happy man and also showered praise on his opening partner, who is in red-hot form.“He has been in tremendous form this season — the way he has been able to convert starts. You see the conditions and the situation — we talk about finishing the game and not leaving it to anyone else, because on a wicket like this, a couple of wickets could create pressure. At the halfway mark, we felt we gave 10–15 runs extra. They batted well, and the ball was spinning,” said Gill of Sudharsan.","Gujarat Titans (GT) opener Sai Sudharsan has credited captain Shubman Gill for his ""straight talks"" during their partnerships.

Poll Should Harpreet Brar's performance be considered the key factor in PBKS's win? No, batting was more crucial Yes, his wickets changed the game

NEW DELHI: Nehal Wadhera and Shashank Singh smashed half-centuries, while left-arm spinner Harpreet Brar bagged three wickets as Punjab Kings edged Rajasthan Royals by 10 runs on Sunday to boost their IPL playoff hopes. Powered by Wadhera’s explosive 70 off 37 balls, an unbeaten 59 from Shashank, and a handy 30-run knock by skipper Shreyas Iyer , PBKS posted a strong 219 for 5.In response, RR openers Yashasvi Jaiswal (50 off 25) and Vaibhav Suryavanshi (40) gave the home team a blistering start, adding 76 runs in just 4.5 overs. But Harpreet Brar (3/22) broke the momentum by removing Suryavanshi in the fifth over, triggering a steady fall of wickets. Despite a fighting 53 off 31 balls from Dhruv Jurel, Rajasthan fell short, finishing at 209 for 7.Azmatullah Omarzai (2/44) also made key contributions with the ball, dismissing skipper Sanju Samson (20) and the dangerous Shimron Hetmyer (11).The win took Punjab Kings to 17 points — level with second-placed Royal Challengers Bengaluru — but they sit third on the table due to net run rate.After the match, PBKS pacer Arshdeep Singh shared a light-hearted moment with RR opener Jaiswal, who had taken him to the cleaners early on. Jaiswal blazed away to a 25-ball 50, smashing Arshdeep for four boundaries and a six in his very first over, scoring 22 off 6 deliveries.Arshdeep, who had a forgettable outing conceding 60 runs in his four overs, posted a humorous video on Instagram. In it, he tells Jaiswal in a typical Bollywood tone, “Bohot maara be, dhaaga hi khol diya” (You really smashed me, tore the thread off). Jaiswal replied with a grin, “Ekdum, maine bola tha isko, mai maarunga ek din” (Absolutely, I had told him I’ll smash him one day).Meanwhile, PBKS skipper Shreyas Iyer etched his name in IPL history by becoming the first player to captain three different franchises into the playoffs.

Rahul Dravid reflects on RR's narrow losses: 'One or two hits away in every game'

Poll Do you believe Shreyas Iyer will continue his successful captaincy in the upcoming matches? No, I doubt it. Yes, definitely!

NEW DELHI: Nehal Wadhera and Shashank Singh struck fluent half-centuries, while left-arm spinner Harpreet Brar picked up three crucial wickets as Punjab Kings defeated Rajasthan Royals by 10 runs on Sunday to seal a spot in the IPL 2025 playoffs. The win took Punjab to 17 points — level with Royal Challengers Bengaluru — but RCB retained second place thanks to a better net run rate.Leading PBKS in his debut season with the franchise, Shreyas Iyer etched his name in the IPL record books by becoming the first player to captain three different teams into the playoffs. He had earlier led Delhi Capitals in 2019 and 2020, and Kolkata Knight Riders in 2024, before repeating the feat with Punjab this season.Overall, Iyer is only the fifth player to lead three different IPL franchises, joining the likes of Steve Smith (Rajasthan Royals, Pune Warriors India, Rising Pune Supergiant), Kumar Sangakkara (Punjab Kings, Deccan Chargers, Sunrisers Hyderabad), Mahela Jayawardene (Punjab Kings, Kochi Tuskers Kerala, Delhi Capitals), and Ajinkya Rahane (Rajasthan Royals, Rising Pune Supergiant, Kolkata Knight Riders).Among them, only Iyer and Sangakkara have led all three sides on a full-time basis.Batting first, Punjab piled up a daunting 219 for 5, powered by Wadhera’s blistering 70 off 37 balls, Shashank’s unbeaten 59, and a handy 30 from captain Iyer.In reply, Rajasthan came out all guns blazing, with openers Yashasvi Jaiswal (50) and Vaibhav Suryavanshi (40) adding 76 runs in just 4.5 overs. But Brar (3/22) provided the breakthrough by removing Suryavanshi in the fifth over, triggering a steady fall of wickets. RR eventually finished at 209 for 7, falling just short in a high-scoring thriller.Punjab Kings will now take on Delhi Capitals on May 24 and Mumbai Indians on May 26 in their final two league matches.","Shreyas Iyer becomes the first player to captain three different teams into the IPL playoffs.

Five-time champions Chennai Super Kings (CSK) will look to give their young guns another chance to shine as they face a deflated Rajasthan Royals (RR) in their final IPL 2025 league stage match at the Arun Jaitley Stadium on Tuesday.With Delhi Capitals having completed their home fixtures, the national capital now hosts its first neutral game of the season—a fresh setting for two sides with contrasting agendas. While CSK continue their rebuilding journey after a season of misfires, RR are desperate to salvage pride from a campaign that never quite took off.CSK’s campaign may be forgettable in the standings, but it’s been valuable in terms of unearthing future stars. 17-year-old Ayush Mhatre has emerged as a revelation at the top, offering the kind of powerplay aggression the team has sorely lacked—reflected in their league-low run rate of 8.3 in the first six overs.On a flat Delhi pitch that saw over 400 runs scored on Sunday, Mhatre, along with Dewald Brevis, Urvil Patel, and Shaik Rasheed, could be key to posting—or chasing—big totals. With RR’s bowling attack at its weakest this season, CSK’s youngsters will fancy their chances.For Rajasthan Royals, the final game marks the end of a disappointing journey. They have lost 8 of 9 matches while chasing and failed to close out tight games—including a Super Over defeat to Delhi and a narrow loss to Punjab. Their decision to overhaul the squad in the mega auction, letting go of stalwarts like Jos Buttler and relying heavily on unproven Indian batters, has backfired.The team’s bowling, despite the presence of Jofra Archer, lacked an all-rounder to balance the XI. Only Yashasvi Jaiswal and young Vaibhav Suryavanshi have shown consistency with the bat. With nothing to lose, RR will aim to sign off with a rare win—and potentially play spoiler to CSK’s positive finish.The surface at the Arun Jaitley Stadium has been true and batter-friendly, with short boundaries aiding stroke-play. Expect a high-scoring affair once again. While spinners may get some grip early on, dew could level the playing field in the second innings, making this another “win the toss and chase” encounter.Tuesday evening in New Delhi will be hot and dry, with game-time temperatures hovering around 35°C. Humidity is expected to stay manageable at around 30–35%. With no rain forecast, conditions are ideal for uninterrupted cricket.Ayush Mhatre, Dewald Brevis, Urvil Patel, Shaik Rasheed, Shivam Dube, MS Dhoni (c & wk), Ravindra Jadeja, Deepak Hooda, Khaleel Ahmed, Matheesha Pathirana, Noor AhmadVijay Shankar / Mukesh ChoudharyYashasvi Jaiswal, Vaibhav Suryavanshi, Sanju Samson (c & wk), Shimron Hetmyer, Riyan Parag, Shubham Dubey, Wanindu Hasaranga, Kumar Kartikeya, Akash Madhwal, Maheesh Theekshana, Tushar DeshpandeDhruv Jurel / Fazalhaq FarooqiThe CSK vs RR match will be played at the Arun Jaitley Stadium, Delhi.

Henrikh Mkhitaryan's European journey from Manchester to Munich

A historic opportunity in Munich for Mkhitaryan

Henrikh Mkhitaryan is on the verge of making football history. The Armenian midfielder will join an exclusive group of players to have collected finals wins in all three of UEFA's present men's club competitions if Inter Milan defeats Paris Saint-Germain in the UEFA Champions League Final in Munich on 31 May 2025. It would complete an extraordinary European adventure for Mkhitaryan, who has claimed silverware with both Manchester United and AS Roma.Henrikh Mkhitaryan's European form flourished in the 2016–17 campaign when he scored in Manchester United's 2-0 win against Ajax. It was the UEFA Europa League final when Manchester United claimed their first-ever Europa League title. He had previously won another UEFA competition, the UEFA Europa Conference League, with Roma in 2022 as well. In that match, Roma defeated Feyenoord with the scoreline of 1-0 in the final held in the competition's first-ever season.In 2023, Mkhitaryan also reached the UEFA Champions League Final with Inter Milan, becoming the first Armenian to have done so. And while Inter would lose 1-0 to Manchester City, Mkhitaryan’s appearance represented a landmark for Armenian football. And now that Inter are due to contest the 2025 final with PSG, Mkhitaryan is on the brink of becoming one of the select few to win three titles in Europe’s leading club tournament.If Inter Milan are victorious in the showdown, Mkhitaryan would be the first to have won finals in the UEFA Champions League, UEFA Europa League, and UEFA Europa Conference League. It would be an unprecedented achievement for him in the history of European football, a measure of his ability to change and continue hitting the heights over different leagues and competitions.Inter Miami reached the final with a thrilling semi-final win over Barcelona, which went to penalties after a 3-3 aggregate draw. Mkhitaryan was crucial in the middle of the field, showing leadership and tenacity. As the finale nears, there will be much clamoring to see if he can make this history-breaking achievement.Also Read: No trophies for Arsenal this season after PSG advance to Champions League final The UEFA Champions League final will see Inter Milan take on Paris Saint-Germain on May 31, 2025, at the Allianz Arena in Munich.

Liverpool start strong but Brighton respond with character

Brighton's late surge downs the champions

Brighton & Hove Albion F.C. boost European hopes

Two last free-kicks sealed a dramatic 3-2 comeback victory for Brighton & Hove Albion against Premier League champions Liverpool at the Amex Stadium on Monday, 19 May 2025. Twice trailing in the match, Brighton showed resolve and also their forward power – the goals coming from Yasin Ayari, Kaoru Mitoma, and a teenager, Jack Hinshelwood – to register an exhilarating victory. A second-half miss from Mohamed Salah was costly for Liverpool, who were unable to close the game out and appeared to be a little off the pace a few days after securing the title.Liverpool broke the deadlock early in the 9th minute with Harvey Elliott. A rapid attack cut through the Brighton defense, and Elliott calmly finished off the mandatory one-on-one. The Reds appeared in command in the early going, but Brighton soon got into their flow.Yasin Ayari levelled for the hosts in the 32nd minute when he drilled a low shot into the corner from a loose ball at the edge of the box. But just five minutes before the break, Dominik Szoboszlai made it 2-1 to Liverpool when he also finished off a neat move in added time (45+1') by driving beyond Brighton’s Jason Steele.Liverpool held a 2-1 halftime advantage; the story was different in the second half.Brighton came out for the second half energized. Their leveller arrived in the 69th when Japanese winger Kaoru Mitoma produced an insane footwork and a composed finish to make it 2-2. The momentum was turning.Liverpool’s greatest opportunity to restore their lead fell to Mohamed Salah, but he untypically failed to find the back of the net from a one-on-one with the keeper. The miss by the Egyptians appeared to take the life out of the visitors, and Brighton capitalized to the fullest.That came in the 85th minute through 18-year-old academy graduate Jack Hinshelwood. On just his second Premier League appearance, the teenager collected a smart through ball before slotting home coolly to complete Brighton’s fightback. The Amex exploded, and Hinshelwood was an unlikely hero for the night.The latter result leaves Brighton still competing for European football next season after they moved up to eighth in the table. And with one game to go, they are also in pole position for a UEFA Conference League place.Also Read: Jeremie Frimpong set to join Arne Slot's Liverpool from Bayer Leverkusen For Liverpool, the result is a wake-up call – even for the team who have won everything this season. They looked like a side that was lacking in cohesion at times, and Salah’s rare gaffe was illustrative of how several of them faded. And Brighton will find cause for encouragement in a remarkable victory which showed off their squad strength, their spirit, and the improving quality of their young players.","Brighton & Hove Albion beat Liverpool 3-2 at the Amex Stadium.

Victor Osimhen's stellar season and family ties

Victor Osimhen's future is uncertain amid transfer speculations

Nigerian attacker Victor Osimhen celebrated his goal against Kayserispor during Galatasaray 's 3-0 win with his daughter, Hailey, amid speculation surrounding his future with the club. The victory sealed Galatasaray's 25th Turkish Super Lig title, as Osimhen scored the opener and veteran keeper Fernando Muslera netted a rare penalty.Osimhen's on-field celebration with Hailey, which brought his name to the fans' attention, underlined his tight connection with the player and the club. He has previously said that Hailey knows the Galatasaray songs better than he does, epitomising their family’s immersion into Turkish football culture.Osimhen has transformed Galatasaray since joining on loan from Napoli , netting 33 goals and contributing 7 assists in 36 appearances in all competitions. His displays have not only carried the team to domestic success but have also won over the fans with a myriad of off-the-field touches (cheering with young fans, and sharing a personal moment with his daughter).Osimhen is not only linked to Galatasaray on the field. He has expressed that how the fans treat him and how they welcome him within the team do not make him feel like a new player. Firming up these ties even further is the passion with which his daughter Hailey follows the club, riding every up and down and singing the club anthems.However, Osimhen will not be guaranteed a sure future at Galatasaray. First, he was never signed by Al-Ahli and Chelsea, and as a result, he was loaned to Galatasaray. Osimhen, who has described the city of Naples as his new home, says he will await the season’s end before opening discussions with the club regarding his future, with a focus on the club’s present success.Galatasaray is optimistic Osimhen will continue with the club due to his influence both on and off the pitch. Adding his adaptation to the club and his family’s evident contentment in Istanbul, Demirbay looks to have solid ground with which to form a long-lasting alliance. But amid other interests and his loan agreement coming to an end, it could come down to talks between Galatasaray, Napoli, and Osimhen.Also Read: 'Jumping like monkeys': Galatasaray plan criminal proceedings against Jose Mourinho for alleged racist co As the season comes to an end, attention switches to what Osimhen will do next and whether he will stand the test of time he has managed to establish as the Symbol of Galatasaray’s recent success.","Nigerian attacker Victor Osimhen celebrated his goal against Kayserispor with his daughter, Hailey, amid speculation surrounding his future with the club.

Implications for Olympiacos and Greek football

Greek titleholders Olympiacos have qualified for the 2025/26 UEFA Champions League league stage after exploiting changes to the competition qualifying system. The news comes after it was confirmed that Paris Saint-Germain and Inter Milan, finalists of the 2024/25 season, are already guaranteed spots in next season’s league stage thanks to their finishes in their respective domestic competitions.With the new format of the Champions League, should the titleholders qualify for the group stage, the berth reserved for them will be given to the national champion with the highest UEFA club coefficient ranked from 11 to 55 among the associations whose champions are placed in this position. With a coefficient of 56.500, Olympiacos was the highest-placed team to secure a spot in the league.The UEFA Champions League experienced a radical change from the 2024/25 season, as the tournament grew from 32 to 36 teams and the traditional group stage was replaced by only one league phase. Under this new format, every team plays eight games against different opponents, with the top eight advancing directly to the round of 16. The remaining teams from ninth to 24th compete in a two-legged playoff to determine who progresses to the knockout stage.One of the key components of this new concept is UEFA's club coefficient, which measures the performance of European clubs over the past five years of competitions. This coefficient could be quite significant in deciding qualification, particularly if the current holders of the Champions League earn their place in the competition on merit through domestic success. In this case, the domestic champions from associations 11th to 55th and the title holders of the 11th and 12th-ranked associations according to the access list are transferred from the qualifying phase to the play-off round.Olympiacos have secured a place in the high-voltage competition, which is a major boost for Greek football and certainly provides the club with the opportunity to take part in Europe’s biggest competition without going through some often tricky qualifying rounds. Not only does this further deepen the club’s burgeoning reputation, but it also opens up the financial windfall and greater continental exposure.And it shows the value of continued success in Europe, as based on the UEFA club coefficient. The sustained competitive results of Olympiacos over recent years have contributed to this team obtaining direct entry for this season, and have consequently established an example to others in the same associations to invest long-term in European competitions.Also Read: Pep Guardiola defends season by highlighting Community Shield victory As the Champions League continues to evolve, the emphasis on historical performance and club coefficients is reshaping the competitive landscape, offering new pathways for clubs like Olympiacos to ascend in European football.","Greek titleholders Olympiacos have qualified for the 2025/26 UEFA Champions League league stage after exploiting changes to the competition qualifying system.

Champions League qualification is now the priority for Manchester City

Kevin De Bruyne's farewell match adds emotional significance to the Bournemouth clash

Pep Guardiola, the manager of Manchester City, says that because they won the Community Shield, their season should not be called trophyless. When asked about their performance this season, Guardiola stated that the Community Shield counts as a genuine trophy. At the Monday press conference, Pep Guardiola said that it was not easy for teams to win trophies this season. According to him, “Only Newcastle United, Liverpool and Manchester City won trophies in the Carabao Cup, Premier League and Community Shield, respectively.”The Catalan coach made these comments not long after Manchester City lost the FA Cup final to Crystal Palace at Wembley Stadium, thanks to Eberechi Eze’s early goal. This happened after Manchester City were knocked out of the Champions League and Carabao Cup in the first round.The team now has to fight hard to qualify for the Champions League, as they have dropped to sixth place after two games left. The former Barcelona manager stated that they must win their last games to ensure they finish in the top five. ""We played a really good final, not enough to win it, and we have the last two games. We need four points to be in the Champions League next year, and this is enough, and everyone has to be aware of that,"" Pep Guardiola explained.Belgian midfielder Kevin De Bruyne will be playing his last match at the Etihad Stadium when Manchester City host AFC Bournemouth on Tuesday at 8:00 pm BST.Pep Guardiola stated that City has prepared a special farewell for Kevin De Bruyne, recognising his impressive achievements. “I believe Kevin will be rewarded appropriately for everything he has done and accomplished,” Guardiola said.

A domestic treble at 17 for Lamine Yamal

Worldwide recognition for Spain

Setting new records is common practice for the 17-year-old

Lamine Yamal has amazed everyone with his football skills. At only 17, the wonder kid from Barcelona is still tearing records apart and filling up his trophy collection . People were stunned by how quickly he achieved stardom. He made his debut at 15 and was Barcelona's main player within two years, demonstrating skills most players do not have until they are older. The trophies he has earned are on par with those who played for years before him.Yamal was part of Barcelona's team, which won all three domestic competitions this season. The goal he scored against Espanyol made sure they won La Liga, on top of the Copa del Rey and Spanish Super Cup they already had. The fact that he won La Liga twice before 18 means he is now in a group of just a few to achieve this.While lots of teens wish to play for their country, Yamal has achieved international victories even before turning pro. Last summer, he was a key player in Spain's Euro 2024 success and won the Young Player Award, only days after turning 17. He has been impressive whenever he plays qualification games for Spain.Setting records has become so regular for Yamal that it hardly seems surprising. He is now the proud owner of two La Liga titles, one Copa del Rey, one Spanish Super Cup, and a European Championship medal. Ronaldo's La Liga trophy count is the same as this collection, and it took him nine years to reach that point.He has a collection of personal records as well. In April 2025, Yamal won the Laureus World Breakthrough of the Year Award, and in October 2024, he received the Kopa Trophy, which names him the best young footballer worldwide.Also Read: 7 reasons why Lamine Yamal should be crowned Ballon d'Or 2025 winner The statistics prove his trophy collection.

At the moment I’m still a bit disappointed because I think we could have done better, but there was just no way to defend my position when Oli [Rowland] was in Attack Mode. I did everything right and probably we need to analyse what we could have done better, but still, second is a good result with Dan [Ticktum] in P3. It’s a very strong day for our package, which on the other side makes all of us happy.”He appeared calm and composed during the press conference as well. “We could have done things a bit differently to finish the race in first place.

They also perform on a level which is super high. For us, it’s a bit up and down. We were also unlucky in some situations. For me it’s trying to maximize every race.

First ever podium finish for Dan Ticktum

Dan Ticktum couldn’t hide his emotions after securing the first podium finish of his Formula E career, coming home third at the Tokyo E-Prix Round 9 on Sunday. The race was won by Nissan’s Oliver Rowland, who took a significant step closer to clinching the world championship title. Ticktum, driving for Cupra Kiro, was visibly elated after the race and shared a heartfelt message with his team over the radio.“Very good, gentlemen. Great job. Well done, everyone. I am so happy for you guys, I really am. Everyone doubts me, but I’m going to start proving them wrong. That’s nice. Many drivers are giving me thumbs up—how lovely. Right, I want a beer,” he said over the team radio.Sharing his feelings after the podium win, Dan Ticktum said: “It feels pretty good! I’m already like ‘if we had done this or done that’ I could have won, but I’m very happy overall and it’s a big boost for the team. I just don’t feel like we’ve ever had a breakthrough this season and that’s it. We’re really competing consistently at the top now across all conditions and the team executed a pretty flawless weekend - so I’m happy.”Talking further about the Tokyo race, he added, “There’s not a huge amount I could have done, there was quite a long time when I was forced to lead which was obviously not ideal, and then when me and Pascal [Wehrlein] went to take Attack Mode, Oli [Rowland] got in between us. I don’t know what more we could have done from our side really, just different strategies and it didn’t quite work out for P1 or P2, but ‘Driver of the Day’, I’ll take that - I thought everyone hated me!

Formula E Drivers on racing in wet conditions

The excitement is building ahead of the next Formula E race as Japan gets ready to host the second season of the Tokyo E-Prix. But the weather forecast shows a 100 percent chance of rainfall on both Saturday and Sunday. This is enough to concern the Formula E drivers, as—despite the much-improved Gen3 Evo cars this year running on Hankook tyres—racing in rain comes with hard-to-overcome challenges and risks. However, the rain may skip the Round 9 race Sunday evening. Here’s the complete weather forecast for the Tokyo Formula E race.According to Metcheck.com, the weather in Tokyo is expected to remain pleasant at 21 degrees Celsius on Friday, though it will be a cloudy day. There are only slight chances of rain as the Formula E drivers take part in the First Free Practice session at 4 pm (local time) and 12:30 pm IST.The temperature will remain in the range of 18–20 degrees Celsius on Saturday. However, there is a 100 percent chance of rain throughout the day. Rain in the range of 2.6 mm to 3.3 mm is expected during the Second Free Practice at 8 am (local time) and the Qualifying race at 10:20 am (local time). The rain is expected to be much lighter, at 0.9 mm, during the main Round 8 race at 3:05 pm (local time), which will be broadcast in India at 11:35 am.The temperature will be in the range of 19–20 degrees Celsius on Sunday, while the rain will continue to be as heavy as the day before. There is a 100 percent chance of around 3.8 mm of rain during the Third Free Practice at 8 am (local time) and the Round 9 Qualifying at 10:20 am. But the good news is that no rain is predicted for the main Round 9 race, which will start at 3:05 pm (local time) and 11:35 am IST.Mitch Evans told RacingNews365.com that it was “very, very tricky” to race in wet conditions with the Hankook tyres in the recent races. He said, “In qualifying it was like, I was terrible. Nothing, you can't wake them [the tyres] up. In the race I was way more comfortable from the start, but the pace difference between me and some other guys was huge. So yeah, you can quickly be two, three seconds a lap slower.”Also Read: Tokyo E-Prix 2025: Schedule, timing and where to watch Round 8 and Round 9 Formula E races Nyck De Vries told the portal about racing in wet conditions, ""If it's wet, you're not even reaching full throttle.

All about the Tokyo Street Circuit

The ABB FIA Formula E World Championship returns to Tokyo for Rounds 8 and 9, as the Tokyo E-Prix double header prepares to electrify the city’s street circuit with cutting-edge Gen3 Evo cars this weekend. After making its debut last year, the Tokyo race is back—poised to raise the bar even higher this season. Here's everything you need to know about the circuit set in the heart of Japan’s bustling capital.Formula E’s official X account recently shared a graphic video representation of the Tokyo Street Circuit , offering fans a clear glimpse of the track layout to be used for the upcoming races. The video highlights key features such as the Attack Mode zone, the acceleration zone, and the overtaking zone.Winner Maximilian Guenther had said after winning the Tokyo race last year, “The track is phenomenal. It’s super technical and super challenging for us and the teams to set everything up properly. To get super close to the walls, you have to have good confidence in the car, and there’s even jumps that we have in a lap, so it’s a big mixture of everything! For me that is what Formula E is all about, to race so tight around these street circuits.”Jaguar TCS Racing driver Nick Cassidy, who earned the ABB Driver of Progress Award with 12 overtakes during the race, praised the track as well. Reflecting on his experience, he said, “It was a mega, a proper Formula E track. Bumps, fast corners, on the limit and you’ve really got to attack in qualifying. I thought the track was fantastic.”Set in the heart of Tokyo Bay , the 2.575km circuit features 18 turns and boasts a compact, technical layout that includes three long straights and three chicane sequences. The strategically placed Attack Mode activation zone, located just outside Turn 4, adds a critical tactical element to the race.Also Read: Tokyo E-Prix double header: Race favourites, circuit challenges and what to expect Meanwhile, the tight Turns 1 and 2, along with the demanding Turns 10 and 11, are expected to become prime overtaking opportunities.

Carlos Alcaraz won the Italian Open on Sunday after beating rival Jannik Sinner 7-6 (7/5), 6-1 in the final and firing a warning shot for Roland Garros .Alcaraz, who will climb to world number two behind Sinner on Monday, won his third title of the season ahead of the French Open which starts next weekend. The Spaniard claimed victory in his fourth final of the season and sent a message to the rest of the men's tour for Roland Garros where he will defend the title.Sinner tops the world rankings but his 26-match winning streak was ended by Alcaraz, also the man who had last beat him in last year's China Open final.Alcaraz is the only man to beat Sinner in a tour final since the start of 2024, when his Italian rival began his rise to the top of men's tennis and three Grand Slam titles.The 22-year-old has had a hugely impressive clay court swing this season even with the thigh injury which cost him the chance to compete at the Madrid Open.Alcaraz won in Rome a second Masters 1000 title of the year to go alongside his victory at Monte Carlo last month. He also reached the final in Barcelona.Finishing runner-up is still a hugely positive result for Sinner in his first tournament since his three-month ban for testing positive twice in March last year for traces of clostebol, a contamination doping authorities accepted was accidental.His progress in Rome also sets up the possibility of another final clash with Alcaraz at Roland Garros, with the two young stars of men's tennis set to be the two top seeds in Paris.Sinner was gunning to become the first Italian man to win at the Foro Italico since Adriano Panatta back in 1976, but he failed to make it a hat-trick of triumphs for home players in the Italian capital.Earlier Jasmine Paolini became the first woman since Monica Seles in 1990 to win the Rome singles and doubles titles when she and Sara Errani beat Veronika Kudermetova and Elise Mertens 6-4, 7-5.Paolini secured that brace of victories a day after overcoming former US Open champion Coco Gauff in straight sets, and becoming the first Italian woman to win the Rome singles title since Raffaella Reggi in 1985.","Carlos Alcaraz beat Jannik Sinner 7-6 (7/5), 6-1 in the Italian Open final.

NEW DELHI: In a remarkable victory at the Italian Open on Saturday, Jasmine Paolini secured her second 1000 series championship by defeating Coco Gauff 6-4, 6-2, setting a positive tone before Roland Garros this month.The achievement marks Paolini as the first Italian woman to secure the Rome tournament since Raffaella Reggi's victory in 1985, demonstrating her superiority over former US Open champion Gauff.The packed centre court at the Foro Italico witnessed Paolini's triumph, potentially the first of three titles that could be secured by Italian players in this year's Rome tournament.At 29, Paolini has become the oldest first-time Rome champion in the Open Era. Meanwhile, Gauff, who is eight years younger, missed the opportunity to become the youngest victor since Serena Williams' achievement in 2002.Gauff's performance was hindered by 55 unforced errors and seven double faults on serve, similar to her semi-final match against Zheng Qinwen, which simplified Paolini's path to victory.Paolini could achieve additional success in the women's doubles tournament, where she and Sara Errani face Veronika Kudermetova and Elise Mertens in Sunday's final.The last woman to win both singles and doubles titles in Rome was Monica Seles in 1990, whilst Vera Zvonareva remains the sole player to accomplish this feat in a 1000 series tournament at Indian Wells in 2009.The tournament continues with Paolini's fellow Italian Jannik Sinner set to compete against Carlos Alcaraz in Sunday's men's singles final.","Jasmine Paolini defeated Coco Gauff 6-4, 6-2 in the Italian Open final. Paolini is the first Italian woman to win the Rome tournament since 1985. The 29-year- old is the oldest first-time Rome champion in the Open Era.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121239678,imgsize-116404,width-400,resizemode-4/APTOPIX-Italian-Tennis-Open.jpg"

Sinner bounces back

Jannik Sinner set up a blockbuster Italian Open final with Carlos Alcaraz by beating Tommy Paul 1-6, 6-0, 6-3 on Friday.World number one Sinner fought back from a set down in front of a packed crowd to continue his march towards a first title at the Foro Italico .After a strangely slow start, Sinner again showed good form on centre court where, since returning to action last week from a three-month doping ban, he has taken his unbeaten run to 26 matches.And the 23-year-old will face down Alcaraz, the last man to beat Sinner in the final at the China Open in early October, with all eyes on another potential final between the pair at the French Open next month.A win for Sinner against his rival would see the men's Rome title go to an Italian for the first time since Adriano Panatta in 1976.""If I want to win Sunday I have to play one of my best tennis for sure,"" said Sinner.""Carlos has played incredible tennis today, so let's see what's coming but from my side you know incredible to be here in the final.""Alcaraz booked his place in the showdown by beating Sinner's countryman Lorenzo Musetti 6-3, 7-6 (7/4).The four-time Grand Slam champion overcame Musetti and the windy conditions in just over two hours to reach his fourth final of the season.""I'm going to have dinner, but my phone is going to be there watching (Sinner's) match,"" said Alcaraz after his win.""I have to know against who I'm going to play. I have to watch the match and see how they are going to play.""Musetti was beaten by Alcaraz in the Monte Carlo final last month and fell to his fifth straight defeat to the Spaniard after a frustrating display.And he believes that Alcaraz will have the better of it against Sinner if he brings his top form on Sunday evening.""I really rate Carlos. I think on clay that the best version of Carlos is favourite against anyone... that includes Jannik,"" he told reporters.Paul rattled off the first five games in 21 minutes in a near replica of what Sinner did to Casper Ruud on Thursday, closing out the first set in less than half an hour.The last time Sinner lost a set 6-1 was in the quarter-finals of the US Open against Daniil Medvedev, a match he won on his way to his second Grand Slam triumph.Sinner looked a shadow of the player who dominated tennis throughout 2024 right up to the start of his suspension, which was agreed with the World Anti-Doping Agency in early February.But from nowhere he came roaring back in the second set, finally forcing Paul back with some deep baseline shots of his own and his first aces of the match to win the second set to love and level the match.It was a complete role reversal with Paul now the one being thrown around the court, the world number 12 winning just 12 points in the second set and looking bewildered at how quickly the momentum shifted.Paul then handed Sinner the initiative with his second double fault of the night in game two of the third set. The Italian eventually won nine games in a row and marched on to victory.Earlier, Jasmine Paolini continued her bid to win the women's singles and doubles titles in Rome after reaching her second final of the week, this time alongside fellow Italian Sara Errani .Paolini and Errani, the reigning doubles champions, will meet Veronika Kudermetova and Elise Mertens in the final on Sunday, before which Paolini could already be crowed singles champion.Late bloomer Paolini takes on Coco Gauff on Saturday aiming for her second 1000 series title at the age of 29 and to become the first Italian women to win in Rome since Raffaella Reggi in 1985.","Jannik Sinner will play Carlos Alcaraz in the Italian Open final. Sinner beat Tommy Paul 1-6, 6-0, 7-6 (7-4) to reach his fourth final of the season. Jasmine Paolini and Sara Errani will play in the women's singles final.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121226023,imgsize-36726,width-400,resizemode-4/Sinner-Rome-AP.jpg"

Gauff joins Paolini

Jannik Sinner marched into the semi-finals of the Italian Open on Thursday after destroying Casper Ruud in straight sets 6-0, 6-1 as Coco Gauff won a marathon three-set battle with China's Zheng Qinwen to advance to the women's final.American Gauff will face Italy's Jasmine Paolini in Saturday's title match after pulling through 7-6 (7/3), 4-6, 7-6 (7/4) in a match that lasted over three-and-a-half hours.Ruud was supposed to be Sinner's toughest test in Rome since he came back from his three-month doping ban, as the Norwegian came into the match in hot form on clay after winning in Madrid earlier this month.In his previous matches Sinner looked to be still finding his feet after his suspension, accepted from the World Anti-Doping Agency for testing positive for traces of clostebol in March last year.But the 23-year-old demolished sixth seed Ruud in just over an hour with an ominous display of tennis, his domination such that the home fans at the packed centre court, seemingly out of sympathy, began to cheer the rare points that Ruud won.""I was feeling great on court today. I think we all saw that,"" said Sinner.""How I felt today was very, very positive signs for me... I was serving well and also returning well. Moving great on the court, so I'm very happy about that.""Ruud even got the loudest celebration of the match when he held his serve for the only time, in game three of the second set, holding his arms aloft in ironic joy.""He was just everywhere... it's just like playing a wall that you know shoots hundred miles an hour balls at you all the time,"" said a bewildered Ruud.Tommy Paul, a 7-6 (7/4), 6-3 winner over Hubert Hurkacz in the day's first match, will have wondered what on earth he can do to stop Sinner if the Italian brings that form to Friday's last-four clash.Sinner won the first set in just 27 minutes, giving up only seven points as he stalked the court with intent, dressed all in black as he has been all week.And he then maintained his record of not dropping a set in the tournament to not so much stroll as smash into the last four, and send a message to Carlos Alcaraz.Spaniard Alcaraz, Sinner's key Grand Slam rival ahead of the French Open, will contest the other semi-final with Lorenzo Musetti on Friday afternoon, with the blockbuster final tennis fans wanted still on.Gauff prevailed on a centre court left mostly empty by fans who headed for the exits in large numbers after watching Sinner's tennis clinic.Former US Open winner Gauff won her third straight match against Olympic gold medallist Zheng, after coming through a tie in which she made 15 double faults on serve and there were a combined total of 156 unforced errors.The 21-year-old is looking for her first title of the season after losing the Madrid final to Sabalenka, and against home hope Paolini will find herself in a much fiercer atmosphere than the soporific crowd which stayed till past midnight to watch her reach her second final of the year.""I told myself I'm ready to go home,"" said an exhausted Gauff.""It was tough for me, finding my rhythm especially at night, it was so slow, I just tried to stay in there.""I was frustrated. She forced me to get out of my comfort zone.""Sixth seed Paolini is the third Italian woman to reach the Foro Italico final, and the first since her doubles partner Sara Errani was thumped by Serena Williams in 2014.Late bloomer Paolini, 29, will have a chance to be the first woman from the Mediterranean nation to win in Rome since Raffaella Reggi in 1985, after beating Peyton Stearns 7-5, 6-1.""It's a privilege to be in this position. I matured late as a tennis player but everyone has their own path. Some mature earlier and some later,"" said Paolini.""I'm just enjoying it without thinking too much about the past.""Paolini could yet win both the singles and women's doubles tournaments, with her and Errani taking on Mirra Andreeva and Diana Shnaider in the semi-finals on Friday.","Jannik Sinner thrashes Casper Ruud in straight sets 6-0, 6-1. Coco Gauff beats China's Zheng Qinwen to reach women's final. Gauff will face Italy's Jasmine Paolini in Saturday's title match. Tommy Paul beats Hubert Hurkacz in day's first match.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121200918,imgsize-24478,width-400,resizemode-4/Jannik-Sinner-Rome-AP.jpg"

Poll What do you think about Jannik Sinner's chances at the Italian Open? He will be eliminated early He will reach the finals He will win the title

Top-ranked tennis player Jannik Sinner met with Pope Leo XIV at the Vatican City on Wednesday during a break from the Italian Open , presenting the pontiff with a tennis racket and offering to play. The meeting came after the pope, known for his liking towards the sport, had earlier joked about not inviting Sinner, making a wordplay on the athlete's surname.The encounter took place in the Vatican's auditorium reception room, where Sinner arrived with his parents.""It's an honor,"" Sinner said in Italian as he presented the pope with a racket and ball, suggesting a quick volley.The 69-year-old American pope, who hails from Chicago, declined the offer to play, looking at the surrounding antiques and saying, ""Better not.""Leo XIV made a light-hearted comment about his white cassock being appropriate for Wimbledon, referencing the tournament's all-white dress code. The meeting included discussions about Sinner's progress in the Italian Open, where he faces a quarterfinal match on Thursday against Madrid champion Casper Ruud.Sinner is returning to competition after a three-month doping ban, which was determined to be due to accidental contamination.The Italian player is aiming to become the first from his country to claim the Rome title since Adriano Panatta's victory in 1976.During the interaction, Italian Tennis and Padel Federation head Angelo Binaghi presented the pope with an honorary federation card. ""We all felt the passion that Leo XIV has for our sport and this filled us with pride,"" Binaghi stated. ""We hope to embrace the Holy Father again soon, maybe on a tennis court.""The meeting included a photo session featuring the Davis Cup trophy, which Sinner helped Italy secure for the second consecutive year. The Billie Jean King Cup trophy, won by Italy in 2024, was also displayed during the meeting.Earlier in the week, Sinner had responded positively to the pope's initial joke, noting it was ""a good thing for us tennis players"" to have a pope who enjoys the sport.Beyond tennis, Pope Leo XIV is known to be a devoted Chicago White Sox baseball fan, following in the tradition of his predecessor, Pope Francis, who supported the Buenos Aires football club San Lorenzo.","Top-ranked tennis player Jannik Sinner met with Pope Leo XIV at the Vatican City on Wednesday during a break from the Italian Open.

Carlos Alcaraz made a triumphant return following his injury recovery, defeating Serbian qualifier Dusan Lajovic 6-3, 6-3 at the Italian Open on Friday.The world number three had previously pulled out of the Madrid Open, citing an upper right leg issue that impacted his performance in the Barcelona Open final, along with a left leg concern.Alcaraz competed against Lajovic whilst wearing a black support that covered his upper right leg, extending just below his knee.""The body felt great,"" Alcaraz said. ""I just moved well. I made a few good sprints today without any pain. ... It was a test for me so I think I passed the test today.""""It was a great performance, great level, which was surprising for me a little bit, but just really happy for that,"" Alcaraz added.After winning the initial four games, Alcaraz lost his serve while attempting to finish the first set at 5-2. He regained control by breaking back, showcasing his court abilities at the Foro Italico with an impressive backhand winner following a drop shot.The second set progressed similarly, with Alcaraz establishing an early advantage. He registered 24 winners and 24 unforced errors during the match.Following his Monte Carlo Masters victory in April, Alcaraz's clay court statistics this season improved to 10-1.

Bombay Sport Exchange Ep 4: Prof. Ratnakar Shetty on BCCI, cricket politics & Indian cricket's growth

Jannik Sinner will delight crowds at the Rome Open this week when the world number one makes his return to tennis, but the Italian's three-month doping ban has allowed other local rising stars to move into the limelight.Sinner was on Monday joined in the top 10 of the men's world rankings by Lorenzo Musetti , who is at number nine after reaching the Monte Carlo final and the last four in Madrid.Meanwhile Luciano Darderi and Flavio Cobolli won tournaments in Marrakesh and Bucharest in April, further underlining the strength in depth that Italian tennis has behind Sinner, a three-time Grand Slam winner.Filippo Volandri , captain of the Italy team which has won the last two editions of the Davis Cup, told AFP that ""Italian tennis is clearly in a golden age"".""But it's been a long time coming, we're seeing the fruits of work which was started some time ago,"" he added.Volandri, who has been in charge of top-level male players for the Italian Tennis Federation (FITP) for the last nine years, showed AFP a graphic which illustrates Italy's recent progress.Between 2005 and 2015 Italian players won eight ATP titles -- with seven of those in the lowest 250 category -- but since 2016 the tally of tournament wins has more than trebled to 31.Five of those 31 wins have come in top-level Master 1000 tournaments, with another three being Sinner's Grand Slam triumphs. Sinner is responsible in total for 19 of Italy's ATP wins since 2016.""Jannik is the product of a movement which had already given us Matteo Berrettini reaching the Wimbledon final (in 2021). He is the result of a system that works,"" said Volandri.Michelangelo Dell'Edera, the director of the FITP's Higher Training Institute, told AFP that the federation runs a geographically-decentralised system which was put in place at the end of the 1990s.""Every province has a coach from the federation for children between 8-10 years old, while each region has a manager in charge of players between the ages of 11 and 16,"" explained Dell'Edera.Players were for a long time obliged to move to the national training centre at Tirrenia, just up the Tuscany coast from Livorno, but that is no longer the case.""Decentralisation means making our skills available to young players and their coaches,"" said Volandri.""We're reaching out to them rather than tearing them away from their families and their lives.""Dell'Edera said the renaissance in Italian tennis has also come via a change in training philosophy and playing style.""To make a comparison with another sport, we've gone from the marathon, where players were slugging forehands and backhands, to the 100m, a sort of 'speed tennis' where the emphasis is on the serve and return, two shots which determine whether a point can be won,"" he said.Every year for the past seven years, just before the Rome Open the FITP invites its 12,000 coaches to a seminar at the picturesque Foro Italico where the major clay court tournament is played.The seminar is held to discuss training, physical preparation and tactics, with guest appearances from big foreign names in the field such as Emilio Sanchez and Brad Gilbert, who were there on Saturday.Gilbert, the former coach of tennis icon Andre Agassi, is impressed with the work being done in Italy.""They're getting to the top, they have Sinner. Sometimes you get to the top and you rest. If anything, they are spending more,"" said Gilbert.""They've made an incredible commitment and they've got a great supporting team. Sinner is the reward.""But they started this thing 10, 15 years ago and they're still producing. I just watched this kid... Federico Cina. He is special.""Cina could have the chance to show how special he is as he will play Sinner in the second round in Rome if he gets past Argentinian Mariano Navone in his opening match.","Italian tennis is in a golden age, according to captain Filippo Volandri. Jannik Sinner will return to action at the Rome Open this week after a three-month doping ban. Lorenzo Musetti and Luciano Darderi are also in the top 10 of the world rankings.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120924340,imgsize-23878,width-400,resizemode-4/Jannik-Sinner-Rome-AP.jpg"

Casper Ruud secured his first Masters 1000 title at the Madrid Open on Sunday, defeating Jack Draper in a hard-fought final that lasted two and a half hours with a score of 7-5, 3-6, 6-4. The Norwegian, who had previously been a three-time Grand Slam runner-up, finally claimed victory in his seventh major final at the Manolo Santana stadium.Draper, who will rise to fifth in the world rankings above Novak Djokovic on Monday, was unable to add to his Indian Wells triumph from March.""This was my seventh big final if you count them all, so seven is a lucky number, I guess. So it was worth the wait in the end. I've never really been too close in any of the finals when I look back -- I've lost the majority of them in straight sets,"" Ruud said.The victory marked a significant milestone for Ruud, who had previously struggled in major finals, including a loss to Djokovic in the 2022 ATP Finals.""It is a mix somewhat of a relief and happiness and just pure joy. I know, based on the last years that I've had on tour, how tough it is to do well at the biggest tournaments, and I've never been able to get over the finish line as a champion, but today I was able to,"" Ruud explained.Draper, seeking his first clay court title, acknowledged Ruud's superior performance in crucial moments.""Congratulations to Casper on this win, you really deserve it -- you were braver than me in the key moments. This sport is brutal but I will keep trying, I think this loss will make me better,"" Draper said.The match began with Draper taking an early lead, breaking Ruud's serve for a 2-1 advantage in the first set. However, Ruud fought back to level the set at 5-5 before claiming it as Draper mishit a forehand.Draper dominated the second set, making just one unforced error and successfully breaking Ruud twice to force a deciding set.The final set saw intense competition, with Ruud breaking in the fifth game and consolidating for a 4-2 lead. Despite Draper's resistance and a late surge, Ruud secured the victory on his first match point.The 26-year-old Ruud, ranked 15th, added this Masters 1000 title to his collection of 12 ATP titles at 250 and 500 level.Draper remained optimistic about his future prospects despite the loss.""I honestly feel like I'm at the start of my journey. I'm going to keep on improving and keep on pushing hard and keep these sort of tough moments in my head to keep on driving myself to be better,"" he said.","Casper Ruud beats Jack Draper 7-5, 3-6, 6-4 in Madrid Open final. It is Ruud's first Masters 1000 title. Draper will rise to fifth in the world rankings above Novak Djokovic on Monday.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120885402,imgsize-28726,width-400,resizemode-4/Casper-Ruud-Madrid-Open-AP.jpg"

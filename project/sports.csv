Champions Trophy: How good is Virat Kohli in football? | Rishabh Pant recovers from viral

DUBAI: At a time when Pakistan's cricket team has been panned left, right and centre by many of the country's former players - now experts on TV shows - and the disgruntled public, there is someone who is not willing to be as harsh on Mohammad Rizwan & Co. In an exclusive interview with TOI from London, where he currently lives, former Pakistan captain Asif Iqbal asserted that ""nothing is wrong with Pakistan cricket ,"" while pointing out that ""no one is talking about what's wrong with English cricket .""Like Pakistan, England too were knocked out of the 2025 ICC Champions Trophy , when they lost their first two matches in Group B to Australia and Afghanistan at Lahore.""Nothing is wrong with Pakistan cricket. The other teams are playing better cricket than Pakistan. Whether batting first or chasing, we lost because our opponents played better cricket than us. Why is no one talking about what’s wrong with English cricket? Batting first, they couldn’t defend 351, and batting second, they couldn’t chase down 326. I have a totally different view on this,"" Iqbal told TOI.Summing up Pakistan's six-wicket defeat to India at the Dubai International Stadium beautifully in one line, Iqbal, 82, who played 58 Tests and 10 ODIs for Pakistan between 1964 to 1980, said, ""We were outplayed in every department, except the toss!""""The reason for this hype is the expectation of the supporters of both teams that their team is better than their opponents and not realistic enough to accept that the present Indian team is on the top of rankings and we are at the bottom,"" Iqbal said.Explaining his point, Iqbal said, ""Look, I want to emphasise here that the expectations of the Indian and Pakistani fans makes an Indo-Pak contest look like the clash of the titans. The fact is that you call it a clash of the titans when, for example, in tennis, No 1 ranked player plays a No 3, or No 4 ranked player, it will be billed as the clash of the titans. However, if a superstar and all-time great like Novak Djokovic plays a 100th ranked player in the second round, he will be expected to win, and if he loses, it will be termed as a 'shock'. Likewise, if Pakistan beat India, or any other team, in an ICC event, that other team must have a very bad day. And I'm not belittling Pakistan here, but stating the reality. Pakistan has lost to a second-string South Africa and New Zealand at home recently. So, for me, it wasn't a surprise that they lost to India and New Zealand in the 2025 Champions Trophy. Ultimately, these are the players that we have. It's better to give them confidence. TV pe gaali-goj (criticising them) won't help.""While India aren’t playing a match at Sharjah, a place where Iqbal was instrumental in starting international cricket and once a famous venue for India-Pakistan matches, the Pakistan great was saddened by India refusing to travel to Pakistan to play their matches in the 2025 Champions Trophy. ""More importantly India is not playing in Pakistan in an ICC tournament. Really sad."" he said.Raving about Indian superstar Virat Kohli , who bounced back into form by scoring his 51st ODI hundred, against Pakistan at the Dubai International Stadium on Sunday night, Iqbal said, ""Yet again, Virat has shown that form is temporary, but class is permanent. The beauty about Virat is that when the stakes are higher, his concentration levels go up, and his delivery rate goes higher. It's amazing how he manages to keep doing this,"" Iqbal gushed.Impressed by how the likes of Shubman Gill and Shreyas Iyer have added muscle to India's ODI batting line-up, he said, ""India are fortunate to have the best bench strength in the cricketing world. If someone is injured or unavailable, they immediately have someone to replace him. It means a lot for the future of their game. Not many teams have this luxury.”Praising Afghanistan for their fine show in ICC tournaments, Iqbal said, ""Before the tournament began, I had said that I expected Afghanistan to beat at least one top ranked team in their group, and they've done that by beating England. They are building into a good side, one of the top teams in world cricket.""","Former Pakistan captain Asif Iqbal tells TOI that ""nothing is wrong with Pakistan cricket"" Pakistan lost to India and New Zealand in the 2025 ICC Champions Trophy. The 82-year-old believes that the hype surrounding the Indo- Pak contest makes it look like the clash of the titans. He is saddened by India refusing to travel to Pakistan to play in the tournament.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118640467,imgsize-89318,width-400,resizemode-4/118640467.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Ahead of India's crucial ICC Champions Trophy 2025 Group A clash against New Zealand on Sunday, assistant coach Ryan ten Doeschate addressed the ongoing debate surrounding the team's wicketkeeping choice between KL Rahul and Rishabh Pant . While Pant has remained on the sidelines, ten Doeschate acknowledged the tough selection calls at the highest level.""It's been very hard on Rishabh not playing, but that's the nature of sport at this level. KL's been good. He didn't get many chances, and when you're batting at six or seven, it's difficult to get proper opportunities,"" he said while speaking to reporters in Dubai.Despite limited opportunities, the former Netherlands international highlighted Rahul's contributions in crucial moments.""Obviously, in the third ODI in India, he did really well, and that knock against Bangladesh proved crucial in the end,"" he noted.With both Rahul and Pant being top-tier wicketkeepers, ten Doeschate emphasised the importance of keeping Pant ready for any situation.""We've got to keep Rishabh up and running. We never know when we're going to need him, but certainly, having two wicketkeepers of that calibre is a nice thing to have,"" he said.Meanwhile, Rahul himself admitted to feeling the pressure of having Pant waiting in the wings. While he remains focused on his own game, he acknowledged the constant temptation for the team to include Pant in the XI.""There is — I won't lie. I mean, he's obviously a very, very talented player, and he's shown all of us what he can do, and how aggressive and how quickly he can change the game. So yes, there's always the temptation for the team as well, whoever's the captain, the coach to — there's always that temptation to either play him or play me,"" Rahul admitted during a press conference on Friday.In the ongoing Champions Trophy, Rahul has embraced his role as India's designated wicketkeeper-batter. He continued his strong form in the tournament opener against Bangladesh, finishing unbeaten on 41 from 47 balls, a knock that included a four and two sixes.As India prepare for the encounter against New Zealand, the Rahul-Pant debate remains a key talking point, highlighting the depth and selection dilemmas within the squad.",KL Rahul and Rishabh Pant have been India's wicketkeepers in Champions Trophy.

Champions Trophy: How good is Virat Kohli in football? | Rishabh Pant recovers from viral

It can never be easy to compete with a special talent like Rishabh Pant . Just ask KL Rahul . Ever since the Indian team management decided to persist with Rahul as the wicketkeeper-batter of choice in ODIs — despite the return of Pant — Rahul's spot has been under scrutiny. Many former cricketers and experts have expressed their preference for Pant, including former India head coach Ravi Shastri , who earlier expressed surprise that a player of Pant's abilities was sitting out.In the process, the 32-year-old Rahul's wonderful record at the No. 5 spot in ODIs have been ignored. In India's run to the final of the 2023 ODI World Cup, Rahul stroked 452 runs in 11 matches at an average of 75.33, with one hundred and two fifties (strike rate 90.76).Speaking to reporters on Friday at the Dubai International Stadium, Rahul, who cracked a fluent 47-ball 41 not out against Bangladesh in India's opening match, admitted to feeling the pressure of competition with Pant in the ODI team.Rahul admitted there was always a temptation for the coach and the captain to play Pant ahead of him. “There is (competition with Pant), I won't lie. He's obviously a very talented player and he's shown all of us what he can do and how aggressive and how quickly he can change the game,” Rahul said.""So, there's always the temptation for the team with the captain and coach to either play him or play me. For me, if I'm given the opportunity, I try and see what I can do best. I'm not trying to compete with Rishabh or I'm not trying to play like him. When he gets his opportunities, I'm sure he's not going to try to play like anybody else. He's picked on the basis of how he can play and what he can provide for the team. The same applies to me. So, I try to do what I do best and try to stick to my game,"" Rahul said.Rahul hinted that it was unlikely Pant would get to play a single game in the Champions Trophy due to the nature of the tournament, pointing out that there was just one day's gap between India's final group game and the semifinals, which means that India are likely to stick with the same playing XI.""Luckily, I am not part of the leadership group. I don't have to make that decision. But I'm sure there will be some temptation to try out players who have not gotten a game. I don't think that will happen in the Champions Trophy, because there is just one day's break between the final group stage game and the semifinal and we've got a six-day break. We probably want all players to play the game and get a little bit of time in the middle. That is my version. I don't know, it might be very different tomorrow,"" Rahul said.Refreshingly for a player who's been playing international cricket for a decade now, Rahul takes criticism of his strike rate — it's a healthy 87.74 in ODIs — constructively. He confessed that there were times when perhaps he could have batted faster, like in the 2023 ODI World Cup final in Ahmedabad against Australia, when he crawled to a 107-ball 66 as India folded up for 240 and lost the match by six wickets. It was an innings for which the Karnataka cricketer is still trolled.""Look, it's been there for quite a few years. I'm quite used to seeing it and hearing it and reading about it. Sometimes, I just sit back and see whether the criticism is valid,"" Rahul said.Rahul allayed any fitness concerns around India captain Rohit Sharma and pacer Mohammed Shami , who both went out of the field during the last game against Pakistan. ""Fitness-wise, everything seems pretty okay. There are no real concerns about anyone missing, as far as I know. Everyone has been at the gym, everyone has been in training,"" Rahul said.",KL Rahul admits to feeling the pressure of competition with Rishabh Pant in the ODI team.

Champions Trophy: How good is Virat Kohli in football? | Rishabh Pant recovers from viral

NEW DELHI: India's assistant coach, Ryan ten Doeschate , admitted that the team did not anticipate such a heavy reliance on spin in the ongoing ICC Champions Trophy . Speaking to reporters, he acknowledged that the conditions in Dubai have favoured spin more than expected, shaping the team's approach to matches.""There are four spinners... so it could be a contest of spin. I think that coming into the competition, we weren't expecting such an over-reliance on spin, but the guys have bowled nicely, and the pitch has helped a little bit. So I'm sure it's going to be the same for the next game,"" Ryan stated.Dubai's pitches have proven to be less batter-friendly compared to Pakistan's venues, where 300-plus scores have been more frequent. Instead, a total around 270 has emerged as a competitive figure. Ryan expects this trend to continue and emphasised the need for teams to adapt.""Look, I won't say it's difficult. I think we've become used to a standard where you score 320 without thinking too much about it. So, getting to 320 has been difficult. The pitch played slightly differently, in our opinion, in those two games. But there are probably like 280-290 pitches if you bat it really well. So, in the bigger picture, it's not like playing in Pakistan, where you expect to get 320-330. But you've got to adapt yourself and get a score that's good on these wickets, and we think it's around about 280-290, judging on the first two pitches,"" he explained.Ryan, who has been part of head coach Gautam Gambhir 's setup since the start, spoke about the adjustment period within the Indian dressing room and the importance of earning players' trust.""Yeah, I think progression is probably the keyword there. You come into a new environment, and you need to earn the players' respect and the players' trust. That does take a bit of time. I think it certainly helps when you're winning as well. Players are a lot more open to listening to you and listening to new ideas. And I think it's going in the right direction now,"" he said.With experienced players in the squad, Ryan acknowledged the need for precise and well-thought-out communication from the coaching staff.""I think you've got a lot of experienced players there. So you've got to choose your words very carefully. You've got to know what you're talking about. And it's obviously got to be in their interest and the interest of Indian cricket. So it's a continual work on. You can't go there with rubbish. Like I said, I think it's working pretty well, and as a coaching group, we're getting better at it,"" he added.Batting coach Sitanshu Kotak joined Gambhir's coaching team recently. Ryan outlined the structured approach within the management and their focus on delivering a unified message.""Obviously, with Kotak coming in now, he's taking care of the batting. So, between the five of us, we're just trying to disseminate the same message. We're very clear as a team on how we want to play. It's just making sure the messaging is consistent and the players are striving towards the same thing all the time. Between the five of us,"" he said.As India progress in the tournament, the role of spin and adapting to the challenges of Dubai's surfaces will be crucial in shaping their campaign.","India's assistant coach Ryan ten Doeschate admits that the team did not anticipate such a heavy reliance on spin in the ongoing ICC Champions Trophy.

How Virat Kohli tweaked technique after Australia tour,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/icc-champions-trophy-2025/how-virat-kohli-tweaked-technique-after-australia-tour/articleshow/118615926.cms,"BACK TO BANGAR

INCREASED BACK FOOT PLAY

He (Kohli) waited for the ball to come to him. He really wasn't on the front foot all the time. He was willing to cover the infield as well. Against spin, what was good to see in the first half of his innings was that he was playing a lot off the back foot. Then once he got that confidence, he started coming forward. So, starting off the back foot and then gradually going on to the front foot was the plan. Sanjay Bangar

ALTERED BAT POSITIONING

When Kohli was in form, his bat used to come from the second or third slip area, allowing him to play more controlled shots. He is a guy who leaves no stone unturned as far as preparation is concerned. He knew that he had to step up (after the Australia tour). He brought that intensity to his game, and one could see it in his body language. Sanjay Bangar

ADJUSTMENT IN STANCE

What he did well was to watch the ball till the end, till it made contact with his bat. That's something we discussed - to watch the ball like a hawk and give more than 100% to each delivery. He is hungry for runs and going by the innings he played (against Pakistan), he can easily play for another 3-4 years in international cricket. Sanjay Bangar

A look at what the master batter has changed since his return from Australia...After Virat Kohli 's travails in Australia, he went back to a trusted aide - former India batting coach Sanjay Bangar . Bangar's time with the Indian team from 2014 to 2019 coincided with Kohli 's peak, a period in which he scored 19 of his 30 Test hundreds.In Australia, Kohli managed to score only 190 runs at 23.75 from the 5 Tests, getting out in the same fashion poking outside off-stump.Visuals showed Bangar giving throwdowns to Kohli from about 16-17 yards, pitching the ball on a cement slab. As Kohli was scoring his 51st ODI ton to power India to victory over Pakistan in the Champions Trophy , Bangar, during his commentary stint, threw more light on what transpired at the training facility in Mumbai...During his 111-ball 100 against Pakistan, it was evident Kohli was playing more on the back foot to back-of-a-length deliveries. Kohli's footwork saw significant improvement against both pacers and spinners, especially his back foot play. Playing off the back foot allowed Kohli to read spinners better and adjust shots accordingly. Once he gained confidence, he started coming forward more often, effectively mixing his approach.In Australia, Kohli's bat was coming down from closer to the wicketkeeper or first slip. Bangar and Kohli worked on ensuring that his bat came down from the second or third slip region.Kohli also slightly opened his stance, allowing for better judgment against pace and spin. This adjustment facilitated more fluid shot execution, particularly through the offside. Additionally, a marginally lower back lift helped in reducing excessive back-and-across movement, leading to more stability and control over his shots.","Virat Kohli scored his 51st ODI ton to power India to victory over Pakistan in the Champions Trophy.

The Russian Chess Federation announced on Thursday that Boris Spassky , the Soviet chess grandmaster, has passed away at 88 years old. He gained global recognition for his historic 1972 match against American Bobby Fischer during the Cold War.""The tenth world champion Boris Spassky has died at 88,"" stated the federation, describing it as a ""great loss for the country.""Spassky's legacy centres on the 1972 World Chess Championship against Fischer, a contest that reflected the political tensions between the United States and Soviet Union.After becoming world champion in 1969, Spassky faced significant pressure to uphold Soviet chess supremacy, which had persisted since 1948. Although he initially led the match, Fischer staged a remarkable recovery, defeating him and ending Soviet control of the world title.Following the match, Spassky revealed that losing brought unexpected relief, as it released him from what he termed a ""colossal responsibility.""Born in Leningrad (present-day Saint Petersburg) in 1937, Spassky displayed exceptional chess talent early, claiming the World Junior Championship and becoming the youngest grandmaster at age 18.His famous contest with Fischer has inspired numerous creative works, including books, documentaries and films. The match also influenced Walter Tevis's novel The Queen's Gambit , later adapted into a successful Netflix series in 2020.","Boris Spassky, the Soviet chess grandmaster, has passed away at 88 years old.

ICC Champions Trophy 2025: India rest & reset ahead of New Zealand clash

Pakistan's ICC Champions Trophy 2025 campaign ended in bitter disappointment as their final group stage fixture against Bangladesh in Rawalpindi was abandoned without a ball being bowled due to persistent rain on Thursday.Having already been eliminated from semi-final contention following defeats to New Zealand and India, the hosts finished at the bottom of Group A with just a single point, bringing an underwhelming end to their title defence.Reflecting on the campaign, Pakistan captain Mohammad Rizwan pointed to injuries to key players as a significant factor in their struggles, particularly the absence of Saim Ayub and Fakhar Zaman ""We wanted to do well and perform in front of our nation. The expectations were very high, but we didn't perform well, and it is disappointing for us,"" Rizwan admitted.He emphasised how Ayub's injury disrupted Pakistan's balance, stating, ""The guy who has been performing for the last few months in Australia, South Africa, Zimbabwe… the team was settled, and then suddenly when someone is injured, the team gets disturbed.""However, Rizwan refused to use the setbacks as an excuse. ""Yes, Fakhar Zaman and Saim Ayub were injured, but we will learn from this,"" he said.Ayub, who played a crucial role in Pakistan's ODI series wins in Australia and South Africa last year, was ruled out of the tournament after sustaining an ankle injury during the Proteas Test series. Meanwhile, Zaman suffered an oblique muscle strain in the opening match against New Zealand, further weakening Pakistan's top order.When asked about the strength of Pakistan's bench, Rizwan acknowledged that improvements were needed, particularly at the domestic level.""We want improvements in different areas. If we want to raise Pakistan's standards, we need awareness and professionalism. We see that in the Champions Cup, but we need more improvement,"" he remarked.With Pakistan now set to tour New Zealand for a five-match T20I and three-ODI series starting March 16, Rizwan stressed the importance of bouncing back.""We have made mistakes in the last few games. Hopefully, we can learn from them,"" he said. ""We are next going to New Zealand, and hopefully, we can perform there.

NEW DELHI: Hosts and defending champions of the ICC Champions Trophy , Pakistan, had a dismal start to their campaign, suffering a 60-run defeat against New Zealand. Their woes continued with a six-wicket loss to arch-rivals India in Dubai, effectively ending their hopes of reaching the semi-finals.Any chance of finishing the tournament on a high was also dashed when rain forced the abandonment of their final group match against Bangladesh at the Rawalpindi Cricket Ground. As a result, Pakistan finished last in the Group A standings.One of Pakistan’s key missteps in the tournament was not utilising star opener Fakhar Zaman at the top of the order.Zaman himself admitted that had he opened in their first match against New Zealand while chasing a daunting 320-run target, the outcome could have been different.During that very game in Karachi, Zaman sustained an injury and was later ruled out of the tournament due to a recurring knee issue. Imam-ul-Haq was named as his replacement.Zaman batted at No. 4, managing just 24 off 41 balls while visibly struggling, as Pakistan slumped to a 60-run loss.""Had I opened then things could have been different because when you get a big target, then the opener has a big role to play,"" Zaman said in a video posted by Pakistan Cricket Board .Zaman said he had seen a marked improvement in his injury over the week.""In the last week, I've seen a marked improvement in my healing. The doctor has said that I can start training after three weeks, so I should be back in one month.""Zaman said despite white-ball cricket being his favourite, he still wants to play the red-ball format.""I still want to play Tests but the coaches and captain have their own plans and I also feel that there are better Test players in Pakistan,"" he said, adding, ""I would like to open on my comeback but it's up to them where they want to keep me.""",Fakhar Zaman says he has seen a marked improvement in his knee injury.

Champions Trophy: Morne Morkel back as Team India practices at ICC Academy in Dubai

The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has stressed they're taking stricter security protocols at all ICC Champions Trophy 2025 venues following consecutive pitch invasions in Rawalpindi and Lahore.The first security breach happened at the Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium during the match between New Zealand and Bangladesh. A spectator ran onto the field to hug New Zealand player Rachin Ravindra. Security staff quickly apprehended the intruder, who was subsequently arrested and received a ban from all cricket stadiums.A second incident occurred at Gaddafi stadium in Lahore when a pitch invader disrupted Afghanistan's victory celebrations upon beating England on Wednesday night. While the festive atmosphere continued, this breach highlighted existing security vulnerabilities.These back-to-back pitch invasions during the tournament have placed significant pressure on the PCB. The board has now committed to enhanced security measures to protect players, officials, and spectators for the remainder of the tournament.During the incident involving Ravindra, the individual, reportedly carrying a photograph of Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan leader Saad Rizvi, managed to evade security at the Rawalpindi Cricket Ground, before being apprehended.“The PCB has taken serious note of the security breach that occurred yesterday when a spectator entered the field of play. Ensuring the safety of players and officials remains our top priority. As a responsible organisation, we have engaged with local security agencies, who have committed to increasing security personnel around the field of play at all venues and strengthening access control measures,” PCB said in a statement after the incident.“The individual involved was arrested and presented before a court of law today (Tuesday). In addition, he has been permanently banned from entering all cricket venues in Pakistan,” the statement added.“To prevent such incidents in the future, the PCB is working closely with security agencies and venue authorities to review and reinforce security protocols,” it continued.The security breach has created concerns for the PCB, with Pakistan serving as host nation for a major ICC event for the first time since the 1996 World Cup.","The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has stressed they're taking stricter security protocols at all ICC Champions Trophy 2025 venues.

Pakistan's title defence ends in disappointment



Champions Trophy: Morne Morkel back as Team India practices at ICC Academy in Dubai

Afghanistan will look to continue their fairy-tale run in the Champions Trophy as they gear up for a crucial clash against Australia in Lahore on Friday, knowing that a win would secure them a historic semi-final berth. Fresh from eliminating England with a thrilling eight-run victory, Afghanistan's confidence is soaring as they prepare to face the reigning world champions.Skipper Hashmatullah Shahidi has urged his team to stay focused, emphasising that they will not burden themselves with thoughts of qualification but instead play positive cricket. ""A win like this boosts confidence,"" said Shahidi. ""We hope to beat Australia as well.""Australia, meanwhile, remain well-placed for a semi-final spot after defeating England and having their game against South Africa washed out. Even if Friday's match is rained out, the Australians will progress, while Afghanistan will have to rely on net run rate or other results.Star batter Ibrahim Zadran will be key to Afghanistan's hopes after his record-breaking 177-run innings against England. The 23-year-old, returning from injury, played a pivotal role in posting 325/7, which ultimately proved just enough to send England packing. Marnus Labuschagne , speaking on Australia's preparations, acknowledged Afghanistan's growing reputation but remained confident that his side is ""ready to go,"" despite limited outdoor training due to rain. ""We'd love to win and silence the crowd,"" he added.While Afghanistan chase history, hosts Pakistan's campaign ended in heartbreak as their final group match against Bangladesh in Rawalpindi was washed out without a ball being bowled. Their title defence ended with a whimper, finishing last in Group A without a single win.Pakistan, who won the 2017 Champions Trophy, lost to New Zealand and India before the rain placed them at the bottom of the group points table. Captain Mohammad Rizwan admitted the team had fallen short of expectations. ""We are upset and accepting that we didn't perform well,"" he said. ""Hopefully, we will work harder and come back stronger.""For Bangladesh, who also exited the tournament, captain Najmul Hossain Shanto expressed frustration at not being able to play their final match. ""We really wanted to play this match, but we can't do anything about the weather,"" he said.India and New Zealand have already booked their semi-final spots from Group A, while South Africa, Australia and Afghanistan are vying for the remaining two spots in Group B. England have been knocked out.With Afghanistan and Australia set for a high-stakes battle in Lahore, all eyes are on whether Afghanistan can pull off another giant-killing act and cement their place in the final four.","Afghanistan face Australia in Champions Trophy semi-final on Friday.

NEW DELHI: Australia secured their place in the semifinals of the Champions Trophy after their crucial Group B clash against Afghanistan was abandoned due to rain. The match was halted when Australia were 109 for 1 in 12.5 overs, chasing a target of 274 set by Afghanistan.Despite the ground staff's efforts, the umpires declared the match abandoned after an inspection due to persistent pools of water on the pitch. The interruption occurred just an hour before the cut-off time for completing the match.With the game called off, Australia advanced to the semifinals with four points, while their previous match against South Africa in Rawalpindi was also abandoned.At the time of the interruption, Travis Head was in excellent form, having scored 59 runs off 40 balls, including nine fours and one six. He was dropped on six by Rashid Khan, but capitalised on the opportunity, dominating the Afghan bowlers.Earlier, Afghanistan posted a competitive total of 273, thanks to Sediqullah Atal 's gritty 85 and Azmatullah Omarzai 's explosive 67. Atal anchored the innings, while Omarzai's late fireworks propelled Afghanistan past 270 after they were 235 for 8 following Rashid Khan's dismissal.As it happened: Australia qualify for semis; Afghanistan mathematically alive Afghanistan's chances of progressing are slim and depend on the result of Saturday's match between South Africa and England.

NEW DELHI: Former Pakistan cricket captain Moin Khan has urged the cricket authorities to rebuild the national team following their elimination from the home Champions Trophy without winning a single game.Khan believes it's time for senior players to prove their worth in the team through performance.""I am listening to the comments of many former players nowadays but since we are already losing, why not just build a new team. What is the worst that can happen? We will lose but at least we would have done something different,"" Moin said.""Look no one is saying they are not good players but every player no matter who he is has to justify his place in the side on consistent performances.""Khan emphasized the need for support from cricket fans and former players if selectors decide to rebuild the team, even in one format.""Specially with the social media nowadays because when selectors drop a senior or not-so-senior player there is criticism on why he was dropped. When the team doesn't do well the same players are brought back and we keep on losing. So we are headed nowhere.""Khan dismissed claims about a shortage of quality cricket talent in Pakistan.""The thing is do we even try to properly and justly give exposure to new players, groom them and encourage them. Our problem is we have different policies for different players.""Why wasn't Aamer Jamal in the squad? From what I have seen he is the sort of dedicated and passionate player we need. Did we even give him a fair chance to develop as a white ball player?""Khan pointed out that selectors have brought back previously tried players whose selection faced criticism.He noted that players are often selected for one format based on their performance in another format.The former wicketkeeper-batsman, who has served as chief selector, head coach, and manager of the national team, said there is no excuse for Pakistan's early exit from the home Champions Trophy.""The players let down everyone.

NEW DELHI: As India gear up to face New Zealand in their final group-stage fixture of the ICC Champions Trophy on March 2, wicketkeeper-batter KL Rahul has dismissed any concerns regarding the fitness of skipper Rohit Sharma and pacer Mohammed Shami ""Fitness-wise, there are no concerns about anyone missing a game as far as I know,"" Rahul assured reporters during a press conference on Friday.With the semifinals fast approaching, discussions around squad rotation have surfaced.Rahul acknowledged the temptation to experiment with different players but remained uncertain about whether India would make changes. ""There are temptations to try different players before the semis, but I am not sure that will be the case.

The difference between India and Pakistan is that players like Rahul Dravid, VVS Laxman and Yuvraj Singh have all helped in developing future Indian players,"" Yograj told IANS.“I love my country which is also why I was ready to sacrifice my son, who had cancer, but they don’t hold the same passion. They compare themselves with India but don’t love their country enough to say ‘We have earned enough money’ and start training the younger generations.“Imran Khan set the platform for all of these players but they don’t have the decency to go and meet him in jail. They are the kind of people who sit and hurl abuses at their country for money.""He expressed his willingness to offer his services as a coach to the Pakistan national team, provided he receives approval from the Indian government and the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI).“We used to be together 75 years back, we were separated but love does not disappear.

Can India overcome New Zealand in the ICC Champions Trophy?

NEW DELHI: As New Zealand prepare to face India in their final group-stage match of the ICC Champions Trophy on March 2, the anticipation is high. The Kiwis have been a tricky team for many, often playing the role of a banana peel for stronger opponents. Cricket astrologer Greenstone Lobo offers an intriguing perspective on how this clash might unfold, using astrological insights to analyze the fate of both teams.Lobo points out that India has a well-balanced squad from an astrological standpoint. Many of their key players were born in the 1990s, benefiting from the exaltation of Neptune and Pluto, while others from the late 1980s bring the strength of Uranus. This balance suggests a team with resilience and depth.On the other hand, New Zealand's squad exhibits a fascinating trend—most of their players, including Will Young, Devon Conway, and captain Mitchell Santner, were born in 1991 and 1992.According to Lobo, this is significant because of the alignment of four powerful celestial bodies—Pluto, Neptune, Chiron, and Planet Z—during those years. These factors contribute to their collective strength, making them a formidable team. However, there is also a weak planetary influence, Planet X, which has historically led to near-successes followed by dramatic losses, as seen in their heartbreaking 2019 World Cup final defeat.Lobo believes India's recent setbacks, including their loss to New Zealand in key tournaments, could serve as a precursor to a strong comeback. Rohit Sharma’s horoscope suggests a period of highs following past lows, indicating that India could emerge victorious in this match.If India and New Zealand face each other twice in the tournament, Lobo predicts India may lose the first encounter but will triumph in the more crucial one.With astrological trends favoring India’s resurgence, the stars suggest that the Men in Blue have the edge in this crucial encounter. Cricket fans can expect an intense battle as destiny plays its part on the field.","Cricket astrologer Greenstone Lobo offers an intriguing perspective on how this clash might unfold.

As an American, I'm ashamed of the arrogance and disregard that we've shown one of our historically oldest, strongest and most loyal allies.""Since taking his current position, Marsch has gained significant insight into Canadian society and culture.""Canada is a strong, independent nation that is deep-rooted in decency.

They had a solid start but were fortunate to see Tottenham squander many second-half opportunities.After being sent off in the first half for his role in a disastrous Ipswich opener, Patrick Dorgu's humiliation was lessened when Harry Maguire's header gave Manchester United a hard-fought victory at Old Trafford.Maguire's header in the second half put a stop to United's three-game league losing streak and provided some respite following the club's announcement of a second round of layoffs on Monday.Even though Dorgu and goalkeeper Andre Onana made a terrible mistake that gave Jaden Philogene an early goal, Ruben Amorim managed to record just his fifth league victory as United's manager.Prior to Dorgu's night becoming worse, United had taken the lead through an own goal and an effort from Matthijs de Ligt. A VAR review later, the 20-year-old was sent out for a high challenge on Omari Hutchinson.Third-bottom Ipswich's hopes of surviving were dashed when Maguire headed in from a Bruno Fernandes corner after Philogene's cross crept in first-half stoppage time.After a 1-1 draw at Brentford, Jake O'Brien's debut goal for Everton extended their winning streak to seven league games.Brentford took the lead in first-half stoppage time thanks to Yoane Wissa's 13th goal of the season, but O'Brien tied the score in the 77th minute.",Liverpool beat Newcastle 2-0 to move 13 points clear of second-place Arsenal. Arsenal held to 0-0 draw by Nottingham Forest at the City Ground. Manchester City defeated Tottenham 1-0 in Wednesday's other match. 10-man Manchester United managed to defeat Ipswich 3-2.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118589921,imgsize-90206,width-400,resizemode-4/118589921.jpg"

At a subsequent press conference, Slot acknowledged his emotional lapse in judgement.""I should have acted differently after the game, but it's an emotional sport and sometimes individuals make wrong decisions and that's definitely what I did,"" the Dutchman stated.The altercation between Jones and Doucoure erupted when the latter celebrated before Liverpool supporters, prompting Jones's intervention and a mass confrontation.Slot's suspension applies to Wednesday's Newcastle fixture and the Southampton home match on March 8.The ban excludes European competitions, allowing Slot to direct from the technical area during Liverpool's PSG away match on March 5 and the League Cup final against Newcastle at Wembley on March 16.Liverpool currently lead the Premier League by 11 points ahead of Arsenal and are favourites to secure their 20th top-flight championship.","Liverpool head coach Arne Slot faces a two-match touchline suspension and a £70,000 fine following his conduct during the Merseyside derby.

It might have something to do with the 27-year-old's catchphrase 'responsibility' which has him turning inward.Rublev is back at the Dubai Duty Free tennis championships , where he was defaulted 12 months ago, following an animated rant at a lines judge at the fag end of the semifinals. The Russian, known as much for his mercurial temper as for his penchant for self-harm, beating himself with his racket and leaving his hands and legs bloodied, spoke about his struggles with burnout and depression.""I was completely lost. I was thinking what's the purpose of living,"" said Rublev, who has battled in the dark for a few years now. ""The thing is when it happens for a few months, you still have patience (that you can overcome), but when it goes on for years you feel you cannot take it anymore.""It's like a pain,"" he said, pointing at his arm. ""It starts to grow more and more, and you want to cut the arm.""Rublev, who fell in the first round of the Australian Open , won his 17th career title in Doha last week. ""I was taking antidepressants, but after one year of taking antidepressants, I realized that in the beginning you feel a bit better, then nothing afterwards,"" he said. ""After some time I realized that while it's not getting worse, something was weird. I didn't like that feeling so I stopped taking the medication.""With the help of his charismatic compatriot Marat Safin , a former World No. 1, Rublev started finding his way back. ""Marat made me understand myself, that was a bit of a restart from the bottom. From there, little by little, I started to move in a better direction,"" he said, adding, ""I'm not in a good or a bad place (now), but I'm not feeling any more stress, I'm not feeling anxious, I'm not having depression. I'm just neutral. Not happy, not bad, but I have found a base and that's a beginning.""The main thing is to be honest with yourself,"" the World No. 9 said. ""All of us think that we (may not be) honest with people, but with ourselves we are honest. This is a huge lie because most people are not even honest with themselves. I was the same. I (thought) I have no problem saying if I'm wrong, if I'm right, if I made a mistake.""I was lying to myself about many things. I didn't even want to understand or notice it. You need someone who can make you see yourself in an honest way.""""People put masks on, they make excuses for that, I'm doing that because someone hurt me or I don't want them to see the real me.,"" he said, ""They are already lying, running away from the problem, finding an excuse. They don't want to face themselves. The first thing is to be honest with yourself, then start to be more aware.""This search for his true self is stirred by a one-word reminder - responsibility -which Rublev writes on his shoes. Every time he looks down the word stares back at him. ""I'm putting that word there to remind myself that I'm the one, it's not because of anything or anyone. If something bad or good happens to me, it's not because of luck but because I made a mistake (or did something right). You cannot blame anything or anyone, this is a reminder to myself not to complain.""",Andrey Rublev talks about his struggles with burnout and depression.

Andreeva, the only teenager in the top-100 of the rankings, was relentless in her attitude and approach even if her tennis at times was weary.The Russian noted that confidence is easy to wear when things are going your way. ""The ball is flying, you hit a lot of winners,"" she said. ""The hardest part is to be positive, to be there (in the moment) 100 per cent mentally, when things are not going your way.""For much of her near two-hours on court against the in-form Tauson, the Russian tried but couldn't produce the tennis that saw her put out three Grand Slam champions - Marketa Vondrousova, Iga Swiatek and Elena Rybakina - in a week. ""I told myself, you can either let that negativity come into your head or you can choose to fight for every point,"" Andreeva said. ""I've been listening to a lot of LeBron James interviews. He said it's easy to be confident and to play good when everything goes your way. What makes you a champion is when you're giving your best when you don't feel great. That's what I tried to do in the final.""Andreeva's goal for the 2025 season was to break into the top-10, now that she has debuted in the top tier at No.9 this week, the teenager promptly raised the bar.""The higher your ranking is, the slower the climb (becomes) because the difference in the points is very little,"" she said. ""If I win another tournament, I'm going to be top-eight maybe. If I win another tournament, I can still be top eight. It's going to be hard to enter the Top-five. That is the goal I'm going to set for myself, to be Top-five by the end of the year.""When asked what she'd do with this week's earnings of $597,000, Andreeva shrugged. She felt she had everything she needed.""I don't know what I want, I feel like I have everything. I won the tournament. I've already reached the goal that I had set for myself for the end of the year,"" she said, adding, ""My family is traveling with me. I have a great team. I feel happy, and this is all I need.""A couple of minutes later she was asked if she likes to shop, Andreeva's face mirrored a light bulb.""Yes, of course I like shopping, it doesn't matter what I buy, just as long as I buy something, I already feel good. It can be jewelry, a pair of jeans, socks, cap… As long as I buy something, I feel like the day is successful,"" Andreeva said, noting that her father Alexander doesn't like to shop. ""I like to buy something, even something from the grocery store.""It's easy to forget Andreeva's age when she's on the tennis court, serving big and painting the lines with her groundstrokes.

I'm expecting a battle,"" he said.De Minaur, who took Carlos Alcaraz the distance in the final at Rotterdam in early Feb, likes how he has started the year.""I'm happy, I have played some great tennis. I've lost to Jannik (Sinner), to Carlos (Alcaraz) and now I lost to Andrey (Rublev in Doha last week) after having a match point, the last one stings a little bit because I feel like I had my chances. It's all about putting myself in those situations, giving myself the opportunity.""De Minaur said, ""People are hitting the ball with a lot more force (today). You're losing a little bit of that variety that you had with the likes of Roger (Federer).

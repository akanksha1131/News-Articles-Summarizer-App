Rohit Sharma press conference: On Ashwin, Gabba draw and his form

Scenario 1: Series Ends 2-2

Australia must lose their series against Sri Lanka by at least a 1-0 margin.

Alternatively, South Africa must suffer a 2-0 defeat in their series against Pakistan.

Scenario 2: Series Ends 1-1

South Africa must lose both matches of their series against Pakistan (2-0).

Or, Australia must either lose 1-0 to Sri Lanka or draw their series 0-0.

In the event of a 0-0 draw between Australia and Sri Lanka, India would be tied with Australia at 53.51% but would edge ahead due to having more series wins in the WTC cycle (three versus two).

However, a 2-0 win for Sri Lanka over Australia would eliminate India from contention as Sri Lanka’s PCT would surpass India’s.

NEW DELHI: The India-Australia Test series stands at a tense crossroads following the rain-affected draw in the third Test in Brisbane.With the five-match series level at 1-1, the remaining games in Melbourne and Sydney will be decisive, not just for the series outcome but also for the World Test Championship (WTC) Final qualification scenarios.If the series ends in a 2-2 draw, India will conclude the WTC cycle with a percentage points tally (PCT) of 55.26%. To qualify for the WTC Final under this scenario, India would rely on other results:A 1-1 draw in the India-Australia series will reduce India's PCT to 53.51%, making qualification trickier. Under this outcome:India’s performance in the remaining Tests will play a pivotal role, but qualification hinges heavily on external results.Consistency in batting and bowling, especially addressing middle-order collapses and over-reliance on Jasprit Bumrah, is crucial.Meanwhile, favourable weather and conditions during other teams’ fixtures could also shape the race to the WTC Final.","The India-Australia Test series stands at a tense crossroads following the rain- affected draw in Brisbane.

"Gukesh's 'a lot left to achieve' attitude is absolutely terrific, says Anand",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/chess/gukeshs-a-lot-left-to-achieve-attitude-is-absolutely-terrific-says-anand/articleshow/116487349.cms,"Five-Time World Champ Is Now Hoping For An All-Indian WCC Final In The Next Cycle

CHENNAI: Heavy is the head that wears the crown, and for D Gukesh , maintaining his position as the World Chess Champion will be as difficult as reaching it. At just 18, Gukesh has already proven his extraordinary talent, but the journey now shifts to sustaining that success in the years ahead.Gukesh ascended the throne in Singapore last week, and the entire world paused to celebrate the young prodigy. Yet, amidst the roaring applause, his statement was startlingly humble. ""Becoming the world champion does not mean I am the best player."" It was a declaration that revealed maturity beyond his years and an insatiable hunger to grow. Viswanathan Anand , who knows all about becoming the world champion and retaining the crown time and time again, is extremely impressed with the way Gukesh has maintained his composure. ""His journey to the world title has been so fast that he missed a lot of the other titles. He hasn't had a chance to play enough tournaments yet, or he's played one edition at most. In a way, he's saying, 'I've got a lot left to accomplish.' And it's a fantastic attitude to have,"" Anand told TOI during an interaction organised by the WestBridge Anand Chess Academy, who have been sponsoring Gukesh.Anand won his first world title in 2000 and then had to wait six years to win it back again. Then for seven years when he stayed the world champion, the pressure was immense with Vladimir Kramnik, Veselin Topalov and Boris Gelfand making things incredibly difficult for him between 2008 and 12. But as Gukesh embarks on his own path, Anand sees a different script for him.""I think for Gukesh, it is so early that he will not face those problems - lack of inspiration or motivation. His challenges are more likely to be how to win the rapid championship; he's going to start ticking off a list. He seems like someone who, once he sets a goal, is very focused and willing to do whatever it takes.""However, Gukesh is not the only one from India in the quest for chess supremacy. He faces a growing wave of competition, with friends-cum-rivals like R Praggnanandhaa and Arjun Erigaisi determined to carve their names in the history of the game. The trio represents a new generation of Indian talent, pushing each other to new heights as they chase the ultimate goal.The prospect of multiple Indian contenders in the World Chess Championship (WCC) is becoming more and more plausible. In fact, the idea of two Indians battling for the crown in 2026 is not just a dream - it's a tangible goal. ""If we have two Indians playing at the WCC - WOW! What a journey, what a moment that will be. That would be the dream. It's a very difficult road, but India could easily have multiple candidates now,"" said Anand.Such a moment would redefine the chess landscape in India. And Anand will be the happiest after he had shown the way all those years ago.","D Gukesh, 18, is the new World Chess Champion. Viswanathan Anand hopes for an all-Indian final in 2026.

Hayley Matthews , the captain of the West Indies, acknowledged that their bowling lacked discipline on a challenging wicket.""We probably did not bowl as well as we wanted to.

R Ashwin announces retirement from Test cricket

Rohit Sharma press conference: On Ashwin, Gabba draw and his form

India skipper Rohit Sharma on Wednesday provided a key update on premium pacer Mohammed Shami ’s availability for the remaining two Tests against Australia.With two crucial matches remaining in the series, Shami's inclusion will surely strengthen India’s chances of clinching the series against the formidable Aussies.Speaking at a press conference after the drawn Gabba Test in Brisbane, Rohit categorically stated that it's high time someone from National Cricket Academy (NCA), where the ace pacer is undergoing rehabilitation after ankle surgery in November 2023, should talk about it as they are the ones who will give Shami green signal for the international cricket.""I think it's high time somebody from NCA talked about him. That's our national cricket academy where he is rehabbing. Those guys are the ones who need to come up and give us some kind of update. But look, I understand he's playing a lot of cricket back home, but there have been some complaints about his knee as well,"" Rohit said in the post-match press meet.""The last thing you want is the player coming here and then pulling out in the middle of the game. You know what happens when that kind of thing happens,"" Rohit quipped, referring to the disruption caused by mid-series injuries.Shami has been away from international cricket since participating in India's ODI World Cup Final in November 2023. His path back to competitive cricket has involved playing domestic tournaments.Following his surgery and comprehensive rehabilitation, the seasoned fast bowler resumed playing through the Ranji Trophy, and later delivered strong performances in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy.The Indian cricket team's management remains cautious about Shami's return, insisting on definitive clearance from the NCA. Rohit emphasised that the team would only consider including him in the squad after receiving complete assurance regarding his fitness from the academy.""There's no way we want to take that chance unless we are like, not a hundred percent, 200 hundred percent sure. We're not going to take any risk. But yeah, like I said in the last press conference, the door is open.

NAVI MUMBAI: When it mattered, the India women’s team came to the party.Thoroughly entertaining a massive, record crowd of 47, 204 at the DY Patil Stadium here on Thursday night in the series decider against the West Indies by putting on a clinical show with the bat and ball and lager taking a 'winning lap' around the ground, India coasted to a morale-boosting 60-run win in the third and final T20I. Reeling after the 3-0 thrashing at the hands of the Aussies in the away ODI series earlier this month, the hosts now go into the ODI series in Baroda from Dec 22 having downed the 2024 Women’s T20 World Cup semifinals 2-1 in the T20I leg.Using her bat like a sledgehammer, dashing ‘keeper-batter Richa Ghosh equalled the record for the quickest half-century (54, 21b, 3x4, 5x6), while stand-in-captain Smriti Mandhana slammed her third consecutive fifty (77, 47b, 13x4, 1x6), breaking the record for scoring the most T20I runs in a calendar year, as India plundered their way to 217 for four in 20 overs after being asked to take first strike.It is India’s highest-ever total in this format. There were also useful contributions by Jemimah Rodrigues (39, 28b, 4x4), who added 98 in 55 balls for the second wicket with Mandhana, and young batter Raghvi Bist (31 not out, 22b, 2x4, 1x6), who was impressive while playing just her second international game.After bulldozing West Indies with the bat, the Indian women’s team fielded like tigresses and bowled superbly, as West Indies crumbled with the bat and were restricted to 157 for nine in 20 overs, with only Chinelle Henry (43, 16b, 3x4, 4x6) putting up some fight.Much to India’s delight, the visitors lost skipper Hayley Matthews (22), who had blasted 85 not out off 47 balls to fashion West Indies’ win in the last match, in the eight over, when she was caught by Sajeevan Sajana at long-off off Radha Yadav.It was a brilliant comeback by India after they were mauled by nine wickets by the visitors in the second T20I at the same venue on Tuesday. With Ghosh and Mandhana, who cracked seven boundaries in a row in the first four overs, going beserk, West Indies’ veteran seamer Deandra Dotti, who had taken 2-14 in four over in the last match, ended up conceding 54 in four overs on Thursday night. In the fourth over, Mandhana took 20 off Dottin-three fours and a superbly-timed six over wide long-off.Off-spinner Karishma Ramharack, another impressive bowler for the Caribbeans, went for 44-0 in three overs.Looking like she was out to have a party at the expense of the clueless-looking West Indies bowlers the moment she walked in to bat in the 15th over, Ghosh, who is amongst the most dangerous finishers, teed off from the first ball she faced, pumping a six over long -off to Deandra Dottin. The 21-year-old then sliced the next ball for a four, and then in the next over, lofted Aaliyah Alleyne to the cow corner.In a murderous mood, she pulled Alleyne for a six to deep square leg, and then thumped West Indies captain Hayley Matthews for back-to-back sixes in the 19th over-a slog sweep while going down on one knee followed by a pull off a long hop to deep square leg. With the crowd chanting ‘Richa, Richa’ as she kept producing one big blow after another, a fired-up Ghosh reached her fifty – now the fastest along with New Zealand's Sophie Devine and Australia's Phoebe Litchfield - by clubbing an Alleyne delivery for a six in the final over.Has any Indian batter, or any batter in world cricket, been in more smashing form than Mandhana has been in 2024 in white-ball cricket in the women’s game? The classy left-hander is now the top run-getter in T20Is this year, with 763 runs under her belt in 23 matches @42.38, with eight fifties. No one has scored more runs in T20Is in 2024. She has stroked 100 fours this year-again a record. Apart from all this, the ultra-consistent left-hander has hit four hundreds this year-the most by anybody.Coming off scores of 54 off 33 balls & 62 off 41 balls in the first two T20Is, Mandhana, raining boundaries on both sides of the wicket, set up the base from which Ghosh launched India’s total past 200. India suffered an early blow when opener Uma Chetry was out for a duck in the first over.","India beat West Indies by 60 runs in third and final T20I in Mumbai.

NEW DELHI: Indian Premier League (IPL) chairman Arun Dhumal on Thursday backed International Cricket Council's decision to hold India-Pakistan matches at neutral venues during ICC events until 2027, calling it a move that benefits 'all stakeholders — both cricket boards and broadcasters'.The ICC Board announced that matches between the arch-rivals in upcoming ICC tournaments, including the 2025 Champions Trophy, will be played at neutral venues.""It is good that we got some clarity on the Champions Trophy, and also the future ICC tournaments.

NEW DELHI: Sediqullah Atal 's maiden one-day international century propelled Afghanistan to a resounding 232-run victory, their biggest-ever One-Day International (ODI) win, over Zimbabwe in the first match of the three-match ODI series in Harare on Thursday.Atal (104) and Abdul Malik (84) forged a formidable opening partnership of 191 runs, laying a solid foundation for Afghanistan's imposing total of 286/6 from their allotted 50 overs. Captain Hashmatullah Shahidi 's unbeaten 29 provided a late flourish to the innings.Zimbabwe's response was dismal from the outset, with Ben Curran's run-out on the final ball of the first over setting the tone for a disastrous batting performance.Only Sikandar Raza (19 not out) and Sean Williams (16) managed to reach double figures as the home team was bundled out for a paltry 54 in 17.5 overs.The Afghan bowlers, led by Allah Ghazanfar (3/9), Naveed Zadran (3/13), and Fazalhaq Farooqi (2/15), were relentless in their pursuit of wickets.Atal, a 23-year-old debutant last month, expressed his delight at his maiden century and the team's comprehensive victory.Malik and Atal's partnership laid the foundation for Afghanistan's commanding total, with both batsmen complementing each other effectively. Shahidi praised the openers' efforts and emphasized the team's all-round dominance in all departments.The match highlighted Zimbabwe's ongoing struggles in the 50-over format, with their total of 54 ranking among the lowest ODI scores in history.The team shares the unwanted record of the lowest ODI score of 35 with the United States, a mark they achieved against Sri Lanka in Harare in 2004.Zimbabwe's totals of 38 (against Sri Lanka in Colombo) and 44 (against Bangladesh in Chattogram) are also among the seven lowest ODI scores ever recorded.",Afghanistan beat Zimbabwe by 232 runs in first match of three-match ODI series.

NEW DELHI: With a whopping 21 wickets in three Tests, pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah has been the centre of attention in the ongoing Border-Gavaskar Trophy Down Under.Bumrah, the leading wicket-taker in the series, is way ahead of other bowlers has been a serious headache for the hosts.The 31-year-old so far has two five-wicket hauls -- in Perth and Brisbane -- and has been a thorn in the flesh especially of Australia openers Usman Khawaja and Nathan McSweeney -- dismissing them four times each.Former Australia head coach Justin Langer on Thursday heaped rich praise on Bumrah, calling him a right-handed version of legendary Pakistan pacer Wasim Akram “I would hate to face him. He is like Wasim Akram. For me, he is a right-hand version of Wasim Akram, and every time I am asked the question ‘Who is the best bowler you have ever faced’, I say Wasim Akram.“They have got good pace and the great bowlers just hit the same spot every time, and they have got a good bouncer, so it makes them a bloody nightmare. He has got the ability to swing the ball both ways, his seam is literally picture perfect.“If you present a perfect seam and it comes perfectly out of the fingers as it does with him, you get the double whammy, swing in the right conditions and if it hits the rope it can go either way. That’s what Akram used to do and was a nightmare to face,” said Langer to The Nightly.“I would hate to face Bumrah. He’s a great competitor, he bowls good pace and he’s just awesome. I said at the start of the series, if Bumrah stays fit, it is going to be a really tough summer for the Australian batters, if he doesn’t, then I think Australia will win the series easily, and I still maintain that,” he added.Langer also expressed surprise on sudden retirement of veteran India spinner Ravichandran Ashwin after the third Test in Brisbane.“I was surprised Ashwin retired because I thought they would use him and (Ravindra) Jadeja — go to their big guns for maybe Melbourne and definitely Sydney. I think Melbourne and Sydney are as likely to suit India as the other two venues,” he added.After three matches, the series is currently tied at 1-1.The fourth BGT Test begins from December 26 in Melbourne.",Jasprit Bumrah has taken 21 wickets in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy Down Under.

Paul Pogba's brother found guilty in kidnapping and extortion plot,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/paul-pogbas-brother-found-guilty-in-kidnapping-and-extortion-plot/articleshow/116480197.cms,"Paul Pogba and his brother Mathias (Getty Images)

Paul Pogba’s Recent Struggles

Mathias Pogba , the brother of World Cup-winning midfielder Paul Pogba , was sentenced by a Paris criminal court on Thursday to three years in prison, with two years suspended, for his involvement in an extortion and kidnapping case.Having already spent time in custody, Mathias will serve the remainder of his sentence under house arrest with electronic monitoring. The ruling aligns with the prosecution’s request, but Mathias’ lawyer has announced plans to appeal.The trial stemmed from allegations that Mathias and five others attempted to extort Paul Pogba in 2022.The group reportedly demanded €13 million ($13.6 million) from the French midfielder and allegedly held him at gunpoint in March 2022.Roushdane K., identified as the mastermind behind the blackmail, was sentenced to eight years in prison. Other accomplices also received jail terms.Mathias Pogba had faced charges of attempted extortion and criminal conspiracy.Paul Pogba, who did not attend the trial, revealed during the investigation that he had paid €100,000 ($104,000) to the group, which included his brother.The court determined that Pogba suffered financial losses of €197,000 ($204,000) and moral damages of €50,000 ($52,000).It ordered all defendants, except Mathias, to jointly compensate the footballer.The case gained public attention after Mathias posted social media threats to reveal 'explosive' information about his brother, fellow French star Kylian Mbappé, and agent Rafaela Pimenta.Once regarded as one of the world’s best midfielders, Paul Pogba has faced numerous challenges off the field. Earlier this month, Juventus announced the mutual termination of his contract, a decision influenced by his doping ban.Pogba tested positive for testosterone in August 2023 and was initially handed a four-year suspension. However, the ban was reduced to 18 months by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), which cited the unintentional use of a doctor-prescribed supplement. Pogba will be eligible to resume his career in March 2025.A former record-breaking transfer, Pogba joined Manchester United in 2016 for €105 million ($116 million) but returned to Juventus in 2022 as a free agent.Injuries limited him to just eight Serie A appearances before his doping case emerged.The 30-year-old’s career highlights include playing a pivotal role in France’s 2018 World Cup triumph. Despite his recent setbacks, Pogba could make a comeback in professional football after his suspension ends.","Mathias Pogba sentenced to three years in prison, with two years suspended.

NEW DELHI: British billionaire businessman and chairman of chemicals company INEOS , Jim Ratcliffe , has increased his stake in Manchester United to nearly 29 percent after completing the cash injection he promised when purchasing a minority share of the Premier League club.Last year, it was announced that Ratcliffe had agreed to buy a 25 percent stake in the club, including investing an additional $300 million (£238 million) into infrastructure on top of his $1.3 billion purchase price.The deal was ratified in February, and the US Securities and Exchange Commission has confirmed that the final $100 million (£79.3 million) was paid on Wednesday.The SEC filing also revealed that all of Ratcliffe's shares in United are being transferred to INEOS from Trawlers Ltd, which initially bought the stake from the US-based Glazer family , who remain the club's majority owners.With INEOS now in charge of United's football operations , Ratcliffe has made what he calls ""difficult and unpopular decisions"" since becoming co-owner.Around 250 members of staff have left, while former United manager Alex Ferguson is being stripped of his ambassadorial role at the club.Additionally, the mid-season decision to increase prices of remaining home tickets to £66 ($83) per match, without any concessions for children or pensioners, sparked anger and protests among United fans.Ratcliffe, 72, recently stated that the club ""needs to sweat every pound"" if they are to return to former glories, with the team currently looking to climb from 13th place in the Premier League table under newly-appointed manager Ruben Amorim .""To get Manchester United to where we need to get it -- it's a bit like the country (Britain) -- we have to make some difficult and unpopular decisions,"" said Ratcliffe.

Jesus hat-trick

London: Liverpool moved into the League Cup semi-finals as the holders won 2-1 against managerless Southampton , while Gabriel Jesus ended his goal drought with a hat-trick in Arsenal 's 3-2 victory over Crystal Palace on Wednesday.Rare goals from Darwin Nunez and Harvey Elliott at St Mary's sent the 10-time League Cup winners into the last four for a record 20th time.Held to a surprise 2-2 draw against Fulham in the Premier League last weekend, Liverpool got back on track with a 20th win from 24 games in all competitions under Arne Slot, who has lost just once since arriving from Feyenoord to replace Jurgen Klopp.Slot, who watched the quarter-final from the stands while he served a touchline suspension, opted to rest Mohamed Salah and Virgil van Dijk as the Premier League leaders made eight changes.Liverpool's understudies were too strong for Southampton and Nunez ended his poor recent form with a clinical finish after Jan Bednarek made a hash of clearing Trent Alexander-Arnold's pass in the 24th minute.It was only Nunez's fourth goal in all competitions in a difficult season for the Uruguay striker, who had gone six games without scoring.Elliott doubled Liverpool's lead in the 32nd minute, drilling low past Alex McCarthy from 12 yards for his first goal this season.Cameron Archer reduced the deficit in the 59th minute with a superb curling strike from just inside the area.Southampton were furious when a late Jarell Quansah challenge on Mateus Fernandes didn't result in a penalty.But there was no escaping yet another defeat for Southampton in caretaker boss Simon Rusk's first game after Russell Martin was sacked following Sunday's 5-0 thrashing by Tottenham .""It was a very good and important win. We saw a lot of players that maybe don't start,"" Slot said.""We handled it really well and only conceded one or two chances. We have to defend the trophy because the club won it last season.""At the Emirates Stadium, Brazilian striker Jesus finally found the back of the net on home turf for the first time in 2024.Jesus' only previous goal in 20 appearances in all competitions this season had come against second-tier Preston in the League Cup.The 27-year-old's first goals in nine games were well-timed after Arsenal were booed off following Saturday's 0-0 draw against Everton in the Premier League.The Gunners, who last won the League Cup in 1993, are six points behind Liverpool and Mikel Arteta made eight changes as he prioritised Arsenal's rematch with Palace in the top flight on Saturday.Arteta's gamble paid off after an early shock when Jean-Philippe Mateta punished weak defending from Jakub Kiwior to put Palace ahead in the fourth minute.But Jesus equalised with a composed chipped finish in the 54th minute before lashing Arsenal in front after narrowly beating the offside trap in the 73rd minute.Jesus sealed his treble with another clinical effort in the 81st minute and former Arsenal striker Eddie Nketiah's header four minutes later came too late to save Palace.""Sometimes I have this problem with a lack of goals,"" Jesus said.

'Anxious' Ancelotti makes more history

Doha: Kylian Mbappe and Vinicius Junior both scored as Real Madrid cruised to a 3-0 victory over Mexican side Pachuca in the Intercontinental Cup final in Doha on Wednesday.Mbappe opened the scoring in the 37th minute before Rodrygo doubled Madrid's lead early in the second half. Vinicius sealed a comfortable win for the Spanish and European champions with a late penalty.France striker Mbappe returned to the Madrid line-up in Doha after missing Saturday's 3-3 draw with Rayo Vallecano due to a hamstring injury suffered in the Champions League win at Atalanta last week.Mbappe swept in from close range to break the deadlock after brilliant play from Vinicius Junior, who won the FIFA Best men's player of the year award a day earlier after missing out on the Ballon d'Or Former West Brom and Newcastle forward Salomon Rondon led the attack for CONCACAF Champions Cup winners Pachuca, but they never truly looked capable of an upset and Rodrygo's fine curling strike from the edge of the area put Madrid in total control.It was allowed to stand after the referee consulted the pitchside monitor even though Jude Bellingham was in an offside position and appeared to be interfering with the goalkeeper's line of vision.Vinicius added a third from the penalty spot six minutes from time following another VAR review after Lucas Vazquez was chopped down in the Pachuca box.""We knew that after a long trip and playing just one game it's hard. We struggled at the beginning, but we adapted well,"" Madrid midfielder Fede Valverde told Spanish television channel Telecinco.It is Madrid's second title of the season following their UEFA Super Cup triumph over Atalanta in August, a welcome boost after what coach Carlo Ancelotti admitted had been a difficult period.""In this part of the season I was a bit anxious because I didn't like the team, honestly, but this will change in 2025 I'm sure,"" said Ancelotti.""It's important for us to get to Christmas alive. If we think about the team after the defeat by Milan (in the Champions League on November 5), I think we've grown a lot and that gives us confidence for 2025.""Ancelotti won his 15th trophy as Madrid coach, moving him past Miguel Munoz for the most in the club's history.""It's a nice moment.

Novak Djokovic will run out of energy: Andre Agassi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/novak-djokovic-will-run-out-of-energy-andre-agassi/articleshow/116235405.cms,"American legend

Andre Agassi

believes Djokovic will miss Federer & Nadal, the guys he came to the dance with

Excerpts:

Djokovic's longevity:

Andy Murray coaching Djokovic:

Carlos Alcaraz

and longevity…

American men haven't had results like the women:

Graf was the hardest victory I ever had: Agassi

BENGALURU: Andre Agassi wondered if the 24-time major winner Novak Djokovic would miss his greatest rivals -- the now-retired Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer -- in the last leg of a glittering career where the 37-year-old goes for more history.The eight-time Grand Slam champion, in the city for the TiE Global Summit, assessed Djokovic's run and the Serb's recent partnership with friend and rival Andy Murray in a candid chat with media.It's hard to say, Father Time always wins. He has already done so much for so long, it's hard to imagine longer. We said that about (Roger) Federer too. I think Novak will run out of energy more than capability. Cannot be easy, especially when the people you came to the dance with have left, that's a big thing.When Pete (Sampras) retired it was a blow to me, it set me back a little bit. It made me rediscover my inspirations on some level. Djokovic has lost the guys he made history with. It'll probably get tougher and tougher emotionally, but I would never bet against them. Bet against them at your peril.In any coach-student relationship you need trust and trust can take time, but it's nice when it starts with believing in somebody because you know that they know your experience. There's an asset to their history as competitors.Any success of a relationship is based on complete buy-in and that's always the part you have to wait and see. It's not what I know that changes your career, information doesn't lead to transformation, somebody has to counter that. That's the connector. I'm sure there's going to be a lot of trust immediately, we'll see how the results go.Alcaraz defends like Novak, has more power and spin like Nadal, hands and finesse like Federer but just because he has the best of all the three doesn't mean he can do what they did. There are so many parts to the game such as decision-making, injuries, luck. So how long can (Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner) do it (for)? They could do it for 20 years or not.The women's game hasn't had to deal with Roger Federer, Novak Djokovic, Rafael, Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz, but they have their version of it. Serena Williams is the Novak of the women's game and you got Coco as a potential, like Alcaraz has potential and Sinner has potential.How the game evolves is interesting. The women's game has gotten very powerful, just straight power. For lack of a better example, Lindsay Davenport was powerful, tall, precise through the court and now you have a lot of that. There's still room for somebody who can offset that kind of power, like an Ash Barty.The men's game has changed in the sense that guys have gotten bigger with longer levers, which means they're better athletes, they can move and they need more time, they start playing further back. Soon you're going to start seeing the net game start coming back, everything morphs in its own way. But the biggest issue for American (men) not winning is an unfortunate set of decades where the guys were very stingy and very greedy -- 66 Grand Slams in the same generation. There's not a lot left there (for others)!Andre Agassi - the second of five men to achieve a career Grand Slam in the Open Era and the first man to complete a career golden slam - has won it all, including a stirring love match.""She was the hardest victory I ever had,"" said Agassi of his wife German tennis legend Steffi Graf, a 22-time major winner.Agassi, who has won eight major titles and the Olympic gold, speaking during a session at the TiE Global Summit, said, ""We all live a hero's journey - first part of life is about performing and achieving. Then life hits us with broken relationships and dreams. I went through it all. Finally, in the last phase of the journey, it's about serving others.""The 54-year-old said, ""At 28 my (tennis) career started over. Without the struggles, I would've never gotten Steffi to say yes. I tried to get her for years.""On a lighter note, Agassi said he likes to keep his trophies out of the house. ""I don't bring my trophies home, because if I bring my trophies home, then she brings her trophies home - and that's bad math!""",Andre Agassi believes Novak Djokovic will run out of energy more than capability.

NEW DELHI: Legendary player Andre Agassi observed that Carlos Alcaraz embodies distinct qualities from Novak Djokovic Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal , while advising the tennis world against anticipating the young Spaniard to match the extraordinary achievements of these tennis legends.The collective Grand Slam victories of Federer, Nadal and Djokovic stand at 66, whilst Alcaraz, aged 21, has secured four major titles thus far.""I'm not a genius and I don't have a crystal ball. What I can tell you is Alcaraz defends like Novak, has power and spin like Nadal and has hands and finesse like Federer,"" said Agassi during a talk session in Bengaluru.The eight-time Grand Slam victor Agassi elaborated on why excessive expectations shouldn't burden Alcaraz.""Just because he has the best of all those three doesn't mean he can do what they did because there're so many other parts to the game, which mean decision-making, injuries, you know, luck,"" he said.With Djokovic at 37, approaching retirement, Agassi noted that the Serbian's competitive edge might diminish without Nadal and Federer in the arena.""He's already done so much, so long, and it's hard to imagine longer. I think he'll run out of the energy for it more than the capability of it, I would imagine.""It cannot be easy, especially when the people you came to the dance with have left.""The American provided additional context to his assessment.""When Pete (Sampras) retired, it was a blow to me. It set me back a little bit. It made me have to rediscover my inspirations on some level.""And he's (Djokovic) lost the guys that he's made history with. So, it's probably emotionally going to get tougher and tougher quickly, but I would never bet against him. Bet against him at your own peril,"" said Agassi.Regarding Djokovic's recent appointment of Andy Murray as coach to extend his career, Agassi expressed interest in their partnership's development.""They've been fierce rivals on court, and now Murray will be coaching Djokovic. Well, in any coaching student relationship, you need trust. Trust can take time.""I think there's an asset to their history as competitors, but any success of a relationship is based on complete buy-in.""",Andre Agassi says Carlos Alcaraz embodies distinct qualities from Novak Djokovic Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal.

NEW DELHI: Tennis icon Andre Agassi on Tuesday highlighted how sports should remain integral to education, noting their role in teaching children to cope with defeat.At a Bengaluru event focussed on sports and education's role in fostering excellence, Agassi shared his insights.""Even when you have a failure, you have to get up and play again the next day. So, what sports is teaching you is that focusing on winning and losing is really a distraction from what we need to be thinking about. We need to be thinking about how to get better,"" he said.Since 2001, Agassi has invested in education for underprivileged children, establishing 130 schools serving approximately 80,000 students in the United States. He attributes this achievement to his persistent drive to overcome obstacles.His demanding tennis career shaped his ability to maintain focus and adapt when necessary.""Sports is all about problem-solving. Tennis taught me how to navigate a very intense environment and maintain my objectivity and problem-solving abilities. It forces me to be present, but also to understand the context of what I'm doing,"" Agassi said.Regarding his earlier defiant period, Agassi acknowledged it as a necessary phase in his journey.""Vulnerability is essential for growth, and I think vulnerability eventually leads to humility,"" he added.He recognised technology's crucial role in education, particularly in providing individualised learning opportunities for children. This belief influenced his investment in the Indian EdTech company, Square Panda .""I think technology can play an essential role, not just in scalability, but also in optimising personalised learning. That's why I got involved with Square Panda.

NEW DELHI: Former world number one tennis player from Romania Simona Halep has raised concerns about the perceived discrepancies in the treatment of cases involving positive tests for banned substances by the International Tennis Integrity Agency ( ITIA ).Her criticism stems from the recent one-month ban imposed on Iga Swiatek , the current world number two, after testing positive for the heart medication trimetazidine (TMZ) in an out-of-competition sample.Halep, who returned to tennis in March 2023 after serving a provisional suspension since October 2022 for testing positive for roxadustat at the US Open, believes there is a lack of consistency in the ITIA's approach.She questions the significant difference in the penalties handed out to her and Swiatek, despite the cases occurring around the same time.In her statement, Halep expressed her bewilderment at the disparate treatment and questioned the logical reasoning behind the ITIA's decisions.

How is it possible that in identical cases that happened at about the same time (of the season), ITIA has completely different approaches, to my detriment?”Halep had initially received a four-year ban from the ITIA, which she successfully appealed at the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) in February 2023. The CAS ruled that her positive test for roxadustat, a banned blood doping agent, was the result of a contaminated supplement.Her experience has raised concerns about the fairness and impartiality of the disciplinary process within the tennis governing bodies.",Former world number one tennis player Simona Halep has raised concerns about the perceived discrepancies in the treatment of positive tests by the ITIA.

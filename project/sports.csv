IND vs AUS 1st Test Live: India Need to Take Some Tough Playing XI Calls for WACA Test

NEW DELHI: All eyes will be on spinners as they may have a subtler, but significant, role in the high-profile Border-Gavaskar Trophy in Australia, starting on November 22 in Perth, where pace-friendly conditions typically dominate.Australia's Nathan Lyon could be a game-changer, leveraging bounce and turn on dry, deteriorating pitches late on. For India, Ravichandran Ashwin, Ravindra Jadeja, and Washington Sundar -- who was given the chance ahead of left-arm spinner Axar Patel -- will need to be spot-on with their skills to extract bounce and maintain accuracy.While the primary impact is likely to come from fast bowlers, spinners can still influence outcomes by breaking partnerships and exploiting rough patches on days four and five. Their effectiveness will depend on the pitch conditions and match situations throughout the series.Team India has preferred Jadeja over Ashwin on foreign tours in recent years, but the time has come for Team India to change their plans in Perth and come up with an out-of-the-box thinking and bring Ashwin in to outplay the mighty Aussies on their home ground.Former India captain Sourav Ganguly recently voiced his opinion on the key selection debate, suggesting that Ashwin should feature in India's playing XI for the opening Test in Perth. Ganguly backed Ashwin due to Australia's heavy reliance on left-handed batters, against whom the offie has proven highly effective. His record of exploiting left-handers with sharp off-spin and tactical variations could provide India with a critical edge in the series opener.Without a doubt, Jadeja and Sundar are stronger batters compared to Ashwin. However, Ashwin's exceptional ability to claim wickets during critical moments sets him apart as a match-winner. His mastery over spin bowling coupled with his tactical variations, make him an indispensable asset in challenging conditions.Ashwin and Jadeja have contrasting records in Australia, showcasing their unique strengths. Ashwin, with 39 wickets in 10 Tests at an average of 42.15 and a best of 4-55, has been a consistent performer. Meanwhile, Jadeja's record stands out for its efficiency: 14 wickets in just four Tests at an impressive average of 21.78, with a best of 4-62.Sundar, who recently delivered impressive performances against New Zealand at home, has also made a strong case for inclusion in the playing XI. His Test debut at the Gabba in 2021 was nothing short of remarkable, showcasing his prowess with both bat and ball.Sundar picked up four wickets in that match, his only Test appearance in Australia to date. More notably, he played a crucial match-winning innings, scoring 62 runs in a vital 123-run partnership with Shardul Thakur.Off-spinner Lyon, who has the ability to pose a significant threat to Indian batters, recently revealed that he has been closely analysing footage of Ashwin's bowling to gain valuable insights.“He’s taught me a lot. I’m a big believer in the players that you play against are your best coaches that you eventually come across. I’ve watched a lot of his footage heading over to India, the way he goes about it here in Australia, see if I can pick up anything,” Lyon toldLyon, who has had considerable success against India over the years, sees Ashwin's tactical brilliance as a source of inspiration.“There’s so much to learn in this great game, and there’s so much for me to learn off Ash. He’s a world-class bowler. He’s taken over 500 Test match wickets and he should be extremely proud of that,” the 36-year-old added.Lyon has an outstanding record against India, with 121 wickets in 27 Tests, including nine five-wicket hauls and two 10-wicket match hauls. His ability to consistently trouble India's batters underlines his dominance in this high-stakes rivalry. In home conditions, Lyon has been even more formidable, amassing 259 wickets in 67 Tests played in Australia.Australia will be keen to make amends for their previous defeats to India in the five-match Border-Gavaskar Trophy , having lost at home in both the 2018-19 and 2020-21 series.","Ravichandran Ashwin, Ravindra Jadeja and Nathan Lyon will carry the spin bowling responsibilities in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy.

Nitish Reddy: Can he be the all-rounder India are looking for? | #BTBHighlights

India Need to Take a Big Call on the Pace Bowling Department for Perth Test

NEW DELHI: Former Indian cricketer Harbhajan Singh voiced his concerns about the team's composition ahead of the opening Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy in Perth.Team India is reportedly considering giving all-rounder Nitish Kumar Reddy his first Test cap in the opening match. Nitish has received an unexpected call-up after his recent debut in T20 Internationals against Bangladesh.Harbhajan Singh, during a discussion on Jatin Sapru's YouTube channel, emphasized the limited experience in Reddy's first-class career. The 21-year-old has played 23 matches, accumulating 779 runs at an average of 21.05 and claiming 56 wickets at an average of 26.98.Harbhajan questioned the decision to place such a crucial responsibility on Reddy in the demanding conditions of Perth. The former spinner also highlighted the absence of Shardul Thakur , who played a key part in India's notable series victory in Australia during the 2020-21 season.""You needed an all-rounder like Hardik Pandya . But you don't have an option but to play Nitish Kumar Reddy. Where is Shardul Thakur? Where is Hardik Pandya? We just confined them to shorter formats. Suddenly, on a tour like this, you're asking Nitish to bowl,"" Harbhajan said.Harbhajan suggested that Reddy's role might be comparable to the bowling contributions of former captain Sourav Ganguly , providing a few overs of medium pace and potentially picking up crucial breakthroughs.""What he can do is just bowl a few overs here and there like Sourav Ganguly did, and if he gets 1-2 wickets, then that would be a bonus,"" Harbhajan added.As the first Test is set to commence at Perth's Optus Stadium on Friday, there are questions being raised about the team's approach to selection.","Harbhajan Singh questions India's selection of all-rounder Nitish Kumar Reddy.

Why India will miss Cheteshwar Pujara in Australia? | #BTBHighlights

A typical cricket highlights package is curated for fans who've missed live action due to work or school. In the past, those highlights lasted 30 minutes and the contents featured boundaries and wickets. But to cater to modern diminished attention spans and the swipe generation, even highlights these days last only 15 minutes or less.Hence, the ball that is left alone by the batter is not captured.""Well left"". An event that frustrates fast bowlers after pounding in from 30 yards and they see no result. They then bowl in areas where the batter wants, only for him to cash in. Cheteshwar Pujara , one of the architects of India's last two series wins Down Under, built his entire game around defence and leaving deliveries on length.If you were lucky to wake up in the early hours on that miracle Tuesday of Jan 19, 2021, to witness India take the first steps towards engineering that incredible heist at Gabba, that one shot-the Pujara leave-especially against Pat Cummins , became a vital recurring theme.Cummins, named Player of the Series for his lung-bursting exploits of labour and skill, dismissed Pujara five times in that series, but the Saurashtra rock faced 459 balls from him. Overall, he faced 928 deliveries. That meant Australia's most potent weapon used up 49% of his bowling arsenal and energy reserves at just one Indian batter.On THAT Day Five in 2021, when Cummins largely operated from the end where the ball was misbehaving from a length, Pujara 56 (211b), literally sewed that end up, chewing deliveries, taking nine painful blows (finger, elbow, box, helmet, repeat) and was there till the last hour of the chase, by when most of the bowlers', especially Cummins' fuel tanks, were running empty.He had done the same during India's 'victorious draw' at Sydney, where he made 77 in 205 balls.In the 2018-19 series where Pujara scored three tons and was player-of-the-series, he faced 1258 deliveries. Pujara will be a part of the 2024-25 Border-Gavaskar Trophy too, but only as a commentator on the Hindi feed.And Australian pacer Josh Hazlewood expressed happiness at not having to deal with Pujara.Speaking to reporters ahead of the first Test at Perth on Friday, Hazlewood said, ""I'm happy that Puj isn't here. He's one that bats time, makes you earn his wicket every time and has done well in Australia on all these tours."" Tim Paine , former Australia wicketkeeper and the skipper when they lost back-to-back series at home to India, stressed, ""A lot of people talk about Rishabh Pant in the last series in Australia, but the guy who won them the series was Pujara. He wore us down and wore our fast bowlers down. He kept getting hit on the body but kept getting up. There is still place for that in cricket,"" Paine said in the Grade Cricketer podcast.Australia are hoping that Marnus Labuschagne will do that role for them as they hope to cook the inexperienced Indian fast bowlers, especially Jasprit Bumrah with attritional play before the series gets to the flatter surfaces of Melbourne and Sydney.Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, Labuschagne hinted that playing the long game will help Australia. ""We understand that getting the Indian bowlers back for their second and third spells, putting them under pressure and letting them come to us and us putting pressure back on them through overs in the field and time in the game, especially over a five-Test series, that's important. Because as you get into the third, fourth, fifth Test, if they're trying to play the same team, and those bowlers are rolling into 100, 150, 200 overs by the third Test, it's going to make a big difference,"" the No. 3 batter said.The question for India though is who will essay Pujara's role in a line-up that is not short of bravado, but woefully short of form and confidence. KL Rahul , who is now tipped to open with Yashasvi Jaiswal, left a lot of deliveries during successful outings in England and South Africa in 2021. If he recalibrates his defensive game, he could do the Pujara role, as pace does not hurry him.Dhruv Jurel used up more than 300 balls while scoring twin fifties on a helpful MCG track batting for India 'A' vs Australia 'A'. With the ability to play close to the body, could he do a Pujara, even at No. 6?","Cummins dismissed Pujara five times in that series, but the Saurashtra rock faced 459 balls from him. That meant Australia's most potent weapon used up 49% of his bowling arsenal and energy reserves at just one Indian batter. Australia are hoping Marnus Labuschagne will do that role for them as they hope to cook the inexperienced Indian fast bowlers.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115510350,imgsize-36002,width-400,resizemode-4/115510350.jpg"

Champions Trophy in PAK: More drama as Jay Shah strongly objects PCB's PoK plans

NEW DELHI: In a recent viral video , a Pakistani cricket fan faced an unusual situation at the Sydney Cricket Ground in Australia.The fan, proudly sporting a Pakistan cricket jersey and holding a photo of former Prime Minister Imran Khan lifting the 1992 World Cup trophy, was approached by a stadium steward.The official issued an ultimatum: surrender the photo or leave the premises. ""Either you give it to me or you go home,"" the steward is heard saying in the clip.Watch:The incident has sparked heated debate online, with fans questioning whether the steward’s actions were warranted.Imran Khan, a legendary cricketer and captain of Pakistan’s historic 1992 World Cup victory, remains an iconic figure in cricket.However, his political career has made him a polarizing figure internationally, and the display of his image in a public venue may have prompted the steward’s intervention.This comes at a time when Khan’s political and legal battles dominate headlines. After being ousted from power in a no-confidence vote in 2022, Khan faces over 150 cases, including graft allegations involving state gifts.While a Pakistani court recently granted him bail in one case, Khan remains entangled in multiple trials and convictions, some carrying hefty sentences.He has denied all charges, maintaining they are politically motivated.Meanwhile, Pakistan cricket faces its own challenges. Recently, the national team suffered a 3-0 whitewash in a T20I series against Australia.On the other hand, the country is looking forward to hosting the ICC Champions Trophy in 2025. India is reluctant to send its team to Pakistan for the prestigious ICC tournament, prompting a standoff situation between the two nations.Amid the uncertainties, the trophy tour, currently underway in Pakistan, aims to rekindle excitement among fans by travelling through cities like Islamabad, Abbottabad, and Karachi.",A Pakistani cricket fan faced an unusual situation at the Sydney Cricket Ground in Australia.

Border-Gavaskar Trophy: Border Gavaskar Trophy: India's jolted batting order needs to fire in Australia,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/india-in-australia/indias-jolted-batting-order-needs-to-fire-in-australia/articleshow/115471460.cms,"Explained: Why India decided to have a three-day match-simulation in Perth ahead of first Test

NEW DELHI: India's recent batting struggles against teams like Bangladesh and New Zealand have raised concerns, particularly ahead of the crucial Border-Gavaskar Trophy series in Australia.India's batting order has been a cornerstone of their success, but performing in Australian conditions has historically presented challenges. With fast, bouncy pitches and aggressive bowlers, it demands a solid strategy, adaptability and resilience.India has struggled to build strong partnerships and early wickets against Bangladesh and middle-order collapses against New Zealand exposed this weakness.Against Bangladesh, quick dismissals left India playing catch-up. Versus New Zealand, the middle order crumbled under pressure.In Australia, Indian batters need to focus on rotating the strike and avoiding extended dry patches, ensuring a steady flow of runs even under pressure.Swinging conditions exploited by Trent Boult and disciplined spin bowling from Bangladesh exposed technical gaps. Indian openers and middle-order batters failed to adapt quickly to movement and slower surfaces.India's top-order must set the tone in Australia. Players like Rohit Sharma Yashasvi Jaiswal and Shubman Gill need to negotiate the new ball effectively against Australia's world-class pace attack, featuring the likes of Pat Cummins Josh Hazlewood , and Mitchell Starc India's middle order has seen frequent changes recently. Consistent contributions from Virat Kohli , KL Rahul and Risbhan Pant would be crucial. Kohli, with his vast experience in Australia, could be pivotal in anchoring the innings.India's batting often leans heavily on players like Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma. When they fail, the team struggles to post competitive totals. In recent games, Kohli's early dismissals left a void that others couldn't fill.Australia's pitches, particularly at grounds like the Gabba and Perth, can be intimidating. Indian batters need to stay patient, play late, and avoid over-committing to drives. The middle order must take more responsibility. Youngsters like Shubman Gill need to seize opportunities.All-rounders like Ravindra Jadeja and Ravichandran Ashwin must provide depth and finish strongly. Their ability to counter-attack and rotate strike is essential for the lower middle order.Each batter should have a defined role and India should consider left-right combinations to disrupt Australian bowlers' rhythm.If India can adapt to the conditions, maintain partnerships, and utilize their batting depth, they stand a strong chance to succeed Down Under.There's no doubt that India's batting order has the talent to bounce back stronger and perform consistently against a top-quality opposition like Australia.","India's batting order has been a cornerstone of their success, but performing in Australian conditions has historically presented challenges.

Champions Trophy in PAK: More drama as Jay Shah strongly objects PCB's PoK plans

NEW DELHI: Former Pakistan pacer Shoaib Akhtar recently took centre stage as he joined the Champions Trophy tour in Pakistan, displaying his excitement for the prestigious ICC tournament set to take place in 2025.Sharing a moment of pride on social media, Akhtar posted a photo on platform X (formerly Twitter), captioned: “Landed back in Pakistan to this beauty. Champions Trophy in the house!!”Despite the celebratory mood, the road to hosting the Champions Trophy remains steeped in uncertainty.Tensions persist over whether the tournament will occur in Pakistan, feature a hybrid model, or be shifted entirely.The debate gained momentum when the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) informed the International Cricket Council (ICC) that India would not send its team to Pakistan, citing security and diplomatic concerns.In response, the Pakistan Cricket Board ( PCB ) has firmly opposed a hybrid model, arguing that hosting the tournament in its entirety is vital for showcasing Pakistan as a viable venue for international cricket.The ICC, meanwhile, faces a challenging balancing act as it considers the implications of the standoff.Akhtar recently weighed in on the issue in an interview, saying, ""It's really up to the governments. It's nothing to do with the BCCI. It is up to the BJP government. They will decide.""""There will be back channel talks. Even in days of war, there are back channel talks. We should not lose hope. We have to look forward to a solution. We know a fact that 95-98 per cent of sponsorship for ICC comes from India,"" the former fast bowler added.The stakes are high. Akhtar noted that Pakistan risks losing significant revenue if the Champions Trophy is relocated, while also missing a crucial opportunity to shed the stigma of being an unsuitable host for marquee events.""If Pakistan fails to convince India to come to Pakistan, then two things will happen: Pakistan will lose about 100 million dollars of the sponsorship that will go to ICC and the host country will earn. Second, it would be better if India comes and plays in Pakistan. But it's really, really up to the government. It has nothing to do with BCCI.""In a lighter vein, Akhtar also pictured the excitement of Indian star Virat Kohli playing in Pakistan, adding, “Virat Kohli is trying to play in Pakistan for the first time. Entire Pakistan wants to see Virat play in Pakistan. Imagine him scoring a century in Pakistan. It will be good; he doesn't score a century here and gets out early. It will be a full circle for him.”","Former Pakistan pacer Shoaib Akhtar joined the Champions Trophy tour in Pakistan.

As the impasse over the Champions Trophy hosting and scheduling continues, former Pakistan batsman Basit Ali has claimed that the tournament's official broadcaster has said 'no' to the hybrid model or to have India and Pakistan in different pools.After the Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ) refused to send the Indian team to Pakistan -- the designated hosts of the tournament, the Pakistan Cricket Board ( PCB ) has taken a tough stance with strong objection to a hybrid model, which will allow India to play their matches at a neutral venue, while the rest of tournament is hosted in Pakistan.In fact, the PCB chairman, Mohsin Naqvi, has gone on record to say that the hybrid model is not acceptable to Pakistan.With huge amounts of financial gains from an International Cricket Council ( ICC ) tournament dependent on the India vs Pakistan game and both the nations sticking to their decisions, the announcement of the schedule is understandably on hold as a tournament without either of the teams will take the sheen off it.""What did I tell you about the Champions Trophy...Broadcaster isn't agreeing to (hybrid model or India and Pakistan in different pools) and it won't,"" said Basit in a video on his YouTube channel. ""If there is no India-Pakistan match in a tournament, then it would be like a tasteless dish.""The former middle-order batsman added that Pakistan has made the right moves, which has put the ICC in a fix, where they have to not only satisfy both the BCCI and the PCB, but also the broadcaster, who won't be ready to bear any financial losses in the event of no India-Pakistan match.""PCB has played its cards very well, well done!...If you want to go ahead with the hybrid model, do it.

How long will Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, R Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja play?

CUMMINS, SMITH, LYON AUSSIES TO WATCH

The Border Gavaskar Trophy (BGT) is less than 48 hours away, and Ravi Shastri is one who knows the inside-out of a tour of Australia both as a former all-rounder and former India coach. In the latest episode of the 'The ICC Review', Shastri picked the Indian and Australian players to watch out for.Australia will host India for a five-match BGT beginning Perth on November 22, where India will not just defend the trophy but also try to stay in the top two of the World Test Championship (WTC) table after conceding their top spot to Australia after the 0-3 whitewash at home against New Zealand.Shastri, who was India's coach during the historic triumphs on the last two tours of Australia, said Yashasvi Jaiswal among the batters and Jasprit Bumrah among the bowlers are the two players who would be his pick to make an impact for India.""Jaiswal at the top because if he gets in, he can be devastating. You know he plays spin very well, he plays at his own tempo, he's got all the shots in the book,"" Shastri said.""He's an entertainer, so if he gets in as we've seen in his career already, you know he has the ability to get the big scores. You don't hit two consecutive double hundreds, you know, just like that. You've got to have the hunger, you have to have the quality and the ability.""Jaiswal announced himself in international cricket with two consecutive double hundreds in the Test series at home against England earlier this year.Vice-captain and India's bowling spearhead Bumrah has an enviable record in Australia, which has seen him taking 32 wickets in seven matches at an average of just 21.25.Bumrah will lead India in the BGT opener in Perth as the team's regular skipper Rohit Sharma won't be available. Rohit has stayed back in India after the birth of his child earlier this month and is likely to join the team ahead of the second Test.""I think Jasprit, no question,"" said Shastri about his second pick. ""Because he's the best fast bowler in the world. There's no question about that...and you'd expect him at this stage of his career, where at times he makes the ball talk, to be the highest wicket-taker,"" said Shastri.Among the Australia squad, Shastri said seasoned campaigners in captain and fast bowler Pat Cummins, veteran batter Steve Smith and off-spin great Nathan Lyon will be the players that can make the difference for the hosts.Talking about Cummins, he has 35 wickets to his credit from the last eight BGT Tests at home, averagint 23.14.Putting Lyon in the same bracket, Shastri said you can't ""take your eye"" off a man who has always troubled India, both in India and at home.""Pat Cummins will be at you. He's relentless. I mean, don't take your eye off Nathan Lyon because he has a fantastic record against India, both at home and away. So he'll be someone to watch but Pat Cummins because if Australia have to damage early doors and then later on, it will be Cummins,"" Shastri reckoned.Picking Smith as his choice among the Australian batting unit, Shastri said: ""Steve Smith because of his experience, because of his past record; and he's at that stage of his career where he needs a challenge. He needs a challenge, and I think he'll be up for it,"" said the 1983 World Cup winner.""It could be his final series against India, so that's another way to look at it. And just seeing his form in that couple of games against Pakistan makes me think in that fashion. And it's again, with these players, the Kohlis, the Smiths, it's how you start,"" he added.Shastri felt India need to put pressure on Smith early in the series because if he gets going in the first 2-3 innings, he will continue to plunder runs.""In the first three innings of the series, if he gets away with a hundred, then they'll keep badgering you. I think India will have to come hard; they'll have to be tight and they'll have to keep the pressure on. They have to be relentless with Smith early.""",The Border Gavaskar Trophy (BGT) is less than 48 hours away. Australia will host India for a five-match BGT beginning Perth on November 22.

Will Messi Make It?

Challenges & Concerns

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: State sports minister V Abdurahiman on Wednesday assured football fans that Argentina ’s national team, including Lionel Messi , will play two friendlies in the state next year, but stopped short of making a formal announcement.Representatives of the Argentina Football Association (AFA) will visit the state within six weeks to finalise the trip, Abdurahiman said. ""It is not right on my part to make a formal announcement. That will be done by AFA,” he told a media interaction at the state secretariat.The rivals of La Albiceleste for the friendlies have not been finalised, but indications are that it will be a prominent Asian side. It is learnt that AFA officials have sought a list of opponents from the state govt, and the association will pick their rivals from the list.The dates of matches will also be finalised after the AFA team’s visit, but the state govt is learnt to be exploring the possibility of hosting them in Oct. The minister has sought the help of traders to mobilise funds for organising such a high-profile fixture.Messi, a global icon, enjoys a huge fan following in Kerala , where football has long held a special place in the people's hearts. However, it will be too premature to confirm his presence in the squad as the friendlies are still a long way off.Earlier in the year, Messi didn’t take the field for Inter Miami’s friendly in Hong Kong, which resulted in a severe backlash from local fans and organisers had to offer a 50% refund on tickets.The minister didn’t announce the venue of matches, but his reference to a 50,000-capacity stadium for hosting them is a hint at Jawaharlal Nehru International Stadium in Kochi . The stadium regularly hosts Indian Super League matches with fans packed to the rafters, but FIFA and Asian Football Confederation officials have expressed various concerns, particularly on security issues.The government will have several issues to address, like the exit routes, toilet facilities and even structural stability.“We know there are problems at JNI. Though we cannot rectify all of them, we will surely work on security issues, including those about sufficient exits, and toilet facilities. The complaints about structural stability will also be looked into,"" an official said.FIFA officials, when they visited the stadium last time, had raised concerns over the presence of cooking gas cylinders and inflammable objects at restaurants in the complex. The govt is, however, hopeful of cooperation from trade organisations on the matter.The Greenfield Stadium in Thiruvananthapuram is the only alternative, but it is now maintained and operated by Kerala Cricket Association (KCA). However, the govt doesn't need to tick all the boxes for the international friendlies as against a FIFA-approved tournament.","Argentina Football Association (AFA) will visit the state within six weeks to finalise the trip.

Uttar Pradesh rode a brace from Mohammad Tauseef to defeat Jharkhand 2-1 in the day’s earlier match.Bengal came into the game with a scintillating form, blowing away Jharkhand (4-0) and UP (7-0) in their previous two matches and looked well-placed to top the group — a prerequisite for progressing to the next round. However, Sen was also aware of the challenge on hand given that Bihar could advance with a win by upstaging the hosts on a head-to-head count.Bengal started on the offensive but couldn’t breach Bihar’s well-planned defensive set-up. The hosts, however, came close to breaking the deadlock towards the end of the first half.As winger Amarnath Baskey entered the box from the left side, Bihar defender Arif Khan stopped him in his tracks with an illegal push, forcing Shyamson Singh Chongtham to point to the spot-kick.However, Robi Hansda — who scored six goals in the previous two games — saw his penalty-kick saved by Bihar goalkeeper Sunny Raj as the ball ricocheted off the crosspiece in the 40th minute.Bengal continued to dominate after the break and Manotos Maji, who came on as a second-half substitute, could have snatched the win at the death but he failed to find the target from close following a low cross from Baskey.Nine group winners will now join reigning champions Services, last year’s runners-up Goa and hosts Telangana in the final round where they will be further divided into two groups of six teams each. Four teams from each group will progress to the quarterfinals.","Bengal finish Group C with 7 points, three points ahead of Bihar while Uttar Pradesh and Jharkhand return with a win each.

KOCHI: Kerala will look to put their struggles behind them and stamp their authority in the Santosh Trophy National Football Championship when they begin their group campaign at home in Kozhikode on Wednesday.With a dozen newcomers in their roster, Kerala are banking on them to deliver and lay their hands on a trophy they last lifted three years ago in Kolkata.They face Railways in their opening fixture at the EMS Corporation Stadium, Kozhikode, on Wednesday.The group also includes Puducherry and Lakshadweep. However, only the top team from each group will progress to the championship's final round.Despite being billed as group favourites, coach Biby Thomas , who previously coached the Indian U-16 women’s team, doesn’t want to look too far ahead. “As of now, our first target is to beat Railways. We will be taking one step at a time,” said Biby.The hosts’ defence seems to be their biggest strength, led by captain Sanju G and supported by experienced players Manoj M, Muhammed Aslam, and Adil Amal.

NEW DELHI: Pep Guardiola will reportedly stay as manager of Manchester City for at least one more year, according to The Athletic.The Athletic reports Guardiola will sign a one-year extension to his current contract, which expires at the end of this season, with an option for another year. The 53-year-old manager has already signed two contract extensions during his time at City, both during the November international break.Guardiola’s potential extension comes amidst a turbulent period for Manchester City. The club is facing an ongoing hearing over 115 breaches of the Premier League ’s financial regulations, leading to speculation about Guardiola's future. Adding to the uncertainty, City’s director of football , Txiki Begiristain, will leave the club at the end of the season.Despite the challenges, keeping Guardiola would be a significant boost for the club. “The retention of one the most decorated coaches in football history would be a massive boost to the morale of City players and fans,” stated The Athletic.Since joining Manchester City in 2016, Guardiola has led the team to significant victories, including six Premier League titles and the club’s first-ever Champions League title.","Pep Guardiola will reportedly stay as manager of Manchester City for at least one more year.

Uninspiring Argentina

Jeers for Brazil

Lautaro Martinez's goal gave Argentina a 1-0 win over Peru on Tuesday in a South American qualifying match in Buenos Aires and left the hosts close to a spot in the 2026 World Cup in the United States, Mexico and Canada.Their main continental rivals Brazil drew 1-1 against Uruguay in Salvador, Brazil with two impressive goals in an otherwise lackluster match. Federico Valverde gave Uruguay the lead with a curled shot from the edge of the box, and Gerson netted his first for Brazil in similar fashion at the Arena Fonte Nova.Argentina lead South American qualifying with 25 points from 12 matches, five points clear of its closest competitor, Uruguay. Ecuador and Colombia are next with 19 points each.Brazil lag in fifth position with 18 points after several uninspiring performances, still hoping that striker Neymar will return from injury and fit in again. Paraguay, with 17 points, are in sixth place.South American qualifying will give six direct berths in the next World Cup. Seventh-place Bolivia, with 13 points, are in the international playoff position. Venezuela (12), Chile (9), and Peru (7) are out of qualifying spots.The next round of South American World Cup qualifying will be played in March.Martinez's goal was his 32nd for the national team, which puts him level with the legendary Diego Maradona.Until Martinez scored, Argentina's best chance was in the 21st minute, when striker Julian Alvarez hit the Peruvian goalkeeper's right post. Messi once again had a modest performance, as he did in his team's 2-1 defeat at Paraguay on Thursday.Messi crossed the ball in the penalty area in the 55th minute to give Martinez one of the few clear opportunities of the match. The striker moved his body with more grace than power to put the ball in the back of the next.Despite the disappointing performance at home, Lionel Messi's team will finish the year with few question marks beyond its performances in November.“We won Copa America, we lead South American World Cup qualifying,” said goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez. “We must be proud of ourselves.”Brazil fans at home in Salvador jeered their team after the final whistle. In a match with few opportunities for either side, Uruguay seemed closer to winning for most of the second half.Valverde opened the scoring in the 55th minute after Brazilian defenders failed three times to clear the ball from their penalty area. The Real Madrid midfielder hit the ball to the left corner to score. Gerson equalised in the 61st minute.Striker Raphinha said he understood the frustration from his team's fans, but disagreed with them.“We played great. We did everything we could to leave here with a victory. We must have our heads high up, it will be very tough to beat us,” he said.Also on Tuesday, Ecuador won 1-0 at Colombia with a goal by Enner Valencia in the seventh minute, in which he dribbled through three players before scoring. Ecuador lost defender Piero Hincapié to a red card in the 34th minute but held on for the win.Bolivia and Paraguay drew 2-2 in a match between teams that could end up fighting for the seventh position in the region's qualifying. Chile, one of the worst performing teams in the region this year, showed some fighting spirit and beat Venezuela 4-2.","Argentina lead South American qualifying with 25 points from 12 matches, five points clear of its closest competitor, Uruguay.

Rafa!”Nadal had an impressive record in the Davis Cup, with 29 victories in his last 30 singles matches.

However, he regained his composure to hold serve.Nadal, currently ranked 154th, aimed for shorter points, employing powerful serves and showcasing his renowned forehand.

He then converted his second set point.Nadal mounted a comeback in the second set, recovering from 0-30 down, but he couldn't convert it into a hold.

It was the best doubles of our lives.""For Britain it felt like a massive opportunity missed to win the competition for the first time and reach the final for the first time since losing to the United States in 1981.After Raducanu fought off the hard-hitting Hruncakova to seal her third singles win on the spin, Britain's number one Boulter, who like Raducanu had not lost a set in the ties against Germany and Canada, seemed in control.The world number 24 cruised the first set 6-2 but Sramkova then found another level to seize command of the second.She led 4-1 and although Boulter clawed it back to 4-4, Sramkova kept her country in the hunt by taking it to a decider.Sramkova carried the momentum into the third set to lead 3-1 but again Boulter fought back, cheered on by a sizeable British contingent in the small arena, to make it 3-3.It was Sramkova who kept her nerve though and at 4-5 down, Boulter served a double fault to give her opponent match points and she then struck a ball tamely wide to end the contest.Mihalikova and Hruncakova then took apart a disappointing British doubles duo to book Slovakia's place in Wednesday's showdown when they will again be big underdogs.Italy will be led by world number four Jasmine Paolini who will also partner Sara Errani, with whom she won gold at the Paris Olympics, in the doubles.""We are underdogs again but our confidence is growing,"" Liptak, in charge since 2009, said.""It's a dream, I've been a captain for many years and this was my dream to play in the final.""",Slovakia reach the Billie Jean King Cup final as doubles pairing Tereza Mihalikova and Viktoria Hruncakova complete a stunning comeback victory.

Jaipur: Players from Pullela Gopichand Badminton Academy (PGBA) and Prakash Padukone Badminton Academy (PPBA) have dominated the national tournaments for years now. In the last two decades, most titles in sub-junior ranking tournaments were claimed by either PGBA or PPBA shuttlers.However, a major change seems to be happening in India’s badminton scenario. Smaller centres/academies with limited resources have started challenging players from the formidable academies and beating them.In the All India Sub-Junior (Under-15 and Under-17) Ranking tournament, which concluded at the Sawai Mansingh Indoor Stadium here on Tuesday, not a single title was won by powerhouses of Indian badminton. All the 10 titles were claimed by non-PGBA and PPBA shuttlers. More than 30 players were in action on the ninth and last day of the competition, and barring a couple of players, all finalists were from smaller academies.Just like cricket, badminton is witnessing a huge shift in talent catchment areas beyond Hyderabad and Bengaluru. Around two-three decades ago, most of the Indian cricket team’s players came from Mumbai, Delhi, Bangalore or other big centres. Now, several cricketers from smaller towns are making the cut.Dev Ruparelia, the U-17 boys’ singles winner here, hails from Palghar, a town in the Konkan division of Maharashtra. The top seed defeated Jagsher Singh Khangurra 21-18, 21-14 in the final. Eighth seed Jagsher belongs to Punjab and trains under former Indian shuttler Akshit Mahajan.“I started with Nitesh Badminton Academy in Palghar and stuck with it despite getting regular offers from the big centres. I train for nearly eight hours a day and am happy with the results. I don’t have any plans to shift anywhere as I get the best coaching in my hometown,” said Dev, who is ranked No. 2 in the U-17 boys singles. The promising shuttler has represented the junior India team twice.Similarly, Parul Choudhary, the champion in the U-17 girls’ singles, hails from Churu, a city in the desert region of Rajasthan. The India No. 3 trains in Gurgaon under coach Manish Sharma. The southpaw won back-to-back titles after she pocketed her maiden crown in the last All India ranking tournament in Vijayawada.“I get personal attention from my coaches. In the last one year or so, I have improved a lot and also became the first Rajasthani player to represent the junior Indian team. I want to achieve results in the U-19 as well as the women’s singles in the future,” said Parul, a niece of Paralympic javelin legend Devendra Jhajharia.Parul’s coach Manish Sharma admitted that the domination of big centres is slowly getting over and it’s a good sign that the game is growing rapidly in remote places.“Parents now want their kids to train individually rather than in a big bunch of players. Players and parents have now realised that one-to-one coaching is the need of the hour. We train Parul individually with a set of coaches and support staff. Several players of PGBA and PPBA have left them. Some of them have joined BAI’s National Centre of Excellence in Guwahati,” said Sharma.A senior BAI official said he is pleased with the results of the Jaipur tournament because it marked the beginning of a paradigm shift in national badminton. “The positive side of it is that we are no longer dependent on the two big centres. Now, the smaller academies are producing winners and coming out of the shadows of powerful academies. It will ultimately benefit Indian badminton,” said the BAI official.","Players from Pullela Gopichand Badminton Academy (PGBA) have dominated the national tournaments for years now.

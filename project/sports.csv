Mohammed Shami: 'I just go for wickets; don't care about the economy rate at all'

NEW DELHI: Amid a spate of retirements from Indian cricket’s senior stalwarts, including Ravichandran Ashwin and Cheteshwar Pujara , veteran pacer Mohammed Shami has dismissed rumours about his own future, declaring that he has no plans to step aside just yet.Shami, overlooked for the Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy in England and dropped from India’s squad for the upcoming Asia Cup, said he would keep playing until the day he no longer feels motivated. In a fiery response to speculation, the 34-year-old questioned the intent behind the chatter.“If someone has a problem, tell me. Whose life will become better if I take retirement?” Shami told News24. “Mai kiski zindagi mein patthar bana hua hu ki tumhe mujhse retirement chahiye? The day I get bored, I will leave. You don’t pick me, don’t play me, I don’t care. But I will keep working hard.”Shami insisted he would continue to feature in domestic cricket if not selected for internationals. “You don’t pick me in internationals, I will play domestic. I will keep playing somewhere or the other. Retirement and such decisions are made when you start feeling bored, when you don’t want to wake up at 7 am for a Test.That is not the time for me now. I’ll be up at 5 if you want me to,” he said.The fast bowler, who last played for India in March during the Champions Trophy, stressed that his biggest motivation remains unfinished business with the ODI World Cup. “I only have one dream left, that is to win the ODI World Cup. We were very close in 2023. We had a gut feeling, but there was also fear in the knockout stage. The enthusiasm and belief of the fans motivated us. Maybe it was not in my luck then, but I want to be there in 2027,” Shami remarked.Reflecting on his fitness, Shami revealed he has worked tirelessly over the past two months to shed weight, build rhythm, and prepare for longer spells. “Touchwood it is better now. I have trained, increased my skills, practiced batting, fielding, gym work — everything. My focus is on getting rhythm and being able to bowl long spells,” he explained.Despite recent injury setbacks, Shami remains adamant that his journey is not over. As he put it bluntly: “I still love the game. The day I lose that drive, I’ll walk away myself. Until then, I will keep fighting.”",Mohammed Shami says he will keep playing until the day he no longer feels motivated.

Taylor Townsend and Jelena Ostapenko clashed at the U.S. Open on Wednesday, with tensions spilling over immediately after their second-round encounter. Townsend won the match 7-5, 6-1, but the drama truly unfolded once play was over.Instead of heading in opposite directions after a routine handshake, the two stood on the Court 11 sideline exchanging heated words. Ostapenko wagged her finger at Townsend and accused her of lacking “class” and “education.” Townsend, ranked No. 1 in doubles, later revealed the comments to reporters. When asked whether she felt there were racial undertones, the American, who is Black, said she did not take it that way, though she acknowledged such stereotypes have historically been used against her community.Townsend chose to focus on her tennis. “The only thing I’m worried about right now is continuing to move forward through this tournament,” she said.Ostapenko, who lifted the French Open title in 2017, turned to social media after the backlash. She insisted she had never been racist and respected all people, while also accusing Townsend of being “disrespectful” for not apologising after a net cord helped her win a point.She also criticised Townsend’s warm-up routine, saying she broke unwritten tennis etiquette by starting at the net.Townsend brushed off the controversy, instead egging on the New York crowd after the argument and drawing loud cheers from the stands. She emphasised that there was no history of animosity from her side and even welcomed another meeting with Ostapenko outside the United States.This result marked a significant milestone for Townsend, who recently climbed to the top of the doubles rankings. In singles, she is ranked 139 but has now reached the third round of a Grand Slam for the first time since 2023. Her win also made her the lowest-ranked American woman in recent history to defeat a Grand Slam champion at a major.“The thing I’m most proud of is that I let my racket talk,” Townsend said. “I’m still here, moving on, and she’s packed up and gone.”","Taylor Townsend beat Jelena Ostapenko 7-5, 6-1 at the U.S. Open.

PANAJI: The Asian Football Confederation (AFC) has said the indefinite suspension of the top-tier Indian Super League (ISL) is “deeply concerning, given its disruption to clubs' operations, delayed salaries, and the wider threat it poses to the stability of domestic and continental football.”In a letter to AIFF deputy secretary general M Satyanarayan, AFC general secretary Datuk Seri Windsor John sought a factual report on the ISL, clarifying the status of commercial negotiations with its marketing partners, the timeline of Supreme Court ruling, impact on affected clubs and stakeholders, and concrete measures being taken to resume the league and safeguard stability.“Such information is critical for the AFC to properly assess the current situation and determine the next steps,” said Datuk Seri Windsor John.In reply, AIFF has sought time till the SC hearing on Thursday.At the heart of this uncertainty over ISL is the impasse between the AIFF and its marketing partners, FSDL, over the renewal of the 15-year Master Rights Agreement (MRA) that ends on Dec 8. FSDL has kept the season on hold “until further clarity emerges on the contractual structure.”The uncertainty has forced three clubs – Odisha FC, Bengaluru FC and Chennaiyin FC – to keep player salaries on hold, while six clubs have not yet started pre-season.AFC said the growing uncertainty over the ISL raises immediate concerns regarding the participation of Indian clubs in the next season of the AFC Champions League Two, Asian football’s second-tier club competition.“We seek confirmation on whether qualification will be based on the 2025-26 ISL season as per precedent, or through alternative arrangements if the league does not proceed on schedule. We also would like to know in detail what steps the AIFF is taking to ensure Indian clubs remain eligible for continental competition despite current uncertainty.“The impasse represents a domestic crisis with significant implications at the continental level. We trust the AIFF will address it urgently, in line with FIFA and AFC standards of governance and scheduling, while ensuring the welfare and stability of the clubs, players and officials, and safeguarding the representation of Indian clubs in the AFC competitions,” said Datuk Seri Windsor John.","The Indian Super League (ISL) is India’s top-tier league with the champions earning a direct slot in the group stage of the AFC Champions League Two.

Poll Will Jannik Sinner successfully defend his US Open title? Yes No

Flushing Meadows witnessed a blockbuster Tuesday as defending champion Jannik Sinner opened his campaign for back-to-back US Open titles, while former winners Iga Swiatek and Coco Gauff also got their bids for glory underway.World number one Sinner headlined day three action on Arthur Ashe Stadium, easing past unseeded Czech Vit Kopriva in straight sets. The Italian, who has already lifted the Australian Open and Wimbledon crowns this year while finishing runner-up at Roland Garros, is chasing a slice of history in New York. If successful, the 24-year-old will become the first man since Roger Federer in 2008 to retain the title.Sinner’s preparations had been hampered by illness that forced him to retire from the Cincinnati Open final against Carlos Alcaraz earlier this month. Yet the top seed looked sharp on return, insisting his focus is fully on the fortnight ahead after overcoming an early-season doping controversy. “I feel like it’s over. We are focusing on hard work again and trying to get better as an athlete,” Sinner said.In the women’s draw, 2022 champion Swiatek cruised past Colombia’s Emiliana Arango in her opener.Once labelled a clay-court specialist, the Polish star has added layers to her game in 2025, proving her adaptability on faster surfaces. Victories at Wimbledon and in Cincinnati underline her credentials, and she will be among the frontrunners at Flushing Meadows.Home favourite Gauff, the former US Open champion, also delighted fans in the night session. The third seed overcame Australia’s Ajla Tomljanovic under the lights on Ashe, kick-starting her quest to recapture the title she memorably captured in 2023.Elsewhere, world number two Carlos Alcaraz, who could be Sinner’s biggest threat once more, began his campaign on Monday with a straight-sets win over American Reilly Opelka.",Defending champion Jannik Sinner eased past Czech Vit Kopriva in straight sets.

MUMBAI: Cricket legend Sunil Gavaskar 's annual party, postponed after being initially planned in May because of a war-like situation between India and Pakistan, finally happened at the Mumbai Cricket Association's Bandra-Kurla Complex Recreation Club on Sunday night. Incidentally, it turned out to be the same day when India's Test batting stalwart Cheteshwar Pujara announced his retirement from cricket.Just a day earlier (on Aug 23), Gavaskar and former ICC, BCCI , and MCA Fraser Sharad Pawar had unveiled a statue of himself at the entrance of the MCA's Sharad Pawar Cricket Museum.Gavaskar's fierce patriotism came to the fore when the invitation card itself mentioned that the party was being held to ""celebrate the success of Operation Sindoor and the performance of the Indian cricket team in England, which has won the hearts of all Indians."" Operation Sindoor was India's substantial response to Pakistan in the wake of the Pahalgam attacks on April 22. While led by a young, debutant captain in Shubman Gill, India, against all expectations, drew a hard-fought series against England 2-2 while playing some thoroughly entertaining and magnificent cricket.On the occasion, Gavaskar didn't forget to remember his old childhood friends who had departed and were a regular feature at his annual party.At the entrance of the hall, Gavaskar remembered all his childhood friends and former Mumbai teammates Milind Rege, Ehsan Hakim, Vijay Karkhanis, Padmakar Shivalkar, Abdul Ismail and his India teammate Dilip Doshi, with their names inscribed on miniature bats.Present on the occasion was former India captain Nari Contractor, who is 91 now. However, three other cricketers of yesteryear who are all in their 90s — ex-India allrounder Chandu Borde, ex-India ‘keeper Chandu Patankar, and former Rajasthan leg-spinner Chandu Joshi — couldn’t make it due to health reasons. Apparently, Joshi started off from Pune for the party, but had to return from Lonavala as he wasn’t feeling well.The guests at the do included Dilip Vengsarkar, India's 1983 World Cup heroes Sandeep Patil and Balwinder Singh Sandhu, former India wicketkeeper and ex-Kolkata Knight Riders and current Madhya Pradesh head coach Chandrakant Pandit, ex-India players Pravin Amre, Raju Kulkarni, Yajurvindra Singh Bilkha and Jatin Paranjape. Ex-India seamer-turned-commentator Irfan Pathan's presence attracted eyeballs too.In a video message, Gavaskar said, “What a wonderful last 10 days it has been! On August 15, which was our 78th Independence Day, it also happened to be my mother's 100th birth anniversary. Our family got together, it was such a fun evening. I'm pretty certain that my parents, my mother, looking from the heavens above, would have also had fun seeing practically the whole family get together to celebrate her 100th birthday. ”“And then a few days later, my statue was unveiled at the Wankhede Stadium, something which I had not even dreamt of when I started playing cricket in the Bhagirathi buildings. And the day after that, we got together to celebrate Operation Sindoor and the young Indian team's performance in England. It was the annual get-together that I generally have for all those whom I have played with right from school, college, club, and Ranji Trophy level, so it was also such a wonderful evening. I can't be thankful enough to God almighty to have the opportunity to have a get-together and celebrate all three occasions with all my family and friends. Normally, it is Milind and Anil Joshi (Gavaskar’s old friend) who organise everything, but this time I’m thankful to Anil for organising the party. We missed Milind Rege, Abdul bhai Ismail, my skipper ‘Papa’ Karkhanis, ‘Paddy’ Shivalkar, and Dilip Doshi. We also missed some others who couldn’t make it.”As usual, Gavaskar's party didn't have any speeches or loud music, just some precious anecdotes that went perfectly with the alcohol and some highly delicious food that was served right through the evening.","Cricket legend Sunil Gavaskar's annual party finally happened on Sunday night.

Poll Which match are you most excited about in the final round? Caruana vs Gukesh Praggnanandhaa vs Aronian So vs Abdusattorov

The penultimate round of the 2025 Sinquefield Cup delivered drama but left the standings at the top unchanged. GMs Fabiano Caruana and Praggnanandhaa Rameshbabu remain joint leaders heading into the final round, while GM Nodirbek Abdusattorov finally broke through with his first victory of the tournament.World No. 2 Caruana safely held a draw with GM Maxime Vachier-Lagrave in a balanced Ruy Lopez, a result that suited both players. Caruana stayed on top of the leaderboard, while Vachier-Lagrave all but secured qualification for the upcoming Grand Chess Tour Finals. Despite lamenting missed opportunities earlier in the event, the Frenchman remains unbeaten and in solid form.Praggnanandhaa also shared the point, against GM Wesley So, in a finely played Italian Game. So introduced a key improvement in the Two Knights Defense, neutralising White’s pressure. Though Praggnanandhaa probed slightly in the rook-and-knight endgame, So defended accurately to hold the balance.The biggest story of the day came from Abdusattorov, who punished GM Alireza Firouzja in a roller-coaster battle.The Uzbek No. 1 declined an early draw repetition, pressed for advantage, and capitalised when Firouzja miscalculated in the late middlegame. Firouzja, who has now suffered three losses, fell out of contention for the Finals. Abdusattorov, meanwhile, described the tournament as “the most difficult of my career” but said he hopes to come back stronger from the experience.World champion Gukesh Dommaraju pressed hard against GM Levon Aronian in a Queen’s Indian, seizing the initiative early and pushing for victory deep into the endgame. Aronian defended resourcefully, and although Gukesh still had winning chances, a late slip allowed Aronian to escape. The draw leaves both players just half a point behind the leaders.Elsewhere, GM Sam Sevian and GM Jan-Krzysztof Duda split the point after a near-perfectly played Italian, demonstrating precision that computer engines later assessed at 99% accuracy.Heading into the decisive final round, Caruana faces Gukesh with White in a heavyweight clash, while Praggnanandhaa takes on Aronian with the Black pieces. Wesley So, also in striking distance, will look to challenge against Abdusattorov. With multiple contenders still alive, the Sinquefield Cup title remains wide open and promises a thrilling conclusion.",GMs Fabiano Caruana and Praggnanandhaa Rameshbabu remain joint leaders heading into the final round.

Poll Will Kuldeep Yadav play a significant role in the upcoming Asia Cup? Definitely, he will shine Unlikely, due to competition

Former India cricketer Aakash Chopra has pointed out that Gautam Gambhir ’s approach as coach places greater value on bowlers who can contribute with the bat, a factor he feels has impacted Kuldeep Yadav ’s opportunities.“One thing stands out in Gautam’s coaching, he values bowlers who can bat. Sundar, Shardul, and Jadeja have seen more responsibility. Sometimes you feel that Kuldeep Yadav is getting left out because of that, but I am sure he would have a role when they play at home,” Chopra said on his YouTube channel.He added that senior all-rounders like Ravindra Jadeja have been entrusted with significant responsibility in recent series, further underlining Gambhir’s strategy.Kuldeep, India’s lone specialist spinner in the squad for the England Test series, did not feature in any of the five matches during the series in England. The left-arm wrist-spinner, who has only one Test appearance in the country so far, was expected to play a bigger role given his improved red-ball form. Despite strong backing from several experts, he was one of three players, alongside Arshdeep Singh and Abhimanyu Easwaran, who did not get a game.The 29-year-old is part of India’s squad for the upcoming Asia Cup beginning September 9, where he could get another chance to make his mark. Off the field, Kuldeep recently shared a picture with his fiancée Vanshika on Instagram. The couple, who got engaged on June 4 in Lucknow in the presence of close family and friends, are likely to marry later this year.For now, as Chopra suggested, Kuldeep may need to wait for home conditions to play a larger role in Gambhir’s plans.",Former India cricketer Aakash Chopra says Gautam Gambhir places greater value on bowlers who can contribute with the bat.

NEW DELHI: Former India cricketer Balvinder Singh Sandhu has come out in defence of fast bowler Jasprit Bumrah amid criticism over workload management, after the BCCI announced that Bumrah would not feature in all five Tests against England. The 1983 World Cup winner backed Bumrah following backlash over his absence despite India trailing 1-2 in the series.Sandhu pointed to the physical demands of fast bowling and called out the double standards of targeting bowlers while batsmen often take breaks unnoticed.""In these seven years, how many batsmen have gone without injury breaks? How many have opted out of a series quietly? Nobody really questions them. But when it comes to a fast bowler, everyone seems ready to pounce. The truth is — fast bowling is brutal,"" Sandhu wrote in his Mid-Day column.He also shared eye-opening statistics on pacers’ workload over the past seven years.""I was stunned when I saw these numbers. Jasprit Bumrah has had an average rest of just 3.2 days for every playing day across the last seven years, while Mohammed Siraj has had 3.5 days, and Mohammed Shami , 3.7. And remember — both Bumrah and Shami have also missed matches because of injuries.That only makes these statistics even more telling,"" he noted.Former cricketer Mohammed Kaif too has supported Bumrah’s return to the T20I format in the upcoming Asia Cup squad.Kaif defended him after a mixed showing in England, where fitness issues hampered Bumrah during the fourth Test in Manchester.Bumrah’s T20I comeback comes after more than a year of focusing on red-ball cricket, including tours of Australia and England. Across those series, he picked up 32 wickets in Australia and 14 wickets in three Tests in England, including two five-wicket hauls.However, his struggles with the new ball and fitness concerns in Manchester have reignited the debate over workload management and his readiness for the Asia Cup.",Former India cricketer Balvinder Singh Sandhu has come out in defence of fast bowler Jasprit Bumrah amid criticism over workload management.

West Indies all-rounder Romario Shepherd pulled off an ubelievable feat in the Caribbean Premier League (CPL) 2025, smashing 22 runs off one legal delivery during Guyana Amazon Warriors’ clash against St Lucia Kings at the Daren Sammy National Cricket Stadium, St Lucia, on Wednesday.Shepherd, who turned out for Royal Challengers Bengaluru in IPL 2025, hammered an unbeaten 73 off 34 balls. Despite his fireworks, the Warriors’ 202-run total proved insufficient as the Kings overhauled the target with 11 balls remaining.The most astonishing moment of the night unfolded in the 15th over of the Warriors’ innings. Oshane Thomas, brought into the attack, completely lost his hold over the over. His third delivery of the over had to be bowled five times after a series of no-balls and a wide.Each error proved costly. The first free hit was dispatched for six over deep mid-wicket, followed by another towering strike over square leg on the next free hit. Thomas then overstepped again, and Shepherd continued the punishment, putting the ball beyond the boundary once more.When Thomas finally managed a legal delivery on his fifth attempt, the result was no different. Shepherd sent it sailing over the roof at deep square leg.In all, the over cost 33 runs, with Iftikhar Ahmed adding another six off its final ball.Shepherd’s clean hitting lifted the Warriors beyond 200, but the Kings’ reply was ruthless. Opener Ackeem Auguste led the chase with a blistering 73 off 35 balls, ensuring the side crossed the 100-run mark inside 10 overs. The target was overhauled in just 18.1 overs, sealing a commanding victory.For Shepherd, the innings added another explosive chapter to his reputation as a power-hitter. Yet, on a night where he achieved the rare milestone of 22 runs from a single ball, the spotlight ultimately belonged to the Kings’ successful chase.","Guyana Amazon Warriors were bowled out for 202 by Saint Lucia Kings.

Poll Do you believe Ashwin will be successful in other international franchise leagues? Yes, he has the skills No, he should retire

It was the summer of 2023 and Ravichandran Ashwin had just completed 100 Tests and 500 Test wickets. He was still a Rajasthan Royals player and during a felicitation at the Tamil Nadu Cricket Association ahead of the Indian Premier League (IPL) season, the legendary offie said, “I wasn’t quite a name when Chennai Super Kings had picked me as uncapped player way back in 2009. I owe a lot to the franchise. One day I want to come back and play here again.”It’s fitting that Ashwin played his last IPL game for CSK, at the Arun Jaitley Stadium in New Delhi against Rajasthan Royals in May earlier this year.On Thursday, he announced his decision to retire from IPL. “They say every ending will have a new start. My time as an IPL cricketer comes to a close today, but my time as an explorer of the game around various leagues begins today. Would like to thank all the franchisees for all the wonderful memories and relationships over the years and most importantly the IPL and the BCCI for what they have given me until now. Look forward to enjoying and making the most of what’s ahead of me,” Ashwin said in a statement.The 38-year-old has been playing Tamil Nadu Premier League for Dindigul Dragons, and the implications are that he may look to play in franchisee leagues (Big Bash, SA T20, Hundred and CPL) across the world.In fact, he has already expressed his intention of playing The Hundred and with the SA T20 coming up, there will be anticipation who picks him up.Ashwin had got only nine games last season playing for CSK, taking seven wickets and going for an economy rate of 9.12, which didn’t exactly meet the standards that he had set for himself over the years.He wouldn’t have been retained by the franchise for the next IPL. The offie, who had retired from international cricket midway through the Australia series earlier this year, understood that his time in cut-throat cricket was probably up.While Ashwin is regarded as one of India’s Test legends, it wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that he took his first big step in the IPL, before he had made his debut in the longest format.In the Champions League T20 in South Africa in 2010, the offie was asked to bowl a Super Over in a group game against Victoria, where he couldn’t defend 24 runs. Such a blow could have shattered many young bowlers, but not Ashwin. He fought back, became Man of the Series in that tournament, and it convinced MS Dhoni about his strong temperament.And a few months later, after he removed a red-hot Chris Gayle in the 2011 IPL final at Chepauk to set up CSK’s title win, Ashwin had become one of CSK’s go-to bowlers. It was no surprise that in six months' time, he was playing his first Test for India.The offie was part of the CSK set-up till 2015 - one of their most successful phases - before moving out. He went on to play for Pune Super Giants, led Punjab Kings in 2018 and 2019, and did well for Delhi Capitals and Rajasthan Royals, before returning to CSK.During his stint as Punjab captain in 2019, Ashwin's decision to effect ‘Mankading’ on Jos Buttler created quite a 'spirit of cricket' stir. Ashwin stuck to his point that he was perfectly justified in doing what he did and consequently, the removal of the term Mankading by ICC vindicated the spinner's conviction.With 187 wickets and an economy rate of 7.2, Ashwin, with his bag of tricks, remained one the best spinners in IPL history over a period 17 years. The fact that his last scalp in IPL was new superstar in the making Vaibhav Suryavanshi proves that he still had the smarts. Just that the body might not have been obeying the orders.","Ravichandran Ashwin has announced his retirement from the Indian Premier League.

NEW DELHI: Big moment for the Sehwag household—Virender Sehwag’s elder son Aaryavir took his first step into competitive senior cricket with a debut in the Delhi Premier League (DPL). Turning out for Central Delhi Kings, the 17-year-old walked out to open the batting, a role his father so famously excelled in for India.The teenager began cautiously, managing just a single from his first four deliveries. But soon, he found rhythm against international pacer Navdeep Saini. Aaryavir struck back-to-back boundaries in the same over, the first a crisp drive through deep extra cover, followed by another between extra cover and long-off. Those strokes briefly lit up the innings, offering glimpses of his natural timing and confidence.In the over bowled by Rounak Waghela, he repeated the feat, dispatching two consecutive boundaries. However, his promising start was cut short in the same over, when he mistimed a shot and offered a catch to Mayank Rawat. Aaryavir departed for 22 runs off 16 balls, but the cameo was enough to draw attention to his fearless approach on debut.Away from the field, Aaryavir also shared a cherished childhood memory connected with his father’s playing days. In a video recently posted by Delhi Capitals on social media, he recalled how he once missed seeing his father bat in the IPL because of Delhi’s notorious traffic.“Earliest memory... I feel that all the matches that used to happen in Delhi, we used to go watch those matches mostly. Especially when dad used to play for Delhi Daredevils,” Aaryavir said. “My first memory is that Dad was playing in Delhi. Unfortunately, he got out very early, even before we were able to reach the stadium. There’s a lot of traffic in Delhi during the IPL and he got out before we could reach the stadium.”Though a humorous recollection, the incident also underscored the admiration he carries for his father. Growing up in a cricketing environment, he and his younger brother often played with plastic bats and balls, inspired by watching Sehwag in action. “From childhood, I had the habit of playing with plastic bat and ball. Me and my brother, we played a lot of cricket growing up, because that’s what we saw, seeing dad play,” he shared.Now, as he takes his first steps in professional cricket, Aaryavir admits his perspective has changed. “As I am playing professional cricket for the last 2-3 years, I am slowly understanding what kind of player my dad was,” he reflected.He also recalled one of Sehwag’s favourite sayings: “Ghar ki murgi dal barabar” (Home-cooked chicken seems as good as dal). But Aaryavir politely disagreed. “It’s not like that. As I’m playing, I’m understanding a lot about him and how great of a player he was. I really idolize him. Watching him, you feel that the things he’s done aren’t easy. I get a lot of inspiration and motivation from him.”Sehwag’s own career remains etched in Indian cricket history. Known for his fearless strokeplay, he was the first Indian to score a triple century in Tests and once held the record for the highest individual score in ODIs. For Aaryavir, carrying forward the Sehwag legacy has only just begun.","Aaryavir Sehwag makes debut for Central Delhi Kings in the Delhi Premier League.

England pacer Mark Wood is aiming to make his comeback in county cricket next month after spending more than six months on the sidelines with a knee injury.The 35-year-old has not featured since February, when swelling in his knee forced him out of contention for the Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy against India. Wood admitted he was close to regaining fitness but suffered a setback that prolonged his absence.“It was 50/50 whether I was going to make the India Test, but I was bowling at Lord's and then, the next day, my knee swelled up again,” Wood revealed on the Stick to Cricket podcast. “I had it drained, and since then, it's just been about taking things easy, looking ahead to the winter.”The quick, who last played Test cricket a little over a year ago, is now targeting appearances in his county’s September fixtures against Essex, Worcestershire and Yorkshire. “I'm hoping to play for Durham as there are a couple of games in September, so I'll try and play one or two of those,” he said.Wood emphasised that England’s management have prioritised caution with his recovery, keeping the Ashes series in Australia later this year firmly in sight. “I've been well looked after and very cautious, that's the way that it's been. I value it as [England] have got this end game where they want me to get to Australia,” he added.Looking ahead, Wood also spoke about his preparations for the five-match series, beginning in Perth on November 21. “I said to (Brendon) McCullum, I can't just bowl to a net for four months, I'll go insane. There's a bowling camp in Loughborough in a tent – getting acclimatised there, ready for Perth – then I'll go over to Perth early with a couple of bowlers.”Wood has 41 wickets against Australia in 11 Tests at 27.48, including a memorable 14-wicket haul in the 2023 home series.

The BCCI and Sehwag also drew sharp criticism from sections of fans for their association with the promotional campaign.The anger reflects the sensitive backdrop in which the tournament is set to be played, with cricket between India and Pakistan continuing to remain a highly polarising issue.Amid the storm, the cricketing side of the Asia Cup carries significant intrigue.The 2025 edition will be India’s first major multi-nation tournament without stalwarts Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma, both of whom retired from T20Is earlier this year after guiding India to back-to-back ICC titles — the 2024 T20 World Cup and the 2025 Champions Trophy.

Poll Is Mark Wood's strategy of mixing up deliveries effective against unpredictable batsmen like Rishabh Pant? Yes, definitely! No, that's risky.

England pacer Mark Wood has shed light on the challenge of bowling to India’s Rishabh Pant , admitting that the left-hander’s fearless style leaves bowlers with little room for error.Pant, known for his unpredictability and audacious hitting, has built a reputation for turning matches with his ability to attack even the best of bowlers. Wood, who has faced him in the past, said patience and control are the key to finding success against him.“I think you've got to hold your nerve. That's basically what I would say, because I think you have to be so unpredictable that it plays into his hands. He can just stand there and wait for anything difficult. But if you're the same all the time, then he's got such a good eye, he sort of hits it where he wants. So I think you've got to have a mixture of holding your nerve with maybe the odd ball that's a bit unpredictable — whether it's a slower ball, or you might change up with a really high bouncer, or something slightly different,” Wood explained.The 35-year-old, who has been sidelined for six months with a knee injury suffered at the Champions Trophy, has not played a Test in over a year but remains central to England’s Ashes plans later this year.While discussing difficult opponents, Wood also named Rohit Sharma as the toughest batter he has bowled to. “Rohit Sharma was difficult because against the short ball, you feel like you, for myself, I’ve got a chance of getting him out, but also if he’s on that day, he smokes it.So, he was difficult. I always felt like his bat was big, just kept getting wider,” he said.On Virat Kohli, Wood remarked: “Kohli, of course, unbelievable competitor. He seemed to have this weakness of fourth, fifth stump. He never seemed to miss when I bowled him there,” he added with a laugh.Both Rohit and Kohli announced their Test retirements earlier this year, shortly before England’s tour of India.",England pacer Mark Wood has explained how to dismiss Rishabh Pant.

India T20I vice-captain Shubman Gill is on road to complete recovery and is expected to check-in at the Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ) Centre of Excellence (CoE) in Bengaluru this week. It is reliably learnt that there was nothing alarming in his blood report and having recovered from the bout of viral flu, India's Test captain, who is in Mohali right now, is expected to return to full tilt training soon.The illness didn't allow the 25-year-old to participate in the opening round of the Duleep Trophy, starting July 28. In his absence, Haryana's Ankit Kumar, the original vice-captain, will lead North Zone vs East Zone. The CoE is buzzing with activity for the last few weeks as many contracted cricketers have been in and out of the facility for their regular fitness assessment.This also features some players who are part of various Duleep Trophy squads and also the ones who recently featured in the five Tests vs England. The likes of Kuldeep Yadav , Arshdeep Singh, Sai Sudharsan have been doing their routine fitness, and it's further understood that Mohammed Siraj, who has been resting after the gruelling series, will also be taking the flight to Bengaluru soon.Nitish Kumar Reddy is also camped at the CoE, recovering from the injury he had picked during the England series, and the all-rounder is still some time away from regaining complete match fitness.Earlier this month, Hardik Pandya had undergone assessment at the CoE and the premier all-rounder is currently training in Baroda for the last few days ahead of the Asia Cup to be held in the UAE next month.

England fast bowler Mark Wood has revealed that India batter Rohit Sharma stands out as the most challenging batter he has faced in his career.The 35-year-old pacer, who is renowned for his ability to consistently bowl at speeds in excess of 145 kmph, recalled how Rohit’s command against the short ball made him particularly difficult to dismiss.“Rohit Sharma was difficult because against the short ball, you feel like, for myself, I’ve got a chance of getting him out, but also if he’s on that day, he smokes it. So, he was difficult.

NEW DELHI: Cancer has touched the lives of several cricketers across generations, testing their courage in ways no opponent on the field ever could. The latest reminder of this ongoing battle came from former Australia captain Michael Clarke, who revealed that he has undergone his sixth surgery for skin cancer.The 44-year-old, who led Australia to the 2015 ODI World Cup title, shared a post-operative picture on Instagram, urging fans to take preventive measures seriously. Clarke’s message was simple but powerful: “Skin cancer is real! Especially in Australia. Another one cut out of my nose today. A friendly reminder to get your skin checked. Prevention is better than cure but in my case, regular check ups and early detection is key. ”Clarke was first diagnosed with skin cancer in 2006 during his playing career and has since endured multiple procedures. In 2019, he had three non-melanoma lesions removed, including one from his forehead. Four years later, in 2023, he needed 27 stitches after a basal cell carcinoma was excised from his chest.That experience prompted him to join hands with the Australian Skin Cancer Foundation to spread awareness in a country where sun exposure-related illnesses are widespread.His most recent surgery, this time to remove a lesion from his nose, underscores how the disease requires vigilance and persistence. Clarke has used his platform to remind fans and fellow cricketers that early detection and preventive checks can save lives.Clarke’s story resonates with the journey of another Australian icon, Richie Benaud. The legendary captain and commentator was diagnosed with skin cancer late in life, with lesions on his forehead and scalp.Just months after disclosing his condition, Benaud passed away on April 10, 2015. His openness about his illness highlighted the risks faced by athletes who spend long hours under the sun.Perhaps no cricketing tale of resilience has captured hearts like that of Yuvraj Singh. The 2011 World Cup hero delivered one of the greatest all-round performances in tournament history, scoring 362 runs and taking 15 wickets, all while battling serious health issues. Soon after lifting the trophy, he was diagnosed with a rare germ cell tumour in his lung.Yuvraj underwent aggressive chemotherapy in the USA, enduring months of pain, weakness, and mental stress. But his spirit shone through — he returned to international cricket in 2012, scripting one of sport’s most inspiring comeback stories. His fight against cancer continues to motivate countless people worldwide.Former England opener Geoffrey Boycott, renowned for his grit at the crease, displayed the same resilience when diagnosed with throat cancer in 2003. The news forced him to step away from commentary duties during India’s tour of England.Boycott underwent 35 sessions of radiotherapy and, true to form, staged a remarkable recovery. Within a year, he was back behind the microphone, proving that nothing could silence his voice.In 2010, while serving as England’s head coach, former Zimbabwe captain Andy Flower was diagnosed with skin cancer on his right cheek.Surgery ensured a full recovery, and since then, Flower has become one of the sport’s most prominent advocates for skin cancer awareness. His story serves as a reminder that vigilance and early intervention can make a decisive difference.South African batting great Graeme Pollock faced colorectal cancer in 2013. Though he overcame the illness physically, it took a heavy financial toll.By 2014, Pollock was on the brink of bankruptcy, struggling to keep up with mortgage payments. With little support from cricketing bodies, he organised a benefit dinner attended by stars like Graeme Smith, Shaun Pollock, and Mike Procter, which provided some relief. His ordeal revealed how health battles can extend well beyond the medical fight.New Zealand’s elegant batsman Martin Crowe announced in 2012 that he had been diagnosed with lymphoma. Though he initially responded well to treatment and even returned to public life, the cancer resurfaced in 2014.Despite a brave fight, Crowe passed away in 2016, aged just 53. His story remains one of cricket’s most poignant reminders of how fragile life can be, even for its greatest warriors.In 2022, England wicketkeeper-batter Sam Billings underwent two operations to remove a malignant melanoma from his chest. His condition was detected after he attended a skin cancer screening in Kent, highlighting the importance of proactive checks.Since then, Billings has spoken openly about the dangers of skin cancer, urging fans and fellow athletes to be mindful of early signs and preventive care.","Former Australia captain Michael Clarke has undergone his sixth surgery for skin cancer.

Poll Who was the standout player for Manchester Originals in their last match? James Anderson Jos Buttler Thomas Aspinwall

James Anderson added another chapter to his remarkable career on Tuesday, showing that age is no barrier to his class. The 43-year-old seamer, turning out for Manchester Originals in The Hundred, struck twice inside his first nine deliveries to dismantle Northern Superchargers’ top order.Having gone wicketless in his two earlier outings this season, Anderson made his mark in his side’s final fixture. His first breakthrough came against Dawid Malan, the former No. 1 T20I batter, who miscued an attempted slog and was caught comfortably by wicketkeeper Jos Buttler.Dan Lawrence tried to counter-attack, striking consecutive boundaries off the veteran pacer, but Anderson had the last word. He pinned Lawrence lbw the very next ball to claim his second wicket. Anderson returned with figures of 2 for 30 and, in doing so, became the oldest Englishman to take a wicket in The Hundred. Only South Africa’s Imran Tahir has achieved the feat at an older age.Manchester’s bowling effort was also boosted by Thomas Aspinwall, who picked up three wickets. Superchargers were restricted to 139 for 8 in their 100-ball allocation.In reply, Buttler led from the front with a fluent 70 off 37 deliveries. His innings ensured that the Originals crossed the target with 16 balls to spare.Despite the convincing win, Manchester’s campaign ended without a place in the play-offs.

PANAJI: The All India Football Federation (AIFF) is in danger of being suspended for the second time in three years if it fails to get its constitution ratified by October 30, according to a letter from FIFA, the governing body for world football, and the Asian Football Confederation (AFC).FIFA and AFC jointly sent a letter to AIFF president Kalyan Chaubey on Tuesday expressing ""profound concern” at the continued failure to finalise and implement the revised constitution, “a matter that has remained under consideration since proceedings before the Supreme Court of India in 2017.” Despite repeated assurances, the letter notes, “the absence of a clear and compliant governance framework has now created an untenable vacuum and legal uncertainties at the heart of Indian football. ”The letter has been signed by Elkhan Mammadov, FIFA’s chief member associations officer and Vahid Kardany, deputy general secretary, Member Associations, AFC.FIFA and AFC have given AIFF a deadline of October 30 to secure a definitive order from the Supreme Court approving the revised AIFF constitution, ensure full alignment with mandatory provisions of FIFA and AFC Statutes and regulations, and obtain formal ratification of the constitution at the next AIFF general body meeting.“Failure to meet this schedule will leave us with no alternative but to refer the matter to the relevant FIFA decision-making body for consideration and decision,” states the letter, reminding AIFF of its obligation to manage its affairs independently and without any undue third-party influence, including government bodies.Failure to adhere to this obligation, FIFA-AFC said, “may result in sanctions outlined in the FIFA and AFC Statutes, including the possibility of suspension.”A member association can face consequences for third-party influence, even if it is not directly at fault (cf. article 14 paragraph 3 of the FIFA Statutes and article 10 paragraph 1 (t) and 2 of the AFC Statutes). A suspension of the AIFF would result in the loss of all of its rights as a FIFA and AFC member, as defined in the FIFA and AFC Statutes.FIFA had suspended India on Aug 16, 2022, for third-party influence because a Supreme Court appointed committee of administrators was running the federation. The ban was lifted ten days later, paving the way for elections where Chaubey was elected as president.Chaubey has now been asked to present the FIFA-AFC letter to the Supreme Court and inform the Union ministry of sports and youth affairs. “AIFF must regard this communication as binding and requiring immediate compliance in order to safeguard its rights as a member of FIFA and AFC,” the letter states.The matter of the AIFF constitution has been in Supreme Court since 2017.The Supreme Court has said that its judgment in the case concerning is “ready” but has deferred pronouncement to ensure that it was “in sync” with the recently enacted National Sports Act.“From our side, the judgment is ready. We just kept it to have a look at what will be the implication of the Act on it,” a Bench of Justices P.S.

Poll Do you agree with Borussia Dortmund's decision to restrict access to the dressing room area? Yes, it's necessary for professionalism. No, families should have access.

Borussia Dortmund have tightened their post-match rules by barring players’ families from the dressing room area following an incident involving Jobe Bellingham’s father at the weekend.Mark Bellingham, who also advises his son, had flown in from England to watch the 19-year-old’s Bundesliga debut away at St. Pauli on Saturday. Jobe, signed from Sunderland in a £32 million move this summer, started the game but was taken off at half-time by coach Niko Kovac.According to reports in Germany, Mark Bellingham waited in the tunnel after full-time and questioned sporting director Sebastian Kehl about the decision. He was said to be upset both by his son’s withdrawal and Dortmund’s collapse, with the team surrendering a 3-1 lead to draw 3-3.There were reports also that Bellingham senior sought a direct meeting with Kovac and “made no secret of his opinion.” Some players are also understood to have noticed his frustration in the restricted area.On Sunday, however, Dortmund managing director Lars Ricken played down the matter, while confirming that new restrictions will now apply. “We got Jobe Bellingham because we really built a relationship of trust with the parents over the years. Now the family flew in especially for their son’s first Bundesliga game and wanted to meet Jobe after the game,” Ricken told Sky90 – The Football Debate“They stood in the hallway to the locker room and had an emotional conversation with Sebastian, which, however, is not a problem at all given this relationship. In the future though, we will ensure that players, coaches, and any officials have access to the locker room area, so that we no longer get into trouble by commenting on such news.

BENGALURU: There is more light at the end of the tunnel with regard to the start of this season's Indian Super League as the All India Football Federation (AIFF) and Football Sports Development Limited (FSDL) concluded a crucial meeting here on Monday.""Both parties approached the discussions in a constructive and positive spirit and expressed confidence in arriving at a mutually agreed proposal that will ensure the continued development and progress of football in India,” AIFF said in a statement. “The joint proposal will be submitted before the Supreme Court on Aug 28,” the AIFF said,adding that the parties will make no further comment as the matter is sub-judice.Meanwhile, sources told TOI that the two parties will meet again in the coming days to finalize the proposal that will be presented in the court. They said that FSDL has agreed to start the season and run it for another year. “As per the master agreement FSDL has to pay Rs 25 crore to AIFF till Dec this year. For the remainder of the season, the AIFF wants Rs 25 crore matching last year's payment but FSDL is bargaining for a lesser payment in the tune of Rs 10-15 crore,"" they said.Sources said the latest and most constructive negotiations would likely see the ISL kick starting in OctoberNovember, almost a two month delay compared to last season, with I-league winners Inter Kashi making their debut as the 14th team.“There were talks of holding the Super Cup before the start of ISL but that looks like a non-starter with six of the 13 teams yet to begin their operations this season. The expected scenario could be a 6-8 weeks pre-season followed by the start of the league in OctNov,” they said.Experts who tracked the developments also said the ISL could even be beamed on a new platform. ""Last year it was on Jio-Hotstar but there are talks to find new takers to telecast the ISL for the coming season. But it is still not clear whether there will be buyers for any short-term offer,"" they added.Sources also said it is only a matter of time before the new agreement is finalised. “The new turn of events came only after the clubs and few players approached the court through the amicus curiae. What is in front of both parties is simple. They have to ensure the minimum number of matches as prescribed by the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) for the clubs to be eligible to play in AFC competitions.

This is just preparation (tournament) and we have enough time (for the AFC qualification matches against Singapore).”“The players know that when they go inside, they have to have belief.

Liverpool secured a dramatic 3-2 victory against Newcastle with a 100th-minute winner from 16-year-old Rio Ngumoha, after squandering a two-goal advantage against 10-man Newcastle in Monday's Premier League match.Liverpool's Ryan Gravenberch and Hugo Ekitike scored goals, with Anthony Gordon receiving a red card for a dangerous tackle on Virgil van Dijk between these strikes.Newcastle mounted a comeback at St. James' Park through goals from Bruno Guimaraes and William Osula, but Ngumoha's late strike, making him Liverpool's youngest-ever goalscorer, sealed the win.""This is also what makes the Premier League special. Maybe it wasn't the best game in terms of tactics or in terms of playing football , but I think every fan everywhere around the world enjoyed watching this game of football,"" said Liverpool manager Arne Slot.Liverpool now shares maximum points from two games with Tottenham and Arsenal, with the latter scheduled to visit Anfield on Sunday. Newcastle remain winless as they continue without Alexander Isak, their key striker.Isak previously scored the winning goal when these teams met in the League Cup final in March, helping Newcastle secure their first domestic trophy in 70 years.The Swedish striker has not played for Newcastle this season as he seeks to leave the club.Liverpool appear to be the likely destination for Isak before the transfer window closes in a week.Newcastle rejected Liverpool's £110 million bid, as they seek a British transfer record fee of £150 million. Newcastle's frustration increased as Liverpool also succeeded in signing Ekitike, whom Newcastle had identified as a potential replacement for Isak.Newcastle's striker shortage was evident in their season opener, a goalless draw against 10-man Aston Villa. The issue persisted during the first 30 minutes of this match, despite Newcastle's dominant play supported by over 50,000 fans.Liverpool took an unexpected lead after 35 minutes through Gravenberch's precise long-range shot. Newcastle's situation worsened when Gordon received a red card for a late tackle on Van Dijk before halftime.Liverpool doubled their lead just 20 seconds into the second half through Ekitike's composed finish from Gakpo's assist. Newcastle's protests intensified when Ibrahima Konate avoided a second yellow card for pushing Harvey Barnes.Guimaraes, despite receiving a booking for protesting, scored for Newcastle with a header past Milos Kerkez. Liverpool failed to capitalize on their numerical advantage throughout the second half.Osula, who had limited playing time under Howe, scored his second Premier League goal from Dan Burn's assist to level the match. The game concluded with Liverpool's decisive counter-attack, as Salah's pass and Szoboszlai's dummy set up Ngumoha for the winning goal just before his 17th birthday.","Liverpool beat Newcastle 3-2 in Premier League match at St. James' Park.

What’s common between the three Formula E world champions

How the three World Champions fared in Formula E Season 11

Days after Oliver Rowland lifted his Formula E World Championship trophy in London this season, an interesting trend has come to the attention of Formula E and its fans. As a coincidence, all Formula E drivers who won the Mexico City E-Prix went on to win the Formula E World Championship that season, and this has been proved right for three consecutive years.Highlighting the same since 2023, a poster of three World Champions was shared on X by Formula E with the caption, “The trend continues. Each winner of the #MexicoCityEPrix from the past three seasons has gone on to become World Champion.”The special poster features 2023 Formula E World Champion Jake Dennis from Andretti, then TAG Heuer Porsche’s Pascal Wehrlein, who won in 2024, and the new World Champion, Nissan driver Oliver Rowland. All three of them won in the Mexico E-Prix and went on to lift the winner’s trophy in the Formula E World Championship that year.Oliver Rowland had strengthened his chances of winning the Formula E World Championship this year much earlier. He was leading the Formula E Driver Standings ever since he won Part 2 of the Jeddah E-Prix, which was his second win of the season after winning the Mexico E-Prix. In the last leg, the Nissan driver got nervous for a while as Pascal Wehrlein, who was following him in the number two position, closed the gap after grabbing quite a few podiums while Rowland had a dull period.Things became serious for Rowland when he failed to finish the Round 13 race in Berlin, while Wehrlein won second spot on the podium. But he eventually managed to confirm his championship in Berlin after four wins and three more podiums.Sharing about his bad race in Berlin, Rowland had said, “I was hoping before the weekend that the outcome could be [the World Championship], but after yesterday (Saturday) and this morning (Sunday), I was more worried that it might never come.”Also Read: Oliver Rowland reacts to daughter’s sweet radio message after Formula E Championship win: “It’s amazing” Things, however, changed for Wehrlein, who was pushed to third position after Nick Cassidy made a late entry in the Formula E Driver Standings by registering three consecutive wins.

Wehrlein registered one win and five more podiums this season.Meanwhile, Andretti driver Jake Dennis finished in seventh position in the Formula E Driver Standings.

Taylor Barnard on losing top three spot in Formula E World Championship

Fans hail Taylor Barnard for his fantastic rookie season

It was Taylor Barnard’s rookie season this year, and the NEOM McLaren driver put up a fantastic performance by temporarily making it to the top three in the Formula E Driver Standings by ousting the much more experienced Porsche driver Antonio Felix Da Costa.

Finishing P4 in the Drivers’ Championship and coming into the final weekend with a shot at runner-up is something to be proud of.”Also adding a note for teammate Sam Bird, as NEOM McLaren withdrew from Formula E after the end of the season, Barnard wrote, “@sambird_official it wasn’t the weekend you deserved either.You’ve been a huge part of my season both on and off the track, and I’m grateful for everything. You deserved more. To all the Papaya fans, thank you for the incredible support in our final race together. You always go above and beyond. ”Reacting to his post, a fan wrote, “An incredible debut season, huge congrats and excited to see where you go next!” Another said, “I know I said it the other day, but you’ve been incredible to watch this last year and a pleasure to support you in Papaya — there are many of us that can’t wait to support you in whatever you do next!” One more commented, “You were incredible all season around, Taylor.

We couldn’t have done it without you all — your trust and support have never been taken for granted,” he added.Praising the two McLaren drivers, he wrote, “Sam clinched McLaren’s first-ever fully electric win at the São Paulo E-Prix in Season 10, pulling off one of Formula E’s all-time great overtakes, before being waved across the line by none other than Emerson Fittipaldi – McLaren's first Formula 1 World Champion. While Taylor has been a rookie sensation in Season 11, securing five Formula E records, including the youngest driver to start a race, the youngest points scorer, the youngest driver to lead a lap, the youngest podium finisher, and the youngest polesitter. ”He ended the letter saying, “Some of us have been together since the day we first launched this team, while others have seamlessly fitted in along the way and flourished within the environment we have cultivated. For many, I am sure that we will cross paths again soon, but whatever the future holds for those here at Bicester, whatever path they choose to follow, I have no doubt that it will be bright.

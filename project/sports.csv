'I'm the happiest that way': Washington Sundar reacts to his Team India role after Day 3 in Guwahati

Poll Do you think India's Test team is missing Virat Kohli's leadership? Yes, absolutely No, they need to move on

NEW DELHI: Former Royal Challengers Bengaluru wicketkeeper-batter Shreevats Goswami has ignited a fresh debate around India's leadership and direction in red-ball cricket, saying the team desperately misses the “energy and belief” that defined Virat Kohli 's era. His remarks came as India suffered yet another batting implosion against South Africa in the second Test in Guwahati.In a strongly worded post on X, Goswami said Kohli's retirement from Tests came too soon and the format “misses him” far more than ODIs.""Ideally Virat should have left playing ODIs & continued playing Test cricket until he had nothing to give. Test cricket misses him. Not just as a player but just the energy he brought, the love & passion playing for India where he made the team believe that they can win in any condition,"" he wrote as India faltered once again at home.His comments reflect the growing frustration around India's red-ball slide. After a shocking series defeat to New Zealand last year, the Rishabh Pant-led side now faces the prospect of another home series loss — this time to South Africa, who haven't won a Test series in India since 2000.On the field, towering left-arm quick Marco Jansen produced a devastating spell of 6/48 to bowl India out for 201, giving South Africa complete command.India, replying to 489, crumbled to 122/7 before Washington Sundar and Kuldeep Yadav briefly resisted, but the damage had long been done.With South Africa ending day three at 26/0 and extending their overall lead to 314, India are staring at a fifth home defeat in seven Tests — a stark contrast to the invincible aura once associated with Kohli's reign.As Goswami's post continues to gain traction, it echoes a sentiment that many fans and former players now share: India's Test team looks adrift, and the void left by Kohli feels bigger than ever.",Former Royal Challengers Bengaluru wicketkeeper-batter Shreevats Goswami has ignited a fresh debate around India's leadership and direction in red-ball cricket.

India ODI squad: Bizarre selection calls, no explanation and no logic

Former India captain and former head coach Ravi Shastri pulled no punches as he criticised India’s first-innings batting approach during the second Test against South Africa in Guwahati. India, who have experimented with multiple players at the number 3 slot in recent times, raised eyebrows again when Washington Sundar was promoted to that position in the opening Test. For the second match, Sai Sudharsan returned to the XI and reclaimed the spot, pushing Sundar all the way down to number 8.The reshuffle did little to help India’s cause. Their batting faltered once more, and the side folded for 201 in response to South Africa’s commanding 489.Speaking on commentary for the Star network, Shastri strongly questioned the team’s planning and clarity.“Absolutely not. It makes no sense. I can’t figure out the reasoning. When they review this series, some of these selections will leave them puzzled. In Kolkata you picked four spinners and one of them bowled only a single over, when you could’ve easily picked a specialist batter. And here, after making Washington bat at three in the last Test, you could’ve slotted him at four today since you already had your number three. He’s not a number eight. He’s much better than that,” the former all-rounder remarked.Despite the chaos at the top, Sundar and Kuldeep Yadav did put up a fight, adding 72 valuable runs for the eighth wicket after India had slumped to 122 for 7 at the Barsapara Stadium. Their resistance helped India scrape past 200, but the deficit still ballooned to a massive 288.Sundar fell for a gritty 48 off 92 deliveries, while Kuldeep hung in for 19 off 134 balls.For South Africa, Marco Jansen dominated with the ball, returning outstanding figures of 6 for 48. Simon Harmer supported him well with a three-wicket haul for 64.","Former India captain and former head coach Ravi Shastri criticised India's first-innings batting approach during the second Test against South Africa in Guwahati.

Shubman Gill update: India Test, ODI captain gets a comeback plan from the BCCI

Young wicketkeeper-batter Dhruv Jurel has found himself under pressure after a rough outing in the second Test against South Africa in Guwahati. With captain Shubman Gill ruled out, Jurel was pushed into the No. 4 role, a position long associated with giants of Indian batting such as Sachin Tendulkar and Virat Kohli , and one that Gill had handled confidently during the England and South Africa series.But the promotion did not go to plan. Walking in under pressure, Jurel lasted 11 balls before being dismissed for a duck, adding to India’s already troubled batting display. The shot that led to his dismissal has become the main talking point. Trying to pull Keshav Maharaj, Jurel looked hesitant and his footwork never settled. The result was a mistimed hit that travelled straight to wide mid-on.Former India wicketkeeper Parthiv Patel did not hold back in his assessment on Star Sports. He criticised the shot selection, calling it a moment where Jurel showed little control.“Even if Tea was far away, that shot still shouldn’t have been played. He is in the side as a batter because he has been scoring runs, but this was not a controlled shot at all,” Patel said. He explained that when a batter tries to hit a ball that is outside the right shoulder towards the leg side, it often goes aerial, which is exactly how Jurel fell.Patel also highlighted the significance of the No. 4 spot, reminding viewers that Tendulkar and Kohli dominated that role for years, and Gill has been doing the same recently.He further noted that Jurel had wasted yet another chance, especially against Marco Jansen, whose extra bounce is well known.“When you face Jansen, you must always account for the bounce because of his height. This is the third straight opportunity he has let slip. He is getting to bat at No. 4, where some of the biggest names in Indian cricket have batted, including Shubman Gill who has scored heavily there,” Patel added.","Young wicketkeeper-batter Dhruv Jurel has found himself under pressure after a rough outing in the second Test against South Africa in Guwahati.

Dharmendra Dies At 89; Bachchans, Aamir Khan, Salman Khan Pay Final Respects

Dharmendra's post on Siraj

NEW DELHI: Veteran Bollywood icon Dharmendra , who passed away on Monday at the age of 89 in Mumbai, is being remembered not only for his timeless films but also for his warmth, humility and deep affection for Indian sport. As tributes continue to pour in for the star of Sholay, Phool Aur Patthar and Chupke Chupke, an old post of him dedicated to India fast bowler Mohammed Siraj has resurfaced on social media, leaving fans emotional.Dharmendra, a passionate cricket follower, had hailed Siraj’s courage in January 2021, shortly after India’s historic Border-Gavaskar Trophy win in Australia. Siraj lost his father, Mohammed Ghouse, in November 2020 while serving a mandatory COVID-19 quarantine with the Indian team. Despite being given the option to return home, the then 26-year-old chose to stay back and fulfil his late father’s dream of watching him play Test cricket.Siraj went on to play three Tests in the four-match series and emerged as one of India’s leading wicket-takers on the tour with 13 wickets, playing a pivotal role in the 2-1 victory. Upon returning to Hyderabad, the pacer drove straight from the airport to the Khairatabad graveyard to pay respects at his father’s resting place — an image that deeply moved Dharmendra.Sharing Siraj's photo, the veteran actor wrote on X: “Siraj, Braveheart son of India… Naaz hai tujh par… dil par walid ki maut ka sadma liye tum watan ki aan ke liye match khelte rahe… aur ek unhoni jeet watan ke naam darj kar ke lote… Kal tujhe apne walid ki qabbr par dekh kar mun bhar aaya. Jannat naseeb ho unhein.”The post remains a poignant reminder of Dharmendra’s humanity beyond the screen. Meanwhile, Siraj is currently part of India’s Test squad against South Africa, with the hosts trailing 0-1 in the two-match series.","Veteran Bollywood icon Dharmendra passed away on Monday at the age of 89.

'I'm the happiest that way': Washington Sundar reacts to his Team India role after Day 3 in Guwahati

When South Africa batted, Kuldeep Yadav said the pitch felt like a “road”. In less than 24 hours, India discovered bumps and steep curves, hitherto unforeseen, on the same “road” at the Assam Cricket Association ground in Barsapara.By stumps on Day 3, the hosts were truly out of track to salvage the two-Test series against South Africa.The Indian batting horror show – one of the worst in recent memory – was facilitated by 6 feet 8 Marco Jansen, a familiar face on the IPL circuit.He generated a steep bounce that no Indian pacer did and with the injudiciousness of the top-order, led by skipper Rishabh Pant, the Indian batting collapsed like a pack of cards. From 95-1 at one stage with half an hour to go for the first break, India were reduced to 122-7 on either side of 11 am tea.Washington Sundar (48) and Kuldeep Yadav (19) resisted for 35 overs, but offie Simon Harmer (3-43) got the Tamil Nadu allrounder with one that left him. Jansen (6-48) polished off the rest of the tail and the 288-run lead all but sealed the fate of the game. With South Africa reaching 26-0 by the close of play after choosing not to enforce follow-on, all India can hope for is a draw.But that will need a miracle.Jansen, ahead of the day’s play, was seen having a chat with Dale Steyn . When Jansen told him that the Barsapara pitch felt a bit like SuperSport Park in Pretoria, in reference to the bit of up and down bounce, Steyn told his protégé to hit the pitch hard and try the cross-seam delivery.The 25-year-old tried to follow the master’s advice, even though the barren first spell was more traditional attacking-the-stump line which Yashasvi Jaiswal (58) and KL Rahul (22) negotiated. But both fell to spinners, Rahul nicking one off left-arm spinner Keshav Maharaj and Jaiswal unable to deal with the bounce that Harmer generated to be caught at point.Soon after, another failure by No. 3 Sai Sudharsan opened the floodgates and Jansen barged in. Jansen resorted to the short-ball tactic. In the last over before tea, Jurel, for reasons better known to him, tried to pull him. The mistimed shot was beautifully caught by Maharaj running back. Suddenly the score read 102-4.“With not much happening off the seam, I tried the short ball against Jurel and it worked. Then the team decided during the break to use this as a tactic,” Jansen explained.Little did the lanky pacer know that Pant, India’s best batter on paper, will be the first to fall for the short-ball trap immediately after the break. The way Pant tried to charge Jansen and nicked him gave one the feeling that he didn’t learn from the first two days of keeping that the pitch tends to get significantly easier when the ball gets old.Jansen celebrated Pant’s wicket. But when asked later in the day whether the Indian captain’s shot selection came as a pleasant surprise for him, the South African pacer defended the left-hander.“Pant and Jurel both are fantastic players of the short ball. On another day, the ball could easily have been sailing over my head into the stands. Batters have to find ways to score runs, sometimes you succeed, sometimes you don’t,” Jansen said.Nitish Reddy, who used to play Jansen regularly at the Sunrisers Hyderabad nets, looked like a fish out of water against the paceman. He failed to keep a snorter out and Aiden Markram completed a diving catch at third slip. “Reddy has often hit me 50 rows back into the stands during IPL practice,” Jansen said, but that hardly mattered on Monday.After Jansen demolished the Indian middle-order, Washington, batting once again at No. 8, and Kuldeep showed the team’s super seniors that there were not many devils in the pitch. They were ready to buy time, play the spinners with respect and tire out Jansen, something that Pant & Co. couldn’t. But with seven wickets already down, all they could do was delay the inevitable and their long-winding association of three hours yielded 72 runs, which was not enough.“We live on hope,” the ever-optimist Washington said at the end of day’s play. But he, too, can read the writing on the wall — another humiliating whitewash against a SENA team at home.",South Africa reach 26-0 by the close of play on Day 3 in Guwahati. India were reduced to 122-7 on either side of 11 am tea. Jansen (6-48) polished off the rest of the tail and the 288-run lead.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125553284,imgsize-298220,width-400,resizemode-4/guwahati-nov-24-ani-south-african-bowler-marco-jansen-aiden-markram-tony-d.jpg"

'I'm the happiest that way': Washington Sundar reacts to his Team India role after Day 3 in Guwahati

Twenty-five years ago, India lost two back-to-back Tests at home to South Africa. The first one was on a turner, the second on a perfectly good batting pitch where South Africa scored 479.By stumps on Day 3 at Barsapara here, the signs are that history will repeat itself. In that 2000 series, the Indian team, going through a transition with Sachin Tendulkar about to leave captaincy, did not cross the 250-mark even once. That may well happen again, with the hosts managing 189, 93 and 201 in the three innings so far.In 2000, India were still not sure who their next captain would be. A quarter of a century later, the problem is centred around their coach Gautam Gambhir and how he wants to conduct his team in Test cricket.But no discussion of the Monday debacle can start without Rishabh Pant ’s man-child carelessness with the bat. In his first Test as captain, his horribly injudicious charge — off just the eighth ball he faced — to Marco Jansen, who was in the middle of a dream spell, threw India’s chances of a fightback into the Brahmaputra.“On another day, the bowler would have gone into the stands and all of us would have appreciated and clapped. That’s how it is,” Washington Sundar’s defence of Pant at the close of play really sounded weak.While Pant’s dismissal was unquestionably the most glaring one on Monday, unnecessary chopping and changing by the management continues to haunt the team. Washington, who looked a perfect fit at No. 3 on a difficult track at Eden Gardens, was pushed down to No. 8 where he scored a patient 48, an innings worthy of a top-order player.No wonder, the question came flying in at the end of day’s play: “Do you prefer a permanent top-order batting slot instead of the different positions that you’ve batted in recently?”Washington deflected the query: “I will play wherever the team wants me to play. It’s a bit like football these days, a player can be effective even when he plays 25 or 30 minutes.”The guy who replaced Washy at No. 3, Sai Sudharsan, has been struggling in that position for a while now. In the nine Test innings that he has played, Sai has an average of 30.33 and his inability to keep his shots down on the on-side has led to his dismissal time and again. It was pretty much the same on Monday and it allowed South Africa to push open the door.Gambhir has completely forgotten about Sarfaraz Khan, who scored a battling century against New Zealand in Bengaluru last year but followed it up with failures in four innings where everyone else struggled. Left-hander Devdutt Padikkal has been travelling with the team for a while but hasn’t got a look-in since Perth Test last year — probably the off-spin that he delivers at the nets is still not up to scratch.Coach Gambhir believes in multiskilled players which is fine in theory, but when the results don’t come, the question needs to be asked: why such a dislike for specialists?In Shubman Gill’s absence, Dhruv Jurel was played at No. 4, while the next four (including Rishabh Pant) are allrounders. According to Indian spin legend Anil Kumble, all of them showed the lack of temperament to get themselves accustomed to the track and then do the damage.“I don’t see the application that is needed on a pitch like this. And the reluctance to use specialists is also surprising,” Kumble said during commentary for the official broadcasters.Nitish Reddy has been tagged an allrounder but all he bowled in the first innings was six overs out of 151. He then came into bat at No. 7 and failed to deal with the short ball that Marco Jansen produced.Sitanshu Kotak, the team batting coach, had blamed the Eden pitch for the debacle that they suffered. But Washington’s admission following the Barsapara first-innings debacle, may add a bit of salt to India’s wounds.“It was a true wicket. Not everyday will you get to bat on such tracks, especially in India. If you spend time there, runs are there for the taking.” Washington’s words underlined India’s poor performance on Monday.","India lost two back-to-back Tests at home to South Africa in 2000.

India ODI squad: Bizarre selection calls, no explanation and no logic

NEW DELHI: Former India spinner Anil Kumble criticised the batting performance after India conceded a 288-run first-innings lead to South Africa in the second Test on Monday, while former Proteas fast bowler Dale Steyn praised the visitors for controlling the match across three days.India were bowled out for 201 in reply to South Africa’s 489 . The collapse came on a pitch Kuldeep Yadav had described as a ""road"", with Marco Jansen taking 6 for 48 after scoring 93 on the second day.""I felt India’s batting effort was quite poor. The application and patience required in Test cricket were missing. While there were some good deliveries, the batsmen didn’t seem prepared to endure tough spells or play session by session,"" Kumble told JioStar, as cited by ANI.""It seemed like the aim was to chase runs quickly, which is unrealistic in a Test match where 489 runs need to be built gradually. Respecting the opposition bowlers and their spells is crucial, but India didn’t show enough of that resilience,"" he added.Kumble also highlighted Jansen’s role, saying, ""Marco Jansen bowled exceptionally well, putting India under consistent pressure. When he started bowling bouncers, which can be tricky given his height and awkward length, India appeared unprepared to either leave or take the blows.""That approach is essential in Test cricket to survive challenging spells, but unfortunately, it was lacking in India’s approach today.""South Africa, who lead the two-Test series 1-0, reached 26 for no loss in their second innings and stretched the overall lead to 314 going into day four.Meanwhile, former South African pace spearhead Dale Steyn said it was unusual to see an overseas side dominate for this long in India. ""It’s rare to witness a visiting side dominate three days of cricket in India like this,"" Steyn said.""In my view, their strategy and execution in these Guwahati conditions have outshone India’s efforts.""Steyn said South Africa’s choices through the Test had been effective, starting with the decision to bat first.He also supported captain Temba Bavuma’s call to bat again rather than enforce the follow-on. ""When Temba Bavuma ran off the field, it was evident that the last hour of play would be challenging for the batsmen,"" Steyn said.""The decision to continue batting was the right one — aiming to stay positive, take calculated risks, and if a wicket falls, so be it.""Tomorrow provides a full day of batting in more favourable conditions, offering an opportunity to build on this position,"" he added.South Africa last won a Test series in India in 2000.",Former India spinner Anil Kumble criticises batting performance.

Poll Do you believe Mohammed Enaan is a future star in Indian cricket? Absolutely No

When Mohammed Enaan stepped out to bat on Sunday, India A were languishing at 100/6. No one could have predicted the spectacle that was about to unfold. It was a moment dripping with tension, the kind that defines a player.The pitch at Bengaluru's COE ground was spitting venom and testing every batter’s resolve. And yet, as the ball hissed, Enaan, the 19-year-old from Mundur in Thrissur district, stood unmoved, as if the chaos around him had no claim over his destiny.What followed was a batting masterclass. With each ball, Enaan carved his own legend. His 105 not out off 74 deliveries was not just a century, but a declaration of his unbridled talent. For a majority of that knock, he curbed his natural instincts.When the final over arrived, Enaan unleashed a flurry of 28 runs, a savage surge that catapulted him past the three-figure mark, and India A to a match-winning score of 269 against India B. It would help his team seal a spot in the tri series final.""Whenever you get an opportunity to bat, make it count,"" was Enaan’s coach, Dinesh Gopalakrishnan's advice. Enaan made it count.""My aim was to bat till the end...because I knew that if I stayed till the end, runs would come,"" Enaan tellsIt was during the lockdown that his batting took flight. ""I always knew I could do more with the bat,"" Enaan says.""During lockdown, we worked specifically on his power hitting. That is now a crucial part of his game,"" Gopalakrishnan notes.Enaan’s brilliance extends beyond his willow. ""He is a competent leg-spinner, gets a beautiful drift, has a deceptive googly with a quick arm action,"" his coach explains.""He is neither in the classical mould, nor a mystery spinner,"" he offers. Little wonder then that Afghanistan's talisman spinner Rashid Khan is his idol.It’s not hard to see why Enaan’s name is already on the lips of IPL scouts and experts alike.Raised in Dubai, where his father Shahnavas Moidutty worked, he spent his early years playing cricket with cousins and friends.But cricket was never just a game for him: it was his calling.At 11, his family returned to Kerala, and it was here, under the watchful eye of Gopalakrishnan at the Athreya Cricket Academy that his potential began to bear fruit.From the moment he was selected for Kerala's U14 trials, Enan knew he was destined for more. “That was my first big break,” he recalls. Last year, he was the highest wicket-taker for India’s U19 team against Australia.""I finished with 22 wickets in 2 ODIs and 2 Tests against the Australia U19 team in October last year. That series gave me confidence,"" the teen asserts.Now, as IPL scouts and coaches track his every move, it’s clear that Enan’s future is written in bold letters.Rajasthan Royals, under Sanju Samson, invited him as a net bowler last season, and this year, the Punjab Kings picked him for trials. Even former India batting coach Sanjay Bangar was captivated by his all-round brilliance.""He has the X-factor,"" Gopalakrishnan beams.Now, with the U19 World Cup in Zimbabwe and Namibia scheduled next year, and the IPL dream just a heartbeat away, Enaan’s ambitions are as grand as his talent. ""I want to represent India at the U19 World Cup next year,"" Enaan says. ""And if I get the chance, I’d love to play in the IPL. For now, I’m focused on the tri series final,"" he adds.",Mohammed Enaan is a 19-year-old leg-spinner and batsman. He scored 105 not out in India A's tri-series win against India B. He was picked for trials by Rajasthan Royals and Punjab Kings this season.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125545749,imgsize-27100,width-400,resizemode-4/1280720-photos-2025-11-24t222325247.jpg"

'I'm the happiest that way': Washington Sundar reacts to his Team India role after Day 3 in Guwahati

Poll What do you believe is the biggest factor in India's struggle during this Test? Lack of batting resilience Bowling inefficiencies Pressure and nerves

Mohammed Siraj’s frustration boiled over during a tense third day in Guwahati, and KL Rahul’s lighthearted reaction to it became one of the most replayed moments of the Test.The moment came early in South Africa’s second innings when Siraj, fielding in the deep, hurled a wild return past Rishabh Pant. Pant failed to collect it, forcing Rahul at slip to react instantly and prevent leaking runs. Rahul turned towards Siraj with a pointed gesture, urging him to settle down. The pacer acknowledged it, but the exchange captured India’s mounting pressure as they struggled to find a breakthrough.Rahul repeatedly gestured with his hands to keep things calm and that there was no need to 'rush'. Siraj was seen reacting with a wide smile on his face.India had already endured a punishing day dominated by Marco Jansen, whose 6/48 bundled out the hosts for 201. Washington Sundar and Kuldeep Yadav’s 72-run stand for the eighth wicket delayed the inevitable but couldn’t undo the damage. South Africa, holding a 288-run lead, declined the follow-on and finished at 26/0, stretching their advantage to 314 with two days left.For Indian fans, the only breather came from Siraj himself - and this time for a harmless 'prank' on the spidercam. Between overs, the pacer placed his cap on the hovering Spidercam, drawing laughter as the cap covered the lens and the operator nudged the camera down in a silent plea to remove it.Siraj obliged one ball later, giving the crowd a brief reason to smile on an otherwise sobering day.","Mohammed Siraj and KL Rahul shared a light-hearted moment on Day 3.

Everton secured a 1-0 victory against Manchester United at Old Trafford on Monday in a Premier League match marked by Everton's Idrissa Gueye receiving a red card for striking his teammate Michael Keane. Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall's 29th-minute goal proved decisive, as the 10-man Everton team successfully defended their lead despite United's dominant second-half performance.The match took an unexpected turn in the 13th minute when Gueye, frustrated with Keane's apparent failure to receive his pass inside the Everton penalty box, confronted his teammate. After Bruno Fernandes missed a shot, Keane shoved Gueye, who responded by slapping Keane's face, resulting in referee Tony Harrington showing a red card for violent conduct.""The referee's call of red card to Gueye for violent conduct was checked and confirmed by VAR — with the action deemed to be a clear strike to the face of Keane,"" the league announced on social media.Gueye became the first Premier League player to be sent off for fighting with a teammate since Stoke City's Ricardo Fuller clashed with Andy Griffin in 2008.""I think it was just a moment of madness,"" Dewsbury-Hall said. ""It was avoidable but Idrissa has apologized to us all at full-time and said his piece. We move on from it. The reaction from the lads after that is unbelievable. We could easily have crumbled and lost the game comfortably and if anything it made us grow as a team.""Gueye later apologized on Instagram: ""What happened does not reflect who I am or the values I stand for. Emotions can run high, but nothing justifies such behavior. I'll make sure it never happens again.""""They were the better team, with 11 players or 10,"" United coach Ruben Amorim admitted. ""I felt from the first minute that we were not there with the same intensity so they deserve the win. If they have 10, let's push the opponent to the final third. We need to be near on the transition. We needed to be focused. We need to do more.""Despite being down to 10 men, Everton took the lead through Dewsbury-Hall's impressive 18-meter strike. Manchester United dominated the remainder of the match with 25 shots on goal compared to Everton's three.""I will sleep well tonight,"" Dewsbury-Hall said. ""I am so thankful we got the three points.""The victory marked David Moyes' first win as a visiting coach at Old Trafford in the Premier League after 18 unsuccessful attempts.""I'm incredibly proud of the players and the fans,"" Moyes said. ""We got over the line with 10 men. We started the ball brilliantly well, got the sending off, the game changed. But we showed resilience.

Delays and deadlines

Villarreal keep pace

A stunner from midfield

Barcelona marked its long-awaited return to Camp Nou with a commanding 4-0 win over a 10-man Athletic Bilbao, turning the night into a double celebration.Around 45,000 supporters filled the partially reopened stadium, which is operating at roughly half capacity after more than two years of renovation work. The club, burdened by heavy debt, is banking on the revamped venue to generate much-needed revenue.The evening began perfectly for the hosts as Robert Lewandowski struck just four minutes in. Ferran Torres then netted twice, both goals created by excellent service from young star Lamine Yamal, before Fermín López added another on his Camp Nou debut. Athletic’s hopes faded completely when Oihan Sancet was sent off in the 53rd minute for a reckless challenge on López, with Barcelona already three goals clear.Lewandowski said the night meant more than the scoreline. “We played well from the start and added another three points, but the real joy today is being back at Camp Nou. Playing here is different. We feel stronger.”Fans embraced that feeling too. Despite the cold, there was a festive energy as thousands sang the club anthem before kick-off. Their last visit to Camp Nou had been in May 2023, and for over 900 days they had to travel to the less accessible Olympic Stadium on the city’s hillside for home matches.“It’s like returning home,” said 36-year-old supporter Carlos Narváez. “The atmosphere at the Olympic Stadium wasn’t the same. You can see how excited everyone is.”To mark the occasion, Barcelona released clouds of blue and maroon smoke before the game and staged a fireworks show afterward. Some supporters even chanted Lionel Messi ’s name, remembering the golden era he owned on this very pitch.But the new Camp Nou is still far from its final form. Large cranes tower above the incomplete upper tier, which remains an exposed frame of concrete and steel. Many parts of the ground still resemble an active construction zone. Once finished, the stadium is projected to hold 105,000 spectators.There were also positive notes on the injury front. Joan García returned in goal, while Raphinha made a late appearance, both stepping back onto the pitch after nearly two months out with leg injuries.The victory lifted Barcelona level on points with leaders Real Madrid, who travel to Elche on Sunday. Up next for Xavi’s side is a Champions League visit to Chelsea on Tuesday.Renovation work began in June 2023 with the aim of modernising and expanding the famed arena, previously seating 99,000. The club raised 1.45 billion euros (about $1.6 billion at the time) through several investors to fund the ambitious overhaul.Barcelona had hoped to return by November 2024 to coincide with its 125th anniversary, but the target was pushed back multiple times. The club has yet to announce a new completion date and plans to request permission to open additional sections as progress continues.More than 20,000 fans recently attended Barcelona’s first open training session back at the stadium, and this week UEFA cleared the club to host Eintracht Frankfurt at Camp Nou on 9 December.Villarreal remained just two points behind the leaders after Tani Oluwaseyi struck an 83rd-minute winner in a 2-1 victory against Mallorca. The Canadian forward, formerly of Major League Soccer, secured all three points late on.Real Sociedad produced a dramatic second-half turnaround in their 3-1 win over Osasuna, capped by a spectacular goal from Ander Barrenetxea. Spotting goalkeeper Sergio Herrera off his line, the forward launched a lob from inside the centre circle. Herrera managed to get a hand to it, but not enough to prevent the ball from dropping into the net. It was Sociedad’s first away victory of the campaign.Elsewhere, Iago Aspas converted a second-half penalty to give Celta Vigo a narrow 1-0 win away to Alaves.","Barcelona beat Athletic Bilbao 4-0 at Camp Nou.

Jonty Rhodes on India's challenge vs spin, domestic cricket and fixed Test centres

“It’s about time. It’s been so long!”That was manager Mikel Arteta’s response when quizzed about Arsenal’s long-wait for a fourth Premier League title. And this was three years ago! The wait has only grown longer for a club who were last crowned English champions in 2004.With the Spaniard now into his sixth full season since taking charge of the Gunners, the “it’s about time” sentiment has only increased among, not just critics, but club icons too. Back in May, Thierry Henry, the club’s record goalscorer conceded that Arsenal should have had some silverware to show for their efforts, considering how close they have come on a couple of occasions within the last three years.Also Watch:Three months into the new season, they have got off to a start which once again has their long suffering fans brimming with hope. Ahead of Sunday’s eagerly-anticipated North London derby against Tottenham Hotspur, Arsenal sit four points clear at the top of the table with 11 games played. It’s the sort of situation that’s bound to generate ‘a lot of noise’, as the club’s star midfielder Declan Rice pointed out.“I think it's just one of those things that there's always going to be talk around us because we have such a good manager, we have such good players, and obviously with the start we've had this season,” Rice told The Times of India in an interview facilitated by JioHotstar this week.“We've been top of the table going into the last two international breaks, so that creates a lot of noise. But it's important for us that we block that out, which we have been doing.“We take no notice of it and we just keep doing what we've been doing, because in the Premier League, anything can happen at any time, and we just need to stay focused and take one game at a time. We're doing well at just focusing on ourselves at the minute, which is good.”A big reason behind Arsenal’s march is Rice. In the build-up to Sunday’s big clash at the Emirates, the league shared a one-minute clip on one of its official social media accounts, highlighting the England international’s all-round impact. From scoring goals to creating chances, Rice “can do it all”, the caption stated.The 26-year-old believes he can do even more, as he spoke of how his mental approach to the game has transformed since becoming a club-record signing for Arsenal two seasons ago. “In my earlier days, I wasn't really bothered about scoring or assisting. I just wanted to just play well for the team and get three points. But on top of that, now I've got that hunger and obsession with helping the team out, knowing that my goal and my assist has helped us to win. So if I can score or assist, that makes me really happy.“But I've still got so much room for improvement in that area as well. I think I can score way more and can assist more as well. So we're going to keep pushing for that.”Rice, of course, is not just integral to Arsenal’s objectives but to the national team’s as well, in a season leading into the Fifa World Cup . And the Three Lions shirt carries its own weight of expectations from a football-mad nation desperate to end a major trophy drought that makes Arsenal’s wait seem much lighter in comparison. Rice spoke of the challenge of juggling responsibilities with club and country.“Obviously, when we have our club games, we're fully 100% committed and focused on that. But then when we go away with England, you need to put 100% energy into that as well. Because if you turn up to England and don't have 100% energy or you don't apply yourself in the right way, then you're not going to have the results that we've just had,” he said, referring to England’s historic World Cup qualifying campaign which saw Thomas Tuchel’s side finish with a perfect record of eight wins from as many matches and no goals conceded.“So when you go away, you have to park the club part to the side for a week or 10 days, for however long you’re away. And as soon as you're back with Arsenal, then you get back into the swing of things.“Even Tuchel, the manager, speaks about it in terms of us just being together and everyone pulling in the right direction. It’s like, ‘don’t bring your club stuff into England’ and it just keeps it really fresh.”In last season’s Champions League quarterfinal first leg against record 15-time winners Real Madrid, Rice served notice of his ability in dead-ball situations, scoring two magical free kicks in a 3-0 win for Arsenal. The second of those two stunners has earned him a nomination for the FIFA Puskas Award (best goal of the year), the mention of which brings a wide smile to his face. Asked if there was a dead-ball specialist who helped shape his own style and Rice would name a famous compatriot.“Free kicks, I think the most iconic ones, obviously (David) Beckham, just because of how many he scored, the way he took them. We obviously have a completely different run up, but it's just iconic the way he took free kicks and how many he scored. I've only scored two. They've been two good ones, but I need to score some more now.”Beware Tottenham!(Watch Arsenal vs Tottenham Hotspur in the Premier League on Nov 23, Live & exclusive on Star Sports Network and JioHotstar)",Arsenal sit four points clear at the top of the Premier League with 11 games played.

Liverpool’s Premier League campaign continued its downward spiral on Saturday as the defending champions suffered a 3-0 home defeat to Nottingham Forest. Meanwhile, Manchester City’s pursuit of Arsenal was stalled by a 2-1 loss at Newcastle.Liverpool’s sixth defeat of the season leaves them 11th in the table, eight points behind leaders Arsenal, with a game in hand. Coach Arne Slot described the result as “very, very, very bad” and admitted he could offer no excuses for the team’s worrying form.“That is far from good enough, and I’m responsible for that,” Slot said after Murillo, Nicolo Savona, and Morgan Gibbs-White’s goals at Anfield handed Liverpool six losses in their last seven league games. To put it in perspective, last season’s title-winning team lost only four matches all campaign.Arsenal benefited from the slip-ups of its main rivals without taking the field. City suffered their fourth defeat as Harvey Barnes scored twice for Newcastle at St James’ Park. Chelsea moved up to second, closing to within three points of Arsenal with a 2-0 win over Burnley. Arsenal faces Tottenham on Sunday.Elsewhere, Crystal Palace beat Wolves 2-0, Fulham edged Sunderland 1-0, Brighton recovered from a goal down to beat Brentford 2-1, and Bournemouth came back from 2-0 down to draw 2-2 with West Ham.Forest’s victory marked the second consecutive season they’ve beaten Liverpool at Anfield and lifted Sean Dyche’s side out of the relegation zone. It was also Forest’s first back-to-back wins this season under their third coach, following the dismissals of Nuno Espirito Santo and Ange Postecoglou.Liverpool has managed just one league win since September 20. The latest defeat could have been heavier, as Igor Jesus saw a first-half goal disallowed for handball. Murillo opened the scoring in the 33rd minute, with Savona doubling Forest’s advantage immediately after the break. Gibbs-White wrapped up the 3-0 win in the 78th minute.Even the return of Alisson and Alexander Isak, who started his first league match in a month, failed to lift Liverpool’s fortunes. Isak was substituted after 68 minutes, extending his goalless streak to six games this season. Captain Virgil van Dijk said: “Everyone is disappointed, like they should be, because losing at home against Nottingham Forest is very bad.”Manchester City had the chance to draw level with Arsenal but were undone by Newcastle. Harvey Barnes scored in the 63rd minute, Ruben Dias equalised for City shortly after, only for Barnes to flick in the winner seven minutes later. City now sit third, four points behind Arsenal. Pep Guardiola insisted, “There is a long, long, long way to go.”Chelsea moved up to second thanks to goals from Pedro Neto and Enzo Fernandez at Burnley. Neto opened the scoring in the 37th minute, with Fernandez sealing the 2-0 win in the 88th. Burnley slipped into the relegation zone, while West Ham squandered a 2-0 lead at Bournemouth, letting Marcus Tavernier and Enes Unal secure a 2-2 draw.Crystal Palace defeated Wolves 2-0, with goals from Daniel Munoz and Yeremy Pino in quick succession, leaving Wolves still without a win in 12 matches. Brighton maintained their momentum with Danny Welbeck scoring his seventh goal in eight games to help the Seagulls overturn Brentford 2-1. Fulham picked up a rare win, Raul Jimenez scoring the decisive goal in the 84th minute against Sunderland.","Nottingham Forest beat Liverpool 3-0 at Anfield.

Gorr claims Offset pressured her for Diggs' location, which Offset's source denies, stating Gorr has a personal feud with the rapper. The situation intensifies with Cardi B's recent comments about Offset's private harassment.

A messy triangle of accusations, jealousy, denial, and public fallout

Offset just found himself in the crosshairs of a messy and very public drama and this time, it’s not just Cardi B calling him out. The rap star is being accused of trying to “set up” NFL receiver Stefon Diggs in a secretive behind-the-scenes conflict allegedly fueled by jealousy, unresolved heartbreak, and a desire for payback.The accusations come from Miami-based IG model Jordyn Gorr, who claims Offset privately pressured her for Diggs’ location and demanded cooperation in what she says was a potential off-field confrontation. While Offset categorically denies it through a source, the situation has ignited a wildfire of speculation, fandom chaos, and social-media theory-crafting about whether this is a scorned-ex meltdown, a personal vendetta, or just a clout-built accusation.According to Jordyn Gorr, Offset was allegedly determined to put Diggs “in a blender” after the Bills star became the new father of Cardi B’s latest baby. She claims Offset aggressively messaged her, calling her an “Opp ass n***a” and writing, “Give drop or don’t come back around.” Gorr says she initially played along before becoming uncomfortable and ultimately exposing the exchange.Her claim isn’t just that Offset wanted information, she alleges he wanted Diggs cornered.Offset, however, is firing back through a source who insists, “this girl has an ongoing beef with Set and is now looking to blow this up into something it's not. Their feud has no connection to Diggs.”Offset’s digital silence is notable, he wiped his Instagram last week and hasn’t addressed the allegations publicly. But Cardi B’s recent comments to her fanbase, saying Offset has been harassing her privately, intersect uncomfortably with Gorr’s claims, forming a narrative of escalating tension rather than random drama.At the heart of this saga lies a collision of ego, heartbreak, fatherhood claims, and reputation, a collision playing out not in courtrooms or boardrooms, but in comment sections, rumor channels, and social-media screenshots. Whether Gorr’s revelations are genuine proof or opportunistic exposure remains to be seen, but one thing is certain: the Cardi-Offset-Diggs triangle just became the biggest collision of hip-hop and NFL celebrity turmoil in months.Also Read: Cardi B sparks buzz after Stefon Diggs’ viral sideline moment with Patriots cheerleader takes over the internet","Jordyn Gorr claims Offset pressured her for Diggs' location, which Offset's source denies, stating Gorr has a personal feud with the rapper.

Taylor Swift’s Disney+ docuseries faces unexpected legal threat from Florida courtroom as Travis Kelce remains silent,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/taylor-swifts-disney-docuseries-faces-unexpected-legal-threat-from-florida-courtroom-as-travis-kelce-remains-silent/articleshow/125552797.cms,"Taylor Swift's Disney+ docuseries faces a legal challenge from Florida artist Kimberly Marasco, who alleges copyright infringement. Marasco seeks to halt the release, claiming Swift used her poetry for lyrics and visual themes. Swift's team dismisses the claims as baseless, and legal experts deem an injunction unlikely, though the case sparks debate on creative overlap.

Why the legal showdown over “End of an Era” could reshape the conversation around creative overlap

The countdown to Taylor Swift’s December 12 Disney+ docuseries premiere has suddenly collided with a legal hurdle, as Florida artist Kimberly Marasco pushes for a court-ordered pause on the release. The dispute has gained national attention not only because it targets one of the world’s most influential pop figures, but because the case sits before Judge Aileen Cannon, a judicial name already familiar to the political and legal spotlight.Swift’s camp strongly rejects the allegations, calling the claims “absurd and legally baseless,” and legal experts say the odds of blocking a global streaming launch are extremely slim. Still, the injunction request has ignited a serious conversation about copyright boundaries, artistic ownership, and creative influence in modern entertainment.Marasco claims Swift pulled from her poetry for lyrics and visual themes spanning Lover, Folklore, Midnights, and The Tortured Poets Department, arguing that releasing The End of an Era would compound the alleged infringement.Her motion warns of “irreparable harm,” stating that once streamed, her creative expression could become “irreversibly embedded in cultural products beyond Plaintiff's reach.”That assertion highlights a larger phenomenon, how quickly creative concepts spread and become impossible to retract once embedded in global media consumption.Swift’s legal team counters with the fundamental principle of copyrighted material: ideas and broad concepts cannot be owned. As they put it, “the concepts of fire or love cannot be owned by one person.” That argument aligns with entertainment law norms: copyright protects specific expression—not vibes, motifs, or emotional themes.Former federal prosecutor Neama Rahmani supports that legal reality, noting it must be “substantially similar or really identical” to constitute infringement, and he says he simply doesn’t see that. His blunt assessment: “I would be ‘shocked’ if the motion is granted.”Still, this case serves as a cultural flashpoint. It raises questions about the fuzzy edge between inspiration and imitation, between shared artistic language and proprietary authorship. Even if the injunction fails, as many expect, this dispute may influence how artists, studios, and streaming platforms document and archive creative processes going forward.All eyes now turn to Judge Cannon’s ruling, with Swift’s project in limbo, but the cultural debate already fully underway.Also Read: Taylor Swift’s latest decision with Travis Kelce leaves Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds stunned","Taylor Swift's Disney+ docuseries faces a legal challenge from Florida artist Kimberly Marasco, who alleges copyright infringement.

Kylie Kelce reaches breaking point as leaked-number chaos explodes into mass DMs and sparks fan chaos,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/kylie-kelce-reaches-breaking-point-as-leaked-number-chaos-explodes-into-mass-dms-and-sparks-fan-chaos/articleshow/125552572.cms,"Kylie Kelce firmly addressed a viral phone number mix-up, clarifying it wasn't hers. She then shared her parenting philosophy, advocating for delayed smartphone access for her daughters, preferring a shared family device. This stance, rooted in her own childhood experiences, emphasizes digital responsibility and resonates with parents concerned about excessive screen time.

Kylie Kelce sets firm boundaries on digital contact and parenting in the public eye

""It's SCARY"" - Kylie reveals the horror of introducing screens to her daughters | More Sh*t Monday

For the Kelce family, public attention is nothing new, but this latest wave hit an unexpectedly personal nerve. During what was meant to be a casual, private watch party for the Chiefs–Colts game, a screenshot began circulating online showing Kylie Kelce’s name attached to a phone number. Fans assumed it belonged to her and immediately began messaging and DM’ing her.Kylie quickly took to Instagram to clarify that the leaked number wasn’t hers, writing, “Please stop DM-ing me about those screen shots including my phone number… IT’S NOT MY NUMBER. Good looking out though!” The incident highlighted a growing tension between celebrity access and personal privacy in the age of livestreams, group chats, and hyper-engaged fandom.After laughing off the phone-number mix-up, Kylie shifted conversation toward something much more intentional: her stance on raising digitally responsible kids. On her “Not Gonna Lie” podcast, she explained that her daughters won’t be getting their own phones until they’re old enough to handle them responsibly.Instead, she’s advocating for a “kitchen phone”,a shared family device that stays on the first floor and is only used when necessary.She emphasized that today’s childhood shouldn’t be replaced by constant scrolling, saying it feels “frightening” to watch kids become dependent on screens and endless online access.Her perspective isn’t coming from a place of judgment but from personal experience. Kylie described how, when she was young, being at a sibling’s practice meant entertaining yourself, not burying your face in a digital feed.That philosophy has resonated with many parents who see a troubling cultural shift toward constant connectivity. Her reminder, “I know that I didn't need full access to everything and everyone at any given time of the day, so my kids don't either,” went viral not because it was dramatic, but because it was relatable.Beyond being Jason Kelce’s wife and the sister-in-law of Travis Kelce, Kylie has increasingly become her own steady voice in the NFL ecosystem; calm, grounded, and candid. While online followers continue to increase, so do the misconceptions and intrusions.But if this episode proved anything, it’s that Kylie Kelce knows how to handle the spotlight, on her terms, behind healthy boundaries, and with unwavering clarity about where her private life begins and public access ends.Also Read: Taylor Swift’s disappearing act at Chiefs games and why it’s completely intentional","Kylie Kelce addressed a viral phone number mix-up, clarifying it wasn't hers.

Saints consider bold Justin Tucker comeback move as kicking struggles threaten to derail season,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/saints-consider-bold-justin-tucker-comeback-move-as-kicking-struggles-threaten-to-derail-season/articleshow/125552559.cms,"New Orleans Saints, struggling with a 2-9 record and last-place kicking, are considering a bold move: a tryout for Justin Tucker. Tucker, a historically accurate kicker, faced a 10-game suspension following allegations. This potential signing offers a chance for redemption and a significant upgrade, but the Saints must weigh the controversy against their dire need for reliable field goals.

Saints weigh the risk-reward of Justin Tucker’s comeback against current roster failures

The New Orleans Saints have reached a point where patience has run out and performance is demanding change. Their season has slowly unraveled due to missed field goals and lost momentum, with a 2-9 record reflecting more than just offensive struggles, it reflects a confidence crisis on special teams.Now, the team is turning to one of the most accurate kickers in NFL history, Justin Tucker, whose career stalled following a 10-game suspension. This tryout isn’t just a testing session; it marks the potential resurrection of a legacy that once seemed untouchable. For Tucker, this is more than a job interview, this is the first real opportunity to reclaim normalcy, reputation, and possibly redemption.The Saints’ kicking dilemma isn’t speculative, it’s glaring. Blake Grupe’s 69.2% field-goal success rate ranks dead last among kickers with at least 20 attempts this year, and those misses have directly cost the Saints close games and offensive rhythm. In Sunday’s loss to Atlanta, his failures from 38 and 47 yards didn’t just echo frustration, they symbolized a shift. The front office can no longer treat kicking woes as temporary.Enter Justin Tucker. Despite denying all allegations made against him and calling them “unequivocally false,” the accusations from 16 massage therapists and subsequent NFL suspension left a cloud over his departure from Baltimore and stalled what had been a historic career trajectory.His agent Rob Roche clarified Tucker’s stance during the resolution process, saying, “Justin has always strived to carry himself in a way that would make his family and community proud… we have advised Justin to accept this resolution and close this matter.”Now 36, Tucker isn’t just another veteran free agent, he’s a high-reward gamble with Hall-of-Fame-level credentials. The Saints must assess whether their kicking struggles justify stepping into controversy, and early signs suggest desperation may outweigh hesitation.If Tucker shows even a fraction of his former precision in workouts, New Orleans could make one of the most talked-about mid-season moves of 2025: turning one of football’s most polarizing figures into its most unlikely comeback story.Also Read: What record did Dak Prescott break?

Ciara opens up about her ‘greatest fear’ while parenting alongside Russell Wilson in a hyper-connected world,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/ciara-opens-up-about-her-greatest-fear-while-parenting-alongside-russell-wilson-in-a-hyper-connected-world/articleshow/125539680.cms,"Motherhood has profoundly reshaped Ciara's perspective, leading her to actively engage with her children's modern, hyper-connected world. She embraces a ""partial helicopter mom"" approach, prioritizing proactive conversations to equip her kids with essential knowledge before external influences do. Ciara aims to empower her children, ensuring they understand their inherent worth and are prepared to navigate life's challenges with confidence.

Ciara’s “partial helicopter mom” approach and why she wants to beat the world to the conversation

Ciara’s Guide To Manifesting Convictions Into Reality | Angie Martinez IRL

Motherhood may have reshaped Ciara’s career, but it has also fundamentally redefined her worldview. As a mother of four, one child with her ex Future and three with her husband, NFL quarterback Russell Wilson, Ciara says her daily life revolves around staying connected to the evolving realities that her children navigate.More than just being present, she believes in understanding their world as it exists today, not as it existed decades ago. She acknowledges that children now live in a hyper-connected culture where outside voices, online content, and peer influence arrive faster than any parent can track. That urgency fuels her commitment to staying “tapped in,” as she puts it, and remaining a trusted voice rather than a background presence in their development.Ciara describes herself as a “partial” helicopter mom, not controlling, but definitely attentive. She openly admits she likes to “be up in the mix,” because in today’s world, silence and disengagement can leave important conversations unanswered.“This world is like bananas, and so I think you've got to be locked in even more now because the access is so high,” she explained. Her biggest fear, she said, is “that the world tells my kid information that shapes them when I could be the one telling them.”To Ciara, parenting isn’t just emotional support, it’s proactive education. She proudly notes the moments when she gets to those big life topics before social media or classmates do: “I feel really proud sometimes when you beat the world to telling your kids something… So you're just only empowering them, you're only armoring them for the world.”She has previously emphasized to Parents magazine that she wants her daughters to understand their worth and potential: “I want my girls to know that they're not limited by their gender or the color of their skin.”And as she told Vogue, motherhood changed how she sees her career as well: “When I first began, I'm in an industry where it was taboo to have a child… So having my babies and being on this journey… has just been one of the coolest things.”For Ciara, parenting isn’t about protecting her kids from the world, it’s about preparing them to walk confidently through it.Also Read: Ciara is in awe of Russell Wilson’s “fullness as a man” as she opens up about their age-gap marriage and his old-soul maturity","Ciara describes herself as a “partial” helicopter mom, not controlling, but definitely attentive.

Tom Brady’s new photos spark buzz as Vivian shows uncanny supermodel-style resemblance to Gisele Bündchen,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/tom-bradys-new-photos-spark-buzz-as-vivian-shows-uncanny-supermodel-style-resemblance-to-her-gisele-bndchen/articleshow/125539138.cms,"Tom Brady's recent Instagram posts featuring his children have ignited online discussion, with many noting his daughter Vivian's striking resemblance to her mother, Gisele Bündchen. The 12-year-old's features and youthful confidence echo Bündchen's early modeling days. This observation highlights the family's journey through fame and co-parenting, with Vivian now emerging as her own individual.

A family navigating fame, change, and co-parenting while Vivian grows into her own identity

Tom Brady’s weekend Instagram update, seemingly simple family snapshots, ended up sparking a wave of online chatter for reasons that had little to do with football. In two casual photos, Brady was seen enjoying quality time with his youngest children, Benjamin and Vivian, first during a backyard-style catch session and later at what looked like an outdoor art setup. But it was Vivian who quietly captured public attention.Viewers immediately noticed just how much the 12-year-old is beginning to resemble her mother, Gisele Bündchen, especially from the supermodel’s iconic early-2000s Victoria’s Secret runway era. It wasn’t just facial similarity; fans pointed to the posture, the eyes, and even the youthful confidence that mirrors Bündchen’s own childhood photos.Much of the fascination surrounding Vivian stems from watching her grow up in a family that has always lived in the global spotlight. With a legendary quarterback father and a supermodel mother, she has become a visual blend of both worlds, sporty ease and editorial poise.The resemblance is drawing attention, but what’s more compelling is how Brady and Bündchen have handled co-parenting since their 2022 divorce. Both have openly acknowledged the challenges of marriage amid intense careers, with Brady previously admitting, “She didn’t feel I was doing my part for the family, you know,” while referencing how Bündchen often managed the home responsibilities.Despite personal changes, the family dynamic today feels strikingly united. Brady regularly shares glimpses of father-child bonding; affectionate, playful, rooted in normalcy rather than celebrity, while Bündchen continues to publicly cherish her children and their milestones. Observers are now watching Vivian not as a “mini-Gisele” or “Brady’s daughter,” but as someone forming her own identity while carrying echoes of both parents’ legacy.At the end of the day, the buzz around her resemblance is less about genetics and more about the quiet realization that this once-little child is stepping confidently toward her teenage years, with the world watching, gently speculating, and rooting for her to become entirely, uniquely herself.Also Read: Tom Brady's ex-wife Gisele Bündchen’s changing style reflects her path to self-confidence and independence","Vivian Brady, 12, is beginning to resemble her mother, Gisele Bündchen.

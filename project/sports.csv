NEW DELHI: Oman opener Aamir Kaleem made history on Friday in Abu Dhabi, becoming the oldest batter to score a half-century against India in any format of the game. At 43 years and 303 days, Kaleem broke a record that had stood for over 79 years, previously held by England legend Wally Hammond , who scored 69 against India in a 1946 Test at Old Trafford.Kaleem’s 64-run innings also made him the oldest to hit a T20I fifty against a full member nation, surpassing Chris Gayle’s long-standing record. The knock followed Mohammad Nabi ’s record just a day earlier for the oldest half-century in Asia Cup history.Kaleem battled heat, humidity, and cramps to produce a gritty 64 off 46 balls against the world champions. Partnering with Hammad Mirza, who scored 51, Kaleem added 93 runs for the second wicket, marking Oman’s highest partnership against a full-member nation. The stand also represented the most runs India has conceded against an Associate team.For a while, India looked under pressure as Oman’s chase gained momentum. Kaleem also contributed with the ball, taking 2 for 31, showcasing his all-round credentials. The partnership ended when Hardik Pandya took a spectacular boundary catch to dismiss Kaleem off Harshit Rana, followed by Mirza falling in the next over.India eventually won by 21 runs, with Arshdeep Singh claiming his 100th T20I wicket.Earlier, Sanju Samson’s 56 and Abhishek Sharma’s 38 had set India’s total at 188/8, but Kaleem and Mirza ensured Oman remained competitive.Oman skipper Jatinder Singh praised the team’s effort: “I am extremely proud of the unit. The way they came up, they had their plans and executed them well… So proud of the way they have shown their character in the crunch situation.”For Oman, Kaleem’s innings was more than just runs — it was a historic performance and a reminder that age and experience can challenge even the giants of cricket. In the record books, Aamir Kaleem’s name will now sit alongside legends, inspiring Associate players around the world.","Aamir Kaleem becomes the oldest batter to score a half-century against India in any format of the game.

Poll How do you rate India's performance against Oman in the Asia Cup? Outstanding Good Average

NEW DELHI: India captain Suryakumar Yadav offered a candid reflection after his side’s 21-run win over a spirited Oman in their final Group A clash of the Asia Cup, admitting the conditions and circumstances were far from easy.“It’s a little difficult when you’re sitting and suddenly you come out and play. It’s so humid here,” Suryakumar said, after Harshit Rana (1/25 in 3 overs) and Arshdeep Singh (1/37 in 4 overs) went for runs on their return to the XI. Forced to rotate eight bowlers, the skipper was generous in his praise for the opposition. “Overall impressive. I feel Oman played (well). I knew with their coach, Sulu sir (Sulakshan Kulkarni), there will be khadoosness (stubbornness). It was amazing, really enjoyed watching them bat.”He described Hardik Pandya ’s run-out as “unfortunate” and revealed he had pushed himself down the order — even below Kuldeep Yadav, who batted at No.9 — just to give others time in the middle. With a smile, he added, “I will try to bat higher than No. 11 in the next game.” Sanju Samson , named Player of the Match for his 56 off 45 balls, relished his first substantial outing of the tournament. “It was humid and hot out there.Working on my fitness the last few weeks. We just got a new trainer and did the Bronco test. Good to see I got to spend some time in the middle. They (Oman) bowled really well. Have to give credit to Oman. Bowled well in the powerplay also, were swinging it upfront. I keep backing my strength to stay positive. Any contribution with the bat for your country, you have to take the positives.”Oman skipper Jatinder Singh was equally emotional, beaming with pride at his side’s fight. “I am extremely proud of the unit. The way they came up, they had their plans and executed them well. They were very much in the present. So proud of the way they have shown their character in the crunch situation. The hype of the tournament was there in the mind. We lack a little experience and exposure. This game was a blessing in disguise. We have a World Cup qualifier happening in Oman and the boys are ready. ”","India beat Oman by 21 runs in their final Group A clash of the Asia Cup.

Poll What do you think about Arshdeep Singh's achievement of 100 T20I wickets? Incredible milestone! Impressive, but not surprising. It's just the beginning for him.

Left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh entered the record books on Friday, becoming the first Indian bowler to reach 100 wickets in men’s T20 internationals. The 26-year-old achieved the milestone in India’s Asia Cup clash against Oman, that too, in his first outing of the tournament.Having sat out the opening two matches as India stuck with an unchanged XI, Arshdeep featured in the line-up in place of Jasprit Bumrah. His milestone wicket was that of Vinayak Shukla's in the last over of Oman’s 189-run chase, sealing his place in the history books.India had earlier posted 188/8 after opting to bat first. Sanju Samson steered the innings with a composed 56 off 45 balls, supported by the likes of Abhishek Sharma, Axar Patel and Tilak Varma to push the total to an uncomfortable target.Arshdeep’s 100th wicket added another chapter to his rise in international cricket. Since making his debut in 2022, he has built a reputation for consistency with the ball, troubling batters with swing at the top and accuracy at the death. His career figures now stand at 100 wickets in 64 matches, an achievement that also places him among only 25 players worldwide to have reached the mark.His best performance to date remains the 4 for 9 against the USA at the 2024 T20 World Cup, a spell that showcased his strength with the new ball.More recently, he has maintained form with 20 wickets in 11 matches since that tournament, cementing his role as a key figure in India’s T20 setup.India’s bowlers will now look to build on the momentum as they push towards the Super Four stage, with the Pakstan clash on September 21 looming as their biggest test so far. But for Arshdeep, the night belonged to a single delivery - the one that brought his 100th wicket and a place in India’s cricketing history.","Arshdeep Singh becomes the first Indian bowler to reach 100 T20I wickets.

Team India player Axar Patel endured a forgettable moment in the field during India’s Asia Cup 2025 clash against Oman at the Sheikh Zayed Stadium in Abu Dhabi on Friday.The all-rounder lost his balance while attempting a catch, dropped it, and hurt himself in the process, leaving the ground for treatment.The incident occurred in the 15th over of Oman’s chase. Shivam Dube bowled a back-of-length delivery to Hammad Mirza, who tried to cut but mistimed it off the splice.Axar sprinted from mid-off and managed to reach the ball.However, he fumbled not once but twice before the ball slipped out of his grasp.In the process, Axar’s head thudded against the ground, forcing him to walk off in visible discomfort.Axar had already contributed earlier with a 26-run cameo from 13 deliveries, keeping India’s innings on track after early setbacks.His dismissal, followed by a dropped catch in the field, turned his evening into a mixed one.India’s innings was built on Abhishek Sharma’s fiery 38 off just 15 balls, Sanju Samson’s composed 56, and Tilak Varma’s quick 29.The Men in Blue had raced to 60 in the powerplay, the highest score in Abu Dhabi so far this tournament, but Oman’s bowlers fought back impressively in the death overs.Shah Faisal stood out, finishing with 2/23 in four overs, while Jiten Ramanandi and Aamir Kaleem also picked up crucial wickets.For Oman, skipper Jatinder Singh’s 32 and Aamir Kaleem’s fighting knock kept them in the hunt, but chasing nearly 190 against a full-strength Indian attack was always going to be a steep ask.","Axar Patel lost his balance while attempting a catch, dropped it, and hurt himself in the process.

Poll Which player do you think had the most significant impact on India's innings against Oman? Sanju Samson Axar Patel Abhishek Sharma

India’s innings against Oman in the Asia Cup took an unusual turn on Friday as Suryakumar Yadav , who had batted at No. 3 in both of the team’s earlier matches in the tournament, did not come out to bat despite Team India utilising 10 batters on the night.The decision appeared to be a tactical move, with the Indian team seemingly opting to give their middle and lower order more time at the crease. Having chased the game in their opening two fixtures against the UAE and Pakistan, India had lost just one and three wickets respectively in the first two matches, leaving limited opportunities for the lower half of the batting line-up.On this occasion, with India batting first, the order was shuffled. Sanju Samson took charge of the innings with a measured 56 off 45 balls, while Abhishek Sharma provided his customary quick start at the top. Contributions from Axar Patel and Tilak Varma through the middle ensured the side posted 188 for 8.The changes in batting positions became more evident as Harshit Rana, followed by bowlers Arshdeep Singh and Kuldeep Yadav, were sent ahead of Suryakumar. The move meant the star batter never took guard, an outcome rarely seen in limited-overs cricket when a frontline batter remains padded up throughout an innings.For Oman, the effort with the ball was commendable. Faisal led the charge with early swing and tight lines at the death, while Ramanandi and Kaleem chipped in with crucial breakthroughs to restrict India under the 200-mark that many had expected.With the Super Four stage approaching, India’s tactical move gave their lower-order players valuable time at the crease, even if it came at the expense of the skipper's batting.","Suryakumar Yadav is the only Indian player in the XI that did not bat against Oman.

Sri Lanka all-rounder Dunith Wellalage will return to the national squad on Saturday after briefly leaving the Asia Cup side to be with his family following the death of his father, Suranga.The 22-year-old flew back to Colombo on Thursday night after learning of his father’s passing, which occurred due to a heart attack while Wellalage was playing a Group B match against Afghanistan. Suranga was 54.Wellalage will now travel back to the UAE on Friday night, accompanied by team manager Mahinda Halangode, and will be available for selection in Sri Lanka’s opening Super Four clash against Bangladesh.The young left-arm spinner bowled four overs in the Afghanistan match, claiming the wicket of Ibrahim Zadran in what was only his fifth T20I. Sri Lanka went on to secure a six-wicket win, driven by Kusal Mendis’ unbeaten 74.The news of Suranga Wellalage’s demise drew messages of support from across the cricket community. Former captain Lasith Malinga wrote on X, “Deeply saddened by the passing of Mr. Suranga Wellalage, father of Dunith Wellalage. My heartfelt condolences to the family.

Cricket can be cruel, and Hardik Pandya found that out the hard way in India’s clash against Oman at the Asia Cup 2025 in Abu Dhabi on Friday. The Indian all-rounder was dismissed in the most unfortunate fashion, a freak run-out that left fans and teammates stunned.The incident happened in the eighth over of India’s innings.Facing Jiten Ramanandi, Sanju Samson drove a full delivery back towards the bowler.The ball was struck firmly but slightly uppish. Ramanandi, diving to his left in an instinctive move, managed to get a fingertip on it. That tiny deflection turned into a disaster for India.The ball ricocheted off Ramanandi’s hand and crashed straight into the stumps at the non-striker’s end.Hardik, who had backed up just a few steps, was caught well short of his crease. He walked off immediately, acknowledging that the ball had made contact. His stay lasted just one delivery and one run, with the scorecard reading a cruel run out.The dismissal halted India’s momentum at a key stage.Having already lost Shubman Gill early and Abhishek Sharma after a breezy 38, India were looking to rebuild with Samson and Pandya at the crease.Instead, Oman found themselves right back in the contest with two wickets falling in quick succession.Oman’s bowlers, led by Ramanandi, who already had a hand in two dismissals, were visibly lifted by the moment.For Hardik, it was a nightmare outing, undone without making an error of his own.For Oman, it was a moment to savour, as the Associate nation continued to punch above their weight against the defending champions.",Hardik Pandya was caught well short of his crease by Jiten Ramanandi.

We have not batted first in this competition, and we want to know our depth. Having game time is important going into the Super 4s.

Poll What is your opinion on the handling of the situation by Liverpool FC? They are doing the right thing. They could have acted faster.

The Football Association has launched an investigation into alleged discriminatory language used by Liverpool Women’s goalkeeper Rafaela Borggrafe.According to reports from Britain’s PA news agency, the comments were overheard by teammates and staff during a recent squad photo-shoot. The matter was then raised internally before being referred to the FA.Liverpool confirmed the development in a statement on Friday. “The club has followed its protocols to the fullest extent and the alleged incident has been reported to the FA, which is conducting an investigation with our full support,” the statement read.“We condemn all forms of discrimination; it has no place in football or society. We are unable to comment further while the investigation is ongoing,” the club added.Borggrafe, 25, joined Liverpool in July from Freiburg on a free transfer but has yet to make her debut in the Women’s Super League.

Poll Should Diego Simeone have reacted to the insults from Liverpool supporters? Yes, he was provoked. No, he should have remained calm.

Atlético Madrid coach Diego Simeone admitted he regretted his confrontation with Liverpool supporters during Wednesday’s Champions League clash at Anfield, though he insisted that his reaction was provoked by repeated insults from the stands.The heated exchange came moments after Virgil van Dijk struck a late winner to seal Liverpool’s 3-2 victory, shortly after Atlético had fought back from two goals down thanks to a Marcos Llorente brace. As celebrations erupted, Simeone turned towards the crowd behind his bench and clashed with fans, prompting stewards to intervene. Referee Maurizio Mariani then sent him off.Explaining the incident afterwards, Simeone said, “When they scored the third goal he turned around and insulted me. I’m a person, I’m human.”“They were shouting insults through the whole game from behind the bench and I cannot say anything as I am a coach. Obviously my reaction is not justifiable, I insulted him. But it was 90 minutes of being insulted the whole time then you turn around, when your opponent has scored, and they are still insulting you. It is not that easy,” he said after the game.Simeone declined to elaborate on the nature of the abuse, saying, “I am not really going to get into the exact nature of the insults.I don’t want to get into that discussion. I know what went on behind the manager’s bench. I cannot solve society’s problems in one press conference. I have to live with it because it happens all the time.”UEFA is awaiting the referee’s report before considering disciplinary action, but Simeone suggested Liverpool should also address the matter. “I hope that a team like Liverpool can improve that part. When they identify the person who did this, it should have its consequences. But the person who needs to stay calm, and take the insults, is me. In my place you just have to take it,” he said.","Diego Simeone was sent off in Atletico Madrid's 3-2 win over Liverpool.

Matchday 5 of La Liga is shaping up to be a big one, with both Real Madrid and Barcelona hosting opponents who have made strong starts to the season.

Benfica appoint Jose Mourinho as manager on two-year deal; returns to Portugal after 21 years,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/benfica-appoint-jose-mourinho-as-manager-on-two-year-deal-returns-to-portugal-after-21-years/articleshow/123990779.cms,"Jose Mourinho attends a press conference in Lisbon, announcing his return to coaching in Portugal with Benfica on a two-year contract. (AP)

Jose Mourinho, the 62-year-old former Chelsea and Real Madrid manager, has been appointed as Benfica's new head coach until 2027, marking his return to Portuguese football after 21 years. The appointment comes after his dismissal from Turkish side Fenerbahce in August and follows Benfica's decision to sack Bruno Lage after their Champions League defeat to Qarabag.Benfica announced that Mourinho's contract will run until the end of the 2026/27 season, with both parties having the option to terminate the agreement at the conclusion of the current campaign.The Portuguese coach will face immediate challenges with upcoming matches against his former clubs Chelsea in the Champions League on September 30 and Porto in the Primeira Liga on October 5.""I come to Benfica at a different stage in my career, and as a person... we transform for the better,"" Mourinho said at his presentation alongside Benfica president Rui Costa. ""I'm more altruistic, less self-centred, I think less about myself and more about the good I can do for others, the joy I can bring to others. I'm not the important thing -- Benfica is important.""Mourinho's coaching journey began as an assistant to Bobby Robson and Louis van Gaal at Barcelona before taking his first head coaching role at Benfica in September 2000, which lasted only 11 matches.His career flourished after successful stints at Uniao de Leiria and Porto, where he won consecutive league titles and the 2004 Champions League.""In some people's minds, I have two resumes -- one that lasted a certain period and another that represents, let's say, a less happy phase of my career,"" Mourinho reflected. ""My misfortune is that in the last five years, I've played in two European finals. The negative part of my career... is two European finals in the last five years.""Mourinho's trophy cabinet includes three Premier League titles with Chelsea, a Champions League victory with Inter Milan in 2010, and a La Liga title with Real Madrid. His recent achievements include winning the Europa League with Manchester United in 2017 and the Conference League with Roma in 2022.""It's been 25 years in which I've had the opportunity to work for the biggest clubs in the world,"" Mourinho stated. ""I'd like to say that none of the other giant clubs I've had the opportunity to coach have made me feel more honoured, responsible, or motivated than being the coach of Benfica. The promise is very clear: I will live for Benfica, for my mission.""His first match as Benfica manager will be an away fixture against AVS in the Portuguese top flight.Mourinho expressed confidence in his new team's potential, stating: ""Benfica have enough potential within that dressing room to be champions.""",Jose Mourinho has been appointed as Benfica's new head coach until 2027.

Haaland’s half-century

Frankfurt hit five, Leverkusen denied

Brugge stun Monaco, Sporting cruise

Marcus Rashford scored his first goals for Barcelona as the Spanish champions launched their Champions League campaign with a hard-fought 2-1 win over Newcastle United at St James’ Park on Thursday.Rashford, on loan from Manchester United, broke the deadlock just before the hour mark by heading in Jules Kounde’s cross, before unleashing a thunderous strike from distance to double the lead midway through the second half. Anthony Gordon pulled one back for Newcastle, but Xavi’s men, semi-finalists last season, held firm.“It’s an amazing experience playing for Barcelona. I’ve always been a huge admirer of the club. We just want to win as much as possible,” said Rashford.At the Etihad, Erling Haaland continued his remarkable scoring record as Manchester City, the 2023 winners, overcame Napoli 2-0. The Serie A champions’ hopes were dented when skipper Giovanni Di Lorenzo was sent off in the first half for bringing down Haaland.Pep Guardiola’s side capitalised, with Haaland nodding in a Phil Foden assist early in the second half for his 50th Champions League goal in just 49 appearances.Jeremy Doku added a second as City extended Napoli’s winless run in England to 13 games.“The numbers speak for themselves,” Guardiola said. “Along with Ronaldo and Messi, Erling is there. In terms of goals, he is unbelievable.”Eintracht Frankfurt were the night’s biggest winners, thrashing Galatasaray 5-1. After Davinson Sanchez’s own goal levelled Yunus Akgun’s opener, Can Uzun and Jonathan Burkardt scored in first-half stoppage time. Burkardt struck again after the break before Ansgar Knauff sealed victory.Elsewhere, Bayer Leverkusen rescued a 2-2 draw at FC Copenhagen thanks to Pantelis Hatzidiakos’s stoppage-time own goal. Alejandro Grimaldo’s free-kick had earlier cancelled out Jordan Larsson’s opener, but Robert’s late strike for Copenhagen looked decisive until the dramatic finale.Club Brugge, last-16 qualifiers in 2024, produced a statement 4-1 win over Monaco. After Maghnes Akliouche missed a penalty for the visitors, Nicolo Tresoldi, Raphael Onyedika and Hans Vanaken all scored before Mamadou Diakhon added a fourth. Ansu Fati’s late goal was only consolation for Monaco.Portuguese champions Sporting Lisbon also impressed, brushing aside Kazakhstan’s Kairat Almaty 4-1. Francisco Trincao netted twice while Alisson Santos and Geovany Quenda struck in quick succession. Edmilson replied for Kairat, who face Real Madrid next.","Marcus Rashford scores his first goals for Barcelona in 2-1 win over Newcastle.

FC Goa responded in the eighth minute through Dejan Drazic, whose precise cross found Javier Siverio, but the striker’s header sailed over the bar.The first half remained largely cagey until Alrashdan’s superb header from Hassan Abdulkareem’s free-kick forced a sprawling save from Hrithik Tiwari.Early in the second half, Banihani cut in from the left and his attempt deflected off Nim Dorjee, but Tiwari was equal to the task again. Goa created chances of their own, with Ayush Chhetri’s rising effort tipped over and Siverio’s back-flick attempt saved by the experienced Jalal Hassan.Despite pressing for an equaliser, Goa were punished in stoppage time when Alrashdan scored a low strike from the edge of the box, confirming the 2-0 result.

Poll Was Liverpool's late win against Atletico Madrid a show of tactical brilliance? Yes, absolutely! No, it was luck.

Title-holder Paris Saint-Germain roared to victory in the Champions League on Wednesday, while Liverpool once again left it late to continue their stunning start to the season.At the Parc des Princes, PSG dismantled Atalanta 4-0 with style and confidence. Even Bradley Barcola’s missed penalty did little to dent the champions’ dominance, as coach Luis Enrique praised his players: “It’s a joy to see such a performance. I think our fans can be happy.”Nuno Mendes got on the scoresheet in the second half after Khvicha Kvaratskhelia lit up the night with a dazzling solo goal just before halftime. With Ousmane Dembélé sidelined, PSG are already campaigning for him in the upcoming Ballon d’Or awards in Paris, though Mendes and Achraf Hakimi also strengthened their claims.At Anfield, Liverpool survived another nerve-shredding finish in a 3-2 win over Atletico Madrid. Early goals from Andy Robertson and Mohamed Salah had the hosts cruising, but Marcos Llorente — who famously knocked Liverpool out in 2020 — struck twice, in first-half stoppage time and the 81st minute, to level the match. Yet the Reds had one more twist to deliver. In the 92nd minute, Virgil van Dijk rose highest to head in Dominik Szoboszlai’s corner, sealing a dramatic victory.Coach Arne Slot admitted, “We should have made it easier for ourselves.”Elsewhere, Bayern Munich avenged their 2012 final heartbreak by beating Chelsea 3-1 in Munich. Harry Kane scored twice, while Cole Palmer grabbed a fine consolation for the visitors. Inter Milan also enjoyed European nostalgia, defeating Ajax 2-0 in Amsterdam with a Marcus Thuram brace — echoing their revenge for losing the 1972 European Cup final to the Dutch giants.The debutants also made their presence felt. Norway’s Bodo/Glimt staged a late comeback to draw 2-2 at Slavia Prague. Having missed a penalty and trailing 2-0, Kasper Høgh pulled one back before substitute Sondre Brunstad Fet smashed in a stunning equaliser in the 90th minute. Goalkeeper Nikita Haikin then preserved the point with a stoppage-time save.Cypriot side Pafos earned a gritty 0-0 draw at Olympiakos despite being reduced to 10 men after Bruno Felipe’s dismissal in the 26th minute. Veteran defender David Luiz limped off injured on his debut, but the team held firm to mark Cyprus’s first main-phase appearance since 2017.The competition continues Thursday with six more fixtures, including Manchester City hosting Napoli with Kevin De Bruyne set for a return, and Barcelona travelling to Newcastle without the injured Lamine Yamal.","Paris Saint-Germain thrashed Atalanta 4-0 at the Parc des Princes.

Days after Oliver Rowland lifted his Formula E World Championship trophy in London this season, an interesting trend has come to the attention of Formula E and its fans. As a coincidence, all Formula E drivers who won the Mexico City E-Prix went on to win the Formula E World Championship that season, and this has been proved right for three consecutive years.Highlighting the same since 2023, a poster of three World Champions was shared on X by Formula E with the caption, “The trend continues. Each winner of the #MexicoCityEPrix from the past three seasons has gone on to become World Champion.”The special poster features 2023 Formula E World Champion Jake Dennis from Andretti, then TAG Heuer Porsche’s Pascal Wehrlein, who won in 2024, and the new World Champion, Nissan driver Oliver Rowland. All three of them won in the Mexico E-Prix and went on to lift the winner’s trophy in the Formula E World Championship that year.Oliver Rowland had strengthened his chances of winning the Formula E World Championship this year much earlier. He was leading the Formula E Driver Standings ever since he won Part 2 of the Jeddah E-Prix, which was his second win of the season after winning the Mexico E-Prix. In the last leg, the Nissan driver got nervous for a while as Pascal Wehrlein, who was following him in the number two position, closed the gap after grabbing quite a few podiums while Rowland had a dull period.Things became serious for Rowland when he failed to finish the Round 13 race in Berlin, while Wehrlein won second spot on the podium. But he eventually managed to confirm his championship in Berlin after four wins and three more podiums.Sharing about his bad race in Berlin, Rowland had said, “I was hoping before the weekend that the outcome could be [the World Championship], but after yesterday (Saturday) and this morning (Sunday), I was more worried that it might never come.”Also Read: Oliver Rowland reacts to daughter’s sweet radio message after Formula E Championship win: “It’s amazing” Things, however, changed for Wehrlein, who was pushed to third position after Nick Cassidy made a late entry in the Formula E Driver Standings by registering three consecutive wins. He was pushed from second place to third, with Cassidy in second. Wehrlein registered one win and five more podiums this season.Meanwhile, Andretti driver Jake Dennis finished in seventh position in the Formula E Driver Standings. He won two podium spots this season.","All three Formula E drivers who won the Mexico City E-Prix went on to win the Formula E World Championship that season.

Taylor Barnard on losing top three spot in Formula E World Championship

Fans hail Taylor Barnard for his fantastic rookie season

It was Taylor Barnard’s rookie season this year, and the NEOM McLaren driver put up a fantastic performance by temporarily making it to the top three in the Formula E Driver Standings by ousting the much more experienced Porsche driver Antonio Felix Da Costa.

Barnard took to Instagram to share his feelings on losing out on the top three in his first-ever season and his claim to the championship.Taking to Instagram after the London E-Prix, Barnard wrote, “London wasn’t what we hoped for, easily being the toughest weekend of our season. Taking 0 points away as a team from a doubleheader hurts, but one weekend doesn’t define the year we’ve had.”He further wrote, “As the season closes, I want to say a massive thank you to the entire team, both trackside and behind the scenes, for everything this season. Finishing P4 in the Drivers’ Championship and coming into the final weekend with a shot at runner-up is something to be proud of.”Also adding a note for teammate Sam Bird, as NEOM McLaren withdrew from Formula E after the end of the season, Barnard wrote, “@sambird_official it wasn’t the weekend you deserved either.You’ve been a huge part of my season both on and off the track, and I’m grateful for everything. You deserved more. To all the Papaya fans, thank you for the incredible support in our final race together. You always go above and beyond. ”Reacting to his post, a fan wrote, “An incredible debut season, huge congrats and excited to see where you go next!” Another said, “I know I said it the other day, but you’ve been incredible to watch this last year and a pleasure to support you in Papaya — there are many of us that can’t wait to support you in whatever you do next!” One more commented, “You were incredible all season around, Taylor.

We couldn’t have done it without you all — your trust and support have never been taken for granted,” he added.Praising the two McLaren drivers, he wrote, “Sam clinched McLaren’s first-ever fully electric win at the São Paulo E-Prix in Season 10, pulling off one of Formula E’s all-time great overtakes, before being waved across the line by none other than Emerson Fittipaldi – McLaren's first Formula 1 World Champion. While Taylor has been a rookie sensation in Season 11, securing five Formula E records, including the youngest driver to start a race, the youngest points scorer, the youngest driver to lead a lap, the youngest podium finisher, and the youngest polesitter. ”He ended the letter saying, “Some of us have been together since the day we first launched this team, while others have seamlessly fitted in along the way and flourished within the environment we have cultivated. For many, I am sure that we will cross paths again soon, but whatever the future holds for those here at Bicester, whatever path they choose to follow, I have no doubt that it will be bright.

The partnership extension will provide a year-round opportunity for brand-building and activation, communicating ABB and its technology solutions to new global audiences, including Formula E’s international fanbase.ABB and Formula E will also join hands to engage a new generation of fans, collaborating with unexpected influencers and content creators to tell compelling stories that make advanced electrification and automation technologies tangible and exciting.The end of the mid-race car swap, a 150kW increase in power, top speeds that are 43 percent higher, and energy recovery increasing from 15 to 50 percent indicate how far Formula E technology has come to outperform on track.ABB has also built on its technical involvement in the series, supplying the race chargers from Season 9, and introducing its ABB Ability OPTIMAX® energy management software (Season 9) and Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) technology (Season 5) to the sport.ABB Head of Brand Paco Liebrand said, “We are pleased to be continuing our partnership with Formula E which, like ABB, is striving for a leaner and cleaner future. The synergy between the two organizations, combined with the global appeal of the Championship, makes it a great platform to promote our brand positioning.”He further said, “Formula E is increasingly working with content creators, influencers, and celebrities, with initiatives such as the Evo Sessions making an impact through digital channels beyond the racing itself, which is also an essential part of ABB’s new brand strategy. Going forward, we will be enhancing the way we harness the benefits of this collaboration, ensuring the focus is on delivering content and activations that reinforce our new messaging, build familiarity, and tell the ‘Engineered to Outrun’ story. ”Formula E Chief Revenue Officer Tiziana Di Gioia said, “Our renewed partnership with ABB is a testament to the commercial power and benefit of Formula E as a global platform that drives both brand and business growth. ABB, like our wider partnership portfolio, has and continues to see enormous value in collaborating with the fastest-growing motorsport on the planet, with viewership, commercial integration, and brand storytelling continuing to accelerate.

Poll Do you think it’s important for public figures like Bjorn Borg to share personal struggles with addiction? Absolutely, it can inspire others Yes, but only if they feel comfortable Not really, it's their personal life

Swedish tennis icon Bjorn Borg has made a deeply personal revelation in his newly released autobiography Heartbeats: A Memoir, published on Thursday, disclosing his long-hidden battles with cocaine addiction and a recent prostate cancer diagnosis.The 69-year-old former world No.1, who dominated tennis in the 1970s and early 1980s, confessed that his first experience with cocaine in the early 1980s at New York’s legendary nightclub Studio 54 gave him “a rush as strong as what tennis had given me in the past.”His darkest years, Borg recounts, came in the 1990s when he was living in Milan with then-wife, Italian singer Loredana Bertè. “We had bad influences, and… drugs and pills within reach. There, I was plunged into the deepest darkness,” Borg writes.The low point arrived in 1996, when Borg collapsed on a bridge in the Netherlands just before an exhibition tournament. “When I awoke in hospital, my father was standing next to me. He said nothing, it was so embarrassing. I was terribly ashamed,” he told Swedish talk show Skavlan.In the memoir, Borg also reveals that he was diagnosed with prostate cancer in September 2023.“The risk of it coming back still exists, and it’s something I will have to live with… with the anxiety of not knowing if the cancer was caught in time,” he wrote, adding that he undergoes check-ups every six months.Despite his health challenges, Borg stressed that he exercises daily, though he admitted he has not “played tennis in six years.”The 11-time Grand Slam champion also touched on doping in modern tennis, expressing concern about junior players and questioning Jannik Sinner’s decision to rehire fitness coach Umberto Ferrara after the Italian’s brief suspension for a steroid violation.Borg, who retired shockingly at just 26 after conquering Wimbledon five times and the French Open six times, said his memoir is about confronting demons, shame, and survival.",Tennis great Bjorn Borg has released his autobiography Heartbeats: A Memoir.

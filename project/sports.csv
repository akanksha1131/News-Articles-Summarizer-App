Border-Gavaskar Trophy: How Team India can qualify for World Test Championship final,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/india-in-australia/how-team-india-can-qualify-for-world-test-championship-final/articleshow/115916093.cms,"With 15 Tests to go before this cycle ends, there are plenty of permutations and combinations that need to go in

and Co's favour

What India need to do to qualify for World Test Championship final

Scenario 1: If India beat Australia 5-0, 4-1, 4-0 or 3-0

Scenario 2: India beat Australia 3-1

Scenario 3: India beat Australia 3-2

Scenario 4: India draw series 2-2 against Australia

Scenario 5: If India lose the BGT by a 2-3 margin

The comprehensive 295-run victory against Australia in the Perth Test gave India a major boost in their attempt to qualify for the 2025 World Test Championship Final. The result pushed Australia to the second spot on the points table, while India claimed the top position.A couple of days later, the equation changed again with South Africa's emphatic triumph over Sri Lanka at Kingsmead, Durban. The victory saw the Proteas overtake Australia and claim the No. 2 spot, pushing the Aussies to No. 3.Still, there are three months left before the WTC points table is finalised, and the situation is already looking quite fluid.Practically, India, Australia, South Africa, New Zealand and Sri Lanka (the current top 5) are all in the running for the top two spots. While the victory at Perth has brightened India's hopes of going to Lord's which seemed unlikely after the 3-0 home drubbing to New Zealand, Rohit Sharma's men still have a long way to go before they can be assured of a spot in the WTC Final.TOI deconstructs the scenarios in front of India to reach the summit clash for the third successive time.A series win for India by such a comprehensive margin would see Rohit Sharma's men qualify for the final without having to depend on results of other series in the ongoing WTC cycle. Such a scoreline will all but rule out Australia, the current holders of the mace, from the race.If India secure a 3-1 victory versus Australia in the five-match series, they will be able to qualify for the final if South Africa do not beat Sri Lanka in the second Test of their ongoing series.However, a 3-1 series win for India coupled with Sri Lanka suffering a defeat to South Africa in the second Test, would see India drop out. Even a draw between South Africa and Sri Lanka would be enough for India to go through.Such a scoreline would make qualification quite tricky. This means India would need help from the Lankans, who will have to secure at least a draw against Australia in their two-match Test series in Sri Lanka starting January 29.What should serve as an encouragement to the Islanders is the fact that both the Tests are scheduled at Galle, a spin-friendly venue, where Sri Lanka are almost unbeatable. Galle to Sri Lanka is what the Gabba was to Australia before India breached the fortress in 2020-21 and West Indies did it earlier this year.If the Border-Gavaskar series ends 2-2 after five Tests, India's qualification chances reduce further. If that happens though, they would pray for South Africa to beat Sri Lanka 2-0 in the ongoing series and the Lankans beating Australia 1-0.Interestingly, even a 2-3 loss to Australia would still keep India in the hunt for a final berth. But for that, a lot of series results need to go in favour of Rohit Sharma & Co.The ongoing New Zealand-England series needs to finish 1-1, South Africa, the hosts, have to draw both the series vs Sri Lanka and the following series vs Pakistan 1-1 and finally, Sri Lanka vs Australia have to play out a 0-0 draw in the two Tests. At Galle, that seems highly improbable.","India beat Australia by 295 runs in the Perth Test. The result pushed Australia to the second spot on the points table, while India claimed the top position.

India Playing XI for Adelaide Test: Big selection headaches for India

Australia suffered a huge blow when Josh Hazlewood was ruled out of the pink-ball Test against India in Adelaide , which put the focus on right-arm pacer Scott Boland to replace him for the second Test of the Border Gavaskar Trophy . But India got a good look at Boland with the pink ball in the warm-up fixture at Canberra, which many in Australia believe has put India at an advantage.Boland was named in the Australian Prime Minister's XI squad well before Hazlewood's side strain made him unavailable for the day-night Test in Adelaide. But cricket experts and the Aussie media believe that Cricket Australia could have withdrawn him and not let India warm-up against the 35-year-old seamer.Australian journalist Tom Morris questioned if the CA selectors have done the ""right thing"".Speaking on SEN radio, Morris said: ""Did the Australian selectors do the right thing playing Scott Boland against India? Would it have been better for him and Australia to go into this game with India not having seen him with a pink ball?""Boland has played 10 Tests in his career so far since his debut in the Boxing Day Test of the 2021 Ashes series. But he has been out of the side since the Leeds Test of the Ashes in July last year.""I probably expected to play at some stage last summer with seven Tests because of the New Zealand tour as well,"" Boland was quoted as saying by yahoo.com. ""Obviously with those guys (Hazlewood, Pat Cummins and Mitchell Starc) being so resilient, they don't miss too many and no one wants to give up their spot at any stage.""They were so dominant last summer, they weren't bowling a heap of overs. We were able to win most of those games, so I probably thought maybe the opportunity had passed. I've worked really hard during the off-season to get my body in a spot where I'm confident that if I get another chance I'll be able to perform for Australia again.""Cricket Australia has added fast bowlers Sean Abbott and Brendan Doggett in the squad, but Boland remains the front-runner to replace Hazlewood.",Australia suffered a huge blow when Josh Hazlewood was ruled out of the pink- ball Test against India in Adelaide.

NEW DELHI: Former Indian off-spinner Harbhajan Singh believes skipper Rohit Sharma will feature in the top order during the second day-night Test against Australia, starting December 6 in Adelaide.Harbhajan expects Rohit to either open the innings or bat at number three, ruling out the possibility of the 37-year-old playing lower down the order in the pink-ball encounter.Rohit missed the first Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy in Perth, where KL Rahul and Yashasvi Jaiswal delivered a stunning 201-run opening partnership in the second innings. Their exceptional stand propelled India to a commanding 295-run victory.In the recently concluded warm-up game ahead of the day-night Test, Rohit came in at No.4 against Australia Prime Minister's XI that left everyone guessing about Rohit's batting slot for the second Test.""I don't see Rohit coming in at number five or six. Either Rohit will open with Yashasvi Jaiswal, with KL Rahul coming in at number three, or he will bat no later than number three,"" Harbhajan told PTI.""Number six for Rohit wouldn't be in best interest of the team. Your top four in batting order should be the four pillars and someone like Rohit at the top would only add greater fillip.""Harbhajan also commented on the selection of Washington Sundar over Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja in the first Test. He considered it a significant decision.""Washington had showed during the New Zealand series that he is ready to take over the mantle from Ashwin in coming days,"" the 'Turbanator' said.Addressing Ashwin's age as a potential factor, Harbhajan offered his perspective.""I don't think 38 is old. He is not a 58- year-old. But yes, after so many years, the shoulders do experience fatigue and wear and tear, so the zip can just be a bit less.""On the drama surrounding the upcoming ICC Champions Trophy, Harbhajan urged the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) to accept the 'Hybrid Model' which proposes that India play its matches in Dubai.""Ask all players, they would say they are ready to play in Abu Dhabi or Dubai. In any case, we don't see too many Indo-Pak games as such, and Pakistan should keep their ego aside and agree to the 'Hybrid Model'.""There is a security concern (for India) and I have been saying this since 2022,"" he added.","Harbhajan Singh believes skipper Rohit Sharma will feature in the top order during the second day-night Test against Australia.

NAGPUR: Is Ding Liren trying to repeat the script of his 2023 world championship title by stretching his match against the challenger, D Gukesh , to the tie-breaks?In a battle of strategy and nerves at the World Chess Championship in Singapore, the reigning champion appears to be biding his time, relying on patience and calculated defense to stretch his match against the 18-year-old Gukesh into tie-breaks -- a format where Ding thrives.On his way to become the world champion last year, Ding defeated Ian Nepomniachtchi in the tie-breaks -- matches in faster time control. In the shorter format, Ding is world No. 2, and Gukesh has a lowly 46th rank as per FIDE rapid ratings. In the classical format, Gukesh is world No. 5, while Ding is at the 22nd rank.While Ding seems to prefer cautious play, the youngest-ever challenger to a world title has electrified the championship with his bold, risk-taking approach. The way the challenger refused to accept the draw by repetition and chose to gamble in the crucial sixth round shows that Gukesh aims to close the championship in the classical format.Gukesh‚Äôs approach impressed world No.1 Magnus Carlsen , who suggested on Take Take Take that he wants Gukesh to take more risks which will put pressure on Ding forcing him to make a mistake. ‚ÄúHad Gukesh played King G7 on the 37th turn (instead of moving his rook), he would have won the game,‚Äù he pointed out during the Game 6 recap.When Gukesh refused to accept a draw in the sixth game, most of the computer engines thought the game would turn Ding‚Äôs way but the Indian GM thought otherwise. On Monday, when Carlsen analysed the round-6, he explained how Gukesh with black pieces could have put pressure on Ding and had a chance of winning the game as the Indian GM had active pawns.Of six games played so far, the crucial sixth round was the longest where Gukesh stretched it to 46 moves and 4 hours, 35 minutes. Gukesh and Ding have won a game each and drawn four rounds to remain at par in the championship with three points each, both are 4.5 points away from winning the title.All the four games that ended in a draw by repetition, the 32-year-old Ding was the one who initiated the action to repeat the moves.The dramatic sixth round gave the impression that Gukesh will be the one who will end the deadlock of drawn games in the championship when he didn‚Äôt accept a draw through three-fold repetition on the 26th move and eventually split the points on the 46th turn.In the fifth round, which lasted for 40 moves, Ding, with the black pieces, initiated the repetition process from the 34th turn. The game was heading towards threefold repetition, and both players agreed to split the points on the 40th move.In the fourth round, Ding had the opening advantage with the white pieces, but the Chinese GM started repeating the moves from the 38th turn and drew the game on the 42nd move.Similarly, in the second round, Ding, with the white pieces, initiated the process from the 19th turn, and after threefold repetition, the game ended in a 23-move draw. While Ding defeated Gukesh in the opening round, the Indian challenger brought parity by winning the third game.Being the youngest challenger to any world champion, Gukesh is ambitiously making his moves on the board while Ding has not been at his aggressive best. After he tried to repeat his Game 6 opening of the last year‚Äôs world championship against Nepo which Gukesh didn‚Äôt allow on Sunday, Ding in the post-game conference said, ‚ÄúLast time too, in Game Six, I won a beautiful game in London, so this time I wanted to repeat that success.‚Äù The hint is clear that the Chinese will come up with more repetition in the remaining eight games with an intention to stretch the match to tie-breaks.With six games played and both players locked at three points each, the clash is shaping up as a duel of contrasting philosophies, with Gukesh pushing to settle the score in the classical format and Ding seemingly eyeing rapid play to retain his crown.","Ding Liren and D Gukesh are locked at three points each in the World Chess Championship.

However, two other players previously involved in the same scandal received suspended sentences after entering guilty pleas.Tsolekile and Tsotsobe were apprehended in March regarding a 2015 domestic tournament match-fixing case in South Africa. A special police unit had been investigating the two players since 2016.The 2015 Ram Slam T20 tournament investigation revealed that Gulam Bodi, a former South African international batsman, approached players to manipulate matches or specific aspects of games on behalf of Indian bookmakers. Subsequently, Bodi received a five-year prison sentence for his attempts to orchestrate match-fixing.The investigation team concluded that whilst players had discussions about potential match-fixing, no actual manipulation took place.Two other players were handed suspended prison sentences after pleading guilty following their arrest in 2021 and 2022.The 44-year-old Tsolekile, a right-handed batter, has played three Tests. In 2016, he received a 12-year cricket ban. Tsotsobe, 40, is a former fast bowler who represented South Africa across all formats between 2009 and 2014.

Selection dilemma for India ahead of Adelaide Test

#LIVE: India vs Australia, Pink-Ball Test: Rohit Sharma's batting position, the ideal attack & more

NEW DELHI: The recent omissions of seasoned players Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja from the first Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy have sparked widespread discussion.Former India selector Devang Gandhi has come forward to shed light on the reasoning behind these decisions, emphasising that the team management's focus is firmly on current strategies rather than past records considering the factor when one plays in Australia or England.""I do feel that the current form has been taken into consideration. The Indian team management wanted to go in with a team that had confidence and not exactly looking at the past records,"" said Gandhi while talking to news agency PTI.With 536 Test wickets to his name, Ashwin stands as a genuine cricket legend, yet his immediate prospects appear uncertain in the ongoing Border-Gavaskar Trophy. His inclusion in the playing squad might only materialise if any of the forthcoming four pitches necessitate deploying two spin bowlers.Should the pitches continue to favour pace and bounce, as witnessed in Perth, the 38-year-old spinner faces a significant challenge in securing his spot in the playing eleven. This situation could change only if the team's preferred choice, Washington Sundar , delivers poor performances.Even in such circumstances, Jadeja, who possesses better batting statistics in SENA (South Africa, England, New Zealand, Australia) nations, is likely to be preferred over the Chennai-based spinner.""Washy bowled well against New Zealand and is a reliable lower middle-order batter. So it does make sense,"" Gandhi, who was the selector from 2016-17 to 2020-21, said.The bowling lineup is expected to remain unchanged for the Pink Ball Test in Perth, following the established pattern.It's worth noting that Ashwin's finest bowling performance in Australia and SENA nations occurred during the December 2021 Day/Night Test at Adelaide, where he claimed impressive figures of 4/55 in the only Australian innings.However, Ashwin's recent performance in the home series against New Zealand, where he managed just nine wickets despite two matches being played on spin-friendly tracks, makes it challenging for him to secure a spot in the current playing eleven.""In Australian conditions, you want a restrictive option. This is not to say that Washy can't be attacking but India's bowling game plan will revolve around Jasprit Bumrah , Mohammed Siraj and Harshit Rana. If Mohammed Shami is included at later stages then he too. So a spinner's job will be to give respite to these speed merchants and bowl one line,"" Gandhi said.""Also you need to be a steady batter. He did well in Brisbane last series and also looked good in Perth during the second essay. He batted well in Canberra. He is going to be the first choice,"" Gandhi added.The primary challenge for Ashwin lies in his inability to secure even one five-wicket haul while playing in SENA nations.His statistics in SENA countries show 71 wickets across 43 completed innings. His finest bowling performance stands at 4 for 55, while requiring 83.7 balls on average (approximately 14 overs) to claim each wicket.In comparison, Jadeja has claimed 52 wickets in 35 completed innings, including one five-wicket haul (6/138) achieved in 2014. His bowling efficiency mirrors Ashwin's at 83.7 balls (14 overs per wicket).Jadeja's preference in team selection has largely stemmed from his superior batting performances in these nations, boasting five half-centuries and one century, maintaining an average close to 30. In contrast, Ashwin has registered only two half-centuries.Their joint inclusion appears likely only at Sydney, contingent upon Washington's fitness and the pitch conditions. However, should conditions favour two spinners, the team management might opt for Jadeja ahead of Ashwin.",Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja were left out of India's squad for the first Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy. Former India selector Devang Gandhi has shed light on the reasoning behind these decisions. Gandhi says the team management's focus is firmly on current strategies rather than past records.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115906297,imgsize-43830,width-400,resizemode-4/115906297.jpg"

NEW DELHI: In an unfortunate turn of events, Nepal's spinner Yuvraj Khatri suffered an ugly injury after his wicket celebration went horribly wrong during the Under-19 Asia Cup clash against Bangladesh in Dubai on Sunday.Yuvraj badly twisted his ankle while celebrating the fall of Bangladesh wicket and had to be shouldered off the field.The incident took place in the 28th over of the Bangladesh chase when Yuvraj trapped Md Rizan Hossan in front of the stumps for a golden duck.As soon as the on-field umpire raised his finger after Nepal's appeal, Yuvraj took off for a sprint celebration, leaving behind his teammates.But then, towards the end of the celebratory jump, he badly landed on his ankle, twisting it and fell down in agonizing pain. Yuvraj's worried teammates then gathered around him as he held on to his painful left ankle. Yuvraj eventually had to leave the field on the back of his teammate's shoulder and did not return to bowl.In the six overs that Yuvraj bowled before his injury, he took four wickets, conceding just 23 runs.Earlier, Yuvraj had also given another Bangladesh batter a shoe-call send-off.Chasing 142 for victory, Bangladesh U19 eventually won the match by 5 wickets.","Nepal's spinner Yuvraj Khatri suffered an ugly injury after his wicket celebration went horribly wrong during the Under-19 Asia Cup clash against Bangladesh in Dubai on Sunday.

Who could replace Rohit Sharma as Team India's captain in Tests?

NEW DELHI: Australian all-rounder Mitchell Marsh addressed questions about his availability for the upcoming pink-ball Test , downplaying speculation with a touch of humour.Marsh experienced soreness after bowling 19.3 overs in the Perth Test, where Australia suffered a 295-run defeat to India.With the pink-ball Test posing unique challenges, Marsh‚Äôs fitness and form will be crucial as Australia seek to bounce back from their defeat in the series opener.""The body‚Äôs all good, yep.

Webster was seen practicing alongside Usman Khawaja, Nathan McSweeney, Steve Smith, Travis Head, and Alex Carey at the Adelaide Oval nets.Should Marsh retain his position in the playing eleven for the Adelaide Test, Australia will need to choose between Webster and Scott Boland as a replacement for the injured Josh Hazlewood Australia boast an impressive record at Adelaide, having won their last five Tests there, with their most recent defeat occurring against India in 2018/19. Additionally, they maintain a perfect record of seven victories in seven day-night Tests at this venue.However, Australia's unblemished record in day-night Tests came to an end in January 2024 at Brisbane, where West Indies secured an eight-run victory, breaking Australia's streak of 11 consecutive wins in this format.India, meanwhile, hold a strong record in day-night Tests, winning three out of their four matches. Their most recent day-night Test resulted in a victory against Sri Lanka in Bengaluru in March 2022.

NEW DELHI: A tragic stampede at a football stadium in southern Guinea resulted in 56 fatalities and numerous injuries following fan clashes, as announced by the Guinean government on Monday.The government has initiated an investigation to identify those responsible for the Sunday incident, according to Communications Minister Fana Soumah 's televised statement.Local media and political groups reported that children were among those who lost their lives, reported news agency AP.The incident occurred on Sunday afternoon at Nzerekore stadium during a local tournament final between Labe and Nzerekore teams, organised to honour military leader Mamadi Doumbouya , as stated by Prime Minister Amadou Oury Bah on X.Bah confirmed casualties without providing specifics, noting that regional authorities were working to stabilise the situation.According to local reports, security forces deployed tear gas to control the chaos that erupted after a contested penalty decision.Media Guinea reported that the disputed penalty sparked supporter outrage, leading to stone-throwing and subsequent tear gas deployment by security forces. The outlet noted that children were among the deceased, with several critically injured victims receiving treatment at a regional hospital.Video footage from the venue showed supporters protesting referee decisions before conflicts erupted, with spectators spilling onto the pitch.The recordings captured people fleeing the stadium, with many scaling the high perimeter fence.Additional footage showed numerous casualties on a hospital floor surrounded by people providing assistance to the wounded.The National Alliance for Alternation and Democracy opposition group demanded an inquiry, criticising the tournament as a vehicle for promoting the military leader's ""illegal and inappropriate"" political aspirations.Guinea has been under military governance since the 2021 coup that removed President Alpha Conde. It joins other West African nations, including Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso, where military takeovers have delayed civilian rule restoration.Doumbouya, who led the coup three years ago, claimed to prevent national chaos and criticised the previous administration's unfulfilled promises, though he faces criticism for not meeting public expectations.","A tragic stampede at a football stadium in southern Guinea resulted in 56 fatalities and numerous injuries.

Clashes erupted at a football match in N'Zerekore , Guinea , on Sunday, leaving many dead.According to hospital sources quoted by AFP, ""There are bodies lined up as far as the eye can see in the hospital. Others are lying on the floor in the hallways. The morgue is full.""""There are around 100 dead"", said one doctor, while another said there were ""dozens of dead"".According to witnesses, the anger was fueled by a referee's decision that was contested, after which the fans invaded the pitch and later also set the N'Zerekore police station on fire.Media reports indicated that the game was organised as part of a tournament dedicated to Guinea's current president and junta chief, Mamadi Doumbouya , who took control through a coup in 2021.In Guinea, these tournaments have become increasingly prevalent as Doumbouya appears to be positioning himself for the anticipated presidential elections next year, whilst political alignments continue to develop.In September 2021, Doumbouya, then serving as a colonel, led a successful coup against President Alpha Conde. Ironically, Conde had previously appointed Doumbouya to lead an elite unit responsible for protecting the president from such takeovers.Despite international demands and his initial commitment to transfer authority to civilian leadership by December 2024, Doumbouya has since reversed his stance and indicated he will retain power.","Clashes erupted at a football match in N'Zerekore, Guinea, on Sunday, leaving many dead.

'Good attitude again'

MADRID: Spanish champions Real Madrid beat Getafe 2-0 to move second in La Liga on Sunday with Kylian Mbappe finding the net after a difficult week.The French striker has been criticised in recent weeks for his form but after Jude Bellingham opened the scoring from the penalty spot, Mbappe slotted home a well-taken second.Later, Mbappe wasted three other big chances but Madrid were able to move within one point of league leaders Barcelona, who lost on Saturday at home against Las Palmas.Carlo Ancelotti's side have played one fewer game than the Catalans, and Atletico Madrid, third, who are one point behind.""(Mbappe) played very well, he was active, dangerous as always,"" said Ancelotti. ""He scored an important goal, he created chances in the second half and had a very active game, it's what we want from him.""Mbappe, playing in his favoured role on the left with Vinicius Junior out injured, was offered plenty of support by Madrid's fans.""The fans understand more than anyone what moment the team is in, and the players (are in),"" added Ancelotti.Getafe set out to slow the game down and they largely succeeded until Allan Nyom tugged down Antonio Rudiger in the area after half an hour.After Mbappe missed his penalty against Liverpool in the Champions League defeat at Anfield on Wednesday, Bellingham stepped up to take the spot-kick.The England international outfoxed David Soria to send Madrid ahead on the half-hour with his third goal in three league games.""Today Bellingham or Mbappe had to choose (who took the penalty), they both chose Bellingham,"" said Ancelotti.Mbappe doubled his team's lead with a superb strike seven minutes prior to the break, after Bellingham spread the ball out to him on the left flank.The France captain drove inside and curled home a low effort inside the far post for his eighth league goal of the season.Ancelotti took off Bellingham at half-time because of an apparent knock sustained in a collision with Soria, but later said he thought the midfielder would recover quickly.Mbappe produced a glorious chipped pass to put Brahim Diaz in behind early in the second period, but the Morocco international's effort sailed narrowly over the crossbar.The forward came millimetres away from scoring a second himself but after rounding Soria squeezed a shot just wide of the far post.Soria made a good save to deny Fede Valverde as Getafe battled to keep the scoreline respectable.Mbappe spurned another chance to score when he fired off-target after being played in again, but Getafe could not capitalise on his profligacy.John Patrick had the visitors' best chance with a powerful effort which hit the crossbar then the post.Mbappe had another chance in stoppage time but misfired from close range as his anxiety to prove his worth in a Madrid shirt following his summer move from Paris Saint-Germain continued to tell, despite his goal.Madrid face Athletic Bilbao in midweek, hoping to build on their run of three consecutive La Liga wins.""We've had a lot of injuries (but) we are there fighting, battling,"" said Ancelotti.

'A great day'

LIVERPOOL: Liverpool have been used to second best during Pep Guardiola's era at Manchester City , but a 2-0 victory over the crisis-hit champions left little doubt over who are the team to beat in this season's Premier League title race.Goals in either half from Cody Gakpo and Mohamed Salah at Anfield on Sunday did not do justice to the scale of the Reds' domination as City succumbed to a sixth defeat in a seven-game winless run.Arsenal and Chelsea are now Liverpool's closest challengers, nine points behind, with City 11 back and almost certain to finally loose their grip on the English top flight after an unprecedented four consecutive titles and six in the past seven seasons.Guardiola reminded the Anfield crowd of that fact by raising six fingers when taunted with chants of ""sacked in the morning"".The Catalan's defiance, though, could not mask the fact that City have rested on their laurels, while Liverpool have stepped up a level under Arne Slot.Slot appeared to have the impossible job of succeeding the much-loved Jurgen Klopp.The charismatic German brought Liverpool back to the top of English and Europeanfootball . His title triumph in 2019/2020 was the club's first for 30 years and the only blot on City's dominance in recent times.In contrast to Alex Ferguson's departure from Manchester United and Arsene Wenger's exit at Arsenal, Liverpool have turned a legendary figure leaving into a positive.Klopp did much of the groundwork himself, rejuvenating the squad over his final 18 months in charge with the signings of Gakpo, Alexis Mac Allister, Dominik Szoboszlai and Ryan Gravenberch.Slot's only summer signing, Federico Chiesa, has barely featured due to injury.But the injection of fresh blood, mixed with the experience of title winners in the prolific Salah, captain Virgil van Dijk, Andy Roberson and Trent Alexander-Arnold has proved a winning combination.Slot has been keen to give Klopp's legacy credit, but the Dutchman deserves his due for the small details that have produced a run of 18 wins from his first 20 games in all competitions.Robertson and Alexander-Arnold's narrower positions have left Liverpool less vulnerable in transition and contributed to them having the best defensive record in the league.Gravenberch has shone since being transformed into a holding midfielder, while Gakpo is finally delivering on his potential under his compatriot.Slot has also managed to keep Liverpool's momentum rolling despite constant speculation over the futures of Salah, Van Dijk and Alexander-Arnold, all of whom are out of contract at the end of the season.""City are a fantastic team, four times champions in a row and they have quality to punish any team,"" said Van Dijk. ""So, overall, it has been a great day.""It's game-by-game and stay calm. But games like this, when you win it like this, is always a good feeling.""It is not just the Premier League that Slot has so far bent to his will.Liverpool are also top of the Champions League with a perfect record from five games, including a memorable 2-0 win over Real Madrid on Wednesday.Victory over City capped a dream week, but the former Feyenoord boss was still keen to use the English and European champions as the benchmark for his side's aspirations.""Real Madrid and Manchester City have been and are so good, with managers that have won so many trophies, so it is always nice to come out of those situations as a winner,"" added Slot.""But they were able to win every single three days. We understand what we want to achieve is more than this winning once or twice, even against these big teams, if you want to win big things.""December may only be a day old, but already it is hard to see beyond Liverpool matching Manchester United's record tally for 20 English top-flight titles come May.",Liverpool beat Manchester City 2-0 in the Premier League on Sunday. Goals from Cody Gakpo and Mohamed Salah secured the win. Arne Slot's side are now nine points clear of Arsenal and Chelsea. The Dutchman has won 18 of his first 20 games in charge of Liverpool.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115881457,imgsize-70304,width-400,resizemode-4/115881457.jpg"

NEW DELHI: In a crucial La Liga encounter at the Santiago Bernabeu on Sunday, Real Madrid secured a 2-0 victory over Getafe , propelling them within striking distance of league leaders Barcelona . The match witnessed two significant moments that shaped the outcome.The first pivotal moment came when Real Madrid was awarded a penalty. Jude Bellingham , the young English midfielder, stepped up to take the spot-kick instead of Kylian Mbappe , who had missed a penalty in Real's previous Champions League match against Liverpool.Bellingham displayed composure and precision, sending the ball straight down the middle to give Real Madrid the lead.The second defining moment occurred in the 38th minute when Kylian Mbappe doubled Real Madrid's advantage.The French striker showcased his clinical finishing abilities by expertly converting a brilliant pass from Bellingham, whipping the ball into the net from outside the box. This goal marked Mbappe's 10th across all competitions for Real Madrid this season.With this victory, Real Madrid climbed to second place in the La Liga table, accumulating 33 points from 14 matches.They trail their fierce rivals Barcelona by a single point, although Barcelona has played one game more. On the other hand, Getafe's struggles continued as they remain in 17th place, having collected only 13 points from 15 matches.The match highlighted the attacking acumen of Real Madrid's young talents, Bellingham and Mbappe, who combined effectively to secure the three points.Their contributions were instrumental in keeping Real Madrid's title aspirations alive as they continue to chase Barcelona in the race for the La Liga crown.","Real Madrid secured a 2-0 victory over Getafe at the Santiago Bernabeu.

P.V. Sindhu, a two-time Olympic medalist, confirmed her plans to continue playing badminton for the next few years, with the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics in mind. Her recent victory at the Syed Modi International badminton tournament ended a title drought and brought her relief.Sindhu hopes this win marks a new phase of success in her career. The 29-year-old former world champion acknowledges that staying injury-free is crucial as she moves forward.‚ÄúThis (win) will definitely give me a lot of confidence. Being 29 is an advantage in many ways because I have a lot of experience. Being smart and experienced is key, and I'm definitely going to play for the next couple of years.‚ÄùSindhu recognizes the benefits of experience at her age. She emphasizes the importance of strategic play and plans to continue competing. Her primary focus remains on injury prevention.‚ÄúMy main goal is to stay injury-free, which is very, very important. Los Angeles (Olympics) is still too far away. I will definitely play, but the main thing is staying injury-free and enjoying the sport. If I stay fit, then why not?‚ÄùWhile the Los Angeles Olympics are a long-term goal, Sindhu intends to participate if she remains fit. She defeated China's Wu Luo Yu in the Syed Modi International final, securing her third title in this tournament. Her previous wins were in 2017 and 2022.‚ÄúI'm very happy that I'm finishing off with a win. Now it's time to just go back, relax, and start again from January. I hope this is a comeback, and I'm looking forward to many more victories.‚ÄùSindhu expresses her happiness at ending the year with a victory. She plans to rest and prepare for upcoming tournaments in Malaysia, India, Indonesia, and Thailand.‚ÄúI'll be playing the upcoming tournaments in Malaysia, India, Indonesia, and Thailand. Obviously, we'll have to pick and choose tournaments because I'll have to be smart enough to decide what to play and what not. I need to be much smarter in terms of that.‚ÄùSindhu will carefully select tournaments to manage her schedule and fitness. Her previous title was at the Singapore Open in July 2022. She was also a finalist at the Malaysia Masters Super 500 earlier this year. However, she experienced a pre-quarterfinal exit at the Paris Olympics.‚ÄúSometimes I was really close yet so far away. I had good matches in the past, but they didn't turn into wins. I came back, fought harder, and it was important for me to get this win. Yes, I am relieved. I mean, it's the end of the year, and finishing off with a win makes me really grateful.‚ÄùSindhu reflects on past near misses and expresses gratitude for her recent win. Lakshya Sen , the 2021 World Championships bronze medalist, won the men's singles final against Singapore's Jia Heng Jason Teh.‚ÄúI am really happy with the way I had prepared and how I played the match. I hope to do well in the tournaments next year. I have some time now till the new season, which will allow me to train and focus on the upcoming events.‚ÄùSen expresses satisfaction with his preparation and performance. He looks forward to the next season and plans to utilize the time for training. The Indian women's doubles pair of Treesa Jolly and Gayatri Gopichand won their first Super 300 title. They defeated China's Bao Li Jing and Li Qian.‚ÄúWe really wanted to win, we were aggressive and kept moving well. There was a strategy, and we implemented it well today. We plan to go with the flow and see what the future holds. We don't want to make too many plans.‚ÄùGayatri and Treesa highlight their aggressive strategy and successful implementation. They prefer to remain adaptable for future tournaments. This victory boosts their confidence ahead of the BWF World Tour Finals in China, where they are the sole Indian representatives.‚ÄúThis is our first gold, and it's a great boost for both of us. It has given us a lot of confidence, and we are looking forward to the World Tour Finals now.‚ÄùThe pair view their win as a significant confidence booster for the upcoming World Tour Finals. They are the first Indian women's doubles team to win the Syed Modi International title. They were runners-up in 2022.‚ÄúThe first game was close, but we listened to our coaches, corrected ourselves, and executed the plans. At this level, there is always pressure, and we managed it well.‚ÄùTreesa and Gayatri credit their coaches for helping them adjust their strategy during the match. They acknowledge the pressure at this level of competition and their ability to handle it effectively.","P.V. Sindhu confirmed her plans to continue playing badminton for the next few years.

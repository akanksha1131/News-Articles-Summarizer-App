NEW DELHI: India kick off their Asia Cup 2025 campaign on Wednesday against hosts United Arab Emirates at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium. With eight Asia Cup titles, the most by any team, the defending champions will aim for a record-extending ninth crown under skipper Suryakumar Yadav and head coach Gautam Gambhir.India arrive in the UAE as favourites, carrying an outstanding record of 24 wins and only three losses since last year’s global tournament.At the pre-match press conference, Suryakumar highlighted both the challenge of facing UAE and the luxury of having part-time bowling options in the squad.“They (UAE) play an exciting brand of cricket. Recently they came very, very close against strong teams. We are really excited to play them,” he said.On India’s depth, he added: “We don’t want to rely too much on part-timers, but when a top or middle-order batter gives you an extra over, it’s always good for the captain. On slow pitches, that flexibility can be crucial.”In red-hot form after the Anderson–Tendulkar Trophy in England, Gill has already scored 578 runs in 21 T20Is, including a blazing 126 and four half-centuries*.India’s strike bowler was brilliant in the 2024 T20 World Cup, taking 15 wickets in 8 matches at 8.27 apiece.Across 70 T20Is, he has 89 wickets with a miserly economy of 6.27.The teams have met just once in T20Is — the 2016 Asia Cup, where UAE were restricted to 81/9 before India chased the target inside 11 overs.: September 10, Wednesday: 8:00 PM IST / 6:30 PM local: Dubai International Cricket StadiumSony Sports Network, SonyLIV: Suryakumar Yadav (C), Shubman Gill (VC), Abhishek Sharma, Tilak Varma, Hardik Pandya, Shivam Dube, Axar Patel, Jitesh Sharma (WK), Jasprit Bumrah, Arshdeep Singh, Varun Chakaravarthy, Kuldeep Yadav, Sanju Samson (WK), Harshit Rana, Rinku Singh.Reserves: Prasidh Krishna, Washington Sundar, Riyan Parag, Dhruv Jurel, Yashasvi Jaiswal.: Muhammad Waseem (C), Alishan Sharafu, Aryansh Sharma, Asif Khan, Dhruv Parashar, Ethan D’Souza, Haider Ali, Harshit Kaushik, Junaid Siddique, Matiullah Khan, Muhammad Farooq, Muhammad Jawadullah, Muhammad Zohaib, Rahul Chopra, Rohid Khan, Simranjeet Singh, Saghir Khan.","India kick off their Asia Cup 2025 campaign against hosts United Arab Emirates in Dubai on Wednesday.

NEW DELHI: UAE skipper Muhammad Waseem is not caught up in the hype of their Asia Cup opener against India. For him and his team, the focus is on keeping things straightforward—sticking to their plans and seizing opportunities as they arise. The UAE have been steadily working their way up the Asian cricket ladder, drawing inspiration from Afghanistan’s remarkable rise to become a formidable force in the region. Their qualification for the 2022 T20 World Cup stands as proof of their growing potential, and now they aim to build on those experiences to launch their campaign on a positive note.""We will not take it as a big match because all the teams are good in front of you, so all the matches will be the same. We are working hard in the heat, and we will only follow our plan. Whatever we have learned and whatever we need to do on that day, we will do it. Rest, the result is up to the game,"" Waseem said.Unlike many captains, Waseem doesn’t believe in singling out one opposition player to target. Instead, his team has prepared strategies designed to collectively limit India’s key batters while managing their strike bowlers smartly.""No, we have not made any individual plan for any particular player. We have created a plan for 6-7 batters for the whole team. We will not give their strength to the strength. We will play carefully with their wicket-taker bowler, and whoever we can charge, we have made such a plan. If the unit is more, the role of the spinners can increase,"" he added.India boast a strong spin department with Kuldeep Yadav, Varun Chakravarthy and Axar Patel in the ranks. However, Waseem feels conditions could neutralize their impact, especially if dew comes into play. Playing on familiar home surfaces is another factor he hopes will tilt the balance.""Whenever there is dew, I think the spinner's ball doesn't turn much. But it depends on the weather tomorrow and the conditions. And as I have told you, whatever we have learned. Yes, you are right that we play a lot of cricket here. We can also say that India and Pakistan play a lot of cricket here. But it is our home. So we will try our best to take advantage of and play good cricket,"" he concluded.",UAE captain Muhammad Waseem is not caught up in the hype of their Asia Cup opener against India.

FIDE Grand Swiss: World chess champion D Gukesh suffers second straight loss; Arjun Erigaisi stays in hunt,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/chess/fide-grand-swiss-world-chess-champion-d-gukesh-suffers-second-straight-loss-arjun-erigaisi-stays-in-hunt/articleshow/123792602.cms,"D Gukesh (Image credit: FIDE)

World champion D Gukesh suffered his second straight defeat at the FIDE Grand Swiss, losing to Greece's Nikolas Theodorou in the sixth round here on Tuesday.Coming off a loss to youngest-ever Grandmaster Abhimanyu Mishra of the USA in the previous round, Gukesh endured another heartbreak from a drawn position as he over pressed leading to complications and was punished.At the top of the table , Arjun Erigaisi had little trouble holding sole leader Parham Maghsoodloo of Iran from the black side of a queen pawn game.Even though the Iranian still holds the sole lead on five points from his six games, Erigaisi made sure he is within striking distance of the leader just a half point behind on 4.5.Abhimanyu Mishra, Matthias Bluebaum of Germany and Nihal Sarin jointly share the second spot alongside Erigaisi post the half way stage in this very significant and the strongest Swiss tournament of the world.On a day when top seeded Grandmaster R Praggnanadhaa failed to break the solid defenses of Rauf Mamedov of Azerbaijan, his sister R Vaishali cruised past Ulviyya Fataliyeva to remain in joint lead with Kateryna Lagno in the women's section.Vaishali remained in joint lead with FIDE representative Kateryna Lagno, who had to work hard to beat Dinara Wagner from what was probably a drawn endgame.Vaishali was in total control with her black pieces as she launched an offensive on both flanks and was rewarded with a winning rook and pawns endgame thanks to her extra pawn.Gukesh wanted to win at all costs and that proved catastrophic. The world champion could have drawn the rook and pawns endgame but a rare miscalculation cost him.Now on fifty percent, Gukesh has to win at least four of the remaining five games to stay in contention.Praggnanandhaa tried his best but for once Mamedov did not budge while Sarin benefitted from a huge tactical oversight by his polish opponent Szymon Gumularz to move up the charts.With the lone rest day scheduled on Wednesday the battle for the top two places and 855000 USD prize fund will resume on Thursday in both the sections.The top two from each section will make it to the Candidates tournament of 2026 that will determine the challenger for the next World Championship match in both men and women section.Important and Indian results round 6 open (Indians unless specified): Parham Maghsoodloo (Iri, 5) drew with Arjun Erigaisi (4.5); Matthias Bluebaum (Ger, 4.5) drew with Abhimanyu Mishra (Usa, 4.5); Marcandria Maurizzi (Fra, 4) lost to Anish Giri (Ned, 4.5); Amin Tabatabaei (Iri, 4) drew with Alireza Firouzja (Fra, 4); Maxim Rodshtein (Isr, 4) drew with Nodirbek Abdusattorov (Uzb, ); Yagiz Kaan Erdogmus (Tur, 4) drew with Shakhriyar Mamedyarov (Aze, 4); Szymon Gumularz (Pol, 3.5) lost to Nihal Sarin (4.5); Nodirbek Yakubboev (Uzb, 4) drew with V Pranav (3.5); R Praggnanandhaa (3.5) drew with Rauf Mamedov (Aze, 3.5); D Gukesh (3) lost to Nikolas Theodorou (Gre, 4); Anton Demchenko (Slo, 3) lost to Vidit Gujrathi (4); Abhimanyu Puranik (3.5) drew with Richard Rapport (Hun, 3.5); P Harikrishna (3) drew with Ediz Gurel (Tur, 3); Deac Bogdan-Daniel (Rou, 2.5) Leon Luke Mendonca (2.5); Aydin Suleymanli (Aze, 3) drew with Raunak Sadhwani (3); Aditya Mittal (3) drew with Boris Gelfand (Isr, 3); S L Narayanan (3) drew with Nils Grandelius (Swe, 3); Vladislav Artemiev (Fid, 2.5) drew with Aryan Chopra (2.5); Gabriel Sargissian (Arm, 2.5) drew with Divya Deshmukh (2.5); Murali Karthikeyan (1.5) drew with Abdisalimov Abdimalik (Uzb, 1.5).Women: Kateryna Lagno (Fid, 5) beat Dinara Wagner (Ger, 4); Ulviyya Fataliyeva (Aze, 4) lost to R Vaishali (5); Tan Zhongyi (Chn, 3.5) lost to Antoaneta Stefanova (Bul, 4.5); Afruza 0Khamdamova (Uzb, 4) drew with Bibisara Assaubayeva (Kaz, 4); Olga Girya (Fid, 3.5) drew with Yuxin Song (Chn, 3); Dronavalli Harika (3.5) beat Gulrukhbegim Tokhirjonova (Uzb, 2.5); Vantika Agrawal (2.5) beat Lina Nassr (Alg, 1.5)","World champion D Gukesh suffered his second straight defeat at the FIDE Grand Swiss, losing to Greece's Nikolas Theodorou in the sixth round.

'Million feelings, zero words': Chahal breaks silence after Dhanashree’s slams him

NEW DELHI: Choreographer Dhanashree Verma’s separation from Indian cricketer Yuzvendra Chahal has remained one of the most talked-about controversies of the year. Since the divorce, she has been subjected to relentless trolling, with many unfairly branding her a “gold digger. ” Now seen on the reality show Rise And Fall, Dhanashree has spoken candidly about her marriage, the backlash she has faced, and how she has chosen dignity over negativity. She also took subtle digs at both Chahal and the trolls during a recent task on the show.While interacting with fellow contestants, Dhanashree reflected on her journey after the split. She admitted that there are several things she could reveal but stressed that respect matters the most to her.In a clip from the episode, she said: “When you are married, you also hold the responsibility of safeguarding your partner’s respect. If I wanted, I could have disrespected him too. Don’t think I have nothing to say as a woman — I do. But he was my husband. I respected him during our marriage, and even now, I continue to respect the fact that he was my husband.”In another promo of Rise And Fall, Dhanashree was seen hitting back at trolls in her own witty style.During a task, contestants had to choose between a gold bag worth ?2 lakh and a silver bag worth ?1 lakh. She was paired with actor Arjun Bijlani, who jokingly remarked, “Gold suits me better than silver or diamonds.”Seizing the moment, Dhanashree gave a tongue-in-cheek response that seemed aimed at the criticism she has faced since the divorce. She quipped: “That’s a line I can’t use. If I say it, then even the love I might get in the future won’t come my way.”Her remarks not only highlighted her composure but also showed her ability to handle negativity with sharp wit and grace.","Dhanashree Verma's separation from Indian cricketer Yuzvendra Chahal has remained one of the most talked-about controversies of the year.

NEW DELHI: Afghanistan captain Rashid Khan admitted that managing his team’s rich spin resources can be a tricky task, but said the depth also makes his job easier after their commanding 94-run win over Hong Kong in the Asia Cup opener on Tuesday. Opting to bat, Afghanistan put up 188/6, before using seven different bowlers to restrict Hong Kong to 94/9.""That is a very tough task, (selecting) the playing eleven (as well). To keep Mujeeb out is a tough decision, then Noor as well (was left out) in some games. I forgot to bowl my two overs (tonight at first),"" Rashid said at the post-match presentation.""You have to see who is more successful against a particular batter (and then see). Good thing is that I have options and that makes the job easier.""Afghanistan were reduced to 26/2 before Azmatullah Omarzai’s late assault lifted them to a competitive total. Rashid, however, noted the team’s recurring weakness at the top.""It was a great game. Good to put the total on the board. But losing wickets early on is the key for us. We had the same issue in the last series (against Pakistan). That's one area we have to look into. Upcoming games are very important and that is an area if we can make it better… Batting in the death overs was a great effort, especially Omarzai. Overall, it was a great performance.""On the decision to bat first, Rashid explained:""We have good spinners. It puts pressure on the opposition. If you have runs on the board… with batters trying to take risks, that is where you are more effective (as spinners), and that is why we are defending better than chasing.But in T20, we have to chase also, so the mentality has to be to chase as well and have a good record.""Player of the Match Omarzai smashed 53 off 21 balls with five sixes and two fours, before contributing with the ball as well.""Very tough batting in the lower order. It is all about belief. The captain and coach have belief in me. Was trying to hit it straight. We lost early wickets. I was speaking to Atal that we will go for boundaries after the 16th over,"" said Omarzai.""When I get the ball, I feel I am a proper bowler. When I get to bat, I feel I am a proper batter.""Hong Kong skipper Yasim Murtaza admitted Omarzai’s knock turned the match.""Just feels like a dream come true (on playing the Asia Cup). It is one of the biggest tournaments in Asia. To be honest, we weren't expecting that kind of total. I was expecting 150. Credit to Omarzai, he changed the game. Babar Hayat with the bat and the spinners were positive from the game.""",Afghanistan beat Hong Kong by 94 runs in the Asia Cup opener on Tuesday.

On Shubman Gill's 26th birthday, his childhood friend and teammate Abhishek Sharma gifted him a red rose.India's Test cricket captain Shubman Gill, who turned 26 on Monday, has established himself as a dominant force across all cricket formats since his debut in 2019.Abhishek Sharma posted an Instagram story for his friend with the caption ""Mubaraka janamdinn diya Gill saab"" with a heart emoji.As he continues to be a formidable figure in India's batting department, one question that has been associated with Gill has been the jersey number on his back. Gill narrated the tale of how 77 wasn't his initial preference but a choice that came after he yearned for the number he wanted, which wasn't available.""My jersey number is 77, and the reason behind getting it was when I played the Under-19 World Cup and wanted number seven, but it wasn't available, so I took two sevens,"" Gill said in a video posted by Star Sports on X.Gill opened up about the legendary batting stalwart Sachin Tendulkar being his idol when he was growing up, while 'Chase Master' Virat Kohli turned into his current favourite. Gill went on to disclose the name of his best friend in the team, Ishan Kishan.""My cricketing idol growing up was Sachin sir. My current favourite cricketer is Virat Kohli. My best friend in the team is Ishan Kishan,"" Gill said.The youngest Indian Test skipper has engaged in riveting battles against modern-day greats and the rising young generation. But the one that he relishes the most is against the Indian pace spearhead, Jasprit Bumrah. Their most recent encounter was during India's practice session in the nets before the Asia Cup, which was a cat-and-mouse chase.""One battle I enjoy the most is facing Bumrah in the nets. He is always on you, and he never gives you an inch. He always wants to intimidate you, show you that he is the best,"" he said.He also shared the nickname that is associated with him and the importance that his family holds in his life, and added, ""My nickname is Kaka, which in Punjabi means baby. The first person I call after winning the match is my dad. One thing I can't live without is my family.""","India's Test cricket captain Shubman Gill, who turned 26 on Monday, has established himself as a dominant force across all cricket formats.

NEW DELHI: South Africa’s young batting sensation Dewald Brevis made history on Tuesday as he became the most expensive player in SA20 history, going for a staggering R16.5 million (approx. Rs 8.3 crore) to the Pretoria Capitals during the Season 4 SA20 auction. The 22-year-old, holder of South Africa’s highest individual T20I score, triggered a frenzied bidding war that saw franchises pull out all stops to secure his services.Brevis had been associated with MI Cape Town since the league’s inception in 2023, scoring 676 runs in 32 matches at an average of 29.39 and a strike rate of over 145. His breakout performance came during MI Cape Town’s maiden title-winning campaign, where he amassed 291 runs in 10 matches at a stunning strike rate of 184.17, including two half-centuries.Durban’s Super Giants also had a marquee signing, snapping up two-time SA20 winner Aiden Markram for R14 million (approx. Rs 7.05 crore). Markram, who had an impressive IPL 2025 campaign with Lucknow Super Giants, will bring leadership and experience to the DSG squad. Meanwhile, seasoned leg-spinner Imran Tahir, 46, was acquired by Joburg Super Kings for R600,000 (approx.

Afghanistan secured a convincing 94-run victory over Hong Kong in their Asia Cup opener. The match was highlighted by impressive fifties from Sediqullah Atal and Azmatullah Omarzai , followed by a disciplined bowling performance.Afghanistan posted a total of 188 for six, with Atal remaining unbeaten on 73 off 52 balls and Omarzai scoring 53 off 21 balls.The Afghan bowling attack, spearheaded by Fazalhaq Farooqi with 2/16 and Gulbadin Naib with 2/8, restricted Hong Kong to 94 for nine.Hong Kong's chase faltered early as they lost four wickets during the Power Play, leaving them at 23 for four.The pressure led to two run-outs involving Nizakat Khan and Kalhan Challu.

Asia Cup press conference: Suryakumar Yadav on playing Pakistan, Sanju Samson, India Playing XI

Poll Do you agree with Ravichandran Ashwin's view that the Asia Cup lacks competitiveness? Yes, I agree No, I disagree

NEW DELHI: Former Indian off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin has delivered a scathing assessment of the ongoing Asia Cup 2025, questioning whether the tournament offers any real challenge to Team India. The eight-nation event began on Tuesday in Abu Dhabi with Afghanistan facing Hong Kong, but Ashwin believes the format lacks competitiveness.Speaking on his YouTube channel, Ashwin quipped: “They can almost include a South Africa and make it an Afro-Asia Cup to make the tournament competitive. As it is now, they should probably include an India A side for it to be some contest. We’ve not even spoken about Bangladesh. Because there is nothing to talk about with them. How are these teams going to even compete against India?”Team India enters the Asia Cup as firm favourites, having won 17 of their last 20 T20Is, since the 2024 T20 World Cup triumph. Ashwin admitted he hopes for a surprise winner purely to inject excitement into the regional competition. “In a way, I really hope someone else wins the tournament. Because only then will there be a contest in Asia. None of these teams pick Kuldeep or Varun. And we’ve not even spoken about India’s powerful batting line-up, which has match-winners galore. ”The 38-year-old also brushed aside suggestions that the Asia Cup could act as a build-up to the 2026 T20 World Cup in India and Sri Lanka.“This is not some curtain raiser for the 2026 T20 World Cup, it’s only a curtain. This tournament isn’t some major yardstick for it. Even against the so-called threat of the Afghanistan bowlers, if India bat well and score 170+, who will Afghanistan chase this down with? It’s nearly impossible. ”Ashwin summed up the challenge for rivals bluntly: “The only way to defeat India is by somehow restricting them to 155 on a good day, and then chase it down. Normally a T20 is thrilling but India will likely make even that one-sided in this Asia Cup.”India begin their campaign against the UAE in Dubai on Wednesday.","Ravichandran Ashwin believes the Asia Cup 2025 lacks competitiveness.

Poll Do you think Dewald Brevis is worth the record price of R16.5 million? Yes, he's a game-changer. No, that's too much.

NEW DELHI: Dewald Brevis has shattered records to become the most expensive player in SA20 history, with Pretoria Capitals signing the 22-year-old batting sensation for a staggering R16.5 million (approximately Rs 8.3 crore). The bid, led by new Capitals head coach Sourav Ganguly, surpassed the previous high for Aiden Markram and set the auction room abuzz.The bidding war began the moment Brevis’ name was announced, as Joburg Super Kings and Paarl Royals engaged in a heated contest. Within minutes, the figure had crossed the 10-million mark, drawing applause from the room. After the Royals backed out, JSK looked set to secure their man, but Ganguly’s Capitals swooped in at R10.1 million. The back-and-forth between Stephen Fleming ’s Super Kings and Ganguly’s Capitals continued relentlessly, pushing the price higher.The defining moment came when JSK raised the paddle to R15 million, forcing the Capitals to pause. But Ganguly, determined to land the Proteas star, returned with R16.5 million. With Fleming eventually signalling JSK were done, the Capitals sealed the record deal to a collective sigh of relief.Speaking after the dramatic buy, Ganguly praised Brevis’ rising stature in world cricket: “I hope he does well.I think he is a tremendous talent. His game has really progressed over the last one and a half year, as we saw against Australia. On that tour, he showed he is a game-changer, and that’s exactly what you need in T20 cricket. We have Russell, Rutherford, who can really step it up, and I hope Brevis does the same.”Importantly, Ganguly stressed that the value lay in Brevis’ skills rather than the price tag: “I never associate performance with money. Leaving aside the R16.5 million, I believe he is a fantastic talent. He plays spin very well, which is extremely important, and taking everything into account, that’s why he went for that price.”Brevis, who made waves as a replacement signing for Chennai Super Kings in IPL 2025, had scored 225 runs in six matches at a blistering strike rate of 180, including two half-centuries. Now, as the costliest-ever SA20 signing, he will carry the weight of expectations as Pretoria Capitals aim to make history under Ganguly’s leadership.","Dewald Brevis has become the most expensive player in SA20 history.

Arjun Tendulkar, son of Indian cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar , has caught attention with a cryptic message on social media.On Monday, the young all-rounder posted: “In the middle of nowhere and I am heading into nowhere.”The post, his first since his reported engagement with Saaniya Chandok last month, left fans puzzled about its meaning.Arjun’s engagement with Saaniya Chandok, granddaughter of noted Mumbai industrialist Ravi Ghai, was a private affair attended only by close friends and relatives.Neither the Tendulkar family nor the Ghai family has issued an official statement, maintaining discretion around the ceremony.Saaniya’s family is well-established in the food and hospitality sector, with ownership of the InterContinental hotel and Brooklyn Creamery.Known for her low public profile, she has largely stayed away from the limelight.Arjun, 25, currently plays domestic cricket for Goa and is part of the Mumbai Indians setup in the IPL . A left-arm fast bowling all-rounder, he began his senior career with Mumbai in the 2020-21 season before moving to Goa, where he made his List A and first-class debuts.His IPL debut came in 2023 against Kolkata Knight Riders at the Wankhede Stadium.In first-class cricket, Arjun has played 17 matches, taking 37 wickets, including a five-wicket haul, while also scoring a century and two half-centuries lower down the order.His List A record includes 17 appearances, while in the IPL he has featured in five matches, claiming three wickets with best figures of 1/9.His economy rate of 9.36 and strike rate of 24.3 reflect a work-in-progress bowler still finding his footing at the elite level.While his cricket career remains in its early stages, Arjun’s personal life has increasingly drawn public curiosity.His latest cryptic post has only fueled speculation, though whether it was reflective of his mood or simply poetic expression remains unclear.","Arjun Tendulkar posts cryptic message on social media.

Asia Cup press conference: Suryakumar Yadav on playing Pakistan, Sanju Samson, India Playing XI

Poll Who do you think will win the India vs Pakistan match? India Pakistan

NEW DELHI: Dubai is buzzing with anticipation ahead of the Asia Cup 2025, but one surprising detail has left fans and experts stunned. With less than a week to go for the blockbuster India vs Pakistan clash on September 14, tickets for the high-voltage contest are still available — despite some prices soaring to more than Rs 2.5 lakh for just two seats.The stage was set on Tuesday in Dubai for the official captains’ press conference. Organisers carefully arranged seating, keeping India skipper Suryakumar Yadav and Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha apart, with Afghanistan’s Rashid Khan seated in between. The move avoided direct proximity of the two arch-rival leaders and maintained a composed atmosphere ahead of what remains cricket’s fiercest rivalry.While India open their campaign against hosts UAE on September 10, the marquee showdown against Pakistan four days later has long been the talk of the tournament. Traditionally, tickets for this fixture are snapped up within hours. But this year, the combination of eye-watering prices and packaged sales appears to have slowed demand.On the ticketing portals (viagogo and platinumlist), a pair of seats in the VIP Suites East is listed at a staggering Rs 257,815.The package includes aisle seating, unlimited food and drinks, a parking pass, VIP club/lounge access, and private entrance and restrooms. The Royal Box comes at Rs 230,700 for two, while the Sky Box East is priced at Rs 167,851. Even mid-tier categories remain costly — Platinum at Rs 75,659, Grand Lounge at Rs 41,153, Pavilion West at Rs 28,174 — while the most affordable, General East, still costs nearly Rs 10,000 for two.The fact that premium tickets remain unsold is a rare sight for an India-Pakistan contest, traditionally regarded as the hottest ticket in world cricket.“Aggression (is) always there on field and you can’t do without aggression if you want to win,” India captain Suryakumar Yadav declared, signalling his team will bring intensity to the clash. His counterpart Salman Agha struck a calmer tone, saying he leaves it to individuals to express themselves.India, eight-time champions and defending title-holders, will be looking to extend their dominance.","Tickets for India vs Pakistan Asia Cup clash are still available.

Poll How concerned are you about the security situation in Doha during the matches? Very concerned Somewhat concerned

India’s U23 men’s national football team stamped their authority in Group H of the AFC U23 Asian Cup Qualifiers, routing Brunei Darussalam 6-0 at the Suheim Bin Hamad Stadium in Doha on Tuesday. The Blue Colts, already having beaten Bahrain 2-0 and narrowly losing to hosts Qatar 1-2, finished their campaign with six points, leaving qualification hopes dependent on other results.Midfielder Vibin Mohanan was the star of the show, scoring a rapid-fire hat-trick in the 5th, 7th, and 62nd minutes. Ayush Chhetri (41’) and Mohammed Aimen (87’, 90+7’) added three more for a comprehensive victory.India wasted no time asserting dominance, with Muhammed Suhail’s cutback setting up Vibin for the opener in the fifth minute, followed by a looping second goal that left Brunei goalkeeper helpless. A fine one-two between Chhetri and Sreekuttan MS set up India’s third, before Vibin completed his hat-trick with a curling free-kick in the second half. Aimen’s long-range strikes sealed the emphatic 6-0 win.However, the celebrations in Doha were overshadowed by security concerns.Several explosions were reported across the Qatari capital, with smoke rising over the Katara district. Israeli media cited senior officials, reporting that the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and Israeli Security Agency (ISA) targeted senior Hamas leaders allegedly responsible for orchestrating attacks against Israel, including the October 7 strikes.The IDF stated that “precise munitions” were used with additional intelligence to minimise civilian casualties. Israeli Prime Minister confirmed full responsibility, while US President Donald Trump reportedly approved the operation, according to Israeli Channel 12.Despite the tense backdrop, India’s youngsters remained focused on the pitch, dominating Brunei with clinical finishing and controlled possession. The Blue Colts now await the Bahrain-Qatar result at the Abdullah bin Khalifa Stadium, which could see India finishing top of the group depending on the scoreline. Should Qatar hold or win, India would need a UAE victory by four or more goals over Iran to advance as one of the best runners-up.Coach Moosa and his squad will hope to carry this momentum forward, even as the international community monitors the unfolding security situation in Doha.","India beat Brunei Darussalam 6-0 at the Suheim Bin Hamad Stadium in Doha.

NEW DELHI: India etched their name in Central Asian football history on Monday, by securing a bronze medal in their maiden appearance at the CAFA Nations Cup. The Blue Tigers defeated higher-ranked Oman 3-2 on penalties after the third-place playoff ended 1-1 at the Hisor Central Stadium in Hisor, Tajikistan.The evening saw plenty of drama as Udanta Singh Kumam’s 80th-minute header cancelled out Jameel Al Yahmadi’s opener in the 55th minute, taking the contest into extra time. Oman were reduced to ten men when Ali Al Busaidi was sent off in the 96th minute, but despite India’s late dominance, the match went to a penalty shootout.In the shootout, Lallianzuala Chhangte, Rahul Bheke, and Jithin MS held their nerves to score for India, while Anwar Ali’s effort was saved and Udanta fired wide. For Oman, only Thani Al Rushaidi and Muhsen Al Ghassani converted, with Harib Al Saadi and Ahmed Al Kaabi missing the target. The decisive moment came when Indian skipper Gurpreet Singh Sandhu dived full stretch to save Al Yahmadi’s final kick, sparking wild celebrations as India sealed a historic podium finish.The match itself was an end-to-end affair. India began brightly, with Vikram Partap Singh and Chhangte troubling the Omani defence on the flanks.An early chance fell to defender Anwar Ali, whose powerful header was superbly saved by goalkeeper Ibrahim Al Mukhaini.

- Depay makes Dutch history -

NEW DELHI: Mikel Merino scored a hat-trick as a majestic Spain thumped Turkey 6-0 away in World Cup qualifying on Sunday, while a brilliant Florian Wirtz free-kick helped Germany beat Northern Ireland 3-1 to get their bid up and running. European champions Spain were in unstoppable form in the central Turkish city of Konya, claiming their second biggest-ever away win in World Cup qualifying as Arsenal midfielder Merino scored his first professional hat-trick.Barcelona playmaker Pedri Gonzalez opened the scoring inside six minutes and later completed the scoring, with Ferran Torres netting the visitors' other goal.The quality of Merino's strikes was remarkable, with his first coming at the end of a superb team move and his second a controlled finish from a Pedri assist. He completed his triple with a curling shot into the top corner.The one blemish on the night's work for Spain was the withdrawal of Nico Williams due to an apparent thigh injury, but Luis de la Fuente's team are already clear at the top of qualifying Group E with six points from two games.""I'm very happy for winning, to pick up six points, for doing it in this way, and for scoring three goals, which is not normal -- the first hat-trick of my career,"" said Merino.The group winners will qualify directly for the finals, with the runners-up progressing to a play-off phase.Georgia and Turkey come next on three points each, with the former beating Bulgaria 3-0 in Tbilisi thanks to goals by captain Khvicha Kvaratskhelia, Nika Gagnidze and Georges Mikautadze.Germany were under pressure after losing their opening qualifier 2-0 in Slovakia on Thursday, and it took them until the final quarter of their home meeting with Northern Ireland in Cologne before they could secure the victory.Serge Gnabry gave the hosts an early lead only for Isaac Price of West Bromwich Albion to equalise before half-time.The home fans were unhappy with Julian Nagelsmann's team, but they eventually retook the lead on 69 minutes when substitute Nadiem Amiri turned in David Raum's cross.Liverpool star Wirtz, playing in his home city, then took centre stage by converting a free-kick in style to seal Germany's first win in Group A.""We knew it was a catastrophe (in the) last game and we wanted to do things better,"" Wirtz told Germany's RTL network.""It was a good performance (which) we can definitely build on.""They and Northern Ireland both have three points, while Slovakia lead the way on six points after Tomas Rigo's late goal clinched a 1-0 victory in Luxembourg.Memphis Depay became the Netherlands' all-time top goalscorer with a brace in their 3-2 win in Lithuania in Group G.Depay, who now plays in Brazil for Corinthians, scored his 51st and 52nd international goals to move clear of Robin van Persie, with whom he had been tied in first place on half a century of strikes for the Oranje.The 31-year-old turned in Cody Gakpo's cutback for the opener before Quinten Timber netted the second goal for the Netherlands in Kaunas.They appeared to be on easy street, but Torino midfielder Gvidas Gineitis pulled one back and Edvinas Girdvainis headed in the equaliser before the break for the team ranked 143rd in the world.Depay, though, rescued the Netherlands by heading in a Denzel Dumfries cross just after the hour mark.Ronald Koeman's side have 10 points after four matches and are ahead of Poland on goal difference with a game in hand.Poland won 3-1 at home to Finland in Chorzow with Matty Cash, captain Robert Lewandowski and Jakub Kaminski netting before Benjamin Kaellman pulled one back for Finland, who are three points behind the leading duo in third.Belgium recorded a second 6-0 win in as many matches in Group J as they swept aside Kazakhstan at Anderlecht's stadium in Brussels. Kevin De Bruyne scored twice and is now his country's second-top goal-scorer of all time behind Romelu Lukaku.Jeremy Doku of Manchester City also bagged a brace, with Nicolas Raskin and Thomas Meunier netting the other goals.North Macedonia beat Liechtenstein 5-0 in the same group and they are top with 11 points from five matches, one ahead of Belgium -- who have a game in hand -- and Wales.",Mikel Merino scores a hat-trick as a majestic Spain thumped Turkey 6-0 away in World Cup qualifying.

What’s common between the three Formula E world champions

How the three World Champions fared in Formula E Season 11

Days after Oliver Rowland lifted his Formula E World Championship trophy in London this season, an interesting trend has come to the attention of Formula E and its fans. As a coincidence, all Formula E drivers who won the Mexico City E-Prix went on to win the Formula E World Championship that season, and this has been proved right for three consecutive years.Highlighting the same since 2023, a poster of three World Champions was shared on X by Formula E with the caption, “The trend continues. Each winner of the #MexicoCityEPrix from the past three seasons has gone on to become World Champion.”The special poster features 2023 Formula E World Champion Jake Dennis from Andretti, then TAG Heuer Porsche’s Pascal Wehrlein, who won in 2024, and the new World Champion, Nissan driver Oliver Rowland. All three of them won in the Mexico E-Prix and went on to lift the winner’s trophy in the Formula E World Championship that year.Oliver Rowland had strengthened his chances of winning the Formula E World Championship this year much earlier. He was leading the Formula E Driver Standings ever since he won Part 2 of the Jeddah E-Prix, which was his second win of the season after winning the Mexico E-Prix. In the last leg, the Nissan driver got nervous for a while as Pascal Wehrlein, who was following him in the number two position, closed the gap after grabbing quite a few podiums while Rowland had a dull period.Things became serious for Rowland when he failed to finish the Round 13 race in Berlin, while Wehrlein won second spot on the podium. But he eventually managed to confirm his championship in Berlin after four wins and three more podiums.Sharing about his bad race in Berlin, Rowland had said, “I was hoping before the weekend that the outcome could be [the World Championship], but after yesterday (Saturday) and this morning (Sunday), I was more worried that it might never come.”Also Read: Oliver Rowland reacts to daughter’s sweet radio message after Formula E Championship win: “It’s amazing” Things, however, changed for Wehrlein, who was pushed to third position after Nick Cassidy made a late entry in the Formula E Driver Standings by registering three consecutive wins.

Wehrlein registered one win and five more podiums this season.Meanwhile, Andretti driver Jake Dennis finished in seventh position in the Formula E Driver Standings.

Taylor Barnard on losing top three spot in Formula E World Championship

Fans hail Taylor Barnard for his fantastic rookie season

It was Taylor Barnard’s rookie season this year, and the NEOM McLaren driver put up a fantastic performance by temporarily making it to the top three in the Formula E Driver Standings by ousting the much more experienced Porsche driver Antonio Felix Da Costa. He was, however, ousted from the top three at the London E-Prix as Jaguar’s Nick Cassidy went on to register three consecutive wins. Barnard took to Instagram to share his feelings on losing out on the top three in his first-ever season and his claim to the championship.Taking to Instagram after the London E-Prix, Barnard wrote, “London wasn’t what we hoped for, easily being the toughest weekend of our season. Taking 0 points away as a team from a doubleheader hurts, but one weekend doesn’t define the year we’ve had.”He further wrote, “As the season closes, I want to say a massive thank you to the entire team, both trackside and behind the scenes, for everything this season. Finishing P4 in the Drivers’ Championship and coming into the final weekend with a shot at runner-up is something to be proud of.”Also adding a note for teammate Sam Bird, as NEOM McLaren withdrew from Formula E after the end of the season, Barnard wrote, “@sambird_official it wasn’t the weekend you deserved either.You’ve been a huge part of my season both on and off the track, and I’m grateful for everything. You deserved more. To all the Papaya fans, thank you for the incredible support in our final race together. You always go above and beyond. ”Reacting to his post, a fan wrote, “An incredible debut season, huge congrats and excited to see where you go next!” Another said, “I know I said it the other day, but you’ve been incredible to watch this last year and a pleasure to support you in Papaya — there are many of us that can’t wait to support you in whatever you do next!” One more commented, “You were incredible all season around, Taylor.

McLaren team principal Ian James pens open letter to fans

What’s next in Formula E?

Team Principal Ian James of the departing Formula E team NEOM McLaren has penned an open letter to the fans of the team, marking their departure from the electric motorsport format. Addressing the Papaya Army, James thanked them for their trust and support as the team went on to win two Drivers’ World Championships and two Teams’ World Championships over 103 races in seven seasons.Ian James began the letter saying that he wrote it with “a huge amount of pride, as well as with more than a hint of sadness,” as the team closed the final chapter after seven years of competing in the ABB FIA Formula E World Championship.Thanking the fans for their love on social media and at the track, he said, “The team was always blown away by the amount of papaya we saw at circuits across the world, race-in, race-out, right from our very first round as the NEOM McLaren Formula E team.

How do Formula E and ABB work together?

What do ABB and Formula E say about the partnership?

After a successful Season 11, ABB and Formula E have announced that they will continue their partnership in the upcoming season. This gives ABB another opportunity to promote its new brand positioning via the ABB FIA Formula E World Championship, along with technologies that help industries take a cleaner route.Over a period of eight seasons, the partnership with Formula E has provided ABB a platform to showcase how technology can help industries outrun challenges, engage with customers around the world, and implement its own solutions into the series to improve reliability and efficiency. The partnership extension will provide a year-round opportunity for brand-building and activation, communicating ABB and its technology solutions to new global audiences, including Formula E’s international fanbase.ABB and Formula E will also join hands to engage a new generation of fans, collaborating with unexpected influencers and content creators to tell compelling stories that make advanced electrification and automation technologies tangible and exciting.The end of the mid-race car swap, a 150kW increase in power, top speeds that are 43 percent higher, and energy recovery increasing from 15 to 50 percent indicate how far Formula E technology has come to outperform on track.ABB has also built on its technical involvement in the series, supplying the race chargers from Season 9, and introducing its ABB Ability OPTIMAX® energy management software (Season 9) and Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) technology (Season 5) to the sport.ABB Head of Brand Paco Liebrand said, “We are pleased to be continuing our partnership with Formula E which, like ABB, is striving for a leaner and cleaner future. The synergy between the two organizations, combined with the global appeal of the Championship, makes it a great platform to promote our brand positioning.”He further said, “Formula E is increasingly working with content creators, influencers, and celebrities, with initiatives such as the Evo Sessions making an impact through digital channels beyond the racing itself, which is also an essential part of ABB’s new brand strategy. Going forward, we will be enhancing the way we harness the benefits of this collaboration, ensuring the focus is on delivering content and activations that reinforce our new messaging, build familiarity, and tell the ‘Engineered to Outrun’ story. ”Formula E Chief Revenue Officer Tiziana Di Gioia said, “Our renewed partnership with ABB is a testament to the commercial power and benefit of Formula E as a global platform that drives both brand and business growth. ABB, like our wider partnership portfolio, has and continues to see enormous value in collaborating with the fastest-growing motorsport on the planet, with viewership, commercial integration, and brand storytelling continuing to accelerate. Over eight seasons, ABB has moved from brand visibility to brand activation—integrating deeply into the fan experience, the sport’s ecosystem, and our innovation narrative.Also Read: Antonio Felix Da Costa shares happy memories as Porsche wins Formula E Teams and Manufacturers’ World Championships “This next chapter elevates the partnership even further. With ABB’s new positioning, we are co-creating opportunities across content, digital storytelling, and market engagement, transforming a title partnership into a year-round, value-generating relationship. It’s a model of how modern sponsorships should evolve, rooted in purpose and cultural alignment but measured by impact,” she added.Formula E Season 12 will begin with testing in Valencia in October.","ABB and Formula E have announced that they will continue their partnership in the upcoming season.

Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel.

Serena Williams, the 23-time Grand Slam champion, is stepping into an unexpected new role off the court — joining the producing team behind the Broadway musical smash hit ‘Hell’s Kitchen’ for its upcoming national tour across America.The musical, inspired in part by the teenage years of 17-time Grammy-winner Alicia Keys , features a jukebox-style soundtrack of Keys’ most iconic songs set against the backdrop of the titular New York City neighborhood.“I was blown away when I saw Hell’s Kitchen on Broadway last summer,” Williams said in a statement. “I am proud to join the producing team of my first ever Broadway show and support Alicia and the amazing company of Hell’s Kitchen as they get ready to light up the country on tour. Go see Hell’s Kitchen when it comes to a city near you!”Keys expressed her excitement at having the tennis legend on board. “Our show is all about dreaming big, and there is no one who embodies that spirit quite like Serena Williams,” she said. “I am so excited to have Serena join the Hell’s Kitchen family as a co-producer as we begin our North American tour… it just keeps getting better!

Cricket Australia has announced its preliminary 15-man squad for the ICC Champions Trophy , set to begin on February 19 . The squad includes fresh faces in Matt Short and Aaron Hardie, both earning their maiden call-ups for a global ICC event. The selection emphasises all-round capabilities, as the team aims to balance depth and versatility for the tournament hosted across Pakistan and the UAE.Nathan Ellis, whose stellar performances led the Hobart Hurricanes to the BBL 14 finals, also finds a spot in the squad. The trio of Short, Hardie, and Ellis replace David Warner, Cameron Green, and Sean Abbott from the team that triumphed in the ODI World Cup 14 months ago. Warner's retirement, Green's back surgery, and Abbott's omission have paved the way for these new entrants.Captain Pat Cummins will lead the side but remains uncertain for the tournament due to an ankle injury sustained during Australia's 3-1 Border-Gavaskar Trophy victory. Cummins is also skipping the Test series in Sri Lanka to be home for the birth of his second child. In his absence, vice-captain Steve Smith is likely to take charge.Australia's group-stage matches will be held in Pakistan, facing Afghanistan, England, and South Africa in Lahore and Rawalpindi. The squad's sole warm-up fixture is an ODI against Sri Lanka in Hambantota on February 16, three days after the second Test in Galle.Selector George Bailey highlighted the team's strategic depth, noting the squad comprises key players from recent successful tours, including the World Cup, West Indies series, and the Pakistan home series. ""This is a balanced and experienced squad offering flexibility based on opposition and conditions,"" Bailey said.Seam bowling has historically been more effective in Pakistan's ODIs, and the team structure reflects this. Adam Zampa is the lone specialist spinner, backed by three pacers and a cadre of all-rounders, including Marsh, Glenn Maxwell , Marcus Stoinis, Short and Hardie.Short has impressed since Warner's retirement, scoring consistently in ODIs and making a notable return in the BBL with a match-winning century for the Adelaide Strikers. Meanwhile, Hardie, who delivered key contributions during the UK tour, has been managing a quad injury but remains a vital inclusion for his dual skills.Selectors opted to omit Jake Fraser-McGurk after a string of low scores in the BBL and recent ODIs. Fraser-McGurk's form has been under scrutiny, with only a single half-century in domestic cricket this season.Australia's campaign will seek to claim the Champions Trophy for the first time since 2009. The format, last played in 2017, features the top two teams from each group progressing to the semi-finals. The final is scheduled for March 9 in either Lahore or Dubai.","Cricket Australia has announced its preliminary 15-man squad for the ICC Champions Trophy, set to begin on February 19.

Sharjah Warriorz 175/7 in 20 overs (Tom Kohler-Cadmore 83 not out, Rohan Mustafa 45, Mark Adair 2 for 23, Blessing Muzarabani 2 for 27)

A dramatic evening at the Dubai International Stadium ended with the Sharjah Warriorz securing a thrilling three-wicket victory over the Gulf Giants in a nail-biting finish on Sunday. The hero of the match was Tom Kohler-Cadmore , whose unbeaten 83 off 56 balls steered the Warriorz to their target of 175 on the very last delivery of the match.Kohler-Cadmore’s sublime knock, studded with six fours and four sixes, was complemented by a crucial contribution from UAE all-rounder Rohan Mustafa , who scored 45 off 33 balls. The duo forged a 105-run partnership that formed the backbone of the chase, propelling the Warriorz to a strong position despite some tense moments in the final overs.Chasing 175, the Warriorz had a shaky start, losing Johnson Charles in the opening over to Daniel Worall and Jason Roy in the second to Mark Adair. However, Kohler-Cadmore and Mustafa stabilised the innings with an aggressive yet calculated approach, guiding their team to 55/2 by the end of the powerplay.Kohler-Cadmore brought up his half-century off just 32 balls, showcasing his ability to find boundaries with ease. Mustafa provided steady support before falling to Blessing Muzarabani in the 13th over, leaving the Warriorz at 119/3.The middle order faltered under pressure, with Bhanuka Rajapaksa and Karim Janat departing cheaply. Keemo Paul offered a glimmer of hope with a brisk 11 off five balls, but his stay was cut short by Muzarabani. As wickets tumbled, the Warriorz needed 24 runs from the final two overs.Adil Rashid struck a vital six in the 19th over, which yielded 14 runs and brought the target within touching distance. With 10 runs required from the last over, Kohler-Cadmore held his nerve, smashing crucial boundaries to seal the victory.Earlier, Gulf Giants struggled to find momentum after being put into bat. Sharjah Warriorz captain Tim Southee led from the front, dismissing Adam Lyth and James Vince in the powerplay. Rehan Ahmed (46 off 27) and Jordan Cox (38 off 32) rebuilt the innings with a 57-run partnership, steering the Giants to 102/4 by the 14th over. Shimron Hetmyer provided a late surge, smashing 36 off 23 balls, including five fours and a six. Mark Adair’s quick-fire 20 not out off 10 deliveries and Saghir Khan’s cameo of 11 runs off four balls pushed the Giants to a competitive total of 174/7. Southee was the standout bowler for the Warriorz, finishing with 3/30.After the match, Kohler-Cadmore expressed relief and satisfaction, saying, “It is great to get off with a win. I would have been devastated had we not got over the line. The pitch played well once you got your eye in; it was easier to hit.”Gulf Giants skipper James Vince praised Kohler-Cadmore’s knock, admitting, “Having someone staying till the end was crucial. He is a quality player, a clean striker of the ball. It was a quality knock.”The result marked a memorable start for the Sharjah Warriorz, who showcased resilience and brilliance under pressure to claim victory in this electrifying contest.",Sharjah Warriorz secure thrilling three-wicket victory over Gulf Giants.

DUBAI: The participation of India's star pacer Jasprit Bumrah in the all-important ICC Champions Trophy 2025 remains uncertain as he continues to recover from a swelling on his back. A decision on his inclusion in the Indian squad is expected soon.Former Pakistan pacer Mohammad Amir believes that Bumrah's absence would put immense pressure on India during the mega tournament, scheduled to begin on February 19.India are placed in Group A alongside Bangladesh, Pakistan, and New Zealand. They will open their campaign on February 20 against Bangladesh in Dubai. Following this, India will face Pakistan and New Zealand on February 23 and March 2, respectively, in their remaining group-stage matches.""The way Pakistan has played recently — defeating Australia in Australia and then beating South Africa — shows their strength, especially in overseas conditions. Considering their recent performances, I think Pakistan will have the upper hand against India. However, India has always been my favorite in big tournaments. But the Indian team is under pressure and facing severe criticism due to their recent defeats,"" Amir told TimesofIndia.com during a group media interaction at the Dubai International Stadium.On Bumrah's potential absence, Amir emphasised his importance to India's bowling unit.""It will be a huge loss to India if Bumrah isn't there. He has been a top bowler for India, leading the pack from the front. Without him, the Indian bowling attack is reduced to 40-50 percent of its strength,"" he said.Bumrah, who has 443 international wickets in 204 games across formats, delivered a stellar performance in the recently concluded Border-Gavaskar Trophy, claiming 32 wickets in the five-match series — the highest by an Indian on foreign soil. His performances earned him the Player of the Series award.Bumrah bowled 151.2 overs or 908 deliveries in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, raising the question of whether this workload contributed to the injury of India's star fast bowler.India's ODI squad for the Champions Trophy is yet to be announced, and Bumrah's fitness remains a key concern.

Barcelona triumphed over their rivals, Real Madrid, with a resounding 5-2 victory in the Spanish Super Cup Clasico final held in Saudi Arabia on Sunday. This win marks the first trophy for Barcelona under manager Hansi Flick .Barcelona's impressive performance helped them secure a record-extending 15th Spanish Super Cup title. Kylian Mbappe gave Real Madrid an early lead. However, Barcelona responded with five goals before their goalkeeper, Wojciech Szczesny, received a red card in the second half.Real Madrid aimed to avenge their 4-0 home loss against Barcelona in La Liga back in October. Instead, they suffered a heavy defeat at the hands of their rivals in Jeddah.Following Mbappe's opening goal, Lamine Yamal equalised for Barcelona. Robert Lewandowski then put Barcelona ahead with a penalty kick. Raphinha scored twice, and Alejandro Balde also found the net.Rodrygo Goes managed to score a free-kick for Real Madrid, but they couldn't capitalise on their numerical advantage after Szczesny's sending-off. The defeat was a humbling experience for the European champions.""I think today is a good day because we beat one of the best teams in the world, for the second time this season, Real Madrid, and this is unbelievable. We won a title here and we are really happy... today is a day to look positively at this team,"" Flick said after the match.Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti attributed the heavy defeat to his team's defensive shortcomings.""We defended badly and that cost us the game -- they found their goals quite easily. We're sad, like all our fans, it's disappointing and we don't have to hide that... we have to look forwards, there's nothing else we can do,"" Ancelotti said.Despite Barcelona's strong start, Real Madrid took the lead in the fifth minute. Kylian Mbappe scored a brilliant counter-attack goal.The French forward, who had been frustrated by offside calls in the previous league defeat against Barcelona, broke free after Vinicius Jr . won possession. He then sprinted into the penalty area and chipped the ball past Szczesny.Lamine Yamal, the 17-year-old winger, scored a stunning individual goal to level the score. He cut in from the right and placed a low shot inside the near post, reminiscent of Lionel Messi.Barcelona continued to press forward and took the lead with a penalty kick converted by Robert Lewandowski. The penalty was awarded after Eduardo Camavinga's late and reckless challenge on Gavi.Raphinha extended Barcelona's lead with a header from Jules Kounde's cross. Barcelona then scored their fourth goal before halftime on a counter-attack. Yamal and Raphinha combined, and Raphinha set up Alejandro Balde, who calmly slotted the ball past Thibaut Courtois.Barcelona maintained their momentum in the second half. Raphinha scored their fifth goal with a skillful dribble and finish after being played in by Marc Casado.Barcelona was reduced to 10 men when Mbappe was brought down outside the penalty area by goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny. Mbappe had rounded Szczesny, and after a VAR review, the goalkeeper was sent off.Rodrygo, who had earlier hit the post, converted the resulting free-kick past Szczesny's replacement, Inaki Pena.Mbappe created a chance for Jude Bellingham, but the English midfielder's shot was blocked by a superb challenge from Jules Kounde in stoppage time.Mbappe also came close to scoring again with a fine individual effort, but his shot was saved by Inaki Pena.","Barcelona beat Real Madrid 5-2 in the Spanish Super Cup Clasico final held in Saudi Arabia.

Concerns over squad composition

NEW DELHI: India's 15-member squad for the upcoming five-match T20I series against England, starting January 22 in Kolkata, was announced on Saturday. Suryakumar Yadav will lead the side, with spin bowler Axar Patel serving as his deputy.However, the squad announcement has sparked discussions, particularly over the exclusion of wicketkeeper-batter Rishabh Pant and opener Yashasvi Jaiswal Former India cricketer Aakash Chopra , speaking on his YouTube channel, delved into these notable omissions and their implications for India's cricketing plans.Chopra raised eyebrows at the decision to pick Dhruv Jurel as the backup wicketkeeper while omitting Rishabh Pant. ""In the last T20I series [in South Africa], the team had Jitesh Sharma, who didn't get a game. Now Dhruv Jurel has been selected. Jurel has good temperament and potential, but in T20s, he is yet to make a name. He is picked purely on his potential, but he won't find a place in the playing XI,"" Chopra said.He expressed surprise at Pant's absence, calling him a ""generational talent"" and emphasising his value to the team. ""You picked Dhruv Jurel and not Rishabh Pant. That's very interesting. It's not like Pant is out of T20I schemes or considered unfit for white-ball cricket. So early in someone's career, should we make that call? I still believe Pant is an asset, the kind of player we should invest in,"" Chopra remarked.He suggested that clarity from the selectors is vital, especially for experienced players like Pant during transitional phases. ""Selectors should provide explanations to players. If not done, it weakens the foundation of the new setup during a transition period,"" he added.Chopra also addressed Yashasvi Jaiswal's exclusion, speculating that he might be in line for the upcoming Champions Trophy. ""Yashasvi's name is missing. I think they are considering him for the Champions Trophy and possibly the three-match ODI series against England. But he could've been in the T20I squad,"" Chopra said.He pointed out the competition between Jaiswal and Abhishek Sharma for a spot, questioning why the selectors didn't give Jaiswal a chance. ""Abhishek Sharma has already played 11-12 matches but hasn't scored enough runs or cemented his place. Yashasvi could have been given an opportunity in the playing XI. My question is, has Yashasvi's time not yet arrived in white-ball cricket?""Chopra also critiqued the lack of a third opener in the squad, highlighting potential risks in a five-match series. ""Why don't they pick a third opener? They didn't select one for the South Africa series either. If one opener falls ill, who will open? Tilak Varma or Washington Sundar?

The following year, their performance dipped further, as they ended at the bottom of the table with just four wins in 10 matches.With Southee set to make his ILT20 debut and taking on the responsibility of captaincy, the seasoned New Zealander is optimistic about leading the team to its first title victory.caught up with Southee, a veteran of 107 Tests, 161 ODIs, and 126 T20Is, to discuss the third edition of the ILT20, the team’s composition, and much more.It's an exciting tournament.

Those are two players who I think can really make a difference.I think the responsibility is the same. As captain, you have a job to do - whether you're a batter or a bowler. From my experience, bowlers often appreciate having a captain who understands what it’s like to be in their shoes. It gives you a unique perspective as a leader. I’m looking forward to the challenge. I’ve done this role a bit before, and I’m excited to lead the team over the next month here.","Tim Southee is set to make his ILT20 debut as captain of Sharjah Warriorz. The New Zealander has played 107 Tests, 161 ODIs, and 126 T20Is. Sharjah have struggled in the first two seasons of the tournament.

When India head coach Gautam Gambhir lost his cool in Australia

Gautam Gambhir press conference: On Kohli, Rohit and dressing room

NEW DELHI: Gautam Gambhir 's tenure as India's head coach has been a topic of intense discussion, with mixed performances across formats drawing attention to his leadership. While his influence in T20 cricket has been widely praised, the results in Tests and ODIs have raised questions about the challenges he faced early in his stint.India began well under Gambhir in Test cricket with a 2-0 series win over Bangladesh, but things quickly turned difficult with a 0-3 defeat to New Zealand and a 1-3 loss to Australia in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy. Reflecting on this, Dinesh Karthik , speaking on Cricbuzz, commented, ""The Bangladesh series was a success, and I think post that, things have gone downhill for him in Tests.""Karthik acknowledged the difficulties Gambhir faces, stepping into the role after Rahul Dravid 's successful stint. ""You've got to give Gambhir some slack. He has come in at a very tough time post the successful regime of Rahul Dravid. It's never easy to fill those shoes,"" Karthik said.Gambhir's remarks about the future of senior players Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli following the Australia series also sparked interest. On this, Karthik shared, ""He [Gambhir] wants them [Rohit and Kohli] to take a decision as to what they feel is best.""In the ODI format, India has played only a handful of matches under Gambhir, including a series loss to Sri Lanka. ""When it comes to ODIs, they haven't played too much, but also remember they lost the series against Sri Lanka. So, it hasn't been easy in Tests and a very small sample size for ODIs,"" Karthik noted.The coach's success in T20 cricket, however, has been a bright spot. ""He has found immense success in T20 cricket. He has a lot of young boys, and he has been able to have a massive influence over them,"" Karthik remarked, contrasting this with the struggles in Tests.When assessing Gambhir's impact, Karthik pointed to the importance of harmony between the coach's vision and the players' mindset. ""The biggest decision for him to make is: Is he very happy with this current set of players? Is he able to influence them over decision-making? Are they aligned with his thought process? If these players are fitting in, then great. If not, then we have to figure out what is the best way moving forward. Test cricket has been hard for Gautam Gambhir as the coach.""Karthik concluded by acknowledging the challenges Gambhir faces and the limited influence a coach can have during matches. ""The pressure is mounting. All he can do is give them freedom, give them the security they want in the dressing room, and try to keep a very nice and safe even sort of place there. But when the player walks out, he has to find a way to counter his demons and the opposition's questions,"" he concluded.",Gautam Gambhir's tenure as India's head coach has been a topic of intense discussion. His mixed performances across formats have raised questions about his leadership. Dinesh Karthik said that Gambhier's success in T20 cricket had been a bright spot.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117164744,imgsize-24594,width-400,resizemode-4/117164744.jpg"

Haryana squeeze through

Brief scores:

NEW DELHI: Vidarbha secured a dominant nine-wicket victory over Rajasthan, while Haryana narrowly defeated Gujarat by two wickets in the Vijay Hazare Trophy semi-finals in Vadodara on Sunday.The thrilling matches have set the stage for exciting semi-final clashes. Haryana will face Karnataka on Wednesday, and Vidarbha will take on Maharashtra on Thursday.Karun Nair 's exceptional form continued with his fifth century of the tournament. He scored an unbeaten 122 off just 82 balls, smashing 13 fours and 5 sixes. This was his fourth century in the last five innings.Dhruv Shorey provided excellent support, also scoring an unbeaten century (118 off 131 balls). Their unbroken 200-run partnership for the second wicket propelled Vidarbha to victory, chasing down a target of 292 in just 43.3 overs.Nair's remarkable run has amassed him 664 runs in eight matches.The achievement places him alongside Devdutt Padikkal, Kumar Sangakkara, and Alviro Petersen, each having achieved four consecutive List A hundreds.Narayan Jagadeesan currently holds the record for most consecutive List A hundreds, scoring five in a row during the 2021-22 Vijay Hazare Trophy.Nair entered the crease at one down, joining Shorey and Yash Rathod, who had already established a strong 92-run opening partnership. He flawlessly continued the momentum, guiding Vidarbha to victory.Earlier, Rajasthan's batsmen struggled to convert their starts into substantial scores.Kartik Sharma (62) and Shubham Garhwal (59) were the top scorers for Rajasthan. Deepak Chahar (31), Deepak Hooda (45), and skipper Mahipal Lomror (32) also made contributions, but none managed to anchor the innings.Yash Thakur's impressive bowling figures of 4/39 helped restrict Rajasthan to a sub-300 total. His economical spell played a crucial role in Vidarbha's victory.Haryana clinched a victory against Gujarat, chasing down a target of 197. Their win wasn't easy, thanks to a compelling performance by Indian leg-spinner Ravi Bishnoi, who took 4 wickets for 46 runs.Gujarat's Hemang Patel scored a respectable 54 runs off 62 balls. However, the efforts of Haryana's Anuj Thakral and Nishant Sindhu, each claiming three wickets, hampered Gujarat's innings.Himanshu Rana played a crucial role in Haryana's chase, scoring 66 runs off 89 balls. Other batsmen contributed smaller scores, enabling Haryana to reach the target.Gujarat's captain, Axar Patel, who is part of India's T20I squad against England, had a disappointing match.He only managed three runs and failed to take any wickets in his 10 overs, conceding 41 runs. Despite setting what seemed like a manageable target, Gujarat ultimately couldn't defend their total against a determined Haryana side.Bishnoi's impressive spell nearly tipped the scales in their favor, but Haryana's batting depth proved sufficient.Gujarat: 196 all out in 45.2 overs (Hemang Patel 54, Chintan Gaja 32; Anuj Thakral 3/39, Nishant Sindhu 3/40) lost to Haryana: 201/8 in 44 overs (Himanshu Rana 66, Parth Vats 38; Ravi Bishnoi 4/46) by 2 wickets.Rajasthan: 291/8 in 50 overs (Kartik Sharma 62, Shubham Garhwal 59, Deepak Hooda 45, Deepak Chahar 31; Yash Thakur 4/39) lost to Vidarbha: 292/1 in 43.3 overs (Karun Nair 122 not out, Dhruv Shorey 118 not out) by 9 wickets.","Vidarbha beat Rajasthan by nine wickets to reach Vijay Hazare Trophy semi- finals.

MUMBAI: Even as the International Cricket Council's deadline for all the eight teams to pick their provisional squads for the Champions Trophy in UAE & Pakistan expires at midnight on Jan 12 (Sunday), the BCCI is likely to seek an extension and announce India's provisional squad only on January 19, a month before the tournament, which begins on Feb 19. However, at the time of writing this, the BCCI had not requested an extension of the deadline in this regard from the ICC .""The Champions Trophy squad is likely to be announced on Jan 19,"" BCCI vice-president Rajiv Shukla told reporters on Sunday at the BCCI's headquarters, just after the Board's Special General Meeting, where Devajit Saikia and Prabhtej Singh Bhatia were announced as the new BCCI secretary and treasurer.On Saturday, the national selection committee, led by Ajit Agarkar , only picked the Indian side for the five-match T20I series against England, postponing the three-match ODI series against England—the ODIs are supposed to be played on Feb 6, 9, & 12—and the provisional squad for the ICC Champions Trophy later.TOI understands that as per the ICC rule, all the teams are supposed to submit their provisional squads by 23.59 pm on Jan 12, but the BCCI is likely to ask for an extension in that regard.Normally, all the teams are supposed to submit their provisional squads a month in advance, but this time the ICC has stretched that period to five weeks. Of course, the teams are allowed to change their squads later.","International Cricket Council's deadline for all the eight teams to pick their provisional squads for the Champions Trophy in UAE & Pakistan expires at midnight on Jan 12.

NEW DELHI: Bangladesh fast bowler Tanzim Hasan Sakib found himself at the center of controversy during a Bangladesh Premier League match while representing Sylhet Strikers against Khulna Tigers .The incident occurred on the first ball of the 17th over when Tanzim dismissed Pakistan all-rounder Mohammad Nawaz . It was a clever slower delivery, and Nawaz was completely deceived, offering an easy catch to short third man.After the catch was taken, Tanzim exchanged words with Nawaz, and as they approached each other, the Pakistan star appeared to initiate a shoulder bump with Tanzim.The two players began arguing, leading to a heated altercation, with Tanzim pointing towards the dressing room. Nawaz appeared visibly frustrated, but other players stepped in to separate them and prevent further escalation.Earlier in the season, Tanzim had also been involved in a minor scuffle with Towhid Hridoy and had been part of some banter at the international level as well.Recently, star India batter Virat Kohli shoulder-bumped Australian debutant Sam Konstas during the opening day of the fourth Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy in Melbourne.The collision quickly escalated into a heated exchange between the two players. Australian opener Usman Khawaja and umpire Michael Gough intervened, stepping in to mediate and diffuse the situation.","Tanzim Hasan Sakib was involved in a scuffle during a Bangladesh Premier League match.

In an alarming coincidence, each of their three home losses in this ISL campaign have come by that very scoreline.In a game that took until the second half to come to life, it was Mohammed Sanan who set the visitors on their way in the 64th minute with a clinical finish.Just as Mumbai City so nearly drew level when Nikolaos Karelis's left-footed effort stung Albino Gomes's palms in the closing minutes, Jordan Murray (86th) sealed the three points for Khalid Jamil's side following a quick break after Jamshedpur had won back possession.There was time for one final dagger which arrived in stoppage time as Javi Hernandez (90+6) fired home from inside the box.The win saw Jamshedpur climb to third place, level on points with Bengaluru (27pts) with a game in hand. Mumbai, meanwhile, still occupy sixth spot and that final playoff berth, but were left to rue another bitter outing at home. Although they went into this game with a confidence-boosting 3-2 win at East Bengal last week, there is no doubt that the Islanders are finding goals hard to come by this season.Coach Petr Kratky has even resorted to switching captain Lallianzuala Chhangte from his favoured position on the right of their usual three-man attack to playing in the hole behind the front three.It would yield no dividends on this occasion, as Jamshedpur's backline were disciplined enough to deal with anything Karelis, Vikram Partap Singh or Bipin Singh were able to ask of them.To make matters worse, Chhangte was sent off after the game for dissent.","Jamshedpur beat Mumbai City 0-3 at the Mumbai Football Arena.

Altay Bayindir was the unexpected hero for Manchester United as they edged past Arsenal in a dramatic FA Cup encounter at the Emirates. The match ended 1-1 after 90 minutes, and United triumphed 5-4 on penalties, with Bayindir making crucial saves both in normal time and during the shootout to send the holders into the fourth round.United took the lead early in the second half when Bruno Fernandes unleashed a thunderous strike into the top corner, capitalising on a slip by Gabriel after Alejandro Garnacho's incisive run. However, the game turned when Diogo Dalot received a second yellow card on the hour mark for a reckless challenge, leaving United to defend with 10 men for over half an hour.Arsenal wasted no time exploiting their numerical advantage as Gabriel Magalhães scored the equaliser, with Bayindir failing to deal with Gabriel Martinelli’s cross, resulting in a deflected shot finding the net.Despite dominating possession and creating multiple chances, Arsenal failed to capitalise. Their woes were compounded when Bayindir saved Martin Odegaard’s penalty following a controversial decision against Harry Maguire, who was furious at the call and clashed with Kai Havertz during the ensuing melee.Bayindir redeemed himself further with a stunning stop to deny Declan Rice and another to keep Havertz at bay as Arsenal squandered golden opportunities to secure the win in regulation.In the penalty shootout, United were flawless. Fernandes, Amad Diallo, Leny Yoro, Lisandro Martinez, and Josua Zirkzee all converted their spot-kicks, with Zirkzee calmly scoring the decisive penalty. Bayindir’s save against Havertz in the shootout proved pivotal, capping a remarkable performance for the Turkish goalkeeper.The defeat deepens Arsenal’s recent struggles, coming on the back of a League Cup semi-final first-leg loss to Newcastle. Manager Mikel Arteta expressed his frustration, stating, ""We deserved to win based on performance, but the reality is we’re out.""Arsenal’s misery was compounded by the sight of Gabriel Jesus being stretchered off in the first half with a suspected knee injury, adding to their growing list of absentees.For United, the win was a testament to their resilience under manager Ruben Amorim, who praised his side’s character in a hard-fought victory.

Carlo Ancelotti calls on Real Madrid to avoid repeating Clasico mistakes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/carlo-ancelotti-calls-on-real-madrid-to-avoid-repeating-clasico-mistakes/articleshow/117146797.cms,"Carlo Ancelotti (AP Photo)

Real Madrid's coach, Carlo Ancelotti, believes his team can avenge their previous defeat against Barcelona in the Spanish Super Cup final on Sunday. He emphasized the importance of learning from past mistakes to secure a victory.Barcelona had convincingly defeated Real Madrid 4-0 at the Santiago Bernabeu in La Liga earlier in the season. However, Real Madrid managed to surpass them in the league standings before the winter break.“We have to think about that game obviously, they beat us, we had a clear evaluation of what happened.”Ancelotti acknowledged the significance of the previous encounter and the need to analyze their performance. He stressed the importance of replicating the positive aspects of their play while avoiding past errors.“We started the game well, then had problems in the second half, so we have to try and repeat the good things we did and avoid the mistakes we made.”The added pressure of a final against their rivals adds another layer of complexity to the upcoming match. Ancelotti acknowledged the unique nature of Clasico finals.“The Clasico is even more pressured when it's a final, we've played a lot against Barcelona and playing a final against them is always something special.”Real Madrid's challenge lies in finding a balance between their attacking prowess and defensive solidity, especially after Kylian Mbappe 's arrival. The attacking quartet of Mbappe, Vinicius Junior, Jude Bellingham, and Rodrygo Goes offers significant offensive firepower. However, their defensive contributions are crucial for team balance.“(In recent Clasicos) individual quality has prevailed over team balance.”Ancelotti highlighted the importance of collective effort and defensive stability in such high-stakes matches.“An important aspect tomorrow will be balance and collective work -- defending.”He firmly believes that a strong defensive performance increases their chances of winning.“If you defend well, there's more chance of winning.”Despite a successful 2024 season with La Liga and Champions League titles, Ancelotti admitted that the heavy defeat against Barcelona remained a low point.“We're close to another trophy, we're thinking positively, but we know that in football anything can happen, above all when the opponent is strong and competes well like Barcelona.”Ancelotti acknowledged the unpredictable nature of football, particularly against a strong opponent like Barcelona. He also highlighted Real Madrid's progress and improvement as a team.“Our team has improved, nobody can argue with that.”He expressed confidence in their continued progress regardless of the outcome of the Super Cup final.“A defeat wouldn't be good but the team is not going backwards, it will keep moving forwards.”Dani Olmo's availability for Barcelona after a controversial temporary license approval by the Spanish national sports council (CSD) presents a challenge for Real Madrid.“Olmo will play and we have to minimise his quality.”Ancelotti chose to focus on minimizing Olmo's impact on the game rather than commenting on the controversy surrounding his eligibility.Barcelona coach Hansi Flick confirmed Olmo's readiness to play but hinted at a possible starting role for Gavi.“Gavi had a great performance against Athletic, he's got confidence... I think he's is going to play, but I am not 100 percent sure of who will play.”The Super Cup final represents Flick's first opportunity to win a trophy with Barcelona. He acknowledged the importance of a victory for the team's confidence.“If we win, we will have more confidence for the rest of the season.”He further emphasized the significance of winning the game for everyone involved.“Winning the game would be something really big for everyone.”",Real Madrid face Barcelona in the Spanish Super Cup final on Sunday.

Amadou Onana drew Villa level before Morgan Rogers struck the decisive goal, leaving Potter visibly dejected.The defeat marked Potter's return to management following his departure from Chelsea in April 2023. His tenure at Stamford Bridge had been brief and challenging, with 11 defeats in 31 matches and a disappointing 11th-place position in the Premier League.With merely one training session before travelling to Villa and the absence of crucial strikers Jarrod Bowen and Michail Antonio, Potter faced significant challenges.Despite these limitations, the attacking display from West Ham showed promise, though addressing their defensive vulnerabilities remains the primary concern.Lopetegui struggled to maintain the robust framework established by David Moyes, who secured the Europa Conference League in 2023 before departing at the season's conclusion.Potter demonstrated his ability to address these tactical concerns as West Ham displayed impressive attacking prowess against Villa in the first half.Paqueta nearly provided Potter with an ideal beginning when the Brazilian's attempt from the area's periphery narrowly missed the target.It was a warning Villa failed to heed as Paqueta opened the scoring in the ninth minute.Summerville displayed his skill by outmanoeuvring Villa's Maatsen during a decisive run into the box, before delivering a precise pass to Paqueta, who finished expertly past Olsen.The new manager's jubilant celebration was short-lived, as German forward Fullkrug had to leave the pitch with an injury shortly after the goal.Continuing his impressive performance, Paqueta tested Olsen again following another penetrating attack.Villa's persistence after the interval paid off in the 71st minute. A corner kick saw Mings direct the ball towards Maatsen, whose shot was parried by Fabianski into Onana's path, allowing him to score from close range.Villa, sensing an opportunity, pressed forward in the 76th minute. Watkins advanced into West Ham's penalty area and set up Rogers, who finished precisely into the bottom corner.",West Ham squandered a 1-0 lead to concede twice and lose 1-2 in the third round of the tournament.

He was playing very good first and second sets, he was on a roll. He deserved to win, but somehow, I fought back.”Nishikori, who underwent right elbow surgeries a decade apart in 2009 and again in 2019, also had a hip surgery in January 2022.There were other injuries – knee and shoulder -- that challenged his return to competition.Nishikori knows how to persevere as he showed on Sunday.“My focus level is always high, especially in the last set,” Nishikori said. “It is kind of big for me to stay tough until the end.”“The other side is people winning in two sets, but I’m not. I'm always going five sets,” he said. “That's something I have to work on. It's not a good habit to have!”Nishikori smiled, wearing the victor’s expression with grace.",Kei Nishikori beats Thiago Monteiro in five sets at the Australian Open.

Alexander Zverev , currently ranked second in the world, advanced to the second round of the Australian Open on Sunday. He achieved a straight-sets victory against Lucas Pouille . This win marks the beginning of Zverev's campaign to surpass his semi-final appearance in last year's tournament.Zverev defeated the French wildcard, Pouille, with a score of 6-4, 6-4, 6-4 on Rod Laver Arena . Pouille himself reached the semi-finals of the Australian Open in 2019, losing to the eventual champion, Novak Djokovic. This victory secured Zverev's place in the second round at Melbourne Park for the ninth consecutive year. He will now face Spain's Pedro Martinez, ranked 44th, in the next round.Zverev maintained control throughout the match against the 103rd-ranked Pouille. He broke Pouille's serve for a 3-2 lead in the first set and maintained this advantage. He sealed the first set with a cross-court forehand.In the second set, Zverev again broke Pouille's serve in the opening game, increasing the pressure on the Frenchman. Errors began to appear in Pouille's game.This break proved sufficient for Zverev to secure the second set. He then achieved a decisive break at 3-3 in the third set. He closed out the match with his 18th ace, accumulating a total of 40 winners.""He is definitely better than his ranking,"" said Zverev, who also made the semis in 2020.""He is a great player. I wish him health. He is definitely going to be back up the rankings very soon.""Zverev entered the new season with a boost of confidence. He secured titles at the Rome and Paris Masters 1000 tournaments in recent months. These victories propelled him to his highest career ranking.However, a Grand Slam title has eluded Zverev for nearly a decade. His closest attempts have been runner-up finishes at the 2020 US Open and the 2021 French Open.This is Zverev's 36th Grand Slam appearance. If he wins the Australian Open, he will equal Stan Wawrinka for the second-longest wait for a first Grand Slam title in the Open era.Goran Ivanisevic currently holds the record. He won Wimbledon in 2001 on his 48th Grand Slam attempt.","Alexander Zverev defeated French wildcard Lucas Pouille 6-4, 6-3, 6 -4.

'He has always been my favorite player': Nishesh Basavareddy on playing Novak Djokovic at Australian Open 2025,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/he-has-always-been-my-favorite-player-nishesh-basavareddy-on-playing-novak-djokovic-at-australian-open-2025/articleshow/117170276.cms,"Djokovic on playing Basavareddy

The tennis world is in a twist trying to pronounce Nishesh Basavareddy , too many vowels for the vocal tract maybe. The 19-year-old Indian-American, who plays his idol Novak Djokovic in the first round of the Australian Open on Monday, has grabbed eyeballs, as much for his opponent, as for his own recent run.Basavareddy, who started the 2024 season ranked No. 457, when studying Data Science in Stanford University, is now at a career-high No.107 in the Live Rankings, courtesy his maiden charge into a Tour-level semifinal, last week in Auckland.The Carmel, Indiana-based teen learnt he had drawn the 24-time major winner Djokovic when in Auckland.""I wasn't planning on knowing the AO draw until after the tournament,"" Basavareddy said, pointing to the fact that he was still in the draw in Auckland. ""My brother told me, you are going to see it all over social media anyway, and so he told me. I was really happy, really excited! It's a great draw to play someone like that, on one of the biggest courts in the world, that was my first reaction.""Basavareddy's analytical brain is fully switched on when watching tennis, most likely on every gadget he owns. The 5 ft 11' pro remembers watching the 2017 Australian Open final where Roger Federer beat Rafael Nadal , as well as a good number of Djokovic's wins in Melbourne Park.""I started watching tennis and watching (Djokovic) about the same time, when I was like 6 or 7 years old,"" Basavareddy said. ""He has always been my favorite player. Last week in Brisbane, I was a match away from playing him and I was a little disappointed I didn't get him there.""The thing Basavareddy most admires about the Serb is how Djokovic maximized his career. ""He has taken a holistic approach to his game, with diet and all that sort of stuff,"" he says. ""That's been really cool to learn from and for younger players, get inspiration from, to be the best they can be.""Basavareddy, of a light build and quick feet, has tangoed briefly with the gluten-free diet. ""I think he's superhuman, some of that stuff like he didn't eat chocolate for two years or something, I don't think that's something a lot of people can do, but definitely an inspiration,"" he said.Basavareddy, who clinched the USTA wildcard into the Australian Open, picks his return game as his biggest strength. That probably comes from a combination of watching his idol as much as his own ability to read play as if it were a graphic novel, so much so that it became a joke on the junior tour, comparing his play with that of Djokovic. ""I think there are some similarities, but he's obviously the greatest player,"" he says, ""so there's a long way to go.""The 19-year-old watched Djokovic's first round match last year, when Croat teenager Dino Prizmic took a set off him.""I remember watching that match at school last year,"" he said, ""Dino played really well, he's my age, I grew up with him in the juniors. Matches like that definitely give me hope that it (first round) is a good time to catch a top player (in a Grand Slam).""When he steps onto the Rod Laver Arena for the first night match on Monday, the 19-year-old would like his own dance moves to speak.""I don't know much about him. I watched him play (Thursday, Auckland) for the first time. He's very quick, very talented. He's got great hands. He can serve well, hit spots. Just a very complete game overall. It'll be his first time in the main draw of a Grand Slam, wild card, playing on Rod Laver Arena, not much to lose. He is going to be really pumped to make a statement.""","Nishesh Basavareddy plays Novak Djokovic in the first round of the Australian Open on Monday.

NEW DELHI: Zheng Qinwen stated on Sunday that she will always shake hands with her opponent out of respect, but don't expect it to be ""smiley"" and that she won't give them an embrace.Some athletes have criticized the Chinese star for being cold on the court; Emma Navarro, an American, claimed last year that the 22-year-old ""disrespected"" her and called her ""cut-throat.""Concerns were also raised by Zheng's cold handshake and lack of eye contact with Aryna Sabalenka during the US Open.When she shook hands with Romanian Anca Todoni after defeating her 7-6 (7/3), 6-1 at the Australian Open , there was no indication that she would act in a similar manner.""I always give a handshake to my opponent because I feel that's the basic respect. Doesn't matter if I win or I lost, I always give a handshake,"" said Zheng, a finalist at the Australian Open last year.""But not always I give a handshake with a smiley face. This I know myself.""Usually I don't often give a hug to my opponent as well, because I feel that is not necessary for me.""I come just here to play a match. If I lost, I will give you just a basic respect and that's it,"" she added.""That's why you will not see me lose one match with a happy face to the opponent.

It's like where I want to become better,"" she said.""But also I can find peace outside of the tennis court.""I love reading, I love singing.

NEW DELHI: Tennis veteran Kei Nishikori , now 35, displayed remarkable resilience and determination in his first-round match at the Australian Open on Sunday.Despite facing two match points against Thiago Monteiro of Brazil, Nishikori refused to give up and staged an impressive comeback, ultimately prevailing in a gruelling five-set encounter.The match, which lasted over four hours, saw Nishikori overcome a two-set deficit to secure a 4-6, 6-7 (4/7), 7-5, 6-2, 6-3 victory.Nishikori acknowledged the mental challenge he faced when he was on the brink of defeat, admitting that he nearly gave up. However, his unwavering spirit and determination propelled him to fight through the adversity and secure the hard-fought win.""I almost gave up at match point,"" said Nishikori, who is on the comeback trail after spending years sidelined by major hip surgery and an ankle injury.""He was playing very good and was on a roll.

But I think it's part of the process for me, and I did believe that this could happen,"" he said.""So I'm definitely happy it's happened, but I'm also hungry for what's coming up, because it's getting exciting playing against higher ranked opponents. Yeah, looking forward to what's coming up, trying to stay healthy and be fit to be able to compete at the highest level.""Rithvik said combining with Haase has been a learning experience for more than one reason.""Playing with Robin was obviously super exciting. It was completely new for me to play with a singles player, because I haven't really done that (until now),"" he said after their outing in Brisbane where the pair lost in the second round.""I mean, he's obviously playing doubles, but he was top-35 in the world in singles and been a top singles player for a very long time. So it was really interesting and really fun to play with him.""I definitely learned quite a lot from Robin. We had a lot of conversations off the court. It was interesting, because he's been on the tour for a very long time, and he shared a couple of experiences, which were super awesome to hear and learn from as well.""He's very open, very friendly, so it was fun time playing with him on court.""Rithvik will have one more first after the Australian Open when he plays in the Davis Cup tie against Togo in New Delhi.""It is a dream for everyone to play in the Davis Cup team.

NEW DELHI: Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray have known each for approximately 25 years. They were born a week apart. They played each other as juniors when they were all of 12 years old. Upon turning professional, they squared off 36 times, including 10-times in Grand Slams. The Serb won 25 times and now-retired Murray took the other 11. At the majors, that record stood at 8-2.Nowhere did the balance tip more in favour of 37-year-Djokovic than at the Australian Open . They met five times - four finals and a semi-final - and Djokovic held the upper hand each time.Starting Sunday, Murray will not be standing across the net from Djokovic, hoping to overhaul this record. Instead, he will be much-closer to the Serb - in a specially designed ""pod"" which are dedicated for the coaches.The pods, a new feature at the Australian Open which gets underway on 12 January, will allow four members of the player's staff to be able to give them advice. Murray will have access to real-time data and statistics on a screen to make suggestions as Djokovic chases an elusive 25th Grand Slam title.Djokovic had been without a coach since splitting with Goran Ivanisevic in March last year, having won 12 majors together.The call came out of the blue for Murray who was on a golf course when Djokovic proposed the idea. The Briton considered the wild proposition and discussed it with his family before agreeing.“Could never quite get over the line (in Melbourne), unfortunately. This man was single-handedly responsible for that. So I’m now here to try and sabotage his chances of winning another one,” Murray joked.“Novak asked me to help him; I was shocked,” said Murray, who last played at the Paris Olympics in August. “I was obviously not expecting that when he called.”Djokovic agreed that the feeling of having Murray, a former foe, feeding him balls during practice is getting some used to.“I must say, at the beginning, it was a bit of a strange feeling to be able to share the insights with him, not just about the game but about how I feel, about life in general. Not in a negative way, but just in a way I have never done that with him, because he was always one of my greatest rivals,” Djokovic said on Friday. “We were always kind of hiding things from each other. Now all cards are open on the table.”Daniil Medvedev summed up the pairing beautifully by buying a comparison from football. “Imagine (if Lionel) Messi would become the coach of Cristiano Ronaldo. It would be strange,” said the Russian.Is that a hyperbole? Not by a long shot. Djokkovic and Murray comprised two of the 'Big Four' era which also included Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer. Djokovic, the only one left standing, owns a men’s-record 24 majors, including 10 at the Australian Open, and has spent the most weeks as World No. 1 in history. Murray, also 37, too occupied the top-rank, owns three major singles trophies, was a Slam runner-up eight times and is the only player to win two Olympic singles gold medals.They are, however, seemingly different personalities. Djokovic has an unconventional belief system and is committed to yoga, meditation and a strict vegan diet. Murray, in comparison, self implodes on the court and would verbally berate himself time and again through his career.Former India No. 1 Somdev Devvarman believes there are a lot more similarities than differences.""Both of them are super fiery. They're fiery with their teams. They're ultra competitive. They are incredible fighters, great problem solvers. Came from a very similar era. They are of the same age, so they look at tennis in a similar way. They are dealing with the perils of the modern game and how big people are hitting the ball and the new style of how it's changed over the last four or five years. They're dealing with it together,"" said Devvarman during a media interaction.""I do feel like there's a lot of similarities. And obviously Novak believed that having somebody like Andy on his side would only be helpful. It would be fun. It would maybe be refreshing, maybe something that he needs at this time in his career. So, obviously, there's a lot of trust between the two of them. Ultimately, Novak is looking to find that little edge that can help him beat a lot of his opponents, and if he believes that Andy Murray can give him that edge, I'm looking forward to watching,"" he added.Djokovic's major trophy cabinet has remained untouched since the 2023 US Open. It was the first time since 2017 that he didn't win a Grand Slam in a season. Yet, the Serb added an Olympic gold - an elusive silverware for a man that had won everything possible.Somdev, who reached a career-high of World No. 62 in 2011 and won three medals at the Asian Games, thinks the partnership will only aid Novak in an attempt at winning his 25th Grand Slam, thereby breaking the tie with Margaret Court in the all-time list.""Novak has taken a leap of faith in his old friend, who he believes has fantastic tennis IQ. He's dedicated, he works hard, and he doesn't leave any stone unturned in order to succeed. To have that sort of energy in your camp, it can mean a lot,"" said Somdev.""It's humbling, honestly, to see it from Novak's perspective that he would ask a friend of such a high standard.

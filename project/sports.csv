Special dinner for Team India at Gautam Gambhir’s house in Delhi | T20 World Cup

Poll Do you think the India-Pakistan match will take place as scheduled on February 15? Yes, it's likely to happen. No, it will be canceled. Unsure, depends on negotiations.

MUMBAI: The chances of an India–Pakistan clash in Colombo on February 15 in the ongoing 2026 T20 World Cup brightened on Sunday, with International Cricket Council (ICC) deputy chairman Imran Khwaja flying to Lahore for a crucial meeting with senior officials of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB).At the time of filing this report, Khwaja was locked in discussions at the Gaddafi Stadium with PCB chairman Mohsin Naqvi. Bangladesh Cricket Board president Bangladesh Cricket Board chief Aminul Islam Bulbul and PCB chief operating officer Sumair Ahmed Syed were also present.“Important meetings are underway. Hopefully, there is now a big ray of hope that the India–Pakistan match will take place as scheduled,” sources tracking developments in Pakistan told TOI.Earlier, Khwaja — who has been acting as a mediator in the highly sensitive situation — was received at Lahore airport by Amir Mir, advisor to Naqvi. The ICC official is understood to have travelled with the sole objective of salvaging the marquee India–Pakistan fixture, which carries enormous commercial value for the ICC and its member boards.Both the PCB and the International Cricket Council are keen to resolve the standoff triggered by Pakistan’s proposed boycott of the high-profile contest.The meetings in Lahore are expected to be followed by a virtual ICC Board meeting late on Sunday night. Khwaja, who represents Singapore on the ICC Board as an associate member director, is regarded as one of the governing body’s most influential figures and carries voting rights. He has been formally tasked by the ICC Board to mediate and find a way out of the impasse.Bulbul is also expected to play a role in discussions aimed at persuading Pakistan to reconsider its decision to skip the Colombo fixture.Pakistan prime minister Shehbaz Sharif had earlier said that the national team would boycott the India match in solidarity with Bangladesh, who were replaced by Scotland after refusing to travel to India for their World Cup games, citing security concerns.However, the situation may now be fluid after Sri Lanka Cricket CEO Shammi Silva wrote to Naqvi, urging the PCB to call off the boycott, warning that a no-show would also result in heavy financial losses for Sri Lanka.The ICC has meanwhile sought clarity from the PCB on how the ‘Force Majeure’ clause could be invoked to justify Pakistan’s refusal to play the match after the board cited directives from its government.With the PCB now engaging in deliberations with the ICC, momentum appears to be building towards a possible resolution.The chain of events was triggered after Bangladesh pulled out of their World Cup matches in India following pacer Mustafizur Rahman being released from the Kolkata Knight Riders squad on the instructions of the BCCI.","ICC deputy chairman Imran Khwaja flies to Lahore for talks with Pakistan Cricket Board.

Brief scores:

KOLKATA: It was a grudge match for Scotland and they got their revenge in style, condemning Italy to a 73-run defeat in their maiden match in the T20 World Cup. After becoming the first team in the World Cup to breach the 200-run mark (207/4), Scotland stopped Italy at 134 in 16.4 overs.In the process, Scotland exonerated the ghost of the European Regional Final qualifier defeat to Italy in July last year. Italy had won that match by 12 runs. In spite of initially missing the cut, a stroke of luck pushed Scotland into the club of cricket’s elite. Despite losing to the West Indies in their opening match, they bounced back on Monday. Scotland’s star performer was opener George Munsey , whose 54-ball 84 was the backbone of their score. Having sharpened his skills in various franchise-based leagues around the world, Munsey’s clean hitting, coupled with some unorthodox shots, gave Scotland the start they needed.A five-ball 22 in the final over by Michael Leask propelled Scotland past the 200-run mark. The 35-year-old Leask came back right after the break with his offspin to grab an Italy wicket with the first ball of the innings. Italy, armed with a lot of self-belief and wishes from former football stars Christian Vieri and Andrea Pirlo, might have been overawed by the occasion, particularly the youngsters.Incidentally, Italy captain Wayne Madsen sustaining an injury while fielding. He has dislocated his shoulder and could well be out of the tournament.Scotland 207/4 (George Munsey 84, Brandon McMullen 41*; Grant Stewart 1/21) beat Italy 134 in 16.4 overs (Ben Manenti 62; Michael Leask 4/17) by 73 runs.",Scotland beat Italy by 73 runs in their T20 World Cup match.

T20 World Cup Groups Explained: Who Can Reach the Super 8

AHMEDABAD: There’s a reason why South Africa have packed their squad with hit-the-deck pacers. The true nature of the surface at the Narendra Modi Stadium, where they play three group matches and are scheduled to play a Super 8 encounter, demands bowlers who can bend the back, hit the good length constantly and deprive batters the freedom to flex their arms.Pacers Lungi Ngidi (4/31 off his four overs) and Kagiso Rabada did exactly that on Monday against Canada in their campaign opener. They reduced Canada to 45/4 in under six overs in a chase of 213 — the highest total of the tournament so far — following which Canada hardly mounted a chase but batted out overs to close at 156/8. The 57-run triumph helped South Africa enjoy a far easier opening outing against an Associate nation than some of their Full-Member counterparts.Earlier, David Miller ’s (39 off 23b; 1x4, 3x6) affinity with the Narendra Modi Stadium stood out as he, along with fellow middle-order batter Tristan Stubbs (34* off 19b; 2x4, 2x6), brought South Africa out of a wobble with a 37-ball 75-run alliance to propel them to 213/4.After Baroda-born left-arm wristspinner Ansh Patel (3/31) had pegged South Africa back with the wickets of captain Aiden Markram, Ryan Rickleton and aggressor Dewald Brevis, Miller and Stubbs bided their time before going after Jaskaran Singh and Kaleem Sana in the last three overs.Miller and Stubbs used the long handle to smash five maximums off the last 14 balls to score 47 runs in the last three overs.Invited to bat first, Markram (59 off 32b; 10x4, 1x6) and Quinton de Kock (25 off 22b; 2x4) started slowly before gathering pace with a flurry of boundaries off medium pacer Dilon Heyliger. The introduction of left-arm spinner Saad Bin Zafar got de Kock going as he crunched two boundaries through the off side.With Markram doing the heavy lifting in the Powerplay, South Africa sprinted their way to 66. The first over after the Powerplay, however, saw de Kock being undone by a loopy delivery from Canada captain Dilpreet Bajwa.",South Africa beat Canada by 57 runs in their T20 World Cup opener. Lungi Ngidi and Kagiso Rabada took four wickets each. David Miller (39) and Tristan Stubbs (34) hit five maximums in last 14 balls.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128140554,imgsize-133480,width-400,resizemode-4/canada-vs-south-africa-t20-world-cup.jpg"

NEW DELHI: The USA cricket team has been forced to make a change to its squad for the ICC T20 World Cup 2026 after fast bowler Jasdeep Singh was ruled out with a shoulder injury.The ICC confirmed that Ehsan Adil has been approved as his replacement by the tournament’s Event Technical Committee.In a statement confirming the change, ICC wrote, “The Event Technical Committee of the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2026 has approved Ehsan Adil as a replacement for Jasdeep Singh in the USA squad.”Adil, who has previously played three Tests and six ODIs for Pakistan, has not yet represented the USA in international matches but is eligible to join the squad following the committee’s clearance.The ICC also noted that “The replacement of a player requires the approval of the Event Technical Committee (ETC) before the player can be officially added to the squad.”Jasdeep Singh’s injury came during a warm-up match against New Zealand at the DY Patil Stadium in Navi Mumbai.While attempting a diving catch off Devon Conway’s shot, the 32-year-old landed awkwardly on his right shoulder and was in visible pain.He was quickly surrounded by players and support staff before being taken off the field and rushed to the hospital for scans.Jasdeep’s story has been an important part of USA cricket’s rise.Born in New York, he moved to Punjab as a child before returning to the United States and taking up cricket seriously.He made his senior USA debut in 2015 and, after battling injuries, became a regular member of the team from 2018 onward. In total, he has played 45 ODIs and 30 T20Is, picking up 54 and 31 wickets respectively.He was also part of the USA’s memorable 2024 T20 World Cup campaign, where the team stunned Pakistan, with Jasdeep dismissing Babar Azam in that historic match.His absence in 2026 will be a setback for the American side, but the addition of Ehsan Adil gives them an experienced pace option as they prepare for the global tournament.",Jasdeep Singh ruled out of ICC T20 World Cup 2026 with shoulder injury.

The ICC also made clear that the national team’s non-participation would not have any long-term impact on cricket in Bangladesh.Key outcomes from the discussions include:The ICC confirmed that Bangladesh will face no financial, sporting, or administrative sanctions in relation to its T20 World Cup absence. The BCB also retains the right to approach the Dispute Resolution Committee (DRC) under ICC regulations if it wishes. The ICC reiterated its commitment to neutrality and fairness, focusing on facilitation rather than punishment.As part of the agreement, Bangladesh has been confirmed to host an ICC event before the 2031 Men’s Cricket World Cup, subject to standard ICC hosting requirements. This decision reflects confidence in Bangladesh’s ability to stage international tournaments and demonstrates the ICC’s commitment to distributing hosting opportunities across its member nations.ICC Chief Executive Sanjog Gupta said, “Bangladesh’s absence from the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup is regrettable, but it does not alter our commitment to the country as a core cricketing nation.

NEW DELHI: Mexican authorities have announced that robot dogs will be deployed to assist police operations during the 2026 FIFA World Cup, as part of enhanced security measures for the tournament.The four-legged robotic units are built to venture into high-risk zones and relay live video footage to law enforcement teams, allowing officers to assess situations remotely before moving in during World Cup-related operations.The month-long global event, scheduled to run from June 11 to July 19, will be jointly hosted by Mexico, the United States and Canada.The robot dogs were purchased by the Guadalupe city council — located in the Monterrey metropolitan region, one of the World Cup host areas — at a cost of 2.5 million pesos (approximately $145,000). Monterrey is set to stage matches at BBVA Stadium, which will be temporarily renamed Estadio Monterrey for the tournament.Footage released by local authorities shows one of the robots navigating an abandoned structure, walking up staircases with measured precision while transmitting real-time visuals back to police officers following at a distance.During the demonstration, the robotic canine confronts an armed individual and uses a built-in loudspeaker to instruct him to drop his weapon, showcasing its role in frontline assessment and de-escalation.Guadalupe mayor Hector Garcia said the robots are intended to assist officers during initial interventions, reducing direct exposure to potential threats. “The objective is to protect the physical integrity of our police,” he said, adding that the machines will be deployed whenever disturbances or confrontations arise.Estadio Monterrey is scheduled to host four World Cup matches during the tournament.","Mexican authorities have announced that robot dogs will be deployed to assist police during the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

LIVERPOOL: Erling Haaland's stoppage-time penalty earned Manchester City a dramatic 2-1 win at Liverpool on Sunday to reduce Arsenal's lead at the top of the Premier League back to six points. City were heading for defeat at Anfield with six minutes to go before Bernardo Silva cancelled out Dominik Szoboszlai's stunning free-kick to spark an incredible finale.Haaland put City in front from the spot before the visitors had another goal ruled out and Szoboszlai was sent off in the same incident after a VAR review.Victory was City's first away to Liverpool in front of a crowd since 2003 and reapplies some pressure to Arsenal's quest for a first title in 22 years.""I feel the whole team knew before the game, if we lost it then the title race was probably over,"" said Silva. ""We felt like we needed to win.""Defeat delivered another blow to Liverpool's hopes of Champions League football next season.The defending champions remain down in sixth and four points adrift of the top five.These two clubs have combined to win the last eight Premier League titles, but both showed the flaws which have opened the door for Arsenal to potentially end their long wait to be crowned champions of England once again.Haaland has scored just once from open play in his last 13 games and an uncharacteristic lack of confidence from the Norwegian showed with the best chance of the first half inside the opening two minutes.Silva's clever pass split the Liverpool defence, but Haaland's shot lacked conviction under pressure from Milos Kerkez, and Alisson Becker was able to save low to his left.Second half slumps have been a consistent feature of City's season and the visitors again faded in the second period until a late flurry saved their title challenge.""Second half we pressed really high and played good football,"" said Liverpool boss Arne Slot. ""We have improved so much, but we need to improve the results.""Marc Guehi was relentlessly booed after his proposed move to Liverpool from Crystal Palace broke down on transfer deadline day in September.City took advantage to swoop in last month when they lost two key centre-backs to injury.Guehi was fortunate to escape with just a yellow card when he dragged down Mo Salah just outside the box in a decision that infuriated Slot.But it was City who were left fuming at the award of the free-kick which led to the opener when Ryan Gravenberch went down under minimal contact.Szoboszlai scored the only goal with an outrageous free-kick when Arsenal visited Anfield in August and produced another stunning strike which clipped the inside of the post before finding the net.However, the Hungarian went from hero to villain when City levelled six minutes from time.Szoboszlai played Silva onside as he slid in to volley home Haaland's header for City's first second-half goal in the Premier League this year.Alisson then wiped out Matheus Nunes to concede a penalty and Haaland kept his cool from the spot to put City in front.Pep Guardiola's men then needed a stunning save from Gianluigi Donnarumma to tip behind Alexis Mac Allister's deflected shot.With Alisson remaining forward from the resulting corner, the Liverpool goal was open when Rayan Cherki took aim from the halfway line to roll the ball into an empty net.However, Haaland and Szoboszlai's grappling as the ball trickled towards the goal saw the strike ruled out, with a free-kick awarded to City instead, and the Liverpool player given his marching orders.",Erling Haaland's stoppage-time penalty earned Manchester City a dramatic 2-1 win at Liverpool on Sunday.

Barcelona strengthened their grip on the La Liga title race with a commanding 3-0 victory over Mallorca on Saturday, opening up a four-point lead at the top of the table. Teenage sensation Lamine Yamal played a central role, responding to an earlier miss with a stunning long-range finish that underlined his growing influence. Robert Lewandowski set Barça on their way in the first half before 18-year-old academy graduate Marc Bernal wrapped up the points late on with the first goal of his senior career. The result gives Barcelona breathing space at the summit, although second-placed Real Madrid have the chance to cut the deficit to a single point when they travel to Valencia on Sunday.Lewandowski broke the deadlock in the 29th minute, reacting quickest after Marcus Rashford’s initial effort down the left was blocked. The striker calmly brought the ball under control, shifted it away from a defender and finished with precision from close range.Rashford’s growing confidence was evident again just before the interval. His curling free kick in stoppage time forced an excellent save from Mallorca goalkeeper Leo Roman. The rebound dropped invitingly for Jules Koundé inside the area, but his mishit effort fell to Yamal, who surprisingly failed to convert from virtually on the goal line.Lewandowski, one of the game’s most prolific scorers with more than 650 club goals to his name, was quick to encourage the young winger after the miss. Yamal made amends in emphatic fashion in the 61st minute. Skipping past a defender on the edge of the box, he unleashed a fierce, dipping left-footed strike into the bottom corner, leaving Roman rooted to the spot.Both Yamal and Lewandowski were substituted later in the match and watched on approvingly as Bernal added the third in the 83rd minute. Barcelona cut through Mallorca’s midfield with a sharp passing move that released the teenager, who showed impressive composure to glide past a defender and slot the ball neatly inside the post.Elsewhere in La Liga, two fixtures were postponed. Rayo Vallecano’s home clash with Oviedo was called off due to safety concerns over the pitch at Vallecas Stadium, while Sevilla’s match against Girona was also postponed because of adverse weather. Oviedo said it understood the decision but criticised the late notice and confirmed it was considering legal action.",Barcelona beat Mallorca 3-0 to move four points clear at the top of La Liga.

How Deshaun Watson’s long legal chapter shaped his career and league decisions



The long running civil legal saga involving Deshaun Watson has officially come to an end. According to USA Today, the final two civil lawsuits filed against the Cleveland Browns quarterback were dismissed before they could reach a courtroom. Both cases had been scheduled for trial in early 2026, but the plaintiffs chose to withdraw their claims before proceedings began.With those dismissals finalized on January 6, Watson no longer faces any active civil lawsuits connected to the misconduct allegations that surfaced in 2021. While no settlement details were disclosed publicly, league observers widely expect the final cases were resolved privately, similar to most of the earlier lawsuits. The development closes a legal chapter that has followed Watson for nearly five years and shaped his career as much as his performance on the field.A total of 27 women filed civil lawsuits accusing Watson of misconduct tied to private massage sessions that allegedly took place in 2020 and early 2021. At the time, Watson was still a member of the Houston Texans. Of those cases, 24 were resolved through confidential settlements, one was withdrawn shortly after being filed, and the final two were dismissed before trial.Prominent attorney Tony Buzbee represented nearly all of the plaintiffs, including one of the women involved in the last remaining cases.The Texans also reached separate settlements with women who accused the organization of enabling Watson’s behavior or failing to intervene during that period. Those agreements allowed the franchise to move forward as scrutiny around the situation continued. Watson has consistently denied wrongdoing, maintaining that some encounters were consensual.The National Football League reached a different conclusion following its own investigation, issuing Watson an 11 game suspension during the 2022 season. That discipline came even though criminal charges were never pursued.Despite the off field controversy, the Texans traded Watson to the Cleveland Browns in one of the most significant deals in league history. Cleveland committed to a fully guaranteed five year, $230 million contract, a move that sparked debate across the league. The civil cases being closed, Watson is in the next stage of his career without ongoing legal actions connected with the misconduct accusations.","The final two civil lawsuits filed against the Cleveland Browns quarterback were dismissed before they could reach a courtroom.

Here’s all you need to know about the logo conspiracy(Image via X)

Super Bowl logo conspiracy is back and fans think the colors are the clue

The Super Bowl logo conspiracy has returned after the NFL revealed the official logo for Super Bowl LXI, scheduled for Feb. 14, 2027, at SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles. The design, which shows a deep orange sunset behind a bright blue wave, has triggered fresh chatter among fans who believe the colours signal the two teams that will reach the championship game.The theory claims that the main colours in every Super Bowl logo secretly predict the finalists. According to believers, the NFL drops visual hints months in advance to shape storylines and drive attention. The idea gained popularity after fans noticed colour overlaps in recent Super Bowls.In Super Bowl LVI in 2022, the logo featured orange and yellow, the same dominant colours worn by the Los Angeles Rams and Cincinnati Bengals. In Super Bowl LVII in 2023, the logo used green and red, which matched the Philadelphia Eagles and Kansas City Chiefs. These examples continue to fuel the belief that the pattern is intentional.The Super Bowl LXI logo, unveiled on February 8, 2026, features an orange sky with a blue wave, inspired by Los Angeles’ coastal identity. Within hours, fans took to X to suggest the colours pointed to the Miami Dolphins, Cincinnati Bengals, or even another Seattle Seahawks appearance.The current scenario added fuel to the conversation. The Seattle Seahawks defeated the New England Patriots 29-13 to win Super Bowl LX. Rookie QB Drake Maye led the victory as HC Mike MacDonald and QB Sam Darnold lifted the Vince Lombardi Trophy during the post-game ceremony.The NFL has repeatedly denied the theory. Commissioner Roger Goodell addressed it during a league media session in N.Y. “It’s a ridiculous theory for anyone who might take it seriously,” he said while speaking to reporters.Recent history supports the league’s stance. The Super Bowl LX logo featured multiple bright colors, yet none clearly matched the Patriots or Seahawks, the two teams that played in the game.Still, fans continue to assign meaning. From the AFC, supporters link the Miami Dolphins, Cincinnati Bengals, Denver Broncos, and Jacksonville Jaguars to the logo’s orange and teal shades. Among NFC teams, the Seattle Seahawks, L.A. Rams, L.A. Chargers, San Francisco 49ers, and Carolina Panthers are often mentioned.The conspiracy may not hold up under facts, but it continues to thrive on hope, coincidence, and fan reactions. Until Super Bowl LXI kicks off in 2027, the talks will not stop.","The NFL revealed the official logo for Super Bowl LXI, scheduled for Feb. 14, 2027, at SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles.

Jason McCourty shifts focus to offensive structure as Drake Maye struggles under constant pressure



Jason McCourty did not mince words while breaking down what went wrong for the New England Patriots on football’s biggest night. Following a 29–13 defeat to the Seattle Seahawks in Super Bowl LX, the former Patriots safety focused less on individual mistakes and more on how the game was handled from the sideline. For McCourty, the loss revealed deeper issues tied to preparation and planning rather than effort alone.The Patriots entered the Super Bowl carrying the weight of a remarkable turnaround season under new head coach Mike Vrabel. A team that had gone 4–13 a year earlier suddenly found itself competing for a championship, with optimism building around a fast rebuild. That belief unraveled quickly as New England struggled to establish rhythm, protect its quarterback, or control momentum once the Seahawks seized command.Much of the postgame discussion centered on rookie quarterback Drake Maye, whose night was defined by early chaos. He was sacked six times, threw two interceptions including a damaging pick six, and looked uncomfortable as Seattle’s defense dictated terms. While Maye showed late composure in the fourth quarter and finished with two touchdown passes, the early breakdown proved costly.McCourty urged viewers to look beyond the stat line. Appearing on Monday’s episode of Up & Adams, he acknowledged that Maye missed a few throws but stressed that the larger failure belonged to the offensive structure around him.“There were throws that I felt like, in the course of the game, he missed. And that was probably five throws. But overall, when you watch that game, a lot of that to me fell on the coaches and gameplan-oriented ... There's enough blame to go around for every coach and player that's on the offensive side of the ball.”McCourty’s criticism centered on how exposed Maye appeared early. The offense offered limited answers to pressure, forcing the rookie into reactive football instead of controlled execution.By spreading accountability across coaches and players, McCourty reframed the loss as a collective breakdown rather than a rookie failure. His assessment resonates in New England, where standards remain high and explanations matter.",The New England Patriots lost 29–13 to the Seattle Seahawks in Super Bowl LX.

Alex Gonzalez turns Super Bowl LX into a marketing stunt

The fourth quarter of Super Bowl LX came to a sudden stop when a shirtless man ran across the field at Levi’s Stadium with 12:54 left on the clock. What first appeared to be a random disruption soon turned into something much bigger, as police confirmed the act was a planned publicity stunt intended to promote a business.Fans watched in disbelief as security chased the intruder near the 10-yard line and forced officials to pause the championship game between the Seahawks and the Patriots. Minutes later, authorities identified the man as Alex Gonzalez and announced that he now faces multiple charges for the incident.Santa Clara Police identified Gonzalez and charged him with misdemeanor trespassing and field intrusion after he entered the field during the fourth quarter. He ran across the turf before security closed in and stopped him near the end zone, with Patriots wide receiver Kyle Williams helping to block his path.TMZ Sports first reported the legal update later that night. As per the outlet, the Super Bowl LX action was halted after a fan went rogue and streaked the field during the fourth quarter at Levi’s Stadium. They further reported that he has been charged with two counts in connection with the incident.Gonzalez had promotional messages written across his body, including “Trade with Athena,” his social handle “fxalexg,” and the phrase “Trade in the Blindspot.” Police said the slogans were directly linked to his online day-trading business, making the stunt a deliberate attempt to turn the Super Bowl into a marketing stage.This was not his first time running onto the field during the NFL’s biggest game. Gonzalez also streaked during Super Bowl LVIII, when the Kansas City Chiefs played the San Francisco 49ers, and he performed the stunt with Sebastian Riviera. His history as a repeat offender led to stricter action this time.The game eventually resumed, and Seattle went on to defeat New England 29–13. Kenneth Walker III rushed for 135 yards on 27 carries and earned Super Bowl MVP, while Sam Darnold threw for 202 yards and a touchdown. Drake Maye struggled for the Patriots, throwing two interceptions and taking six sacks.Gonzalez later spoke during a live social media broadcast, admitting the act was intentional and tied to his personal goals. His attempt at attention may have worked online, but it now leaves him facing real legal consequences.","The fourth quarter of Super Bowl LX came to a sudden stop when a shirtless man ran across the field at Levi’s Stadium with 12:54 left on the clock.

Police say the shooting followed a nightclub dispute, with the 49ers confirming White’s injury was not life-threatening



San Francisco 49ers defensive lineman Keion White was shot in the ankle early Monday morning in San Francisco, just hours after Super Bowl celebrations wrapped up in the Bay Area. The incident occurred around 4 a.m. in the city’s Mission District following a verbal altercation inside a nightclub that escalated, prompting a police response. Authorities said the shooting took place during the dispute, and officers provided immediate aid before the injured individual was transported to a local hospital.White is recovering after the shooting and suffered a non life threatening injury, according to team officials and a source familiar with the matter. The San Francisco Police Department did not publicly identify the victim but confirmed the injured person is being treated as a victim in the case. No arrests had been made as of Monday evening, and investigators continue to seek information related to the incident while the 49ers monitor White’s condition and recovery timeline.Police officials said officers arriving at the scene found a victim suffering from an apparent gunshot wound and provided immediate aid before paramedics transported him to the hospital.The department’s Strategic Investigation Unit is handling the case, and officials noted that more details will be released as they become available.White was transported to San Francisco General Hospital, where he was treated for the gunshot wound and later underwent surgery. In a statement released Monday afternoon, the San Francisco 49ers said, “Keion White was a victim of a shooting and sustained a bullet wound to his ankle this morning in San Francisco. He is currently undergoing surgery at a local hospital. We will provide further updates when appropriate. ”White, 27, joined San Francisco on Oct. 28 after being acquired from the New England Patriots in a trade that involved late round 2026 draft picks. A second round selection in the 2023 NFL Draft, White showed flashes of ability in New England but struggled to secure a steady role. He recorded 88 tackles and 7.5 sacks across 38 games with the Patriots.With the 49ers, White appeared in nine games, made two starts, and finished with 12 tackles and 1.5 sacks. He remains under contract through the 2026 season and is expected to factor into the team’s defensive line rotation.

David Njoku confirms Browns exit plans, setting stage for big 2026 free-agency move



David Njoku confirmed Monday that his nine-year run with Cleveland is over, choosing free agency and signaling a personal reset after nearly a decade in one uniform. His message arrived quietly on Instagram, but its meaning was loud. Njoku is leaving the franchise that drafted him, developed him and watched him grow into a Pro Bowl talent.This is not a breakup built on bitterness. It is shaped by timing, health and change inside the organization. Cleveland is entering another transition phase, and Njoku, now 29, is choosing control over comfort. For a player who has endured injuries, coaching shifts and evolving roles, the decision feels measured rather than emotional.The story of David Njoku in Cleveland is layered. Drafted in the first round in 2017, he arrived as raw talent with elite athletic tools. Over nine seasons, he produced 4,062 receiving yards and 34 touchdowns, numbers that reflect consistency more than flash. His peak came in 2023, when he earned a Pro Bowl selection after posting 882 yards and six scores, becoming a reliable mismatch in the Browns offense.The past two seasons, however, told a different story. Injuries limited Njoku to 11 games in 2024 and 12 in 2025.This past season ended with just 293 yards and four touchdowns, his lowest output since 2020. Availability, not ability, became the defining issue.Still, Njoku’s final moments in brown and orange carried symbolism. His last on-field act was crowning Myles Garrett after the defensive star set the NFL single season sack record in the finale against Cincinnati. It was a quiet acknowledgment of brotherhood and legacy.In his farewell post, Njoku wrote, “Cleveland, first off I love you. These 9 years have been a beautiful journey. I’m am so grateful for all the memories we shared together. Thank you to The Haslams, Andrew Berry and the whole browns organization for everything!! All my teammates I shared the battle with I’m so grateful for you guys. The time for me to find a new home has come and all I can think of is just the gratefulness in my heart. The city of Cleveland will forever be home❤️ #ChiefOut”Former head coach Kevin Stefanski, who was dismissed shortly after the season, once described their relationship with honesty and respect. “He and I have a very unique relationship. He thinks I didn't like him when I first got here, which is not true. I just told him the truth and he didn't like that,” Stefanski said. “But to watch him mature and become a leader, the energy he brings in the building, the unbelievable plays that he's made over the years. … I think the world of the person. Obviously disappointed for this season and the injuries, but I think very highly of the person.”Stefanski’s exit may have influenced Njoku’s decision. So might the desire to chase a championship window while his body still allows it. After the Bengals game, Njoku admitted, “I do, but it’s not up to me,” when asked about returning. Now, it is up to him. And this time, he chose change.","David Njoku announces he won’t return to Browns in 2026. This is not a breakup built on bitterness.

Stefon Diggs future with the Patriots after Super Bowl LX loss



Stefon Diggs became one of the central figures of the New England Patriots’ 2025 season, and his name now sits at the heart of their most uncomfortable questions. Stefon Diggs was expected to shape big moments when it mattered most, especially on the sport’s biggest night. Instead, Super Bowl LX ended with a quiet stat line, a 29-13 loss to the Seattle Seahawks, and a growing sense of unfinished business for both player and franchise.The Patriots reached the Super Bowl on the back of discipline, balance, and Diggs’ steady production across the season. What unfolded on Sunday night told a different story. New England failed to score in the fourth quarter, and its offense struggled to counter Seattle’s relentless defense. The result did more than end a title dream. It opened a serious conversation about the team’s direction and about Diggs’ place in it.The questions began almost immediately after the final whistle. Diggs, now 32, signed a three-year deal with New England in March 2025 and quickly became a leader in a young locker room. His season included timely catches, sharp route running, and a calming presence when games tightened.The Super Bowl, however, was his least effective outing, and that contrast has followed him into the offseason.When asked whether he sees himself returning next season, Diggs did not hesitate.“Sh*t, I hope so,” he said, as per Dov Kleiman.He later expanded on that sentiment, pointing directly to his contract and his bond with teammates.“Unless they opt out of the contract, I anticipate being here,” Diggs told reporters, according to MassLive. “So, I hope so. Love my guys. I had a hell of a year playing with them. Built some real family-like bond, so I hope so, I don’t control it though.”From the Patriots’ perspective, the decision is layered. Spotrac notes an out in Diggs’ contract before the 2026 season. Moving on before June 1 would free notable cap space. Keeping him means a $28 million cap hit and more than $20 million in salary next year. The choice comes down to belief. Do the Patriots view Diggs as a cornerstone for another run or as a luxury they can no longer afford?Away from the field, Diggs has also found himself in headlines. On Monday, Feb. 9, fans noticed that he and Cardi B unfollowed each other on Instagram, fueling split rumors just a day after the Super Bowl loss. Their relationship had drawn public attention since their first appearance at a New York Knicks playoff game in May 2025, followed by the birth of their son on Nov. 4, 2025. The speculation arrives amid serious legal matters, as Diggs has denied allegations of slapping and choking a woman at his Massachusetts home. According to CBS News, he faces a felony charge of strangulation and a misdemeanor charge of assault, with a court date scheduled for Feb. 13.For now, football remains the Patriots’ priority. Diggs wants to stay. His contract suggests continuity. The franchise must decide whether belief outweighs cost and circumstance.","Stefon Diggs was expected to shape big moments when it mattered most.

Drake Maye reflects on Super Bowl defeat, says coming home to a loving wife beats any trophy



Drake Maye lost the chance to win the Super Bowl , but the young QB is up and ready for the future with faith in his mind. The New England Patriots quarterback used Super Bowl media availability to make clear what drives him, grounding the moment not in hype or pressure, but in belief, relationships, and purpose beyond football.“Faith, family, and football. That’s me to a T. I think in that order,” Maye said at last Monday’s media availability for the Super Bowl. At just 23, Maye arrived on the sport’s grandest stage as one of the youngest quarterbacks to do so, carrying the weight of a franchise revival and the calm of someone anchored by conviction.“I’m a follower of Jesus Christ,” he added. “It’s the biggest thing in my life. And keeping that at No. 1, and knowing that that is what’s gotten me here and what helps me get here.” Those words framed the week. They explained how a quarterback coming off a four-win season a year ago could handle a Super Bowl spotlight with steady clarity.The Super Bowl itself tested that resolve. Playing with a sore shoulder that limited his preparation and required a painkilling injection before kickoff, Maye absorbed constant punishment from a relentless Seattle defense.He was hit 11 times and sacked six times as the Patriots fell short.“It hurts, no doubt — definitely hurts,” said the emotional young quarterback after the game. Maye did not deflect responsibility, saying he needed to “make better throws,” while still praising teammates for a season few predicted. The response reflected maturity shaped by perspective, not panic.That perspective extends off the field. Throughout the season, Maye has spoken openly about the role of his longtime girlfriend and now wife, Ann Michael Maye. Their bond began in middle school and deepened through each stage of his rise. “It’s special,” Drake Maye said, recalling how she once watched his middle school games and now cheers from the Super Bowl stands. “I wouldn’t rather do it with anybody else.”The couple married last summer in North Carolina. “Getting married is one of the best decisions I’ve made in my life,” he said, noting how marriage brought stability, routine, and balance. From late dinners to simple daily conversations, Maye credits that constant support with helping him manage the demands of professional football. “There’s no better feeling than coming home to a wife that loves you,” Drake Maye told the media this week before the Super Bowl.Faith remains the throughline. Asked about it later in the week, Maye described it as something bigger than wins or losses. “It’s a constant in my life,” he told Sports Spectrum, explaining how it centers his purpose and focus. For Maye, football is the platform, not the destination.",Drake Maye is one of the youngest quarterbacks to play in the Super Bowl. The 23-year-old says he is a follower of Jesus Christ. He says coming home to a loving wife beats any trophy in the world. Maye has spoken openly about the role of his longtime girlfriend.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128135472,imgsize-76340,width-400,resizemode-4/drake-maye.jpg"
Stefon Diggs allegedly caught sneaking another woman into hotel room as breakup rumors with Cardi B explodes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/stefon-diggs-allegedly-caught-sneaking-another-woman-into-hotel-room-as-breakup-rumors-with-cardi-b-explodes/articleshow/128133231.cms,"Rumors are swirling around Cardi B and Stefon Diggs after fans noticed they unfollowed each other following the Super Bowl. Speculation intensified when Cardi left the event early and reports surfaced alleging Diggs was seen with another woman in a hotel room hours after the loss. Neither has confirmed a breakup, but online chatter continues to grow.

Cardi B and Stefon Diggs face split speculation after hotel room claim

Tension around Cardi B and Stefon Diggs has moved from whispers to full-blown speculation, with fans closely watching every digital and public move. What once looked like a high-profile romance backed by public appearances and loyalty now appears strained, especially after Super Bowl weekend triggered a fresh wave of questions.Online observers were quick to notice subtle but telling changes. Social media connections vanished. Public support faded. Cardi, who had long defended Diggs and showed up for his biggest career moments, appeared distant during a night that usually brings couples closer together. That silence spoke louder than words for many fans following the pair closely.The speculation intensified after reports surfaced about an alleged incident following the Super Bowl loss. According to circulating claims, Diggs was seen with someone unexpected shortly after the game, sparking renewed debate about trust within the relationship. One claim spreading rapidly online states:“caught TONIGHT (February 8) sneaking his girl bestfriend into his hotel room not even an hour after he lost the superbowl.”Neither Cardi nor Diggs has publicly addressed the allegation. Still, fans connected the dots after Cardi reportedly left the Super Bowl event early following her appearance during Bad Bunny’s performance. She did not stay on to support Diggs, a move that felt unusual given her past commitment to cheering him on from the stands.The timeline has just contributed to the mystery. Later that year in late 2024, the couple started dating and created the first child together named Baby Brim in November, 2025.The abrupt change of tone also seemed more acute with that milestone because it was more personal to people following their story.At this, all is still unproven. But in the celebrity relationship world, silence can be called upon to draw conclusions. No matter which way this chapter is closed, be it reconciliation or separation, the allure around Cardi B and Stefon Diggs is not going to decrease.","Cardi B and Stefon Diggs face split speculation after hotel room claim.

“People don't acknowledge…”: Kylie Kelce shuts down mom guilt with honest parenting confessions,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/people-dont-acknowledge-kylie-kelce-shuts-down-mom-guilt-with-honest-parenting-confessions/articleshow/128115311.cms,"Kylie Kelce is embracing honest motherhood while balancing a busy career. From recording her podcast days after giving birth to breastfeeding during interviews, she refuses to separate work and parenting. Kelce openly acknowledges needing childcare support and rejects mom guilt. She believes women can be both professional and present mothers without embarrassment or apology.

Why Kylie Kelce refuses to separate work from motherhood

Kylie Kelce Talks Coaching Field Hockey, Super Bowl Plans, More

Kylie Kelce does not pretend motherhood is polished. She records podcasts days after giving birth. She nurses her baby during interviews. She admits to bribing a toddler with candy. And she lets cameras capture the chaos of a home that feels lived in. For Kelce, the balance between career and family is not a branding strategy. It is daily life, unfolding in real time.On a recent Friday, that life meant waking up at midnight with one of her daughters, then leaving Philadelphia at 4 am to make an 8:30 am appearance in New York City. In the greenroom, she brushed on makeup and shrugged off the attention around her candid parenting style. “It’s just happening,” she said, describing how motherhood naturally shows up in her public work.Kelce’s honesty stands out in a culture where many public figures keep childcare off the record. She does the opposite. When she needed to record her ""Not Gonna Lie"" podcast while feeding her newborn Finn, she logged in anyway. “I actually had Finn under my shirt. And (guest Caleb Hearon) said, 'Why is there a hand coming out of your collar?'” she recalled.“And I'm like, 'Oh, that's Finn. She's busy. Don't mind us.'”She does not see that as unprofessional. In fact, she challenges the idea that mothers must hide that part of themselves. “Don’t take yourself too seriously in terms of being embarrassed that you are a mother,"" she said. ""Because you can be professional and you can be a mother, and they don’t have to be entirely separate.""Kelce also speaks openly about having help. “It's silly to me that people don't acknowledge that they have help,"" she explained. ""We do have help. We love Lauren and we love my mom and we love friends and chosen family. And so when my husband and I are busy and we're running around we know that they're still with a safe and loved individual."" She adds with a laugh, ""No, no. I also need the nanny.""Her message is simple. “As women, we don't have to be embarrassed of our bodies,” she said. And in the same spirit, she believes mothers should not feel shame about support. Success, after all, often takes a village.","Kylie Kelce is embracing honest motherhood while balancing a busy career. Kelce openly acknowledges needing childcare support and rejects mom guilt.

He threw two interceptions, lost a fumble, and was sacked six times. Meanwhile, Bad Bunny’s halftime show drew massive attention, with fans joking he advanced further on the field than Maye. The performance also sparked controversy after being called “absolutely terrible.”

Drake Maye humiliated as Bad Bunny outshines Patriots in Super Bowl LX meltdown

Super Bowl LX delivered drama on the field and spectacle at halftime, but few storylines cut deeper than Drake Maye’s long night under the bright lights. The New England Patriots quarterback struggled from the opening drive as the Seattle Seahawks defense swarmed him without mercy. By halftime, the game already felt out of reach. The Vince Lombardi Trophy never seemed in doubt.Seattle controlled the tempo from start to finish. Maye faced constant pressure, throwing two interceptions, losing a fumble, and absorbing six sacks. Though he finished with 295 passing yards, the stat sheet masked the chaos. His first touchdown came late, when the outcome was all but sealed. For a second year quarterback once compared to Tom Brady, it was a humbling stage.While Maye searched for answers, Bad Bunny commanded the field during the Super Bowl LX halftime show. The global superstar blended music, culture, and visual storytelling in a performance that quickly overshadowed the game itself. At one point, he carried a football marked with the phrase ""Together we are america,"" turning it into a symbol within his act.Social media wasted no time drawing comparisons. As Maye and the Patriots remained scoreless at halftime, fans joked that Bad Bunny advanced farther across the field than the New England offense.The commentary grew louder when President Donald Trump labeled the show ""absolutely terrible"" online, sparking heated debate nationwide.For the Seahawks, the night ended in celebration. Their defense dictated every snap and secured another championship in dominant fashion. For Maye, it became a lesson in growth. Quarterbacks are often defined by how they respond to failure, not just victory. He is only in his second season, and development rarely follows a straight path.Super Bowl LX will be remembered as much for its halftime controversy as its lopsided score. One side lifted the trophy. The other left with questions. And somewhere in between, a pop icon with a football changed the narrative of the night.","Drake Maye threw two interceptions, lost a fumble, and was sacked six times.

Brittany Mahomes shuts down WAG stereotype with impressive NFL knowledge test,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/brittany-mahomes-shuts-down-wag-stereotype-with-impressive-nfl-knowledge-test/articleshow/128112950.cms,"Brittany Mahomes stepped into the spotlight with Sports Illustrated Swimsuit, proving she is far more than an NFL spouse. Featured on a digital cover, she also impressed fans by confidently answering challenging football trivia, including key Super Bowl history. The project highlighted women who are ""reshaping what it truly means to be a so-called WAG by simply being themselves.""

Brittany Mahomes proves her football IQ is the real deal

Brittany Mahomes is no longer just a familiar face in the luxury box. At this year’s Sports Illustrated Swimsuit digital launch, she stepped forward with confidence, proving she understands football as deeply as she embraces fashion and business. Photographed on Captiva Island at South Seas in Fort Myers, Florida, Mahomes appeared on one of six individual covers that spotlight a new generation of NFL partners redefining their public image.The feature did more than celebrate style. It challenged long held assumptions about what it means to be labeled a WAG. Instead of standing quietly on the sidelines, Mahomes and her peers took center stage. The magazine described the women as ""reshaping what it truly means to be a so-called WAG by simply being themselves."" That message set the tone for everything that followed.During the shoot, Mahomes and fellow partners including Christen Goff, Claire Kittle, Haley Cavinder, Ronika Love and Normani were asked to put their NFL knowledge to the test. The questions were not simple trivia. They covered core rules and Super Bowl history . Mahomes handled them with ease.She knew how many points a team earns from a safety. She understood the structure of four quarters and how long each lasts.When the group faced a tougher question about the largest margin of victory in Super Bowl history, they paused. The answer was the San Francisco 49ers’ 45 point win over the Denver Broncos in Super Bowl XXIV on January 28, 1990.The moment mattered. It showed fans that Brittany Mahomes is more than Patrick Mahomes ’ wife. She follows the game closely. She studies it. She speaks the language of football with clarity and confidence.Sports Illustrated emphasized that this evolution is about influence and independence. These women are making brands, helping with charitable work, and changing the way people talk about business and culture. Mahomes is a good example of that change. She balances being a mother, running a business, and being in the public eye while still being involved in the sport that is a part of her family's history.In a league where perception often lags behind reality, Brittany Mahomes just delivered a reminder. She is not on the sidelines. She is in the game.","Brittany Mahomes appeared on a digital cover for Sports Illustrated Swimsuit.

Stephen Curry reveals simple rule to married life with Ayesha Curry



What is Stephen and Ayesha Curry-starrer GOAT about?



Stephen Curry knows pressure. He lives with it on the court, carries it into business ventures, and feels it at home while raising four children. At the Los Angeles premiere of GOAT on Friday, the Warriors star spoke about how he and Ayesha Curry keep their marriage steady amid busy schedules and public attention.The 37-year-old Golden State Warriors superstar shared that the foundation of their relationship has nothing to do with grand gestures. It centers on how they speak to each other when life becomes demanding. That approach, he said, allows them to handle stress without letting it turn personal. For Stephen and Ayesha, clarity and connection have been non-negotiable.Speaking exclusively to PEOPLE, Stephen Curry said open and honest communication has been the secret to their happy married lives. “It sounds kind of cheesy, but it's really a foundation,” he told the outlet. “We built that over time, where you can say whatever is on your mind and it doesn’t come off as a personal attack or anything.”Curry further acknowledged his busy schedule often takes a toll while balancing his life. “Life is hard and you're trying to, you know, handle all the stress and especially as parents, too. But if you can prioritize that, then prioritize each other as much as possible, that's the foundation,” he added.Ayesha Curry also shared that staying connected does not always require elaborate plans. “Even if it's a night like this, like, that's a date night for us,” she said. “That togetherness and that foundation of why we started this life together in the first place is always at the core of it.”Married since 2011, the couple recently celebrated 14 years together.

Stephen Curry to miss 2026 All-Star Games, Head Coach Steve Kerr makes the unfortunate announcement

Why Golden State Warriors should be careful about bringing back Stephen Curry on the court?

On Monday, February 9, ahead of the clash against the Memphis Grizzlies, the Golden State Warriors' head coach, Steve Kerr, had an unfortunate update. It was about the injury status of the team’s star guard, Stephen Curry. The athlete sustained a knee injury, because of which he was ruled out for evaluation during the game against the Detroit Pistons. It seems like the problem has not been solved yet, as Curry will be missing the All-Star Games of 2026.Since January 30, Curry has not played a single game. This has affected the performance of the team as a whole. In the 2025-2026 season, Curry is averaging 27.2 points with 3.5 rebounds and 4.8 assists. The latest news about the athlete is disappointing, not just for the fans but also for the team. The Warriors are struggling in the games without their top players.Stephen Curry has been the pillar of the Golden State Warriors. In his absence, the team has been struggling with a win-loss stat of 5-9. Curry won’t be playing against the Memphis Grizzlies and he will definitely not be playing against the San Antonio Spurs on Wednesday.Amidst all these, the athlete has now been ruled out of the 2026 All-Star Games. This was announced by the team’s head coach, Steve Kerr. Now the league will have to look for a player to replace Curry in the All-Star Games.This season, the Golden State Warriors have been able to leave a mark on the league. They are currently in the 8th spot of the Western Conference. Their win-loss stat is 28-25. After the All-Star weekend, the regular season for the Warriors will start on February 19. They will be facing the Boston Celtics. While Curry will miss the two matchups during this week, it has not been confirmed that the athlete will return for the game on 19th February.The Golden State Warriors are already far behind how they actually expected the season to turn out. Especially after Jimmy Butler was ruled out due to a torn ACL. The entire responsibility would now fall on Stephen Curry. However, Curry has been facing problems in his right knee ever since he banged it in November 2025. Curry is suffering from patellofemoral pain syndrome (Runner’s knee). The athlete has suffered knee soreness in the past. Hence, it is important to first get the athlete completely cured before allowing him on the court again.",Stephen Curry has been ruled out of the 2026 All-Star Games.

Chaos erupted in the Detroit Pistons vs Charlotte Hornets



What happens next for the players involved?



The routine Detroit Pistons vs Charlotte Hornets Eastern Conference matchup spiraled into one of the season’s most volatile moments Monday night in Charlotte. The Detroit Pistons and Charlotte Hornets saw their game at Spectrum Center grind to a halt after tempers flared midway through the third quarter, leading to multiple fights and four player ejections. The incident also pulled in players from both teams, forcing officials into an extended stoppage.The disruption came with Detroit seizing control of the game. The Pistons were in the middle of a strong run, having erased an earlier deficit and pushed ahead on the scoreboard.With a little over seven minutes remaining in the third quarter, Hornets big man Moussa Diabate delivered a hard foul on Pistons center Jalen Duren. They have exchanged words and then had physical contact. Duren shoved Diabate in the face, and Miles Bridges joined, shoving Duren in response. Diabate then threw a punch and had to be restrained by teammates and coaches as he continued to pursue Duren.Moments later, Bridges broke free and extended the fight. That action drew Isaiah Stewart into the fray from the Pistons bench. Stewart sprinted onto the floor and put Bridges in a headlock before players and staff separated them.Officials assessed fighting fouls to Duren, Stewart, Bridges, and Diabate, triggering automatic ejections for all four.After the order was restored, Pistons backup Paul Reed entered the game for Duren and went to the free-throw line under league substitution rules. Detroit led 71-62 at that point, finishing a 24-7 run that stretched back into the second quarter.The chaos did not end there. With under six minutes left in the game, Hornets head coach Charles Lee was ejected after reacting angrily to a collision at the other end of the floor and had to be held back by players.The NBA is expected to review the incident closely. League discipline often extends outside the game ejections, especially when punches are thrown or players continue to engage after officials intervene. The film review will focus on who escalated the situation, who pursued opponents, and whether any actions warrant fines or suspensions.As for Lee, considering the heated situation, the league may add a fine for him as well.","The Detroit Pistons and Charlotte Hornets saw their game at Spectrum Center grind to a halt after tempers flared midway through the third quarter.

Puka Nacua drops emotional message for LeBron James in recent viral clip

Did Bad Bunny take a shot at LeBron James during Super Bowl?

LeBron James' popularity extends beyond the members and fans of the basketball community. He has been widely acknowledged and appreciated by athletes from other sports as well. NFL star Puka Nacua was the latest one to join the line. The NFL athlete, in a recent clip, urged LeBron never to retire and highlighted some of the biggest achievements of his career, calling him the GOAT. Puka wanted LeBron to never leave the game and the latter can instead walk out of the court without his knees.Puka’s statement came when the discussions revolving around LeBron’s retirement were at their peak. There have been talks within the league that the athlete might be joining some other team before he finally decides to walk from the court forever.In a recent clip uploaded by Snapback Sports, NFL star Puka Nacua made a comparison between LeBron James and Michael Jordan . In the clip, Puka got emotional as he dropped the message for the NBA legend. He stated, “Score 40 when you’re a teen, scored 40 when you were 40. The only person to take 3 different franchises to the big dance and get it done for them. Never seen Michael Jordan do that.” Puka then went on to make a request to LeBron regarding the latter’s future within the league.He further added, “I never want you to leave. Never retire. They could never do no wrong. You could walk out on the basketball court with no knees and only your left hand and give the NBA 25/5/5, just like you’ve done for 27 years straight.” Towards the end, Puka decided to make a personal request to the NBA veteran. The NFL star wanted a jersey. Puka stated, “You’re the best, I love you so much. I still need a jersey, I’ll still be at the games. LeGOAT.” It seems like the NFL star indeed is a huge fan of the NBA athlete.Bad Bunny performed during the halftime of the Super Bowl. There, he sang a song that many later interpreted as a shot at LeBron. The lyrics of the song, when translated, read like, “And (JJ) Barea (who’s also from Puerto Rico), the one who became champion before LeBron.” Barea was a member of the Dallas Mavericks squad that defeated the Miami Heat in the finals. At that time, LeBron was a part of the Heat team.","NFL star Puka Nacua made a comparison between LeBron James and Michael Jordan.

Jayson Tatum joins Maine Celtics in unusual rehab step that could accelerate his return to Boston



What happened to Jayson Tatum?



Boston is calling Jayson Tatum back. On Monday, the Celtics assigned their franchise forward to the Maine Celtics for a controlled practice session. The assignment was brief, as it was planned to make his rehabilitation process fluid as he works back from a torn right Achilles tendon suffered during last year’s playoffs.The decision arrives with Boston firmly positioned near the top of the Eastern Conference standings. At 34-19, the Celtics have stayed competitive without their All-Star leader. That context matters. The organization continues to prioritize long-term health while measuring how close Tatum is to returning to full basketball activity at an NBA pace.Jayson Tatum was assigned to practice with the Maine Celtics in Boston and was slated to be immediately recalled afterward. The team framed the move as part of his rehab progression, allowing him to work in a live setting without the demands of a full NBA practice or game environment. According to multiple reports, Tatum has already advanced to five-on-five workouts, a critical phase in any recovery from an Achilles injury.Celtics President of Basketball Operations Brad Stevens addressed Tatum’s status last week. “He’s doing more and more and will continue to do more and more,” Stevens said on Friday.“He’s still got a ways to go.”The Celtics did not place a timeline on his return to game action. The organization also assigned Hugo Gonzalez and Amari Williams to join Tatum in Monday’s session, keeping the focus on structured reps.Tatum tore his right Achilles tendon on May 12 during the Eastern Conference semifinals against the New York Knicks. The injury ended his postseason and sidelined him for the entire 2025-26 regular season to date. Before getting hurt, Tatum remained one of the league’s most consistent performers. He averaged 26.8 points, 8.7 rebounds, and 6.0 assists over 72 games last season and earned his sixth straight All-Star selection.ESPN’s Shams Charania recently outlined where Tatum stands in the process. “My understanding is that these five-on-five scrimmages have been taking place with coaches in the stay-ready group on the Celtics,” Charania said.“He’s still got more boxes to check. Obviously, the next natural progression is for him to feel comfortable enough to practice with the rest of the roster and his teammates.“When he’s 100% confident in his leg and his body, and when he’s fully cleared by the Celtics’ medical staff. That’s when he’ll make his return.”It is fair to assume that Tatum could return this week if all goes according to plan.","Jayson Tatum was assigned to practice with the Maine Celtics in Boston.

Oklahoma City Thunder's Bottom line

when theface the Los Angeles Lakers on Monday,. The team has ruled him out with an abdominal strain, and he is expected to remain sidelined until after the NBA All-Star break.His absence leaves Oklahoma City without its leading scorer and main ball-handler. The Thunder will rely more on their depth and defense as they prepare for a road game against a Western Conference opponent.No. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander is officially listed as out on the injury report and will not be available for this game. He is also not expected to play again before the All-Star break.The Thunder have taken a cautious approach with the injury and will wait until the break ends before deciding when he can return.Gilgeous-Alexander felt discomfort during Oklahoma City’s 128-92 win over the Orlando Magic on February 3, 2026. He finished with 20 points and nine assists in 28 minutes. Tests after the game confirmed an abdominal strain.The team decided he should miss at least five games and be reevaluated once the schedule resumes after All-Star Weekend. Oklahoma City’s first game after the break is set for February 20, 2026, against the Brooklyn Nets, which could be the earliest point for his return.Oklahoma City is still slightly favored entering the game, largely because of its defense and roster balance. Still, losing Gilgeous-Alexander changes how the team runs its offense.• Production gap: He has averaged about 31.8 points, 6.4 assists, and 4.4 rebounds this season while shooting roughly 55.4% from the field and 39.0% from three-point range.• Bigger roles: Cason Wallace, Isaiah Joe, and Aaron Wiggins are expected to handle more scoring and playmaking duties. Chet Holmgren could also see more touches in half-court sets.The Thunder have already lost consecutive games without him, including matchups against the Spurs and Rockets. They committed a season-high 17 turnovers against Houston, something the Lakers may try to exploit.Thunder injury report snapshot (February 9, 2026)• Shai Gilgeous-Alexander - Out (Abdominal strain)• Ajay Mitchell - Out (Abdominal strain)• Thomas Sorber - Out (Recovery/undisclosed)• Jalen Williams - Expected to return vs. Lakers (hamstring)Williams’ expected return should help with scoring and playmaking, but the Thunder will still look different from their usual lineup.Los Angeles is dealing with its own injuries, but Gilgeous-Alexander’s absence removes one of the league’s toughest offensive matchups. Even so, Oklahoma City remains one of the stronger defensive teams in the West, allowing fewer than 108 points per game.His injury has also affected betting and fantasy outlooks:• Thunder moneyline and spread: Oklahoma City remains a narrow road favorite.• Player props: Holmgren, Wallace, and Joe are likely to see increased projections because of higher usage.The Thunder plan to reevaluate Shai Gilgeous-Alexander after the All-Star break. If recovery goes as expected, the February 20 home game against Brooklyn is the earliest realistic target.Until then, Oklahoma City will depend on its defense, Holmgren’s impact on both ends, and shared backcourt responsibilities.• Shai Gilgeous-Alexander is out against the Lakers with an abdominal strain and is expected to miss games through the All-Star break.• The Thunder remain competitive because of their defense and depth, but the offense may not be as consistent.• Holmgren and several guards are expected to take on larger roles, while the Lakers may focus on forcing turnovers and attacking the perimeter.Also read: Is LeBron James playing tonight vs the Oklahoma City Thunder? Latest update on the Los Angeles Lakers star's injury report (February 9, 2026) Oklahoma City is still capable, but it will enter this game without the player who usually leads its offense.","Shai Gilgeous-Alexander is out with an abdominal strain and is expected to miss games through the All-Star break.

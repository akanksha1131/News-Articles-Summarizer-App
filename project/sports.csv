India Names ODI Squad: KL Rahul Captain, Jadeja Returns, Axar Omitted

NEW DELHI: Veteran Indian opener Rohit Sharma has reclaimed the No.1 spot in the latest ICC ODI batting rankings — just days before India begin their three-match ODI series against South Africa in Ranchi on Sunday.Rohit overtook New Zealand star Daryl Mitchell , who slipped in the charts after missing the final two ODIs of the Black Caps’ 3-0 sweep against the West Indies. The dip cost Mitchell crucial rating points, allowing the Indian opener to leapfrog him and re-establish himself as the world’s leading ODI batter heading into the high-profile clash at the JSCA Stadium.The latest update also brought movement across formats. New Zealand’s Rachin Ravindra rose one place to 12th, while Devon Conway climbed to 31st among ODI batters. West Indies captain Shai Hope broke into eighth after his unbeaten century in the second ODI against New Zealand.Zimbabwe all-rounder Sikandar Raza added another milestone to his remarkable late-career surge by becoming the new No.1-ranked T20I all-rounder for the first time. His sharp all-round show in the ongoing tri-series involving Sri Lanka and Pakistan saw him climb past Pakistan’s Saim Ayub, capping a run of consistency that has kept him in the top 10 across formats since 2022.In Test cricket, Australia and Bangladesh saw major gains following strong wins in Perth and Mirpur. Australia’s Travis Head climbed to sixth among Test batters after his fourth-innings heroics, while pacer Mitchell Starc jumped to fifth in the Test bowling table. Bangladesh’s Mushfiqur Rahim, Litton Das and Mominul Haque all recorded healthy bumps after their 217-run victory over Ireland.Rohit’s rise comes during a milestone week off the field as well, with the ICC announcing him as the official ambassador for the 2026 ICC Men’s T20 World Cup, co-hosted by India and Sri Lanka. The 37-year-old—who retired from T20Is after lifting the 2024 title — remains one of world cricket’s most recognisable faces, having scored 1,220 runs across nine T20 World Cups.",Rohit overtook New Zealand star Daryl Mitchell.

16-year-old national-level basketball player Hardik Rathi died in a freak accident at a sports complex in Haryana’s Rohtak on Tuesday after an iron basketball pole collapsed on him during practice. The victim, Hardik, had represented Haryana in multiple sub-junior and youth national championships.The incident took place at the Lakhan Majra village sports ground and was captured on CCTV. Other players rushed to lift the pole and move him to hospital, but he succumbed to his injuries.As per a TOI report, the Lakhan Majra facility, which falls under the Gram Panchayat, had reportedly not undergone proper maintenance for nearly four years, raising concerns over the upkeep of rural and district-level sports infrastructure in Haryana.The teenager had a strong record at national events, winning medals at the Sub-Junior Nationals in Kangra and Hyderabad, and the Youth Nationals in Puducherry.The tragedy has intensified scrutiny over the state of sports infrastructure in Haryana, especially as it comes just two days after a similar case in Bahadurgarh, where a 15-year-old boy died when a basketball pole fell on him during practice.Following the Rohtak incident, Sports State Minister Gaurav Gautam suspended the District Sports Officer and temporarily shut the basketball court.A high-level review meeting has been scheduled for November 28 at Tau Devilal Stadium.Olympic gold medallist Abhinav Bindra reacted sharply to the incident, posting an emotional message on X. “A child stepped onto a court with joy and energy… and he never returned home,” he wrote, calling it a pain no parent should endure. He urged authorities to treat the tragedy as a reminder of how much care must go into safeguarding sporting spaces, adding that every child “should feel safe when they step onto a playground, a field or a court.”Chief Minister Nayab Singh Saini said he will seek a full report on the matter.",16-year-old basketball player Hardik Rathi died in a freak accident at a sports complex in Haryana’s Rohtak on Tuesday.

Indian women’s cricket vice-captain Smriti Mandhana ’s wedding celebrations in Sangli, Maharashtra, were abruptly halted on Sunday when her father, Shrinivas Mandhana , fell seriously ill. Hospitalised immediately, his condition forced the couple to postpone the much-anticipated ceremony. Mandhana’s business manager, Tuhin Mishra, confirmed that the decision to halt proceedings was made by the cricketer herself, prioritising her father’s recovery. “Smriti is very close to her father. She decided that until her father gets well, this marriage… is indefinitely postponed,” Mishra said.Initially feared to be a heart attack, Mandhana’s father was later diagnosed with angina. Dr Naman Shah, the family physician, explained that Shrinivas experienced left-sided chest pain, with elevated cardiac enzyme readings and high blood pressure prompting hospital observation. “If the situation exacerbates, we will have to do angiography,” Dr Shah noted, adding that his condition was being closely monitored.In a stressful turn, Mandhana’s fiancé Palash Muchhal was also admitted to a hospital shortly after her father’s illness.He was treated for viral symptoms and acidity issues, though his condition was not serious. Following initial treatment in Sangli, Palash has been moved to Mumbai for rest and recovery, under the watchful eye of his family.Following the events, Mandhana deleted all wedding-related posts from her Instagram, including her proposal video. Her teammates and close friends, including Jemimah Rodrigues , Shreyanka Patil, and Radha Yadav, also removed or unfollowed related content, fueling speculation among fans. Mandhana’s older casual posts featuring Palash remain unaffected.Palash’s sister, singer Palak Muchhal , requested privacy for the families during this difficult time. Meanwhile, Palash’s mother, Amita Muchhal, revealed the depth of her son’s bond with Mandhana’s father. “Palash is extremely attached to Smriti’s father, even more than Smriti herself. When he fell ill, Palash immediately insisted that the wedding be postponed until he recovered,” she explained. Amita also described Palash’s brief hospitalisation, where he received an IV drip, ECG, and other tests after stress took a toll on his health.As of now, neither Smriti Mandhana nor Palash Muchhal has confirmed a new wedding date. Both families remain focused on Shrinivas Mandhana’s recovery and the couple’s emotional well-being.","Indian women's cricket vice-captain Smriti Mandhana’s wedding celebrations in Sangli, Maharashtra, were abruptly halted on Sunday.

Look who is back! Virat Kohli arrives for the ODI series vs South Africa

NEW DELHI: Social media speculation claiming that Indian cricketer Smriti Mandhana had unfollowed her fiancé, Palash Muchhal , on Instagram has turned out to be incorrect. Their wedding, originally scheduled for September 23, was postponed due to medical emergencies involving both families.A verification by TOI Sports confirmed that Mandhana is still following Muchhal on Instagram, despite screenshots circulating online suggesting otherwise.However, Mandhana has taken down all wedding-related posts from her social media platforms.The decision to postpone the wedding was made after Mandhana’s father developed heart-attack-like symptoms during breakfast on the morning of the ceremony and was rushed to Sarvhit Hospital.Just a day later, Palash also suffered health complications and required medical attention.With Mandhana’s father still under observation, both families mutually agreed to delay the wedding until he and Palash fully recover.Palash’s mother, Amita Muchhal, told the Hindustan Times that her son had already been considering postponement even before Mandhana made the decision.""Palash is very emotionally attached to Smriti's father, Shrinivas Mandhana.Their relationship is even closer than the Smriti-Palash chemistry,"" Amita Muchhal said.She explained that Palash became extremely distressed after the haldi ceremony when Mandhana’s father fell ill, which triggered his own health issues. He required around four hours of medical care, including an IV drip and ECG tests. While his reports have since returned to normal, he continues to experience stress-related symptoms.The wedding has now been postponed indefinitely as both families prioritise recovery and well-being. Despite ongoing social media rumours of a breakup, the families have clarified that the delay is due solely to medical circumstances.","Smriti Mandhana has taken down all wedding-related posts from her social media platforms.

(PTI Photo)

NEW DELHI: India allrounder Ravindra Jadeja said on Tuesday that the likely series loss to South Africa will not influence India’s next Test assignment in Sri Lanka in August next year. He added that managing to draw the second Test would feel like a ""win"" for the young side.India are on the verge of losing the two-Test series, with a target of 549 to chase on the final day.""I don't think it will affect the next series. But, as a cricketer, nobody wants to lose the series, especially in India. So, hopefully, we will try our best cricket. We will try to put our best foot forward tomorrow,"" Jadeja, who has taken seven wickets in the match, said after fourth day's play.""Hopefully, we will try and save the Test match. So that, at least, I know even if we aren't winning the series at least, we are able to draw the match, which is going to be a win-win situation for us.""Jadeja, who turns 37 in a few weeks, said a defeat will still help the younger players in the squad learn. India’s XI includes several players early in their Test careers — Yashasvi Jaiswal, Sai Sudharsan, Nitish Kumar Reddy, Dhruv Jurel and Washington Sundar.""Look, the youngsters in the team, I think, they are in a learning phase. Their careers are starting. So, in international cricket, no matter what format you play, it's not easy.No matter what format you play, it's always a bit challenging.""He said the inexperience of young players attracts more attention when the team loses at home.""So, in India, when a situation like this happens, and you play 3-4 youngsters in the team, it feels like the whole team is young and inexperienced. And that gets highlighted. But, when India wins in home condition, people think that it's not a big deal. But, if you lose a series in India, it becomes a very big deal,"" the all-rounder said.""For a youngster, it's a learning phase. If they handle this situation well, they will mature as players. And, India's future will be better.""Jadeja said India got the tough end of the conditions after batting first.""See, honestly, as a bowler, when we were bowling for the first two days, there were no marks on the wicket. The wicket was shining like a mirror. And, when they (South Africa) came to bowl, because of the wicket taken by the fast bowler, the spinners came into play more. And, their ball was turning and bouncing,"" he said.He added that once India conceded a 288-run first-innings lead, South Africa’s batters played without pressure.""So, as I said, the situation matters a lot in cricket. If it were the other way around, if we were 300 runs ahead and they came to bat, then it's possible that we would have won by a large margin.""Jadeja said the batters need to ignore the first four days and focus only on the final day.""For us, tomorrow will be very important as a batting unit that we keep ourselves in a positive frame of mind and try to play the whole day.""","India are on the verge of losing the two-Test series, with a target of 549 to chase on the final day.

'As good as a win': Ravindra Jadeja on India's plans after South Africa set mountain to climb ahead of Day 5

Poll Do you think Shukri Conrad's use of the word 'grovel' was appropriate in the context of sportsmanship? Yes, it was just a competitive remark No, it was historically insensitive Unsure, need more context

NEW DELHI: South Africa head coach Shukri Conrad has ignited a fierce cricketing debate after using the word “grovel” while describing his team's Day 4 strategy during the Guwahati Test. The remark — made after South Africa set India a fourth-innings target of over 500 — has drawn sharp reactions from former India captain Anil Kumble and senior batter Cheteshwar Pujara , both of whom said they were stunned by the choice of words.Conrad, analysing South Africa's dominant position at stumps, said he wanted India to be pushed to the brink both physically and mentally. “We wanted India to spend as much time on their feet out in the field. We wanted them to really grovel, to steal a phrase, bat them completely out of the game and then say to them, well, come and survive on the last day and an hour this evening,” Shukri Conrad said after Day 4.The word immediately triggered outrage because of its charged historical context. “Grovel” was infamously used 50 years ago by England captain Tony Greig about the West Indies — a comment widely condemned and remembered as one of cricket's most offensive episodes.Kumble, one of India's most respected voices, said a team in South Africa's position should have shown restraint.“There's history attached to this. Fifty years ago, an England captain used the same phrase against the great West Indies side, and we all know what followed,” Kumble said on JioStar. “South Africa have most likely won the series, but when you're on top, your choice of words matters. Humility is most important at such times. I certainly didn't expect this from the coach or the support staff. When you're winning, the first thing is to stay humble, not say something like this at a press conference. ”Pujara, speaking ahead of the final day's play, suggested the comment might end up galvanising India instead of demoralising them.",South Africa head coach Shukri Conrad used the word 'grovel' while describing his team's Day 4 strategy during the Guwahati Test.

Smriti Mandhana's Father And Fiance Palash Muchhal Rushed To Hospital, Wedding Postpones!

NEW DELHI: Indian cricket star Smriti Mandhana and her family finally received a wave of relief after her father, Shrinivas Mandhana, was discharged from the hospital and declared stable. Shrinivas had been rushed to a Sangli hospital on Sunday after suffering severe chest pain, initially presumed to be a heart attack, leading to the abrupt postponement of Smriti’s wedding ceremony with fiancé Palash Muchhal According to an India TV report, hospital authorities confirmed that the senior Mandhana is “completely stable” and no longer in danger. An angiography was conducted as a precaution, but doctors found no blockages, easing concerns about his cardiac health. The reassuring medical update has brought much-needed comfort to the Mandhana household, though the family has not yet announced a revised wedding date.The wedding celebrations, underway in Sangli, came to a sudden halt after Shrinivas fell ill. Smriti’s business manager, Tuhin Mishra, had said the vice-captain made the decision herself to postpone the ceremony indefinitely. “Smriti is very close to her father. She decided that until her father gets well, this marriage… is indefinitely postponed,” Mishra had stated, highlighting the emotional weight of the situation.Physician Dr. Naman Shah had earlier clarified that Shrinivas was diagnosed with angina, not a heart attack. He had reported left-sided chest pain, with elevated cardiac enzyme levels and high blood pressure prompting immediate hospitalisation.In an unexpected twist, Smriti’s fiancé Palash Muchhal was also hospitalised shortly after the incident. Suffering from viral symptoms and acidity issues — likely induced by stress — Palash was treated in Sangli before being shifted to Mumbai for rest and further care. His condition, doctors reiterated, was not serious.The emotional strain has shown in other ways too. Smriti removed all wedding-related posts from her Instagram, including her proposal video, triggering speculation online. Close friends and teammates like Jemimah Rodrigues , Shreyanka Patil, and Radha Yadav also deleted related content.Palash’s mother, Amita Muchhal, revealed the depth of his attachment to Smriti’s father. “Palash is extremely close to him… when he fell ill, Palash immediately insisted the wedding be postponed,” she said.

'As good as a win': Ravindra Jadeja on India's plans after South Africa set mountain to climb ahead of Day 5

Former India wicketkeeper Parthiv Patel has taken strong exception to South Africa head coach Shukri Conrad’s controversial remark about making India “grovel” during the ongoing second Test in Guwahati. Conrad, speaking after stumps on Day 4 when asked why South Africa delayed their declaration, responded with a grin, saying: “We wanted the Indians to spend as much time on their feet as possible. We wanted them to really grovel, to stay out there, bat them completely out of the contest, and then challenge them to survive today evening and on the final day.”The choice of the word “grovel” instantly stirred debate. The term holds a notorious place in cricket history, dating back to England captain Tony Greig ’s infamous comment before the 1976 series against West Indies, where he declared he wanted to make the Caribbean side “grovel.” West Indies, deeply angered, responded by crushing England 3-0 in a five-Test series.Conrad’s usage has drawn swift reactions, with the host broadcaster even asking former India stars Anil Kumble , Parthiv Patel, Cheteshwar Pujara and Aakash Chopra for their views.Patel did not hold back. He suggested Conrad knew exactly what he was implying and pushed for an apology.“Maybe the South African coach isn’t aware of the historical weight of that word. But I doubt that. He even smirked while saying it. It was definitely disrespectful,” Patel remarked on Star Sports before play resumed on Wednesday. “As an Indian team, all you need to say is, ‘You’ve reached this position by playing good cricket. Fair enough. But using such language wasn’t required.’ I expect we will hear an apology from Conrad during the day. You can compete hard, but such comments have no place on a cricket field.”","Former India wicketkeeper Parthiv Patel has taken strong exception to South Africa head coach Shukri Conrad’s controversial remark about making India “grovel” during the ongoing second Test in Guwahati.

Gautam Gambhir fiery press conference: On whitewash, Rishabh Pant shot, pitch and more

Venkatesh Prasad did not hold back on X

Poll Do you believe Gautam Gambhir should step down as head coach of the Indian Test team? Yes, it's time for a change No, he deserves more time

India’s crushing 408-run defeat to South Africa in the second Test in Guwahati has triggered a wave of anger and frustration across the cricketing community, with social media flooded by reactions from fans and former players.The loss, which is India’s biggest ever in terms of runs in Test cricket and one that completed a 2-0 series whitewash, has intensified scrutiny on head coach Gautam Gambhir and the direction of the Test team.Former India pacer Venkatesh Prasad was among the strongest voices of criticism.Reflecting the growing public sentiment, he wrote on X, “Really disappointed by how India is going about in Test cricket. The all-rounder obsession is absolute brain-fade especially when you don’t bowl them. Rank poor tactics, poor skills, poor body language and an unprecedented 2 series white wash at home. Hope this does not get washed off with Test matches 9 months away and this negative approach changes.""But that was not the end of it. In a thread of tweets, the former cricketer added, ""Need to play specialists and players need to be picked on the basis of Ranji, Duleep Trophy in domestic cricket. Can pick in 50 overs based on IPL performance, but for Test cricket, Ranji and Duleep trophy have to be the barometer.Yash Rathod, Shubham Sharma, Baba Indrajith, Smaran Ravichandran are names most wouldn’t have heard of as they don’t play IPL but consistently scoring runs in domestic cricket. ""Furthermore, he maintained a stern position toward the team's insistence on all-rounders and that side has been trying to prove a strategy that has been 'flawed' from the very start.""Can’t play sub 40 FC avg players in the Test team based on IPL performances. Playing all-rounder in Indian conditions because he can bat is not the correct approach in Test cricket. Test cricket needs specialists. We all love Indian cricket and it’s sad to see what’s happening over the last year and a half just to somehow prove this flawed strategy right. Can’t function on such egos in the interest of Indian cricket. Truly disappointing,"" he wrote in a lengthy rant on X.Afterwards, another tweet ruled out the team being in a 'transitional phase' as a valid excuse for their struggles.He wrote, ""We cannot hide under the garb of transition. Barring Sudarshan, Jurel and Reddy, most of the guys have been around for 7–8 years. Some very experienced campaigners. This is a series of tactical errors, obsession with playing all-rounders and not wanting to learn from mistakes. Embarrassing.”His comments resonated widely, echoing concerns over muddled strategies and a team struggling to find stability.Gambhir, addressing the media after the defeat, accepted full responsibility while emphasising that his future lies in the hands of the BCCI. “It is up to the BCCI to decide my future. But I am the same guy who got you results in England and was coach for Champions Trophy,” he said, reminding critics of recent successes under his tenure.As India reels from the latest setback, the conversation is now dominated by questions of strategy, accountability, and the immediate future of the Test team, and more importantly, of its head coach.",Venkatesh Prasad has come down hard on Team India's struggles in Tests.

MUMBAI: After the historic 2025 ODI World Cup win by the Indian women’s team on Nov, the excitement for the upcoming Women's Premier League season 4 -likely to be held from Jan 7 to Feb 3 in Navi Mumbai and Vadodara (a final decision will be taken by the WPL Governing Council in its meeting in Delhi today) is slowly building up.However, player injuries remain a definite headache for the five WPL franchises, hurting their plans for the WPL player auction in Delhi on Thursday and the season ahead. During the recently-held World Cup, opener Pratika Rawal, who forged a successful opening partnership with India’s vice-captain Smriti Mandhana , was sidelined due to a hairline fracture in the ankle as he fell awkwardly while fielding in India's last league game against Bangladesh at the DY Patil Stadium, forcing dashing opener Shafali Verma to be included as her last-minute replacement for the semifinal and final of the tournament.Opener Yastika Bhatia had to miss the tournament as she picked up an injury (hurt her left knee) at the pre-World Cup camp in Vizag.Women’s cricket has seen remarkable improvement in recent years, thanks to BCCI’s efforts towards it and the introduction of the Women’s Premier League (WPL) in early 2023. Playing alongside world-class players in WPL teams has helped India's women cricketers gain exposure and awareness about fitness and nutrition.Yet, injuries continue to cast a shadow over many talented Indian players' careers.As franchises make last-minute preparations for the WPL auction, the fitness of certain Indian and overseas players will be a critical factor in their buying decisions. “Many of the Indian players have struggled with recurring injuries, raising concerns about their long-term career,” said a franchise official.The franchises feel that the BCCI may need to implement a structured rehabilitation and fitness program to ensure that India’s players can sustain peak performance and longevity. “With the WPL becoming a marquee event, player fitness is no longer just an individual concern—it’s a strategic priority for franchises and the BCCI. A comprehensive injury management program could be the difference between short-lived careers and sustained excellence in women’s cricket,” a franchise official felt.TOI takes a look at the players under the injury scanner for WPL-4…A promising 22-year-old pace bowling all-rounder whose fitness has been a major concern. Bought by Gujarat Giants for a record ₹2 crore in Season 2 with much fanfare, Kashvee missed the entire season due to injury. Though she featured in Season 3, her performance indicated she wasn’t fully fit. Post-season, she suffered a similar injury and is currently undergoing rehab at the BCCI's Centre of Excellence in Bengaluru. Her return to full fitness remains uncertain.The young leg-spinner showed great potential but suffered a shin injury that has kept her out of action. While she attended World Cup practice sessions, her fitness and fielding remain areas of concern. Her comeback timeline is unclear.A key contributor to India's successful World Cup campaign in the league stage, Pratika, who has displayed amazing consistency in the ODI since her debut against West Indies at Vadodara in Dec last year, missed the semifinals and final due to a fractured ankle, suffered while she feel awkwardly while fielding in the deep in India's last league match against Bangladesh at the DY Patil Stadium in Navi Mumbai. Pratika, who went unsold in WPL-2025 is likely to miss the WPL season due to her injury.A key all-rounder for India and the Mumbai Indians in the WPL in the past, Vastrakar has had a history of injuries, including knee and hamstring issues. While she missed WPL-2025 due to injury, the 26-year-old pacer played a crucial role in MI's title triumph in the inaugural season in 2023. The pacer is currently undergoing rehab at the BCCI’s CoE in Bengaluru.A top-order batter and wicketkeeper, Yastika was ruled out of the World cup after she suffered a knee injury in the pre-tournament camp at Vizag. Yastika eventually underwent a surgery in Mumbai. The 24-year-old left-handed opener is currently undergoing rehab at CoE.The 34-year-old Royal Challengers Bengaluru leg-spinner, who has played two WODIs and six WT20Is for India, has been dealing with recurring shoulder issues. The veteran tweaker has been out of action since the Women's T20 World Cup in UAE in Oct last year due to a knee injury. A key bowler for Royal Challengers Bengaluru, who was the tournament's second-highest wicket-taker (12 scalps) in Royal Challengers Bengaluru's WPL triumph in 2024, Asha missed WPL-2025 due to an injury. If Asha is fit again and available for the full season, she could be a hot buy for the teams.The vastly-experienced England pacer, who was overlooked for the World Cup, has had intermittent injuries, including a back injury during England's tour of South Africa last year . Her participation will depend on medical clearance by the England & Wales Cricket Board and her workload management. She was a part of the Northern Superchargers side that won The Women's Hundred crown and the Lancashire side which won the inaugural Metro Bank One Day Cup Women's title this summer.Known for her all-round abilities, Sophie has battled multiple injuries over the years, including shoulder and foot problems. Franchises will weigh her fitness before making big bids. Captain of the defending champions Melbourne Renegades in the Women's Big Bash League, the 27-year-old missed the start of the tournament due to a minor quad strain, though she has played three matches after her return to action.The Australian captain and star wicketkeeper suffered a calf injury during the World Cup, which forced her to miss her team's league stage wins over England and South Africa. She has also suffered from a bad finger injury in the past. The franchises are unsure about her fitness status for the WPL. Her experience and class makes her a valuable asset, but her fitness will be a key factor in determining whether the franchises will gun for her. There is a strong possibility that the UP Warriorz will try to buy her back through the Right-to-Match card.","Women's cricket has seen remarkable improvement in recent years, thanks to BCCI’s efforts towards it.

NEW DELHI: Indian men's Test team captain Shubman Gill has called for patience, perspective and unity after India suffered their heaviest-ever defeat in Test cricket, going down by 408 runs to South Africa in the second Test in Guwahati. The loss completed a 2-0 series sweep for the visitors and marked South Africa’s first Test series win on Indian soil in 25 years.Gill, recovering from a neck injury that forced him out of the match and the upcoming ODI series, addressed fans and teammates with a message of resolve on X.“Calm seas don’t teach you how to steer, it’s the storm that forges steady hands. We’ll continue to believe in each other, fight for each other, and move forward — rising stronger,” he wrote, offering reassurance at a time of pressure and scrutiny.Gill had flown with the squad to Guwahati despite his injury, with team management initially hoping he might recover in time for a late fitness call.However, after medical evaluation, he was deemed not match-ready and later traveled to Mumbai to consult specialist Dr. Dinshaw Pardiwala.He has now been ruled out of the three-match ODI series starting November 30 and is expected to be reassessed ahead of the T20Is beginning December 9.The defeat itself was emphatic. Chasing an improbable 549, India were bowled out for 140 on the final day. South African spinner Simon Harmer dismantled the batting lineup with career-best figures of 6-37, while Marco Jansen was named Player of the Match for his 93 with the bat and 6-48 in the first innings.Aiden Markram added nine catches, which was also the most by a fielder in a single Test. Ravindra Jadeja top-scored for India with 54, but resistance was limited and short-lived.With both Gill and vice-captain Shreyas Iyer unavailable, selectors now face decisions around temporary leadership and lineup recalibration for the ODIs. KL Rahul will lead the side in the ODI series.Gill’s message arrives at a tense moment for Indian cricket, following two home series clean sweeps - a 0-3 humbling to New Zealand in 2024 and now 0-2 to South Africa just a year later. Furthermore, it's not just the players that are under scrutiny, with head coach Gautam Gambhir also under the scanner as pressure mounts on him to deliver in the format.His call for composure signals leadership beyond the field, as India look to rebuild confidence and direction ahead of a demanding schedule.",South Africa beat India by 408 runs in the second Test in Guwahati.

NEW DELHI: India suffered their biggest defeat in terms of runs on Wednesday, losing the second Test in Guwahati to South Africa by 408 runs.

NEW DELHI: Team India’s latest humiliation at the hands of South Africa has laid bare the deepening cracks in India’s Test cricket structure under head coach Gautam Gambhir . The 408–run mauling in Guwahati — India’s biggest defeat by runs in their Test history — not only sealed a 0–2 series whitewash but amplified concerns over direction, selection, and clarity in the red-ball setup.The loss was India’s fifth defeat in their last seven home Tests, a staggering slide for a team that played the finals of the first two World Test Championship cycles and once prided itself on being unbeatable at home. The Guwahati debacle also marked South Africa’s first Test series win in India in 25 years, underlining just how precipitously India’s fortress has fallen.Under Gambhir, India’s Test journey has been turbulent, even chaotic. The team has featured constant chopping and changing, unstable batting positions, injured or retired stalwarts, and an over-reliance on all-rounders — all adding to a perception of muddled planning. India have now slipped to 10 defeats in 19 Tests under the former opener, and worryingly, their once iron-clad home record has eroded at an unprecedented pace.Of the four home series in the Gambhir era, India have claimed victories only against Bangladesh and West Indies — sides considered comparatively weak.Against stronger opponents, the slide has been dramatic: a 0–3 whitewash by New Zealand last year, followed by the 0–2 defeat to South Africa.India’s away form has been only slightly better, highlighted by a 2–2 draw in England with a young Shubman Gill-led squad after Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli retired. But that result stands as an outlier in a broader pattern of inconsistency and confusion.In all, Gambhir’s India have won only two of six Test series, a stark contrast to the stability and dominance that defined the previous decade. With questions now growing louder about selection strategy, temperament, and lack of clear vision, Indian Test cricket appears to be entering one of its most uncertain phases.","India's Test record under Gautam Gambhir: 7 wins, 10 losses, 2 draws.

'Complete thrashing at home'



India men's cricket team head coach Gautam Gambhir on Wednesday said that the Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ) will decide his future after the team was whitewashed 2-0 by South Africa in the Test series. He also pointed to the results India have achieved during his tenure.Gambhir spoke after India lost the second Test by 408 runs, which gave South Africa a 2-0 series win.""It is up to the BCCI to decide. I've said it in my first press conference when I took over as the head coach. Indian cricket is important, I'm not important. And I sit here and say exactly the same thing,"" Gambhir said at the press conference.""And yes, people can keep forgetting about it. I'm the same guy who got results in England as well, with a young team. And I'm sure you guys will forget very soon, because a lot of people keep talking about New Zealand (home series whitewash last year). And I'm the same guy who won the Champions Trophy , and Asia Cup as well,"" he added.Gambhir said he would not avoid responsibility for the result against South Africa.""The blame lies with everyone and starts with me,"" he said in his first comments after the 0-2 loss.After the defeat, IPL franchise Delhi Capitals' co-owner Parth Jindal said that India should appoint a specialist red-ball coach.""Not even close, what a complete thrashing at home! Don’t remember seeing our test side being so weak at home!!! This is what happens when red ball specialists are not picked,"" Jindal posted on X.He added, ""This team is nowhere near reflective of the deep strength we possess in the red ball format. Time for India to move to a specialist red ball coach for Test cricket.""India lost the second Test by 408 runs, their biggest defeat by runs, and South Africa secured their first Test series win in India in 25 years.Right now, Gambhir's Test record as a coach stands at a well under-par 7 wins, 10 defeats and 2 draws in 19 matches for win percentage of 36.82.","Gambhir spoke after India lost the second Test by 408 runs, which gave South Africa a 2-0 series win.

NEW DELHI: South Africa clinched a historic Test series win in India on Wednesday after defeating the hosts by 408 runs in the second Test in Guwahati. The margin marked India’s biggest defeat in terms of runs and gave South Africa their first series win in the country in 25 years.The loss also meant India were whitewashed at home for the second time in last 13 months, affecting their chances of reaching the World Test Championship final. Under head coach Gautam Gambhir, India have now lost five home Tests — three against New Zealand last year and two in this series.The key figure in South Africa’s series win was off-spinner Simon Harmer, whose performance became one of the defining factor of the series. ""It's been a long road, 10 years later back here and completely different feeling. I'm going to leave with fonder memories compared to the last time. Getting over the line as a team over this Indian team is a hell of an effort,"" Harmer, who won the Player of the Series awrd, said after the Guwahati Test.Harmer finished the two-match series with 17 wickets at an average of 8.94 and a strike rate of 28. Among bowlers who have taken at least 15 wickets in an away Test series after World War II, only Courtney Walsh has a better series average — 16 wickets at 8.25 in New Zealand in 1994-95.Harmer also became the South African bowler with the most Test wickets in India (27), surpassing Dale Steyn (26).India, set a target of 549, were expected to resist on the final day, but the batting unit fell without much fight on a pitch offering sharp bounce and turn. India were bowled out for 140 in 63.5 overs. Marco Jansen completed the win with a one-handed catch that ended the innings, capping a match in which he contributed with both bat and ball.South Africa, led by Temba Bavuma, secured a series victory that will remain significant for the team.

While the financial terms remain confidential under agreements with former rights-holder Sport 10, Brazilian media reports estimated the value around $18 million.Pelé—born Edson Arantes do Nascimento—remains one of football’s most celebrated figures in the sport, renowned for leading Brazil to World Cup triumphs in 1958, 1962, and 1970. He holds several records to date, with some of the most notable being the youngest to score in a FIFA World Cup final, and also the youngest to score a hat-trick in the competition.His influence extends far beyond the pitch, symbolising Brazilian creativity and excellence in global sport.Though he died in December 2022, his daughter Flavia attended the ceremony marking the transition.“There are no words to describe the emotion of bringing back a brand that embodies soul, humanity, and love,” she said, calling the moment both honouring and deeply personal.NR Sports characterised the acquisition as a “repatriation” of one of sport’s most important symbols, framing it as essential to preserving and expanding Pelé’s legacy for future generations.",Neymar Jr's family business has purchased Pele's brand rights.

Cristiano Ronaldo and Georgina Rodríguez have set the stage for what is expected to be one of the most high-profile weddings in recent years, with the couple reportedly choosing a venue that carries deep personal meaning for the Portugal captain. Instead of the grand international locations often associated with celebrity weddings, Ronaldo has opted to return to his roots in Madeira, selecting a site that reflects both history and identity.Portuguese outlets report that the ceremony is planned at Funchal Cathedral, widely recognised as the island’s oldest and most significant religious building. The structure, inaugurated in 1514 and built with local cedar wood, stands as a landmark of Madeira’s cultural heritage. It also sits just a short distance from the hospital where Ronaldo was born, adding a layer of symbolism to the decision.The connection between Ronaldo and his birthplace has remained evident throughout his career. Madeira’s international airport carries his name, and his museum — dedicated to his achievements — is located on the island. His early football steps with Nacional da Madeira unfolded not far from the cathedral selected for the ceremony.As per outlets in the country, the gathering is likely to be intimate in nature, though it will bring together guests linked to Ronaldo’s life in Portugal, Spain, Italy, Saudi Arabia and across the football world. Further details remain unconfirmed.It is also stated in a Jornal da Madeira report that Ronaldo and his fiancée will tie the knot in a Christian ceremony in the summer of 2026.Ronaldo and Georgina Rodríguez began their relationship in 2016 after meeting in Madrid, where she worked at a Gucci store during his time at Real Madrid. Over nine years, the couple have navigated different countries and stages of his career. They share two daughters, Alana and Bella, while raising Cristiano Jr, Mateo and Eva María together.As Ronaldo prepares for a demanding period with club and country — including a busy summer of international fixtures — Georgina continues to build her presence as an entrepreneur and media figure.For Madeira, the wedding marks another moment tied to one of its biggest icons. For Ronaldo, it reflects a return to the island that shaped his earliest years, setting the backdrop for a personal milestone that extends beyond football.",Cristiano Ronaldo and Georgina Rodríguez reportedly choose Funchal Cathedral as the venue for their wedding.

FIFA has unveiled the seeding pots and draw procedures for the 2026 World Cup — the first-ever 48-team edition — confirming a major structural change that will keep the world’s top four teams apart until the semi-finals. The announcement, made on Tuesday, sets the stage for a historic draw scheduled for December 5 in Washington DC.Under the new system, the four highest-ranked teams — Spain (No. 1), Argentina (No. 2), France (No. 3), and England (No. 4) — will be placed in two different halves of the knockout bracket, ensuring they cannot face each other before the last four if all win their groups. The move aims to maintain competitive balance and increase the chances of heavyweight clashes deep into the tournament.All four top-ranked teams have been placed in Pot 1, alongside co-hosts Canada, Mexico, and the United States, and other global giants including Brazil, Portugal, Netherlands, Belgium, and Germany, who narrowly held on to a seeded spot.FIFA confirmed that the draw will start with the 12 teams in Pot 1 before proceeding sequentially through Pots 2, 3, and 4.The expanded format means the tournament will feature 12 groups of four, with the top two from each group — plus the eight best third-placed teams — progressing to a new 32-team knockout stage.Six places remain unfilled, with 18 teams still battling in the March play-offs. Among them is four-time world champion Italy, currently in the playoffs and facing the possibility of landing in Pot 4 despite being ranked 12th in the world.The expanded draw also features several debutant nations. Uzbekistan headline Pot 3, while Jordan, Cape Verde, and Curaçao sit in Pot 4 along with potential playoff winners.With the biggest World Cup in history just over a year away, the December 5 draw promises the first real glimpse of football’s new global era.","FIFA has unveiled the seeding pots and draw procedures for the 2026 World Cup.

Estevão’s solo brilliance lifts Chelsea to dominant win over 10-man Barcelona,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/estevos-solo-brilliance-lifts-chelsea-to-dominant-win-over-10-man-barcelona/articleshow/125577093.cms,"Chelsea's Estevao, second right, celebrates with his teammates (Bradley Collyer/PA via AP)

A night marked by wholesale rotations, defensive mistakes and a moment of teenage brilliance saw both Manchester City and Barcelona fall to damaging Champions League defeats on Tuesday. While 18-year-old Estevão lit up Stamford Bridge with a stunning solo effort, lapses at the back hurt both European heavyweights.Pep Guardiola’s 100th Champions League match in charge of City turned sour as Bayer Leverkusen punished a heavily changed side with a 2-0 win. Guardiola rested almost his entire starting XI from the weekend loss to Newcastle, including Erling Haaland, but the reshuffle backfired. Alejandro Grimaldo put Leverkusen ahead in the 23rd minute with a precise low finish, before Patrik Schick doubled the lead with a well-placed header in the 54th.“It feels wonderful and we gave everything till the last second,” Schick told DAZN.Barcelona’s night was even more chaotic. Chelsea cruised to a 3-0 victory at Stamford Bridge, helped by Jules Koundé steering the ball into his own net after a defensive mix-up in the 27th minute. Things worsened when Ronald Araújo collected a second yellow just before half-time for a reckless challenge on Marc Cucurella.Chelsea took full advantage. Estevão shrugged off two defenders to score a superb solo goal in the 55th, and Liam Delap added a third from close range in the 73rd.Barcelona have now lost four of their last 10 matches across competitions, leaving coach Hansi Flick under mounting scrutiny.The results left the top end of the table unchanged. A City win would have pushed them higher, but Wednesday’s fixtures featuring Bayern Munich, Arsenal and Inter Milan will now shape the standings. Borussia Dortmund climbed to fourth, Chelsea moved into fifth, and both clubs sit level with City on 10 points. Barcelona slid to 15th, while Juventus rose to 21 points as their revival continued.There was better news for José Mourinho, who finally secured his first Champions League victory with Benfica. Samuel Dahl smashed in a sixth-minute volley and Leandro Barreiro sealed a 2-0 win at Ajax, who remain winless after five games and have managed just one victory in their last 10 overall.Elsewhere, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang struck twice in four minutes to lead Marseille to a 2-1 comeback win over Newcastle. Dortmund snapped a three-game winless stretch with a commanding 4-0 victory over 10-man Villarreal, powered by a brace from Serhou Guirassy.Juventus edged Bodo/Glimt 3-2 in the Arctic Circle, needing a stoppage-time finish from Jonathan David after the hosts equalised late. Substitute Kenan Yildiz was involved in all three goals.Union Saint-Gilloise edged Galatasaray 1-0 through Promise David, with the Turkish side missing injured top scorer Victor Osimhen and ending the match with 10 men after youngster Arda Ünyay was dismissed.Scott McTominay continued his scoring run by netting the opener in Napoli’s 2-0 win over Qarabag. Qarabag’s Kevin Medina was briefly knocked unconscious after being struck by another McTominay effort but was later replaced. Napoli supporters also marked the fifth anniversary of Diego Maradona’s passing.Finally, Athletic Bilbao’s goalless draw with Slavia Prague kept both teams outside the qualification spots with five matches played.","Pep Guardiola's 100th Champions League match in charge of City turned sour as Bayer Leverkusen punished a heavily changed side with a 2-0 win.

Right structure required to take Indian football forward: Ireland coach Heimir Hallgrimsson,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/right-structure-required-to-take-indian-football-forward-ireland-coach-heimir-hallgrimsson/articleshow/125569892.cms,"Heimir Hallgrimsson

CHENNAI: Indian football is at an all-time low. The top-tier leagues are yet to kick off for the season, and the players have no option but to plead to the national federation, at a time when they must be putting on a show on the pitch.In a period when much ink has been spilt on the country’s football ecosystem, Republic of Ireland head coach Heimir Hallgrimsson stressed that a structure must be built to reap rewards in the future. Hallgrimsson, who recently guided Ireland to the World Cup playoffs, has a fair idea of Indian football, considering his association with Sports For Life (SFL), a platform for grassroots sports development.“Football is not a new sport in India, but there is not much experience that one can tap into. Obviously, a football culture is not there. So, people in charge may not have been in the game or played the game at an elite level. We, as coaches, can only teach what we know. That is a weakness which needs to be assessed,” Hallgrimsson, the global ambassador and football mentor for the SFL, told TOI during a virtual interaction.While there is a feeling of doom and gloom in Indian football, Hallgrimsson remarked that it is not impossible for the country to create a superstar if a structure is put in place.“In India, football is growing really fast, like everywhere else in the world. If it (work) is done properly, the next big one can come from India. If there is a good structure, it is kind of unlikely that there will be no big football players from India. I do not know when, but it will happen at some point of time. If we start early, we may have a big name in the game in 10 to 12 years,” added Hallgrimsson, a former Iceland and Jamaica coach.Talking about his work at the SFL, Hallgrimsson said: “I like the project. I have a really broad spectrum of coaching; I have done a lot of seminars for coaches in Iceland. So, I am trying to help the SFL and ensure that they do not take the wrong step like many have done.”",Heimir Hallgrimsson says Indian football needs a structure to reap rewards in the future.

FIFA Fever: Fans Go WILD As Scotland Qualifies For Dramatic World Cup Return After 28 Years

Lee Bowyer vs Kieron Dyer (Newcastle, 2005)

Ricardo Fuller vs Andy Griffin (Stoke City, 2008)

Everton midfielder Idrissa Gueye entered an unwanted chapter of Premier League history on Monday, becoming part of only the third incident in which a player has been sent off for an offence against his own teammate — with four players now shown red cards across these rare flashpoints. The bizarre moment unfolded during Everton’s 1–0 win over Manchester United at Old Trafford, overshadowing the result and sparking widespread debate across football circles.The flashpoint came in the 13th minute with the score at 0–0. Moments after Gueye lost possession inside his own box — leading to a Bruno Fernandes effort — the midfielder and defender Michael Keane got into a heated argument. As the two confronted each other face-to-face, Keane appeared to shove Gueye, prompting the Senegal international to retaliate with a left-handed slap to his teammate’s face.Referee Tony Harrington immediately issued a straight red card, a decision later confirmed by VAR, which deemed the action a “clear strike to the face.” Everton goalkeeper Jordan Pickford and teammate Iliman Ndiaye quickly stepped in to separate the players.Gueye’s dismissal puts him in rare company — only two other incidents in Premier League history have seen players sent off for striking their own teammate.In one of the Premier League’s most infamous meltdowns, Bowyer and Dyer fought each other during Newcastle’s 3–0 defeat to Aston Villa. Both players were sent off, with Dyer handed a three-match ban and Bowyer suspended for seven games.With Stoke leading West Ham 1–0, Fuller slapped captain Andy Griffin after blaming him for an equaliser. He was immediately dismissed, and the incident derailed Stoke’s momentum as West Ham went on to score a late winner.Gueye’s red card, though unprecedented in Everton’s modern history, now joins those notorious moments.",Everton midfielder Idrissa Gueye was sent off against Manchester United.

Everton secured a 1-0 victory against Manchester United at Old Trafford on Monday in a Premier League match marked by Everton's Idrissa Gueye receiving a red card for striking his teammate Michael Keane. Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall's 29th-minute goal proved decisive, as the 10-man Everton team successfully defended their lead despite United's dominant second-half performance.The match took an unexpected turn in the 13th minute when Gueye, frustrated with Keane's apparent failure to receive his pass inside the Everton penalty box, confronted his teammate. After Bruno Fernandes missed a shot, Keane shoved Gueye, who responded by slapping Keane's face, resulting in referee Tony Harrington showing a red card for violent conduct.""The referee's call of red card to Gueye for violent conduct was checked and confirmed by VAR — with the action deemed to be a clear strike to the face of Keane,"" the league announced on social media.Gueye became the first Premier League player to be sent off for fighting with a teammate since Stoke City's Ricardo Fuller clashed with Andy Griffin in 2008.""I think it was just a moment of madness,"" Dewsbury-Hall said. ""It was avoidable but Idrissa has apologized to us all at full-time and said his piece. We move on from it. The reaction from the lads after that is unbelievable. We could easily have crumbled and lost the game comfortably and if anything it made us grow as a team.""Gueye later apologized on Instagram: ""What happened does not reflect who I am or the values I stand for. Emotions can run high, but nothing justifies such behavior. I'll make sure it never happens again.""""They were the better team, with 11 players or 10,"" United coach Ruben Amorim admitted. ""I felt from the first minute that we were not there with the same intensity so they deserve the win. If they have 10, let's push the opponent to the final third. We need to be near on the transition. We needed to be focused. We need to do more.""Despite being down to 10 men, Everton took the lead through Dewsbury-Hall's impressive 18-meter strike. Manchester United dominated the remainder of the match with 25 shots on goal compared to Everton's three.""I will sleep well tonight,"" Dewsbury-Hall said. ""I am so thankful we got the three points.""The victory marked David Moyes' first win as a visiting coach at Old Trafford in the Premier League after 18 unsuccessful attempts.""I'm incredibly proud of the players and the fans,"" Moyes said. ""We got over the line with 10 men. We started the ball brilliantly well, got the sending off, the game changed. But we showed resilience. Manchester United are in pretty good form at the moment, so it was never going to be an easy game. Good goalkeeping when we needed it. The boys were brave.""The result ended United's unbeaten run, marking their first defeat since a 3-1 loss to Brentford almost two months ago.

Colorado Football Weekly Press Conference

Deion Sanders is proud of his son, Shedeur Sanders, following his first NFL win as a starting quarterback



The night Shedeur Sanders walked onto the field as the Cleveland Browns’ starting quarterback, something quietly shifted. It was not just a rookie’s first NFL win. It was a father watching from afar, not as a coach, but as a dad seeing his son step into his own. Deion Sanders felt every moment of it, not through a headset or a game plan, but through pride, nerves, and a heart full of gratitude. The Browns’ 24 to 10 victory over the Las Vegas Raiders was a defining moment for Shedeur. And for Deion, it was a rare chance to simply watch his son compete without guiding every snap.“I’ve never seen him play without me coaching him, so that was strange,” the former NFL and MLB star admitted. “But it was good, and it was healthy, because I was just in straight dad mode. I wasn’t in coach mode and I loved that I was able to see him gain the first victory.”After the game, Deion spoke to Shedeur with a tone only a father could carry: “You played good. You gotta just look at the film and evaluate yourself on what went wrong. You did good, though. I’m proud of you. You’re holding it down for the family.” It was part encouragement, part accountability, and entirely love.Shedeur, just 23, reflected that stability right back. “Dad’s always going to be there,” he told CBS Sports. “Even if everything goes wrong, he’s always going to be there. I’m just thankful that I have both my parents in my life and I have my whole family. That’s what life is about: family.”He began the season as a third-string quarterback and waited for his chance while others played ahead of him. When the moment came, he responded with grace and grit. “The fact that I got an opportunity, and I was able to show the organization, show everybody who I really am, it's truly exciting. A lot of people wanted to see me fail, and it ain't going to happen. It ain't going to happen.”Deion, now a cancer survivor, looked on with profound thanks. “I’m truly thankful that god is so good. God is so good, you have no idea.”Now the Browns have named Shedeur their starting quarterback heading into their home game against the San Francisco 49ers. The story is no longer about what he might become. It is now about what he is becoming, one game at a time.Also Read: Cowboys star George Pickens deletes shocking Brittany Mahomes post, igniting explosive drama before Thanksgiving showdown","Deion Sanders is proud of his son, Shedeur Sanders, following his first NFL win as a starting quarterback for the Cleveland Browns.

Taylor Swift Reveals Favorite Track, Talks Travis Kelce And New Album “The Life Of A Showgirl”

Jerry Jones fuels theory Taylor Swift might attend Thanksgiving Cowboys game





The spotlight around the Dallas Cowboys is never accidental. It is shaped, pushed, and polished by Jerry Jones, who has long understood that attention itself is a currency. For decades, he has treated visibility as value. Under his stewardship, the Cowboys are valued at $13 billion, the highest in American sports. Jones has not brought home a Super Bowl in nearly thirty years, yet as a businessman and promoter of the brand, his track record is hard to challenge. Now, with Travis Kelce and the Chiefs arriving in Dallas for Thanksgiving, Jones sees another opportunity to amplify interest, fueled by a force outside football.Whatever you might think about the Cowboys‘ Jerry Jones as constructor of rosters, a negotiator of player contracts and a leader of a football team, there is not much cause to question his acumen as a marketer of his business. He has been forthcoming about how much he enjoys having the Cowboys in the spotlight–good or bad–because he sees all publicity as generating value for the franchise.From his perspective, whether or not he knows the lyrics to “Karma” or “The Fate of Ophelia,” Jones recognizes Swift’s cultural reach. On the eve of Kelce’s highly anticipated Thanksgiving game in Dallas, Jones openly acknowledged the outsized impact she has had on the league.He emphasized that if she decides to attend, the Cowboys will be prepared. “I don’t want to do anything to jump the gun, but we would have an elaborate seat for her if she should attend the game,” Jones said in chatting with 105.3 The Fan in Dallas this week. “Nobody’s a bigger fan of Taylor Swift than I am. But more importantly, we all are. I appreciate, buying through her Kansas City connection there, the kind of interest that she has and that she has brought to the NFL . I can’t get enough Taylor Swift.”The possibility of Swift showing up, even with no confirmation, is enough to push intrigue into overdrive. Jones himself expects massive viewership, explaining, “There could be as many as 70-80 million people watching, we’ll see what they measure, still. That kind of audience is out there.” However, having known the pattern of Swift's game presence, it is very unlikely that she will attend Thanksgiving match.Jones has always been unapologetic about his promotional instincts. “I spent a lot of time getting these Cowboys out,” he said. “I’ll put the Cowboys in a poodle magazine. I will put them in any house organ out there.” For him, Thanksgiving offers not just a football game, but millions of casual viewers ready to be captivated.Also Read: Cowboys star George Pickens deletes shocking Brittany Mahomes post, igniting explosive drama before Thanksgiving showdown","Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones has teased that Taylor Swift might attend Thanksgiving game.

Brittany Mahomes thrust into the spotlight after Cowboys receiver Pickens allegedly posts and deletes mysterious message



The social media storm hit fast without any warning. Within hours of the high tension Thanksgiving matchup between the Dallas Cowboys and the Kansas City Chiefs, George Pickens found himself at the center of controversy. A since deleted Instagram story, allegedly featuring a picture of Brittany Mahomes with the caption, “We feast Tomorrow!”, ignited conversation across X and gave fans plenty to talk about. The screenshot spread everywhere, and even though the original post vanished, the reaction did not. As of now, neither Pickens nor the Chiefs organisation has publicly confirmed or denied the authenticity of the story, leaving the incident hanging over the game like a cloud.This Thanksgiving matchup was already promising drama. Cowboys versus Chiefs attracts national attention on its own, especially with both teams still grinding to secure their playoff momentum. Now, the game’s tension stretched beyond football. The image of Brittany Mahomes, wife of Chiefs superstar quarterback Patrick Mahomes, turned into unexpected bulletin board material. Many fans argued that poking at Mahomes through his wife might be a dangerous gamble.Mahomes has made a habit of turning perceived disrespect into fuel.When that screenshot hit X, people reacted instantly. Some found it hilarious, some thought it brutal, and many believed Pickens crossed a line. The Cowboys receiver already carries a reputation for bold and fiery energy on the field. Still, using an opposing player’s spouse struck critics as unusually bold. Considering what is at stake, the timing could not be more volatile. Dallas certainly does not want to provoke a quarterback who already owns three Super Bowl rings.Add to this that AT&T Stadium in Arlington is set to be packed with energy, celebrities, and sports storylines colliding at once. Cowboys owner Jerry Jones reportedly extended an invitation to Taylor Swift, which only added another layer of eyes to the event. And Brittany Mahomes is a regular at Patrick’s games, so her appearance on Thanksgiving night could make things uncomfortably personal.Pickens himself is far from a fringe player. At only 24, he is putting up a standout season with 67 catches, 1054 yards and eight touchdowns. Even while battling calf and knee issues, he is expected to take the field. After all this chaos, he will have to deliver. Because in a game this emotional, this public, and this personal, fans will remember every snap.Also Read: New footage exposes the heartbreaking final chase of Marshawn Kneeland before his tragic death","George Pickens allegedly posted a picture of Brittany Mahomes with the caption, ""We feast Tomorrow!""

Marshawn Kneeland’s Final Hours: Cowboys Rookie’s Sudden Death Shocks NFL World | WATCH

The troubling escalation, the frantic search, and the final realization





Dallas Cowboys fans are still stunned by the heartbreaking loss of 24-year-old running back Marshawn Kneeland, whose death followed a high-speed police pursuit in suburban Dallas. The tragedy has gone far beyond a headline, it has torn into the emotional core of his teammates, coaches, and especially those closest to him.As newly released dashcam and bodycam footage provides a fuller view of the incident, what emerges is not merely the story of a police chase, it is the portrait of a young man spiraling through what appears to have been an intense mental and emotional crisis. This wasn’t simply reckless driving. It was a night soaked in fear, desperation, miscommunication, and ultimately irreversible tragedy.Authorities attempted a traffic stop just after 10:30 PM when Kneeland’s Dodge Charger accelerated to speeds reportedly reaching 145–160 mph. The footage doesn’t show a criminal fleeing, it shows a terrified man running from something internal rather than external.After crashing near an office park in Frisco, he fled on foot, prompting a massive ground search.Officers swept through wooded areas and drainage tunnels, even deploying K-9 units. One officer’s warning was chilling: ""Frisco K-9. If you're in this tunnel, I'm going to send my dog in here. He is going to bite you. This is your last opportunity.""The abandoned car, with an empty holster inside, added to police fears, but what they didn’t yet know was the emotional panic surrounding Kneeland’s final messages. His pregnant girlfriend, Catalina Mancera, initially withheld his location, telling officers: “He's going to kill himself. I can't tell you where he's at.” That anguished line reveals the deeper truth: this was a mental-health emergency long before it became a law-enforcement incident.Later, Mancera publicly mourned him, writing on Facebook: “My sweet boy is really gone… But now I have you to watch over me and wait for me on the other side. I will see you again.”The Cowboys have since established a memorial fund supporting Mancera and their unborn child, turning grief into action. This tragic story now stands as a painful reminder: NFL players may wear armor on Sundays, but some battles, internal, silent, overwhelming, remain unseen until it’s too late.Also Read: Fresh insights surface on Marshawn Kneeland’s tragic death amid former Cowboys DE’s personal update","Dallas Cowboys' Marshawn Kneeland, 24, died following a high-speed police chase.

Star sided with Nicki Minaj, criticizing Cardi's relationship choices amid Diggs' sexual assault allegations. This online drama highlights celebrity loyalty and the rapid spread of private disputes in the digital age, with Diggs' situation unlikely to cool down soon.

Cardi B Debuts Newborn Son in Patriots Gear as She and Stefon Diggs Melt the Internet

What Jeffree Star said and how it escalated the conversation around Stefon Diggs

For weeks, tensions in the rap and celebrity space have been building, but things erupted when Jeffree Star publicly claimed that Cardi B ’s baby daddy, NFL wide receiver Stefon Diggs , slid into his DMs. The makeup mogul didn’t simply stir gossip, he deliberately injected himself into the Cardi-Nicki feud by siding with Minaj and calling out Cardi’s personal life in a very targeted way.The timing made it even more impactful: this came as Diggs faces disturbing sexual assault allegations from influencer Chris Griffith. With fan camps battling and timelines blowing up, Star’s comments didn’t just spark attention, they deepened existing fault lines and set off a new round of online mayhem.During a recent live stream, Star responded to fans who warned that Cardi B might retaliate by claiming, “Y’all said Cardi B’s gonna come for me. Bitch, her baby daddy was in my DMs. I’m not worried about that.”It was an aimed strike at Cardi’s image as well as Diggs’ reputation, especially at a moment when the football star is already under scrutiny. Star pushed further, remarking, “You stayed with the man that embarrassed you in front of the world. Who’s the fool? Next. Please.”He doubled down by praising Nicki Minaj , stating that she “dog-walked her in every single aspect” and declaring, “Nicki will always be the queen.”Meanwhile, speculation online grew as Star added, “When your ex is in my DMs, sit on it,” which many fans linked directly to Diggs amid circulating gay rumors and ongoing accusations from Griffith.While Diggs has denied the allegations and filed a defamation suit calling the claims “pure fiction,” the cultural impact of this moment goes beyond the legal case. It exposes a layered intersection of celebrity loyalty, public persona, reputation defense, and how quickly social media can turn private disputes into national talking points.This controversy isn’t just celebrity noise, it reflects the shifting nature of fame in the digital era, where TikTok streams can rival courtroom statements, and where fan armies amplify narratives with real-world consequences. If the legal battle intensifies and the Cardi-Nicki cold war stays heated, the drama surrounding Stefon Diggs is unlikely to fade anytime soon.Also Read: Offset accused of plotting revenge on Stefon Diggs as IG model claims explosive leaked messages","Jeffree Star publicly claimed that Cardi B's baby daddy, NFL wide receiver Stefon Diggs, slid into his DMs. Star sided with Nicki Minaj, criticizing Cardi's relationship choices amid Diggs' sexual assault allegations.

Aaron Rodgers’ secret marriage mystery grows louder as even family admits they’ve never met his wife,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/aaron-rodgers-secret-marriage-mystery-grows-louder-as-even-family-admits-theyve-never-met-his-wife/articleshow/125588094.cms,"Aaron Rodgers has sparked a unique frenzy by keeping his marriage entirely private, a stark contrast to typical NFL WAG culture. Despite confirming his marriage, his wife remains unseen and unintroduced to family, teammates, or friends, creating a significant public mystery. This extreme secrecy is reshaping perceptions of celebrity relationships.

How Aaron Rodgers’ extreme privacy is reshaping public perception of celebrity relationships

Football legends are used to headlines, but Aaron Rodgers has created a truly unusual type of frenzy, one born not from performance, injury, or controversy, but from silence. In a league where spouses become part of the extended NFL family and WAG culture is as recognizable as the players themselves, Rodgers has built an impenetrable wall around his married life.The 41-year-old quarterback, now with the Pittsburgh Steelers, confirmed earlier this year that he tied the knot, but offered nothing more. Slowly, curiosity has turned into a cultural puzzle: Who is Mrs. Rodgers? And why has not a single person close to him seen or spoken to her? The intrigue is no longer just gossip, it's a phenomenon.Rodgers is no stranger to romance under the spotlight. His past relationships with Olivia Munn, Danica Patrick, and Shailene Woodley, were dissected in public, often overshadowing his football narrative. After those breakups, Rodgers seemed to adopt a new philosophy: emotional privacy as protection.On “The Pat McAfee Show,” he openly stated he was with someone named Brittani, calling her a “private person” and defending his secrecy, saying, “My private life is my private life and it’s going to stay that way.”That promise has been upheld to an extreme. Not only has Rodgers’ wife never been photographed, but family, teammates, and friends haven’t met her, leading one family member to say, “I get being secretive, but come on.”Another relative admitted, “I assume his wife exists, and I am looking forward to meeting her someday.”Even players’ wives who typically interact with partners’ spouses have never crossed paths with her. As one teammate’s wife put it: “She’s like a phantom… We haven’t met her yet. We don’t even know who she is.”Yet through the secrecy, Rodgers occasionally lets emotion slip through. In July, speaking to Sports Illustrated, he said: “I’ve got the most incredible wife. I just really love her and I’m so grateful to have her by my side.”Some believe Rodgers is creating unnecessary mystique; others see it as a heartfelt attempt to preserve something real in a world that devours personal privacy. Either way, Rodgers has changed the script, his wife may remain unseen, but she has become one of the most talked-about figures in sports culture precisely because of it.Also Read: Kylie Kelce reaches breaking point as leaked-number chaos explodes into mass DMs and sparks fan chaos","Aaron Rodgers has sparked a frenzy by keeping his marriage entirely private.

She recently attended events in Doha, showcasing her style and confidence. Bündchen appeared alongside her partner Joaquim Valente, highlighting a new chapter of unity. Her appearances signal a balanced continuation of her career and family life, demonstrating grace and empowerment.

Gisele Bündchen’s refined return to the red carpet and why it feels like a reset moment

Gisele Bündchen has a way of turning a simple public appearance into a statement of confidence, glamour, and personal evolution and her latest red carpet moment in Doha proved exactly that. Making her first public outing since welcoming her newest child in February, the Brazilian supermodel appeared radiant, grounded, and quietly empowered.Instead of retreating fully into the familiar cocoon of new motherhood, Bündchen chose to re-emerge in a way that balanced luxury with emotional authenticity. Her presence wasn’t just about fashion or status; it signaled a woman who honors both family life and her enduring career. And beside her, sometimes publicly, sometimes subtly, stood her partner Joaquim Valente, reflecting a new chapter defined by closeness and quiet unity.At the 2025 Franca Fund Gala in Qatar, Bündchen stunned in head-to-toe Chanel, a sheer black mesh gown and over 12 carats of diamonds, while Valente matched her effortlessly in a sharp black tux.The coordinated look wasn’t just aesthetic, it projected partnership, synchronicity, and shared presence.In one Instagram Story, she slipped in a behind-the-scenes moment, arm around Valente, tagging members of his family, signaling that this wasn’t just a date, it was a family moment.A day prior, she stepped out again at the Fashion Trust Arabia Awards, this time in metallic blues and silvers with golden accents, proof that even after a year of quieter living, she hasn’t lost her style authority.The couple, together since 2023, welcomed their baby in February, joining Bündchen’s two children, Benjamin and Vivian, from her previous marriage to Tom Brady. Back in May, she shared a rare snapshot with her new arrival on Mother’s Day, writing: “Sometimes, the most beautiful moments aren’t shared, they’re simply lived.” She continued, “Being a mother it’s been my greatest gift, a journey that humbles me, teaches me, and fills me with gratitude every single day. ”From the carefully chosen public glimpses to the heartfelt private reflections, Bündchen’s return feels less like a comeback and more like a gentler, wiser, beautifully balanced continuation.Also Read: Tom Brady’s new photos spark buzz as Vivian shows uncanny supermodel-style resemblance to her Gisele Bündchen","Supermodel Gisele Bündchen has returned to the spotlight after welcoming her new baby.

“Smear campaign against her”: Blake Lively refuses to engage with Taylor Swift as Travis Kelce ignores the drama,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/smear-campaign-against-her-blake-lively-refuses-to-engage-with-taylor-swift-as-travis-kelce-ignores-the-drama/articleshow/125587627.cms,"Hollywood's once-tight Blake Lively-Taylor Swift friendship appears strained, with Lively's recent social media silence fueling speculation. This distance is reportedly linked to Lively's legal battle with co-star Justin Baldoni, which inadvertently involved Swift. Insiders suggest Swift is working to rebuild trust, indicating a complex, human dynamic behind the public perception of a feud.

Blake Lively’s ICY SILENCE Sparks Feud Talk After Taylor Swift’s Engagement Reveal Goes Unanswered

Blake Lively’s latest move suggests the Taylor Swift friendship isn’t healing anytime soon

For years, Blake Lively and Taylor Swift were one of Hollywood’s most beloved celebrity friendships; playful, outspoken supporters of each other, and famously intertwined in each other’s public lives. That’s why fans reacted with genuine excitement on October 3, 2025, when Blake finally liked Taylor’s Instagram post about her album The Life of a Show Girl.It broke a long stretch of silence and made people hope the icy distance between them had finally begun to thaw. But just when fans thought the two were back on a path toward normalcy, Blake once again became notably absent from Taylor’s social media orbit, especially after Swift posted the trailer for her docuseries The End of an Era. Suddenly, the reconciliation narrative started feeling premature.The distance between them is intertwined with Blake’s legal battle against Justin Baldoni, her It Ends With Us co-star. In her lawsuit, Lively accused Baldoni of sexual harassment and “waging a smear campaign against her.” When Baldoni countersued, things escalated and Taylor Swift got pulled into the firestorm.Baldoni’s legal team claimed Lively had allegedly used her friendship with Swift as leverage during production, and even moved to subpoena the singer before ultimately withdrawing the request.Being dragged into a legal drama of that nature, unexpectedly and against her will, inevitably strained trust.Reports from People.com added context in June, noting that “Swift and Lively aren’t as close and haven’t been spending as much time together as they did in the past.” Another insider emphasized the emotional distance: “Taylor is working to trust Blake again but it’s going to take some time.”From the outside, the silence looks like avoidance. From the inside, it may be caution, especially with Swift recently engaged to Travis Kelce and aware that every association of hers instantly becomes a headline.Today, Blake’s quiet non-engagement with Taylor’s latest post doesn’t just speak to social media patterns; it hints at unresolved tension and emotional processing behind the scenes. The reality is less dramatic than “feud”, and more human: two friends navigating trust, hurt, and public scrutiny in real time, with the world watching closely and guessing loudly.Also Read: Taylor Swift’s Disney+ docuseries faces unexpected legal threat from Florida courtroom as Travis Kelce remains silent","Hollywood's once-tight Blake Lively-Taylor Swift friendship appears strained.

Frank Ragnow’s sudden return to the Detroit Lions has fans buzzing

“The Lions just got Christmas before Thanksgiving this year”

“Bro retired for five minutes and realized the Lions might actually make a run. Respect it”

Just when Detroit Lions fans thought one of their biggest stars was gone for good, Frank Ragnow is back! The four-time Pro Bowl center shocked everyone by announcing he’s coming out of retirement to rejoin the Lions.After stepping away earlier this year for family and health reasons, Ragnow’s return is sparking major excitement and a flood of fan reactions across social media. Lions fans are officially buzzing, and the timing couldn’t be more dramatic as the team eyes a strong finish this season.Ragnow initially retired in June 2025 after seven NFL seasons, citing health and family priorities. His departure left a big hole in the Lions’ offensive line, and fans were left wondering how Detroit would hold up without their All-Pro anchor. Fast forward to November, and Ragnow is reportedly “in shape and ready to roll,” according to insiders.Social media immediately exploded after news of his return. One fan tweeted,Another joked,Clearly, the excitement isn’t just about football, it’s about seeing a fan-favorite player back where he belongs.Ragnow isn’t just any player, he’s a four-time Pro Bowler and multiple-time All-Pro center. Losing him earlier this year left Detroit struggling with interior line consistency, impacting both run and pass protection. His return instantly strengthens the Lions’ offensive front and boosts team morale.Analysts note that having Ragnow back could be a turning point for Detroit’s playoff chances. “He stabilizes the line and gives the quarterback more time,” one insider told CBS Sports. With Ragnow’s skills and leadership, the Lions are suddenly a more formidable force.Of course, coming out of retirement isn’t without challenges. Ragnow has dealt with injuries in the past, and after several months off, it remains to be seen how quickly he’ll reach full game speed. Coaches will also need to readjust line combinations to get him back in sync with the team.Still, the excitement outweighs the uncertainties. Detroit now has its star center back, and even a partial return to form could shift momentum in the Lions’ favor.Also read - “She’s never beating the gold digger allegations”: Fans roast Kayla Nicole after saying she’s done with athletes and now eyeing team owners","Ragnow initially retired in June 2025 after seven NFL seasons, citing health and family priorities.

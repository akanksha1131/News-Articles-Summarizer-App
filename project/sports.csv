AHMEDABAD: With victories eluding them in their opening matches, both Gujarat Titans and Mumbai Indians will look to get their campaign up and running here on Saturday.Mumbai missed their regular captain, Hardik Pandya , in their opening game, since he was suspended for a slow over-rate offence incurred last season. With Pandya back at the stadium where he lifted the trophy in 2022, ironically with Titans, the clash adds another dynamic to the relationship he enjoys with the crowd here.Booed last time he took the field here, Pandya will be eager to showcase his captaincy credentials and win the fans back as his team looks to bounce back from last season’s 10th-place finish.The Titans, meanwhile, will be kicking themselves for failing to get over the line against Punjab Kings in their opening encounter. They had the chase under control but faltered under some good bowling by Vijaykumar Vyshak.Their bowling was shredded apart by the likes of Shreyas Iyer. Mohammed Siraj, Prasidh Krishna, Kagiso Rabada and leg-spinner Rashid Khan will be looking for an improved bowling performance.The fielding was also below average, with dropped catches and misfields helping the Kings' cause.Mumbai, no doubt, will be heavily boosted by Pandya’s return. Their batters failed to get going at Chepauk, undone by Khaleel Ahmed’s pace and the guile of left-arm wrist spinner Noor Ahmad.Mumbai’s batters — Rohit Sharma, Suryakumar Yadav, Tilak Varma, Pandya, Will Jacks and Ryan Rickleton — should enjoy the true bounce and placid nature of the wicket here.Pacers Trent Boult and Deepak Chahar will look to challenge Gill, Sai Sudharsan and Jos Buttler, while left-arm wrist spinner Vignesh Puthur will look to continue his fairytale run.","Mumbai missed their regular captain, Hardik Pandya, in their opening game, since he was suspended for a slow over-rate offence incurred last season.

Vyshak Vijaykumar reveals how Shreyas Iyer and Arshdeep Singh backed his 'wide yorkers' plan

NEW DELHI: In a thrilling IPL encounter, Shardul Thakur 's impressive four-wicket haul and Nicholas Pooran 's sensational display of power-hitting guided Lucknow Super Giants ( LSG ) to a five-wicket victory over Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) on Thursday.Thakur's dream comeback continued as he returned with figures of 4/34, helping LSG restrict the formidable SRH batting lineup to 190/9.Pooran then took center stage, showcasing his 360-degree hitting prowess with a blistering 70 off just 26 deliveries, including six fours and six maximums. His partnership with Mitchell Marsh (52 off 31) yielded a match-winning 116 runs for the second wicket, propelling LSG to chase down the target in just 16.1 overs.Despite losing Aiden Markram early in their chase, LSG surged ahead thanks to the effortless hitting from Marsh and Pooran. Pooran, in particular, was at his attacking best, dealing primarily in sixes and clobbering Simarjeet and Abhishek Sharma for massive hits, mostly towards the square boundary.SRH found it challenging to contain Pooran as he didn't even spare Cummins, hitting him for two fours in his first over to reach 77/1 in the powerplay. Pooran brought up the fastest fifty of the season in just 18 balls with another colossal six over square leg off Adam Zampa's bowling.Cummins eventually trapped Pooran in front of the wickets in the ninth over, but Marsh took the onus upon himself and brought up his half-century off just 29 balls. Although LSG skipper Rishabh Pant (15 off 15) couldn't contribute much, Abdul Samad played an entertaining cameo to guide his side home.Earlier, after opting to bowl first, Shardul (4/34) provided LSG with a fiery start, removing Abishek Sharma and the previous match's centurion, Ishan Kishan, in consecutive balls in the third over. While Shardul sent Sharma packing with a short delivery, he dismissed Kishan caught behind off an innocuous delivery down the leg side.Travis Head (47 off 28), however, looked in ominous form as he took the attack to the opposition, using his brute power to deal in boundaries and sixes. Head was particularly brutal against Avesh Khan, hitting him for two sixes and one four to pick up 18 runs in the fourth over.Head was fortunate to receive two reprieves, but his luck eventually ran out when fast bowler Prince Yadav disturbed his timbers to claim his first IPL wicket.Henrich Klaasen (26 off 17) was run out in a bizarre fashion by Yadav off his own bowling, while young Aniket Verma played a 13-ball 36-run cameo that included five sixes before falling to leg-spinner Disvesh Rathi.SRH skipper Pat Cummins (18 off 4) hit three sixes off his first three balls before departing in style, contributing to SRH's competitive total of 190/9.",Lucknow Super Giants ( LSG) beat Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) by five wickets. Shardul Thakur (4/34) and Nicholas Pooran (70) guided LSG to victory.

HYDERABAD: The talk ahead of the Sunrisers Hyderabad ’s (SRH) clash against Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) was about whether the hosts would scale Mount 300. The odds were stocked heavily against the visitors with their bowling unit in disarray. But when Rishabh Pant chose to bowl, it looked like he had plans in place for the hosts’ dangerous batting order. And his bowlers justified him.After being ignored at the death by captain Pant in his side’s one-wicket loss to Delhi Capitals in Visakhapatnam, 'Player of the Match' Shardul Thakur returned impressive figures of 4/34 to restrict Sunrisers Hyderabad to 190/9.The diminutive Nicholas Pooran then took charge. He showcased his big-hitting prowess with a 26-ball 70 (6x4, 6x6). He added 116 runs with Mitchell Marsh (52; 31b; 7x4, 2x6) that eventually sealed a five-wicket victory for LSG with 23 deliveries to spare.Though the visitors lost Aiden Markram (1) in Mohammed Shami’s first over, Pooran went berserk. He smashed Simarjeet Singh and Abhishek Sharma for two sixes, plundering 17 and 18 runs each. Marsh was not far behind as he smashed Shami for two sixes and the visitors raced to 77/1 in the first six overs.Pooran then hit Zampa for 19 runs with two sixes and a boundary in the seventh over to complete his halfcentury in 18 deliveries. The LSG No. 3 contributed 70 runs to the second-wicket partnership before he was trapped in front by Pat Cummins in the 9th over.Marsh reached his fifty in 29 balls (7x4, 2x6) but holed out to long-on off Cummins in the 11th over. But by then, the duo had reduced the target to 53 from 54 balls.Abdul Samad 22* (8b; 2x4, 2x6) and David Miller (13*) finished the game that was set up by the LSG bowlers.Thakur struck in his second over, dismissing Abhishek (6) and last-match centurion Kishan (0) off successive deliveries. Travis Head (47; 28b, 5x4, 3x6) hit the first six of the night in the fourth over off Avesh Khan and another over extra cover and a boundary for 18 runs as Avesh looked rusty in his first match since January.Head got two reprieves in Ravi Bishnoi’s first over. Pooran dropped a sitter at long-on with Head on 35. Two balls later, Bishnoi grassed a tough caught and bowled chance.","Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) beat Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) by five wickets.

GUWAHATI: With the current Indian Premier League (IPL) season witness to some high-scoring games in the opening week, Wednesday’s match at the ACA Stadium then looked like an aberration.The Barsapara track offered help for the tweakers as Kolkata Knight Riders spinners, Varun Chakravarthy and Moeen Ali , ran through hosts Rajasthan Royals’ middle order to choke the flow of runs to restrict them to 151.On the wicket, Ali said, “It was good one, had a bit of everything — swing, bit of seam, spun nicely but not massively, just enough spin. I played here in the England warmup games (ahead of 2023 ODI World Cup); it’s a very nice ground.”Ali added that it was good that the track offered something for the bowlers.“Some of the wickets are amazing. India is a great place to bat actually, and when the wickets are like this, you’re not going to get 300, you probably won’t even get 200. So it’s great to have these games in between those big ones,” said Ali.Ali combined well with Chakravarthy as the duo shared four wickets between them. The English allrounder had praise for his ‘mystery’ partner Chakravarthy.“I came on before him (seventh over), so my job was to bowl tight. I’m used to bowling with somebody who’s better and has more mystery. So I bowl as tight as I can and hopefully, that builds pressure for them to get wickets,” Ali said.“Varun’s a brilliant bowler who has improved so much over the last two-three years. It’s amazing to bowl with him.”",Kolkata Knight Riders restrict Rajasthan Royals to 151. Moeen Ali and Varun Chakravarthy take four wickets between them.

After serving a one-match suspension for an over-rate offence from Mumbai Indians ' (MI) concluding match of the 2024 Indian Premier League season, Hardik Pandya will be back to lead the five-time champions in their second match of this edition against Gujarat Titans in Ahmedabad on Saturday.Both MI and the 2022 champions Gujarat had lost their opening fixtures against Chennai Super Kings and Punjab Kings, respectively and are keen to put a win on the board for their first points.The MI squad utilised the extended break between their first and second matches by spending time at the Reliance facility in Jamnagar, where they participated in team-building exercises and relaxation activities.While the return of captain and all-rounder Hardik will come as a boost for MI, they will remain without the services of their premier fast bowler Jasprit Bumrah, who continues to recuperate from his back injury at the BCCI's Centre of Excellence on Bengaluru.Hardik's return to the playing eleven likely means Robin Minz's exclusion, although MI's batting performance on the tricky Chepauk pitch failed to generate confidence.The batting conditions in Ahmedabad on Saturday evening will prove more favourable, considering the substantial 475 runs scored in 40 overs during the first match of the season at the venue between Punjab Kings (243) and hosts Gujarat (232).But the batting-friendly surface at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad raises concerns about Mohammed Siraj's effectiveness, following his expensive spell of 54 runs in the previous match where Punjab batters dominated his bowling.With not many senior Indian pacers in the GT ranks, it will be a strategic call that home team head coach Ashish Nehra will fret upon. The pressure to contain runs as well as take wickets is way too much on Kagiso Rabada and Rashid Khan.Both the teams clearly had difficulties in finding the optimal blend of their overseas players.For MI, the challenges are further intensified due to Suryakumar Yadav's prolonged dip in performance over the past year, while Rohit Sharma also needs to rediscover his consistency.The addition of Pandya strengthens the batting lineup while offering bowling options, particularly at the start of the innings. His expertise in delivering wide yorkers during death overs.The Gujarat Titans' overall performance this season could heavily depend on captain Shubman Gill's batting form.The bowling department presents concerns for captain Gill, as the Indian pacers - Siraj, Prasidh Krishna and Ishant Sharma - predominantly employ similar hit-the-deck techniques. Apart from Rabada, the pace attack lacks variety in their bowling arsenal.","Hardik Pandya will lead Mumbai Indians against Gujarat Titans on Saturday.

CHENNAI: Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) have broken the Chepauk jinx, and how! When they last beat mighty neighbours Chennai Super Kings (CSK) at the MA Chidambaram Stadium, Rahul Dravid was still their captain. The only RCB player who was part of that 2008 squad and is still playing is Virat Kohli , and his face at the end of the 50-run rout said it all.At the other end of the spectrum were the shocked faces of those 34,000-odd CSK diehards, who are not exactly used to a humiliation of this magnitude in their own den. To add salt to CSK’s wounds, RCB had a forward short-leg and a slip in place in the 16th over when MS Dhoni finally came out to bat at No. 9.So many things must have felt so different for all those who have been turning up regularly at the Chepauk over the last 17 years. Adding to the list of ‘new’ was the ‘method’ in the RCB approach that had been missing from their game for so long.For years, an element of mindlessness had characterized their game, but on Friday night the RCB batters stuck to a plan and didn’t lose their heads.In a chase of 197, CSK lost two quick wickets to Josh Hazlewood early on and from there on, severely lacked the firepower to make a match of it. There was zero intent in the CSK approach and the defeat is an early reminder for them that old-school T20 cricket that they are still trying to recreate might have passed its sell-by date.This was their biggest-ever defeat at home. Before all that, RCB’s batters gave their bowlers a sound platform.With a batting lineup as deep as theirs, where Tim David comes at No. 7, the plan was to have at least one Indian batter who is good at playing spin at one end throughout the innings. While it was Virat Kohli (31 off 30 balls) in the beginning with Phil Salt (32 off 16) doing the heavy lifting, the back-end was left to skipper Rajat Patidar Given a life early on when Deepak Hooda dropped him at long-off, Patidar (51 off 32 balls) showed why he is so highly rated. There’s a natural elegance about his game. The right-hander plays spin with ease and there’s an ability to generate power.All these attributes were on display against a CSK attack that could have easily restricted a lesser batting lineup, but Patidar ensured that didn’t happen.",Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) beat Chennai Super Kings (CSK) by 50 runs. RCB last beat CSK at the MA Chidambaram Stadium in 2008. Rajat Patidar top scored for RCB with 51 off 32 balls.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119686625,imgsize-63128,width-400,resizemode-4/119686625.jpg"

Gujarat Titans Wins: 3

Mumbai Indians Wins: 2

No Result: 0

NEW DELHI: The eagerly awaited clash between Mumbai Indians (MI) and Gujarat Titans (GT) is set to take place this Saturday, with both teams desperate to secure their first win of the IPL 2025 season after disappointing opening matches. Mumbai Indians, coming off a four-wicket loss to Chennai Super Kings, are looking to bounce back, while Gujarat Titans, who lost by 11 runs to Punjab Kings in a high-scoring thriller, are equally keen to make amends.Mumbai Indians will be bolstered by the return of Hardik Pandya , who was serving a one-match ban. His presence will bring much-needed balance to their lineup, providing depth in both batting and bowling. However, the absence of Jasprit Bumrah in the opener exposed some weaknesses in Mumbai's attack, especially in the death overs. Pandya's all-round capabilities, combined with his pace-bowling prowess, will be crucial in addressing those vulnerabilities.Also see: CSK vs RCB Live Score Gujarat Titans, on the other hand, also faced issues in their opening match, particularly with their bowling attack. While Kagiso Rabada and Rashid Khan remain key weapons, they will be tested by Mumbai's formidable batting lineup, which includes the likes of Rohit Sharma and Suryakumar Yadav -- both of whom are currently out of form and will need to find their rhythm to lead the charge.The Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad will provide a batting-friendly surface, a stark contrast to the slow, spin-heavy track at Chepauk. With a combined total of 475 runs scored in the opening game at this venue, Mumbai's batsmen will be hoping to take full advantage of the conditions. Meanwhile, Mohammed Siraj's inconsistent performance against Punjab has raised concerns over his effectiveness in high-pressure situations.For Mumbai, Suryakumar Yadav’s form is crucial, as is Rohit Sharma's ability to find consistency. On the other hand, Shubman Gill's performance will be key for Gujarat Titans, as he will be expected to anchor the innings. The potential inclusion of Glenn Phillips over Sherfane Rutherford might strengthen their lineup, especially with Phillips’ off-spin offering an additional option for the team.In their previous five encounters, Gujarat Titans hold a slight edge, winning three matches, while Mumbai Indians have emerged victorious twice. Both teams will be looking to outplay each other in what promises to be a closely contested match.","Mumbai Indians host Gujarat Titans in IPL 2025 on Saturday.

A Spanish court overturned former Barcelona and Brazil footballer Dani Alves ' sexual assault conviction on Friday, citing ""insufficient evidence"" to uphold his presumption of guilt. Alves, 41, had been sentenced to four and a half years in prison in February 2024 for allegedly raping a woman at a nightclub in December 2022. However, the ruling was reversed by a panel of four judges in Barcelona.The landmark case was Spain's first high-profile trial under the 2022 ""only yes means yes"" legal reforms, which emphasise explicit consent in sexual crime cases. The legislation, introduced after national outrage over a 2016 gang-rape case at the San Fermin bull-running festival, defines consent as an active and clear expression of will, rejecting silence or passivity as agreement.Despite these legal changes, the court found inconsistencies between the accuser's testimony and surveillance footage recorded before the alleged incident. This led to the unanimous decision to overturn the conviction.Alves had been imprisoned since January 2023 before being released on bail in March 2024 after paying 1 million euros. He also surrendered his passports due to concerns he might flee.Prosecutors initially sought to extend Alves' sentence to nine years, while the victim's legal team pushed for 12. The ruling is subject to appeal at Spain's Supreme Court in Madrid.A decorated footballer, Alves won multiple league and Champions League titles with Barcelona, as well as Copa Americas and an Olympic gold medal with Brazil.","Dani Alves had been sentenced to four and a half years in prison in February 2024 for allegedly raping a woman at a nightclub in December 2022.

Barcelona secured a commanding 3-0 victory against Osasuna in the Spanish league, which gave them a three-point advantage over Real Madrid and extended their lead to seven points against Atletico Madrid, with 10 matches left in the season.Early strikes from Ferran Torres and Dani Olmo put Barca in command, with Robert Lewandowski coming off the bench to score off a header from Fermin Lopez.Manager Hansi Flick opted to keep Lewandowski out of the starting XI, introducing him late in the match. The Polish striker's goal took his league tally to 23, maintaining his position as the competition's top scorer.Barcelona maintained their impressive form with this victory, stretching their unbeaten sequence to 19 consecutive matches across all competitions in 2025.The fixture was initially set for March 8 but was rescheduled following the unfortunate passing of a Barcelona first-team doctor shortly before the original kick-off time.Torres finished a well-coordinated passing sequence in the 11th minute by converting a low cross delivered by Alejandro Balde. De Jong set up Balde with a precise pass, enabling the left-back to assist Torres, who scored his 14th goal of the campaign across all competitions.Later in the first half, Torres nearly added another goal when his free-kick struck the crossbar.Olmo extended the advantage by successfully converting a penalty retake in the 21st minute, which he had initially won after being brought down by goalkeeper Sergio Herrera.Although Herrera blocked the first attempt, Olmo was granted another chance when Osasuna's Jon Moncayola entered the penalty area prematurely.Shortly afterwards, Olmo was substituted due to what appeared to be a leg injury.Croatian international and Osasuna's leading goalscorer Ante Budimir was introduced for the final 30 minutes but failed to make any significant impact in attack.",Barcelona beat Osasuna 3-0 in their La Liga clash.

Madrid's compelling case

Follow Gerrard's lead?

Liverpool: Trent Alexander-Arnold 's proposed move from Liverpool to Real Madrid has split opinion on whether a local hero can leave Merseyside without a lasting stain on his legacy.Alexander-Arnold joined the Reds 20 years ago as a six-year-old and has gone on to win a clean sweep of Premier League, Champions League, FA Cup, League Cup, UEFA Super Cup and Club World Cup titles.His status is reflected in a mural that stands just metres from the club's Anfield stadium, emblazoned with the quote: ""I'm just a normal lad from Liverpool whose dream has just come true.""However, how he will be remembered for years to come in his home city will for many be dictated by the decision he takes in the coming weeks over his future.Alexander-Arnold's contract expires at the end of the season, meaning Madrid do not have to pay a transfer fee for a player who has smashed Premier League records when it comes to a creative output from a right-back.Here, AFP Sport looks at the key considerations facing the 26-year-old ahead of a career-defining call.Liverpool like to taunt their Premier League rivals with their six European Cups, making them by a distance the most successful English club in the competition's history.Madrid though are in a league of their own with 15 European Cup or Champions League triumphs, including six in the past 11 years.On top of the lifestyle benefits that a switch to the Spanish sunshine offers, Alexander-Arnold would be lining up each week alongside his close friend and England colleague Jude Bellingham , among a cast of stars also including Kylian Mbappe and Vinicius Junior.The spotlight at the state-of-the-art, newly refurbished Santiago Bernabeu could also offer Alexander-Arnold the chance to fulfil his dream of becoming the first full-back to win the Ballon d'Or.""I believe I can (win it),"" Alexander-Arnold told Sky Sports earlier this season. ""It's only the morning after you retire that you're able to look in the mirror and say, 'I gave it everything I got'.""It doesn't matter how many trophies you win, or how many medals you've got. It matters what you give to the game and if you reach your full potential.""By running his contract down, Alexander-Arnold is in a strong position to make millions from a signing-on bonus in lieu of Madrid having to pay a huge transfer fee.And he can argue there is little more to be gained by staying at Anfield.Liverpool are 12 points clear at the top of the Premier League, meaning by the time his current deal expires, Alexander-Arnold should be a two-time English champion to go with six other major trophies.""His legacy, I hope, is one of an outstanding homegrown footballer who's done incredibly well for this club,"" Steve McManaman, who himself made the move from Liverpool to Real Madrid on a free transfer back in 1999, told the BBC.McManaman won two Champions Leagues and two La Liga titles in his four years in the Spanish capital and yet is being used as the counter argument encouraging Alexander-Arnold to stay.""It's about his legacy at Liverpool and how he is seen. Do you want to be seen like (Steven) Gerrard or McManaman?"" former Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher, himself a one-club legend, said of Alexander-Arnold's choice.""He (McManaman) went to Real Madrid and won cups but he is not adored. If (Alexander-Arnold) stays, he will be remembered as one of the best to play for the club and not far behind Gerrard.""Alexander-Arnold is already the club's vice-captain and would be the natural heir to Virgil van Dijk.In contrast to the era of Gerrard, McManaman and Michael Owen, who swapped Liverpool for Madrid in 2004, he is part of a side regularly competing at the top of the Premier League and Champions League.Should he stay, Alexander-Arnold could be front and centre of trophy lifts in years to come as a local lad turned legend.But Liverpool are just the latest club to learn that the magnetism of Madrid is hard to resist.",Trent Alexander-Arnold's contract at Liverpool expires at the end of the season. The 26-year-old has been linked with a move to Spanish giants Real Madrid. Liverpool are 12 points clear at the top of the Premier League.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119593701,imgsize-117496,width-400,resizemode-4/119593701.jpg"

Hamza Choudhury

revels in playing for ‘home’ team

Shillong: Despite all the hype surrounding a Sunil Chhteri-Hamza Choudhury faceoff, all that the 14,952 fans gathered at JN Stadium here on Tuesday witnessed was a scrappy goalless draw.India head coach Manolo Marquez did not mince his words when he declared at the post-match press conference, “Maybe today (Tuesday) is the most difficult press conference in my career since I don’t want to say all the things that are in my head at this moment.”While the coach refused to give excuses for India’s dismal show in their opening home fixture of the AFC Asian Cup Qualifier , one could gauge all that might be running in the Spaniard’s head in a game that began with goalkeeper Vishal Kaith passing a regulation pass straight to the opposition winger and culminating in veteran Chhetri — called back from retirement by Marquez to aid India’s qualifying hopes — glancing a header wide and narrowly missing out.“I don’t want to talk too much, because I am very angry, disappointed with the performance of everyone, and it also must include that of the coach. I don’t have words to explain this poor, poor performance from everyone,” said Marquez. “This is not enough. But maybe this is the reality of Indian football.”The only bright spot for the hosts — apart from the intent shown by Liston Colaco, Boris Singh Thangjam and, occasionally, Farukh Choudhary — was that the other match in the group between Hong Kong and Singapore also ended in a stalemate, keeping all four teams level on one point each. So, in June when India travel to take on the 155th ranked Hong Kong, it would be a chance for a fresh start to their Saudi Arabia dream.While Marquez was not ready to give excuses, the end of the club season in April-end or the beginning of May, could give him and his wards the much-needed preparation and recovery time that they lacked in the lead-up to the Bangladesh first leg.“We can speak several hours about this one competition that you play Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday. And the players arrive at the national team with two days to go. Some may have played two days ago, another seven days ago and another five days ago. These may be called excuses, but the reality is that the physical condition is not the same if you played yesterday or one week ago,” said the coach, “But this is not the reason that we played a bad game today.”India were also lucky that Bangladesh failed to take advantage of the errors made in the Indian defence and the visiting coach rued the chance to change their recent stats against India and claim all three points.“Unfortunately, we missed clear chances, and we should have scored,” Javier Cabrera said at his post-match interaction. “But we must be positive. If we can get those chances away against India, the strongest team in the group, we can do better against the others. But it’s clear today that we are a contender to qualify for Asian Cup.“That is what we must believe in and then make it happen,” he added.Having represented U-21 England, where he was born, Hamza Choudhury made his first start for the country of his mother’s origin here on Tuesday, having officially made the switch at international level in December last year.“Oh, I was so proud when the national anthem began,” Choudhury, who has 50 caps for Leicester City in the Premier League, said after the match. “It gave me goosebumps.”It marks the first time ever a Premier League footballer played for Bangladesh.It could be Choudhury’s crowning achievement in an already promising career that included captaining his boyhood club Leicester and then becoming the first player of Bangladeshi origin to lift the FA Cup with the Premier League club in 2019.Choudhury used his platform to show solidarity for Palestine, just as he wishes to do in inspiring more South Asian representation in English football. And on Tuesday, although the 27-year-old focused on strengthening the Bangladesh backline, the motivation his teammates felt in his presence lifted the team’s game.“More than his qualities as a player, it’s his quality as a teammate that gives the team so much confidence,” coach Javier Cabrera said in the post-match interaction.His quality as a player was certainly evident in glimpses, especially while marking veteran Sunil Chhetri , but Choudhury — true to his personality — was quick to play down his influence upon the team.“We are actually strongest as a team. We are all looking out for one another,” he said. “I will do better for the team in the upcoming matches. I was just with the team for the last five days, which is a very short period,” further added Choudhury.","Hamza Choudhury made his first start for the country of his mother’s origin here on Tuesday, having officially made the switch at international level in December last year.

SHILLONG: The fans came out in large numbers, making their presence felt with some lusty cheering. But India, playing their second international match at the JN Stadium here, could not give them the joy they had hoped for as their opening AFC Asian Cup Qualifier against Bangladesh ended 0-0 on Tuesday.With the other match of Group C between Hong Kong and Singapore also ending in a 0-0 draw, all four in the group are level on one point each with five more games left to decide the toppers and eventual qualifiers for the tournament to be held Saudi Arabia in 2027.The match began on a frustrating note for India as they could have been two goals behind within the opening 20 minutes — due to silly mistakes by goalkeeper Vishal Kaith and Sandesh Jhingan. While Mojibor Jony failed to slot home a terrible clearance from Kaith in the opening minute, Shariyar Emon glanced wide a gorgeous cross from Mohammed Shakil Topu.India managed more possession in the first half but it was Hamza Choudhury’s game reading in midfield that kept Bangladesh in the hunt for a breakthrough. While Mohd Ridoy’s clearance of a Liston Colaco free-kick in the 23rd minute could have ended in an own goal, it was in the 31st minute that the best chance of the half came for India.Colaco sent a cross from the left flank to the right of the goal after combining from behind with Subhasish Bose. But Udanta’s diving header was saved by Bangladesh custodian Mitul Marma, who then went on to collect Farukh’s soft try from the ensuing rebound. The chance lifted India’s game with Colaco looking more dangerous and Sunil Chhetri lurking more often near the goal. However, the constant cheers from the stands could not inspire a breakthrough.India started the second half with more purpose. But with Hamza Choudhury marking Chhetri during set-pieces, the Indian legend failed to win his duels with the former Premier League veteran.Manolo Marquez’s ‘men in blue’ did come close in the 55th and 57th minutes. First, Colaco’s curling header evaded an onrushing Chhetri, and then Hamza blocked the comeback man’s shot.",India and Bangladesh play out 0-0 draw in their opening AFC Asian Cup qualifier.

Teenage tennis sensation Alexandra Eala maintained remarkable composure after delivering one of the WTA season's biggest upsets. The Filipina displayed minimal emotion after breaking world number two Iga Swiatek 's serve for the eighth time to advance to the Miami Open semi-finals.Despite her face momentarily quivering on the verge of tears following her victory, Eala remained composed.

Australia's Alex de Minaur put an end to Brazilian talent Joao Fonseca 's challenge at the Miami Open, outlasting the 18-year-old 5-7, 7-5, 6-3 in an enthralling contest.Attendance on stadium court had been sparse throughout Monday, but the Hard Rock Stadium turned into a mini-Maracana Stadium for Fonseca's match, complete with Brazilian flags and football-style chanting.Fonseca brought his energetic brand of ultra-attacking tennis, but De Minaur was up to the challenge, coping with both the blistering forehands and the partisan crowd.Such was the dominance of Fonseca's raucous support that the referee switched to Portuguese for his appeals for quiet.But de Minaur won six of the final seven games to move into the fourth round, keeping his cool even when the crowd, at times, disrupted his serve preparation.""Mentally I was ready for this match, I knew I was not only going to play an incredible talent like Joao, playing with immense confidence and nothing to lose, but also an incredible crowd that was on his side from the first point until the last,"" de Minaur said.""One of my biggest strengths is my mentality and that is what got me the win today,"" he added.Top seed Alexander Zverev recovered from a slow start to power into the fourth round of the Miami Open with a 7-5, 6-4 win against Australia's Jordan Thompson.The German was 4-1 down in the first set but then went on a roll, winning eight of the next nine games to progress.Zverev lost in the opening round at Indian Wells, but with Carlos Alcaraz already out in Miami he will fancy his chances of adding to his list of seven Masters 1000 titles.Third-seed Taylor Fritz also moved into the fourth round beating Denis Shapovalov of Canada 7-5, 6-3.The American let slip a 5-2 lead in the first set, but regained control with his serve proving too much for Shapovalov.In the women's draw, third-seed Coco Gauff 's bid ended with a 6-4 6-4 loss to Poland's Magda Linette .Top-seeded Aryna Sabalenka eased her way into the last eight with a 6-4, 6-4 win over last year's winner Danielle Collins of the USA.Next, Sabalenka will be up against ninth seeded Olympic gold medallist Zheng Qinwen who reached her second consecutive WTA 1000 quarter-final, with a straight-sets win over Ashlyn Krueger.""I'm super happy to get this win in straight sets and happy with the level I played today,"" said Sabalenka.""She's a tough opponent, and we had a lot of tough and tricky matches in the past. So was very happy to get through this one,"" she added.Italy's Jasmine Paolini enjoyed a 3-6, 6-4, 6-4 comeback win over Naomi Osaka in 2 hours and 15 minutes.Since her comeback from maternity leave 15 months ago, Osaka has been showing some signs of getting back towards her best but Paolini was the first top 10 player Osaka has faced this year.""I don't think that I can say that I've played a lot of matches against top players like this in a while,"" said Osaka.""The way she plays kind of catches me off guard, simply because of her height. I didn't know she could hit like that,"" she added.Emma Raducanu continued her impressive form in Miami, cruising to a 6-1, 6-3 victory in 69 minutes over American Amanda Anisimova, who had eliminated Indian Wells winner Mirra Andreeva on Sunday.It is the first time Raducanu has won four straight WTA Tour main draw matches in a row since her US Open triumph in 2021. She will face American Jessica Pegula next.Raducanu, who has brought in some old faces from the early days of her career for this tournament, said she was benefitting from their presence.""I'm really happy with how things are on and off the court right now and just so happy that's able to transfer on to the match court,"" she said.Alexandra Eala, the 19-year-old from the Philippines who upset Australian Open champion Madison Keys on Sunday, was handed a place in the quarter-finals after her fourth round opponent, Spain's Paula Badosa, pulled out with a lower back injury.In the last eight Eala will face second seed Iga Swiatek who battled past Ukraine's Elina Svitolina 7-6 (7/5) 6-3.","Alex de Minaur beats Joao Fonseca 5-7, 7-5, 6-3 in enthralling contest.

Of course, my family should take credit for the foundation that they laid out before they sent me there.""""But of course, the academy was able to build on that foundation in such a way that I'm able to be where I am now. And I think the combination of everything that I've been through since I started tennis is what has led to this moment and what has led to me having all these opportunities.""The decision to move to Europe was made easier as her brother Miko also joined the academy.""It was definitely a big decision for me, for us. As soon as I heard that, I jumped at the opportunity because I knew that I had to get out of the country eventually to improve.""Eala's tennis journey began with her grandfather, a club player who coached her brother and cousins before focusing on her development.""I was kind of the next in line to do that and to spend time with him. It eventually blossomed into the career I have now.""Her victory came shortly after fellow Nadal Academy member Coleman Wong from Hong Kong defeated American 13th seed Ben Shelton in Miami.""I'm super happy for him and to see someone that I've known so long do so well is definitely an inspiration. Not just to me, but I feel in general a lot of people can take inspiration from him.""Despite her success, Eala maintains a humble perspective about being a role model for young players in the Philippines.""The young kids, the youth in the Philippines, they don't need to take inspiration from me.

BENGALURU: Vedant Mohan -- India’s most promising sub-junior tennis player (under-14) – has kickstarted the next step of his junior career, transitioning to the International Tennis Federation’s junior Tour (under-18).The 14-year-old, who had been locked down at his training base in Javea, a coastal town in Spain since February, started by playing a couple of base-level ITFs in Sri Lanka these last weeks. He's scheduled for more J30s and J60s in May, most likely in Africa.Vedant, left-handed, also plays on the Spanish circuit and has gained immensely in the last few years competing in Tennis Europe events alongside some of the best under-14 talents in the world. Vedant’s highest ranking in the under-14 section of the Tennis Europe ratings was achieved on his 14th birthday this January, when he still had another 12 months left in the age-group.He was ranked No.13 and at the time, the only Asian in the top 25.While playing in Europe helped grow Vedant’s game, the 5-feet-8-inch Indian couldn’t play the full circuit. He didn’t qualify for the European Championships, the Summer or Winter Cups, all big-ticket competitions, and open only to Europeans as they are team events.That, along with the fact that he was cash-strapped, contributed to Vedant’s rather limited matchplay in comparison to his peers (2011-born) who were ranked higher than him.For instance, the TE No.1 (U-14) Mario Vukovic of France has played 176 singles matches and the No.2 Greece’s Rafael Pagonis played 192 while Vedant has played just 102.The 14-year-old will now play a mix of U-16 and U-18 tournaments in Spain, while targeting ITF under-18s. Vedant’s parents – father Dhruv and mother Anisha – moved to Spain five years ago when their son, then nine, received a tennis scholarship.Mohan, a commercial pilot, has for most part funded Vedant’s mushrooming career, while also leaning on Anisha’s and his family back home in India. He lives in Muscat, while Anisha and their two sons live in Javea, where Vedant trains under Javier Ferrer, brother of former top-5 pro David.Vedant, who idolises tennis legend Novak Djokovic because of his mentality, says his favourite surface is clay.“I love that I can rip the ball hard and heavy with topspin on clay. Also, I love to slide,” he told TOI. “My favourite shot is my inside-out forehand. I like to play aggressively, my game is all court. I like to volley and also play with variation.”Mohan, a collegiate-level tennis player in India, winning gold medals in singles and doubles, is hoping his son will be part of junior Grand Slam draws in the next 18-to-24 months.“The ultimate goal is the pros, the ATP Tour,” he said, adding, “At this stage we’re only looking to develop his game.”","Vedant Mohan is India’s most promising sub-junior tennis player (under-14) The 14-year-old will now play a mix of U-16 and U-18 tournaments in Spain.

Miami: Carlos Alcaraz , ranked world number three, experienced an unexpected early elimination from the Miami Open on Friday. Belgian veteran David Goffin secured a remarkable comeback victory with a score of 5-7, 6-4, 6-3 at Hard Rock Stadium .Goffin, aged 34 and currently ranked 55th, had previously defeated Alcaraz in Astana three years ago. Noticing Alcaraz's subpar performance in the opening set, Goffin adopted an aggressive approach.Goffin, who once achieved a career-high ranking of No.7 in 2017, delivered impressive winning shots while Alcaraz struggled with unforced errors. The Belgian player managed to secure a break advantage in all three sets, and despite losing his lead in the first set, he maintained composure to secure the victory.""When I came out earlier... just to warm up on the court, I felt 'I'm moving well. I'm feeling quite relaxed. I'm hitting the ball really well' and so I hoped it would be the same during the match.""""I started the match well. I had the break in the first and he started to play really well at the end of the first.""""It's that kind of night that I will remember for sure -- against Carlos and in a stadium like that. And the night that gave me a lot of confidence to continue.""Daniil Medvedev also faced an early exit following a 6-2, 6-3 loss to Spain's Jaume Munar, ranked 56th. Meanwhile, Novak Djokovic secured a straight-sets victory over Australian Rinky Hijikata.Medvedev, who won the Miami title in 2023, displayed frustration by throwing his racket multiple times. Munar, the 27-year-old from Mallorca, achieved his third career victory over a top 10 opponent.The Russian player committed 32 unforced errors and failed to convert two break points in the final game despite having an opportunity to mount a comeback.""Yeah, I was not 100% physically, but I tried my best to get into the match. Every day was better and better. I had some problems after Indian Wells. Can happen.""""He played well, so that's why (he won) I wouldn't go to the match if I would kind of definitely know I'm not ready to win.""Djokovic, who previously lost to a lucky loser at Indian Wells, defeated 86th-ranked Hijikata 6-0, 7-6 (7/1), ending his three-match losing streak. He has now matched Rafael Nadal's record of 410 match wins in Masters 1000 tournaments since their inception in 1990.Karen Khachanov halted Nick Kyrgios's comeback with a 7-6 (7/3), 6-0 victory. Kyrgios, returning from wrist surgery, had secured his first tour-level win since October 2022 against Mackenzie McDonald but couldn't overcome Khachanov, a semi-finalist in Miami last year.In the women's competition, world number two Iga Swiatek advanced to the third round by defeating France's Caroline Garcia 6-2, 7-5. The match proved more challenging than their recent encounter at Indian Wells.Swiatek faced a 3-1 deficit in the second set and saved a set point while serving at 5-4 down before winning the final three games.""My energy level got down really fast. So I tried to wake myself up, keep the intensity from the first set, follow through and go for it,"" Swiatek said.Emma Raducanu demonstrated determination in her victory over eighth-seeded American Emma Navarro.

CHENNAI: Sankar Muthusamy recorded the biggest win of his nascent career yet, defeating World No. 2 Anders Antonsen of Denmark 18-21, 21-12, 21-5 in the Swiss Open men’s singles pre-quarterfinals in Basel late on Thursday.What surprised many was the way in which the Indian dominated the deciding game. Despite losing the opener, the 21-year-old did not give up and pushed the match to the decider. He was helped by a flurry of unforced errors that Antonsen committed — the Dane hitting the shuttle wide and long on multiple occasions. Sankar made the most of the opportunity and succeeded.The Chennai lad entered the tournament as a qualifier and registered two wins to enter the main draw.“It feels good, and I have been doing well in this tournament. The first game (against Antonsen) lasted for close to 30 minutes and I feel that he became tired after that. I was able to score points from long rallies and capitalised on the situation. I was focusing on one point at a time and did not think much about the result,” Sankar, ranked 64th, told TOI from Basel.“In the deciding game, I was just expecting him to come back at me and was ready to handle the situation. My aim was to move him around the court and make him tired.”Sankar, who was a former junior World No. 1, lacked consistency in the 2024 season due to various reasons. However, he started the 2025 season on a bright note, reaching the quarterfinals of the Thailand Masters. He was later down with fever and could not give his best in the next few tournaments. However, Sankar recovered well ahead of the Swiss Open.The youngster, who is known for his defensive play, has improved his attacking skills and stroke-making.“My strokes have become sharper than usual, and I am able to finish off points from the rear court. My power is gradually increasing, and I am working on it. There is still a long way to go,” he said.Sankar’s long-time coach Aravindan Samiappan said that the win has come at the right time for his ward.“The moment has not sunk in properly. Sankar was an underdog and had nothing to lose. Our plan was to stay neck-to-neck on points and towards the end anything could have happened. But none would have expected such a scoreline in the decider. It was a bit shocking but that happens sometimes,” Aravindan said.The coach feels that opponents can no longer come prepared for Sankar, as he lends unpredictability into his game now.“Sankar can vary the pace of the match whenever required, and this was not the case one and a half years ago. Players could anticipate what he was going to do, as he played at a single pace. Now, you cannot predict him, and that is the major difference in his gameplay,” pointed out the coach.","Sankar Muthusamy defeated World No. 2 Anders Antonsen of Denmark 18-21, 21-12,. 21-5 in the Swiss Open men’s singles pre-quarterfinals in Basel late on Thursday.

NAGPUR: Malvika Bansod rallied from three points (14-17) down to clinch the first game but as luck would have it the 23-year-old world No.23 missed a chance to save the second match point in the decider to go down fighting against higher ranked Michelle Li of Canada, and bow out of the Swiss Open on Wednesday.Though Malvika suffered an early exit from the BWF World Tour Super 300 tournament, the world No.20 Li escaped to win the opening round contest against the Nagpur shuttler. Malvika lost the 65-minute thrill-a-minute clash 22-20, 14-20, 19-21.For Malvika, it was a heartbreak exit from the $250,000 tournament at Basel, Switzerland. In a neck-and-neck contest, Canada’s Li won a handful of net shots as Malvika made her higher ranked opponent dance to her tunes with various cross court tricks.

PCB

deeply upset at BCCI's fresh demands

Poll Do You Support India’s Decision to Exclude Pakistan’s Name From Jerseys? No, Sports Should Be Free of Political Considerations Yes, The Team Should Represent National Pride

MUMBAI: A fresh controversy has erupted over Champions Trophy to be held in Pakistan and UAE in February-March.TOI has learnt BCCI doesn't want its players to wear jerseys with the name of Pakistan, the host nation, displayed on it.BCCI is also firm that skipper Rohit Sharma won't travel to Pakistan for the captains' press conference and photo shoot.According to a BCCI source, the board has requested ICC to shift the twin events, which take place just before the tournament takes off on Feb 19, from Pakistan to Dubai.""ICC has already accommodated India's request to not schedule its CT matches in Pakistan, so these are minor issues,"" the source told TOI on Tuesday.The decision by BCCI has left the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) peeved and it is hoping for ICC's intervention in the matter.""The BCCI is bringing politics into cricket, which is not at all good for the game. They refused to travel to Pakistan. They don't want to send their captain (to Pakistan) for the opening ceremony. Now there are reports that they don't want the host nation's (Pakistan) name printed on their jerseys. We believe that the world governing body (ICC) will not let this happen and support Pakistan,"" a PCB official told IANS on condition of anonymity.As per the rules, India not wearing the official logo of the hosts, in this case Pakistan, will be a breach of ICC's official clothing code.According to the tradition of ICC tournaments, it is customary for the participating teams to feature the host nation's name on their jersey even if the tournament is being held elsewhere.For example, Pakistan's jersey during the 2021 T20 World Cup featured India's name on it despite the tournament taking place in the UAE.Also, when Pakistan participated in the 2016 T20 World Cup and 2023 ODI World Cup in India, they had the host nation's name on their jerseys.BCCI's decision will add to the ongoing tension between BCCI and PCB. The former has already refused to travel to Pakistan and India will play their fixtures in the UAE.The eight-team tournament will commence on Feb 19 and will conclude on March 9. The 15 matches in the competition will be hosted across four venues - Dubai, Karachi, Lahore and Rawalpindi.","Champions Trophy to be held in Pakistan and UAE in February-March.

Axar Patel hints at flexible middle-order ahead of England T20I series

NEW DELHI: The National Anti-Doping Agency (Nada) has expanded its purview and included more elite cricketers in its comprehensive anti-doping programme. Nada has prepared a new roster of names under the 'Registered Testing Pool' (RTP) for the year 2025. The list includes several top, centrally-contracted cricketers – men's T20I captain Suryakumar Yadav , Test vice-captain Jasprit Bumrah , ODI team vice-captain Shubman Gill and wicketkeeper-batsman Rishabh Pant being the prominent ones.Hardik Pandya, Shreyas Iyer, KL Rahul, Yashasvi Jaiswal, Arshdeep Singh , Sanju Samson and Tilak Verma are also in the new list. The women cricketers in the list are opener Shafali Verma, all-rounder Deepti Sharma and medium pacer Renuka Singh Thakur.A total of 14 men and women cricketers are in the current RTP along with athletes from other disciplines.It has been ascertained that Nada's dope control officers (DCOs) will be collecting urine samples of some cricketers in the RTP during the upcoming white-ball series against visiting England. The DCOs will visit different match venues. BCCI has been notified accordingly.Nada had, in September 2019, created the RTP of cricketers for both men and women, including Cheteshwar Pujara, Ravindra Jadeja, KL Rahul, Smriti Mandhana and Deepti Sharma. This was the first set of cricketers who had shared their ‘whereabouts' details with Nada DCOs for remaining available to give their urine samples for testing.In June 2020, Nada had let off Pujara, Jadeja, Rahul, Mandhana and Sharma for their failure to disclose their whereabouts. The cricketers were given a simple ""warning"" by Nada after admitting BCCI's contention that the whereabouts' ‘filing failure' happened due to a password glitch and the inability to access the BCCI office due to the Covid-induced lockdown.Athletes who are part of the RTP, are required to provide whereabouts information which will then be utilised by Nada to locate them for an effective out-of-competition sample collection process.The whereabouts information comprises residence address, email address and phone number; an address for overnight accommodations; regular activities, such as training, work, and the locations and times of these activities; competition schedules and locations and a 60-minute time slot for each day where they will be available and accessible for testing and liable for a potential ‘missed test'.Any combination of three filing failures or missed tests in a 12-month period may result in an anti-doping rule violation (ADRV). With the inclusion of cricketers, the Nada's RTP of athletes, including that from Olympic disciplines, stands at 227 sportspersons.","The National Anti-Doping Agency (Nada) has expanded its purview and included more elite cricketers in its comprehensive anti-doping programme.

In order to advance to the playoffs, the runners-up from the previous season now have an almost impossible task ahead of them.DSG captain Keshav Maharaj won the toss and chose to field first in Durban.Before Rickelton (18 off nine balls, 4x4) sliced a length-delivery from Junior Dala on to his stumps, MI Cape Town openers Ryan Rickelton and Rassie van der Dussen rushed out of the starting blocks to score 34 in only four overs.Even when Reeza Hendricks (8) and Colin Ingram (1) were caught on the boundary while trying to sweep the spin of Keshav Maharaj and Noor Ahmad, respectively, Van Dussen (35 not out, 3x4, 1x6) kept up the momentum. Rashid Khan , the captain, was promoted to No. 5 by MICT. Before the rain started, he promptly belted a boundary over the covers and didn't give up for the remainder of the evening.When DSG hosts the dominant Royals on Thursday night for their final home group game at Kingsmead, they will be hoping for brighter skies.Since MICT only plays again on Saturday in the rematch against the Super Giants at Newlands, they will be anticipating a brief rest.","MI Cape Town's match against Durban Super Giants at Kingsmead was called off due to bad weather.

NEW DELHI: The cricketing world has gone into a frenzy since legendary South African batter AB de Villiers , affectionately called "" Mr. 360 "", recently hinted at the possibility of a comeback from retirement during an interview with journalist Melinda Farrell.Known for his innovative stroke play and ability to dominate bowlers on any given day, de Villiers retired from all formats in 2021.However, his recent comments have rekindled hope among fans eager to see the South African maestro in action again.""I might still play cricket one day,"" de Villiers teased. ""No confirmation whatsoever, but I’m starting to feel it. My kids are putting me under a bit of pressure, and I feel like I could go to the nets with them. if I enjoy it, maybe I'll walk out and go and play a little bit of casual cricket somewhere again and not professional IPL stuff or SA tours.""De Villiers reflected on the idea of rediscovering his love for the game in a stress-free environment, primarily inspired by his children. ""Who knows? But we'll see. I'm gonna try it again and see if this eye is still working. It's a bit blurry, but this (the right one) is the dominant one, and it's working fine. So I'm doing it for my kids and see if I can go out there and enjoy cricket again.""When asked about role models like 45-year-old Imran Tahir still actively playing, de Villiers expressed admiration. ""I'll maybe ask him to be in my team wherever I go. Just remember this: he's one of my favourite players. Nothing serious, though. We're not talking about RCB and big stuff. Yes, I don't want to feel that pressure again. That's the thing. So, wherever I go, I'll have a bit of fun.""One of the most feared cricketers during his time, de Villiers played 114 Tests, 228 ODIs, and 78 T20Is, in which he broke numerous records, including the fastest fifty, century, and 150 in ODI cricket.Having become a pivotal part of the Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) in the Indian Premier League, de Villiers started his YouTube channel and has tried his hands at cricket commentary too.","Legendary South African cricketer AB de Villiers hints at comeback from retirement.

The Sri Lankan Perera was the first to leave for 23 soon before the powerplay ended, following a 42-run partnership between the two players. Tom Banton entered, and he and Waseem made sure the MI Emirates maintained the run rate.Banton was out for nine around the halfway point of the innings, while Waseem was out for 38 shortly after. Kieron Pollard replaced skipper Nicholas Pooran, but the seasoned right-hander struggled to get going and was eventually sent out for five by Ali Khan. With just over 6 overs remaining, the score was at 102/4.Following Dan Mousley's dismissal for six, Romario Shepherd joined his skipper for the innings' last stretch. Jason Holder made a solid 49, but Pooran, who was hitting it cleanly, was almost at his half-century before he fell.Shepherd was given more attention in the last few overs as a result. In order to end with an undefeated 38 from 13 deliveries, the powerful right-hander then moved through the gears and hammered three maximums and four boundaries. After slowing down for a few overs in the middle, the MI Emirates eventually reached 186/6.With openers Kyle Mayers and Andries Gous attacking the MI Emirates bowlers, the Abu Dhabi Knight Riders got off to a fast start. Before Dan Mousley ran him out with a brilliant bit of fielding, Mayers, who hit three sixes, scored 22 off 14 deliveries.The MI Emirates seized control after that, finishing a 39-run partnership in the fourth over.Following Joe Clarke's dismissal by Akeal Hosein for three, Romario Shepherd took out Michael-Kyle Pepper for five and Alishan Sharafu for four. The Abu Dhabi Knight Riders were 56/4 at the conclusion of a thrilling Powerplay.The Abu Dhabi Knight Riders were further put under pressure after Waqar Salamkheil dismissed Laurie Evans for seven and Zahoor Khan caught Gous in the deep for thirty-four. Hopes of a recovery were raised when Sunil Narine and Andre Russell were called to the middle and embarked on a half-century stand.But Narine was caught at cover for 13 in the 18th over, and David Willey was dismissed by Fazalhaq Farooqi in the 19th.

NEW DELHI: In light of India's declining performance, Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) president Snehasish Ganguly supported head coach Gautam Gambhir and believes he should be given more time.The Indian squad has been in ruins ever since Gambhir took over as head coach and started the era with his regime selections, particularly in the Test format.It all began when, for the first time in 27 years, India lost a bilateral ODI series to Sri Lanka. After defeating Bangladesh in the home series, India enjoyed a little breather, but things quickly deteriorated.When New Zealand arrived in India, they stunned the hosts with an incredible display. On paper, India was expected to easily defeat the Kiwis in red-ball cricket, particularly at home. However, the home citadel was breached, and India experienced a historic whitewash for the first time in 24 years.A further blow to India's already open wounds was the Border-Gavaskar Trophy . India suffered a 1-3 series loss and lost the coveted title for the first time in ten years.The current situation of the modern giants has gotten worse as a result of reports of the continuous rift inside the Indian team.Ganguly stepped in to support the struggling coach as the Indian team is in disarray and there is question over the future of the team's Indian stalwarts.""I feel happy because of his approach. As a coach, he got success for KKR after 12 years. We should give him some time. It has been some months since he has been handling the team after Rahul Dravid ,"" Ganguly told ANI.The next test for Gambhir will be a five-match Twenty20 International series against England, which starts in Kolkata on Wednesday.The three One-Day Internationals (ODIs) that will follow the five-match contest will be the perfect platform to get ready for the Champions Trophy next month.Ganguly was also excited with Mohammed Shami 's comeback to the field. Shami will perform in front of an enthusiastic Kolkata crowd making his comeback after a year.When discussing Shami's comeback, Ganguly emphasized the pacer's recent exploits for Bengal, where he participated in six to seven games and showed outstanding form.""The most important thing is the whole Kolkata crowd will be watching Mohammed Shami,"" Ganguly said.""He came back after a year and bowled very well for Bengal. I was observing his bowling, and he seems to be in great shape. He looks like the old Mohammed Shami--fit and raring to go,"" Ganguly added.Ganguly said he was confident in Shami's potential to have a big effect because the bowler appeared sharp and prepared for the contest.""Overall, it will be a very good match,"" he noted, emphasizing the excitement surrounding Shami's return to Eden Gardens .",Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) president Snehasish Ganguly supports head coach Gautam Gambhir.

Coco Gauff 's dreams of clinching another Grand Slam title came to an abrupt end as her forehand and serve faltered against Paula Badosa in the Australian Open quarterfinals on Tuesday. The No. 3 seed was eliminated by the 27-year-old Spaniard, who secured a straight-set victory, 7-5, 6-4, to advance to her maiden Grand Slam semifinal.Gauff, riding high on a 13-match winning streak and a flawless 9-0 record in 2025, entered the match brimming with confidence following her triumph at the WTA Finals last November. Despite her momentum, the 2023 US Open champion struggled to maintain consistency, committing 41 unforced errors, including six costly double faults and 28 missed forehands. Her serve woes were particularly evident, with a double fault handing Badosa a critical break to lead 5-2 in the second set.Badosa, seeded No. 11, displayed remarkable composure and resilience. ""She’s full of confidence. But I’m playing well, too,"" Badosa said before the match. Her confidence proved justified as she outmaneuvered Gauff in key moments, neutralizing the American's typically dominant baseline game.Gauff's inability to generate a single break point until late in the second set further highlighted her struggles. By the time she began to mount a resistance, the deficit was too great to overcome. At just 20 years old, Gauff will look to rebound in the upcoming tournaments, but this loss serves as a stark reminder of the challenges at the highest level of competition.For Badosa, this victory marks a significant milestone in her career. The Spaniard will now aim to carry her momentum into the semifinals, with her sights set on an even deeper run at Melbourne Park .","Coco Gauff's dreams of clinching another Grand Slam title came to an abrupt end as her forehand and serve faltered against Paula Badosa.

KOLKATA: The upcoming white-ball series between India and England brings the coaches on either side under the scanner. Both Gautam Gambhir and England counterpart Brendon McCullum , interestingly, are former coaches and players of the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) IPL franchise.After the Test series defeat Down Under, Gambhir's position as head coach is likely to be revaluated on the basis of India's Champions Trophy performance next month, so there is pressure on him. On the other hand, McCullum has made a new start, officially taking over as head coach across formats after having been in-charge of the Test team.McCullum's appointment comes after Matthew Mott was fired as white-ball coach on the back of two disappointing World Cup campaigns. England failed to advance to the semifinals of the ODI World Cup 2023 and just about made the top four in the T20 World Cup last year. The former New Zealand great's immediate task will be to inject some energy into the white-ball set-up.Also See: ICC Champions Trophy 2025 Gambhir got the India job more because of his success as a mentor in white-ball cricket, guiding the Kolkata Knight Riders to the IPL title. He was able to carry on the momentum during the T20I series against Sri Lanka, where India won all the three matches following the retirements of Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli from the shortest format. However, the former India opener is yet to secure a win in the 50-over format and the upcoming Champions Trophy is going to be important for his coaching future.McCullum will be carrying high expectations after he revolutionized the team's Test cricket with the 'Bazball' approach after becoming Test coach in July 2022. But he has never coached a white-ball international team, although he had brief stints as T20 coach for two franchise teams, with KKR being one of those.McCullum, for one, expressed respect for his India counterpart on Monday.""What I will say about Gautam Gambhir is that I've worked with him before. He's an outstanding leader. He's a really strong leader of men, and in the time that he's had in any sort of leadership positions he's held previously, he's been able to excel,"" McCullum told reporters here. ""He's only just sort of got underway with this team, but I have no doubt that he'll get the best out of the talent that he's got. And then we've (England) got to find a way to be able to counter that with our own style.""Also See: Champions Trophy Schedule 2025 Asked about coaching styles and philosophies, McCullum said, ""Everyone's approaches are very unique. From how I try and operate, it's probably less of a coach and more about trying to make sure that the environment is a happy and enjoyable one, where you guys feel as if they can push their talents and push themselves towards uncomfortable situations, knowing that there's still going to be that support and care there afterwards and be encouraged to go again go towards those.""Other coaches are very different. They like to run things in a quite structured, quite technical way. Other coaches are probably a bit more regimented in how they go about things, so I guess it's all fairly different,"" McCullum said.",Gautam Gambhir and Brendon McCullum are former coaches and players of the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) IPL franchise.

'I'm looking at building the franchise with Pant'

LSG owner Sanjiv Goenka talks to TOI on his expectations from the new captain....

Can Rishabh's price tag become a burden?

How important is it to have a culture of your own?

KOLKATA: Rishabh Pant's credentials as a leader are growing fast. The wicketkeeper-batter was on Monday named captain of Lucknow Super Giants ( LSG ), the IPL franchise that broke the bank for him at a mind-boggling Rs 27 cr. That at least two franchises were willing to go beyond the Rs 20 crore mark for him proves the kind of trust that Pant commands.""We would not have stopped at this amount,"" LSG owner Sanjiv Goenka says. Pant , however, wasn't surprised. ""Of course I was happy, but it was never about money,"" he told TOI in an exclusive interview.Leadership for me is more about looking after the players. How can you get the best out of them. How can you create an environment where they feel safe and stable so that they can give their 200%.Also See: ICC Champions Trophy 2025 I wasn't surprised, I have to say this (chuckles). But for me it wasn't about the money anyway. When I came to the auction, money wasn't in my thoughts, but I must say I was very happy with what I got. I wanted to be in a place where I could create the right environment with the help of the management. Create a franchise where people aspire to come, play and give their 100%.It's definitely a comfort zone as we have a lot of players who have experience in leadership in international cricket. You want to share that and it's always good to take the views of your seniors. A captain is as good as the team and everyone in the room is also thinking about the game. So, if you listen to everyone, keep everything in account and then make decisions, it is always good for the team. A good leader is always a good listener and that is something I would like to take forward.I've thought about it. I tried to tone myself down and I wanted to change a little, as people sometimes don't like it if I'm a little extroverted. With time you improve as an individual. Your decision-making changes. So, it's a mix of a lot of things. But after my car accident, I realized that there is no need to tone down. If I am excited about something, it means I care about it. Sometimes when you play cricket for a few years, your excitement goes down and you stop enjoying the game. You may be in a different position in your career, but that doesn't mean you need to change.I started playing cricket because I loved it. The thought process was to play for India and give my 200%. Now that I am blessed to be doing that, if I stop enjoying it means I am deviating from my goals. I promised myself that I am going to enjoy it more. There are a few people in the world who can do what they like and make money out of it, and why not. I see it as an opportunity. Coming to a new franchise is an opportunity.Also See: Champions Trophy 2025 Schedule I joined when I was 17-18, so it was a very emotional decision. But we are professionals, and this is what we do. I'm not thinking much about that now. Once the decision was made, I knew it would be a very difficult one. I knew I would feel bad but I can't be living in the past. I'd like to move on and get better. Now it's a different family for me and I'll look to build more relationships with the people here.The price tag (for Pant) was only relevant till the time the auction didn't happen. Thereafter, he is the leader. It's not about the tag. It's about his leadership, his performance, how he motivates players, how he strategizes. So, I haven't thought about the price tag for a moment after the auction got over. Everyone has got the same Rs 120 crore purse and it's your discretion on how you distribute it. Rishabh deserves that price. If the bidding had gone on and it was Rs 28 crore, I still would have gone for him as he was fundamental to all our plans. It's about the skills he brings. I'm looking at it for the next 10-12 years. He is 27 and will play till 40. I'm looking at building the franchise with him. The more I see him, the more I'm convinced he is the perfect choice for us.It's important for everyone to feel comfortable and happy. That is what we want to create. Also, we want to have an atmosphere of never-say-die attitude. These are the things that I feel Rishabh embodies. No owner is looking to win all the matches. As long as the win ratio is more than losses, it is good for us.","Rishabh Pant was on Monday named captain of Lucknow Super Giants. The wicketkeeper-batter broke the bank for the IPL franchise at a mind-boggling Rs 27 cr. ""Of course I was happy, but it was never about money,"" he told TOI in an exclusive interview.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117411500,imgsize-104452,width-400,resizemode-4/117411500.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Rishi Kapoor , the first Delhi footballer to win a national football league title, passed away in a city hospital on Monday. He was 49 and had reportedly been suffering from liver-related issues.Primarily a left-footed midfielder with fine passing ability and a thunderous shot, Kapoor spearheaded Hindustan FC ’s rise in Delhi’s football of the late 1990s and early 2000s, his ability and time on the ball was good enough to catch the attention of the big clubs in the then National Football League and later, the I-League .At a time when the Capital’s footballers were mostly semi-professional and rare on the national clubs’ scene, Rishi left to join ITI in Bangalore in 2000 with ambitions to play in the NFL. Already employed with Delhi Audit , and with ITI. He was one of the first players to be signed on contract by the Bangalore outfit as it rejigged its rules to allow for two outstation players, or ‘guest players’ as they were officially labelled.It was here that a tweak was made to his positional nature that would immediately further his prospects as a footballer. Partly due to a crowded midfield at ITI, and largely due to his left-footed passing and fondness for playing from the deep, Rishi was converted into a defender at left-back. It may have stifled a bit of his creativity, but his game-reading lent solidity to the defence. His performances at ITI led to Mohun Bagan taking notice.“We’ve lost a very good player today. This is no time to go,” Debjit Ghosh, teammate when Bagan won the title in 2002, told TOI from Kolkata. “When we first saw him at ITI, he was playing as left-back and he really impressed our coach, Subrata Bhattacharya. Much later after we signed him, we realized that he was a natural playmaker, but we needed him in defence. He and I struck up a very fine understanding on the field,” said the ex-India player.Former India international Renedy Singh too recalled their days together at Bagan. “Back then, it was normal that the clubs would never pay us on time. We would seldom have money, but we loved the local kebabs. I remember Rishi, Lolendra (Singh) and me literally scrounging money from here and there just to go Eliot Road and have kebabs,” said Renedy, “He was a very forthright person, probably that may have rubbed some people the wrong way but I remember him very, very fondly.”Despite a national title and the promise of further professional exposure, Rishi left Bagan to return to Delhi’s Hindustan. “He stayed just a few seasons with us. He wanted to return to keep his job,” remembered Ghosh. It was perhaps this mindset – of saving the job -- that probably cost the Delhi footballer an India call-up. Stephen Constantine, the then India coach, was impressed by Kapoor’s versatility on the left channel, but chose to ignore him because he rightly felt that Delhi’s football didn’t offer a high level of intensity and competitiveness.With his job safe, Kapoor enjoyed brief stints with Salgaocar and Sesa in Goa but always returned to establish himself as an Ambedkar Stadium fixture. A decade later, after his first move, as Delhi football would change character, moving away from the Walled City into the suburbs, Rishi Kapoor would be the symbol of change.

Barcelona were held to a 1-1 draw by Getafe in La Liga on Saturday, failing to make up ground on the top two teams in the Spanish title race.Jules Kounde gave Barcelona an early lead, but Mauro Arambarri equalised for Getafe in the first half, and the Catalans were unable to break down Jose Bordalas' well-organised team.The draw leaves Barcelona in third place, five points behind league leaders Atletico Madrid, who suffered a 1-0 defeat at Leganes earlier in the day.Despite winning the Spanish Super Cup last week and thrashing Real Betis in the Copa del Rey, suggesting a return to form after a slump in late 2024, Barcelona dropped two points on the road in their first league match of 2025 against 16th-placed Getafe.""It's not done yet, we still have some matches to play and as I said before, we will fight until the end,"" Flick told reporters.""Today it's one point more, not two points less. We missed (out on) two points, but we have to look forwards and make it better next time.""Flick fielded his strongest side in recent weeks, hoping to secure a result at Getafe, where Barcelona had failed to score in their previous four away visits.The Blaugrana ended that streak in the ninth minute when Kounde, who also scored in the midweek Copa del Rey win against Real Betis, was cleverly set up by Pedri and scored on the rebound after David Soria saved his initial effort.However, Barcelona faced the same difficulties they have often encountered at the Coliseum, with Getafe digging in and denying top scorer Robert Lewandowski any space.Getafe equalized in the 34th minute when Coba's shot was parried by Barcelona goalkeeper Inaki Pena, and Arambarri pounced to score.The hosts maintained their tight defensive setup in the second half, making life difficult for Barcelona.Raphinha missed a golden opportunity to win the game for Barca in the closing minutes, hitting the side netting from close range after being found by Lamine Yamal's cross.""It was a shame, the match, we had control of the game and with one chance they scored one goal against us, it's a shame,"" Kounde told Movistar.After the match, Barcelona defender Alejandro Balde reported being subjected to racist abuse from some home supporters during the first half.On Sunday, Spanish and European champions Real Madrid, currently second in La Liga, host Las Palmas with the aim of moving to the top of the table.In another surprise result, league leaders Atletico Madrid suffered a shock defeat at Leganes, ending their club record run of 15 consecutive victories.Matija Nastasic headed Leganes in front early in the second half, and Antoine Griezmann missed a late penalty, dragging his effort wide, as Atletico fell to their second league defeat of the season.""I thought we were low on energy, it wasn't enough from us,"" Atletico goalkeeper Jan Oblak told DAZN.""We'll keep our head up after (winning) 15 games, we lost this one and we have to keep going forwards... unfortunately the streak is over.""Leganes, 15th in the table, defended well to keep Atletico at bay in the first half, with Julian Alvarez and Griezmann hitting the woodwork.Nastasic's header from a corner put Leganes ahead early in the second half, and they protected their lead without much trouble until controversially conceding a penalty for a debatable handball by Sergio Gonzalez.Griezmann took responsibility from the spot but rolled his 90th-minute effort wide of the goal.Atletico must now regroup in the Champions League, where they aim to reach the knockout rounds, as they face Bayer Leverkusen on Tuesday.""They were 15 extraordinary games, I feel enormously proud at having set the (consecutive) winning record in Atletico's history,"" Atletico coach Diego Simeone told DAZN.""We have to accept that defeat is part of the game and prepare ourselves for Tuesday.""","Barcelona held to a 1-1 draw by Getafe in La Liga on Saturday.

NEW DELHI: Darwin Nunez delivered a late heroics to fire Liverpool back into Premier League title contention with a dramatic stoppage-time brace, securing a hard-fought 2-0 victory over Brentford at the Gtech Community Stadium on Saturday.Liverpool entered the match desperate to end a run of two consecutive league draws, and Nunez, who had struggled for form with just four goals in 26 appearances this season, emerged as the unlikely hero. The Uruguayan's double lifted the Reds seven points clear of second-placed Arsenal, though the Gunners have an opportunity to close the gap with a win over Aston Villa later in the day.The result provided a massive boost to Arne Slot ’s side, who remain in control of their title destiny with a game in hand. It also marked Liverpool’s first league win in three games, after a series of disappointing results that included a draw against Nottingham Forest and a League Cup semi-final first-leg defeat to Tottenham.Brentford, boasting the joint-best home record in the Premier League, made life difficult for the visitors early on. The Bees nearly took the lead when Mikkel Damsgaard failed to convert Mads Roerslev's inviting ball across the six-yard box. Bryan Mbeumo also tested Alisson Becker with a fierce drive from the edge of the area.Liverpool, meanwhile, created a host of chances but were thwarted by Brentford’s resilient defense and in-form goalkeeper Mark Flekken. Dominik Szoboszlai came agonizingly close to breaking the deadlock, smashing a 25-yard strike against the crossbar, while Cody Gakpo and Luis Diaz both missed opportunities to find the net.In the second half, Brentford continued to threaten on the counter, with Alisson twice denying Mbeumo and Nathan Collins making a crucial goal-line clearance to keep Salah's deflected shot out.With time running out and frustration building, Slot turned to Nunez, bringing him on alongside Andrew Robertson. The move paid off spectacularly in stoppage time. Trent Alexander-Arnold delivered a pinpoint cross, and Nunez calmly slotted home from close range, sparking wild celebrations on the Liverpool bench.Moments later, Nunez struck again, this time latching onto Harvey Elliott’s perfectly weighted pass and rifling a fierce shot past Flekken to seal the win. The Uruguayan’s decisive contributions silenced his critics and ensured Liverpool stayed firmly in the title race.For Brentford, the defeat marked a missed opportunity to capitalize on Liverpool's recent struggles. Thomas Frank's men, who had shown resilience in their 2-2 draw with Manchester City earlier in the week, were left to rue missed chances and late lapses in concentration.Liverpool’s victory not only ended their mini-slump but also sent a statement to their title rivals. With Nunez rediscovering his scoring touch, the Reds are primed for a strong push in the second half of the season.",Darwin Nunez scores stoppage-time brace as Liverpool beat Brentford 2-0.

NEW DELHI: Justin Kluivert delivered a sensational performance with a hat-trick as Bournemouth ended Newcastle 's winning streak in emphatic fashion, securing a dominant 4-1 victory at St. James’ Park on Saturday.The result propelled Bournemouth into the Premier League 's top six while halting Newcastle’s bid for a club-record 10th consecutive win across all competitions.The Cherries, now unbeaten in 11 matches, stunned the Magpies with their relentless energy and clinical finishing. Kluivert, the son of former Newcastle striker Patrick Kluivert , stole the spotlight before Milos Kerkez added the finishing touch with a late fourth goal in stoppage time.Newcastle, still in fourth place, saw their cushion over Bournemouth in the race for a Champions League spot shrink to just one point. The defeat also ended Alexander Isak’s remarkable scoring streak, as the Swedish striker, who had scored in eight consecutive Premier League games, was effectively neutralized by Bournemouth's resolute defense.Andoni Iraola’s Bournemouth started brightly, dominating from the first whistle. They nearly went ahead in the opening minutes when Dango Ouattara’s shot was saved by Martin Dubravka, and Antoine Semenyo blasted the rebound over the bar. Just two minutes later, they found the breakthrough as Semenyo’s cut-back was clinically swept into the far corner by Kluivert.Though Newcastle managed to briefly equalize through Bruno Guimarães, who headed in Lewis Hall’s corner, Bournemouth restored their lead before halftime. Kluivert doubled his tally with a composed finish from Ouattara’s precise pass, leaving the hosts reeling.The second half saw Bournemouth continue to dominate, with chances falling their way. Ouattara had a goal disallowed following a VAR review, and David Brooks was denied by a combination of Dubravka and the post.Unlike their midweek disappointment against Chelsea, where they conceded a stoppage-time equalizer, Bournemouth ensured there would be no repeat this time.Kluivert completed his hat-trick with a stunning strike from outside the box, marking his second treble of the season—though this one was particularly special as all three goals came from open play, unlike his hat-trick of penalties against Wolves in November.Milos Kerkez then capped off the victory in style, drilling home Bournemouth’s fourth. The 19-year-old Hungarian left-back, rumored to be on the radar of Liverpool and Manchester United, added insult to injury for Newcastle with his impressive strike.The defeat marked a humbling afternoon for Eddie Howe’s men, who were thoroughly outplayed in front of their home crowd. Meanwhile, Bournemouth’s stunning form continues to raise expectations as they make a push for European football.",Justin Kluivert scores hat-trick as Bournemouth beat Newcastle 4-1 at St. James' Park.

NEW DELHI: Manchester City star Erling Haaland on Friday signed a new contract with the Premier League champions that will keep him at the club until 2034.City announced the nine and a half year extension for the 24-year-old striker, who has netted an impressive 111 goals in 126 matches since his arrival from Borussia Dortmund in 2022.The extension marks the longest contract in the league's history, surpassing the nine-year agreement Cole Palmer signed with Chelsea last year.

NEW DELHI: Amad Diallo's remarkable 12-minute hat-trick rescued Manchester United from a potentially embarrassing defeat against struggling Southampton at Old Trafford on Thursday.The visitors, who are battling to avoid finishing the season as the worst team in Premier League history, took a deserved lead through Manuel Ugarte's own goal late in the first half.Southampton had numerous opportunities to extend their advantage, with Ivan Juric's side playing with confidence and intensity. However, Diallo's introduction in the second half proved to be a game-changer for the hosts.The young forward equalised in the 82nd minute, capitalising on a defensive lapse to score his first goal. Eight minutes later, he latched onto a clever pass from Christian Eriksen to put United ahead.Deep into stoppage time, Diallo completed his hat-trick, taking advantage of another defensive mistake from the visitors.The 3-1 victory provided a much-needed boost for Manchester United, who had endured three consecutive Premier League defeats prior to this match.It also lifted them to 12th in the table, while Southampton remained 10 points adrift of safety.Despite the eventual scoreline, Southampton's performance was commendable, as they caused numerous problems for United's defence throughout the match.Kamaldeen Sulemana was particularly impressive, tormenting the home side's right-back with his pace and trickery.Ruben Amorim's decision to introduce Diallo and make other attacking substitutions proved to be a masterstroke, as the forward's clinical finishing ultimately secured all three points for Manchester United in a match that appeared to be slipping away from them.","Manchester United beat Southampton 3-1 at Old Trafford on Thursday.

NEW DELHI: Brazilian football star Neymar jr recently shared his perspective on the dynamics within the Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) team during his time there.In a podcast hosted by Romário, a Brazilian World Cup winner, Neymar discussed the impact of Lionel Messi's arrival at the club in August 2021.According to Neymar, his former teammate Kylian Mbappé became ""a little jealous"" after Messi joined the team. Neymar suggested that Mbappé, who has since joined Real Madrid, didn't want to share the spotlight with anyone else, leading to some conflicts and a change in behaviour.“No, he is not. I have my things with him, we had a little fight, but he was fundamental for us when he arrived. I used to call him golden boy. I always played with him, said he was going to be one of the best. I always helped, talked to him, he came to my place, we had dinner together,” Neymar said.Neymar acknowledged that he had a good partnership with Mbappé initially, referring to him as the ""golden boy"" and praising his potential to become one of the best players.“We had some good years of partnership, but after Messi came he was a little jealous. He didn't want to split me with anyone. And then there were some fights, a change in behavior,” the Brazilian further added.While Neymar didn't explicitly name individuals, he mentioned that big egos within the team often hindered their performances in crucial matches.“It is good to have egos, but you have to know that you don't play alone. There needs to be another guy by your side. (Big) egos were almost everywhere, it can't work,” Neymar said. “If nobody runs and nobody helps, it is impossible to win anything.”Neymar also reflected on the possibility of returning to Brazil after his contract with Al-Hilal in Saudi Arabia expires later this year.It's worth noting that neither Mbappé nor Messi has responded to Neymar's comments as of now.","Neymar discussed the impact of Lionel Messi's arrival at Paris Saint-Germain.

Badosa, the 11th seed, stunned world number three Coco Gauff in straight sets earlier in the day to reach her first Grand Slam semi-final.Sabalenka's win was a test of endurance and adaptability as increasingly windy conditions turned the match into a struggle for consistency. Both players found it difficult to hold serve in the deciding set.""Honestly, I was just praying, trying to put the ball back in these tough conditions,"" said Sabalenka, who has won the Australian Open title in the past two years. ""We both were struggling out there. I'm just super happy I was able to somehow magically win this match.""The quarter-final began with Sabalenka grabbing an early break to lead 3-1. She dominated the opener, not facing a single break point, and sealed the set in 31 minutes with a blistering crosscourt forehand.However, the match took a dramatic turn in the second set. Pavlyuchenkova found her rhythm, breaking Sabalenka twice and extending the rallies to wrest control. A powerful forehand down the line gave the Russian a 3-1 lead, and she carried the momentum to serve out the set to love, leveling the match.The third set was chaotic, with both players struggling to adapt to the gusty conditions. The first four games saw breaks of serve before Sabalenka steadied herself.

The Times of India in Melbourne:

At times Coco Gauff buried her face in her palm, pausing somewhere at the baseline, other times she gestured at her box, perhaps hoping the warm summer breeze would blow some answers her way in the Australian Open quarterfinals against a resurgent Paula Badosa .The 20-year-old’s forehand was off, she had 43 errors on that flank (28 unforced and 15 forced) on a hot and humid day at Melbourne Park . It is not known to be the American’s stronger side, and on Rod Laver Arena she demonstrated why.“The timing was a little bit off,” Gauff said. “I was hitting (meeting) some balls too far in front almost, maybe playing a bit too far back.”“I felt like I was setting up a lot of the points and just the last ball (I was missing),” Gauff said. “I have to be aggressive, that's when I'm playing my best. That's how I won most of the matches in the last few months, playing aggressive.”Gauff, one of the best athletes on the Tour, if not the best, hasn’t been able to change gears from defense to offence at will.“I’m making a shift in my game. I haven't always played that aggressive,” she said. “It's about being more comfortable with that. I do have faith that it will be more of an instinct instead of a second guess.”Gauff, the world No.3. who was disappointed with her straight- set loss here, underlined that she was not crushed.“You have to realize that most of the internet coaches never coached anyone at my level or never played,” she said. “It's easier to look on the outside, you'll hear people saying, she should have made this or he should have made that. Even when I'm watching, I do that. Obviously when you're out there, it's different.”“I’m the one (who is) out there, and I'm the one who makes the decision at the end of the day,” Gauff said. “I take it with a grain of salt. Some people do mean well, so I don't look at it as all bad.”Gauff vowed to be the best player she can be. “I promise I'm going to continue to try my best to improve and live up to my own expectations of myself, and whatever everybody else has, I can't control that.”",Coco Gauff lost in straight sets to Paula Badosa in the Australian Open quarterfinals.

The Times of India in Melbourne:

At 27-years Paula Badosa is in her first major semi-final, the world No. 11 stood her ground to score against a rampaging Coco Gauff , who had blitzed her way to a 9-0 win-loss record for the season.The Spaniard, serving up a wicked cocktail of bottomless reserve and sparky power play, ripped her fifth forehand winner of the match to punctuate her 7-5, 6-4 win to make the Australian Open last four.Badosa, ranked No.2 in the world three years ago, is tennis’ long story, the five-set tale of nervy twists and turns. She fought off a bad back that appeared to derail her career, coming dangerously close to retirement last April, Badosa told herself she should play out the year at least before taking a final decision.The 27-year-old, WTA’s Comeback Player of the Year, following a career-threatening back injury in 2023, was 0-2 in major quarterfinals, but this time the world No.11 grabbing her first-ever Top-10 victory at a Grand Slam , overturned the run.Badosa was staring at the finish line last year – she had suffered stress fractures on the lowest vertebrae of the lumbar spine. Each time she went into therapy, trying to heal and strengthen her body, she had to stop, she wasn’t responding.“I thought about stopping when I was taking (pain management) injections, because they told me I could do a maximum of three injections a year and I was already on my second one, it was the fourth month of the year,” Badosa explained. “After my home tournament in Madrid it was very tough for me – my back and mentally even. I was thinking that maybe I wouldn’t be back again.”In a last-ditch effort Badosa introduced some changes in her team last May, fitness coach and nutritionist, bringing in Dani de la Serna and David Antona.“I went with a new team that I really believed in, I had worked with them in 2021, and it went really well. They knew my body,” she said. “When you have faith in a team, things start working. My back started to respond with the exercises they were telling me, the diet, the supplements I had to take.”Badosa said, “(Now) I feel like I'm back where I belong. I said here last January, I wanted to be the ‘Comeback of the year’. I achieved that. When I started this year, I said I wanted to be one of the best players in the world.”In Saturday’s semifinals, Badosa will go up against her friend world No.1 Aryna Sabalenka .In the quarterfinals against the 27th ranked Russian Anastasia Pavyuchenkova, the two-time Australian Open champion Sabalenka, looking for a third successive crown, and fourth major title, scored a 6-2, 2-6, 6-3 win.The 26-year-old Sabalenka leads the head-to-head 5-2 against Badosa, having won their last five meetings, three of which came last year.","World No. 11 Paula Badosa beat Coco Gauff 7-5, 6-4 to reach Australian Open semi-finals.

Rybakina, who has been dogged by injury and illness these last couple of years, expressed unhappiness over her situation after exiting the tournament.“I want to have who I want in the box, but I couldn’t change it,” she said of Vukov not being present in Melbourne. “I just tried to focus on my matches, and I spoke with him. I also have Goran, so it didn’t affect the way I played today or any of the results.”Rybakina, who got off to a slow start against the 19th-seeded American, had battled a lower back injury during her thirdround win, but felt better against Keys benefitting from treatment.The Vukov situation, which has been one of the talking points of the tournament, particularly because the WTA is acting on a complainant on the 37-year-old Croatian coach.","Elena Rybakina's Australian Open campaign came to an end on Monday.

Liverpool secured a dramatic 3-2 victory against Newcastle with a 100th-minute winner from 16-year-old Rio Ngumoha, after squandering a two-goal advantage against 10-man Newcastle in Monday's Premier League match.Liverpool's Ryan Gravenberch and Hugo Ekitike scored goals, with Anthony Gordon receiving a red card for a dangerous tackle on Virgil van Dijk between these strikes.Newcastle mounted a comeback at St. James' Park through goals from Bruno Guimaraes and William Osula, but Ngumoha's late strike, making him Liverpool's youngest-ever goalscorer, sealed the win.""This is also what makes the Premier League special. Maybe it wasn't the best game in terms of tactics or in terms of playing football , but I think every fan everywhere around the world enjoyed watching this game of football,"" said Liverpool manager Arne Slot.Liverpool now shares maximum points from two games with Tottenham and Arsenal, with the latter scheduled to visit Anfield on Sunday. Newcastle remain winless as they continue without Alexander Isak, their key striker.Isak previously scored the winning goal when these teams met in the League Cup final in March, helping Newcastle secure their first domestic trophy in 70 years.The Swedish striker has not played for Newcastle this season as he seeks to leave the club.Liverpool appear to be the likely destination for Isak before the transfer window closes in a week.Newcastle rejected Liverpool's £110 million bid, as they seek a British transfer record fee of £150 million. Newcastle's frustration increased as Liverpool also succeeded in signing Ekitike, whom Newcastle had identified as a potential replacement for Isak.Newcastle's striker shortage was evident in their season opener, a goalless draw against 10-man Aston Villa. The issue persisted during the first 30 minutes of this match, despite Newcastle's dominant play supported by over 50,000 fans.Liverpool took an unexpected lead after 35 minutes through Gravenberch's precise long-range shot. Newcastle's situation worsened when Gordon received a red card for a late tackle on Van Dijk before halftime.Liverpool doubled their lead just 20 seconds into the second half through Ekitike's composed finish from Gakpo's assist. Newcastle's protests intensified when Ibrahima Konate avoided a second yellow card for pushing Harvey Barnes.Guimaraes, despite receiving a booking for protesting, scored for Newcastle with a header past Milos Kerkez. Liverpool failed to capitalize on their numerical advantage throughout the second half.Osula, who had limited playing time under Howe, scored his second Premier League goal from Dan Burn's assist to level the match. The game concluded with Liverpool's decisive counter-attack, as Salah's pass and Szoboszlai's dummy set up Ngumoha for the winning goal just before his 17th birthday.","Liverpool beat Newcastle 3-2 in Premier League match at St. James' Park.

A lighthearted clip, posted by FIDE (the governing body for chess) across their social media platforms, has gone viral after India’s Divya Deshmukh, the 2025 Women’s World Cup champion, was asked which chess rule she would like to change.With a cheeky smile, she replied: “No jeans!” before bursting into laughter, a playful nod to one of the most memorable controversies in recent chess history.Watch:Her answer immediately evoked memories of world No. 1 Magnus Carlsen ’s infamous jeans incident at the 2024 World Rapid Championship in New York.Carlsen had been told by arbiters to swap his size-32 Corneliani jeans for more formal attire in line with the tournament’s dress code.Instead, he refused, accepted a $200 fine, and ultimately forfeited his final round of the day.The bold stance sparked a storm of debate over how much freedom players should have in expressing themselves during competition.Far from fading, the jeans episode has only grown in legend.Earlier this year, the very same pair was auctioned in collaboration with Chess.com, drawing enormous global attention. Initially stuck at $14,100, the bidding exploded in the final 30 minutes, with 29 rapid-fire bids pushing the price up to an astonishing $36,100, all of which Carlsen pledged to donate to charity.The winning bidder, who remains anonymous, also paid $74 in shipping for what is now one of the most famous garments in the chess world.From a rule dispute to a charitable milestone, Carlsen’s jeans have become a quirky yet powerful symbol in chess, and Divya Deshmukh’s playful “no jeans” answer shows the story still resonates in the sport’s culture.","Divya Deshmukh, the 2025 Women’s World Cup champion, was asked which chess rule she would like to change.

Bowled Over by Miya Magic: Mohammed Siraj shines brightest | IND vs ENG 5th Test

Poll Who do you think was the standout player for India in the Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy series? Mohammed Siraj Akash Deep Shubman Gill Jasprit Bumrah

For India’s pace attack, the five-Test Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy in England was as much a battle of stamina as it was of skill. Mohammed Siraj , who featured in all five matches, became the face of that resilience, and his efforts drew glowing praise from teammate Akash Deep.“Siraj bhai is the energyhouse of the team. Everyone will be tired but not him,” Akash told IANS. “On the last day at The Oval, he took responsibility as the leader of the pace attack and delivered. Credit to Siraj bhai and Prasidh for bowling their hearts out.”With Jasprit Bumrah unavailable for two games in the series, Siraj carried the load, sending down long spells across the 25 days of cricket. His fitness had been carefully managed, with the selectors opting to rest him from the Champions Trophy earlier this year to prepare for the marathon tour. Though he missed out on the Player of the Series award, within the Indian camp his presence was viewed as vital to the 2-2 result, which was a rare result in England.Akash Deep, meanwhile, carved out his own special memory at The Oval. Walking in as a nightwatchman late on Day 2, he battled through tricky conditions the next morning to score a fighting 66 off 94 deliveries. His 107-run partnership with Yashasvi Jaiswal proved crucial in stretching India’s lead beyond 150.“This innings will be very close to my heart, with the situation that we were in,” Akash said. “Yashasvi helped me a lot with the batting — he made sure I played fewer balls and guided me well, so credit to him too.”The Bengal pacer also made a mark with the ball, finishing the series with 13 wickets in three Tests, including a 10-wicket haul in Birmingham that kept India alive in the contest.Currently sidelined with a minor injury, Akash is undergoing rehabilitation at the BCCI Centre of Excellence in Bengaluru. “I have been advised rest but I have started my practice and training. I want to be properly fit and when I am ready, I will join the team,” he said.The 28-year-old added that his focus remains on sharpening endurance. “I am working on my fitness and stamina, trying to bowl as many overs as I can. That is the area I need to improve, so bowling long spells with pace is my key for now.”","Mohammed Siraj was the standout player for India in the Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy series.

NEW DELHI: India’s cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar has once again spoken about the DRS rule, saying he would scrap the Umpire’s Call and explained why he believes it no longer serves the game.Cricket has often been considered a complex sport, and the Decision Review System (DRS), introduced in 2009, added another layer of debate with the phrase “Umpire’s Call” becoming a regular talking point.Over the years, while some have backed the rule, many have raised concerns.Tendulkar, who has previously criticised it, reiterated his view.""I would change the DRS rule on the Umpire's call. Players have chosen to go upstairs because they were unhappy with the on-field umpire's call. Hence, there should be no option to go back to that call. Just like how players have bad patches, umpires, too, have bad patches. Technology even when inaccurate will be consistently inaccurate,"" he said during an Ask Me Anything session on Reddit.The Umpire’s Call is used when teams challenge an on-field decision but technology remains inconclusive, leaving the original call intact. In LBW reviews, if 1–50% of the ball is shown hitting the stumps (excluding bails), the umpire’s original verdict stands.Tendulkar, famously known as the ‘Master Blaster’, dominated world cricket from 1989 to 2013, amassing 34,357 runs in 664 international matches at an average of 48.52. He remains the highest run-scorer in international cricket, with 100 centuries and 164 fifties — the only player with a “century of centuries.”",Sachin Tendulkar says he would scrap the DRS rule on the Umpire's Call.

NEW DELHI: India's cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar revisited a special memory, recalling the moment he realised Joe Root was destined to be a major force for England and a future captain. Root made his Test debut on December 13, 2012, against India in Nagpur, a period when Tendulkar was nearing the end of his illustrious career. Watching from close quarters, Sachin was left stunned by the youngster’s composure and technique.With England reeling at 119/4 in the first innings, Root displayed textbook batting and assured footwork against India’s spinners. On his maiden subcontinental outing, he absorbed pressure, faced 229 balls, and scored 73 crucial runs to take England to 330. His knock helped secure a draw, sealing England’s historic 2-1 Test series win in India.Since then, Root has only grown in stature, becoming England’s Test captain in 2017 after Alastair Cook’s retirement and leading until 2022.""To have gone past 13,000 Test runs is a remarkable achievement, and he is still going strong. When I saw him for the first time in Nagpur in 2012 during his debut Test, I told my teammates that they were watching the future captain of England. What impressed me most was the way he was able to assess the wicket and how he rotated the strike.I knew at that very moment that he would be a big player,"" Sachin wrote during a Q&A session on Reddit.In the inaugural Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy, Root crossed 13,000 Test runs, closing in on Sachin’s record tally of 15,921. With 13,543 runs to his name, he now needs 2,378 more to match the Indian great. Root will aim to narrow that gap in England’s next Test series — the Ashes against Australia, starting November 21 in Perth.","Sachin Tendulkar recalls the moment he realised Joe Root was destined to be a major force for England and a future captain.

Poll Which bowling attack do you think is more formidable? West Indies Australia

Cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar delighted fans on Monday as he hosted a Reddit Ask Me Anything (AMA) session, answering questions about his illustrious career and the sport at large.Known for his calm and composed demeanour, the 52-year-old surprised many with a humorous reply when a fan tried to settle a classic cricket debate. The user asked him to choose between the West Indies bowling attack and Australia’s.Instead of picking a side, Tendulkar flipped the question back with a rather humorous question. “Why? Are you intending to play them?” he wrote, sparking laughter among participants.During the session, Tendulkar also spoke at length about some memorable moments from his career. Asked about his favourite innings, he chose the knock against England in Chennai in 2008.He recalled instances of taking calculated risks to disrupt opposition bowlers, citing one particular duel. “Yes on many occasions I have played risky shots to break the bowler's rhythm. The one that comes to my mind is against McGrath at Nairobi in 2000,” he explained.The former India captain also confirmed one of Indian cricket’s most-discussed tactical calls, which was promoting MS Dhoni ahead of Yuvraj Singh in the 2011 World Cup final.“There were two reasons. The left-right batting combination would have upset the two off-spinners. Also, Muralitharan had played for CSK (from 2008–2010) and MS had played him for three seasons in the nets,” Tendulkar said.The move turned out to be decisive, with Dhoni finishing unbeaten on 91 to seal India’s historic win over Sri Lanka in Mumbai.Through his candid answers, mix of humour, and nostalgia, Tendulkar’s session turned into a memorable interaction for fans across generations, giving them a rare chance to ask their own questions to the icon.",Sachin Tendulkar hosted a Reddit Ask Me Anything (AMA) session on Monday.

From cricketing memories to thoughts on the present-day game, the session sparked a wave of nostalgia and insightful exchanges.One fan revisited a famous comment Tendulkar made more than a decade ago, when he predicted that Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma would carry his legacy forward. The fan asked, “You had said around 2010 that Kohli & Rohit will carry your legacy and you were bang on. Now who do you feel is well suited to carry it further?”Tendulkar responded warmly: “Yes! Virat and Rohit have made India proud on many occasions. Indian cricket is in good hands and they played well in England. There are many contenders to take the legacy forward.”Both Kohli and Rohit have often acknowledged Tendulkar’s influence on their careers. The most iconic moment came after India’s 2011 World Cup triumph, when Kohli and his teammates carried Tendulkar on their shoulders in a tribute that became a symbol of the transition of eras in Indian cricket.Today, with both Kohli and Rohit having retired from T20Is and Test cricket, their focus has shifted solely to the ODI format.Fans now await their return to action, eager to watch the duo anchor India’s batting once again.ALSO READ: Did Arjun Tendulkar get engaged to Saaniya Chandhok?

Poll Would you like to see more radical changes in cricket's scoring system? Absolutely, shake things up! No, the current system is fine

Former England cricketer Kevin Pietersen has once again suggested a radical change to cricket’s scoring system, suggesting that massive sixes should be worth more than the traditional maximum.Posting on X, the 45-year-old wrote: “I’ve said it before and I will say it again, if a batter hits a six that is over 100m, 12 runs should be added to the score! More batters will try and with more batters trying, more entertainment.”The proposal triggered mixed reactions from fans. While some dismissed it as impractical, others backed the idea, agreeing that it could increase excitement in the game. One user even quipped that bowlers too deserved a reward: “If a bowler hits the middle stump, the next batter in line should also lose his wicket. This will encourage more bowlers to try and bowl yorkers.”Pietersen has been an active voice on social media, frequently engaging with followers and weighing in on cricket debates. He was part of the Delhi Capitals setup as a mentor in the 2025 season.The former England star also made headlines recently when an old clip from 2014 resurfaced, showing him poking fun at pop icon Taylor Swift after she confused cricket with rugby.While his 12-run idea is unlikely to find favour with cricket’s lawmakers, it has certainly sparked the kind of entertainment Pietersen himself advocates for.While the scoring system is yet to undergo an overhaul, ICC will implement a rule change from October 2026 affecting boundaries. The ""one-touch"" rule for airborne boundary catches means that a fielder can make only one contact with the ball while airborne outside the boundary and must then land inside the boundary. This prevents ""bunny hop"" catches where a player uses multiple airborne touches to stay in play, with any subsequent airborne contact after the first resulting in a boundary",Kevin Pietersen has suggested a change to cricket's scoring system.

The All India Football Federation (AIFF) and Football Sports Development Limited (FSDL) on Monday held discussions, as directed by the Supreme Court, to determine the path forward for the 2025-26 football season.In a joint statement issued after the meeting, AIFF said both parties “approached the discussions in a constructive and positive spirit and expressed confidence in arriving at a mutually agreed proposal that will ensure the continued development and progress of football in India.”The outcome of the talks will now be placed before the Supreme Court on August 28. “The joint proposal will be submitted before the Hon’ble Supreme Court on August 28.

Arsenal forward Bukayo Saka is expected to be out of action for around a month after suffering a hamstring injury in the Premier League win over Leeds United last Saturday.The 23-year-old, who was forced off during the game at the Emirates, will not feature in Sunday’s trip to Liverpool. His absence will also rule him out of England’s upcoming World Cup qualifiers against Andorra and Serbia.There is some relief for the club, however, with medical staff confident that the injury will not be a repeat of last season’s setback when Saka missed three months with a similar problem.Arsenal’s concerns are not limited to Saka. Captain Martin Odegaard is battling to be fit after hurting his shoulder in the same match. The midfielder was substituted in the first half and later left the ground with his arm in a sling. Although the 26-year-old has not been officially ruled out of facing Liverpool, his involvement remains uncertain.The Gunners’ summer recruitment may help ease the pressure. Viktor Gyokeres, Noni Madueke and Eberechi Eze were all added to strengthen the attack, while Gabriel Martinelli, Leandro Trossard, Ethan Nwaneri and teenager Max Dowman provide further depth.Manager Mikel Arteta will hope that both Saka and Odegaard can return soon, but the squad’s depth means Arsenal are better placed to cope with injuries than they were in previous campaigns.",Bukayo Saka is expected to be out of action for around a month.

Everton marked the opening of their new home at Bramley-Moore Dock with a 2-0 win over Brighton on Sunday, a match that also saw Jack Grealish deliver a standout performance on his first Premier League start for the club.On loan from Manchester City, Grealish provided two assists, which was surprisingly as many as he managed across the last two league campaigns combined at City. His first came after a weaving run into the box, setting up Iliman Ndiaye to volley in the opener. The goal carried symbolic weight as well, with Ndiaye having scored Everton’s final goal at Goodison Park before the shift to the new home stadium.Grealish’s influence continued when he laid the ball off for James Garner, whose long-range strike sealed the result. The 29-year-old, once touted to become the face of English football, showed signs of rediscovering his former self in his new chapter in an Everton shirt.Grealish, who was subbed on in the 71st minute of the season opener last week wasted no time in showing just how good he is when he's firing on all cylinders.The afternoon also brought a moment for Jordan Pickford, who denied Danny Welbeck from the spot. The England goalkeeper again used his trademark tactic of consulting his water bottle, which lists opposition penalty tendencies, before diving to make the stop. His save kept Brighton at bay and saw the 51,759 supporters in the new stadium erput in celebration.The victory was Everton’s first of the season after their opening defeat to Leeds, offering a much needed kick to the start of a new chapter for the club and its fans.",Jack Grealish won Player of the Match in Everton's 2-0 win over Brighton.

How the three World Champions fared in Formula E Season 11

Days after Oliver Rowland lifted his Formula E World Championship trophy in London this season, an interesting trend has come to the attention of Formula E and its fans. As a coincidence, all Formula E drivers who won the Mexico City E-Prix went on to win the Formula E World Championship that season, and this has been proved right for three consecutive years.Highlighting the same since 2023, a poster of three World Champions was shared on X by Formula E with the caption, “The trend continues. Each winner of the #MexicoCityEPrix from the past three seasons has gone on to become World Champion.”The special poster features 2023 Formula E World Champion Jake Dennis from Andretti, then TAG Heuer Porsche’s Pascal Wehrlein, who won in 2024, and the new World Champion, Nissan driver Oliver Rowland. All three of them won in the Mexico E-Prix and went on to lift the winner’s trophy in the Formula E World Championship that year.Oliver Rowland had strengthened his chances of winning the Formula E World Championship this year much earlier. He was leading the Formula E Driver Standings ever since he won Part 2 of the Jeddah E-Prix, which was his second win of the season after winning the Mexico E-Prix. In the last leg, the Nissan driver got nervous for a while as Pascal Wehrlein, who was following him in the number two position, closed the gap after grabbing quite a few podiums while Rowland had a dull period.Things became serious for Rowland when he failed to finish the Round 13 race in Berlin, while Wehrlein won second spot on the podium. But he eventually managed to confirm his championship in Berlin after four wins and three more podiums.Sharing about his bad race in Berlin, Rowland had said, “I was hoping before the weekend that the outcome could be [the World Championship], but after yesterday (Saturday) and this morning (Sunday), I was more worried that it might never come.”Also Read: Oliver Rowland reacts to daughter’s sweet radio message after Formula E Championship win: “It’s amazing” Things, however, changed for Wehrlein, who was pushed to third position after Nick Cassidy made a late entry in the Formula E Driver Standings by registering three consecutive wins.

Wehrlein registered one win and five more podiums this season.Meanwhile, Andretti driver Jake Dennis finished in seventh position in the Formula E Driver Standings.

Taylor Barnard on losing top three spot in Formula E World Championship

Fans hail Taylor Barnard for his fantastic rookie season

It was Taylor Barnard’s rookie season this year, and the NEOM McLaren driver put up a fantastic performance by temporarily making it to the top three in the Formula E Driver Standings by ousting the much more experienced Porsche driver Antonio Felix Da Costa. He was, however, ousted from the top three at the London E-Prix as Jaguar’s Nick Cassidy went on to register three consecutive wins. Barnard took to Instagram to share his feelings on losing out on the top three in his first-ever season and his claim to the championship.Taking to Instagram after the London E-Prix, Barnard wrote, “London wasn’t what we hoped for, easily being the toughest weekend of our season. Taking 0 points away as a team from a doubleheader hurts, but one weekend doesn’t define the year we’ve had.”He further wrote, “As the season closes, I want to say a massive thank you to the entire team, both trackside and behind the scenes, for everything this season. Finishing P4 in the Drivers’ Championship and coming into the final weekend with a shot at runner-up is something to be proud of.”Also adding a note for teammate Sam Bird, as NEOM McLaren withdrew from Formula E after the end of the season, Barnard wrote, “@sambird_official it wasn’t the weekend you deserved either.You’ve been a huge part of my season both on and off the track, and I’m grateful for everything. You deserved more. To all the Papaya fans, thank you for the incredible support in our final race together. You always go above and beyond. ”Reacting to his post, a fan wrote, “An incredible debut season, huge congrats and excited to see where you go next!” Another said, “I know I said it the other day, but you’ve been incredible to watch this last year and a pleasure to support you in Papaya — there are many of us that can’t wait to support you in whatever you do next!” One more commented, “You were incredible all season around, Taylor. Massive congratulations. You are the future of this sport.”Recalling Barnard’s maiden pole, a fan also wrote, “Fantastic season, Taylor, we'll never forget that Monaco pole.”Also Read: Taylor Barnard looks back at rookie season at McLaren: “Every step has been unforgettable” Barnard claimed five podiums in his first full season in Formula E.

Through the early days, the good days, the bad days, and the great days, we have always felt an overwhelming amount of support from you all.”For the partners associated with the team, he wrote, “They say that ‘racing is a state of mind’, and since its inception, this team has had the privilege of working for organisations, with partners, and racing for fans who fully embrace this philosophy.This is certainly true of those at McLaren, whose passion for racing is second to none.”“My heartfelt thanks go out to everyone who has been involved: those at McLaren who backed us, the fans who supported us, and the partners who allowed us to go racing. We couldn’t have done it without you all — your trust and support have never been taken for granted,” he added.Praising the two McLaren drivers, he wrote, “Sam clinched McLaren’s first-ever fully electric win at the São Paulo E-Prix in Season 10, pulling off one of Formula E’s all-time great overtakes, before being waved across the line by none other than Emerson Fittipaldi – McLaren's first Formula 1 World Champion. While Taylor has been a rookie sensation in Season 11, securing five Formula E records, including the youngest driver to start a race, the youngest points scorer, the youngest driver to lead a lap, the youngest podium finisher, and the youngest polesitter. ”He ended the letter saying, “Some of us have been together since the day we first launched this team, while others have seamlessly fitted in along the way and flourished within the environment we have cultivated. For many, I am sure that we will cross paths again soon, but whatever the future holds for those here at Bicester, whatever path they choose to follow, I have no doubt that it will be bright.

How do Formula E and ABB work together?

What do ABB and Formula E say about the partnership?

After a successful Season 11, ABB and Formula E have announced that they will continue their partnership in the upcoming season. This gives ABB another opportunity to promote its new brand positioning via the ABB FIA Formula E World Championship, along with technologies that help industries take a cleaner route.Over a period of eight seasons, the partnership with Formula E has provided ABB a platform to showcase how technology can help industries outrun challenges, engage with customers around the world, and implement its own solutions into the series to improve reliability and efficiency. The partnership extension will provide a year-round opportunity for brand-building and activation, communicating ABB and its technology solutions to new global audiences, including Formula E’s international fanbase.ABB and Formula E will also join hands to engage a new generation of fans, collaborating with unexpected influencers and content creators to tell compelling stories that make advanced electrification and automation technologies tangible and exciting.The end of the mid-race car swap, a 150kW increase in power, top speeds that are 43 percent higher, and energy recovery increasing from 15 to 50 percent indicate how far Formula E technology has come to outperform on track.ABB has also built on its technical involvement in the series, supplying the race chargers from Season 9, and introducing its ABB Ability OPTIMAX® energy management software (Season 9) and Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) technology (Season 5) to the sport.ABB Head of Brand Paco Liebrand said, “We are pleased to be continuing our partnership with Formula E which, like ABB, is striving for a leaner and cleaner future. The synergy between the two organizations, combined with the global appeal of the Championship, makes it a great platform to promote our brand positioning.”He further said, “Formula E is increasingly working with content creators, influencers, and celebrities, with initiatives such as the Evo Sessions making an impact through digital channels beyond the racing itself, which is also an essential part of ABB’s new brand strategy. Going forward, we will be enhancing the way we harness the benefits of this collaboration, ensuring the focus is on delivering content and activations that reinforce our new messaging, build familiarity, and tell the ‘Engineered to Outrun’ story. ”Formula E Chief Revenue Officer Tiziana Di Gioia said, “Our renewed partnership with ABB is a testament to the commercial power and benefit of Formula E as a global platform that drives both brand and business growth. ABB, like our wider partnership portfolio, has and continues to see enormous value in collaborating with the fastest-growing motorsport on the planet, with viewership, commercial integration, and brand storytelling continuing to accelerate. Over eight seasons, ABB has moved from brand visibility to brand activation—integrating deeply into the fan experience, the sport’s ecosystem, and our innovation narrative.Also Read: Antonio Felix Da Costa shares happy memories as Porsche wins Formula E Teams and Manufacturers’ World Championships “This next chapter elevates the partnership even further. With ABB’s new positioning, we are co-creating opportunities across content, digital storytelling, and market engagement, transforming a title partnership into a year-round, value-generating relationship.

NEW YORK: With the Sampaguita, the Philippines’ national flower in her hair, Alexandra Eala carries on her young shoulders the soaring expectations of her people.The 20-year-old, the season’s breakthrough player, ranked 75 in the world, trailed the 14th seed Clara Tauson 1-5 in the third set of their US Open first-round match. But with the capacity crowd on Grandstand Court behind her Eala dug deep to script a daring comeback. She closed the 6-3, 2-6, 7-6 (13-11) win on her fifth match point to become the first player from the Philippines to win a Grand Slam main draw match in the Open Era.At the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center on Sunday, Filipino fans packed the Grandstand, using admission rights for ground pass holders to fill the upper tiers. They lived every minute of the match with their 5 ft 9’ rockstar.Some 236,000 Filipinos reside in the New York City metropolitan area and in the closing stages of the two-hour 36-minute match it appeared like all of them were in the stadium.“I take so much pride in representing my country,” Eala said in her on-court interaction. “I don’t have a home tournament, so to be able to have this community here in the US Open… I’m so grateful they made me feel like I’m home.Eala’s 2025 season has put the Philippines on the global tennis map. She announced her arrival on the world stage at the Miami Open, which she entered as a wildcard, ranked 140 in the world. She beat Jelena Ostapenko, Madison Keys, Paula Badosa and Iga Swiatek en route to the semifinals of the WTA 1000, an electrifying run that catapulted her into the WTA Top 100 for the first time. A couple of months later, she reached her maiden WTA final at Eastbourne.There was drama at every turn in the first-round clash, with the spectators playing a major role in the contest. The crowd roared at Tauson’s errors, and as Eala fought back in the final set, she drew strength from their energy, rallying them even after unforced errors from her opponent.During the tenth game of the final set, Tauson requested a video review, arguing that Eala’s racket had crossed the net as she put away a volley. The 20-year-old, whose execution was perfect, didn’t concern herself with the exchange between her opponent and the umpire. She lingered near the baseline, preferring to run through shadow swings.In person, Eala appears younger than her 20 years and slighter than her 5-foot-9 frame suggests. Face scrubbed clean and without a trace of makeup, she tucked her hair behind her ears as she sat down for her post-match media conference.“It comes down to experience,” Eala said of her ability to keep calm in tight situations. “Although I'm at the start of my WTA career, I've played so many matches, and tight matches and tense moments can happen at any level. I've been playing since I was 4. I'm 20 now, so that's 16 years of experience, whether it's at the junior level, 10-and-under level or professional level. I think that mental strength and focus are the keys to come out victorious in those moments. ”Eala now awaits the winner of the first-round match between American qualifier Claire Liu and Spain’s Cristina BucsaEala is joined in the second round by another player from the region, Indonesia’s 23-year-old Janice Tjen who defeated the 24th seed Veronika Kudermetova 6-4, 4-6, 6-4. The qualifier faces Briton’s Emma Raducanu in the second round.","Alexandra Eala is the first player from the Philippines to win a Grand Slam main draw match in the Open Era.

NEW YORK: Daniil Medvedev was on the verge of a straight-sets exit from the US Open, facing match point against the 51st-ranked Benjamin Bonzi, when he chose to become the conductor of chaos at the Louis Armstrong Stadium. The mercurial former world No. 1 berated the chair umpire and incited the crowd, triggering a night of bedlam.Bonzi was preparing for his second serve at 6-3, 7-5, 5-4, when a photographer strolled into the arena. Chair umpire Greg Allensworth asked the cameraman to leave the court before announcing that, due to on-site interference, a first serve would be granted to the Frenchman.Medvedev wasn’t happy and the crowd exploded, booing Allensworth’s decision. The 29-year-old, champion here in 2021, gestured for more as he moved towards the chair. “Don’t shake,” he instructed Allensworth before asking, “Are you a man? Why are you shaking? So what’s wrong? And it’s a first serve? Ah, you want to go home?”Medvedev then turned and started speaking into a courtside camera. “He wants to go home, guys. He gets paid by match not by the hour,” he said and before delivering his punchline. ‘What did Reilly Opelka say?’ The Russian shouted into a night that had changed in mood and colour.Opelka had been critical of Allensworth’s umpiring in a tournament earlier this year.The match came to a six-minute standstill amid a chorus of jeers, whistles, and boos, as the crowd refused to settle even when Bonzi prepared to serve.The interruption put Medvedev back in the match. He fought off the match point and broke Bonzi in the tenth game. Bonzi, who appeared out of sorts in the fourth set, taking a medical timeout, rallied to clinch a tight fifth set for a 6-3, 7-5, 6-7, 0-6, 6-4 win.“Every time there is a sound from the stands between serves, there is never a second serve,” Medvedev contested in his post-match conference. “Delay from the photographer was probably for four-seconds-and-a-half. I'm not sure it's enough for a second serve. But it helped me get back into the match. I was not upset with the photographer. I was upset with the decision.”“I think (if) the referee didn’t say anything, he would have made the second serve and probably won the point, and the match is over. (But) he says first serve,” Medvedev said. “What I say and what I do… In my head, I want to do worse, (but) I cannot because there are rules, because we're on a tennis court.”“I just expressed my emotions, my unhappiness with the decision,” Medvedev said, “then the crowd did what they did without me asking them too much. It was fun to witness.”Medvedev, whose on-court antics bordered on bullying, blew heart emojis to a crowd that was wild for him.“I love them. Love New York. They did the work. I didn't do anything,” he said. “They pushed me to come back into the match. I said, Reilly. Whatever I said, I don't even remember, but it was fun for me.”Medvedev, the first former champion to exit this year’s tournament, leaves Flushing Meadows after a disappointing year at the majors where he managed to get to the second round just once in Australia in January.“I'm playing bad and in important moments, even worse,” he said. “Serve, return, volley, whatever. Just need to play better, and I'm going to try to do it next year.”The 29-year-old Bonzi said he had never experienced anything like it on a tennis court.“It's very difficult in tennis to play when you don't hear the sound of the ball, of the strokes,” he said. “I was in a great position, it was a match point. Every time I went on the line to serve everyone was booing. I didn't do anything.”“Daniil started it, he put oil on the fire,” the Frenchman said. “He went crazy with the crowd, he went with them.”",Daniil Medvedev was on the verge of a straight-sets exit from the US Open.

A historic Sunday start for the US Open, first time in the tournament's history, also was a moment to savour for two players from tiny Asian nations of Indonesia and Philippines.First, Qualifier Janice Tjen, ranked World No. 149, defeated 24th seed Veronika Kudermetova in a thriller that lasted 2 hours and 11 minutes, with Tjen winning 6-4, 4-6, 6-4, marking the first victory by an Indonesian player at a major tournament in over two decades.The breakthrough performance puts Tjen in the record books as she follows in the footsteps of Angelique Widjaja, who was the last Indonesian player to win a match at a major tournament. Widjaja achieved her victory at the 2004 US OpenTjen had already created a milestone for herself and her country by progressing to the main draw.“It means a lot,” she said. “I feel proud to be able to do this for my country. Hopefully like this, by me making appearance here, will help, will inspire more tennis player, like, younger kids to play tennis and also, like, believing that, like, they can be here too.”“I think I am pretty happy with how I played today, being able to execute everything that me and my coaches have planned. Pretty satisfied with it.”Ironically, Tjen, who considers 2021 US Open champion Emma Raducanu as her inspiration, will meet the Briton in the next round.“It’s going to be — well, my first thought is just, like, it’s going to be a big crowd, I would say, a bigger crowd playing against her,” Tjen said. “She’s a very well-known player and I’m just excited for the opportunity.”Later in the day, Alexandra Eala came from 1-5 down in the third set and converted her fifth match point opportunity to beat World No. 14 Clara Tauson. In the process, she became the first Filipino to win a singles Grand Slam match in the Open Era.Eala is not new to being in the headlines. She had gone on a rampaging run at the Miami Open in March where she beat multiple former major champions - Jelena Ostapenko, Madison Keys and Iga Swiatek - before falling to Jessica Pegula.The 20-year-old was making her first US Open appearance since turning pro. Though she's not new to the energy of New York having been crowned the junior singles champion in 2022.“It was so, so difficult,” Eala said in her post-match interview. “[Clara is] a huge player, she’s a great player. Definitely not an easy draw for a first round, but I’m so happy that I was able to dig deep. I was just thinking to push the limit physically, mentally… this was it.”Eala will play the winner of the first round match between Cristina Bucsa and Claire Liu.",Indonesia's Janice Tjen defeated Veronika Kudermetova in the first round of the US Open.

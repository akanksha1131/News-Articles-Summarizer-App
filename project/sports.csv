Handshake drama becomes ugly! India vs Pakistan Asia Cup 2025 in DANGER?

In a fresh development, it is understood that ICC match referee Andy Pycroft could well be ""rested"" for the match between Pakistan and UAE scheduled for Wednesday at the Dubai International Stadium.TimesofIndia.com has learnt that Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) was adamant on having Pycroft removed for the entire tournament and while that seems unlikely, there is a bright possibility of the seasoned official missing from action today.The PCB had threatened to pull out after blaming Pycroft for the ""no handshake"" furore that followed the game against India. Pakistan also cancelled their pre-match press conference scheduled for Wednesday.""Pakistan will play the tournament, but Andy Pycroft will not be officiating the match against the UAE,"" a PCB source told TimesofIndia.com.It is still not clear whether Pycroft would continue to officiate in Pakistan's remaining matches, as ACC is yet to revert to TimesofIndia.com query. The story will be updated the moment the cricket body responds.“The PCB has lodged a complaint with the ICC regarding violations by the Match Referee of the ICC Code of Conduct and the MCC Laws pertaining to the Spirit of Cricket.The PCB has demanded an immediate removal of the Match Referee from the Asia Cup,” Naqvi, who is also the president of the Asian Cricket Council (ACC), had said in a post, which he later deleted.Pycroft has officiated in more than 100 Tests and has been part of several flashpoints, notably the ball-tampering episode under Steve Smith’s leadership, Virat Kohli ’s shoulder clash with Sam Konstas, and Jos Buttler’s heated outburst at Vernon Philander.He represented Zimbabwe in only three Tests and 20 ODIs. His Test debut came in Harare against India, where he made 39 and 46 in the two innings, a match that also marked Zimbabwe’s maiden Test, though Pycroft was already past his peak. Nearly a decade earlier, he had debuted in ODIs during the 1983 World Cup, featuring in the famous game where Kapil Dev struck his iconic 175.India and Pakistan on Tuesday trained at the ICC Academy. While the time slots were different, the two teams were together at the same venue for around an hour.India have already qualified for the Super Four.

Handshake drama becomes ugly! India vs Pakistan Asia Cup 2025 in DANGER?

NEW DELHI: After Suryakumar Yadav 's no-handshake gesture following the India vs Pakistan Asia Cup 2025 Group A game, reactions have been coming in thick and fast. The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) and its players were miffed by what Suryakumar did, but none stooped to the level of former Pakistan player Mohammad Yousuf. The former batter, with over 17,000 international runs, repeatedly used a derogatory word for Suryakumar during a discussion about the handshake row on a Pakistani TV channel. Even the anchor was shocked and kept correcting him, but Yousuf continued to use the cuss word for Yadav.“India are unable to get out of their filmy world. India should be ashamed of the way they are trying to win—using umpires, torturing (Pakistan) through the match referee. It is a high note,” said Yousuf on Samaa TV. He then started using the cuss word for Suryakumar.Social media users fumed over the comment made by Yousuf, who played 288 ODIs, 90 Tests, and 3 T20Is for Pakistan between 1998 and 2010.After facing severe backlash, Yousuf took to social media and cleared his stance.""I didn’t mean any disrespect to any sportsman who plays for his country with passion and grace, but why were the Indian media and people praising Irfan Pathan when he said that Shahid Afridi was barking like a dog? Shouldn’t that have been rejected by everyone who talks about dignity and respect?,"" Yousuf said.Amid worsening ties between the two neighbouring nations after the terror attack in Pahalgam on April 22, which claimed 26 innocent lives, a new controversy has erupted in the world of cricket.Despite the backlash and calls for a boycott of the India-Pakistan fixture at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium on Sunday, the game went ahead and has been surrounded by controversy. India won the match by seven wickets.However, the Indian players refused to shake hands with their counterparts after securing the thumping win in Dubai.The handshake row escalated after the PCB lodged a complaint against match referee Andy Pycroft, accusing him of violating the International Cricket Council (ICC) Code of Conduct and the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) laws relating to the spirit of cricket.Pakistan also threatened to pull out of the tournament.However, as reported by TimesofIndia.com, it is highly unlikely that the PCB will actually withdraw from the ongoing tournament. If Pakistan fail to take the field against United Arab Emirates on Wednesday, they will be eliminated from the Asia Cup. They currently have two points from one win and one loss, and must beat UAE to secure a place in the Super Four stage.",Suryakumar Yadav made no-handshake gesture following the India vs Pakistan Asia Cup 2025 Group A game.

Handshake drama becomes ugly! India vs Pakistan Asia Cup 2025 in DANGER?

The group stage of the Asia Cup 2025 has moved into a tense phase with only a few games left to decide the Super 4 line-up.In Group B, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Afghanistan are battling for the two qualification spots, while Hong Kong are already out after three defeats. Bangladesh boosted their chances with a crucial win over Afghanistan in Abu Dhabi, which took them level on points with Sri Lanka.Sri Lanka currently sit at the top with four points from two matches. Bangladesh also have four points but have played all their games. Afghanistan, with two points, still have one match left against Sri Lanka. That clash has now become a virtual knockout. If Sri Lanka win, they will advance alongside Bangladesh. But if Afghanistan manage to beat Sri Lanka, all three teams will finish on four points. In that case, net run rate will decide the two sides that go through.This is where Bangladesh are at risk. Their net run rate is -0.270, compared to Afghanistan’s +2.150 and Sri Lanka’s +1.546. If Afghanistan win, Bangladesh are almost certain to be knocked out despite having four points.In Group A, India have already secured their place in the Super 4 with two convincing wins.They brushed aside UAE inside 18 overs before easing past Pakistan by seven wickets. Oman have been eliminated after back-to-back defeats.This leaves the Pakistan vs UAE match on September 17 as a straight shootout for the second spot. A win for Pakistan will take them through with India. If UAE pull off an upset, they will qualify instead. A tie or no result would bring net run rate into play, with Pakistan currently ahead of UAE.","The group stage of the Asia Cup 2025 has moved into a tense phase with only a few games left to decide the Super 4 line-up.

India have already secured a spot in the Super 4 stage of the Asia Cup 2025, but former cricketer and commentator Aakash Chopra has suggested an interesting idea: why not send an India A team as well?Chopra explained that Afghanistan, considered the second-best team in Asia after India, are struggling with their batting in the tournament. “Bangladesh is still alive after beating Afghanistan, but Afghanistan are finding it tough to bat. The bowling is fine, fielding is okay, but the batting is the problem,” he said.Chopra also compared India’s setup with Pakistan. He noted that Pakistan’s batting lineup is weaker than India’s second string. “If you compare Pakistan’s batting with India A, our second team is probably stronger. Pakistan doesn’t really have match-winners across the board like we do,” he said.He drew parallels with Australia’s past strategy, where Australia A participated in a quadrangular series in 1994 alongside the main team. The Australia A side went on to beat England and Zimbabwe, reaching the final. Chopra believes a similar approach could benefit India, giving match practice and exposure to young players while maintaining a strong main team.He suggested a strong India A squad could include players like Shreyas Iyer Ruturaj Gaikwad , Rajat Patidar, KL Rahul, Rishabh Pant, Yashasvi Jaiswal , Mohammed Siraj, Mohammed Shami, Ravi Bishnoi, and Yuzvendra Chahal. Chopra believes this would give India an edge and help develop future match-winners.Chopra also highlighted that India’s current senior team is dominant in both batting and bowling, but giving exposure to a second team could ensure that talented players don’t miss out due to limited slots.","India have already secured a spot in the Super 4 stage of the Asia Cup 2025.

Q. After your heartbreak at the 2024 Paris Olympics, where you lost in the round-of-32 (opening round), how did you manage to recover mentally?

Q. What changes did you bring in your training and strategic approach for this turnaround in just under one year’s time?

Q. How was your world championship experience? You beat some of the best in the world en route to your gold medal. There were former Olympic medallists, world championships medallists in your draw. Share your thought processes during the tournament.

Q. You have lost to boxers who have been shorter in height in the past, how did you get your height and reach work to your advantage this time around?

Q. You won the world championship gold in an Olympic weight category, none of the other Indian medals are in Olympic weight divisions, is the Olympics your next target? What would be your approach in the next couple of years?

New Delhi: For Jaismine Lamboria , the World Boxing Championships in Liverpool was more than just a gold medal triumph in the 57kg category — it was a stirring comeback story. Barely a year ago, she endured the heartbreak of a first-round exit at the Paris Olympics, a setback that could have derailed many careers.Instead, Jaismine chose resilience, reinventing her training, sharpening her strategic discipline and embracing a renewed mental edge. In this interview, she reflects on her transformation, the defining moments from Liverpool and how she is charting a path towards the LA Olympics with fresh purpose and vision.I was really disappointed and a little bit disturbed in my mind after the Paris Olympics. But then the Indian Army played a big role in restoring my motivation level for the sport. There is a book by Vickrant Mahajan called 'Goal is Gold', I read that cover-to-cover and that was very stimulating and inspiring. How an athlete becomes a champion and inculcates positivity in themselves. I also attended the positivity classes that's arranged for us daily and it has made a massive impact in my approach and thinking processes while I am participating in a tournament.For the last year, I have been training at the Army Sports Institute in Pune. Our Army coaches Chhote Lal sir and Ehetaj sir have worked on my strength, movement inside the ring, power in my punches and counterpunching ability. There were some technical changes too, I tightened my guard, worked on my strategy when and how to release my combination punches. Also, my personal coaches Sandeep and Parminder Lamboria have guided and supported me.In the past, I often came very close to winning medals but couldn’t finish on top. I used to take a lot of pressure, and when things didn’t go my way, I regretted it later. That pattern kept repeating, I kept losing, kept coming back, worked hard and tried again. From the Nationals things changed and I carried it to the World Cup. At the World Championships, I went in with a clear mindset: no pressure. That was the biggest learning from my earlier losses, and it made all the difference.Another turning point was when BFI advised me to shift from 60kg to 57kg. They explained how it would benefit me, and I trusted their guidance. Looking back now, I feel really happy that I made that change because it has played a big role in my success. Winning the gold at the World Championships after beating some of the best in the world felt like everything I had learned and worked for finally came together.At the international level, like the Commonwealth Games, I had to settle for a bronze and even in other big tournaments like the Asian Championships and Paris events I couldn’t do much. Initially, my style was about back-paddling; I lacked aggression. But I worked on every part of my game, especially on how to use my height and reach to my advantage and develop my attacking approach.Now that I have made my comeback with a gold, it feels very satisfying. My training will be directed towards that (getting an Olympic medal), and my coaches will work accordingly on my technical training.","Jaismine Lamboria won gold in the 57kg category at the World Boxing Championships in Liverpool.

Pakistan threaten to pull out, ICC unlikely to budge



India beat Pakistan convincingly in their Asia Cup clash on Sunday.

India delivered a brutal, and effective, response to Pakistan on the field during the Asia Cup encounter on Sunday. Led by Suryakumar Yadav, India clinched a convincing 7-wicket win with 25 balls to spare at the Dubai International Stadium. A day later, India booked their place in the Super 4s stage while Pakistan are currently in a limbo over their Asia Cup future.In the blockbuster clash, Pakistan won the toss and opted to bat and were reduced to 6/2 vs India. A 39-run partnership between Sahibzada Farhan (40 in 44 balls) and Fakhar Zaman (17 in 15 balls) stabilised the innings momentarily, but India reduced Pakistan to 97/8 on the back of a stifling spin-bowling display. A late blitz from Shaheen Shah Afridi (33* in 16 balls, with four sixes) steered them to a competitive, yet below par, 127/9 in 20 overs.Kuldeep Yadav (3/18) was the pick of the bowlers, with Axar Patel (2/18) and Jasprit Bumrah (2/28) also among the wickets. Hardik Pandya, who had delivered the early blow, finished with one wicket while leaking runs in the final over.During the run-chase, India lost two wickets in the powerplay, with Abhishek Sharma's fine cameo of 31 in 13 balls (four fours and two sixes) giving India a solid start. Later, a 56-run stand between Suryakumar Yadav (47* in 37 balls, with five fours and a six) and Tilak Varma (31 in 31 balls, with two fours) brought back some stability.Suryakumar Yadav then raced the India team off to the win, with Shivam Dube (10*) at the other end, delivering a maximum to get the job done with seven wickets and 25 balls left.After finishing off the 128-run chase, India captain Suryakumar Yadav and Shivam Dube walked off the field without shaking hands with their Pakistani counterparts or the opposition support staff, which is customary. As Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha, his teammates and coach Mike Hesson made their way towards the Indian dressing room, they found the door shut , much to their displeasure.In the post-match presentation, Suryakumar Yadav expressed solidarity with Pahalgam terror attack victims and dedicated the win to the Indian Armed Forces, most notably the launch of Operation Sindoor in the aftermath of April's Pahalgam terror attacks.""Just wanted to say something. Perfect occasion, taking the time out, we stand by the families of the victims of the Pahalgam terror attack. We express our solidarity. Want to dedicate the win to all our armed forces who showed a lot of bravery. Hope they continue to inspire us all, and we give them more reasons on the ground whenever we get an opportunity to make them smile,"" Suryakumar said after the win in the post-match interview.In the press-conference that followed, on being asked on handshake being against the spirit of the game, Suryakumar replied, ""I feel a few things in life are ahead of sportsman spirit. I have told it at the presentation as well. We stand with all the victims of the Pahalagam terror attack. We stand with their families also and express our solidarity. As I said, we dedicate this win to our brave armed forces who took part in Operation Sindoor. As they continue to inspire us all, we will try our best to, whenever given the opportunity, inspire them as well if possible.""As Suryakumar Yadav made his speech in the post-match ceremony and Kuldeep Yadav took the Player of the Match cheque, Pakistan skipper Agha chose not to attend the presentation. In the press conference that followed, head coach Mike Hesson came after a lengthy delay. During the presser, Hesson broke silence about Salman's absence while expressing his disappointment with India refraining from engaging in the customary handshake. Hesson did not directly pin Salman's absence due to the incident that took place after the match, but alluded to it obliquely.""We were ready to shake hands. We are obviously disappointed that our opposition did not do that. We sort of went over there to shake hands, but they had already gone to the changing room. That was a disappointing way for the match to finish. We were willing to shake hands. We were keen to shake hands at the end of the match, but that did not happen, and that was pretty much the end of it,"" Hesson said.The Men in Green called for an immediate removal of the match referee Andy Pycroft and lodged a formal complaint with the ICC , emphasising that the Zimbabwean official's actions undermine the spirit of cricket and violate the established protocols.PCB chairman and current president of the Asian Cricket Council (ACC) Mohsin Naqvi demanded ""immediate removal"" of Pycroft over the violation of the ICC Code of Conduct and the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) Laws.Speaking on the incident, Naqvi wrote on X, ""The PCB has lodged a complaint with the ICC regarding violations by the Match Referee of the ICC Code of Conduct and the MCC Laws pertaining to the Spirit of Cricket. The PCB has demanded an immediate removal of the Match Referee from the Asia Cup.""Not limited to their official complaint, Pakistan threatened to pull out of their next match against the UAE , where Pycroft is the match referee, which would put their Asia Cup qualification chances into jeopardy . If Pakistan do withdraw, UAE will go ahead into the tournament, alongside India, on the back of four points.As TimesofIndia.com reported, Pycroft could well have been following instructions from someone in the ACC , as ICC's mandate ends after they appoint officials in consultation with the organising body.""What has ICC got to do with it? Their role ends when the officials are appointed. Someone from the ACC had a chat with Pycroft before the game, and what happened at the toss was a result of that chat. It’s about time the PCB chief finds out what that chat was, who did it and why—instead of pointing fingers at the ICC to further fuel the fire,"" said a source.ICC, as a result, are likely to reject PCB's demand for a change of official for the rest of the Asia Cup, including their upcoming clash. Now the ball is in Pakistan's court on what they do with no change in stance.","India beat Pakistan convincingly in their Asia Cup clash on Sunday.

India’s Handshake Snub at Asia Cup Leaves Pakistan in Full Meltdown, ICC Dragged Into Drama

NEW DELHI: After a turbulent few days dominated by the handshake controversy and threats from the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) to pull out of the tournament, India are switching their focus back to cricket. The team is scheduled to resume training in Dubai on Tuesday, arriving at the ICC Academy around 5:40 PM local time (7:10 PM IST), with practice set to begin at 6:00 PM (7:30 PM IST).The drama off the field hasn’t derailed India’s on-field campaign. In fact, they have become the first team to qualify for the Super 4 stage of the Asia Cup 2025. Their progression was sealed after the United Arab Emirates (UAE) comprehensively defeated Oman to register their first win of the tournament.Powered by fluent half-centuries from both openers, the UAE posted a commanding 172/5. Their bowlers then ripped through Oman’s top order, grabbing four wickets inside the PowerPlay to leave the chase in ruins. Paceman Junaid Siddique starred with the ball as Oman never found momentum and eventually crashed out of the competition.This result confirmed India’s place in the Super 4s, even before they play their final group-stage match.Having already beaten both the UAE and arch-rivals Pakistan, India sit comfortably atop Group A with a commanding net run rate.With Oman’s exit and India’s progression secure, the upcoming India-Oman clash is now a dead rubber.However, the stakes remain high elsewhere. The UAE will next face Pakistan in what is effectively a virtual knockout. The winner will join India in the Super 4 stage, while the loser will bow out.Pakistan, reeling from their seven-wicket defeat to India, face a do-or-die scenario. Their path to the Super 4 depends entirely on beating the UAE.Complicating matters further is the PCB’s standoff with the International Cricket Council (ICC) over match referee Andy Pycroft, whom they accuse of breaching Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) Spirit of Cricket protocols during the now-infamous handshake row. The PCB has even threatened to withdraw from the tournament if Pycroft is not removed.If the ICC rejects the PCB’s demand and Pakistan boycott their match against the UAE on Wednesday, they will be eliminated at the league stage, handing the UAE a walkover into the Super 4s.",India are set to resume training in Dubai on Tuesday.

Poll Do you believe the no-handshake policy was appropriate? Yes No

The International Cricket Council (ICC) has formally turned down the Pakistan Cricket Board's (PCB) request to replace match referee Andy Pycroft during the ongoing Asia Cup TimesofIndia.com had reported on Monday night that a formal communication in this regard was being drafted and it landed on Tuesday morning. The controversy started when PCB expressed displeasure over Pycroft's involvement in a pre-match incident. They claimed he instructed Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha to avoid handshakes with India captain Suryakumar Yadav during the toss.However, the ICC has cleared the air through an official letter. They explained, as reported by TimesofIndia.com, that it was actually the Asian Cricket Council (ACC) officials on the ground who informed Pycroft about the no-handshake policy at the toss. This revelation counters Pakistan's earlier belief that Pycroft was acting under Indian influence.India had chosen not to shake hands with their Pakistani counterparts after the match concluded in a 7-wicket win for the Men in Blue. After hitting the winning runs, Suryakumar Yadav and Shivam Dube walked back to the dugout and celebrated the win with teammates. Pakistan team and coach Mike Hesson tried to shake hands with their arch-rivals but were met with a closed dressing room door.In the aftermath, PCB questioned the conduct of Pycroft and filed an official complaint with the ICC. Current ACC chief and PCB president Mohsin Naqvi had confirmed the decision to file an appeal with the global cricket body.In the letter, PCB said , “It is alarming to note that an ICC-appointed and supposedly neutral match referee opted to indulge in conduct, which clearly violates the Spirit of Cricket and MCC Laws.“The match referee failed to discharge his responsibility: to ensure that respect was extended and maintained amongst the captains as well as between the two competing sides; and to create a positive atmosphere by his conduct and encourage the captains and participating teams to do likewise.“In fact, the Match Referee’s instructions to the two team captains were entirely directed towards achieving the opposite result. This misconduct violates Article 2 of the ICC Code of Conduct for Match Officials, which specifically makes it an offence for the Match Referee to conduct himself in a manner, which is contrary to the spirit of game and violates the MCC Laws.“Given the gravity, political nature/background, and far-reaching consequences and repercussions, the misconduct has also caused disrepute to the game.",India beat Pakistan by 7 wickets in the Asia Cup on Sunday.

NEW DELHI: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has threatened to withdraw from their upcoming Asia Cup 2025 Group A match against the United Arab Emirates if the International Cricket Council (ICC) does not remove match referee Andy Pycroft from the tournament. This development follows a controversy where the Indian cricket team refused to shake hands with their Pakistani counterparts after their match on Sunday.And as TimesofIndia.com reported on Monday, ICC are unlikely to pay heed to PCB's threats and have all but made their stance on the situation clear.The incident occurred during the post-match proceedings when India captain Suryakumar Yadav and his team declined the customary handshake with their Pakistani opponents. The Indian team also closed their dressing room door, preventing the traditional exchange of greetings.Pakistan's captain Salman Agha and coach Mike Hesson expressed their displeasure with the Indian team's actions. Agha subsequently boycotted the post-match presentation, choosing not to interact with former Indian cricket player Sanjay Manjrekar.The PCB's threat to withdraw from their match against the UAE carries significant consequences. If Pakistan follows through with their boycott, they would be automatically eliminated from the Asia Cup tournament.A boycott would result in Pakistan being stranded with only two points from their single victory against Oman.This would be insufficient for qualification to the Super 4s stage, as both India and the UAE would then accumulate more points.India, however, have already qualified for the next stage of the competition, after UAE beat Oman by 42 runs at the Sheikh Zayed Stadium in Abu Dhabi.India lead the Group A standings with four points from two matches with Pakistan second on two points. UAE joined them on two points after Monday's fixture but have a far inferior net run rate. However, if Pakistan boycott their match, the UAE would receive a walkover, increasing their points to four. Oman, meanwhile, have been eliminated from the competition.This scenario would ensure both India and the UAE's progression to the Super 4s stage. India have already secured four points from their victories against the UAE and Pakistan.If Pakistan do continue with their match against the UAE, it would become a decisive contest where the winner advances to the next round. The match's outcome would determine which team joins India in the Super 4s stage.The situation now depends on the ICC's response to Pakistan's demand regarding match referee Andy Pycroft, who is currently scheduled to officiate Pakistan's match against the UAE.",Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has threatened to withdraw from their upcoming Asia Cup 2025 Group A match against the United Arab Emirates.

Suryakumar Yadav statement on Pahalgam to handshake drama: How India HUMILIATED Pakistan

Who is Andy Pycroft?



Poll What is more important in cricket: player conduct or national sentiments? Player conduct National sentiments

NEW DELHI: A major controversy erupted after India's seven-wicket victory over Pakistan in the Asia Cup match in Dubai on Sunday. Indian captain Suryakumar Yadav and his team refused to shake hands with their Pakistani counterparts, dedicating their win to the armed forces following Operation Sindoor. This came after a Pakistan-backed terror attack in Pahalgam killed 26 tourists.The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) responded by filing a formal complaint with the ICC. They claimed match referee Andy Pycroft had instructed the captains not to shake hands at the toss. The PCB demanded Pycroft's removal from the Asia Cup through a complaint to ICC General Manager Wasim Khan.Andy Pycroft, a former Zimbabwe cricketer, has an interesting history in cricket. Though his playing career was brief, with just three Tests and 20 ODIs, he made notable contributions. His standout moment came when he scored 104 runs against an Australian B side that included cricket legends Shane Warne and Steve Waugh.Pycroft's journey in cricket didn't end with his playing days. He took on various roles in cricket management, including coaching Zimbabwe's Under-19 team and serving as a selector.He briefly coached the national team but stepped down during the 2003 World Cup due to selection disputes.Today, Pycroft is one of cricket's most experienced match referees. He has officiated 103 Test matches since 2009, making him the fourth most experienced referee in Test cricket history. His connection with India goes back to his Test debut in Harare in 1992, where he scored 39 and 46 runs. Recently, he was the match referee when Nitish Kumar Reddy scored his first Test century during India's tour of Australia in 2024-25.",India captain Suryakumar Yadav and his team refused to shake hands with their Pakistani counterparts.

Handshake drama becomes ugly! India vs Pakistan Asia Cup 2025 in DANGER?

The International Cricket Council (ICC) is likely to reject Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB)'s demand for a change of match referee Andy Pycroft for remainder of the Asia Cup. ICC's response to PCB's letter, addressed to the global cricket body's General Manager Wasim Khan, is in the works and could be sent anytime now.PCB chief Mohsin Naqvi, who is also the President of the Asian Cricket Council (ACC), wanted the immediate removal of match referee Pycroft. PCB had alleged that Pycroft requested the captains not to shake hands at the toss.The handshakes didn't happen, both at the toss and after the game, and there has been no dearth of drama since.It is reliably understood that Pycroft could well have been following instructions from someone in the ACC, as ICC's job ends after they appoint the officials in consultation with the organising body.""What has ICC got to do with it? Their role ends when the officials are appointed. Someone from the ACC had a chat with Pycroft before the game, and what happened at the toss was a result of that chat. It’s about time the PCB chief finds out what that chat was, who did it and why—instead of pointing fingers at the ICC to further fuel the fire,"" says a source tracking developments.TimesofIndia.com reached out to the ICC for a comment on the development, but got no response from the global cricket body.It now remains to be seen what PCB do next after ICC's response, as they had threatened to pull out of the tournament if their demand for Pycroft's removal was not met. With that unlikely to happen, will the Pakistan cricket team not participate in the remainder of the tournament—a tournament organised by a body chaired by the PCB chief?""All this talk and posting on social media is good for the optics and narrative back home, but it makes very little sense. If they had a problem with India not shaking hands, even that’s not mandatory,"" adds the source.India and Pakistan are scheduled to train at the ICC Academy on September 16, and while the time slots are different, the two sides will be at the same venue for some time together. India have already qualified for the next stage in the competition but Pakistan's place, given the current threat and limbo, remains unclear.","PCB chief Mohsin Naqvi, who is also the President of the Asian Cricket Council (ACC), wanted the immediate removal of match referee Pycroft.

Handshake drama becomes ugly! India vs Pakistan Asia Cup 2025 in DANGER?

Left smarting from the seven-wicket drubbing at India’s hands on Sunday — and the subsequent snub over post-match handshakes — the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has threatened to pull out of the Asia Cup unless match referee Andy Pycroft is removed.PCB chairman Mohsin Naqvi — who also serves as president of the Asian Cricket Council and is Pakistan’s interior minister — confirmed the move in a post on X: “The PCB has lodged a complaint with the ICC regarding violations by the match referee of the ICC code of conduct and the MCC laws pertaining to the spirit of cricket. The PCB has demanded the immediate removal of the match referee from the Asia Cup.”According to Pakistani media reports, the PCB is likely to withdraw from the tournament if their demand is not met. Pycroft reportedly took Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha aside moments before the toss and informed him that there would be no handshake between the captains.After the match, the Pakistan team walked halfway towards the Indian dressing room but, with no response forthcoming from the Indian players or support staff, Agha and his teammates waited briefly before turning back.In its official statement, the PCB said team manager Naveed Cheema had filed a protest against what he called “unsporting behaviour” from the Indian players.“Team manager Naveed Cheema lodged a strong protest against Indian players’ behaviour of not shaking hands. It was deemed as unsporting and against the spirit of the game. As a protest, we did not send our captain to the post-match ceremony,” the statement read.The PCB reiterated its claim that Pycroft instructed Agha at the toss to avoid shaking hands with his Indian counterpart. “The Pakistan team management has lodged a protest, calling the behaviour against the spirit of sports,” the board added.The ICC is yet to issue a public response. Naqvi, in a separate post on X, wrote: “Utterly disappointing to witness the lack of sportsmanship. Dragging politics into the game goes against the very spirit of sports. Let’s hope future victories are celebrated by all teams with grace.”India captain Suryakumar Yadav defended his team’s decision, saying it was a collective call: “I feel a few things in life are beyond sportsman spirit. We actually stand with all the victims of the Pahalgam terror attack and their families and express our solidarity. We dedicate this win to our brave armed forces who took part in Operation Sindoor. As they continue to inspire us all, we will try our best to inspire them as well whenever we get the chance. ”Pakistan head coach Mike Hesson said his players were willing to shake hands and expressed disappointment. “We wanted to shake hands but were disappointed that the opposition didn’t do that. Disappointed with the way we played, but we wanted to shake hands,” he said, adding that Agha’s absence from the post-match ceremony was a direct reaction to the incident.Meanwhile, Telecom Asia Sport quoted sources as saying that Usman Wahla, PCB’s director of international cricket, had been “suspended for delaying the submission of the protest letter.”The two sides are set to meet again in the Super 4s stage, if they both qualify.","Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) threaten to pull out of the Asia Cup unless match referee Andy Pycroft is removed.

Asia Cup: Versatile Axar Patel shows his worth again against Pakistan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/asia-cup/asia-cup-versatile-axar-patel-shows-his-worth-again-against-pakistan/articleshow/123914269.cms,"Axar Patel took 2/18 in the four overs against Pakistan in the Asia Cup. (ANI)

Times of India in Dubai:

Handshake drama becomes ugly! India vs Pakistan Asia Cup 2025 in DANGER?

If Axar Patel were in the entertainment industry, he would have played any role with consummate ease, much like he does for the Indian cricket team . Ask him to bowl the tough powerplay overs and he’s up for it. Need a wicket? He’ll deliver. Need to plug the flow of runs? He’ll keep hammering a tight line until the batters crack.And it’s not just his left-arm spin. He can bat anywhere in the order, in any situation. Remember the World Cup final against South Africa in Barbados last year? India were wobbling at 34/3 when Axar strode out. His crucial cameo virtually took the game away from the Proteas, setting the stage for Virat Kohli to anchor the innings. Then there’s his fielding — his reach and athleticism make him a livewire on the boundary.It was on the back of such exploits that the selectors named him vice-captain of the T20I side. But in a surprising move, he was replaced by Shubman Gill for the Asia Cup . Former India batter Mohammad Kaif, who has worked closely with the Gujarat allrounder at Delhi Capitals, expressed his disappointment.“I hope the selectors informed him before removing him as vice-captain.In our days, we often learned through friends or the media that we were dropped, and that was really troubling. For me, he’s a very important player but seldom gets credit. He is the backbone of the Indian team. People talk about Kohli’s performance in the 2024 World Cup final but Axar should have been man of the match on that day.""He came in at No. 5 and scored a crucial 47 off 31 balls, striking four sixes. That allowed Virat to bat at his own pace. It was the turning point of the game — without those runs, India would have lost.”Axar was one of the unsung heroes of India’s T20 World Cup triumph in the USA and West Indies in June last year. He took nine wickets in eight matches at 19.22, with an economy rate of 7.86, and chipped in with 92 runs at a strike rate of 139.39. His one-handed diving catch to dismiss Australian captain Mitchell Marsh in St. Lucia is still talked about. But his best came when it mattered most — in the semi-final and the final.Against England in the semi-final, he returned with figures of 3/23 in four overs to help bundle them out for 103 in 16.4 overs, setting up a 68-run win in Providence. In the final, after being promoted up the order, he counterattacked under pressure and later claimed the key wicket of Tristan Stubbs.Kaif also questioned Axar’s omission from the Test squad. “I wonder why he was dropped from the Test team. He did no wrong. He has the game for any kind of conditions. That’s why I keep stressing the need for proper communication between selectors and players,” he said.Chief selector Ajit Agarkar clarified that Axar’s vice-captaincy was always meant to be temporary. “Gill was vice-captain when we toured Sri Lanka. After that, he was busy with Test cricket. We obviously see leadership qualities in him, and his form in England exceeded our expectations,” Agarkar said.Named as Suryakumar Yadav’s deputy for the England series, Axar continued to deliver, finishing as India’s second-highest wicket-taker behind Varun Chakaravarthy with six wickets in five matches at 16.50, as India clinched the series 4-1. On Sunday against Pakistan, he struck again with key dismissals of Fakhar Zaman and Salman Ali Agha.Following the seven-wicket victory, Captain Surya was effusive in his praise for the allrounder. “He has been around the Indian team for a very, very long time, so he knows his job really well. His plans are clear. Whenever I see him at practice, he bowls a lot to left-handers — that’s his matchup.”","Axar Patel was one of the unsung heroes of India’s T20 World Cup triumph in the USA and West Indies in June last year.

Suryakumar Yadav on no handshake with Pakistan: 'Some things in life are ahead of sportsmanship'

Suryakumar Yadav's Instagram post

Despite being a one-sided contest filled with standout individual performances, the India–Pakistan clash at the Dubai International Stadium may still go down as the tournament’s most talked-about game — but for reasons beyond cricket.By Monday morning, the ‘handshake-gate’ will dominate the popular narrative on social media feeds and airwaves, and be a hot topic of conversation at water coolers and coffee machines in schools and offices.The cast of characters — Team India captain Suryakumar Yadav , his counterpart Salman Ali Agha, Pakistan head coach Mike Hesson, and match referee Andy Pycroft — were all involved in the drama.As is cricket’s longstanding tradition, the players usually “shake hands and make up” after the game. They do it for the sake of sportsmanship.However, the Indian cricket players were not in a mood to forgive and forget, and instead took a stand for all the victims of the Pahalgam terror attack Team India captain Suryakumar Yadav posted on Instagram: ""This win is dedicated to the armed forces of India and the victims of the Pahalgam attack. Jai Hind.""Surya's deputy Shubman Gill echoed his skipper's sentiments. He wrote on Instagram: ""Today’s win is dedicated to the victims of Pahalgam and to our brave armed forces who continue to safeguard us.The spirit of India lives on both on and off the field. Jai Hind.""Interestingly, at the start of the tournament, Team India captain Suryakumar Yadav, during the captains’ press conference, shook hands with Mohsin Naqvi, chief of the Asian Cricket Council (ACC), president of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), and also Pakistan's Federal Interior Minister. But he refused to shake hands with his counterpart Salman Ali Agha — first at the toss and later at the end of the match.Suryakumar hit the winning six to finish the game, walked towards batting partner Shivam Dube, shook his hand, and then walked off, leaving the Pakistani players in the middle of the ground.The Pakistan team, led by Salman Ali Agha, stood in the middle for a couple of minutes before starting to walk back to their dressing room.Seeing his players head back, Pakistan coach Mike Hesson raced towards Team India’s dressing room, but by then the doors were shut.A visibly upset Hesson was seen having a long conversation with match referee Andy Pycroft. After standing there for four to five minutes, a frustrated Hesson walked back towards the pitch.In response, Salman Ali Agha skipped the post-match presentation in protest against the behaviour of the Indian team, as the ceremony host was also an Indian — former India captain and coach Ravi Shastri.India captain Suryakumar Yadav defended the snub in his post-match press conference, saying that the team was ""aligned with the government and the Board of Control for Cricket in India"" in not shaking hands with the Pakistan team.""We stand with the victims and families of the Pahalgam terror attack and we express our solidarity,"" Suryakumar said. ""We want to dedicate today's win to the armed forces.""Pakistan's head coach Mike Hesson told reporters he was ""disappointed"" with the Indian team's decision.""We were ready to shake hands at the end of the game,"" the former Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) coach said.""We are disappointed that the opposition did not do that. We went over there and they had already gone to the changing room, so that was obviously a disappointing way to finish the match.""Team India head coach, while talking to the broadcasters, hailed the team’s stand.“The match was important for us because as a team we wanted to show our solidarity to the families of the victims of the Pahalgam terror attack, for everything they have gone through. More importantly, we want to thank our armed forces for their successful Operation Sindoor, and I’m sure we will try and make our country proud and happy,” Gambhir told Sony Sports Network.It was the first time that the arch-rivals faced off in a cricket match since the Pahalgam terror attacks earlier this year in April.TimesofIndia.com had reported that the boycott trend on social media was discussed by the players in the team meeting, which was later confirmed by assistant coach Ryan ten Doeschate at the press conference.""We obviously are aware of the sentiments and the strong feelings. And Gauti’s (coach Gautam Gambhir ’s) message has just been very professional, about not worrying about things that are not in our control,” he had said.However, at the end of the game Team India players didn’t take their coach's advice of being ""professional"" to heart and instead did the opposite.And yes, India did win the match comprehensively by seven wickets and cemented their place in the Super Four, where they might again face Pakistan.",Team India captain Suryakumar Yadav refused to shake hands with Pakistan's Salman Ali Agha at the toss and at the end of the match.

(FIDE/PTI)

R Vaishali finished 10th and last in the Chennai Challengers tournament just a couple of weeks before the FIDE Women’s Grand Swiss. The GM lost about 24 rating points too. But the experience of playing against men and having brother R Praggnanandhaa as sparring partner was probably a strong way to prepare. Vaishali won the biennial Grand Swiss meet second time in a row when she drew with China’s world championship finalist Tan Zhongyi. Though Vaishali and Russian No. 4 seed Kateryna Lagno finished level on 8 points each, the 24-year-old Indian, seeded 13th, finished on top because she played against stronger opponents (avg Elo 2434 vs Lagno’s 2433). Lagno, 35, spouse of Alexander Grischuk, drew with Azerbaijan’s Ulviyya Fataliyeva in the last round. Playing under the FIDE flag, she also qualified for the eight-player Candidates tournament as the top-two finishers at Samarkand (Uzbekistan) were to make the grade.India will have at least three women in the Candidates meet now as Divya Deshmukh and K Humpy had already made the grade after finishing the champion and runner-up respectively in the Women’s World Cup. However, the top three seeds in the Open section of Grand Swiss — R Praggnanandhaa, Erigaisi Arjun and D Gukesh — finished 35th, 6th and 41st respectively.Dutch Anish Giri, who lost out to Gukesh for the Candidates spot for 2024 via the 2023 FIDE circuit points race, won the 11-round tournament in style beating Hans Niemann of USA to finish on 8 points.With the top-board game between Germany’s Matthias Bluebaum and Frechman Alireza Firouzja ending in a draw (7.5 points each), Anish was assured of the top-2 finish. For, even if overnight joint leader Vincent Keymer had beaten Arjun, Keymer and Anish would have topped with 8 points each without needing tiebreaks.As it turned out, the Indians could not clinch the spots on their own but they stopped others. Arjun held Keymer to a draw and helped Bluebaum to qualify. Last edition’s champion Vidit Gujrathi split a point with US prodigy Abhimanyu Mishra. The latter had the best tiebreak and would have edged out Bluebaum with a win. Among those who finished on 7.5 points each (Firouzja and Keymer being the others), Bluebaums’ tiebreak was the best. His surprise qualification for the Candidates via this tournament is in tune with the tradition as Vidit (2023) and Wang Hao (2019) — both 15th seeds — had won this event ahead of elite participants.Bluebaum’s run to the second spot despite being the 32nd seed is a story of the tournament. The 28-year-old GM’s (Elo 2671) impressive display had three successive wins, including the scalp of Pragg. He also defeated Arjun and drew the last four games with fellow contenders Nihal Sarin, Nodirbek Abdusattorov, Keymer and Firouzja.","India's GM Vaishali Rameshbabu won the FIDE Women's Grand Swiss 2025 in Samarkand, Uzbekistan.

Bangladesh secured a crucial eight-run victory against Afghanistan in the Asia Cup group league match on Tuesday, keeping their Super Fours qualification hopes alive.Following their previous six-wicket loss to Sri Lanka, Bangladesh delivered a strong team performance in a competitive match that saw multiple momentum shifts.Afghanistan appeared to be in control at the halfway point after limiting Bangladesh to 154 for five. However, they struggled in their chase and were ultimately bowled out for 146 in 20 overs.Azmatullah Omarzai made a significant impact with his quick 30 runs off 16 balls, including 20 runs in Saif Hassan's 14th over, which sparked Afghanistan's comeback after a slow start.Omarzai's innings ended shortly after hitting a six off Taskin Ahmed in the 16th over. Mustafizur Rahman sealed Afghanistan's fate by dismissing Rashid Khan for 20 and AM Ghazanfar for 0 in consecutive deliveries during the penultimate over.Bangladesh's success was built on excellent fielding and dominant performances in both powerplays. They scored 59 runs without losing any wickets in the first powerplay and restricted Afghanistan to 27 for two in their batting powerplay.Nasum Ahmed set the tone early by dismissing Sediqullah Atal with his first delivery. He continued his impressive spell by taking Ibrahim Zadran's wicket for 5 runs in the fifth over.Despite Rahmanullah Gurbaz's strong batting performance at the top, Afghanistan struggled as Gulbadin Naib departed for 16 runs without making a significant impact.Bangladesh's spinners Nasum Ahmed and Rishad Hossain outperformed their Afghan counterparts. Nasum finished with figures of 4-1-11-2, while Rishad took 2 wickets for 18 runs in his 4 overs. Afghanistan's spinners Rashid Khan and Noor Ahmad had earlier restricted Bangladesh with impressive spells of 2/26 and 2/23 respectively.Bangladesh's innings was highlighted by opener Tanzid Hasan's quick-fire 52 runs off 31 balls. His partnership with Saif Hassan, who scored 30, helped Bangladesh reach 87 for one at the halfway mark.The Afghan bowling attack, led by their spinners and supported by Azmatullah Omarzai, managed to slow down Bangladesh's scoring rate with accurate bowling and variations.Tanzid Hasan's aggressive batting included four boundaries off Fazalhaq Farooqi in the third over, despite surviving a close leg-before appeal.Saif Hassan demonstrated his intent with a powerful six against AM Ghazanfar. Tanzid followed with two more spectacular sixes off the Afghan spinner in the sixth over.Afghanistan captain Rashid Khan broke the opening partnership when his low delivery defeated Saif's sweep shot and hit the off-stump.Although Bangladesh maintained a good scoring rate until the tenth over, they faced increasing pressure from Afghanistan's spinners, who maintained tight lines and restricted the batsmen's scoring opportunities.",Bangladesh beat Afghanistan by eight runs to keep Super Fours qualification hopes alive.

Rashid Khan press conference: The rise of Afghanistan, pressure of reaching semis and on Asia Cup

NEW CHANDIGARH: The Indian men's cricket team's decision to not shake hands with the Pakistan players after their group match in the ongoing Asia Cup has stirred a controversy. Ahead of the second Women's ODI at the PCA Mullanpur Stadium here, asked whether the Indian women's team will follow suit in their 2025 WODI World Cup match against Pakistan on Oct 5 in Colombo, ace allrounder Deepti Sharma said, ""That match is a long time away. I haven't thought about it. When that match comes, we will see what we have to do. I'm not thinking much about the Asia Cup. We are focusing on this series.""Left embarrassed by the eight-wicket hammering at the hands of the mighty Australia in the opening women's ODI on Sunday, India would be hoping for an almost miraculous bounce-back which enables them to level the series in the second match of the series at the PCA Mullanpur Stadium here on Wednesday.Another loss will see India not only lose the series, but also be a big dampener to their confidence, which was actually high after their successful tour of England ahead of the 2025 Women's ODI World Cup, which is now just a fortnight away.If they are to end their long wait for an elusive ICC trophy, India must slay their demons against Australia. “It’s not like there’s a vast difference between them and us. Even the smaller teams are doing well.Winning and losing is a part of the game. When we take the field, we play with the aim to win,” said India’s ace allrounder Deepti Sharma on Tuesday.If they even remotely hope to end their losing streak in this format against Alyssa Healy’s side, Harmanpreet Kaur & Co. need a massive turnaround in their bowling and fielding effort in the second match. Most importantly, India must rediscover the sort of zing they showed in their fielding during the England tour, when they took some brilliant catches and pulled off a few run-outs. On Sunday night, their poor fielding came back to haunt them. Their atrocious show in the field was highlighted by four dropped catches.Asked whether India faced a problem in fielding under the lights at this venue, which was making its international debut, Deepti said, “No, there was no such problem. We’ve fielded well in the last few series as a unit. There can be an odd day when a team makes mistakes. We don’t focus much on that. Whatever has happened in the first match, we have taken a few positives from the things in which we've done well. We'll carry that forward in the second ODI. ”Prodded to spell out those ‘positives,’ Deepti said, “The batting partnerships that we had and the little things that we did well in the first ODI, we will carry that forward.”India also seemed to have clearly erred tactically by playing four spinners on a pitch which had nothing in it for the slow bowlers. The biggest disappointment was the poor show of Deepti, as the most experienced bowler in the side went wicketless while conceding 59 in 10 overs.Did dew, which arrived in the night, hurt India’s spinners? “There was dew, but we can’t say that (dew was a big factor). Sometimes, as a bowler, it happens that you want to do well, put in your best effort, but it doesn’t work out that way. The idea is to learn from that and do well next time. I don’t focus much on whether I got a wicket at that time or not. My thought process is about taking a wicket. I hope that we can see that (her taking wickets) in the rest of the matches,” Deepti said.With the ODI World Cup approaching fast, India need to give game time to seasoned pacer Renuka Singh Thakur, who has not played an international match for the last nine months. Renuka was seen bowling in the nets during the first WODI, which means that she could finally return to action on Wednesday. “She’s fit,” Deepti said.",Deepti Sharma says India's decision to not shake hands with Pakistan after Asia Cup has stirred a controversy. India lost the first ODI by eight wickets to Australia on Sunday. The second ODI takes place at the PCA Mullanpur Stadium on Wednesday.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123925758,imgsize-35868,width-400,resizemode-4/deepti-sharma-1609-afp.jpg"

Handshake drama becomes ugly! India vs Pakistan Asia Cup 2025 in DANGER?

The handshake controversy

NEW DELHI: The turmoil surrounding Pakistan at the Asia Cup 2025 deepened further on Tuesday as they cancelled their scheduled pre-match press conference ahead of their crucial clash against United Arab Emirates at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium on Wednesday.The move came just a day after Pakistan threatened to pull out of the tournament if match referee Andy Pycroft was not removed.Pakistan had demanded Pycroft’s ouster, accusing him of failing to act on their complaint against India following the Indian players’ decision to skip the customary handshake after their match in Dubai on Sunday.However, as reported by TimesofIndia.com, it is highly unlikely that the Pakistan Cricket Board will actually pull out of the ongoing tournament. Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chief Mohsin Naqvi, who also heads the Asian Cricket Council (ACC), confirmed that Pakistan had lodged an official complaint with the International Cricket Council (ICC). They accused Pycroft of breaching the ICC Code of Conduct and ignoring the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) laws relating to the spirit of cricket. However, the ICC rejected Pakistan’s demand.The controversy erupted after India’s players, led by skipper Suryakumar Yadav, refused to shake hands with their Pakistani counterparts as a symbolic protest following the Pahalgam terror attack earlier this year. Suryakumar even avoided shaking hands with Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha at the toss.Pakistan alleged Pycroft instructed both captains not to shake hands at the toss, preventing the exchange of team sheets between Suryakumar and Salman.While Pakistan protested, Suryakumar dedicated India’s win to the victims of the Pahalgam terror attack and to the Indian armed forces, expressing solidarity with the families affected.If Pakistan fail to take the field against UAE on Wednesday, they will be eliminated from the Asia Cup. They currently have two points from one win and one loss, and must beat UAE to secure a place in the Super Four stage.","Pakistan cancelled their scheduled pre-match press conference ahead of their crucial clash against UAE in Dubai on Wednesday.

Shubman Gill, Arshdeep Singh touch Abhishek Sharma's father's feet ahead of high-voltage Asia Cup clash vs Pakistan

NEW DELHI: Indian opener Abhishek Sharma ’s father, Raj Kumar Sharma, has opened up about his son’s passion for cricket since childhood, recalling how he always loved facing express pace and would often ask to train against bowling above 150 kmph during his under-16 days.Abhishek is currently setting new benchmarks in T20 cricket with his explosive batting. Long known as a genuine six-hitter, his power-hitting reached another level when he opened alongside Australian superstar Travis Head for Sunrisers Hyderabad in the 2024 Indian Premier League (IPL).India’s World Cup-winning all-rounder Yuvraj Singh, famous as the first Indian to hit six sixes in an over in international cricket, has also mentored Abhishek for years and continues to guide him.Speaking in a video shared by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), Raj Kumar, a first-class cricketer himself, said:""I am also a first-class cricketer. There was a cricket-loving atmosphere at my house. And when he was a kid, he used to play with my bat and also trouble his mother. I have two daughters, he used to tell them to have him help bat at night. Sometimes he used to tell me that he wanted to do some diving practice and throw him a catch.""Raj Kumar, who was Abhishek’s first coach, said he soon realised his son’s talent and passion.""The senior players used to tell me, your son has a lot of talent. He will play for India one day. I said, he is still a kid. He has just started holding the bat barely, but all the blessings, love, and hard work of him and his people brought him here.""Being a left-arm spinner himself, Raj Kumar focused on Abhishek’s bowling too.""Because of that, he is a very good bowler. And in the future, he will bowl well for India. When I used to train Abhishek, I used to make him bat against bowling of 150 mph during his under-16 days. Everyone would tell me that he would get hurt, but he used to tell me, Papa iss se bhi tez karayo (Dad, get bowlers to bowl even faster). This is how his technique developed. His power-hitting is natural.""He also praised Yuvraj’s contribution to his son’s journey.""Behind him is also Yuvraj Singh, who also gave him a lot of time and experience. A lot of big players have joined him. There are a lot of good coaches. They have a lot of experience. I am glad that Abhishek has such people around him, who give him their love and blessings. I thank all the coaches and selectors of BCCI and the support staff as he is now playing for India. I pray to God that India wins the Asian Cup.""Abhishek has scored 61 runs in two Asia Cup 2025 matches so far at a strike rate of over 210. In 19 T20Is for India, he has amassed 596 runs at an average of 33.11 and a strike rate of 195.40, with two centuries and two fifties.This year alone, he has scored 340 runs in seven T20Is at 48.57, including a 54-ball 135 against England at Wankhede Stadium. Across 21 T20s this year (including IPL), he has 779 runs at a strike rate of 203.39, featuring two centuries and three fifties.","Abhishek Sharma is currently setting new benchmarks in T20 cricket with his explosive batting.

Real Madrid opened their Champions League campaign with a narrow 2-1 win over Marseille at the Santiago Bernabeu, despite playing the closing stages with 10 men. Marseille stunned the home crowd when Timothy Weah put them ahead midway through the first half. Real equalised before the interval when Mbappe converted a penalty after Rodrygo was fouled in the box.The home side faced further trouble in the second half. Trent Alexander-Arnold was sidelined with an injury, and Dani Carvajal was sent off following a VAR review for a headbutt on Marseille goalkeeper Geronimo Rulli.Even with ten men, Real Madrid held on thanks to another Mbappe penalty, after Facundo Medina was penalised for handball. Mbappe, who reached 50 goals for the club, said, “For me it’s a penalty, but I understand there are people who don’t. We’re all lost with this rule.”Arsenal followed with a strong 2-0 away win against Athletic Bilbao. Gabriel Martinelli and Leandro Trossard, both substitutes, scored late in the game. Martinelli ran through to open the scoring in the 72nd minute, and Trossard sealed the victory with a deflected strike.“We started to grow throughout the game. In the second half, we were more fluent, dominant, and the finishers made the impact for us to win the game,” said coach Mikel Arteta. This was an ideal start for Arsenal, who lost to eventual champions Paris Saint-Germain in last season’s semi-finals.Tottenham Hotspur edged Villarreal 1-0 in North London, with the match decided by a farcical own goal from Villarreal goalkeeper Luiz Junior. Lucas Bergvall’s cross trickled into the net, giving Spurs the win. “It was a very even game that we just edged,” said manager Thomas Frank, as Tottenham continued their strong form under new leadership.Juventus and Borussia Dortmund delivered one of the most thrilling games of the night, finishing 4-4 in Turin. After a goalless first half, Karim Adeyemi put Dortmund ahead, but Kenan Yildiz equalised soon after. The lead changed hands multiple times, with Felix Nmecha, Dusan Vlahovic, Yan Couto, Ramy Bensebaini, and late goals from Vlahovic and Lloyd Kelly making it a rollercoaster of a match.In Lisbon, Benfica seemed to be cruising against Qarabag, leading 2-0 early through Enzo Barrenechea and Vangelis Pavlidis. But Qarabag fought back with Leandro Andrade, Camilo Duran, and Oleksiy Kashchuk scoring to win 3-2 — their first-ever victory in the Champions League proper.Union Saint-Gilloise also made history with a 3-1 win at PSV Eindhoven.

Paris Saint-Germain begin their Champions League title defence against Atalanta on Wednesday, with concerns mounting over their squad's ability to handle an intense schedule following their historic triumph last season. The French champions, who played 65 games in 2024/25, are already facing injury challenges as they prepare for another demanding campaign that includes domestic competitions, European matches, and the FIFA Intercontinental Cup.PSG's European campaign includes matches against Bayern, Tottenham Hotspur, and Newcastle United in the group stage, along with away fixtures at Barcelona, Bayer Leverkusen, Athletic Bilbao, and Sporting Lisbon.The team's previous Champions League performance showed resilience despite early struggles, losing three of eight group stage matches before securing their first European title with a 5-0 victory over Inter Milan in Munich.The demanding schedule from last season has begun taking its toll. Ballon d'Or favorite Ousmane Dembele and Desire Doue are sidelined with muscle injuries from international duty, while Khvicha Kvaratskhelia, Lee Kang-in, and Lucas Beraldo suffered injuries in Sunday's 2-0 win against Lens.""It happens to everyone. It is a bit of a difficult time for us because we have a lot of players injured,"" said Luis Enrique, who himself is wearing an arm sling due to a cycling accident. ""I am calm about it and I hope we will manage to overcome it.""The club's squad management last season was effective, with nineteen players logging over 1,000 minutes, matching the rotation patterns of Real Madrid and Barcelona.The Club World Cup's demanding schedule, featuring matches in intense heat and extensive travel across the United States, proved particularly challenging. PSG utilized 19 players compared to Chelsea's 27, ultimately losing 3-0 in the final.This season could see PSG play at least 55 games if they advance in the Champions League, including December's FIFA Intercontinental Cup.Right-back Achraf Hakimi, who recorded the most minutes for PSG last season, faces additional commitments with Morocco's hosting of the Africa Cup of Nations in December and January.The club's transfer activity was minimal, adding only center-back Illia Zabarnyi and goalkeeper Lucas Chevalier, who replaced Gianluigi Donnarumma.""Injuries to high-profile players are only one visible part of the workload crisis facing professional football and are not surprising,"" stated FIFPro, the global players' union. ""The impact is not felt just by the players but increasingly also by clubs, national teams, fans and national competitions.""Despite these challenges, PSG's coach maintains optimism about their European campaign.""It is a special moment. We know how difficult this competition is, but we are relaxed about it and we are hoping to put in a good performance in our first game,"" Luis Enrique said.","Paris Saint-Germain begin their Champions League title defence against Atalanta on Wednesday.

Poll How do you feel about Manchester City's performance against Manchester United? Outstanding Solid Average

Manchester City cruised to a commanding 3-0 victory over rivals Manchester United on Sunday, with Erling Haaland scoring twice after Phil Foden’s opener at the Etihad Stadium.The result handed Pep Guardiola’s side a timely lift after back-to-back league defeats, while piling more pressure on United manager Ruben Amorim, whose team have now taken just four points from their first four games.City began strongly and made the breakthrough inside 20 minutes. Jeremy Doku’s persistence on the left allowed his cross to find an unmarked Foden to head home.After the restart, Haaland extended the advantage in trademark fashion, racing clear before lifting the ball calmly over Altay Bayindir. Moments later, the Norwegian spurned an open-goal chance when he rounded the goalkeeper but struck the post, keeping United faintly in the contest.Any hopes of a response were dashed by a standout moment from debutant Gianluigi Donnarumma, who clawed away Bryan Mbeumo’s volley at full stretch to preserve City’s two-goal cushion. Minutes later, Harry Maguire’s misplaced pass allowed Bernardo Silva to release Haaland, who finished emphatically to seal the points.The win keeps City six points behind leaders Liverpool but restores momentum ahead of a demanding week featuring fixtures against Napoli and Arsenal. For United, it was another disappointing derby day, with fans audibly expressing their frustration towards Amorim as chants of “sacked in the morning” echoed from the away section.The occasion was preceded by a solemn moment as both sets of supporters paid tribute to boxing great Ricky Hatton, who passed away earlier on Sunday. A lifelong City supporter, Hatton’s image was displayed during a minute’s applause.",Erling Haaland scored twice as Manchester City beat Manchester United 3-0 at the Etihad Stadium.

The first Manchester derby of the season arrives with both sides searching for rhythm, setting up a tense battle at the Etihad Stadium. Pride, bragging rights and crucial points are at stake as Guardiola’s City and Amorim’s United prepare to write the latest chapter in their rivalry.City, usually relentless at home, have looked shaky in the initial weeks.

Real Madrid secured a 2-1 victory against Real Sociedad in Saturday's Spanish league match, led by Kylian Mbappé who scored one goal and assisted another, despite playing with 10 men for nearly an hour. Meanwhile, Atletico Madrid earned its first season win before their Champions League clash with Liverpool, and Athletic Bilbao suffered a defeat ahead of hosting Arsenal.Mbappé demonstrated his scoring prowess in the 12th minute, capitalizing on a poor Sociedad pass to score his fourth goal of the season. He outpaced defenders and successfully shot past goalkeeper Alex Remiro.Madrid faced a significant challenge when new defender Dean Huijsen received a red card in the 32nd minute for pulling down Mikel Oyarzabal who had only the goalkeeper to beat.Despite being a man down, Madrid extended their lead before halftime. Mbappé's skillful dribbling near the byline created space to find Arda Guler, who converted the opportunity into Madrid's second goal.Sociedad narrowed the gap in the 56th minute when Oyarzabal scored from the penalty spot, awarded after the ball hit Dani Carvajal's arm in the area.""The red card changed the game a bit. We struggled a bit as a team, but we take home the three points,"" Mbappé said.""Our start to the season has been very good, as has mine.""Madrid maintained their perfect start to La Liga with four wins in four games. They now lead Barcelona by five points, with Barcelona set to face Valencia on Sunday.Coach Alonso mentioned that Huijsen, a summer signing from Bournemouth, was ""angry but relieved"" that his dismissal didn't cost the team points.In other matches, Atletico Madrid defeated Villarreal 2-0, with Nico González scoring on his debut after joining from Juventus on loan. Pablo Barrio opened the scoring in the ninth minute before González headed in Marcos Llorente's cross.""We weren't that bad before and now we aren't suddenly great, so let's stay calm, this has just started,"" said Atletico midfielder Koke Resurrección. ""Now we need to rest up for our very important match at Liverpool.""Julián Álvarez was substituted at halftime as a precautionary measure, according to the club's social media announcement.In a surprising turn of events, Alaves secured their first win at Athletic Bilbao in 20 years through an Álex Berenguer own goal, winning the Basque Country derby 1-0.Athletic Bilbao, playing without injured forward Nico Williams, suffered their first loss of the season after winning their opening three matches.Getafe continued their impressive form with a 2-0 victory over promoted Oviedo, with goals from Mario Martín and Borja Mayoral. José Bordalás' team now has three wins and one loss this season.Madrid prepares to begin their Champions League campaign on Tuesday against Marseille, while Atletico heads to Anfield on Wednesday, and Athletic Bilbao gets ready to host Arsenal.","Real Madrid defeated Real Sociedad 2-1 in Saturday's Spanish league match.

When is the Barcelona vs Valencia match?



Where will the match be played?



Barcelona return to La Liga action on Sunday against Valencia, but their first home fixture of the season will not be played at Camp Nou. The Catalan club is still waiting on permits to reopen its renovated stadium and will instead use the 6,000-capacity Estadi Johan Cruyff, normally reserved for the women’s and youth teams.Club president Joan Laporta addressed the situation earlier this week, saying: “We will be back to the Camp Nou as soon as possible.” Until then, Barcelona must adapt to life in a far smaller venue.Coach Hansi Flick also faces a selection headache. Frenkie de Jong, Alejandro Balde and Gavi remain unavailable through injury, with De Jong’s setback occurring while on international duty with the Netherlands. Goalkeeper Marc-André ter Stegen continues to be sidelined as well, reducing Flick’s options further.Furthermore, Lamine Yamal will also play no part in the game owing to injuries sustained while on duty for Spain.Despite the off-field and fitness concerns, Barcelona remain unbeaten and will look to maintain their strong start under Flick. Valencia, meanwhile, arrive in search of an upset that could shift early-season momentum.The fixture marks the first major test of how Barcelona manage both reduced squad depth and the unusual circumstances of playing without their iconic stadium.With young talents like Lamine Yamal stepping up in attack, the champions will aim to keep pace with early leaders Real Madrid and Athletic Bilbao.- The matchday 2 fixture will be streamed live on the FanCode app and website.- There will be no live broadcast in India for the 2025/26 La Liga season.The matchday 4 clash between Valencia and Barca will kick off on Sunday, September 14 (Monday, September 15 in India) at 9:00 PM Local time (12:30 AM IST).The match between Valencia and Barcelona will not be played at Camp Nou. Rather, the game will take place at the Estadi Johan Cruyff in Sant Joan Despi, Spain.","Barcelona face Valencia at the Estadi Johan Cruyff in Sant Joan Despi.

New Delhi: Naushad Moosa has taken a break. After the India U-23 coach failed to make the grade in the AFC U-23 Asian Cup 2026 Qualifiers, the former India international defender stayed back in Doha to spend a couple of days with friends.The Qatari capital was bombed on Tuesday, a day after India narrowly lost to the hosts. Was it safe for him to stay back? Moosa told TOI, “It created some panic that night but things settled down after that.”His team’s performance in the three Doha qualifiers made the people back home sit up and take notice. The social media was full of clips showing Muhammed Suhail's impressive solo effort for the opening strike.Naushad Moosa’s boys finished fifth among the eleven second-placed teams, just one spot behind the qualification places. They won against Bahrain (2-0), drubbed Brunei 6-0 and narrowly lost to hosts Qatar 2-1.“Agreed there is lot to cheer about the U-23 boys’ display, but what concerns me is, what next? Most of them will warm the bench when they go back to their clubs. They won’t get much game time. They end up playing developmental games,” pointed out Moosa.“This lack of continuity has been a major problem for us,” he continued, “These boys need to play consistently at the senior level now.They are good enough for senior India too.”Moosa said he has related this issue with the AIFF too and can only hope it can be addressed. Moosa’s strong message to the young players is to find clubs where they can get playing time.For now, Moosa will return to Guwahati to join NorthEast United, where he is part of the coaching staff. Praising his boys for their adventurous display, Moosa said that Suhail, the most talked about youngster currently, should remain focused.“These boys should concentrate on the game but for that they have to be kept engaged with competitive games.”","Naushad Moosa's boys finished fifth among the eleven second-placed teams.

What’s common between the three Formula E world champions

How the three World Champions fared in Formula E Season 11

Days after Oliver Rowland lifted his Formula E World Championship trophy in London this season, an interesting trend has come to the attention of Formula E and its fans. As a coincidence, all Formula E drivers who won the Mexico City E-Prix went on to win the Formula E World Championship that season, and this has been proved right for three consecutive years.Highlighting the same since 2023, a poster of three World Champions was shared on X by Formula E with the caption, “The trend continues. Each winner of the #MexicoCityEPrix from the past three seasons has gone on to become World Champion.”The special poster features 2023 Formula E World Champion Jake Dennis from Andretti, then TAG Heuer Porsche’s Pascal Wehrlein, who won in 2024, and the new World Champion, Nissan driver Oliver Rowland. All three of them won in the Mexico E-Prix and went on to lift the winner’s trophy in the Formula E World Championship that year.Oliver Rowland had strengthened his chances of winning the Formula E World Championship this year much earlier. He was leading the Formula E Driver Standings ever since he won Part 2 of the Jeddah E-Prix, which was his second win of the season after winning the Mexico E-Prix. In the last leg, the Nissan driver got nervous for a while as Pascal Wehrlein, who was following him in the number two position, closed the gap after grabbing quite a few podiums while Rowland had a dull period.Things became serious for Rowland when he failed to finish the Round 13 race in Berlin, while Wehrlein won second spot on the podium. But he eventually managed to confirm his championship in Berlin after four wins and three more podiums.Sharing about his bad race in Berlin, Rowland had said, “I was hoping before the weekend that the outcome could be [the World Championship], but after yesterday (Saturday) and this morning (Sunday), I was more worried that it might never come.”Also Read: Oliver Rowland reacts to daughter’s sweet radio message after Formula E Championship win: “It’s amazing” Things, however, changed for Wehrlein, who was pushed to third position after Nick Cassidy made a late entry in the Formula E Driver Standings by registering three consecutive wins.

Taylor Barnard on losing top three spot in Formula E World Championship

Fans hail Taylor Barnard for his fantastic rookie season

It was Taylor Barnard’s rookie season this year, and the NEOM McLaren driver put up a fantastic performance by temporarily making it to the top three in the Formula E Driver Standings by ousting the much more experienced Porsche driver Antonio Felix Da Costa. He was, however, ousted from the top three at the London E-Prix as Jaguar’s Nick Cassidy went on to register three consecutive wins. Barnard took to Instagram to share his feelings on losing out on the top three in his first-ever season and his claim to the championship.Taking to Instagram after the London E-Prix, Barnard wrote, “London wasn’t what we hoped for, easily being the toughest weekend of our season. Taking 0 points away as a team from a doubleheader hurts, but one weekend doesn’t define the year we’ve had.”He further wrote, “As the season closes, I want to say a massive thank you to the entire team, both trackside and behind the scenes, for everything this season. Finishing P4 in the Drivers’ Championship and coming into the final weekend with a shot at runner-up is something to be proud of.”Also adding a note for teammate Sam Bird, as NEOM McLaren withdrew from Formula E after the end of the season, Barnard wrote, “@sambird_official it wasn’t the weekend you deserved either.You’ve been a huge part of my season both on and off the track, and I’m grateful for everything. You deserved more. To all the Papaya fans, thank you for the incredible support in our final race together. You always go above and beyond. ”Reacting to his post, a fan wrote, “An incredible debut season, huge congrats and excited to see where you go next!” Another said, “I know I said it the other day, but you’ve been incredible to watch this last year and a pleasure to support you in Papaya — there are many of us that can’t wait to support you in whatever you do next!” One more commented, “You were incredible all season around, Taylor.

Team Principal Ian James of the departing Formula E team NEOM McLaren has penned an open letter to the fans of the team, marking their departure from the electric motorsport format. Addressing the Papaya Army, James thanked them for their trust and support as the team went on to win two Drivers’ World Championships and two Teams’ World Championships over 103 races in seven seasons.Ian James began the letter saying that he wrote it with “a huge amount of pride, as well as with more than a hint of sadness,” as the team closed the final chapter after seven years of competing in the ABB FIA Formula E World Championship.Thanking the fans for their love on social media and at the track, he said, “The team was always blown away by the amount of papaya we saw at circuits across the world, race-in, race-out, right from our very first round as the NEOM McLaren Formula E team. Through the early days, the good days, the bad days, and the great days, we have always felt an overwhelming amount of support from you all.”For the partners associated with the team, he wrote, “They say that ‘racing is a state of mind’, and since its inception, this team has had the privilege of working for organisations, with partners, and racing for fans who fully embrace this philosophy.This is certainly true of those at McLaren, whose passion for racing is second to none.”“My heartfelt thanks go out to everyone who has been involved: those at McLaren who backed us, the fans who supported us, and the partners who allowed us to go racing. We couldn’t have done it without you all — your trust and support have never been taken for granted,” he added.Praising the two McLaren drivers, he wrote, “Sam clinched McLaren’s first-ever fully electric win at the São Paulo E-Prix in Season 10, pulling off one of Formula E’s all-time great overtakes, before being waved across the line by none other than Emerson Fittipaldi – McLaren's first Formula 1 World Champion. While Taylor has been a rookie sensation in Season 11, securing five Formula E records, including the youngest driver to start a race, the youngest points scorer, the youngest driver to lead a lap, the youngest podium finisher, and the youngest polesitter. ”He ended the letter saying, “Some of us have been together since the day we first launched this team, while others have seamlessly fitted in along the way and flourished within the environment we have cultivated. For many, I am sure that we will cross paths again soon, but whatever the future holds for those here at Bicester, whatever path they choose to follow, I have no doubt that it will be bright. Their potential is limitless. ”Reacting to the open letter on Instagram, Taylor Barnard wrote, “It’s been an honour to wear Papaya and represent this team.” Sam Bird also dropped a heart emoji and a hands-joined-in-prayer emoji in the comments section.Also Read: Taylor Barnard looks back at rookie season at McLaren: “Every step has been unforgettable” Neither Taylor Barnard nor Sam Bird has revealed their future course of action in Formula E Season 12.

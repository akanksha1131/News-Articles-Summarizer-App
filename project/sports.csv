Sanju Samson or Ishan Kishan? | Greenstone Lobo predicts the ideal player for T20 World Cup

NEW DELHI: Former Pakistan wicketkeeper Rashid Latif has weighed in strongly on the uncertainty surrounding Pakistan’s participation in the T20 World Cup 2026, saying the window for decisive action has already closed even as the Pakistan Cricket Board awaits clearance from the government.PCB chairman Mohsin Naqvi recently met Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to discuss Pakistan’s position after the International Cricket Council removed Bangladesh as a host.While Naqvi has indicated that the final go-ahead is still pending, the board has already scheduled the squad’s departure to Colombo on February 2, a move that virtually rules out a boycott of either the tournament or the high-profile February 15 clash against India. A formal confirmation of participation is expected from PCB.Speculation has been rife in sections of the media that Pakistan could withdraw from the tournament or refuse to face India. Pakistan have publicly expressed solidarity with Bangladesh, and reports suggest internal discussions were held on boycotting either the event or the India match specifically.Latif, however, believes Pakistan moved too slowly. While acknowledging that the ultimate decision rests with the government, he feels the opportunity to make a meaningful statement has passed.Though pulling out of the tournament entirely may now be difficult, Latif maintained that Pakistan could still opt out of playing India, even if the two sides were to meet in the final.""If the government says we won't play against India, the ICC will have to accept it,"" Latif said. ""If they don't, that's where the real confrontation begins.""Asked what would happen should India and Pakistan qualify for the final, Latif was blunt in his response: ""Nahi khelenge"" (we won't play).Latif argued that Pakistan should have withdrawn immediately after the decision was taken to shift the tournament away from Bangladesh. Speaking on the YouTube channel CaughtBehind, he said: ""The time for a strike has passed. Every decision has a timing. You should strike while the iron is hot. That time was last week during the ICC meeting.""He added: ""We showed our support. We voted for them. That chapter is over. If we boycott now, it won't have the same impact.""Chairman Naqvi has stated that the final decision on Pakistan’s participation in the T20 World Cup 2026 will be confirmed either this Friday or next Monday, but Latif’s remarks underline growing frustration over what he sees as a delayed and diluted response.","Former Pakistan wicketkeeper Rashid Latif says the window for decisive action has already closed.

NEW DELHI: England reinforced their status as strong contenders for the upcoming T20 World Cup after grinding out an 11-run Duckworth-Lewis-Stern victory over Sri Lanka in the opening T20I at Pallekele on Friday. Sam Curran proved the decisive factor, claiming a hat-trick as Sri Lanka were bowled out for 133 in 16.2 overs. Opener Phil Salt, the world’s second-ranked T20I batter, anchored England’s chase with a fluent 46 off 35 balls as the visitors went 1-0 up in the three-match series, which serves as a dress rehearsal for the World Cup.""Our execution was good tonight. We are happy with the progress we have made and it's all about building up nicely for the World Cup. Sam Curran was awesome. He had a tough start tonight, but he bounced back so well,"" England captain Harry Brook said.Sri Lanka had surged to 76 for one inside seven overs before spin turned the tide. Leg-spinner Adil Rashid struck three times to stall the hosts’ momentum and was named Man of the Match.Curran became only the second England player after Chris Jordan to register a T20I hat-trick, wrapping up the Sri Lankan innings just as the hosts threatened to post a competitive total.He began by having skipper Dasun Shanaka caught at mid-off, then saw Maheesh Theekshana hole out to long-on, before producing a full, swinging delivery to bowl Matheesha Pathirana.The last pair managed just four runs before Jamie Overton dismissed Wanindu Hasaranga for 14, as Sri Lanka collapsed from 129 for six to 133 all out in the space of five deliveries.In reply, Salt set the tone with an authoritative knock, while Tom Banton provided momentum with a rapid 29 off 15 balls that included three fours and two sixes. Sri Lanka’s sloppy fielding, which featured two dropped regulation catches, further hurt their cause, though the hosts were already defending an under-par total against a formidable England line-up.England required only nine runs from the final two overs with six wickets in hand when rain halted play. With the visitors well ahead on DLS calculations, they were declared winners. Earlier, rain had already reduced the match to 17 overs per side.""Very disappointed with the way we handled things out in the middle. We need to be better with the options that we take. We have the potential no doubt, but we aren't delivering out in the middle,"" Sri Lanka captain Dasun Shanaka said.The two sides meet again at the same venue on Sunday, with the series set to conclude on Tuesday.",England beat Sri Lanka by 11 runs in the opening T20I at Pallekele.

Manpreet Singh post

Former India hockey captain Manpreet Singh on Friday cleared the air around his omission from the national setup, stating that he had stepped away voluntarily to rest and spend time with his family, and not due to any disciplinary action.Questions were raised after the two-time Olympic bronze medallist was left out of the core group of 33 probables for the first time in 15 years. The development followed reports claiming that Manpreet was dropped after allegedly abusing a recreational drug during India’s tour of South Africa in December last year.Manpreet, however, took to social media to address the speculation and said the decision was taken to give him a much-needed break after a gruelling schedule.""Since the Paris Olympics, it’s been non-stop hockey for me. Back-to-back tournaments, across Asia, Europe, Australia and South Africa,"" Manpreet wrote on 'X'.He also pointed to significant changes in his personal life over the past year.""Last year, my wife Illi and I were blessed with my second baby girl.

Poll Will Pakistan participate in the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup? Yes, definitely No, they will not participate

NEW DELHI: As the cricketing world awaits final confirmation from the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) on the team’s participation in the upcoming ICC Men’s T20 World Cup, captain Salman Ali Agha has removed at least one uncertainty by firmly locking in his batting position for the global event.Pakistan are scheduled to depart for Colombo early on February 2, a move that has been widely interpreted as a strong signal that the team will take part in the tournament, co-hosted by India and Sri Lanka from February 7. A source close to the board told PTI that all travel arrangements are already in place, making a last-minute boycott highly unlikely.Even as the political and administrative suspense continues, Salman has made it clear that on-field plans are already taking shape. Following Pakistan’s opening T20I win over Australia in Lahore, the skipper confirmed that he will bat at No. 3 during the World Cup.“Yes, I’ll be batting at No. 3. We expect to face a lot of spin, and I believe I can dominate spin during the Powerplay. That’s why I moved up, and that is where I’ll stay,” Salman was quoted as saying by the ICC.The decision marks a significant shift for the right-hander, who has traditionally batted lower down the order in T20Is.His promotion was on display against Australia, where he struck a fluent 39 at No.3 to anchor Pakistan’s innings in their 22-run victory.Salman admitted Pakistan could have pushed on further with the bat but expressed confidence in his bowling unit. “We started well but couldn’t finish the way we wanted. After the first 10 overs, the ball stopped coming onto the bat,” he said. “To be honest, I felt 170 was enough. Our spin bowling is outstanding, and I knew it would be tough for them.”Pakistan defended 168 successfully, with Australian batters struggling against spin, losing six wickets in the chase.Off the field, speculation over Pakistan’s participation has refused to die down, following Bangladesh’s removal from the tournament. However, insiders insist the PCB’s approach is rooted in protecting Pakistan cricket’s long-term interests and maintaining relations with the ICC.","Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha confirms he will bat at No. 3 during the T20 World Cup.

Belarusian World No.1 Aryna Sabalenka defeated Ukraine’s Elina Svitolina 6-2, 6-3 in the Australian Open semi-final on Thursday to set up a title clash with Elena Rybakina.There was no handshake after the match, in line with protocol involving Ukrainian players and opponents from Russia or Belarus. Before the match at Rod Laver Arena, an announcement informed fans there would be no handshake and asked them to respect the decision. Sabalenka and Svitolina also stayed apart during the pre-match formalities and photographs.Sabalenka moved into a record fourth straight Australian Open final and is chasing her third title in Melbourne. She has not dropped a set at the ongoing Australian Open and will be a firm favourite in the final.Sabalenka and fifth seed Rybakina have now played each other 14 times, with Sabalenka winning eight matches. One of those wins came in the 2023 Australian Open final, where Sabalenka won in three sets.After the match, Sabalenka spoke about the win and praised her opponent.""I’m super happy with the win, she’s a really tough opponent, she was playing really incredible tennis throughout the whole week,"" Sabalenka said.There was a delay early in the match when Sabalenka was given a hindrance call for grunting during the fourth game. The decision led to a video review and boos from the crowd. Sabalenka lost the point but regained control and broke serve early in the second set to close out the match.Svitolina said events in Ukraine put the result into perspective.“People are really living horrible and terrifying lives in Ukraine, so I should not be allowed to really be sad because I’m a very, very lucky person,” the 31-year-old said.In the other semi-final, Rybakina beat sixth seed Jessica Pegula of the United States 6-3, 7-6 (9/7). The match lasted one hour and 40 minutes. Rybakina did not drop a set in the tournament and had earlier defeated second seed Iga Swiatek in the quarter-finals.","Belarusian World No.1 Aryna Sabalenka defeated Ukraine’s Elina Svitolina 6-2, 6-3 in the Australian Open semi-final on Thursday to set up a title clash with Elena Rybakina.

Shivam Dube press conference: On mindset shift, reading bowlers and dominating middle overs

Poll Do you believe Shivam Dube will significantly impact India's performance in the upcoming T20 World Cup? Yes, definitely Maybe, depends on form No, unlikely

It’s hard to find positives in a 50-run loss in a T20I game but the Indian team won’t be too unhappy with what transpired in the fourth T20I in Vizag. The 23-ball 65 by Shivam Dube after a top-order wobble was a reminder to opposition teams about the dynamite batter India will have up their sleeve in the middle order in the T20 World Cup starting next month.IPL watchers will know that teams are wary of using spin against Chennai Super Kings ’ Dube after the 10th over. In CSK, where the gentle giant has been playing since 2022, Dube has flourished in this role.Incidentally, Dube had made his T20I debut for India before he played for CSK. But in the 13 T20Is that he played before that as a middle-order batter who could bowl medium-pace, the left-hander failed to carve his niche. CSK first took note of him during an inconsequential IPL game in Abu Dhabi in 2021, when they had already qualified for a top-two finish.In that match, Dube was playing for Rajasthan Royals. Chasing 190, Dube came up with a 42-ball 64 which led to CSK’s defeat. MS Dhoni and CSK coach Stephen Fleming identified the talent that Dube had against spin and in the auctions for the 2022 edition, he was picked for Rs 4 crore.Still, Dube wasn’t a sure-fire selection. Before the IPL, five-time champions CSK had a training camp in Surat.During that camp, Dube’s over-boundaries, using his long levers against spin, were often beating MS Dhoni’s sixes by 20-30 metres. Some of those sixes even broke the window panes in the fourth-tier balconies of the stadium.That show convinced the management of his big-hitting abilities but Dube’s CSK stint hadn’t started on a happy note. He had given away 25 runs in the 19th over against LSG in Mumbai and had become a bit of a villain for the fans of the ‘Yellow Army’. But Dhoni stressed that bowling wasn’t the reason CSK had bought Dube and persisted with him purely as a batter.The temperamentally sound southpaw eventually announced himself with a 46-ball 95 against RCB in Mumbai, when he took down the likes of Wanindu Hasaranga and Glenn Maxwell. He hasn’t looked back since and despite several attempts by other franchises to lure him out of CSK, the team management has stuck with him, making him one of their highest-paid retainees for Rs 12 crore.While Dube has gone from strength to strength with his performances against spin, sometimes his technique against genuine pace has been a bit of a worry. The short ball has troubled him on and off but Dube has worked on it. These days, he is quite effective against medium-pacers, as was evident on Wednesday when he took on the likes of Zak Foulkes and Jacob Duffy.But during his four-year stint in CSK, one area that has been neglected a bit is his bowling. Due to the impact player rule, the think-tank hasn’t found the necessity to give him enough overs. But the Indian team management wants to use his bowling skills as well and in the Asia Cup final against Pakistan in Dubai last year, he was given the responsibility of opening the attack in spinfriendly conditions.Dube has developed a clever change of pace and the occasional wide yorker. One feels he isn’t too far behind with the ball to Nitish Reddy, who is being prepared as a back-up mediumpace allrounder for Hardik Pandya .",Shivam Dube has flourished in the middle order for Chennai Super Kings.

Bangladesh’s campaign at the Under-19 ongoing World Cup has ended amid criticism from the country’s cricket board over match scheduling and travel arrangements. The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) has accused the International Cricket Council (ICC) of unfair scheduling, saying repeated travel affected the team during the tournament.The issue comes at a time when the BCB has already been at odds with the ICC following its decision not to send the senior national team to India for the T20 World Cup, after which Bangladesh were replaced by Scotland. Now, BCB game development coordinator Habibul Bashar has raised concerns about the U19 team’s travel plan during the World Cup.""More than the approach, I think our calculations were lacking [against England and India]. But this [travel schedule] is something I want to highlight, even if people think I'm making excuses,"" Habibul told Bangladesh news outlet The Daily Star.He added, ""To avoid the boys getting too tired before the India match, the BCB actually paid for an internal flight out of its own pocket because the bus journey was too long and direct flights were scarce.""As per The Daily Star report, Bangladesh head coach Naveed Nawaz and several players expressed frustration over the schedule.The team had to travel from Harare to Bulawayo, a journey of nearly nine hours by bus during the monsoon season, ahead of their opening group match.Due to the importance of matches against India and New Zealand, the BCB arranged and paid for internal flights. However, the travel demands continued, with the team returning to Harare by bus for their match against the USA on January 23, before travelling again for the Super Six game against England in Bulawayo on January 26.“The schedule was very unfair to us. During the initial schedule, we were supposed to play two of our warm-up matches in Masvingo and travel to Bulawayo, which is a four-hour drive, for our opening two group-stage matches. Later, they [ICC] suddenly changed the schedule, and it meant we had to play two of our warm-up games at different venues, travelling back and forth,” Bashar said.He added, “We notified them [of the travel burden] before the tournament started. We asked them to move our practice games to avoid the back-and-forth travel, but they didn't listen. Once the tournament starts, you can't really change these things.”",Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) has accused the International Cricket Council (ICC) of unfair scheduling.

Cricket is increasingly becoming a game of sharp data, deeper insights and real-time analysis. Highlighting that shift, Google CEO Sundar Pichai has backed the use of artificial intelligence in cricket following Google’s new partnership with the International Cricket Council (ICC).Announcing the collaboration on social media, Pichai — a known cricket enthusiast — summed it up with a witty post on X: “Now Google can help with your Googly.” The remark underlined how AI is moving beyond stats sheets to decoding the nuances of the game as it unfolds.As part of the partnership, Google demonstrated how its latest AI model, Gemini 3 Pro, can analyse live cricket footage. The technology is capable of watching a match, listening to commentary and explaining what is happening in simple, accessible language.Google said the initiative aims to make cricket more engaging and inclusive, especially for newer audiences. The collaboration will span multiple Google platforms, including Android, Google Gemini, Google Pay and Google Pixel, creating an integrated digital ecosystem around the sport.From discovering highlights to understanding key moments and celebrating victories, the focus is on enriching the entire fan journey.In a separate post, the Google Gemini account explained the technology’s potential: “We partnered with @ICC to show how Gemini 3 Pro can analyse video content. By uploading a segment of the Cricket World Cup, Gemini can seamlessly process visual and audio data to identify key players, explain techniques, and highlight crucial turning points.”With the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup set to begin on February 7 in India and Sri Lanka, the timing of the announcement signals how AI-driven insights could soon become part of how fans consume and understand cricket.","Google CEO Sundar Pichai has backed the use of artificial intelligence in cricket.

NEW DELHI: Former India men’s hockey team coach Michael Nobbs, who reintroduced Aussieslike aggression and counter-attacking styles of field play after the team had fallen into the rut of European defensive skill sets, passed away at his home in Melbourne on Thursday after losing a long-running battle with lung cancer, which was first detected in March 2020.Nobbs, who coached the Bharat Chettri-led men’s side at the 2012 London Olympics, was 72. Nobbs’ India coaching stint lasted from June 2011 to July 2013.Nobbs was a member of the Australian team at the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles. His subsequent transition to full-time coaching made him one of the most respected tacticians in world hockey.He focused on counter-attacking strategies inspired by Australian methods and relied on a scientific approach. Nobbs successfully defeated cancer when it was initially diagnosed five years ago but suffered a relapse earlier last year.Nobbs took over the reins of the Indian men’s team at a particularly tough time. The highlight of Nobbs’ tenure was India’s qualification for the 2012 Olympics in London after the Beijing fall without losing a single match (six in total) during the qualifiers. However, India had a disappointing campaign in London, where the Chettri-led side finished last among 12 nations.",Former India men's hockey team coach Michael Nobbs has died at the age of 72.

Virat Kohli's handle is back

The cause of the panic earlier

NEW DELHI: After hours of confusion, concern and meme-fuelled speculation on Friday morning, India's batting legend Virat Kohli ’s Instagram account is back online. India’s most-followed Instagram handle, which had suddenly disappeared earlier on Friday, reappeared without any official explanation from either the former India captain or Instagram, bringing relief to millions of cricket fans who had feared something was amiss.Kohli’s verified account — followed by over 274 million users — had vanished from searches and Instagram page, with fans encountering the familiar message: “This page isn’t available.” The unexplained blackout triggered widespread panic across social media, with supporters flooding platforms like X and Instagram in search of answers. As speculation snowballed, no clarification emerged from Kohli, his management team or Meta, leaving fans to fill the silence with theories, humour and concern.The sudden return of the account later in the day has eased nerves, but the lack of an official statement has kept the mystery alive. It remains unclear whether the disappearance was the result of a technical glitch, a temporary deactivation or a platform-related issue.During the brief outage, fans even turned to Kohli’s wife, actor Anushka Sharma, flooding her comment sections with anxious and playful messages asking about the cricketer’s missing account.Anushka, who has largely stayed away from the spotlight in recent months, did not respond publicly, consistent with the couple’s recent preference for privacy.Adding to the intrigue, Kohli’s brother Vikas Kohli’s Instagram account was also reported missing during the same period, further fuelling speculation. Meanwhile, Kohli’s account on X remained active throughout, though he did not address the Instagram episode there either.The blackout came at a time when Kohli has been in strong cricketing form, recently enjoying a productive run in international cricket and gearing up for the upcoming IPL 2026 season with Royal Challengers Bengaluru. His Instagram account, a major hub for brand collaborations, personal updates and fan engagement, is considered one of the most influential athlete profiles in the world.For now, the King is back on Instagram — but with silence from all sides, fans are still waiting for answers on what caused India’s biggest social media scare of the day.","Virat Kohli's Instagram account is back online after disappearing on Friday morning.

Sanju Samson or Ishan Kishan? | Greenstone Lobo predicts the ideal player for T20 World Cup

With the Indian Test team going through one of its most turbulent phases in recent times, Gautam Gambhir has found himself under intense scrutiny. The head coach has endured a difficult stretch, highlighted by a 0-2 home Test defeat to South Africa and ODI series losses against Australia and New Zealand. While not everything during his tenure has gone wrong, India’s sharp decline in red-ball cricket has sparked concern, with the team currently placed fifth in the World Test Championship standings.Gambhir’s record is not without positives. Champions Trophy and Asia Cup triumphs have strengthened his standing, but the slide in Tests has overshadowed those successes. The 2-2 draw in England was expected to signal the dawn of the Shubman Gill-led era, yet two clean sweeps within a year have come as an unexpected blow. India are clearly in a phase of transition.South Africa Test captain Temba Bavuma knows that journey well. He oversaw a similar rebuild during his early years as captain, and the long-term payoff is now evident, with South Africa reigning as World Test Champions.Bavuma believes Gambhir’s red-ball challenges are far from over. With only five Tests scheduled in 2026, including two in New Zealand, where India last won a series in 2009/10, the road ahead looks demanding.“When it comes to the red-ball stuff, India are definitely a team in transition. There is nothing unique about where India find themselves in Test cricket. India coach Gautam Gambhir has a lot of pressure on his shoulders, and I think he is going to have to take it as it comes. He is going to have to find a way to buy himself time in the red-ball game, and I'm of the view that the performances in white-ball cricket may assist him,” Bavuma wrote in his column for ESPNCricinfo.Bavuma pointed out that India’s depth in limited-overs formats could provide Gambhir with breathing space.“In limited-overs cricket, India have a lot of resources from which to select. The 2026 T20 World Cup is also in their favour, as it will be on home ground, co-hosted by India and Sri Lanka in February-March. In ODIs, Kohli and Rohit will naturally take on a lot more responsibility from a performance and leadership point of view. So I think Gambhir will be okay in terms of his position. However, from a red-ball point of view, it's going to be tough for this Indian team in the near future. ”Amid speculation about the possibility of appointing a separate red-ball coach, an idea denied by the BCCI , Bavuma downplayed the merit of split coaching roles. He suggested Gambhir is viewed as a long-term investment and is unlikely to face removal before the end of his contract.“Some may speak more to the narrative that Gambhir should perhaps carry on with the white-ball stuff and let someone else fulfil the Test cricket duties. Splitting the red- and white-ball coaching roles was something we gave a go within the Proteas set-up back in 2023,” he said.“At the time there was sense behind the split rule. But now having one coach across all formats works a lot better for players from a continuity point of view. Moreover, it's advantageous from a philosophy and playing style point of view. I don't think a lot of teams are going with the split-format system anymore, and to be honest, I'm not really in favour of that rule. If anything, it just confuses the players, because in one format a certain type of language is spoken and then in another format, a couple of weeks later, you need to adjust. Gambhir's contract runs through to the 2027 ODI World Cup and India just need to back him.”While T20 cricket remains Gambhir’s strongest suit, with results backing his credentials, Bavuma believes the real test lies in red-ball cricket. Success at the upcoming T20 World Cup could strengthen Gambhir’s position further, but Test cricket demands patience and long-term clarity.“In terms of the way Gambhir controls his current group of Test players, I think it would be best to be clear and say: ‘Guys, it's going to be a tough few months on away tours but let's focus on the long term.’ But he is going to have to back his horses and, at some point, those horses are going to have to exit their pens and gallop for him,” Bavuma added.",Gautam Gambhir has endured a difficult stretch as India's Test coach. India are currently fifth in the World Test Championship standings. South Africa Test captain Temba Bavuma believes India are in a phase of transition. Bavuma downplays the possibility of appointing a separate red-ball coach. The 2026 T20 World Cup is co-hosted by India and Sri Lanka in February-March.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127802690,imgsize-885543,width-400,resizemode-4/gautam-gambhir.jpg"

The Inside Story Behind India’s World Cup Win: Shafali & Deepti Reveal WPL'S IMPACT

Gujarat Giants finally ended their losing streak against Mumbai Indians with a thrilling 11-run win to book their place in the Women’s Premier League Eliminator, thanks to a brilliant all-round effort from skipper Ashleigh Gardner and Georgia Wareham.Electing to bat first, Gujarat looked in trouble early, losing Anushka Sharma (33) and Sophie Devine (25) in quick succession for just two additional runs as disciplined bowling from Amelia Kerr (2/26) and Shabnim Ismail (1/29) slowed the scoring. But Gardner and Wareham rescued the innings with a vital 71-run partnership. Gardner’s aggressive 46 off 28 balls, featuring seven fours and a six, and Wareham’s 44 from 26 helped Gujarat post a competitive 167 for 4, with 61 of those runs coming in the last five overs.Chasing 168 on a tricky wicket proved tough for Mumbai. Skipper Harmanpreet Kaur fought valiantly, scoring an unbeaten 82 off 48 balls, including eight fours and four sixes, but the required run rate proved too steep. Gujarat bowlers held their nerve, with Gardner picking up 1/26 and Wareham returning 2/26, dismissing key batters Amelia Kerr (20) and Sanskriti Gupta (0). Mumbai managed 156/7, falling short despite a late onslaught from Harmanpreet.The win marks Gujarat’s first-ever victory over the defending champions after eight successive defeats and secures their spot in Tuesday’s Eliminator.

MUMBAI: Enjoying the form of his life, Mumbai captain Siddhesh Lad slammed his fifth hundred of the season - fourth on the trot - crossing the 700-run milestone in a Ranji Trophy edition for the first time to continue his side’s domination over Delhi in their last league match of the Ranji Trophy at the MCA ground in BKC on Friday.Replying to 221, Mumbai appeared shaky at one point when they were reduced to 136 for five as the in-form Sarfaraz Khan fell for 24 (27b, 4x4), but Lad, known as the ‘Crisis Man’ of the Mumbai team since ages, joined forces with Suved Parkar (53 not out, 111b, 4x4, 2x6) for an unbeaten 130-run stand in 211 balls for the sixth wicket. Buoyed by the duo’s stand, Mumbai finished the day at 266 for five, with a lead of 45 runs.In prolific touch this season, Lad is now in august company of the legends of Mumbai cricket. He is only the third Mumbai batter to score five centuries in a single edition of the Ranji Trophy-Rusi Modi did it in 1944-45, and the legendary Sachin Tendulkar achieved the feat in the 1994-95 season. The 33-year-old, who is currently the fourth-highest run-getter of the Ranji Trophy this season, having scored 736 runs in seven matches at 105.14, will have a chance to break the record of these greats when Mumbai play their quarterfinal match at BKC from Feb 6.Lad began the 2025-26 season with a century (116) against Jammu & Kashmir at Srinagar, followed by 80 versus Chhattisgarh at BKC. In his last four Ranji Trophy matches, he has slammed centuries against Himachal (127 at BKC), (170 against Pondicherry), 104 against Hyderabad and then 102 not out versus Delhi. In each outing, he has looked fluent and at ease while scoring runs, finding gaps at will. If Lad continues his rich vein of form in the knockouts, will the national selectors consider the middle-order batter for the Test series against Sri Lanka in Aug?Even in the 2024-25 season, Lad, whose father-cum-coach Dinesh is the childhood coach of former India captain Rohit Sharma and allrounder Shardul Thakur, was in great flow, finishing as the top run-getter for Mumbai, having scored 602 runs in seven matches@60.20, with two hundreds and an equal number of fifties.Indeed, it’s an unbelievable comeback by a man who was playing for Goa in the 2022-23 season, missed the 2023-24 season as he was served a ‘cooling off period’ period (mandatory for those who leave Mumbai and play for another state), and returned to play for Mumbai only in the last season.Arriving at the crease in the morning when Mumbai were 18 for two, having lost nightwatchman Tushar Deshpande (1), Lad appeared at ease throughout his stay at the crease, starting off with a beautiful flick shot to mid-wicket for four off Bunty Grewal before cutting, pulling and driving Delhi’s seamers with authority, while sweeping and punching the spinners off the backfoot with ease.Mumbai were 44 for three when they lost Akhil Herwadkar (12, was struck by a Money Grewal bouncer earlier in the day), but Lad calmed their nerves with a 63-run stand in 117 balls with Musheer Khan (57, 114b, 7x4). Much to Musheer’s misfortune, the youngster had to go back to the pavilion because of a howler by the umpire, as the batter was adjudged caught behind down the legside off debutant left-arm spinner Rahul Chaudhary despite there being daylight between bat and ball.Coming off a double century in the last Ranji game against Hyderabad, Sarfaraz hit a few delightful boundaries during his brief stay at the crease, but it was Parkar who provided Lad with solid support and Mumbai the advantage of the when he pulled Chaudhary for a six to deep mid-wicket for a six.Asked if he was hoping for a maiden India call-up sometime this year, Lad said he does not look too far ahead even though his goal remains to play for India. “It has always been my ultimate goal to play for the country. But right now, I am just trying to do my job. My first goal is to win the Ranji Trophy with Mumbai, since I have come back from some other state and MCA has shown faith in me,” he told reporters later.","Mumbai captain Siddhesh Lad hits his fifth hundred of the season - fourth on the trot.

Sanju Samson or Ishan Kishan? | Greenstone Lobo predicts the ideal player for T20 World Cup

Thiruvananthapuram: India’s final T20I against New Zealand in Thiruvananthapuram on Saturday may wear the look of a dead rubber, but scratch the surface and it is anything but. With the series already sealed 3-1, the immediate result matters far less than the larger destination.Every road now leads to the T20 World Cup, and this game represents India’s final dress rehearsal — the last chance to bring clarity to combinations, roles and intent before the real business begins on Feb 7.For the team management, this is about polishing the rough edges and turning promise into a well-oiled machine. Winning has been reassuring, but the focus has shifted decisively towards preparation.Against an ultra-competitive New Zealand, India have been able to test depth, temperament and adaptability — precisely the boxes they need to tick ahead of a showpiece event.Batting coach Sitanshu Kotak was candid on the eve of the match about the series’ importance in shaping India’s World Cup blueprint. Rhythm, he stressed, comes from time in the middle — from playing across conditions, experimenting with combinations and giving players clearly defined opportunities.“It’s been a very important series for us,” Kotak said. “Before the World Cup, as many days as you play, you start finding your rhythm, your combinations, and you try to give players opportunities.That’s what these games are for.”That philosophy has guided India’s selection calls so far. Kotak underlined that decisions are being made with balance and long-term planning in mind, rather than being driven by short-term numbers. The emphasis is on building a batting unit that can attack relentlessly without losing its structural integrity.At the heart of those discussions is the top order. India are keen to lock in combinations that allow aggression in the powerplay while retaining flexibility for different match scenarios. Tilak Varma continues to be central to that thinking — a batter who embodies the aggressive core India want, but with the adaptability to adjust gears as situations demand.The wicketkeeper-batter slot is another moving piece. Kotak acknowledged the value Ishan Kishan brings whenever he plays, highlighting his ability to keep wickets and bat at the top — a versatility that mirrors what Sanju Samson offers.“Whenever Ishan plays, he tends to bat well,” Kotak noted.""He is most likely to feature tomorrow, subject to final clearance from the physio,"" Kotak added.That call could shape India’s batting template, particularly with an eye on explosive starts in the powerplay — a non-negotiable in modern T20 cricket.For India, this final outing is about arriving at the World Cup with a settled framework and clear roles. The jigsaw puzzle is nearly complete; Thiruvananthapuram offers the last chance to fit the final piece.",India take on New Zealand in their final T20I in Thiruvananthapuram on Saturday.

Sanju Samson or Ishan Kishan? | Greenstone Lobo predicts the ideal player for T20 World Cup

TOI

As the temple bells echoed across Thiruvananthapuram, the Indian team, led by captain Suryakumar Yadav , bowed in reverence to the hallowed Sree Padmanabhaswamy Temple on Friday morning. One person's absence cut through the moment like a deafening silence. Sanju Samson — the local hero, crowd favourite — was obviously missing, barred by temple customs from entering the shrine. If anyone could have used the comfort of divine intervention, it was Samson, still searching for the spark to reignite his faltering batting form.What followed in Visakhapatnam two days earlier was all too familiar. A 15-ball stay, little authority, and another subdued exit. Mitchell Santner delivered the final verdict, a delivery sliding on to beat Samson’s defence. Perched on the back foot, bat groping outside the line, the dismissal was technically explainable and emotionally predictable. It barely disturbed the evening, yet it echoed loudly within a career already heavy with unresolved questions.The numbers offer little refuge. Forty runs across four matches invites impatience, not indulgence. Samson’s opportunity in Vizag came only because Ishan Kishan was nursing a niggle — and Kishan’s form since has only sharpened the selection arithmetic ahead of the T20 World Cup. He is batting with clarity and intent, qualities selectors tend to reward.Should Samson be left out of the showpiece event, India may be forced into an unconventional top order featuring three left-handers — Abhishek Sharma , Kishan and Tilak Varma. It raises questions of balance, but given Samson’s returns, it is a compromise selectors may be willing to accept.On the eve of the fifth T20, India's batting coach Sitanshu Kotak came out in his support. ""Sanju is a senior player. He has not scored as many runs as everybody would like to, but that's part of a cricketer's career. It's up to an individual how to keep his mind strong and our job is to keep him in a good frame of mind.""Part of the problem is that nearly a decade after his international debut, Samson still lacks a clearly defined role. There have been stretches when permanence appeared inevitable, most notably a seven-match run against Bangladesh and South Africa where he struck three centuries as an opener.Yet, each surge was followed by a reset. The England series exposed familiar fault lines, a middling IPL stalled momentum, and by the Asia Cup he was pushed down the order to accommodate Shubman Gill.Batting down the order has dulled his rhythm and heightened his vulnerability against spin.Former Kerala pacer Tinu Yohannan weighs in. “There’s nothing wrong with his technique. He’s always been a top-order player, and was never a finisher,” Yohannan told“Lack of role clarity may have hurt his chances. If he is dropped, tough luck — but good for Indian cricket because we have so many options now.”India’s bowling coach Morne Morkel insists Samson is one hit from rediscovering his touch. But T20 cricket can be unforgiving.There may yet be one final audition — India’s last T20 before the World Cup. Samson’s career has always existed on fine margins. Right now, those margins are narrowing fast.",Sanju Samson has scored just 40 runs in four matches for India. The batsman has struggled to find his best form in T20 cricket.

Sanju Samson or Ishan Kishan? | Greenstone Lobo predicts the ideal player for T20 World Cup

India’s batting coach Sitanshu Kotak has thrown his weight behind Sanju Samson , insisting that a short run of poor scores has not shaken the team management’s belief in the wicketkeeper-batter.Samson has struggled in the ongoing five-match T20I series against New Zealand, managing only 40 runs from four outings at an average of 10. Despite the numbers, Kotak made it clear that the staff see this as a temporary phase rather than a decline in ability.“Sanju is a senior player, he is very good. He probably has not scored as many runs as everybody would like, but that's part of the cricketing career. Sometimes you have five innings in a row where you score so many runs and sometimes you have a little tight period,” Kotak said while addressing the media on the eve of the fifth T20I.He stressed that Samson has the full backing of the think tank during this challenging stretch.“It's all up to an individual how to keep his mind strong and, obviously, our job is to keep him in a good frame of mind. He is practicing and he is working hard, so we all know what Sanju is capable of. I don't think anything more to say about Sanju because he has been really good,” he added.Those words were reflected on the training ground at the Greenfield Stadium, where Samson spent close to half an hour batting in the nets. He began by facing side-armers Hari and Raghu, then took on left-arm spinner Axar Patel. The session was followed by a brief discussion with head coach Gautam Gambhir and bowling coach Morne Morkel. If he features on Saturday, it will mark Samson’s first international appearance at his home venue.Kotak also highlighted the value of the recent white-ball fixtures as India fine-tune their preparations for the T20 World Cup, calling the New Zealand and South Africa series important building blocks.“It's been a very important series for us. It is obviously useful because before the World Cup you kind of start getting into a rhythm, you start finding the combinations and you try and give players an opportunity,” he said.“All that you can do when we are playing. So, these five games, and obviously, before that South Africa (series) is also very useful for us.”On team selection, Kotak indicated that Ishan Kishan is likely to return for the final T20I after missing the previous match with an injury.“Ishan Kishan has always been good whenever he got an opportunity. Sometimes wicketkeeper batters don't get opportunities. But whenever Ishan has played, he has always done well,” he said.“And very likely (he will play), at the moment, as far as I know. The physio is here for practice. So, physios will take a call. But I feel very likely.”Kotak credited the presence of naturally aggressive players such as Kishan, Suryakumar Yadav and Abhishek Sharma for allowing India to maintain an attacking approach throughout the series. He reserved special praise for Abhishek’s clarity and technique, noting that his strokeplay is rooted in solid fundamentals rather than reckless hitting.“He does speak to Gautam, he does speak to me and Surya and some other players also. So, he is very open to everything,” Kotak said, before adding that Abhishek’s shots are played “on merit of the ball” with strong basics.The batting coach was also pleased to see captain Suryakumar rediscover form with consecutive half-centuries after a quiet spell.“There will be a dry patch in T20s and you still have to go hard, you still have to play for the team, which is what he did. So glad that he got a good two innings, that's a good sign for the team anyway,” Kotak said.","India's batting coach Sitanshu Kotak has thrown his weight behind wicketkeeper- batter Sanju Samson. Samson has struggled in the ongoing five-match T20I series against New Zealand, managing only 40 runs from four outings at an average of 10. Kotak made it clear that the staff see this as a temporary phase rather than a decline in ability.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127803250,imgsize-124898,width-400,resizemode-4/india-new-zealand-cricket.jpg"

When Ivo goes back with the urn, the urn;

""In affectionate remembrance of English cricket which died at The Oval, 29th August, 1882. Deeply lamented by a large circle of sorrowing friends and acquaintances, RIP. NB The body will be cremated and the Ashes taken to Australia. ""Australia’s first win on English soil against a full-strength England side on August 29, 1882 led to this mock ""obituary"", written by young London journalist Reginald Shirley Brooks. It appeared in the Sporting Times and laid the foundation for what would later become one of cricket’s most enduring traditions.England’s seven-run defeat at The Oval had already been followed by plans for a tour of Australia. The Honourable Ivo Bligh, later the eighth Earl of Darnley, had been chosen to lead the side even before that loss. But the tone of the tour changed after the defeat. Three weeks later, when the team set sail, the mission was clear: recover the Ashes.The tour comprised three Tests. Australia won the first Test at Melbourne by nine wickets. England responded in the second Test at the same venue, winning by 27 runs. With the series level, the third Test became decisive. England won by 69 runs, and it was widely accepted that they had ""recovered"" the Ashes.With honours considered restored, both teams agreed to play an additional match. This game, later designated retrospectively as the fourth Test (Test No. 13 in chronological order), was played at the Sydney Cricket Ground starting February 17, 1883. It is this match that stands apart in cricket history, not just for the result, but for an experiment that has never been repeated.Bligh won the toss and chose to bat. England made 263 in their first innings. AG Steel remained unbeaten on 135. Four of the six Australian bowlers shared the wickets. George Giffen, carrying a leg injury, did not bowl.Australia replied with 262. George Bonnor, opening the batting, scored 87 in 165 minutes, hitting seven fours. Captain Billy Murdoch was dismissed without scoring but ran between the wickets for the injured Giffen, who made 27. Wicketkeeper Jack Blackham added 57. England used seven bowlers, with five of them taking wickets.England’s second innings produced 197. Billy Bates, the Yorkshire slow round-arm bowler known among friends as ""The Duke"" because of his taste in dress, top-scored with 48. Australia used five bowlers, and each finished with two wickets.Australia then chased 199. Alec Bannerman scored 63 in 175 minutes, with six fours and a SIX. Murdoch once again ran for Giffen, who added 32 to go with his earlier 27. Australia won by four wickets.The match officials were Edward Elliott, who had played eight first-class matches mainly for Victoria, and James Swift, who had just one first-class appearance. The four innings totals — 263, 262, 197 and 199 — showed how closely matched the contest was, with a compliance factor of just two runs.What set this match apart, however, was an agreement reached before play began. In a decision unique in cricket history, it was decided that each innings would be played on a different pitch. Four innings, four separate wickets. Wisden recorded the experiment with restraint, noting simply: ""Each innings was played on a fresh wicket.""That decision, taken jointly by both teams, has never been repeated at Test or first-class level. More than a century later, this forgotten Test remains the only match where the idea was put into practice, leaving behind a brief but striking example of how early cricket was still willing to test the limits of its own laws.After that tour, The Ashes were returned to England on January 30, 1883, in the form of a burnt bail in an urn.It was long thought that the Ashes — a small urn believed to hold the remains of a bail burned after the third match — were gifted to Bligh by a group of women in Melbourne. However, in 1998, Lord Darnley’s daughter-in-law, then aged 82, said the contents were actually the ashes of her mother-in-law’s veil, not a bail. Other accounts have suggested the ashes may have come from a ball. As a result, the exact origin of the Ashes remains disputed.After Lord Darnley died in 1927, the urn was presented to the MCC by his Australian-born widow, Florence. The urn is now kept at the cricket museum at Lord’s, along with a red and gold velvet bag made for it and the scorecard from the 1882 match.The text on the urn is as follows:-","Australia's first win on English soil against a full-strength England side in 1882 led to a mock ""obituary"" in the Sporting Times. England’s seven-run defeat at The Oval had already been followed by plans for a tour of Australia. The Honourable Ivo Bligh, later the eighth Earl of Darnley, had been chosen to lead the side.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127803724,imgsize-32932,width-400,resizemode-4/lkj-21.jpg"

Poll How do you feel about the crowd's behavior during the African Cup final? Completely unacceptable A result of passion Somewhat understandable

Africa’s football governing body has handed down fines exceeding $1 million and imposed multiple bans following a chaotic African Cup final that descended into protests, crowd trouble and ugly scenes on and off the pitch.The Confederation of African Football (CAF) announced the sanctions on Wednesday in response to the disorder-marred final between Senegal and hosts Morocco on January 18, a match that featured a dramatic walk-off protest, fans attempting to storm the field and even scuffles involving journalists. Crucially, CAF clarified that the bans apply only to African competitions and will not affect the upcoming World Cup in June, for which both Senegal and Morocco have already qualified.CAF fined the Senegalese Football Federation $615,000 and the Moroccan federation $315,000 for unsporting and improper conduct by players, coaching staff and supporters. Senegal coach Pape Thiaw received the heaviest individual punishment — a five-match ban in CAF competitions and a personal fine of $100,000 — after leading his players off the pitch in protest at a late penalty awarded to Morocco.The final was halted for around 15 minutes following the walk-off.When play resumed, Morocco missed the penalty and Senegal went on to clinch the African title with a 1-0 win after extra time.The fallout extended far beyond the walk-off. Supporters tried to breach the pitch, players from both teams clashed on the sidelines, and reporters from Senegal and Morocco were involved in fights in press areas. One of the most bizarre flashpoints came when Moroccan ball boys attempted to snatch a towel from Senegal goalkeeper Edouard Mendy, apparently to distract him. That incident alone resulted in an additional $200,000 fine for Morocco’s federation.Morocco coach Walid Regragui later described the spectacle as giving African football a “shameful” image, a comment that resonated as scrutiny intensified on the country, which will co-host the 2030 World Cup with Spain and Portugal and hopes to stage the final at the 115,000-capacity Hassan II Stadium currently under construction.CAF also banned Senegal’s Iliman Ndiaye and Ismaila Sarr for two matches each, while Morocco’s Achraf Hakimi received a two-match ban with one suspended. Ismael Saibari was hit with a three-match ban and a $100,000 fine for unsporting behaviour.An appeal by Morocco to have the result annulled and the title awarded to them was dismissed. The match even strained diplomatic ties, though Senegal Prime Minister Ousmane Sonko later played down the fallout, calling the reaction “emotional outbursts produced by fervor” rather than a deeper rift.","Africa's football governing body hands down fines exceeding $1 million.

The Chinese Football Association (CFA) announced Thursday that 73 people, including former national team coach Li Tie, have been banned for life, and 13 professional clubs have been fined for match-fixing and corruption.The punishments come as part of a wider anti-corruption campaign under President Xi Jinping, which has removed several CFA officials and banned dozens of players for match-fixing and gambling.The statement did not say when the most recent match-fixing occurred or give details of the cases.The punishments were made after a ""systematic review"" and were needed ""to enforce industry discipline, purify the football environment, and maintain fair competition"", the CFA wrote on its official social media account Thursday.Li Tie, a former Everton player who coached China’s national team from 2019 to 2021, is already serving a 20-year prison sentence for bribery, after being sentenced in December 2024.Chen Xuyuan, former CFA chairman, is also serving a life sentence for accepting $11 million in bribes.Of the 16 teams in the 2025 Chinese Super League, 11 will face point deductions and fines.Tianjin Jinmen Tiger and last season’s runners-up Shanghai Shenhua will each lose 10 points and pay a one million yuan ($144,000) fine when the 2026 season begins.Shanghai Port, champions for the past three seasons, and Beijing Guoan will each lose five points and pay a 400,000-yuan fine.","73 people, including former national team coach Li Tie, have been banned for life. 13 professional clubs have been fined for match-fixing and corruption.

Poll Are you excited for the start of the 2025-26 Indian Super League season? Absolutely! Somewhat Not Really Not at all

The 2025-26 Indian Super League (ISL) season is tentatively scheduled to get underway on February 14 with a double header featuring Mohun Bagan Super Giant vs Kerala Blasters at the Salt Lake Stadium in Kolkata and FC Goa vs Inter Kashi at Fatorda in Goa. The fixtures, running until May 17, are provisional as the All India Football Federation (AIFF) is looking to find a broadcaster to showcase India's top-division football.The AIFF is in the process of finding a suitable bidder to produce and broadcast the 91-match competition. If and when the bidder is found, the fixtures could be jiggled to meet the broadcasters' criteria.Four entities - FanCode, Sony Sports Network, Zee Sports and UK-based Two Circles - had attended the pre-bid conference. There is a possibility that more could throw their hat in the ring before the February 1 final date for submission of bids.As the process continues to unravel behind the scenes at the Football House (AIFF's headquarters) in New Delhi, there are a couple of questions that remain unanswered. Chief among them is the relegation clause.Promotion has been a part of the ISL since the 2022-23 season with Inter Kashi the latest team to come up the ladder from the I-League. Relegation, however, has never been a feature of the league that began in 2014.After Football Sports Development Limited's (FSDL) contract to run the ISL expired in December 2025, it is the first time that the AIFF are in charge of operating the ISL. The position on relegation gets trickier because of the Supreme Court-ratified Constitution.As per the Constitution adopted in October 2025, AIFF have the control over relegation rule. As per Article 63, ""Without prejudice to the foregoing, the AIFF shall have the right and discretion to take all decisions of any nature pertaining to any aspect of any competition. While exercising such discretion, the AIFF shall have due regard to the interests of the sport of Football in India and shall not be bound by any request or demand of any third party in this regard. If any of its powers or functions are delegated to third parties, such delegation shall be done in good faith and also ensuring that the AIFF retains primacy on all Essential Aspects.""A closer look at the definition of ""Essential Aspects"" explains it as ""preservation of the sanctity of promotion and relegation, and ensuring of compliance with FIFA/AFC statues with respect to the sport of football.""In essence, promotion and relegation are mandatory from the 2025/26 season onwards in the ISL.An AIFF insider told TimesofIndia.com that the relegation rules will be followed as per what is written in the Constitution.However, a majority of ISL clubs are not happy with the idea. With the season already starting five months late and to be played in a truncated format, the clubs are expecting minimal revenue. The financial strain has forced the clubs to reduce costs through operational cutbacks and salary corrections. A few clubs even paused first team operations before a headway arrived on January 6 courtesy Sports Minister Mansukh Mandaviya's intervention.One ISL club official has even asked AIFF to take cognisance of the situation and invoke force majeure, which is possible as per the AIFF Constitution.Article 78 reads: ""The General Body shall have the final decision on any matters not provided for in this Constitution and Regulations, or in cases of force majeure. General Body shall be competent to decide whether a situation amounts to force majeure scenario or not.""As things stand, AIFF has not approached the Supreme Court seeking a one-time relaxation from relegation for the 2025-26 ISL season. With two weeks to go into the start of the season, it remains to be seen if they will go against not just the Constitution but also the AFC Statutes.","The 2025-26 Indian Super League (ISL) season is tentatively scheduled to get underway on February 14.

I'm really happy to have in this state of form and above all, because of the great work they are doing.""They are really committed to the team, they are the first who are pressing... they're giving this effort and solidarity that we need from them, so I'm very happy that their reward comes in the form of goals.""It was a lively but imprecise start at Villarreal's Estadio de la Ceramica, as the game glowed but neither side was able to seriously threaten.Georges Mikautadze lashed a volley narrowly wide after veteran forward Gerard Moreno found him with a floating cross.At the other end, Madrid midfielder Arda Guler fired straight at Villarreal stopper Luiz Junior after some tidy footwork, and then shot high over the bar at the end of a swift break.Villarreal's Juan Foyth limped off hurt in a blow for the hosts, who created a good chance for Pape Gueye just before the break.The Senegal midfielder, a champion at the Africa Cup of Nations last weekend, powered narrowly wide of the post.Vinicius, who excelled in Madrid's 6-1 Champions League rout of Monaco in midweek, also came close with a rasping effort that sailed across Luiz Junior's goal and wide.The 25-year-old Brazil forward went a 13th straight La Liga match without scoring, but was involved as Mbappe found the net two minutes into the second half.- 'Nightmare for defences' -Vinicius came into the box from the left flank and his low cross was blocked but Mbappe was on hand to squeeze home his 20th league goal of the campaign from close range.""They are a nightmare for defences,"" said Madrid goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois. ""I hope they can keep bringing joy.""Villarreal had the better of the second half as they worked hard to pull level, but Moreno spurned their best chance by firing inches over when well-placed.In stoppage time, Mbappe was felled clumsily by Alfonso Pedraza in the box and the French forward cheekily dinked home the resulting penalty to seal Madrid's victory.Mbappe's team-mate Brahim Diaz, who missed a similar attempted Panenka penalty for Morocco in the Africa Cup of Nations final, was on the pitch to see it as he returned to action for his club.""For you,"" Mbappe appeared to say to Diaz during the celebration, indicating it was a gesture of support.""For me, the most important thing is that (the players) are united, we saw it last Wednesday with Vinicius's goal (against Monaco) and we saw it again today, with Brahim,"" Arbeloa told reporters.The Yellow Submarine are now 10 points behind leaders Madrid, having played one fewer match than Arbeloa's side.""We have to be a bit more accurate in attack against these kinds of teams,"" admitted Villarreal midfielder Alberto Moleiro.Elsewhere, fifth-placed Espanyol fell to a 3-2 defeat at Valencia that left them seven points behind Villarreal.",Kylian Mbappe scores twice as Real Madrid beat Villarreal 2-0 in La Liga. Alvaro Arbeloa's side move two points clear of Barcelona at the top of the table.

Having made a blockbuster €140 million move from Bayer Leverkusen to Anfield, Florian Wirtz has had a tricky start to life at Anfield and in the Premier League . Widely regarded as one of Europe’s most gifted creative attackers, the 22-year-old Germany international arrived at Liverpool on the back of a standout spell in Bundesliga, where his freedom, intelligence and ability to control games marked him out as a generational talent.In the 29 games he's played at Liverpool across competitions, he's scored four goals and provided seven assists.Before the eventual move to the Merseyside, there was interest also from Bayern Munich. But Wirtz’s decision to embrace the Premier League underlines both his ambition and belief in Liverpool’s long-term vision.In this wide-ranging exclusive conversation with TimesofIndia.com, facilitated by JioStar, Wirtz reflects on the pull of Liverpool’s history, the challenge of meeting sky-high expectations, and the clarity provided by the manager’s plans for the team.Liverpool's immense stature as a club first and foremost. The team that clinched the Premier League last year. Above all, the manager's vision convinced me.Tactics aren't much different from the Bundesliga or Germany duty.In-game, it's the physicality I need to adapt to most.They've had many great midfielders. I just focus on giving my best on the pitch. I don't know what sets me apart—whether I do better or they did. I simply want to play my game and achieve success with the club.Probably the first Newcastle game. It was wildly intense — the early red card, endless long balls, two-footed tackles, everything. The crowd went berserk. That moment made me think, 'This league is different from the Bundesliga.’I don't measure success in specific terms. I focus on delivering my best performance wherever I am — at Liverpool or with the national team—to be vital for the squad and drive achievements.

Route 66

Trump Booed Loudly As Miami Stadium Erupts During College Football Playoff

AI to help with planning itineraries

BENGALURU: For those who are preparing to pack their bags to watch the likes of Lionel Messi, Kylian Mbappe, and Lamine Yamal in any of the 11 American cities that will host the World Cup 2026 matches, the Americans are determined to make it football’s best ever showpiece event. Awaiting the fans are fast-tracked visas and curated experiences, including road trips to explore the heart of the US, Route 66 being the most famous of them.The US joins Mexico and Canada to host the FIFA World Cup, the games in the US will begin with the hosts taking on Paraguay in a Group D match in Los Angeles on June 12, day after the tournament kicks off in Mexico City. That will set football (soccer for Americans) rolling across 11 cities for the next one month. The Americans, who put American football, baseball and basketball, above the world’s most popular sport are keen to make it the biggest ever spectacle for the millions of fans offering them an unbelievable time.“From New York to Miami to LA and Seattle, it’s quite a diverse list of host cities. I think each of the host cities are excited to put on a great show, and really engage their communities because it is very much about the communities that are hosting as well.The fan fests are going to be a great way to go beyond the stadium into the community. Local food, culture, music, and engaging with local communities as well. It’s hard to describe how exciting it’s going to be. I think it's going to be beyond any of our expectations,” Fred Dixon, president and CEO of Brand USA, told TOI in an exclusive interview.Speaking on the sidelines of the Brand USA Travel Week India held here, Dixon said the authorities also plan to make it easy for the spectators to get the US visa. “If you decide to buy tickets to the World Cup and you don’t have your visa yet, there actually is a way to facilitate that process to identify yourself as a ticket holder, and then the State Department will work to facilitate the visa processing faster for those travelers,” Dixon said.Dixon was particularly excited to welcome the Indians travelling for the World Cup. “In places like New Jersey and New York, places like Atlanta and Dallas, Texas, those are obviously big communities. The communities will come to life through the fan fests and so there will be the official fan fest events for every host city. So you'll be in the communities with the locals or with your friends and the people you're traveling with. With more than 5 million Indians living in the US, seeking out and traveling with or spending time with family and friends will be a big component of that,” Dixon said.On whether there will be any relaxation for the fans from Haiti and Iran, Dixon didn’t have an answer. “You’d have to check with the State Department,” he said.For those millions who get entry into the US and the special ones who get lucky through the draw, FIFA said there were 500 million requests for tickets to watch the matches, the US wanted to wow them. On top of the list are the road trips including the iconic Route 66.“It’s a unique moment as well because it’s the 250th anniversary of America. So you have America, 250 activities happening all across the country as well. The other anniversary that’s happening this year is Route 66. It's the 100th anniversary of the famous highway (opened on Nov 11, 1926) that connects California and Chicago -- from Chicago to Santa Monica. It winds through small, interesting towns all across the west of the US. And so you’re going to see a lot of themes around road trips, that freedom of the open road in America. So I think there will be a lot of curated experiences around road trips,” said Dixon.“In the host cities themselves, you’re going to have lots of curated experiences, whether it relates to museums, art, exhibitions. The travelers are going to benefit from the focus on a lot of Americana, both historical, but also what American brands, I think, have meant to the world. The Fleet Week, which is one of the big celebrations in New York every year in the harbour, has been moved from what is normally in late May. It’s now moving to July 4th. So just imagine the Statue of Liberty with fireworks and all the Navy fleets, you know. It’s expected to have the largest gathering of tall ships in the world for America 250, which will travel up the east coast of the US. So there is an unlimited amount of curated experiences to have,” Dixon added.“At americathebeautiful.com , we actually have AI integration to help with trip inspiration, particularly when you are dealing with an event that is multi-city, multi-date. We know what the group schedule will be, but as teams advance beyond the group, who’s going to the quarterfinals, who’s going to the semifinals, how would you route yourself? The itineraries may be dynamic if you’re following a particular team. And so our new website has an AI component built into it to help with itinerary suggestions and plannings and ideas.“You also can integrate what your passion points are. So if it’s culture, if it’s history and food, it will help give you highlights and ideas for how you can route yourself. It’s not a booking platform, but it's an inspiration platform. We’ve used AI in a way to help tap into really what is the best of America, and then to inspire travelers to travel, you know, far and to travel deep when they're in the US to explore the World cup, specifically,” Dixon signed off.","The US joins Mexico and Canada to host the FIFA World Cup.

Seahawks brace for Klint Kubiak interest as Mike Macdonald backs his coordinator

The Seahawks did not just win games this season. But found an offensive identity that pushed them all the way to the Super Bowl . Ever since Seattle handed Klint Kubiak the keys to the offense, the results have been loud. The offense rose into the league’s top tier, and now the man behind it could be on his way out.That puts head coach Mike Macdonald in a strange spot. He is preparing for the biggest game of his career while knowing he might soon lose the coach who helped reshape his team. Still, Macdonald has not held back when talking about Klint Kubiak and what he means to the locker room.Kubiak’s work in 2025 turned heads across the league. Seattle averaged 28.4 points per game during the season and ranked among the NFL’s most elite playoff offences. That rise from the middle of the pack last year to a Super Bowl unit now explains why teams with head coach vacancies want to talk to him.Macdonald made his feelings clear during a January media session ahead of the playoffs when he was asked about his offensive coordinator.“I think the thing that I appreciate the most about Klint is he’s a team player,” Macdonald said. “It’s all about what’s best for the team all the time.”HC continued, “And he takes a lot of pride in that, that it’s a team effort. So he’d be the first to say that the rest of his staff does a great job, and the players are the ones who make it come to life. So I think there’s a humility behind how he operates [that] creates an environment where you’re getting all those positive aspects for everybody involved.”Also, Kubiak's presence has improved the Seahawks' offensive rhythm. Currently, the team is 14-3 and leads the NFC West. Plus, it secures the No. 1 seed in the NFC for the first time since 2013.Now the timing gets tricky. League rules allow Kubiak to interview in person only with teams he already met virtually. Reports link him to the Raiders and Cardinals jobs. Any move must wait until after the Super Bowl. Inside the building, players know what could come. They also know why it is happening. Success brings attention. Macdonald understands that better than anyone. He hired Kubiak to give the offense direction. He got that and more. If this run ends with a title, it will also likely mark the final chapter of Kubiak’s short but powerful run in Seattle.",Kubiak's work in 2025 turned heads across the league.

Peyton Manning 's footwork lesson that shaped Fernando Mendoza's NFL future

Fernando Mendoza knows what it feels like to have everything go right. At first, Indiana went undefeated and won the Heisman Trophy. Plus, he sealed the national title with a fearless leap into the end zone against Miami, the hometown program that once overlooked him. It looked like the perfect ending, the kind built for documentaries and highlight reels.Now the lights feel different. The NFL does not care about college glory, and Mendoza understands that better than most. As the projected No. 1 pick prepares for the April 23, 2026, draft in Pittsburgh, he keeps replaying a moment where praise never came. Instead, a Hall of Fame quarterback stopped him mid-celebration and pointed out something small that could have ruined everything at the next level.Speaking with Andrew Cheroff, Fernando Mendoza shared a lesson from HOF Peyton Manning while he was at the Manning Passing Academy. He was learning to operate under center after years in spread offenses. He fired a strong pass and felt proud of the result. Peyton Manning was watching him and saw a problem.“I was feeling good because I just threw a great ball in front of a Hall of Fame quarterback,” Mendoza said in the online interview. “And he rips into me. He’s like, ‘That’s the wrong footwork!’”That moment stuck. Mendoza said the coach broke down every step and explained how poor mechanics lead to sacks, tipped passes, and interceptions in the NFL.Mendoza said in the same interview, “And I think that the advice, especially with play-action, and how that translates to the NFL, and how that translated to the Indiana offense, always struck with me because it says, ‘Okay, yeah, you’ve made a good throw, but the throw won’t be there if the defenders don’t come up and get attracted to the run.’The star-QB further elaborated how the lesson helped him: “At this point in the NFL, everyone can make the throws,” Mendoza said in the same interview. “It’s about the fine details. That’s what makes the great ones great. It’s the fine details.”That focus on details defined his season at Indiana. Mendoza played efficient football and protected the ball. He entered the College Football Playoff title game with more TD passes than incompletions, a number that helped cement his rise to the top of draft boards. The championship leap made Mendoza famous. The footwork correction may define his future. As draft night approaches, he is trusting that discipline and precision will carry him further than any highlight ever could.","Fernando Mendoza is the projected No. 1 pick in the 2026 NFL draft.

Why the Joe Burrow and Kendall Jenner dating rumors are false



Rumors linking Cincinnati Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow and model Kendall Jenner have taken social media by storm, igniting debates among fans and followers. The frenzy began after a doctored Instagram photo appeared to show Jenner and Burrow dining together, though experts and multiple reports have confirmed it’s entirely fabricated. The story quickly spread across platforms, with speculation fueled by Jenner’s recent Super Bowl ad for Fanatics Sportsbook.In the ad, Jenner pokes fun at her history of dating NBA players and hints at trying football for a change. “Any basketball player who dates me kind of hits a rough patch,” she says. “While the world’s been talking about it, I’ve been betting on it. How else do you think I can afford all this… modeling?” She adds, “But today, it’s time to bet on something new. Football players.” This playful commentary, combined with her orange-and-black Tonight Show outfit, triggered a wave of rumors connecting her to Burrow.The viral photo of Kendall Jenner apparently across a dinner table from Joe Burrow is a complete fabrication, likely generated with AI. Close inspection reveals inconsistencies, including a bizarre dish on Burrow’s plate and timing anomalies suggesting the screenshot was manipulated immediately after posting.TMZ and other sources confirmed that the Instagram Stories allegedly showing the pair never existed.Burrow, 26, keeps his personal life private and has been linked to model Olivia Ponton since mid-2025 after breaking up with longtime girlfriend Olivia Holzmacher. Meanwhile, Jenner, 30, has an extensive history of dating NBA players like Devin Booker, Blake Griffin, and Ben Simmons, which made the football angle a humorous marketing twist rather than fact. Fans misinterpreted her recent public appearances and ad campaign as confirmation, but neither Burrow nor Jenner has commented on the speculation.The episode highlights how quickly AI-generated images and viral posts can blur the lines between reality and fiction. For fans, it’s a reminder that online rumors- even involving high-profile celebrities- require careful scrutiny before being believed.","The viral photo of Kendall Jenner apparently across a dinner table from Joe Burrow is a complete fabrication, likely generated with AI.

First meeting in Tokyo sparks rumors

Support at Browns games makes it official

Both couple supporting each other

Myles Garrett, a star for the Cleveland Browns who is known for dominating quarterbacks in the game. In 2025, though, it wasn't just his sack numbers that made the news. The NFL defensive behemoth disclosed his connection with Chloe Kim, a two-time Olympic gold medalist. Fans instantly grew interested in how the two top athletes initially met.Here’s a closer look at how their romance began and how it unfolded over the past year.In May 2025, Garrett and Kim were first seen together at the Crunchyroll Anime Awards in Tokyo. The two strolled down the orange carpet together, smiling for the cameras and posing for pictures. At the time, neither of them declared that they were dating, but their public presence right away led to rumors that they were.Not long after the Tokyo show, small hints started to show up on social media. In June 2025, Kim posted a funny video of the two of them racing in a training center. Garrett even ran backwards and still won, which showed how lighthearted their relationship was.By August 2025, Kim was spotted at Browns training camp cheering Garrett on. She shared clips of him warming up and interacting with teammates. Still, neither had officially confirmed anything.That changed in November 2025. Before the Browns’ Week 12 game against the Las Vegas Raiders, cameras captured Kim wishing Garrett good luck on the sidelines. She joked about getting makeup on his jersey, and Garrett responded warmly, saying, “Thank you, love,” before leaning in for a kiss. The Browns later shared the video on social media, effectively confirming the relationship.Kim had earlier hinted at having a boyfriend in an interview, mentioning that he was “so good at video games,” though she didn’t name Garrett at the time.Garrett went on to break the NFL single-season sack record in Week 18, and Kim celebrated the milestone on social media. The public support showed that their relationship extends beyond red carpet appearances.Kim, meanwhile, continues training for the 2026 Milano Cortina Winter Olympics, where she hopes to win a third consecutive halfpipe gold medal.Both athletes are at the top of their respective sports. While Garrett keeps most of his private life low-key, his relationship with Kim has become a rare and welcomed glimpse into the man behind the helmet.","Myles Garrett and Chloe Kim were first seen together at the Crunchyroll Anime Awards in May 2025.

Seattle Seahawks sale rumors spark sharp response from Paul Allen Estate



The Seattle Seahawks sale rumors made headlines on Friday, raising urgent questions about the franchise’s ownership future just days before Super Bowl LX. ESPN reported that the Seahawks could be put up for sale after the season, a claim that instantly reverberated across the NFL and the Pacific Northwest. Given the team’s estimated valuation of $7 to $8 billion, the timing and implications could not be bigger.What followed was swift and pointed resistance from the Paul G. Allen Estate. While Paul Allen’s will clearly mandates the eventual sale of his major assets, including the Seahawks, the estate insists the process is not imminent. With championship ambitions still alive and another major sale already underway, the estate says its priorities lie elsewhere for now.The report from ESPN’s Seth Wickersham and Brady Henderson suggested the Seahawks would be placed on the market shortly after Super Bowl LX, scheduled for Feb. 8. The Wall Street Journal later added weight to that claim, citing people familiar with the matter who believe a sale process could begin once the season ends.The Allen Estate pushed back hard. A spokesperson issued a clear statement Friday afternoon: “We don’t comment on rumors or speculation, and the team is not for sale.We’ve already said that will change at some point per Paul’s wishes, but I have no news to share. Our focus right now is winning the Super Bowl and completing the sale of (Allen’s NBA) Portland Trail Blazers in the coming months.”That context matters. The Trail Blazers entered a formal sales process in September 2025 and are expected to fetch up to $4.25 billion. Completing that transaction alone is a massive undertaking. Estate officials have previously acknowledged that selling Allen’s assets could take 10 to 20 years, not months.Still, the questions linger. Allen bought the Seahawks in 1997 for $200 million and oversaw the most successful era in franchise history. The team plays at Lumen Field under a lease that runs through 2031, with extension options stretching decades beyond. Jody Allen, now chair of the franchise, recently lifted the George Halas Trophy on the Lumen Field stage, a powerful reminder of continuity amid uncertainty.Whether a sale begins after Super Bowl LX or years from now, one fact is settled. The Seahawks will eventually change hands. When that moment arrives, it will mark the end of an ownership era that reshaped football in Seattle.","ESPN reported that the Seahawks could be put up for sale after the season. The team's estimated valuation is $7 to $8 billion. The Paul G. Allen Estate insists the process is not imminent.

Shashi Tharoor vs Rajeev Shukla breaks out on India match in Lucknow

Poll Do you believe Ishan Kishan should be recalled to the national team for the T20 World Cup? Yes, definitely No, he needs more time

NEW DELHI: Out-of-favour India wicketkeeper-batter Ishan Kishan delivered a statement performance in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy final on Thursday, smashing a breathtaking 101 off just 49 balls to lead Jharkhand to their maiden title and finally breaking his silence on his prolonged absence from Team India Kishan, captaining Jharkhand, led from the front on a day to remember as his side posted a daunting 262 for 3 against Haryana before sealing a commanding 69-run victory. It marked a fitting end to a sensational tournament for the 27-year-old, who finished as the leading run-scorer with 517 runs from 10 innings at a staggering strike rate of 197.32.Having been sidelined from the national team since 2023 following disciplinary issues under then head coach Rahul Dravid and chief selector Ajit Agarkar , Kishan admitted the phase had been mentally challenging.“When I was not selected in the Indian team, I felt quite bad because I was doing well,” Kishan was quoted as saying by Sportstar. “But I told myself that if I am not selected with this sort of performance, then maybe I have to do more. Maybe I have to make my team win. Maybe we have to do well as a unit.”The left-hander emphasised the importance of handling frustration during setbacks. “It's important that you don't allow the frustration to get to you.This is my message to all the youngsters — frustration is something that will take you one step down. You need to put in a lot of hard work, believe in yourself and focus on what you need to achieve,” he said.Despite his red-hot form, Kishan is unlikely to be recalled for the upcoming T20 World Cup. However, he insisted he is no longer weighed down by expectations. “I know you fancy your chances a lot of times. And when you don't see your name, you just feel bad about it. So, I'm not in that zone anymore. I'm not expecting anything,” he said with a smile. “But my job is to just keep performing.”In the final, Kishan tore into the Haryana bowling attack, hammering 10 sixes and eight fours, and bringing up his second century of the tournament with a stylish one-handed six over extra cover. He shared a decisive 177-run second-wicket stand with Kumar Kushagra, who struck a rapid 81 off 38 balls.Jharkhand bowlers, led by Anukul Roy, then dismantled Haryana's chase, bowling them out for 193 despite a fighting fifty from Yashvardhan Dalal.For Kishan, the title triumph stands tall among his career highlights. “It is definitely the happiest moment because we have never won a domestic tournament under my captaincy,” he said. “Now, I have more trust in myself, more belief in my batting.”",Ishan Kishan captained Jharkhand to their maiden title in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy final on Thursday. The 27-year-old smashed 101 off just 49 balls to lead his side to a 69-run victory. KISHan was sidelined from the national team since 2023 following disciplinary issues under then head coach Rahul Dravid.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126068684,imgsize-14620,width-400,resizemode-4/ishan-kishan.jpg"

Prashant Veer's parents react after their son gets a Rs 14.20 crore IPL deal

NEW DELHI: The fourth T20I between India and South Africa never saw a ball bowled on Wednesday night, but it still triggered a fierce debate after senior Congress leader and noted cricket enthusiast Shashi Tharoor took aim at the deteriorating air quality and questioned the decision to host the match in Lucknow.Persistent fog — officially cited as “excessive fog” — enveloped the Bharat Ratna Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee Ekana Cricket Stadium throughout the evening, making play impossible. The toss, scheduled for 6:30 pm IST, was first delayed to 6:50 pm before a series of inspections were conducted. With visibility showing no improvement, umpires finally abandoned the match around 9:30 pm.As players waited through long delays before retreating to the dressing rooms, frustration mounted both inside and outside the stadium. The issue soon spilled onto social media, where Tharoor delivered a sharp critique of the conditions and the Board of Control for Cricket in India’s ( BCCI ) venue selection.“Cricket fans have been waiting in vain for the #INDVSSAODI to start in Lucknow,” Tharoor posted on X. “But thanks to dense smog, pervasive in most north Indian cities, and an AQI of 411, visibility is too poor to permit a game of cricket. They should’ve scheduled the game in Thiruvananthapuram, where AQI is about 68 right now!”Tharoor’s post struck a chord, amplifying concerns about player welfare and fan experience amid hazardous pollution levels. Air quality in Lucknow remained firmly in the danger zone, with PM2.5 levels reportedly more than five times the World Health Organization’s recommended limits. The severity was visible on the field, with Indian all-rounder Hardik Pandya spotted wearing a surgical mask during warm-ups — an image that quickly went viral.A BCCI statement later confirmed the match was abandoned due to unsafe playing conditions caused by fog. India, the reigning T20 world champions, continue to lead the five-match series 2–1, with the final game scheduled in Ahmedabad on December 19.",The fourth T20I between India and South Africa never saw a ball bowled on Wednesday night.

MUMBAI:

Prashant Veer's parents react after their son gets a Rs 14.20 crore IPL deal

It’s not for nothing that they say an IPL gig is often a life-changing event for most players. Onkar Tarmale is another example of the motto of the tournament: When talent meets opportunity. He overcame years of family hardship to secure an Indian Premier League (IPL) contract after Sunrisers Hyderabad bid Rs 30 lakh for the right-arm pacer at the mini auction held at Abu Dhabi on Tuesday.Tarmale, 23, from Shere, Shahapur taluka, a quiet hamlet around 60 kilometres from Mumbai’s entry point, had been able to bowl only two overs during the Sunrisers Hyderabad trials because of the hamstring injury. Despite this, SRH bowling coach Varun Aaron was impressed by his pace and “may have recommended his name to the franchise”.During the trials, he (Aaron) was impressed with the pace I bowled. He told me, “I see something different in you which can be developed. You have the potential.” But unfortunately, I could bowl only two overs before I pulled up my hamstring. As I couldn’t bowl at length, I never expected that SRH would bid for me, but they eventually did,” reveals Tarmale.The bid prompted a night-long celebration in his village, complete with a procession and firecrackers.“More people turned up to celebrate my success than a marriage function. It is a huge thing for our village. Even people from adjoining villages joined in and wished me luck,” Tarmale says.Tarmale has graduated from the university of hard knocks. His father, Tukaram, a small-time farmer, mortgaged gold jewellery and took loans to support his son’s cricketing dream. “My family has sacrificed a lot for me. This is huge for us financially as well. They got very emotional when I got picked up. My father always wanted to see me play in the IPL, and with God’s grace, I have managed to fulfil his dream,” he adds, recalling that he even invoked divine powers by praying at the nearby Hanuman temple when the auction was under way.Tarmale’s cricketing journey, like many others', began with a tennis ball. The switch to a cricket ball happened a bit late, at the age of 18. and that too came about on the advice of his coach. “My coach Narendra Diwane told me that I have the potential to play leather ball cricket. Previously, I used to run in and just bowl fast. He fine-tuned my action and moulded me into a proper pacer,” he says.Tarmale toiled in the dusty maidans of Mumbai playing in the lower divisions often without any recognition or reward. In 2024, A heart to heart with his dad soon followed as he advised Onkar to look for other avenues like “trying for a police job or something else”.Tarmale though is all praise for his father for not forcing his decisions on him.“My father made me aware of the family's financial condition, but he didn’t force the decision on me. They left it to me. They were more worried about my health as daily travel to Mumbai was taking a toll on my health. Deep down I knew that opportunity was just around the corner. I asked them for some more time to crack it. Thankfully, they were convinced. Everyone who was around me cricket wise, knew that I can make it,"" says the pacer who now plays for Sindh SC and BPCL.He adds: “I trained harder, improved my fitness, and got noticed.”Luck smiled on him in the 2025 T20 Mumbai League, when Thane Eagle Strikers picked him after mentor and former Mumbai and India pacer Dhawal Kulkarni noted his potential. “Dhawal Sir spoke to my father about my potential and told him to let me play. After that, my father was convinced, and he has never told me to stop playing thereafter,” Tarmale says.Although he featured in just two matches before a finger fracture, his pace—around 140 kmph, peaking at 145 kmph—caught the eye of scouts and led to his IPL trial. Under Kulkarni’s guidance, Tarmale has added yorkers, wide yorkers, slower balls and slow bouncers to his growing bag of tricks.Following the auction celebrations, Tarmale slept at 4 am on Wednesday and was back at the Mumbai Cricket Association’s BKC facility for an early training session. He described his IPL selection as “just another pit stop” on a journey he intends to pursue with renewed focus.","Onkar Tarmale, 23, from Shahapur taluka, a quiet hamlet around 60 kilometres from Mumbai’s entry point.

Ravichandran Ashwin has weighed in on the fierce bidding war for Australian all-rounder Cameron Green at the IPL 2026 mini auction, pointing out that Chennai Super Kings missed a major opportunity. Kolkata Knight Riders eventually secured Green for a record Rs 25.20 crore, making him the priciest overseas player in IPL history.Both KKR and CSK were expected to compete heavily for Green, one of the most sought-after names in the auction due to their larger budgets. While both franchises aggressively pursued the young all-rounder, CSK withdrew once the bidding crossed Rs 25 crore.Ashwin felt KKR could have handled their bids differently to put more pressure on CSK. ""If KKR had been slightly patient, like some other franchises, like Punjab, took their time with the bidding. If KKR had also bid like that, then I think CSK would have let go of Cameron Green much more earlier. KKR felt that CSK bid on Green because they had to,"" he said on his YouTube channel.Despite CSK missing out, Ashwin emphasised Green’s value as a player. ""I felt Cameron Green would have been a great addition to CSK, I think they missed a trick, according to me. Whatever said and done, it is not about the price point, Green is a generational talent, and it is a brilliant acquisition for KKR,"" he added.Cameron Green is set to join his third IPL franchise, having previously played for Mumbai Indians and Royal Challengers Bangalore.

NEW DELHI: ""Apne ghar walon ke saamne khelne ka maza kuch aur hi hoga [Playing in front of my family members will be a completely different feeling]"" — India spinner Ravi Bishnoi is relishing the prospect of playing in front of his home crowd next IPL season. Bishnoi, who was part of the Lucknow Super Giants squad last season and was released ahead of the IPL 2026 Auction, was bought for Rs 7.2 crore at the IPL mini-auction in Abu Dhabi on Tuesday.Bishnoi appeared to be firmly on Rajasthan Royals ’ radar from the outset. As soon as auctioneer Mallika Sagar announced his name with a base price of Rs 2 crore, the Royals opened the bidding straightaway. Chennai Super Kings soon entered the fray, intensifying the contest. After CSK took the bid up to Rs 4.2 crore, Rajasthan Royals stayed aggressive in their pursuit of the leg-spinner. The bidding eventually concluded at Rs 7.2 crore, with Rajasthan Royals emerging successful in securing Bishnoi’s services.Bishnoi is all smiles and says it feels like a 'ghar wapsi' for him.""Excited to be back home. Ghar wapsi hai meri. I started as a net bowler from here and life has come a long way. I always dreamt of playing for my home franchise, and now that dream has come true. I am very excited for the new journey with Rajasthan Royals. My family is very happy. I am waiting for home support. I want to give them good memories this season with wickets and wins for my team,"" Bishnoi told TimesofIndia.com in an exclusive interview.The 25-year-old has played for two IPL teams — Lucknow Super Giants and Punjab Kings, and has featured in 77 games, bagging 72 wickets.""Life has come a long way. I have played for two teams so far — Punjab Kings and Lucknow Super Giants. KL Rahul bhai at Punjab Kings supported me a lot and gave me a lot of freedom. I was grateful to play under Rishabh Pant bhai at Lucknow Super Giants. The best part of playing under both — Pant and KL Rahul — was that they always gave me liberty and freedom on the field. I have learnt a lot from KL Rahul. He has an abundance of knowledge,"" he said.""KL Rahul bhai and Rishabh Pant bhai always said, ‘Jo karna hai kar, apni field laga. I trust you.’ The best thing was that they both were keepers, and a lot of guidance and tips came from behind the wickets whenever I was bowling. Pant bhai also emphasised fielding,"" the spinner added.Bishnoi was retained by Lucknow Super Giants ahead of the IPL 2025 mega auction for Rs 11 crore, but after managing just nine wickets in 11 matches at an economy rate of 10.83, he was released by LSG following a four-year stint with the franchise.""The price tag is nothing in front of playing in front of your home crowd. I am thankful to Rajasthan Royals and really excited to play this season for them,"" Bishnoi said.Now, Bishnoi will be sharing the ball with another Ravi — experienced spinner Ravindra Jadeja .""I am really excited for that deadly combo. I am eager to share the ball with him from the other end. He has got a lot of experience. He has played for this team in the past. His experience will matter a lot in IPL 2026,"" he said.""Googly is my main weapon. But with age, I have worked on my variations. Finger movement has helped me a lot. There is a lot of competition, so you need to keep improving. I spend a lot of time in the nets and keep bowling the same delivery until I get the desired results. If you want to play for long, whether for a franchise or India, you need to practise again and again. You need to grind really hard to stay in contention. You need to keep improving day by day and bring something new in terms of bowling and deliveries. You need to develop your game sense. The harder you grind, the better you become,"" Bishnoi said.""All I want is to hear cheers from my home fans. I am really eager to go out in the middle and play in front of my home crowd,"" the spinner signed off.","Ravi Bishnoi was bought by Rajasthan Royals for Rs 7.2 crore at the IPL mini- auction in Abu Dhabi.

LUCKNOW:

Abhishek Sharma's sister is very proud of her brother, and India win

Opening batter and vice-captain Shubman Gill was ruled out of the final T20 International against South Africa after sustaining a toe injury, sources close to the team told TOI. The injury is understood to have occurred during a training session, with the team management “exercising caution” to aid his recovery.According to sources, Gill had an extended batting stint in the nets on the eve of the fourth T20I, during which he was struck on the toe towards the end of the session. He was visibly in pain and struggled to walk thereafter.At this stage, his participation for the final T20I in Ahmedabad is “highly doubtlful”.Gill’s injury could open a window for the team management to assess its bench strength, not just for the Ahmedabad T20 but also with an eye on the five-match T20I series against New Zealand in Jan next year. Also, it could pave the way for players like Yashasvi Jaiswal to get a look-in, while also activating the option of Sanju Samson returning to the opening slot.Gill’s injury comes just when the elegant right-hander seemed to have put a frightening medical scare behind him. While a toe injury might sound innocuous in isolation, for Gill and the Indian management, it is the latest chapter in a worrying saga of physical fragilities that is beginning to cast a long shadow over the team’s preparations for the upcoming T20 World Cup going to be held in India and Sri Lanka from Feb 7 to March 8 next year.The timing of this injury is particularly cruel. Gill had only just returned to the playing XI for the T20I series, featuring in the first three matches after a lay-off.His previous absence was precipitated by a genuinely alarming incident during the first Test against South Africa at Eden Gardens in Kolkata. While attempting a sweep shot, Gill felt a severe discomfort in his neck. He retired hurt immediately.Subsequent medical assessments revealed a disc bulge in his neck that was impinging on a nerve. That injury forced him to miss the second Test in Guwahati and the entire three-match ODI series against the Proteas.Unfortunately, this stop-start narrative has become the defining theme of Gill’s recent career. The past year has seen the prodigious opener spend nearly as much time in the recovery room as he has in the middle.In November 2024, Gill suffered a freak injury during an intra-squad training match at the WACA in Perth. While fielding in the slips, he took a blow that resulted in a hairline fracture on his left thumb, ruling him out of the critical first Test against Australia.Just a month prior, in October 2024, it was his neck that betrayed him again; complaints of stiffness forced him to sit out the first Test against New Zealand in Bengaluru.This recurring pattern — thumb, neck, disc bulge and now a toe — paints a picture of a body struggling to cope with the rigorous demands of all-format international cricket.This inability to stay fit is no longer just a personal heartbreak for Gill, it is evolving into a strategic headache for the Indian team management.A World Cup campaign on home soil demands a settled line-up, and Gill is theoretically a cornerstone of India’s top order. Gill is viewed as the bridge in India’s explosive batting line-up, a player capable of anchoring an innings as well as accelerating at will.However, the concern is that India might head into the mega event with an undercooked top order, or worse, with a key player whose fitness is hanging by a thread.","Shubman Gill ruled out of final T20 International against South Africa with toe injury.

Poll What is the main benefit of introducing NZ20? Boosting player earnings Attracting international players Improving the overall standard of cricket

New Zealand Cricket (NZC) chief executive Scott Weenink resigned on Friday, bringing an end to a turbulent tenure marked by a prolonged and increasingly bitter dispute over the future of T20 cricket in the country. Weenink, a businessman and former Wellington first-class cricketer, stepped down after just over two years in the role, with fundamental differences emerging between him, the players, and New Zealand’s six member associations.At the heart of the disagreement was a proposed franchise-based T20 competition, tentatively named NZ20, which is envisioned as a replacement for the existing domestic Super Smash. The proposed league would seek foreign investment and ownership, potentially involving Indian Premier League ( IPL ) franchises, and aims to attract top overseas players to New Zealand.Players and member associations have strongly backed the NZ20 concept, viewing it as a necessary evolution for the game in the country. New Zealand remains the only ICC full-member nation without a dedicated franchise T20 league, and stakeholders believe the new competition would strengthen the domestic structure, boost player earnings, and raise the overall standard of cricket.Weenink, however, was believed to favour an alternative model, including the possibility of a New Zealand-based franchise entering Australia’s Big Bash League.This difference in strategic vision ultimately proved irreconcilable.“After careful consideration, it has become clear that I hold a different view from several member associations… on the future priorities for NZC,” Weenink said in a statement. “Given these differences, I believe it is in the best interests of the organisation that new leadership takes NZC forward from here.”Support for NZ20 from the playing group has been vocal. Test captain Tom Latham publicly endorsed the proposal last week, calling it “a great initiative” and highlighting the benefits of hosting international players to lift standards across the game. White-ball captain Mitchell Santner has also backed the new competition.Weenink will officially conclude his tenure as NZC chief executive on January 30, with the debate over NZ20 now expected to accelerate under new leadership.","New Zealand Cricket chief executive Scott Weenink resigns after two years in the role.

India’s first World Cup-winning captain Kapil Dev has weighed in on the debate surrounding Gautam Gambhir ’s working style, saying the role of a head coach in modern-day cricket is more about player management than hands-on coaching.Gambhir has faced growing criticism after India’s 0-2 Test series loss to South Africa, with questions raised over frequent player rotation and the use of part-time options. Speaking at the Indian Chamber of Commerce’s ICC Centenary Session on Thursday, Kapil suggested the very idea of a “coach” is often misunderstood in today’s game.“Today the word ‘coach’ is used very loosely. Gautam Gambhir cannot really be a coach. He can be a manager of the team,” Kapil said. “When I talk about a coach, I think of the people who taught me in school and college. Those were my coaches.”Kapil explained that at the international level, specialist players do not need technical instruction from a head coach. “How can you be a coach when someone is already a leg-spinner or a wicketkeeper? How can Gautam coach a leg-spinner or a wicketkeeper?” he asked.Instead, Kapil stressed that the key responsibility lies in managing personalities and creating the right environment.“Management is more important. As a manager, you have to encourage players and make them believe they can do it. Young players look up to you,” he said.According to Kapil, a coach or captain’s biggest role is to provide comfort and reassurance. “The job is to give confidence to the team and always tell them, ‘you can do better’. That’s how I see it,” he added.Reflecting on his own leadership style, Kapil said he made a conscious effort to support players struggling for form. “If someone scores a hundred, I don’t need to have dinner with him,” he said. “I would rather spend time with those who are not performing.”Kapil emphasised that building confidence in underperforming players is crucial to team success. “You need to give them belief. As a captain, your role is not just about your own performance, but about keeping the team together,” he said.","Gautam Gambhir has faced growing criticism after India’s 0-2 Test series loss to South Africa, with questions raised over frequent player rotation and the use of part-time options.

IPL Auction Analysis: Why franchise broke the bank for uncapped Indians

Punjab Kings co-owner Ness Wadia has publicly criticised Australia wicketkeeper-batter Josh Inglis , calling his conduct “unprofessional” over how and when the franchise was informed about his availability for IPL 2026.Wadia said PBKS had every intention of retaining Inglis but were left blindsided when the player communicated his limited availability just minutes before the retention deadline. According to Wadia, the problem was never Inglis’ wedding in early April, but the timing of the disclosure.Speaking to Sportstar, Wadia said, “We didn't really let go of Josh. Josh unfortunately only told us at the last minute, which was not very fair, given that he had been with us for a while. Everyone knew when the retention was coming, and we were informed by him 45 minutes before the deadline that he was getting married and needed time to relax and recuperate. He said he was going to be available only for a couple of weeks.”Wadia made it clear that the franchise felt short-changed after planning their retention strategy around Inglis. “We told him he should have informed us earlier. I don't think it was very professional of him.If you know there is a deadline, you cannot call someone 45 minutes before and say you are not coming, especially when you know you are being retained,” he said.Despite the criticism, Wadia struck a conciliatory note at the end, wishing the player well. “I wish him all the best. He is a good player and I am sure he will do well for Australia. Whether he plays in the IPL or not, I wish him well as a fellow human being. But the manner in which he behaved was not very professional,” he added.Inglis’ limited availability had already become a talking point ahead of the IPL 2026 mini-auction. Although he initially went unsold, he later sparked a bidding war and was eventually signed by Lucknow Super Giants for INR 8.6 crore. LSG are understood to have invested in him with an eye on future seasons rather than expecting a major contribution in his short stint this year.From Inglis’ side, the situation has been addressed plainly. The batter has acknowledged that he will not be available for the full IPL 2026 season due to his wedding in early April, with the tournament scheduled to run from March 26 to May 31.",Punjab Kings co-owner Ness Wadia has publicly criticised Australia wicketkeeper- batter Josh Inglis.

From Kolkata Chaos to Delhi Celebration: Lionel Messi’s G.O.A.T India Tour At A Glance

NEW DELHI: Former Indian cricket captain Sunil Gavaskar has sparked debate over the Lionel Messi controversy in Kolkata, arguing that criticism of event organisers and VIP culture misses the mark; Messi himself bears primary responsibility for not upholding his obligations.In a column for Sportsstar, Gavaskar shifts scrutiny from the ongoing arrangements to Messi's performance during his ""G.O.A.T. India Tour 2025"" at Salt Lake Stadium.He notes how the narrative swiftly painted India as at fault for Messi's unexpectedly brief stint. Gavaskar highlights the gap between fan anticipation and reality.""Even the recent episode at the Salt Lake stadium in Kolkata, where the Argentinian footballer, Lionel Messi, made a far shorter appearance than promised, was blamed on everyone except the person who failed to honour his commitment,"" he wrote.While admitting the exact contract details between Messi's camp and organisers remain private, Gavaskar urges restraint in condemning locals without facts.""What his agreement was is not public knowledge, but if he was meant to be at the stadium for an hour, then by leaving well before that time and disappointing fans who had paid good money, the real culprit was he and his entourage,"" Gavaskar asserted.Gavaskar dismisses security concerns as an easy excuse for Messi's quick departure, despite the swarm of politicians and VIPs around him.""Yes, he was surrounded by politicians and so-called VIPs, but there was no security threat to him or his entourage,"" he further added.""Was he supposed to simply walk around the stadium, or do something tangible like take a penalty kick? If it were the latter, those around him would automatically have had to move, and the crowd would have seen their hero do what they had come to watch.""Comparing it to Messi's other seamless India events, Gavaskar attributes their success to full delivery on promises.“So, before blaming fellow Indians in Kolkata, it might be worth checking whether commitments on both sides were honoured,” the former batter concluded.",Former Indian cricket captain Sunil Gavaskar has sparked debate over the Lionel Messi controversy in Kolkata.

IPL Auction Analysis: Why franchise broke the bank for uncapped Indians

Out-of-favour India wicketkeeper-batter Ishan Kishan delivered a powerful reminder of his T20 credentials, hammering a stunning century to lead Jharkhand to their first-ever Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy title with a dominant 69-run win over Haryana on Thursday.Kishan produced a breathtaking display of power-hitting, smashing 101 off just 49 balls, including 10 towering sixes and eight fours. His onslaught propelled Jharkhand to a massive 262 for 3, a total that proved far beyond Haryana’s reach.After the batters set the tone, Jharkhand’s bowlers ensured there was no late twist. Medium-pacer Anukul Roy struck twice in his very first over, setting the tone for a disciplined bowling effort. Haryana were eventually bowled out for 193, despite a fighting half-century from wicketkeeper-batter Yashvardhan Dalal, who top-scored with 53.Roy also made a telling contribution with the bat, blasting 40 off just 20 deliveries, adding valuable late momentum to Jharkhand’s innings.With this victory, Jharkhand became the 12th state to lift India’s premier domestic T20 title, marking a historic moment for the team.Asked to bat first, captain Kishan anchored the innings with authority, stitching together a match-defining 177-run partnership for the second wicket with Kumar Kushagra. While Kishan dominated the bowling, Kushagra played the perfect supporting role, striking a rapid 81 off 38 balls to keep Haryana under constant pressure.The hundred was Kishan’s second of the tournament. The 27-year-old enjoyed a remarkable campaign, finishing as the leading run-scorer with 517 runs from 10 innings at an explosive strike rate of 197.32.His purple patch has come at a crucial time, with national selectors set to meet soon to finalise India’s T20I squad for the upcoming series against New Zealand and the T20 World Cup.Kishan brought up his century in style, launching a one-handed six over extra cover, before being clean bowled by Sumit Kumar in the 15th over. Kushagra followed him back to the pavilion in the very next over.Late flourishes from Anukul and Robin Minz, who chipped in with 31 off 14 balls, ensured Jharkhand finished strongly.Haryana’s chase never truly gathered momentum. They suffered a nightmare start, losing captain Ankit Kumar and Ashish Siwach for ducks to slump to 2 for 1. Dalal attempted to revive hopes, adding 34 runs with opener Arsh Ranga and later forging a 67-run stand with Nishant Sindhu, who scored 31.However, Anukul decisively swung the match Jharkhand’s way by dismissing both set batters in the same over, effectively ending Haryana’s resistance.Brief scores: Jharkhand 262/3 in 20 overs (Ishan Kishan 101, Kumar Kushagra 89; Sumit Kumar 1/41) beat Haryana 193 all out in 18.3 overs (Yashvardhan Dalal 53, Samant Jakhar 38; Sushant Mishra 3/21) by 69 runs.","Ishan Kishan smashes 101 off just 49 balls, including 10 towering sixes and eight fours.

Former India off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin has named his four favourites for the upcoming IPL season, notably leaving out his former franchise Chennai Super Kings. His selections come shortly after the IPL mini-auction held at the Etihad Arena in Abu Dhabi. Ashwin placed five-time champions Mumbai Indians at the top of his list. The Hardik Pandya-led side held on to their core during last month’s retention window and added further depth through trades, bringing in Sherfane Rutherford from Gujarat Titans, Mayank Markande from Kolkata Knight Riders, and Shardul Thakur from Lucknow Super Giants.Mumbai Indians were also active at the auction, picking up Quinton de Kock for Rs 1 crore, along with Danish Malewar, Mohammed Izhar, Atharva Ankolekar, and Mayank Rawat, each for Rs 30 lakh.Defending champions Royal Challengers Bengaluru were Ashwin’s second choice. RCB retained their key players before the auction and then added eight new names to their squad. Among their notable buys were Venkatesh Iyer for Rs 4 crore and Jacob Duffy for Rs 2 crore. RCB had claimed their maiden IPL title earlier this year.Ashwin rounded off his top four by backing Punjab Kings and Rajasthan Royals as contenders for the remaining playoff spots. Except for Rajasthan Royals, all the teams he mentioned had reached the playoffs last season.Ashwin shared his picks during an interaction on Mumbai Indians’ official Instagram handle.Rajasthan Royals, meanwhile, secured Ravi Bishnoi for Rs 7.20 crore at the auction. Prior to the auction, they had already strengthened their squad through trades, bringing in Ravindra Jadeja , Sam Curran, and Donovan Ferreira.Ashwin reserved special praise for Mumbai Indians’ acquisition of Quinton de Kock, suggesting the franchise moved decisively while others hesitated. He felt MI were attempting to recreate the balance of their IPL 2020 title-winning side, even without Ishan Kishan.“I think the Quinton de Kock buy was a good move. I think the other franchises were sleeping on their haunches, and MI snooped it up. I think MI are not sure about the Rickelton opening combination. I think MI are trying to replicate their IPL 2020 championship squad, only Ishan Kishan is not there,” Ashwin said on his YouTube channel.Despite having a relatively small purse of Rs 2.75 crore, Ashwin felt Mumbai Indians made the most of their resources and significantly strengthened an already strong unit.“MI had 2.75 crore, but it was as if they had 27 crore, because they bought so many players. MI already had a winning squad before they went into the IPL auction, and now, after the auction, they look even stronger,” he added.","Ravichandran Ashwin picks Mumbai Indians, Royal Challengers Bengaluru, Punjab Kings and Rajasthan Royals as his favourites for the upcoming IPL season.

India Senior’s GS Shiva Shankara’s grand effort with the bat went in vain as India A finally pulled one back in the three-match Physical Disability T20 series, which came to an end at the historic Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai on Thursday.In the third and final match of the series, India A, after opting to bat, posted 164 for eight in their 20 overs. There were equal contributions from Akash Sanap (32), Prasad Chavan (31), and Jitendra VN (25). For India Senior, the best bowlers were Sunny Goyal (3-17) and Imran Khan (2-49).Prof. Dr. Unmesh Khanvilkar, Secretary, Mumbai Cricket Association (MCA), said: “This historic series—the first initiative of its kind in the country, undertaken under the visionary leadership of our President Mr. Ajinkya Naik—represents far more than a set of competitive matches. It reflects our collective belief in inclusivity, equality, dignity, and opportunity for every sportsperson, irrespective of physical or intellectual ability. Sport has always been a powerful platform for empowerment. Providing these talented athletes with a structured and competitive stage validates their skill, passion, and commitment.Our objective goes beyond participation; it is to prepare these cricketers for higher levels of competition, from regional platforms to national and international arenas, enabling them to pursue their cricketing careers with pride and confidence. We are deeply inspired by the continued efforts of the Government of India and the Government of Maharashtra in promoting sports inclusivity and talent development. Such initiatives reinforce the national spirit that encourages and provides the necessary support systems to transform those dreams into reality—in para-sports. Events like this T20 series not only enhance competitive cricket but also highlight the inclusive vision, where talent truly meets opportunity without barriers. I would like to place on record my sincere appreciation to Mr. Ravikant Chauhan, Secretary of DCCI, and his entire committee for their initiative, dedication, and collaboration. This partnership strengthens our shared goal of advancing disability cricket and creating more meaningful opportunities in the future. At the Mumbai Cricket Association, we remain firmly committed to backing every cricketer with talent, heart, and determination—because ability and excellence know no boundaries. I wish all the participants the very best and look forward to witnessing inspiring and memorable cricket.”In their response, India Senior kept losing wickets at regular intervals. The side was struggling at 38 for five and further slipped to 81 for eight. The only player to stand out was GS Shiva Shankara, who made a valiant 67 off 43 balls, including four boundaries and five sixes. India Senior was bowled out for 136 in 19.3 overs. For India A, the best bowlers were Nonsola Adil (3-40), G Prashant (2-15), and Mohammed Sadiq (2-3).Ravi Chauhan, Secretary General, DCCI, said: “Playing at the iconic Wankhede Stadium was a dream come true for our Physical Disability Cricketers. This opportunity proves that physical disability cricketers are now receiving the same respect, recognition, and platform as mainstream players. Heartfelt gratitude to ICC Chairman Sh. Jay Shah for his visionary efforts in bringing divyang cricket into the mainstream and securing BCCI support for a game that has been growing for over 40 years. A special thank you to the Mumbai Cricket Association (MCA) for taking this historic step, and to MCA President Mr. Ajinkya Naik for fulfilling the dream of our divyang cricketers by giving them the opportunity to play at Wankhede and for leading from the front in support of differently-abled cricket. A milestone moment for divyang cricket and an inspiration for generations to come.”Players of the match in each of the three games were awarded Rs 11,000 each, and the player of the series, India Senior’s Wasim Iqbal, received Rs 21,000 from the Mumbai Cricket Association (MCA).Player of the match in the final game, Shiva Shankara, was thrilled to have had the opportunity to play in the series. “It has been a terrific experience to play at the iconic Wankhede Stadium,” said Shiva Shankara.Hailing from Bengaluru, Shiva Shankara plays with only his left hand and enjoys the challenge of competing at this level. “It is difficult, but I train quite regularly in the gym at least three to four times a week. I play regularly with able-bodied cricketers in corporate tournaments and have scored heavily. I can only thank Mr. Ravi Kant Chauhan and his team for all their efforts.”India A 164-8 in 20 overs (Akash Sanap 32, Prasad Chavan 31, Jitendra VN 25; Sunny Goyal 3-17, Imran Khan 2-49) lost to India Senior 136 in 19.3 overs (Shiva Shankara 67, Sunny Goyal 21; Nonsola Adil 3-40, Mohammed Sadiq 2-3, G Prashant 2-15) — by 28 runs.","India Senior’s GS Shiva Shankara made 67 off 43 balls, including four boundaries and five sixes.

But there is no guarantee,” a club representative told news agency PTI.The request followed a virtual meeting on Thursday between AIFF officials, ISL club representatives and the sports ministry. The clubs were asked to submit their proposal by Friday evening.The AIFF also informed the clubs that, under its new constitution, any amendment to its provisions could be done only after the General Body of the national federation was formed according to the new constitution itself.“It could be hotchpotch also since the new National Sports Grievance Act is likely to be implemented shortly. So there can be changes under the Act also,” a source in the know of things said.Meanwhile, the Indian Women’s League, starting December 20, will be held without a sponsor after the AIFF and Capri Sports – the lone bidder in the national federation’s tender to monetise the commercial rights of the first and second divisions of the IWL for five years – could not reach an agreement.The clubs had earlier suggested forming a consortium to resolve the ongoing commercial impasse in Indian football.The AIFF said this would require deliberations and approval by its Executive Committee and the AGM.The Marketing Rights Agreement between the AIFF and Football Sports Development Limited, which organised the ISL for 12 seasons since its inception in 2014, ended on December 8, leaving the top-tier league without a commercial framework.","Indian Super League (ISL) clubs were on Thursday asked to submit a proposal for forming a consortium to run the 2025-26 season of the league, which is yet to begin.

NEW DELHI: Today is December 18. For some, it is just another day on the way to Christmas and the New Year. For football fans, however, it is a date that will forever live in the sport’s collective memory as the night Lionel Messi completed the game.Under the bright lights of Lusail Stadium in Qatar three years back, Argentina defeated France in a final that felt less like a match and more like destiny unfolding in real time.For Messi, it was not just a World Cup title; it was the closing chapter of a lifelong pursuit that had defined his career, his country, and an entire generation of football fans.For nearly two decades, Messi’s greatness had been measured against an absence.He had won everything at club level, from Champions League to multiple Ballon d’Ors, league titles and goal-scoring records that once seemed untouchable.And yet, the World Cup remained the one prize that eluded him, the yardstick by which football immortality is often judged.In Argentina, where Diego Maradona ’s shadow still loomed large, that absence was felt more sharply than anywhere else.Qatar 2022 began with doubt rather than certainty. Argentina’s shocking opening defeat to Saudi Arabia threatened to derail the campaign before it truly began.For a brief moment, old fears resurfaced: was this another World Cup destined to end in heartbreak for Messi?But what followed was a team and a captain refusing to surrender to narrative or pressure.Messi led with calm authority. He scored, he created, he inspired, and, perhaps most importantly, he believed.From the group stages to the knockout rounds, Argentina grew stronger with each game, feeding off Messi’s composure and clarity. Against Australia, the Netherlands, and Croatia, he was not just a playmaker but the emotional compass of the side, guiding younger teammates through moments of chaos and tension.Then came the final: Argentina versus France, Messi versus Kylian Mbappé, experience versus explosive youth. It was billed as a passing-of-the-torch moment, but Messi was not ready to hand anything over.He scored from the penalty spot to give Argentina the lead and later added a second, arriving in the box with perfect timing to finish off a flowing move. At 2–0, it seemed as though the dream was finally within reach.Football, however, rarely allows fairy tales to unfold without resistance. In a breathtaking twist, Mbappé struck twice in the space of minutes to drag France back into the contest.Extra time followed, and Messi once again stepped up, poking the ball home to make it 3–2. Still, France refused to yield. Mbappé completed his hat-trick from the penalty spot, forcing a shootout that felt almost unbearable in its tension.As penalties loomed, the weight of history hung heavy. Argentina had been here before. It was close, but not close enough. This time, though, the script was different.Emiliano Martínez produced heroics in goal, Argentine penalties were struck with conviction, and when Gonzalo Montiel converted the decisive kick, Messi dropped to his knees, overcome with emotion.Tears flowed freely.Teammates swarmed him. In that moment, the burden he had carried for so long seemed to lift. The image of Messi, draped in the black bisht as he raised the World Cup trophy, became instantly iconic.For Argentina, the victory healed old wounds. It united generations that had debated Messi’s place in the pantheon and finally allowed him to be celebrated without caveats.For Messi himself, it was redemption, validation, and closure all at once.He had not just won a World Cup; he had done so as the undisputed leader of the team, delivering when it mattered most.Two years on, the significance of that night has only grown.December 18 is no longer just a date on the football calendar. It is the day Lionel Messi stepped beyond comparison, beyond debate, and into footballing eternity; World Cup in hand, legacy complete.","Lionel Messi won the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022 trophy on December 18, 2013. Argentina defeated France in a final that felt less like a match and more like destiny unfolding in real time. For Messi, it was not just a World Cup title; it was the closing chapter of a lifelong pursuit.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126060079,imgsize-238744,width-400,resizemode-4/argentina-v-france-final-fifa-world-cup-qatar-2022.jpg"

Congress member Jose K Mani raised India's football future in the Rajya Sabha on Thursday, comparing India's struggles with tiny Curacao's World Cup qualification while questioning Sports Minister Mansukh Mandaviya about plans to develop the sport in India, which is currently facing significant challenges including the suspension of domestic leagues.Mani, representing Kerala, highlighted how Curacao, with just 158,000 people and an area under 450km, qualified for next year's FIFA World Cup through CONCACAF, while India, despite its billion-plus population, continues to struggle.""Qualifying for FIFA world cup is based on the criteria laid down by FIFA, international governing body for football sport discipline,"" Mandaviya responded to Mani's queries.""Responsibility for development of a specific sports including taking steps for participation in World Cup/World Championships is that of concerned National Sports Federation (NSF). All India Football Federation (AIFF) has been recognised by the ministry as the NSF for the promotion and development of the football sport discipline in the country. AIFF has informed that it has a long term plan to help India qualify for FIFA World Cup, with a focus on both the men's and women's national team,"" he added.The AIFF, currently led by Kalyan Chaubey, faces a major crisis as it struggles to secure a commercial partner for domestic leagues, which have been suspended. This situation has led to Supreme Court intervention following criticism of the federation's management.Mandaviya outlined AIFF's youth development initiatives, noting the establishment of FIFA-AIFF academies in Bhubaneswar and Hyderabad for under-13 boys and under-14 girls.""In addition, through the Khelo India Asmita League, the AIFF organised Girls' football competitions, conducting 87 leagues & 68 leagues, across the country, during 2023-24 and 2024-25 season, respectively,"" Mandaviya said.When questioned about the government's Khelo India Scheme progress, Mandaviya provided specific numbers demonstrating its reach.""A total of 28214 athletes have been trained at Khelo India Centres across the country as of April 2024 under Khelo India scheme. A total of 991 Khelo India Centres are operational across the country,"" he stated.The discussion highlighted the stark contrast between India's football performance and smaller nations like Curacao, while also showcasing the government's efforts to develop sports infrastructure through various initiatives.","Congress member Jose K Mani raised India's football future in the Rajya Sabha on Thursday.

Mohun Bagan Super Giant have been slapped with a one-season continental ban and a penalty of over Rs 90 lakh in the light of the team’s decision to withdraw from the AFC Champions League Two.The Asian Football Confederation’s (AFC) Disciplinary and Ethics Committee is understood to have taken this decision on Wednesday, following the ISL champions’ refusal to travel to Iran for their scheduled group-stage match against Sepahan SC in September.Mohun Bagan will be disqualified from participating in the next AFC club competition if they make themselves eligible for it, during the period of next two AFC club competition seasons “up to and including” the 2027/28 season.The city club has also been ordered to pay a fine of $50000 to the AFC as well as a compensation of $50729 “in respect of the damages and losses claimed by the AFC and Foolad Mobarakeh Sepahan FC (IRN).” In all, the penalty is about Rs 91 lakh.",Mohun Bagan Super Giant have been slapped with a one-season continental ban and a penalty of over Rs 90 lakh.

Indian football faces administrative paralysis

Amid unprecedented uncertainty in Indian football, the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) on Wednesday handed a triple blow to Mohun Bagan Super Giant, imposing a continental ban and fines totaling USD 100,729 (approximately INR 91 lakh) after the club withdrew from the 2025-26 AFC Champions League Two.The AFC Disciplinary and Ethics Committee ruled that the reigning Indian Super League champions wrongfully withdrew from the competition following their refusal to travel to Iran for a group-stage match against Sepahan SC. Mohun Bagan was handed a one-season ban from AFC competitions.In Decision VVC 20251217DC21, the committee found the Kolkata-based club guilty of breaching Article 5 (Withdrawal from the Competition) of the ACL Two Competition Regulations after failing to fulfil its fixture once the group stage had begun.As part of the sanctions, the Mariners were ""fined USD 50,000,"" ordered to pay ""USD 50,729 as compensation for damages and losses"" claimed by the AFC and Sepahan SC, and ""disqualified from participating in the next AFC club competition for which they would otherwise qualify, with the ban remaining effective up to and including the 2027–28 season.""The committee also ruled that Mohun Bagan would forfeit all subsidies linked to their participation in the 2025-26 ACL Two season, including participation fees, performance bonuses, and travel subsidies.Any amount already paid must be repaid within 30 days.""The compensation shall be paid to the AFC within thirty (30) days of the date that this Decision is communicated,"" the order stated.Terming the decision ""biased,"" a Mohun Bagan official told PTI that the matter is pending at the Lausanne-based Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), and they are ""hoping for a resolution.""""It's a biased decision against our club; our matter is pending at CAS and we're hopeful of a resolution. However, the club may pay up the fines,"" he added.The ruling comes after Mohun Bagan cited player safety concerns, as six foreign players declined the trip to Iran following advisories from their governments. The club had requested a venue change and later approached CAS, but the AFC deemed it a withdrawal, triggering strict disciplinary action. The case mirrors the previous season, when Mohun Bagan similarly did not travel to Iran to face Tractor SC but had escaped sanction.In Decision VVC 20251217DC08, the AFC Disciplinary and Ethics Committee fined the All India Football Federation (AIFF) USD 1,000 for delaying the restart of the second half during India’s AFC Asian Cup 2027 final-round qualifier against Bangladesh on November 18, 2025.The committee found that AIFF representatives caused a delay of one minute and 43 seconds in commencing the second half, breaching Article 2 (Official Countdown) of the AFC Competitions Operations Manual. The AIFF was ordered to settle the fine within 30 days, under Article 11.3 of the AFC Disciplinary and Ethics Code.In another ruling (VVC 20251217DC19), the AFC fined FC Goa USD 5,000 for failing to ensure stadium safety during their ACL Two group-stage match against Saudi Arabia’s Al Nassr on October 22.The committee found the club violated Article 64 (Organization of Matches) of the AFC Disciplinary and Ethics Code after a spectator invaded the area surrounding the field of play. The ruling noted that FC Goa failed to fully comply with safety regulations and did not take all precautions required to maintain law and order. The fine must be paid within 30 days of communication.The AFC’s disciplinary actions come at a time when Indian football is grappling with deep structural and administrative uncertainty. The domestic season remains in limbo, with no confirmation on the ISL, I-League, or I-League 2 following the expiry of the 15-year agreement between Football Sports Development Limited (FSDL) and the AIFF on December 8.The ISL usually starts in September, while the I-League was scheduled to begin on October 19. With the impasse continuing, the Union Sports Ministry, led by Minister of Youth Affairs and Sports Dr Mansukh Mandaviya, has stepped in to hold meetings with all stakeholders to prevent a complete collapse of the domestic calendar.A proposed resolution is expected within the next week, as officials race against time amid fears that India could go without a men’s domestic league season for the first time since 1996—a scenario that would further damage the country’s standing in Asian football.","Mohun Bagan handed a continental ban and fines totaling USD 100,729 (approximately INR 91 lakh) The Kolkata-based club withdrew from the 2025-26 AFC Champions League Two.

(Image: AP/Jon Super)

Manchester United and Bournemouth played out a thrilling 4-4 draw at Old Trafford, with United squandering the lead three times and missing the chance to move up to fifth in the Premier League. Despite United's strong attacking display under Ruben Amorim's management, their defensive vulnerabilities were exposed as Bournemouth repeatedly fought back to secure a point.Amad Diallo opened the scoring for United in the 13th minute, nodding into an empty net after Petrovic failed to properly handle Cunha's header. The hosts displayed their best attacking form of the season but struggled defensively without injured defenders Harry Maguire and Matthijs de Ligt.Antoine Semenyo equalized for Bournemouth against the run of play in the 40th minute, taking advantage of Luke Shaw's weakness to score his first goal since October 3. United regained the lead before halftime through Casemiro's header from a Fernandes corner, aided by a goalkeeping error from Petrovic.The second half saw Bournemouth score twice in seven minutes through Evanilson and Marcus Tavernier. Evanilson struck just 37 seconds after the restart, while Tavernier converted a free-kick from the edge of the area.United maintained their record of not losing a home league game when leading at half-time since May 1984, as Bruno Fernandes scored from a brilliant free-kick and Matheus Cunha capitalized on Adam Smith's defensive error to make it 4-3.Eli Junior Kroupi leveled the score for Bournemouth with six minutes remaining. The visitors nearly claimed victory in stoppage time, but United goalkeeper Senne Lammens denied David Brooks twice.""It was a fun game for everyone at home,"" said Amorim. ""When you win away you should win at home. The performance today was different from the last two at home. The result is the same, it is frustrating but the performance is different.""""It's very difficult to explain because so much happened,"" said Bournemouth manager Andoni Iraola. ""I suppose it was entertaining for everyone. Two teams that attacked much better than we defended.""The result extends Bournemouth's winless run to seven games but moves them up to 13th place. United climb to sixth place, ahead of Liverpool on goal difference.This draw continues United's recent struggles at home, following their failure to defeat 10-man Everton and West Ham in previous matches.The match highlighted United's improving attack under Amorim's leadership, with their expensive forward line showing promising signs despite defensive shortcomings.Mbeumo missed a clear opportunity from close range during the second half, while Petrovic made an uncertain save from Cunha's powerful shot as both teams continued to create chances throughout the match.",Manchester United and Bournemouth played out a thrilling 4-4 draw at Old Trafford.

Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce are all set to tie the knot next year but the couple seem to be going through a rough patch.The Kansas City Chiefs’ tight end, Travis Kelce, has been brutally trolled after the team recorded an average season and is now out of the playoffs race.

Rome Odunze and Luther Burden ruled out: Injury details

Rome Odunze (foot) – The second-year receiver has missed practice all week and was unable to return in prior games after aggravating his foot. Odunze’s absence removes one of the Bears’ reliable targets, especially in intermediate routes and third-down situations.

Odunze’s absence removes one of the Bears’ reliable targets, especially in intermediate routes and third-down situations. Luther Burden III (ankle) – Burden also missed practice all week and will not suit up. The former top draft pick has shown flashes of big-play ability, and his absence further limits the Bears’ offensive options.







Other Bears players to watch ahead of the Packers game

D’Andre Swift (groin) – Limited in practice this week; status for the game is uncertain. Swift’s ability to contribute in the passing game could help offset some of the WR losses.







– Limited in practice this week; status for the game is uncertain. Swift’s ability to contribute in the passing game could help offset some of the WR losses. Cole Kmet (tight end) – Participated in a limited capacity at practice; could be a safety valve if WRs are thin.







– Participated in a limited capacity at practice; could be a safety valve if WRs are thin. Tremaine Edmunds (linebacker) – Listed as limited; his presence impacts defensive adjustments more than offense, but worth monitoring.







The Chicago Bears are heading into a crucial NFC North clash against the Green Bay Packers this Sunday without two key wide receivers. Both Rome Odunze and Luther Burden III are officially ruled out, according to the latest injury report, leaving the Bears’ passing attack in a thinner-than-usual state. With Odunze sidelined due to a lingering foot injury and Burden out with an ankle problem, the Bears will have to shuffle their receiving corps against a tough Packers defense.Both players being out is a significant blow to a Bears passing game that already ranks middle of the pack in yards per game this season.The Bears aren’t completely decimated, but depth concerns remain.The Bears will likely rely on backups and young receivers to step up in a matchup that demands precision.With Odunze and Burden out, the Bears’ offensive game plan may skew toward the run game and short passes, relying on tight ends and slot receivers to move the chains. Green Bay’s defense is strong against outside receivers, so the Bears’ remaining pass catchers will have to be ready for more snaps and targets than usual. Coach Matt Eberflus may have to get creative with formations and motion to keep the Packers’ secondary guessing.Sunday’s game against the Packers is critical for the Bears’ playoff hopes and NFC North standings. How they adapt to a thinned-out receiving corps could define the outcome. Fans will be watching to see which backups rise to the occasion and whether Swift and Kmet can help fill the gaps left by Odunze and Burden.The Bears’ resilience and coaching adjustments will be under the microscope as they face a division rival with playoff implications, all while trying to stay competitive without two key weapons on offense.Also read - Rams WR Puka Nacua apologizes after controversial livestream gesture and backlash",Rome Odunze and Luther Burden III are officially ruled out for Sunday's game against the Green Bay Packers.

Tyreek Hill’s net worth and NFL earnings

Keeta Vaccaro’s net worth and business ventures

Comparing their financial positions

Alos Read

Tyreek Hill and Keeta Vaccaro have often found themselves in the spotlight as one of the NFL’s most high-profile couples, and now, their individual finances are drawing fresh attention. While Hill’s wealth has been built almost entirely through football, Vaccaro has carved out her own identity as an entrepreneur and investor, making the comparison an intriguing one.Tyreek Hill is among the highest-paid wide receivers in the NFL. As of 2025, the Miami Dolphins star is estimated to have a net worth of around $60 million, according to multiple financial tracking platforms. A significant chunk of that comes from his lucrative contract with Miami, which he signed in 2022 after being traded from the Kansas City Chiefs.Hill reportedly earns close to $30 million per year, factoring in base salary, bonuses, and incentives. Beyond football, endorsements and sponsorships have further boosted his income, with Hill leveraging his on-field success and public profile into commercial deals. However, recent personal developments, including a highly publicised divorce settlement, have added new financial obligations. While these payments are substantial, they are not expected to drastically alter Hill’s overall financial standing given his annual earnings.Keeta Vaccaro’s wealth tells a very different story. Unlike Hill, her income does not depend on professional sports contracts. Vaccaro is estimated to have a net worth in the range of $7–8 million, built largely through entrepreneurship and smart business positioning.A University of Miami graduate with a background in entrepreneurship and marketing, Vaccaro launched a fitness brand, Own Flow, before stepping into the tech and investment space. She later co-founded Investaccess, a platform designed to connect startups with investors, which has attracted attention in business circles. In addition, her presence in fashion, wellness, and lifestyle branding has helped her grow a strong personal brand, independent of her ties to the NFL.From a purely numerical standpoint, Tyreek Hill’s net worth dwarfs Vaccaro’s. His earnings reflect elite NFL status and years of top-tier contracts, while Vaccaro’s wealth is more modest by comparison. That said, the nature of their finances differs sharply.Hill’s income is performance-driven and tied to the physical demands of professional football, while Vaccaro’s ventures offer longer-term scalability beyond sports. Her wealth is also more diversified across business, technology, and branding, rather than relying on a single revenue stream.While Tyreek Hill clearly comes out on top in raw numbers, His ex-wife Keeta Vaccaro’s growing portfolio underscores how financial independence beyond sports is becoming an increasingly powerful narrative in the world of NFL WAGs and entrepreneurs alike.","Tyreek Hill reportedly earns close to $30 million per year, factoring in base salary, bonuses, and incentives.

Cam Skattebo’s low 2025 earnings highlight harsh reality for injured NFL rookies,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/cam-skattebos-low-2025-earnings-highlight-harsh-reality-for-injured-nfl-rookies/articleshow/126064517.cms,"Image via IMAGN

Why is Cam Skattebo's earnings so low?

Also Read:

Cam Skattebo’s rookie season in the NFL was shaping up to be one of the few bright spots in an otherwise grim year for the New York Giants. Drafted in the fourth round, the running back quickly outperformed expectations, earning starts, producing yards, and winning over fans with his aggressive, fearless style. Then came Week 8, and a harsh reminder of how unforgiving life in the NFL can be for young players.A non-contact injury against the Philadelphia Eagles ended Skattebo’s season instantly. The broken ankle not only sidelined him for the remainder of 2025 but also exposed an uncomfortable truth about rookie contracts and how little financial security many first-year players actually have.Before the injury, Skattebo had established himself as one of the most productive rookie running backs in the league. He was contributing both on the ground and as a receiver, carving out a legitimate role in the Giants’ offense. For a mid-round pick, that kind of early impact often signals long-term upside.Despite being an NFL starter for part of the season, Skattebo is expected to take home roughly $250,000 in 2025 after taxes and deductions. The figure sounds staggering to the average person, but in the context of professional football, it is a sobering amount.NFL salaries are paid weekly during the regular season, not as a lump sum. When a player is injured and placed on injured reserve, especially one without a fully guaranteed contract - earnings can drop significantly. Add federal and state taxes, agent fees, and other deductions, and the final number shrinks quickly.As a fourth-round rookie, Skattebo does not benefit from the financial protections that come with first-round contracts. His situation highlights how draft position still dictates earning power, even after strong on-field performances.While stars sign massive extensions and endorsement deals, many young players are one medical report away from uncertainty. The contrast between the league’s billion-dollar revenues and the fragile earnings of its newest players is stark.Cam Skattebo’s 2025 earnings are not an anomaly, they are a reflection of how the system works. His injury didn’t just derail a breakout season; it revealed the financial vulnerability that many NFL rookies face long before they ever reach stardom.","New York Giants running back Cam Skattebo is expected to take home roughly $250,000 in 2025 after taxes and deductions.

What happened during the livestream appearance

Puka Nacua’s apology and explanation

“I deeply apologize to anyone who was offended by my actions,”

“the worst”

After facing a significant backlash, Los Angeles Rams wide receiver Puka Nacua issued a public apology on Thursday for performing a gesture during a social media livestream that many viewed as offensive. The apology comes amid broader criticism of comments he made during the same livestream, including remarks about NFL referees that have drawn additional attention.Puka Nacua appeared this week on a livestream hosted by popular online personalities Adin Ross and N3on, where the conversation ranged from touchdown celebration ideas to opinions about NFL officiating. During the stream, Nacua agreed to perform a hand gesture that was suggested as part of a potential touchdown celebration.Shortly after clips from the livestream spread online, many observers noted that the gesture resembled imagery tied to harmful antisemitic stereotypes. The moment quickly drew criticism on social media and from public figures, intensifying scrutiny around the NFL star’s actions.In his statement, Nacua said he “had no idea” that the gesture was offensive or associated with antisemitic themes when he performed it during the livestream.He expressed regret for any hurt caused and made clear that he does not support “any form of racism, bigotry or hate of another group of people.”Nacua wrote, underscoring his intention to distance himself from the harmful implications of the moment.The controversial gesture was not the only part of the livestream that drew attention. During the same session, Nacua made pointed comments about NFL officials, calling themand suggesting some calls are made to gain television exposure. While many fans see such opinions as typical athlete frustration, the NFL has rules restricting public criticism of officiating, and players have been fined for similar remarks in the past.These later comments have contributed to ongoing debate about whether Nacua could face disciplinary action from the league, either through fines or internal team responses.As of this writing, the Los Angeles Rams and the NFL have not issued formal statements addressing Nacua’s apology or outlining disciplinary plans. The silence leaves open questions about whether further action will be taken.Also read - Sherrone Moore appears with extremely red eyes in mugshot released following arrest","Los Angeles Rams wide receiver Puka Nacua issued a public apology on Thursday for performing a gesture during a social media livestream that many viewed as offensive.

How the Fake Screenshot Went Viral

Sexyy Red and GloRilla Shut It Down

The Real Story Behind GloRilla and Brandon Ingram

Why Parody Accounts Keep Winning Attention

A bizarre fake screenshot almost put some reputable names in hot water after falsely claiming Sexyy Red was pushing for a polyamorous “throuple” with GloRilla and her NBA boyfriend, Brandon Ingram. The image spread fast, fueled by parody accounts that thrive on blurring the line between jokes and real celebrity news.Within hours, both rappers stepped in to shut the rumor down. What looked like messy celebrity drama turned out to be a clear case of online trolling, showing once again how quickly doctored posts can snowball into full-blown gossip if no one checks the source.The chaos started when parody pages such as Hoops Crave, a spoof of Pop Crave, and IngramAlerts shared a manipulated screenshot. The image showed what appeared to be Sexyy Red commenting “B*tch lets be sister wives” under GloRilla’s Instagram Story featuring Brandon Ingram. Alongside it was a bold caption claiming she wanted a poly relationship with the couple.The post gained traction before users questioned its authenticity. Adding to the absurdity, the fake post even squeezed in a plug encouraging fans to vote Ingram into the NBA All-Star Game.This mix of real names, fake captions, and promotional bait is exactly how troll accounts rack up engagement.Sexyy Red addressed the rumor head-on, making it clear she had nothing to do with the post and calling it “weird and fake.” She criticized whoever created it, saying she doesn’t entertain those kinds of games and labeling the whole thing lame.GloRilla responded just as firmly but with fewer words, flatly stating that the screenshot was fake and telling people to stop playing with her. Fans quickly backed both artists, dragging the parody accounts in comment sections and questioning why fabricated celebrity drama is treated as entertainment at all.Away from the fake drama, GloRilla and Brandon Ingram’s relationship has been well-documented since mid-2025. Dating rumors first caught fire around her July birthday celebration in Cabo, Mexico, where videos surfaced of the two dancing closely at a nightclub, arms wrapped around each other, before leaving together.Since then, GloRilla has been spotted attending Ingram’s games, wearing jewelry tied to his jersey number, and sharing cozy photos from nights out. Their public appearances have left little doubt that the relationship is real and serious, making the viral screenshot even more out of place.Parody and troll pages flourish because shock spreads faster than truth. Artists like GloRilla and Sexyy Red, both outspoken, popular, and closely associated through collaborations, are easy targets for engagement bait. Their real-life friendship helped sell the fake “sister wives” angle, even if it made no sense.Also read: “My baby is six days old and still no dad”: Rashida Nicole’s emotional call-out of LiAngelo Ball In the end, the situation caused little damage.

Jaylen Brown feels he can beat Stephen Curry in a 1-on-1 match

Jaylen Brown reveals harsh reality of his future with Boston Celtics

Boston Celtic Guard Jaylen Brown made a bold statement that he can beat Stephen Curry in a hypothetical 1-on-1 match. Brown was quite confident while stating in a live stream with the American rapper DDG. The stream went live on December 18, 2025. Moments later a clip went viral where the Celtics star could be seen making the statement about the Golden State Warriors legend. DDG, however, was a Curry fan and believed that in his prime era the NBA legend could even defeat Michael Jordan Brown’s statement came from the angle of size and weight. The Celtics star believed that Curry was too small. Even though he might be right, Curry’s shooting skill cannot be ignored. The veteran player is known for his shooting skills and ability to rack up 3-pointers throughout his career.DDG went on a live stream featuring Jaylen Brown on Twitch. The stream went live on December 18, 2025. One of the clips went viral immediately, in which Brown was seen giving out a statement involving Stephen Curry. He stated, “It’s like weight classes. He’s too small.” Brown further continued, “In one-on-one, Curry’s not beating me.But who’s up? You think there is going to be a clip or something? There won’t be any clip. ” At this point Brown caught DDG smiling.Watching the rapper smile, Brown posed a question to him, “You smiling. What are you smiling for?” DDG got defensive immediately and replied, “I am just a Curry fan. I am just saying, I fought for Curry, man. I think he could beat Michael Jordan though for sure.” When Brown mentioned Jordan’s age, stating he is old now, DDG replied, “I said in his prime.”Brown is 6’6” tall, weighing 223 pounds. On the contrary, Curry is 6’2” tall, weighing 185 pounds. The 29-year-old Celtics guard definitely has an advantage in this aspect. Moreover, Curry, throughout his career, hasn’t shown much effectiveness on the defensive aspect. But it cannot be ignored that the NBA legend has led his team, the Golden State Warriors, to multiple victories with his shooting skills. Both Brown and Curry will have their respective advantages in the hypothetical 1-on-1 match.In the same stream, Jaylen Brown decided to drop a few truth bombs. Being a realist, the player talked about his probable future with the franchise. He stated, “In our league, it's a business. It's not up to me. Sometimes it is, but sometimes it's not. Obviously, the fans -- they built a strong relationship. But the organization -- they might be like, 'We want to move in another direction one day.'”He further added, “But that doesn't mean I don't [expletive] with the city, or that I wouldn't mind being here for my whole career. But you know, anything can happen at any given moment. They traded Luka [Doncic], they traded Kevin Durant, they traded some all-time Hall of Famers. So you fall in line with that if it comes down to it.” His response made it clear that the player is well aware of the business and doesn’t keep any unrealistic expectation that might hurt him emotionally in the future.","Jaylen Brown made a bold statement that he can beat Stephen Curry in a hypothetical 1-on-1 match.

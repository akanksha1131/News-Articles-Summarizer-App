Poll Who should be the next captain of the Indian women's cricket team? Smriti Mandhana Deepti Sharma Jemimah Rodrigues

Should Harmanpreet Kaur call time on her captaincy after scripting India’s greatest cricketing triumph? The question has sparked widespread debate since the 36-year-old led India to their maiden Women’s ODI World Cup title at a packed DY Patil Stadium.Former India captain Shantha Rangaswamy has urged Harmanpreet to pass the baton to Smriti Mandhana , suggesting she could flourish even more without the weight of leadership.However, former India women’s team head coach Tushar Arothe believes Harmanpreet still has plenty left in the tank and can add a couple more ICC trophies as captain — much like Rohit Sharma did.With this triumph, Harmanpreet joined the elite list of Indian captains — alongside Kapil Dev (in 1983) and MS Dhoni (in 2011) — to have guided India to ODI World Cup glory.Dhoni remains the only captain, across men’s and women’s cricket, to have led India to three ICC trophies — the 2007 T20 World Cup, the 2011 ODI World Cup, and the 2013 Champions Trophy.Rohit is next in line, having led India to two ICC titles — the 2024 T20 World Cup and the 2025 Champions Trophy.""Why not? As long as she continues this form and performance, Harmanpreet can certainly lead India to a couple more ICC titles in the future,"" Arothe told TimesofIndia.com in an exclusive interview.Arothe took over as head coach in April 2017, just two months before the ODI World Cup in England. Under his guidance, India reached the final of the marquee tournament but suffered a heartbreaking nine-run defeat to England at Lord’s.""We lost narrowly — by just nine runs — and it still hurts. At one point, we were cruising, but then the wickets started falling and we fell short. It’s something we still remember, but the past is past. We can’t change it; we have to keep looking forward,"" Arothe said.""I’m very happy that the Indian women played absolutely brilliant cricket throughout the tournament. I would like to congratulate the entire team, the support staff, and of course, the BCCI for winning the ICC World Cup trophy,"" he added.Only three players from that 2017 heartbreak — Harmanpreet Kaur, Deepti Sharma, and Smriti Mandhana — were part of the 2025 final, where they finally etched their names in history as India lifted their first-ever Women’s World Cup.""Harman has always been a promising cricketer. I still recall my old days — in 2009, when Harman came into the Indian women’s team for the first time, we went to Australia for the World Cup. She had a pretty good series. We always knew she had immense talent and that she was a match-winner on her day,"" Arothe said.""We all know she has been a fantastic player for India. She proved it in 2017 with that brilliant knock against Australia in the semifinals. Over time, she has grown as a captain — she started believing in her players, believing in herself — and that’s how she has evolved. She’s doing a fantastic job now,"" he added.""We came very close to winning the title in 2017. That World Cup was like a green revolution for women’s cricket in India. After that, a lot more girls took up the sport, and parents began believing that women could build a career in cricket. The number of women cricketers increased, and competition grew gradually,"" the former coach said.""The BCCI has taken great steps since then — from matching the women’s match fees with the men’s, to starting under-15 and under-19 one-day and T20 tournaments. These initiatives have given a huge push to women’s cricket in India. That’s why I said, thank you very much — we really need to appreciate BCCI for all their efforts,"" he added.Did beating Australia in the semifinal already assure India of a World Cup title win?India defeated Australia in a thrilling semifinal by five wickets.Despite Australia posting a mammoth 338 on the board, India — thanks to an unbeaten 127 off 134 balls from Jemimah Rodrigues and a crucial 89 from captain Harmanpreet Kaur — chased down the record total with ease to book their place in the title clash.""Australia are obviously a tough team to beat in any league or knockout phase. But we can’t forget Jemimah’s knock — it was a fantastic, brilliant innings. Chasing 300 runs is a record, isn’t it? Scoring over 300 and winning against Australia in a one-day game was such an important moment for us. That win made the players believe in themselves, and they carried that confidence into the final. I would say that victory had already sealed the World Cup for us,"" he said.""And Deepti (Sharma) was outstanding in all departments. She has been a brilliant cricketer all these years. I’ve known her since 2015–16 — a fantastic fielder, a good off-spinner, and a utility batter. At one stage, when I was there, she even opened the innings. She’s a versatile player — a useful bowler, an excellent fielder, and a true team player. She’s extremely talented and always eager to perform in every game,"" Arothe said.",Harmanpreet Kaur led India to their maiden Women’s ODI World Cup title at a packed DY Patil Stadium.

BCCI sends a stern message to Mohsin Naqvi over Asia Cup trophy row

Once hailed as Pakistan ’s modern batting genius, Babar Azam is fast running out of excuses. The right-hander’s struggles continued in Faisalabad, where he scored just 7 runs in the first ODI against South Africa — extending his century drought to 80 international innings.For a player who was once compared to Virat Kohli , Babar’s recent record paints a worrying picture. Since his last international hundred — against Nepal in the 2023 Asia Cup — he has failed to cross three figures even once across formats. In his last 30 ODI innings, Babar has managed only 945 runs at an average of 35.00 and a strike rate of 78.55, with a highest score of just 78.Despite these underwhelming numbers, surprisingly Babar still sits fourth in the ICC ODI batting rankings. His inability to deliver match-winning knocks in recent months has sparked debate among fans and critics alike about whether he still deserves to be called Pakistan’s premier batter.The Faisalabad crowd, eager to see their hometown hero rediscover his touch, was left disappointed as he fell cheaply once again. While Pakistan went on to clinch a two-wicket win in a tense finish, thanks to Naseem Shah’s final-over single, Babar’s failure overshadowed much of the post-match celebrations.South Africa, batting first, posted 263 courtesy of Quinton de Kock (63) and debutant Lhuan-dre Pretorius (57). Pakistan’s bowlers, led by Abrar Ahmed (3-53) and Naseem Shah (3-40), did the job, but their captain’s batting continues to be a major concern.With two matches left in the series, pressure is mounting on Babar Azam. Unless he finds a way to end this alarming run, Pakistan’s supposed batting king might soon find his crown slipping.",Babar Azam has failed to score a century in 80 international innings.

Poll Do you believe in spreading health-related information without verifying its accuracy? Yes, it’s important to share everything. No, I prefer to verify information first.

Amanjot Kaur has dismissed rumours about her grandmother’s health, calling out fake news circulating online. The India all-rounder clarified that her “90s kid” is doing absolutely fine and urged people to stop spreading misinformation.The all-rounder shared a post on Instagram with a photo of her grandparents, writing: “Heyy, just wanted to share that my grandmother is doing well and in good health. Please don’t believe or spread false information circulating online. Thank you to everyone who’s reached out with care and concern,” Amanjot wrote.“My 90s kid is doing absolutely fine,” she added.Amanjot played a pivotal role in India’s historic first Women’s World Cup triumph. On Sunday night, under the bright floodlights and before 40,000 roaring fans at DY Patil Stadium, Amanjot produced a moment of brilliance in the 2025 Women’s ODI World Cup final. South African skipper Laura Wolvaardt, playing a magnificent 101, seemed to be single-handedly guiding her team to victory when she pulled one towards deep mid-wicket — only to find Amanjot sprinting in and holding on after a tense, three-attempt juggle.The crowd erupted as teammates rushed to embrace her, the tension melting into jubilation. That catch sealed the feeling — this was India’s night, and nothing was going to derail it.“Oh my God, it was the toughest catch of my life. I’ve never fumbled while taking a catch before. Either I catch the ball or drop it — there’s nothing in between! For the first time, God gave me three opportunities. It was a crucial catch, and we knew she would attack after completing her century and try to take charge from one end,” a smiling Amanjot told reporters in the Mixed Media Zone after her catch sealed India’s World Cup triumph.A gun fielder, Amanjot contributed significantly to India’s World Cup win, also effecting a crucial run out of Tazmin Brits to break South Africa’s opening partnership. “The wicket was playing better when they were batting. We knew that breaking partnerships was the key. It’s not easy to field under lights with the dew. We tried hard — there were a few lapses from us in the field — but God wanted us to win,” she said.",Amanjot Kaur has dismissed rumours about her grandmother's health.

NEW DELHI: Pakistan pacer Haris Rauf has been handed a two-match suspension and will miss the upcoming ODIs against South Africa after breaching the ICC Code of Conduct during the Asia Cup 2025 final against India on September 28, the International Cricket Council (ICC) announced on Tuesday.The ICC confirmed disciplinary actions arising from the India–Pakistan fixtures, with sanctions imposed following hearings by the Emirates ICC Elite Panel of Match Referees.“Following a hearing conducted by ICC Match Referee Richie Richardson, Haris Rauf was again found guilty of a breach of Article 2.21. He was fined 30 per cent of his match fee and received two additional demerit points,” the ICC said in a statement.“This takes Rauf’s total to four demerit points within a 24-month period, resulting in two suspension points.

Shah Rukh Khan Graces Special Fan Event For His 60th Birthday!

NEW DELHI: Bollywood icon and Kolkata Knight Riders co-owner Shah Rukh Khan celebrated his 60th birthday on November 2, receiving warm wishes from across the sporting world, including Indian cricket team coach Gautam Gambhir, IPL team owner Sanjeev Goenka, and KKR star Rinku Singh . The actor also met some of his lucky fans as part of the celebrations.Rinku Singh took to X (formerly Twitter) to wish the Bollywood superstar, posting: ""The best ever! Happy birthday @iamsrk sir.""Khan, known for his trademark wit and charm, replied to the cricketer’s post with a light-hearted comment that instantly went viral: ""Thank u Rinku. Lots of love... and shaadi kab hai?""Rinku Singh got engaged to Samajwadi Party Member of Parliament Priya Saroj in June 2025 at The Centrum hotel in Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh. The couple was originally set to marry in November this year, but the wedding was postponed to next year due to Singh’s cricketing schedule.In an interview earlier in August, Rinku shared how his relationship with Priya began.""It started in 2022 during the COVID years when the IPL was in Mumbai,"" he recalled. ""I had a fan page that put up a photo of Priya about some voting in her village. Priya's sister shoots photos and videos, so I think she had asked the fan page to put up a photo for help.I saw the photo and I liked her. I thought she was perfect for me. I thought about texting her, but then I thought it wouldn't be right.""The KKR batter further opened up about how things eventually progressed between the two. ""She liked a couple of my photos.

NEW DELHI: The International Cricket Council (ICC) has confirmed disciplinary actions against multiple players from India and Pakistan following several heated encounters during the ICC Asia Cup 2025.

Harmanpreet Kaur gets emotional after leading India to World Cup glory

Smriti Mandhana's IG story for her teammate

India’s maiden Women’s World Cup triumph on Sunday night was marked by joy, emotion, and moments that went beyond the scoreboard.As the celebrations carried on deep into the night at DY Patil Stadium, one gesture from vice-captain Smriti Mandhana stood out.While every player received their share of applause, Mandhana took to Instagram to appreciate a teammate who didn’t feature in a single game during the tournament — pacer Arundhati Reddy. The 28-year-old bowler, however, was an energetic presence in team huddles and in the dugout.She also featured in the celebratory posts made by Jemimah Rodrigues, especially the one that went viral and was captioned ""Are we still dreaming?""Sharing a story with a message for Reddy, Mandhana wrote, “People from the outside won’t know what you have done for this team! To not get to play a match but still show up every session with a smile and take care of everyone around! You are our Star! @arundhati.reddy.”The message reflected the close relationship within the squad that powered India to its first-ever Women’s ODI World Cup title.Reddy, though not part of the playing XI in any of the nine matches, was lauded by teammates for her spirit and support throughout the campaign.On the field, India sealed history with a commanding 52-run win over South Africa in the final. Shafali Verma and Deepti Sharma were central to the performance.Shafali struck 87 at the top, while Deepti produced an all-round display with 54 runs and a five-wicket haul.India posted 298/7, the second-highest total ever in a Women’s ODI World Cup final.In response, South Africa fought hard through Laura Wolvaardt’s century, but Deepti’s 5 for 39 and sharp fielding efforts, including a direct hit from Amanjot Kaur to run out Tazmin Brits, sealed the result.The victory ended decades of heartbreak and brought India their first ICC title in women’s cricket.Yet amid the historic celebrations, Mandhana’s words for Reddy highlighted the unseen contributions that shaped this journey, sending a reminder that every World Cup win is built not just on those who play, but also on those who lift the team from behind the scenes.",Smriti Mandhana took to Instagram to thank Arundhati Reddy for her support.

Pratika Rawal Father Interview: On daughter's hundred, the World Cup dream and more

Pratika Rawal may not have played the final stages of the Women’s World Cup 2025, but her contribution to India’s historic triumph remains unforgettable. The 25-year-old batter finished as the team’s second-highest run-scorer despite missing the knockout games, yet she did not receive a winner’s medal due to ICC rules.Rawal’s World Cup campaign came to a heartbreaking halt after she injured her ankle during India’s group-stage clash against Bangladesh. Before that setback, she had scored 308 runs in six innings at an impressive average of 51.33, including several crucial knocks that helped India reach the semifinals. However, her injury forced the team management to bring in Shafali Verma as a replacement.Also Watch:According to ICC regulations, medals are awarded only to players in the final 15-member squad. Since Rawal was replaced before the semifinal, she missed out on the winner’s medal, even though her runs were instrumental in setting up India’s title charge. Interestingly, the same situation occurred in the 2003 Men’s World Cup when Australia’s Jason Gillespie, despite taking eight wickets in four games, was replaced after an injury and did not receive a medal.On Sunday night, as India defeated South Africa by 52 runs at the DY Patil Stadium to lift their maiden Women’s ODI World Cup trophy, Rawal watched the scenes unfold from the sidelines.Sitting in her wheelchair, wrapped in the Indian flag, she could not hold back her tears.“I can’t even express it. There are no words. This flag on my shoulder means so much. To be here with my team — it’s surreal. Injuries are part of the game, but I’m just so happy I could still be part of this team. I love this team. I can’t express what I feel — we actually did it! We’re the first Indian team to win the World Cup in so long. The whole of India deserves this,” she said emotionally.For Rawal, the moment was bittersweet. She could not take the field in the final, but as Shafali Verma’s blistering 87 guided India to victory, she celebrated every boundary and wicket with the same passion as her teammates.“Honestly, it was harder to watch than to play. Every wicket, every boundary — it gave me goosebumps. The energy, the crowd, the emotion — it was incredible,” she said.Her story stands as a reminder that sometimes heroes of a championship do not always stand on the podium, but their impact is deeply felt in every cheer, every run, and every dream fulfilled.",Pratika Rawal scored 308 runs in six innings at an impressive average of 51.33.

During the process, Williams informed the board that he has been battling substance abuse and has voluntarily sought treatment.As a result, ZC announced that Williams will not be considered for national selection and that his central contract will not be renewed.“ZC expects all contracted players to uphold the highest standards of professionalism, discipline and compliance with team protocols and anti-doping regulations,” the board said in a statement. “While ZC commends him for seeking rehabilitation, withdrawal from team commitments under circumstances involving potential testing raises serious concerns regarding professional and ethical standards.”The board also highlighted that Williams’ career record showed a “history of disciplinary issues and repeated unavailability,” which had impacted team preparation and performance.Williams, 39, has been one of Zimbabwe’s most consistent performers since his international debut in 2005.He has scored over 8,000 runs across formats, including 5,217 in ODIs at an average of 37.53, with eight centuries and 37 fifties.Earlier this year, he became the longest-serving active international cricketer, surpassing England’s James Anderson in terms of debut-to-present career span.Acknowledging his long service, ZC added: “ZC sincerely acknowledges and appreciates his immense contribution to Zimbabwean cricket over the past two decades. Williams has played a pivotal role in some of the most significant moments in our recent history, leaving a lasting legacy both on and off the field. ZC wishes him strength in his recovery, and every success in his future endeavours.”Williams had faced disciplinary issues in the past as well, notably in 2014 when he was left out of the Bangladesh tour following a dispute arising from a national training camp.","Sean Williams has withdrawn from national duty after revealing that he is undergoing rehabilitation for drug addiction.

Jasprit Bumrah vs Injury: Untold story of why Indian cricketers fear getting hurt

Poll Do you think the ICC's warning to Bumrah was justified? Yes, it was necessary No, it was excessive

India pacer Jasprit Bumrah has accepted an official warning from the International Cricket Council (ICC) for breaching the Code of Conduct during the Asia Cup 2025 final against Pakistan in Dubai.The incident took place on September 28, when Bumrah was found to have breached Article 2.21 of the ICC Code of Conduct, which deals with conduct that brings the game into disrepute.He accepted the charge and the proposed sanction of an official warning, resulting in one demerit point on his disciplinary record.The matter was handled by ICC Match Referee Richie Richardson. There was no formal hearing required for the pacer as he accepted the sanction.""Jasprit Bumrah (India) accepted a charge under Article 2.21 for conduct that brings the game into disrepute and the proposed sanction of an official warning, which resulted in one demerit point. As he accepted the sanction, no formal hearing was required,"" the ICC release read.While the ICC release does not name the action/incident, it likely pertains to Bumrah’s celebration after dismissing Pakistan pacer Haris Rauf during the final, a moment that drew wide attention on and off the field.Bowling in the 18th over, the pace spearhead lit up the Dubai night with his trademark yorker that shattered Haris Rauf’s stumps. What made the moment go viral, however, was his reaction, as he celebrated with a wide grin followed by a cheeky imitation of Rauf’s own “jet” celebration, sending the crowd and social media into a frenzy.In the same match, Rauf was also found guilty of the same offence and fined 30 per cent of his match fee, along with two demerit points. In total, Rauf had four demerit points as penalty, which resulted in him missing out on Pakistan’s ODI games against South Africa on November 4 and 6.India went on to win the final by five wickets, chasing down Pakistan’s total with two balls to spare to lift the Asia Cup trophy.","Jasprit Bumrah has accepted an official warning from the International Cricket Council (ICC) for breaching the Code of Conduct during the Asia Cup 2025 final against Pakistan in Dubai.

BCCI sends a stern message to Mohsin Naqvi over Asia Cup trophy row

The International Cricket Council (ICC) has announced the results of several Code of Conduct hearings arising from the India–Pakistan encounters during the ICC Asia Cup 2025. The disciplinary actions, confirmed on Tuesday, follow investigations into on-field incidents from the matches held on September 14, 21, and 28. These hearings were conducted by members of the ICC Elite Panel of Match Referees.The September 14 clash saw India’s Suryakumar Yadav and Pakistan’s Haris Rauf and Sahibzada Farhan charged with breaches of Article 2.21 of the ICC Code of Conduct, which addresses behaviour that brings the game into disrepute. ICC Match Referee Richie Richardson found all three guilty. Suryakumar was fined 30% of his match fee and given two demerit points. Farhan received an official warning and one demerit point, while Rauf was fined 30% of his match fee and handed two demerit points.A week later, on September 21, India pacer Arshdeep Singh was cleared of an alleged breach of Article 2.6, which pertains to using obscene or offensive gestures. ICC Match Referee Andy Pycroft found him not guilty, and no sanction was imposed.Also read: Diamond jewellery, solar panels and 297% prize money hike — India's World Cup queens rewarded royally



In the September 28 final between India and Pakistan, further disciplinary action followed.Jasprit Bumrah accepted responsibility for a breach of Article 2.21 for conduct deemed to bring the game into disrepute. By accepting the charge and sanction—a formal warning and one demerit point—Bumrah avoided a hearing.However, Pakistan pacer Haris Rauf once again came under scrutiny for the same offence. Following a second hearing before Richie Richardson, Rauf was fined another 30% of his match fee and given two additional demerit points. This took his tally to four demerit points within a 24-month period, which automatically converts to two suspension points under ICC rules. As a result, Rauf has been suspended from Pakistan’s upcoming ODIs against South Africa on November 4 and 6, 2025.According to ICC regulations, Level 1 breaches carry a minimum penalty of an official reprimand and a maximum of a 50% match-fee fine, along with one or two demerit points. Once a player accumulates four or more demerit points in two years, they are converted into suspension points, resulting in a ban. Demerit points remain on record for 24 months before being expunged.","The International Cricket Council (ICC) has announced the results of several Code of Conduct hearings arising from the India–Pakistan encounters during the ICC Asia Cup 2025.

Liverpool secured a 2-0 victory against Aston Villa in the Premier League , ending their four-game losing streak. Mohamed Salah achieved his 250th goal for the club, and Ryan Gravenberch added another goal to help the defending champions move up to third place in the standings.""I'm glad we are back on track now. It's a very tricky season for us because we have a few new players, they are very good players, but they need time to adapt. We lost some players too. It takes time to adapt and know each other's games, but everything will be fine,"" said Salah.Liverpool manager Arne Slot's decision to make multiple changes during Wednesday's 3-0 League Cup loss to Crystal Palace increased pressure on the returning players to secure a win after six defeats in seven games across all competitions.""What I liked most was that I think everybody here felt the importance of the game. I'm talking about my players and I'm talking about the fans. From start to finish the players showed up,"" said Slot.Liverpool faced early pressure when Morgan Rogers hit the post with a shot after five minutes. This continued their pattern of struggling in the opening 15 minutes, which had been evident in their previous four Premier League defeats.Villa initially showed strength in breaking through Liverpool's defense but later struggled with their own defensive play. Dominik Szoboszlai missed an opportunity after taking the ball from Pau Torres, shooting directly at Martinez.Hugo Ekitike's header goal was disallowed after VAR review showed he was offside from Szoboszlai's cross. Martinez's error then allowed Salah to score just before half-time, marking his 250th goal for Liverpool.Salah's goal, his fifth of the season, places him as Liverpool's third-highest scorer in club history, behind only Ian Rush and Roger Hunt. The goal also ended Liverpool's streak of conceding first in seven consecutive games.Villa entered the match having won their previous four league games, including victories over Tottenham and Manchester City. They were level on points with Liverpool before the game.Gravenberch, who had missed the previous weekend's 3-2 loss at Brentford due to an ankle injury, scored Liverpool's second goal. His shot deflected off Pau Torres, deceiving Martinez.Liverpool achieved their first clean sheet in 11 games. The team now prepares for upcoming matches against Real Madrid in the Champions League and Manchester City in the Premier League.Liverpool's recent poor form has created a significant challenge in their title defence against Arsenal. The victory reduced their gap behind Arsenal to seven points, providing a starting point for their return to the title race.Joao Pedro ended his goal drought for Chelsea by scoring the decisive goal in a 1-0 victory against Tottenham at their home stadium on Saturday.The Brazilian striker scored his first goal since August 30, when he last found the net against Fulham, breaking a nine-game goalless streak across all competitions.Since his £60 million transfer from Brighton during the transfer window, the 24-year-old has only managed to score three times for Chelsea.Chelsea moved to fourth place in the Premier League standings after securing their third win in four matches, trailing Tottenham only on goal difference.Tottenham's struggles at home continue, as they haven't secured a victory at their stadium since defeating Burnley in the season opener in August.Their poor home form in 2025 began under previous manager Ange Postecoglou and has persisted under Frank's leadership.Despite a League Cup defeat at Newcastle, Tottenham's away performances have been stronger, including a convincing 3-0 win at Everton in their last league match.Tottenham supporters are showing increasing dissatisfaction with Frank's tactical approach, which differs from the club's traditional attacking philosophy.An early setback occurred when Lucas Bergvall suffered a head injury and was replaced by Xavi Simons as a concussion substitute.Bergvall showed resistance to the medical staff's decision, pushing one of them before Frank stepped in to calm the situation.Alejandro Garnacho posed Chelsea's primary attacking threat in the first half, testing Tottenham goalkeeper Guglielmo Vicario with long-range attempts.Vicario recovered from a knee injury to make a crucial save, denying Joao Pedro after a defensive error by Pedro Porro.Joao Pedro broke the deadlock in the 34th minute, capitalising on Moises Caicedo's pressure on Simons and Van de Ven to score from close range.Frank expressed his frustration with Tottenham's defensive errors by kicking a water bottle on the sideline.Joao Pedro nearly doubled his tally, but Vicario saved his powerful shot following Malo Gusto's assist.Rodrigo Bentancur received a yellow card for a challenge on Reece James, which could have warranted a more severe punishment.Mohammed Kudus tested Chelsea goalkeeper Robert Sanchez just before halftime, but his shot was well saved.After the break, Enzo Fernandez missed a clear opportunity, heading over from James' cross from ten yards out.Tottenham's possession problems continued in the second half, leading to growing frustration among their supporters.Vicario was forced to make another save from Pedro Neto's powerful attempt, while Tottenham failed to mount a serious comeback in the closing stages.",Liverpool secured a 2-0 victory against Aston Villa in the Premier League.

Arsenal put more distance between them and the rest at the top of the Premier League table with a composed 2-0 victory over Burnley on Saturday, extending their winning run in the competition to five matches.The result pushed Mikel Arteta’s men seven points clear at the summit and further strengthened their bid to end a two-decade wait for the league title. Viktor Gyokeres opened the scoring with a well-timed header from Declan Rice’s corner in the first half, marking his first league goal since mid-September.Rice then doubled Arsenal’s advantage in the 35th minute, heading home from close range to give the visitors firm control at Turf Moor. Arsenal’s threat from set-pieces once again proved decisive, while their defensive record remained formidable, having conceded just three league goals in ten games this season.Arteta praised the balance in his side’s performances, saying his players had “shown maturity in difficult away games” and were “playing with a real sense of control.” The Gunners have now won nine straight games across all competitions, maintaining a consistent rhythm on both ends of the pitch.Burnley rarely threatened and remain in the bottom three, struggling to find form at home. Arsenal, meanwhile, continue to set the pace in the title race with another confident display built on discipline and precision.

Madison Beer says this album marks the end of one life phase and the beginning of another

More coverage on NFL by Barsha Dutta:

Madison Beer is stepping into this album cycle differently and more transparently, than any moment in her career so far. Hours after owning the Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show runway, she confirmed her new album locket, arriving January 16, and the reveal came with unexpected emotion. Beer didn’t just press upload and celebrate.Her body reacted before her brain could keep up. It was physical. It was years of internal processing finally given shape. This is the first hint that locket isn’t a typical “new era” announcement, it’s the shedding of a skin, the closing of a book, and the beginning of a more grounded narrative she’s ready to share publicly.“It feels really weird. I wasn't anticipating to cry after I posted it,” she admitted, recalling how her hands literally shook after she flashed the vinyl sample on a 30-second livestream and then ended up sobbing afterward. “I just think it's kind of the end of an old chapter, the beginning of a new one.”That sentence, more than anything, reveals what this drop symbolizes. It’s not just release-day excitement. It’s Madison emotionally closing pages that fans never got to see written in real time.“I've been collecting vintage jewelry and just random stuff for years, and I've collected a lot of vintage lockets,” she said while explaining how the name wasn’t dreamed up in a boardroom, it was pulled from her actual ritual and attachment to small symbolic objects.And that’s where the metaphor deepens.“You'll hear on a song on the album I talk about how my locket is something that I metaphorically carry with me… inclusive of the good and the bad.”Everything she keeps close and occasionally needs to open, is in there. And in 2025, she’s finally ready to show the world what’s inside.","Madison Beer unveiled her new album, 'locket,' with profound emotion.

The unexpected London theatre crossover instantly sent Swifties into meltdown mode

More coverage on NFL by Barsha Dutta:

Sometimes a single fan photo can break the internet and this one certainly did. Two of Taylor Swift’s most dissected exes, Joe Alwyn and Tom Hiddleston, were spotted together at London’s Bridge Theatre, and within seconds, Swifties pulled out their digital detective boards.These aren’t just any exes, these are the two men tied to an entire era of Taylor Swift pop-culture mythology, lyrical easter eggs, and one of the most over-analyzed timelines of her 2016 summer. So when a fan captured Joe leaving the venue with Tom, social media didn’t treat it like a casual hangout. Online, it instantly became a “Getaway Car” cinematic universe moment.Joe Alwyn is currently performing in the West End production of The Lady from the Sea, and Tom Hiddleston, yes, the same ex who danced with Taylor at that unforgettable 2016 Met Gala moment, showed up in the audience. One fan simply posted the photo evidence and within seconds the comments section became a Swift-coded meme parade.Social media users didn’t even bother being subtle. “This is literally the plot of Getaway Car,” one fan declared, a sentiment repeated across timelines. Another went even further, calling the sighting “the cast of Getaway Car.”And someone else delivered maybe the best punchline of the night: “did they leave by taking…. a …. getaway car?”While Taylor is now deep into a new life chapter, writing new eras, winning new Grammys and planning a future with Travis Kelce, that 2016-2017 window refuses to fade from fan memory.The references, the Met Gala hair, the lyrics in “Dress,” even the Calvin Harris overlap, Swifties still treat that period like serialized lore.And this London link-up just handed them fresh canon. Because whether innocent or intentional, two major names from that chapter standing side-by-side in 2025 feels like a pop culture glitch the type only Taylor Swift’s universe can generate.",Joe Alwyn and Tom Hiddleston were spotted together at London's Bridge Theatre.

the

Why trading AJ Brown was never realistic

For everyone refreshing their feeds hoping for another blockbuster trade before the NFL deadline, sorry, this one’s a no-go. Philadelphia Eagles star wide receiver AJ Brown is staying put. Despite a few days of online buzz suggesting he might be on the move, multiple insiders have confirmed that Brown has not been and will not be traded before the deadline.Brown has been one of the Eagles’ most reliable offensive weapons, and honestly, the thought of him leaving Philly never really added up. But like clockwork, the rumor mill tried its best to stir up chaos until now.NFL insider Adam Schefter confirmed Tuesday that the Eagles are not trading AJ Brown, putting an end to the internet speculation that picked up just before the trade deadline. Team sources said there was “no scenario” in which Philly was parting ways with its top receiver this season.Brown’s importance to the Eagles’ offense makes this move a no-brainer. He’s not just one of the league’s top wideouts, he’sguy Jalen Hurts trusts when it matters most. The Eagles made it clear through their play and their statements: AJ Brown is staying in green.Even when the rumors started trending, most analysts saw them as nothing more than clickbait.Brown is under contract with the Eagles and remains a key part of the team’s long-term plan. Moving him would’ve come with a massive cap hit, not to mention the obvious on-field setback of losing Hurts’ go-to target.Since joining the Eagles, Brown has completely reshaped their offense. His chemistry with Hurts and his ability to dominate defenses make him irreplaceable and the front office knows it. Trading him now would’ve been both financially painful and competitively disastrous.So there you have it, no trade, no surprises. AJ Brown is staying in Philadelphia, and the Eagles are keeping their offensive powerhouse intact. With Brown locked in for the rest of the season, Philly’s Super Bowl push continues with all the firepower they need.Sometimes, the biggest NFL headline is the one that doesn’t happen.Also read - Sauce Gardner traded to Colts in shocking blockbuster deal — full trade details and fan reactions",NFL insider Adam Schefter confirmed Tuesday that the Eagles are not trading AJ Brown.

More coverage on the NFL



President Donald Trump and billionaire pop star, Taylor Swift , have never seen eye to eye because of their different ideologies. While Taylor Swift tries to keep herself away from the drama, President Donald Trump has been very vocal about his negative feelings for the pop star.Amid all the mess, the White House has made a pretty controversial post using Taylor Swift’s newly released hit track, “The Fate of Ophelia”. This has sparked chaos and confusion among fans.A few hours ago, the White House posted a video containing images of Washington, D.C., the U.S. Army and photos of Trump, 79, first lady Melania Trump, Vice President JD Vance and second lady Usha Vance, with Taylor Swift’s hit track being the background song.The caption of the post read as, “OUR VIBES”, and it has sparked chaos among fans, considering how President Donald Trump has always made controversial remarks about Taylor Swift.One of the visuals in the video is of President Donald Trump kissing the American Flag to the lyrics of “Cause you’re mine”.A second visual is of President Donald Trump working at McDonald’s along the lyrics of “The fate of Ophelia”.What’s the drama between President Donald Trump and Taylor Swift?For the unversed, the drama between Taylor Swift and President Donald Trump began years ago but it became worse when the pop star publicly endorsed Kamala Harris.In 2024, after the presidential debate, Taylor Swift wrote, ""I’m voting for @kamalaharris because she fights for the rights and causes I believe need a warrior to champion them. I think she is a steady-handed, gifted leader and I believe we can accomplish so much more in this country if we are led by calm and not chaos. I was so heartened and impressed by her selection of running mate @timwalz, who has been standing up for LGBTQ+ rights, IVF, and a woman’s right to her own body for decades…”This led to Donald Trump making a post on Truth Social which read as, “I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT”.President Donald Trump also made controversial remarks when Travis Kelce’s team lost the Super Bowl as he wrote, ""Has anyone noticed that, since I said 'I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT,' she's no longer 'HOT?'

Jets trade Sauce Gardner to Colts for two first-round picks — Here’s what it mean

Why the Jets pulled the trigger on this deal

The NFL just dropped a bombshell. In one of the most shocking trade-deadline moves in recent memory, the New York Jets have traded star cornerback Sauce Gardner to the Indianapolis Colts. The Colts are sending two first-round picks (2026 & 2027) and wide receiver Adonai Mitchell in return, according to multiple reports.The move comes just months after Gardner inked a massive four-year, $120.4 million contract extension with the Jets, making this deal even more unexpected. Fans, analysts, and even players are stunned that New York would part ways with one of the league’s best defensive talents right in his prime.Per reports, the Colts are sending their 2026 and 2027 first-round picks plus Adonai Mitchell to the Jets in exchange for Sauce Gardner.The trade was finalized just hours before the 2025 NFL deadline, signaling that both front offices had been working on this quietly for days. For the Jets, the deal clears massive cap space while loading up on future draft capital. For the Colts, it’s a clear statement, they’re all in on building an elite defense around Gardner.Gardner’s contract will transfer to Indianapolis, keeping him locked in through 2029, while New York takes on a modest dead cap hit from his signing bonus.At first glance, this trade feels unthinkable. Sauce Gardner wasn’t just the Jets’ best player, he was the face of their defense. But sources suggest the move was rooted in roster reset and financial flexibility.The Jets’ defense has remained solid, but their offense continues to underperform, and the front office may be prioritizing rebuilding around a younger, cheaper core. The two first-round picks also give New York massive draft leverage for 2026 and 2027 possibly setting up a future QB move or defensive retool.Still, many fans are calling this a “betrayal” of the Jets’ defensive identity. Gardner, who made the Pro Bowl in back-to-back seasons and was named First-Team All-Pro as a rookie, was widely seen as untouchable.For the Colts, this is a dream scenario. Gardner, just 25 years old, instantly transforms their secondary into one of the best in the league. His elite coverage skills, length, and physicality make him the kind of shutdown corner who can neutralize any WR1 in the AFC.Gardner has allowed under a 50% completion rate in coverage over the past two seasons in elite territory. His arrival pairs him with safety Julian Blackmon and linebacker Zaire Franklin, giving Indianapolis one of the most balanced defensive units in football.Also read - Breaking: Rashid Shaheed traded to Seahawks — full trade details, analysis and how it shakes up both teams","The New York Jets have traded star cornerback Sauce Gardner to the Indianapolis Colts.

She stated, “Before we get started, how do you feel being a beauty entrepreneur?”Savannah starts her answer with a cheerful laugh. It almost felt like she was waiting to be asked about it.Savannah replied, “I feel really good. I feel like I have really found my position and my purpose in this.” Even though the venture can be tagged as an achievement, the businesswoman feels that there is a lot more. She adds, “It’s still an adjustment with all the things cause it’s a f**king lot.” Savannah immediately ropes in April within her replies, “I do not envy you at all, because this is very minuscule in comparison. ” This came in the context of April’s own business ventures.“Obviously, I am gonna get there. But I need to take my time. Slow and steady wins the f**king race. But it feels good.” At this point April asked her if she feels proud, to which Savannah replied, “I feel proud.” She even stated the moment when she feels the most proud. It is when the reviews come in and people state that the products had really worked for them. It looks like the entrepreneur has received enough motivation to keep going and push herself to newer heights.","Savannah James talks about the pride and pressure that comes with her beauty venture.

"""Your opinion equals zero"" - Draymond Green fires back at Kevin Durant championing offense over defense to win titles",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/your-opinion-equals-zero-draymond-green-fires-back-at-kevin-durant-championing-offense-over-defense-to-win-titles/articleshow/125096696.cms,"Kevin Durant and Draymond Green (Image via X)

Draymond Green has some scathing words for Kevin Durant

To say that Kevin Durant and Draymond Green don't exactly see eye to eye would be an understatement. If one says east, it sometimes seems like the other has to go west. Even though they played for the Golden State Warriors for three consecutive seasons, taking their team to the finals from 2016 to 2019, and winning two championships together, they haven't had the smoothest relationship as teammates, and even less so since Durant left the Warriors in 2019 to join the Brooklyn Nets.Durant was recently heard championing a team's offense as the thing that makes them winners. Draymond Green, who is considered one of the greatest defensive players of all-time, is a big part of the Warriors defense - someone who has been instrumental in his team's multiple championships over the years. So, it does make sense that he would fire back at Durant's comments when he had an unguarded chat with The Athletic recently.A recent clip from the Netflix’s series “Starting 5” went viral, where Houston Rockets star Kevin Durant can be heard saying that a team's offense is what wins them titles. He is one of the best scorers in the league - the only player other than LeBron James, who ranks #1, who is an active player that made the Top 10 list of NBA career scoring leaders, standing at #8. So yes, it is no surprise that he would champion a team's offense as something that brings them titles.Draymond Green, though, thinks differently. During his recent chat with The Athletic, he had some scathing words for his once teammate, when he said that the only people who don't value a team's defense are the ones who don't win.“Those who don’t believe defense is as valuable as it is, they simply just don’t win. I don’t think anyone’s ever really been hell-bent on caring about the opinion of those that don’t win, because your opinion equals zero.”The reporter though pointed out that Durant has won championships, but Green had an answer for that too. “He won here, (and) the defense here was…” to which the reporter had to acquiesce, “It was incredible.”Durant has won two championships in his career, both with the Golden State Warriors, and the team has always been incredible in its defense. While Stephen Curry, and Durant - when he was with them, led the scoring for the team, players like Green and Klay Thompson held the fort as one of the greatest ever defensive teams in the league. So while Durant may be right in saying scoring baskets wins games, fans have to agree that having a good defense is the key to winning championships.Also Read: 2016 NBA Finals game breakdown on Mind The Game finally gives Stephen Curry something to be ""happy"" about","Kevin Durant was recently heard championing a team's offense as the thing that makes them winners.

The highly anticipated regular season clash between theon November 4, 2025, comes with its fair share of injury concerns. Both Western Conference contenders are managing short-handed rosters, which are going to significantly shape the game’s dynamics and strategies. With early-season momentum on the line, the matchup at Chase Center promises not only star power but also a test of roster depth and coaching adaptability.As both teams look to find consistency in the opening weeks of the 2025-26 NBA season, the injury situation adds an extra layer of concern. The Suns enter the game with a 3-4 record, searching for stability amid a string of setbacks, while the Warriors stand at 4-3, eager to defend their home court. The availability of key players is a major talking point leading up to tip-off, influencing lineups, rotations, and overall expectations for this early-season battle.The Phoenix Suns face notable absences that are likely to leave head coach Jordan Ott with difficult decisions regarding his rotations. Star contributors Dillon Brooks and Jalen Green were both ruled out - Brooks with a core muscle strain and Green nursing a right hamstring strain.Their absences are a major blow, as both players provide vital defensive toughness and scoring versatility. Without them, the Suns have to rely more heavily on their healthy core and supporting cast to shoulder the load.Forward Isaiah Livers is listed as questionable due to a right hip contusion, leaving uncertainty about his availability until close to game time. Rookie Ryan Dunn is probable with a left knee contusion and was expected to play limited minutes off the bench. The combination of these injuries place pressure on the Suns’ depth, particularly on the wings, where Brooks and Green’s defensive presence would be missed the most. With a depleted lineup, Phoenix’s focus turn to maximizing the efficiency of their healthy stars and executing with precision against a well-rounded Warriors team.The Golden State Warriors also enter the matchup facing their own injury issues. Veteran big man Al Horford is sidelined with a left toe injury that required load management, depriving Golden State of an experienced interior presence and valuable leadership. Guard De’Anthony Melton remains out following left ACL surgery, keeping him off the court for an extended recovery period. In addition, rookie Alex Toohey continues to miss time due to a left knee injury, delaying his much-anticipated season debut.These absences force the Warriors to rely heavily on their starting unit led by Stephen Curry, alongside role players tasked with stepping up in critical moments. Despite the injuries, Golden State maintains a slightly healthier rotation than the Suns and benefited from playing at home, where their crowd support and familiarity with the court often translate into strong performances.Both teams enter this matchup under less-than-ideal conditions, making depth and tactical adjustments the deciding factors. For the Suns, losing Brooks and Green impact both their perimeter defense and scoring rhythm, potentially giving the Warriors room to exploit mismatches. Meanwhile, the Warriors aim to capitalize on their home advantage and continue building chemistry despite the absence of key rotation players.The game represents more than just another regular-season contest - it is an early barometer for resilience and adaptability. With playoff aspirations for both sides, managing injuries effectively and maintaining momentum could set the tone for the months ahead.Ultimately, the November 4 matchup between the Phoenix Suns and Golden State Warriors showcases how each team can manage adversity early in the season. With both rosters battling through injuries, the contest emphasizes depth in the long grind of the NBA season.","The Phoenix Suns host the Golden State Warriors on November 4, 2025.

Stephen Curry laughing while watching 2016 NBA Finals highlight is a first

The 2016 NBA Finals between the Cleveland Cavaliers and the Golden State Warriors is something most basketball fans can remember. LeBron James played some of his best basketball that season, which led the Cavaliers to their first and only NBA Championship. But the Warriors were not an easy team to overcome, who had finished the regular season on a 73–9 run, breaking an NBA record. They were the defending champions, and the favorites to win the 2016 season as well. But Bron was a beast on court, and the title went to the East, 4-3.Recently, during Stephen Curry's appearance at the Mind the Game podcast with LeBron James and Steve Nash, the trio looked back on some of their on-court duels, and started with one from the 2016 finals. While that was undoubtedly a sour spot for the Warriors star, one particular scene from the clips did bring a smile to his face, and he couldn't help but laugh. After all, LeBron James guarding Draymond Green in the court, is bound to get a laugh out of you, even Bron agrees.It would not shock anyone to know that watching the game from 2016's NBA Finals between the Cleveland Cavaliers and the Golden State Warriors does not bring any joy to Stephen Curry.The Warriors were all set to win their second consecutive NBA Championship, having started their campaign as the reigning champions after winning the title in 2015. They broke records, won the hearts of fans, and played brilliant basketball on court.During the 2015-2016 season, they made an NBA record with the most regular season wins by an NBA team - 73 wins and 9 losses. A record that is yet to be broken by anyone else. But all that seemed futile when they lost the championship to the Cleveland Cavaliers with a 4-3 run during the finals, and it was James and his hometown team that got the glory. So yes, it's easy to see why Steph Curry would not feel too happy watching highlights from that game. But all that changed with one single clip during his latest appearance at the Mind the Game podcast.Steve Nash brought out a video from the finals, and in it, none other than LeBron James could be seen guarding Warriors big man, Draymond Green. Curry looked absolutely delighted with the find, asking, ""Is that you guarding Draymond?"" James could be heard laughing, trying to think of what to say, ""Yeah. I completely—"" while Nash cheekily added, ""We've got a few of them."" Curry could not help but laugh out loud, saying, ""This is the happiest I've ever been watching this game.

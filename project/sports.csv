NEW DELHI: In one of IPL 2025 ’s most gripping encounters, Krunal Pandya stole the spotlight at the Wankhede Stadium as Royal Challengers Bengaluru edged past Mumbai Indians by 12 runs in a thrilling sibling showdown.In a match where both Pandyas featured prominently, it was Krunal who held his nerve when it mattered most, delivering a match-winning spell of 4 for 45 in four overs.Defending 221, RCB found themselves under pressure when Hardik Pandya launched a counterattack, smashing 42 off just 15 balls.Alongside Tilak Varma (56 off 29), Hardik kept MI in the hunt, with the side cruising at 181 for 4 after 17 overs. But Krunal’s return in the death overs turned the tide dramatically.With MI needing 19 from 6 balls and Mitchell Santner looking solid, Krunal struck with his first ball of the 19th over, dismissing the Kiwi with a full-length delivery.From there, the veteran all-rounder unleashed a flurry of game-changing deliveries, removing Deepak Chahar and dangerous Naman Dhir in the span of four balls.The over yielded three wickets and just six runs, effectively shutting the door on Mumbai’s late charge.Krunal's final figures read 4/45 -- expensive on paper, but invaluable considering the context and the quality of scalps. His clinical execution under pressure earned him the upper hand in the much-hyped Pandya duel.Earlier in the match, Krunal didn’t get to bat as RCB posted 221 for 5, powered by Rajat Patidar ’s 64 off 32 and Virat Kohli’s brisk 67.Despite a strong fightback from MI’s middle order, Krunal’s late burst ensured RCB’s third win of the season.In a clash filled with emotion, power-hitting , and drama, it was Krunal Pandya’s icy composure and clutch bowling that settled the family feud — and the match.",Royal Challengers Bengaluru beat Mumbai Indians by 12 runs in IPL 2025.

Bombay Sport Exchange Ep. 2: GroupM's Vinit Karnik on IPL's growth and emerging sports

Mumbai: He may have only been at the Santiago Bernabeu for a season, but it was enough for Michael Owen to understand the weight of wearing the Real Madrid jersey. And when you join one of the most decorated football clubs in the world, comparisons with its past greats are inevitable, Owen says.That’s the moment Madrid’s superstar summer signing Kylian Mbappe is currently living. Having equalled his idol Cristiano Ronaldo ’s tally of 33 goals in his first season with the Madrid giants, the France captain has got his coach Carlo Ancelotti wishing Mbappe can go on to match the Portuguese great’s towering accomplishments at the club.“The thing with Real Madrid, of course, is everybody compares you to greats of the past and you almost have to win virtually every trophy just to keep up with the demand and the expectation,” Owen said ahead of the ‘Legends Faceoff’ fixture in Mumbai on Sunday.“(With) Real Madrid winning the league, winning Champions Leagues in recent years, if Mbappe then turns up and they don’t have a good season, everybody blames him. That is an incredible pressure because they were winning before. I’m sure they will continue to be successful as well, but I think he’s done very well.“He is one of the most destructive players on the planet. He’s quick, he’s got great touch, he can score great goals, so I always thought it was going to be a great signing.”The former England international also analysed how football has evolved over the years, particularly the role of the number 9.“Everybody had two strikers when I played professional football. Now hardly anybody does. Somebody like myself, I guess I don’t know where I would fit in in today’s game. Maybe I’d have to play in one of the wider areas, I don’t know. The profile of the striker has definitely changed,” Owen said.Many pundits and former players attribute this change to Pep Guardiola, whose breathtaking Barcelona team from 2008–2012 soon became a template which teams across Europe couldn’t resist copying. Owen joined the chorus who feel it has turned football into a monotonous watch.“Yeah, I do agree. Everybody sees a great manager and their success and feels as if they have to copy that. And certain players, certain teams are not really capable in many ways of it, yet they still play that way and give away goals. It doesn’t suit all players,” he said, also expressing concern over the decreasing number of footballing ‘geniuses’.“It’s a much more athletic game now. It’s as important to be a good runner than it is to have skill which was never ever the case. Those old maverick players, just genius types of players, they’re slowly disappearing from our game and now it’s about hard, fast stats and running stats. So it is changing but it’s fascinating and it will continue to change again.”A technically gifted striker with a great eye for goal during his prime, Owen, now 45, scored 16 goals from 45 games in the famous Los Blancos shirt, including one in a 4-2 El Clasico win against Barcelona at the Bernabeu.“I was fortunate that I played in virtually all of the big derbies in England, but I don’t think anything compares to El Clasico. As a one-off game. I think it’s the biggest.“Scoring and playing in front of your own crowds and winning a big game was probably my biggest and best memory of playing for Real Madrid,” said Owen who had the opportunity to relive those memories as he featured for the Real Madrid Legends side at DY Patil Stadium.",Michael Owen believes Real Madrid's Kylian Mbappe is one of the most destructive players on the planet.

When will CSK legend MS Dhoni retire from IPL? Astrologer Greenstone Lobo predicts

Chennai: For over a decade now, Manchester United have been a shadow of the indomitable force that they were under serial winner Alex Ferguson.The trophy cabinet has had to be opened only a few times since Ferguson’s departure in 2013 and United have constantly been playing catch-up in England. One player who saw the English Premier League outfit reach multiple troughs during his 12-year stint (2011 to 2023) was defender Phil Jones . The former England international crisply summed up how United’s stocks have fallen drastically over the years, saying that mid-table teams and relegation battlers in the EPL are no longer frightened when making the trip to the iconic Old Trafford .“Around 2011, when we were in the tunnel before playing matches against lower-ranked teams, we had won even before we walked out onto the pitch. They (opponents) were petrified playing at Old Trafford, you could see the fear in them. We have sort of lost that and that is where we need to get back to,” said Jones, who was in Chennai for the final of the third edition of Apollo Tyres ‘Road to Old Trafford’, a five-a-side tournament supported by United.While Jones acknowledged that there is heaps of work to be done for United to get back to the upper echelons, he backed manager Ruben Amorim to guide them to great heights. “Amorim should be given a long run. He has been brought in for the right reasons, to improve United. I love how honest and open he is. You can understand where he is coming from, he is not hiding anything. I really like that side of him,” Jones said of the Portuguese.“It is going to be difficult for Amorim.

When will CSK legend MS Dhoni retire from IPL? Astrologer Greenstone Lobo predicts

Bombay Sport Exchange Ep. 2: GroupM's Vinit Karnik on IPL's growth and emerging sports

“Watching KL Rahul bat is like sitting and watching paint dry on a wall,” Kevin Pietersen had once tweeted. And when Rahul cheekily brought up that old tweet after winning the Man of the Match award against Chennai Super Kings on Saturday, KP — now his team’s mentor — laughed: “Did I say that? Well, I’m glad you’ve changed your game.”Promoted at the eleventh hour to open after Faf du Plessis was ruled out due to an injury, adaptable craftsman KL Rahul produced a knock (77, 51b; 6x4, 3x6) of quiet finesse that became the centrepiece in Delhi Capitals ’ win at the MA Chidambaram Stadium.“Just at about 11 o’clock this morning when we found out that Faf would be doubtful, I had a chat with him saying, ‘KL, this is an option we’re looking at. How open are you?’ (Pat came the reply): ‘Happy, coach. I’m happy to go up the order.’ So it was as seamless as that,” said Delhi head coach Hemang Badani Rahul doesn’t seem to have a permanent slot in the batting line-up, either for India or for his franchise. The issue came up for discussion and Badani was adamant that it’s the right-hander’s ability to adapt that makes him such a flexible cricketer. “He’s somebody who’s been around long enough to understand the need of the hour. He has opened for India, he’s batted at four-five in the recently concluded Champions Trophy. And, he’s somebody who can play spin and pace well. I don’t think it’s difficult for someone of his calibre. If I had to make someone else do it, then it wouldn’t have been easy. But I think he has got the calibre, mindset and understanding of the game to go up the order par or bat at No. 4,” explained Badani .Opening is familiar ground for Rahul. It’s also where he’s faced the sharpest scrutiny for anchoring too much, for not keeping pace with the game. But there’s been a shift. At 32, Rahul seems determined to step out of the old template.“I worked really hard on my white-ball game in the last year or so. Big shout to Abhishek Nayar (current India assistant coach). I worked a lot with him, ever since he’s come into the Indian team. We spend hours and hours together talking about my white-ball game and how I can be better,” said Rahul, who last played a T20 international way back in 2022.Rahul also revealed that he has realised that T20 cricket has changed a lot and now he wants to just enjoy hitting boundaries. “I think somewhere I found the fun playing white-ball cricket, I think somewhere along the way I lost that fun of hitting boundaries and hitting sixes. I wanted to take the game ‘deep, deep, deep’ and that somehow stuck in my head. So back to enjoying my cricket. Just see the ball and try to be aggressive.”From “paint dry” to powerplay disruptor, Rahul, who is now also embracing fatherhood, played with intent, fluency and adaptability against CSK. His strike rate? A healthy 150. This wasn’t Rahul rebranding himself. It was more like the beginning of a new KL Rahul in T20 cricket.","KL Rahul was promoted to open for Delhi Capitals after Faf du Plessis was ruled out due to an injury.

Panaji: At a time when Indian football is making news for the wrong reasons, here’s another unwanted first for the sport in the country.The I-League , Indian football’s second-tier club competition run by the All India Football Federation (AIFF), saw high-intensity contests on the concluding day, but there was no champion.As things stand, Churchill Brothers finished on top with 40 points, one more than second-placed Inter Kashi (39). Ideally, they should have been crowned champions, but with Kashi scoring twice in stoppage time to edge past Rajasthan United 3-1 at home, they are also in contention for the top spot, and consequently a place in next season’s Indian Super League (ISL).Kashi were awarded three points by the AIFF disciplinary committee after Namdhari were found to have fielded an ineligible player. That decision was challenged and later stayed by the appeals committee, with the next hearing scheduled for April 28. Should the appeals committee decide that the forfeiture stands, Kashi will move on top with 42 points.“While the draw against Real Kashmir keeps Churchill Brothers at the top of the table, they must await the result of the AIFF Appeals Committee ’s hearing,” the AIFF said in its official report. Till then, no team can celebrate.When the referee blew the final whistle in Srinagar after Churchill were held 1-1 by Real Kashmir, some of the visiting players fell to the ground, knowing they had blown away a chance to win the title outright, without waiting for the appeals committee verdict.The Alemao family, out there in full force, were celebrating right in the middle of the field, only to be later greeted by a post from AIFF which said, “@churchillbrothersfcgoa provisionally finish top of the #ILeague table!”","Real Kashmir play out 1-1 draw with Churchill Brothers to close I-League season.

Saints demise

Liverpool slumped to just their second Premier League defeat this season as Fulham clinched a shock 3-2 win over the runaway leaders, while Southampton were relegated in record-setting time after a 3-1 loss at Tottenham on Sunday.The drama at Craven Cottage and Tottenham overshadowed a drab 0-0 draw between Manchester United and Manchester City Arsenal's 1-1 draw at Everton on Saturday left Liverpool needing just 11 points to secure a record-equalling 20th English top-flight title.Arne Slot's men were unbeaten in 26 league games and looked set to take another step towards the title when Alexis Mac Allister's stunning strike opened the scoring.But poor defending allowed Ryan Sessegnon, Alex Iwobi and Rodrigo Muniz to turn the game around for Fulham.The Reds appear to be running out of steam after challenging in four competitions for most of Slot's largely impressive first season since replacing Jurgen Klopp.But Liverpool are still almost certain to win their first title since 2020 with only seven games remaining for second-placed Arsenal to catch them.After a Champions League exit to Paris Saint-Germain and League Cup final defeat to Newcastle, Liverpool edged Everton 1-0 in a feisty Merseyside derby on Wednesday to get back to winning ways.However, their lethargic effort against Fulham might delay the title party for a little while longer.""In general we are not making many of these errors, let alone three in one game,"" Slot said.""People want to make stories which is their job. Many teams find it difficult to play Fulham. The second half performance was outstanding. We had chances but in the end we lacked time.""In north London, Brennan Johnson struck twice in the first half and Mateus Fernandes' late reply was too late to stop bottom-of-the-table Southampton crashing back to the Championship.Beaten for the 25th time in 31 games, Southampton are the first Premier League team to be relegated with seven matches still to play.Ipswich and Derby were relegated with six games left in 1994-95 and 2007-08 respectively.Ivan Juric's side are also still one shy of matching Derby's 2007-08 record low Premier League total points of 11.Juric, whose team are without a win in their last seven league matches, admitted this week that avoiding the record low points tally is Southampton's only target for the rest of their dismal season.""We have to avoid that record. Do our best. It cannot happen,"" Juric said.Southampton were pushed to the brink of relegation when fourth-bottom Wolves came from behind to beat Ipswich 2-1 on Saturday, leaving Saints 22 points from safety.Their slide down to the second tier was confirmed 315 days after they clinched promotion by beating Leeds in the Championship play-off final at Wembley.""It's a difficult day, a tough day but I see the fans, how they love their players and their team. It's something incredible. This experience has to serve to create something stronger than this,"" Juric said.Tottenham have been in turmoil themselves for much of the season, with fan protests against chairman Daniel Levy before and during the game underlining the depth of the problems in north London.But under-fire boss Ange Postecoglou, who was jeered by Tottenham fans during Thursday's defeat at Chelsea, earned a little breathing space thanks to a first win in five league games.Manchester City missed a chance to climb into fourth place after a dour derby stalemate at Old Trafford.Pep Guardiola's side remain fifth, which is likely to be the final place that brings qualification for next season's Champions League.But City have only a one-point advantage over sixth-placed Aston Villa and are just two points ahead of seventh-placed Newcastle, who have two games in hand.Cole Palmer was left on the bench for almost an hour as fourth-placed Chelsea's winless run on the road continued with a 0-0 draw at Brentford.Blues boss Enzo Maresca raised eyebrows by dropping England forward Palmer despite his side's battle to qualify for the Champions League.Chelsea have a UEFA Conference League quarter-final trip to Legia Warsaw on Thursday, but Maresca's priorities were questioned following the Blues' insipid display.",Liverpool slump to just their second Premier League defeat this season.

Mohammedan Sporting Club could lose their spot in the Indian Super League (ISL) if they are unable to convince the organisers that they are financially stable and can provide a “complete and final statement” of all outstanding dues for the 2024-25 season.In an official letter sent to the Kolkata-based club on Saturday, Rochak Langer, COO for Football Sports Development Limited ( FSDL ), the body that owns and operates the ISL, raised serious concerns over the club’s failure to provide a statement of outstanding dues, including both operational costs and player-related payments.FSDL has also been told by Mohammedan Sporting’s investors, Sharachi Sports, that they are withdrawing due to differences with both the club and Bunkerhill, a Gurgaon-based sports management company that invested in the club but is in a tussle over the transfer of majority shares.The club has been given time till April 11 to file a detailed reply, failing which the organisers will consider “further actions, including termination of participation in the ISL, in accordance with the terms of the Participation Agreement.”FSDL has reminded Mohammedan Sporting that financial stability is one of the fundamental requirements for participation in ISL.“The imminent withdrawal of your key investor raises serious concerns about the club’s ability to meet the operational expenses for running the team,” Langer wrote to CEO Rajat Mishra and general secretary Ishtiaque Ahmed.“It is disturbing that Mohammedan Sporting failed to disclose any ongoing differences with Shrachi Sports during its active playing phase of the ISL, and this has come to light only after your team has failed to qualify for the playoffs. In the absence of transparency and timely disclosures, we are left to question whether this information was intentionally withheld till now since it would no longer affect your team’s participation this season,” FSDL added.According to sources, Mohammedan Sporting are yet to a provide bank guarantee as required under the participation agreement. The definitive share subscription and shareholders agreement with investors is also pending.Mohammedan Sporting, who won the I-League last season and were promoted to the ISL on sporting merit, were allowed to participate after indicating that they have secured the backing of Shrachi Sports as a key investor, as evident from a MOU dated August 28, 2024.The club, though, has faced financial problems all through the season with players even boycotting training as a mark of protest over unpaid dues. Head coach Andrey Chernyshov also quit midway after not being paid for several months. “As a professional, I cannot work for three months without receiving a salary,” he wrote in a message on social media.In their debut season in the ISL, Mohammedan Sporting finished at the bottom of the table, winning just two of their 24 league matches.","Mohammedan Sporting Club could lose their spot in the Indian Super League (ISL) if they are unable to convince the organisers that they are financially stable.

Navi Mumbai: 2-0 it finished to Real Madrid Legends at the DY Patil Stadium on Sunday, a small feel-good win for the Los Blancos stars of yesteryear, seeing as El Clasico , otherwise, hasn’t been too kind to Real Madrid of late.A delightful chip with the outside of his boot saw former Ballon d’Or winner Luis Figo create the opening goal for Madrid, neatly finished by Fernando Morientes. In the second half, David Barral seized his moment to beat a couple of Barcelona defenders and tap home.But this ‘Legends Faceoff’ wasn’t about the result, even if the thousands of Madrid fans among the crowd might strongly disagree. This was an exhibition game meant to give football fans here a just a small bite of the most storied rivalry in club football across the world.And for most of them, seeing Luis Figo dance past defenders like it were 2001, seeing Xavi looking to thread the ball through to Rivaldo and Patrick Kluivert, seeing Pepe thwart a Barcelona attack, or seeing Carles Puyol, his curly locks flying about in the humid Navi Mumbai air, try to rally his teammates, was a fulfilling experience in itself.Even Mumbai City captain and India international Lallianzuala Chhangte, who watched the game from the press box with a couple of his club teammates, was left in awe. “Xavi is just wow, the way he glances over his shoulder to check where he should be. These are things sadly they don’t teach us here,” the winger remarked.Shortly after the full-time whistle blew, a few ambitious fans weren’t quite ready to accept that the evening was done. One young boy channelled his inner-Figo and tried desperately to skip his way past security and get closer to the players.

NEW DELHI: Jannik Sinner , the three-time Grand Slam champion , received a three-month ban after testing positive twice for the banned substance clostebol .The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) agreed to the ban after Sinner admitted ""partial responsibility"" for team mistakes.Umberto Ferrara , Sinner's former physical trainer, has spoken publicly about the scandal for the first time. He claims to be blameless and places the responsibility squarely on Sinner's former physiotherapist, Giacomo Naldi .""I was perfectly aware that it was banned so I always kept it safely stashed away in my wash bag. I suggested to Naldi to use it for a cut which had not healed and was affecting his work. I was absolutely clear when I spoke to him about the nature of the product and it was imperative it never came into contact with Jannik. In effect I told him to use it only in my bathroom. Naldi did not deny he had been told, but he said he could not recall,"" he told Gazzetta dello Sport.Ferrara states that he had been using a spray containing clostebol, prescribed by a doctor for an illness, and had kept it safely stored away.He suggested that Naldi use the spray for a cut that was not healing, but explicitly warned him to use it only in Ferrara's bathroom and to ensure it never came into contact with Sinner.According to Ferrara, Naldi did not deny being warned about the nature of the product but claimed he could not recall the instructions.Ferrara alleges that Naldi treated Sinner without gloves and without washing his hands after using the spray, despite the warnings.Ferrara acknowledges that, in hindsight, he would not have handled the situation the same way. He expresses regret over the behavior of others and claims to have suffered due to the ""bad faith of some.""Sinner's suspension ends on May 4, allowing him to return in time for the French Open.

This victory marks Sabalenka's second title of 2025, following her Brisbane triumph in January, and her eighth WTA 1000 title overall.Sabalenka, who had recently lost the Indian Wells final to Russian teenager Mirra Andreeva, showed determination not to repeat that outcome in Miami.""I'm super happy to have this trophy, I was able to play my best tennis in the final,"" said Sabalenka, acknowledging Pegula's performance and referencing their previous encounter at the US Open final.The first set was marked by service struggles, featuring seven breaks of serve. Pegula challenged Sabalenka by drawing her to the net, but the momentum shifted when Pegula served at 6-5 down.Sabalenka secured the first set with a combination of a delicate forehand drop and a down-the-line winner.Despite losing her first service game in the second set, Sabalenka quickly regained control. She broke twice to establish a 3-1 lead and maintained her dominance to complete the victory in one hour and 27 minutes.""I think I was able to completely forget about (it being) the final, about the outside things and I was just so focused on the game,"" Sabalenka reflected.The Belarusian has won 12 of her last 14 matches against top 10 players, attributing her success to her performance in crucial moments.""It is all about those key moments of the match, about playing aggressive and staying with the game plan, going for shots without being afraid of losing the point,"" she explained.This marked Pegula's third loss to Sabalenka in a final. The American acknowledged Sabalenka's superiority on hard courts.""I consider myself one of the world's best hard-court players, but she's probably the best,"" Pegula stated after the match.""She just keeps ... raising her level in key moments of the match when she needs to, and I feel like that was the big difference today and the last few times I have played her,"" Pegula added.Despite the loss, Pegula expressed satisfaction with her tournament performance: ""Happy to be in another big 1000 final and having consistent results and keep going deep in tournaments. The reason we play is to put ourselves in good chances to win these events. I was able to do that the last couple weeks.""At 26, Sabalenka has accumulated 19 WTA Tour titles, with 17 on hard courts, including three Grand Slam singles titles - the 2023 Australian Open, 2024 Australian Open, and 2024 US Open.Sabalenka's on-court demeanour has evolved from her earlier years, showing more composure during challenging moments.""I think before, every time I would lose my serve, one game, I could just completely lose the match because I would still be thinking about that first game,"" she reflected.Sabalenka credited her past serving challenges for developing a stronger overall game and mental approach.""When I was struggling with my serve I had to push myself on the return and had to play with something else. So now, every time I am losing (serve) I know that I have weapons, that I can return well and that I can break back,"" she said.""I think that challenge really helped me to be more focused and not get too crazy on court after losing a game on my serve,"" she added.The Miami Open men's final is scheduled for Sunday, featuring Novak Djokovic against Czech teenager Jakub Mensik, with Djokovic pursuing his 100th professional title.","Aryna Sabalenka beats Jessica Pegula 7-5 6-2 in the final of the Miami Open. It is the Belarusian's second title of 2025, and her eighth WTA 1000 title overall. This marked Pegula's third loss to Sabalenska in a final.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119739671,imgsize-41430,width-400,resizemode-4/119739671.jpg"

Football superstar and Argentina's World Cup-winning captain Lionel Messi was in attendance at the Hard Rock Stadium on Friday, where Novak Djokovic advanced to the Miami Open final with a commanding victory over 14th-seeded Grigor DimitrovIn pursuit of his 100th singles title, and seventh in Miami, Djokovic won 6-2, 6-3 and will face upstart Jakub Mensik, who upset Taylor Fritz 7-6 (7-4), 4-6, 7-6 (7-4) in the other semfinial, for the title.During his post-match court interview, Djokovic recognised that Messi, who currently represents Inter Miami in Major League Soccer, was present, referring to him as ""King Leo.""Djokovic revealed that Messi, accompanied by his wife and children, visited the locker room where they exchanged presents. While Djokovic had previously attended Messi's matches, this marked the first occasion where the football star watched him play.""Obviously, it's a thrill to have his whole family,'' Djokovic said. ""It's a huge honour. He's such a great athlete, not just a football player. His impact on the world of sports in the last 20 years has been immense.""To have him watch me live brings me great joy and excitement and also a little pressure. It's definitely different when he brings his family. I was touched by that.""The 37-year-old Djokovic's performance hasn't been up to his lofty standards, beginning with a withdrawal due to injury at the Australian Open in January. At Indian Wells earlier this month, he suffered a first-round defeat against Botic van de Zandschulp.During the third game, play was halted when security personnel escorted a disruptive spectator from the venue. The chair umpire descended from his position and approached the stands while summoning security staff.Dimitrov engaged in a verbal exchange with the spectator and proceeded to direct the umpire's attention to the location of the troublesome fan at the sideline.""It's just heckling, it's fine,'' Dimitrov said. ""I'm a very calm guy overall. I don't pick any fights but don't trigger me.''Despite Dimitrov securing an early break against Djokovic in the opening game, the Serbian regained composure and secured the first set in 32 minutes.The current men's record holder of 24 Grand Slam titles displayed remarkable serving efficiency, landing 87% of first serves with merely six misses throughout the match. He maintained exceptional control, recording only five unforced errors during the 70-minute contest.""Now I know how it feels to be (John) Isner and (Reilly) Opelka,'' Djokovic said of two serving behemoths. ""Maybe my serve has been a bit underrated.""Djokovic extended his dominant head-to-head record against Dimitrov to 13-1. The Bulgarian player showcased his finest performance during the match.""He wears confidence like a stain on your shirt,'' Dimitrov said. ""It's beautiful to see. Only a few athletes on earth possess that quality.''Mensik, who entered the Miami Open as world number 54, has yet to reach a final in an ATP 1,000-point tournament.In a crucial moment against Fritz, he displayed remarkable composure at 4-4 in the final tiebreaker, securing victory by winning three consecutive points.Throughout the match lasting two hours and 25 minutes, Mensik failed to break serve but managed to win with a brilliant backhand winner down the line at 5-4. Fritz subsequently lost the next two points, sending a forehand long after a 20-shot exchange and netting a forehand on match point.Prior to the match, Mensik had a handshake with Messi. ""I didn't wash my hands before I stepped on the court,"" Mensik said.Tennis inspiration came to Mensik through Djokovic, whom he faced in a three-set match at the Shanghai Masters last October. The age difference between them stands at 18 years.","Novak Djokovic beats Grigor Dimitrov 6-2, 6-3 to reach Miami Open final. Serbian will face Jakub Mensik, who beat Taylor Fritz 7-6 (7-4), 4-6, 7-4.

Teenage tennis sensation Alexandra Eala maintained remarkable composure after delivering one of the WTA season's biggest upsets. The Filipina displayed minimal emotion after breaking world number two Iga Swiatek 's serve for the eighth time to advance to the Miami Open semi-finals.Despite her face momentarily quivering on the verge of tears following her victory, Eala remained composed. She celebrated modestly and proceeded with her post-match responsibilities with professional poise.""I think I was so in the moment, and I made it a point to be in the moment every point that it's hard to realise what just happened. It's hard to realise that you won the match,"" she explained, when asked about her immediate emotions to beating the five-time grand slam winner.""I really tried to soak it all in, because this has never happened to me before, and that's why I was looking at the screen. You know, I really wanted to keep that moment in my mind.""Eala exhibited remarkable poise in the biggest match of her WTA Tour career, showcasing excellent preparation despite her limited experience.""I don't have a lot of experience on the WTA Tour, that's for sure, but I do have experience with compartmentalising. I have experience with being professional.""""I have no hesitation to bring that part of me out when I'm on court and when I'm in a setting that calls for professionalism.""Eala's professional journey began at age 13 when she left the Philippines to join Rafael Nadal's academy in Mallorca. She has spent six years immersed in tennis, training alongside top coaches and aspiring tour players.Her disciplined approach stems more from family influence than her academy training.""It's not something I learned in the academy. It's something I've gotten from, I guess, from my experience as the things I have been through leading up to this moment. It's also something my family has guided me through, it's part of my family's values.""""They are successful people in business, they are successful in their own fields and people I look up to. I think they lead by example when it comes to that.""The match drew special supporters to her box. Her parents traveled from the Philippines, accompanied by an uncle and cousin from Seattle. Toni Nadal , Rafael's uncle and former coach, represented the academy.""So a lot of extra motivation for my match today. I really wanted to have my family see me winning, but I know they'd be happy just to see me compete in this setting.""""And Toni also came in to Miami. That did mean a lot, because I have been working closely with him for so long, alongside my main coaches from the academy, it showed a lot about the confidence and the pride the academy has in me.""Eala recalled a previous photograph with Swiatek at an academy graduation event two years ago. She expressed hope that her victory would inspire young people in the Philippines to pursue tennis.The 19-year-old from Quezon City joins a list of teenagers who have made dramatic entrances into WTA elite competition.

Miami Gardens: Alexandra Eala , a 19-year-old wildcard from the Philippines, produced a huge upset at the Miami Open on Wednesday, defeating world number two Iga Swiatek 6-2 7-5 to reach the semi-finals.Ranked 140th in the world, Eala, the first woman from her country to reach the last eight of a WTA 1000 tournament, took advantage of a unusually poor display from Swiatek, keeping her focus as she fought back from 4-2 down in the second set.Eala broke the Pole for the eighth and final time when Swiatek was serving to stay in the match at 6-5 down in the second set and looked stunned as she struggled to contain her emotions.""I'm just in disbelief right now. It's so surreal,"" she said on court.""I'm so happy and so blessed to be able to compete with such a player on this stage,"" said Eala, who has now beaten three grand slam winners on her route to the last four at Miami -- having dealt with Jelena Ostapenko and Madison Keys before upsetting four-time French Open champion Swiatek.""I'm trusting my shots and I have a great team to tell me that I can do it,"" she said.Eala moved to Spain at the age of 13 to join Rafael Nadal's academy in Mallorca and Toni Nadal, the Spaniard's uncle and former coach, was in her box for the match.""It meant a lot that he showed up here.

World number one Aryna Sabalenka fought back in the second set to secure her spot in the semi-finals of the Miami Open , defeating China's Zheng Qinwen 6-2, 7-5 on Tuesday.This win marks Sabalenka’s first appearance in the semi-finals in Miami, where she’ll meet Italy's Jasmine Paolini for a chance to reach the final.It seemed like a straightforward match for the Belarusian against the ninth seed Zheng as she easily took the first set. However, Zheng made adjustments and came out strong in the second set, breaking Sabalenka twice to establish a 4-2 lead.Sabalenka faced significant pressure at 0-40 but, after showing some frustration, rallied to hold serve and tie it at 4-4. She then unleashed a powerful finish, breaking Zheng again to lead 6-5 and serving confidently to clinch the match.""Honestly every match is tough against her, I always have to work really hard to get the win and today was an incredible level from both of us,"" said Sabalenka.""I'm super happy to get this win.

CHENNAI: Sankar Muthusamy recorded the biggest win of his nascent career yet, defeating World No. 2 Anders Antonsen of Denmark 18-21, 21-12, 21-5 in the Swiss Open men’s singles pre-quarterfinals in Basel late on Thursday.What surprised many was the way in which the Indian dominated the deciding game. Despite losing the opener, the 21-year-old did not give up and pushed the match to the decider. He was helped by a flurry of unforced errors that Antonsen committed — the Dane hitting the shuttle wide and long on multiple occasions. Sankar made the most of the opportunity and succeeded.The Chennai lad entered the tournament as a qualifier and registered two wins to enter the main draw.“It feels good, and I have been doing well in this tournament. The first game (against Antonsen) lasted for close to 30 minutes and I feel that he became tired after that. I was able to score points from long rallies and capitalised on the situation. I was focusing on one point at a time and did not think much about the result,” Sankar, ranked 64th, told TOI from Basel.“In the deciding game, I was just expecting him to come back at me and was ready to handle the situation. My aim was to move him around the court and make him tired.”Sankar, who was a former junior World No. 1, lacked consistency in the 2024 season due to various reasons. However, he started the 2025 season on a bright note, reaching the quarterfinals of the Thailand Masters. He was later down with fever and could not give his best in the next few tournaments. However, Sankar recovered well ahead of the Swiss Open.The youngster, who is known for his defensive play, has improved his attacking skills and stroke-making.“My strokes have become sharper than usual, and I am able to finish off points from the rear court. My power is gradually increasing, and I am working on it. There is still a long way to go,” he said.Sankar’s long-time coach Aravindan Samiappan said that the win has come at the right time for his ward.“The moment has not sunk in properly. Sankar was an underdog and had nothing to lose. Our plan was to stay neck-to-neck on points and towards the end anything could have happened. But none would have expected such a scoreline in the decider. It was a bit shocking but that happens sometimes,” Aravindan said.The coach feels that opponents can no longer come prepared for Sankar, as he lends unpredictability into his game now.“Sankar can vary the pace of the match whenever required, and this was not the case one and a half years ago. Players could anticipate what he was going to do, as he played at a single pace. Now, you cannot predict him, and that is the major difference in his gameplay,” pointed out the coach.","Sankar Muthusamy defeated World No. 2 Anders Antonsen of Denmark 18-21, 21-12,. 21-5 in the Swiss Open men’s singles pre-quarterfinals in Basel late on Thursday.

A day after dethroning reigning champion Jonatan Christie , Lakshya Sen faltered against Li Shi Feng of China 10-21, 16-21 in the men’s singles quarterfinals of the All England Championships in Birmingham on Friday.Soon after, the Indian challenge ended as the women’s doubles pair of Treesa Jolly and Gayatri Gopichand lost to Chinese second seeds Liu Sheng Shu and Tan Ning 14-21, 10-21.Given his 7-4 win-loss record and having won the last two matches against Li last year, Lakshya was expected to fare well in the quarterfinals. But the Indian was a pale shadow of the shuttler on show against Christie.From 4-4, Li widened the gap. He scored eight points on the trot and Lakshya was out of the first game even before he had warmed up.Emboldened by the easy victory in the first game, Li started on an aggressive note while Lakshya crawled his way back. With good netplay and by pushing the shuttle to the corners with good effect, Lakshya secured a crucial three-point lead (11-8) at the halfway stage. However, Li toned down his aggression and scored the next four points by engaging the Indian in long rallies, mostly close to the net. It was anybody’s game till 15-15.Thereafter, Li came up with two smash winners and a lucky net drop to widen the gap to 19-15. Li produced 10 smash winners in the second game to silence Lakshya.The 87-minute three-game second round contest against Koreans Kim Hye Jeong and Kong Hee Yong, late on Thursday affected TreesaGayatri, who had only 14 hours to recover for the quarterfinal.Though they led 10-7 at one stage the duo struggled to move well on the court. The Chinese took off from 7-10 and won 14 of the next 18 points to pocket the first game. In the second game they were even more dominant. “We were slow on the court today. Maybe the long match late last night affected us a bit,” Gayatri said after the match. Chirag Shetty who injured his back in the second round is travelling back to India. The extent of his injury will be known after the MRI scan.","Lakshya Sen loses to Li Shi Feng of China 10-21, 16-21 in the men's singles quarterfinals of the All England Championships.

NEW DELHI: India's Lakshya Sen exited the All England Badminton Championships following a straight-game defeat to Chinese world No. 6 Li Shi Feng in the men's singles quarterfinals on Friday. The 2022 finalist, who narrowly missed an Olympic medal in Paris last year, was outplayed 10-21, 16-21 in a 45-minute encounter.Ranked world No. 15, Sen had won his last two encounters against Li, including at the Thomas Cup. However, this time, he struggled against his familiar Chinese rival from the junior class of 2018.Feng dominated early, wrapping up the first game in just 17 minutes. Playing with composure and avoiding unnecessary risks, he surged to a 9-4 lead with a powerful smash and entered the break with an 11-4 advantage. Sen's unsuccessful review left him trailing 4-12, but a brief resurgence saw him reduce the deficit to 7-12 with a sharp cross-court smash. Yet, Feng quickly adjusted, mixing up his pace and tactics to clinch the game.Sen showed improvement in the second game but couldn't match Feng's consistency. Trailing 2-5 initially, Sen fought back with better net play, taking a 10-8 lead after a grueling 37-shot rally. He maintained a slender three-point lead at the break and fought hard in a tight contest, with a marathon 44-shot exchange tying the score at 14-all. However, Feng's aggression proved decisive as he surged ahead 17-15 with a powerful smash.At 15-18, Sen suffered finger bruises, spilling blood on the court and requiring medical attention, leading to a brief stoppage. However, the break did little to disrupt Feng's momentum as he sealed the match with another thunderous smash.Despite the loss, Sen's campaign was commendable, highlighted by his stunning straight-game victory over defending champion Jonatan Christie, avenging his semifinal defeat to the Indonesian last year.With this win, Feng advances to the semifinals to face the winner between top seed Shi Yu Qi and Singapore's Loh Kean Yew.Meanwhile, India's doubles duo Satwiksairaj Rankireddy and Chirag Shetty withdrew due to injury, Malvika Bansod bowed out in women's singles, and the mixed doubles pair of Rohan Kapoor and Ruthvika Shivani Gadde also fell short.","Lakshya Sen loses 10-21, 16-21 to Chinese world No. 6 Li Shi Feng.

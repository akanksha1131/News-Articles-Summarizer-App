MI Cape Town 's (MICT) all-round display on Wednesday evening in Newlands booked their maiden appearance in the SA20 Playoffs with a dominant 10-wicket win over Sunrisers Eastern Cape (SEC).After all-rounder Corbin Bosch (4 for 19) and Kagiso Rabada (2 for 14) combined to bowl out SEC for just 107, Ryan Rickelton smashed a half-century (59* off 36 balls) and took the team home alongside fellow opener Rassie van der Dussen (48* off 30) for a commanding victory without losing a wicket.The win confirmed MICT a spot in Qualifier 1 against current table-toppers Paarl Royals in Gqeberha on February 4, with the winner of the match entering the final.MICT's brilliant bowling display was aided by some excellent catching from Dewald Brevis, Bosch and Reeza Hendricks -- highlighted by Brevis's one-handed screamer at the edge of the boundary.Bedingham's determined effort of a run-a-ball 45 kept the Sunrisers in contention, but he lacked adequate backing from his partners at the opposite end.In the end, Andile Simelane's 21 runs off 22 balls helped to push the SEC total past the hundred-run mark.The Sunrisers now face a must-win game against Paarl Royals on Saturday to secure a place in the playoffs.""(Fielding) is very important especially in this format...I feel the effort you put in fielding is very important. It put us ahead in the game...It was important to finish with the bonus point and in top two,"" said MICT captain Rashid Khan after the match.","MI Cape Town (MICT) booked their maiden appearance in the SA20 Playoffs with a dominant 10-wicket win over Sunrisers Eastern Cape (SEC) The win confirmed MICT a spot in Qualifier 1 against current table-toppers Paarl Royals in Gqeberha on February 4, with the winner of the match entering the final.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117713573,imgsize-57116,width-400,resizemode-4/117713573.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Following one of the most highly anticipated clashes of Round 10, India’s Gukesh Dommaraju maintained his lead at the top of the Masters leaderboard at the 2025 Tata Steel Chess Tournament , defeating Dutchman Max Warmerdam on his home soil in Wijk aan Zee on Wednesday.Defending with the black pieces, Gukesh responded to the King’s Pawn Opening with an out-of-the-box Pirc Defense. Showing early aggression, the youngest-ever World Chess Champion captured Warmerdam’s first piece, the Queen’s Pawn, with Cxd4.With the Chennai-born grandmaster maintaining his aggressive stance, continued pressure from his pieces ultimately provoked a blunder from the 24-year-old Dutchman.As Gukesh captured Warmerdam’s rook with Qxc8 on move 27, Warmerdam, in a desperate attempt to attack Gukesh’s queen, played Rc1.The advantage was now entirely in Gukesh’s hands, and he capitalised immediately, playing Nxg3 on move 30. With no escape from the mounting pressure, Warmerdam resigned, sealing Gukesh’s second consecutive win in the 87th edition of the ""Wimbledon of Chess"".The game between Slovenia’s Vladimir Fedoseev and Praggnanandhaa Rameshbabu was another thriller. One of the tournament’s most formidable, in-form players, Fedoseev had already defeated Arjun Erigaisi, Fabiano Caruana, Vincent Keymer, and Pentala Harikrishna, suffering only one loss — to Alexey Sarana — before facing Praggnanandhaa in this Round 10 matchup.An unconventional Tarrasch Defense with the Two Knights Variation saw Fedoseev, defending with black, deploy his pieces in an early offensive.However, as he concentrated on stacking up his pieces on the left side of the board, Praggnanandhaa remained composed, refraining from an overzealous push and ensuring he retained the upper hand.With the queens traded off by move 36, Praggnanandhaa delivered a decisive rook check before successfully promoting his d8 pawn to a queen.With that, the game was effectively over, giving the Indian grandmaster a much-needed victory after his crushing defeat to Dutch No. 1 Anish Giri on Tuesday.Elsewhere, Arjun Erigaisi mounted a recovery with a much-needed draw against Germany’s Vincent Keymer, while last year’s Challengers winner, Leon Luke Mendonca, held off Giri in a 30-move battle.Meanwhile, Nodirbek Abdusattorov, Gukesh’s closest rival in the standings, secured a crucial win over Alexey Sarana with the white pieces. Pentala Harikrishna and Fabiano Caruana, after a gruelling 68-move duel, agreed to a draw.ALSO SEE: Tata Steel Chess 2025 Schedule In the Challengers section, it was a tough day for the Indian contingent as Vaishali Rameshbabu and Divya Deshmukh both suffered defeats, losing to table-topper Thai Dai Van Nguyen and Frederik Svane, respectively.39-year-old Erwin l’Ami edged past 11-year-old Argentine sensation Faustino Oro in a hard-fought game, while China's 14-year-old Lu Miaoyi played to a draw against Türkiye’s formidable Ediz Gurel.ALSO READ: India to host FIDE Chess World Cup 2025; Arjuna Awardee 'surprised' at the move",India’s Gukesh Dommaraju maintained his lead at the top of the Masters leaderboard at the 2025 Tata Steel Chess Tournament.

The Desert Vipers reclaimed their position at the summit of the points table through a convincing five-wicket win over the Gulf Giants at the Dubai International Stadium on Wednesday, assuring themselves of a top-two finish in the league stage of this ILT20 season. Max Holden controlled the below-par chase of Giants' 129 for 8 with a knock of 70 runs from 54 balls, after three-wicket hauls from Wanindu Hasaranga (3 for 10) and Sam Curran (3 for 28) helped the Vipers restrict the opposition to a low total.If it wasn't for Tom Curran's late onslaught with a quickfire 64 off 34 balls, the Giants' innings may not have reached the three-figure mark.The Vipers' chase faced early setbacks during the powerplay, losing both the opening batsmen. Mark Adair dismissed Alex Hales (9) while Blessing Muzarabani claimed Fakhar Zaman's (14) wicket in the first four overs, with the Vipers reaching 42 for 2 in Powerplay.Holden then stitched a 45-run partnership Sam Curran (16 off 19) until James Vince took a brilliant catch off Muzarabani (3 for 25) to dismiss Curran.Holden reached his half-century off 42 balls, striking 6 fours and 1 six. His unbroken 32-run partnership with Adam Hose (12*) in the end ensured a convincing win with an over to spare.Earlier, the Giants' innings never got settled amid regular fall of wickets, scoring just 31 runs in the Powerplay after losing opener James Vince for 15.Hasaranga proved devastating with the ball, dismantling the Giants' top order. He claimed Tom Alsop for 17, before trapping Jordan Cox LBW for only three.The Giants found themselves at 44 for 4 midway through their innings.The Giants were in serious trouble, but Tom Curran provided resistance with an impressive 30-ball half-century and added 14 more runs in the final over, helping his team cross the 125-run mark.","The Desert Vipers reclaimed their position at the summit of the points table through a convincing five-wicket win over the Gulf Giants.

Stuart Broad on India's challenge in the Champions Trophy

NEW DELHI: The Niranjan Shah Stadium in Rajkot erupted in loud cheers as India skipper Suryakumar Yadav walked out for the toss.

India opted to bowl first against England in the third T20I.Shami's return to international cricket after 14 months was highly anticipated, but the outing didn’t go as he would have hoped.Sidelined since the ODI World Cup 2023 final against Australia, Shami had played domestic cricket in the interim, but this was his first game for India since then.Also See: ICC Champions Trophy 2025 Renowned for rattling stumps, Shami looked rusty in his comeback match.

WHY NODIRBEK DIDN’T SHAKE HANDS WITH VAISHALI

NEW DELHI: Hungarian-American chess grandmaster Susan Polgar criticized Uzbekistan’s Nodirbek Yakubboev after he refused to shake hands with Indian GM R Vaishali during the 2025 Tata Steel Chess tournament in the Netherlands.Yakubboev cited “religious reasons” for his decision, but Polgar challenged his stance by sharing a photo on social media showing him shaking hands with India’s Divya Deshmukh during the 29th Abu Dhabi International Chess Festival in 2023.“What is the difference?” Polgar questioned while tagging ChessBase India’s official handle.She further elaborated on her stance, stating that Yakubboev could have informed tournament officials or the female players in advance about his decision to avoid handshakes.“This is my opinion: I have less of an issue with the religious excuse. Others may disagree. But, he (Nodirbek Yakubboev) could have informed the organisers, chief arbiter, and/or his female opponents in advance. This is NOT an Open Swiss event. This is a prestigious invitational when he knew in advance that he would face 4 female opponents. If he wanted an exception then be proactive. Otherwise, he has to expect criticism,” she added.Nodirbek also addressed the issue on social media, explaining his reason for not shaking hands with Vaishali and apologising to the 23-year-old.“Dear chess friends, I want to explain the situation that happened in the game with Vaishali. With all due respect to women and Indian chess players , I want to inform everyone that I do not touch other women for religious reasons,” he had written on “X”.“I respect Vaishali and her brother as the strongest chess players in India. If I have offended her with my behavior, I apologize,” added Nodirbek.“I have some additional explanations: 1. Chess is not haram. 2. What I did before (referring to the game against Divya in 2023) I consider it wrong for me. I do what I need to do. I do not insist others not to shake hands with the opposite gender or for women to wear hijab or burqa. It is their business what to do.“Today I told Irina Bulmaga about it. She agreed to it. But when I came to the playing hall, the arbiters told me that I should at least do Namaste as a gesture. In the games with Divya and Vaishali I couldn’t tell them about it before the game and there was an awkward situation,” he concluded.","Nodirbek Yakubboev refused to shake hands with Indian GM R Vaishali during the 2025 Tata Steel Chess tournament in the Netherlands. He cited “religious reasons” for his decision, but Polgar challenged his stance by sharing a photo on social media showing him shaking hands with India’s Divya Deshmukh during the 29th Abu Dhabi International Chess Festival.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117667077,imgsize-45166,width-400,resizemode-4/117667077.jpg"

RAJKOT: First, the good news. Mohammed Shami made a decent, much-awaited return to international cricket after nearly 14 months, conceding 25 runs for no wickets in three overs and hitting a six towards the closing stages of the match. But it was Varun Chakravarthy who dominated the show, continuing to torment the Englishmen. The 'mystery spinner' took his maiden five-wicket haul in India (five for 24 in five overs).Now comes the bad news. Varun’s superb effort went in vain as India, batting poorly, were restricted by England’s much-improved bowlers to 146 for nine in 20 overs, losing by 26 runs to suffer their first defeat of the series in the third T20I at the Niranjan Shah Stadium here on Tuesday night.Given that the scoreline is 2-1 in favor of India now, England will look to equalise the score when they take on the hosts in the fourth T20I at Pune on Friday.Chasing 172, India lost wickets at regular intervals as England’s bowlers, led by Jamie Overton (3-23 in four overs), Jofra Archer (2-33), Brydon Carse (2-29), and leggie Adil Rashid (1-15 in four overs), who had earlier chipped in with a vital 10 not out, kept up the pressure.Enduring a poor series after smashing back-to-back centuries in South Africa, the inconsistent Sanju Samson (3) was caught at mid-on off Archer in the third over, while Abhishek Sharma (24, 14b, 5x4), who looked dangerous, was brilliantly caught by Archer, sprinting at cover, off Brydon Carse in the fourth over.India’s T20 skipper Suryakumar Yadav’s (14) poor run continued as he top-edged a pull off Mark Wood, with ‘keeper Phil Salt completing the catch, while the in-form Tilak Varma (17) was castled by a beauty of a leg-spinner from Rashid in the ninth over. Hardik Pandya (40, 35b, 1x4, 2x6) kept India in the game for a while, but was left throwing his bat in frustration after being caught by Overton at long-off.India’s strategy of playing four spinners in a T20 match backfired badly on the night. While Varun toyed with England’s batters, Bishnoi went for 1-46 in four overs, and off-spinner Washington Sundar, who was out for 6 batting at No 6, conceded 15 in the only over he bowled.Earlier, succumbing to Varun’s bag of tricks, England, who were flying at 83 for one in nine overs, with opener Ben Duckett (51, 28b, 7x4, 2x6) and skipper Jos Buttler (24, 22b, 1x4, 1x6) going great guns, lost nine wickets for 64 runs in a space of just 49 balls to slip to 147 for nine by the 18th over.Coming on to bowl in the sixth over, Varun gave away just three runs as both Duckett, who stroked his second T20I half-century, and Buttler looked to play him cautiously. However, once Buttler gloved a reverse sweep behind off the spinner, the floodgates opened.After Axar Patel had Duckett mistiming a hit to cow corner and Brook (8), who is enduring a horror run in this series, was bowled while under-edging a sweep off Bishnoi (his first wicket of the series), Varun began to slice through the England batting.Breathing fire, he was on a hat-trick in the 14th over as England’s ‘keeper-bat Jamie Smith (6) dragged him down to cow corner, while Jamie Overton (0) lost his leg stump while trying to paddle the bowler, going too far across.Brydon Carse (3) staved off the hat-trick, but perished soon, mistiming a sweep to give Tilak Varma a catch at deep square leg. Two balls later, Jofra Archer (0) was castled by a beauty that skidded off the pitch.Just as England were looking in danger of not even lasting for their full quota of 20 overs, the visitors’ Nos 10 and 11, Adil Rashid (10 not out) and Mark Wood (10 not out), did extremely well to hold on for 17 balls, adding 24 crucial runs in a 10th-wicket partnership—England’s joint-second best in T20Is—to take the score to 171 for nine in 20 overs.After Suryakumar won the toss for the third successive time and put England in, Liam Livingstone (43, 24b, 5x6, 1x6) launched a blistering counterattack, slog-sweeping and pulling Bishnoi for three sixes in the 17th over.With England’s batters failing to read him and making it worse for themselves by trying to play across the line to him, Varun has now taken 10 wickets for just 85 runs in the series so far, at an average of 8.50 and an economy rate of 7.08.The tweaker is the first bowler to take 10 wickets in a bilateral T20I series between India and England. Have India missed a trick by not picking the 33-year-old for the Champions Trophy next month, even considering questions around his fielding?Since his comeback after three years in the wilderness last year, Varun has taken 27 wickets in 10 matches at an average of 11.00 and a strike rate of 8.8 (per wicket).Earlier, India rested left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh, giving Shami some game time at last.","Varun Chakravarthy took his maiden five-wicket haul in India (five for 24 in five overs) India lost wickets at regular intervals as England’s bowlers, led by Jamie Overton, Jofra Archer, Brydon Carse and Adil Rashid, kept up the pressure.

With the ICC Champions Trophy 2025 nearing, the official broadcasters in India, Star Sports , have released a promotional video featuring ex-India captain MS Dhoni In the video, Dhoni, who had led India to the Champions Trophy title in 2013, mentions how matches in the eight-team tournament will go to the knives edge, needing lots of ice to keep calm.Hilariously, as buckets of ice is poured over one of India's greatest captains, he then needs a Dhoni Refrigeration System (DRS), to stay cool when the pressure builds and intensity rises.Labelled 'Captain Cool', MS Dhoni steered India to their second Champions Trophy title in 2013 when they beat England in a closely-contested final.That win, in England and Wales, made Dhoni the first captain to win the T20 World Cup (2007), the ODI World Cup (2011) and Champions Trophy.Moving the clock forward, the upcoming ICC Champions Trophy is scheduled to be played in Pakistan, with India's matches to take place in the UAE, starting February 19.

Ranji Trophy: No let-up in Virat Kohli's intensity,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/ranji-trophy-no-let-up-in-virat-kohlis-intensity/articleshow/117716268.cms,"The

comeback match against Railways may not determine his international future, but

still arrived 90 minutes before the entire Delhi team & went through a rigorous day of preparation on match eve

TimesView Virat Kohli and other major stars playing in the Ranji Trophy is good news for the cricketers as well as Indian cricket. Provided they are rested after international duty, this should be the norm, not an exception.

NEW DELHI: The frenzy around Virat Kohli seemed to have calmed down at the Ferozeshah Kotla on Wednesday. There was, however, no drop in intensity in the batter's preparations going into his first Ranji Trophy game in 12 years. A day before Delhi's match against Railways, Kohli showed just why and how he has managed to be India's most cherished cricketer over the last decade.Kohli arrived at the Arun Jaitley Stadium 90 minutes before the rest of the Delhi team, at 7.30 am. He hit the new gym facilities even before DDCA officials arrived at the premises and went through a rigorous session. He then joined the Delhi team for the usual high intensity warm-up drills followed by a game of football. He then capped the day with another thorough nets session. All of this at the age of 36, when speculation about the future of his international career has gathered steam.A few cricketers from the Delhi team who reached a little earlier than the usual reporting time of 9 am rushed to the gym to observe and train with Kohli for a while. They had a first-hand look at the relentless routine that has made Kohli a model cricketer.The match against Railways from Thursday will most likely be Delhi's last game this season, with a quarterfinal spot looking like a distant dream at the moment. However, a win here could give Railways a real chance of qualifying for the knockout stages.For Kohli, though, the match is about making a statement of sorts. The return coincides with his recent struggles in Test cricket which have led to criticism. If one has observed Kohli over the last two days at the Kotla, there is no doubting the sincerity of his approach.Delhi captain Ayush Badoni gave a crisp reply to a query on Kohli's inputs so far. ""He just said that we should be confident, express ourselves and play with a lot of intensity, like he does,"" Badoni told reporters.Runs in this game won't influence the national selectors' outlook towards Kohli. If anything, this outing is about Kohli's pride. Much has been made of his recent weakness outside the off stump, and the repeated failures would have no doubt hurt the ego of a cricketer with over 9000 Test runs and 30 Test centuries.Kohli has gone through specific drills here in the nets, like taking throwdowns with a slim bat which has been specifically designed to simulate hitting the ball with the middle of a regular bat. He also worked on run scoring options on the off-side other than his trademark cover drives.It was always unlikely Kohli would seek out any of the Delhi support staff to discuss his technique. Probably, he has devised some drills with his go-to man, former India batting coach Sanjay Bangar , before arriving in Delhi. But he did spend some time with head coach Sarandeep Singh, who served as national selector during Kohli's tenure as India captain. Kohli was seen explaining to him some things about his batting after a 45-minute stint in the nets.This Ranji Trophy match, then, is part of Kohli's extensive preparation for the upcoming international season. The thick layering of green on the Kotla pitch and the heavy conditions due to the receding winter could offer him a decent opportunity to challenge himself. One expects a sizeable crowd to turn up at the Kotla on Thursday, and that too might be to Kohli's liking.","Kohli arrived at the Arun Jaitley Stadium 90 minutes before the rest of the Delhi team, at 7.30 am.

Virat Kohli trains at Kotla ahead of Ranji Trophy return

NEW DELHI: Australian opener Usman Khawaja delivered a resounding response to his critics, crafting a sublime century on a turning track in Galle during the first Test against Sri Lanka on Wednesday.His 16th Test hundred, achieved in the second session, ended a 19-month wait for a triple-figure score and reaffirmed his importance in Australia’s red-ball squad.Known for his composure and mental toughness, Khawaja reflected on overcoming rough patches in his career. Speaking after the day's play, he credited his faith, family, and perspective beyond cricket for keeping him grounded.""This hundred is really special—everything comes from the Almighty, and I truly believe that. Whether good or bad, you take it in stride. Even if things seem tough, I always believe it's for the best,"" Khawaja told SEN Cricket.""There have been so many ups and downs in my life where I thought, 'This is bad,' but something amazing always came from it. Cricket doesn’t dictate my life. I have a beautiful family and a supportive wife—there’s much more to life than just cricket. But I still love playing, so I'll always train hard and give my best. At some point, you just have to let go and trust the big man up there.""While celebrating his own milestone, Khawaja also lauded Steve Smith , who had a landmark day in Galle. Smith first crossed 10,000 Test runs before going on to notch his 35th Test hundred, further cementing his legacy as one of the modern greats.Having played alongside Smith for over a decade, Khawaja spoke warmly about their journey together.""I've known Smudge since he was 16. We played first grade against each other, came through the New South Wales system together, and have spent years representing Australia. I've batted with him more than anyone in Test cricket, and we share a great camaraderie. We started as boys, and now we’re men. It was really special to be out there for his 10,000th run. I thought I’d witness it in Sydney, but I missed out, so I was glad to be there today. I'm very happy for him.""With both centurions in fine form, Australia hold a strong position in the Galle Test . As the duo looks to extend their partnership on Day 2, Khawaja remains optimistic.""And it's not over yet—you’ll still see Steve and me batting tomorrow. We’re looking forward to it, and I think it’s only going to get better,"" he added with a smile.","Usman Khawaja scored his 16th Test hundred in Galle on Wednesday.

This achievement made Ali the first player in ISPL to score consecutive fifties.Kolkata, batting first, had a stable opening partnership between Moyoddin Shaikh and Fardeen Kazi. The first wicket fell when Kazi was dismissed by Prajyot Ambhire while attempting a big shot.Shaikh led the Kolkata innings with 23 runs from 23 balls before Firoz Shaikh dismissed him. Bhavesh Pawar contributed 17 runs from six balls with one boundary and two sixes, while Subhajit Jana Dhoni remained unbeaten on 10.Raju Mukhiya picked up two wickets in the penultimate over, dismissing Prathamesh Thakre and Thomas Dias.

KL Rahul returns as Karnataka eye Ranji knock-out berth with win over Haryana,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/kl-rahul-returns-as-karnataka-eye-ranji-knock-out-berth-with-win-over-haryana/articleshow/117692863.cms,"BENGALURU: The euphoria over the appearances of star players in the final round of Ranji Trophy league fixtures may have garnered most of the attention, but there is also excitement and interest since qualification for the knockouts is down to the wire in most groups.Until the previous round, Karnataka’s chances were suspended by a slender thread, but Mayank Agarwal and his men improved their chances with seven points from an innings win against Punjab last week.They aren’t out of the woods though and will have to replicate that performance — at least result-wise — when they take on Haryana at the M Chinnaswamy stadium on Thursday. Placed third in Group C behind Haryana (26) and Kerala (21), the hosts (19) will need seven points to make it to the knockouts without drama.Kerala will start favourites against Bihar and a win will take them to 27 points and to the top of the table. If Karnataka does secure a bonus point against Haryana, they will knock the visitors out since the home team is ahead on the bonus point criterion. A mere win would bring several other results into play.What augurs well for Karnataka coach Yere Goud is that he has a full pool of players to choose from for probably the first time this season. Agarwal is likely to open the innings with KV Aneesh, but KL Rahul , who returns to the state side after five years, is likely to unseat Devdutt Padikkal from the No.3 position.Rahul’s presence would imply changes down the batting order with in-form R Smaran and KL Shrijith dropping a slot down. Vidwath Kaverappa , who returns to the side, means either Yashovardhan Parantap or Abhilash Shetty would have to sit out.While Rahul, who has been the cynosure at Chinnaswamy stadium over the past two days, batted for about 45 minutes Wednesday, Kaverappa, who had an extended session on Tuesday, kept it light. The brownish-tinged strip for this game hasn’t been used lately and is expected to initially offer slow bounce and carry.Haryana has made up for the lack of star power, with wholesome team efforts. It’s what has got them to the top of the table. Individually, their players have managed average numbers, but as a team they have clicked.Himanshu Rana (419) is their leading run-getter, while Ankit Kumar (309) and Dheeru Singh (291) have been consistent contributors and all-rounder Nishant Sindhu adds to the firepower. On the bowling front, seasoned spinner Jayant Yadav is their leading wicket-taker with 23, followed by the in-form pacer Anshul Kamboj (22). However, young pacer Anuj Thakral, who claimed a 10-wicket match on First-Class debut last week against Bengal, would be the one to watch.In the run up to the game, Goud has tried to block out the qualification scenario and the pressure factor.""With 19 points, we stand an outside chance to qualify. I expect players and the team to give it their best,” said the former Karnataka and Railways skipper.On the return of Rahul, Goud said, “He brings a lot of experience and adds a lot of value to the side in all aspects of the game.”",Karnataka take on Haryana at the M Chinnaswamy stadium on Thursday.

Delhi's Ranji Trophy captain Ayush Badoni has welcomed Virat Kohli 's return to the team ahead of their match against Railways at the Arun Jaitley Stadium on Thursday.""Everyone is very excited and highly motivated with him in the team. His presence brings a different energy and makes the team feel more lively,"" Badoni said.Kohli made a notable return to the Delhi squad on Tuesday, marking his first Ranji Trophy appearance in 12 years at the Arun Jaitley Stadium.The stadium holds special significance for Kohli, as it was here he began his first-class cricket journey in November 2006 with a brief innings of 10 runs.Delhi currently stands sixth in Group D with one win, two losses, and three draws. Their last match resulted in a 10-wicket defeat to Saurashtra, where Ravindra Jadeja claimed 12 wickets, including seven in the second innings.Kohli's last Ranji Trophy match was against Uttar Pradesh in November 2012, where he scored 14 and 42 runs, dismissed both times by Bhuvneshwar Kumar.In his debut 2006/07 Ranji season, Kohli scored 257 runs in six matches at an average of 36.71, including two half-centuries with a highest score of 90.The 2007/08 season saw improved statistics with 373 runs in five matches at an average of 53.28, including two centuries and a top score of 169. However, he struggled with consistency in six innings where he failed to cross fifty.In the 2008-09 season, Kohli maintained steady form with 174 runs in four games at an average of 34.80, including two fifties and a best score of 83.The 2009/10 and 2010/11 seasons proved crucial for Kohli 's career. He scored 374 runs in three matches at an average of 93.50 in 2009/10, with one century and two fifties.In 2010/11, he continued his strong performance with 339 runs in four matches at an average of 56.50, including two centuries and a highest score of 173.His last Ranji appearance in the 2012/13 season was brief, scoring 56 runs in one game against Uttar Pradesh.Overall, Kohli's Ranji Trophy career statistics show 1,573 runs at an average of 50.77, with five centuries and six fifties in 23 matches.Since 2020, Kohli's Test performance has seen a decline.

NEW DELHI: Former England captain Michael Vaughan recently commended Australian batsman Steve Smith for his remarkable achievement of surpassing 10,000 runs in Test cricket , a milestone that aligns him with cricketing legends such as Don Bradman Smith achieved this feat during the first Test against Sri Lanka in Galle, joining Allan Border Steve Waugh , and Ricky Ponting as the only Australians to have reached this landmark.This accomplishment also places Smith among a select group of 15 cricketers worldwide who have achieved over 10,000 runs in Test cricket, highlighting his significant impact on the format.“I would argue that he is the best modern-day Test match player. I think he is the best problem solver. He has a quirky technique, but he just seems to be able to pick the ball out of the bowler’s hand quicker than most. He has this amazing ability to study the field and work out what is on and what is not on any given day on a pitch,” Vaughan told Fox Cricket.Smith's journey to this milestone began in 2010 when he debuted in Test cricket against Pakistan at Lord's, initially contributing more as a leg-spinner.Over the years, he has transformed into one of the most consistent and adaptable batsmen in the game, amassing 34 Test centuries, which ranks him seventh on the all-time list for most hundreds in Test cricket.His performance has been particularly noteworthy against strong teams like England and India, against whom he has scored over 6,000 runs in 61 Tests. Adam Gilchrist , former Australian wicketkeeper-batsman, and Ravi Shastri, former Indian coach and commentator, both reflected on Smith's evolution from a leg-spinner to a leading batsman in Test cricket.“I think part of what is so amazing is how it started and how he got into the team at No. 8 or 9, bowling leg spin, when we were still in the hunt for a replacement for Warnie (Shane Warne). There were questions about whether he was going to be that option. That is what I find quite stunning about his career—how it started,” Gilchrist added.","Steve Smith reached 10,000 runs in Test cricket during the first Test against Sri Lanka.

NEW DELHI: Karnataka recently scripted history by winning the Vijay Hazare Trophy (VHT) for a record fifth time in the 2024-25 edition, bringing an end to their five-year title drought. One of the key reasons behind this triumph was the performance of captain Mayank Agarwal , who finished as the edition's second-highest run-scorer, accumulating 651 runs in 10 matches. Karnataka registered the second-biggest successful chase in the tournament's history, chasing down a target of 383 against Mumbai.However, Mayank's glorious run arrived after perseverance under immense pressure internally and externally. The cricketer was motivated to send a message to those who wrote him off, as shared by his coach Rx Muralidhar during an interaction with TOI.""Mayank made a tremendous comeback considering Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy (SMAT) 2024-25 didn't go well. People were happy to write him off. Mayank said, 'Hang on. Don't rule me out. I am here to stay. VHT 2024-25 will be a special tournament where my 2.0 version will be visible'"" said Muralidhar. The Karnataka captain had scored 179 runs in seven SMAT 2024-25 matches at an average of 25.57.""We worked on him staying in the present, playing as many balls as possible and also enhanced his hitting ability. Worrying too much about the outcome was throwing him off-balance which we focussed on cutting out. Mayank took responsibility during the chase against Mumbai which was pleasing to see. Once you do that, the team rallies around you,"" added the cricketer's coach.Mayank went unsold in the IPL 2025 auction despite being a prolific performer, which Muralidhar admitted left him stunned and disappointed. ""Going unsold was very tough for Mayank as well as an emotional challenge. We looked at it as an opportunity to reprogram and redevelop the gameplay. Every dark phase provides an opportunity to grow. There have been lots of ups and downs in Mayank's career. His mindset during the tough times is to keep on improving,"" stated the cricketer's coach.""During the initial stages, Mayank was the basher of the team due to his fantastic strokeplay. After a few seasons, people questioned the lack of big runs. At that point, he transformed his focus towards converting his quick starts into match-winning knocks under pressure. Mayank knows he can take on any bowler at any point,"" added Muralidhar.The cricketer's coach hailed his work ethic, stating that Mayank's ""sole focus in every breath"" is to simply work towards making a comeback to the Indian team. ""His only issue is self-doubt. In those moments, I keep bringing up the fact that he is the 295th player to represent India in Tests which is a huge achievement. That helps him beat the negativity,"" said Muralidhar.""My only advice to Mayank would be to keep bringing his passion into play. Magic happens in the middle, it doesn't happen in the dressing room,"" stated the cricketer's coach.","Mayank Agarwal finished as the edition's second-highest run-scorer, accumulating 651 runs in 10 matches. Karnataka registered the second-biggest successful chase in the tournament's history. The Karnataka captain had scored 179 runs in seven SMAT 2024-25 matches at an average of 25.57.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117683221,imgsize-24578,width-400,resizemode-4/117683221.jpg"

Virat Kohli trains at Kotla ahead of Ranji Trophy return

NEW DELHI: The Pakistan Cricket Board ( PCB ) remains steadfast in its assurance that the National Stadium in Karachi will be prepared to host matches for the upcoming Champions Trophy, despite growing concerns over the venue’s readiness for the marquee event, set to begin on February 19.Pakistan’s leading English daily, Dawn, reported on Wednesday that completing the renovation work within the stipulated deadline seems ""absolutely impossible,"" but those responsible for the task remain optimistic.“The board will either be hailed as a hero or face criticism as a zero for undertaking such a mammoth task,” the newspaper commented.PCB chairman Mohsin Naqvi recently inspected the Rawalpindi stadium and reiterated that the Champions Trophy would proceed as planned. However, it appears unlikely that the Board will gain full control of the renovated venues in Lahore, Karachi, and Rawalpindi by the January 31 deadline.These stadiums are also set to host another major international event before the Champions Trophy—the four-match tri-series featuring New Zealand and South Africa from February 8 to 14. The first two matches will be played in Lahore, followed by two in Karachi, including the final.""Look, the stadiums will be in a shape to host matches but the question is the PCB has promised everyone a world-class experience at these renovated venues for the Tri-series and Champions Trophy and whether they can deliver on that promise remains to be seen,"" PTI quoted a source, who is following the construction work.Bilal Chohan, overseeing the renovation efforts, has reportedly faced delays due to a lack of timely equipment and clearances in Karachi. The panels meant for installation on the new stadium building were only released from Karachi Port on Sunday night, with work scheduled to commence the following morning.“These are the challenges we’re dealing with, yet it’s disappointing to see criticism directed at us,” Chohan remarked.The PCB has invested approximately PKR 12 billion in renovation, construction, and installation of new facilities across the three venues in Lahore and Karachi. While ticket sales have already begun, concerns persist until the Board officially confirms possession of the upgraded stadiums.Adding to the uncertainty, ICC CEO Geoff Allardice resigned on Tuesday, with a board member of the global governing body indicating that his inability to provide a clear assessment of Pakistan’s preparedness was among the factors leading to his departure.","The Pakistan Cricket Board remains steadfast in its assurance that the National Stadium in Karachi will be prepared to host matches for the upcoming Champions Trophy.

Poll Is It Right For A Coach To File A FIFA Complaint Over Wages? No Yes

NEW DELHI: Andrey Chernyshov resigned as head coach of Mohammedan Sporting on Wednesday, citing unpaid wages going back three months. The Russian tactician, who guided Mohammedan Sporting to the I-League title last season, announced his departure with a post on social media.""My dear friends, fans of the club. Today is a very sad day for me. I am forced to step down as head coach of MSC and my contract has been terminated for failure to fulfil the terms by the club. Circumstances force me to make this difficult decision. This is the most difficult and sad decision in my coaching career,"" Chernyshov wrote on Instagram.""As a professional, I cannot work for 3 months without receiving a salary. I will not now talk about the difficulties that we, the players, coaches and staff had to overcome this season. I have never been afraid of difficulties and always came out to you and journalists when you wanted to talk to me. But this cannot continue. I made this decision with tears in my eyes. But all the blame for this lies with the club’s management, which did not fulfill the terms of the contract.""A senior official from Mohammedan Sporting SC told TimesofIndia.com, ""We received news from another source that Chernyshov had lodged a complaint with FIFA regarding the club’s financial situation and player wage issues without informing us. However, we have not received any official notice from FIFA regarding the matter.""It is believed that the club currently does not have any plans to appoint a new head coach. For the time being, assistant coach Mehrajuddin Wadoo will step in as the interim manager.Suggesting that a meeting with club shareholders, Bunkerhill and Shrachi Group, is yet to be held, the official further clarified, ""This coach was brought in by Bunkerhill. Shrachi Group and Mohammedan SC played no role in his hiring. Now, all stakeholders will convene to determine how to settle the coach’s pending dues.""TimesofIndia.com understands that the club management was displeased with Chernyshov’s handling of the financial crisis.While players refused to train due to unpaid wages, it is learned that Chernyshov opted to remain inside his room rather than encouraging the squad to take to the field.Playing their debut ISL season, Mohammedan Sporting have won only two matches and drawn five, currently sitting at the bottom of the league table.

Champions League fixtures (all to start at 1:30am IST):

The new league phase of this season's expanded UEFA Champions League is set for a frantic conclusion on Wednesday.18 matches will be played simultaneously across Europe and the likes of Manchester City and Paris Saint-Germain are the teams in focus as they battle to avoid an early exit.The top eight teams, in the 36-club format, will qualify automatically for the next stage in the competition. Meanwhile, the teams that finish between ninth to 24th in the standings will go into Friday's draw for the playoffs. There, the first legs will be played on February 11 and 12 and the return matches a week later.The teams that finish higher up in the standings will be rewarded by facing teams that finished further down the table in the playoffs. So, teams finishing ninth and 10th will face the side either in 23rd or 24th place, while 15th and 16th will face either 17th or 18th.In this revised format, teams from same country can be drawn together and there is a potential for teams that have already played this season to meet once again.Having said all that, plenty can change, or will change, on Wednesday, but based on the current points table PSG could play Lille in the playoffs, while Bayern or Real Madrid could play Juventus or Celtic.For the teams that finish in the top-eight places, there is the incentive of skipping the two-legged knockout round playoffs, getting some precious rest as they advance straight to the last-16 in March.Liverpool , with seven wins out of seven, and Barcelona are the only two teams to have already booked their place in the last-16.Arsenal, Inter Milan, Atletico Madrid, AC Milan, Atalanta and Bayer Leverkusen occupy the other six spots. That could change dramatically in this closely-contested new structure.Take this into consideration: Stuttgart, in 24th position, are only three points behind Bayer Leverkusen in eighth, with 15 sides in between them.Arsenal and Inter Milan need only draw away to Girona and at home to Monaco, respectively, in order to secure their last-16 spots.Only nine of the 36 teams come into the final matchday still fighting to secure qualification for the next phase, including former European Cup winners PSV Eindhoven and Benfica.Big names like defending champions Real Madrid, last season's runners-up Borussia Dortmund, Bayern Munich and Juventus are all hoping to avoid going into the playoffs. However, they are already guaranteed to at least be in February's playoff round.Meanwhile, the biggest name under threat of going out completely is Manchester City. The 2023 champions are currently languishing in 25th position, one place and two points outside the qualifying spots.Pep Guardiola's team were beaten 4-2 away at PSG last week and have taken a single point from their last four games in the competition.""Today we don't deserve it,"" Guardiola said when asked following the PSG defeat if the new format was fair.""What is the argument that it isn't fair? I said to the players to accept it and recover. We have to recover our game, that is what we have to do.""City, sitting in a challenging position, know a win in their last match - against Club Brugge at the Etihad Stadium - will take them through.PSG, who took a big swing at the European elite by beating City, eased their fears of being eliminated, although it could still happen. The Ligue 1 champions go to Stuttgart, where a draw will be enough to take both teams through.For many, especially the clubs who are still involved in domestic tournaments and have had packed calendars, avoiding the playoffs would be an objective as well.""The table does not lie. At the moment we aren't a top team. Top teams don't lose as many games. But we still have the feeling that we're in a process and on a good path,"" said Bayern's Joshua Kimmich after his team's 3-0 loss at Feyenoord last week.Liverpool, BarcelonaArsenal, Aston Villa, Atalanta, Atletico Madrid, Bayern Munich, Brest, Celtic, Borussia Dortmund, Feyenoord, Inter, Juventus, Bayer Leverkusen, Lille, AC Milan, Monaco, Real MadridNoneBologna, Red Star Belgrade, Girona, Leipzig, Salzburg, Slovan Bratislava, Sparta Prague, Sturm Graz, Young BoysSporting CP vs BolognaPSV vs LiverpoolYoung Boys vs Red Star BelgradeStuttgart vs PSGSturm Graz vs LeipzigManchester City vs Club BruggeBayern Munich vs Slovan BratislavaInter vs MonacoBorussia Dortmund vs Shakhtar DonetskBarcelona vs AtalantaBayer Leverkusen vs Sparta PragueJuventus vs BenficaDinamo Zagreb vs AC MilanSalsburg vs Atletico MadridLille vs FeyenoordAston Villa vs CelticGirona vs ArsenalBrest vs Real Madrid","18 matches will be played simultaneously across Europe on Wednesday.

Former Manchester United midfielder Paul Scholes has delivered a scathing critique of Marcus Rashford , claiming the out-of-favour forward has ""let his teammates down"" and should be ""banished"" from the dressing room.Rashford, who has not played for United since December 12, has been repeatedly excluded from manager Ruben Amorim ’s squad, apart from one game where he remained an unused substitute.On Sunday, Amorim made a pointed remark about Rashford’s lack of effort, saying he would prefer to include 63-year-old goalkeeping coach Jorge Vital in the squad over the 27-year-old forward.Speaking on The Overlap Fan Debate, Scholes pulled no punches in his assessment of Rashford’s attitude. ""I think Marcus has let a lot of people down really, with his attitude, and I think that's what the manager is trying to say,"" said the United legend, who won 11 Premier League titles during his illustrious career.Scholes emphasized the influence Rashford should have on younger players, such as Alejandro Garnacho, given his experience and age. ""He's 27 years of age, and he's clearly not training properly. Young players are looking up to him, and he’s setting the wrong example.""Drawing from his own experiences, Scholes shared a moment when former manager Sir Alex Ferguson admonished him for letting down his teammates, likening that situation to Rashford’s current predicament.""Marcus is doing exactly the same. He’s not outright refusing to play, but his behavior and lack of effort in training essentially say, 'I don’t want to be involved.'""Scholes concluded with a harsh verdict: ""The fact he’s letting his teammates down in that dressing room means he should be banished. If young players see this as an example, the sooner he’s gone, the better.""Scholes’ criticism follows similarly strong remarks from former United defender Rio Ferdinand. Speaking on his Rio Ferdinand Presents podcast, Ferdinand said there was ""no way back"" for Rashford following Amorim’s damning comments.The England forward, who stated in December he was ready for a ""new challenge"" after being omitted from the squad to face Manchester City, has been linked with potential moves to Barcelona, Borussia Dortmund, and AC Milan. However, his reported £300,000-a-week ($374,000) salary, on a contract running until 2028, presents a significant obstacle to any January transfer.Rashford has been a key player for United in the past, scoring 138 goals in 426 appearances for the club. But with his current situation at odds with the team’s expectations, his long-term future at Old Trafford looks increasingly uncertain.","Paul Scholes says Marcus Rashford should be ""banished"" from the Manchester United dressing room.

(Bayern Munich Photo)

Bayern Munich has made a significant move for the future by signing 21-year-old goalkeeper Jonas Urbig from Cologne . The Bavarian club announced the transfer late Monday, confirming a deal that had been anticipated for some time.Urbig is regarded as one of Germany's most promising young goalkeepers, and his arrival at Bayern signals the club's intent to groom him as a potential successor to Manuel Neuer . At 38, Neuer remains Bayern’s first-choice goalkeeper but is nearing the twilight of his illustrious career.“We’re delighted to secure another signing with an eye on the future,” said Bayern’s sporting director Christoph Freund. He also referenced last week’s acquisition of German youth international Tom Bischof , emphasizing the club’s focus on young talent.Freund praised Urbig as “a modern goalkeeper” who aligns with Bayern’s style of play. He highlighted Urbig’s ambition, potential, and ability to emulate Neuer’s aggressive approach, often venturing out of goal to intercept threats and contribute to the team’s buildup play. This proactive style has been a hallmark of Neuer’s game, allowing Bayern to maintain high defensive lines while applying pressure on opponents.Bayern reportedly paid up to €10 million, including bonuses, to Cologne for Urbig, according to Kicker magazine. The young goalkeeper is expected to compete with Sven Ulreich , 36, and injured Israeli shot-stopper Daniel Peretz for the No. 2 spot behind Neuer. Meanwhile, Alexander Nübel , currently on loan at Stuttgart, remains another potential option for Bayern’s goalkeeping future. Nübel extended his Bayern contract until 2029, and his loan at Stuttgart likely ensures his continued presence in their lineup next season under coach Sebastian Hoeness.Urbig, under contract with Bayern until June 2029, is also in contention to represent Germany at the Under-21 European Championship in June, competing with Freiburg’s Noah Atubolu for the starting role. Earlier this season, Urbig began as Cologne’s starting goalkeeper in the second division but lost his spot to Marvin Schwäbe after 10 games.Speaking to Bayern’s website, Urbig expressed his excitement about joining the club. “I’m proud to be here and look forward to getting to know my new team as quickly as possible. My goal is to improve every day and continue my development within our goalkeeping group alongside Manuel Neuer,” he said.",Bayern Munich has signed goalkeeper Jonas Urbig from Cologne.

Former Manchester United defender Rio Ferdinand believes that Marcus Rashford's future at the club is uncertain following comments made by manager Ruben Amorim .Amorim stated that he would rather have his goalkeeping coach, Jorge Vital, in his matchday squad than Rashford.Rashford has not played for United since December 12, with Amorim leaving him out of the squad for every game since, apart from one in which he was an unused substitute.When asked about Rashford's absence from the squad for Sunday's 1-0 win at Fulham , Amorim made a pointed reference to the player's effort in training.""The reason is the training, what I think a footballer should do in training, in life and every day... I will put (in) Vital before I put (in) a player who doesn't give the maximum every day,"" said Amorim.Ferdinand, who had a successful 12-year career at Old Trafford, said he would be embarrassed by such a statement.""If I was that player that the manager said that about... embarrassment,"" he said on the Rio Ferdinand Presents podcast.""We all have days off or moments when we're not performing well, lacking confidence, but effort isn't really one of the things I would want to be hearing a manager say is lacking in my makeup.""That's a damning comment, because I think he knows what the reaction is after that comment. He's not saying that without thinking, 'Where does this go after?' There's really no way back for Marcus after that, I don't think, with that type of comment.""Ferdinand believes that there is ""really no way back for Marcus"" after Amorim's comment, despite acknowledging that everyone has off days or moments of lacking confidence.Rashford expressed his desire for a new challenge in December, but he is currently in limbo with one week remaining in the January transfer window.Several European clubs, such as Barcelona, Borussia Dortmund and AC Milan, have shown interest in the 27-year-old, who has scored 138 goals in 426 appearances for United.However, any potential move is complicated by Rashford's reported £300,000-a-week salary on a contract that runs until 2028.","Manchester United manager Ruben Amorim said he would rather have his goalkeeping coach, Jorge Vital, in his matchday squad than Marcus Rashford.

Novak Djokovic v Alexander Zverev Highlights | Australian Open 2025 Semifinal

Rafael Nadal's uncle and former coach has joined others in questioning Novak Djokovic 's hamstring injury that led to his withdrawal from the Australian Open semi-final. Toni Nadal , who coached Rafael for almost 30 years, also addressed the crowd's reaction to Djokovic 's retirement.In his column for El Pais , Toni Nadal expressed concerns about Djokovic's decision to retire against Alexander Zverev without attempting a medical timeout during the match.The crowd at Rod Laver Arena , who had paid over $400 for tickets, responded with boos and jeers when Djokovic retired from the match.""I believe that a great champion like the Serbian, someone who has contributed to the most sublime pages in the history of tennis, should not leave any court in this way and, even less so Rod Laver Arena, where he holds the record for victories and titles,"" Nadal wrote.""Respect ... is well deserved in the difficult moment, leaving the court that has seen him win so many times. I understand that the public showed their disappointment and anger at being deprived of the expected spectacle after having paid an entrance fee for it.""Toni Nadal suggested that Djokovic's history of playing through injuries has been marked by theatrical displays.""Over the years, a certain suspicion has been fostered around Novak, due to his grimaces or histrionics, which has sown doubts about the veracity of his injuries,"" he stated.""Suspicions began in his quarter-final match against Carlos Alcaraz. After losing the first set, and with obvious gestures of pain, the Serbian made it clear to his opponent and the general public he would hardly be able to continue his match. But the reality was he not only faced the rest of the match with total normality, but he even ended up winning it. Against Zverev, he played the entire first set with apparent normality and without visible signs of pain until he decided to abandon it just after the German won the first set.""Following the match, Djokovic explained that he was ""upset"" about his worsening hamstring tear . He mentioned trying everything possible to manage the pain.Djokovic later shared an MRI image of his injured hamstring on social media to address skepticism about his condition.""When a player faces physical problems in a match of this nature, he normally waits until the end to decide to retire,"" Toni Nadal continued. ""He calls the physiotherapist, plays some games impaired and, only when he sees the inevitable fate, does he decide to retire. On more than one occasion we have seen Novak with similar performances, with facial gestures and body language that contradict what we are seeing on the court, and that sow certain doubts about the authenticity of his problems.""Australian Open tournament director Craig Tiley had revealed in 2023 that Djokovic had won his tenth Melbourne Park title while dealing with a 3cm hamstring tear. However, athletes and medical experts disputed this claim.Toni Nadal's coaching career includes guiding Rafael to numerous major victories, including 10 Roland-Garros titles, one Australian Open, two Wimbledon championships, three US Open titles, and an Olympic gold medal. Their partnership lasted until 2017. He later spent three years coaching Canadian player Félix Auger-Aliassime.","Novak Djokovic retired mid-way into his Australian Open 2025 semi-final match with injury.

Even the Latvia players were surprised when we beat them 4-0.""India are ranked eight places above Latvia - at 38.The captain, a former Togolese Davis Cupper himself who migrated to the US years back and was in the coaching team that worked with the Williams sisters in their formative years, draws his confidence from the ability of the four-member team at his disposal. His team of players are based around the world and have been specially assembled for this journey - two from Paris, one from Nantes and the other from Atlanta, USA - not just to earn glory, but respect too.""The Williams sisters changed women tennis. If you have a female tennis player doing what they're doing now, is because of them. Because before, nobody had to go to the gym to get strong. Those girls came, they're so powerful that they force everybody to do a lot more,"" he said.They also changed mindset on race, reminded Agnamba. ""You know, when you're a person of colour, you're already 10 steps below before you can come up. You have to be the best of the best to get respect. Even that sometimes you may not.""Togo would be looking to inspire some of that respect over the weekend. ""Obviously we have four players here that all live in different parts of the world, but we have a way to communicate together through chat. And when there's a competition like this, we kind of figure out how each player can get ready individually, either by training or going to competition. And that's how the team has been performing for the past three years,"" said Agnamba, who admitted having a culture shock when he shifted base to the US 30 years back.In a bid to escape poverty and being able to pursue the sport, the players had to leave Togo seeking greener pastures abroad, but their loyalty remains firmly with the western African country. So, in the match against India, the objective was not just to have a better show in Davis Cup, but to inspire several others back home struggling to make ends meet. Tennis is the second-most followed sport in Togo, behind football.""When you grow up in developing countries, the opportunity is very small. And when you are good at any type of sport, I mean, since we're talking about tennis and the dream is always to get out of the country because once you get out, you have more opportunity to train, you have better equipment. And yeah, that's always been a dream to get out of the country, to have more opportunity.""So, the average kid that plays tennis back home, they're coming from very poor families, and you cannot be your best in Africa. You must get up. And I think for any African country that played in the Davis Cup, 90% of the players live overseas. In developing countries there are a lot of poor kids that use sport as a way to get out of the country to have a better life. And I'll tell you, 99% of the players that are able to compete for Togo come from very poor families. But the system that we have there, the federation helps the best players.""",Togo face India in the Davis Cup 2025 World Group Playoff match on the weekend. Captain Ali Agnamba believes his team is in the middle of the best phase in two decades. Togo have reached this position the back of a 10-match winning streak.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117666069,imgsize-31432,width-400,resizemode-4/117666069.jpg"

NEW DELHI: India's top-ranked singles player Sumit Nagal has dropped out of the ATP top-100 rankings after a prolonged stint of 10 consecutive months.This setback comes on the heels of a string of underwhelming performances.Simultaneously, veteran doubles specialist Rohan Bopanna has slipped out of the top-20 rankings due to an early exit from the Australian Open, where he was defending a substantial number of points.Nagal had maintained his top-100 ranking since March 2024, initially breaking into the elite bracket in February of the same year on the back of a commendable showing at the season's first Grand Slam event.However, his recent struggles on the demanding Tour have been evident, with only three main draw victories across 18 tournaments since Wimbledon 2024.A top-100 ranking is highly coveted as it guarantees direct entries into major events, including Grand Slams, where even early-round exits can yield decent prize money.Sasikumar Mukund, Ramkumar Ramanathan, Karan Singh, and Aryan Shah are the other Indian singles players in the top-600 rankings.In the doubles realm, the 44-year-old Bopanna, still playing at a high level, has dropped five places to No. 21.As the defending champion at the Australian Open, he had to defend a significant number of points, but an opening-round exit with his new partner, Nicolas Barrientos, proved costly.Yuki Bhambri, N Sriram Balaji, Rithvik Choudary Bollipalli, and Arjun Kadhe are the other Indian doubles players in the top-100 rankings.Notably, Mukund, Ramkumar, Balaji, Karan Singh, and Bollipalli are part of the Indian Davis Cup squad set to face Togo in the World Group I Play-off tie on February 1-2, while Nagal and Bhambri have opted out of the match.",India's top-ranked singles player Sumit Nagal has dropped out of the ATP top-100 rankings.

NEW DELHI: Current world number one and reigning Australian Open champion Jannik Sinner has announced his withdrawal from the upcoming ATP 500 tournament in Rotterdam.The 23-year-old Italian, who recently secured his third Grand Slam title by defeating Alexander Zverev in the Australian Open final, has cited the need for rest and recovery as the primary reason for his decision.In a statement released by the tournament organizers, Sinner acknowledged the difficulty of the decision but emphasised the importance of allowing his body to recuperate after the gruelling campaign in Australia.""After consulting with my team we had to take the difficult decision to withdraw from the ABN AMRO Open,"" Sinner said. ""My body needs time to rest after the long run in Australia.""Sinner, who won the Rotterdam title last year, expressed his fondness for the tournament and the enthusiastic crowds, stating, ""My body needs time to rest after the long run in Australia.

There’s an opaqueness to Jannik Sinner on a tennis court, the tighter a match gets the more inscrutable his expression becomes. Then, as the contest peaks and he is pulled out wide, he threads the needle with a two-hander. Sinner clutches his racket at the throat and shakes it, as if he’s in a conversation with his coaches Darren Cahill and Simone Vagnozzi, who are seated in his courtside box.The 23-year-old World No.1, who scored a straight-set win over the No.2 seed Alexander Zverev in the Australian Open final on Sunday, which made him the first Italian to lift three Grand Slam trophies, has been under a doping cloud these last nine months. Sinner, who won successive hard court majors in a span of four months while dealing with the upshot of positive drug tests, has flaunted serious heft.The World Anti-Doping Agency has appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport and a hearing is scheduled for April. The Italian faces a potential ban of up to two years.“Even when it's very difficult to block these kind of things, when I go on the court, I have the team and people who are close to me who trust me,” he said, sporting a striking Italian blue for his post-championship media conference. “That for me is even more important because I can talk with them, very openly.”“When I go on court, I try to focus on the match,” he said. “I know the match can be three, four, five hours, but that's the time when I have to be very focused. Obviously also in the gym, trying to stay with your routine, then you think a bit less about what's happening. Of course, it's still a little bit in the back of your mind.”Sinner and world No.3 Carlos Alcaraz, who have taken the baton from tennis’ terrific trio – Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and the still-competing Novak Djokovic -- who between them have won the last five Grand Slams, and six of the last seven, said he doesn’t need to use the CAS case to give him extra motivation to succeed.“What happened, happened, no?” Sinner said. “As I always say, I keep playing like this because I have a clear mind on what happened. If I was guilty, I would not play like this, that's it. At the moment, I'm not thinking about this. Of course, you have your moments, certain days where you feel like I wish I would not have this problem. In the other way, I'm always looking forward to go on the court.”Sinner, whose first language is German and speaks passable Italian, is his country’s most popular sportsperson. Last year, when Sinner emerged as the surprise winner of the Melbourne Park fortnight, there were no Italian journalists present, there hadn’t been one for years. This year there was almost a dozen of them, tracking the No.1s moves.Gaia Piccardi, tennis writer for Corriere Della Sera, says Italians admire Sinner’s work ethic. “Italians love a good sporting story, especially one that’s going to go a few years,” she says, “they see Jannik as someone they can cheer on for another 10 years.’’Vagnozzi, who has been with Sinner since February 2022, spoke of the No.1’s mental prowess.“Mentally he is really, really strong. When he wants something, he tries to do the best he can. So sometimes when someone speak about Jannik, they talk about his groundstrokes or his power. But for me, as a coach, when you ask him (to do) something, he's able to do it quite fast.”Zverev, who said Sinner was miles ahead of everyone on hardcourts, compared the Italian to Djokovic at his best.“They barely miss, they make you think like you have to overhit all the time to have a chance in a rally against them,” the German said of Djokovic and Sinner. “It's very, very difficult to win a point from the back of the court against them. They're constantly on the baseline. They don't give you any space. They don't give you any time.”Sinner’s win over Zverev in the Australian Open final took his win streak in hardcourt majors to 21 matches. The Italian hasn’t lost a set against top-10 opposition since losing to Alcaraz in the Beijing final.“I think the facts speak for themselves,” Zverev said. “He's in a different universe right now to anyone else.”",World No.1 Jannik Sinner won the Australian Open on Sunday.

Alexander Zverev 's loss in the Australian Open final on Sunday was followed by a startling moment during the trophy ceremony.As Zverev stood at the microphone, a person in the stadium repeatedly shouted the names of two of his ex-girlfriends who have accused him of physical abuse in the past, saying ""Australia believes"" them.The crowd's reaction was mixed, with some booing and whistling in response to the interruption. At his post-match press conference, Zverev was asked about the incident.""I believe there are no more accusations,"" Zverev responded. ""There haven't been for — what? — nine months now. ... I think I've done everything I can, and I'm not about to open that subject again.""Last June, as Zverev reached the French Open final , news emerged that a Berlin district court had ended a trial stemming from a woman's accusation of domestic violence during a 2020 argument. The resolution was reached with the agreement of state prosecutors and lawyers for Zverev and his former partner.Zverev had previously denied another assault allegation made by a different woman. The ATP investigated her claims and stated in January 2023 that there was insufficient evidence.","Alexander Zverev lost to Novak Djokovic in the Australian Open final.

Jannik Sinner threw in a daring drop shot at match point, it came off his forehand side and was shaped with underspin. Alexander Zverev picked it up and didn't place it too poorly, but Sinner stepped in and swung through the court to close out the Australian Open final.After two-hours and 42-minutes of action in which time he strung together the 6-3, 7-6 (4), 6-3 win, Sinner, the world No.1, pushed his head back and threw up his arms in celebration. After the few seconds he had to himself, Rod Laver Arena on its feet, cheering him, Sinner looked at his team – coaches Darren Cahill and Simone Vagnozzi, trainer and physio Marco Panichi and Ulises Badio – before going over to embrace them.Not far from where Sinner celebrated his second successive win at Australian Open, Zverev, the world No.2, sat in his courtside seat, head bowed. The German has played three Slam finals and is looking for his first major title.Sinner and Zverev shared a warm embrace at the net and the 23-year-old began his speech with encouraging words for Zverev.""You are an amazing player,"" Sinner said. ""Keep believing in yourself, because all players and coaches know how strong you are, not only as a player, but also as a person. We all believe that you can lift one of these very, very soon.""Sinner, now a two-time Australian Open champion, and a three-time major winner, placed the Norman Brookes Challenge Cup beside him as he spoke, said, ""Talking about my team, what can I say? We worked a lot to be again in this position. It’s an amazing feeling to share this moment with all of you. It is amazing to achieve these things, but mostly to share this with you guys.""""And I know Darren, it's probably your - maybe, I try to convince you to stay - your last Australian Open as a coach, and I'm very, very happy to share this trophy with you,"" Sinner told Cahill, who was tearing up. ""Everything started a little bit when I made my whole change to Simone (Vagnozzi), and I think you are an amazing combination of coaches.""Earlier, when the German stepped forward to make his speech, there was a shout from the crowd, ""Australia Believes Olya and Brenda! Australia Believes Olya and Brenda!""Zverev battled a domestic violence case in Germany last year, accused by his ex-girlfriend Brenda Patea, the mother of his child, of physically abusing her. All of which he denies and wasn't formally charged.When asked about it in the press conference, Zverev said, ""I believe there are no more accusations. There haven't been for nine months now. Good for her. I think she was the only one in the stadium who believed anything in that moment. I think I've done everything I can, and I'm not about to open that subject again.""Zverev applauded the winner in his speech. ""You are the best player in the world by far. I was hoping that I could be more of a competitor today, but you were just too good. Congratulations to you. You really deserve it.""Sinner, who hasn't lost a set against top-ten opponents since losing to Carlos Alcaraz in Beijing in September, may not have played his best match in the final, but did enough to get through without facing a breakpoint.Sinner was kitted in colour blocks of the palest yellow and white, his attire cutting an anaemic look, while across the net Zverev was all colour, red on maroon with red shoes.In the first set, the 27-year-old, coming into the net, trying to unsettle the Italian, gave Sinner some target practice. The German trailed 15-40 in the fourth and eighth games, if the defending champion was sharpening his knife in the fourth game, he struck in the eighth and then went on to serve out the set at love in the ninth, closing with a 194 kmph ace.The roof over Rod Laver Arena was open and like the evening sky, that had lost some of its sparkle, Zverev, who looked to be in striking form as he advanced to the final at Melbourne Park , seemed to have lost some of the edge. The German did well to push the set to tie-break, where Sinner came through with a slice of luck on the ninth point, the net cord working for him, and the world No.1 broke away to seal a two-sets-to-love lead.In the third set, Sinner broke in the sixth game, as a dejected Zverev appeared to throw in the towel. The Italian was out in the front and didn't look back.","World No.1 Jannik Sinner beats Alexander Zverev in Australian Open final.

The Times of India in Melbourne:

Madison Keys walked into her post-championship media interaction in black tights and a blue tee, wearing her wholesome halo.The Australian Open champion took a sip of the celebratory bubbly and spoke eloquently about shifting goal posts, development tools, and the importance of therapy. ""I think everyone needs therapy,"" she said.Keys was all of 11 when she was first talked of as a future Grand Slam champion, at that point it was music to her ears. The American -- Rock Island, Illinois-born -- turned pro on her 14th birthday and made her WTA debut a few weeks later. Keys, already 5 ft 10 and clocking 115 mph serves, entered the Grand Slam field for the first time at Melbourne Park as an 18-year-old, the following year she stormed into her first major semifinal, at the Australian Open. In 2017, three years later, she made the US Open final.Keys, who dug deep in her media conference, said the talk around her as a child was meant to be confidence-building, an exercise in positivity.""Then you are older, you're in the later stages of your career and it kind of feels like, will this ever happen? If it doesn't happen, I didn't live up to what everyone told me I should have done,"" Keys said. ""It went from being something positive to something that (triggered) a little bit of panic. It started to kind of weigh on me. What if I never do it? If I don’t do it, am I considered a failure?""The American, who married her coach Bjorn Fratangelo , 31, acknowledged the load she was carrying was heavy.Keys, whose ranking slipped out of the top-20 late last year, was forced to look at herself in the mirror.""I finally got to the point where I was proud of myself and proud of my career, with or without a Grand Slam,"" she said, looking at the Daphne Akhurst Memorial Cup. ""I didn't need it to feel like I had a good career.""Shrugging off that weight allowed Keys to go all-out on the court and win a Grand Slam.Keys, who on Saturday became the oldest player to defeat the World No.1 and No.2 in the semifinal and final at a Grand Slam event since the WTA rankings were published in 1975, said she owed her turnaround to lots of therapy.Keys, soon to be 30, is the lowest-seeded player (No.19) to win the Australian Open in the Open Era.The American, who turns 30 in a few weeks, went the sports therapy route initially, looking to nail results. Then Keys started digging, she asked herself tough questions, what did she feel about herself?""Getting help and talking to someone not just about tennis, but about how I felt about myself, again, very uncomfortable. I never really like to be uncomfortable,"" Keys said, she was speaking for a majority. ""(But) had I not done that, I wouldn't be sitting here.""The trigger stirred when Keys had got to a point where she started to feel low and didn’t really care about tennis and results, she just wanted to feel better. She was aching to exhale.""For a long time I had this idea that people were able to ignore their nerves and just tunnel vision,"" she said. ""It was a light bulb moment (when I realized) I can be nervous and I can still play good tennis. Those things can live together. I stopped fighting, trying to push away the feelings and pretending that they're not there and just accepting them.""Keys pointed out that the stigma around therapy was starting to go away.""Everyone should be in therapy, no matter what,"" she said with a smile. ""No matter what's going on in your life, you're going to have moments where things are tough and you need someone to talk to. It's something I will continue to do for the rest of my life.""Keys, flaunting a normalcy that was enviable, might be the new standard in sport.",Madison Keys won the Australian Open on Saturday.

TimesofIndia.com in Melbourne:

Professional sport is decided by moments. By sudden change in momentum. By luck. By one wicket. By one boundary. By one jab. By one point. The margins between win and loss, joy and sorrow, could well be just that. Years and years of hard work could well be decided by these small facets. How you play that one delivery coming at you at 150 kmph. How well you land that 150 kmph in the first place. How, if at all, you duck that right hook. How you play that forehand when down match point. Or, conversely, play the big points – such as a match point – when you've got lots at stake. Madison Keys and Aryna Sabalenka had plenty at stake when they took court in front of tens of thousands of people at the Rod Laver Arena on Saturday. A $3.5 million prize cheque. 2000 ranking points. Opportunity to lift the Daphne Akhurst Memorial Cup. Accolades.Sabalenka had done these things before already, though. Twice (in 2023 and 2024). She was going for a three-peat at Melbourne Park. No one had won three in a row here since Martina Hingis in 1999. She had had a largely uneventful run to the title match. Except for the tricky second set, under stiff conditions, against Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova in the quarter-final, things had gone smoothly and as per plan.Keys, meanwhile, had ticked none of those boxes. Her last run to a major final was eight years ago – the longest gap between first two women's singles Grand Slam finals. She had not been in the top 10 for two years. And her run to the final was laden with high-profile wins – against World No. 10 Danielle Collins, World No. 6 Elena Rybakina, World No. 28 Elena Svitolina and World No. 2 Iga Swiatek . Against Swiatek, Keys was required to save a match point.On Saturday, Keys started and ended well. She broke Sabalenka in the very first game and to complete the full circle, did that once again in what was the eventual 38th game of the two-hour contest. In the moments that mattered, the miniscule bits in the grand scheme of things, Keys was braver and hit bigger shots against Sabalenka, considered one of the biggest and boldest hitters in women's tennis.In the seventh game of the decisive third set, Keys served at 30-30. The crowd was aware of the magnitude of the point as the intensity and decibel level went up. If it went Sabalenka's way, she would have a break point to create a match-changing lead. Instead, Keys served wide to the forehand and punched a winner on the return to the other side of the court. Next point, a mirror image of it with a backhand winner.Fast forward four games, it was 5-5 and 30-30, the sun had set over the Melbourne skyline and the twilight had made way for a clear and cool night. Keys bounced the ball to serve and the nerves, if any, were not quite visible for either player. They were dialled in, as you need to in professional sport from start to finish. One miscalculation, one mishit, any passivity and it could be curtains. Keys, though, was in the zone. She got down low to a deep return and diverted the ball into the corner for a winner. Next point, same direction for a similar outcome and she had pushed the envelope in Sabalenka's side.The Belarusian, who had started the match poorly, especially on serve, had regained control. But, as already mentioned, we were in small margins territory now. ""Squeaky bum time,"" as legendary Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson referred to it. Four points separated Keys from the title. Sabalenka started by sending her forehand long on a mishit. Make that three. On the second, Keys romped to a little kick serve for a backhand winner. Two more to get. Sabalenka erred on the forehand a point later and it was Championship point. The World No. 1 saved one. Could she prolong the edge-of-the-seat encounter, everyone wondered. Many neutrals in the Rod Laver Arena hoped. Instead, Keys went inside out on the forehand once and then again, the first one came back but the second one didn't. 'Maddy' had done it!Keys was the 2025 Australian Open champion. Her first-ever Grand Slam title, 16 years after turning pro. The 30-year-old became the fourth oldest first-time Grand Slam winner. When the rankings are updated on Monday, she would match her career-best World No. 7 ranking.The contrast in emotions was visible across the net. Keys erupted with smiles, joy, and sheer disbelief. She made her way to her team and exchanged hugs with everyone, including husband and coach Bjorn Fratangelo, whom she married only eight weeks ago.For Sabalenka, meanwhile, it was bewilderment – at the outcome, the tennis she displayed and most problematically, she acknowledged, with her humility of the situation. The racket bore the brunt of that. She bumbled to her box and coaches, with whom she shares a great relationship filled with laughter and banter, as she made her way to the net for the customary handshake – or hug in this case. The 27-year-old then smacked her racket on the ground and walked off to the locker room.""There definitely was a bit of frustration because I was so close to achieve [achieving] something crazy. When you're out there, you're fighting, but it seems like everything [was] going not the way you really want [it] to go. I just needed to throw those negative emotions at the end just so I could give a speech, not stand there being disrespectful. I was just trying to let it go and be a good person, be respectful,"" she said in the post-match media interaction with a laugh. ""I was stand [standing] there and just was like, ‘Okay, c'mon, you've been in her position. She deserves that. She was [a] better player than you.' Just, you know, it was tough,"" added Sabalenka.During the first set and start of the second, Sabalenka would look at her box repeatedly, mumble something, and continue. Things were not going her way and Keys deserved most of the credit for that. If the serve was faltering, it was because it had come under the pump from the word go. The American, who had won the Australian Open warm-up event in Adelaide, had come out quickly off the blocks and was sending deep groundstrokes to counter Sabalenka's game of dominating proceedings with her sheer power. The Belarusian, who has three major titles on hard courts, looked clueless.She later said, at this point in her career, it was ""trophy or nothing"".""Nobody remembers the finalist, you know? Nobody puts, like, next to the winner [the] finalist's name,"" she said with a smile. ""I mean, at this point, yeah, I go for titles. But, of course, I have to be proud of myself with the finals, three finals in the row. That's something crazy. I hope that next year I'll come back as a better player, and I'll hold Daphne one more time,"" she stated.",Madison Keys beat Aryna Sabalenka in straight sets to win Australian Open. The World No. 1 became the fourth Grand Slam winner of her career. Keys is the first woman to win the title in Melbourne since Martina Hingis in 1999.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117575700,imgsize-172866,width-400,resizemode-4/117575700.jpg"

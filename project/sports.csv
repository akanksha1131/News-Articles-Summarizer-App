Heartwarming scenes were witnessed at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on Sunday, when India's latest Test centurion Nitish Kumar Reddy 's father, Mutyala Reddy , bowed to batting legend Sunil Gavaskar and touched his feet.The moments from Reddy family's meeting with Gavaskar were captured on video and went viral on social media.Overwhelmed, Gavaskar hugged Nitish's father as the 21-year-old cricketer's mother and sister looked on.Nitish made the headlines on Saturday by scoring a well-deserved century to bail India out of trouble on the third day of the fourth Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.The Reddy family had made the trip to Australia for the match in Melbourne, and Nitish didn't disappoint them, coming up with his best innings of the tour so far.His hundred and a 127-run partnership for the eighth wicket with fellow all-rounder Washington Sundar brought India back in the match as the visitors finished the day at 358 for 9 after being 221 for 7 at one stage.On Sunday, Australia took the remaining one wicket of the Indian innings quickly to wrap up the visitors for 369 and take a healthy 105-run lead.Nitish was the last wicket to fall, dismissed by off-spinner Nathan Lyon for 114, which included 11 fours and a six.The century took Nitish's tally of runs in his debut Test series to 293 in 6 innings, which is the highest among Indian batters. Australia's Travis Head leads the list with 409 runs.","India's latest Test centurion Nitish Kumar Reddy's father, Mutyala Reddy, bowed to batting legend Sunil Gavaskar and touched his feet.

Washington Sundar: 'Nitish Reddy is fire, not flower; he killed it today'

NEW DELHI: Australia captain Pat Cummins was left perplexed after the third umpire overturned what appeared to be a legitimate dismissal on day four of the Boxing Day Test at the MCG.While attempting to wrap up India’s first innings, Cummins delivered a full-length delivery to Mohammed Siraj , which seemed to produce an edge caught by Steve Smith at second slip.The Australians celebrated, but on-field umpire Michael Gough referred the decision to third umpire Sharfuddoula Saikat to confirm whether it was a bump ball.Third umpire Sharfuddoula ruled Siraj not out, stating, ""I can see the ball after hitting the back, I am satisfied.""The decision left Cummins and his team visibly confused.Cummins approached on-field umpire Gough to request another review of the footage, but both Gough and fellow umpire Joel Wilson declined his appeal, allowing Siraj to continue batting.The decision also left former cricketers Adam Gilchirst and Ravi Shastri confused.""This is very interesting. I have never seen this before. He is saying, 'You, as umpires, took it upstairs on your own behalf, but I want to review the decision.' I do think it needs to be looked at very closely,"" Gilchrist said on air.""The umpire said I've seen the ball bounce after it hit the bat. That was a very quick call, a very quick call, just two replays,"" Shastri said.The controversial call ultimately had little impact, as Australian offspinner Nathan Lyon dismissed centurion Nitish Kumar Reddy shortly afterward for 114.India’s innings ended at 369 in 119.3 overs, trailing Australia’s first-innings total by 105 runs.",Australia captain Pat Cummins left perplexed after third umpire overturns what appeared to be legitimate dismissal.

World No. 1 chess player Magnus Carlsen withdrew from the World Rapid and Blitz Chess Championships in New York after a dress code dispute.Carlsen was wearing jeans, which violated the International Chess Federation ( FIDE ) dress code. He was asked to change his attire. FIDE officials fined Carlsen $200 (192 euros) after he refused to change his jeans. FIDE released a statement explaining that their dress code rules are in place to maintain professionalism and fairness for all participants.They cited a previous instance where another competitor was fined for wearing sports shoes.

He currently holds the title in both rapid and blitz chess formats.“I put on a shirt, jacket and honestly like I didn't even think about jeans, even changed my shoes,” he reasoned later.Carlsen explained his perspective on the situation in an interview with the chess channel Take Take Take. He stated that he hadn't even considered the jeans to be an issue. He had even changed his shoes.“First of all, I got a fine which is fine, and then I got a warning that I would not be paired if I didn't go change my clothes.

NEW DELHI: Australia opener Sam Konstas may have declared that Virat Kohli is his favourite player in the world and given the Indian batting superstar the clean chit over his shoulder-bump, but things are different when it comes to on field action.The first day of the Boxing Day Test between India and Australia at the Melbourne Cricket Ground was just not about Konstas' dazzling debut, but also his on-field confrontation with Kohli.Virat was fined 20 percent of his match fees and given a demerit point by the ICC for a Level One breach of the ICC code of conduct as a result of that incident.However, the 19-year-old home debutant downplayed the incident, claiming the Indian superstar had bumped into him by accident.In the Indian first innings, Virat batted patiently in his 86-ball stay at the crease accumulating 36 runs and looked totally focused to not to fall to the trap outside the off-stump.There were many instances when Virat left deliveries bowled by Mitchell Starc outside the off-stump and giving the Aussie pacer a smile.But Virat ran out of patience after his mix-up with Yashasvi Jaiswal that resulted in the Indian opener's run out for 82.The Aussies finally had the last laugh as Kohli edged a Scot Bland delivery for wicket-keeper Alex Carey to take a simple catch again losing the game of patience.And now a video is viral on the internet that shows how Konstas celebrated after the dismissal of the former Indian captain.In the video, Konstas is showing asking the MCG crowd to cheer on the dismissal, much like Virat does when he asks the crowd to cheer the Indian bowlers.The Kohli-Konstas on-field rivalry is emblematic of cricket's beauty-where established stars and young challengers push each other to new heights.

NEW DELHI: India placed their hopes on Rishabh Pant on Day 3 of the fourth Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, expecting the star wicketkeeper-batter to steer the team out of a challenging situation. While Pant initially looked in great touch, he soon gifted his wicket to Australia in a moment of poor judgment.The turning point came in fast bowler Scott Boland 's over.Pant attempted a pick-up lap over fine leg but missed, with the ball striking him on the stomach, causing visible discomfort.On the very next delivery, instead of taking time to recover, Pant walked across the off-stump and premeditated another lap shot.

MELBOURNE: In just a few seconds, hope gave way to despair here at the 'G'.India appeared to be scripting a great escape when everything unravelled dramatically with stumps in sight. Yashasvi Jaiswal , man of the hour, batting in supreme touch, had been looking fidgety since reaching the half-century mark. Having moved into the eighties, he whipped Scott Boland to mid-on and immediately set off for the run.It was Jaiswal's call, but it was still a tight run. At the other end, Virat Kohli , who had been displaying the kind of discipline which has deserted him in recent times, hopped out as if in response, then immediately turned his back and started ball watching.Faced with having to make that split-second choice, Jaiswal opted for the brain freeze and kept running towards disaster.Having put on 102 fluent runs in pursuit of Australia's steep 474 and rotated strike well till that point, the partnership was blossoming. It even seemed Australia's relentless pace attack had a fight on their hands.By the time Pat Cummins threw the ball in, both batters were stranded at the non-striker's end. The Aussie fielders swooped in like pall bearers of gloom. Cummins missed the stumps but wicketkeeper Alex Carey collected the ball, ran in and whipped off the bails at the striker's end. The fight went out of India.Jaiswal, the man with the penchant for the daddy hundreds, stormed off after gesticulating at Kohli, who expressed helplessness. In walked Akash Deep as nightwatchman, another strange decision by India. Kohli, by now, was distraught, his focus shot to pieces. Boland's next over, first ball, he committed the cardinal sin that has dogged him for a while now: fishing at the fifth-stump line.All afternoon, he had left the ball with supreme anticipation and rare self-control, so much so that Australia had to change their plans for him. Boland cleverly revived the idea. Kohli lunged with the bat, the ball found the edge and Carey was back in action.The dismissal made for the unlikely sight of Kohli trudging off to loud boos from a record Day Two crowd of 85,147 spectators, There was to be more unsavoury drama in store. Kohli, having just copped a fine for shoulder-barging Sam Konstas on Day One, has replaced Mohammed Siraj as the Australian media's enemy No. 1, with some tabloids putting headlines like 'Clown Kohli' on the cover and photo-shopping a ball on to his nose.He had come out looking like the guilty party in the run-out too, and the boos followed him as he entered the dressing room. Kohli walked back out, incensed, and seemed interested in a confrontation when security guards stepped in to defuse the situation.Thirteen balls after the Kohli dismissal, Akash Deep, having had a torrid time against Starc, fended awkwardly at a short one from Boland. The ball careened from the inside edge of his bat to the thigh pad to leg gully's hands. India had lost three wickets for six runs and eventually ended Day Two of the fourth Test at 164/5, still trailing by 310 runs, with Rishabh Pant and Ravindra Jadeja left to pick up the pieces on the third morning.Before that run-out, Jaiswal was batting like a dream in favourable conditions. Answering India's call, the man with the penchant for the daddy hundreds appeared to be coasting along against the quicks. With edges not carrying, he unfurled some bold strokes, a couple of good-looking drives and pulls and some excitable ramp shots over the slip cordon.Jaiswal had walked out to bat with Rohit Sharma , who returned to open but found the runs had still chosen not to follow. Demoted to No. 3, KL Rahul unleashed some exquisite drives until a peach of a leg-cutter from Cummins sneaked through, bringing the resolute Kohli to the middle.It isn't an easy time to be Kohli right now, unlike the batting great on the other side, Steve Smith , who rediscovered form with his second consecutive hundred, his 34th Test ton and the 11th against India. After fighting it out in Brisbane and finding some luck along the way, Smith eventually rediscovered his touch and fluency here at the MCG.Having ended Day Two batting on 68, he knocked off the 32 required with minimum fuss on the second morning. Not that it was much of a challenge, with India having begun the day on a bad note as well. Their bowling looked pedestrian apart from Bumrah, who for a while troubled Smith. The fielding was listless and the captaincy uninspiring at times.Smith added 112 brisk runs with Cummins, adding 31 runs in the first seven overs and 60 off the first 14. He hooked Bumrah for six to get into the nineties before a cracking cover drive off Nitish Kumar Reddy got Smith to three figures.Only the bizarre manner of his dismissal, charging down to Akash Deep and dragging one on, would have rankled the perfectionist.It was Smith and Australia's day, and India now find themselves staring at the abyss in this Test. Unless, of course, Rishabh Pant decides it's a good time for another miracle.","Yashasvi Jaiswal and Virat Kohli had put on 102 fluent runs in pursuit of Australia's steep 474.

FOLLOW-ON RULE

This rule is governed by Law 14 of the

MCC Laws of Cricket

:

NEW DELHI: India found themselves in a challenging position, trailing by 230 runs with only three wickets in hand (244 for 7) at lunch on Day 3 against Australia (474) in the Boxing Day Test .India still need 111 more to avoid the follow-on — a scenario that seemed unlikely on such a placid batting track.The unbeaten pair of Rishabh Pant and Ravindra Jadeja face the critical task of negotiating the morning session. Their survival at the crease is vital to prevent India from falling into a difficult situation.As per article 14.1.1 of MCC's laws of cricket, in a two-innings match of 5 days or more, the side which bats first and leads by at least 200 runs shall have the option of requiring the other side to follow their innings.Australia amassed an impressive total of 474 runs in their first innings. Should India be dismissed for a score of 274 or below, the home side could potentially enforce the follow-on. However, if India reach 275 runs, Australia will lose the right to enforce the follow-on and will have to bat in the second innings.The follow-on rule is basically used to enforce a batting team's second innings immediately after their first innings in Test cricket if they fail to score a minimum threshold in comparison to the opponent's first innings total.14.1 Lead on first innings14.1.1 In a two-innings match of 5 days or more, the side which bats first and leads by at least 200 runs shall have the option of requiring the other side to follow their innings.14.1.2 The same option shall be available in two-innings matches of shorter duration with the minimum leads as follows:- 150 runs in a match of 3 or 4 days- 100 runs in a 2-day match- 75 runs in a 1-day match14.2 NotificationA captain shall notify the opposing captain and the umpires of his/her intention to take up this option. Once notified, the decision cannot be changed.By enforcing the follow-on, Team A makes Team B bat their second innings immediately, skipping Team A's second innings. This strategy is often employed when time is limited or when the pitch is deteriorating, giving Team A a better chance of winning.The decision to enforce the follow-on rests solely with the fielding captain, making it a strategic choice based on match conditions.","Rishabh Pant and Ravindra Jadeja face the critical task of negotiating the morning session.

(Photo by Martin Keep/AFP via Getty Images)

MELBOURNE: Captain Rohit Sharma may still be calling the shots on the field but as a Test batsman, he finds himself in a very lonely place right now. After Friday's failed attempt to recover from a prolonged slump by reclaiming his regular opening slot, the talk over his immediate future in the format is likely to get louder.On the second day of the fourth Test against Australia, Rohit walked out to bat with Yashasvi Jaiswal for the first time in the series. He only managed three runs off five balls, adding to a growing list of single-digit scores over his past few Tests, both at home and away.The manner of his dismissal, too, was bizarre - a leading edge off a tentative half-pull suggesting he was caught in two minds whether to go for the shot or leave the delivery from counterpart Pat Cummins alone.Perhaps Rohit is unable to trust his muscle memory, a common feature in batters who suffer prolonged run droughts, because he is one of the best exponents of the pull shot otherwise. Perhaps the mind is muddled. Perhaps he could do with a break?In his past 14 Test innings, Rohit averages 11.07 with one half-century. His scores read 6 and 5 in Chennai, 23 and 8 in Kanpur (both against Bangladesh), 2 and 52 in Bengaluru, 0 and 8 in Pune and 18 and 11 in Mumbai (all against New Zealand). On this Australia trip, after missing the first game in Perth, Rohit has batted at No. 6 in Adelaide and Brisbane, scoring 3, 6, and 10 across three innings before Friday's return to the opening slot.Where is Rohit Sharma the Test batsman of 2021, whose memorably constructed second-innings 127 fashioned victory for India at the Oval against England?India need Rohit back at his exhilarating best to retain the Border-Gavaskar Trophy , but for the moment the issues are about his presence affecting the balance of the XI. India won the first Test of the series in Perth under Jasprit Bumrah 's captaincy when Rohit was on paternity leave, with KL Rahul opening instead and playing a significant role in that win.Not wanting to disturb a combo which has just won India an away Test, Rohit, when he returned as captain, agreed to take Rahul's usual middle-lower spot at No. 6 for the next two games. It seems he has not been unable to adjust to the role. Many experts and former captains have also been clamouring for him to return to the top and face the new ball.Perhaps all the chatter just got to Rohit. For the ongoing fourth Test, the in-form Rahul, who looked in good touch on Friday, was pushed down to No. 3 so Rohit could open. The regular No. 3, Shubman Gill , was dropped and a spin-bowling allrounder, Washington Sundar , was instead drafted in.India have failed to pick pacers to support Jasprit Bumrah and instead packed the side with allrounders to provide more batting depth in tough Australian conditions. With the runs not consistently flowing from Virat Kohli's blade either, the pressure has been on the lower middle order to pull off rescue acts.On Friday, after Rohit's dismissal, former India captain Sunil Gavaskar said on air here, ""(These are) tough times for him. There will be a second innings (here) and two more in Sydney. Questions will be asked if he doesn't score in those three innings.""Former Australia captain Ricky Ponting, who has always been an advocate for Rohit opening, expressed concern at the manner of his dismissal. ""That's just a lazy, not switched on, not up for the moment type of shot,"" Ponting said. ""He's been known as one of the best hookers and pullers of the ball since he made his debut but that's just not there. It's nothing. It's not committed, not really looking to be aggressive. He's just looking to tap it on the head.""Then there's the Ashwin factor. The famed off-spinner, one of India's greatest ever match-winners, retired in a huff after the Brisbane Test, ostensibly because he was not picked over Washington Sundar in Perth and not guaranteed a place in the XI for the Melbourne and Sydney Tests. Ashwin refused to be a passenger and left the squad immediately. If a player of his stature could be given the nudge, can the captain be above reproach?At 37, Rohit is at the backend of a glorious career and there are fears he could be in terminal decline as a batsman. In Australia, he'll be hoping a few more innings at the top will help him recover some semblance of his old prolific self. Else, chairman of selectors Ajit Agarkar and head coach Gautam Gambhir may need to have a serious conversation with India's captain. Failure in the second innings of the Boxing Day Test will raise speculation to fever pitch.","Rohit Sharma has failed to recover from a prolonged slump as a Test batsman. The 37-year-old has scored just 11 runs in his past 14 Test innings. The manner of his dismissal, too, was bizarre - a leading edge off a tentative half-pull.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116729291,imgsize-39860,width-400,resizemode-4/116729291.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Indian cricket legend Sunil Gavaskar weighed in on young batter Yashasvi Jaiswal ’s unfortunate run-out during the Boxing Day Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG).Speaking on Star Sports, Gavaskar explained that the mix-up between the India opener and Virat Kohli could have been avoided hadn't the former spent his seconds watching the fielders.""It would have been a quick run, and somebody like Virat Kohli would definitely have made it. But the thing was, he looked at the fielder. When you look at the fielder, when you turn, you've lost that vital second. And so naturally, you then think, 'No, I want to be able to make it.' Your balance is completely off. And it would have been a tight run. I think at that stage, why do you need to take a run that carries an element of risk? You're batting well, runs are coming,"" Gavaskar remarked.""At that stage, the risk was not really necessary. But it could have been completed only because Kohli is such a fantastic runner between the wickets.""Before the run-out, Jaiswal had been anchoring the Indian innings brilliantly, amassing 82 runs off 118 balls with 11 fours and one six.The talented opener seemed poised for a major milestone as he neared a well-deserved century.However, disaster struck late in the day as a mix-up with Kohli led to his dismissal.The incident unfolded when Jaiswal drove a full delivery from Scott Boland to mid-on and set off for a quick single.Kohli, however, held back, momentarily ball-watching. Pat Cummins pounced on the opportunity with a direct throw attempt that missed, but 'keeper Alex Carey capitalised on the chaos, collecting the ball and completing the run-out.The dismissal proved costly, triggering a mini-collapse in the Indian batting lineup. From a strong position at 153/2, India stumbled to 164/5 by stumps on Day 2.Nightwatchman Akash Deep fell for a duck, and the visitors faced a daunting deficit of 310 runs, with 111 needed to avoid the follow-on.",Yashasvi Jaiswal was run-out by Virat Kohli on Day 2 of the Boxing Day Test. Indian legend Sunil Gavaskar believes the mix-up could have been avoided. India were bowled out for 164 in their first innings at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116715363,imgsize-47966,width-400,resizemode-4/116715363.jpg"

Washington Sundar: 'Nitish Reddy is fire, not flower; he killed it today'

HYDERABAD: When Nitish Kumar Reddy knelt down at the Melbourne Cricket Ground to celebrate his century against Australia on Saturday, he stood taller than a giant. It was also his way of telling the world where he came from — the land of Telugu movies or Tollywood — which shapes popular culture in the two Telugu states of AP and Telangana.The third youngest centurion for India in Australia at 21 years and 216 days — after Sachin Tendulkar in 1992 and Rishabh Pant in 2019 — celebrated his 50 'Pushpa' style — airbrushing his beard with the iconic 'jhukega nahi'. But after hitting his century, he became 'Bahubali' — the hero laying his helmet on his bayonet, showcasing his commitment to a cause. A killi (paan) after a hearty dinner and a movie are a part of life in Andhra, and with his celebrations, Nitish paid tribute to what defines swag for many youngsters in this region.The 21-year-old Andhra lad from the port city of Visakhapatnam is the toast of the nation after his gutsy, rearguard innings saved India the ignominy of a follow-on at the MCG on Saturday.Nitish's father, who travelled for this Test match, said, ""I was very nervous and thought he would miss the century when Washington and Bumrah got out. Even in the previous Tests when he scored a couple of 40s, we were disappointed that he missed his halfcentury. Today, when Bumrah got out, I thought he had missed the century. But thank God, he made it. For us as a family, it was the most joyous feeling when he played in the Indian Premier League and the Andhra Premier League. He then went on to play for India in T20Is. Now, coming to a foreign soil and scoring this century for the country in Test format is unbelievable. I don't have words to express this feeling,"" Mutyala Reddy told TOI from Melbourne.Reddy senior recounted Nitish's hard road to success: ""We used to travel 30 km from Gajuwaka to Port Stadium at 5 am each day. It was possible because of my wife Manasa who used to get everything ready before time. She supported us despite not knowing anything about the game.""Nitish's father had to leave a steady job with Hindustan Zinc Ltd. in Visakhapatnam as he was transferred to Udaipur. Instead, he heeded the call of coaches Kangani Kumaraswamy and A Krishna Rao as it would've affected Nitish's training. He opted for early retirement instead. ""We struggled financially after I left the job. It was tough to manage the family. We sailed through with our savings, but we made sure Nitish got all the support,"" he said.""I don't know English well. But when everyone in the stands and so many Australian fans congratulated me, I could not control my joy. Even (Adam) Gilchrist congratulated me. I am over the moon,"" he added.The uncertainty over his selection and visa formalities delayed his arrival in Australia before the MCG Test, but Nitish's father was delighted by his son's achievements in 2024. ""For Nitish, 2024 is a golden year. He has made us very proud. We got very emotional speaking to him after the day's play.""Reddy senior also thanked the Bharat Army who invited him to their celebrations. ""We got our family pass and were in our designated area. But the Bharat Army fans came and took me to the boundary. When Nitish scored a century, we had a blast,"" he said.","The 21-year-old Andhra lad from the port city of Visakhapatnam is the toast of the nation after his gutsy, rearguard innings saved India the ignominy of a follow-on at the MCG on Saturday.

Allrounder Reddy announces his presence with maiden century as his partnership with Washington brings India back in the Test

Nitish Kumar Reddy's family reacts to his maiden Test century at MCG

Washington Sundar: 'Nitish Reddy is fire, not flower; he killed it today'

MELBOURNE: It didn't matter if you were Indian or Australian at Melbourne Cricket Ground on Saturday. As Nitish Kumar Reddy played an exquisite on-drive to get to his maiden Test hundred , then struck a pose straight out of the blockbuster Bahubali — he'd earlier done the famous 'Pushpa' move after reaching 50 — there was many a moist eye in the stadium.That included the man who had sacrificed nearly everything to ensure Reddy could play cricket, his father Mutyala, who was seen weeping tears of joy and looking skywards to thank his gods.As Reddy celebrated, all 83,073 spectators rose as one, roaring in approval. This was history in the making, the birth of India's next big batting star, forged under the most trying circumstances.Reddy is a movie buff but sport is real, not reel. And yet, he's living out a script of his dreams.Nitish Kumar Reddy came in to bat at No. 8, a strange position for someone of his composure and batting ability, a position no doubt necessitated by the rocky form of some superstars from a previous era. The tail needed to be packed with as much batting firepower as Rohit Sharma 's faltering team could muster at the G on Saturday, the third day of the fourth Test against Australia.Reddy arrived at the crease after Rishabh Pant had thrown his wicket away by playing a bizarre stroke, leaving the team in deep, deep trouble at 191/6 in response to Australia's massive first-innings 474. India still needed to avoid a potential follow-on.Thirty runs later, senior partner Ravindra Jadeja too was gone, setting the stage for Indian cricket's Gen Next to script a turnaround for the ages. Enter Reddy's able ally on the day, Washington Sundar , who blunted Australia's relentless attack with his broad blade, scoring just one boundary during a half-century knock as Reddy at the other end exhibited temperament, poise, discipline and a range of strokes remarkable for someone who made his Test debut in this very series in Perth, four Tests ago.Washington is close to Reddy, has previous experience of playing a key role with the bat in Australia, in the Gabba heroics of 2021, and the pair put on 127 runs in 47.5 overs. They took full advantage of some favourable batting conditions and a relatively docile pitch. Australia simply didn't see it coming.Reddy started positively as usual but wasn't needlessly adventurous, leaving the ball sensibly and impressing with his good shot selection, nimble footwork against Nathan Lyon's off-spin, wristy strokes and some pristine drives. Australia squeezed the runs and bowled dry, more so after a rain break made the pitch sticky, but they just couldn't dislodge Reddy.His controlled defiance and Washington's patience ensured that by the end of the day, the duo had blunted the second new ball, picked up the pieces and reignited India's campaign in this series. Lyon dismissed Washington at the end with Reddy on 97, and that was when things got tense. With tailender Jasprit Bumrah coming in, Reddy was forced to refuse a few singles. Off the last ball of a Boland over, the 113th of the innings, an increasingly edgy Reddy drove airily over cover in a bid to retain the strike. For some inexplicable reason they ran back for two, leaving Reddy stranded on 99 and unable to take strike.Pat Cummins took only three balls to crack open Bumrah's defence, bringing Mohammed Siraj to the crease. You could hear a pin drop at the 'G'. Three balls to negotiate. Cummins beat Siraj first ball, then bowled a bouncer which Siraj ducked under. Siraj defended the third ball safely. The stadium exploded. Three more balls in Boland's next over and Reddy had breached the three-figure mark. He had faced 19 deliveries in his nervous 90s and emerged triumphant.It was the sort of knock which will resonate for decades to come, and no doubt many here who went back with a tear in their eye and a gulp in their throat will tell their grandchildren, “I was there when Nitish Reddy scored his first Test ton.” Even the beer-guzzling, rain-drenched Australian nationalist, the kind who has made it a habit of abusing visiting sides all day long, left shaking his head in amazement and muttering under his breath.It was an incredible fightback but India are not out of the woods yet, of course. They took stumps on Day Three still trailing by 116 runs, and only one wicket left standing. Reddy is still out there, batting on 105, and will probably look to belt a few around the park come Sunday.It was what Reddy did on the third day of the fourth Test, though, that will go down as the stuff of legend. As the tears poured out of Mutyala and the on-field celebrations ended, the heavens opened as if on cue and no further play was possible. Hopefully, the flame Reddy has lit will burn bright for years to come.",Allrounder scores maiden Test century at Melbourne Cricket Ground. Nitish Kumar Reddy and Washington Sundar put on 127 runs in 47.5 overs. Australia bowled out for 474 in their first innings on Boxing Day. India are now on 191-6 at stumps on the third day of fourth Test.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116757472,imgsize-87804,width-400,resizemode-4/116757472.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Cometh the hour, cometh Nitish Reddy . He first rescued India from a precarious position, bowled some overs, and then turned into a guide for India's No. 11, Mohammed Siraj The 21-year-old Reddy, who displayed tremendous resilience by scoring a determined 105 not out at number 8 to virtually save India on day three of the Boxing Day Test, was heard guiding Siraj from the non-striker's end on how to handle the Australian bowling attack.""Miyan bhai, off pe khade rehna. Bahar ka ball chhod do. Ghumega nahi. Ghum gya to fir kuch nahi kar sakte. Chhod do usse,"" Reddy was heard telling Siraj. [Stay on the off side. Leave the ball outside. It won't turn. If it turns, then there's nothing we can do. Just leave it.]Impressed by Reddy's sensational maiden century, former coach Ravi Shastri advocated for his promotion in the batting order, suggesting that a top-six position would provide better balance for India going into the fifth and final Test.""I feel that the way he's batted, this is the last time he will bat at 7,"" Shastri told Star Sports.""To get the balance of the side, you need him to go higher up the order, either 5 or 6, and then you have the opportunity of playing 5 bowlers to take the 20 wickets. He's given that kind of confidence to the selectors, the team management, and the captain.""India's batting has appeared fragile, especially with skipper Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, and Rishabh Pant struggling for runs in the five-Test series so far.Throwing his support behind Nitish, Shastri added, ""Reddy is fully capable of batting in the top 6. Then it changes the whole balance of the game.""You go to Sydney with him batting in the top 6, and you're playing five bowlers.""","Reddy scored 105 not out at number 8 to virtually save India on day three of the Boxing Day Test.

The law of averages caught up with Australia's opener Sam Konstas as early as the second innings of his Test career, when the teenager's stumps were rattled early on Day 4 of the fourth Test in Melbourne by Jasprit Bumrah -- the same bowler he had scooped for a six in his debut knock.Australia took the remaining one wicket of the Indian innings quickly on Sunday morning to wrap up the visitors' first innings for 369 and take a healthy 105-run lead. India's centurion, Nitish Kumar Reddy, was the last wicket to fall, dismissed by Nathan Lyon for 114. The offspinner ended with three wickets (3 for 96), the same as pacers Pat Cummins (3 for 89) and Scott Boland (3 for 57).The Indian bowlers began in a much more disciplined fashion, and Bumrah made the new ball count with the dismissal of Konstas in the 7th over. He followed his breezy 60 runs in the first innings by only 8 in the second.To rub a little further, Bumrah egged on the Indian fans in attendance to celebrate with loud cheers.The ball seamed in after pitching, moved a lot to find the gap between bat and pad, and hit the top of middle-stump to trigger celebrations in the Indian camp.Australia were 20 for 1 at the stage, which brought Marnus Labuschagne in to join Usman Khawaja.Later in the morning session, Mohammed Siraj struck to make it two down when he castled Khawaja for 21 to make it 43 for 2 in 19 overs.Australia led by 148 runs at that stage.","Australia take remaining one wicket of Indian innings quickly on Sunday morning to wrap up the visitors' first innings for 369 and take a 105-run lead.

NEW DELHI: Former cricketer Atul Wassan has voiced his concerns over India captain Rohit Sharma ’s recent struggles, pointing to a key mistake in his comeback strategy during the Border-Gavaskar Trophy . Wassan believes that Rohit’s decision to bat at number six, instead of his usual opening role, upon returning to the side in the second Test against Australia, has contributed to his dip in form.In just six months, Rohit has gone from being hailed as a hero for leading India to a T20 World Cup victory to facing scrutiny for his inconsistent performances.Rohit’s lean patch began in the two Tests against Bangladesh in September and persisted through the three-Test series against New Zealand on home soil. His struggles have continued during the ongoing series in Australia.After missing the first Test due to personal reasons, Rohit returned for the second Test in Adelaide, opting to bat in the middle order for the second and third matches before reverting to his opening role in the fourth Test.However, his return to the top of the order did not bring the expected turnaround.In the fourth Test, Rohit was dismissed for just 3 runs off 5 balls while attempting his trademark shot.Wassan believes Rohit’s decision to bat in the middle order disrupted his rhythm.“You can see the way he got out. Old Rohit would have hit it for a boundary. But this time, he stopped in the middle. His instinct said to hit it, but he felt he should not. He made the mistake of not opening when he returned,” Wassan told ANI.Former India cricketer Madan Lal also weighed in, acknowledging that Rohit’s dismissal while attempting one of his signature shots is symptomatic of his current form.“Questions will be raised. When you are not in form, you are not scoring runs, criticism will be there. On shots where he used to score fours and sixes, he got out while trying that shot. When you are out of form, such things happen. There are a couple of innings left, and I hope he scores runs,” Lal added.Rohit will be looking to make the most of the remaining opportunities to silence his critics and rediscover his form.","Former cricketer Atul Wassan has voiced his concerns over India captain Rohit Sharma ’s recent struggles.

NEW DELHI: India’s star wicketkeeper-batter Rishabh Pant came under fire after playing a risky shot that led to his dismissal during a crucial phase of Day 3 in the fourth Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground . Pant’s dismissal has once again highlighted the fine line between aggression and recklessness, with fans and experts divided on his high-risk style of play.Facing Scott Boland in the 56th over, Pant attempted an unorthodox falling scoop shot, which he inside-edged onto his stomach, causing him to fall to the ground. Australia’s skipper Pat Cummins had anticipated the move, placing fielders in the deep at fine leg and third man for such a scenario.To Pant’s misfortune, he repeated the same shot on the very next delivery, only to top-edge it to Nathan Lyon at deep third man. His dismissal for 28 off 37 balls left India struggling at 191/5, trailing Australia by 283 runs. While India managed to avoid the follow-on, the manner of Pant’s dismissal reignited debates over his shot selection in critical moments.Pant’s aggressive strokeplay has earned him a reputation for unorthodox run-scoring, but his decision in Melbourne drew sharp criticism, with legendary cricketer Sunil Gavaskar calling it a “stupid” shot.However, former India head coach Ravi Shastri defended Pant’s approach.“It’s not in every innings he has attempted that shot. Let’s look at the way he was dismissed in each innings; he got 2-3 really good deliveries. He got a really good delivery that left off the length in Adelaide; there was no way he played an attacking shot,” Shastri told Star Sports.“He got another one that left him, he was caught behind. Second innings in Adelaide, second ball of the day, he gets a good one from Starc and he nicks it. So, let’s calm down here, guys. It’s not every time he’s throwing it away. He got some good balls as well.”Shastri also acknowledged the need for Pant to adapt over time. “He had done the hard work. The field had spread out. That’s one aspect of his batting that has to change with time to come. He’s built up a reputation for himself. He comes to field, he smashes a boundary, and the field spreads. That’s the time when maturity should come in, knock the ball around, and take singles,” he said.“That was a high-risk shot. There was no doubt about that. The field was set, two fielders on the boundary pretty fine, a fly slip and a fine leg as well. Scott Boland was looking to ball up. It didn’t come off the face of the blade. Rishabh backs himself to get the face of the blade. If he had got that, it would’ve been a six. He was looking to clear the field; that’s his instinct and that’s the way he plays. You must remember that there are 1-2 players who take the game away,” Shastri added.","India's wicketkeeper-batter Rishabh Pant came under fire after playing a risky shot.

Even when I got hit with a bouncer, I just kept saying the same thing: 'Keep fighting.' That's what kept motivating me.""Reddy recounted a key moment during his innings as he approached the century mark. He was on 99 when Mohammed Siraj joined him at the crease. He acknowledged Siraj's encouraging words and positive attitude, which boosted his confidence in reaching the century milestone.""I was on 99 when Mohammed Siraj walked in to bat with three balls,"" remarked Reddy.""I know what mentality Siraj carries, and he was like, 'I will do it.' He was boosted up and said, 'Reddy, now it's your time,' and I was so happy,"" he added.At the close of play, Reddy remained unbeaten on 105, with India's score at 354 for 9.Reddy's innings was a testament to his desire to perform well on the Australian stage.""I wanted to perform well in Australia so that everyone would recognise me and what I am capable of. I let my bat do the talking. I was so thankful for the moment, and after it, I saw my father and he was crying. I always dreamed about making him proud.""Reddy's century came off 172 deliveries, including ten fours and one six. He reached the landmark with a four over mid-on off Scott Boland . Reddy described his emotional reaction upon reaching his century. He marked the moment by placing his bat and helmet alongside the Indian flag.""After my hundred, I was just planting my bat over there and keeping the helmet so the Indian flag was visible. I was planting my Indian flag and saluting it. Representing India is the biggest motivation, and I wanted to make this moment memorable.""Reddy's impressive debut series continued with his century.

1st Test: Pakistan bowlers strike back as South Africa in early trouble in 148-run chase,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/1st-test-pakistan-bowlers-strike-back-as-south-africa-in-early-trouble-in-148-run-chase/articleshow/116747979.cms,"(AP Photo)

Pakistan's opening bowlers Mohammad Abbas and Khurram Shahzad delivered three crucial strikes late on the third afternoon as South Africa began their chase of 148 runs to win the first Test at SuperSport Park on Saturday.South Africa finished the day at 27 for three, still 121 runs away from victory and a guaranteed spot in the World Test Championship final in England next June.Abbas bowled impeccably, taking two wickets for three runs in four overs of swing bowling. His victims were Tony de Zorzi and Tristan Stubbs. Shahzad also contributed, trapping Ryan Rickelton leg before wicket.Aiden Markram, South Africa's top scorer in the first innings, will start the fourth day on 22 not out. The hosts are facing a potentially tense final day.All three dismissals were leg before wicket decisions, and all three were reviewed by the batters.De Zorzi tried to negate the swing by batting outside his crease, the same tactic that led to his dismissal in the first innings. However, Abbas beat his inside edge, and he was given out.De Zorzi reviewed umpire Alex Wharf's decision. Replays confirmed the ""umpire's call"" with the ball projected to hit the stumps. He was dismissed for two runs.Rickelton was trapped leg before wicket by Shahzad without scoring.Stubbs added only one run before falling victim to Abbas. Pakistan successfully reviewed both decisions after the batsmen were initially given not out.The day's play concluded dramatically after a three-hour rain delay.South Africa appeared on course for victory after bowling Pakistan out for 237. Left-arm fast bowler Marco Jansen impressed with figures of six for 52. Saud Shakeel top-scored for Pakistan with 84.Resuming their innings at 88 for three, Babar Azam and Shakeel batted confidently, adding 65 runs in 14.5 overs.Babar reached his first half-century in 19 Test innings, scoring 50 before Jansen took three wickets in 14 balls. Babar's dismissal started the collapse when he edged a short ball from Jansen to deep point.Shakeel, the ninth man out, missed a full toss from Jansen after a composed innings of 113 balls, including 10 fours and a six. His dismissal ended Pakistan's innings.","South Africa finished the day at 27 for three, still 121 runs away from victory.

'The run out played on his mind': Madan Lal on Virat Kohli’s dismissal in Boxing Day Test,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/india-in-australia/the-run-out-played-on-his-mind-madan-lal-on-virat-kohlis-dismissal-in-boxing-day-test/articleshow/116747845.cms,"Australian players celebrates the wicket of India's Virat Kohli. (AFP Photo)

Former cricketer Madan Lal believes the run-out of Yashasvi Jaiswal , involving Virat Kohli , impacted Kohli's mindset during the fourth Border-Gavaskar Trophy Test at the MCG.On Day 2, with India at 51/2, Kohli and Jaiswal displayed impressive batting, forcing Australia's captain, Pat Cummins , to adopt a defensive approach.Jaiswal played aggressively, while Kohli remained disciplined, leaving deliveries outside the off stump. This tactic prompted Australian bowlers to bowl closer to his body.A turning point occurred when Jaiswal drove a ball straight to Cummins and called for a run. Kohli hesitated, while Jaiswal continued running.Cummins' throw towards the striker's end missed, but wicketkeeper Alex Carey collected the ball and dismissed Jaiswal.Shortly after, Kohli edged a Scott Boland delivery to Carey and was dismissed for 36 off 86 balls.While speaking to ANI, Madan Lal suggested the run-out affected Kohli's concentration.“Coming to Virat, he has scored a good 36 runs. I think that the run out played on his mind, and he lost his concentration. Whoever makes the mistake is on the mind of that person. That is where he lost his concentration.”Kohli has been troubled by deliveries outside the off stump in recent years, often edging to the slips or wicketkeeper.However, Madan Lal doesn't consider this a weakness.“This is not a weakness. A bowler exploits you. Australian bowlers bowl on such lines and lengths even if a batter has scored a century. They won't leave such lines.”Following Kohli's dismissal, Rishabh Pant and Ravindra Jadeja struggled on Day 3.India faced pressure, but Nitish Kumar Reddy (105-) and Washington Sundar (50) rescued the team.India ended Day 3 at 358/9, trailing Australia by 116 runs. The information was sourced from ANI.The partnership between Kohli and Jaiswal initially stabilized the Indian innings and frustrated the Australian bowlers.Jaiswal's aggressive approach complemented Kohli's more cautious style, putting pressure on the Australian bowling attack.The run-out incident seemed to disrupt the momentum that Kohli and Jaiswal had built.The dismissal of Jaiswal, followed quickly by Kohli's, put India in a precarious position.Madan Lal's analysis suggests that the run-out played a significant role in Kohli's dismissal.He believes the incident affected Kohli's focus, leading to the edge off Boland's delivery.Despite Kohli's vulnerability to deliveries outside the off stump, Madan Lal believes this is not a fundamental weakness in his technique.He attributes it to the Australian bowlers' skill in exploiting this tendency.Reddy and Sundar's partnership proved crucial for India, helping them recover from the earlier setbacks.Their contributions helped India reduce the deficit and maintain a competitive position in the match.The match remained closely contested, with the outcome still uncertain at the end of Day 3.","Former cricketer Madan Lal believes the run-out of Yashasvi Jaiswal impacted Virat Kohli's mindset during the fourth Border-Gavaskar Trophy Test at the MCG.

Lautaro back in the goals

Atalanta kept hold of top spot in Serie A on Saturday after escaping Lazio with a 1-1 draw which kept Inter Milan at bay but ended their club-record league winning streak at 11 matches.Marco Brescianini tapped home into an open goal with two minutes remaining to snatch a point from the Stadio Olimpico in Rome, where a passionate crowd thought a big win was coming their way.Instead Atalanta will end a historic year a point ahead of Inter, who have a game in hand, after the champions briefly drew level on points with a 3-0 win earlier at Cagliari .Europa League holders Atalanta will lead the league even if Napoli beat Venezia on Sunday and draw level on 41 points with Gian Piero Gasperini 's side who have a significantly better goal difference than the 2023 champions.Should two teams finish level at the top of Serie A come the end of the season they will face off in a single match to decide the destination of the Scudetto, which Atalanta have never won.""We struggled for long periods in the first half, but we were much better in the second,"" said Atalanta coach Gasperini.""This year has been the best year in Atalanta's history, let's hope we can make 2025 the same.""Atalanta showed great character to battle back from Fisayo Dele-Bashiru's 27th-minute goal which came in an intense opening period from Lazio.The away side were initially blitzed by Lazio, with Marco Carnesecchi making two sensational stops before Matteo Guendouzi curled a great strike off the post in the 11th minute.But as the match wore on, Atalanta, who were without injured star striker Mateo Retegui, grew into the game and deservedly drew level in front of a boisterous and hostile crowd in the Italian capital.Brescianini netted his third goal of the season thanks largely to Ademola Lookman, who made up for earlier missing from yards out by beating Lazio's offside trap, meeting Nicolo Zaniolo's hooked pass and rolling across to his teammate to salvage a precious point.Next up, Atalanta travel to play the Italian Super Cup in Saudi Arabia, where they will face Inter on Thursday.Lautaro Martinez ended an eight-match scoring drought at Cagliari, netting the second in an engaging contest in Sardinia which Inter won with second-half goals from the Argentina striker, Alessandro Bastoni and Hakan Calhanoglu.Inter have won their last five in Italy's top flight, scoring 19 and conceding just once, a burst in form which has re-established Inter as favourites to retain the Scudetto.The only thing missing for Inter were goals from captain Martinez, who hadn't scored since November 3 before he prodded home Nicolo Barella's cross in the 71st minute on Saturday.""The most important thing is that Inter win. If I get a goal too, then that's a bonus,"" said Martinez.""We work hard every day to win trophies and anyone who sets foot on the pitch will give their all for the team. We've just got to keep going and make 2025 like this year.""Inter could have won by an even more convincing margin had captain Martinez not wasted great chances in each half and Cagliari goalkeeper Simone Scuffet not pulled off superb saves to deny Marcus Thuram and Barella.But Martinez did net his seventh goal this season in all competitions and seven minutes later Calhanoglu made absolutely sure of the points from the penalty spot.Cagliari are just inside the relegation zone after a fourth consecutive defeat for Davide Nicola's side, a point behind Verona and Como who both play on Monday.",Atalanta draw 1-1 with Lazio at Stadio Olimpico in Rome.

NEW DELHI: 22-year-old Ivory Coast forward Amad Diallo has expressed his determination to ""make history"" with Manchester United despite the club's recent struggles under new manager Ruben Amorim .United have lost five out of Amorim's first 10 games in charge across all competitions, with recent defeats to Wolves, Bournemouth, and Tottenham increasing the pressure on the Portuguese manager ahead of Newcastle's visit to Old Trafford.Despite the team's dismal form, which has seen them languish in 14th place in the Premier League , just eight points above the relegation zone , Diallo has been one of United's few bright spots.He scored a late winner in the recent derby against Manchester City and has contributed two goals and six assists in the league this season.Diallo, along with other young players like Alejandro Garnacho, Kobbie Mainoo, Joshua Zirkzee, and Rasmus Hojlund, has set his sights on taking United back to the top.""We are part of the project, we have so many young players for this club, especially Garna (Alejandro Garnacho), Kobbie (Mainoo), Joshua (Zirkzee), Rasmus (Hojlund), me, we are young players who want to make history for this club,"" Diallo told MUTV.""We want to do our best every game. Sometimes it cannot work, but you can see in the pitch we are very focused to do our best for this club, because we want to bring back this club to the level it was before.""So, for the young lads, we just have to keep going, work hard and the most important thing is to listen to the old men, the old players, learn every day.""We have now a new manager, he likes to work with young players, and he brings a new system, so we just have to follow it and try to do our best every game.""""In football this can happen,"" he added.

NEW DELHI: Pep Guardiola has affirmed his commitment to Manchester City , dismissing speculation about his departure amidst the club's recent struggles.Guardiola recently extended his contract for two more years.Despite City's current poor form, Guardiola is determined to remain at the Etihad Stadium. The team has experienced a significant dip in performance, losing nine out of their last thirteen matches.The slump has led to questions about Guardiola's future with the club. Some have suggested he might leave if he can't reverse the team's fortunes.However, Guardiola, who has guided City to six Premier League titles in seven seasons, insisted he remains motivated to turn things around.""I will try, I will keep going. Sometimes you think the bad run will be ended earlier or it would be easier to fix it, but it takes more time,"" he said.""I will not give up. I want to be here. I want to do it and, with the situation that we have, we have to do it.""Of course I want it, everyone wants it. I don't want to disappoint my people in terms of the club, the fans, the people who love this club.""I think all of us in our job want to do it well and please the people. That is undeniable, not a question mark.""The biggest test is to come back again, but we have done that before.""Injuries have significantly hampered City's performance, contributing to their current seventh-place standing in the Premier League. Key players have been sidelined due to various injuries.Rodri, the Ballon d'Or winner, is recovering from a long-term knee injury. Other key players, including Ruben Dias, John Stones, Ederson, Kyle Walker, Jack Grealish, and Matheus Nunes, missed the recent draw against Everton.Even Erling Haaland, typically a prolific goal scorer, has struggled recently. He missed a penalty in the Everton match, extending his recent goal drought.Haaland has scored only once in his last seven games, but Guardiola refused to single him out for criticism. He emphasized his philosophy of not assigning blame to individual players.""I don't have it in my education to start complaining, to point at people. It's happened, it's life, it's football, so let's try it again,"" he said.""That's why we have had success, because always it is never enough, we will try it again and again and again. That's why we won a lot of titles.""Every three days it was a game and win, win, win for many, many months and years. Now we have to do the same when results are not good.""As City prepares to face Leicester City, several players are still recovering from injuries. Guardiola acknowledged the impact of injuries on the team's performance.""Sometimes you have injuries,"" Guardiola said. ""For how many years we were incredibly consistent but now, yes, we're a little bit down and the main reason is having so many important players injured.""But I saw the team spirit, how we trained this week, how focused they are, how they try to practise.""","Guardiola recently extended his contract for two more years.

The strike from Kai Havertz proved decisive as Arsenal secured a 1-0 victory against Ipswich , advancing to second position in the Premier League standings, while Bukayo Saka remained absent after his hamstring injury in the match against Crystal Palace last weekend.Arsenal's win reduced Premier League leaders Liverpool 's advantage to six points on Friday, as they capitalised on Chelsea's unexpected 2-1 loss to Fulham on Thursday to emerge as Liverpool's nearest rivalSaka, meanwhile, might not return until March due.Arsenal's manager opted to position Gabriel Martinelli on the right flank, typically occupied by Saka, whilst maintaining Gabriel Jesus as the central striker following his impressive tally of five goals in the previous two matches.Despite controlling much of the ball, the hosts struggled to create significant opportunities until the last 15 minutes of the contest.Arsenal experienced relief when Havertz scored at 23 minutes, following their previous frustrating 0-0 draw against Everton at the Emirates.Havertz netted his 12th goal of the season by directing Leandro Trossard's low cross into the upper part of the goal. But Jesus's strike with a clever shot through Arijanet Muric's legs from a difficult position was ruled as offside.Despite their well-known effectiveness from set-pieces, Arsenal failed to capitalise on their corner opportunities.Gabriel Magalhaes missed a straightforward chance when his header struck the outside of the post from close range.Ipswich displayed increasing ambition in the latter half, which also provided Arsenal more opportunities to counter-attack.Havertz squandered an excellent opportunity to score his second goal, whilst Muric produced another save from Mikel Merino's effort, ensuring a tense conclusion.Ipswich continue to occupy the penultimate position in the table, with a three-point gap separating them from safety.","Arsenal defeated Ipswich 1-0 in their Premier League clash.

Ruben Amorim expressed uncertainty about the timeline for Manchester United 's revival, emphasising his current focus on survival following a defeat to Wolves that marked the poorest beginning for any United manager since 1932.The 2-0 defeat at Molineux on Thursday established Amorim as the first United manager since Walter Crickmer in January 1932 to suffer five or more losses in his initial 10 matches.When questioned about the timeframe for his strategies to show results, Amorim stated, ""I have no idea. No idea. Instead of me trying to understand how much time it will take, just day by day.""He continued, ""Improving, trying to see the videos, using every minute of training and try to win some points because it's really important in this moment...""In this moment, we just have to survive and win some time to work on the team.""We already knew it.

NEW DELHI: Tennis star Nick Kyrgios has expressed his strong disapproval of the doping-related charges against top players Jannik Sinner and Iga Swiatek.As he prepares for his return to the court at the Brisbane International, Kyrgios has not held back in his criticism, labeling the breaches of the sport's anti-doping program as ""disgusting for our sport"".The International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA) has levelled charges against world No.1 Sinner and former world No.1 Swiatek.Sinner tested positive twice for an anabolic steroid in March but avoided a ban due to the ITIA's determination that he was not at fault. Swiatek, on the other hand, accepted a one-month suspension in November after testing positive for a banned substance.Kyrgios, known for his outspoken nature, has questioned the integrity of the sport, stating that the situation is a ""horrible look"" for tennis.“Two world No.1s both getting done for doping is disgusting for our sport. It’s a horrible look,” Kyrgios said. “Tennis integrity right now, and everyone knows it but no one wants to speak about it, it’s awful.”The Australian has also raised concerns about the handling of Sinner's case, questioning why his team waited several months before taking action after the alleged accidental contamination occurred.“I (pay) my team hundreds and thousands of dollars to be the professionals they are, to make sure that doesn’t happen,” Kyrgios said. “So they knew it happened. Why did they wait five to six months to do anything about it? He kept his team for five months … that doesn’t make sense.""“Someone like me … I would never even in my entire life ever try and dope in this sport,” he said. “Especially going through an injury like I went through, obviously there are things out there that could speed up healing, help me get back to prime level, help my recovery.“There’s so many things out there that are prohibited in our sport that I could have been doing to get me back quicker … (but) that’s just not who I am. I’m always against that.""As Kyrgios prepares for his first tour-level appearance since June 2023, he will face 21-year-old Giovanni Perricard of France in the first round in Brisbane. His return to the court will be closely watched, as he aims to make a successful comeback after being sidelined by career-threatening wrist and knee injuries.","Tennis star Nick Kyrgios has expressed his strong disapproval of the doping- related charges against top players Jannik Sinner and Iga Swiatek.

Former England captain Nasser Hussain couldn’t resist poking fun at fellow Sky Sports commentator Dinesh Karthik after a light-hearted on-air blunder during Day 4 of the fourth Test at Old Trafford.Hussain took a playful dig at Karthik for forgetting his microphone during a tea break chat with Ian Ward.“Dinesh Karthik, it’s been a long day and you’re new to this commentary gig. But I’d say your microphone is equally important,” Hussain said.He then turned his humour toward his former teammate Michael Atherton , adding, “Don’t worry, happens to the best. Atherton once tried to commentate using a coffee cup.”Karthik, who retired from all forms of cricket in 2024, has transitioned into commentary and coaching—now serving as Royal Challengers Bengaluru’s batting coach for IPL 2025.On the field, India clawed their way back after a nightmare start to the second innings, when Chris Woakes dismissed both Yashasvi Jaiswal and Sai Sudharsan in the opening over.From 0/2, Shubman Gill (78*) and KL Rahul (87*) steadied the innings with an unbroken 174-run stand for the third wicket.India began their innings trailing by a hefty 311 runs after England racked up a massive 669, powered by Ben Stokes ’ commanding 141 off 198 balls—his 14th Test century.India reached 174 for 2 at stumps—still 137 runs behind.Ravindra Jadeja was India’s most effective bowler, finishing with four wickets.","Former England captain Nasser Hussain poked fun at fellow Sky Sports commentator Dinesh Karthik after a light-hearted on-air blunder.

Multiple Indian batters with 500-plus in the same away Test series

Sunil Gavaskar (774) & Dilip Sardesai (642) vs WI, 1970-71

Shubman Gill (697) & KL Rahul (508) vs ENG, 2025

NEW DELHI: India captain Shubman Gill and opener KL Rahul scripted history on Saturday as they became the first Indian batting duo in 55 years to each score 500-plus runs in an away Test series — a milestone last achieved by legends Sunil Gavaskar and Dilip Sardesai in 1970-71.Their record-breaking partnership came at a crucial time for India during the fourth Test against England at Old Trafford, Manchester. Chasing survival after a brutal English assault powered by Ben Stokes' superb 141 and England's massive 669, India were rocked early — reduced to 0/2 in the very first over with both Yashasvi Jaiswal and Sai Sudharsan falling for ducks.But Gill (78*) and Rahul (87*) weathered the storm with a stunning rearguard action. The duo took India to 174/2 at stumps on Day 4, still trailing by 137 runs, but with momentum swinging back slightly towards the visitors.While anchoring India's hopes for a draw, both batters also etched their names into the record books. Gill’s tally in the series climbed to a staggering 697 runs, while Rahul breached the 500-run mark — becoming only the second Indian opener to do so in an away series after Gavaskar.This is only the second instance in Indian cricket history where two batters have scored over 500 runs each in a single away Test series. The previous occurrence was in 1970-71, when Gavaskar (774) and Sardesai (642) tore apart West Indies' bowling attack.Rahul also became just the second visiting Asian opener to score 500+ runs in a Test series in England after Gavaskar’s 542-run effort in 1979, and the first visiting opener since South Africa’s Graeme Smith (714 in 2003) to achieve the feat in the country in the 21st century.With one day remaining in the Test, Gill and Rahul’s historic partnership has given India hope — and a firm grip on the record books.","India captain Shubman Gill and opener KL Rahul scripted history on Saturday as they became the first Indian batting duo in 55 years to each score 500-plus runs in an away Test series.

Poll Do you agree with Mohammad Azharuddin's stance on bilateral matches? Yes, I completely agree. No, I disagree.

NEW DELHI: Former India captain Mohammad Azharuddin has stirred the ongoing India-Pakistan cricket debate with a bold take on the upcoming Asia Cup clash between the two nations, questioning the inconsistency in cricketing ties between the neighbours.India and Pakistan are set to face off on September 14 as part of the Asia Cup 2025 under the Asian Cricket Council (ACC).Speaking on the contentious fixture, Azharuddin remarked, “I always say that everything should happen, or if it does not happen, then it should not happen at all. If you're not playing bilateral matches, then you shouldn't play international events too — that's what I believe.”His remarks come amid continuing political tensions that have stalled bilateral series between India and Pakistan for years, even as the teams continue to face off in ICC and ACC tournaments.Azhar also addressed the recent withdrawal of Indian veterans from their Legends League fixture against Pakistan in the privately organised World Championship of Legends (WCL).“This is a matter for the board and the government,” he said.“The veterans' league is not official, it's not sanctioned by the ICC or the BCCI . It’s conducted privately. But the Asia Cup is a tournament governed by the ACC,” he clarified, distancing the WCL from official cricketing diplomacy.",Former India captain questions inconsistency in cricketing ties between the neighbours.

Poll Should Karun Nair have been given another chance in the fourth Test? Yes, he deserved a chance No, it was the right decision

Karun Nair’s long-awaited return to Test cricket after eight years was meant to be a fresh chapter—filled with big runs, vital partnerships, and a statement-making comeback. Instead, it turned into a struggle for form. Following a string of underwhelming performances in the first three matches, Nair was dropped from India’s playing XI for the fourth Test at Old Trafford.In six innings, the right-hander managed just 131 runs, prompting the team management to replace him with B Sai Sudharsan for the crucial fourth Test.India made three changes to their line-up in Manchester. Anshul Kamboj was handed a Test debut, while Sudharsan came in for Nair and Shardul Thakur replaced Nitish Kumar Reddy, who was sidelined due to a left knee injury.After Nair's exclusion, an emotional photo began circulating on social media, showing him being consoled by close friend and star cricketer KL Rahul The image quickly went viral, capturing what many assumed was the heartbreak of being dropped.However, a TimesofIndia.com fact-check revealed that the photograph was taken during the Lord's Test, not at Old Trafford.Nair’s comeback got off to a rocky start. In the first Test at Headingley, he was dismissed for a duck in the first innings and scored just 20 in the second.He retained his place for the second Test, posting scores of 31 and 26. A 40-run knock in the first innings of the third Test at Lord’s showed signs of promise, but he followed it up with a disappointing 14.With his spot under increasing scrutiny, captain Shubman Gill decided to leave him out for the fourth Test.Former India cricketer Mohammad Kaif criticised the decision, suggesting that Gill missed an opportunity to show leadership by backing a player in need.“Today was Shubman Gill's chance to back Karun who was down but deserved one more chance. He should have picked Karun Nair. Chance missed to earn the respect when it comes to making tough decisions as a leader,” Kaif posted on X.England currently lead the five-match series 2-1, following their dramatic 22-run win in the third Test at Lord’s.","Karun Nair was dropped from India’s playing XI for the fourth Test at Old Trafford.

Poll How do you feel about India's injury management in the current series? It's been poorly handled They are doing their best Injuries are part of the game I have no opinion

India’s growing injury crisis in the ongoing Test series against England deepened further after star wicketkeeper-batter Rishabh Pant suffered a painful blow to his toe in the first innings, ruling him out of wicketkeeping duties for the remainder of the fourth Test in Manchester.It was later revealed that Pant had fractured his toe, a significant setback for the Indian camp already grappling with a long list of fitness concerns.The injury occurred during India's batting at Old Trafford.Pant, who had an injury scare earlier in this series, was struck hard on the toe by a Chris Woakes delivery while batting in the opening innings. The impact was severe enough to sideline him from behind the stumps, with Dhruv Jurel stepping in as a makeshift wicketkeeper.Pant, however, was cleared to bat in the second innings, a confirmation that came directly from India’s batting coach Sitanshu Kotak on Saturday.“Rishabh Pant will bat tomorrow,” Kotak said at the end of Day 4, signalling that while his mobility behind the stumps may be compromised, the team will still count on his batting to help salvage a draw.India’s injury list in this series has grown increasingly concerning, with frontline pacers Arshdeep Singh and Akash Deep ruled out entirely.Pant’s setback adds another dimension to the challenge India face going into a pivotal Day 5 at Old Trafford.Despite the grim context, India showed signs of fight through the unbeaten partnership between KL Rahul (87 not out) and Shubman Gill (78 not out), who guided the visitors to 174/2 at stumps on Day 4, still trailing England by 137 runs.With Pant likely to come in at No. 5 or 6, his ability to bat through pain could be vital if India are to save the match and keep the series alive.",Rishabh Pant ruled out of remainder of fourth Test with fractured toe.

Poll Do you believe Ben Stokes will be fit to bowl on Day 5? Yes, he will be fit. No, he will not be fit.

TimesofIndia.com in Manchester: England batting coach Marcus Trescothick is hopeful captain Ben Stokes will be fit to bowl on Day 5 of the fourth Test at Old Trafford. Speaking after stumps on Saturday, Trescothick said Stokes’ absence from the bowling attack on Day 4 was a result of the cramp he suffered on Friday and the workload he's managed across the match.“It is just a build-up from the workload and the cramps yesterday,” Trescothick explained. “We are hoping he will be back to bowling tomorrow. We will see what he is like in the morning.”Stokes had earlier made a massive impact with the bat, scoring a superb 141 to help England post 669. That came after his five-wicket haul in India’s first innings, underlining once again his unmatched value to this England team.But with India staging a remarkable fightback through KL Rahul and Shubman Gill , England will likely need their captain to contribute with the ball again if they are to take the remaining eight wickets and wrap up the series.The visitors were reeling at 1 for 2 at lunch but recovered well to end Day 4 on 174 for 2, still trailing by 137 runs. The calm resistance from Rahul and Gill has set up a fascinating final day.With a series-leading 16 wickets, Stokes may need to join the attack if the hosts are to dismiss India in time to claim victory. As the leading wicket-taker of the series, England will once again need their captain to step up on the final day, especially if they are to seal the series without going to The Oval.","England captain Ben Stokes will not bowl on Day 5 of the fourth Test at Old Trafford.

Absolutely brilliant the way they batted. Rahul has been outstanding throughout the series,” he said.There was a brief moment of confusion when physios were delayed in attending to Rahul after he took a blow on the hand. Kotak clarified that “I don’t think the umpire denied it. He can’t say anything during the injury.”The coach confirmed that Rishabh Pant , who suffered a finger injury earlier in the match, will bat on Day 5.On India dropping Karun Nair, Kotak refused to delve into selection matters. “Coach Gautam Gambhir and captain Shubman Gill can talk about that. When Gill said we’ll back Karun, he would have meant as a batter. He didn’t do badly. He got starts.”India ended Day 4 on 174 for 2, still 137 behind.

Brief scores: India 1st innings: 358 all out & 174/2 in 63 overs

vs England: 669 all out in 157.1 overs

Nearly two days of insipid bowling, another frantic period before the Lunch break and India's Test, and series, seemed as good as over early on Day 4 at Old Trafford. The visitors faced just three overs before the umpires flipped the bails to mark the Lunch break but those few minutes were enough for Chris Woakes to send Yashasvi Jaiswal and Sai Sudharsan back. Off consecutive deliveries!0/2, trailing by 311 runs, almost a batter short due to Rishabh Pant's fractured toe and five sessions to survive. It was a terrible position to be in. The overhead conditions and the variable bounce further complicated matters. By no means were the conditions and pitch unplayable but the mental and physical fatigue of chasing leather for 157.1 overs was going to make survival an enduring task.The equation wasn't about runs, follow-on and lead but seeing off the period. Yeah, that's the basics and that's what Test cricket is all about but the stakes made it a very delicate passage in play. For a side which fancies winning from any position, England would have been licking their lips after seeing the back of the two Indian left-handers who got solid starts in the first innings.In came Shubman Gill to join KL Rahul minutes before Lunch and the immediate task was to see off the hat-trick ball, which he did, and then to ensure there were no more casualties. Both boxes ticked but it would have been a nervy walk back to the change room for both right-handers as the onus was now on them to delay what looked like an inevitable England win at that point.They, however, were ready with the response as fluency and urgency took over from the pre-Lunch frenzy. Gill dealt in boundaries and had a very Leeds-like start to his innings while Rahul continued to be solid from the other end. The Indian skipper was tested with full and swinging deliveries on to the stumps but he was ready with the response and hit some gorgeous boundaries down the ground - on either side of the wicket.86/2 at Tea, Gill scoring his fifty and Rahul growing in confidence injected much needed stability into the proceedings for India as they didn't lose a wicket and frustrated the hosts during the second session. 'Fluency' was the key word as Gill scored runs for fun when he raced to 45 off just 52 deliveries. Deep into the second session, precisely after being dropped by Liam Dawson, he decided to drop anchor. Nothing flashy and everything solid!His partner at the other end continued to be the cotton wool soaking in all the pressure and not giving the opposition an inch. The individual fifties were hit, many milestones - Gill becoming first Asian batter to score 650+ in a Test series in England and India's second 100+ stand after going 0/2 - reached and frustration began to creep in for the hosts.The bowlers were swapped, a short-ball trap was laid out with fielders placed for hooks, pulls, upper cut and ramp but Rahul and Gill were far too settled to fall into any temptation. With Ben Stokes deciding against bowling, possibly due to the niggle on Day 3, England clearly missed the magical touch after Woakes' double-wicket over and the pitch not playing any tricks, except the odd one keeping low, didn't pose any real challenge for the duo who had their eyes well in.The little over three days of the fourth Test weren't a reflection of how India have fared in the series so far but as Gill has maintained, the bad moments - Day 3 in particular - have been so bad that it has had a big impact on the scoreline.The same could be said about the third day and morning of the fourth but the rear guard act led by the captain and senior batter Rahul has ensured even the fourth Test, like the previous three, is set up for a delicious Day 5 finish.(Gill batting 78, KL Rahul batting 87; Woakes 2/48)(Joe Root 150, Ben Stokes 141, Ben Duckett 94, Zak Crawley 84; Ravindra Jadeja 4/143).",Shubman Gill and KL Rahul remained unbeaten on 78 runs at close of play on Day 4 of the fourth Test between India and England at Old Trafford.

Poll Do you think KL Rahul will continue his impressive form in future Test series? Yes, he's in great form No, it's just a phase Unsure, depends on conditions

Team India batter KL Rahul has entered the history books by becoming the first Indian opener in 46 years to score over 500 runs in an away Test series.His prolific contributions this summer have made him India’s second-highest run scorer in the series, trailing only captain Shubman Gill , and highlight a rare feat in the country’s recent Test history.Despite India finding themselves on the back foot at Manchester, still trailing by over 100 runs on Day 4 of the fourth Test after rallying from 1 for 2, KL Rahul has stood firm.When Yashasvi Jaiswal and Sai Sudharsan fell cheaply for ducks, Gill and Rahul steadied the ship with a vital partnership; Gill scored a vital half-century, while Rahul neared a solid century at Old Trafford.Across this five-match tour, Rahul’s consistency with the bat has shone through, especially in the face of relentless bowling attacks and challenging conditions.His tally surpasses all previous Indian opening efforts overseas in recent decades, marking a milestone that no opener had achieved since the 1970s.England dominated at Old Trafford, posting a mammoth 669 in their first innings, largely thanks to Ben Stokes’ exceptional all-round display: 141 with the bat and five wickets with the ball.That performance propelled England to a commanding 311-run lead.India’s top order collapsed under early pressure, though Gill and Rahul’s resilience offered glimmers of hope.Throughout the series, Rahul has been at the centre of India’s modest revival moments. His ability to bat with composure, conserve the innings, and build partnerships has been invaluable.While the series scoreline currently reads 2–1 in England’s favour, Rahul’s landmark achievement provides a beacon for Indian batting pride. His return of over 500 runs abroad in a single Test series is a testament to his class and adaptability under pressure.As India fight to save the Manchester Test, Rahul’s runs will remain among the few positive takeaways, an inspiring personal record amid a challenging series.","KL Rahul has become the first Indian opener in 46 years to score over 500 runs in an away Test series.

Legendary cricketer Sunil Gavaskar didn’t mince his words as he reacted to India’s dismal performance in the fourth Test against England at Old Trafford.Speaking on Sony Sports, the former India captain questioned the decision-making setup within the team, firmly placing responsibility on skipper Shubman Gill.“Look, I mean we didn't have coaches, we just had, you know, former players as managers or assistant managers of the team… they were not coaches but the kind of people you actually went up to and talked… they would give you some advice at lunchtime or at the end of the day's play or on the eve of the game. So it's difficult, you know, for me to get my head around the captains and the coaches combination,” Gavaskar said.The former captain noted that in his playing days, decisions rested with the skipper, not a team of analysts or coaches. “When I was captain we had nobody who was a former player to be honest. I had Commander Durrani once and I had Raj Singh Dungarpur. The only time was Irapalli Prasanna and he was brilliant.”His remarks come at a time when Team India is struggling to contain England’s dominance in the Test series. England, led by Ben Stokes’ stellar century and five-wicket haul, posted a mammoth 669 in their first innings.India, in reply, collapsed early in the second innings, losing openers Yashasvi Jaiswal and Sai Sudharsan for ducks, both dismissed by Chris Woakes within the first over.Drawing attention to team selections, Gavaskar made a pointed remark: “You can't say that he didn't want somebody like, you know, maybe in Shardul Thakur's case or Kuldeep Yadav's case... maybe Shubman didn't want Shardul in the team and wanted Kuldeep in the team. He should have had them in the team. He is the captain.”Gavaskar didn’t stop there. “He's going to be... I mean people are going to talk about him and his captaincy out there so it's got to be his call really. And I know for the sake of showing everything is hunky dory that these things might not come out. Fact is that the captain is the one who is responsible for the team. He's the one who's going to be leading those 11 players. Simple as that.”","Sunil Gavaskar questioned the decision-making setup within the team.

New Zealand secured a dramatic three-run victory against South Africa in the final match of the tri-series in Harare, Zimbabwe on Saturday, thanks to two spectacular catches by Michael Bracewell and Daryl Mitchell in the last over bowled by Matt Henry. The Black Caps, who posted 180-5 with Devon Conway and Rachin Ravindra both scoring 47, remained unbeaten throughout the tournament.Henry emerged as the tournament's highest wicket-taker with 10 wickets in four games, maintaining his composure in the crucial final over where he conceded just three runs. The dramatic finish came after Dewald Brevis brought South Africa within striking distance by hitting two sixes against Jacob Duffy in the 19th over.South Africa's chase began impressively with Lhuan-dre Pretorius scoring 51 and Reeza Hendricks contributing 37 in a 92-run opening partnership. However, they lost momentum after losing four wickets for 39 runs in the middle overs.Pretorius, playing his first notable innings of the tournament, hit two sixes and five fours before being stumped by Tim Seifert off Bracewell's bowling. Hendricks, van der Dussen, and Hermann were all caught in the outfield, leaving South Africa needing 50 runs from 29 balls.""It is a game of millimeters,"" van der Dussen said. ""The whole series was about trying things and experimenting a bit, and today settling on our strongest possible combination. We played a pretty good game.""New Zealand's innings was anchored by strong performances from Conway and Ravindra, while Seifert contributed 30 runs. The opening partnership between Seifert and Conway provided a solid foundation with 52 runs in the powerplay.South Africa's bowling attack, featuring Lungi Ngidi who took 2-24, along with effective spells from Nandre Burger and Kwena Maphaka, restricted New Zealand's scoring in the final overs. Ravindra's innings, which included two sixes and four fours, ended with a catch at deep mid-wicket.""Guys stepped up at different occasions...that is outstanding,"" New Zealand captain Mitchell Santner said. ""The guys were ready and clear on how to operate and that makes it easier.""The match concluded with two remarkable catches in the final over. Bracewell's catch at mid-wicket boundary dismissed the dangerous Brevis for 31, while Mitchell's full-length dive at long-on removed George Linde, securing victory for New Zealand.Zimbabwe, the host nation, finished the tournament without a win, losing all four matches, while New Zealand maintained their perfect record throughout the series.The game featured notable bowling performances from South Africa's Senuran Muthusamy, who claimed 1-27, and saw van der Dussen take a superb catch at short cover to dismiss Seifert.","New Zealand beat South Africa by three runs in the final match of the tri-series in Harare, Zimbabwe.

Lionel Messi and Jordi Alba of Inter Miami have been suspended by Major League Soccer for missing Wednesday's All-Star game, making them ineligible for Saturday's match against FC Cincinnati. The league announced the suspension on Friday, enforcing its policy that requires selected players to participate in the All-Star game unless they have valid reasons for absence.The duo withdrew from the showcase event early Wednesday without revealing their reasons. The game was set to feature a combined MLS team against players from Mexico's Liga-MX as part of the league's All-Star break.MLS rules mandate that players chosen for the All-Star game must participate unless they have a valid excuse, such as an injury.""Per league rules, any player who does not participate in the All-Star Game without prior approval from the league is ineligible to compete in their club's next match,"" the league stated.MLS Commissioner Don Garber described it as a challenging decision to enforce the suspension.""I know Lionel Messi loves this league. I don't think there's a player -- or anyone -- who has done more for Major League Soccer than Messi.I fully understand, respect, and admire his commitment to Inter Miami, and I respect his decision. Unfortunately, we have a long-standing policy regarding participation in the All-Star Game, and we had to enforce it. It was a very difficult decision.""Garber indicated the league would review its existing policy.""We're going to take a hard look at the policy moving forward. I'm committed to working with our players to determine how the rule should evolve.""The Commissioner acknowledged the demanding schedule Messi has faced, noting that the 38-year-old Argentine has played nine games in 35 days, including four FIFA Club World Cup matches.""Miami's had a schedule that is unlike any other team. Most of our teams had a 10-day break. Miami hasn't. So we have to manage through that as a league,"" Garber said.The situation had been anticipated when Miami coach Javier Mascherano expressed his preference for the players to rest instead of participating in the All-Star game.

The iconic Spanish midfielder and former Barcelona manager, was among the 170 applicants for the job.The application, sent from Xavi’s personal email and highlighted in green in the official shortlist, took officials by surprise. “Yes, Xavi’s name was there. The application was emailed to the AIFF,” national team director Subrata Paul told TOI earlier. However, the technical committee did not pursue his candidacy further due to the significant financial implications.Beyond Xavi, the federation received interest from a mix of coaches with some well-known in Indian circles and others with global pedigree. The list included former India coach Stephen Constantine, Slovakia’s Stefan Tarkovic, Liverpool legend Harry Kewell, ex-Blackburn boss Steve Kean, and familiar ISL faces such as Kibu Vicuna, Eelco Schattorie, and Khalid Jamil.

The technical committee of the All India Football Federation (AIFF) rubbed their eyes in disbelief when they saw the long list of candidates for the India coaching job.There were the familiar names like former national team coach Stephen Constatine, Liverpool star Harry Kewell, former Blackburn Rovers manager Steve Kean, India’s own Khalid Jamil, and coaches like Kibu Vicuna and Eelco Schattorie, whose work is known in the country. But at the bottom of a list prepared by AIFF’s national team director Subrata Paul, there was Xavi Hernandez.Marked in green, the former Barcelona coach and legend, someone who made more than 700 appearances for the Spanish giants, was shown to have sent the application from his own email ID. Unlike other shortlisted applications, the contact number column was blank.“It’s correct that Xavi’s name was there,” Paul toldon Thursday. “The application was emailed to the AIFF.”According to sources, the technical committee did not consider Xavi for the final shortlist due to the high financial cost. As player, the Spanish midfielder enjoyed a historic career, winning the FIFA World Cup in 2010 and two European championships. With Barcelona, he became the symbol of the club’s possession-based style of football and won 25 trophies, which includes eight La Liga titles and four Champions Leagues.Xavi kickstarted his coaching career with Al Sadd in Qatar, then returned to Barcelona as coach, but left after guiding the club to two trophies in two and a half seasons in charge, including the 2022-23 La Liga title.“Even if Xavi was genuinely interested in Indian football and could be convinced to take up the job, we would need a lot of money,” said a member of the technical committee who attended the virtual meeting on Wednesday.In a previous interview with The Athletic, Xavi said he “sometimes (follows) the Indian League because many Spanish coaches are there.”The technical committee has recommended three names to the AIFF executive committee to replace Manolo Marquez, who quit early this month. Jamil is the lone home-grown coach in the list, which also has Constantine, hoping for a third stint with the national team, and former Kyrgyzstan and Slovakia head coach Stefan Tarkovic.The shortlist was finalised by the technical committee chaired by former India captain IM Vijayan.

Two other Indians – Armando Colaco and Savio Medeira –held interim charges, following the sacking of Bob Houghton in 2011.“We had lot of applications, and after careful scrutiny, the technical committee has recommended three names to the executive committee,” AIFF’s national team director Subrata Paul told TOI after the technical committee meeting on Wednesday. “We believe in the potential of these three coaches.

Khalid has done extremely well in the I-League and Indian Super League (ISL).Constantine knows Indian football inside out and India played well at the Asian Cup in 2019. Tarkovic has a good national team experience, after stints with Slovakia and Kyrgyzstan,” said another official.The technical committee has backed Jamil for the top job, given his record in domestic football. Despite limited resources, the former India midfielder won the I-League with Aizawl FC, scripting one of Indian football’s most remarkable stories in 2017. He then caught everyone’s attention with semifinal spots in the ISL with NorthEast and Jamshedpur FC, a side he continues to coach.“The AIFF will now speak with the coaches and look at their (salary) demands.

India went from 173 to 97 in FIFA rankings between 2015 and 2018 when Constantine was at the helm of affairs.

Poll Will Marcus Rashford thrive at Barcelona? Yes, he will regain his form No, he will struggle

Marcus Rashford has been handed a fresh opportunity to revive his career, joining Barcelona on a season-long loan from Manchester United, the Spanish club confirmed on Wednesday.Once considered one of Europe’s most promising forwards, Rashford has seen his form dip in recent seasons. After falling out of favour at United, the 27-year-old spent the latter half of last season on loan at Aston Villa.At Barcelona, Rashford will be part of a forward line that already includes Lamine Yamal, Brazil’s Raphinha, and veteran striker Robert Lewandowski.Rashford arrived in Barcelona on Sunday to complete the deal. He met his new teammates and reportedly trained with the squad on Tuesday. Financial details of the agreement have not been disclosed, but Spanish media reports suggest the loan includes an option for Barcelona to buy the England international for around €30 million ($35 million).Barcelona had initially targeted Spain forward Nico Williams during the transfer window, but the Athletic Bilbao star signed a long-term extension, opening the door for Rashford’s move.Despite having the most prolific attack in Spain last season, Barcelona were keen to strengthen their frontline. The trio of Yamal, Raphinha, and Lewandowski combined to score 102 goals in the league — 24 more than Real Madrid's tally. They also led the Champions League scoring charts with 43 goals before being eliminated in the semifinals by Inter Milan.Rashford, a product of Manchester United’s academy, made 429 appearances and scored 138 goals, winning five major trophies with the club. However, he only reached the 20-goal mark in three seasons and scored a combined 15 goals in his last two at United. While at Villa, he added another four in 17 games.Despite his recent struggles, Rashford’s talent has rarely been doubted. He recently returned to the England squad under new coach Thomas Tuchel, keeping his hopes alive for a place at next year’s World Cup.","Marcus Rashford has joined Barcelona on a season-long loan from Manchester United.

Hits and Misses at the London E-Prix

It was Jaguar TCS Racing’s day at the London E-Prix on Saturday. Fresh off his Berlin win, Mitch Evans started from pole but spun during the race and lost his lead. It was eventually his teammate Nick Cassidy who went on to win Round 15. The victory was even more special for Cassidy, who had announced that he would be leaving the team after the season wraps up on Sunday. He also pushed Taylor Barnard to fourth by taking the third place in the Formula E Driver Standings.In a message to Jaguar TCS Racing after clinching his third win of the season, Nick Cassidy said, “I take back every single little thing I said about strategy today because I got it completely wrong, and you guys got it completely right. It’s an honour to drive for you. Thank you so much. That one was for you guys.”Cassidy was followed by Mahindra Racing’s Nyck de Vries, who secured second place on the podium — his second of the season. He had started from the front row and managed to hold his ground. TAG Heuer Porsche’s Pascal Wehrlein finished third, adding another podium to his season. He currently sits second in the Formula E Drivers’ Standings behind championship leader Oliver Rowland.Maserati MSG Racing’s Stoffel Vandoorne finished fourth, followed by Andretti’s Jake Dennis in fifth. DS Penske’s Jean-Eric Vergne came in sixth, while Mahindra Racing’s Edoardo Mortara secured seventh. Envision Racing’s Robin Frijns was eighth, Nissan’s Norman Nato ninth, and Mitch Evans — despite starting on pole — ended in 10th after his spin. Championship leader Rowland finished 11th.The race saw early drama when DS Penske’s Maximilian Günther hit the wall right after the start, triggering a pile-up that also involved McLaren’s Taylor Barnard and Sam Bird, as well as Lola Yamaha ABT’s Zane Maloney.Near the finish line, Cupra Kiro’s Dan Ticktum also crashed into the wall and retired from the race. Earlier, Ticktum had made contact with Mitch Evans’ Jaguar, causing Evans to spin and lose his lead — ultimately finishing 10th.Also Read: Nick Cassidy to bid farewell to Jaguar TCS Racing after London E-Prix: “It’s been an incredible two years together” The London E-Prix Round 16 race will take place on Sunday at the same time.

Kush Maini is a pro when it comes to cricket knowledge

Who is Kush Maini?

Mahindra Racing’s Indian Formula 2 champion Kush Maini is not just an impressive presence on the track but also well-versed in his country’s favourite sport — cricket. The racer from Bengaluru recently took a cricket quiz and nearly scored a perfect 10/10, answering almost every question with precision. He is the only Indian to have won a Formula 2 race in Monaco and recently delivered an impressive performance at the Berlin Rookie Test, finishing among the top three in both sessions.A video of Kush Maini’s cricket quiz shows him getting momentarily confused with the first question, though he gave the correct answer initially. When asked about the number of players in a cricket team, he initially said “eleven” but changed it to “twelve” after counting the number of openers and following players.After that brief hiccup, Maini breezed through the quiz like a pro. He correctly answered questions about the criteria for a four and a six, and explained terms like LBW, duck, and clean bowled. He also knew the number of overs bowled in T20, One-Day, and Test matches.When asked which team Virat Kohli represents in the IPL, Maini confidently replied, “RCB… that’s me, can’t get that wrong.” He also tackled a question about the British singer who joked about not understanding cricket despite coming from the country that invented it.Maini answered “Ed Sheeran” — and was pleasantly surprised to learn he was right. He also knew that David Beckham was the English footballer who once played a friendly match with Sachin Tendulkar.Watch Kush Maini’s candid video here Kush Maini moved to England at the age of 13–14 to pursue racing. Originally from Bengaluru, he now spends more time abroad than in India. He became the first Indian to win the prestigious Monaco Grand Prix in Formula 2 earlier this year.He recently showcased his racing talent during the Berlin Rookie Test, representing Mahindra Racing. He finished second in the morning session and third in the afternoon. Speaking after the test, he said, “In the morning, we focused on 350kW runs, and in the afternoon, more on race runs. Whatever the run, we were always in the top three and really fast, so a good step was made. Whenever I get into this car, I leave with a smile on my face. ”Also Read: Berlin Rookie Test standouts Gabriele Minì and Kush Maini share insights after impressive runs Maini continues to shine on the track and, following his impressive performance in Berlin, may even join Formula E one day.","Kush Maini is the only Indian to have won a Formula 2 race in Monaco.

FIA and Formula E comment on agreement extension



In good news for Formula E, a multi-year agreement extension has secured the rights to the FIA Formula E World Championship for an additional 10 years from 2038, when the current agreement ends. This ensures a long and thrilling future for the FIA Formula E World Championship. The long-term extension will enable Formula E to grow further, build strategic long-range partnerships, and drive greater fan engagement.At present, Formula E continues to focus on its phased development strategy for its racing cars — delivering faster top speeds, greater acceleration, enhanced aerodynamics, and improved tyre performance. These developments highlight the series' increased relevance to consumers and the wider EV market, with greater “race to road” technology transfer.With electric vehicle sales projected to rise to over 40% of global vehicle sales by 2030, and global lithium-ion battery production expected to triple by 2030, the relevance of Formula E and its technological advancements is more critical than ever. The Formula E GEN3 Evo already represents a step-change in performance: 0–60 mph in just 1.82 seconds (30% faster than a current Formula 1 car), a 200 mph top speed, and nearly 50% of the energy needed to complete a race regenerated during the event.It is designed with sustainability at its core and includes tyres made with 35% recycled materials and bodywork incorporating recycled carbon fibre and natural fibres.Formula E sees the participation of major automotive manufacturers including Porsche, Jaguar, Nissan, Maserati, Stellantis, Mahindra, and Lola-Yamaha. Since its first race in Beijing in 2014, Formula E has grown by 20% year-on-year, reaching around 400 million fans globally and attracting a television audience of approximately half a billion.The Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA), the global governing body for motorsport and mobility organisations, has announced a multi-year extension to its agreement with Formula E Holdings Limited (majority-owned by Liberty Global).Mohammed Ben Sulayem, President at the FIA, said, “The extension of the agreement governing the FIA Formula E World Championship is a fantastic outcome for the sport and a clear reflection of our ongoing strategy at the FIA to foster long-term stability, innovation, and growth across all areas of motorsport.”He further said, “This milestone reaffirms our commitment to innovation, sustainability, and technological progress, which are all central to the Championship’s unique identity and purpose. It also aligns with our broader goal of increasing global participation and driving more accessible motorsport for all. We are delighted to be continuing this journey with Formula E, and I look forward to seeing it grow even further, both on and off the track, in the years to come. ”FIA Chief Commercial Officer Craig Edmondson, said, “Formula E has not only demonstrated impressive growth since its inception, but has also led the way on sustainable innovation in our industry. This is a landmark agreement for the FIA and Formula E, and we are excited to be working with the Championship in the years to come.”Liberty Global CEO Mike Fries said, “We’ve believed in Formula E since day one, and this extension reaffirms our confidence in where it’s headed. This is the motorsport of the future - a championship that combines the very latest technology, close-combat racing, and a mission that really matters.“With the FIA’s continued backing, we can now take the next big steps - scaling the sport, growing its global fanbase, and continuing to push the boundaries of what electric racing can achieve. With this new agreement in place, Formula E is now positioned better than ever to define the future of motorsport - more innovative, more inclusive, more sustainable - and to inspire the next generation of fans, drivers, and partners around the world. ""Also Read: Formula E London E-Prix 2025: Pascal Wehrlein tops FP1, Jake Dennis finishes second Formula E CEO Jeff Dodds also added, “Formula E’s growth since its inception has been nothing short of extraordinary, with hundreds of millions of fans and world-class teams and drivers deciding to choose highly competitive electric racing. This long-term extension of the partnership enables us to continue building the brand, investing in the product and delivering some of the most captivating racing that has made us famous.

From a mental health perspective, I feel a lot lighter, like a weight has come off my shoulders.

Other Formula E initiatives

Formula E has several initiatives running under its sustainability campaign. Among them is a youth education program called Driving Force, supported by PIF E360. It aims to teach children between the ages of 8 and 18 about science, technology, and sustainability. The goal is to reach over 50,000 students worldwide by the end of 2025.The Driving Force initiative comes at a time when there is expected to be a massive demand for 200,000 skilled workers in the UK for green jobs by 2030, according to PwC.Driving Force helps students learn about clean energy and the environment. It also introduces them to role models from the fields of science and technology, helping them gain the knowledge and confidence needed to consider careers in these areas. These workshops use fun and practical activities to show how what students learn in school can lead to exciting real-world careers in racing, clean energy, engineering, and more.On July 16, over 90 students participated in Formula E’s Driving Force workshop at Hammersmith Academy in London. The session was one of five workshops held at schools across London in July, near the London E-Prix race site in East London and Formula E’s headquarters in Hammersmith.Earlier this year, similar workshops were also held in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, and Miami, USA, during Formula E race weeks.Julia Pallé, VP of Sustainability at Formula E, said, ""A survey in 2024 of more than 7,000 UK secondary school students reveals a worrying downward trend in both their involvement in and their ambition to pursue STEM subjects — a stark wake-up call for educators and policymakers alike.""""Teachers are being asked to make stronger connections between subjects and careers, but they need support from employers to do that effectively. Driving Force, presented by PIF E360, is part of the solution to help the education system deliver what our students and our green economy both desperately need to succeed,” she added.Also Read: Taylor Barnard overtakes Antonio Felix Da Costa in Berlin to claim 3rd in Formula E Driver Standings Formula E’s broader social impact strategy includes several other initiatives such as FIA Girls on Track, the Better Futures Fund, and Inspiration Hour.

Poll Do you believe that relationships built on false promises should be legally penalized? Yes No

Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) and Uttar Pradesh fast bowler Yash Dayal has been booked under Section 69 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) on charges of sexual exploitation, physical violence, mental harassment, and cheating by making false promises of marriage.Section 69 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita addresses sexual acts carried out under false pretenses, such as misleading promises of marriage or job offers. These acts are considered fraudulent and exploitative, and can lead to a prison sentence of up to ten years.As per the complaint, the Ghaziabad woman mentioned that she was in a five-year relationship with Dayal. She also claimed that Dayal introduced her to his family, who welcomed her as a “daughter-in-law,” thereby deepening her trust.""For the past 5 years, the complainant had been in a relationship with a cricketer,"" read the FIR statement.""The man emotionally, mentally, and physically exploited her by misleading her with the promise of marriage. He introduced the complainant to his family and behaved like a husband, which made her trust him completely.""When the complainant realized the deception and protested, she was subjected to physical violence and mental harassment.During the relationship, the complainant was also exploited financially and emotionally.""Later, it was found that the man was involved in similar false relationships with other girls too. On June 14, 2025, the complainant called the women's helpline 181, but the process did not move forward at the police station. The complainant is mentally and socially distressed and is seeking justice through the Chief Minister’s office. She has chat records, screenshots, video calls, and photos as evidence.""""It has been requested that a swift investigation be conducted into the matter and that legal action be taken against the concerned individual.

Australia women's team captain Alyssa Healy has taken a sly dig at Shubman Gill 's dream run in the ongoing Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy, where he has amassed 585 runs in two Tests.Healy praised the Indian captain for what he has done so far in the series, but at the same time, she mentioned that the Duke ball is not doing much.""I watched a little clip on his dismissals early in his career, and the ball was moving a lot. He got bowled, LBW a lot, like coming back through the gate,"" Healy said on the Willow Talk podcast.""That was his technical flaw, and all of a sudden, that's not happening now. So he's gone and worked on that. He's fixed that.""But also the ball, like, not really doing a whole heap, has probably helped him in that regard too. I am not downplaying this at all because it's been remarkable.""But yeah, like, kudos to him for making some technical changes knowing that hopefully they'd work in England.""However, former Australia wicketkeeper Brad Haddin showered praise on the new Indian captain.""It's what the best players in the world do. You all come in to start the Test career,"" said Haddin.""Everyone's got footage of everyone, and sometimes you can get exposed in a certain way, and it's not about getting exposed. It's about how you react to that and come back.And he's come back world-class. We've seen this for some time coming in the IPL.""He's been great taking over the captaincy there. He doesn't get flustered. He seems like one of those guys who's got an even tempo through the whole time.""And that's good for an Indian captain because a lot of the time, you can get caught up in the emotion of what's happening in the game. But what he's done with his team, the big thing as well — no Bumrah.""","Australia women's team captain Alyssa Healy has taken a sly dig at Shubman Gill's dream run in the ongoing Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy.

Jannik Sinner progressed to the Wimbledon quarter-finals on Monday after a tearful Grigor Dimitrov pulled out injured while in total control of the match while Novak Djokovic survived a scare.World number one Sinner and seven-time champion Djokovic remain on course for a mouthwatering semi-final clash but the top seed's match on Centre Court was overshadowed by Dimitrov's heartbreak.The Italian was staring at the exit door trailing 3-6, 5-7, 2-2 before the Bulgarian 19th seed pulled up holding his right pectoral muscle and was unable to continue.Sinner rushed to his aid but his 34-year-old opponent was barely able to wave to acknowledge the crowd's warm ovation.""Honestly I don't know what to say,"" said Sinner. ""He is an incredible player, I think we all saw this today.""He's been so unlucky in the past couple of years. An incredible player, a good friend of mine also. We understand each other very well off the court too.""Seeing him in this position, honestly, if there would be a chance that he could play the next round, he would deserve it.""The injury-prone Dimitrov has now been forced to retire in each of his past five Grand Slam appearances.Sinner himself suffered a nasty fall in the opening game of the fourth-round clash and appeared to be suffering discomfort in his right elbow.The three-time Grand Slam champion had been in regal form in the first three rounds at the All England Club, dropping just 17 games.Sinner, who is due to face American 10th seed Ben Shelton in the quarter-finals, said he would be having an MRI scan on Tuesday to assess the extent of the damage to his elbow.Shelton beat Italy's Lorenzo Sonego in four sets.Earlier, sixth seed Djokovic endured a nightmare start to his match against Australian 11th seed Alex de Minaur but battled back to win 1-6, 6-4, 6-4, 6-4.Fresh from his 100th win at Wimbledon on Saturday, making him the third player to achieve that feat after Martina Navratilova and Roger Federer , Djokovic reached his 16th quarter-final at the tournament.Aged 38, the Serb is aiming to win a record 25th major title, breaking a tie with the long-retired Margaret Court, and to equal Federer's record of eight men's crowns at the All England Club.That would make him the oldest Grand Slam singles champion in the Open era.Djokovic's 101st victory at Wimbledon came under the gaze of the Swiss great, who was sitting in the front row of the royal box alongside his wife Mirka.""It's probably the first time he's watching me and I've won the match,"" he said. ""The last couple I lost, so good to break the curse.""No, it's great, obviously, great to have Roger, a huge champion and someone that I admired and respected a lot.""We shared the stage for so many years, and it's great to have him back.""In the last eight, Djokovic faces Italian 22nd seed Flavio Cobolli, who beat former Wimbledon runner-up Marin Cilic 6-4, 6-4, 6-7 (4/7), 7-6 (7/3).In the women's draw, Iga Swiatek continued her serene progress with a 6-4, 6-1 rout of Danish 23rd seed Clara Tauson.Swiatek, fourth in the rankings, is a five-time Grand Slam winner but has never made a Wimbledon semi-final.The 24-year-old is in a strong position in the second week of the tournament after the exit of so many of the top seeds.""Honestly it's pretty amazing. It's the first time I really enjoyed London, sorry guys,"" Swiatek said, referring to her previous Wimbledon woes.""We are tennis players, so we feel well off the court when we feel well on the court.""The Polish player next faces Russian 19th seed Liudmila Samsonova, who beat Spain's Jessica Bouzas Maneiro 7-5, 7-5.Russian seventh seed Mirra Andreeva, 18, reached the Wimbledon quarter-finals for the first time with a 6-2, 6-3 win against American 10th seed Emma Navarro, who ended Barbora Krejcikova's reign as champion on Saturday.Andreeva next plays Swiss former Olympic champion Belinda Bencic, who beat Russian world number 17 Ekaterina Alexandrova 7-6 (7/4), 6-4.","World number one Jannik Sinner progresses to the Wimbledon quarter-finals after Grigor Dimitrov pulls out injured.

Poll Should aspiring athletes consider a 'Plan B' alongside their sports career? Yes, it's essential No, focus solely on sports

NEW DELHI: Akash Deep loves singing old songs. His favourite is Mohammed Rafi’s “Main Zindagi Ka Saath Nibhata Chala Gaya,” a song he would listen to on loop during his struggling days in Sasaram, Jamshedpur, New Delhi, Durgapur and Kolkata - all places he went in chase of his cricketing dream.“Kabhi kuch dhuen mein nahi udaya (He never lit a cigarette),” says Vaibhav Kumar, Akash Deep’s childhood friend.“He found solace in this song. There is a line ‘jo mil gaya usi ko muqaddar samajh liya’ (Whatever I got, I considered that as my fate), it was his favourite. He has gone through a lot since a very early age. I don’t know exactly when he found Mohammed Rafi or the great Rafi Saab found him, but the songs helped him,” Kumar tells TimesofIndia.com from Sasaram, where he heads Akash Deep’s academy.On Monday morning, Vaibhav forwarded a reel to Akash Deep, where a Brummie outside the Edgbaston stadium was singing a song in his name. Akash gently replied, “Ab humare naam pe gaana likha ja raha guru” (Now a song is being written in my name), disclosed Vaibhav with a laugh.If Rafi’s song helped Akash Deep fight the obstacles in his life, the random song from an Englishman at Edgbaston is a testament that the street will never forget what the 28-year-old did in the second Test of the ongoing Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy.Akash’s 10-wicket haul breached England's fortress and gave India a new hero.Before going to England, Akash Deep had told TimesofIndia.com how playing for India still feels like a dream and why he once in a while asks his mother to pinch him. “I never dreamt of playing cricket with a leather ball, forget playing Test cricket. Ye registaan mein paani dhoondne waali baat thi (It was like looking for water in a desert). Every match I play, I take it as an opportunity. I am living a dream and I want to stay there for a while,” he had said.But before even chasing this dream, he had almost quit. In 2016, he moved to Delhi, where his elder sister, who is now recuperating from liver cancer in Lucknow, used to live. He got himself enrolled in Madan Lal’s cricket academy. A week later, he called Vaibhav and said: “Yaar cricket ameeron ka khel hai, kahaan se humare jaison ka kuch hoga” (Cricket is a rich man's game, I don’t think I will be able to do anything).Before that, Akash Deep had tasted the brutal nature of the game in his village in Sasaram, Kolkata’s maidan in 2012, and in Jamshedpur, where he saw former India pacer Varun Aaron bowling rockets and thought he could bowl as quick as him.“My father was posted in Durgapur and I used to play cricket there. I asked him if you are planning to quit cricket, what would you do? What is your Plan B?” shared Vaibhav.Vaibhav knew his friend had no Plan B, but was left surprised when Akash Deep said: 'I will learn truck driving.'“When I coaxed him that to buy a truck you need money as well, he angrily said: ‘Sone nadi mein ret bahut hai, bhookhe nahi marenge’ (There is so much sand in River Sone, I will not die hungry).”This was Akash Deep’s frustration talking. His mother’s pension was not enough to keep the family afloat.Upon Vaibhav’s insistence, Akash Deep came to Durgapur, stayed there for a month and then the two friends took a train to Kolkata to give one more shot at cricket.“He had played in Kolkata before, when he used to go there for his father’s regular check-up. Even then, he had played cricket in the maidans of Kolkata for Rs 200 to 300. But this time we had a plan. I got enrolled in Videocon Cricket Academy, where United Club used to train. I told the coach that there is a fast bowler I know, who will win you matches. After a lot of to-and-fro and several trials, they gave Akash a chance,” recollected Vaibhav.“The deal was he would play as a professional and would not get any money. Back then in Kolkata, every team used to field three professional cricketers from outside of Kolkata and they had to pay money to play. In that season, Akash bagged 45 wickets and then he never looked back,” said Vaibhav.In Kolkata, former India cricketer and then Bengal coach Arun Lal saw him bowling in one of the league matches. His nip-pacer impressed Lal and within weeks, Akash was playing for Bengal U-23 and soon, entered the dressing room of the senior team.“I was desperate to get him in the team. I picked him ahead of Ashok Dinda, a first-class legend. I received so much scrutiny for it. But the boy had so much hunar (talent). He was vibrant, the in-swingers were so lethal - you can ask Harry Brook, the way he got him out,” reminisced Lal.Akash Deep, who had a breakthrough 2019-20 Ranji Trophy season, claiming 35 wickets in nine games, did so under Arun Lal.“The boy had gone through so much that self-belief was lacking in him. He was in a battle with himself. He is someone who needs an arm around his shoulder. I told him in jest one day that 'do you even know how good you are?' He laughed and said: ‘Sir Ranji khel liye bahut hai’ (I have played Ranji and that is enough). I blasted him for 45 minutes, and he was in tears, until Manoj (Tiwari) pulled me aside,” said Lal.The reality check by Arun Lal gave Akash Deep a goal.“I had told him that you are so good that you will be sold to any IPL team for Rs 10 crores and if you keep working hard, you will win Test matches for India,” said the 69-year-old.On Sunday, both his prophecies came true. At the 2025 IPL auction, he was acquired by Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) for Rs 8 crore. And on Sunday, at Edgbaston, he played a key role in India levelling the five-match Test series vs England.But for Akash, he still has a lot to achieve both on and off the field.“First and foremost Jyoti Di’s recovery. Good education for his late brother’s daughter, the eldest one has cracked the medical exam and is pursuing an MBA. We run a cricket academy in Sasaram, and we had a dream that from our academy very soon a girl or a boy will represent India,” said Vaibhav.For now, Akash Deep has a Test series to win, many dreams to fulfill and Mohammed Rafi’s songs to guide him through all the topsy-turvy ride of zindagi (life).","Akash Deep took 10 wickets for India in the second Test against England.

Poll Do you think Gautam Gambhir deserves support after India's victory at Edgbaston? Yes, he has proven himself. No, he needs to prove himself more

Former India cricketer Yograj Singh has come out in support of national team head coach Gautam Gambhir , urging critics to back the 43-year-old following India’s historic win at Edgbaston. Under Gambhir's guidance, the Shubman Gill-led side secured their first-ever Test victory at the venue, defeating England by 336 runs to level the five-match series 1-1.Prior to the triumph in Birmingham, Gambhir faced scrutiny for India's form in the longest format, particularly after the team’s five-wicket loss to England in the series opener at Leeds. However, Yograj stressed that Gambhir should not be criticised, as he continues to contribute positively to Indian cricket “Indian players are consistently growing and improving their game. We will support them always. We should not speak about Gautam Gambhir because he is doing well. Gambhir, Yuvraj Singh, and Rahul Dravid are giving back to cricket because they have received so much,” Yograj told ANI.India’s recent Test form had been underwhelming, with losses piling up since the start of their home series against New Zealand last year. The side had suffered seven defeats in nine matches, including a whitewash by the Kiwis, a 3-1 loss in Australia, and the opening Test against England.Despite the inconsistent run, Yograj urged for continued support for the team. “Even if our team loses the series, we should not demoralise them. If you lose, you will not be there to explain; if you win, you don't have to explain. We hope that we win the series under the captaincy of Shubman Gill ,” he said.India now head to Lord’s for the third Test, looking to take the lead in the series.",Yograj Singh has come out in support of India head coach Gautam Gambhir.

EXCLUSIVE | David Gower on Shubman Gill, Jasprit Bumrah and India's England tour

England squad for the third Test vs India

Reeling from a crushing 336-run defeat at Edgbaston, England have moved swiftly to bolster their bowling attack ahead of the third Test against India at Lord’s, starting Thursday, July 10.The England Men's selection panel has added Gus Atkinson, a right-arm fast bowler from Surrey, to the squad. The 27-year-old returns to the Test set-up after recovering from a hamstring injury sustained during England’s victory over Zimbabwe at Trent Bridge in May.His inclusion is seen as a direct response to England’s struggles with the ball in Birmingham, where India amassed a massive 587 in the first innings, led by Shubman Gill’s commanding 269. The English bowlers toiled as the visitors posted over 1000 runs across two innings, leaving skipper Ben Stokes visibly frustrated.""At 200/5 we were happy,"" Stokes said after the game. ""But we just weren’t able to blast them open. They ended up getting a big first innings total after us having a good start.""The new addition brings pace and proven domestic pedigree - with 55 wickets in just 12 matches at an average of 22.30, including best figures of 7/45.His return could also pave the way for a potential partnership with Jofra Archer, who trained with the squad in Birmingham and is being closely monitored ahead of a possible Test comeback after a four-year injury layoff.With the series level at 1-1, England may also consider resting Brydon Carse or Josh Tongue, both of whom have endured heavy workloads in the first two Tests.The squad shake-up reflects England’s urgency to regain momentum and recalibrate their bowling firepower as the series shifts to the iconic Lord’s Cricket Ground.Ben Duckett, Zak Crawley, Ollie Pope, Joe Root, Harry Brook, Jamie Smith, Ben Stokes (c), Chris Woakes, Brydon Carse, Josh Tongue, Shoaib Bashir, Jofra Archer, Jamie Overton, Gus Atkinson, Jacob Bethell, Sam Cook.","England have added Surrey fast bowler Gus Atkinson to their squad.

Poll Do you think MS Dhoni should return for IPL 2026? Yes, definitely! No, it's time to retire.

As MS Dhoni turned 44 on Monday, wishes poured in from across the cricketing world — but one stood out. “Happy birthday, Mahi bhai. Keep playing,” wrote India pacer Deepak Chahar on Instagram, echoing the sentiment of millions of fans who still aren't ready to see the legendary captain hang up his IPL boots.Dhoni, who retired from international cricket in 2020, remains the beating heart of the Chennai Super Kings franchise.Despite battling a chronic knee issue and advancing age, Dhoni led CSK through a turbulent IPL 2025 season, stepping in as captain when Ruturaj Gaikwad was sidelined by injury. His leadership and presence helped the five-time champions stay competitive, even as he batted lower down the order and played more of a mentoring role.Though his once-explosive batting has lost its edge, the Dhoni phenomenon remains unmatched. Stadiums still sell out just to witness a glimpse of ""Thala"", whether he's behind the stumps, walking out at No. 8, or simply tossing the coin at the toss.In June, Dhoni added another feather to his glittering cap when he was inducted into the ICC Hall of Fame, Class of 2025, becoming one of the few players to be honoured for excelling across all formats and leading India to major ICC titles — the 2007 T20 World Cup, 2011 ODI World Cup, and 2013 Champions Trophy.But will he return for IPL 2026? Dhoni remains non-committal.""It depends. Again, I would say the same thing (that) I have four-five months to decide, there's no hurry to decide what needs to be done,” he said after IPL 2025 ended.For now, Dhoni is enjoying a quieter life in Ranchi, but as always, the spotlight follows him — and the hope remains that he'll walk out in yellow one more time.","Deepak Chahar wishes MS Dhoni a happy 44th birthday on Instagram.

Poll Should Wiaan Mulder have pursued Brian Lara's record instead of declaring the innings? Yes, he should have gone for the record. No, prioritizing the team's needs was right.

South Africa’s stand-in captain Wiaan Mulder has explained the reasoning behind his selfless decision to declare the innings at 626/5 during the second Test against Zimbabwe, despite being within touching distance of Brian Lara ’s iconic record for the highest individual score in an innings in Test cricket. Mulder remained unbeaten on 367 off 334 balls at the Queens Sports Club in Bulawayo on Monday.Lara’s unbeaten 400, scored against England in 2004, still stands as the highest individual Test score, and Mulder made it clear he had no regrets about putting his team’s needs ahead of personal milestones.“First things first, I thought we got enough and we need to bowl. And secondly, Brian Lara is a legend, let's be real. He got 401 or whatever it was against England. And for someone of that stature to keep that record is pretty special,” Mulder said after stumps on Day 2, as quoted by AFP.""I think if I get the chance again, I'd probably do the same thing. I know speaking to the head coach Shukri Conrad, he kind of said to me as well, like, listen, let the legends keep the really big scores,” he added.Mulder’s 367* is now the highest individual score by a South African in Test cricket, surpassing Hashim Amla’s 311, and also the highest in an away Test.He reached his triple century in just 297 balls, making it the second-fastest in Test history.Despite the historic feat, Mulder made it clear that personal records weren’t the priority. “You never know what's my fate or whatever you want to call it, what's destined for me. But I think Brian Lara keeping that record is exactly the way it should be,” he said.",Wiaan Mulder declared the innings at 626/5 during the second Test against Zimbabwe.

South African cricket legend AB de Villiers commemorated former India captain MS Dhoni 's 44th birthday by remembering him as an intimidating opponent with a remarkable career.MS Dhoni's international cricket journey was marked by his captaincy success in winning three major ICC tournaments - the 2007 T20 World Cup, 2011 ODI World Cup, and 2013 Champions Trophy, alongside various bilateral and continental achievements.""It was very difficult to plan for MS Dhoni. When he was on song, nothing worked. Later on, we discovered that sometimes you could get away with wide deliveries with the seam, especially in the back end of his innings. We tried it. Sometimes it worked, sometimes it didn't,"" De Villiers said on JioHotstar's ‘7 Shades of MS Dhoni’.""The guy's class - not many game plans worked against him. I have a lot of respect for him and his achievements throughout his career. He was definitely an intimidating player to play against. What a fantastic career he had.""Former India selector and cricketer Kiran More shared his initial impressions of Dhoni, noting the unique spark he saw in the wicketkeeper-batsman.""At that time, if you looked at our batting order, you had Sourav Ganguly, Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid, VVS Laxman - all these players.Yuvraj Singh was also there. But I felt we needed an aggressive player, who could come and hit fours and sixes, utilise the Powerplay, make runs in 15 overs, and also in the middle overs,"" he added.""We were looking for someone who could hit sixes and boundaries — that kind of aggressive player wasn't visible. See, the top players were all of one mold. But MS Dhoni's strength — that power-hitting — we were looking for a different kind of player like that, to balance the batting order.""If you want to make 100 in 10 overs, you can. We gave many wicketkeepers chances, but the spark we saw in Dhoni — I felt this boy is something special, something different. We were taking chances. He was raw. From there, we picked him and gave him a chance.""Dhoni was recently inducted into the ICC Hall of Fame alongside Hashim Amla, Matthew Hayden, Graeme Smith, Daniel Vettori, Sana Mir, and Sarah Taylor.His international career statistics show 17,266 runs across formats, 829 dismissals as wicketkeeper, and 538 international matches played.""It is an honour to be named in the ICC Hall of Fame, which recognises the contributions of cricketers across generations and from all over the world.

Ranade was also the Mumbai fielding coach in the 2022-23 season, when they clinched their maiden Syed Mushtaq Ali T20 Trophy.During their triumphant Ranji Trophy campaign last season, when they beat Kerala in the summit clash, Vidarbha won all their 10 matches in succession-a rare feat.In the semifinals at home at the Jamtha in Nagpur, they downed last season's Ranji champions Mumbai by 80 runs, thus avenging their 169-run defeat in the Ranji Trophy final in the previous season.“After two years with Vidarbha, I am super happy to be back with my ‘Janmabhoomi’ (birth land) -The Mumbai Ranji team. It’s always a matter of pride to be a part of the Mumbai dressing room,” Ranade told Mumbai Mirror.The MCA had on July 2 announced that it would retain Omkar Salvi as the Mumbai senior team's head coach, with Sanjay Patil too staying on as chief selector.The 52-year-old Ranade, who played six first-class matches for Mumbai and Goa, is extremely attached to Mumbai cricket.“Being a part of the Mumbai team as a player in the momentous year of 1996/97 when we bagged all the three BCCI championships,-the Wills, Ranji and Irani Cup and later, upon me being the fielding coach, we won the Syed Mushtaq Ali as well for the first time in 2022/23, which is why being associated with Mumbai has always been nostalgic for me as it brings back a lot of fond memories,"" he said.""I've spent three seasons with Mumbai as the fielding coach, and two with Vidarbha as the assistant coach.

England head coach Brendon McCullum has hinted that Jofra Archer could make a return to the Test side for the third match against India at Lord’s, set to commence on Thursday. Archer, who was part of the squad for the second Test at Edgbaston but did not feature, is being considered as England look to freshen up their pace attack following a heavy 336-run defeat that levelled the series at 1-1.“He’s ready to go,” McCullum said about the express pacer, who last played a Test in February 2021. “It’s hugely exciting, he’s buzzing as well. He’s obviously been through his injuries and his time out of Test cricket , but we all know what he’s capable of achieving and we hope that when the opportunity does arrive for him, he's able to recapture and improve on what he's been able to do already,” added the head coach as quoted by AFP.The 30-year-old Archer has played just one first-class match this season, bowling 18 overs for Sussex, but remains a key weapon England are seriously considering deploying at Lord’s.India, meanwhile, have already confirmed that pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah will return after being rested for the second Test.McCullum also addressed England’s spin options, backing Shoaib Bashir to continue despite an expensive outing in the first two Tests, where he has taken eight wickets at an average close to 60.“We know he’s not the finished article yet, but I feel like he’s getting better and better. As the series wears on, I think we’ll see him play quite a big hand,” McCullum said.The coach also clarified that Jacob Bethell, though a more capable batsman than Bashir, won’t be considered as a spin replacement. “He’s a batting option. He’s the next one in if something happens, but we don’t crowbar anything.”With three matches remaining, McCullum expressed hope for a better balance between bat and ball, after the first two Tests produced 11 centuries led by Indian captain Shubman Gill, who has already scored 585 runs in the series.",England head coach Brendon McCullum hints that Jofra Archer could make a return to the Test side for the third match against India at Lord’s.

WATCH:

Real Madrid held off a late Borussia Dortmund surge to clinch a 3-2 win and book their place in the semi-finals of the FIFA Club World Cup, where they will face European champions Paris Saint-Germain. The match, played under sweltering heat at the MetLife Stadium near New York City, saw Gonzalo Garcia and Kylian Mbappe steal the show for the Spanish giants.Gonzalo Garcia, 21, opened the scoring in the 10th minute, slotting home his fourth goal of the tournament after an inch-perfect cross from Arda Guler. Ten minutes later, full-back Fran Garcia doubled the lead, finishing off a flowing move that included a cutback from Trent Alexander-Arnold. Real Madrid dominated the opening stages, stifling Dortmund’s rhythm and forcing them to chase shadows.Coach Xabi Alonso praised his team’s display but acknowledged the chaotic finish: “Everything was going under control… but the last 10 minutes were kind of crazy. Overall, a good 80 minutes and the last 10 minutes to improve.”Indeed, Dortmund mounted a dramatic late comeback.Maximilian Beier fired in from a loose clearance in the 93rd minute to make it 2-1. But Real’s response was emphatic — Mbappe, who came off the bench in the second half, produced a sensational overhead kick to restore the two-goal cushion.Mbappe, still yet to start in the tournament due to recent illness, now has his first goal of the Club World Cup and 44th of the season. ""It will be a great challenge for us to face PSG, but let's take positives from today and move on for the next one,"" said Alonso ahead of the semi-final showdown.There was still more drama to come, as Dean Huijsen was sent off for bringing down Serhou Guirassy, who converted the resulting penalty to bring Dortmund back within a goal.Despite the scare, Real held on, much to the delight of the 76,611 fans in attendance — a repeat of the 2024 Champions League final, but with far more twists.Dortmund coach Niko Kovac reflected, “It is a deserved win for Real Madrid. We showed our qualities and it is not a failure if you go home after a defeat against them.”","Real Madrid beat Borussia Dortmund 3-2 to reach the FIFA Club World Cup semi- finals.

Work and commitment

A late own-goal by goalkeeper Weverton took Chelsea through to the Club World Cup semi-finals on Friday as the Premier League side edged Palmeiras of Brazil 2-1 in a last-eight tie that had been lit up by a moment of magic from young star Estevao Willian.The teenage Brazil forward, who will join Chelsea after the tournament, was eager to impress his future employers and his brilliant 53rd-minute finish cancelled out Cole Palmer's opener in Philadelphia.But a deflected Malo Gusto cross went in off Palmeiras 'keeper Weverton in the 83rd minute to take Chelsea through to a semi-final showdown with another Brazilian side in Fluminense.""In the first half we were in control of the game and could have scored more than one goal,"" said Chelsea coach Enzo Maresca, dismissing suggestions his team had been fortunate.""They started the second half better than us and the dynamic of the game changed, but then in the last 25 minutes we were in control again and I think we deserved to win without being lucky.""The scoreline was a repeat of Chelsea's victory when the teams met in the final of the Club World Cup under the tournament's old guise in 2022.""Overall Chelsea was better. They have better players and a better coach,"" admitted Palmeiras coach Abel Ferreira.""They were lucky with the way they scored the second goal but it can happen in football and we need to accept it and move on.""Chelsea will now be fancied to go on and reach the final, with Fluminense standing in their way in the last four at the MetLife Stadium in New Jersey on Tuesday.If not everyone has yet been won over by the tournament, the intensity levels on the pitch are rising as it reaches the business end and there was a big-game atmosphere in Philadelphia.Lincoln Financial Field was almost sold out, with 65,782 fans in attendance despite much of the city having emptied out for the July 4 holiday and long weekend.This game played out to a backdrop of Independence Day fireworks lighting up the sky over the nearby Delaware River, but there were fireworks on the pitch too.Chelsea lit the spark first, going ahead in the 16th minute thanks to a moment of class from England international Palmer.After drifting into a pocket of space just outside the Palmeiras box, Palmer controlled a Trevoh Chalobah pass on the half-turn, carried on into the area and dispatched a low shot past Weverton.It was the ideal start for Chelsea, who lost to Flamengo when they last faced Brazilian opposition in the same stadium during the group stage.Maresca added extra Brazilian flavour to the occasion by handing a first start to young midfielder Andrey Santos.With Moises Caicedo suspended, Santos occupied the holding midfield role for Chelsea while Pedro Neto lined up on the right wing, choosing to play despite having to come to terms with the tragic death of his Portugal teammate Diogo Jota on Thursday.Playing on the right wing for Palmeiras was Estevao, the 18-year-old Brazil prodigy set to join Chelsea in a big-money transfer agreed over a year ago.He knew this could be his last game for the Sao Paulo side, and Chelsea probably should have been two ahead before the interval only for Christopher Nkunku to blaze over after being teed up by Palmer.Instead Palmeiras equalised eight minutes into the second half, with Estevao the inevitable scorer.Positioned inside the Chelsea box to the right, Estevao controlled a pass by Richard Rios and took a touch to get in front of Levi Colwill, another to steady himself, and then surprised goalkeeper Robert Sanchez with an early shot that went in off the bar.Chelsea responded by sending on new signing Joao Pedro for his debut, the Brazilian becoming the 27th player used by Maresca during the tournament.The Blues pushed in search of a second goal but extra time was looking likely when the Premier League side grabbed a scrappy winner with seven minutes of the 90 to play.Following a corner played short, Enzo Fernandez found Malo Gusto and his attempted low centre from the left side of the box deflected off the toe of Agustin Giay to surprise Weverton, with the ball striking him on its way in.Substitute Hercules struck a 70th-minute winner as Brazil's Fluminense defeated Saudi Arabia's Al Hilal 2-1 on Friday to reach the semi-finals of the Club World Cup.A fine left-foot finish from Matheus Martinelli had put the Rio club ahead in the 40th minute but Al Hilal's Brazilian forward Marcos Leonardo levelled six minutes into the second half before Hercules stole the show to the delight of the vast majority of the 43,091 crowd.Al Hilal had pulled off the biggest upset of the tournament, beating Manchester City 4-3, to reach the last eight and Simone Inzaghi's side fought hard until the end to keep their adventure alive.They bow out of the tournament having been unbeaten through the group stage, including holding Real Madrid to a draw, and having truly made their mark on the world stage.There was a moment's silence before the kick-off in memory of Liverpool and Portugal forward Diogo Jota and his younger brother Andre Silva, who died in the early hours of Thursday after their car veered off a motorway in Spain and burst into flames.Al Hilal's line-up featured two of Jota's Portugal team-mates in Ruben Neves and Joao Cancelo.The first half was a tight and tactical affair with few chances until Martinelli opened the scoring when he picked the ball up from Gabriel Fuentes inside the box and span out to give himself space for a left-foot shot that rocketed past Yassine Bounou.Al Hilal went close to a quick response when Kalidou Koulibaly's header forced Fluminense's 44-year-old goalkeeper Fabio into a fine save.The Saudi side were awarded a penalty when Samuel Xavier was ruled to have brought down Marcos Leonardo in the box but Dutch referee Danny Makkelie was eventually sent to the monitor where he overturned his own decision after seeing there had been no contact between the two players.After going in at the break trailing by a goal, Al Hilal came out strongly for the second half and drew level when Koulibaly headed a Neves corner down to Marcos Leonardo who poked home.Al Hilal's Brazilian full back Renan Lodi had a let off when his poor backpass fell straight at the feet of German Cano but the Fluminense striker's attempt to round Bounou was denied by the smart work of the Moroccan keeper.But the outcome was settled with 20 minutes remaining when half-time sub Hercules saw a shot from distance blocked but from the loose ball Samuel headed the ball back to the forward who raced into the box and fired past Bounou to make it 2-1.Al Hilal produced a flurry of corners and some intense pressure in the final minutes as they desperately sought a way to keep their dream alive but the Brazilians were good value for their victory.""We didn’t have many chances but we made the most of them, the entire group worked and were committed,"" said Fluminense coach Renato Gaucho.""Our fans here in the USA and those in Brazil, they can be proud and I ask them to wear a jersey, in the mall, street, beach, wherever, wear that shirt – they should all be proud to wear that jersey,"" he said.The Fluminense coach was full of praise for the performance of his 40-year-old central defender Thiago Silva who ensured the Brazilians were able to withstand the second half pressure from Al Hilal.""Thiago Silva is huge for us, I worked with him 15 years ago, he is a coach on the pitch, very helpful and conveys calm and experience to the others. He is our captain and a leader and in hard matches like these against big clubs, its important to have people like him. He is key and fundamental,"" he said.Al Hilal coach Inzaghi said his side had been unfortunate to end on the losing side.""It has been a good World Cup for us but clearly we leave with a little bit of a bitter taste in our mouth because after what happened in that second half, we deserved much more,"" he said.""It was a tight match, decided by episodes, as happens in football. Fluminense are very well organised team that are having an excellent tournament,"" he added.",Chelsea beat Palmeiras 2-1 to reach the Club World Cup semi-finals in Philadelphia.

Neves and Jota also played together at Wolves in the Premier League before Jota's transfer to Liverpool in 2020.Al-Hilal's head coach Simone Inzaghi addressed the emotional impact of the situation on his players, stating: ""We all know it's a very sad day because of what happened to Diogo and André.These things should never happen. We're all aware of the tragedy. We have two Portugal players Rúben Neves and João Cancelo who were friends to them. Today has been a very difficult day for all of us. We tried to work in the same way but the atmosphere was different. It's a very, very sad tragedy.""Neves shared his feelings through an emotional Instagram post: ""Wherever you are, I know you'll read this. We've never been that stupid and maybe now I regret it a little, but you know what you mean to me as much as I know what I mean to you… Life brought us together and now it can't separate us.

Starting today, you'll enter the field with me, and we'll follow our path together, on the stage where we met.

BENGALURU: Former India coach Igor Stimac who was sacked by the All India Football Federation (AIFF) last year and replaced with Manolo Marquez, who stepped down on Wednesday, said he was not surprised to hear that the Spanish gaffer had to leave the job after being in charge of the national team for just eight games.“The AIFF is run badly, without any clear idea on what to and how to do it,” Stimac told TOI. Stimac, who lost his job after India crashed out of the World Cup qualifiers had won a compensation of $ four lakh as compensation as the AIFF sacked him with one year left on his contract.Presenting his arguments on India's downward spiral from a world rank of 102 in 2023 to 127 in 2025, the former Croatian international said Indian players are not improving their skills through tournaments like the Indian Super League “Players are not progressing their game in such leagues like ISL which is without enough game intensity and pressure of results. Also, there's no relega- tion and lack of quality games,” Stimac said.He also said the national team does not get enough time to prepare. “FIFA windows are not long enough for preparation time when facing strong opponents. So the AIFF needs to reschedule the ISL calendar in favour of the national team.”Stimac also said the Indian footballers should come out of their comfort zone. “Unrealistic players’ salaries in ISL are putting players in a comfort zone.

Sebastien Buemi wins third spot on the podium in Jakarta



Sebastien Buemi’s performance in 2025 Formula E season

Coming as major good news for Envision Racing driver Sebastien Buemi, the removal of a time penalty from the last Jakarta race has landed him on the podium. Buemi is now officially promoted to third place, while Nico Mueller, who had originally celebrated a podium alongside Dan Ticktum and Edoardo Mortara at the Jakarta E-Prix, has been moved to fourth.The five-second penalty initially handed to Sebastien Buemi at the Jakarta E-Prix for contact with Mahindra Racing’s Edoardo Mortara was recently overturned following a FIA hearing. Due to the penalty, Buemi had finished eighth in Round 12 of the Jakarta race in June. However, the reversal has now reshaped the podium — much to Mueller’s disappointment.According to FormulaE.com, additional footage from Envision Racing's roll hoop camera, which was not available at the time the penalty was applied, was reviewed in detail. Buemi had received the penalty for an on-track collision with Mortara.The FIA stated: “The driver of Car 16 (Buemi) argued that the new element shows his overtaking manoeuvre was legitimate, that he was always in control of his car, and that when the slight contact occurred, he was fully alongside Car 48 (Mortara).”They further added: “The driver of Car 48 agreed with the assessment and mentioned he barely felt the contact.Upon careful consideration of the circumstances, the Stewards find that no single party bears whole or predominant responsibility for the collision. Therefore, the Stewards decide to reverse Decision 12. As a result, the penalty (i.e., five-second time penalty and one penalty point) on Car 16 is removed, and no further action will be taken in relation to this collision. ”With this update, Buemi moved to 10th in the Formula E Driver Standings with 63 points. In addition to his newly awarded Jakarta podium, he also has one win this season, in the Monaco E-Prix during Round 7.Also Read: Nico Mueller happy with Jakarta podium but adds, “It could have been even better with Jake” Buemi will now head to Berlin for Rounds 13 and 14 of the Formula E season.

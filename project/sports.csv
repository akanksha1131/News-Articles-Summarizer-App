NEW DELHI: When former cricketer Atul Wassan announced that he wants Pakistan to defeat India in Sunday's Champions Trophy match in Dubai, it caught everyone off guard.Pakistan will take on fierce opponents India in the duel of the heavyweights in an attempt to maintain their championship defense. After losing to New Zealand by 60 runs in the opening match of the competition, Pakistan ended up in this situation.The Men in Green would require a lot of different combinations to work in their favor and sustain their campaign if they lose against India on Sunday. Wassan thinks that if Pakistan wins the crucial match, the competition will become much more thrilling.""I want Pakistan to win because it will be fun, tournament-wise. If you don't let Pakistan win, then what will you do? If Pakistan wins, then it becomes a contest. There should be an equal fight,"" Wassan told ANI.Wassan praised India's batting depth in the starting line-up while analyzing their team for the current Champions Trophy. He believed that India was the greatest squad and supported their plan to launch a spin-heavy attack in Dubai given the circumstances.""You have a lot of good batters: Shubman (Gill), Rohit (Sharma), Virat (Kohli). You are batting until number eight in Axar Patel. Rohit has picked five spinners, and this team is best for Dubai. Have faith in what you have and move ahead,"" he added.India glided to a facile six-wicket victory against Bangladesh to open their account, while Pakistan started the campaign on a losing note.However, Wassan voiced his displeasure at Rishabh Pant 's exclusion from India's starting XI in favor of KL Rahul . Wassan believes that Pant makes the opposition uneasy, something Rahul cannot do.Head coach Gautam Gambhir 's preference for Rahul over Pant did not impress Wassan. He claims that the ""mercurial"" player has been let down by the Indian management, which could have long-term consequences for him.""Gautam Gambhir is picking his own team. I am just very upset that Rishabh Pant is not playing. I don't know why. He's a mercurial player who makes the other team nervous. They feel that he will single-handedly win the match. KL Rahul is a very good player but does not attract such fear from the opposition. You let Rishabh Pant down. If you let a good player enter this situation that he won't play, the hero in him becomes zero,"" Wassan said.","Former cricketer Atul Wassan wants Pakistan to defeat India in Sunday's Champions Trophy match in Dubai.

NEW DELHI: India's newly crowned world No.1 ODI batter, Shubman Gill , lived up to his billing with a magnificent century, steering India to a six-wicket victory over Bangladesh in their ICC Champions Trophy 2025 opener. His composed knock, his second consecutive ODI ton, reinforced his dominance in white-ball cricket and drew high praise from former Australian captain Ricky Ponting Speaking on The ICC Review, Ponting hailed the 25-year-old's rise to the top of the rankings, calling it a reflection of his class and consistency.""He thoroughly deserves to be the number one ranked batter in the world at the moment,"" Ponting said. ""It's a great sign for India that he's got his account underway early in the first game of a Champions Trophy.""While Gill has yet to make a significant mark in Test cricket, Ponting stressed that ODIs and T20s are perfectly suited to his style.""He's been a very, very good international player for a number of years,"" Ponting noted. ""He hasn't sort of transferred that over into Test Match cricket yet, but his white-ball cricket over the last three or four years has been outstanding. Look, he's a big-game player as well. He's played really well in IPLs over the last couple of years, obviously being captain of his franchise there.""Ponting particularly praised Gill's ability to score freely in ODIs, especially against fast bowling.""He can come out and be nice and aggressive early in the power play with the field up, get some boundaries away early by playing good, naturally aggressive cricketing shots,"" Ponting explained. ""He's not a big hitter, he doesn't try to do anything outside of his natural game, but he scores boundaries almost at will against fast bowling.""Beyond his batting prowess, Ponting also sees leadership potential in Gill.""He just seems like a really nice character, very driven for what he wants to achieve in the game,"" Ponting said. ""We've had a chance to catch up over the last couple of years, particularly around the IPL season. I just like his demeanor. He seems like a very driven guy that wants to be the best he possibly can with batting and also in leadership.""Gill's eighth ODI century, helping India chase down 229 against Bangladesh on a tricky pitch in Dubai, further solidified his reputation as India's premier white-ball batter.","Ricky Ponting hails India's world No.1 ODI batter, Shubman Gill. Ponting says Gill's rise to the top of the rankings is a reflection of his class and consistency.

England XI:

NEW DELHI: An off-colour England and injury-hit Australia will be keen to get off to a strong start in the Champions Trophy campaign when the Ashes rivals face-off in Lahore on Saturday in what appears to be an evenly matched Group B match.In the last two rubbers, world champion Australia has lost to Pakistan (1-2) and Sri Lanka (0-2) as both sides have struggled in the ODI format.Since their catastrophic 2023 World Cup campaign, England, who are currently coached by Brendon McCullum in all forms, have failed to win an ODI series.Also See: India vs Pakistan Head to Head Records The Jos Buttler-led team just suffered a 0-3 loss against India, as they looked unprepared and were unable to compete with the home team.Both teams will be eager to make their mark in this ICC showpiece event.Australia won a five-match series 3-2 in September of last year, giving them the advantage over their Ashes opponents the previous time they played in England.But a lot has changed since then, as the world champions now without five important members of their original squad.Their renowned trio of Pat Cummins , Josh Hazlewood, and Mitchell Starc will not be playing in the event, which will have a significant impact on their pace assault.Additionally, they will be without all-rounders Marcus Stoinis, who made an unexpected retirement from the format after being included in the tournament's original lineup, Mitchell Marsh (back injury), and Cameron Green (injury).In this situation, it is unclear if Australia, led by interim captain Steve Smith , would be able to repeat their previous achievements in what is sometimes called a 'mini' World Cup.Also See: Champions Trophy 2025 Points table Smith will probably start at No. 3 in Marsh's absence and shoulder the batting load for a team that won this event back-to-back in 2006 and 2009.Travis Head, the aggressive white-ball opener, will be the center of attention. In their 2022 series, he scored 101 and 89 runs at this very venue.Head is a serious threat after smashing a career-best 154 not out against England at Trent Bridge during the previous year's series.England has suggested a three-pronged pace attack with Adil Rashid's spin to complement Jofra Archer , Mark Wood, and Brydon Carse as a potential counter-strategy.""They're pretty much all-out fast bowling with Adil (Rashid, the leg-spinner) being their banker - he's high quality, and doesn't go underrated in this room - but there's so much excitement around Wood, Jofra, Carse and (Gus) Atkinson,"" head told 'cricket.com.au'.""We're going to have to make sure we start well against them. As an opening batter, how I can counteract that and how I play against that is a great challenge.""Jamie Smith, a rising wicketkeeper-batter for England, is also included. He is probably going to bat at number three.Ben Duckett, who looked in explosive form against India, will try to provide a solid start, while Joe Root will be the batting backbone, as the wicket is predicted to favor batting.Root, who finished the India series as England's second-leading run scorer after Duckett, will try to have a big influence.England, who are vying for their first Champions Trophy, are avoiding thinking about their previous setbacks in India.""Regardless of what happened in India, we've got that belief that we've got the talent, we've got the world-class players, the match-winners in the squad to win the tournament,"" Rashid said.Steve Smith (Capt.), Sean Abbott, Alex Carey, Ben Dwarshuis, Nathan Ellis, Jake Fraser-McGurk, Aaron Hardie, Travis Head, Josh Inglis, Spencer Johnson, Marnus Labuschagne, Glenn Maxwell, Tanveer Sangha, Matthew Short, Adam Zampa.

DUBAI: Cricketing powerhouses India and Pakistan renew their storied if rare rivalry in the most hotly-anticipated match of the 2025 Champions Trophy in Dubai on Sunday.A look at six memorable ODI matches between the bitter rivals ahead of their latest clash:Javed Miandad's last-ball six at the desert venue arguably remains the most dramatic ODI outcome between the two sides as Pakistan clinched a one-wicket victory.Pakistan needed 246 to win in 50 overs and Miandad walked in at 61-3 to hit an unbeaten 116 off 114 balls.With four needed off the final delivery, Indian fast bowler Chetan Sharma bowled a full toss and Miandad blasted the ball into the crowd to trigger wild celebrations among the Pakistan team and fans.Miandad was later presented with a golden sword for his heroics.Imran Khan's best bowling figures of 6-14 were in a one-day international against India but for the flamboyant Pakistan fast bowler it was all in vain.Imran ripped through the Indian batting line-up at Sharjah to send the opposition packing for 125.But Pakistan's own batting imploded, skittled for just 87 with Ramiz Raja, top-scorer with 29, one of only four batsmen in double figures.India's Ajay Jadeja blasted a 25-ball 45 in a late blitz that helped India knock out holders Pakistan in a highly-charged World Cup quarter-final.Jadeja was severe on Pakistan's Waqar Younis as he hit the pace bowler for four fours and two sixes in the final few overs to propel the total to 287-8.In reply, Pakistan were sailing along when opener Aamir Sohail smashed India's Venkatesh Prasad for a boundary before sledging his opponent.But Venkatesh got the left-handed batsman bowled on the next ball to bring the house down and Pakistan lost their way to lose by 39 runs.Sourav Ganguly hit a match-winning century to trump Saeed Anwar's 140 in a deciding best-of-three final of Bangladesh's Silver Jubilee Independence Cup in Dhaka.Ganguly's knock of 124 was laced with 11 fours and one six as India chased down their victory target of 315 with one ball to spare.The left-handed Ganguly was named man of the match but lesser-known Hrishikesh Kanitkar stole the show in the end when India needed three on the final two balls and he hit a boundary on the penultimate delivery.The chase was a world record at the time. Sachin Tendulkar won many matches for India but his 98 against Pakistan at the 2003 World Cup remains special due his duel with fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar Tendulkar stood tall in his 75-ball knock that guided India in their chase of 274 against a Pakistan bowling line-up boasting Wasim Akram, Waqar and Akhtar.He uppercut one of Akhtar's express deliveries to a delightful six over third man - a shot that became iconic in Tendulkar's career.Akhtar later got Tendulkar's wicket but the damage had been done and India won by six wickets.Pakistan came in as underdogs in the Champions Trophy final, but stunned India by 180 runs, riding on a sparkling century by Fakhar Zaman.Zaman's 114 off 106 balls and a 128-run opening stand with Azhar Ali guided Pakistan to a mammoth 338 for four and deflated Virat Kohli 's India at The Oval.The left-hander clobbered the Indian attack, including fast bowlers Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Jasprit Bumrah , hitting 12 fours and three sixes.Pakistan's bowlers then came out firing and dismissed India for just 158 in 30.3 overs despite Hardik Pandya 's 76.

Mohammad Amir Exclusive: Champions Trophy hopes, India's absence & retirement talk

NEW DELHI: Axar Patel went from elation to disappointment in a matter of seconds after being denied a hat-trick during India’s opening match of the ICC Men’s Champions Trophy 2025 Group A at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium on Thursday.The left-arm spinner struck twice in two deliveries, rattling Bangladesh’s batting lineup, only to be denied the rare milestone due to a dropped catch by skipper Rohit Sharma Introduced into the attack in the ninth over with Bangladesh struggling at 35/3, Axar made an immediate impact.On just the second ball of his spell, he removed Tanzid Hasan (25 off 25) with a sharp delivery that found the outside edge, safely collected by wicketkeeper KL Rahul.Off the very next ball, Mushfiqur Rahim fell for a golden duck in identical fashion — another edge taken cleanly by Rahul behind the stumps. With two in two, Axar stood on the verge of a hat-trick, as the Indian team erupted in anticipation.The stadium fell silent as Axar ran in for his hat-trick delivery. Jaker Ali, the new batter, faced a packed slip cordon with two slips and a leg slip in place.Axar delivered a precise ball angling slightly outside off, drawing Jaker forward in defence. The ball took a thick outside edge and flew toward first slip, where Rohit Sharma was perfectly positioned to complete the historic moment.But in a moment of agony, the Indian skipper fumbled the regulation catch, letting the ball slip through his fingers. Frustrated, Rohit struck the ground repeatedly, fully aware of the missed opportunity.Axar, though visibly disappointed, maintained his composure and continued his spell with focus.""A lot happened. I didn't know if it (Tanzid Hasan wicket) was out, but KL appealed and it was out. Then I got the second wicket. The third one, when the edge was found, I thought I got my hat-trick. It was an eventful over. I started to celebrate and then I saw it (Rohit dropping the catch),"" Axar told broadcasters after Bangladesh innings.""I didn't react and just came back. It's part of the game. The wicket got easier to bat and I think it's an easy total to chase. It's a slow wicket and as the ball gets older, it gets easier to bat. In the second innings, it'll continue to remain slow. My role is to contribute whenever my team needs it. Happy that the team trusts me a lot,"" he said.","Left-arm spinner struck twice in two deliveries, rattling Bangladesh’s batting lineup, only to be denied the rare milestone due to a dropped catch by skipper Rohit Sharma.

What does Shubman Gill's horoscope say about his captaincy future

Moments before the helmet came off and he broke into the trademark Shubman Gill bow to celebrate the three-figure mark, the 25-year-old was smiling ear to ear. There was a punch on the bat and the beaming smile didn't leave his face when he acknowledged the applause from the dressing room and the stands.It wasn't the first time he was bowing down and soaking it all in but this, by his own admission, was accompanied by a feeling of immense satisfaction.The Indian vice-captain's ODI hundred No.8 was his slowest in the format but will rank right up there for the quality, control and application. It wasn't the typical flowy Gill hundred but the one which required him to change his game as per situation, make the little adjustments and then see the side home with a lot of maturity.Both Gill and Rohit Sharma were off the blocks in brisk fashion but just when the wickets started tumbling from the other end and Bangladesh applied pressure with spin, the right-hander was happy to play the rotating game.Also See: Champions Trophy Points Table 2025 Early on in the innings, both Gill and Rohit figured that ""cutting the ball wasn't easy"" so the youngster quickly changed his approach and didn't hesitate while using his feet against the quicks. Even after Rohit, who gave India a breezy start, was dismissed, Gill continued to control the innings in the middle overs where they faced a lot of spin.""When me and Rohit bhai went out there, we thought cutting the ball wasn't easy because the balls which were outside the off-stump weren't coming onto the bat that nicely. So I thought of using my feet to even the fast bowlers and tried to go over the circle. When the spinners came on, me and Virat bhai were talking in the middle that it's not easy to score singles off the front foot, so we'll try to score singles off the back foot. And it's not easy to hit down the ground, so we just keep rotating the strike,"" said Gill after receiving the Player of the Match award.He was batting on 26 off 23 balls at the end of the tenth over but it took him another 46 deliveries to score the 24 runs for the half-century - his slowest in the format. Even when he dropped anchor, not once did Gill look out of control. There was a lot of clarity in the way he operated and the fall of wickets didn't have any effect on that.Kohli and Shreyas Iyer got starts but couldn't convert and Axar Patel 's early adventure meant India were delicately placed at 144/4. They weren't left with a mountain to climb, and there was enough batting to follow, but the message from the dressing room was clear - one set batter had to bat deep and it was Gill. The vice-captain took that responsibility and ensured the team crossed the finishing line without any more casualties.When Gill was making his way back to the change room and hugging his teammates on the way, the smile never left his face which had satisfaction written all over it. The knock wasn't a typical Gill dominating hundred but there was no compromise on the authority and control he always enjoys while getting to the magical number.The jabs and cuts through the off-side could have been missing, there were no big hits down the ground but still there were plenty strokes of brilliance on both sides of the wicket That crunching drive over covers, the 98m pull and the effortless flick which sailed into the stands ensured the shutterbugs remained busy on a very pleasant evening.""Definitely one of my most satisfying innings that I have played... ""The firsts are special but Gill will remember this hundred for a very very long time. Not because it opened his account in ICC tournaments but for the sheer class which was on display under the ring of fire.",The Indian vice-captain's ODI hundred No.8 was his slowest in the format.

India began their quest for another International Cricket Council (ICC) title by dominating Bangladesh in Dubai on Thursday, which concluded the first two matches in Group A, and action shifts to Group B today (February 21).After veteran pacer Mohammed Shami once again showed his liking for ICC events with a five-wicket haul (5 for 53), India's vice-captain Shubman Gill (101 not out) took over to lead India's six-wicket win with a century while chasing Bangladesh's below-par 228 at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium.""Definitely one of my most satisfying innings that I have played and my first century in ICC events,"" said Man-of-the-Match Gill. ""Very satisfying and very happy with the way I performed.""India went in with three spinners and preferred Harshit Rana over Arshdeep Singh as the second pacer, and the right-arm fast bowler justified that with his spell of 3 for 31. Axar Patel led the spin trio of Kuldeep Yadav, Ravindra Jadeja and himself with his 2 for 43.Also See: India vs Pakistan Head to Head Records in CT Axar was unlucky to miss out on a hat-trick when skipper Rohit dropped an easy catch in the slips.""May take him (Axar) for dinner tomorrow (smiles),"" said Rohit after the match.

That's the main difficulty for players that are lower ranked,"" Andreeva said.""I tell myself to fight for every ball, doesn't matter what's happening on the court,"" she said. ""I knew if I don't play aggressive she's going to go and kill me. Everybody knows that she likes to take the ball early, she doesn't give time to her opponents. She always tries to be the first one to attack. My game plan was to play my game, sometimes I just forced myself to be more aggressive.""Martinez chalks the strategy Andreeva brings to the court. ""If she didn't give me great advice and tactics I don't think I would be playing at such a high level,"" Andreeva said of the 52-year-old Spaniard, who is a calming presence at courtside. ""We take about 15 to 20 minutes to talk about the match, set up the game plan. For example, today I played at 2 (pm), we spoke at 1. It's all still fresh in my head (when I go on court).""Swiatek, who usually has a strong couple of weeks in the WTA events in the Middle East, wasn't at her best this time, falling in the semifinals to Jelena Ostapenko in Doha, and in the last-eight here in Dubai, where she looked out of sorts. The world No.2 had 31 unforced errors in the match on Thursday.""I'm not happy with the results. I feel like I under-performed,"" she said of the two weeks in Doha and Dubai. ""I need to talk with my team and plan the next weeks a bit differently because I haven't had much time to practice before these tournaments. I felt that there were some things missing (with my tennis) that should have been there.""""I wasn't really sure where my ball is going to go,"" a visibly upset Swiatek said of the match. ""I wasn't as precise as I should be. Mirra is a good player. It's not like I can win against her when I play worse."" Andreeva, looking to r each her first WTA 1000 final, will go up against sixth seed Elena Rybakina in the semifinals on Friday. Andreeva trails the Kazakh 0-1 in head-to head clashes.",Mirra Andreeva beats world No. 2 Iga Swiatek in straight sets to reach semifinals. The 17-year-old Russian had 10 aces and saved seven of eight breakpoint chances. She will play sixth seed Elena Rybakina in the semifinals on Friday.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118437872,imgsize-38286,width-400,resizemode-4/118437872.jpg"

NEW DELHI: In-form Shubman Gill etched his name into the record books with a composed, unbeaten 101 as India began their ICC Champions Trophy campaign with a six-wicket victory over Bangladesh on Thursday. Gill’s knock anchored India’s chase of a tricky 229-run target on a challenging surface, with the team reaching the finish line with 21 balls to spare.The 25-year-old vice-captain continued his sublime form, securing his eighth ODI hundred in just 51 innings — making him the fastest Indian to reach the milestone. He surpassed the previous record held by Shikhar Dhawan , who took 57 innings, while Virat Kohli (68 innings), Gautam Gambhir (98 innings), and Sachin Tendulkar (111 innings) followed in the list.""Definitely one of my most satisfying innings that I have played and my first century in ICC events,"" Gill said after receiving the Man of the Match award.

""Gill, we know the class that he has, shouldn't surprise anyone.

In 51 matches, he has amassed 2,688 runs at an astounding average of 62.51, striking at 100.78. Alongside his eight centuries, he has registered 15 half-centuries, further cementing his reputation as one of India's most promising batters.Interestingly, Gill's century against Bangladesh was his slowest in ODIs, taking 125 balls to reach the three-figure mark.

For decades, the UAE has been the battleground of some of the most unforgettable India-Pakistan One-Day International clashes. From the legendary Sharjah thrillers of the 1980s and 1990s to modern-day encounters in Dubai and Abu Dhabi, this neutral turf has witnessed heartbreaks, last-ball finishes and heroic performances. Here are five of the most memorable…This low-scoring thriller in Sharjah was testament to India's bowling prowess and ability to defend small totals. On a difficult pitch where batting was challenging, India managed to scrape together 125 runs in their 50 overs, primarily through contributions from Mohammad Azharuddin and Kapil Dev. Imran Khan was the standout bowler for Pakistan with figures of 6/14. The Pakistani bowling attack maintained pressure throughout the Indian innings, making run-scoring extremely difficult.However, what seemed like a small target turned into a mountain for Pakistan as India's bowlers, led by Kapil Dev, Laxman Sivaramakrishnan and Ravi Shastri delivered one of their most memorable bowling performances. The Pakistani batting lineup struggled against the disciplined bowling, with only Ramiz Raja showing resistance with 29. Kapil Dev's spell of 3/17 was crucial. The victory was significant - it came a week after Pakistan dominated India in their previous match at the same venue.India 125/7 in 50 overs (Mohammad Azharuddin 47, Kapil Dev 30; Imran Khan 6/14, Tauseef Ahmed 2/27) vs Pakistan 87 all out in 32.5 overs (Ramiz Raja 29; Kapil Dev 3/17, Laxman Sivaramakrishnan 2/16, Ravi Shastri 2/17).This match epitomized everything that makes India-Pakistan cricket special. India batted first and posted 245/7, thanks largely to Sunil Gavaskar 's measured 92 and Kris Srikkanth's aggressive 75. Their partnership set up what seemed like a winning total on a challenging Sharjah pitch.Pakistan's chase was dramatic from the start. Javed Miandad came in with Pakistan at 61/3. After some rebuilding, they found themselves needing four runs off the last ball, with Miandad on strike facing Chetan Sharma. What happened next became cricketing folklore and caused deep trauma to a generation of Indian fans. Sharma attempted a yorker but delivered a full toss, which Miandad dispatched over the midwicket boundary for six. The shot sent the packed stadium into a frenzy.Miandad's unbeaten 116 was a masterclass in how to bat under pressure. The psychological impact on Indian cricket was immense. India wouldn't beat Pakistan in Sharjah for several years after this match. The last-ball six became a symbol of Pakistan's dominance over India in that era.India 245/7 in 50 overs (Sunil Gavaskar 92, Kris Srikkanth 75, Dilip Vengsarkar 50; Wasim Akram 3/45, Imran Khan 2/40) vs Pakistan 248/9 in 50 overs (Javed Miandad 116 not out, Mohsin Khan 36; Chetan Sharma 3/51, Madan Lal 2/53).Another thriller in which Pakistan clinched a narrow 4-run victory. Pakistan won the toss and elected to bat, scoring 257/7. Aamer Sohail spearheaded the batting effort with a well composed 91 off 133 balls. Zahid Fazal contributed 39 during a partnership with Sohail, while Saleem Malik added 42 to keep the momentum going. Skipper Imran Khan played a brisk innings of 43 off just 24 deliveries.India's bowling attack faced challenges in containing the Pakistani batsmen. Kapil Dev was the most economical, conceding 31 runs and taking one wicket off his 10 overs, while Javagal Srinath also picked up two wickets.Chasing 258, India began cautiously. Ravi Shastri anchored the innings with a solid 77 off 99 balls. Vinod Kambli contributed 40 in an opening-wicket partnership of 124 runs with Shastri. But wickets started to fall at regular intervals thereafter. Down the order, Sachin Tendulkar scored 49 off 38 deliveries to keep India in the hunt but a late-order collapse prevented India from reaching the target.Pakistan's bowling attack, led by Wasim Akram, kept the pressure on. Akram took two while Aaqib Javed picked up one wicket during India's chase.Pakistan 257/7 in 50 overs (Aamer Sohail 91, Imran Khan 43, Saleem Malik 42; Javagal Srinath 2/55) vs India 253/6 in 50 overs (Ravi Shastri 77, Sachin Tendulkar 49; Wasim Akram 2/44).A match that finally broke Pakistan's dominance in Sharjah, featuring one of the finest batting displays of batting by the Indian top-order. The highlight was the 231-run second-wicket partnership between Sachin Tendulkar and Navjot Singh Sidhu, who both scored brilliant centuries. Tendulkar was particularly aggressive, hitting 118 off 140 balls with 8 fours and 2 sixes, while Sidhu's 101 provided the perfect foil.The partnership was significant as it came against a strong Pakistani bowling attack featuring Waqar Younis , Saqlain Mushtaq and Aaqib Javed. The way both batsmen handled the Pakistani pacers in the scorching Sharjah heat was remarkable.Pakistan's chase was spirited, led by Aamer Sohail's aggressive 78 and Rashid Latif's solid 50. The duo maintained a good run-rate and kept Pakistan in the hunt. However, Anil Kumble's stingy spell proved to be the difference. His 2/38 included key wickets of Latif and Saleem Malik, breaking the backbone of Pakistan's chase.India 305/5 in 50 overs (Sachin Tendulkar 118, Navjot Sidhu 101; Waqar Younis 3/44) vs Pakistan 277 all out in 46.1 overs (Aamer Sohail 78, Rashid Latif 50; Javagal Srinath 3/65, Anil Kumble 2/38, Sachin Tendulkar 2/40).One part of a two-match series played for charity, the match is particularly remembered for Irfan Pathan 's brilliant opening spell, in which he got the wickets of Shahid Afridi and Imran Farhat with some quality swing bowling.India's innings was built around three key knocks. Rahul Dravid , captaining the side, played a characteristic anchor role with his 92. Virender Sehwag was the aggressor, scoring a quick 73. Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Yuvraj Singh provided the late flourish with scores of 59 and 24, helping India reach a competitive 269/5 in 50 overs.Naved-ul-Hasan was the pick of the Pakistani bowlers, taking 2/45 with his precise seam bowling. However, Pakistan's fielding let them down and there were several dropped catches.During the chase, Pakistan started steadily but kept losing wickets at regular intervals. Inzamam-ul-Haq played a lone hand with his 79 but received little support from the other end.India 269/5 in 50 overs (Rahul Dravid 92, Virender Sehwag 73, MS Dhoni 59; Naved-ul-Hasan 2/45) vs Pakistan 218 all out in 45.2 overs (Inzamam-ul-Haq 79, Shoaib Malik 45; Irfan Pathan 3/35, Romesh Powar 3/61).","The UAE has been the battleground of some of the most unforgettable India- Pakistan One-Day International clashes.

Once upon a time, cobbling up your own combined India-Pakistan XIs over long afternoons used to be standard practice for cricket fans. That was the era of fierce cross-border rivalries, when the two teams regularly played each other in bilateral contests in addition to the desert derbies in Sharjah.Things have changed now. India and Pakistan are not allowed to play against one another often enough, but memories of those great ODIs through the 1980s and 90s - and into the first decade of the 2000s - still linger.Here is TOI's take on a fantasy ODI XI, from four decades of ODIs, comprising players from both teams. This XI is not just about players with the best numbers, but those who had the maximum impact in India-Pak ODIs. Apologies are in order to some greats who missed out.The obvious selection. His average of 40.09 in 69 head-to-head games is lower than many, but some of Tendulkar's most unforgettable ODI innings came against Pakistan. Tendulkar can walk into this XI only on the basis of the 98 he struck against a top-class Pakistan attack in the 2003 World Cup game in Centurion.Our pick will raise eyebrows, because it comes at the expense of another classy Indian opener, Rohit Sharma . But Anwar's average of 43.52 over 50 matches shows the kind of impact he had in ODIs against India. Anwar's flair and ability to take apart attacks made him one of the best openers of his generation. The 194 in Chennai in the 1997 Independence Cup against India is still the highest individual score in this epic rivalry.The modern master has played only 16 games against Pakistan, but it is impossible not to make him the No. 3. Kohli is arguably the greatest ODI batter of his generation, with the highest number of centuries in the format. His 183 in Dhaka in the Asia Cup match against Pakistan, on March 18, 2012, was ironically the last time Tendulkar featured in an ODI against Pakistan.The big man dominated India-Pak contests for more than a decade. An average of 43.69 and four centuries over 67 games underlines the effect he had on this rivalry. Ask any Indian captain of that generation and they would say that 'Inzy' was the best finisher of the game, not Michael Bevan. And who can forget the burly Inzamam's iconic attack, with bat raised, on an Indian fan in Toronto in 1997 for being taunted with 'Aloo' chants? This gentle giant sure had entertainment value!The 'street fighter' changed the course of this rivalry with his last-ball six off Chetan Sharma in the Australasia Cup final in Sharjah in 1986. Before that, for a few years, India had dominated the rivalry, but that one innings led to a complete change of momentum for almost a decade and a half. An average of 51.08 in 35 head-to-heads speaks volumes about the kind of impact Miandad had. For a generation of Indian cricket fans, his presence at the crease induced fear and awe.The greatest leader that sub-continental cricket has seen in the last 50 years. His 6-14 in Sharjah is still remembered as one of the finest spells in ODI cricket. It was under Imran that Pakistan became an unbeatable force towards the end of the 1980s, culminating in Imran leading Pakistan to their only ODI World Cup win in 1992.There simply hasn't been a better wicketkeeper-batter in India-Pak ODIs. Dhoni first made his mark in ODIs with a blistering 148 off 123 balls against Pakistan in Vizag, a performance that kept his career alive after a string of failures. He followed that up with a superb away series in Pakistan in 2006, which made president Pervez Musharraf his fan.The star allrounder was the heart and soul of the Indian attack when India were dominating this contest in the 1980s. It is impossible to forget his superb spell in the Benson and Hedges Final at MCG in 1985 that set up one of India's greatest moments in ODI cricket. Also, when India started losing ground later in the decade, Kapil never lost his verve and kept taking the attack to Pakistan, both with bat and the ball.The finest white-ball pacer of all time. Akram is the highest wicket-taker in this contest. In 48 games, the left-arm artist took 60 wickets at average of 25.15. Add to that some late-order cameos with the bat that used to change the course of the desert derbies in the late 1980s and 1990s. Till Akram was in business, India were never the favourites going into this contest. Things changed in India's favour only when after Akram retired in 2003.This is a rivalry that hasn't exactly been dominated by spinners, primarily because batters from these two countries, till a few years ago, used to be magnificent players of spin. Still, against the best in the business, Kumble held his own with 54 wickets from 34 games, including a 4-12 in the Sahara Cup in Toronto in 1996. That the likes of Miandad, Mohammed Younus and Inzamam never really took Kumble apart shows his greatness.The king of the doosra. With 57 wickets from 37 games, Saqlain was an enigma that the great Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid and Sourav Ganguly all struggled against. The beauty of Saqlain was that he could be as effective in the death overs as well, bamboozling batters looking for the big shots with his beautifully disguised other one, or doosra, which became one of the most difficult balls to face in that eraA batsman that Indian bowlers feared like no other in the late 1980s. His unbeaten 72 off 36 balls in the first ODI ever played at Eden Gardens, in 1987, still gives Indian fans from the era nightmares.A pacer with an uncanny ability to make a mark in India-Pak matches. Took a hat-trick in the tri-series final in Sharjah in 1991, where he finished with 7-37 -still the best figures in India-Pak ODIs. He probably would have made it, just that Kapil, Imran and Akram cannot be dropped.Walks into any ODI team, just that Anwar had a bigger impact for a longer period of time in this rivalry.The best pace bowler of the current generation doesn't have a big enough sample size when it comes to performances in India-Pak games.Older Pakistan fans won't recall his name with a lot of fondness. His 45 off 25 balls in the 1996 ODI World Cup quarterfinal is one of the most iconic cameos ever played in the history of the tournament.","Sachin Tendulkar, Virat Kohli, Ajay Jadeja, Imran Khan and Saqlain Mushtaq make the XI. India-Pakistan ODI rivalry dates back to the 1980s and 90s. India and Pakistan are not allowed to play against one another often enough.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118466981,imgsize-135510,width-400,resizemode-4/118466981.jpg"

Mohammed Shami: 'I just go for wickets; don't care about the economy rate at all'

NEW DELHI: Ryan Rickelton achieved his first ODI century as South Africa defeated Afghanistan by 107 runs in the Champions Trophy at Karachi on Friday.Rickelton scored 103 from 106 balls, including seven fours and a six, leading South Africa to a substantial total of 315-6 in the Group B encounter at the National Stadium.The South African pace bowlers Kagiso Rabada (3-36), Wiaan Mulder (2-36) and Lungi Ngidi (2-56) restricted Afghanistan to 208 runs, bowling them out in 43.3 overs.Afghanistan's renowned spinners struggled, with Rashid Khan failing to take any wickets whilst conceding 59 runs in his allocated 10 overs.Rahmat Shah led Afghanistan's batting with a valiant 90 from 92 deliveries, including nine fours and a six, before being dismissed as the final wicket.Afghanistan's run chase faltered early as they lost openers Rahmanullah Gurbaz (10) and Ibrahim Zadran (17) within the first 10 overs.The situation worsened when Sediqullah Atal (16) and captain Hashmatullah Shahidi (0) departed, leaving Afghanistan struggling at 50-4.Shah and Azmatullah Omarzai (18) advanced the score to 89 before Rabada and Marco Jansen, who dismissed Mohammad Nabi, effectively ended Afghanistan's chances.Rashid Khan provided brief entertainment with 18 runs from 13 balls, including a six and three fours.Earlier, Rickelton received support from captain Temba Bavuma (58), Rassie van der Dussen (52) and Aiden Markram (52 not out) in building South Africa's impressive total after winning the toss.Nabi, who finished with 2-51, struck early by dismissing Tony de Zorzi for 11, caught at mid-on.A 129-run partnership between Rickelton and Bavuma followed as Afghanistan struggled in the field.Bavuma's 76-ball innings included five fours before he was caught off Nabi's bowling, providing some cheer to the Afghan supporters in the sparse crowd.Rickelton, with two Test centuries but a previous ODI best of 91, reached his maiden white-ball hundred with a single. He was subsequently run out in unfortunate circumstances.Advancing to drive Rashid, Rickelton had to quickly return when the bowler collected and threw to wicketkeeper Gurbaz. Despite appearing to make his ground, replays showed his bat was slightly raised when Gurbaz removed the bails.Van der Dussen scored 52 from 46 balls with two sixes and three fours before falling to Noor Ahmad in the 43rd over.Markram ensured South Africa exceeded 300, scoring an unbeaten 52 from 36 balls with six fours and a six, helping add 50 runs in the final five overs.Australia face England in another Group B match in Lahore on Saturday.Pakistan, India, New Zealand and Bangladesh comprise Group A, with the top two teams from each group advancing to the semi-finals.","South Africa defeated Afghanistan by 107 runs in Champions Trophy.

BENGALURU: Steve Waugh represented a generation of cricketers who were dour, confident and supremely talented. Hence, it is hardly surprising that he backs Virat Kohli , a modern-day great, to overcome his form slump. “Great players tend to find a way and rectify things pretty quickly,” said Waugh, a Laureus Academy member, during a select virtual media interaction from Hong Kong on Friday. Excerpts...It’s more than a cricket match, a worldwide event and very unpredictable. Both sides have lots of talent. You never really know what the outcome is going to be. One-Day cricket is a lot more unpredictable than Tests. One person can have a great game and influence the match. India are favorites. Shubman Gill , a very good player, just got a century. Obviously, there's Kohli and the other big names. Pakistan have been hot and cold over the last 12 months. They're capable of doing good things. So, you're not sure what Pakistan side is going to turn up. But it wouldn't surprise me if Pakistan won that game.We set such high standards, everyone is expecting him to come out and get a hundred every game, which is not possible. He’s an amazing player. He was disappointed with his returns, and he kept getting out the same way (in Australia), which was a little bit surprising for such a great player.Great players tend to find a way and rectify things quickly. But I guess it just proved he’s human like the rest of us. Things in life change too. He's got children. Obviously other things are very important in his life, besides cricket. He just needs that little bit of spark to get him back. I never write off great players.The tendency to sort of just hang the bat outside off-stump, that’s something he could rectify quickly. I think that comes down to concentration and focus. Maybe that’s the area that is down now. Maybe he thinks too far ahead or is thinking about the consequences rather than playing it one ball at a time.Everyone’s different. Sometimes you have to get away from the game or have a hobby or another interest and not be totally obsessed with cricket. It’s unhealthy to think about cricket 24/7. I was successful on away tours because I got out and took photographs. I wrote books. I got out of the hotel. I always tell players, have a hobby or have an interest away from cricket because sometimes the best way to overcome adversity or lack of form is to just focus on something else and recharge your batteries. My advice to players who are struggling is to go to someone you trust, like your coach or one of your teammates and say, have you seen anything in my technique that might be not going quite right? You’ve got to go to the people you trust.Everyone doubts One-Day cricket until you have a major tournament, and then you realize you really like ODIs and they’re exciting. It looks like a long form again when you stack it up against T20. Now it’s almost seen as a boring format, but every time we have a World Cup, people fall in love with ODIs again. I think the (big ODI) tournaments are going to be important and mean something. So, the Champions Trophy, while it’s not as high profile as the World Cup, is important for players. It’s going to be increasingly hard in the future to fit all formats into the game. With more T20 cricket, more countries like China, America and Saudi Arabia coming down the track, it's going to be very hard to fit everything in. And the one format which will probably suffer a bit will be ODIs.It’s unpredictable. Obviously, India, in those conditions. New Zealand have got a very strong squad. I would never underestimate Australia. Then there’s England. Honestly, it's hard to pick the top floor and you can’t write off the rest.","Steve Waugh backs Virat Kohli to overcome his form slump.

Mohammed Shami: 'I just go for wickets; don't care about the economy rate at all'

NEW DELHI: Former all-rounder Irfan Pathan believes that Team India’s ability to handle pressure effectively gives Rohit Sharma ’s side an advantage in the highly anticipated Champions Trophy clash against arch-rivals Pakistan in Dubai on Sunday.India started their campaign with a dominant six-wicket win over Bangladesh, while Pakistan stumbled to a 60-run defeat against New Zealand, leaving them at the bottom of the four-team Group A points table.""When it comes to Pakistan, look, they have plenty of problems in the team,"" Pathan said on the sidelines of International Masters League.""As far as some of the senior guys (are concerned), they don't play that kind of aggressive modern day cricket, especially in white-ball cricket. So, can they change it? It's very difficult. But more than the weaknesses and the strengths, it's all about the India-Pakistan occasion. Whoever handles the occasion really well, that team wins,"" he said.Pathan said the Indian side is better placed to handle pressure situations.""What we have seen in the recent past with the Indian team, we know how to handle a tough situation and the big occasion as well. As far as the talent is concerned, we are far ahead, especially in one-day cricket,"" he said.Pathan said Mohammed Shami will draw a lot of confidence from his five-wicket haul against Bangladesh, which helped him become the fastest Indian bowler to take 200 ODI wickets.""(It was) good to see Mohammed Shami get a fifer. He will get a lot of confidence out of it as well because after injury, coming back on the field, it's not easy especially for fast bowlers (but) he did well,"" Pathan said.""We (India) have good all-round abilities in the team as well. Axar (Patel) is picking up wickets and we have a lot of options as well. Hopefully that momentum will be carried.""""Shubman (Gill) is in tremendous form and once Rohit (Sharma) and Virat (Kohli) keep scoring runs consistently, this team will be unstoppable,"" he added.","Former all-rounder Irfan Pathan believes India's ability to handle pressure gives them an advantage in Champions Trophy clash against Pakistan.

NEW DELHI: Australia's stand-in captain, Steve Smith , expressed confidence in his team's ability to perform well in the Champions Trophy despite the absence of several key players.Smith acknowledged that the team would be missing premier pacers Pat Cummins , Josh Hazlewood, Mitchell Starc, the injured Mitchell Marsh, and the retired Marcus Stoinis. However, he viewed this as an opportunity for younger players to step up and showcase their talent on the global stage.""We haven't done well in the Champions Trophy compared to other ICC events but I think the pressure of playing tournaments always brings out the best in us,"" Smith said.Smith emphasised that the pressure of playing in international tournaments often brings out the best in his team.""I think in the Champions Trophy you have to be focussed from the start and in the last World Cup we were slow to get started and we were under the pump and then we brought our best at the backend of the tournament,"" he added.""In the Champions Trophy, you can't be slow and that is our message to our group of players. It is basically you are playing quarterfinals from the start so you just have to be switched on.""The stand-in captain also stressed that every match is akin to a quarterfinal, adding, ""There is always pressure in international tournaments and we are obviously missing our proven fast bowlers but we are not worried thinking about it as this also offers opportunities to those who are in the team now.""""It is a great opportunity for the younger players to showcase their talent in a world event,"" he concluded.","Australia's stand-in captain, Steve Smith, expressed confidence in his team's ability to perform well in the Champions Trophy.

"After nine months on the sidelines with ACL injury, Lara waits patiently for his chance",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/indian-super-league/top-stories/after-nine-months-on-the-sidelines-with-acl-injury-lara-waits-patiently-for-his-chance/articleshow/118466147.cms,"Signed this season, goalkeeper Lara Sharma is yet to make an appearance for FC Goa

PANAJI: On a flight from Goa to Mumbai last week, FC Goa coach Manolo Marquez had some advice for goalkeeper Lara Sharma .FC Goa were flying to Mumbai for their Indian Super League (ISL) clash and the goalkeeper and coach were seated next to each other. Manolo told Lara: ""You will arrive where your mind wants you to. You can be very good technically, tactically, physically, but if you are not strong enough here (in the mind), you won't make progress.""Lara needed to hear those words.On the sidelines for nine months with an ACL injury he picked up last season, Lara returned to the first team in December but soon realised he still had plenty of ground to cover with his fitness. Manolo also admitted he could have erred in rushing back the goalkeeper too soon, and it's only now that the 25-year-old has been part of the match-day squad for the last three games.Lara is yet to make an appearance for FC Goa, who he joined this season, but knows he must be ready whenever called into action.""I don't know when my chance will come, but whenever I get a chance (to play), I know I have to come up with good performance,"" Lara told TOI during the pre-match media interaction on Friday. ""It does not matter whether I get a chance tomorrow, after a month, two months or even next season. But whenever I play, I have to do well. I have to be patient.""It hasn't been an easy ride for Lara in the Indian Super League (ISL).Having graduated from the famed Tata Football Academy (TFA), Lara had stints with Indian Arrows, India juniors and ATK reserves, before moving to Bengaluru FC where he was second choice to India goalkeeper Gurpreet Singh. Nobody raised an eyebrow when he was loaned to Kerala Blasters due to lack of game time, but just when things were beginning to look up, he picked up an injury in the playoff against Odisha FC.The injury turned out to be serious. It was Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) which needed surgery and a lengthy spell out of action.""It was difficult for me because I never had injuries in my life from the day I start playing football. This was a big injury, it was really, really difficult, especially the first three-four months when I was at home. For pre-season (with Goa), there were senior players like Sandesh (Jhingan), Odei (Onaindia), Iker (Guarrotxena) who motivated me. It helped me during the rehab. It was a difficult period but taught me a lot,"" said Lara.Lara was meant to be first choice goalkeeper for Goa, until the injury disrupted plans.Laxmikant Kattimani was then signed from Hyderabad and the experienced keeper grabbed the top spot. Hrithik Tiwari was forced into action only when Kattimani was injured and since then the youngster has given a good account of himself.Lara knows his time will come.""The team is performing good, Hrithik is also playing well. It's been tough for me (on the sidelines). When I returned in December, I thought the injury was gone, I'm good, but on the pitch it was different. When I spoke with the coach, he told me I need more time (to make a comeback), so I started seeing videos of my training sessions every day. I noticed I had to improve on some things.""Then there were doubts too whether the injury will reoccur. Speaking with someone like Sandesh helps a lot. He's always positive (with his words). He's always motivating and told me injuries are part of a footballer's life. Recovery takes time, it's a process and I'll return to the field (for a competitive game),"" said Lara.",Lara Sharma is yet to make an appearance for FC Goa this season. The 25-year-old has been part of the match-day squad for the last three games. Lara returned to the first team in December but soon realised he still had plenty of ground to cover with his fitness.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118466119,imgsize-50578,width-400,resizemode-4/118466119.jpg"

Liverpool 's unbeaten streak in the Premier League extended to 22 matches, but their second consecutive 2-2 draw, this time against Aston Villa , gives Arsenal renewed optimism in the title chase.Liverpool extended their advantage to eight points over Arsenal at the top of the leaderboard, but Arsenal now have played a match less.A point does little for Villa's hope of returning to the Champions League next season as they remain in ninth. A challenging fixture awaits Slot's squad as they prepare to face Manchester City away from home on Sunday.Initially ahead through Mohamed Salah's strike, Liverpool found themselves trailing after Youri Tielemans and Ollie Watkins turned the tide in Villa's favour.A deflected effort from Trent Alexander-Arnold brought Liverpool level, yet they should have secured all three points when Darwin Nunez squandered an excellent opportunity after coming off the bench.The hosts nearly snatched victory in the closing moments, with both Morgan Rogers and Donyell Malen coming close to finding the winner.An early opportunity for Villa saw Marcus Rashford's cross deflected into the net by Virgil van Dijk, but the effort was nullified due to Rashford being in an offside position.The breakthrough came at 29 minutes, though Villa were ultimately responsible for their own undoing. Diogo Jota intercepted Andres Garcia's poor backpass and generously set up Salah, who netted his 29th goal of the campaign.Within nine minutes, Villa equalised when Liverpool's inadequate clearance from a free-kick landed perfectly for Tielemans, who executed a skilful volley into the net.Jota squandered a golden opportunity to put the visitors ahead, sending his shot well off target despite being one-on-one with Emi Martinez.Villa capitalised on Liverpool's defensive lapse before the interval, as Watkins found himself unmarked to head Lucas Digne's cross into the distant corner.Liverpool dominated the second half proceedings, helping Slot maintain his unbeaten away record in the Premier League.Alexander-Arnold's increasing prominence in the match led to his equalising goal at 60 minutes, with a shot that deflected off Tyrone Mings.In pursuit of victory, Slot introduced Luis Diaz and Nunez as substitutes, with one of them having a clear opportunity to secure three crucial points.Presented with an unguarded net after Dominik Szoboszlai's pass, Nunez missed the target, leaving his manager visibly frustrated.",Liverpool held to a 2-2 draw by Aston Villa at Villa Park. Mohamed Salah and Youri Tielemans scored for Liverpool. Ollie Watkins and Trent Alexander-Arnold scored for Villa.

Bayern Munich clinched their spot in the Champions League's last 16 with a last-gasp goal against Celtic on Tuesday. The German giants will be joined by Club Brugge and Benfica , who also progressed to the next round. But it wasn't to be for AC Milan , who made a painful exit after a draw with Feyenoord .Bayern, who held a 2-1 advantage from the away leg, struggled to extend their lead at home. Harry Kane came close but struck the crossbar in the first half, while it was the visitors from Scotland who took a surprising lead after 63 minutes when Nicolas Kuehn, who previously played for Bayern, capitalised on Kim Min-jae's defensive error to slot the ball into the bottom corner.That meant the tie was heading for extra time, but Bayern ultimately would not need to go that far as they scored in the fourth minute of injury time.Davies scored from close range to level the match at 1-1, securing Bayern's progression with a 3-2 aggregate victory in the prestigious European competition.The draw scheduled for Friday will reveal whether Kompany's side faces Bayer Leverkusen or Atletico Madrid in the round of 16.Earlier, seven-time European Cup winners Milan were eliminated by Feyenoord, following their 1-1 draw at San Siro. It took the Dutch club through 2-1 on aggregate.Santiago Gimenez, facing his former team after his recent departure, scored from close proximity in the opening minute, bringing Milan level on aggregate.The match took a turn when Milan's Hernandez received his second yellow card early in the second period, resulting in his dismissal. Carranza equalised for Feyenoord with 73 minutes on the clock.In the closing moments, Feyenoord's Read was dismissed with a red card, though his team had already secured their progression in the tie.They now await to face either Inter Milan or Arsenal in the last-16 stage.In Lisbon, Benfica secured their progression despite a 3-3 home draw with Monaco, winning 4-3 on aggregate, setting up a clash with either Barcelona or Liverpool.The Portuguese side, who had secured a 1-0 away victory in the previous week, strengthened their position when Kerem Akturkoglu found the net halfway through the opening period.Monaco mounted a strong response as Takumi Minamino and Eliesse Ben Seghir scored before and after the interval, bringing the aggregate score level.Vangelis Pavlidis converted from the spot, marking his seventh goal in six Champions League appearances, levelling the match at 2-2, before Monaco's substitute George Ilenikhena responded with another goal.However, the tie swung decisively back towards Benfica as Orkun Kokcu made it 3-3 on the night in the 84th minute.Young sensation Chemsdine Talbi netted twice to help Club Brugge secure a 3-1 away win against Atalanta in Italy, sealing a comprehensive 5-2 aggregate victory.Following Talbi's double, Ferran Jutgla added a brilliant goal as the Belgian side built upon their 2-1 home advantage from the previous week's first leg. They will now face either Lille or Aston Villa in the round of 16.Despite Atalanta's 29 shots at goal, they fell victim to counter-attacks from the visitors, with Ademola Lookman's goal early in the second half providing little comfort.Lookman missed from the penalty spot and Atalanta skipper Rafael Toloi received a red card in the closing stages, leading to Atalant's elimination.","Bayern Munich secure their place in the Champions League's last 16 with a last- gasp goal against Celtic on Tuesday.

Arne Slot confident Liverpool can handle Premier League title race pressure,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/epl/top-stories/arne-slot-confident-liverpool-can-handle-premier-league-title-race-pressure/articleshow/118356270.cms,"Arne Slot. (Liverpool FC Photo)

Liverpool boss Arne Slot insists his side can cope with the mounting pressure of the Premier League title race despite showing signs of nerves in their tense 2-1 win over Wolves.The Reds travel to Aston Villa on Wednesday, knowing a victory will extend their lead to 10 points over second-placed Arsenal as they push for a record-equalling 20th English title.However, Liverpool have looked less assured in recent weeks. They nearly squandered a two-goal lead against Wolves and had already suffered a late collapse in the Merseyside derby when Everton’s James Tarkowski scored a stoppage-time equaliser. Their recent FA Cup exit at the hands of second-tier Plymouth has only added to concerns that the treble chasers may be feeling the pressure.Left-back Andrew Robertson admitted nerves were natural as the finish line approaches, but Slot pointed to Liverpool’s ability to grind out tight wins as proof they won’t buckle.“This is happening because we are nearing the end of the season, not because of us, but because of what people make of it,” Slot said on Tuesday. “We have won plenty of games by just one goal, home and away. I remember Crystal Palace away when it was tight in the end. If this happens now, people talk about nerves. But securing a win in the Premier League, especially at 1-0, always involves hard work and defending.”Adding to Liverpool’s challenge is Arsenal’s remarkable 15-match unbeaten run in the league since their last defeat at Newcastle on November 2.Several Liverpool players have prior title race experience from their 2020 Premier League triumph under Slot’s predecessor, Jurgen Klopp. Slot himself successfully managed pressure when leading Feyenoord to the Dutch title. However, he remains cautious about overvaluing past experiences.“We lean on the players. They have to show up and perform,” he said. “We don’t hold meetings on how to handle pressure—it doesn’t work that way. Experience helps, but we shouldn’t overvalue it. The ones who won the league here last time did it in the COVID era with no fans, and at one point, they were 25 points ahead. That’s hardly pressure.”Slot acknowledges that Aston Villa, who boast a formidable home record, pose a serious challenge for Liverpool.“When you see the fixture list, Villa away is one of the toughest you can face. They have a very good manager with a strong game plan,” Slot said.Despite not being at their best against Wolves, Slot believes that grinding out a win after the disappointment against Everton was crucial.“These are the games you must win if you want to achieve something. We didn’t play our best, but we fought until the end. That tells you a lot about this team.”Liverpool will be without Cody Gakpo and Joe Gomez for the Villa clash, with the latter set to be sidelined for ""a number of weeks"" due to a hamstring injury.",Liverpool boss Arne Slot insists his side can cope with the pressure of the Premier League title race.

Elena Rybakina ’s tennis is so smooth it gives satin a fair run. The 25-year-old rips aces almost casually and steps in and hits through the court, making it all look effortless.“It doesn’t come easy at all,” the world No. 7 said. “I’m trying to work on different things on the court. If it looks easy, I’m happy. But definitely it’s not an easy sport. I always play aggressive, today a lot of things went my way.”The Kazakh, 6 ft in her tennis shoes, was in and out of the court in 72 minutes, of which 10 minutes were lost to a drizzle. She was through 6-3, 6-2 against the Japanese Moyuka Uchijima in the second round of the Dubai Duty Free tennis championships .On a rain hit day at the WTA 1000 event , where world No. 4 Jasmine Paolini’s match against German Eva Lys was paused at match point 6-2, 6-5 (30-40) for five hours – before the players returned on court and the Italian closed on the first point – Rybakina ’s play provided the sunshine. She had seven aces and won 26 of 32 points on her first serve.It might be because the 23-year-old Japanese’ play matched well with Rybakina, who was meetingthe ball in her comfort zone and striking freely. The small crowd in attendance on an outside court recognised they were watching a special talent and got behind the Kazakh, who looked a cut above, even in tricky conditions.Next up for Rybakina, in the roundof-16 is Spain’s Paula Badosa, the other player to dodge the rain on the day. Badosa, back in the top-10, leads the headto-head 4-3, but the Moscow-born Rybakina has won their last two meetings.Rybakina, cheered on by her new coach Davide Sanguinetti, whose calls of ‘come on Elena, let’s go’ was a constant during the hour-long affair, didn’t need any encouragement.Rybakina, caught in a crossfire with the WTA, who investigated and suspended her coach Stefano Vukov and suspended the 37-year-old Croat for a year for the abusive nature of his conduct.“It’s not easy of course,” Rybakina said of her situation. “(I’m) very disappointed (with) the way it’s been handled, just the outcome. But anyway, I need to focus on my tournament. It’s what I’m trying to do. Hopefully I can just keep on playing, keep on winning.”Rybakina, who maintains she hasn’t been mistreated by Vukov, despite new information emerging in The Athletic which noted that Vukov’s behaviour prompted the Wimbledon champion’s inner circle to approach the WTA as they feared for the safety of the player.While the top players – world No.1 Aryna Sabalenka, Coco Gauff and Jessica Pegula – have refused to comment on Rybakina’s situation out of respect for the player, the Kazakh said no onehad offered support.“I don’t need support,” Rybakina said. “There are a couple of players (with whom) I’m in touch with more, but to say that I have very, very close friends on Tour is not true just because we are competing against each other. Everybody’s surrounded by their teams.”Asked what she does in her downtime, especially here in Dubai where she bought an apartment two years ago, Rybakina said she enjoys going to the beach and indulging herself in the shops.","Elena Rybakina beat Moyuka Uchijima 6-3, 6-2 in the second round of the Dubai Duty Free tennis championships.

DUBAI: The Women's Tennis Association's efforts to create a safe environment for players isn't lost on the leading ladies in the Dubai Duty Free tennis championships, but that awareness is delivered with a coordinating conjunction. While they applauded the WTA 's stand in general they refused to comment on the suspension of Stefano Vukov, coach of Elena Rybakina.Coco Gauff ,the third seed at the WTA 1000 event here, steered clear of Vukov's oneyear ban because she knew the 25-year-old was unhappy with the Tour's decision to ban her coach. ""It's nice that the WTA is out there to protect players, I definitely feel protected by them,"" the 20-year-old American said, adding the Tour put up contact information on bathroom stalls in lockerrooms around the world, providing an avenue for players to report abuse anonymously.The 37-year-old Vukov — a former player from Croatia — started working with Rybakina in Febuary 2019. Rybakina, the world No. 7, who opens her campaign here against qualifier Moyuka Uchijima, denied Vukov had ever mistreated her.The Moscow-born Kazakh's game improved rapidly when she teamed with the Croat, her ranking climbing from 191 to the top-40 in less than a year. Rybakina, who won Wimbledon in 2022, quickly became the talking point in tennis circles, not just for her obvious talent and smooth style of play, but also because of Vukov, whose behavior was obviously out of order. A report in The Athletic noted that Vukov had called Rybakina ‘stupid', telling her that without him she would ‘still be in Russia picking potatoes.'Rybakina, who has struggled with her health, especially in the past year, split with Vukov last August, but rehired him in January adding a twist to an already complicated situation. In between she started working with former Wimbledon champion Goran Ivanisevic, who quit her team after the Australian Open. The Kazakh, who says she's still getting coached by Vukov on the phone, is also working with Italian Davide Sanguinetti.""I'm disappointed with the situation, and how the process went,"" Rybakina said of the decision to ban Vukov.Abusive coaches and parents are not new to tennis and the WTA has been quick on the button, famously with Jim Pierce and Damir Dokic, both of who fell in the dads from hell column and faced bans from the Tour.Gauff said, ""That's important in our sport because a lot of times victims don't even know they are victims. It has happened so many times in this sport. You see former players speaking out (on abuse) years after their careers ended.""She added, ""It's a unique sport, you're 14, 15 and out of the country, most of the time you aren't traveling with your parents, so anything can happen.""And sometimes it is the parents who are the problem. Jessica Pegula, the world No. 5, said she didn't know the details of Rybakina's case. ""I don't really think I should know,"" she said with a shrug, ""People nowadays have this feeling that they have a right to someone's personal life, with social media they (feel) they have the right to know things. The point of safeguarding is to be able to report private information and know your name's not going to be out there. Maybe for the victim, you don't want anything coming out that would make them uncomfortable,"" Pegula said.","Elena Rybakina's coach Stefano Vukov banned for one year by the WTA. Coco Gauff, Jessica Pegula and others applaud WTA's efforts to create a safe environment for players. The Kazakh world No. 7 says she is disappointed with the decision.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118344172,imgsize-65742,width-400,resizemode-4/118344172.jpg"

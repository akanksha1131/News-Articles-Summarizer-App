Why Indian batters are struggling against left-arm spin,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/new-zealand-in-india/why-indian-batters-are-struggling-against-left-arm-spin/articleshow/114962673.cms,"There's no denying faults in technique have slowly crept into the game of the T20-oriented modern batsman

If you're an Indian cricket follower with a sense of history, the capitulation against Ajaz Patel at the Wankhede Stadium on Sunday might just hurt you a little more.Ask any Indian batter of the 1980s and they would say playing the likes of Padmakar Shivalkar, Rajinder Goel or Raghuram Bhat on the domestic circuit was way more challenging than squaring up against foreign left-arm spinners.When Sunil Gavaskar finally got out to Pakistan's Iqbal Qasim on a minefield in his last Test innings at the Chinnaswamy after scoring 96, it was regarded as an exception that merely underlined the rule of general dominance by the batters.Over the years, left-arm finger spinners continued to be largely seen as restrictive options and it's hard to find one from visiting sides winning a Test match on his own on Indian soil. Michael Clarke, with a spell of 6-9 at Wankhede in 2004 came close, but VVS Laxman and Sachin Tendulkar had done enough with two superb half-centuries before that which helped India win.Things, though, have dramatically turned around since the last decade. While India's last Test series loss at home in 2012 was facilitated by England left-arm spinner Monty Panesar, little-known left-armers like Steve O'Keefe, Tom Hartley or Matthew Kuhnemann have played significant roles in India's losses in India in the last few years.But what happened against Ajaz and Mitchell Santner in the series against New Zealand - where they two took 28 of the 60 Indian wickets to fall in the series - topped it all. Superstars like Virat Kohli and Shubman Gill looked like sitting ducks and it always seemed a matter of time before the proverbial death rattle would be heard.It's true that the quality of pitches on which Test matches are being played these days are way more conducive to spin than it used to be. In addition to that, the Decision Review System (DRS) has come into play, which has taken front-foot pad play almost out of the window. In this day and age, pad as the first line of defence doesn't exist anymore and every ball has to be played with the bat, which wasn't always the case for the earlier generation.Still, there's no denying the faults in technique of the modern-day batter that have played a role in this decline in the quality of batsmanship against left-arm spin. Former India batter WV Raman, who also bowled left-arm finger spin, feels that growing up with the T20 mindset is taking its toll on the defence of the young Indian batter.""It's basically two things. While the new-age batter more often than not plays with hard hands, the bat, too, doesn't come down straight. If the bat comes straight and the ball turns a little too much, then there is always the chance of missing the outside-edge. But when the bat is coming that wee bit across the line, the outside-edge always becomes more vulnerable,"" Raman told TOI.There was a notable exception in Rahul Dravid , whose bat used to come down from the gully region, but he had the genius to adjust it at the point of contact and found a way to be behind the line of the ball. The hard-hand bit is a product of too much T20s, where every player is looking to hit the ball with ferocity. ""Soft hands are a thing of the past and it means the edges carry to the slips more regularly,"" Raman said.Sunil Subramaniam, another prominent left-arm spinner of yesteryears and one of R Ashwin's early mentors, feels the tendency to play beside the line and jabbing at the ball is making the modern-day batter vulnerable against left-arm spin.""Tendulkar, too, sometimes used to get out to left-arm spin, in fact I got him out thrice in domestic cricket. But Tendulkar used to look for shots over extra-cover because that was one of his favourite scoring areas and sometimes gave catches in that region. But I hardly remember him struggling against the ball turning away playing a defensive shot. This is completely a new phenomenon,"" Subramaniam said.Tendulkar did struggle against Panesar in the 2012 series, but by then he was in the last phase of his career. Subramaniam, who had 285 first-class wickets, explained that GR Viswanath was one player who used to play beside the line against left-arm spin successfully.""But the beauty of GRV was that he could play late with soft hands, a quality that the current crop is losing. The only player in recent times who had the correct technique to deal with it was Cheteshwar Pujara, but then he is no longer part of the team,"" the renowned coach said.He also added that batters these days don't play spinners from their hands, thereby trying to read them from the pitch, which becomes difficult on sharp turners.",India's capitulation against Ajaz Patel at the Wankhede Stadium on Sunday might just hurt you a little more. There's no denying the faults in technique of the modern-day batter that have played a role in this decline in the quality of batsmanship against left-arm spin.

Should Test matches be reduced to four-day affairs?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/new-zealand-in-india/should-test-matches-be-reduced-to-four-day-affairs/articleshow/114963144.cms,"With matches struggling to last the distance, former India captain

'Give Tests to metros, white-ball games to the rest'

MUMBAI: The 0-3 drubbing India received at the hands of New Zealand at home not only exposed their frailties against spin bowling but also continued an interesting trend. Both the second and third Tests, in Pune and Mumbai respectively, were played on turning pitches and finished inside three days. Even the first Test in Bengaluru technically was over in four days, as Day One was a complete washout.With home teams gunning for wins that will land them precious points for a place in the World Test Championship (WTC) final, Tests are struggling to last the duration. Mostly these Tests are played either on spin-friendly pitches in the subcontinent or fast and bouncy wickets in SENA countries. Of 25 Tests played in India in the last five years, 12 finished inside three days, seven within four days, and one match - the third (pink ball) Test between India and England in Ahmedabad - was over in just two days.Most home Tests in this period were played on rank turners as India scrambled for WTC points. The advent of the Decision Review System (DRS) has meant that marginal decisions also go in favour of bowlers. The technique and temperament of the batters too has been found wanting in the post-T20 era, something that head coach Gautam Gambhir alluded to recently.Former India skipper Dilip Vengsarkar, for one, feels it's time Tests are officially reduced to four-day affairs instead of five. ""Tests should be reduced to four-day games because most of the matches are getting over in under four days. Also, most of the affiliated boards of the International Cricket Council (ICC), apart from India, Australia, and England, are not in good financial condition, so four-day Tests could save them some expenses. It is financially draining and too expensive for a team like West Indies to travel for Test matches to the rest of the world.""Besides, it's unfair to sell tickets for five days when the matches are getting over in three days,"" Vengsarkar told TOI following India's 0-3 whitewash at the hands of New Zealand. India lost the third Test at the Wankhede Stadium by 25 runs in two-and-a-half days. Former England captain Michael Vaughan and the late Australian leg spin great Shane Warne had, in the past, also batted for four-day Tests.Around four years back, the ICC had seriously mulled the idea of four-day Tests but in Jan 2020 the MCC, custodians of the laws of cricket, stated that Tests will continue to be five-day affairs. The MCC, however, did add that it saw ""some benefits"" of the ICC's proposal.""Cricket committee and MCC world cricket committee have discussed the issue and although they can see some benefits that four-day Test cricket could bring, both committees believe that Test cricket should continue to be played over five days,"" the MCC had said in a statement back then.There have been a few four-day Tests in recent years, including the England versus Ireland game at Lord's in June 2023 and a South Africa-Zimbabwe Test. Both were sanctioned by the ICC. In India, in the Ranji Trophy , matches in the league stage are played over four days.Another interesting aspect of the Mumbai Test, which concluded on Sunday afternoon, was the number of spectators who flocked to watch the match each day - at least 18,000. In fact, there was an enthusiastic crowd of around 20,000 on Day Three. Vengsarkar asserted that the BCCI must now schedule Tests only in the bigger cities and the metros while awarding white-ball matches - ODIs and T20Is - to smaller centres.""The support the Mumbaikars provided to Test cricket was overwhelming. As compared to the other venues during this series, they turned up in huge numbers even for a dead rubber. I guess the time has come to stage cricket only at Test centres like New Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Bengaluru, and Chennai. The One-Dayers and T20Is can be staged at the rest of the centres,"" the 116-Test veteran rounded off.Since the 2016-17 home season, the BCCI has been awarding Tests to smaller centres like Rajkot, Vizag, and Pune.","Former India skipper Dilip Vengsarkar feels it's time Tests are officially reduced to four-day affairs instead of five.

NE WDELHI: New Zealand stunning India 3-0 at home for an unprecedented series win has left Australia wary as pacer Josh Hazlewood feels that the embarrassing loss might awaken a 'sleeping giant' ahead of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy Down Under.The Kiwis on Sunday completed a stunning series sweep, handing India their first-ever 3-0 whitewash at home.With the marquee series set to commence from November 22 in Australia, Hazlewood said that the loss against the Kiwis might have shaken India's confidence and they aren't sure what to expect from Rohit Sharma and Co.""It might awaken a sleeping giant, so to speak. We will see that when they come out,"" Hazlewood told Sydney Morning Herald.""It is obviously better them losing 3-0 than winning 3-0, easily. The confidence might have taken a bit of a hit. A lot of them have been out here (in Australia), but there is a few batters who have not, so they will be a bit unsure of what to expect. I do not think you can read too much into it. The results are obviously good for us in a way.""""Credit to the Kiwi boys. They played outstanding cricket. To win 3-0 in India is unbelievable. It's hard enough to win one game there, let alone every match of the series,"" he said.The Indian team experienced a series of batting collapses throughout the series against the BlackCaps.In the Bengaluru Test, India was dismissed for a mere 46 runs in the first innings on a seaming pitch under overcast conditions. Despite gaining a lead, they suffered another collapse in their second innings, as New Zealand hunted down the 107-run target.The second Test saw India bowl out New Zealand for 259 runs. However, their batting faltered once again, resulting in a total of 156 runs. Chasing 359 runs for victory, the Indian batsmen disappointed once more, getting dismissed for 245 runs after a promising start.The third and final Test in Mumbai was another low-scoring encounter. India were set a target of 147 runs, seemingly their easiest chase of the series. But despite a fighting half-century from Rishabh Pant, the batting lineup crumbled, ultimately bowled out for 121 runs.The India vs Australia series commences on November 22 with the first Test taking place in Perth. Adelaide Oval will host the second Test from December 6th to 10th, featuring the captivating day-night format under lights. Brisbane's Gabba will be the venue for the third Test, scheduled from December 14th to 18th.

Will Young shows he belongs at No. 3,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/new-zealand-in-india/will-young-shows-he-belongs-at-no-3/articleshow/114963754.cms,"New Zealand's Will Young. (Photo by Idrees Mohammed/AFP via Getty Images)

BENGALURU: Had a soothsayer told New Zealand's top order bat Will Young that he would walk away with the Player of the Series in what eventually turned out to be a washout of epic proportions over India in the three-Test series, he would not have believed.Not so young at 31 and only 16 Test matches old prior to coming to India, Young has often been reduced to playing waterboy for his team. He waited three years after his maiden call-up to make his Test debut against West Indies in Hamilton in Dec 2021. Even against India, he was a replacement for Kane Williamson , who didn't make the trip owing to a groin injury sustained in Sri Lanka.Young, who turns up for Nottingham in the English county, proved a thorn in India's spin-laden side. He spent 598 minutes in the middle across six innings and compiled 244 runs, the third most after Rishabh Pant (261) and teammate Rachin Ravindra (256).He showed his mastery over spin in the opening Test at the M Chinnaswamy stadium here when he elegantly drove Kuldeep Yadav through covers for his first runs. The 72 minutes Young (33 runs) spent at the crease in New Zealand's first innings in Bengaluru was full of promise until he top-edged Ravindra Jadeja to gift his wicket away. He made amends in the second innings, opening up against pacer Mohammed Siraj but playing Kuldeep, Ravindra Jadeja and R Ashwin on merit. He was all class, craft and positive intent, middling the ball with ease during his unbeaten run of 48.In Pune, Ashwin got his number in both innings, but not before he had added 41 crucial runs. His half-centuries (71 and 51) in the final Test at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai were probably his coming-of-age knocks. He played with far more confidence and courage, backing his methods and playing with soft hands on a tricky surface. His game oozed smartness as he bearded the Indian spinners on their home turf with ease.As it turned out, Young not only was a strong replacement for Williamson but actually owned the No. 3 spot. ""When I do get an opportunity to play, I'm more excited to go out and do my own thing in my way and not try to replace Kane or whoever it might be. I see it as a great opportunity rather than big boots to fill. I try not to bat like Kane, I try to bat like me and do it my own way,"" he said.He finished the series with an average of 48.8, playing a crucial role in the Black Caps' remarkable win. ""As a New Zealander coming over here and playing in Indian conditions, it's always going to be slightly more satisfying to score runs against spin,"" Young said.This series was probably the impetus Young's career needed especially to cut out the noise of his talent being a mere promise without an innings to highlight it.",Will Young named Player of the Series in New Zealand's three-Test series win over India. The 31-year-old spent 598 minutes in the middle across six innings and compiled 244 runs. Young was a replacement for Kane Williamson who didn't make the trip owing to a groin injury sustained in Sri Lanka.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114963826,imgsize-40598,width-400,resizemode-4/114963826.jpg"

CSK might rest MS Dhoni for few games to get the best out of him: Ricky Ponting,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/ipl/top-stories/csk-might-rest-ms-dhoni-for-few-games-to-get-the-best-out-of-him-ricky-ponting/articleshow/114954534.cms,"MS Dhoni.

Former Australia captain Ricky Ponting believes Chennai Super Kings (CSK) might strategically rest MS Dhoni in the upcoming IPL 2025 season. This comes after CSK retained the former Indian captain for the next season of the IPL. Ponting suggests that this strategy could help CSK utilize Dhoni's experience and skills most effectively.Dhoni, who retired from international cricket in 2020, has been an integral part of CSK's success over the years. He led the team to five IPL titles, showcasing his leadership and cricketing prowess.“Two seasons ago he probably had his worst season, but then last year again, he bounced back into really impacting some games like the MS Dhoni of old,” Ponting said on the recent episode of The ICC Review.Despite a challenging season two years ago, Dhoni bounced back strongly last year, reminding everyone of his capabilities. Ponting acknowledges Dhoni's impact on the game and suggests that CSK might opt to rest him occasionally to manage his workload.“I think it will be exactly the same now…they might not get him through the whole season. They might think about leaving him out for a game and resting him up here and there to make sure that they’re getting the best out of him.”Ponting recognizes Dhoni's value to the team, not just as a player but also as a mentor and leader. He believes Dhoni's presence, whether on or off the field, will be crucial for CSK.“Any team that he's in, whether he's captain or not, he's always going to be a mentor and a leader around that group, whether he’s playing, whether he’s sitting on the sidelines, that’s just who he is…he’s crucial to Chennai, for that leadership that he brings on and off the field,” Ponting stated.Ponting highlights Dhoni's ability to maintain a high level of performance throughout his long career. He admires Dhoni's consistency and ranks him among the best players in the game.“The best players are the ones that are able to maintain such a high level for a long time…for 10, 12, 14-year careers.”Ponting emphasizes Dhoni's adaptability and evolution as a player. He points out Dhoni's shift in batting position and how he continues to make an impact despite not always facing a large number of deliveries.“He’s actually batting the last 20 balls of an innings now but still showing that you can make a big impact on the game by doing that,” Ponting added.","Ricky Ponting believes Chennai Super Kings (CSK) might strategically rest MS Dhoni in the upcoming IPL 2025 season.

It's a rugby nation, now there's an extra football league in our local competition, so cricket after losing in Sri Lanka, the press after that has changed around completely.

NEW DELHI: Powerhouse India on Sunday suffered an unprecedented and embarrassing 3-0 series loss at home against New Zealand just before their high-profile tour of Australia which starts from November 22.The recent whitewash against the Kiwis means a demoralized Indian team now has got to win 4 matches out of 5 Down Under in the upcoming Border-Gavaskar Trophy to make it to the WTC Final on their own.With very less time to regather and regroup ahead of the marquee tour, questions are being raised over the team's preparedness for the high profile series.The Indian team also recently cancelled their warm-up game ahead of the first Test in Perth and legendary Sunil Gavaskar feels that the Australia tour will be a huge mountain to climb.Gavaskar was critical of India's spin plans against the Kiwis and slammed the 'short-gain policy' of producing rank-turners.""Australia looks like a huge mountain to climb after the Indian team stumbled terribly on a speed bump called New Zealand. Nobody, not even the Kiwis themselves, would have thought of a clean sweep against India, and that too in India. It has happened thanks to the short-gain policy of preparing pitches for our spinners when just about everybody in the cricketing world agrees that we have the best new-ball bowler in the world across all formats,"" Gavaskar wrote in his column for Sportstar.Gavaskar questioned India's decision to cancel the three-day intra-squad match with the 'A' side from November 15 to 17. The team management did so to focus on additional net practice but Gavaskar feels that the match would have helped the youngsters, particularly the ones who are travelling Down Under for the first time.""We are now told that the warm-up game before the first Test has been called off. Wouldn’t it benefit youngsters like (Yashasvi) Jaiswal and Sarfaraz (Khan), who are playing on Australian pitches for the first time, to get some runs under their belt and get a feel of what the pitches will be like?""And if they get out early, they can still get into the nets and practice against the throw-down specialist or the net bowlers. For bowlers like Akash Deep and Harshit Rana too, it’s essential to know the best length to bowl in Australia, as it’s different from India, and the best learning is in a proper match and not just net practice.""Let’s just hope that good sense prevails, and even now, though it’s too late, some warm-up games can be arranged, even if it’s against the State A teams like Queensland A and Victoria A. These warm-up games will give the first-timers to Australia and youngsters good practice and a better chance to succeed, Gavaskar wrote.The first India vs Australia Test is scheduled for November 22-26.

This time, it was the pace, skill and power of Yadwad as he vindicated the trust shown in him by veteran Coyle with a defence-splitting turn in the midfield that began the build-up to his first goal. The 23-year-old then made a run into the Jamshedpur box that could not be contained by the defenders led by Jamil's go-to man and captain Ashutosh Mehta as his shot at goal took a slight deflection en route the goal.There was no respite for Jamshedpur's weary defence, and Jamil at the stands, as two minutes later, in the 24th minute, Yadwad turned provider to Connor Shields - who had been missing his first goal of the season - with a pass outside the box that the Scottish shot into the right of the goal with Mehta at the other end.There was, however, no improvement in Jamshedpur's game as every trick in Khalid's book looked to have backfired in absence of defensive talisman Stepehn Eze, missing the match with a red card in the last game at NorthEast United.The script stayed the same after the change of ends as Chaudhary lost the ball a little outside the box to a Yadwad charge at him from the left in the 54th minute. It was Wilmar Jordan Gill who landed the pass from Yadwad and with only the goalkeeper to beat, made no mistake in adding the fifth to his goal tally this season.With both Jordan Murray and Javier Siverio having a bad day in office, and Jamil's 4-4-2 formation failing to stop the visitors' march, it was only a matter of time before Chennaiyin scored again and delivered a back-to-back five-goal assault on the Men of Steel. It was Lucas Brambilla's swerving solo effort from outside the box that left Gomes in another no position for a save.The hosts, with fans already leaving the Furnace, got a consolation goal after earning a controversial penalty kick from a Yadwad hand ball in the box - that was preceded by an offside call against Jamshedpur. Veteran Murray made no mistake to send in the spot kick but it was too little to ease the team and coach Jamil's disappointment after a great start to the season.",Jamshedpur lost 1-5 to Chennaiyin FC at JRD Tata Sports Complex on Monday.

Manchester United off to worst Premier League start after Chelsea draw,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/epl/top-stories/manchester-united-off-to-worst-premier-league-start-after-chelsea-draw/articleshow/114926334.cms,"Manchester United's Bruno Fernandes applauds fans after the match.

Moises Caicedo 's goal prevented Manchester United from securing a win in their first Premier League game since Erik ten Hag 's exit. Chelsea earned a 1-1 draw at Old Trafford on Sunday.Interim manager Ruud van Nistelrooy celebrated on the touchline after Bruno Fernandes scored a penalty, 20 minutes before the end. Caicedo then equalized for Chelsea, moving them above Arsenal into fourth place based on goal difference.Manchester United remain 13th in the table, six points away from the top four. Their 12 points in 10 games mark their worst league start since the 1986/87 season. Ruben Amorim , who will take over from van Nistelrooy later this month, was not present as he is preparing for a Champions League match with Sporting Lisbon against Manchester City.Despite a better performance compared to heavy home defeats by Liverpool and Tottenham, United still showed issues that led to Ten Hag's dismissal. Van Nistelrooy previously led United to a 5-2 win over Leicester to reach the League Cup quarter-finals.Chelsea, having lost just once in nine Premier League games, posed a tougher challenge for a United side lacking in confidence. In a tepid first half, both teams hit the woodwork with attempts from Noni Madueke and Marcus Rashford.Chelsea's Pedro Neto nearly scored early in the second half, but his shot missed the post. Cole Palmer, a pivotal player for Chelsea, was kept in check by United's midfield duo Casemiro and Manuel Ugarte.Van Nistelrooy acknowledged the ongoing struggle with goal-scoring, saying, ""Over the last games we played we lost some points where we didn't convert our chances. When you create a lot, all through the season so far, I'm not too worried the players will get in a flow with results and confidence growing. Results will come.""Alejandro Garnacho missed a key chance for United, while Fernandes scored from the penalty after a foul on Rasmus Hojlund. Caicedo's quick reply came from a clearance off a corner, scoring from the edge of the box.Chelsea manager Enzo Maresca praised Caicedo, stating, ""Since we arrived Moi is doing fantastic. The problem with Moi is because the club paid big money, people expect them to be the best. It is normal to be a bit up and down. We are trying to improve him and he is showing how good he is.""Chelsea could have added another when Enzo Fernandez missed a close chance. United came close to a late winner with Garnacho's acrobatic attempt, but it went over.","Chelsea earned a 1-1 draw at Old Trafford on Sunday.

Alaaeddine Ajaraie continued to fuel NorthEast United ’s brightly shining lamp during the Diwali festivities as his consecutive double strike helped the hosts beat Odisha FC in a five-goal thriller in Guwahati on Sunday.The Moroccan forward followed up his double in the last match against Jamshedpur FC with another brace at Indira Gandhi Athletic Stadium as the hosts overcame the Juggernauts 3-2 with Guillermo Fernandez adding another for the Highlanders. Hugo Boumous and Diego Mauricio scored one each for Odisha but could not help their team salvage a point from the game.The hosts started the match on a strong note and allowed Odisha no time on the ball. The attacking quartet of Parthib Gogoi, Nestor Albiach, Jithin MS and Ajaraie made life difficult for the Odisha defenders.The home side was rewarded for their high pressing game when Ajaraie combined with local sensation Gogoi and found a little space just outside the box. Following a couple of touches, Ajaraie took a powerful shot from distance which beat Amrinder Singh all ends up for the lead in 12th minute. This was Ajaraie’s goal in seven consecutive league appearances, beating Elano Blumer’s earlier record of six games.Upbeat with the early lead, NEUFC added more firepower in the attacking third and Ajaraie finally completed his brace following Mohammed Bemammer and Jithin’s touches on the ball. With only Amrinder to beat from left, Ajaraie obliged in the 40th minute.Down by two goals, Odisha assistant coach Anthony Fernandes brought in midfielder Hugo Boumous and defenders Saviour Gama and Thoiba Singh at the break. The changes worked for the visitors as Gama and Boumous combined to pull one back at the hour mark.Energised by the strike, Odisha FC pushed forward to draw level, but it was never to be. Juan Pedro Benali’s boys put the scoreline beyond Odisha’s reach when substitute Fernandez converted Ajaraie’s cross in the 71st minute to make it 3-1 against the run of play.Odisha did pull another back in the 83rd minute with their Brazilian striker Mauricio scoring brilliantly from a free-kick, but it proved to be a little late to snatch a point from the hosts’ jaws. Despite Odisha pressing for the equaliser in the last 15 minutes of the game, Benali’s boys held their fort to register their third win of the league this season.",NorthEast United beat Odisha FC 3-2 in a five-goal thriller in Guwahati.

Battered JFC take on Chennaiyin at home,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/indian-super-league/battered-jfc-take-on-chennaiyin-at-home/articleshow/114917602.cms,"(Photo credit: ISL)

After four wins from five matches, Jamshedpur FC were humbled in their last game when they were thrashed 0-5 by Northeast United FC in Guwahati last Saturday.It was a disappointing show from the former Shield winners and they will hope to bounce back strongly against Chennaiyin FC in Jamshedpur on Monday.With just eight points from six matches, the team from the South hasn’t had a great start to the tournament and is coming into the match after a loss against Punjab FC. Owen Coyle, who had led Jamshedpur to their Shield triumph, will thus be hoping to get Chennaiyin’s season back on track and get the better of a team who will surely be hurting from their big away loss.JFC coach Khalid Jamil though believes that his team will be able to make a strong comeback in front of their home fans at the Furnace.“It’s true that we suffered a tough loss, but we are determined to improve and stage a strong comeback. Losses like these are hard, but they’re also opportunities to learn and grow. We’re working hard to turn things around,” Jamil said during a press conference on Sunday.However, the home team will have to take the field without their mercurial defender Stephen Eze after he was given a red card during the last game. How the team copes with his absence against a team that has the likes of Wilmar Jordan Gil, who has netted in three straight matches, and former JFC player Daniel Chima Chukwu will indeed be interesting to see.As far as Jamshedpur’s attacking is concerned, they will be relying on the likes of Jordan Murray and Javier Siverio. They will once again be supported by Javi Hernández, Rei Tachikawa, Mohammed Sanan and Imran Khan. Barring the poor show in their last game, JFC have done quite well going forward and have scored 10 goals in six matches.And they will have to fire in unison on Monday if they are to bag their fifth win of the season and put the humiliating loss behind them. “Each player knows their responsibility, and we are united in our commitment to learn from the past and work as a team to deliver a better result,” Jamil added.Hopefully they will be able to do that because Coyle, despite all his admiration of Jamil and JFC, is eyeing nothing but all the three points on offer.“Khalid is an excellent coach. He has shown it at a number of clubs. Jamshedpur FC have given him an opportunity that he has grabbed with both hands. For the duration of the game, we will be doing everything to win,” Coyle said.",Jamshedpur FC were humbled in their last game when they were thrashed 0-5 by Northeast United FC in Guwahati last Saturday.

A win over Elena Rybakina in the final group match on Wednesday or a loss from her rival, Poland's Iga Swiatek, would seal the year-end top spot for the Belarusian.Sabalenka's win combined with Chinese Zheng Qinwen 's earlier 7-6(4) 3-6 6-1 victory over Rybakina ensured the top seed will finish first in her group regardless of her final result on Wednesday, making her the first player to reach the final four.Australian Open and U.S. Open champion Sabalenka also won her opening match in Riyadh against seventh seed Zheng. The Chinese player and Paolini, with 1-1 records, both remain in contention for the semis and meet on Wednesday.Swiatek is the only player who can overtake Sabalenka.

Four years ago he lost the 2020 Paris Masters championship match to Daniil Medvedev.His victory in Saturday's semi-final meant the current world number three will overtake Spain's Alcaraz in the new updated rankings.The German will next play the ATP Finals in Turin from November 10-17, where he will seek to emulate his past successes in 2018 and 2021 at the Tour's season-ending showpiece.And Zverev will head into the event as the player with the most wins this year as Sunday's victory in the French capital was his 66th in 2024, taking him one ahead of world number one Jannik Sinner.For 26-year-old Humbert it was a chastening experience at the end of a week that will live long in his memory as he reached his career-first Masters final on home soil.The world number 18 stunned four-time Grand Slam winner Alcaraz in the last 16 as he delighted the vocal home crowds on his way to becoming the first French finalist at the indoor event in 13 years.If Humbert had any nerves at the start of his first 1000-level title match, he did not show them as he held serve in the opening game with a sublime forehand passing shot at full stretch.But the sheer power of the German soon wore him down as Zverev forced a break point in the third game, which he converted as Humbert netted.A second consecutive break for Zverev handed him a 4-1 lead and with that the first set.Zverev was firmly in control of the match, making just four unforced errors to his opponent's 17 in the opener.And as if to compound this, Humbert started the second set with a double fault as Zverev immediately moved into a 1-0 lead.Zverev continued to grind his opponent down with his big serve and punishing groundstrokes, despite the efforts of the partisan crowd to boost Humbert.But the Frenchman could make no headway on the German's service games, winning only four points on return in the second set, and did not manage to hold one of his own until the fifth game.Zverev then served out to claim his second Masters trophy of the season, after victory on the clay of Rome in May.",Alexander Zverev beats Ugo Humbert in straight sets to win Paris Masters.

Sabalenka aims to secure her ranking by winning three round-robin matches or reaching the final. Swiatek must defend her WTA Finals title to surpass Sabalenka.Sabalenka said,""Yeah, that's definitely one of the goals,"" said Sabalenka.""I've always been saying that for me it's about finishing the year as the world number one. I'll do everything I can to finish the year as world number one.""... Anytime we come to the tournament, we want to win. That's the first goal. I'm trying to be focused on the first part. Then, if I'll be able to finish the year as number one, it'll be amazing and I'll be super happy.""Swiatek remarked, ""Obviously we're both fighting for this spot. It's been us basically, over the past few years,"" Swiatek said.""I'm in the tournament. I want to play my best and win. I'm going to focus on my first match and do everything step by step.""She's a great player. She also deserves to be number one. For sure, I'm going to fight for me to be in that place.""Sabalenka holds a 1,046-point lead over Swiatek, who has not played since her US Open exit in September. Swiatek has since hired a new coach, Wim Fissette, ahead of the tournament.Other participants include Zheng Qinwen , Jasmine Paolini, Jessica Pegula, Coco Gauff , Elena Rybakina , and Barbora Krejcikova.Elena Rybakina, dealing with health issues, also aims to make a strong comeback, and Zheng Qinwen, in good form, will face Sabalenka early in the tournament.Zheng commented, ""The trickiest part for me right now is how to really find a way to break through the wall and beat her.""The WTA Finals have sparked significant controversy in recent months following Riyadh's selection as the host city through 2026.In recent years, Saudi Arabia has made substantial investments in various sports, including football, Formula One, and golf. Critics argue that the nation is employing its Public Investment Fund to ""sportswash"" its human rights record.The Saudi government refutes these claims of human rights violations, asserting that its laws are designed to safeguard national security.WTA chief Steve Simon acknowledged last year that hosting women's tour events in Saudi Arabia posed ""big issues,"" yet he also recognized the progress the country has made and emphasised ongoing discussions with players prior to finalising the WTA Finals agreement.""Our decision was made with full consultation with our players and our tournaments,"" WTA CEO Portia Archer said. ""That led to the decision to come here and being comfortable with it.""... We think it'll support women in tennis and enable some very positive things to come out of us being here that will last well beyond the eight days we're here this year and successively the next two years when we host the tournament here.""Additionally, tennis legends Chris Evert and Martina Navratilova have voiced concerns, stating that the WTA's values diverge from those of Saudi Arabia.Gauff believes bringing the WTA Finals to Saudi Arabia can ""open doors"" and inspire positive change for women in the country, although the world number three admitted: ""I'd be lying to you if I said I had no reservations"".Gauff, 20, admits she had reservations about the idea of staging the WTA Finals in Saudi Arabia and wanted to see for herself what kind of progress is being made.""Obviously I'm very aware of the situation here in Saudi. My view on it is I do think that sport can have a way to open doors to people. I think in order to want change, you have to see it. I think sports for me, I would say is the easiest way to introduce that,"" said the American star.""I would be lying to you if I said I had no reservations. I was pretty much on every player call I could make with the WTA. One of the things I said, if we come here, we can't just come here and play our tournament and leave. We have to have a real program or real plan in place.""Gauff said the calls included conversations with Princess Reema bint Bandar Al Saud, the Saudi Arabian ambassador to the United States, in which Gauff asked questions about LGBTQ+ and women's rights in the country.""In the long run I think it could be better for everybody,"" said the American.""It's one of those things where I want to see it for myself, see if the change is happening. If I felt uncomfortable or felt like nothing's happening, then I probably wouldn't come back.""The WTA Finals, featuring the top eight singles players and doubles teams, begins in Riyadh and will conclude on November 9.For the first time, the WTA Finals will be contested in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia at King Saud University Indoor Arena.

'One of the best'

Alexander Zverev beat fierce rival Stefanos Tsitsipas in the quarter-finals of the Paris Masters on Friday, while Holger Rune edged Alex de Minaur to keep alive his hopes of reaching the ATP Tour Finals .Zverev's 7-5, 6-4 win over Tsitsipas kept him in the running to claim his first title in Paris after losing to Daniil Medvedev in the 2020 championship match.World number three Zverev -- the highest-ranked player left in the draw -- will face 2022 champion Rune in Saturday's semi-final after the Dane overcame De Minaur 6-4, 4-6, 7-5.The 16th meeting between the 27-year-old German and 26-year-old Greek was evenly matched during a hard-fought first set.""At the beginning, he was outplaying me but then I found my rhythm from the baseline,"" said Zverev on court.""And when I had my chance I used it in the first set.""Indeed once Zverev broke late in the opener and early in the second, it became a comfortable ride to just his sixth win against his long-time Greek rival.The loss ends the chances of the world number 11 Tsitsipas of reaching the end-of-year ATP Finals -- having won the showpiece event in 2019.Tsitsipas and Zverev started cautiously with both offering up opportunities for early breaks in their first service games.But they soon found their range as the first set looked destined to require a tie-break to separate the pair on the quick surface at Paris' Bercy Arena.However, the first break points of the match eventually came with Tsitsipas serving at 5-5, the German claiming the second on a double fault.The Greek saved two set points and secured a break-back point of his own but Zverev dug in to hold.Tsitsipas' shoulders visibly sagged as he offered up break point after break point at 1-1 in the second set.When he dragged a shot long to end a game which had lasted over 15 minutes, his opponent had firmly taken the ascendancy.Zverev, who reached the French Open final in Paris this year, served out to win and move towards a second ATP 1000-level trophy of the season.Former world number four Rune, the 13th seed, needed just one break of serve as he took the opener against De Minaur.In the second set, the 25-year-old Australian started to open up on his groundstrokes, producing several stunning winners off both wings.Rune finally relented when serving at 4-5, offering up three set points to De Minaur who duly converted the second with aplomb.The Australian's first serve gradually deserted him in the decider and Rune capitalised by breaking in the fifth game, but De Minaur struck immediately back to level.A huge net cord that clipped the line on the right side of the court for Rune gave him a 15-0 lead and he took full advantage, breaking to lead 6-5 before consolidating to win the match.""Sascha (Zverev) and I had a great match in Paris, where he took it in five. I beat him one time, he took me last time,"" Rune said of facing Zverev who came out on top when the pair met in a five-set clash in the last 16 of the French Open this year.""He is one of the best players this year, so I will have to be very well prepared.""With the result, both Rune and De Minaur still have a chance of reaching the Tour Finals in Turin, which run November 10-17.Frenchman Ugo Humbert , who downed world number two Carlos Alcaraz in the last 16, delighted the vocal home crowd by beating unseeded Australian Jordan Thompson 6-2, 7-6 (7/4).The world number 18 will face Russian Karen Khachanov in the other semi-final as he attempts to reach a first Masters final of his career and emulate Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in becoming the first French winner in Paris since 2008.Khachanov, the 2018 Paris Masters champion, defeated last year's runner-up Grigor Dimitrov 6-2, 6-3, ending the 33-year-old Bulgarian's hopes of reaching Turin in the process.","Alexander Zverev beats Stefanos Tsitsipas 7-5, 6-4 in Paris Masters quarter- final.

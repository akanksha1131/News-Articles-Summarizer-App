Champions Trophy: Jay Shah objects PCB's Champions Trophy plans in Pakistan Occupied Kashmir cities

NEW DELHI: The Test series defeat to New Zealand on home soil has prompted the Indian cricket board ( BCCI ) to make efforts to revive the robust 'A' programme to groom bench strength for the top tier Indian team.National Cricket Academy (NCA) head VVS Laxman is working on a plan to create a player resource pool, TOI has learnt. The 'A' programme was a very dynamic initiative under previous NCA head Rahul Dravid , who used to tour with developmental teams round the year.The 'A' programme suffered after the Covid-19 lockdown because boards of other countries refused to bear the expense of hosting India's U-19 and 'A' teams, a BCCI source said.""Other boards have communicated to the BCCI that they can't bear the expenses of an 'A' tour. The BCCI has still tried to organize a couple of shadow 'A' tours like the one which precedes India's Test tour of Australia. Laxman is working on it to come up with a plan that will offer greater exposure to the next generation of cricketers,"" a source said.""Other boards are reluctant to host these 'A' series, which don't generate any revenue for them. The expenses must be borne by the local board. What needs to be worked out is a way to make these tours affordable.""Earlier this year, there was an 'A' series against England Lions just ahead of England's tour of India. That series offered the selectors a good perspective on where the players stand. The board also needs to see that Emerging tournaments and other series where two India teams are on separate tours don't coincide with the Ranji Trophy . Almost 60 players are busy on such assignments this season and that hampers the quality of Ranji,"" the source said.The impact of the 'A' programme was on view during the last tour of Australia as the likes of Mohammed Siraj , Shardul Thakur, Navdeep Saini and Washington Sundar stepped up in the absence of seniors.",NCA head VVS Laxman is working on a plan to create a player resource pool.

KOLKATA: Much will depend on Mohammed Shami as the Bengal and Madhya Pradesh Elite Group ‘C’ Ranji Trophy match is set for a thrilling finish. Chasing 338 for victory, the hosts are placed well at 150 for three at stumps on the penultimate day of the match at the Holkar Stadium in Indore on Friday.Shami, who picked up one wicket later on in the day, actually made MP’s job a bit difficult with his bat in the morning. The pacer, who came in to bat when Bengal were 219/8, used his long handle well to stitch together a 39-run last-wicket stand with his brother Mohammed Kaif to take Bengal’s second innings total to 276.After a brief 18-run ninth-wicket stand with SS Jaiswal, Shami decided to break free. He hit two fours and lifted Kartikeya Singh and Kulwant Khejroliya for a six each over the long-on before being dismissed for 37 that came off just 36 deliveries.It was good to see him coming back to bowl 11 overs in the next two sessions of play.

NEW DELHI: Australian Test opener Usman Khawaja emphasizes the depth of India's bowling attack ahead of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy , stating it's not just about Jasprit Bumrah While acknowledging Bumrah's impressive track record, Khawaja highlights the skills of Mohammed Siraj and Mohammed Shami “Everyone talks about Jasprit, but they actually have a lot of other good bowlers. I think [Mohammed] Siraj is a very good bowler. He's a very good bowler to both right-handers and left-handers. When [Mohammed] Shami was fit, when he was playing those series, he was a very good bowler. He was very underrated. No one really talked about him. And then they got good spinners lining up, too, which really complements their fast bowlers,"" Khawaja told Fox Cricket.""So for me it's never ... I'm just not thinking about Jasprit Bumrah. You want to ask me where do you think... I'm not thinking about where he is getting me out. I'm thinking about where am I scoring runs against him.

NEW DELHI: November 15 holds a special place in Indian cricket, celebrating milestones from two of the country’s greatest batters: Sachin Tendulkar and Virat Kohli . This date marks not only the beginning of Tendulkar’s legendary career but also a record-breaking achievement by Kohli, symbolizing the generational shift in Indian cricket excellence.On November 15, 1989, a 16-year-old Sachin Tendulkar debuted for India in a Test match against Pakistan in Karachi.Facing a formidable bowling attack that included another debutant Waqar Younis, Tendulkar displayed remarkable resilience under pressure. Despite being hit on the nose by a bouncer, he showed grit and determination, scoring 15 runs off 24 balls, including two boundaries.This was the beginning of an iconic 24-year career in which Tendulkar would redefine cricketing records, amassing 15,921 Test runs and achieving a historic 100 international centuries — a feat unparalleled in the sport.Exactly 34 years later, on November 15, 2023, Kohli surpassed Tendulkar’s record for most ODI centuries by scoring his 50th ton during the World Cup semi-final against New Zealand in Mumbai.Playing in the World Cup semi-final against New Zealand at the iconic Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai, Kohli scored his 50th ODI century, cementing his status as one of the modern era’s greatest players.His century came with a two off Lockie Ferguson, as he reached the mark in 106 balls, striking eight fours and a six.This achievement not only showcased Kohli's skill and determination but also honored the legacy of his idol, Tendulkar, setting a new benchmark in ODI cricket.Together, these milestones on November 15 underscore the impact of Tendulkar and Kohli on Indian cricket, celebrating a shared legacy of excellence across generations.","Virat Kohli scored his 50th ODI century on November 15, 2023.

#LIVE: India preparations in Perth | 1st Test vs Australia | 1 Week To Go For #BGT | #BTB

NEW DELHI: Virat Kohli will be in the spotlight as India prepare to face Australia in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy , starting on November 22 in Perth. All eyes will be on the star batter as he aims to overcome recent struggles and make history on Australian soil.Despite a recent dip in form, Kohli has a strong track record in Australia, making it an ideal setting for him to rediscover his peak performance and leave a lasting legacy.Kohli is on the verge of achieving several significant milestones during this series.* One of the most notable milestones within Kohli's reach is surpassing Sachin Tendulkar 's record of 1,809 Test runs in Australia. Kohli currently sits at 1,352 runs in 13 Tests at an average of 54.08, needing 458 more runs to claim the top spot for an Indian batter.* Kohli is also closing in on the record for most Test centuries by a visiting player in Australia. He currently holds six centuries, putting him within striking distance of surpassing English legends Jack Hobbs (nine centuries) and Wally Hammond (seven centuries).* The Adelaide Oval holds a special place in Kohli's heart, as it's his most successful Australian venue. He has amassed 509 runs in four Tests there, averaging an impressive 63.62. With 102 more runs, he can surpass Brian Lara 's tally of 610 runs and become the highest-scoring visiting batter at this iconic ground.* Beyond Test cricket, Kohli is also in contention to top the list for most fifty-plus scores in international cricket by a visiting batter in Australia. He currently boasts an impressive 30 fifty-plus scores across all formats (11 centuries, 19 fifties), putting him in the running alongside legends Viv Richards (42) and Desmond Haynes (34).* Kohli's consistent performance in Australia extends to overall international runs. He has accumulated 3,426 runs across all formats, putting him 126 runs ahead of Sachin Tendulkar's record of 3,300 runs. He's also aiming to become the first Indian to reach 4,000 international runs on Australian soil, requiring 574 more runs to achieve this milestone.* The Adelaide Oval has been particularly kind to Kohli, as he's already notched five centuries at the venue. Scoring another century there wouldn't just make him the first visiting player to reach 1,000 runs at the venue, but also surpass Jack Hobbs' record of five centuries at the MCG.* This series will mark Kohli's 100th international match against Australia, likely during the third Test at The Gabba. This achievement would make him the second Indian to reach this milestone, joining the ranks of Sachin Tendulkar who has played 110 matches against the Aussies.* Kohli's current tally of 16 centuries against Australia puts him in a strong position to chase down Sachin Tendulkar's record of 20 international centuries against the Aussies.Having faced a challenging year with the bat, scoring just 488 runs in 19 matches across formats at an average of 20.33, Kohli will be eager to use this series as a platform for redemption. Australia has historically been a happy hunting ground for him, and his performance in this series holds the potential to shape not only the outcome of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy but also cement his legacy in Test cricket.The series begins on November 22 in Perth, followed by matches in Adelaide, The Gabba, and the Boxing Day Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.

PANAJI: At lunch break, when Goa's Snehal Kauthankar and Kashyap Bakle trooped into the dressing room after putting on 577 runs for the third wicket against Arunachal, the two were told they were just 18 runs short of the highest-ever partnership in Ranji Trophy history.Kauthankar had struck a triple century, while Kashyap, playing only his second Ranji game, was unbeaten on 280.On resumption, the duo went past Maharashtra's Swapnil Gugale and Ankit Bawne's record 594. The Academy ground in Porvorim erupted in joy. The two had stitched a 606-run partnership, with Kashyap too reaching a triple ton, when Goa captain Darshan Misal declared. Only later did Misal realise that the duo was just 19 runs short of a first class world record.""We came to know about the world record after declaring our innings,"" Kauthankar told TOI. ""Nobody was aware, else we would have surely gone for that record (as well).""The highest partnership in first-class cricket is the 624 runs scored by Sri Lankan pair of Kumar Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardene during a Test match against South Africa at home in 2006.""We don't have any regrets of not getting the world record. We are extremely proud of our performance. More importantly, we are now going to the Elite group,"" said the experienced Goa batter, who scored 250 in the previous game against Mizoram.Goa are playing in the Plate group, comprising six of the lowest-ranked teams. Until last season, Goa were in the Elite category but were relegated after finishing at the bottom of the pool. This season, they topped the group and qualified, winning all their five matches. In contrast, Arunachal Pradesh lost all five games, the one in Goa in less than two days.After bowling out Arunachal for 84 in their first innings, Goa declared their innings at 727-2, with Kauthankar (314* off 215 balls) and Bakle (300* off 269 balls) putting on a record partnership for the third wicket. Arunachal's second innings ended at 92 in 22.3 overs, giving Goa a win by an innings and 551 runs, a Ranji record.Goa's 727-2 was their highest score in the premier domestic cricket tournament, but it was well short of the record in Ranji Trophy. That belongs to Tamil Nadu who declared their innings at a massive 912-6, incidentally against Goa in Panaji in 1989.In that game, Tamil Nadu's WV Raman and Arjun Kripal Singh had scored 313 and 302 runs, the first instance of two batters getting triple centuries.Arunachal 84 (Nabam Tagan Abo 25, Neelam Obi 22; Arjun Tendulkar 5-25, Mohit Redkar 3-15) & 92 (Nabam 31) Lakshay Garg 4-43, Deepraj Gaonkar 2-15, Keith 2-25) lost to Goa 727-2 (Snehal Kauthankar 314*, Kashyap Bakle 300*, Suyash Prabhudessai 73).",Goa's Snehal Kauthankar and Kashyap Bakhale put on the highest-ever partnership in Ranji Trophy history.

ICC cancels key event for Champions Trophy amid scheduling dispute over India matches | Highlights

India's refusal to play the next year's Champions Trophy in Pakistan has led to a stand-off between the two estranged neighbours, leaving the International Cricket Council ( ICC ) in a soup over the return of one of its premier events after a gap of seven years.The Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ) have informed the ICC that it won't travel to Pakistan to play the Champions Trophy, after which the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has reportedly written to the sport's apex body to explain the reasons behind India's refusal.Reports also suggest that the PCB has rejected the option of a hybrid model, which will allow India to play all their matches at a neutral venue.Sharing his two cents on the issue, former PCB chairman Najam Sethi has advised the Pakistan board to think wisely and not take any decisions based on the country's emotions.""I will tell you one thing. ICC will always side with India. Remember this,"" said Sethi talking to 'Samaa TV'. ""Now, if they move the tournament to Sri Lanka or Dubai, and Pakistan doesn't participate, then it will cost the ICC and also India & Pakistan because the ICC revenues are distributed in a portion. Major portion goes to India and the fourth portion goes to Pakistan.""It doesn't bother India much. They (BCCI) are very rich. But it matters a lot for Pakistan if their revenues drop. That will be another issue for Pakistan.""Sethi was the PCB chairman when the last year's Asia Cup, with Pakistan as the designated hosts, was turned into a hybrid model after India's refusal to visit. India played all their matches in Sri Lanka, while the rest of the tournament was hosted in Pakistan.""Will they (PCB) take this issue to a logical end? And what is a logical end to this?"" Sehti continued.""It means if you have rejected a hybrid model after India refused to come and also rejected playing in another country, then you won't play in the future ICC events also. So you are basically going to push yourself out of the ICC. And if you do that, then what will remain besides bilateral cricket? You don't make much money in bilateral cricket because it is reciprocal,"" he added.""So the thing is that then Pakistan will find it difficult. Whoever is making these decisions, they should think what is its logic? India knows its logic behind the boycott, they can sustain it. They have done it before...ICC will then be compelled. But what will Pakistan do?...So my advice is that whoever is making the decisions should think wisely and not emotionally.""Sethi also hinted that the stand-off could be a diplomatic tactic.""If they (PCB) understand that this is a diplomatic negotiation tactic, that they won't play if the tournament is taken somewhere else and then you make a u-turn and agree to play based on conditions that you get to host, say, 8-10 matches instead of 4-6. Is it (such) a tactic? I don't know.""The tournament is scheduled to be played from February 19 to March 9, 2025; and the PCB has offered to host all India's matches in Lahore so that they can come, play and return home the same day via the closest border, Attari, separating the two countries, near Amritsar.",ICC cancels key event for Champions Trophy amid scheduling dispute over India matches.

Champions Trophy: Jay Shah objects PCB's Champions Trophy plans in Pakistan Occupied Kashmir cities

MUMBAI: The controversy surrounding the 2025 ICC Champions Trophy , last held in 2017, continues to escalate with no tournament schedule — originally set to begin on Feb 19 and conclude on March 8 — in sight.On Friday, BCCI secretary Jay Shah raised strong objections with the International Cricket Council (ICC) over the Pakistan Cricket Board's ( PCB ) plans to promote the Champions Trophy by conducting a trophy tour across regions in PakistanOccupied Kashmir (PoK).A day after the PCB announced the tour on social media, the BCCI secretary raised the matter with the global cricket body. ""Jay Shah has objected to that tweet (post) and has criticised and condemned PCB's plan to take the trophy to PoK cities.""He has urged the ICC to take strong action in this regard. The PCB has no business sharing the schedule because it has to come from ICC. Things need to be done via appropriate channels,” said a source close to the development.Another source said, ""There is no question of approving or rejecting anything at this stage. Discussions on the final plan for the Trophy Tour are ongoing. As always, the confirmed schedule will be announced through ICC channels.""Normally, a trophy tour is a part of the global body's promotional exercise with multiple city visits as per an arrangement with the host country.On Thursday, the PCB announced the plan on social media, mentioning stops in Skardu, Hunza and Muzaffarabad — territories in PoK. ""Get ready, Pakistan! The ICC Champions Trophy 2025 trophy tour kicks off in Islamabad on 16 Nov, also visiting scenic travel destinations like Skardu, Murree, Hunza and Muzaffarabad.

While the ICC was expected to release the tournament schedule on Nov 11, the announcement has reportedly been postponed to Nov 22.Meanwhile, the PCB has rejected the proposed ‘hybrid model', which would see India playing their matches in Dubai.

NEW DELHI: India dished out an all-round performance to inflict a massive 135-run defeat on South Africa in the fourth and final T20I in Johannesburg on Friday. With this victory, India clinched the four-match series 3-1.Chasing a mammoth 284-run target, South Africa were rattled by pacer Arshdeep Singh 's brilliance as he swung the ball both ways. He dismissed Reeza Hendricks in the first over and then quickly followed up with the wickets of Aiden Markram and Heinrich Klaasen His astonishing effort helped India reduce the hosts to a disastrous 10/4 within just 3 overs, effectively ending the contest early.South Africa's only focus now was to save face, with David Miller and Tristan Stubbs leading the fightback. The pair put on 86 runs before Varun Chakravarthy struck, dismissing Miller.Stubbs fell off the very next ball to Ravi Bishnoi, and India wrapped up the innings, bowling South Africa out in the 19th over. Marco Jansen showed his all-round abilities with a few big hits, but it was too little, too late.Earlier, Sanju Samson 's precision andTilak Varma 's muscular elegance combined as India effortlessly dismantled the South African bowling attack to post a commanding 283/1.This total not only marked India's highest-ever T20I score overseas but also became the highest by any team on South African soil.Among the numerous records shattered, the standout achievement was the rare feat of two Indian batters scoring centuries in the same T20I innings. Samson and Varma also set the record for India’s highest-ever partnership in T20Is—210 runs off just 93 balls for the second wicket.Samson (109* off 56 balls), who had already struck a brilliant century in the first game, once again put the Proteas to the sword alongside Varma (120* off 47 balls), who has been in sensational form at number three, brimming with confidence and vigour.Samson now has three T20I centuries in his last five innings, including two ducks, while Varma has scored back-to-back centuries.Samson reached his century in 51 balls, while Varma took just 41 balls to bring up his ton—10 balls fewer than his partner.Abhishek Sharma (36 off 18 balls) also deserves credit for setting the tone in the Powerplay with four huge sixes.On a flat track offering true bounce, the Indian batsmen were in full flow, hammering a record 23 sixes.

Choosing 22 players from 580 in a space of a few days was the biggest challenge, says coach Nallappan Mohanraj

CHENNAI: The men’s football scene in Tamil Nadu has been far from ideal in the last six years. With the non-conduct of the CFA leagues since 2018 due to the long-standing dispute between the Tamil Nadu Football Association (TFA) and Chennai Football Association (CFA) – they were hosted without recognition in 2022 – the local players have been struggling for game time.In a bid to sustain their careers and make a living out of the sport, many TN footballers have been forced to ply their trade in other state leagues. The grim situation has severely impacted TN’s performances in the Santosh Trophy (National Championship), where the state team has been a mere participant in the last few years.Not much has changed in TN football in recent times, but newly-appointed head coach Nallappan Mohanraj is optimistic about restoring pride in the upcoming Santosh Trophy. TN have been pitted alongside Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Andhra Pradesh and 2022-23 champs Karnataka in Group G and will play their pool matches in Anantapur from Friday to Tuesday. As only one team will qualify from the group for the final round, the competition is going to be tough.""I played in the Santosh Trophy as a youngster and captained the team as well. Being with TN in my first assignment as a head coach is something memorable. I love being put in tough situations; staying comfortable makes me uncomfortable. I have always wanted to do something good while being put in a tough situation,"" Mohanraj, a former India defender, told TOI.""I had to assess about 580 players in just three days of the trials, so I do not know if they were able to show their full potential in the little time they got. I might have missed out on picking a promising player. I do not know when these players (22 members in the final squad) last played 90 minutes in a match, so I had to decide which aspect I needed to give more importance to – fitness or tactics. It has been a huge challenge, but I have been trying to find solutions,"" said Mohanraj, who had worked with the India U-23 and U-20 teams.Mohanraj can rely on the experience of Ajith Kumar, Lijo Francis, B Sriram, Sinivasan Pandiyan and Alexander Romario Jesuraj, players who have competed in the top-two tiers of Indian football . ""I hardly had 10 days to work with the group. Adding experience while building a team is important; that is why I have opted to have at least one senior player in every area of the pitch. There has to be a good balance between youth and experience,"" added Mohanraj.Despite not having the best of build-ups, the chief coach is focused on the target. ""Our goal is to take TN to the final round. We did not have time to implement my philosophy, so I did not want to complicate our tactics. The boys know what I expect from them. I want them to do the basics right.""","Choosing 22 players from 580 in a space of a few days was the biggest challenge, says coach Nallappan Mohanraj.

KOLKATA: On Oct. 13, when Bengal was preparing to bid farewell to Maa Durga, Sanjoy Sen began his new journey.A total of 78 players assembled at the Salt Lake Stadium. And so commenced the selection trial for Bengal’s Santosh Trophy squad under the watchful eyes of coach Sen. Over the past few days, they were made to go through the grind and play four practice matches, including the one against I-League team Inter Kashi, before Sen picked his final 22 for the tournament.""When I watch a game — be it a match from ISL or I-League or any other tournament — I have this habit of taking note of the performance of any good player and keeping their names in my notebook. This has been my longtime practice. And this has helped me settle down on my final squad for Santosh Trophy also,"" Sen told TOI on Thursday.""Besides, I've collected data of some players from people and coaches who have been directly involved in teams playing in the CFL. They have also helped me pick my players. Robi Hansda, Israfil Dewan, Ayon Mondal and Aritra Ghosh — they all have proved their worth in the CFL. Overall, in my opinion they are the best of the lot.

The two other teams of the group — Bihar and Uttar Pradesh — will also square off on the same day.The most successful team in the Santosh Trophy history with 32 titles, Bengal have not won it since the 2016-17 season. It was the time when Sen had been scaling new heights in Indian club football, having guided Mohun Bagan to their maiden I-League title and a Federation Cup to boot.""I'm not an expert in assessing why we have fallen behind in Indian football. I'm not a person who wants to live in the past. Maybe, at that time players from Mohun Bagan, East Bengal and Mohammedan SC used to play for Bengal. From Latifuddin to Md Akbar and Xavier Pias they all played for Bengal in the Santosh Trophy and helped Bengali players grow as a whole. Now these three teams no longer allow their players to take part in the tournament. So, the present can't be judged in the light of what has happened in the past,"" said Sen, who has also managed Mohammedan Sporting and United SC in the I-League and served now defunct ATK as its head of youth development.""Moreover, when we used to rule Indian football, the game was limited to Bengal, Kerala, Goa, Punjab and Services. Now, 38 teams are playing in the Santosh Trophy this year. The game has expanded and it offers a more level-playing field,"" he remarked.A daily routine chart for the players hangs up on the wall of the dining room. Each morning it is shared with them on the specially-opened WhatsApp group. ""They must know what I want from them. Following everything in a disciplined way is a must in my scheme of things,"" he put it.Sen would also often sit with them, dissecting their performances in the practice match against Inter Kashi. Mohun Bagan SG's ISL Shield-winning coach Antonio Lopez Habas, now serving the Varanasi-based team as a technical director, spoke highly of Sen's brigade after the match which Kashi won 2-0.Working a little away from the media glare and with the challenge of helping Bengal return to their days lost glory in Santosh Trophy for the first time in his 27-year-old coaching career, does he have a point to prove? Is there any self-motivating factor?""In our time, representing Bengal was itself an honour. But the players now know that unless they become champions or runners-up, they will not be noticed. This is their motivation and they are hungry to reach that stage. It's a collective mission. I'm here as a catalyst, helping my players fuel that dream,"" Sen pointed out, his stiff jaw betraying a sense of determination.And any personal objective?""My dream? I've not thought about this, honestly speaking. I've trained the Indian junior team. And just like Manolo Marquez, I too applied for the Indian senior coach's job. If there's any dream, maybe it's there... If it doesn't happen, well, it will leave me with no regrets.""Sen signed off, got up and with a whistle in his mouth, began his training session with the players at the Kalyani stadium.","Bengal begin their group-stage campaign with a game against Jharkhand on Saturday.

NEW DELHI: The Nations League match between France and Israel at the Stade de France on Thursday was overshadowed by tensions surrounding the ongoing conflict in Gaza.Despite the deployment of 4,000 security personnel, there were instances of booing during the Israeli national anthem and minor scuffles inside the stadium.The attendance of 16,611 was the lowest for the French national team at the Stade de France since its opening in 1998, with many fans opting to stay away due to security concerns.The sparse crowd was a reflection of the frictions surrounding the match, which took place against the backdrop of the Gaza war.While some Israeli fans defied their government's warning against travelling for sports events, anti-Israeli demonstrators gathered outside the stadium, waving Palestinian flags and protesting against the match.The protesters carried banners condemning the Gaza offensive, with one reading, ""We don't play with genocide.""Despite the tensions, the match proceeded without major incidents, ending in a goalless draw.Watch:French President Emmanuel Macron attended the game as a show of solidarity, emphasizing the need to combat anti-Semitism and violence.""We will not give into anti-Semitism anywhere and violence, including in France, will never prevail, nor will intimidation,"" he told France's BFM TV ahead of kickoff.The match highlighted the broader societal issues surrounding the Gaza conflict, with racism and intolerance on the rise in France and other parts of Europe.The clashes between Maccabi Tel Aviv fans and local groups in Amsterdam the previous week further underscored the potential for tensions to spill over into the sporting arena.While the match itself was a symbolic gesture of normalcy, the surrounding events and low attendance reflected the complex dynamics at play, with the Gaza conflict casting a long shadow over the sporting encounter.","The Nations League match between France and Israel at the Stade de France on Thursday was overshadowed by tensions.

(AP)

There will be a heavy police presence but few visiting fans when France hosts Israel in UEFA Nations League match on Thursday amid an increasingly tense political climate.French police chief Laurent Nunez said 4,000 police officers and security staff will be deployed around the Stade de France , with another 1,500 police on public transport.Paris authorities are on high alert and pursuing extreme measures one week after violence against Israeli fans around a Europa League football game in Amsterdam in attacks widely condemned across Europe as antisemitic.Nunez said the event was at ""high risk"" of tensions. ""What we learned from Amsterdam is that we need to be present in the public space including far away from the stadium,"" and in public transports before and after the match, he said Thursday on French news broadcaster France Info.Three months after hosting the Olympic closing ceremony, the atmosphere has gone from festive to fearful and the national stadium was expected to be three-quarters empty for the match. French President Emmanuel Macron and French Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau will be present. Former presidents Francois Hollande and Nicolas Sarkozy are also to attend.Only 20,000 of 80,000 tickets have been sold with around 150 Israel supporters reportedly attending, escorted by police.""We've tried to prepare for this match as normally as possible. But obviously none of us within the team can be insensitive to such a heavy context,"" France coach Didier Deschamps said Wednesday. ""It impacts the amount of supporters present tomorrow and everything that goes with it.""The away match against Israel on Oct. 10 - which France won 4-1 - was played in Budapest, Hungary.""These are situations the players are not accustomed to,"" Deschamps said. ""But we have to adapt.""The low number of visiting fans comes after Israel's National Security Council warned citizens abroad to avoid sports and cultural events, specifically the match in Paris.Retailleau told French news channel TF1 on Tuesday that no specific threats were identified but ""zero risk does not exist.""Therefore, he said, exceptional measures are in place ""before the match, during the match and after the match.""The elite tactical unit of the French National Police, known as RAID, will be in the stadium and some police will be in plain clothes mingling with fans. There will also be heavy surveillance within Paris, including at Jewish places of worship and schools.""It is out of the question that we take the risk of seeing a repeat of the dramatic events, of the manhunt, that we saw in Amsterdam,"" Retailleau said, adding that postponing or moving the game elsewhere was ruled out.""France does not retreat,"" he said. ""France does not submit, and the France-Israel match will take place where it's supposed to.""Amsterdam witnessed scenes of chaos when Israeli fans were attacked by hordes of young people apparently riled up by calls on social media to target Jewish people, according to Dutch authorities. Before the game, a large group of supporters of the Israeli team could be seen on video chanting anti-Arab slogans as they headed to the stadium, escorted by police.Protests erupted in Paris on Wednesday night against a controversial gala organised by far-right figures in support of Israel.The game in Saint-Denis, the suburb north of Paris, is scheduled to kick off at 8:45 p.m. local time (1945 GMT) on Thursday.A pro-Palestinian demonstration is organized on a Saint-Denis plaza at 6 p.m. local time to protest against the match.Nine years ago, Stade de France was one of several locations during the Nov. 13 terror attacks in which 130 people died. France was playing Germany that night when two explosions happened outside the stadium.Deschamps, Germany coach Joachim Low and all of the players stayed together in the locker rooms for hours until it was safe to leave.""It's a sad date for us given what happened in 2015,"" Deschamps said.","French police chief Laurent Nunez said 4,000 police officers and security staff will be deployed around the Stade de France.

BENGALURU: Prajnesh Gunneswaran climbed to a career-best No.75 on the ATP Rankings five years ago, in what was his second innings in tennis.The 35-year-old, forced to listen to the rickety tunes of a creaking frame, particularly a troublesome left wrist, bid adieu to the sport on Friday. Gunneswaran made the announcement on social media, some 20-months after he played his last tournament, an ATP Challenger in Pune.The gifted left-hander said, ""I played without being able to up my intensity for a while, managing the injury, but my ranking kept dropping. The more I played, the more sure I became that I didn’t want to do this in-between thing, where I was unable to raise the intensity of my play.""Gunneswaran celebrated his 35th birthday on Tuesday. ""It was not a decision I made overnight,"" he said. ""I always knew that when I decided to go, I didn’t want to leave with regrets. That’s why I took so much time before making the decision.""The Chennai-based pro’s tennis journey has played out in two parts. Gunneswaran was ranked outside the 1500-mark at the age of 26. A series of injuries – recurring stress fracture of both knees – kept him on the sidelines. When relatively pain-free, Gunneswaran decided to get back on the road for a last dance. His father, the late SG Prabhakaran, whose deep pockets allowed his only child to return to the Tour, was his biggest cheerleader. Gunneswaran’s knees held. He played one season, tried another and then another. From 1500-plus in the rankings in the summer of 2015 to a place in the world’s top-75, in April 2019.The India No.1 enjoyed his best season that year. He started by qualifying for the main draw of the Australian Open and went on to play the main draw of the other three majors, besides making the round of 32 in Indian wells, beating the 18th ranked Nikolas Basilashvili enroute, for his best win by way of rankings. His other top-50 triumph came against Denis Shapovalov (ranked 23 at the time).Gunneswaran has no definite plans for the future but is sure he will be involved with tennis. ""All of us who have made it to this level, have had to shift out of the country to train,"" said Gunneswaran.""Every program we’ve had in this country has had some success, from BATT -- Leander Paes and Somdev Devvarman – to the other ventures. We need to do something on a big scale, so that our players do not have to go outside to train,"" he said. ""China and Japan have been doing it for a while. Either we go their way and get the best coaches to India for a period of five-ten years or we use the players we have, put them back in the system to get results.""",Prajnesh Gunneswaran announced his retirement from tennis on Friday.

TURIN: Frances Tiafoe , who reached the semifinals of the US Open, received a substantial fine for his behavior during a match at the Shanghai Masters last month. While he will not be suspended from playing, the consequences of his actions are significant.The ATP , the governing body of men's professional tennis , announced that Tiafoe was fined a total of $120,000 for his outburst.The hefty penalty comprises two parts: the maximum on-site fine of $60,000 for verbal abuse and an additional $60,000 for aggravated behavior.Despite the severity of the fine, the ATP confirmed that Tiafoe would not face suspension and would be eligible to participate in upcoming tournaments.The incident occurred during Tiafoe's third-round match against Roman Safiullin, ranked 61st at the time. After a hard-fought battle, Tiafoe lost the match with a final score of 5-7, 7-5, 7-6 (5).Following the match, Tiafoe engaged in a profanity-laced tirade directed at chair umpire Jimmy Pinoargote, lasting approximately one minute. It was reported that Tiafoe used around ten expletives during this outburst.In the aftermath of the incident, Tiafoe took to social media to express remorse for his actions. He acknowledged that his behavior was unacceptable and apologized for his outburst.“That is not who I am and not how I ever want to treat people. I let my frustration in the heat of the moment get the best of me and I’m extremely disappointed with how I handled the situation.”The primary source of Tiafoe's frustration stemmed from a penalty he received for a time violation during the crucial closing tiebreaker.With the score tied at 5-5, Tiafoe was preparing to serve when the serve clock was about to expire. He tossed the ball in the air at the baseline, but umpire Pinoargote deemed this action insufficient to constitute a genuine attempt to serve.As a result, Tiafoe was penalized with a fault, costing him his first serve. While he initially protested the decision, he continued playing but ultimately lost the point and the subsequent point, leading to his defeat.Despite the heated exchange, Tiafoe displayed sportsmanship by congratulating Safiullin at the net after the match concluded. However, he then turned towards the umpire and began shouting expletives.Tiafoe then moved to the other side of the net, positioning himself closer to his chair, and voiced his discontent, asserting that the umpire's decision had negatively impacted the match's outcome.Tiafoe's impressive run to the US Open semifinals in 2022, where he faced eventual champion Carlos Alcaraz, solidified his status as a rising star in tennis. He replicated this feat in the 2023 tournament, reaching the semifinals before being defeated by fellow American Taylor Fritz in a hard-fought five-set match.","Frances Tiafoe received a substantial fine for his behavior during a match at the Shanghai Masters last month. The ATP confirmed that TiaFoe would not face suspension and would be eligible to participate in upcoming tournaments. The incident occurred during the third-round match against Roman Safiullin, ranked 61st at the time.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115320470,imgsize-46364,width-400,resizemode-4/115320470.jpg"

TURIN (Italy): He's got a stranglehold on the No. 1 ranking. He's unbeaten this week and hasn't dropped a set. And his home Italian fans can't get enough of him.Things couldn't get much better for Jannik Sinner at the ATP Finals so far — despite an ongoing doping case that likely won't be decided until early next year.Sinner and US Open finalist Taylor Fritz advanced to the semifinals on Thursday at the season-ending tournament for the year's top eight players.Sinner won the round-robin group after a 6-3, 6-4 victory over 2020 champion Daniil Medvedev; and Fritz advanced in second after rallying past Alex de Minaur 5-7, 6-4, 6-3.Sinner was already assured of a spot in the last four before his match against Medvedev but still extended his winning streak to nine matches. Sinner beat Fritz in the U.S. Open final in September for his second Grand Slam title.“I hope this match gives me confidence for the semifinals, where I'm hoping to raise the level,"" Sinner said. ""But honestly, I'm happy with the level I'm playing at right now.”Sinner is playing at home for the first time since it was announced before his U.S. Open title that he tested positive in two separate drug tests this year.A decision to clear Sinner of wrongdoing was appealed by the World Anti-Doping Agency in September and a final ruling in the case is expected in 2025.Medvedev, who won one of three matches, and De Minaur, who didn't win any, were eliminated.Last year, Sinner lost the final to Novak Djokovic , who pulled out injured this year.Alexander Zverev leads the other group ahead of Casper Ruud, Carlos Alcaraz and Andrey Rublev.Sinner took the edge in his career meetings with Medvedev at 8-7 — after Medvedev swept their first six matches.“He's in full confidence right now,” Medvedev said. “I watched his practice before the match — barely misses a shot and he hits strong. Many times a lot of players that don't miss a lot, at least they don't hit strong. He can hit strong — very strong, probably one of maybe top three, four, five hitters on tour, and doesn't miss.”Fritz improved to 4-5 in his career against De Minaur and could pull level next week in a quarterfinal matchup between the United States and Australia at the Davis Cup Finals.“I feel like he typically plays better in the team environment. I also feel like I play better in the team environment,"" Fritz said. ""It's still going to be a nightmare to play him next week, too.”","Jannik Sinner and Taylor Fritz advanced to the semifinals of the ATP World Tour Finals. Sinner won the round-robin group after a 6-3, 6-4 victory over 2020 champion Daniil Medvedev. Fritz advanced in second after rallying past Alex de Minaur 5-7,6-4, 6 -3.

(AP)

Taylor Fritz moved closer to the semis of the season-ending ATP Finals after the American beat Alex de Minaur 5-7 6-4 6-3 in their last group game on Thursday, but he will have to wait and see if Jannik Sinner can take a set off Daniil Medvedev .The match also marked the first time a deciding set was played at this year's tournament as Fritz bounced back from a set down with a dominant display in the second before running away with the third set.US Open runner-up Fritz can qualify for the final four if Sinner takes a set in his match against Medvedev. But the American will be eliminated if Medvedev beats Sinner in straight sets.Seventh seed De Minaur, meanwhile, goes home without winning a single match in the Ilie Nastase group on his tournament debut.""He was all over me (in the first set). What I did a great job of was in the second set, towards the end of the second set, I really started to find my serve,"" Fritz said.""I started serving much better and then that allowed me to just stay with it and create more pressure on his service games... It just gave me a little bit of comfort to just stay in the match and not be under so much pressure all the time.""The two played some entertaining tennis in the opening set, including a 30-shot rally which De Minaur won with a passing shot while Fritz walked back to the baseline with a wry smile.De Minaur converted the all-important break at 5-5 and served for the set, sealing it with an ace, which also confirmed world number one Sinner as the first semi-finalist.De Minaur, however, needed to win the second set comfortably to stand a chance of advancing to the semi-finals and the Australian saw his slim hopes of going through evaporate when Fritz levelled the score at one set apiece.That was all the motivation a fired-up Fritz needed as he raced into a 4-1 lead to gain control of the decider while De Minaur crumbled. At 5-3, Fritz had three match points and took the contest with an ace.""I think all of us are pretty beat up, but if I'm in the semis of the World Tour finals, I've got energy to give it for the semis,"" Fritz added.",Taylor Fritz beats Alex de Minaur 5-7 6-4 6-3 at ATP World Tour Finals.

(AP)

There ""could have been better communication"" in explaining the rules involved in Jannik Sinner 's doping case, ATP Tour chairman Andrea Gaudenzi acknowledged Thursday.However, Gaudenzi said at the ATP Finals that anyone hinting that a ""double standard"" was applied because of top-ranked Sinner's status is ""unfair because the rules have been the same.""Sinner is playing at home this week for the first time since it was announced before his U.S. Open title that he tested positive for an anabolic steroid in two separate drug tests in March.The case wasn't made public until August.""I learned the day before we all learned,"" Gaudenzi said in his first public comments on the case. He spoke in a round-table discussion with international reporters.""And to be honest, I'm happy about that. I really thank the ITA (International Testing Agency) and our representatives there for intentionally keeping me and our entire team in the dark because that's how it should be.""It should be completely independent and that was agreed by the (parties). It was a shock, but obviously comforted by the evidence afterward.""A decision by an independent tribunal to clear Sinner of wrongdoing was appealed by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) in September and the Switzerland-based Court of Arbitration for Sport is expected to make a final ruling on the case early next year.Sinner's explanation was that the banned performance-enhancer entered his system unintentionally through a massage from his physiotherapist, who used a spray containing the steroid to treat his own cut finger.WADA is seeking a ban of one to two years for Sinner.""We are completely external and it's (an) independent process,"" Gaudenzi said. ""I generally think has been a fair process. It was really done by the book and by the rules. Maybe there could have been better communication in explaining those rules, and that is something that I would urge every party involved to work better in the next time.""ATP Finals future will be revealed Gaudenzi said he plans to announce on Sunday the future host of the ATP Finals. The contract with Turin expires next year and there is an option to move the event to nearby Milan at a bigger arena being built for the 2026 Milan-Cortina Olympics.""We are all super happy with what's happened here in Turin and of course we've been a bit lucky with the players in Italy,"" Gaudenzi said. ""It's not only Jannik but also Matteo Berrettini played the first edition. Nobody could foresee that.""We knew we were going to a tennis country,"" said Gaudenzi, who is Italian and a former pro player. ""(Finals) should definitely go in a market that loves tennis. ... It's obviously going to get better if you have a local hero, no doubt.""Gaudenzi does not want to move the finals too far away geographically from the previous stop on the circuit, the Paris Masters.""We want to try to avoid the players to fly around the world,"" he said, ""because they do enough traveling all over throughout the year.""","Top-ranked Jannik Sinner is playing at home this week for the first time since he tested positive for an anabolic steroid in March.

How Mohammed Shami’s horoscope foretells India's success in Champions Trophy

Will Rohit Sharma win another ICC trophy? Here's what the horoscope says

NEW DELHI: ICC Champions Trophy 2025 event ambassador and former Pakistan skipper Sarfaraz Ahmed has urged the hosts to maintain a smart and intense approach when they face India on February 23 in Dubai.Sarfaraz, who captained Pakistan to their memorable Champions Trophy triumph in 2017, highlighted the unique pressure and excitement surrounding an India-Pakistan clash.""Whenever we meet, it is a special occasion and there is so much hype and pressure around it,"" he shared in an exclusive column with the ICC. ""But as players, you need to stay calm, try and block that noise out, and just play with the same intensity as you would play Australia or any other team.""He expressed confidence in Pakistan’s ability to defend their title under captain Mohammad Rizwan . ""Pakistan have a really good chance of defending that title and I think they have a strong team. Some of the boys from 2017 are still there and we’re talking about some of the best – especially Babar Azam ""He is a different Babar to the one that played in 2017, a more mature player and a dominant player in the game. His batting will be so important for Pakistan and so will Fakhar Zaman’s.""Sarfaraz also highlighted Pakistan’s bowling strength, citing Shaheen Shah Afridi and Haris Rauf as key players. ""With the ball, Shaheen Shah Afridi and Haris Rauf are brilliant bowlers and are playing well. The captain, Mohammad Rizwan, is also a wicketkeeper-batter, which worked pretty well for me back in 2017!""Unlike in the ICC ODI World Cup or the T20 World Cup, where India have dominated, Pakistan hold a 3-2 edge in their Champions Trophy encounters. Pakistan will begin their campaign against New Zealand on February 18 in Karachi before facing India in a high-stakes match on February 23 in Dubai.",ICC Champions Trophy 2025 event ambassador Sarfaraz Ahmed has urged the hosts to maintain a smart and intense approach when they face India on February 23 in Dubai.

'We don't look at averages and stats': Gautam Gambhir on sending Axar Patel at No. 5

How Mohammed Shami’s horoscope foretells India's success in Champions Trophy

Former England cricketer Kevin Pietersen has taken aim at a 'leading' UK journalist for defending England's lack of practice during their tour of India. Pietersen, who has been vocal about England’s struggles, lashed out on social media after the journalist cited injuries and a tight schedule as reasons for the team's training omissions.""Just got sent an article where a leading UK journo has said that Shastri & I got it wrong last night when discussing England not training. Reason - injuries and quick turnaround between games…!"" Pietersen posted on X.""Do me a f*****g favour! Stop writing about cricket if you’re going to write such rubbish. Injuries are part of sport and this schedule is like every bilateral series almost ever played. Injuries are NOT stopping batters from batting against net bowlers and learning the art of playing spin. And that’s where they should have been to IMPROVE! Trust me on this one as it saved my career against spin!"" Pietersen wrote.He further suggested that the journalist was trying to mislead fans, writing, ""It seems the journos are in cahoots with what we’re trying to be brainwashed into believing! You won’t fool the fan with such!""Pietersen had already expressed his frustration over England’s lack of preparation in India, calling it ""gobsmacking"" that the team did not hold a single practice session after losing the first ODI and the T20I series.England endured a disastrous tour, losing the T20I series 4-1 before being swept 3-0 in the ODIs. Reports suggested that England avoided net sessions due to mounting injuries and a demanding schedule, but Pietersen dismissed these justifications, emphasising the importance of preparation, particularly in the subcontinent.""There isn't a single sportsman on this planet who can honestly say they’d improve without practicing whilst they’re getting beaten,"" he posted. ""There also cannot be one player in that England side that can sit on the plane leaving India and say to themselves, they did everything they could to help England win. And for that, I’m actually incredibly sad this evening. Losing is fine if you're giving your best to improve every day, and if England didn't train during this series then they didn’t try.""During commentary for the third ODI, Pietersen highlighted how England’s approach was reflected in their activities off the field. He noted that Tom Banton , who replaced the injured Jacob Bethell, was seen playing golf a day before the match instead of practicing.""I never played golf when I played cricket. I was in the nets hitting thousands of balls, trying to make improvements here in the sub-continent. Have your days off in England.""England captain Jos Buttler, however, defended the team’s preparation, stating, ""I'm not sure that's quite true, to be honest. We had a reasonably long tour, a few long travel days. There's been a couple of times we've not trained, but we've certainly done plenty of training throughout the tour.""""We obviously try and create a really good environment, but don’t mistake that for a lazy environment or a lack of effort. The guys are desperate to perform and do well and improve,"" Buttler added.Former India coach Ravi Shastri , who was also critical of England’s lack of training, remarked, ""From what I’ve heard, England have had just one net session this entire trip, if not any. If you're not prepared to do the hard yards, you're not going to improve.""With England’s struggles against spin exposed throughout the tour, concerns are mounting ahead of the upcoming ICC Champions Trophy in Pakistan and the UAE. Pietersen’s blunt assessment has ignited a fresh debate about England’s preparation and mindset on overseas tours.",Former England cricketer Kevin Pietersen has taken aim at a 'leading' UK journalist for defending England's lack of practice during their tour of India.

New Zealand head coach Gary Stead has provided an update on the injury concerns of key players Rachin Ravindra and Lockie Ferguson ahead of the ODI tri-series final against Pakistan in Karachi on Friday. The tournament serves as a crucial build-up for the Blackcaps ahead of the ICC Champions Trophy , which begins on February 19 in Pakistan.The two sides will play against each other again in the Champions Trophy opener at the same venue on Wednesday.Ravindra was forced to leave the field after taking a blow to the forehead while attempting a catch during the first ODI of the tri-series. Meanwhile, Ferguson has been recovering from a hamstring injury sustained during the ILT20 in the UAE.Speaking on Ravindra's condition, Stead stated: ""Rachin obviously got that nasty blow in Lahore to the forehead. The pleasing thing is he's progressing well. So, we are following HIA protocols at the moment. He’s had a headache for a few days, but that's subsiding, which is really good news. He hit a few balls tonight for the first time, which is good. But it's still a few more steps for him to go through before he would be considered fit for play.""On Ferguson’s progress, Stead added: ""And Lockie has been out there. He has had a couple of bowls since he has been here, so the intensity was up a little bit more tonight. Pleased with how he's tracking and certainly will look to have him playing in one of the next two games.""Ravindra suffered the injury while fielding in the 38th over of New Zealand’s match against Pakistan. The poor quality of floodlights at the Gaddafi Stadium was blamed for the incident, as he lost sight of the ball while attempting a catch off Michael Bracewell, resulting in the heavy blow to his face.",Rachin Ravindra was forced to leave the field after taking a blow to the forehead while attempting a catch during the first ODI of the tri-series.

India cap off Champions Trophy preparations with clean sweep of England

AHMEDABAD: India came into this ODI series against England looking for some ideal preparation ahead of the Champions Trophy. The team will be pleased with the way things turned out.After winning the first two ODIs comfortably while chasing, India on Wednesday were put in to bat. They rose admirably to the task, putting on an imposing 356 before their bowlers throttled England in a big 142-run win.India's big hero of the day was Shubman Gill , who has been in blazing form all series. Gill 's seventh ODI hundred (112 off 102 balls; 14x4, 3x6) was the cornerstone of India's dominant batting display, with the likes of Virat Kohli and Shreyas Iyer chipping in with useful half-centuries as well.England began the chase brightly and were 126/2 after 18 overs, but they eventually lost the plot to be all out for 214. By the first six overs, the England openers had galloped to 60. Ben Duckett (34 off 22b; 8x4) smashed Arshdeep Singh for four boundaries in an over before the left arm pacer had him caught at mid-off by captain Rohit Sharma in the seventh over. Twenty runs later, Duckett's partner Phil Salt spooned a catch to Axar Patel at short third off another slower ball from Arshdeep to set England back.Also See: 2025 Champions Trophy Tom Banton and Joe Root added 46 for the third wicket before Banton edged a Kuldeep Yadav to 'keeper Rahul. Soon after, the England resistance withered away.Earlier, India recovered nicely after losing their captain in the second over. Kohli (52 off 55b; 7x4, 1x6) then found a bit of luck to contribute some valuable runs.After surviving a mix up with Gill in the seventh over, Kohli struck Mahmood for two consecutive boundaries before sweeping Joe Root's part-time off-spin for four. After a six off Livingstone, he completed his half-century before falling again to old nemesis Adil Rashid (4/64), this time edging a leg break to the 'keeper.A 104-run partnership between Shreyas Iyer and Gill in 15.3 overs then put India on the path to a formidable total. Gill reached his ton with a boundary through the deep mid-wicket region before he was castled by Rashid while attempting a premeditated sweep. India's vice-captain now has tons in all three formats in Ahmedabad.Iyer (78 off 64b; 8x4, 2x6), India's most fluent batter in the series, was particularly harsh on Gus Atkinson. Pandya lofted Rashid for two sixes but was then castled by a leg break that gripped off the pitch. KL Rahul too contributed a valuable 40 and India now go into the Champions Trophy as one of the sides to beat, if not the outright favourites in this format.",India beat England by 142 runs in the third ODI in Ahmedabad.

Sachin Tendulkar Exclusive Interview: On ISPL, memories of tennis ball cricket and more

NEW DELHI: Virat Kohli is unlikely to lead the Royal Challengers Bengaluru ( RCB ) in the upcoming edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL). It is reliably learnt that Kohli, who earlier held discussions with the management during the time of leadership vacuum, may not take up the role for IPL 2025 .With Kohli giving strong indications to the management, the think tank have been in a huddle for the last few weeks. Their entire auction strategy seemed to have revolved around Kohli and now that he may not take the job, the franchise has no option but to look within the group as they didn't show any desire to get a captain at the mega auction.It is further understood that the management has already had multiple discussions with senior India players in the RCB camp and Rajat Patidar has emerged as the frontrunner to lead the franchise from the 2025 edition. Krunal Pandya, who has proven captaincy credentials, is also an option as he always has been in the ""leadership plans"" of the franchise.It is learnt that the RCB management rates Krunal's leadership acumen very highly too and the all-rounder, who has been doing a stellar job as Baroda captain in the domestic circuit, continues to be part of the leadership group.RCB have sent an invite for a ""special media gathering for key announcement"" on February 13 and a captaincy announcement is likely. Director of Cricket Mo Babat, Head Coach Andy Flower and some key representatives of the franchise will be in attendance.There is also a possibility of mentor and batting coach Dinesh Karthik being present as he, too, played a key role in solving the captaincy puzzle.Patidar led Madhya Pradesh to Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy final this year where they lost to Mumbai in the title clash. He was the second-highest run-getter this season with 428 runs in nine innings.","Virat Kohli is unlikely to lead the Royal Challengers Bengaluru ( RCB ) in the upcoming edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL) It is reliably learnt that Kohli, who earlier held discussions with the management during the time of leadership vacuum, may not take up the role for IPL 2025.

His outstanding performance in the first ODI in Nagpur was the magnificent run-out of England opener Phil Salt .""It's not just about the catches we always look in, but the amount of effort you put on the boundary line by saving those crucial runs and getting those run-outs... cutting those angles on the field, and getting that important run-out in the first game when England were blazing at 75 for no loss, Shreyas Iyer,"" he said.When openers Phil Salt and Ben Duckett were playing brilliantly, England were aiming for a high score, but the former was dismissed by Iyer's throw to wicketkeeper KL Rahul","Fielding coach T Dilip says it was ""incredibly satisfying"" to watch Indian players make amazing catches and stop runs. India defeated Jos Buttler's team 4-1 in the Twenty20 Internationals and completed a clean sweep of the three- match ODI series.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118204856,imgsize-39610,width-400,resizemode-4/118204856.jpg"

MUMBAI: Snubbed from India's ICC Champions Trophy squad, where he has been named as a ""non-travelling reserve,"" opener Yashasvi Jaiswal will turn out for Mumbai in their Ranji Trophy semifinal clash against Vidarbha-a rerun of the Ranji Trophy final between the two teams at the Wankhede Stadium last season- which will be played from February 17-21 in Nagpur.While Jaiswal's availability for the big match is a massive boost for Mumbai, there is a slight worry for the defending champions too.According to a reliable source, India's T20 captain Suryakumar Yadav is in doubt for the game after he sustained a wrist injury during Mumbai's quarterfinal clash against Haryana at the Eden Gardens in Kolkata. The 34-year-old had scored 9 & an 86-ball 70, thus bouncing back to form, to help Mumbai score a 152-run win against Haryana, but hurt his wrist during the match.While Jaiswal has been added to the Mumbai squad -- which will travel to Nagpur on Friday for the match, the Mumbai selectors have retained the entire squad which played against Haryana in the quarterfinals.""Today morning, Jaiswal confirmed to me that he's available for the Ranji Trophy semifinal against Vidarbha. I have accordingly informed the selectors about the same,"" Mumbai Cricket Association secretary Abhay Hadap told TOI.However, in the case of SKY, a source revealed that the flamboyant batsman's participation depends on the status of his wrist injury.""The MCA's medical team is awaiting the results of his wrist's MRI scan,"" he said.In the only Ranji Trophy match that he played in this season, Jaiswal scored 4 and 26 in Mumbai's five-wicket defeat at the hands of Jammu & Kashmir at the MCA ground in BKC. However, the dashing left-handed opener, who scored 391 runs in five Tests@43.44 in the 2024-25 Border-Gavaskar Trophy, with one century and two half-centuries, will surely be itching to prove a point to the national selectors and will add muscle to Mumbai’s batting.""My message for Yashasvi is clear. His mere availability for the match is not enough. He has to perform well and help Mumbai win the game,"" asserted Mumbai chief selector Sanjay Patil.",Yashasvi Jaiswal will play for Mumbai in their Ranji Trophy semifinal clash against Vidarbha.

Champions Trophy: Will India and South Africa clash in another ICC final?

NEW DELHI: Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) skipper Smriti Mandhana believes that captaincy is an ever-evolving skill and that the Women’s Premier League ( WPL ) provides an excellent platform for growth.As she prepares to lead RCB in the third edition of the tournament, Mandhana reflected on how she has grown as a cricketer while leading the team over the past two seasons.Under her captaincy, RCB clinched the WPL title last year, defeating Delhi Capitals by eight wickets. They will now kick off their title defense against Gujarat Giants in the opening match on Friday.""Captaincy is something where you might think you know everything, but cricket constantly teaches you new lessons. Every day presents a fresh experience. From the first to the second year, I noticed a big shift in my approach,"" Mandhana said in the pre-match press conference in Vadodara on Thursday.""More than just captaincy, I have grown as a person over the last two to three years through my journey with RCB and the Indian team. There’s always something new to learn—no one can ever be a complete player.""Despite dealing with injuries in the squad, Mandhana remains optimistic about her team’s chances this season.""I'm really looking forward to this edition. We had a great training camp in Bengaluru, and the team looks well-prepared. We have some exciting young players who bring a lot of energy, and our overseas players have joined us in the last few days, so we now have a well-rounded squad,"" she said.""Injuries have affected us in the past month and a half, but they are beyond our control. However, we had a strong auction, bringing in talented youngsters, and our overseas replacements are top-quality players.""Mandhana also acknowledged the strength of Gujarat Giants, who will be led by Australian all-rounder Ashleigh Gardner this season.""They have a well-balanced squad after a good auction. In T20 cricket, all five teams are evenly matched—it all comes down to playing the best brand of cricket on the day,"" she said.Mandhana also praised Gardner’s leadership qualities.""She is one of the best all-rounders in women’s cricket and a batter who can clear the ropes with ease. She has a fighter’s mentality, which will undoubtedly reflect in her captaincy,"" she added.","Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) skipper Smriti Mandhana believes that captaincy is an ever-evolving skill.

Sachin Tendulkar Exclusive Interview: On ISPL, memories of tennis ball cricket and more

NEW DELHI: Srinagar Ke Veer delivered an outstanding all-round performance in the crucial Eliminator, defeating KVN Bangalore Strikers by four wickets to eliminate them from the Indian Street Premier League (ISPL), Season 2 at the Dadoji Kondadev Stadium in Thane on Thursday.In pursuit of 100, Srinagar overcame a slow start, where their premier batsman Sagar Ali initially played cautiously. The match dynamics shifted following Lokesh Chauhan 's explosive batting, securing victory with four deliveries remaining.Sagar, who began the innings, broke free with a six on his 13th ball and scored a vital 21-ball 28, including three sixes. Ashiq Ali Shamsu's disciplined bowling claimed two wickets in his first over, putting Srinagar under pressure.The match shifted dramatically when Shamsu conceded 22 runs in his subsequent over, reducing the requirement from 33 off 13 balls to 17 off 12. Rajesh Sorte (12 off 4 balls) capitalised by hitting Shamsu for a six, whilst Lokesh struck consecutive sixes off Farman Khan to secure Srinagar's victory.Previously, KVN Bangalore Strikers posted 99 for 7 after being asked to bat, thanks to contributions from Saroj Paramanik, Sanjay Kanojjiya and captain Prathamesh Pawar.The innings featured brilliant strokeplay, with 78 runs scored through boundaries and sixes, delighting spectators at the Dadoji Kondadev Stadium.Despite losing Ajaz Shaikhlal Bepari (8) early, Saroj Paramanik maintained momentum, striking four sixes in his 15-ball 30. Captain Prathamesh Pawar supported with 16 runs off 12 balls, including two sixes.Although Srinagar claimed several wickets, Sanjay Kanojjiya's arrival changed the momentum with his unbeaten 15-ball 29. He particularly targeted Sahil Longale's Tape Ball over, scoring 19 runs. Bhushan Gole contributed 11 runs to the total.Suvronil Roy, Prajyot Ambhire, and Raju Mukhiya claimed wickets for Srinagar.The second qualifier on Friday will feature Srinagar Ke Veer against Falcon Risers Hyderabad , with the winner advancing to face Majhi Mumbai in Saturday's final.",Srinagar Ke Veer defeat KVN Bangalore Strikers by four wickets.

Already trailing 2-0 - not for the first time at the Mumbai Football Arena this season - any faint hopes of a comeback against an FC Goa side oozing confidence were killed after a terrible blunder by centre half Mehtab Singh in the 64th minute.Goa winger Udanta Singh, who had already tormented Mumbai's lacklustre backline a fair bit by then, picked up a clearance by Islanders goalkeeper Phurba Lachenpa and sent in a cross. Seemingly unsure what to do with it, Mehtab ended up heading the ball perfectly into the path of the lurking Borja Herrera Gonzalez who calmly slotted past Lachenpa at the near post. 3-0, game as good as over!In a fixture where pre-match story lines revolved around players facing their past, Spanish striker Iker Guarrotxena , who had an unfortunate short-lived stint at the Islanders last season, returned to haunt his former team, scoring twice for Goa in the first half. An injury-time penalty put away by captain Lallianzuala Chhangte was all Mumbai could console themselves with in the end.For the visitors, the 3-1 result was an emphatic way to end a horrendous 13-match winless streak against Mumbai in the Indian Super League . It also helped Manolo Marquez 's side consolidate second place (39 pts) in the standings, and perhaps, keep alive their faint hopes of catching runaway leaders Mohun Bagan SG (46 pts) in the race for the League Winners Shield.For the hosts, who remain fifth (31 pts), it was another evening to forget at the Arena. They did go into the game having beaten Mohammedan SC 3-0 before playing out a goalless draw with East Bengal in their last two outings here. But whenever they have taken on teams above them in the table, it's often been a struggle, and sure enough, Petr Kratky's side sank to their fourth home defeat of the season.The absence of the injured Greek striker Nikolaos Karelis does seem to be weighing on the reigning ISL Cup holders as Kratky decided to give Jan signing Jorge Ortiz his first start.Barring one effort on target late in the first half and a couple of moments in the second, the Spanish forward wasn't quite able to inspire Mumbai against his old team. For that matter, neither could Brandon Fernandes, who switched to Mumbai after seven seasons with his hometown side last summer, and was loudly jeered by his old fans in the away stand every time he touched the ball.Guarrotxena, though, had the most enjoyable evening of the three men on the pitch who were taking on their former teams. After picking up an Udanta pass across the edge of the box and placing a right-footed finish through a crowd of blue shirts into the bottom right corner for his first (24th), he then neatly turned in the winger's cross on the half volley to double Goa's lead in the 41st minute.",Goa end 13-match winless streak against Mumbai with 3-1 win. Iker Guarrotxena scores twice for Goa. Borja Herrera Gonzalez and Lallianzuala Chhangte also on target for visitors.

Overall, it's a really great result,"" said Bayern coach Vincent Kompany , according to the BBC.After suffering their first home loss since December 2023, Celtic will have a difficult time trying to win the match in Germany on Tuesday. The winner will advance to play either Bayer Leverkusen or Atletico Madrid in the round of 16.""It's only a one goal difference. It's a big challenge, we know that but it's still a possibility,"" insisted Rodgers.Benfica defeated Monaco 1-0 on the road, with Vangelis Pavlidis scoring the lone goal. The home team had to play a large portion of the second half with just ten men.Just after halftime, a goal by Pavlidis gave Benfica the victory at the Stade Louis II. In November, Benfica had triumphed 3-2 at Monaco during the league phase.In his team's last five Champions League games, including a hat-trick in the thrilling 5-4 loss to Barcelona last month, the Greek international scored his sixth goal.Moatasem Al-Musrati, a recent Besiktas transfer, was sent off for Monaco in the 52nd minute when he gestured to the referee to request for a yellow card after his teammate Breel Embolo had been fouled. However, he received a second caution himself.Benfica will try to complete the match when they return the following week. The victors will play either Liverpool or Barcelona in the round of 16.Feyenoord defeated seven-time European champions AC Milan 1-0 in Rotterdam on Monday, overcoming the dismissal of coach Brian Priske and gaining the advantage to travel to San Siro for the return.Milan goalie Mike Maignan gave the Dutch a hand with a clanger as Igor Paixao's speculative third-minute shot bounced off his body and into the net.In a game played at De Kuip in pouring rain, that was the lone goal scored.""These evenings are why we do this,"" said Feyenoord captain Quinten Timber.""De Kuip was on it again. We were on it. On to next week,"" he added, with Inter Milan or Arsenal awaiting the winner in the next round.Earlier, a contentious stoppage-time penalty helped Club Brugge defeat Atalanta, the Europa League winners from the previous season, 2-1 in Belgium.Atalanta was penalized for careless play at the back when Ferran Jutgla gave the Belgian team the lead in the fifteenth minute. However, Mario Pasalic headed in an equalizer for the visitors just before halftime.That appeared to be the case until the hosts were given a penalty at the end when Atalanta defender Isak Hien's outstretched arm caught replacement Gustaf Nilsson in the face, causing him to go down.After examining the footage, the referee upheld his assessment that the touch was unintentional and not significant, and Swedish forward Nilsson scored the penalty.""I've only just seen the footage and I reckon that if you ask 100 people if that was a penalty all 100 would say no. It's very strange,"" complained Atalanta's Charles De Ketelaere.The winner of that match will next play either Lille or Aston Villa.","Bayern Munich defeat Celtic 2-1 in Champions League playoff.

Meanwhile, Paris Saint-Germain dominated an all-French match against Brest.Erling Haaland's double versus Madrid, his first goals in five games, appeared to have given Pep Guardiola's team a little lead, but the defending European champions are now heavy favorites to advance to the round of 16 going into next week's return leg in Spain.""It was a weird one. We played some of our best football of the season and ended up behind,"" Bellingham told Amazon Prime.""I don't care what form City are in they are still an unbelievable team. It's always tricky to play against them and we finally took the chance at the end.""City and Madrid have faced off in the competition's knockout round for the fourth straight season; in their last three meetings, the victor has gone on to win the Champions League trophy.After Josko Gvardiol chested down a cross from Jack Grealish, Haaland drove past Thibaut Courtois to give City the lead in the 19th minute, capping off a sluggish start at the Etihad.Haaland was denied a second goal shortly after halftime when his deflected shot bounced against the wall, and Madrid's Vinicius Junior struck the crossbar before City defender Manuel Akanji followed suit with a header.Dani Ceballos clipped the ball back into the area where Mbappe's mishit effort looped into the net after going off his shin and leaving Ederson stranded, giving Madrid the equalizer an hour after the City wall repelled a free-kick.After Ceballos clattered Phil Foden, Haaland tucked away a penalty to give City the lead again ten minutes from the end.However, after a terrible Ederson kick in the 86th minute, former City player Brahim Diaz tied the score for Madrid. Bellingham then punished the home team for more dubious defending when the England midfielder scored the game-winning goal in the dying seconds.""I don't know how to put it into words straight away, it's so raw and frustrating for everyone,"" said City defender John Stones.""It's a feeling of anger and frustration,"" he added. ""We need to see games out better. We need to step up when these bad moments happen.""Ousmane Dembele scored twice for PSG in a 3-0 victory over Brest in France, continuing his incredible goal-scoring run.Following a VAR review for a handball by Pierre Lees-Melou, a midfielder for Brest, Vitinha scored a penalty.Brest came very close to tying the dominant Ligue 1 leaders twice while playing an hour away in Guingamp due to their own stadium's noncompliance with UEFA regulations.While trying to knock the ball behind for a corner, Achraf Hakimi grazed the other upright, and Abdallah Sima hammered a header against the post.After a brilliant team play, Dembele swept past Marco Bizot at his near post to score PSG's second goal just before halftime.Halfway through the second half, the France international scored again with the help of a deflection, giving him 18 goals in his last 11 games.""Ousmane is full of confidence just now.

NEW DELHI: Liverpool 's quadruple bid for the season came to a stunning end as they suffered a 1-0 defeat against Championship strugglers Plymouth Argyle in the FA Cup on Sunday.Having fielded a weakened side, Liverpool manager Arne Slot saw his decision backfiring, with Ryan Hardie 's second-half penalty sealing Plymouth's epic upset at Home Park.In another high-profile clash, Aston Villa inflicted a 2-1 defeat on Tottenham Hotspur , piling further pressure on manager Ange Postecoglou .Villa took an early lead through Jacob Ramsey's goal, and Morgan Rogers doubled their advantage midway through the second half. Mathys Tel scored a late consolation for Spurs, but it was too little, too late.The 2-1 loss in the fourth round came on the back of an exit from the English League Cup semifinals after a 4-0 second-leg humbling at Liverpool on Thursday.Plymouth's victory over Liverpool is considered one of the greatest giant-killings in FA Cup history.The Argyle, managed by Miron Muslic, a former refugee from war-torn Bosnia, had already beaten Premier League side Brentford in the previous round and secured their first league win since November against West Brom.Slot acknowledged Liverpool's underwhelming performance, stating, ""We were not having a very good day. A result like this is the outcome."" Muslic, on the other hand, expressed his delight, calling it a ""magical day"" for Plymouth.Elsewhere, Wolves cruised into the fifth round with a 2-0 win over Blackburn Rovers, courtesy of goals from Joao Gomes and Matheus Cunha within 39 seconds of each other.The FA Cup exits for Liverpool and Tottenham have ended their hopes of achieving a quadruple and winning silverware this season, respectively. While Liverpool can still focus on the Premier League and Champions League, Spurs' only remaining chance for a trophy lies in the Europa League.","Plymouth Argyle beat Liverpool 1-0 in the fourth round of the FA Cup.

Liverpool suffered a humiliating FA Cup exit as Championship strugglers Plymouth ended their quadruple hopes with a stunning 1-0 victory in the fourth round on Sunday.Arne Slot ’s decision to field a weakened team backfired spectacularly, with Ryan Hardie’s second-half penalty securing Plymouth’s memorable triumph at Home Park.Slot made 10 changes from the side that dominated Tottenham 4-0 in the League Cup semi-final second leg, resting key players like Virgil van Dijk Mohamed Salah , Andrew Robertson, and Cody Gakpo. However, the gamble proved costly, marking a rare misstep in an otherwise stellar debut season for the former Feyenoord boss.Liverpool’s fourth defeat across all competitions this season also represented only the third time they had failed to score under Slot. More significantly, it was just the fourth instance of a Premier League leader being knocked out of the FA Cup by a lower-division club.The Reds must now regroup quickly ahead of the Merseyside derby against Everton at Goodison Park on Wednesday. A victory there would extend their lead over second-placed Arsenal to nine points in the title race. Meanwhile, they remain contenders in the Champions League last 16 and will face Newcastle in the League Cup final in March.Plymouth manager Miron Muslic masterminded one of the FA Cup’s greatest giant-killings while battling to lift his team from the bottom of the Championship. Muslic, a refugee from war-torn Bosnia, moved to Austria at the age of nine after fleeing his besieged hometown of Bihac in 1992.Having already eliminated Premier League side Brentford in the third round, Plymouth entered the match buoyed by their first league victory since November, a 3-2 win over West Brom. Their determined display against Liverpool will go down in FA Cup history.Playing under a wintry sun on the Devon coast, Liverpool’s under-strength squad suffered an early blow when Joe Gomez limped off injured in the first half. The Reds struggled to generate attacking momentum, with Plymouth’s relentless energy frustrating their efforts.James McConnell’s long-range strike in the 36th minute forced a save from Conor Hazard, but Liverpool otherwise lacked cutting edge.The breakthrough came in the 54th minute when Darko Gyabi’s overhead kick struck Harvey Elliott’s raised arm, leading to a clear penalty. Hardie calmly sent Caoimhin Kelleher the wrong way to put Plymouth ahead.Late pressure from Liverpool saw Diogo Jota and Darwin Nunez denied by superb saves from Hazard, as Home Park erupted in celebration at the final whistle.Elsewhere in the FA Cup, Wolves secured a 2-0 win at Blackburn, scoring twice in 39 seconds. Joao Gomes’ shot slipped past Balazs Toth in the 33rd minute, before Matheus Cunha’s blistering strike doubled the lead moments later.Struggling just two points above the Premier League relegation zone, Wolves welcomed the distraction of cup success as they advanced to the fifth round.Meanwhile, Tottenham boss Ange Postecoglou faces mounting pressure ahead of their clash against Aston Villa. Having previously claimed he always wins a trophy in his second season, the Australian manager is running out of opportunities to keep that promise if Spurs exit the FA Cup.",Plymouth beat Liverpool 1-0 in the fourth round of the FA Cup.

NEW DELHI: Kylian Mbappe 's timely strike secured a hard-fought 1-1 draw for Real Madrid against their fierce rivals Atletico Madrid in a tense La Liga encounter on Saturday.The result maintained Los Blancos' slender one-point lead over Atletico at the top of the table, while also keeping Barcelona within striking distance in third place.The match was a closely contested affair, with both sides displaying their defensive resilience and intensity. Atletico drew first blood in the first half through Julian Alvarez 's controversial penalty, which was awarded after a VAR review for a clumsy challenge by Aurelien Tchouameni on Samuel Lino.Alvarez coolly converted the spot-kick with a cheeky Panenka, much to the frustration of the Real Madrid faithful, who vented their anger towards the officials.However, Real Madrid responded swiftly in the second half, with Mbappe pouncing on a rebound from Jude Bellingham 's blocked shot to level the scores. The French striker's goal on his debut in the heated derby clash underlined his importance to the team and his ability to deliver in crucial moments.The second half saw Real Madrid take control of the proceedings, with Bellingham twice coming agonizingly close to putting his side ahead. The England international's headed efforts were denied by the woodwork and a fine save from Atletico goalkeeper Jan Oblak, who also produced crucial stops to deny Vinicius Junior, Rodrygo, and Mbappe.Despite their dominance, Real Madrid could not find the elusive winner, leaving both teams to settle for a share of the spoils. The result left Carlo Ancelotti 's side clinging to their narrow lead at the summit, while Atletico will rue their inability to capitalize on their first-half advantage.In his post-match comments, Ancelotti acknowledged his team's disappointment at not securing all three points but expressed satisfaction with their continued leadership of the league.""The team is disappointed because they think they deserved more... but we're happy because we're still leaders,"" Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti told reporters. ""In the second half we had total control, we had a lot of chances.""Atletico coach Diego Simeone , on the other hand, lamented his side's lack of composure in front of goal, particularly in the first half.""We had a good first half, but we weren't relaxed enough in front of goal to (score) more,"" said Simeone. ""In the end it was a draw in which both teams think they could have taken more from it.""The hard-fought draw sets the stage for an intriguing midweek clash, as Real Madrid prepare to face Pep Guardiola's Manchester City in the first leg of the Champions League play-off round.Meanwhile, the La Liga title race remains delicately poised, with Barcelona given an opportunity to close the gap on the top two when they face Sevilla on Sunday.",Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid draw 1-1 in La Liga derby on Saturday.

Meanwhile, Kevin De Bruyne 's late strike rescued Manchester City from an upset against third-tier club Leyton Orient, securing a 2-1 win.Chelsea's domestic trophy drought, which stretches back to their 2018 FA Cup triumph, will continue for another season after their lead at the Amex Stadium evaporated.An early own goal from Brighton keeper Bart Verbruggen gifted Chelsea the advantage, but the hosts responded emphatically.Georginio Rutter's well-taken header levelled the score, and Mitoma's deft finish in the 57th minute completed Brighton's comeback, despite Chelsea's protests over a potential handball. Enzo Maresca, Chelsea's interim manager, lamented the lack of VAR but acknowledged the result's consequences.""I think the handball is quite clear. Without VAR it's complicated,"" Maresca said.""The second half the only shots they had we conceded a goal from. We had a few chances at 2-1.

What was/is Mixed Madness?

What has been the criticism?

What has the USTA said about the criticism?

The US Open organisers have made a big change to their scheduling and format for the mixed doubles tournament, but not without criticism. Two weeks ago, the USTA (United States Tennis Association) moved the main draw start to a Sunday - following in line with the Australian Open and the French Open - which are 15-day tournaments. The new dates for the fourth and final Slam of the year were confirmed to be August 24 to September 7.The bigger change was announced on Tuesday (February 11) with the mixed doubles tournament set to get a massive change. Not without its share of criticism, though.In a bid to have more singles players enter the mixed doubles competition, the USTA have introduced a bumper $1 million prize money and a revolutionised scoring format.The event size will remain the same as last year - 16 teams or 32 players - but what will change will be the scoring structure and the timelines. The matches are destined to be shorter with the competition to be played over two days.The objective, the tournament organisers say, is to attract the sport's biggest stars, many of whom have long passed on doubles to keep themselves fresh for singles.The scoring is arguably the biggest change introduced. Early round matches will be best-of-three sets played to four games, with a deciding point at deuce. Tiebreakers would be at 4-all—rather than 6-6 — and a 10-point match tiebreaker would be played if the teams split sets, rather than a third set.The final, however, will resemble a Grand Slam match, a best-of-three sets played to six games with no-ad scoring, tiebreakers at 6-all and a 10-point match tiebreaker if there is no winner after two sets.Eight teams will earn direct entry by virtue of their combined singles rankings, with eight other teams given wildcards into the field.All matches will be played on the Arthur Ashe Stadium and Louis Armstrong Stadium courts.As per the plan announced on Tuesday, mixed doubles is set to be contested on August 19 and 20, during the week when the qualifying rounds for men's and women's singles are held at Flushing Meadows. Main draw in singles gets underway on August 24.""What I would say is the reason behind this is to appeal to more fans and grow the fan base around the world,"" said Lew Sherr , executive director and CEO of the USTA. ""But the way to do that is to have the biggest names in the sport participating in doubles, and to showcase them teaming up and playing in a different format, we think is exciting. In fact, we know it's exciting.""Sherr added that USTA had discussed a format change in the past but it never got going until they witnessed the thrill and excitement generated by the "" Mixed Madness .""""We've known and we've had conversations over the years, like, why don't they participate and we understand the scheduling challenges,"" Sherr said.""I think last year's task with that mixed madness event really informed our thinking, that if could unlock that week and free up the top singles players to participate, because it didn't compromise their fitness or their health going into the singles, there was a huge opportunity to attract them and that's what we saw.""The ""Mixed Madness"" was a one-night only, four team competition played last year during the Fan Week which precedes the singles main draw.With prize money of $500,000, the competition featured Naomi Osaka and Nick Kyrgios, Amanda Anisimova and Taylor Fritz, Coco Gauff and Ben Shelton, and Paula Badosa and Stefanos Tsitsipas.Team Badosa & Tsitsipas took the trophy with a final score of 6-4 against Team Anisimova & Fritz.Paul McNamee, the Australian former doubles World No. 1, was among critics of the shake-up, saying it would devalue the US Open mixed doubles title.""Sets to four games in a Grand Slam? 16 teams with eight based on singles rankings and eight wildcards. I'm sorry, but the US Open now will not produce a bona fide mixed doubles winner,"" McNamee wrote on X, formerly Twitter.""Devalued from a Grand Slam title to an exo (exhibition). Let's just say I'm in shock.""Poland's Jan Zielinski, a winner of the mixed doubles at the Australian Open and Wimbledon last year, described the revamp as ""sad.""""No communication with the players, no thought behind what it means to some people's careers, no respect to the history and traditions,"" Zielinski wrote on X. ""Sad to see.""Last year's US Open mixed doubles winners, Sara Errani and Andrea Vavassori, lambasted the decision in a statement on social media, labeling it a ""profound injustice.""""Making decisions just following the logic of profit is profoundly wrong in some situations,"" the duo wrote.""In the last few weeks we received the news that the US Open mixed doubles tournament will be completely turned upside down, cancelled and replaced with a pseudo-exhibition focused only on entertainment and show.""We see it as a profound injustice that disrespects an entire category of players... we don't know at the moment if we'll have the chance to defend our title but we hope this remains an isolated case.""With the doubles specialists all but out of reckoning for the mixed doubles event, it will reduce the option to earn points and money for them.""Yes, there's some that will be disappointed that they won't have the opportunity to compete in this event,"" Sherr said. ""On the other side, we know that there's a huge opportunity to create more interest globally in doubles and there may be a cascading effect here, that the mixed creates a bigger spotlight on the men's and women's doubles when we get into that portion of the tournament.""We'll have to see how that plays out, but we do know that our mixed competition historically has been competing with the men's and women's singles, and so the fields have suffered and the attention has suffered. This is a chance to give it a massive spotlight over two nights.""",US Open has revamped the mixed doubles format for the 2025 edition.

looks to a 15-year-old now

PUNE: A little over two years ago, Maaya Rajeshwaran Revathi lost in straight sets in the quarterfinals of a Grade 3 ITF junior event in Pune. ""I don't lose often. Maybe I will win it next year,"" Maaya, then just 13, had declared. Twelve months later, she did exactly that.Any lingering apprehensions were swept away at last week's Mumbai Open, a WTA 125 event. Unranked a week earlier, the 15-year-old Coimbatore girl now appears on the WTA charts at No. 646, putting her in the top-20 of highest ranking achieved on debut. The list includes Jennifer Capriati, Gabriela Sabatini, Monica Seles and the Williams sisters, among others.The teenager's arrival already spells hope for a beleaguered Indian tennis scene - starved of success, battered by apathy of the officialdom, and a court case against the national body.Imran Mirza, who once famously nurtured a prodigy, is very impressed. ""Her temperament is the most impressive part,"" Mirza, father-coach to Sania, told TOI, ""She seemed very level-headed. That's something one needs to go to the highest level.""We put a lot of pressure in India. With Sania, that was one thing we had to always control, the kind of external pressure there was,"" explained Mirza. ""There's already so much excitement with that one performance. She has a long way to go. We have to make sure she's not pressured into thinking that she's the only (one).""According to Imran, Maaya's parents - father Rajeshwaran who deals in procurement of construction raw materials, and mother Revathi, who co-owns a small business - are best placed to nurture her temperament. ""A child is bothered about what the parents think, not what the whole world thinks. Once the fear of losing comes in, it's very difficult to remove that,"" he said.Maaya's mentality reflects in her aggressive game. Even at 13, she wouldn't hesitate to put away a moonball.Manoj Kumar, coach since she was 10, said, ""We impressed upon her that to compete with the world's best juniors, she needed to be aggressive and at the same time become a bit more consistent.""Kumar underlined that Maaya was yet to complete her junior career. ""She hasn't yet transitioned into the women's circuit. She has done well in one tournament, she needs to do it regularly,"" he said.Transition to the pros has always proved the biggest hurdle in Indian tennis. Maaya seems to come well prepared. A little over five-feet-seven in her shoes, she has a good couple of more years to grow, putting on four kgs of muscle mass over the past year. ""I eat like a beast,"" she said recently.With the Rafa Nadal Academy offering her a one-year scholarship, the Indian is in a group of four players who are monitored by two head coaches and assistants. Last month, Miguel Fragoso accompanied her for junior events in India, but she can also summon the familiarity of Kumar in her corner.While the teenager will continue with schooling in Spain, Imran cautioned against too much tinkering with technique. ""In Europe, most of the training is more suited to the clay-court game,"" he said, ""There can be exceptions, (but) we seem to be more suited to hard courts because we have more skill in our hands, and in our joints than in the feet.""","Maaya Rajeshwaran Revathi, 15, is ranked No. 646 in the WTA rankings. The Coimbatore girl is in the top-20 of highest ranking achieved on debut.

Jannik Sinner’s success has a lot to do with coach Cahill: Amritraj,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/jannik-sinners-success-has-a-lot-to-do-with-coach-cahill-amritraj/articleshow/118122407.cms,"Vijay Amritraj

CHENNAI: Italy’s Jannik Sinner appears to be by far the most in-form men’s tennis player on the world circuit. Despite facing doping allegations, the world No. 1 did not let that affect him as he asserted his authority by winning the US Open and Australian Open.Indian legend Vijay Amritraj credited coach Darren Cahill for Sinner’s success. “The one major factor in Sinner’s game has been Cahill. I always knew that Darren had a very strong mental approach, and his ability to impart that to you and help you reach a point where you believe in yourself, where there is no second place for me – only first – has been crucial. And when I see Sinner play, I see a lot of that in him,” Vijay, who introduced Cahill to television, said on the sidelines of the Chennai Open Challenger. Novak Djokovic ’s decision to join forces with coach Andy Murray took Vijay by surprise. Djokovic and his former rival Murray began their partnership at the Australian Open, and the 37-year-old had a decent start to the season, reaching the semifinals.“I am surprised by Andy’s decision because he has just finished his tennis career, and to jump into something like this... you know, he has a family and would probably want to stay home. But he loves the game so much. I think they are a good match, and Andy can rejuvenate Djokovic to perform better.“Also, Djokovic’s match against (Carlos) Alcaraz was unbelievable – one of the best matches we have seen in a long time. Alcaraz is marginally more inconsistent mentally. He has more to offer in terms of his game,” Vijay added.The former Davis Cup finalist was vocal about the US Open’s move to add an extra day to the competition. He also stressed that the ATP reducing the number of 250-level Tour events is not a good sign. “By adding a day, they have killed the ATP 250 tournament the week before. The Slams are very important but let us not forget that you need tournaments in every part of the world. To become a Djokovic, (Roger) Federer, or (Rafael) Nadal, you still need other players to beat, right? These five or six guys alone cannot go and play the Grand Slams. You need another 100 players in the draw. So, I do not understand why they do not allow others to host tournaments.”'Trying to bring a big tournament to India'India lost its right to host an ATP 250 event a few years ago. In 2022, the country hosted a WTA 250 Tour event, but it has not been a permanent fixture on the calendar. Vijay has been pushing to host a top-level event in India but to no avail. “If you want to be a global sport, you need to have an event in India. When I was playing in the 70s and 80s, we had tournaments across all capitals in Asia. And you are saying none of this is possible? I am being very vocal with these guys about doing this,” said Vijay, who is the president of the Tamil Nadu Tennis Association (TNTA).",Vijay Amritraj credits coach Darren Cahill for Italy's Jannik Sinner's success.

Chennai: Soon after winning the Chennai Open Challenger men’s singles title on Sunday, Kyrian Jacquet humbly stated that he had not played his best tennis over the week. However, during the Frenchman’s journey to the crown, he defeated two seeded players and dropped just a single set.The 23-year-old Jacquet’s level was enough to comfortably beat Elias Ymer of Sweden 7-6(1), 6-4 in the final, a result that handed him the coveted title and 100 ranking points.At the SDAT Stadium , Jacquet made an early breakthrough, taking a 4-2 lead in the opening set. However, Ymer refused to back down, breaking Jacquet’s serve in the eighth game and pushing the set into a tie-breaker. But the tie-breaker was a one-sided affair, with the Swede making six unforced errors and leaving Jacquet with little to do.In the second set, Ymer’s unforced errors continued to give Jacquet an advantage and soon, the former was trailing 1-4. Though Ymer fought back, winning three games in a row, he faltered in the end. Inconsistency crept in, and errors began to pile up. Jacquet, maintaining his composure, comfortably cruised to victory with a double fault from Ymer sealing the win.Jacquet operated with the strategy of using his slices effectively, taking pace off the ball. By doing so, he disrupted Ymer’s rhythm, forcing him to generate more pace on his shots. “I played a lot of slices during all the matches because I like to play slices to change the rhythm. I try to destabilise the opponent. So yeah, I did well today (Sunday),” Jacquet said.Jacquet had previously mentioned that he believes his tennis is better than what his current ranking reflects. Last year, a string of injuries forced him to be sidelined for eight months, which led to a drop in his ranking. His performance in Chennai showed that he is on the comeback trail, proving his potential. “I play better than my rank, that is for sure. It was very tough last year, and I did all the work that I could to be ready to come here. I am really happy about the week because I was feeling better and better as the days went by. If I continue to play like this, I will go up faster (in the rankings).”Jacquet will jump above 60 places and get close to the top-200 mark in the ATP singles chart.","Kyrian Jacquet beat Elias Ymer of Sweden 7-6(1), 6-4 in the final.

MUMBAI: Going into Sunday's L&T Mumbai Open final, fifth seed Jil Teichmann was not aware if a win would send her back into the top 100 of the WTA Rankings .After a convincing 6-3, 6-4 win over Thailand's Mananchaya Sawangkaew at the Cricket Club of India , she knew.""My coach didn't tell me either,"" Teichmann said with a wide grin after picking up her second WTA 125k title in the last five months. ""For me it was definitely a goal to win this trophy. I am smart, so I kind of did the maths but I didn't know if it's going to be top 100 or not. The next little goal I had was to crack the top 100 again and to keep going.""Ranked 117 at the start of the week, Sunday's triumph launched the 27-year-old Swiss to 100th spot in the live rankings.The manner in which she played, not just on Sunday, but for most of this week, was a reminder, though, of why she was just outside the top 20 less than three years ago.Sawangkaew, the World No. 121, cracked under pressure from Teichmann's variety and precision in her groundstrokes, going down a double break in the first set. Even though she was able to get one back, the lead was too much as the fifth seed took the opening set.The Thai's forehand often let her down in the 1 hour, 37 minute encounter, and three errors in succession gave Teichmann an early break in set two. Though the eighth seed was able to break back immediately, the inconsistency in her game proved detrimental to her chances, as the Swiss grabbed the advantage once again.Sawangkaew did manage to draw level in the sixth game, but Teichmann banked on her lethal forehand, producing two timely winners to earn the decisive break in the seventh game.Her booming serve down the T has been another formidable weapon this week, and she landed one perfectly to bring up three match points. Sawangkaew saved the first but a deft backhand volley from Teichmann was a fitting way for the Swiss to complete the win, and take home $15,500.In the doubles final, Prarthana Thombare and Arianne Hartono endured heartbreak for the second year in a row, as the Indian-Dutch pairing went down 7-6(4), 2-6, 10-7 to the all-Russian combination of Amina Anshba and Elena Pridankina.","Jil Teichmann beats Mananchaya Sawangkaew 6-3, 6-4 in the L&T Mumbai Open final.

Carlos Alcaraz claimed his first indoor title at the Rotterdam Open on Sunday, defeating Australia’s Alex de Minaur 6-4, 3-6, 6-2 in a hard-fought final.The world No. 3 showcased his firepower from both wings, overpowering De Minaur, who defended admirably but lacked the finishing weapons to trouble the top seed.Alcaraz struck first, breaking in the third game with a mix of heavy groundstrokes and a costly double fault from De Minaur. The Australian, ranked No. 8, responded with a love break in the seventh game, leveling the set at 4-4.However, an ill-advised drop shot at 0-30 gifted Alcaraz another chance, and a powerful backhand pass set up the opportunity to serve out the set. The Spaniard capitalized, closing it out as De Minaur netted a forehand return.Momentum shifted in the second set, with De Minaur breaking early and surging to a 3-0 lead. He missed two chances for a double break but held on to even the match at one set apiece, sealing it as Alcaraz faltered with errant groundstrokes.The decider remained on serve until the sixth game when Alcaraz broke with a deft drop shot that De Minaur pushed wide. Serving at 2-5 to stay in the match, the Australian handed Alcaraz two championship points with a costly double fault.A weary backhand into the net sealed the Spaniard’s victory—his 17th ATP title — prompting a triumphant “Vamos!” as the Rotterdam crowd erupted.For De Minaur, it was a painful repeat of last year’s final, where he also finished runner-up, that time to Jannik Sinner.","Carlos Alcaraz claims his first indoor title at the Rotterdam Open on Sunday.

MUMBAI: Getting to the semifinals of the L&T Mumbai Open was already a massive success for Maaya Rajeshwaran Revathi , particularly considering the 15-year-old hadn’t originally planned to play the WTA125K event.On Saturday, Jil Teichmann , an opponent currently ranked 117 in the world, and as high as 21 less than three years ago, proved a hurdle too steep for the promising teenager from Coimbatore. The fifth seed from Switzerland needed only 68 minutes to seal her spot in Sunday’s final, winning 6-3,6-1 to end Maaya’s remarkable run at the Cricket Club of India here.Teichmann will battle the eighth seed Mananchaya Sawangkaew for the title, after the 22-year-old Thai stunned second seed Rebecca Marino 6-2, 6-2 in the first semifinal.As much as it’s been a special eight days for Maaya, who was given a wild card to the qualifiers by the tournament officials, it’s also been physically demanding. On Friday, she needed to go to a deciding set for the third time in the week to beat Japan’s Mei Yamaguchi in the quarterfinals. And she would admit to feeling the cumulative toll on her legs, as Teichmann seized control of the match from the start.The 27-year-old Swiss, with two WTA titles to her name, successfully managed to neutralise Maaya from the baseline with her powerful groundstrokes to break the y oung Indian twice for a 4-0 lead. Then, a loose game on serve which came out of nowhere sparked Maaya’s best spell of the match. The home girl was suddenly swinging freely and delighted the near full-house with three roaring winners to hold serve for the first time. She knocked on the door again in the next game, earning two break points, which the experienced Teichmann did well to stave off and extend her lead.Having negotiated the teenager’s best spell, Teichmann was barely troubled from there on.The challenge of taking on a quality lefthander, something Maaya had been wary about following her-quarterfinal win on Friday, had proven to be a daunting experience after all.“It (playing a lefty) was worse than I expected,” Maaya would chuckle later. “Also, I did play a very experienced player and I felt that I didn’t play the way I hoped I would. Also I was physically a bit tired.”There were still “a lot of positives” gained from a week which saw Maaya come into the tournament unranked and finish with 55 ranking points. When the latest WTA rankings come out on Monday, Maaya will be in 645th spot.","Jil Teichmann beats Maaya Rajeshwaran Revathi 6-3,6-1 in the semifinals of the L&T Mumbai Open.

He defeated the defending champion, Tommy Paul , in straight sets, 7-5, 6-3, to secure a spot in the final.Shapovalov's journey has been remarkable, as he previously eliminated world number four Taylor Fritz in the second round.In the other semifinal match, second-seeded Casper Ruud of Norway faced a tough challenge from Spain's Jaume Munar. After splitting the first two sets, the match went into a decisive third-set tiebreaker.

This marks the second top-10 opponent that Shapovalov has defeated in the tournament. His next challenge will be to face Ruud, the world number five, in the final on Sunday.Ruud acknowledged the difficulty of his match against Munar, stating, ""Second and third set (Munar) really stepped it up."" He also recognized the mental aspect of the game, admitting that he might have benefited from Munar's nerves as the Spaniard served for the match in the third set. ""I know what the feeling is like,"" Ruud said.""You can get tight. You kind of see the finish line a few yards in front of you and then you kind of stumble. I've done it myself and I was fortunate to be on the right side of it today.""In the tiebreaker, Ruud took control by hitting a backhand down-the-line winner to grab a 4-2 lead. He extended his advantage to 5-3 when Munar missed a backhand volley, and then went up 6-3 with an overhead smash.Ultimately, Munar netted a forehand to hand Ruud the victory, leaving their head-to-head record at 4-1 in favour of the Norwegian.For Ruud, this final represents an opportunity to claim his 13th career ATP title and his third consecutive finals win, following triumphs last year inBarcelona and Geneva.

NEW DELHI: Spanish world number three Carlos Alcaraz secured his place in the final of the Rotterdam Open on Saturday after a hard-fought and entertaining three-set victory over Hubert Hurkacz .The match showcased Alcaraz's resilience and determination as he overcame stubborn resistance from the Polish player, winning 6-4, 6-7 (5/7), 6-3.The match began with Alcaraz facing an early setback, as he was broken in his opening service game, allowing Hurkacz to take a 3-0 lead in the first set.However, Alcaraz displayed his fighting spirit, saving a break point with a brilliant crosscourt forehand and holding onto his serve.Despite facing three more break points, Alcaraz fought back, breaking Hurkacz's serve and seizing the game with a forehand smash after a lengthy rally.The momentum shifted in Alcaraz's favour, and he capitalized on a double-fault from Hurkacz to serve out the set, sealing it with a forehand drive volley winner.The second set proceeded more conventionally, with both players holding serve until the tie-break. The tie-break was a closely contested affair, with both players squandering chances to gain the advantage.Ultimately, a double-fault from Alcaraz at 5-4 up gave Hurkacz the opportunity he needed, and the Pole seized it, taking the set as Alcaraz netted a simple backhand groundstroke.The decisive third set started similarly to the first, with an early break of serve – this time in Alcaraz's favour. The Spaniard brought the crowd to their feet with his aggressive play, and his lead proved enough to break Hurkacz's resistance. Serving for the set at 5-3, Alcaraz booked his place in his 22nd ATP tour final with a trademark forehand winner up the line.""I want to be the first Spanish player to be able to win this tournament. I'm going to go for it. I'm really happy to be able to play a final in Rotterdam,"" said the 21-year-old Alcaraz, expressing his determination to claim the title.In the other semi-final, Alex de Minaur of Australia brought an end to the extraordinary giant-killing run of Italian qualifier Mattia Bellucci with a straight-sets win, 6-1, 6-2.De Minaur's consistency proved too much for the error-prone Bellucci, who was unable to replicate his earlier heroics against Daniil Medvedev and Stefanos Tsitsipas.""I'm very happy with the level today,"" said De Minaur. ""He's been playing with a lot of confidence this whole week, so I knew it was going to be a very tough battle.""

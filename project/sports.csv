Breaking: T20 cricket to be part of 2028 Los Angeles Olympics as IOC approves proposal

With cricket set to make a return to the Olympics after over a century, the International Cricket Council (ICC) has finalised how the six participating teams will be picked for the 2028 Los Angeles Games. During its recent Board meeting in Dubai on Friday, the global cricket body confirmed that six teams each from both men's and women's categories will feature in cricket's first appearance at the Games since the 1900 Paris Olympics.The ICC has been in a huddle discussing the possible arrangements, and the initial idea of just the top six teams as per the ICC T20I rankings has been put to rest. It will now be an arrangement where the top team from each region/continent will make the cut, and the sixth team will come through a global qualifier.""There have been discussions around the participation of teams, and it has been decided that the six teams will come through the top-ranked team from each region/continent, while the sixth comes from the global qualifier. The details will be shared by the ICC in due course, but the roadmap has more or less been frozen,"" says a veteran administrator who was part of the meeting in Dubai.The arrangement means every top side from each continent/region will make the first five teams. That essentially means that, based on current rankings, India qualify from Asia, Australia from Oceania, England from Europe, South Africa from Africa, and it will be interesting to see whether the USA — considering they are hosts — qualify from the Americas or West Indies would take the spot. The details of the global qualifier are likely to be shared by the global cricket body soon.Additionally, there is a small possibility of seeing an India vs Pakistan contest at LA28, as the details of the global qualifier are still unknown. In the detailed statement after the meeting, the ICC mentioned the success of women's cricket and shared an update on the LA28 Games.""The Board reviewed the ICC’s ongoing engagement with the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the Los Angeles 2028 Olympic Games (LA28), as cricket deepens its footprint in the global multisport landscape. At LA28, both the men’s and women’s T20 events will feature six teams each, comprising 28 matches in total,"" read the media release.",Cricket set to return to the Olympics after over a century.

'The right time to do it': Why did New Zealand legend retire from T20Is? Veteran batter explains

Poll What is the main reason for DSG's re-signing of Kane Williamson? Experience Recent performances Leadership skills

Former New Zealand captain Kane Williamson made a much-anticipated return to the Durban Super Giants (DSG) for the 2026 season of SA20, replacing Bangladesh spinner Taijul Islam in the squad.Williamson, who played for the franchise in the previous edition, was their top run-getter with 233 runs in eight innings at an impressive average of 46.60 and a strike rate of 118.87. Despite his strong performance, DSG finished last in the points table and released him after the season. His re-signing reflects the team’s renewed emphasis on experience and stability at the top of the order as they aim for a turnaround in the upcoming campaign.Taijul Islam, signed for R500,000 during the September auction, has reportedly pulled out of the season, paving the way for Williamson’s return. The veteran batter’s inclusion is expected to provide both solidity and leadership in a side that struggled for consistency last year.The move also comes shortly after Williamson announced his retirement from T20 Internationals, signaling a shift toward franchise cricket. He now plays on a casual contract with New Zealand Cricket, allowing him to feature in leagues around the world.In recent months, the 35-year-old has made his debut in The Hundred for London Spirit, returned to the Vitality Blast after seven years, and joined the Lucknow Super Giants in the IPL as a strategic advisor.Williamson has represented New Zealand in 93 T20Is, leading them in 75 matches and scoring 2,575 runs — the second-highest for his country in the format.The SA20 2026 season begins on December 26, with Durban Super Giants hosting MI Cape Town in their opening clash on December 28.",Kane Williamson re-signs for Durban Super Giants for 2026 SA20 season.

Kerala squad:

With just two points from three matches, last season’s runners-up Kerala find themselves in a precarious position as they prepare to face Saurashtra in a must-win Ranji Trophy Elite Group B fixture beginning Saturday at the KCA Ground, Mangalapuram.The team’s campaign has faltered so far, marked by inconsistent batting, injuries, and illness to key players. Yet, captain Mohammed Azharuddeen remains quietly confident of a turnaround. “We have included two U23 players in the squad — Varun Nayanar and Akarsh AK. We want everyone to step up in this crucial game,” he said on the eve of the match.Swashbuckling middle-order batter Salman Nizar, opener Rohan Kunnummal, and left-arm spinner Ankit Sharma have all missed out through injury, disrupting the team’s balance.Head coach Amay Khurasiya acknowledged the impact of those setbacks.“The injuries have definitely affected our rhythm. We’ve had to constantly reshuffle combinations, and that has hurt our momentum,” he said.However, Khurasiya believes the side has the depth to respond.The good news for Kerala is that both Ankit and Rohan are available for selection, thoughSalman remains sidelined.The inclusion of Nayanar and Amara signals Kerala’s intent to inject fresh energy into the side, with both youngsters eager to seize their opportunities at the senior level.Saurashtra, led by Jaydev Unadkat, have five points from three games and are chasing their first win of the season.For Kerala, overcoming Saurashtra will demand resilience and tactical clarity. Playing at home, however, could provide the spark they need.The conditions in Thiruvananthapuram are expected to favour spin as the match progresses, potentially bringing Kerala’s slow bowlers into play, provided the batting unit can post a competitive total.As Azharuddeen and his men take the field on Saturday, the equation is simple: get an outright win to stay alive in the tournament. Anything less could spell an early end to what began as a season of high hopes. “We are playing for seven points,” Khurasiya signed off.Mohammed Azharuddeen (c), Baba Aparajith (vc), Rohan S Kunnummal, Krishna Prasad , Ahammed Imran, Sachin Baby, Akarsh A K, Varun Nayanar, Abhishek P Nair, Sachin Suresh, Ankit Sharma, Harikrishnan M U, M D Nidheesh, Eden Apple Tom, Sibin P Gireesh.",Kerala face Saurashtra in a must-win Ranji Trophy Elite Group B fixture.

Former Australian winger Ryan Williams has become an Indian citizen in what marks a significant development for Indian football, with the ceremonial handover of his passport conducted by Indian football star Sunil Chhetri at Bengaluru FC . This milestone represents the All India Football Federation's initial success in incorporating Overseas Citizens of India into the national football setup, with Williams qualifying through his mother's Anglo-Indian heritage.The passport handover ceremony became a viral moment among football fans as Chhetri put Williams through an informal quiz about Indian street food and pop culture. Williams demonstrated his knowledge of Indian culture and playfully declared himself ""one of their own,"" creating a celebratory atmosphere at the Bengaluru FC camp.Williams' journey to Indian citizenship involved support from various stakeholders, including his family, friends, the Karnataka State Association president, and JSW, with final approvals obtained at the ministry level in Delhi. Despite having represented Australia at youth levels and earning one senior cap in a 2019 friendly, FIFA regulations permit him to switch his national allegiance.The footballer's professional career spans multiple continents, beginning in Australia at ECU Joondalup before moving to England in 2011. He has played for several English clubs including Portsmouth, Fulham, Gillingham, Oxford United, Barnsley, and Rotherham United, followed by a stint at Perth Glory in 2022.Since joining Bengaluru FC in 2023, Williams has made a significant impact, scoring 13 goals and providing five assists in 46 appearances.

In an exclusive chat with TOI, Sunil Chhetri opened up about his plans for life after football, hinting that the upcoming 2025-26 season could be his last if Bengaluru FC fail to lift the Indian Super League (ISL) title or secure qualification for continental tournaments.“If we win the ISL, it’ll allow me to wear the club’s colours on the international stage once more. But at 42, it’s tough. My goal is to score 15 goals this season and then retire,” Chhetri said.One of India’s all-time greats, Chhetri had brought the curtains down on his international career in June last year with an emotional farewell at Kolkata’s Salt Lake Stadium. He later made a brief comeback in June 2025 at the insistence of coach Manolo Marquez. Now that India’s hopes of qualifying for the Asian Cup 2027 final round are over, the veteran forward confirmed his return to the national team was short-lived.“It wasn’t hard telling Khalid sir about my decision,” Chhetri said. “When I came back, my only aim was to help India in the qualifiers. That was it. If the qualifiers hadn’t been there, I probably wouldn’t have returned. Once we were out, I felt at peace stepping away again, and the coach understood.”Also Read: Sunil Chhetri calls time on India career: 'At 42, it’s not easy' Earlier this year, when Manolo Marquez first reached out about a possible return, Chhetri had declined. But after his impressive ISL season—14 goals, just behind Golden Boot winner Alaaeddine Ajaraie—Marquez called again. This time, Chhetri took advice from his family and close friends before deciding to follow his instincts.“I knew the call came because of my ISL form,” he explained. “The qualifiers made me say yes in the end.”However, his second stint didn’t bring the success he had hoped for. Despite being the top-ranked team in the group, India failed to win any of their four games and were eliminated. Chhetri found the net only once in six matches after his return, finishing with 95 international goals—fourth on the all-time men’s list, behind only Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi among active players.Was there disappointment? “I’ve played long enough to know how football works,” he said. “There are no regrets about returning. The only regret is that we couldn’t qualify. I gave my best every game.”Chhetri also shared that he had declined the captaincy during his comeback, wanting others like Gurpreet Singh Sandhu, Sandesh Jhingan, and Rahul Bheke to take up leadership roles.“I’m thankful to the national camp for the warmth and respect I received,” he said. “It felt like rejoining family. The only bitter part is that we didn’t qualify.

Cornerback Josh Butler shared the emotional scene on Instagram, writing, “Love you dawg,” a tribute that captured the heartbreak felt across the league.Quarterback Dak Prescott also spoke about the devastating loss. “It's just a pain that you don't wish upon anybody,” Prescott said on Thursday. “You wish none of us had to go through this.” His words echoed the collective sorrow that spread through the Cowboys organization and the NFL community.Marshawn Kneeland’s death sent shockwaves across the NFL. During Thursday Night Football, the league held a moment of silence in his honor before the game between the Denver Broncos and the Las Vegas Raiders. His photograph was shown on the scoreboard at Empower Field at Mile High, drawing tears and applause from fans who knew him for his passion on and off the field.Authorities revealed that Kneeland died after a police chase north of Dallas.The Grand Rapids, Michigan native reportedly fled after a crash in Frisco, just minutes from the Cowboys headquarters. Police later confirmed they had been alerted earlier that night about his mental distress. “We’re talking to the girlfriend… she’s saying he is armed and has a history of mental illness and her quote was, ‘He will end it all,’” a dispatcher said in audio obtained by PEOPLE.His family released a heartfelt statement through his relative, Nicole Kneeland-Woods, expressing their anguish: “We are devastated by this tremendous loss and are still processing the depth of our grief.” She added, “He was kind, determined, humble and full of love.

The Dallas Cowboys have been blindsided by the loss of Marshawn Kneeland and the emotional aftermath isn’t something anyone inside that locker room is “processing quickly” or “using as fuel. ” It’s real pain, mixed with disbelief.And for safety Juanyeh Thomas, the most shocking part hasn’t been the league-wide reaction, it’s the tone-deaf fans who have already tried to turn a tragedy into storylines, takes, and playoff narratives. Thomas is known as quiet, calm, and reserved. But this time, he had enough. As soon as the DMs started coming in, he took it public, because it crossed a line.Juanyeh Thomas posted on X: “Stay outta my DM with the ‘this if this doesn’t spark Yalls defense’”’… I could care less about that s–t right now…” He added: “I just lost a brother , that I bled , sweated and cried tears with… Yall so caught up in this sports stuff , that y’all Mfs forget we just like y’all… But I expect that from y’all…..”That’s the part outsiders often forget, these guys spend more hours together in a year than some families do. It’s not just a headline to them.Dak Prescott made that point too on CBS News Texas, saying, “I hurt. Heavy, heavy heart today. I hurt for Marshawn. I hurt for his family. I hurt for his girlfriend [Catalina]. I hurt for every single one of my teammates.”For Dallas, the bye week arrived with eerie timing. They needed space before they go back out there on Nov. 17 vs. the Raiders. And this moment is a reminder, This isn’t “football content.” This is a 24-year-old teammate gone. And it’s not something that should ever be used as a storyline to fire up a defense.In the end, this isn’t about stats, standings, or rivalries. It’s about a young man who lost his life far too soon and a locker room reminding the world that grief isn’t entertainment or football content.","Dallas Cowboys safety Juanyeh Thomas publicly rebuked fans for trivializing the death of teammate Marshawn Kneeland.

Fans linked the clover to Shamrock Capital, interpreting the image as a quiet nod to Swift’s victory, even though Alwyn never addressed it publicly.

Taylor Swift fans once believed Joe’s clover photo was an indirect nod to the buyback and Shamrock Capital

More coverage on NFL:

Back in early 2025, before Taylor Swift’s $360 million masters buyback became one of the most celebrated business wins in modern pop music history, fans were already looking for clues, at times in places even the artist’s closest circle never acknowledged. One of those viral rabbit holes traced back to Joe Alwyn.The original theory sparked because the clover, to Swift’s online detectives, aligned too easily with the Shamrock Capital narrative, the firm Swift bought her music back from. In fan logic, it wasn’t just springtime imagery or St. Patrick’s Day aesthetics. It was support. It was a symbol. And it was emotional closure for a relationship that ran parallel to Swift’s fight for control over her catalogue.Alwyn didn’t say a word publicly about Swift’s historic business win. He didn’t post a caption about empowerment, ownership, or old battles finally ending. But Page Six amplified the fan narrative anyway, noting that Swifties genuinely believed “He’s happy for her.”Now, months later, this theory is trending again, not because anything new has happened, but because Swift’s masters deal is being revisited as a major turning point in celebrity-led IP ownership.And when pop culture cycles back, so do the symbols fans once obsessed over.It’s proof of how deeply Swift fans archive and how long they hold onto meaning. Even when the moment has passed. Old theories eventually become nostalgia. And in this case, the clover moment is now less about Joe and more about how Swift fans refuse to forget their favorite breadcrumbs.","Taylor Swift fans once believed Joe Alwyn’s clover photo was an indirect nod to the buyback and Shamrock Capital.

Pop culture’s most anticipated wedding is already inspiring fashion fantasies — and Law Roach has just added his thoughts to the mix. At the 2025 CFDA Fashion Awards in New York City, the acclaimed image architect, known for styling icons like Zendaya, Céline Dion, and Ariana Grande, was asked what Taylor Swift might wear when she walks down the aisle.While Roach said he doesn’t have “any predictions,” he’s certain that both Swift, 35, and her fiancé, Travis Kelce, 36, will “want to look great.” Having worked with the Kansas City Chiefs star for his GQ cover shoot in August, Roach expressed his excitement to see what Kelce will wear “as a groom.” He described the NFL player as “so nice and cool,” adding that he can “understand why [Swift] is madly, deeply in love with him. ” Roach also had warm words for the “Fate of Ophelia” singer, saying she’s “super nice” every time they’ve crossed paths.Swift and Kelce announced their engagement on August 26 with a charming garden-themed Instagram photoshoot. Captioned, “Your English teacher and your gym teacher are getting married,” the post showed the couple in preppy attire — Swift in a Ralph Lauren striped dress that perfectly echoed her romantic aesthetic.Kelce took ring shopping seriously, collaborating with Kindred Lubeck, founder of fine jewelry label Artifex Fine, to design a custom piece featuring a massive old mine brilliant cut diamond. Swift has been over the moon since receiving it. During her October 6 appearance on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon, she gushed, “It’s gorgeous — even the sides are beautiful! I look at it constantly, like it doesn’t feel in any way normal for me. ”Days earlier, on the Heart Breakfast radio show, Swift revealed how thoughtful Kelce was throughout the process. “I had shown him a video, I just thought her stuff was so cool,” she recalled. “When I saw the ring I [gasped] … I was like, ‘I know who made this, and also, you listen to me!’” She laughed, adding, “It was like, you really know me. I didn’t know what I would want, but he did somehow, and that’s kind of a flex.”Since the engagement, the Grammy winner has proudly flaunted her ring — from cheering at Chiefs games to nights out with Gigi Hadid. According to a source quoted by PEOPLE, Swift is ready to take a breather from work to plan her big day. “She’s been super focused on work commitments. She’s ready for a break so she can focus on the wedding,” the insider said. “She’s very excited about planning the wedding.”","Celebrity stylist Law Roach predicts Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce’s wedding day style.

Spoelstra was returning from a team flight from Denver when the incident occurred, while his three children were staying with their mother, former Heat dancer Nikki Sapp.The two-time NBA champion coach addressed the tragedy publicly for the first time before Friday’s game against the Charlotte Hornets. With his children by his side, Spoelstra appeared calm yet emotional as he expressed gratitude for the outpouring of support from the Miami Heat organization, the NBA, and the local community.Erik Spoelstra spoke candidly about the experience, saying the outpouring of love had helped his family stay strong amid the shock and loss. “Just want to thank everybody for this overwhelming support,” he said.“The South Florida community has been absolutely remarkable — people reaching out, wanting to help. It’s obviously been something uniquely challenging for our family, but the Spoelstras are resilient.”He continued, “Things in the house can be replaced, and if they can’t be replaced, what does it really matter? What really matters is family — the people closest to us. Our dog was also safe, not in the house, thank God. We’re just grateful that everybody is safe and in a great place.”Officials from Miami-Dade Fire Rescue confirmed that over 20 units responded to the massive blaze, which took firefighters nearly eight hours to fully extinguish. Flames were “as tall as the trees,” Battalion Chief Victoria Byrd said. The cause of the fire remains under investigation.Despite the destruction, Spoelstra declined the team’s offer to take a few days off, saying his children wanted to attend the game. “The kids wanted to come to the game tonight,” he said. “So, I figured if they want to come to the game, then I’d better work.”Spoelstra emphasized the importance of normalcy and gratitude. “The players and the staff have been amazing, reaching out yesterday and today,” he shared. “Players and their significant others are even organizing some surprises for the kids, maybe a few toys we lost in the fire.”As the Heat prepare for their back-to-back games this weekend, Spoelstra’s focus remains on both basketball and family.Also Read: Richie Adubato’s cause of death: Former Magic coach and radio analyst passes away at 87","Erik Spoelstra's South Florida home was destroyed in a fire early Thursday morning.

NBA Europe’s 2027 target: “a semi-opening” season



Adam Silver on Europe expansion

The NBA ’s global ambitions are inching closer to reality, as officials confirmed that the league’s long-planned European branch could tip off as early as October 2027. The new venture, developed in partnership with FIBA, is expected to feature some of the continent’s biggest basketball markets and potentially reshape the sport’s global structure. Though details remain under discussion, league executives have made significant progress in mapping out logistics, funding, and competitive structure.The project, which has been in development for years, envisions a 16-team league made up of 12 permanent franchises and four qualifying clubs determined by their domestic or FIBA performances. Targeted host cities include London, Paris, Madrid, Rome, Berlin, Athens, and Istanbul— locations rich in basketball heritage and commercial appeal. While no formal agreements have been announced, the groundwork for this transcontinental league appears stronger than ever.NBA Europe managing director George Aivazoglou revealed at a conference in Milan that the initial rollout may be considered “a semi-opening,” meaning the league could launch with fewer than 16 confirmed franchises. “We’re well underway in our approach and engagement with the market,” Aivazoglou said.“We’re having serious discussions with respect to investors.”Aivazoglou noted that one of the league’s most compelling features would be its qualification model. “That possible element — having teams qualify through their domestic league finishes — is probably the most exciting part of the plan, because we all know that the domestic leagues today are not necessarily what they had been 20 or 30 years ago,” he explained.The NBA’s collaboration with FIBA has fast-tracked planning, with JPMorgan Chase and Raine Group advising on financial and strategic operations.NBA Commissioner Adam Silver reinforced the league’s commitment to launching within the next few years, calling the 2027 timeline “ambitious, no doubt about it.” While acknowledging logistical challenges, he added, “I don’t think I’d want to go much longer than ’28. The opportunity is now to do something like this.”Silver previously suggested that aligning the league’s debut with the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics could enhance its visibility. He also pointed out that existing European arenas could host early games until new facilities are developed.“I think our basketball people now are very engaged in how the competition will work,” Silver said in September. “Our lawyers are thinking hard of how we can take a system that’s now known to U.S. sports as sort of a cap-based system and a revenue-sharing system with players and how we can apply that in a European framework. Nothing is easy here… but the response has been tremendous.”The league’s creation shows basketball’s explosive growth across Europe. About one in six NBA players now comes from the continent, including Nikola Jokić, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Luka Dončić, and Victor Wembanyama— stars who’ve dominated MVP conversations in recent years.Also Read: Why did Megan Thee Stallion skip 2025 Grammys?

Nikola Jokic’s Injury Status vs Golden State Warriors (November 7, 2025)

Denver Nuggets Enter at Full Strength

Golden State Warriors Face Major Injury Setbacks

What to Expect from Tonight’s Showdown

Nikola Jokic is officially available for tonight’s highly anticipated clash between the Denver Nuggets and the Golden State Warriors on November 7, 2025. The matchup, set at Denver’s Ball Arena, stands out as one of the most intriguing early-season games in the Western Conference, featuring the reigning champions going up against a Warriors team dealing with critical injuries.Fans can expect an intense contest, as Jokic, the two-time MVP, continues his dominant campaign leading Denver’s offense with incredible balance and precision. His all-around excellence - averaging 24.1 points, 13.4 rebounds, and 12 assists per game - has made him nearly unstoppable, and his presence tonight gives the Nuggets a major edge against a short-handed Golden State lineup.According to the latest team updates, Nikola Jokic is fully fit and has no injury concerns heading into the matchup. He’s expected to play extended minutes and take charge of Denver’s offense as usual. Jokic’s consistent triple-double performances this season have solidified his reputation as one of the league’s most complete players. His court vision, rebounding dominance, and scoring versatility make him the focal point of the Nuggets’ system, especially against a Warriors defense that will already be stretched thin without Stephen Curry.The Denver Nuggets are in excellent health overall. Jamal Murray, Nikola Jokic’s backcourt partner, is also active and continues to contribute efficiently on both ends of the court. The only minor concern for Denver is forward Zeke Nnaji, who remains listed as probable due to a mild ankle sprain. However, the team expects him to be available, and his absence - if any - won’t majorly affect the rotation. With their core intact, the Nuggets have a strong opportunity to build momentum on their home court and extend their winning form.The situation is more challenging for the Golden State Warriors. Stephen Curry, the team’s leading scorer and emotional leader, has been ruled out due to illness. His condition reportedly worsened overnight, forcing the team to rest him as a precaution. Meanwhile, Jimmy Butler - recently acquired to boost the Warriors’ defensive and veteran presence - is questionable due to a back strain. Draymond Green is probable with a rib issue but is expected to play through the pain. The Warriors’ depleted lineup will need exceptional contributions from their bench and secondary scorers to stay competitive against the defending champions.With Nikola Jokic leading a fully healthy Nuggets squad and the Warriors battling multiple injuries, Denver enters the contest as clear favorites. Expect the Nuggets to push the tempo early, using their depth and ball movement to exploit Golden State’s weakened rotation. The Warriors, on the other hand, will rely heavily on defensive adjustments and timely perimeter shooting to stay within striking distance.Also read: Is Stephen Curry playing tonight vs the Denver Nuggets?

Megan Thee Stallion skips the Grammys as Klay Thompson faces unexpected bench role in Dallas

NBA star Klay Thompson's singer girlfriend, Megan Thee Stallion , recently skipped the 2025 Grammys as her single ""Megan"" didn't receive a nomination. The situation has become the part of a larger conversation about her independent status, challenges compared to major label artists in the music industry, and the lack of recognition.Meanwhile, Klay Thompson also made the news when Meg did. He came off the Dallas Mavericks bench for the first time on Wednesday night, in favor of D'Angelo Russell. As per reports, he didn't sign with the Mavs to sit on the bench. It appears that he expected a more significant role within the team.The 2025 Grammy Awards is already a huge success. However, while a ton of A-listers attended the ceremony, there are a few celebs, like Meg, who skipped it. This is probably because despite Megan's first solo Hot 100 No. 1 hit with ""Hiss"" and the ongoing popularity of subsequent singles like ""Mamushi,"" her self-titled third studio album did not appear on this year's list of Grammy nominations.However, Megan appeared at Clive Davis' annual Pre-Grammy Gala on Saturday, February 3, even though she was not present at the actual award ceremony this year. Amidst all this, she further made the news after her NBA boyfriend, Klay Thompson’s reported disagreement with his team, Dallas Mavericks Coach Jason Kidd made the decision to start Thompson off the bench for the first time since he joined the Mavericks during the game against New Orleans. He made the decision reportedly to boost an offence that had recently lost consistency and flow.However, Klay Thompson wasn't sent to Dallas to play backup. He believed that he was joining a championship team and would get passes from Kyrie Irving and Luka Doncic when he first decided to leave the Golden State Warriors. Nevertheless, Kidd stressed in a recent interview that it's an experiment rather than a permanent move. As a seasoned professional, Thompson responded in the most responsible manner. He said:“I don’t care, I’ll play the same way. I’m going to do great things. I know they’re coming..”Even off the bench, Thompson made a strong contribution with 11 points on 4/7 shooting, 4 rebounds, and 3 assists in 21 minutes. Dallas lost to the Pelicans by just two points in a game that remained close until the very end.Also read: Megan Thee Stallion’s stunning new alliance sends shockwaves through the NBA in a way no one saw coming","Megan Thee Stallion skipped the 2025 Grammys as her single ""Megan"" didn't receive a nomination.

Head coach Steve Kerr emphasized that Curry’s health remains the priority, choosing rest over risk - a decision that could significantly impact the Warriors’ offensive rhythm.Jimmy Butler’s status also remains uncertain. Dealing with a lower back strain, Butler missed the team’s previous game against Sacramento and is listed as questionable. He has been averaging around 19 points, 5 rebounds, and 4.5 assists this season, making him a crucial two-way presence. His potential absence could further expose Golden State’s vulnerabilities on both ends of the floor.Draymond Green, the team’s emotional leader and defensive anchor, is probable with a rib contusion.

Theare preparing to face off on November 7, 2025, in a regular season showdown that carries plenty of intrigue — and significant injury concerns. Both teams enter the matchup dealing with key absences that could heavily influence lineups, rotations, and overall strategy. As this game also marks Miami’s debut in the NBA Cup tournament group stage, the stakes are even higher for a team looking to overcome adversity through depth and adaptability.For Charlotte, this matchup presents a valuable opportunity to exploit the Heat’s weakened frontcourt, while Miami will look to defend home court despite missing major contributors. The injury landscape heading into this Eastern Conference contest has added unpredictability, making it one of the more closely watched games of the night.The Charlotte Hornets come into the contest managing several critical injuries that have disrupted their rhythm. Star point guard LaMelo Ball is listed as questionable with a right ankle impingement - an issue that has persisted since last season, even after offseason surgery.Ball has missed the past two games and his status remains uncertain ahead of tip-off. Before his absence, he was delivering impressive numbers, averaging around 23.3 points, 7.8 rebounds, and 9.8 assists per game, showcasing his all-around brilliance.Collin Sexton, who has been dealing with a neck strain, is probable and expected to take on more offensive duties if Ball sits out again. Meanwhile, Josh Green (shoulder) and Grant Williams (knee) have both been ruled out, reducing Charlotte’s depth on the wing. Rookie Brandon Miller also remains sidelined with a left shoulder subluxation. These setbacks leave the Hornets shorthanded in both their backcourt and forward rotations - a concerning sign for a team that relies heavily on perimeter play and fast-paced offense.The Miami Heat, too, are dealing with injury issues that could affect both ends of the court. All-Star center Bam Adebayo has been ruled out with a left big toe sprain, confirmed by MRI after he left their previous game against the Denver Nuggets. While the team labeled him day-to-day, Adebayo won’t suit up against Charlotte. His absence leaves Miami without their defensive anchor and interior leader, forcing second-year big man Kel’el Ware and rookie Vlad Goldin - making his NBA debut after being called up from the G-League - to fill the void.Tyler Herro continues to miss time with an ankle injury, removing one of Miami’s key scoring threats. In his absence, Norman Powell has stepped up impressively, delivering multiple 20+ point performances to help balance the offense. However, without Adebayo patrolling the paint, the Heat’s defense and rebounding responsibilities become major question marks.The upcoming clash poses significant tactical challenges for both sides. For the Hornets, the uncertainty surrounding LaMelo Ball’s availability could hinder their offensive flow and transition efficiency. Without their primary playmaker, Charlotte will have to rely on Sexton’s aggression and bench contributions to generate momentum.For Miami, missing Bam Adebayo could prove costly against a team that likes to attack the paint and move the ball quickly. The Heat’s young frontcourt will be tested under NBA Cup pressure, and their ability to adapt will likely dictate the game’s outcome.The Charlotte Hornets vs Miami Heat injury report ahead of November 7, 2025, highlights how both teams are forced to adjust on the fly. With star players sidelined, bench depth and adaptability will take center stage. Miami aims to open their NBA Cup campaign with a win despite a depleted lineup, while Charlotte looks to take advantage of the Heat’s frontcourt gaps to build momentum in their rebuilding season.As the ball tips off in Miami, both teams will be navigating uncertainty, hoping resilience and teamwork can overcome the absence of their top talents.","The Charlotte Hornets and Miami Heat face off on November 7, 2025.

'United voice'

Top WTA stars, including Aryna Sabalenka and Iga Swiatek, are calling on the four Grand Slams to get back to the negotiation table and reconsider their proposals regarding revenue sharing, player welfare and consultation.""For sure it would be great if the Grand Slams wanted to talk to us, because that's how it's supposed to be and I don't really get why there's no more open conversation,"" Swiatek told AFP in Riyadh, where the WTA Finals are being held.""It's not only about prize money, but also about the pension, the health plan and just having more smooth cooperation and communication in the future. So I think for sure it's a setback and for sure the players are not happy with it.""World number one Sabalenka added: ""I think it's the time right now to sit at a table and come to a conclusion that everyone will be happy with.""The leading players of the women's and men's tours joined forces this year and sent a letter to the four majors seeking a higher percentage of tournament revenue and contributions towards tour-funded welfare programmes such as pensions.The players would also like to be consulted when any of the Slams consider making changes that could directly affect them.The first meeting between the players -- repped by Sabalenka, Jannik Sinner, Casper Ruud, Coco Gauff, Alex de Minaur and Madison Keys -- and the majors was in Paris at Roland Garros in May.Further discussions took place during Wimbledon a few weeks later, with Larry Scott, a former WTA chief who is acting as an advisor for the players.According to people familiar with the matter and documents seen by AFP, communication stalled during the summer as the majors informed players they would have to postpone looking into their proposals until other matters have been resolved.These include the lawsuit launched against them by the Professional Tennis Players Association (PTPA), as well as potential plans for a massive restructuring of the sport in favour of a ""premium tour"".AFP understands a second letter was sent to the majors on July 30 in which the players said they did not believe plans for future tour reforms should delay action.It is understood that only the US Tennis Association (USTA) and All England Club (AELTC) met with players' representative Scott during the US Open in September and that communication has stalled since.Part of the proposal is for a Grand Slam Player Council to be formed, similar to the ones that exist in the WTA and ATP tours, which would allow for players to be consulted on matters affecting prize money, schedule, rules and policies.American world number five Jessica Pegula, an active member of the WTA Player Council, said the players were seeking changes that could benefit the entire tennis ecosystem, and not just those at the top.""We're just trying to be a united voice,"" said Pegula.""I think it's the first time we've actually been able to come together with both tours. And so that's a testament to just everybody being really open-minded and wanting to come together on making our sport better and better for the players.""Pegula noted that the Slams are ""not really responding"" at the moment, adding: ""That's kind of our problem. So I think we'll just keep using our voices to speak out and see if we can come to the table with them. I think the ball is a little bit in their court right now.""Australian Open champion Keys said the situation was ""obviously frustrating"".""I feel like we're doing it in a very above board, mature way,"" said the American world number seven.""So I hope that the Grand Slams continue to have the conversations and are willing to move forward in a positive light.""Currently about 13 to 15 percent of Grand Slam revenue is paid out as prize money. The players have proposed a staged increase towards 22 percent.The total prize money for this year's US Open amounted to $90 million, a 20 percent increase on the $75 million in 2024. Wimbledon have doubled their prize money over the past decade.In a statement sent to AFP, an All England Club spokesperson said the organisation is ""always open to having constructive discussions to achieve the best possible outcome"" for the sport, as well as players and fans.They added they have been in ""regular dialogue"" with the players and their representatives, and that these ""conversations will continue"".",Top WTA players are calling on the four Grand Slams to get back to the negotiation table. The players are seeking a higher percentage of tournament revenue and contributions towards tour-funded welfare programmes. They would also like to be consulted when any of the Slams consider making changes that could directly affect them.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125150980,imgsize-2389498,width-400,resizemode-4/aryna-sabalenka-vs-iga-swiatek-net-worth-in-2025-who-is-richer-earnings-tennis-rivalry-career-and-more.jpg"

What will be the rules in the Sabalenka vs Kyrgios match?

When Kyrgios and Sabalenka step up for the showdown, the size of the court will be noticably different. The court on Sabalenka's side will be 9 percent smaller than usual - both in length and width.

Both players will receive just one serve, in order to reduce Kyrgios' advantage when starting the point. Worth pointing out, though, that Sabalenka has one of the biggest serves across tours.

The match will be a best-of-three set affair, with a 10-point tiebreak to be played at 1-1.

History of rules in Battle of the Sexes matches

Women's World No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka and controversial player Nick Kyrgios are set to face off in a historic Battle of the Sexes match on December 28 in Dubai. The showdown between the top-ranked woman and men's No. 652 will be the fourth such gender-crossing match in tennis history, organised by their shared agency, Evolve.The match follows months of heated exchanges between the players. Kyrgios sparked controversy when he claimed on a podcast with Alexander Bublik that ""women can't return our serves."" Sabalenka fired back during the US Open, stating ""I'll try my best to kick his **.""Kyrgios has been mostly absent from competitive tennis, playing just three matches since returning from a wrist surgery at the Australian Open. In contrast, Sabalenka has dominated the women's circuit, winning 59 of 70 matches and claiming four titles, including a title at the US Open this year.The Australian player has since softened his tone, showing respect for his opponent. ""When the world No 1 challenges you, you answer the call,"" Kyrgios said. ""I've got massive respect for Aryna; she's a powerhouse and a true champion. But I've never backed down from a challenge, and I'm not just here to play — I'm here to entertain.""This match follows in the footsteps of three previous Battle of the Sexes contests. The most famous occurred in 1973 when Billie Jean King defeated Bobby Riggs, a victory that helped establish the Women's Tennis Association. Earlier that year, Riggs had beaten Margaret Court. The last such match took place in 1992, with Jimmy Connors defeating Martina Navratilova.Mixed-gender tennis matches have a rich history dating back to 1888, featuring memorable encounters between male and female champions. The tradition began when Wimbledon champions Ernest Renshaw and Lottie Dod faced off, with Renshaw winning 2-6, 7-5, 7-5, despite Dod starting each game with a 30-0 advantage.These unique matches continued through the years, with one notable encounter in 1975 between Evonne Goolagong Cawley and Ilie Nastase. The match had special rules - Nastase showed up wearing a dress and could only approach the net when forced by Goolagong's shots. He was also limited to one serve, while Goolagong could hit into the doubles alleys. Goolagong won the match 7-5.A more recent exhibition match took place in 2017 at an unusual venue - a shopping center. Former champion Pat Cash, then in his fifties, played against British number one Johanna Konta on an artificial surface. The match was officiated by Greg Rusedski, with Cash displaying what was described as ""flamboyant"" shot-making. However, youth prevailed as Konta won the match 6-3.",World No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka to take on Nick Kyrgios in Battle of the Sexes match. The match will take place in Dubai on December 28.

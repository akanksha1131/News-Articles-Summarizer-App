'Practically impossible to have three captains': Ajit Agarkar explains why Shubman Gill succeeded Rohit Sharma as ODI skipper

ODI squad for Australia tour:

T20I squad:

Ahmedabad: Shubman Gill’s elevation to ODI captaincy was clearly because the selectors want him to have enough exposure as leader of the ODI team before the next World Cup in South Africa, Zimbabwe and Namibia in Oct-Nov 2027. It’s was unclear if India’s Test vice-captain Ravindra Jadeja, the player of the match in the Ahmedabad Test that concluded on Saturday, would be able to fit in that vision for 2027, since he has not been included for the ODI leg.Jadeja has already retired from the T20I format and Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli have retired from Tests and T20Is.“Obviously at some stage you got to start looking at where the next World Cup is,” chairman of selectors Ajit Agarkar stressed.Admitting that it was a difficult call to remove Rohit as captain, Agarkar said that Rohit was informed about the decision but refused to divulge the details of the conversation.“That’s a conversation between Rohit and me. Even if he did not win the Champions Trophy as captain, it would have been a difficult decision because of how good he’s been for India. But you’ve got to sometimes look at what’s coming forward, where you stand as a team, and eventually look at what’s in the best interest of the team, whether it’s now or maybe six months later.Those are the calls that I suppose we are put in place to make here.”The former India allrounder explained that because there are so few one-day games being played, the selectors feel that calls related to captaincy changes needed to be made early. “It’s practically impossible to have three different captains for three formats in terms of planning. You’ve got to start planning. You play the ODI format the least. We have to try and give the other guy enough chance to get that confidence of leading another format. ”Agarkar did not say it in as many words but mentioned that the team picked was only for the Australia tour, and Rohit and Kohli’s inclusion or Jadeja’s exclusion offers no guarantees that they would be picked or omitted in the side for the 2027 World Cup.“As far as the 27 World Cup is concerned, I don’t think we need to talk about it today.”He, however, said in a no-nonsense manner that both Kohli and Rohit would be expected to play some form of domestic cricket. “That is the only way you can remain sharp, by playing cricket. We have been clear over the last two years that if you are available, you are expected to play in domestic cricket.”About Jadeja’s exclusion, Agarkar explained that the conditions in Australia would not warrant the need for two left-arm spinners. “It was not possible to take two left-arm spinners to Australia (Axar Patel is there in the ODI squad too),” he said.Shubman Gill (c), Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, Shreyas Iyer (vc), Axar Patel, KL Rahul (wk), Nitish Kumar Reddy, Washington Sundar, Kuldeep Yadav, Harshit Rana, Mohammed Siraj, Arshdeep Singh, Prasidh Krishna, Dhruv Jurel (wk), Yashasvi Jaiswal.Suryakumar Yadav (c), Abhishek Sharma, Shubman Gill (vc), Tilak Varma, Nitish Kumar Reddy, Shivam Dube, Axar Patel, Jitesh Sharma (wk), Varun Chakaravarthy, Jasprit Bumrah, Arshdeep Singh, Kuldeep Yadav, Harshit Rana, Sanju Samson (wk), Rinku Singh, Washington Sundar.",'Practically impossible to have three captains': Ajit Agarkar explains why Shubman Gill succeeded Rohit Sharma as ODI skipper.

India on top! Fans react to Day 3 dominance vs West Indies | IND vs WI 1st Test

Ahmedabad: They say champion teams show a level of ruthlessness without being arrogant, simply because they are so confident that, man to man, they are much above the level of the opposition in familiar conditions. The West Indies team of the 1970s and 1980s had that. The Australian teams under Steve Waugh and Ricky Ponting had that quality too.The Indian Test team playing at home possessed that aura too — until New Zealand punched a few holes in it last year and won 3-0. India, under Gautam Gambhir and Shubman Gill, took baby steps to recapture that dominance by crushing West Indies by an innings and 140 runs on Day Three of the first Test at the Narendra Modi Stadium.Already in a commanding position at the end of Day Two, India declared overnight at 448/5. They were sitting on a lead of 286 and wanted to use the freshness of the pitch in the morning session. West Indies were rolled over for 146 half an hour before tea, with Ravindra Jadeja following up on his 104 not out to lead the attack with 4-54.There were suggestions that Washington Sundar and Nitish Kumar Reddy could have done with a hit and some runs, but with the forecast for Sunday and Monday not being too sunny, India did not want to take chances.Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Siraj got the ball moving to the two West Indian left-handed openers, John Campbell and Tagenarine Chanderpaul, especially while bowling from round the wicket. Siraj tested Chanderpaul with a short one that he pulled and gloved into no man’s land.Unlike his father, Shivnarine, who seldom hit the ball in the air and had the ability to bat for long periods of time, Tagenarine did not learn from the previous miscue and attempted another aerial pull.He connected well, but Nitish Kumar Reddy dived full-length to his left and took a stunning catch while being parallel to the ground. Despite Siraj going through another long spell of 7-1-16-1, the pitch started offering generous turn an hour into Day Three — from even the good areas of the playing surface and not just the rough. These were conditions tailormade for Jadeja.Fresh from an unbeaten hundred on Day Two, India’s star allrounder and player of the match settled in from the Adani end and tasted quick success. He induced an error from Campbell as he flicked the ball to Sai Sudharsan at forward short-leg.There is an unkind perception that Jadeja is a bad-wicket bowler and does not use subtlety. If you watched him set up Brandon King, you would be tempted to change your stance. He fed him a full ball to crunch it past deep cover for a four. The aggressive lunge, though, would have been spotted by the wily old fox.Next over, he bowled one slower but slightly shorter, and the batter over-committed on the front foot and had no way to adjust — the edge was smartly pouched by KL Rahul at slip.At 34/3, captain Roston Chase walked in, hoping to stem the rot. But Kuldeep Yadav’s wizardry proved too much for him. It was a classic setup — the left-arm wrist spinner pitched a couple of deliveries full while getting away drift. Two balls later, he got one to drift in, and Chase, playing for the incoming delivery, failed to spot the one that went straight and saw his off-stump pegged back.Jadeja then dismissed Shai Hope as the batter failed to ride the bounce and turn, and his attempted cut was smartly plucked by Yashasvi Jaiswal at point. At 46 for 5, West Indies seemed to be in danger of registering a sub-100 total. However, Alick Athanaze showed why coach Darren Sammy rates him as a decent player of spin. He employed a couple of wellexecuted reverse sweeps, and he and Jayden Seales batted well.",India crush West Indies by an innings and 140 runs on Day Three of the first Test at the Narendra Modi Stadium.

Ravindra Jadeja on India’s dominant win: 'Clarity in my role helps me pace my innings'

Ahmedabad: The Ahmedabad Test against the West Indies was the 86th of Ravindra Jadeja’s career and his 50th at home. Forty-nine of them were with R Ashwin , his great spinbowling partner, who retired last Dec in Brisbane. The innings and 140-run victory was also India’s first Test at home without Ashwin since the offspinner made his debut against the West Indies at the Kotla in New Delhi in Nov 2011.With Ashwin bowling from the other end, Jadeja took 238 of his 334 wickets. He must have felt a gap when he marked his run.“Obviously, we do miss him,” Jadeja said while addressing the media. “Ash has contributed so much to Indian cricket and has been a matchwinner for so many years. I was playing a Test in India without Ash for the first time, so sometimes I did find myself thinking, yeah, Ash will come on and bowl and then realised he isn’t there.”Jadeja, though, expressed confidence in the next line of Indian spinners, Kuldeep Yadav and Washington Sundar. “Kuldeep and Washy have already played so many matches, and we can’t call them youngsters, but it was a different combination.”Humour comes as easily to the gifted allrounder. In that unique Jamnagar accent, he asked, “Future me aap log bolenge, Jaddu bhi nahin hain, yeh sab to hota rahega.”‘I don’t post on social media to prove my fitness’While Jadeja is an exceptionally gifted batter and bowler, one of the great sights of watching him on the field is the way he moves to the ball, picks it up or gives chase, slides and gets up, all in one motion.That is why he has been such a stalwart across formats and one of the first picks in any Indian team since 2013.He is 36 years old and will turn 37 on Dec 6, but there is little sign of fatigue or slowing down. He was unlucky with a couple of injuries, though. “Injuries can happen anytime,” he said and added, “If you’re giving your 100% on the ground, you need to dive anytime or put in an effort for a catch or a run-out. Luckily, by God’s grace, I wasn’t injured that much, and I work a lot on my fitness. I don’t put up a lot of videos of what all I do on social media, but I do it. ”Jadeja is not a numbers man. Tell him that he will soon breathe rarefied air, and it could happen in the second Test at New Delhi, starting Oct 10, if he manages to reach 10 with the bat. He will be only the fourth member of an elite club to bag the double of 300 Test wickets and score 4000 Test runs. Ian Botham, Kapil Dev, and Daniel Vettori are on that list. If he ends his career with 1000 runs more or 70 wickets more, he will become only the second to cross the double of 5000 runs and 400 wickets.“ Abhi aap mereko pressure mey daal rahe hain ,” he said, evoking laughter in the press room.",Ravindra Jadeja took 238 of his 334 wickets with R Ashwin bowling from the other end. The innings and 140-run victory was also India’s first Test at home without Ashwin since the offspinner made his debut against the West Indies at the Kotla in Nov 2011.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124315402,imgsize-70774,width-400,resizemode-4/india-wins-cricket-test-vs-west-indies-by-an-innings-and-140-runs-to-take-series-lead.jpg"

BRIEF SCORES:

NAGPUR: Three hundred and twenty-two deliveries. Four and a half hours. In the grand scheme of red-ball cricket, it doesn’t sound like an eternity. Yet, for the Rest of India (RoI), it must have felt like slow suffocation — one dot ball at a time. On a humid afternoon at the VCA Jamtha, Vidarbha’s lower order endured blows and resisted temptations to slowly squeeze the life out of RoI’s hopes.By the time birthday boy Darshan Nalkande’s stubborn vigil ended minutes before the extended tea break on Day 4 of Irani Cup, Vidarbha had stretched their second innings to 232 — a total that swelled into significance when placed atop a 128-run first innings lead. The target of 361, on a weary surface with low bounce and dark clouds hovering, was always going to be challenging. Soon enough, RoI were gasping at 30 for two when rain finally intervened, leaving them still adrift.The morning had promised RoI a way back. Seamer Anshul Kamboj charged in with fresh legs, ripping through Vidarbha’s middle order with three wickets in a burst that gave the visitors a flicker of belief. Kamboj sent Danish Malewar, Rathod and Dhruv Shorey back in the hut. In just 30 minutes, Vidarbha had slipped from 96 for 2 to 105 for 5.That’s when the grit, embedded in Vidarbha’s cricketing DNA for the last few years, took over.Captain Akshay Wadkar, who has made a career out of turning grind into art, absorbed the blows that rained on his ribs and gloves. His 36 off 125 balls was an innings of defiance. With Harsh Dubey’s freewheeling 29 and Nalkande’s patient 92-ball 35, Wadkar helped Vidarbha reclaim the narrative. By the time the tail folded, RoI had spent more than half the day watching their chance slip further away in the Nagpur heat.When RoI began their chase, there was urgency in their stride. Already behind the eight-ball after conceding the first innings lead, they wanted to go for the kill. Abhimanyu Easwaran cracked consecutive boundaries in the opening over, and Aryan Juyal followed suit.For a brief moment, it looked like the chase was on. But then Aditya Thakare straightened one to shatter Juyal’s stumps, and Dubey’s arm ball rapped Easwaran plumb in front. The scoreboard read 24 for two, and the clouds rolled in to draw a curtain over RoI’s gloom. Had it not been for a couple of dropped chances, Vidarbha would have had the RoI openers back in the hut quite early.At stumps, captain Rajat Patidar and Ishan Kishan were clinging on, surviving close calls and referrals. With the pitch growing tired and the bowlers relentless, Vidarbha’s grip on a third Irani Cup title only tightened.Vidarbha 342 & 232 in 94.1 overs (Aman Mokhade 37, Akshay Wadkar 36, Darshan Nalkande 35; Anshul Kamboj 4/34, Gurnoor Brar 2/41) lead Rest of India: 214 and 30/2 in 12 overs (Ishan Kishan 5*, Rajat Patidar 2*) by 330 runs.",Vidarbha beat Rest of India by 330 runs on Day 4 of Irani Cup in Nagpur.

Rohit Sharma removed as India ODI captain, a glorious era comes to an end

Poll What do you think was Rohit Sharma's greatest contribution as captain? Tactical Acumen Nurturing Young Talent Winning ICC Trophies Team Morale Boost

NEW DELHI: Former India wicketkeeper-batter Dinesh Karthik on Saturday praised Rohit Sharma for his leadership, impact, and influence on the Indian cricket team during his tenure as ODI captain.“Rohit Sharma. Thank you so much. You were a phenomenal captain — tactically astute, but most importantly, very, very friendly and got along with everyone, making them feel so comfortable. But for me, the legacy that you've left as a captain… in those big moments, those big matches, you taught this current team what it takes to win,” Karthik said in a video he shared on Instagram.Karthik highlighted Rohit’s approach to leading from the front, particularly during high-pressure games. “At times we used to take a backward step, but you said, 'I think we need to press forward, put more pressure on the opponent, take more risks,' and you didn't leave it to anyone else. I think you started it with the bat—when in the big matches, you said, 'I'm going to go harder,' and that required skill. You got it done, and you did it consistently.Under Rohit’s leadership, India won 42 of 56 ODIs, maintaining a winning percentage of 76. His tenure saw India lift two ICC trophies in 2024 — the T20 World Cup and the Champions Trophy — and finish runner-up in the ODI World Cup at home in 2023. Karthik also emphasised Rohit’s contribution to nurturing young talent and building a resilient side. “Asia Cup unbeaten with a young team… You've left it in a better place than what it was when you started, and that's always a great sign of a leader. ”The Indian selectors on Saturday removed Rohit from ODI captaincy and handed over the reins to young Test skipper Shubman Gill ahead of the white-ball tour of Australia, keeping the 2027 World Cup in focus. Shreyas Iyer will serve as Gill’s deputy for the three-match ODI series starting October 19 in Sydney, Adelaide, and Melbourne, followed by a five-match T20 series.","Former India wicketkeeper-batter Dinesh Karthik praised Rohit Sharma for his leadership, impact, and influence on the Indian cricket team during his tenure as ODI captain.

MADRID: Vinicius Junior fired Real Madrid to the top of La Liga with a brace in a 3-1 win over Villarreal on Saturday, while Kylian Mbappe was also on target.Los Blancos moved two points clear of champions Barcelona, who visit Sevilla on Sunday, as they bounced back from last week's derby drubbing.Having returned from their long midweek trip to Kazakhstan, where they beat Kairat in the Champions League , Madrid turned their focus back to domestic matters.Thrashed 5-2 by city rivals Atletico Madrid last weekend, Xabi Alonso's side had plenty to prove against a strong Villarreal team, who are third.""I played very well and I want to continue like this, keeping this confidence and doing even more,"" Vinicius told Real Madrid TV.""We have good feelings... when we come back (from the international break) we have big games and we need confidence,"" added Vinicius.The winger did not start the season well but has found form in recent outings.""Vini had a very good game and he was decisive, I'm very happy for him,"" Alonso told reporters.Alonso brought Fede Valverde back into the team, playing him at right-back in the absence of injured duo Dani Carvajal and Trent Alexander-Arnold.Madrid had the better of a slow-paced first half at the Santiago Bernabeu.Teenage attacker Franco Mastantuono might have sent Los Blancos ahead but Villarreal defender Renato Veiga blocked his shot after Mbappe cut the ball back to him.At the other end, Thibaut Courtois saved superbly from Tani Oluwaseyi, who snuck in behind the centre-backs but could not beat Madrid's Belgian goalkeeper.Los Blancos took the lead early in the second half through Vinicius, whose shot took a fortunate deflection off Santi Comesana and flew past the helpless Arnau Tenas.Xabi Alonso brought on Jude Bellingham for the final 25 minutes, after benching him for the second game running following the Atletico debacle.Thomas Tuchel left the midfielder out of his England squad for upcoming World Cup qualifiers this week, and he was out to prove a point.Madrid doubled their lead when Rafa Marin brought down Vinicius in the area and the Brazilian beat Tenas from the spot. The former Barcelona goalkeeper could have stopped the penalty but the ball slipped under him.Alonso said that Mbappe is Madrid's main penalty taker but ""it was their decision"" to give Vinicius the ball.Vinicius wanted another penalty when Tenas appeared to bring him down in the box moments later, but his appeals were waved away.Bellingham twice came close but Tenas denied him on both occasions, with the midfielder kicking a post in frustration.Villarreal pulled a goal back through Georges Mikautadze, who finished lethally from the edge of the box, but Madrid quickly restored their two-goal cushion.Yellow Submarine defender Santiago Mourino was sent off for a second yellow card for a push on Vinicius as he charged down the wing, and soon Mbappe netted the third.Brahim Diaz teed up the French superstar to roll home his ninth league goal of the campaign, making him the division's top scorer.Mbappe was taken off grimacing in the final stages, in the only negative note for a Madrid side who were good value for their three points.""Kylian already had a little discomfort in his ankle, we will see how it goes,"" said Alonso, adding that the forward would still travel to join up with the French national team.Villarreal's Comesana complained about some of the refereeing decisions that went against his side.""It's a shame about the first goal which hit me, and then came the penalty, which wasn't enough (of a foul) to give it,"" Comesana told DAZN.""That hurt us a lot, you only have to look how he threw himself down... and the red card (was soft)... if it's already hard to win at the Bernabeu, with these things it's even harder.""","Real Madrid beat Villarreal 3-1 at the Santiago Bernabeu.

Poll Was Manchester United's win over Sunderland a turning point for their season? Yes, they'll improve No, still skeptical

Arsenal moved to the top of the Premier League table as Declan Rice came back to haunt his former club West Ham, while Manchester United gave manager Ruben Amorim some breathing space with a convincing 2-0 victory over Sunderland on Saturday.In Mikel Arteta ’s 300th match in charge, the Gunners proved too strong for West Ham at the Emirates Stadium, securing a 2-0 win that strengthened their bid for a first Premier League title in 22 years. Victory, however, came at a cost as captain Martin Odegaard was forced off injured before half-time for the third time this season. Arsenal’s squad depth, though, made light of the setback.“We dominated and fully deserved to win this,” Arteta said. “To go top of the table after some big fixtures over the last week and some injuries… we were able to respond.”Rice, who left West Ham in 2023 for a club-record £105 million ($141 million), ended the visitors’ resistance by blasting home on the rebound after Alphonse Areola parried Eberechi Eze’s shot. Bukayo Saka made the points safe from the penalty spot midway through the second half, marking his 200th Arsenal appearance after Jurrien Timber was brought down by El Hadji Malick Diouf.Arsenal now sit a point clear of Liverpool, who face Chelsea later. West Ham remain in the relegation zone.Meanwhile, Ruben Amorim breathed a sigh of relief as Manchester United eased pressure with a 2-0 win over Sunderland at Old Trafford. Mason Mount opened the scoring after eight minutes from Bryan Mbeumo’s cross, while Benjamin Sesko doubled the lead with a predatory finish from a long throw-in. Debutant goalkeeper Senne Lammens kept a clean sheet, and VAR overturned a late Sunderland penalty after insufficient contact by Sesko.Amorim said, “We were a competitive and adult team today. We need to do this kind of performance away as well — it’s our responsibility to play like this.”Tottenham also impressed with a 2-1 win over Leeds, ending their year-long unbeaten league run. Mohammed Kudus scored his first goal for Spurs after Mathys Tel had put the visitors ahead, with Noah Okafor briefly equalising.Liverpool can reclaim the top spot if they beat Chelsea later.",Arsenal beat West Ham 2-0 in Mikel Arteta's 300th match in charge.

Poll Do you agree with Tuchel's decision to leave Bellingham out of the squad for upcoming matches? Yes, it’s the right choice. No, he should be included.

England manager Thomas Tuchel has explained that Jude Bellingham’s absence from the squad for upcoming matches against Wales and Latvia is due to the midfielder’s “lack of rhythm” and not any personal issues.Bellingham, 22, missed England’s September victories over Andorra and Serbia following shoulder surgery and has since featured in only four matches for Real Madrid, starting just once.“He’s a very special player and for special players there can be special rules, I get this,” Tuchel said, referring to Bellingham, who was named England men’s player of the year for 2024/25 at the start of the month. “But for this camp we decided that we stick with our straightforward decision to invite the same team. That applies also for Jude, he deserves always to be in camp.”Tuchel added that Bellingham had been eager to play. “He wanted to be called up, we had a phone call, there was no issue from that side,” he said.The manager also addressed concerns about any friction with other notable absentees, Jack Grealish and Phil Foden, stressing: “No, there is also no problem between me and Phil Foden, there is also no problem with Jack Grealish.Very special players. There is no problem at all, there is no personal problem.”Arsenal forward Bukayo Saka returns to the squad after missing September’s internationals with a hamstring issue, while Cole Palmer, Noni Madueke, and Tino Livramento are ruled out through injury.England currently sit atop their World Cup qualifying group, having beaten Andorra 2-0 and Serbia 5-0 last month to record five wins from five matches. Tuchel emphasised the decision to maintain continuity in the squad, saying, “We decided to invite the same group of players to make more stable what we built on. Keep on pushing.”The upcoming double-header sees England face Wales at Wembley next Thursday, followed by a World Cup qualifier against Latvia in Riga five days later.",Jude Bellingham has been left out of England's squad for upcoming matches against Wales and Latvia.

A new chapter in football history is unfolding as Luca Zidane, son of French legend Zinedine Zidane , received his first call-up to the Algerian national team on Thursday. The 27-year-old goalkeeper, who previously represented France at youth levels, is now eligible to play for Algeria through his father’s family heritage, marking a significant “change of an era” in the Zidane legacy.FIFA officially approved Zidane’s switch in national allegiance just two weeks ago, clearing the way for him to represent the North African nation. Currently playing for Spanish second-division side Granada, Luca’s call-up comes at a critical juncture, with Algeria on the cusp of qualifying for the 2026 FIFA World Cup in North America.Algeria coach Vladimir Petkovic included Zidane in his 26-player squad for upcoming qualifying fixtures against Somalia on October 9 and Uganda on October 14. The Desert Foxes lead their group by four points, and a victory in either match would secure their spot in the tournament co-hosted by the United States, Canada, and Mexico.The Zidane name is already etched in World Cup history. Zinedine Zidane played in three editions for France, lifting the trophy in 1998 and experiencing heartbreak in 2006 after his infamous headbutt in the final against Italy. Now, Luca has the opportunity to make his mark on the international stage and continue his father’s storied legacy — this time with Algeria.With the 2026 World Cup approaching, Luca Zidane’s debut signals not just a personal milestone but a symbolic shift in football heritage.",Luca Zidane received his first call-up to the Algerian national team on Thursday.

What’s common between the three Formula E world champions

How the three World Champions fared in Formula E Season 11

Days after Oliver Rowland lifted his Formula E World Championship trophy in London this season, an interesting trend has come to the attention of Formula E and its fans. As a coincidence, all Formula E drivers who won the Mexico City E-Prix went on to win the Formula E World Championship that season, and this has been proved right for three consecutive years.Highlighting the same since 2023, a poster of three World Champions was shared on X by Formula E with the caption, “The trend continues. Each winner of the #MexicoCityEPrix from the past three seasons has gone on to become World Champion.”The special poster features 2023 Formula E World Champion Jake Dennis from Andretti, then TAG Heuer Porsche’s Pascal Wehrlein, who won in 2024, and the new World Champion, Nissan driver Oliver Rowland. All three of them won in the Mexico E-Prix and went on to lift the winner’s trophy in the Formula E World Championship that year.Oliver Rowland had strengthened his chances of winning the Formula E World Championship this year much earlier. He was leading the Formula E Driver Standings ever since he won Part 2 of the Jeddah E-Prix, which was his second win of the season after winning the Mexico E-Prix. In the last leg, the Nissan driver got nervous for a while as Pascal Wehrlein, who was following him in the number two position, closed the gap after grabbing quite a few podiums while Rowland had a dull period.Things became serious for Rowland when he failed to finish the Round 13 race in Berlin, while Wehrlein won second spot on the podium. But he eventually managed to confirm his championship in Berlin after four wins and three more podiums.Sharing about his bad race in Berlin, Rowland had said, “I was hoping before the weekend that the outcome could be [the World Championship], but after yesterday (Saturday) and this morning (Sunday), I was more worried that it might never come.”Also Read: Oliver Rowland reacts to daughter’s sweet radio message after Formula E Championship win: “It’s amazing” Things, however, changed for Wehrlein, who was pushed to third position after Nick Cassidy made a late entry in the Formula E Driver Standings by registering three consecutive wins.

Wehrlein registered one win and five more podiums this season.Meanwhile, Andretti driver Jake Dennis finished in seventh position in the Formula E Driver Standings.

Taylor Barnard on losing top three spot in Formula E World Championship

Fans hail Taylor Barnard for his fantastic rookie season

It was Taylor Barnard’s rookie season this year, and the NEOM McLaren driver put up a fantastic performance by temporarily making it to the top three in the Formula E Driver Standings by ousting the much more experienced Porsche driver Antonio Felix Da Costa.

Finishing P4 in the Drivers’ Championship and coming into the final weekend with a shot at runner-up is something to be proud of.”Also adding a note for teammate Sam Bird, as NEOM McLaren withdrew from Formula E after the end of the season, Barnard wrote, “@sambird_official it wasn’t the weekend you deserved either.You’ve been a huge part of my season both on and off the track, and I’m grateful for everything. You deserved more. To all the Papaya fans, thank you for the incredible support in our final race together. You always go above and beyond. ”Reacting to his post, a fan wrote, “An incredible debut season, huge congrats and excited to see where you go next!” Another said, “I know I said it the other day, but you’ve been incredible to watch this last year and a pleasure to support you in Papaya — there are many of us that can’t wait to support you in whatever you do next!” One more commented, “You were incredible all season around, Taylor.

We couldn’t have done it without you all — your trust and support have never been taken for granted,” he added.Praising the two McLaren drivers, he wrote, “Sam clinched McLaren’s first-ever fully electric win at the São Paulo E-Prix in Season 10, pulling off one of Formula E’s all-time great overtakes, before being waved across the line by none other than Emerson Fittipaldi – McLaren's first Formula 1 World Champion. While Taylor has been a rookie sensation in Season 11, securing five Formula E records, including the youngest driver to start a race, the youngest points scorer, the youngest driver to lead a lap, the youngest podium finisher, and the youngest polesitter. ”He ended the letter saying, “Some of us have been together since the day we first launched this team, while others have seamlessly fitted in along the way and flourished within the environment we have cultivated. For many, I am sure that we will cross paths again soon, but whatever the future holds for those here at Bicester, whatever path they choose to follow, I have no doubt that it will be bright.

From a mental health perspective, I feel a lot lighter, like a weight has come off my shoulders. It’s not something we drivers talk about very often, but the last few days have been a huge release of emotion and energy. It feels great. Even now, when I watch the videos back, I struggle to believe it’s actually done!”Nato had also shared a few pictures of himself and the Nissan team on Instagram after the end of the Formula E season.

How do Formula E and ABB work together?

What do ABB and Formula E say about the partnership?

After a successful Season 11, ABB and Formula E have announced that they will continue their partnership in the upcoming season. This gives ABB another opportunity to promote its new brand positioning via the ABB FIA Formula E World Championship, along with technologies that help industries take a cleaner route.Over a period of eight seasons, the partnership with Formula E has provided ABB a platform to showcase how technology can help industries outrun challenges, engage with customers around the world, and implement its own solutions into the series to improve reliability and efficiency. The partnership extension will provide a year-round opportunity for brand-building and activation, communicating ABB and its technology solutions to new global audiences, including Formula E’s international fanbase.ABB and Formula E will also join hands to engage a new generation of fans, collaborating with unexpected influencers and content creators to tell compelling stories that make advanced electrification and automation technologies tangible and exciting.The end of the mid-race car swap, a 150kW increase in power, top speeds that are 43 percent higher, and energy recovery increasing from 15 to 50 percent indicate how far Formula E technology has come to outperform on track.ABB has also built on its technical involvement in the series, supplying the race chargers from Season 9, and introducing its ABB Ability OPTIMAX® energy management software (Season 9) and Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) technology (Season 5) to the sport.ABB Head of Brand Paco Liebrand said, “We are pleased to be continuing our partnership with Formula E which, like ABB, is striving for a leaner and cleaner future. The synergy between the two organizations, combined with the global appeal of the Championship, makes it a great platform to promote our brand positioning.”He further said, “Formula E is increasingly working with content creators, influencers, and celebrities, with initiatives such as the Evo Sessions making an impact through digital channels beyond the racing itself, which is also an essential part of ABB’s new brand strategy. Going forward, we will be enhancing the way we harness the benefits of this collaboration, ensuring the focus is on delivering content and activations that reinforce our new messaging, build familiarity, and tell the ‘Engineered to Outrun’ story. ”Formula E Chief Revenue Officer Tiziana Di Gioia said, “Our renewed partnership with ABB is a testament to the commercial power and benefit of Formula E as a global platform that drives both brand and business growth. ABB, like our wider partnership portfolio, has and continues to see enormous value in collaborating with the fastest-growing motorsport on the planet, with viewership, commercial integration, and brand storytelling continuing to accelerate. Over eight seasons, ABB has moved from brand visibility to brand activation—integrating deeply into the fan experience, the sport’s ecosystem, and our innovation narrative.Also Read: Antonio Felix Da Costa shares happy memories as Porsche wins Formula E Teams and Manufacturers’ World Championships “This next chapter elevates the partnership even further. With ABB’s new positioning, we are co-creating opportunities across content, digital storytelling, and market engagement, transforming a title partnership into a year-round, value-generating relationship. It’s a model of how modern sponsorships should evolve, rooted in purpose and cultural alignment but measured by impact,” she added.Formula E Season 12 will begin with testing in Valencia in October.","ABB and Formula E have announced that they will continue their partnership in the upcoming season.

World number one Carlos Alcaraz won his eighth title of a sensational season after beating American Taylor Fritz 6-4, 6-4 in the Japan Open final on Tuesday. The Spaniard has struggled with an ankle injury this week in Tokyo but he was still too hot for the rest of the competition to handle, including world number five Fritz.The US Open champion gave another breathtaking display of power and athleticism to lift the trophy in his first appearance in Japan.He clinched victory with a cleverly disguised drop shot before strolling to the net to give Fritz a warm embrace.""First time in Tokyo, first title here, hopefully not the last one,"" said the 22-year-old.Alcaraz injured his ankle in his opening match in Tokyo as he ran for a shot, crumpling to the ground and sitting on the court for about five minutes.He returned to play with heavy strapping on his ankle and admitted that the injury had been on his mind throughout the tournament.""The start of the week was not really good with the ankle, and the way that I came back from that, playing a great tournament and great matches, I'm just really happy about it,"" he said.It was the Spaniard's ninth straight final and his 10th of the season overall.No man since his legendary countryman Rafael Nadal in 2017 had reached 10 finals in a season.The win gave Alcaraz a measure of revenge after losing to Fritz for the first time at the Laver Cup in San Francisco two weeks ago.Alcaraz was not happy with the umpire in the final, telling him ""you've never played tennis in your life"" during a rant between games.He squandered several chances to break Fritz in the first set but he made the breakthrough in the ninth game.That left the Spaniard serving for the set, and he sealed the deal when Fritz dumped a return into the net.Alcaraz kept his foot on the gas and broke his opponent to start the second set.He broke him again to take a 4-1 lead and continued to punish Fritz with a series of brutal forehands.Fritz hit back for his first break of the match but it was too little, too late as Alcaraz clinched the championship on his next service game.""It's been a pleasure to be able to play here in Tokyo in front of the Japanese fans,"" said Alcaraz.""I enjoyed every single second from when I stepped on the court, less the five minutes that I was on the floor with my ankle.""The rest of the tournament, I enjoyed every single second.""Fritz was looking to capture his third title of the season after wins at Stuttgart and Eastbourne.The American won the Japan Open title in 2022.Both Alcaraz and Fritz are in the draw for the Shanghai Masters this week.",Carlos Alcaraz beats Taylor Fritz in Japan Open final.

WATCH:

Coco Gauff staged a remarkable comeback to beat Belinda Bencic 4-6, 7-6 (7/4), 6-2 in a tense China Open round of 16 clash on Tuesday, a match remembered as much for a fiery on-court outburst as for elite-level tennis.The drama unfolded during a changeover in the second set, with Bencic accusing Gauff’s team of deliberately disrupting her focus.“When I’m going to the line ready to serve, they don’t need to cheer,” the Swiss star complained to the chair umpire. The 25-year-old continued, snapping at Gauff herself: “No one’s talking to you. She’s talking to me, okay! I’m too old for these mind games!”Gauff, just a few feet away, tried to interject, but Bencic’s sharp rebuke dominated the confrontation. The tense exchange was captured in a video that quickly went viral, illustrating the psychological intensity of elite tennis.The incident appeared to affect Bencic more than Gauff. After dropping the first set and trailing in the second, Gauff regrouped, winning a tight tiebreak as Bencic double-faulted on set point and hurled her racquet in frustration. The American teenager carried that momentum into the decider, breaking early and racing to a 6-2 victory.“It was a tough match,” Gauff said post-game. “I had chances in the first to close it out, but I’m happy with how I fought. She was really aggressive.”The win not only secured Gauff a spot in the China Open quarter-finals but also confirmed her qualification for the WTA Finals in Riyadh this November. She will next face either Germany’s Eva Lys or fellow American McCartney Kessler.","Coco Gauff beats Belinda Bencic 4-6, 7-6 (7/4), 6-2 in China Open round of 16 clash.

Croatian tennis legend Nikola Pilic, the pioneering coach who trained Novak Djokovic and the only captain to lead three countries to Davis Cup glory, has died at the age of 86, the Croatian Tennis Association announced on Tuesday. Pilic passed away on Monday in the western Croatian town of Opatija.Born in Split in 1939, Pilic began representing the Yugoslav youth national team just four years after starting tennis. He went on to dominate national competitions, winning five Yugoslav singles titles, seven doubles crowns, and one mixed doubles championship. His greatest achievement on the court came in 1973 when he finished runner-up at the French Open to Ilie Nastase. He also claimed the US Open doubles title in 1970 alongside Pierre Barthes.Pilic was already a prominent figure when tennis turned professional in 1968, becoming one of the first eight men, dubbed the “Handsome Eight,” to sign with Lamar Hunt’s World Championship Tennis tour. He reached a career-high singles ranking of No. 6 and won nine singles titles along the way.Off the court, Pilic’s influence was even greater. After retiring in 1978, he enjoyed a distinguished coaching career, leading Germany to Davis Cup triumphs in 1988, 1989, and 1993, guiding Croatia to victory in 2005, and serving as an adviser when Serbia won in 2010.His academy near Munich nurtured future stars including Michael Stich, Goran Ivanisevic, and Novak Djokovic, who affectionately called Pilic his “tennis dad.” In 1999, Djokovic’s first coach Jelena Gencic sent the young player to train under Pilic, shaping the foundation for his 24 Grand Slam titles.“Nikola Niki Pilic will be remembered as the only captain ever to lead three different nations to Davis Cup titles,” the Croatian Tennis Association said.

Taylor Fritz held off Alexander Zverev 6-3, 7-6 (7/4) to seal Team World's triumph in the Laver Cup on Sunday as two wins for Carlos Alcaraz on the final day proved too little for Team Europe.Fritz fired a backhand volley winner on his first match point to give Team World a 15-9 victory over Europe in the global tennis event, sparking jubilant celebrations from his teammates and World captain Andre Agassi at Chase Center -- home of the NBA's Golden State Warriors.""The energy from the team, it just feels the moments of winning feel so much better, the moments of losing feel so much worse because you're doing it for all these guys,"" Fritz said.""It just fires me up so much,"" added the fifth-ranked American, who had beaten Alcaraz on Saturday when Team World swept all four matches to seize a 9-3 lead.Fritz had raced through the opening set against a weary-looking Zverev.The German stepped it up in the second set, but he was down a break and trailing 4-3 before he finally mustered his first break points of the night.He converted his third to level the set at 4-4 to the delight of his Europe teammates and captain Yannick Noah.A quick hold from Zverev left Fritz serving to stay in the set.He held to love and they battled to the tiebreaker, where Fritz took a 3-0 lead only for Zverev to win three straight points before Fritz won four of the final five.Alcaraz, fresh off his sixth Grand Slam title at the US Open, had kept Europe's title defense alive with a blistering 6-2, 6-1 victory over Argentina's Francisco Cerundolo.Alcaraz and Casper Ruud had sliced Europe's deficit with a 7-6 (7/4), 6-1 doubles victory over Reilly Opelka and Alex Michelsen to open Sunday's action.But Australian world number eight Alex De Minaur then beat Czech Jakub Mensik 6-3, 6-4 to push Team World's lead to 12-6, with 13 points needed to claim the Cup and each match on Sunday worth three points.De Minaur, a late replacement on Team World for Frances Tiafoe, had nabbed two wins on Saturday -- beating Zverev in singles and coming through again in doubles.Team World regained the title they surrendered to Europe last year in Berlin.Europe have won five of eight editions of the event co-created by Swiss great Roger Federer , which will be held in London next year.Ruud def.

SHENZHEN: Jasmine Paolini beat Jessica Pegula on the fourth match point as defending champion Italy won the Billie Jean King Cup with a comprehensive victory over the United States on Sunday.Italy won both singles ties in straight sets, meaning there was no need for a decisive doubles match. The No. 8-ranked Paolini beat seventh-ranked Pegula 6-4, 6-2 after No. 91 Elisabetta Cocciaretto won 6-4, 6-4 against Emma Navarro, breaking her serve three times.Paolini broke Pegula's serve with a two-hand backhand down the line to take the first set and move Italy closer to success at the Shenzhen Bay Sports Center Arena in China.But with Paolini serving for the match at 5-1 she wavered a little. Pegula saved three match points and then two unforced errors from Paolini allowed Pegula to break back to 5-2 down.A strong looping forehand gave Paolini - the runner-up at the French Open and Wimbledon last year - a fourth match point and she took it, clinching victory when Pegula's two-handed backhand clipped the net and landed wide.Paolini raised her arms in the air, then walked over to hug her teammates.All the staff members joined them on the court as they danced in a circle before celebrating with blue-shirted, flag-waving Italy fans.Pegula and Navarro each came from a set down to defeat Britain and reach the final.But not this time.Italy boasted a doubles pairing of Olympic champions Paolini and Sara Errani, who also won the French Open doubles together this year. They would have faced Pegula and top-ranked doubles player Taylor Townsend in what might have been an exciting trophy decider.The BJK Cup was formerly known as the Fed Cup, and the United States is the most successful team as an 18-time winner, but not since 2017.Italy was contesting its third straight final and clinched its sixth title.

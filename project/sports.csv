Indian men's and women's cricket teams met King Charles III at St. James's Palace in London on Tuesday, where the monarch displayed remarkable knowledge about the players' personal lives and recent matches. The meeting was attended by team captains Shubman Gill and Harmanpreet Kaur , along with team members, coaching staff, and BCCI officials.BCCI Vice President Rajeev Shukla expressed his delight at the historic meeting, noting King Charles's detailed knowledge about the players and their personal lives.""It was a very historic occasion that both our men's and women's teams were invited today by King Charles and met them very well in the Palace. Players are very happy because he asked all personal details of each player. He asked Saikia ji and me about whether Arun Jaitley is my friend, what happened to him, and when I told him that he had died, he asked me to pay condolences to his family. He also asked about Akash Deep's sister's illness,"" Shukla said.Shukla further emphasised the King's humility and knowledge of cricket, particularly regarding the third Test at Lord's.""He had found out so many details. He sounded like a gentleman, and it did not seem we were talking to the King of England.There is a lot of humility in him and team is very happy to meet him,"" Shukla added.The BCCI Vice President also addressed the performance of young captain Shubman Gill and the absence of veterans Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli.""Even he noticed this fact. If we had another regular batter on the field, then we could have won easily. Our team has proven that our experiment is well done, as part of which we have sent a new team because we are looking forward to the future. The team has proven itself to be a fighter unit. We almost won here. We did well at Leeds. Our team is competing with England equally and will win the series as two matches are since left,"" he explained.During the meeting, Shukla gifted one of his books, titled 'Scars of 1947: Real Partition Stories' to the King. The book is a collection of firsthand accounts from the survivors of the partition in 1947.During the meeting, King Charles discussed the final moments of the third Test with Gill, specifically mentioning Mohammed Siraj's unfortunate dismissal.Gill shared his experience of the meeting with reporters: ""It was amazing. I think he was very kind and generous to be able to call us here, and it was a pleasure meeting the king, and we had some really good conversations.""The Indian captain elaborated on his conversation with the King: ""Yes, he did tell us that the way our last batsman got out was quite unfortunate. The ball was rolling on the stumps, and he was just asking us how we felt after that, and we told him it was an unfortunate match for us. It could have gone either way, but hopefully we will have better luck in the next games.""The Indian teams also met British actor Idris Elba before their royal encounter. Elba expressed his modest connection to cricket: ""I'd say I'm a fan, but I don't follow cricket as well as I should. I was just a little bowler, that's all.""Women's team captain Harmanpreet Kaur shared her experience of meeting the King: ""Uh, it was a very nice experience. Uh, we came to England so many times, but this was our first time when we met him, and he was very friendly. He asked us, like, how the travel was and all, and, um, it was really nice to meet him.""She added: ""Definitely, we have been playing good cricket, and I think with that we are getting a lot of opportunity to express ourselves, so really happy the way things are moving on.""Women's team head coach Amol Muzumdar expressed his gratitude for the opportunity: ""It has been a very humbling experience coming here to the royal house and meeting the king. It's been the first time, so we came all the way from Southampton, but it was really worth it, and the girls were really excited about this visit, and we are pleased that we are here.""The men's team is currently in England for a five-match Test series, while the women's team recently secured a historic 3-2 T20I series victory over England and is preparing for an upcoming three-match ODI series starting in Southampton.King Charles also interacted with other team members including vice-captain Rishabh Pant, Jasprit Bumrah, Yashasvi Jaiswal, KL Rahul, Ravindra Jadeja, and head coach Gautam Gambhir.

Inside Lord's: Exclusive Stadium Tour & Must-Do Experiences

Poll How do you feel about India's chances in the final two Tests of the series? Confident they'll win. Nervous about their performance.

India fell to England in the 3rd Test of the five-match series after a hard-fought battle at Lord's. While the defeat means that India have now dropped to 2-1 behind the hosts in the series, it makes the penultimate Test a must-win affair for Shubman Gill and his men. However, spirits in the Indian camp were sky high ahead of the second innings after the hosts were bowled out for 192.India star Washington Sundar , who played an impressive part in India's efforts to bowl out England in the second innings in particular, was extremely confident of securing the win. In conversation with the media, the 25-year-old even went on the record to state that India 'will' win. This elicited a sharp reaction from England batter and former captain Jos Buttler . Speaking in the ""For The Love Of Cricket "" podcast alongside Stuart Broad, the Englishman argued that Sundar must have gotten his words wrong.""I heard it and then I thought, has he actually said that?"" said Buttler. He was referring to a clip where the young player told the media that 'It's going to be amazing when we win the game and go 2-1 up in this series. ""I wonder if he's just got his words out wrong,"" said Buttler.Buttler also said that Sundar's comments were made with such confidence that showing that clip to the hosts ahead of the final day would have been enough to get them fired up and charged to win the game on Monday.He proceeded to claim that Sundar must have regretted his words immediately after the interview. Broad however, backed Sundar, saying that his extremely confident words were most probably owed to fatigue and confusion after the day's play.In the end, Sundar and the rest of his teammates were forced to admit defeat on Monday as England pulled off a stunning victory on Day 5. The hosts successfully managed to restrict India to 170 despite a marathon effort from Ravindra Jadeja. Sundar ended up going out for a duck in the second innings as Jofra Archer claimed his wicket.",Jos Buttler believes that Washington Sundar must have gotten his words wrong.

India vs England: India fall short at Lord’s, England lead series 2-1

Shubman Gill blames 'judgement error' as Rishabh Pant run-out haunts India in Lord’s heartbreak

It was close to midnight, and the overhead train line was about to reach Northwick Park Station — my final destination. The match had ended at Lord's a few hours earlier, and after a quick bite and a lot of walking near Tower Bridge with my colleagues covering the Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy, everyone dispersed in their respective directions.My stretch didn't overlap with anyone, so I covered the last leg of the journey home alone — just like I had the past week in London. Northwick Park Station wears a deserted look during the midnight hours, but I had never felt anything suspicious over the past week. Monday night, however, turned out to be different.Right after leaving the station, I took the exit towards my accommodation at Lulworth Avenue and continued to hum my favourite songs. It felt like business as usual before I took the immediate turn from the station and saw five men, in their 20s, approaching me. Right from their body language to how they covered half their faces with balaclavas — nothing felt right about that moment.I froze instantly because I had a lot of expensive equipment on me: a laptop, two cell phones, and personal belongings. Two of the five started walking towards me while the other three continued walking to the station to keep a watch on the road.The scene felt straight out of a Bollywood movie in the residential neighbourhood, which wasn't generously lit.I was immediately reminded of my travelling colleagues being ill-treated and abused by drunk hooligans before the day's play began. And here I was, at the heart of it, alone, in the wee hours of the night.The first reaction was to take a few steps back, and that’s when one of them charged aggressively and said, ""Calm down, bro. We just want to talk."" Of course, this was hardly the moment to remain calm because I knew what was next. The very next second, the second guy asked me for the camera because I was carrying a bulky tripod in my hand.When they didn't get the ideal response from me, one of them implored me to remove the smartwatch from my left wrist. It was then that I started yelling as adrenaline and panic took over. As one of the masked men reached for a knife in his jacket, I gave the tripod a wild swing, and they took a few steps back.In that split moment, I started running for my life — quite literally — and yelled the choicest expletives in Punjabi, hoping someone from the nearby houses would come for help. While none of that happened, one guy chased me for 50m — which felt much longer — before he took a U-turn as the next neighbourhood was better lit.Still shaken, the first thing I did was call my wife, who was deep in sleep because it was close to 5am IST. But I needed to hear a familiar voice then, and when I regained composure, the next call went to my colleagues with whom I was sharing the accommodation.In a split second, they rushed to my location, calmed me down, and together we walked home. I was still in a state of shock because it was a narrow escape from a mugging — or worse.Numerous thoughts circled in my head. What if they had managed to get the knife out? Materialistically, what if they had taken my valuables — some personal and some official? What if they had gotten away with my passport as well?The thoughts kept crossing my mind, but in that moment I looked at my tripod and smiled. I had cursed it the moment I took the flight to England because it had cost me Rs. 9,000 in excess baggage charges due to the size. Yet, here I was. On my last day in London, that piece of metal saved my life, equipment, and belongings.","Sahil Malhotra was attacked in London on Monday night.

RCB’s IPL Celebration Ends in Tragedy: Stampede Kills 11, Leaves Dozens Injured | WATCH

Poll Should the Karnataka government make the stampede report public? Yes, transparency is essential. No, it should remain confidential.

The Karnataka High Court has directed the state government to make public its status report on the tragic stampede that occurred outside M Chinnaswamy Stadium during Royal Challengers Bengaluru's (RCB) IPL victory celebrations.The incident, which happened after RCB won their maiden IPL title, led to the death of 11 people and left over 50 injured. The government had asked for the report to remain confidential, but the court said there were “no legal grounds” to keep it private. It added that the report contained only “facts as perceived” by the government.The court also asked the government to share the report with all parties involved in the case, including the RCB franchise, Karnataka State Cricket Association (KSCA), and DNA Entertainment Networks, RCB’s event partner.RCB is currently waiting for more clarity from the CID probe. Both the franchise and DNA officials have given their testimonies in the past month. A date for the final judgement has not been announced yet.On July 1, the Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT) made some strong observations about the crowd that gathered outside the stadium. The tribunal noted that RCB’s social media posts inviting fans to join the parade after their June 3 win over Punjab Kings (PBKS) drew an estimated 3 to 5 lakh people.The CAT was asked to investigate after Bengaluru (West) IG and Additional Commissioner of Police Vikash Kumar filed a complaint following his dismissal. Chief Minister Siddaramaiah had removed Vikash and four other officers, blaming them for “substantial dereliction of duty” and not taking proper steps to control the crowd.The tribunal said the RCB franchise did not seek key regulatory permissions and had “created a nuisance.” These comments were made in a 29-page order issued by CAT.RCB’s Chief Marketing Officer Nikhil Sosale, who was arrested and later granted bail, has not commented since. The franchise had announced plans to start an ‘RCB Cares’ fund to help those affected by the stampede, but there has been no update since June 4 — the day the tragedy occurred.","The Karnataka High Court has directed the state government to make public its status report on the tragic stampede that occurred during Royal Challengers Bengaluru's IPL victory celebrations.

'Pretty cooked': Ben Stokes after leading England to Epic Lord’s triumph

I believe in another saying: ‘When you are winning, that is when you should try to improve your team.’""The 27-year-old has already played 57 Tests for England and is averaging 30.89.""How many more chances is Crawley going to get? He has learned nothing in his 57 Tests,"" he said.""A waft in the first innings, caught behind, and a front-foot drive in the second innings to a wide sucker ball, caught at gully.""It was just a replay of too many of his dismissals.Time to go. Five hundreds and an average of 31 is not good enough.""Boycott said the Australian troika of Pat Cummins, Mitchell Starc, and Josh Hazlewood will be waiting for Crawley to play in the Ashes, and it is not a good sign for the England team.""Most opposition bowlers can’t wait to get their sweaters off to bowl at him.

Poll What do you think is the main reason for West Indies' poor performance against Australia? Lack of experienced players Coaching and strategy issues Pressure of expectations

West Indies were handed a humiliating loss to Australia in the third Test of the three-match series. Australia pacer Mitchell Starc took 6 wickets for just 9 runs as the West Indies made the second-lowest score in Test history, suffering a humiliating 176-run defeat at Sabina Park on Monday. Former West Indies Test and ODI captain Carl Hooper expressed his distress in the current state the West Indies cricket team finds itself in following the result. The humiliating defeat elicited sharp reactions and criticism from the cricket community - fans and pundits alike.Expressing his sorrow and frustration, the legendary figure said, ""It's been so disappointing. I'm angry, I'm upset, you know, because I think we were building a good thing a few years ago. And then we had wholesale changes. And to see this as the end result is like what we've done for the last two, three years in trying to build something has just sort of gone up in flames today.""Responding to what his message for the devastated side would be, Hooper said, ""We were building something under the former head coach, Andre Coley. Then we removed him and brought in Daren Sammy, who was our white-ball coach. He’s now the all-format coach.And now, you sort of take one step forward and then, I think, two steps backward. Where do you go from here? We've got India coming up in a couple of months — a three-Test series — it's going to be tough. """"So it's not as if you can see some light at the end of the tunnel. We don't have a few easy oppositions; it's going to be tough. So you just have to pick yourself up, dust yourself off, and try to get ready for India,"" Hooper told abc sport. His message for the West Indies side is a stark reminder that the road ahead is certainly not going to be smooth.On questions of whether the head coach has to be held accountable for the regrettable result, the former player did not offer much clarity. ""Somebody's got to be answerable. I think he also is the only selector, so just imagine someone who is picking the Australian team and is also the head coach — he's got all the power, so he's got to be held accountable. I know that's not going to happen, you're not going to remove him. When are we going to see Australia again on our shores, or our West Indies team on these shores, the way the financial model works? I don't know. I mean, you now want to host India and England, so where does West Indies cricket go from here? I don't know,"" said Hooper, as he stated the sorry state of affairs the team currently finds itself in.","West Indies suffered a humiliating 176-run defeat to Australia in the third Test.

Shubman Gill blames 'judgement error' as Rishabh Pant run-out haunts India in Lord’s heartbreak

Poll In your opinion, was the review system applied fairly in the Lord's Test? Yes, it was fair No, it was biased

Fact check: Does Paul Reiffel have an anti-India bias?

India vs England: India fall short at Lord’s, England lead series 2-1

'Pretty cooked': Ben Stokes after leading England to Epic Lord’s triumph

In total, of the 11 dismissals that were put to on-field umpire Reiffel and subsequently reviewed, seven came out in India's favour.

India cricketers R Ashwin and Anil Kumble has raised concerns about umpire Paul Reiffel 's decision-making during the Lord's Test between England and India, suggesting potential bias in his decisions against India.During the fourth day's play, several controversial decisions led to heated discussions. A notable incident involved Joe Root being given not out by Reiffel to a Mohammed Siraj delivery, which replays showed would have clipped leg stump. Another contentious moment occurred when Indian captain Shubman Gill was given out caught behind off Brydon Carse, a decision later overturned on review.""My experience with Paul Reiffel... You need to talk to him. You need to set him up. I am not saying that you ask him to give it out. But he has this thing... whenever India bowl, he feels it's not out, whenever India bat, he feels it's out. If this is happening not just against India but against every team, then the ICC needs to look at the umpiring,"" Ashwin stated on his YouTube channel Ash Ki Baat.Referring to the Gill decision, Ashwin commented: ""See this.I have a sedan. That can go through the gap between the bat and ball here. When I saw this the first time, I felt it was not out.""Ashwin further elaborated on his concerns about Reiffel's decision-making patterns: ""But this wasn't the first time (a wrong decision was given). My dad was watching the match with me and he was saying, 'If Paul Reiffel is there, we won't win.' Whenever Paul Reiffel is umpiring, decisions go against India. When we are bowling, umpire's call is usually not out. When we are batting, there's no umpire's call (in our favour). There's something there. My dad says whenever he is umpiring, India lose.""Anil Kumble shared his perspective on the umpiring after one of Siraj's deliveries trapped Joe Root in front of the stumps. Upon review, the ball was shown to be hitting the stumps but the umpire's call rule came into effect.""It seems Paul Reiffel has decided that it is not going to be out. Anything close, not out,"" said the legendary leg-spinner.The match saw 11 decisions being reviewed when former Australia seamer Reiffel was the umpire.With England batting, India took two reviews, one was overturned while the other remained as is on umpire's call. During India's turn to bat, India's review was overturned while England's stayed not out as they chased a wicket.During the second innings of the Test, India took four reviews with three coming out unsuccessful, including one as umpire's call. Only one decision came out in India's favour. As India chased the win, they were successful in overturning one of two reviews they took. England, meanwhile, suffered the frustration of umpire's call on a not out call.England could celebrate only four times after a review.Statistical analysis of Reiffel's umpiring record in matches involving India presents a different picture. In 39 international matches across formats where Reiffel has officiated, India have won 23 matches, maintaining a win percentage of 58.97%.The DRS statistics show that out of 21 ""umpire's call"" verdicts in reviews against Reiffel's decisions, 11 have favoured India, representing 52.38% of such calls. In Test matches specifically, 14 out of 21 successful reviews against Reiffel's decisions have been in India's favour.","R Ashwin and Anil Kumble have raised concerns about umpire Paul Reiffel's decision-making during the Lord's Test between England and India.

NEW DELHI: India pacer Mohammed Siraj broke his silence following the gut-wrenching loss at Lord’s in the third Test, sharing an emotional post on social media. While he impressed with the ball—taking four wickets across both innings—it was his determined effort with the bat that stood out during India’s dramatic final stand.Siraj partnered with Ravindra Jadeja in a gritty 10th-wicket effort that stretched beyond the Tea break on Day 5, offering India a glimmer of hope in their 193-run chase. The fast bowler faced 30 deliveries and scored 4 runs in a valiant 23-run stand with Jadeja, whose unbeaten 61 nearly took India home.The resistance ended in heartbreaking fashion when a Shoaib Bashir delivery ricocheted off Siraj’s bat and trickled back onto the stumps, ending India’s innings 22 runs short at 170 and bringing England a dramatic victory.The following day, Siraj shared a poignant Instagram post with five images—two showing the immediate aftermath of his dismissal, his disappointment evident as the weight of the loss settled in. His caption read: “Some matches stay with you, not for the outcome, but for what they teach.”The five-day clash was a gripping display of Test cricket. After England resumed at 58/4, their pace attack tightened the screws and reduced India to eight wickets down before lunch.But Jadeja stood firm, crafting a valiant 61* from 181 balls, holding the innings together.Despite his resolve and some resistance from the lower order, India’s hopes were dashed when Siraj fell in the 75th over—his misfortune triggering England's ecstatic celebrations. The match ended with India being bowled out for 170 in 74.5 overs, 22 runs shy of a miraculous win. Ben Stokes and Jofra Archer were England’s standout bowlers with three wickets each, while Brydon Carse picked up two. Chris Woakes and Shoaib Bashir, who bowled despite a finger injury, took one apiece. England’s perseverance proved decisive on a day that coincided with the six-year anniversary of their 2019 ODI World Cup triumph at Lord’s.Both teams had earlier posted identical first-innings scores of 387, before England managed 192 in their second innings. In the high-pressure final session, Jadeja and Siraj rotated the strike and defended doggedly, inching closer to the target.But Bashir’s clever spin undid Siraj—his bat deflected the ball onto the stumps, bringing England a series lead of 2-1 and leaving India to reflect on what could have been.","Mohammed Siraj breaks his silence following India's loss at Lord's.

NEW DELHI: Following India’s narrow loss at Lord’s in the third Test against England, former India captain Sourav Ganguly shared his views on the defeat, pointing out the missed opportunity despite the batting depth in the side. He also lauded Ravindra Jadeja for his resilient knock, backed by tailenders Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Siraj in a tense finish.India suffered one of their most heartbreaking Test defeats in recent times, going down by 22 runs and falling 1-2 behind in the five-match series. Chasing 193, India were in deep trouble at 82/7 before Jadeja launched a fightback with help from Nitish Kumar Reddy, Bumrah, and Siraj. The last two batters faced a combined 84 deliveries but could only add nine runs. Siraj was eventually bowled in unfortunate fashion, ending India’s spirited chase.Speaking during a press event of the 2025 season Indian Racing Festival (IRF) Driver Draft, Ganguly admitted he was “a little bit disappointed” with India’s batting, given their performances earlier in the series.""They should have got this 190, and when you saw Jadeja guts it out and fight and score the runs, the batting quality in this team is absolutely brilliant, and I think they will be more disappointed than I am because it was an opportunity to get 2-1 up in the series against England.Two more matches to go. I am sure they have left disappointed not getting 190. Especially with the quality of batsmanship there is in the dressing room. ""Ganguly added that even a small contribution from the top-order could have made the difference in India’s favour.""Sad from a team's point of view, but Jadeja has been exceptional. He is going to continue to play for India as long as he bats and performs like this. He has been around for a long time. Almost 80 Test matches and more than 200 one-day games.""""And now you can see if batting, bowling, fielding, you know, he's a special player and his batting has really improved over the years with experience and quality. He was actually a top-order batsmen for Saurashtra in his younger days and then became a left-arm spinner. So he has a special player and is a very important part of this team,"" he concluded.During the match, Jadeja also crossed a significant milestone by completing 7,000 international runs. In 361 appearances for India, he has scored 7,018 runs at an average of 33.41, including four centuries and 39 fifties in 302 innings, with a highest score of 175*.In Test cricket, Jadeja has scored 3,697 runs in 83 matches at an average of 36.97, including four hundreds and 26 fifties. His top score of 175* came in this format, which remains his most productive with the bat. So far in this series, he has scored 327 runs in six innings at a staggering average of 109.00, with four fifties and a top score of 89. He is currently the fifth-highest run-scorer in the series.",India lost the third Test against England by 22 runs at Lord's. Sourav Ganguly said he was 'a little bit disappointed' with India's batting. The former India captain praised Ravindra Jadeja for his resilient knock. Ganguly added that even a small contribution from the top-order could have made the difference in India's favour.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122522234,imgsize-50502,width-400,resizemode-4/122522234.jpg"

'Pretty cooked': Ben Stokes after leading England to Epic Lord’s triumph

Poll Do you think England can maintain their lead in the series? Yes, they have the momentum No, India will bounce back

England, coming into the 3rd Test at Lord's after a defeat to the visitors at Edgbaston, turned around the odds in style as they won the match by 22 runs. While both sides were bowled out for 387 in their first innings, England found themselves in trouble after the Indian bowling attack worked brilliantly to end their second innings at 192.With the odds falling in India's favour, England needed to respond adequately on the final day. With the visitors reduced to 58/4 by stumps on Day 4, it was Jofra Archer that made headlines once again as play resumed on Day 5. It was the 30-year-old that claimed the crucial wickets of Rishabh Pant and Washington Sundar on Monday, that too, in his first spell of the day, handing England the upper hand.Reacting to Archer's return and why the captain put all his trust on the pacer who was back from a long spell of injuries, skipper Ben Stokes revelaed his motivation behind the same. ""There was a bit of discussion in the dressing room around letting him (Brydon Carse) keep going, but in my gut, because of the day six years ago—we won that World Cup, Jofra played a massive moment in that—I just thought it was set up for him to do something that Jofra does,"" Stokes told BBC Sport.Carse, who shocked Indian batters at the end of Day 4 with the crucial wickets of Karun Nair and Shubman Gill paved the way in subduing India's charge to the 193 target set by England.""That Rishabh Pant wicket was awesome. The caught-and-bowled, obviously—those two wickets in that first spell he bowled really blew the game open for us. Sometimes the gut works,"" said the skipper with a subtle laugh, reacting to his decision that ultimately paved the way for a thrilling England win.With the series tipping 2-1 in England's favour, the 4th Test at Old Trafford Cricket Ground starting July 23 becomes a must-win affair for Shubman Gill and his men. The 5th and final Test will be played at The Oval in London.",England beat India by 22 runs in the 3rd Test at Lord's. Jofra Archer took crucial wickets of Rishabh Pant and Washington Sundar. Captain Ben Stokes said he trusted Archer because of World Cup win in 2010.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122483988,imgsize-153840,width-400,resizemode-4/122483988.jpg"

India vs England: India fall short at Lord’s, England lead series 2-1

Shubman Gill blames 'judgement error' as Rishabh Pant run-out haunts India in Lord’s heartbreak

NEW DELHI: Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ) Vice President Rajeev Shukla expressed his happiness after both the Indian men’s and women’s cricket teams met King Charles III, saying the monarch “had done his homework” and even enquired about personal details of the players — including pacer Akash Deep’s sister’s battle with cancer.King Charles III hosted the two Indian teams at St. James’s Palace in London on Tuesday. Present at the event were India men’s captain Shubman Gill , women’s captain Harmanpreet Kaur, team members, and coaching staff.Speaking to ANI, Shukla said, ""It was a very historic occasion that both our men's and women's teams were invited today by King Charles and met them very well in the Palace. Players are very happy because he asked all personal details of each player. He asked Saikia ji (BCCI secretary Devajit Saikia) and me about whether Arun Jaitley is my friend, what happened to him, and when I told him that he had died, he asked me to pay condolences to his family. He also asked about Akash Deep's sister's illness.""""He had found out so many details. He sounded like a gentleman, and it did not seem we were talking to the King of England. There is a lot of humility in him and team is very happy to meet him,"" he added.Shukla further revealed that King Charles also discussed the thrilling third Test at Lord’s, calling Mohammed Siraj’s dismissal “unfortunate,” as the ball spun back onto the stumps after being middled. That moment ended India’s late resistance in their chase of 193, resulting in a 22-run loss.""Even he noticed this fact. If we had another regular batter on the field, then we could have won easily. Our team has proven that our experiment is well done (to send a young team), as part of which we have sent a new team because we are looking forward to the future. The team has proven itself to be a fighter unit. We almost won here. We did well at Leeds. Our team is competing with England equally and will win the series as two matches are since left,"" he added.Commenting on Shubman Gill's leadership, Shukla praised the young captain for answering critics with both leadership and runs.""He has also proven himself with the bat. A century, then a double century and a century, what could be better than this?"" added the BCCI Vice President.On the absence of senior players Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli, who retired from Tests before the series, Shukla said their decision was personal and respected by the board.""They have retired themselves. We will always miss them, they are both great batsmen and the good thing for us is that they are available for ODIs,"" he concluded.Also present at the gathering were BCCI Vice President Rajeev Shukla and India's High Commissioner to the UK, Vikram Doraiswami. While the men’s team is currently engaged in the five-Test series in England, the women’s team recently clinched a historic 3-2 T20I series win and will now play three ODIs starting Wednesday in Southampton.During the meeting, King Charles had a brief chat with Shubman Gill, where the two discussed the dramatic ending of the third Test. Referring to Siraj’s dismissal, the King remarked on the misfortune of the ball rolling back to hit the stumps. Gill responded, “It’s a game of cricket.”Charles also shared a light-hearted moment with vice-captain Rishabh Pant and pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah, laughing together during their conversation. He later interacted with the rest of the squad, including Yashasvi Jaiswal, KL Rahul, Ravindra Jadeja, and head coach Gautam Gambhir. Following that, he spent time with the Indian women’s team as well.Before meeting the King, the Indian contingent also had an informal interaction with British actor and musician Idris Elba. Speaking with Gill, Bumrah, and Pant, Elba said, “I'd say I'm a fan, but I don't follow cricket as well as I should. I was just a little bowler, that's all.” He later also spoke to members of the women’s team.After the group photos, King Charles also spoke with India quick Prasidh Krishna and batter Karun Nair, and met uncapped left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh.Gill described the experience of meeting King Charles as a memorable one: “It was amazing. I think he was very kind and generous to be able to call us here, and it was a pleasure meeting the king, and we had some really good conversations.”He also spoke about the King’s reference to the dramatic final moments of the Lord’s Test: “Yes, he did tell us that the way our last batsman got out was quite unfortunate. The ball was rolling on the stumps, and he was just asking us how we felt after that, and we told him it was an unfortunate match for us. It could have gone either way, but hopefully we will have better luck in the next games.""Harmanpreet Kaur also shared her thoughts, saying, ""Uh, it was a very nice experience. Uh, we came to England so many times, but this was our first time when we met him, and he was very friendly. He asked us, like, how the travel was and all, and, um, it was really nice to meet him.""""Definitely, we have been playing good cricket, and I think with that we are getting a lot of opportunity to express ourselves, so really happy the way things are moving on,"" she added.Women’s team head coach Amol Muzumdar also reflected on the moment, saying, ""It has been a very humbling experience coming here to the royal house and meeting the king. It's been the first time, so we came all the way from Southampton, but it was really worth it, and the girls were really excited about this visit, and we are pleased that we are here.""",King Charles III hosted the two Indian teams at St. James’s Palace in London on Tuesday.

Poll Do you think India's lower-order batting has improved in recent Tests? Yes, definitely No, it remains the same

Shubman Gill blames 'judgement error' as Rishabh Pant run-out haunts India in Lord’s heartbreak

NEW DELHI: Former India batter Sanjay Manjrekar believes that KL Rahul’s form in the Test series against England stands out as the biggest positive for the visitors so far. Rahul has scored 375 runs in six innings during the series, including two centuries and a half-century, underlining his consistency at the top of the order.""The biggest satisfaction I’ve had - as an analyst and a former cricketer - has come from watching KL Rahul. He has always had the game. Yes, there were grey areas in his technique, but he worked on those and resolved them. What was missing was consistency. On one of our shows, we even jokingly gave him the title of ‘Mr. Consistent KL Rahul’ - but it’s taken him a long time to truly earn that tag.""He has now played over 50 Test matches for India, and what I’m seeing now is close to perfection - there are no visible weaknesses. For the first time in an overseas series, he has scored more than 200 runs. That, for me, is a massive takeaway for India,"" Manjrekar said on JioHotstar.Reflecting on India’s narrow 22-run loss at Lord’s, Manjrekar also spoke about the crucial ninth-wicket partnership between Ravindra Jadeja and Jasprit Bumrah that gave India hope on the final day.“Ravindra Jadeja was batting well and defending resolutely, but it never looked like he was taking the kind of risks needed to help India win.He was playing a waiting game and hoping against hope. The real star in that partnership, though, was Jasprit Bumrah. He stayed out there for one hour and 40 minutes against high-quality fast bowling, facing bouncers, and it was remarkable to see how his net sessions with the bat finally paid off. The mental toughness we see in his bowling came through in his batting too, and that was truly special,"" he said.Manjrekar also praised Jadeja’s improved temperament and technique with the bat, pointing to his evolution as a dependable lower-order batter.""It’s heartening to see how much Jadeja trusts his defence these days. He plays long innings now, patient and with time on his side. The 70 runs he scored in the first innings were not a quick-fire 70 - he batted for four hours. And on this pitch, scoring 50 felt like batting for 50 hours. But if you look at that moment when Jadeja brought up his half-century, the visuals from the Lord’s balcony did not look too positive. The energy from the dressing room said it all, it felt like the team knew that winning would be very difficult. Jadeja was trying, no doubt, but given the pitch, the conditions, and India’s scoring rate, the chase looked beyond reach,"" Manjrekar added on Jadeja’s gritty knock.He also lauded Bumrah’s adaptability and game awareness across both innings, saying the fast bowler continues to add to his legacy in different ways.""In the first innings, Bumrah showed just how great a bowler he is. This was the kind of pitch where he could not really display his full range, so he bowled patiently and waited for opportunities. And when the moment came - in the latter half of the innings - he was ready. He picked up five wickets in the first innings on a surface that did not offer much assistance. Then, when Washington Sundar took four key wickets and India needed to wrap up England quickly, Bumrah stepped in again and delivered. That yorker to dismiss Brydon Carse is still fresh in the mind. Showing his greatness in different ways - that has become Bumrah’s legacy,"" the former batter said.","Former India batter Sanjay Manjrekar believes that KL Rahul's form in the Test series against England stands out as the biggest positive for the visitors so far. Rahul has scored 375 runs in six innings during the series, including two centuries and a half-century, underlining his consistency at the top of the order.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122510823,imgsize-63252,width-400,resizemode-4/122510823.jpg"

Barcelona's rising star Lamine Yamal is under investigation by Spain's Ministry of Social Rights following complaints about the presence of entertainers with dwarfism at his 18th birthday celebration last weekend in Olivella, approximately 50 kilometers west of Barcelona.The investigation was initiated after the Association for People with Achondroplasia and Other Skeletal Dysplasias with Dwarfism (ADEE) filed a formal complaint about the party, which took place on July 13.The event was attended by Yamal's teammates and music celebrities, including Bizarrap and Bad Gyal, though guests were prohibited from filming during the celebration.""The ADEE has filed a complaint, so this ministry has asked the prosecutor's office to investigate to see if the law has been violated and, therefore, the rights of people with disabilities,"" stated Spain's Ministry of Social Rights to AFP.ADEE condemned the hiring of people with dwarfism for entertainment, stating it ""perpetuates stereotypes, fuels discrimination, and undermines the image and rights"" of people with disabilities.One of the performers, speaking anonymously to Catalan radio station RAC1, defended their participation at the event. ""No one disrespected us, we were allowed to work in peace,"" the performer said, confirming there were four of them present.""We're normal people who dedicate ourselves to what we love doing in an absolutely legal way...

Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos, son of Portuguese superstar and Al-Nassr forward Cristiano Ronaldo is among the most exciting talents to look out for in world football. Primarily operating as a left-winger like his father, he can also be deployed on the right wing. He is a right-footed player.Born on June 17, 2010, the 15-year-old, who is coming up in terms of both footballing ability and popularity, recently went viral for a claim that Barcelona star Lamine Yamal 'has not won anything' in his career yet. While he did admit that Yamal is better than his father in terms of ability at the moment, he did argue Yamal's lack of trophies is a caveat.From playing for the youth teams of Juventus, Manchester United and now Al-Nassr, the teenager has more or less mirrored his father's career trajectory, albeit for their academies, U15 and youth teams. Here's a closer look at the young star's career trajectory.Cristiano Jr. followed in the footsteps of his father as he made the move from Spanish giant Al-Nassr to Juventus following the latter's move from the 15-time Champions League winners in July 2018. After starting his career with the U9 side, he rose up the ranks to U11 by the time he left them in 2021/22.The young star created excitement in his first season with Juventus, where he reportedly scored 58 goals and assisted 18 times in a season as a 9-year-old.Cristiano Jr. also scored four goals in his debut for the U9 side, as per reports.As Ronaldo made the move from Juventus and returned to Manchester United, his son also followed suit. Playing for the Red Devils in their U12 and then U13 sides, the teenager got to share the pitch with the likes of Kai Rooney, son of the legendary Wayne Rooney.The teenager wore the No 7 like his father while with the Red Devils' team, with clips of him imitating his father's iconic 'siuuu' celebration also going viral.After Ronaldo left the Premier League giants in late 2022, he made the surprising call to move his career to the Saudi Pro League with Al-Nassr. The Portuguese superstar is under contract with the team till 2027, and his son too, plays for their U15 side.He signed for the Al-Nassr U15 team on 1st January 2023.Despite having both Portuguese and US citizenship, Cristiano Jr. has opted to represent Portugal at national level. The player was called up to represent the Portuguese U15 side back in May 2025, for which he made 4 appearances, scoring two goals.The forward represented his country at the Vlatko Markovic Tournament in Croatia in May. With the forward already in the national team setup, his 40-year-old father has already expressed his desire to share the pitch with his son one day.","Cristiano Ronaldo Jr. is the son of Portuguese superstar and Al-Nassr forward Cristiano Ronaldo. The 15-year-old has played for the youth teams of Juventus, Manchester United and now the Saudi Pro League side.

Jorge Jesus has been named the new head coach of Saudi Arabian club Al Nassr, replacing Stefano Pioli. The Portuguese coach said he joined the team after an invitation from star man Cristiano Ronaldo “Without his invitation, I certainly wouldn't be there. The motivation will be great. I'm going to try to ensure that Al Nassr, which is one of the best clubs in Saudi Arabia, can win titles. Cristiano Ronaldo is a player who has always won everything he's played for. He hasn't won in Saudi Arabia yet. I'll see if I can help him,” Jesus told reporters, as quoted by IANS.Jesus had earlier managed Al Nassr’s rivals Al Hilal SFC for two seasons. He left the club after their AFC Champions League Elite 2024/25 semi-final exit. However, he enjoyed success during his time there, winning the Saudi Pro League, King’s Cup, and Saudi Super Cup in the 2023/24 season.The 70-year-old has also coached major clubs like Benfica and Sporting CP in Portugal, and Flamengo in Brazil.At Al Nassr, Jesus will work with Ronaldo, who recently extended his contract with the club until 2027.

Barcelona star Lamine Yamal, who recently turned 18, has come under an intense wave of criticism following reports that the player hired people with dwarfism to act as entertainers for his birthday party. The Barcelona man, who is yet to make a statement on the same, has returned to Barcelona for pre-season ahead of the 2025/26 campaign.One of the entertainers hired for Yamal’s party has defended the event after criticism from a disability rights group. The birthday celebration of the Barcelona star included a Dominican rapper, a mafia-themed dress code, and entertainers with dwarfism, from which the last sparked a strong reaction from the Association of People with Achondroplasia and Other Bone Dysplasias (ADEE).ADEE called the act degrading and has vowed to take ""legal and social"" action against the organisers, as per an official statement on the ADEE website. However, one of the performers at the party has pushed back, saying they were treated with respect and had every right to do their job.“No one disrespected us, let us work in peace. I don't understand why there's so much hype,” the entertainer told RAC1. “We're normal people who do what we want, in an absolutely legal way.”The artist also criticised the association for trying to limit job options for people with dwarfism. “(ADEE) is humiliating people with dwarfism. For a couple of years now, these people have been harming us; they want to ban a job that we like, and in no case have they offered jobs or courses to the affected people,” he told RAC1.“We work as entertainers. Why can't we do it? Because of our physical condition?”He also said that the current backlash has more to do with ADEE’s internal politics than the event itself. “There is a new president who feels self-conscious and wants to screw us others. We know what our limit is and we will never exceed it: we are not fairground monkeys,” he said.Describing what they did at the party, the artist said they danced, served drinks, and performed magic. “There are many types of shows,” he added. “Afterwards, we joined the rest of the party like everyone else. The only reason there’s backlash is because it was Lamine Yamal’s party.”","Barcelona star Lamine Yamal hired people with dwarfism for his birthday party.

The 2025 Club World Cup has come to a close, with Premier League side Chelsea being crowned champions. The side led by Enzo Maresca comprehensively beat opponents Paris Saint-Germain in the final, 3-0, thanks to a sensational first 45 minutes. In the opening half, goals from Cole Palmer and João Pedro ensured that the Parisians could not stage a comeback in the second half. While Chelsea held on to their lead and even managed to keep a clean sheet, tensions boiled over at the end.A red card for PSG star João Neves and several yellow cards handed out in the final moments ultimately culminated in an intense brawl on the pitch at full-time. At the final whistle, both sides got into a heated argument, as push came to shove. However, one particular incident stood out, as PSG boss Luis Enrique appeared to come to blows with Chelsea forward and goalscorer João Pedro.Viral clips on social media from the incident show players and staff from both sides getting into a tussle. Enrique appears to make contact with Pedro’s face and push him to the turf, as several Chelsea stars swarmed the manager. Chelsea coach Enzo Maresca is also seen running towards the brawl to intervene.The Italian was promptly taken aside by PSG goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma, while Enrique was held back by Presnel Kimpembe.The incident lasted well over a minute, with more than 20 players and staff involved. Following the game, Enrique issued a clarification on his actions, stressing that they weren't intentional.""My clear intention was to separate the players so the situation wouldn't escalate,"" said the Spaniard in a post-match press conference.PSG were on a sensational run of games—winning the UEFA Champions League 5-0 over Inter, beating the likes of Inter Miami and Real Madrid 4-0 at the Club World Cup, and defeating Bayern Munich 2-0 en route to the final on Sunday. However, it was Maresca and Chelsea who prevailed at the MetLife Stadium in New Jersey.With the win, Chelsea have pocketed a total close to $129.5 million as prize money.","Chelsea beat Paris Saint-Germain 3-0 in the FIFA Club World Cup final.

Poll Should PSG reconsider their strategy after this loss? Yes, major changes needed No, they just had a bad game Only minor adjustments required

Chelsea secured a decisive 3-0 victory against Paris Saint-Germain in the expanded Club World Cup final at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey on Sunday, with Cole Palmer scoring twice and assisting João Pedro for another goal in a dominant first-half performance.Palmer netted two similar left-footed goals from inside the penalty area in the 22nd and 30th minutes, showcasing his impressive form this season with 18 goals total. He then provided a precise through pass to João Pedro, who chipped the ball over goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma in the 43rd minute.The match drew a tournament-high crowd of 81,188, including U.S. President Donald Trump, who faced boos during the postgame awards ceremony before presenting the trophy alongside FIFA president Gianni Infantino to Chelsea captain Reece James.The victory marked Chelsea's second Club World Cup title, following their 2021 triumph when the tournament featured seven teams. The Blues earned between $128,435,000 and $153,815,000 in prize money, with the final amount depending on FIFA's undisclosed participation fee.PSG's hopes for a quadruple were dashed, having previously won Ligue 1, the Coupe de France, and their first Champions League title. The defeat marked their worst loss since a 4-1 Champions League setback against Newcastle in October 2023.The game's turning point came in the 22nd minute when goalkeeper Robert Sánchez's long kick was mishandled by Nuno Mendes. Malo Gusto's subsequent shot was blocked by Lucas Beraldo before Palmer capitalized on the rebound.Tensions escalated late in the match when João Neves received a red card in the 84th minute for pulling Marc Cucurella's hair. The game concluded with a confrontation involving PSG coach Luis Enrique and Donnarumma pushing João Pedro near the center circle.""It's a great feeling. Even better because obviously everyone doubted us before the game. The gaffer put a great gameplan out and obviously, he knew where the space was going to be,"" Palmer said after the match.PSG coach Luis Enrique acknowledged Chelsea's superiority through a translator: ""They had a lot of energy. I believe they were actually better than we were.""Chelsea, who finished fourth in the Premier League and won the UEFA Conference League, demonstrated superior energy throughout the match, benefiting from an extra day of rest following their semifinal compared to PSG.PSG entered the match as heavy favorites, having outscored opponents 16-1 in previous matches, but struggled to maintain their defensive record, which had included 436 minutes without conceding before Palmer's opening goal.Palmer, who joined Chelsea from Manchester City two years ago at age 23, continued his exceptional season with another stellar performance. His second goal came from a well-timed run onto Levi Colwill's long ball, followed by a skillful cut inside before finishing.The match featured six yellow cards in addition to the red card, reflecting the intense nature of the competition between these European powerhouses.","Chelsea defeated Paris Saint-Germain 3-0 in the Club World Cup final on Sunday.

Nick Cassidy shares joyful podium moments from Berlin E-Prix

Nick Cassidy belted out Taylor Swift’s Love Story with his teammates after securing his first win of the season in Shanghai. He followed it up with a second victory in Berlin on Sunday, but the Jaguar TCS Racing driver was quick to shift the spotlight to Nissan’s Oliver Rowland, who nearly stole the show by clinching the Formula E Drivers’ Championship with a fourth-place finish. Cassidy has now opened up about his win at the Berlin E-Prix Part 2 — a double triumph for Jaguar after his teammate Mitch Evans won Part 1 on Saturday.Sharing his feelings after the end of the Berlin E-Prix, Nick Cassidy said: “What an awesome race. Firstly, to be honest, I don’t want to take the moment from Oli [Rowland] and the Nissan guys — World Champions with a whole weekend to spare is an incredible achievement. Well done to Oliver, he’s been a class act all year.”Speaking about the team and his race car, he added, “My guys called it perfectly. We had a really good car in the race. We kind of knew we screwed up in qualifying, and I was a bit upset about that, but the car during the race was fantastic—it was awesome. That’s three wins here now. This place didn’t used to be kind to me, but it’s become an amazing venue for me over the years, so it's really cool to have won here for three consecutive years.We’ve been improving all season—it’s no secret that Jaguar is back. The future for the team is very bright. They’re going to keep getting better, and I think that’s been obvious over the past few weekends. I had a fantastic car.”Nick Cassidy posted several pictures from his Berlin celebration on Instagram. Alongside images of him popping champagne on the podium, the 30-year-old captioned the post: “Yesssss! P1 in Berlin!! What a team effort. @jaguarracing.”Jaguar Racing responded in the comments: “That’s how it’s done, Cass.” Sergio Sette Camara, who raced for Nissan in place of Norman Nato, added several clapping emojis. One fan commented, “Massive congratulations!! That was another master-Cass, and I cannot wait to see you do a repeat in London — but from further ahead on the grid.” Another fan praised the team’s weekend sweep, writing, “Congratulations, Nick.

Whenever I get into this car, I leave with a smile on my face. ”American F2 race winner Jak Crawford also made a notable rookie return, claiming third place in the morning session while driving for Andretti. Sharing his thoughts, he said, “It was a great day testing in Berlin. I feel like we really got the opportunity to try a lot of setup items and gain a solid understanding of everything.

Hopefully, the work pays off and the team can deliver a strong result in London.”Abbi Pulling, one of the women drivers in the Berlin Rookie Test, drove for Nissan. She looked content with the day’s progress and said, “It was a great day—very productive—and we achieved everything the team needed.

Pascal Wehrlein clinches podium in Berlin Round 13

Pascal Wehrlein fights to secure his position in Formula E Driver Standings

It was a special day for German driver Pascal Wehrlein at his home race, the Berlin E-Prix, on Saturday. Despite facing a three-place grid penalty, the TAG Heuer Porsche driver delivered a stellar performance to reach the podium. Wehrlein, driving car No. 94, finished second in Round 13 at the Tempelhof Airport Circuit and celebrated the moment with his daughter on stage.Pascal Wehrlein secured his fifth podium of the season at the Berlin E-Prix on Saturday, overcoming a grid penalty received for colliding with teammate Antonio Felix Da Costa during FP1 on Friday.

He captioned it: “I promised you a trophy. P2 at our first home race of the season. Grateful to have family and friends here to share the moment. Let’s go again tomorrow.”The achievement was even sweeter as it helped Wehrlein close the gap with championship leader Oliver Rowland to just 50 points.

Finishing second is a good result, but we had a small taste of the victory. I think pace-wise, we were the quickest, so I tried really hard and it was close in the end. I think we can be happy with today, good points for the team, good points for the championship. Every race is all-in and we try to maximise every one. ”His second-place finish also gave a crucial boost to TAG Heuer Porsche in the Teams’ and Manufacturers’ Championship.Following Sunday’s race, where Pascal Wehrlein failed to score and Oliver Rowland picked up 12 points, Wehrlein remains second in the Formula E Drivers’ Standings with 125 points. While he can no longer catch Rowland, he will need a strong finish in the remaining rounds to protect his position.

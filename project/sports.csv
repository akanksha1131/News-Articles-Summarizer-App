NEW DELHI: Former India batter Mohammad Kaif has offered a sharp, experience-driven explanation on why Virat Kohli has consistently stayed ahead of Rohit Sharma in ODI cricket, placing the spotlight firmly on Kohli’s mindset and ability to turn starts into match-winning contributions.Kaif’s comments came ahead of the second ODI between India and New Zealand on Wednesday, following Kohli’s decisive role in India’s four-wicket win in the series opener.“Virat Kohli converts starts. A score of 30 or 40 means he will stay till the end, win the match, and, if he gets into form, become consistent,” Kaif said on his YouTube channel. “That is why, in ODI cricket, Virat Kohli has always been ahead of Rohit Sharma. He consistently scores runs and plays big innings.”Kaif also pointed to Kohli’s intensity and self-awareness as a key differentiator, highlighting a moment from the first ODI itself. “You can see it when Virat Kohli got out in the first ODI; he was shaking his head, clearly thinking he played a wrong shot,” he noted, underlining the former captain’s relentless standards even after impactful knocks.Kohli was named Player of the Match in the first ODI for his fluent 93 off 91 balls, an innings that anchored India’s chase of 301 in Vadodara. That knock also kept alive an extraordinary personal streak. The 37-year-old has now registered five successive fifty-plus scores in ODIs, a run that began against Australia in Sydney and continued against New Zealand.Another half-century in the second ODI would see Kohli move past Sachin Tendulkar , Rahul Dravid , Rohit Sharma and Ajinkya Rahane to become the first Indian batter with six successive fifty-plus ODI scores.",Former India batter Mohammad Kaif says Virat Kohli is ahead of Rohit Sharma in ODI cricket.

Poll Do you think Ayush Badoni is capable of filling Sundar's shoes during the ODI series? Definitely Probably Unlikely

VADODARA: In a major blow to India — with the T20 World Cup at home less than a month away — off-spinning allrounder Washington Sundar was on Monday ruled out of the remaining two matches of the ongoing ODI series against New Zealand after sustaining a rib injury during the first game on Sunday.Sundar has been replaced in the squad by Delhi batter Ayush Badoni, who has received his maiden India call-up.“Sundar reported an acute onset of discomfort in his left lower rib area while bowling during the first ODI. He will undergo further scans, following which the BCCI medical team will seek expert opinion. Washington has been ruled out of the remaining two matches of the ODI series,” the BCCI stated in a release.Badoni, who was part of Delhi’s squad for the ongoing Vijay Hazare Trophy knockouts, will join the Indian team ahead of the second ODI in Rajkot on Jan 14. The 26-year-old has been a consistent performer in domestic cricket and a regular face for India ‘A’ and Lucknow Super Giants (LSG). He was also part of the three-match one-day series against South Africa ‘A’ and Australia ‘A’ in Rajkot and Kanpur in Sept–Oct last year.In 27 List A matches, Badoni, who generally bats at No. 5 or 6, has scored 693 runs at an average of over 36. He also offers handy off-spin, having picked up 18 wickets at 29.72 and an economy rate of 4.54.“A key reason why Badoni has been brought in is his offspin, which could be useful given New Zealand have three left-handers — Devon Conway, Henry Nicholls and Michael Bracewell — in their batting line-up,” a source close to the developments said.Hampered by the injury, Sundar bowled just five overs for 27 runs during New Zealand’s innings and did not return to the field thereafter. He later came out to bat at No. 8 after Harshit Rana was promoted ahead of him. The left-hander was visibly struggling between the wickets but chipped in with an unbeaten seven, adding an unbroken 27-run stand with KL Rahul for the seventh wicket to take India home in a tense chase.The reliable but injury-prone allrounder is likely to miss the five-match T20I series against the Kiwis as well, which begins on Jan 21 in Nagpur, and will be racing against time to recover for the T20 World Cup next month, for which he has been named in India’s squad.",Washington Sundar ruled out of the remaining two matches of the ongoing ODI series against New Zealand.

Poll Which player do you believe is more crucial for India's ODI squad? Ravindra Jadeja Axar Patel Both equally

Opportunities on the bench

RAJKOT: It’s festive season in Ravindra Jadeja ’s hometown. The markets are teeming with locals preparing for Sankranti and the kite festival on Wednesday, the day of the second ODI. For Jadeja, though, it’s a different kind of hustle: holding on to the spot of India’s premier ODI spin-bowling allrounder ahead of Axar Patel Jadeja has been a constant during the optional training sessions on match eve. On Tuesday, his usual carefree demeanour took a back seat. He batted in the nets for close to an hour before bowling an extended spell. With the 2027 ODI World Cup about 20 months away, there is pressure on him to reestablish his credentials.TOI understands Axar Patel is currently the preferred choice for that tournament. He isn’t playing the ongoing ODI series because the selectors, it is learnt, want to preserve him for the upcoming T20I series in the lead-up to the T20 World Cup next month. Effectively, Jadeja is on trial to stay relevant in India’s ODI scheme of things. It’s also part of a wider plan: building a pool of backups for each position for 2027.The team management leans towards having a lefthanded batter in the middle order and also someone from the top order who can offer a few steady overs. That brought Ayush Badoni into the picture once Washington Sundar was injured in Vadodara on Sunday.If KL Rahul continues as the No. 1 wicketkeeper-batter over Rishabh Pant, it eventually becomes a shootout between Jadeja and Axar for the No.5 slot. Of late, Jadeja’s diminishing power-hitting hasn’t escaped the discerning eye.Axar’s rapid evolution as a batter had prompted the team management to push him up the order in the Champions Trophy when Jadeja was also in the XI on slow, turning pitches. Since the World Cup is slated to be played on South Africa’s pacier, bouncier pitches, there may be little scope to fit in both, with Hardik Pandya likely to come in and bat at No. 7.Batting coach Sitanshu Kotak refused to comment on where Jadeja stands in his white-ball career. Jadeja, though, couldn’t have asked for a better venue to regain his attacking touch than Rajkot.Kotak, however, asserted that Yashasvi Jaiswal and Ruturaj Gaikwad played in the last ODI series against South Africa only because Shubman Gill and Shreyas Iyer were not available. “The positive is that both of them got hundreds. But they will have to wait for their opportunities,” he said.There’s an underlying concern in the ranks: the decreasing number of ODIs played every year. As per the current schedule, India have only about 25 ODIs left before the World Cup. Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli play only one format and KL Rahul too is dependent on the format to keep his white-ball career going.“It’s very hard to convince the likes of Rohit, Kohli and Rahul to sit out. They will always argue that they get to play far and few between to build a rhythm. Prior to the home ODI season, it was discussed that Pant and Rahul will be rotated. Pant could have got a look-in this series if he didn’t get injured,” sources close to TOI said.“There are a lot of changes in the playing conditions for the ODI World Cup. Hopefully, we will get more ODIs after this T20 World Cup,” Kotak said.","Jadeja is on trial to stay relevant in India’s ODI scheme of things.

India vs New Zealand: 'Ravindra Jadeja needs to look at his form or...'

NEW DELHI: Ahead of the second ODI against India on Wednesday, New Zealand batter Henry Nicholls spoke about how important this series is for his team as they start preparing for the ICC ODI World Cup 2027.Speaking at the pre-match press conference, Nicholls said that ODI cricket is now played less often between major tournaments. Because of that, every bilateral series has become more valuable.“I think there's not as much one-day cricket between major events. I think that makes these series even more important. You know, certainly for us as a group, it's an exciting format,” Nicholls told reporters.Nicholls said some New Zealand players have stayed connected to the 50-over format by playing List A cricket at home. That has helped them stay ready. He added that the team enjoys playing ODIs and wants to make full use of every chance they get.“A few of us have been playing some of the List A cricket back home, so we have got a bit of the 50-over format under our belt, but it's a format that we enjoy playing… we're certainly looking to make the most of these opportunities as a team,” Nicholls added.The 34-year-old also spoke about the challenge of facing Indian greats Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma . He said playing against such players is always a learning experience.“Any time you play, you're going to learn from players like that, and that's a challenge that we knew coming into the series.”Nicholls praised New Zealand’s bowlers for the way they tried to handle both batters in the first ODI. He felt the team showed improvement as the match went on.“But also to see in the first game… the way the guys adapted, certainly from a bowling point of view… I think we saw a little bit of that towards the end of the match,” he further stated.He added that building pressure against top players on Indian pitches will remain a key challenge for the team going forward.India won the first ODI by four wickets to take a 1-0 lead in the three-match series. Chasing a target of 301, India were guided by captain Shubman Gill ’s 56, Virat Kohli’s 93 and Shreyas Iyer’s 49.

A journey without shortcuts

The rule that closed doors

A first that arrived quietly

The price of independence

More than one man’s story

NEW DELHI: “Age is just a number.” That is often dismissed as a cliché, but is that true for Indian cricket too, where the system is built on youth and fast-track success?Fairy tales usually begin in teenage years, peak in the early twenties and fade soon after.But Pravin Tambe ’s story does not fit that template. In fact, it tears it apart.No India cap. No age-group cricket. No Ranji Trophy appearances. And yet, Tambe managed to do something no Indian male cricketer before him had done, play in a foreign T20 league, bypassing the Board of Control for Cricket ( BCCI ) in India’s long-standing diktat.By the time Tambe made his Indian Premier League (IPL) debut in 2013, he was already 41.For most cricketers, that is an age associated with farewell speeches and coaching badges. For Tambe, it was the start of a career few could have imagined.Born in Mumbai, Tambe spent decades in the city’s competitive club circuit. He bowled on dusty maidans, travelled for local tournaments and waited for a call that never came. Mumbai’s Ranji Trophy side remained out of reach. So did age-group teams and national selectors.In a cricket ecosystem obsessed with pathways, Tambe had none.Then came an unexpected lifeline. Rajasthan Royals, led by Rahul Dravid, spotted something others had missed.In 2013, they handed Tambe an IPL contract. The leg-spinner announced himself in dramatic fashion, claiming a hat-trick on debut against Delhi Daredevils, the first ever by an IPL debutant.Overnight, the unknown became a talking point.Tambe did not fade away after that moment. He stayed relevant. He out-thought batters younger than him. He used flight, guile and control. In 2014, he finished as the tournament’s one of the most lethal bowlers, having amssed 15 wickets.His rise became one of the IPL’s most inspiring subplots.Yet, for all the applause, Tambe remained on the fringes of Indian cricket’s larger plans.For decades, the BCCI has enforced a strict policy: active Indian cricketers cannot participate in overseas leagues unless they officially retire from Indian cricket.The aim was to protect the IPL’s exclusivity and control player workload.For elite players, the IPL was enough. For others, it was a ceiling.Tambe belonged to that latter group. He was valued in the IPL but was not part of India’s domestic or international framework.As he moved into his mid-40s, opportunities in India began to dry up. At the same time, the global T20 ecosystem was expanding rapidly.The choice before him was clear: stay within the system and fade away, or step outside it and take a risk.In 2020, 48-year-old Pravin Tambe made a decision that no Indian male cricketer had dared to make before. He accepted an offer to play in the Caribbean Premier League (CPL) for the St Kitts & Nevis Patriots.At the time, Tambe had to formally retire from Indian cricket to play the tournament.Tambe’s age and his absence from India’s plans meant the moment passed quietly. But when he walked out in CPL colours, history had been made.For the first time, an Indian player had crossed the IPL barrier.Tambe’s CPL appearance did not trigger prime-time debates or social media storms. Yet, its importance cannot be overstated.It proved that the wall around Indian players and overseas leagues was not impenetrable.He went on to feature in other foreign leagues, including the Lanka Premier League, extending his playing career well into his mid-40s.At an age when most cricketers transition into coaching or commentary, Tambe was still bowling leg-spin under lights, competing against international stars.The decision came with consequences. Playing abroad meant completely stepping away from Indian cricket structures.There would be no domestic recall. No late-blooming India call. No official backing.But Tambe was pragmatic. In the three appearances he made in the Caribbean, he could only take three wickets. But his career had already defied every known rule.Waiting for opportunities at home made little sense. Overseas leagues offered something more meaningful — relevance and the chance to keep playing the game he loved.Tambe’s journey is not just about personal success. It shines a light on a rigid system that leaves little room for late bloomers and fringe professionals.For every superstar the IPL produces, there are dozens of players who hover just outside the spotlight.Players good enough to compete globally, but not central to India’s plans.Tambe showed that age, background and labels do not have to define the end of a career.He showed that Indian cricketers do not need to disappear quietly once domestic doors begin to close.",Pravin Tambe played in the Caribbean Premier League for St Kitts & Nevis Patriots.

Jay Shah’s 2036 Olympic blueprint for India: '8 Medals won’t cut it'

MANCHESTER: Manchester United have turned to former player Michael Carrick to salvage their imploding season.Carrick was hired Tuesday as head coach until the end of the season after Ruben Amorim was fired last week.The former England midfielder won five Premier League titles and the Champions League during a trophy-laden playing career at Old Trafford. He was also an assistant coach at United and had an unbeaten three-game spell as interim manager when Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was fired in 2021.On this occasion, Carrick was selected ahead of Solskjaer, who was also interviewed for the role.“I know what it takes to succeed here; my focus is now on helping the players to reach the standards that we expect at this incredible club, which we know that this group is more than capable of producing,” he said.By appointing Carrick on a temporary basis, United are giving itself time to find a long-term replacement for Amorim, who became the sixth permanent manager or coach to be discarded by the storied club after more than a decade of decline since Alex Ferguson retired in 2013.It is possible Carrick could put himself in contention if he impresses during the 17 remaining games this season. And while he has only initially been appointed for the short-term, it was notable that United did not describe him as interim when announcing his contract.Carrick’s prioritiesCarrick’s only full-time managerial experience was at second-tier Middlesbrough from 2022-25, where his reign ended after failing to secure promotion to the Premier League.Former England assistant Steve Holland will be part of his coaching team at United.Carrick's first two games are tough ones — at home to second-place Manchester City in the league on Saturday and away to first-place Arsenal the following weekend.In his previous spell at United, he oversaw wins against Arsenal and Villarreal as well as a draw at Chelsea.His priority is to secure Champions League qualification after defeat to Brighton in the third round of the FA Cup on Sunday put the 20-time English champion on course for another trophyless season after ending up empty-handed last term.United, which were knocked out of the English League Cup by fourth-tier Grimsby, is seventh in the Premier League, but Carrick said he had “total belief” in the players.“There is still a lot to fight for this season, we are ready to pull everyone together and give the fans the performances that their loyal support deserves,” he said.As well as Carrick and Solskjaer, other former United players Darren Fletcher and Ruud van Nistelrooy were considered for the role.

PARIS: Former Marseille coach Rolland Courbis, a charismatic figure of French soccer who later became a prominent pundit, has died, his employer said on Monday. He was 72.RMC radio did not disclose the cause of the death in a statement released in agreement with Courbis' family.Born in Marseille, Courbis came through the club's academy. A rugged defender, he was part of the team that won the French league and cup double in 1972 and returned to the club in the late 1990s as coach.As a player, he also won two French league titles and a French Cup with Monaco.""A Marseillais at heart, he embodied popular, dynamic football. His unmistakable accent carried his frank, direct, often passionate and always sincere words,"" Marseille said in a tribute.Courbis enjoyed a much-traveled coaching career, with spells in France and abroad, notably at Bordeaux, Lens, Montpellier and the USM Alger.Among the many defining moments of his career was a stunning comeback he oversaw when coaching Marseille. His team found itself 4-0 down at home to Montpellier in 1998 but fought back to seal a remarkable 5-4 victory.Courbis, who had a taste for casino gambling and lived with an Italian countess for a while, led a tumultuous life.He was seriously wounded in 1996 when gunmen fatally shot the president of a French soccer team outside a stadium following a game. Courbis, who was also involved in several legal cases and sentenced to prison, was hit by a bullet during the attack.France coach Didier Deschamps said that with his passing, French soccer lost ""a fine connoisseur of football and its inner workings, but also of the game itself.""""He was a true passionate figure,"" Deschamps added. ""And in recent years, he chose to pass on that passion behind a microphone, with a turn of phrase all his own.""Since 2005, he had become a consultant on RMC, where he commented on football news.""His passion came through in his trademark Marseille accent and in a very direct rapport with listeners,"" RMC said. ""A freedom of tone that kept the language of the supporters, while sharing their questions and emotions. He was particularly successful in remaining approachable and warm, while still being demanding on substance.""","Former Marseille coach Rolland Courbis has died, his employer says. He was 72.

It was already a bruising night for Manchester United and their captain. Hours after the club's FA Cup journey ended with a 2–1 defeat to Brighton, Bruno Fernandes found himself at the centre of an unexpected storm off the pitch, after his official X account was hacked and began posting a series of bizarre and taunting messages.Fernandes played the full 90 minutes in the third-round loss on Sunday, a result that compounded United's inconsistent season. Later that night, however, confusion spread among supporters when the Portuguese midfielder's verified X account — followed by more than 4.5 million users — suddenly sprang to life for the first time in months.The posts initially appeared to promote cryptocurrency-related content, asking followers for help “making a coin” and expressing mock confusion over crypto platforms. Within minutes, the tone shifted sharply, with messages openly mocking Manchester United's struggles just hours after their FA Cup exit. One post read: “Man Utd are in the dumps,” while another claimed, “This is why I need to get paid more.”As the situation escalated, the hacker began tagging high-profile accounts, including YouTuber KSI, world darts champion Luke Littler, the England cricket team and even adult star Bonnie Blue.One message bizarrely promoted Macclesfield FC, fresh from their shock FA Cup upset of Crystal Palace.Manchester United were quick to acknowledge the breach. In a statement from the club's official account, United warned supporters: “Bruno Fernandes' X account has been hacked. Fans should not interact with any posts or direct messages.”Despite the warning, the individual behind the hack continued to post and reply, even mocking the situation with comments such as: “Aren't you having fun?” One of the most provocative posts resurfaced an image of Liverpool's infamous 7–0 win over United at Anfield in March 2023, rubbing salt into fresh wounds.The hacked account also replied sarcastically to teenage United prospect Shea Lacey, who had apologised publicly after being sent off against Brighton.Fernandes, who rarely uses X, had last posted in October to mark his 300th appearance for the club. By late night, the posts were deleted as club officials worked to regain control.The incident adds Fernandes to a growing list of elite players targeted online, highlighting the increasing vulnerability of high-profile athletes in the digital age.","Manchester United captain Bruno Fernandes' official X account was hacked.

United in disarray

MANCHESTER: Manchester United 's problems mounted as the managerless Red Devils crashed out of the FA Cup after a 2-1 defeat against Brighton on Sunday. Brajan Gruda put Brighton ahead in the first half at Old Trafford and former United striker Danny Welbeck netted after the break.Benjamin Sesko's reply came too late to save his side from a third round exit as United teenager Shea Lacey was sent off in the final moments.United were barraged by jeers from furious fans following the latest miserable result in another troubled season.Caretaker boss Darren Fletcher has failed to stop the rot following Ruben Amorim's shock sacking on Monday, with United looking to appoint an interim manager until the end of the season.Former United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Michael Carrick, a decorated ex-United midfielder, have both been linked with the temporary role.But regardless of United's past pedigree, the chaos enveloping Old Trafford hardly makes it an appealing job for any manager of stature these days.Welbeck, 35, was at United when they won their most recent Premier League title in 2013 under Alex Ferguson, who watched the Brighton debacle from the director's box as the current generation showed how far they have fallen from the Scot's golden era.United, currently a disappointing seventh in the Premier League, are without a win in four games and have managed only one victory in their last seven matches.That wretched form is unlikely to improve anytime soon with United hosting Manchester City next weekend before travelling to Premier League leaders Arsenal on January 25.After a humiliating League Cup loss at fourth tier Grimsby in August, United have exited both domestic cups at the first hurdle for the first time since 1981-82.Avenging their 2023 FA Cup semi-final loss to United, Brighton have now won on four of their last five visits to Old Trafford.United midfielder Kobbie Mainoo started for only the second time this season as Fletcher left Casemiro on the bench in one of three changes from the midweek 2-2 draw at lowly Burnley.Albion keeper Jason Steele made fine saves to deny Diogo Dalot and Bruno Fernandes in the early stages.But Brighton made the most of those escapes to take the lead in the 12th minute.Welbeck was the catalyst with an incisive run and cross to Georginio Rutter, whose header was cleared off the line by Lisandro Martinez before Gruda slammed past Senne Lammens from close-range.United were in disarray and chants against co-owners Jim Ratcliffe and the Glazer family rang around Old Trafford.Fernandes sent a free-kick wide and Matheus Cunha was narrowly off-target as United trudged off with boos ringing in their ears at half-time.Mainoo was hauled off in the second half after a lacklustre display that did little to rebuke Amorim's decision to ignore him for much of this season.United's problems are far wider than just Mainoo and Brighton punished their shambolic defending to double the lead in the 64th minute.Gruda was given time and space to pick out Welbeck inside the area and he lashed an exquisite strike past Lammens as the atmosphere turned even more toxic.Sesko set up a frenetic finale after heading home from Fernandes' 85th minute corner.But United couldn't muster a late escape as Lacey, already on a booking, brought a fitting end to a painful defeat when he was sent off for throwing the ball away in frustration.",Manchester United crashed out of the FA Cup after a 2-1 defeat against Brighton.

Poll What do you think of Kazuyoshi Miura's decision to play professional football at 58? Inspiring Questionable Unusual but brave

Kazuyoshi Miura is not ready to fade away. At 58, the former Japan international striker has vowed to show he still belongs on the football pitch as he prepares for an extraordinary 41st professional season, extending a career that began nearly four decades ago.Popularly known as “King Kazu,” Miura has joined third-division side Fukushima United on a six-month loan ahead of the new Japanese season, which kicks off in early February. The move brings him back into the J. League structure for the first time in five years and underlines his refusal to let age dictate the end of his playing days.Speaking at his official unveiling in Tokyo on Friday, Miura said he was determined to repay the faith shown in him by his new club. “Strikers can score goals in bunches or they can go through dry spells, and you have to have an image in your mind of scoring goals,” he told reporters. “It’s difficult to put a number on it but I definitely want to score and assist.”Still brimming with ambition, Miura added that he wants to contribute in multiple ways. “I’d like to dribble down the left wing and whip in crosses,” he said, offering a glimpse of the attacking intent that has defined his long career.Miura made his professional debut in 1986 with Brazilian giants Santos and has since played across the globe, turning out for clubs in Italy, Croatia, Australia and Portugal. He was a central figure in popularising football in Japan, particularly after the launch of the professional J. League in 1993.Last season, Miura featured for fourth-tier Atletico Suzuka, making eight appearances without scoring as the club was relegated after finishing second from bottom and losing a playoff. Despite the setback, he remains undeterred.Miura, who earned 89 caps and scored 55 goals for Japan but was famously omitted from their 1998 World Cup squad, summed up his motivation simply: “I just want to be on the pitch, even for just one minute or one second longer.”","Kazuyoshi Miura has joined third-division side Fukushima United on a six-month loan ahead of the new Japanese season, which kicks off in early February.

Arsenal winger Gabriel Martinelli has issued a public apology to Liverpool defender Conor Bradley after a controversial late incident marred the goalless Premier League draw at the Emirates, drawing fierce criticism from pundits and rival players alike.The flashpoint occurred deep into stoppage time when Bradley went down near the touchline after landing awkwardly while making a clearance. As the Liverpool defender lay in visible pain, Martinelli attempted to hurry the restart by dropping the ball on him and then shoving him off the pitch. Bradley eventually left the stadium on crutches with his knee strapped, raising fears of a serious injury.The Brazilian winger was shown a yellow card, but some former players felt the punishment was lenient. On Sky Sports, Roy Keane branded Martinelli's conduct “a disgrace,” while Gary Neville described it as “absolutely disgraceful,” reflecting the widespread backlash that followed the final whistle.Responding to the criticism, Martinelli took to Instagram to offer a heartfelt apology, revealing he had already contacted Bradley directly.“Conor and I have messaged and I've already apologised to him,” Martinelli wrote. “I really didn't understand he was seriously injured in the heat of the moment. I want to say I'm deeply sorry for reacting. Sending Conor all my best again for a quick recovery.”Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta came out in defence of his player, insisting there was no malicious intent. “Knowing Gabi, there's zero intention,” Arteta said. “Probably he doesn't know [Bradley is injured]. He's an incredible, lovely guy and would never do that if he knew the situation.”Liverpool boss Arne Slot echoed that view while expressing concern over Bradley's condition. “Let's hope for the best, but I fear the worst for Conor Bradley,” Slot said. “You cannot expect Martinelli to think so clearly in the 94th minute. I'm 100 percent sure that if he knew what the injury might be, he would never do that.”However, Slot also admitted his discomfort at seeing an injured player being moved. “I didn't like to see one of my players being moved out of the pitch if he might have such a big injury,” he added.The match itself ended 0-0, marking Arsenal's first home blank of the season but still extending their lead at the top of the table to six points over Manchester City.","Gabriel Martinelli has issued a public apology to Liverpool defender Conor Bradley after a controversial late incident.

Demi Lovato confirmed as season two opener as Kylie Kelce’s podcast return grabs instant attention

The biggest detail came first, and it spread fast. Kylie Kelce confirmed that singer Demi Lovato will headline the season two premiere of her podcast Not Gonna Lie, instantly setting social media buzzing. The announcement signaled not just the return of the show, but a clear statement of intent. With a global pop star opening the season, Kylie made it clear that her podcast is no longer a quiet breakout. It is now a mainstream player in the media space, drawing attention well beyond the NFL audience.The news comes as the podcast prepares to drop its first episode of season two this week. Fans reacted quickly, praising Kylie’s guest selection and speculating about the tone of the upcoming conversation. Demi Lovato’s appearance adds star power, but it also aligns with the show’s reputation for honest, unfiltered discussions that go beyond surface-level promotion.This moment was the basis of season one. Rather than pursuing viral videos, Kylie concentrated on the conversations that were authentic. Regular shows like Can I Be Honest? and Doomscroll of the Week gave guests a chance to open up, which listeners rarely get to listen to.That authenticity paid off. Not Gonna Lie shot up to the top of both Apple Podcasts and Spotify, and temporarily replacing The Joe Rogan Experience. The show was voted best emerging podcast in 2025 as it maintained its place over weeks and ensured permanence.Although the emphasis is still on the Demi Lovato season opening, the success of the podcast is not the only aspect of Kylie as far as her career progress is concerned. Her reputation in media is slowly becoming her own, as she is known publicly as the wife of Philadelphia Eagles star Jason Kelce. That growth will carry on in 2026 when she becomes part of the NBC Winter Olympics coverage in Italy, with an analysis based on her field hockey experience and in-depth knowledge of sports.Previous guests to season one included Kelly Clarkson and Michelle Obama, and the announcement of Demi Lovato has already created some speculation about the next guest. As season two starts to approach, Kylie Kelce is no longer gathering momentum under the carpet. She is leading the discussion, and audiences are evidently listening.","Kylie Kelce confirmed that singer Demi Lovato will headline the season two premiere of her podcast Not Gonna Lie.

Antonio Brown ’s graphic compared Rodgers to his infamous 2021 walk-off moment



The Pittsburgh Steelers’ season ended Monday with a one-sided loss that raised severe criticism. Aaron Rodgers struggled throughout as Pittsburgh fell 30-6 to the Houston Texans in the AFC wild-card round. The offense failed to score a touchdown and never gained control of the game.A-Rod's rough night quickly turned into a talking point across the league. The next day, the performance had already sparked reactions online, including one from a familiar former Steeler who never failed to voice his opinion.Antonio Brown posted a viral graphic on social media hours after the game. The edited image showed Aaron Rodgers recreated in Brown’s infamous shirtless walk-off scene from Week 17 of the 2021 NFL season. That moment occurred during a Tampa Bay Buccaneers vs New York Jets game, when Brown removed his pads and exited the field mid-game.The graphic implied that Rodgers, like Brown in 2021, had mentally checked out. The image spread rapidly on NFL social feeds on Jan 14, with fans recognizing the reference instantly. Brown did not add a caption, letting the visual do the talking.The timing made the graphic hit harder. Rodgers completed 17 of 34 passes for 146 yards.He threw a pick-six to Texans rookie Calen Bullock late in the second quarter. He also lost a fumble that defensive tackle Sheldon Rankins returned for a touchdown. Houston’s defense recorded four sacks and forced constant pressure. Pittsburgh never reached the end zone.Brown’s history with the Steelers added another layer. Drafted by Pittsburgh in 2010, Brown spent nine seasons with the franchise and earned seven Pro Bowl selections. He won a Super Bowl with the Buccaneers in February 2021 and retired in March 2023. Since then, he has remained active online, often reacting to significant or NFL moments tied to former teams.After the loss, Rodgers faced retirement questions during his postgame press conference at NRG Stadium on January 13. When asked about it again, he walked away. Earlier, he said, “I’ve answered those questions,” while referencing head coach Mike Tomlin. This loss eventually led Mike Tomlin to lose his jobIf this was Rodgers’ final game, the image Brown posted may outlast the box score. The Steelers now face an uncertain offseason.

Patrick Mahomes could return Week 1 after faster ACL Surgery than Micah Parsons,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/patrick-mahomes-could-return-week-1-after-faster-acl-surgery-than-micah-parsons/articleshow/126516292.cms,"Patrick Mahomes could return Week 1 after faster ACL Surgery than Micah Parsons

Patrick Mahomes’ early decision aligns with the Chiefs’ optimism

Patrick Mahomes and Micah Parsons saw their seasons end within days of each other in December after both suffered ACL injuries. The timing of the injuries was similar, but the decisions that followed differed. As the new season begins, that decision has placed Mahomes in a stronger position to attempt a Week 1 return, while Parsons has already understood the challenge ahead.Mahomes gained quick medical assistance. The star-QB underwent surgery in mid-December, shortly after sustaining a torn ACL and LCL in his left knee. Parsons, on the other hand, delayed the process until Dec. 29. In a recovery process that often spans nearly nine months, that two-week gap has become crucial, especially with offseason events and training camp dates already set.Chiefs HC Andy Reid addressed Mahomes’ progress on Jan. 12, 2026, during a media availability at the team facility in Kansas City. He confirmed that the quarterback remained in the city to continue his rehabilitation under the team’s supervision and said the early signs had been encouraging.“First of all, he’s doing great,” Reid said during the session. “He’s staying here, working through the rehab, and everything is moving in the right direction.”That message was reinforced a day earlier by Mahomes’ longtime trainer Bobby Stroupe. On Jan 11, Stroupe posted an old training photo on Instagram and referenced the doubts Mahomes faced following his 2020 postseason toe injury. The post served as a reminder of Mahomes’ past recoveries and his ability to return without a drop in performance.Meanwhile, Micah Parsons has taken a more measured stance. Speaking on Jan 13, 2026, during a Cowboys-organized community event in Dallas, the star acknowledged that returning for Week 1 would be difficult. He described the goal as “lofty” while maintaining that his focus remains on a full and proper recovery rather than rushing the process.For KC, Mahomes’ presence carries added weight. Since 2018, the team's win percentage has dropped sharply in games he does not start, a trend that underscores his importance to the franchise’s stability and offensive identity. That reality explains both the urgency behind his early surgery. The contrast between Mahomes and Parsons is not about commitment or toughness. It is about timing. Mahomes acted quickly, so the result was quick.Also Read: Micah Parsons injury update: Will Packers LB play tonight vs. Bears?","Patrick Mahomes and Micah Parsons both suffered ACL injuries in December.

“It was a sickness”: Tom Brady opens up on the obsessive habit that defined his legendary NFL career,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/it-was-a-sickness-tom-brady-opens-up-on-the-obsessive-habit-that-defined-his-legendary-nfl-career/articleshow/126516219.cms,"Tom Brady reveals shocking truth about his spiral obsession that went far beyond normal NFL dedication (Getty Images)

Tom Brady perfect spiral obsession revealed as a driving force



Tom Brady's perfect spiral obsession was never just a quarterback quirk. It was the engine that powered two decades of dominance, even when it quietly tormented him. Long before fans argued about rings or records, Brady was battling something far more personal every time the ball left his hand.In his own words, that fixation often crossed into unhealthy territory. While reflecting on his playing days, Brady admitted the pursuit of flawless mechanics followed him into every snap, every throw, every practice rep. Success did not silence it. If anything, greatness only fed the hunger to be sharper, cleaner, and more exact than the last play.Appearing on the Spittin’ Chiclets podcast, Brady did not romanticize the habit. He named it plainly and without apology. “It was a sickness… If I was aiming right for your nose and I hit your right ear you may not know that, but I knew,” Brady said. That level of self-awareness separated him from most athletes who live comfortably with results rather than details.Over 23 NFL seasons, Brady completed 64.3 percent of his passes, a figure most quarterbacks would celebrate. Yet he rarely felt satisfied. He revealed that out of roughly 700 throws in a season, only about 20 met his own internal standard of perfection.“I’d say, out of 700 throws, maybe 20 of them did exactly what I wanted to,” he said. The misses, by public measure, were still elite. For Brady, they lingered.Fans listening to the interview saw that obsession differently. “That’s why he’s the greatest,” one user wrote. Another compared Brady’s mindset to golf addiction, noting how one perfect shot keeps players chasing the next. Even Brady leaned into that analogy, calling a flawless spiral “euphoric” and admitting, “When you’re addicted to throwing a perfect spiral, that’s all I needed. I was just like, let’s throw. ”Ironically, Brady never led the league in completion percentage more than once and never cracked 70 percent in a season. Still, there is little debate today about his place atop NFL history. His precision may have caused frustration, even stomach aches, but it also built seven championships and unmatched longevity.Now transitioning into broadcasting, Brady continues to dissect the craft with the same intensity. That restless attention to detail, once labeled a sickness, remains the trait that defines him. It is also the reason his story still commands attention long after the final whistle.Also Read: Amid Travis Kelce retirement rumors, Chiefs quietly sign new TE in what feels like a strategic shift","Tom Brady's perfect spiral obsession was never just a quarterback quirk.

Antonio Brown was once one of the NFL’s most electrifying wide receivers, getting massive contracts and endorsements but over the years, his off-field controversies, contract disputes, and bankruptcy dramatically changed his financial story. From rookie earnings in 2010 to a negative net worth in 2026, here’s a year-by-year look at how Antonio Brown’s fortune rose, peaked, and then went down.Antonio Brown entered the NFL as a 2010 Steelers draft pick, starting with modest rookie earnings. Over the next several years, he established himself as one of the league’s premier wide receivers earning multi-million-dollar contracts and performance bonuses. By 2017, his four-year, $68 million extension with Pittsburgh cemented him as one of the NFL’s highest-paid wideouts.In 2018, Brown’s combination of on-field dominance and high-profile endorsements with Nike, Pepsi and more pushed his net worth close to $50 million. However, in 2019, a contract with the Raiders collapsed before the season and a short stint with the Patriots ended abruptly, causing him to miss out on significant guaranteed money.This marked the beginning of financial volatility in his career.Brown signed short-term deals with the New England Patriots and then the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, adding millions in salaries and signing bonuses. These contracts, while smaller than his peak Steelers extension, helped maintain his financial standing. By this time, career earnings had exceeded roughly $80 million, though his net worth began to be affected by personal and legal issues.From 2022 onward, Antonio Brown faced legal troubles, canceled endorsements and mounting debts which caused his net worth to drop. In May 2024, he filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy, reporting only about $50,000 in assets against nearly $3 million in liabilities. By 2025, his net worth turned negative and this status continued into 2026 despite the protection of his Florida homestead.Antonio Brown’s financial story is a stark reminder of how quickly fortunes can rise and fall in professional sports. His on-field talent made him a top NFL earner but off-field challenges have reshaped his financial reality.Also read - Christian McCaffrey net worth timeline (2016–2026): How record-breaking contracts shaped his fortune","Antonio Brown entered the NFL as a 2010 Steelers draft pick, starting with modest rookie earnings.

Travis Kelce retirement rumors push Chiefs toward quiet tight end depth planning



Amid Travis Kelce retirement rumors, the Kansas City Chiefs are moving with quiet intent rather than public drama. While the league’s spotlight shines on playoff contenders, Kansas City is busy shaping its next chapter behind closed doors. A reserve signing may not spark headlines on its own, but context gives this move weight. With uncertainty swirling around one of the franchise’s most iconic players, even small roster decisions carry larger meaning.The Chiefs are coming off a jarring season that forced reflection. Injuries, missed expectations, and an early winter at home have changed the tone inside the building. Patrick Mahomes rehabbing a torn ACL and LCL adds urgency to every choice. So does the reality that this offseason could mark the end of an era at tight end. The front office knows that waiting is not a plan.The signing of Tre Watson to a reserve deal fits that mindset. It is not a replacement move. It is protection against uncertainty. Watson already knows the system, the culture, and the daily grind in Kansas City. At 6-foot-5 and 250 pounds, he brings size, youth, and continuity to a position that could soon look very different.Kelce has been open about his process. On the New Heights podcast, he explained the internal clarity already shared with the team.""I’ve talked to a few people in the facility already with the exit meetings and they know where I stand at least right now,"" said Kelce.That honesty matters. So does timing. Kelce has been clear that he wants to decide before roster construction ramps up.""I want to give the Chiefs a good opportunity, whether I come back or not — or whether they want me back or not,"" said Kelce. ""I'd like to make that decision before they’ve got to get draft picks and free agency opens to fill the roster appropriately.""Watson’s deal reflects that preparation. With practice squad contracts expiring, the Chiefs acted fast to keep a developmental player they trust. Even if Kelce returns, he will be a free agent at 36. Planning ahead is not disrespect. It is responsibility.If Kelce does walk away, Noah Gray becomes the veteran anchor of a young group that includes Jared Wiley, Jake Briningstool, and Watson. That room has talent but limited experience. The Chiefs know it. They also know championships are not built on hope.For now, Kelce is taking time.“I think just being a regular human for a couple weeks,” Kelce said on last week’s edition of New Heights, “maybe a month or so, and try and figure out what I'm gonna do next in terms of my future in football. And I've talked to a few people in the facility already, having the exit meetings and everything, and they know where I stand, at least right now.”Until that decision comes, Kansas City is choosing readiness over reaction.Also Read: Aaron Rodgers retirement: Steelers playoff collapse raises serious questions as veteran QB dodges direct answers about what comes next","The Kansas City Chiefs signed tight end Tre Watson to a reserve deal.

George Kittle injury update: Medical experts explain why this setback could linger into next season,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/george-kittle-injury-update-medical-experts-explain-why-this-setback-could-linger-into-next-season/articleshow/126515094.cms,"George Kittle is out for the season after tearing his Achilles, an injury experts say requires nine to twelve months of recovery. Doctors describe painful surgery followed by phased physical therapy, progressing from light movement to sprinting and jumping. While modern techniques may help, his demanding position could delay his return until early next season.

What recovery really looks like for a tight end

The San Francisco 49ers are still alive in the NFC playoff hunt, but the cost of moving forward has been steep. Star tight end George Kittle is officially done for the season after suffering a torn Achilles, an injury that reshapes both the team’s postseason outlook and the player’s immediate future.For a franchise built on physical dominance and relentless effort, losing Kittle strikes at the heart of its identity. His injury unfolded in a way that longtime football watchers instantly recognized as serious. According to medical experts, Achilles tears often announce themselves in real time, and this one was no exception.The road back will demand patience, discipline, and resilience. Dr. Pandya described the procedure ahead in blunt terms, saying, ""It's a very painful surgery early on - you are basically going on your ankle, you are sewing these tendons together, immobilizing them, and then you are working through this period of getting that mobility back."" That process begins almost immediately with rehabilitation, often within days of surgery.Physical therapist Julian Cisneros outlined a long, structured rebuild. ""They will be doing a lot of manual work early on to facilitate the recovering of the tissues and then loading him in the gym,"" he said. The phases progress slowly.""It would be light resistance, just trying to go through a full range of motion nice and controlled, slow and steady, making sure his Achilles tolerate that.""Only later does the work intensify. ""Standing under his own body weight on a flat-level surface and raising up those heels nice and high.""Eventually, speed and explosiveness return. ""And then we can start incorporating more plyometric movements with balancing here, and then we will get him on the track or on the field and going through sprints, jumping progressions.""While newer surgical methods have shortened timelines for some players, Dr. Pandya cautioned that Kittle’s demanding role could extend recovery. Still, there is optimism he could return early next season. More importantly, experts agree the risk of re-injury after full recovery remains low, offering hope that the 49ers’ emotional leader can reclaim his form when it matters most.Also Read: “My super hero”: George Kittle’s wife Claire Kittle stands by him as he shares a heartbreaking update about his brutal injury",San Francisco 49ers tight end George Kittle is out for the season with a torn Achilles.

“Awful”: Joe Burrow’s brief interaction with young fan explodes into major controversy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/awful-joe-burrows-brief-interaction-with-young-fan-explodes-into-major-controversy/articleshow/126504805.cms,"Joe Burrow faced online backlash after a video showed him refusing to sign an autograph for a young fan late at night. While some fans criticized the Bengals quarterback for missing a meaningful moment, others defended his right to personal boundaries, noting the timing and modern autograph resale culture. The incident reignited debate over athletes’ responsibilities to fans.

Fans split over Joe Burrow’s late night decision

For Joe Burrow , life in the NFL has never stopped at the final whistle. Each action even off the field is weighty. That became the stark reality in August 2025 after a short interaction during the night promoted a hastening viral moment and gave rise to a caustic online discussion on the topic of fame and responsibility and personal limits.The Cincinnati Bengals quarterback became trending over the refusal to sign an autograph to a young fan late at night. toward his car as someone nearby pleaded for him to sign something “just for the kid.” Burrow declined and drove away. The moment was short. The reaction was not.The video was posted by NFL news aggregator Dov Kleiman, who noted, “You can see how sad the fan was.” That observation fueled frustration among some fans, who felt Burrow missed a chance to make a lasting memory. One comment read, “That dude will remember that for life, you’re the face of the franchise man act like it, with your friends or not, you pretty much have a responsibility to the youth.”Others took a harsher tone. “Bengals Star QB Joe Burrow has gone viral after refusing to sign an autograph for a kid at two in the morning!” another user wrote. The timing became central to the argument, with critics questioning whether star athletes should ever turn away young fans.Still, plenty of voices rushed to Burrow’s defense. One fan argued, “I’m probably in the top 1% of Joe Burrow haters, but what do you mean ‘awful’? Anyone asking for an autograph in 2025 means they’re just going to sell it for some extra scratch. Not to mention it’s 2 in the morning and he’s not in the mood.” Another added simply, “I wouldn’t be signing anything at 2AM either.”Context matters. This was not Burrow’s first autograph related headline. In 2023, he was praised for calling out adults who pushed kids aside during a signing session. “There were some grown men pushing some kids to get up front and that was just … I mean, come on you guys. What are we doing?” Burrow said at the time.The moment highlighted a larger truth about modern sports fame. Every decision is judged instantly. For Burrow, one quiet refusal reopened a loud conversation about where admiration ends and entitlement begins.Also Read: ""I want to be happy"": Joe Burrow’s rumored girlfriend Olivia Ponton makes a heartfelt confession amid his controversial remarks","Cincinnati Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow faced online backlash after a video showed him refusing to sign an autograph for a young fan late at night.

By highlighting shared values like kindness, authenticity, and work ethic, the NFL star revealed how deeply he admires both women. His unusually personal remarks suggest a meaningful bond that goes beyond casual romance.

Travis Kelce sees shared values in Taylor Swift and Donna Kelce

For Travis Kelce , admiration has always come easily when it comes to family. In a 2025 profile that still resonates, the Kansas City Chiefs star offered rare insight into the two women who shape his world most. What stood out was not fame or football. It was values. Quiet consistency. And the kind of character that shows up long before applause arrives.Kelce’s reflections landed softly but carried weight. Speaking candidly, he drew an emotional line between his upbringing and his present, connecting his mother and his partner through traits that define how they move through life. The result felt less like a headline and more like a personal thank you, delivered with sincerity rather than spectacle.Asked whether he saw similarities between Taylor Swift and his mother Donna Kelce, Kelce did not hesitate. “Their kindness, their genuineness, their ability to say hello to everyone in the room."" He went on to praise their emotional steadiness, noting their shared “ability to show love and support no matter what.”Work ethic, however, stood at the center of his answer. Kelce reflected on watching his mother build her career, saying, “And on top of that, their work ethic.I saw my mother reach goals she had set for herself, go from being a teller to working all the way up in the KeyBank building."" He then drew a direct parallel to Swift, explaining that he has seen her do “the exact same thing” by setting goals, exceeding expectations, and “really captivating the world in that regard. ”Kelce also described how his relationship with Swift grew naturally, without planning or pressure. “Nothing I’ve ever done has been a controlled, organized process. When I say it was so organic, we fell in love just based off the people we were sitting in a room together with,"" he said. Summing it up simply, he added, “We are two fun-loving people who have the morals to appreciate everyone for who they are. We share all those values. It kind of just took the f--- off.”Years later, the comments still stand as a rare glimpse into what Kelce values most. Not fame. Not headlines. But kindness, effort, and the people who quietly shape success behind the scenes.Also Read: “Her heart wants to be more involved”: Donna Kelce admits Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift’s wedding planning hasn’t been easy","Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce said he admires Taylor Swift and his mother Donna Kelce for their shared values.

Los Angeles Lakers Looking to Stop the Slide

LeBron James' Injury Situation vs Atlanta Hawks (January 13, 2026)

LeBron James’ Recent Production

What the Decision Means

LeBron James’ availability is the biggest question heading into the Los Angeles Lakers’ game against the Atlanta Hawks on January 13, 2026. With the Lakers struggling through a rough stretch and the schedule offering little rest, whether James takes the floor may decide how this game goes.At 41, LeBron James is still central to everything the Lakers do. However, the team has been cautious all season due to his ongoing right sciatica and muscle issues. He is listed as questionable, and that label has usually meant rest on the second night of back-to-backs. So far this season, he has not played both games in those situations.The Los Angeles Lakers come into the game fifth in the Western Conference with a 23–14 record. That position looks solid, but recent form tells a different story. They have lost three straight games and are trying to recover from a defeat against the Sacramento Kings, where James finished with 22 points in 33 minutes.This matchup also falls in the middle of a demanding five-games-in-seven-nights stretch. With fatigue becoming a factor, the Lakers need a win to steady themselves before the schedule eases.The Atlanta Hawks arrive ninth in the Eastern Conference at 20–21.While inconsistent, they have shown they can compete, especially against teams dealing with injuries or rotation changes.LeBron James has already missed 17 games this season as the Lakers focus on keeping him healthy for the playoffs. Luka Dončić is also questionable with a groin issue, raising concerns about how much scoring and playmaking Los Angeles will have available.Austin Reaves and Adou Thiero are ruled out with MCL injuries, further limiting the Lakers’ depth. On the Atlanta side, Kristaps Porziņģis is sidelined with an Achilles injury, and N’Faly Dante remains out with an ACL tear.If James does not play, Jarred Vanderbilt is expected to take on a bigger role. In that scenario, the Lakers would depend heavily on Dončić if he is cleared.When James has been on the floor, his numbers remain strong. Over his last six games, he has averaged 27.7 points, 6.7 rebounds, and 7.2 assists, along with 1.5 steals and two made three-pointers per game. Even in the loss to Sacramento, where his outside shot did not fall, his overall impact was clear.Also read: Los Angeles Lakers vs Atlanta Hawks injury report: Injured and questionable players, where to watch, team stats, and more (January 13, 2026) If James sits, the balance shifts toward Atlanta. Players like Jalen Johnson, Dyson Daniels, and CJ McCollum would have a chance to take control. For the Lakers, the final injury update before tip-off may decide whether this game becomes a turning point or another tough night.","The Los Angeles Lakers host the Atlanta Hawks on January 13, 2026.

Phoenix Suns vs Miami Heat - Game Prediction

The Phoenix Suns will face the Miami Heat at the Kaseya Centre tonight in an attempt to extend their most recent winning run to four games. The Phoenix Suns had low expectations going into the season, and they started out playing mediocre basketball with a.500 record throughout the majority of December. However, with Devin Booker spearheading one of the NBA's most balanced offensive attacks, the Suns have gone 9-2 in their previous 11 games.The Miami Heat, on the other hand, have dropped four of their last five games and are currently on a three-game losing streak. Despite Tyler Herro's comeback, a once-powerful offence has recently struggled. Even if Norman Powell is able to play tonight, his health is still a concern because he is doubtful due to back pain and probably won't be fully recovered.On Tuesday, January 13, the Phoenix Suns take on the Miami Heat at Kaseya Centre to start a six-game road trip. Arizona's Family Sports and 3TV will broadcast the game at 7:30 p.m. ET. Additionally, KTVK and FDSN Sun will telecast the entire match.

Miami, on the other hand, has lost four of its last five games and three in a row.Following a much more significant road victory against the New York Knicks two nights prior, the Suns defeated the Washington Wizards 112-93 on Sunday. Overall, the Suns' recent cohesiveness and scoring balance give them the advantage here, but Miami's home-court advantage and defensive discipline might matter if it can reduce Phoenix's three-point efficiency.Also read: Oklahoma City Thunder vs Miami Heat (01-11-2026) game preview: When and where to watch, expected lineup, injury report, prediction, and more","The Phoenix Suns (24–15) take on the Miami Heat (20–19) tonight at the Kaseya Centre in Miami.

Thewhen they face the Milwaukee Bucks on. The team has ruled him out due to right foot injury maintenance.Minnesota enters the game with a 26-14 record and sits fourth in the Western Conference. Even with that strong position, losing Edwards changes how the Timberwolves approach the matchup. He has been the team’s main scoring option all season, and his absence puts pressure on the rest of the roster to cover that gap.The decision to sit Anthony Edwards is tied to continued management of his right foot, not a new injury. He missed three games in mid-December for the same issue and also dealt with a brief hamstring problem earlier in the season. The Timberwolves have been careful with his workload, especially given how many minutes he plays each night.Through 33 games, Edwards has averaged 28.9 points, 5.0 rebounds, and 3.8 assists per game. He is shooting 50.0 percent from the field and 40.9 percent from three-point range while playing close to 35 minutes per game. Those numbers explain why the team is cautious, even in an important matchup.With Anthony Edwards out, Minnesota is missing its main scorer and one of its most reliable perimeter defenders.That challenge grows with Rudy Gobert also sidelined because of a suspension tied to flagrant foul points.The Timberwolves are 4-3 in games Edwards has missed this season, so they’ve shown they can manage, but there is less room for mistakes. Mike Conley will need to run more of the offense, while Donte DiVincenzo and Bones Hyland are expected to pick up scoring responsibilities. Clean defense and steady ball movement will be even more important than usual.The Milwaukee Bucks enter the game with a 17-22 record and have struggled to find consistency. Giannis Antetokounmpo remains the focal point, but the team has not been steady around him.Edwards has averaged 24.4 points in 10 career games against Milwaukee, so his absence clearly affects the matchup.

2016 to 2020: How Draymond Green’s net worth grew with Warriors contracts and endorsements

2021 to 2026: How Draymond Green became one of the NBA’s highest earners

American basketball player Draymond Green is a member of the NBA's Golden State Warriors. Green has won four NBA titles and been named an All-Star four times. In 2005, Green began playing basketball for Michigan State while still in high school. His net worth is $90 million.In the second round of the 2012 NBA Draft, Green was selected by the Warriors. He soon emerged as a pivotal figure in the Warriors' comeback, leading them to the 2015 NBA Finals, where they were defeated by the Cleveland Cavaliers. In the ensuing years, Green's play kept getting better, and in 2017 he was selected for the All-NBA Second Team.Draymond Green received an annual salary of roughly $14.3 million in 2016 as part of his five-year, $82 million contract inked in 2015, significantly increasing his net worth in comparison to his rookie deals. However, exact net worth numbers for that specific year are difficult to find, with more focus being placed on his historic contract and growing earnings.Due to his five-year, $82 million contract with the Warriors in 2015, Draymond Green's net worth was rising significantly in 2017. In addition to his $17.5 million pay from sponsorships that season, Forbes highlighted his $4 million endorsement revenue and ambition to become a billionaire, demonstrating substantial wealth creation even at that time.Draymond Green's salary for the 2018–19 season was listed at approximately $17.5 million, while precise 2018 numbers fluctuated. Due to his $82 million 2015 deal and endorsements, his earnings and net worth were expected to increase, putting him on course to become a billionaire.Green's projected $20 million net worth in 2019 came from endorsements and his NBA salary, which was roughly $17.5 million that season. That year, he also agreed to a large $100 million contract extension with the Warriors, which significantly raised his future earning potential.Draymond Green's net worth in 2020 was mostly determined by his NBA earnings, with estimates of his $22.2 million salary for the 2020–21 season and current contracts contributing to an overall estimate likely in the tens of millions, but exact figures vary. A major contributing factor to his increasing fortune in 2019 and beyond was his high-value contract.Due to sponsorships, Draymond Green's net worth was predicted to be in the tens of millions (for example, $50 million as of early 2022) when he signed a big contract in 2019. His high NBA salary, which is estimated to have been between $22 and $24 million per year for the 2020–21 and 2021–22 seasons, was a major factor in his net worth in 2021.Although exact numbers differ, Draymond Green's salary for the 2021–2022 NBA season was roughly $24 million. He signed a multi-year, $100 million contract extension in 2023, indicating that his substantial career earnings contributed to his increasing fortune from his Michigan State days. Estimates of his total net worth that year sometimes put it in the tens of millions.Because of his high NBA salary (a four-year, $100 million contract with the Warriors signed in 2023), endorsement deals from businesses like Nike, and revenue from his podcast, ""The Draymond Green Show,"" Draymond Green is one of the highest-paid Warriors and a significant earner in the league. His estimated net worth as of late 2024/early 2025 is approximately $90 million.Draymond Green's considerable net worth in 2026 is anticipated to be influenced by his $100 million deal with the Warriors, which will earn him over $25 million in 2025–2026, his substantial career earnings, which will approach $230 million in total by 2026, and lucrative sponsorships. The precise overall net worth, however, varies; estimates in recent years have been approximately $50 million before accounting for recent earnings.Also read: Giannis Antetokounmpo Net Worth timeline (2016 to 2026): NBA salary, brand collaborations, and more","American basketball player Draymond Green is a member of the NBA's Golden State Warriors.

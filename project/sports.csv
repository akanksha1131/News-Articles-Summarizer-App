Excerpts:

How should Bumrah be managed, given he has had his share of injuries?

How invaluable is Bumrah to India’s scheme of things?

Was Bumrah’s performance in Australia the best by a visiting bowler?

What do you make of India’s Champions Trophy triumph?

Did India have an unfair edge in the CT?

How do you look at India’s white-ball dominance? Can it be extended?

How can India become a bigger force in the longest format?

CHENNAI: Legendary Australia fast bowler Glenn McGrath has backed Jasprit Bumrah to make a strong comeback from his back injury, saying that the premier India pacer has to be “smart” about it as he is no longer young. Bumrah missed the Champions Trophy with a lower-back issue and is likely to be unavailable for the first few weeks of the IPL season . McGrath, the director of the MRF Pace Foundation here, also praised India for making the best use of the conditions during their CT triumph and asserted that they did not have an unfair advantage although they played all their matches at one venue.He puts more stress on his body than the other bowlers. He has found ways to manage it, but unfortunately not all the time. He has done it before (making a comeback from injury), he will know better than anyone (about) the recovery time, the time in the gym. He is not as young as he used to be, so he has to be smarter about what he does.He has to work even harder off the field. Being a fast bowler is like driving a car. If you do not top it up with fuel, you are going to run out of fuel sooner or later. My fuel tank was bigger than Jasprit’s because I did not bowl as quickly as him. These guys know how they work at their best. If India are under the pump, they need him.He is an experienced fast bowler and is one of the best in the world. He is unique. I take keen interest in Jasprit and the way he goes. The recent Australia-India Test series showed how important he is to India. If you take Bumrah out of that series, it could have been very one-sided. If he had been fit enough to bowl in the second innings of the last Test (Sydney), you never know. To play five Tests in a row is a massive ask and you have to look after him.The stats say that. Without a doubt, he was unplayable sometimes. It looked like he would get a wicket every over. I would not have minded playing on those pitches.They were the team to beat and they played well. Virat Kohli came back to form, as did the other guys. Australia had their chances in the semifinal, obviously we had a few of our bowlers who were out. The pitches took spin and India played well.It is the way it is. India does not travel to Pakistan anymore. There was only one other thing — the matches had to be played in Dubai. You have to give credit to India, they played to the conditions. They know how to play on spinning tracks. I do not think that they had an unfair advantage. It is like saying there is an unfair advantage if India play all their matches in India, if Australia play all their matches in Australia.Their IPL and T20 cricket has had a positive impact on one-day cricket. India are confident and they know their game well. It is important to protect Test cricket, but ODIs and World Cups are very important as well. India know the ODI game very well. It is a challenge for other teams to come over to India and play well. I like them to be challenged, but India are a quality team.They have quality players, there is no doubt about it. Test cricket needs India to be strong. They have got the batting lineup and the bowlers. They just need to make sure that their second-tier bowlers, who bowl around Bumrah, have the quality.",Glenn McGrath backs Jasprit Bumrah to make a strong comeback from back injury.

NEW DELHI: Bruno Fernandes delivered a sensational performance as Manchester United stormed into the Europa League quarter-finals with a 4-1 victory over Real Sociedad at Old Trafford, securing a 5-2 aggregate win.Fernandes opened the scoring from the penalty spot in the 10th minute and added another in the 50th, again from 12 yards, after converting in the 16th minute as well. Real Sociedad, reduced to 10 men following Jon Aramburu’s red card just after the hour mark, couldn’t hold off the pressure.Fernandes completed his hat-trick with a rifled finish in the 87th minute, and Diogo Dalot added a stoppage-time goal to seal the emphatic result. “We need to help him win titles, because he deserves it,” Manchester United manager Ruben Amorim told TNT Sports, praising his captain.He added, “It was a good performance. The physicality was there... Even without the sending-off, you felt that the team were going to win this game.” United will face Lyon in the next round.Tottenham Hotspur also progressed to the Europa League last eight after turning around a first-leg deficit to beat AZ Alkmaar 3-2 on aggregate. Wilson Odobert got the hosts level on aggregate with a 26th-minute strike, taking advantage of sloppy defending from the Dutch side.Three minutes into the second half, James Maddison fired in a composed finish to put Spurs 2-0 up on the night. Peer Koopmeiners brought AZ back into the tie after the hour mark, but Odobert’s second goal in the 74th minute secured a 3-1 win on the night and sent Tottenham through.“We’ve progressed, which is the main thing,” said Spurs boss Ange Postecoglou. “We played pretty well, I thought we were really in control of the game, but we were our own worst enemies at times. It got a bit nervy towards the end but we thoroughly deserved to progress.” Spurs will meet Eintracht Frankfurt in the quarter-finals.Meanwhile, Rangers pulled off a dramatic shootout win over Jose Mourinho’s Fenerbahce in the Europa Conference League. After a 3-1 defeat in Istanbul, the Turkish side fought back in Glasgow with two goals from Polish winger Sebastian Szymanski in the 45th and 73rd minutes, levelling the aggregate score at 3-3 and sending the tie to extra time.However, three missed penalties in the shootout saw Rangers advance 3-2. Mourinho was vocal in his frustration after the match. “We deserved to win over 90 minutes, we deserved to win after 120 minutes, we were the best team by far,” he said.“We did everything to win. The ref and the VAR decided that we should go to penalties. Congratulations to Rangers but I think my team deserves everything from me, from our supporters and even from Turkey as a country.” Rangers will face Athletic Bilbao next.Chelsea also secured their spot in the quarter-finals of the Europa Conference League with a narrow 1-0 home win over Copenhagen, finishing 3-1 on aggregate. Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall scored the only goal of the night 10 minutes into the second half at Stamford Bridge, ensuring progression for the Blues.Elsewhere, Athletic Bilbao staged a comeback to eliminate Roma 4-3 on aggregate, powered by a vital brace from Euro 2024 winner Nico Williams. Roma’s hopes were dented early by a red card to centre-half Mats Hummels. Lazio, however, had better fortunes, drawing 1-1 with Viktoria Plzen at home to progress 3-2 overall.In Frankfurt, Mario Goetze bagged a brace as Eintracht thrashed Ajax 4-1, completing a dominant 6-2 aggregate win. Lyon also impressed, smashing Romanian side FCSB 4-0 at home to seal a commanding 7-1 victory over two legs.Olympiakos edged Bodo/Glimt 2-1 in Athens, but the Norwegians advanced with a 4-2 aggregate margin. Fiorentina, runners-up in both 2023 and 2024, overturned a first-leg deficit to beat Panathinaikos 3-1 in Tuscany, securing a 5-4 win on aggregate.Finally, Celje of Slovenia advanced after a wild night in Switzerland against Lugano. Despite losing 5-4 to 10-man Lugano in regular time, Celje held their nerve in the penalty shootout to secure a place in the last eight.",Bruno Fernandes scores hat-trick as Manchester United beat Real Sociedad 4-1.

Madison Keys powered into the Indian Wells semifinals on Thursday, dismantling wild-card Belinda Bencic 6-1, 6-1 in just 65 minutes to notch her 16th straight victory. The fifth-seeded American, who claimed the Australian Open title earlier this year, now sets up a highly anticipated rematch with world No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka . The two last met at Melbourne Park in January, where Keys defeated Sabalenka in a three-set battle, halting the Belarusian’s bid for a third straight title.Despite upsetting No. 4 seed Coco Gauff in the previous round, Bencic — a 28-year-old from Switzerland — had no answers for Keys’ relentless play.Elsewhere in the women’s draw, defending champion Iga Swiatek continued her dominant run in the California desert, advancing to her fourth straight semifinal at Indian Wells with a 6-3, 6-3 win over eighth-seeded Qinwen Zheng. Swiatek, the No. 2 seed and a five-time Grand Slam winner, is aiming to become the first woman to win the event three times. She’s riding a 10-match win streak at Indian Wells, having also lifted the trophy in 2022.Zheng, who had ended Swiatek’s 25-match winning streak at the Paris Olympics last year, couldn’t replicate that magic. Though she broke Swiatek twice and won six games — equaling the total games Swiatek had lost all tournament — the Polish star converted all five of her break points to seal the match.In the men’s draw, Daniil Medvedev battled past rising French talent Arthur Fils to reach the semifinals for a third straight year. The 29-year-old Russian, seeded fifth, came through a tense 6-4, 2-6, 7-6(7) win in two hours and 25 minutes. The third set featured a brief pause when swirling winds scattered debris across the court, but Medvedev stayed composed to close it out in a tiebreak.Meanwhile, 22-year-old Ben Shelton’s impressive run came to an end in the quarterfinals. He was the youngest American man to make it this far at Indian Wells since 2004, but Jack Draper of England halted his momentum with a 6-4, 7-5 win to book a semifinal spot.Also advancing were Holger Rune , who rallied for a 5-7, 6-0, 6-3 victory over Tallon Griekspoor to reach his first Indian Wells semifinal, and 16-year-old Mirra Andreeva, who defeated Elina Svitolina 7-5, 6-3 to secure a place in the women's last four.","Madison Keys defeated wild-card Belinda Bencic in straight sets to reach the semifinals at Indian Wells.

Is Anurag Thakur's hat in BFI ring the prelude to a shot at IOA presidency?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/more-sports/others/is-anurag-thakurs-hat-in-bfi-ring-the-prelude-to-a-shot-at-ioa-presidency/articleshow/119001251.cms,"Anurag Thakur (PTI Photo)

With IOA polls next year, this could be ex-sports min’s Queen’s gambit

NEW DELHI: It was business as usual in Indian sport till about a week ago, when a former sports minister declared his intention to contest the elections of a national federation. Emerging from somewhat of a hiatus in sport administration, Anurag Thakur , senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader and former Union minister, submitted his nomination to contest the Boxing Federation of India ’s (BFI) elections for a prospective president’s position. The move caused observers of Indian sports to sit up and take notice.If elected, what would have prompted a former Union minister to vie for a federation’s presidency, a post that would potentially entail seeking directions from a sports secretary or director general (DG) of the Sports Authority of India (SAI) during the NSFs meeting?Last month, the BFI had been suspended and brought under administration by the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) president, former Olympian PT Usha , in a move that was seen as controversial. Her detractors within the IOA alleged that she had acted without consulting her executive committee (EC). After golf, wrestling and the Bihar state Olympic Association, it was another instance of a sports body being suspended as directed by the IOA under Usha.For her part, Usha had alleged that BFI — under the presidency of Ajay Singh — had, among other things such as failing to send participants to prestigious international tournaments or drawing up a roadmap for the next Olympic cycle, failed to conduct elections in time, making the suspension necessary.The courts soon overruled the suspension and asked for elections to be announced. However, even as all this looked like a win for Ajay Singh, this is probably where the ball began rolling.That the EC of the IOA is split down the middle is a little-kept secret in sports circles for a while now. Recurring conflicts over decision-making, functioning and interference have pit the current IOA president on one side and her EC on the other. While she has alleged that members within the EC have made it difficult for her to function, Usha’s recurring conflicts with her own members, the sports ministry and NSFs regarding ad-hoc committee appointments have been seen as high-handed.With the government working seriously to bring the 2036 Olympics to India, a divided house in the IOA, despite both sides owing allegiance to the ruling dispensation, is hardly the best optics.With the IOA elections scheduled in 2026, the timing of Thakur’s candidature — even if his nomination was rejected by the Ajay Singh dispensation on the grounds that it was in violation of the sports code — serves as a pathway towards pursuing the IOA presidency next year.According to clause 4.1 of IOA’s election byelaws, individuals duly affiliated with IOA as member NSF under Article 10 of the constitution possess the right to contest and vote in office bearer elections. Consequently, eligibility for national Olympic committee’s elections requires current position as an elected office-bearer of an NSF, contextualising Thakur’s BFI presidential aspirations.It must be noted that Thakur was the sports minister and Usha the IOA chief when India’s women wrestlers staged a prolonged sit-in protest at Jantar Mantar in 2023 against five-time MP and Wrestling Federation of India ’s (WFI) former president, Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, who faced accusations of sexually harassing female grapplers.With Thakur, and all his previous experience as nominated and executive committee member in various NSFs, potentially in the fray, it is also being seen as a quiet phasing out of forces in the IOA. Removing a distinguished athlete like Usha mid-tenure would prove problematic, necessitating an experienced successor for the subsequent election. Thakur’s return suddenly ticks all the boxes.",Anurag Thakur is a senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader and former Union minister.

NEW DELHI: The All England Open witnessed a major upset on Wednesday when former badminton world number one Viktor Axelsen suffered a surprising first-round exit at the hands of Taiwan's Lin Chun-yi . Despite a closely contested opening game, Axelsen dominated the second game, raising expectations of a potential comeback.However, the Dane failed to maintain his form in the decider, as Lin Chun-yi went on a six-point streak, ultimately securing a 21-19, 13-21, 21-11 victory.Axelsen, currently ranked fourth in the world, acknowledged the unpredictability of the sport, stating, ""If I don't play my best, everyone can win against me.""He credited his opponent's exceptional performance while expressing disappointment with his own display.""Today's opponent played a fantastic game, it was disappointing but that is how it is.

Champions Return: Rohit, Hardik, Shreyas, Gambhir return after India's title triumph

NEW DELHI: Pakistan cricket has once again found itself in the middle of controversy and chaos following its first-round exit from the Champions Trophy 2025 — a tournament they were hosting on home soil after 29 years.The disappointment has not only triggered fan outrage but also exposed deep divisions among past and present coaching figures. Mickey Arthur , who led Pakistan during one of their more successful white-ball phases, was brutally honest in his criticism. Speaking to talkSport, Arthur said, “I love this quote, to be brutally honest. Jason Gillespie is a wonderful coach, wonderful man. Pakistan cricket just continues to shoot itself in the foot. It is its worst enemy.”Arthur believes Pakistan had made the right moves by appointing Jason Gillespie and Gary Kirsten to helm the red-ball and white-ball squads, respectively.However, he expressed regret at the ongoing instability that continues to plague the system. “There are so many good players; they’ve got the resources now; there's so much young talent. They have incredible skill. And yet, it's still so chaotic. It's really disappointing to see.”In a sharp rebuttal to Aaqib Javed’s comments blaming Pakistan’s recent struggles on “too many changes”, Gillespie accused the newly appointed coach of trying to “undermine them” and even called Javed a “clown.”Arthur echoed those concerns, pointing to deeper issues in Pakistan’s cricketing structure. “They had got some really good coaches who could take them forward. But then that machine that works in Pakistan just keeps undermining, and agendas are driven in the media,” he said.ALSO SEE: Jason Gillespie calls Pakistan's Aaqib Javed a 'clown' “It's a jungle out there and I feel desperately sorry for Gary and Jason.

ICC defends protocol as controversy erupts over missing Pakistani representative

India win Champions Trophy title; Rohit Sharma confirms he's not retiring

Former Pakistan wicketkeeper-batter Kamran Akmal has stirred controversy with his blunt remarks regarding the absence of a representative from host nation Pakistan during the prize distribution ceremony of the recently concluded ICC Champions Trophy Akmal asserted that Pakistan did not ""deserve"" to have a representative on stage, citing the team's poor performance and lack of respect on the international stage.""The ICC showed us the mirror,"" Akmal said on his YouTube channel. ""The tournament's director (Sumair) was there. He was available, and why wasn't he in the ceremony? It is because we don't deserve to be there. We are not playing good cricket. Minow teams have shown us the mirror.""He further expressed his disappointment with the current state of Pakistan cricket, adding, ""No one discussed how Pakistan hosted the tournament. If we play such cricket, we will be treated like this. If you play for yourself, there will be no respect.""The controversy erupted when Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chief executive and Champions Trophy tournament director Sumair Ahmad Syed, who was present at the venue in Dubai, was not invited on stage for the final presentation. India clinched the Champions Trophy title for the third time by defeating New Zealand by four wickets, but Pakistan's absence from the ceremonial proceedings drew widespread criticism back home.The PCB lodged a formal complaint with the International Cricket Council (ICC), calling the incident ""unacceptable."" A PCB official was quoted by PTI as stating, ""We have filed a formal complaint with the ICC as what happened is unacceptable to us.""ALSO SEE: 'Pakistan is its worst enemy': Former coach Mickey Arthur backs Jason Gillespie after ‘clown’ jab at Aaqib Javed However, ICC sources have reportedly dismissed the complaint, indicating that the PCB is unlikely to receive a formal explanation or apology. The ICC maintained that the protocol did not mandate the presence of the tournament director on stage.Responding to the criticism, an ICC source explained to PTI, ""If the PCB mandarins look up, even ICC CEO Geoff Allardice wasn't present on stage.

NEW DELHI: Carlos Alcaraz , the two-time defending champion, showcased his dominance at the ATP Indian Wells Masters on Wednesday. The world number three from Spain overcame the challenging windy conditions on Stadium Court to deliver a commanding performance against Grigor Dimitrov , defeating him 6-1, 6-1.Alcaraz's victory denied Dimitrov's bid to join Canadian Felix Auger-Aliassime as the only players to beat the Spaniard in three consecutive meetings.

Alcaraz didn't face a break point until the fifth game of the second set, but he overcame that challenge with an ace on Dimitrov's third break chance. Alcaraz then broke the Bulgarian's serve to take a 5-1 lead.Alcaraz sealed the victory in style, earning a match point with his sixth ace of the match and clinching the win with a forehand winner.

NEW DELHI: In the quiet, black-and-white corridors of chess , where the ticking clock echoes louder than the heartbeat, Koneru Humpy remains seated like an ancient banyan tree — rooted, rigid, and regal.Behind her stillness stays the tremors of sacrifice as the real championship for India’s top-ranked woman in chess isn't always over 64 squares.""I do miss my daughter a lot,” she tellsduring an exclusive interaction. ""Our tournaments last 15–20 days, and I travel often. She enjoys her stay with grandparents when I am away. So that way I'm fortunate that they're very close to her, and she gets all the attention which is needed.""Humpy, two-time World Rapid Champion, became a chess Grandmaster in 2002 at the age of 15.At that time, she was the youngest woman to achieve the title, making him no stranger to medals or media glare — the most recent one after she was made the brand ambassador for the SOG Grandmaster Series.Life runs at a rapid pace when you are winning, in general. For Humpy, 2014 marked the start of a new journey — her marriage with Anvesh Dasari . A few years later, they were blessed with a baby girl, Ahana.Her commitment toward her child and family kept her away from the game for some time.""I still remember when I won the 2019 World Rapid Championship, I hadn't been playing for nearly one and a half years,"" Humpy says. ""I took a break in 2017 and started playing again around November or December 2018. When I came back to chess, practice and preparation were there, but I had become a much tougher person. You know, raising a child meant sleepless nights. I learned I'm even capable of doing the work without having a proper food. Earlier, that wasn't the case — if something went wrong, it would immediately affect my performance. But motherhood helped me adjust to all of that and made me mentally tougher.""Motherhood, for Humpy, was never a distraction as she continues to wear it not like a weight, but like armor.""I always feel motherhood is a strength. It cannot make you sidestep your profession,"" she accepts with a grin.As a child prodigy from Vijayawada, a small city in Andhra Pradesh, Humpy didn't have grand academies or training partners on call.What she had was a father looking after his child.Back then, it was Humpy's father who would help a budding chess star — someone who rarely showed interest in poring over dense books filled with opening theories or classic moves — as she prepared for upcoming tournaments.""I'm not a book reader at all. I'd love to read on a laptop or a tab, but not in books,"" she laughs. ""During my childhood, my dad used to do all the preparation — he would get those books, have them copied, and make separate bindings with the lines to play and all that. I was never into that kind of work. It was only after 2012 that I started preparing on my own. But by then, we were already used to laptops and software.""In a society that often romanticises maternal sacrifice into silence, here is a mother, who continues to redefine ambition, by not choosing between motherhood and mastery.As for her daughter, there is no checkmate path mapped out.""I never want to pressurise her,"" Humpy tells. ""For me, it's about letting her do what she enjoys, whatever profession she wants to pursue — it's fine. I just want her to grow up as a positive person. That's more important to me than which profession she chooses.""In a country now experiencing a chess renaissance, Koneru Humpy remains an epitome of calmness. ""As for staying calm under pressure, I think it comes naturally to me. Even as a child, I was like that. People often say they couldn't tell whether I won or lost a game because I always maintained the same calm,"" she adds.Behind her calm demeanour lies a strict routine: ""sleep early, wake up early, and that helps me stay composed and well-prepared"".""During tournaments, I prefer going for walks to get fresh air since we spend most of our time indoors. When I'm at home, I make sure to go to the gym every day to maintain physical fitness. Yoga is great, of course, but I personally enjoy more physical activity, especially because we sit for long hours while playing,"" she continues.The 37-year-old GM readies her bid for the Women's Grand Prix in Pune (April 13-24), Norway Chess (May 26-June 6), then the World Cup (July 5-29) in Georgia.""I think I definitely need to change my strategy for the World Cup because it's a knockout tournament. But I'll focus on that after I complete these two classical events—Norway Chess and the Grand Prix. Probably after Norway, I'll start preparing specifically for the knockout format. Yes, I need to do something different for that,"" says a mother on a mission.In a world with kids learning the Sicilian Defence before the alphabet, Koneru Humpy comes across as a pillar, a mother who seems reluctant to make motherhood her excuse.",Koneru Humpy is India's top-ranked woman in chess. The 37-year-old is a two-time World Rapid Champion. Humpy became a chess Grandmaster in 2002 at the age of 15.

Former Pakistan all-rounder Imad Wasim has lashed out at the national cricket team's outdated playing style following their disappointing performance in the recently concluded ICC Champions Trophy . As hosts, Pakistan finished last in Group A after a winless campaign, suffering heavy defeats to finalists New Zealand and eventual champions India. Their only point came from a washed-out match against Bangladesh, but they still finished below Bangladesh due to an inferior net run rate.Imad, who retired from international cricket, expressed his frustration in a video clip shared by an X user, admitting that he often feels reluctant to watch Pakistan play. ""So you got to play cricket. Cricket, like it should be played. This is not the right way for me, if you ask me as a cricketer — not even as a Pakistani, just as a cricketer. I watch some of the games the Pakistan team play, and I feel I just don't want to watch it, but I have to watch it. Eventually, people will lose interest, and they won't come to watch cricket if we keep playing like this,"" he said.The former all-rounder criticised Pakistan's cautious and outdated approach, pointing out that modern cricket requires a more aggressive and proactive mindset. He argued that teams like England and Australia have set a new standard that Pakistan has failed to follow.""So you see England, Australia — or cricket I can understand — the solution I'm telling you I can understand. Your first instinct should be to go out there and attack the opposition. And if you lose wickets, then you assess the conditions — okay, this is a 250, 260, 300 wicket — whatever. But your first instinct should just be to go out there and attack, not to think, ‘Let's score 250.' We are way behind where the world is,"" Imad said.Reflecting on his earlier warnings that were ignored, Imad revealed that his calls for change were often met with ridicule. ""Well, I've been saying this for years, and people were laughing at me. Firstly, when I started saying these things, even in the team meetings, I used to say these things. The world is going on a different path, and we are playing the same way,"" he lamented.Imad's harsh critique echoes the sentiments of frustrated fans and cricket experts who believe Pakistan's reluctance to modernise their style is holding them back on the global stage. Despite being tournament hosts, Pakistan's performance drew heavy criticism, and many are calling for a complete overhaul of their cricketing approach to keep pace with the evolving demands of international cricket.","Former Pakistan all-rounder Imad Wasim has lashed out at the national cricket team's outdated playing style.

But also, the core of the team is here. And that's our responsibility, coach, myself, Venky sir to go back into the auction and try our best to get back.

I was the happiest person on the planet to know that someone like him showed that interest to buy a team in the Caribbean. But not only in the Caribbean, but my hometown. And I was able to help build Trinbago Knight Riders, one of, to this day, the most successful franchises in CPL history,"" Bravo said.""That energy and that vibe, I am going to try to bring that here as well.

Will Rohit Sharma win 2027 World Cup? Astrologer Lobo predicts after getting Champions Trophy bang on!

NEW DELHI: Newly appointed vice-captain Venkatesh Iyer remains unfazed by the pressure of his auction price, focusing solely on delivering for Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) in the upcoming IPL season .The dynamic all-rounder said he cannot ignore the scrutiny surrounding his mega price tag but emphasised that price tags don’t define performance and that his priority is contributing to KKR’s success. Iyer, who has been a key player for the franchise, is determined to make a strong impact this season.Iyer, the left-handed batter and occasional medium pacer, was one of the biggest buys in the IPL 2025 auction , securing a staggering Rs 23.75 crore deal — over 11 times his base price. KKR went all out, using their Right to Match (RTM) card to bring him back after an intense bidding war with Royal Challengers Bengaluru.With his explosive batting and handy bowling, he aims to play a crucial role in KKR’s campaign. Confident in his preparation, Iyer is ready to embrace the challenges ahead and help his team chase IPL glory.Acknowledging the hype around his price tag, Iyer admitted it’s impossible to ignore. ""Obviously, you can't completely block it out. Wherever I go, people ask me about it,"" he said at KKR’s pre-season media interaction at Eden Gardens.""But for me, it’s about absorbing the expectations and fulfilling the responsibility given to me.""Iyer believes that once the season gets underway, the numbers will be irrelevant.""When the IPL begins, what truly matters is being part of a team aiming to win,"" he said. ""It doesn’t matter how much you were bought for; if you’re on the field, you're expected to perform.""He emphasized that success isn’t just about runs or wickets but also about carrying oneself well and embracing responsibility. ""Pressure will always exist, whether it’s about selection, batting order, bowling, or fielding. It's up to me how I absorb and handle it,"" said Iyer, who has been a key player for KKR since his debut.Across 50 IPL matches, Iyer has amassed 1,326 runs, including a century and 11 half-centuries. He played a vital role in KKR’s 2024 title-winning campaign, scoring 370 runs at an average of 46.25 and a strike rate of over 158.KKR’s newly appointed captain, Ajinkya Rahane , dismissed the ongoing chatter around Iyer’s hefty auction price, firmly stating that he was worth every penny.""Venkatesh Iyer deserved that price,"" Rahane said. ""People keep talking about it, but he has delivered for his franchise on multiple occasions. He earned that deal.""Rahane, who went unsold in the initial rounds of the auction before KKR picked him for Rs 1.5 crore, is set to lead the franchise in IPL 2025.The veteran batter, who has played 185 IPL matches and over 200 international games, recently underwent a transformation in his batting. He topped the run charts in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy, scoring 469 runs at an average of 58.62 and a strike rate of over 164, helping Mumbai clinch the title.Despite being 36, Rahane remains committed to extending his playing career, focusing on the present rather than thinking too far ahead.""My goal is to play as long as possible, but right now, my focus is on this tournament,"" he said, reiterating that his hunger for an international comeback is still alive.""I believe in staying in the moment, giving my best every day, and pushing beyond 100 percent. I don’t dwell on the past or worry about the future—fitness and performance are my priorities.""Asked about rumors linking him to KKR’s captaincy before the official announcement, Rahane said, ""I only heard it from you guys while I was playing domestic cricket.""Calling it an honor to lead KKR, he acknowledged the franchise’s rich history and the responsibility that comes with defending the title.""Winning in this format is tough, and every match presents a new challenge,"" Rahane said. ""One over can change the game, so our approach must be consistent, giving our best every single day.""He also laid out his expectations from his team.""As captain, I only ask for good intent, the right attitude, and a team-first mentality. We have a well-balanced squad, and most of our players are highly experienced. I’m confident we’ll put up a strong fight this season.""With KKR aiming to defend their IPL crown, both Iyer and Rahane are gearing up for a crucial season, ready to take on new challenges and deliver for the team.",Venkatesh Iyer was one of the biggest buys in the IPL 2025 auction.

The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has found itself at the center of controversy after ordering a review of its decision to reduce match fees for players and reserves participating in the National T20 Championship . PCB chairman Mohsin Naqvi directed the review following a strong backlash from cricket circles, with many questioning whether the board was facing financial difficulties.The fee cuts, implemented by the PCB’s domestic department, sparked widespread criticism, leaving fans and analysts wondering about the board’s financial stability. Additionally, as per PTI, reports have surfaced suggesting that other cost-cutting measures have impacted domestic cricket , including reductions in hotel and travel standards and the termination of player contracts. PCB sources indicate that these cuts were necessitated by the inclusion of several new domestic events not initially budgeted for this season.The board's domestic cricket operations have already faced scrutiny after abruptly halting the National Under-19 Championship just one day after it began, citing issues related to over-age players and other selection problems. Meanwhile, the National Junior Championship, considered a vital platform for emerging talent, has yet to be scheduled.Amidst the turbulence, former Pakistan captain Babar Azam has opted out of the National T20 Championship, along with fast bowler Naseem Shah . Although both players were initially expected to participate after being dropped from the T20 squad for the upcoming series against New Zealand, they cited workload management and international commitments as reasons for their withdrawal.Babar's absence has raised eyebrows, given that the PCB had previously announced his participation alongside Muhammad Rizwan and Naseem Shah. Insiders speculate that the decision may be influenced by the Pakistan Super League (PSL), which is set to begin in mid-April.As per a PTI report citing a reliable PCB source, players like Babar and Naseem might be prioritising PSL performances, as they know that strong showings in the franchise league could easily secure their return to the national T20 squad.Interestingly, Babar Azam, one of Pakistan’s most prominent cricketers, has not played a domestic first-class match since 2020.","PCB chairman Mohsin Naqvi has ordered a review of match fees for players and reserves participating in the National T20 Championship.

In a viral clip of the Pakistan show 'Game on Hai', Hafeez asserted that Razzaq's performances and potential far outweighed those of Pandya, despite the latter being an integral part of India’s setup.Hafeez pointed out that although Razzaq was limited in his skills and did not push his potential to the fullest, his contributions as an all-rounder surpassed Pandya's. He remarked, ""You take out the details of Abdul Razzaq's performances. He was a better and bigger performer. But the system didn't look after him, and the player also didn't respond that much. Whatever I've seen of Razzaq, he was better than this version of Hardik.""Despite Pandya's consistent contributions with bat and ball for India in crucial matches, recently in the ICC Champions Trophy , Hafeez and legendary pacer Shoaib Akhtar believe that Pandya lacks the skill set of a genuine fast bowler.Akhtar, echoing Hafeez’s sentiments, said, ""Hardik is no Marshall, Waqar, Lee, or Srinath. It's just his mindset. You throw him the new ball, he does it. You ask him to bowl in the middle, he does it. However, he is not that powerful a hitter also. He had given that belief that the world is your stage. The market allows you to become big.""The Rawalpindi Express also highlighted how Razzaq never received the recognition he truly deserved despite his versatile performances for Pakistan. He recalled a memorable instance from 2010, when Razzaq single-handedly took down South Africa with a blistering century, saying, ""He was hitting the ball so hard that day that I thought if the ball came towards me, it would go through me.""Akhtar added that not only Razzaq but also Azhar Mahmood, another talented all-rounder, lacked the respect they deserved. ""We didn't give him the respect, and neither did we give Azhar Mahmood the respect that he deserved. He was a great performer with the ball.""",Mohammad Hafeez says Abdul Razzaq was a better all-rounder than Hardik Pandya. The former Pakistan captain believes that Pandya lacks the skill set of a genuine fast bowler. Shoaib Akhtar also believes that Razzaqu and Azhar Mahmood did not get the respect they deserved.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118978779,imgsize-67934,width-400,resizemode-4/118978779.jpg"

Champions Return: Rohit, Hardik, Shreyas, Gambhir return after India's title triumph

NEW DELHI: Former Indian cricketer Aakash Chopra suggests that Ishan Kishan has a significant chance to reinvigorate his career in IPL 2025 , following his acquisition by Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) at the mega auction.Chopra noted his bewilderment regarding Kishan's absence from national selection discussions, considering his demonstrated batting capabilities.""For whatever reason, he has completely disappeared from the radar. It seems like no one is talking about him or understanding his importance. He even played in the Ranji Trophy and scored runs there, he is doing everything, but no one is even talking about him,"" Chopra said on his YouTube channel.Following his release from Mumbai Indians (MI), SRH secured Kishan for Rs 11.25 crore during the IPL auction in November. SRH's current opening partnership of Abhishek Sharma and Travis Head, who demonstrated exceptional performance last season, suggests Kishan might need to adapt to the number three position, which differs from his usual role.Although Kishan achieved a notable ODI double century (210 off 131 balls) against Bangladesh in December 2022, he subsequently lost his position in the playing XI to Shubman Gill as opener. Since then, he has found it difficult to secure a position across all formats.In terms of wicketkeeper-batsmen, the national team has favoured Rishabh Pant KL Rahul , and Sanju Samson for international matches. Additionally, Kishan no longer holds a BCCI central contract.""You can come into reckoning once again. A keeper-batter who can open or bat in the top order, that is beautiful. Gautam (Gambhir) is anyway saying that they are all bogeys in a train; everyone has to go to the same destination, and it doesn't make a difference whether a bogey is in front or at the back. That basically means batting order does not exist in Indian cricket anymore,"" Chopra elaborated.","Former Indian cricketer Aakash Chopra suggests Ishan Kishan has a significant chance to reinvigorate his career in IPL 2025.

UEFA announced on Thursday that it will consider a potential rule revision following the controversial disallowance of Atletico Madrid forward Julian Alvarez's penalty in their Champions League shootout loss to Real Madrid.Real Madrid secured a 4-2 shootout victory after a 2-2 aggregate draw, but Atletico coach Diego Simeone expressed doubts over the decision to rule out Alvarez’s goal.The Argentina international was deemed by VAR to have unintentionally touched the ball twice—first with his standing foot as he slipped, before striking it into the net.""Although minimal, the player made contact with the ball using his standing foot before kicking it,"" UEFA stated. ""Under the current rule, the VAR had to call the referee, signaling that the goal should be disallowed.""In light of the controversy, UEFA confirmed plans to engage in discussions with FIFA and the International Football Association Board ( IFAB ) to review the rule on unintentional double touches during penalties.""UEFA will enter discussions with FIFA and IFAB to determine whether the rule should be reviewed in cases where a double touch is clearly unintentional,"" the statement added.Simeone, addressing the press, said he wanted to believe the officials had made the correct decision but remained skeptical. He challenged journalists to confirm whether they had seen a replay clearly showing Alvarez’s double touch.""Raise your hand, anyone who saw Julian touch it twice. Who is going to raise their hand? Nobody has raised their hand,"" Simeone remarked, emphasizing his frustration with the ruling.With UEFA now considering a review, potential changes to the penalty rule could be on the horizon in future competitions.",UEFA will consider a potential rule revision following the disallowance of Atletico Madrid forward Julian Alvarez's penalty in their Champions League loss to Real Madrid.

The penalty was disallowed after a VAR review for a supposed double touch on the ball.Simeone expressed his pride in his team's performance, despite the controversial penalty decision. ""But beyond that, which now just serves to argue about whether it should have counted or not, I am proud of my players, I am happy, truly,"" he said. He acknowledged that they couldn’t defeat Real Madrid but added, ""They had a really bad time (against us) again.""The Atletico coach further questioned the VAR decision , stating, ""The referee said when Julian got to the penalty spot he touched the ball with his standing foot, but the ball did not move."" He added that he wanted to believe the officials made the right call but asked the media, ""Raise your hand, anyone who saw Julian touch it twice, who is going to raise their hand?

""In the end it's a lottery, I felt a little that he had touched it twice, that's what I told the referee. It is clearly not easy to see, but it's a bit of bad luck for them there,"" Courtois explained.The Belgian goalkeeper criticised Atletico's complaints about the decision, while also commenting on his own club’s previous attacks on Spanish refereeing. ""I think UEFA saw it clearly – I'm sick of this victimhood, always crying about stuff like this,"" Courtois said. ""The refs don't want to help particular teams, not in Spain, not in Europe.""Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti also supported the VAR decision. ""They detected it.

NEW DELHI: Brazilian football legend Ronaldo , who is also a two-time World Cup winner, has withdrawn his intention to run for the presidency of the Brazilian Football Confederation (CBF) due to a lack of support from regional federations.In a social media post, the two-time Ballon d'Or winner stated that after publicly expressing his desire to become a candidate for the CBF presidency, he has officially withdrawn his intention.Ronaldo cited the lack of support from the majority of those with the power to decide as the reason for his withdrawal, stating that if they feel football is in good hands, his opinion does not matter.""After publicly declaring my desire to be a candidate for the presidency of the CBF during the next election, I'm officially withdrawing this intention. If the majority of those who have the power to decide feel that football is in good hands, it doesn't matter what I think,"" said Ronaldo.The 48-year-old had previously announced his intention to take the reins of the CBF in December, aiming to address what he perceived as a ""deep crisis"" in Brazilian football.However, Ronaldo revealed that 23 out of the 27 regional federations representing the various states of Brazil refused to listen to his proposals. Instead, they expressed their support for the re-election of the current CBF president, Ednaldo Rodrigues , in 2026.Rodrigues has faced criticism for his handling of the national team's coaching situation after Tite's departure following Brazil's quarter-final exit at the 2022 World Cup.Initially, Rodrigues pursued the appointment of Carlo Ancelotti, but the Italian coach ultimately decided to remain with Real Madrid. Eventually, Dorival Junior was appointed as the national team coach at the start of last year.Despite his illustrious career and desire to contribute to Brazilian football, Ronaldo's bid for the CBF presidency has been thwarted by the lack of support from the regional federations, who appear to favour the incumbent president's re-election.","Ronaldo has withdrawn his intention to run for the presidency of the Brazilian Football Confederation.

The good and not so good about Sunil Chhetri's comeback,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/the-good-and-not-so-good-about-sunil-chhetris-comeback/articleshow/118923372.cms,"Sunil Chhetri (Photo: @chetrisunil11 on X)

TimesofIndia.com

NEW DELHI: “SUNIL CHHETRI IS BACK,” announced the All India Football Federation (AIFF) on their official X (formerly Twitter) account almost a week ago. The all-caps post of Chhetri's return included an Indian flag and a message: “The captain, leader, legend will return to the Indian national team for the FIFA International Window in March.”What followed was a storm of reactions — of all kinds — across social media, with many understandably delighted to see the return of Indian football ’s golden boy; others questioned the value of the long-form tributes written after his retirement, wondering what they meant now.While some saw it as a glimmer of hope in a bleak phase for Indian football, others asked some pressing questions: Why hasn’t Indian football produced another Sunil Chhetri ? Why couldn't India develop a worthy successor while Chhetri was still on the field? In a country of 1.4 billion, is that too much to ask?“There was a time when people wondered who could replace Bhaichung Bhutia. Eventually, we found a successor in Sunil. And similarly, Sunil too will be replaced, but it will take time. Everyone just needs to be patient,"" said Mehtab Hossain, former India international with 30 caps, many of them alongside Chhetri, in an exclusive chat with""If you look at countries in Africa or South America — excluding Europe, many of them barely have proper infrastructure or even food security. But look at their football,"" he added. “Our government needs to step up to develop Indian football. It’s not enough to make lofty claims like having a vision for 2045 or 2050. It’s not about talking — it’s about doing.""Chhetri, for his part, has kept mum on his dramatic return to the international fold.But the theory doing the rounds is that Indian football's poor run — no wins in five matches since his retirement — has fueled his comeback.“When he announced his retirement, my first thought was that he’d had a beautiful career, and it was time for him to move on. I wished him the best,” recalled Robin Singh, Chhetri’s former teammate, who scored four goals in 24 appearances for India.Both Robin and Mehtab have seen Sunil's rise, fall and rise again through different phases of his career. And both believe his return can only help Indian football.“I'm excited to see him play at the highest level again for the national team. Hopefully, he can carry over the form he’s shown in the league this season and replicate that for the country,” said Robin, referencing Chhetri’s 12-goal haul from 24 matches in the 2024/25 Indian Super League season — second-best among all scorers in India's top-tier competition.Now 40, Chhetri is set to once again don the India jersey when the team faces Maldives on March 19, ahead of the AFC Asian Cup Qualification third-round clash against Bangladesh on March 25.And if he finds the net, it could take him a step closer to joining an elite club in world football — players with 100 international goals.Currently with a tally of 94 goals, Chhetri is in line to join the likes of legends Cristiano Ronaldo Lionel Messi and Ali Daei -- the only three players to have achieved the feat.Considering all the aspects, Chhetri’s return is an intriguing subplot for football fans across the globe.“I’m very happy because after Sunil’s departure, the Indian team hasn’t delivered great results. His return comes at the right time,” 39-year-old Mehtab remarked. “Maybe he won’t be at his peak anymore, but the leadership he brings can still lift the squad. Without Sunil, who’s the idol in this team now? He came back for the country — otherwise, there was no reason for him to return.”Yet, the question persists: If not Chhetri, then who?“I think the responsibility doesn’t lie with just one person or even just the national team. It’s up to the entire football fraternity to believe in the younger generation — players like Manvir Singh, Lallianzuala Chhangte, Vikram Partap Singh and Rahim Ali — who’ve shown they can be versatile,"" Robin opined.

Seven medical professionals faced trial on Tuesday for homicide charges related to their treatment of Argentine football icon Diego Maradona before his death.Maradona passed away on November 25, 2020, at age 60, whilst recovering from brain surgery at home. He had struggled with cocaine and alcohol dependencies for decades.The accused face potential prison sentences of eight to 25 years if found guilty of ""homicide with possible intent"", for allegedly continuing treatment despite knowing it could result in the footballer's death.Supporters gathered outside the courthouse on Tuesday, displaying banners demanding justice and singing tributes to their fallen hero.Veronica Ojeda, mother of Maradona's young son Dieguito, tearfully thanked the assembled crowd. His daughters, Dalma and Gianinna, entered silently.The prosecution presented their opening statement, promising substantial evidence that the medical team failed in their duties during Maradona's final days.Prosecutor Patricio Ferrari displayed a photograph of Maradona post-mortem, showing him supine with a distended abdomen.Maradona was discovered lifeless two weeks after surgery in a leased residence in an upscale Buenos Aires area, where he stayed after hospital discharge.Medical examination revealed death from cardiac failure and acute pulmonary oedema. His passing during the Covid-19 pandemic caused nationwide grief in Argentina.Thousands queued to pay respects as his body lay in state. The trial, featuring nearly 120 witnesses, is expected to continue until July.The defendants include various medical professionals. A separate jury trial awaits the day nurse who discovered Maradona's body.Prosecutors assert that recommending home care was negligent and inadequate, leaving Maradona in prolonged distress before death.A 2021 expert panel concluded proper medical facility care might have improved survival chances. The residence lacked basic emergency equipment like a defibrillator.Family representatives cite communications suggesting staff prioritised financial gain over proper care. The accused maintain their innocence.In Buenos Aires' La Paternal district, where ""El Pibe de Oro"" first displayed his talents, street art demands justice.

NEW DELHI: Mirra Andreeva ’s stunning rise in the WTA rankings has been so rapid that even the 17-year-old Russian admits she can’t quite keep up with it. Just last month in Dubai, she made history as the youngest-ever WTA 1000 champion , defeating both Grand Slam winners Iga Swiatek and Elena Rybakina on her way to the title — a win that catapulted her into the top 10 for the first time, landing at No. 9.Now at Indian Wells , Andreeva entered the tournament ranked 11th, but wins over Rybakina once again in the fourth round and Elina Svitolina in the quarter-finals are expected to lift her back into the top 10. Not that she’s been checking too closely.""Before, I was always checking live rankings because before I was playing for a dog,"" Andreeva said with a smile. ""So after every match I play I would check the live rankings to see if I did it.""That milestone — breaking into the top 20 — came after she defeated Magda Linette in Beijing last October.

""It's going to be a labrador mixed with poodle and it's ultra min, so going to be even smaller than a mini version. It's going to take time until the dog that I want will be born.""While rankings may not be her primary focus anymore, Andreeva is channeling her energy into what’s right in front of her — like an upcoming semi-final clash at Indian Wells against defending champion Swiatek. Despite her recent win over the Pole in Dubai, she’s not expecting it to give her any advantage.""It doesn't give me any benefit to our match (on Friday),"" she admitted.Tennis has become increasingly serious for the teenager, but she's not letting that take the fun out of the game completely. The young star, who draws inspiration from athletes like Roger Federer and LeBron James, is trying to balance focus with enjoyment.""When I was a bit younger it would all be about having fun,"" Andreeva said. ""But now I start to understand that it's pretty serious what I do out here.

NEW DELHI: Belinda Bencic produced a stunning comeback to upset world number three Coco Gauff on Wednesday, booking her place in the Indian Wells quarter-finals where she will face Australian Open champion Madison Keys .The Swiss star, who gave birth to her daughter Bella last April, triumphed 3-6, 6-3, 6-4 to reach her first WTA 1000 quarter-final since becoming a mother. Unranked when she returned to the tour in October, Bencic has steadily climbed back, capturing her ninth career title in Abu Dhabi last month and rising to 58th in the world this week.“I just kept on working also on the physical side,” Bencic said. “In the last matches in tournaments, I was able to play back-to-back, some three-set matches, and am fresher every time. The body is holding up much better, almost like it was before.”Bencic showed remarkable poise against Gauff, recovering from a first-set loss and keeping the American under constant pressure. Gauff, who had beaten Bencic at the Australian Open earlier this year, struggled with her forehand and gave away the crucial break with a loose return at 4-4 in the deciding set.Keys also had to fight back in her match, defeating Croatia’s Donna Vekic 4-6, 7-6 (9/7), 6-3. After failing to convert a set point in the second set and trailing 3-5 in the tiebreak, the American dug deep and eventually powered through, breaking twice in the third set to seal victory with a fierce backhand return.In the men’s draw, Ben Shelton downed Brandon Nakashima 7-6 (8/6), 6-1 to reach his third ATP Masters 1000 quarter-final. The 22-year-old became the youngest American in the Indian Wells last eight since Andy Roddick in 2004.Women’s world number one Aryna Sabalenka cruised past Sonay Kartal 6-1, 6-2 and will meet either Jasmine Paolini or Liudmila Samsonova in the quarters.","Belinda Bencic beats Coco Gauff to reach Indian Wells quarter-finals.

NEW DELHI: Holger Rune delivered one of the most jaw-dropping moments of Indian Wells 2025 on Tuesday, hitting a between-the-legs winner to save break point en route to a straight-sets victory over Stefanos Tsitsipas . But as thrilled as the crowd was, Rune was just as excited — at least until he saw the replay.""You know, I kind of had the expectation that I looked like Roger Federer when I hit it, and I didn't quite do that,"" Rune said with a laugh after his 6-4, 6-4 win. ""So that was disappointing.""The 21-year-old Dane’s flashy shot wasn’t just for show — it helped him knock off the world No. 9 and book a spot in the Indian Wells quarterfinals for the second consecutive year.It also marked Rune’s first quarterfinal appearance of 2025, a year that hasn’t quite lived up to expectations for the former world No. 4.After bursting onto the scene in 2022 with a memorable win over Novak Djokovic at the Paris Masters, Rune has struggled to maintain consistency, slipping to 13th in the rankings while contemporaries like Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner continue to climb.Still, Rune is staying focused, emphasising growth over frustration.""It's about making results, but at the same time improving your game and having stability,"" he said. ""Because I don't believe I have become the worse player the last two years. I actually think the opposite. I think I have become a better all-around player.""He admits falling short of expectations can sting. ""You know, when you have these expectations and you don't quite, like, live up to them, of course it's disappointing,"" he said.""But it's very basic and maybe it's very boring to say it, but I just love tennis .""So even not being satisfied with my results, I still love to go down to the practice court and hit forehands, backhands, work on my shots, my physicality ...

Indian Wells: Defending champion Iga Swiatek edged closer to an unprecedented third straight Indian Wells WTA title Sunday, overwhelming Dayana Yastremska 6-0, 6-2 to reach the fourth round.Swiatek's 65-minute victory set the tone on a day that saw Daniil Medvedev spend just 10 minutes on court before ailing opponent Alex Michelsen retired.Swiatek, the world number two from Poland, was in full control against hard-hitting Ukrainian Yastremska, swinging freely as she won the first 10 games.She converted six of her 11 break chances and didn't face a break point herself and it was virtually over by the time Yastremska got on the board with wins in her last two service games.""It's always hard to finish a match like that,"" Swiatek said. ""But I'm happy that I got my intensity up the last game and closed it with confidence.""Swiatek next faces Czech Karolina Muchova , who trailed 3-5 in the first set but won 10 of the next 11 games to beat compatriot Katerina Siniakova 7-5, 6-1.Russian 17-year-old Mirra Andreeva and 2023 Indian Wells champion Elena Rybakina joined Swiatek in dishing out bagels as they lined up a fourth-round clash.Andreeva, who triumphed in Dubai last month to become the youngest ever winner of a WTA 1000 event , beat Denmark's Clara Tauson 6-3, 6-0 in 63 minutes.Rybakina downed Britain's Katie Boulter 6-0, 7-5.Andreeva -- who beat Tauson in the final in Dubai -- said she found conditions on Stadium Court tougher than she made it look.""I'm just happy the way I managed to stay in the game,"" she said. ""I didn't give her much rhythm so I guess it was not bad -- but there's a lot of things to work on.""Women's fourth seed Jessica Pegula of the United States, fresh off her first WTA title of the year in Austin, was another quick winner, putting away China's Wang Xinyu 6-2, 6-1 in just 62 minutes.Pegula next faces Ukraine's Elina Svitolina, a 6-2, 6-4 winner over Danielle Collins.Medvedev headlined the men's lineup in the combined ATP Masters and WTA 1000 event, but he was barely underway when 20-year-old Michelson retired because of illness after dropping the first two games.""Food poisoning or something like this, these things happen,"" said Medvedev, who was headed to the practice courts to tune up for a fourth-round clash with 10th-seeded American Tommy Paul.Paul beat Britain's 2021 Indian Wells winner Cameron Norrie, now ranked 77th in the world, 6-3, 7-5.Eighth-seeded Stefanos Tsitsipas, coming off his first title in almost a year in Dubai, beat Matteo Berrettini 6-3, 6-3 in a rematch of their Dubai quarter-final last week.Tsitsipas dropped just eight points on his serve as he wrong-footed Italian with a variety of athletic shots, breaking him three times on the way to victory in 68 minutes.After months in the doldrums Tsitsipas said he was relishing a new mental approach to the game.""I just feel like I want to get out there on the court and be a gladiator, and that's how I approach every single match I get to play,"" he said.Tallon Griekspoor , the world No. 43 from the Netherlands who shocked world number two and top seed Alexander Zverev in the second round, backed up his big win with a 7-6 (7/3), 6-3 victory over France's 29th seed Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard.Griekspoor fired 10 aces, dominating the first set tiebreaker, and didn't face a break point in the second set.Griekspoor needed an hour and 16 minutes to secure the win, but in a season in which dropping the first set has become an alarming habit that was fast enough.""It feels nice to win a match in under one and a half hour,"" he said.","Defending champion Iga Swiatek beats Dayana Yastremska 6-0, 6-2 to reach fourth round.

Former world number one Novak Djokovic , who has won the Indian Wells ATP Masters five times, suffered a surprising defeat in his opening match on Saturday, going down to lucky loser Botic van de Zandschulp, while reigning champion Carlos Alcaraz progressed to the next round.The 24-time Grand Slam champion Djokovic lost 6-2, 3-6, 6-1.""No excuses for a poor performance,"" the Serb said after the match. ""It doesn't feel great when you play this way on the court. But congratulations to my opponent -- just a bad day in the office, I guess, for me.""Van de Zandschulp has established a notable record against the big guns.His impressive victories include a remarkable win against Alcaraz at the US Open in the previous year, followed by a triumph over Rafael Nadal in Davis Cup, which turned out to be the Spanish legend's final professional match.""I think I kept my cool during the whole match,” said van de Zandschulp. ""I know if I go into the match and lose my cool, especially against the big players, it's going to be a really tough day. That's always one thing I'm trying to do well.""Djokovic reduced his unforced errors significantly in the second set, compared to his 14 mistakes in the first set and swiftly secured a service break, establishing a 3-0 advantage.He celebrated with a fist pump after striking a powerful forehand winner to the corner, earning his first break opportunity of the contest.Despite the intense exchanges continuing throughout, Djokovic's visible signs of frustration emerged occasionally. Although he lost his serve while attempting to close out the set, he succeeded in his subsequent service game, delivering a powerful forehand winner to the baseline to make it an even contest.But the momentum shift proved temporary. Zandschulp maintained consistent pressure through both baseline play and net approaches, as Djokovic's error count increased steadily.Zandschulp gained the upper hand with a break for 3-1, subsequently winning five consecutive games as Djokovic struggled to halt his opponent's progress.Djokovic exit followed a similar shock suffered by world number two Alexander Zverev and fourth-seeded Casper Ruud.The tournament's landscape has shifted dramatically, with world number three Alcaraz emerging as the highest-ranked player remaining, particularly notable given world number one Jannik Sinner's absence due to a three-month drugs suspension.Alcaraz, pursuing a remarkable achievement of three consecutive Indian Wells titles - a feat only accomplished by Djokovic and Roger Federer - commenced his title defence impressively, defeating France's Quentin Halys 6-4, 6-2.The Spanish player secured an early advantage to claim the opening set, before establishing a commanding 4-0 lead in the second set with impressive serving.His dominant display included seven aces and successful defence of the sole break point faced, concluding the match efficiently in 67 minutes.""I was nervous at the beginning of the match,"" he told a supportive crowd. ""The first match is never easy so I was trying to be focused on my game.""I just tried to be relaxed, as relaxed as I can. Can always be better, but I'm ready for the (next) round and excited.""Australian Open winner Madison Keys began proceedings at the combined ATP Masters and WTA 1000 tournament, defeating Russia's Anastasia Potapova 6-3, 6-0 in her first appearance since claiming her first Grand Slam title.Her performance was sharp as she overcame Potapova in 63 minutes.In other early contests, American players Taylor Fritz and Coco Gauff progressed to the next round.Fritz, who won the men's title in 2022, beat Italian qualifier Matteo Gigante 7-5, 6-3, while Gauff -- also seeded third in her section -- secured a hard-fought 6-3, 3-6, 7-6 (7/4) win against Japan's Moyuka Uchijima.","Former world number one Novak Djokovic suffers shock defeat at Indian Wells.

Incidentally, this is only the second time that Lakshya has ousted Christie in a major after the win in Paris Olympics last August.But there was a setback in the men’s doubles as the famed duo of Satwiksairaj Rankireddy and Chirag Shetty bowed out as Chirag suffered an injury. The Indians retired, trailing 16-21, 2-2 against China’s Hao Nan Xie and Wei Hang Zeng in the second round. Chirag told the chair umpire he had suffered a back injury during the match.Earlier, Malvika Bansod and the mixed doubles combine of Rohan Kapoor and Ruthvika Shivani suffered losses. While Malvika lost to third seed Akane Yamaguchi of Japan 16-21, 13-21, RohanRutvika went down to Chinese fifth seeds Yan Zhe Feng and Ya Xin Wei 10-21, 12-21.Lakshya, however, was in imperious form.

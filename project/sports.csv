Poll What did you think of Jadeja's performance in the Lord's Test? Outstanding - He almost won it for India! Good effort, but ultimately not enough. Disappointing - He should have played fast.

A cheeky moment between England’s Harry Brook and Ben Duckett on Day 5 of the Lord’s Test has gone viral after Ravindra Jadeja ’s valiant resistance almost pulled off a miracle win for India. Star Sports shared a behind-the-scenes clip titled, where Brook can be heard telling teammates, “Shouldn’t he be in the side here, lads?”Duckett responds, “It seems he is not gonna play that,” to which Brook repeats, “He shouldn’t be in the side here, lads.” The timing and tone of the remarks, seemingly aimed at Jadeja, have now taken on new meaning after his gritty knock nearly turned the match.England eventually won the third Test by 22 runs to take a 2–1 lead in the five-match series, but not before Jadeja gave them a massive scare. Chasing 193 for victory, India had slumped to 112 for 8 at lunch on Day 5. Jadeja, batting with the tail, dug deep and formed partnerships with Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Siraj , slowly dragging India closer.With every run, Jadeja’s calm and patience frustrated the English bowlers. His 61 not out off 181 balls was a display of composure and sheer willpower. The match reached its climax when Siraj was bowled by Shoaib Bashir after the ball dribbled back onto his stumps. The crowd at Lord’s rose to their feet, relieved but respectful of India’s fightback.For all the talk on the field, Jadeja let his bat do the talking.",Ravindra Jadeja scored 61 not out on Day 5 of the third Test at Lord's.

Yuvraj Singh tweet

India were forced to admit defeat in the 3rd Test in excruciating fashion as the visitors fell 22 runs short of the target set by England at Lord's. On Day 5, the match turned into a 'pressure cooker situation' after England bowlers stormed through the Indian batting order. After being reduced to 58/4 by stumps on Day 4, England's bowling attack showed no mercy to India as they held India at 112/8 by lunch.Despite the quick loss of wickets and an extremely hostile environment created by the opposition, India all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja put up a sensational resistance alongside Jasprit Bumrah and then Mohammed Siraj afterwards to anchor India's hopes of a victory in the 3rd Test.However, his vigil, featuring a magnificent 61* off 181 deliveries ended in heartbreak and the visitors were forced to swallow the difficult pill that they will walk onto the pitch in Manchester trailing 2-1 in the series.

Washington Sundar press conference: On Gautam Gambhir's support, last over drama, winning at Lord's

NEW DELHI: The Auditor General of Pakistan has flagged major financial irregularities amounting to millions of rupees within the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), including unauthorised appointments and excess payments to match officials. The audit report points to instances of corruption during 2023, when the board was under the leadership of Mohsin Naqvi and Zaka Ashraf.Among the key findings is the misappropriation of 63.39 million Pakistani rupees paid to police for providing meals during international match security duties. The report also highlights the unauthorized hiring of three under-16 coaches at the Karachi High Performance Centre, which resulted in salary payouts of 5.4 million rupees.Further, match officials were overpaid by 3.9 million rupees, raising concerns around potential match-fixing. The report also questions the hiring of a Media Director with a hefty monthly salary of 900,000 rupees.Additionally, the audit notes that ticketing contracts were awarded without following proper competitive bidding procedures. These revelations have further strained the PCB’s already fragile administrative reputation.PCB Chairman Mohsin Naqvi—who concurrently serves as Pakistan's Interior Minister—is now under heightened scrutiny. However, his ministerial position grants him certain legal protections.The board has already come under fire following Pakistan's early exit from the Champions Trophy, which they hosted.

The 3rd Test of the ongoing five-match series between India and England is shaping out into an exciting affair. The Indian bowling attack reduced England to a total of just 192 in their second innings, with India reaching 58/4 at stumps on Day 4. As passion and rivalry take center stage, former India spinner and veteran Ravichandran Ashwin has issued sharp remarks against umpire Paul Reiffel, detailing how 'difficult' it was to deal with him during his playing days.India came close to dismissing England batter Joe Root on Day 4 in the 2nd session, as Mohammed Siraj's sharp delivery was completely missed by the veteran. While the visitors were thoroughly convinced that they had the wicket in the bag, they were forced to control their frurstration as the DRS returned ‘umpire’s call’ on impact. Reacting to the same, Ashwin went on a detailed rant about the umpire, while in conversation with Vimal Kumar on his YouTube channel """".""My experience with Paul Reiffel has been that you always have to talk to him. You have to set him up. I'm not saying that you have to tell him 'give me the wicket', said the 38-year-old. Ashwin then went on a rant about the umpire and his calls, saying, ""Whenever India bowls, he (Paul Reiffel) feels that its not out. When India bats, he feels that its always out. If this was the case with every other team and not just India, then ICC will have to take a look at it.Ashwin's complaints on the match official didn't end there, as he made a hilarious comment on another decision of his. Pointing to a picture of the ball passing past the bat in a DRS check without making contact, Ashwin said, ""From between the bat and the ball, I own a car, a sedan, which can pass through the gap. It is clear that its not out.""Further venting his frustration, Ashwin shared his father's comment that India can never win a match when Paul Reiffel is the umpire. ""Whenever Paul Reiffel comes, we never win,"" Ashwin recounted his father's words.As India edge closer to potential victory on Day 5, the England bowlers will be hot on their heels to get early wickets and derail India's efforts. A win for India in this Test will see the visitors hold a 2-1 series lead heading into the penultimate match at Old Trafford Cricket Ground in Manchester.","Former India spinner and veteran Ravichandran Ashwin has issued sharp remarks against umpire Paul Reiffel.

Poll Should Sam Konstas be replaced as the opener for the remaining Test matches? Yes, he needs more time Yes, bring in a replacement No, he can bounce back No, keep him for experience

Sam Konstas, Australia's 19-year-old pick to open the innings in the tour of the West Indies, has seen his campaign turn into a nightmare, with the youngster setting an unwanted record. His disastrous form makes him the Australian opener with the lowest batting average in the Caribbean since 1984.Brought in to open in place of Marnus Labuschagne, Konstas had started his Test career with promise, scoring a half-century on debut against India at the MCG. But his numbers against the West Indies have been extremely poor. In six innings, he has managed only 50 runs at an average of 8.33, ending with a five-ball duck in his final outing as Shamar Joseph dismissed him.Australia, despite being 2-0 up in the three-match series and maintaining the upper hand in the ongoing day-night Test at Sabina Park, have reasons to worry. Konstas’ struggles against the moving ball and pace-friendly conditions have left a big question mark over the opening slot ahead of the Ashes later this year.Konstas now joins an unfortunate list featuring only Alec Bannerman, Rick Darling, Wayne Phillips, and Keith Stackpole as batters who have scored fewer runs as openers in a series than his 50.The call to replace Labuschagne with him hasn’t paid off, and the team is now under pressure to rethink the top-order combination.However, things haven't been all bad for the teenager. Despite his struggles with the bat, Konstas impressed in the field, showing sharp reflexes to dismiss Justin Greaves via a run-out on Day 2.

The match had plenty of drama and tension, especially during the final session as Jadeja shepherded the tail with resilience.

COLLAPSE FROM 376/6 TO 387 ALL OUT

MORNING MAYHEM ON DAY 5

After nearly five days of captivating and hard-fought Test cricket, England survived a brave fightback led by a defiant Ravindra Jadeja to seal a thrilling 22-run win over India at Lord’s on Monday. With the victory, England took a 2-1 lead in the five-match Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy series.Resuming Day 5 on 58/4, India needed 135 runs to win with six wickets in hand. England’s pace attack came out firing, reducing India to 112/8 by lunch. But Jadeja held firm, scoring a magnificent 61* off 181 deliveries. He batted with calm, composure, and grit, nearly pulling off the improbable alongside the lower order.Ultimately, the resistance ended with India being bowled out for 170 in 74.5 overs — heartbreakingly short of the 193-run target. Ben Stokes and Jofra Archer led England’s charge with three wickets each, bowling marathon spells of 24 and 16 overs respectively. Brydon Carse claimed two, while Chris Woakes and Shoaib Bashir — despite carrying a finger injury — took one apiece. On the sixth anniversary of their 2019 ODI World Cup triumph at Lord’s, England found a way to win through relentless pressure and discipline.Both teams had scored 387 in their first innings.England’s second-innings effort of 192 left India chasing 193 — a target that felt within reach until the very end.Tension gripped the ground as the final session began, with Jadeja and Mohammed Siraj nudging singles and defending doggedly. But in the 75th over, Shoaib Bashir spun one sharply back into Siraj, the ball ricocheting off the bat and onto the stumps to dislodge the leg bail. England erupted in celebration, while the Indian camp was left in disbelief.Where did India lose the plot?India gave away 63 runs in extras — a massive margin in such a low-scoring contest. In the first innings, 31 extras (11 byes, 13 leg byes, 5 wides, 2 no-balls) were conceded, followed by 32 more in the second (25 byes, 6 leg byes, 1 no-ball). The lack of discipline with both ball and gloves helped England stretch their totals significantly.Mohammed Siraj found the edge of Jamie Smith early in England’s first innings, but KL Rahul dropped the straightforward catch at first slip. Smith went on to score a vital 51 off 56 balls — a contribution that would haunt India later.When Pant and Rahul came together on Day 3, India were still 242 runs behind. The duo stitched a superb 141-run stand to pull India back into the contest. However, a miscommunication just before lunch led to Pant’s run-out for 74 while trying to give Rahul the strike. The momentum stalled — and Rahul was dismissed shortly after.India appeared in control at 376/6 with Jadeja and Nitish Reddy set. But a sudden collapse saw the final four wickets fall for just 11 runs. That inability to push ahead allowed England back into the game.The final day began with promise. Pant got going quickly, flicking Archer for a boundary and charging down the track for another. But Archer responded by bowling him with a perfect delivery. Stokes then trapped Rahul lbw, and Sundar departed without scoring. Chris Woakes dismissed Reddy with a beauty just before lunch, leaving India hanging by a thread.Jadeja tried to steer the ship with a masterclass in temperament, but the lack of support ultimately proved costly.England held their nerve, showed patience, and found the breakthroughs just when they needed them.

The duo resisted valiantly after tea, taking India tantalisingly close to an improbable victory before Shoaib Bashir — who had spent much of the match off-field with a finger injury — bowled Siraj to seal the win with the narrowest of margins.Jadeja, not out on his fourth straight fifty of the series, was left stranded, having carried India's hopes almost singlehandedly after they slumped to 112 for 8.It was a match befitting the grandeur of Lord's, and at its centre was Stokes — the warrior, the captain, the match-winner.

I thought I had taken myself to some pretty dark places before, but today…""Stokes also praised the returning Jofra Archer , who took 3 for 55 in his first Test in over four years.""It was one of those gut feelings.

The 2025 Club World Cup has come to a close, with Premier League side Chelsea being crowned champions. The side led by Enzo Maresca comprehensively beat opponents Paris Saint-Germain in the final, 3-0, thanks to a sensational first 45 minutes. In the opening half, goals from Cole Palmer and João Pedro ensured that the Parisians could not stage a comeback in the second half. While Chelsea held on to their lead and even managed to keep a clean sheet, tensions boiled over at the end.A red card for PSG star João Neves and several yellow cards handed out in the final moments ultimately culminated in an intense brawl on the pitch at full-time. At the final whistle, both sides got into a heated argument, as push came to shove. However, one particular incident stood out, as PSG boss Luis Enrique appeared to come to blows with Chelsea forward and goalscorer João Pedro.Viral clips on social media from the incident show players and staff from both sides getting into a tussle. Enrique appears to make contact with Pedro’s face and push him to the turf, as several Chelsea stars swarmed the manager. Chelsea coach Enzo Maresca is also seen running towards the brawl to intervene.The Italian was promptly taken aside by PSG goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma, while Enrique was held back by Presnel Kimpembe.The incident lasted well over a minute, with more than 20 players and staff involved. Following the game, Enrique issued a clarification on his actions, stressing that they weren't intentional.""My clear intention was to separate the players so the situation wouldn't escalate,"" said the Spaniard in a post-match press conference.PSG were on a sensational run of games—winning the UEFA Champions League 5-0 over Inter, beating the likes of Inter Miami and Real Madrid 4-0 at the Club World Cup, and defeating Bayern Munich 2-0 en route to the final on Sunday. However, it was Maresca and Chelsea who prevailed at the MetLife Stadium in New Jersey.With the win, Chelsea have pocketed a total close to $129.5 million as prize money.","Chelsea beat Paris Saint-Germain 3-0 in the FIFA Club World Cup final.

Chelsea secured a decisive 3-0 victory against Paris Saint-Germain in the expanded Club World Cup final at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey on Sunday, with Cole Palmer scoring twice and assisting João Pedro for another goal in a dominant first-half performance.Palmer netted two similar left-footed goals from inside the penalty area in the 22nd and 30th minutes, showcasing his impressive form this season with 18 goals total. He then provided a precise through pass to João Pedro, who chipped the ball over goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma in the 43rd minute.The match drew a tournament-high crowd of 81,188, including U.S. President Donald Trump, who faced boos during the postgame awards ceremony before presenting the trophy alongside FIFA president Gianni Infantino to Chelsea captain Reece James.The victory marked Chelsea's second Club World Cup title, following their 2021 triumph when the tournament featured seven teams. The Blues earned between $128,435,000 and $153,815,000 in prize money, with the final amount depending on FIFA's undisclosed participation fee.PSG's hopes for a quadruple were dashed, having previously won Ligue 1, the Coupe de France, and their first Champions League title. The defeat marked their worst loss since a 4-1 Champions League setback against Newcastle in October 2023.The game's turning point came in the 22nd minute when goalkeeper Robert Sánchez's long kick was mishandled by Nuno Mendes. Malo Gusto's subsequent shot was blocked by Lucas Beraldo before Palmer capitalized on the rebound.Tensions escalated late in the match when João Neves received a red card in the 84th minute for pulling Marc Cucurella's hair. The game concluded with a confrontation involving PSG coach Luis Enrique and Donnarumma pushing João Pedro near the center circle.""It's a great feeling. Even better because obviously everyone doubted us before the game. The gaffer put a great gameplan out and obviously, he knew where the space was going to be,"" Palmer said after the match.PSG coach Luis Enrique acknowledged Chelsea's superiority through a translator: ""They had a lot of energy. I believe they were actually better than we were.""Chelsea, who finished fourth in the Premier League and won the UEFA Conference League, demonstrated superior energy throughout the match, benefiting from an extra day of rest following their semifinal compared to PSG.PSG entered the match as heavy favorites, having outscored opponents 16-1 in previous matches, but struggled to maintain their defensive record, which had included 436 minutes without conceding before Palmer's opening goal.Palmer, who joined Chelsea from Manchester City two years ago at age 23, continued his exceptional season with another stellar performance. His second goal came from a well-timed run onto Levi Colwill's long ball, followed by a skillful cut inside before finishing.The match featured six yellow cards in addition to the red card, reflecting the intense nature of the competition between these European powerhouses.","Chelsea defeated Paris Saint-Germain 3-0 in the Club World Cup final on Sunday.

Indian Super League 2025–26 season put on hold: AIFF responds with detailed statement,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/indian-super-league-202526-season-put-on-hold-aiff-responds-with-detailed-statement/articleshow/122403009.cms,"Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel.

NEW DELHI: A day after the Indian Super League (ISL) announced it was putting the 2025–26 season on hold due to uncertainty over the renewal of the Master Rights Agreement (MRA), the All India Football Federation (AIFF) on Saturday acknowledged the ISL’s importance in the country’s football ecosystem but stressed that it must also abide by the law of the land.The existing MRA between the AIFF and Football Sports Development Limited (FSDL), which runs the ISL, is set to expire on December 8 this year—by which time the league would be well into its third month.On Friday, FSDL stated that without a confirmed contractual framework beyond December, it was unable to ""effectively plan, organise, or commercialise the 2025-26 ISL season"" and had decided to put the season on hold.In response, the AIFF issued a statement saying it would make every effort to ensure the league’s continuity, in line with legal obligations.""The AIFF is conscious of the importance of the ISL not only to the football structure in the country, but also to all the clubs, players, support staff, officials and fans, and also recognises the challenges and difficulties posed due to its disruption. At the same time, AIFF respects the law of the land and the direction of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India,"" the federation said in a statement.Acting on a directive from the Supreme Court, the AIFF has been instructed not to finalise any new terms of the MRA with FSDL until the Court delivers its verdict in the case related to the AIFF’s draft constitution.The AIFF clarified that discussions with FSDL had begun in a timely manner and proposals had been exchanged, but further negotiations were paused following the Court’s order.""As per the Master Rights Agreement, the All India Football Federation had, in a timely manner, first initiated the process of requesting negotiations on the terms of a potential renewal with FSDL on November 21, 2024. Thereafter, senior representatives of the AIFF and FSDL convened meetings on February 5, 2025, in New Delhi and subsequently on March 5, 2025, in Mumbai, to discuss the terms of potential renewal of the Master Rights Agreement.""Following these deliberations, a proposal was submitted by FSDL on March 5, 2025, to which, AIFF responded with a counter-proposal on April 21, 2025. Soon after, the AIFF was advised by its legal counsel that during a hearing on April 26, 2025, the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India made an observation that the renewal of the Master Rights Agreement should not be done until its order.""""Consequently, based on legal advice, discussions between the AIFF and FSDL, renewal discussions have been in abeyance pending further directions from the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India.""Despite the current impasse, the AIFF assured all stakeholders that their interests would be safeguarded and Indian football would remain unaffected.""The AIFF and its stakeholders will take all possible steps, and do all things within their power, to ensure continuity of the ISL in the best interests of Indian football. We request the understanding of all stakeholders in the interim,"" the statement added.FSDL, AIFF’s commercial partner, had signed a 15-year MRA in 2010. Under this agreement, FSDL pays the AIFF Rs 50 crore annually in exchange for broadcasting, managing, and commercialising Indian football, including the national team.This funding has been vital to AIFF’s operational and developmental efforts.FSDL had earlier informed ISL club owners verbally that the next season would not begin until the MRA situation was resolved.According to previous PTI reports, FSDL is also considering the formation of a new holding company to manage the ISL, with ownership divided among participating clubs (60 per cent), FSDL (26 per cent), and AIFF (14 per cent).","The Indian Super League (ISL) announced it was putting the 2025–26 season on hold due to uncertainty over the renewal of the Master Rights Agreement.

A recherché region in India — where cricket has failed to stamp its authority, where it’s commonplace to find a Barcelona or Arsenal motif than one endorsing one of our cricketing stars and where people disregard altitude hindrances to spend the increasingly climate change-affected summers to indulge in the game of football — has finally found its representation on the national stage.The 134th edition of Durand Cup will see participation from the first club from the Himalayan region of Ladakh in 1 Ladakh FC.""It’s a massive opportunity, not just for 1 Ladakh FC but also for the UT of Ladakh to be playing at Durand Cup for the first time ever. A huge thanks to the organisers,"" 1 Ladakh FC co-founder and general secretary of Ladakh Football Association (LFA), Tsering Angmo, told TOI.""We are the team from topmost part of India and Durand Cup is an opportunity for us to bring Ladakh on the Indian football map and use this opportunity to spread the message of awareness on climate change.""""And you will see we will be very unique in how we play football and carry our message to the people of the country,"" she added.Its uniqueness, in fact, is what has made this club – a brainchild of Tsering and former Real Kashmir co-owner Shamim Meraj — a pop-culture phenomenon abroad intertwining Ladakh’s culture, the black-necked crane on the crest, traditional motifs on the jerseys, and Buddhist principles of compassion, with bold social action.Their eco-friendly jerseys, unveiled by the Dalai Lama, have already sold in thousands outside India, especially in Europe.But the opportunity to bring their football from an altitude of 11,500ft-high to the mainland national stage is one that the two-year-old club has cherished since its inception.""Our expectations are very grounded. We like to dream, too, but for now we just want to compete well and give a good show at Durand Cup and then hope for some magic and miracles!"" was how Tsering explained their upcoming sojourn.However, 1 Ladakh FC are not leaving stones unturned in their endeavour to compete with some of the best clubs in the country. The dearth of professionals from the region has led them to recruit 10 footballers from around the country to guide their challenge, along with the Ladakhi players.Former Chennaiyin FC assistant coach, Rajan Mani, will be at the helm of the club with his experience in youth setup, having been a youth coach at Bengaluru FC as well as the ex-head of youth development with the U16 Indian team.""Playing on the mainland, with the huge difference in weather conditions from Ladakh, can be a deterrent to the players’ performance. So, we are taking steps to nullify those effects,"" Tsering explained.Hence, the team will be travelling to Delhi on Friday and undergo a 10-day conditioning camp at IMT Ghaziabad. They will then avoid unnecessary air travel emissions and travel by train to Jamshedpur, the destination of their Group C clashes, and hold a five-day camp in collaboration with Jamshedpur FC , ahead of their Durand Cup opener against Foreign Services Team at JRD Tata Sports Complex on Aug 2.But the very existence of the club, touted ""the greenest club in South Asia"" with its mission to hit net-zero carbon in four years, challenges the status quo. Apart from their goal of eventually playing in the I-League and becoming the first club from Ladakh in India’s top-tiers, it’s their environmental message that makes them the club to watch out for at Durand Cup.""It’s the perfect opportunity for us to amplify our message, and some plans are being worked out on that,"" Tsering agreed.""We will be the team using minimum plastic and have a carbon footprint calculator to measure our carbon footprint. Then we will offset that with measures both back home in Ladakh as well as through our fans all over the country contributing towards offsetting our emissions.""In a world where performance and profits dictate a football club’s trajectory, 1 Ladakh FC is a testimony that sports and sustainability can merge in hopes of a cleaner future.",1 Ladakh FC are the first club from the Himalayan region of Ladakh. The two- year-old club will take part in the 134th edition of Durand Cup. The team will be using minimum plastic and have a carbon footprint calculator to measure their carbon footprint.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122392053,imgsize-35440,width-400,resizemode-4/122392053.jpg"

Poll How do you view the criticism Henderson received for joining Al-Ettifaq? Justified, he prioritized money. Unjustified, players have to earn a living.

Jordan Henderson will leave Dutch club Ajax a year before his contract ends, the club announced on Thursday. The 35-year-old joined Ajax in January 2024, just six months after his move from Liverpool to Saudi club Al-Ettifaq, which drew criticism over gay rights concerns.An outspoken advocate for the LGBTQ+ community, Henderson was accused of prioritising money over principles. However, he soon turned the page on the controversy as Ajax named him club captain. He went on to make 57 appearances for the Amsterdam-based side, whose shirt has been worn by legends like Johan Cruyff and Dennis Bergkamp.Henderson played a pivotal role in Ajax’s revival following one of their worst seasons. Under his leadership, the team mounted a serious Eredivisie title challenge. However, despite holding a nine-point lead with five games remaining, Ajax surrendered the advantage and lost the title to rivals PSV Eindhoven.Ajax Technical Director Alex Kroes praised the veteran midfielder, saying, “Jordan was a true captain for us, both on and off the pitch. Through his mentality and leadership qualities, he made a significant contribution to our qualification for the UEFA Champions League.”Henderson’s performances also earned him a surprise recall to Thomas Tuchel’s first England squad in March. Reflecting on his stint in Amsterdam, Henderson said, “To play for this club was an honour in itself. To have the privilege of captaining it was even more so.”He added that he would not be making further comments due to the “tragic events of last week, and the devastating loss of my former teammate Diogo Jota and his brother Andre Silva,” as quoted by AFP.","Jordan Henderson will leave Dutch club Ajax in January 2024.

FIFA Rankings (Screengrab via X)

The Indian men’s football team dropped to its lowest FIFA ranking in nine years, slipping six places to 133rd in the latest chart released on Thursday. The fall follows back-to-back defeats in June, including a 0-2 loss to Thailand in a friendly on June 4, followed by a 0-1 defeat to lower-ranked Hong Kong in an Asian Cup qualifying match. The disappointing run also saw head coach Manolo Marquez part ways with the All India Football Federation (AIFF).India last had a worse ranking in December 2016, when it was placed 135th. The country's best-ever position in the FIFA rankings was 94, achieved in February 1996.India now holds 1113.22 rating points, down from 1132.03 previously. Among the 46 Asian nations, India sits 24th, with Japan leading the continental standings at 17th in the world.With the loss to Hong Kong seriously denting their hopes of qualifying for the 2027 Asian Cup, nothing seems to be going right for the Indian men’s team . Under Marquez’s brief tenure, the team managed just one win in eight matches , with a solitary victory over the Maldives in March.In 2024 so far, India have played four matches: winning one, drawing one, and losing two. The team’s poor form even prompted the return of former captain and veteran striker Sunil Chhetri, but his inclusion has yet to turn the tide.India’s next international fixture is scheduled for October, when they face Singapore away in the third round of Asian Cup qualifiers.At the top of the FIFA rankings, world champions Argentina lead the 210-nation table, followed by Spain, France, England, Brazil, Portugal, the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, and Croatia.","The Indian men’s football team dropped to its lowest FIFA ranking in nine years, slipping six places to 133rd in the latest chart released on Thursday.

Paris Saint-Germain delivered a commanding performance in their Club World Cup semi-final match against Real Madrid, securing a 4-0 victory at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford on July 10, 2025. Fabian Ruiz scored twice, while Ousmane Dembele and Goncalo Ramos added goals to set up a final clash with Chelsea, as PSG continues their pursuit of adding to their successful season following their French title and UEFA Champions League victories.The match saw PSG take early control with two quick goals in the opening nine minutes through Ruiz and Dembele, silencing the majority of the 77,542 spectators supporting Real Madrid.Ruiz netted his second before halftime, and Ramos sealed the victory with a late fourth goal for Luis Enrique's side.""We are in a special season, a special moment, and we deserved to win,"" Luis Enrique told broadcaster DAZN. ""We are going to try, one more step against a good team like Chelsea. They did great, they performed the whole competition and now it is time for us to prepare for that... we want to make history in our club, and then take some holidays.""The defeat was particularly significant for Real Madrid, who had hoped to add the first 32-team Club World Cup to their record of 15 European Cup victories.""We were not good enough today,"" said Real Madrid coach Xabi Alonso. ""We are not the first ones to lose to them but we have a lot of different things to improve.""Former PSG star Kylian Mbappe, now with Real Madrid, struggled to make an impact in his first match against his former club since his departure last year.PSG managed the impressive victory despite missing suspended center-back Willian Pacho, with Lucas Beraldo effectively filling the defensive role.Real Madrid faced their own challenges, playing without suspended defender Dean Huijsen and missing Trent Alexander-Arnold.The match began with PSG goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois making two impressive saves in the first five minutes, denying both Ruiz and Nuno Mendes.PSG's opening goal came in the sixth minute when Dembele capitalized on poor defending by Raul Asencio, with Ruiz converting after Courtois saved the initial attempt.The second goal followed quickly as Antonio Rudiger miscontrolled a pass from Jude Bellingham, allowing Dembele to score with a low finish.PSG's third goal demonstrated their dominance, with Achraf Hakimi setting up Ruiz following a sequence of possession that started with a saved Mbappe shot.Real Madrid's attack, featuring Mbappe, Vinicius Junior, and Gonzalo Garcia, failed to threaten PSG's defense throughout the match.The Spanish side's struggles led to Alonso substituting both Bellingham and Vinicius just after the hour mark.Ramos completed the scoring in the 87th minute, controlling a pass from substitute Bradley Barcola before finding the net.The victory continues PSG's impressive run in the tournament, following their 5-0 win against Inter Milan in the European Cup final and a four-goal victory over Atletico Madrid earlier in the Club World Cup.PSG will now face Chelsea in the final on Sunday, with the opportunity to add another trophy to their remarkable season.The French champions displayed their attacking prowess throughout the match, with Dembele particularly impressive, adding to his impressive tally of 35 goals since August.The result positions PSG one game away from completing an unprecedented season of success, having already secured domestic and European honors.","Paris Saint-Germain beat Real Madrid 4-0 in their Club World Cup semi-final.

Pascal Wehrlein fights to secure his position in Formula E Driver Standings

It was a special day for German driver Pascal Wehrlein at his home race, the Berlin E-Prix, on Saturday. Despite facing a three-place grid penalty, the TAG Heuer Porsche driver delivered a stellar performance to reach the podium. Wehrlein, driving car No. 94, finished second in Round 13 at the Tempelhof Airport Circuit and celebrated the moment with his daughter on stage.Pascal Wehrlein secured his fifth podium of the season at the Berlin E-Prix on Saturday, overcoming a grid penalty received for colliding with teammate Antonio Felix Da Costa during FP1 on Friday. He also earned extra points for setting the fastest lap in the race.After the event, Wehrlein shared several photos on Instagram, including a heartwarming one of him holding his daughter. He captioned it: “I promised you a trophy. P2 at our first home race of the season. Grateful to have family and friends here to share the moment. Let’s go again tomorrow.”The achievement was even sweeter as it helped Wehrlein close the gap with championship leader Oliver Rowland to just 50 points. Rowland failed to finish Saturday’s race and retired early. However, on Sunday, fortunes reversed — Wehrlein couldn’t convert his pole position into a podium, while Rowland finished fourth, securing enough points to clinch this year’s Formula E World Championship.Sharing his thoughts after the Round 13 race, Wehrlein said, “It was an important day and a good race, starting from P9. Finishing second is a good result, but we had a small taste of the victory. I think pace-wise, we were the quickest, so I tried really hard and it was close in the end.

Mitch Evans’ radio footage from Berlin E-Prix



Mitch Evans has 14 wins in Formula E



As Mitch Evans crossed the finish line at the Berlin E-Prix on Saturday, the Jaguar TCS Racing driver joked on the radio with his team that they might have to remind him where the podium was.

Such a talented driver!”Speaking about his win at the Tempelhof Airport Circuit on Saturday, Evans said, “I wasn’t expecting that today. It’s been difficult for us since São Paulo. There were tricky conditions, and I was managing some issues with the brakes towards the end of the race, which wasn’t easy. I was quite happy with a bit of a gap, but nonetheless, the car was competitive throughout the race and there were some good strategy calls from the team. My guys did so well. There’s always some work to do, but this is a nice reward for everyone back at Jaguar TCS Racing.”Evans had secured pole position in the qualifying session. The Duels were cancelled due to rain, so the grid was determined based on the results of the group stage.Formula E later announced that Evans is now tied for the most wins in the championship’s history. He and Sebastien Buemi both have 14 career victories.Reacting to the post, a fan wrote, “14 and counting! Congratulations Mitch, many more wins to come.” Another wrote, “History created in style.”Also Read: Berlin E-Prix 2025 Results: Mitch Evans clinches second win of season, Pascal Wehrlein closes points gap with Oliver Rowland Despite the win, Evans remains 13th in the Formula E Driver Standings for the season with 50 points.

How the technology works

Can the visually impaired also enjoy the fun and thrill of a Formula E race? Yes, it’s now possible — thanks to a new initiative by Formula E and Google Cloud: an AI-powered audio race report. This initiative promotes inclusivity and makes motorsport more accessible for blind and visually impaired fans. Google Cloud will work with the Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB) to conduct focus groups and user testing during upcoming race weekends in Berlin and London, with a full rollout planned for Formula E season 12.The project was unveiled by Formula E CEO Jeff Dodds at the Google Cloud Summit in London. It uses Google Cloud’s generative AI technology to create rich, descriptive audio summaries of every E-Prix race. These reports will offer fans a dynamic recap that captures the excitement and key moments of each race, available on demand shortly after the chequered flag.The initiative originated from a Google Cloud Hackathon held during the 2024 London E-Prix. It is being developed in close partnership with RNIB to ensure the final product meets the needs of visually impaired users.Sharing his enthusiasm about the collaboration, Formula E CEO Jeff Dodds said, “At Formula E, we believe the thrill of electric racing should be accessible to everyone. This innovative collaboration with Google Cloud is a fantastic example of how technology can be used for good—creating a brand-new way for blind and visually impaired fans to experience the drama and emotion of our sport. By working closely with the RNIB, we are ensuring this innovation is truly inclusive and fit for purpose, so that no fan is left behind. ”John Abel, Managing Director of Specialised Software at Google Cloud, added, “For too long, the visual nature of racing has been a barrier for fans who are blind or visually impaired. Google Cloud's AI technology will act as a digital storyteller, creating a vivid audio narrative that brings the speed, strategy, and excitement of Formula E to life. We are proud to work alongside a partner like Formula E that shares our passion for using innovation to break down barriers and connect people through shared experiences. ”Sonali Rai, RNIB’s Media, Culture and Immersive Technology Lead, also said, “Audio description transforms how blind and partially sighted motorsport fans can fully engage in enjoying the full racing spectacle—taking in the visceral sounds of cars on the track while feeling the passion of the crowd.”She continued, “RNIB has been working with Formula E and Google Cloud on this AI-powered podcast, which promises to give a full picture of the race in an accessible and engaging way for blind and partially sighted fans. Formula E’s commitment to working directly with the community to develop this technology is exactly the right approach. It sets a fantastic standard in inclusivity for other sports to follow and stay on track with new advances in innovation. ”The audio report is generated through a multi-stage process powered by Google Cloud's AI platform, Vertex AI. Google’s Chirp model accurately transcribes live race commentary. Google’s Gemini models analyze the transcribed commentary along with live timing data and other official race information. The AI identifies key events such as overtakes, incidents, and strategic pit stops and generates an engaging, fact-based race summary.Also Read: Berlin E-Prix: From Oliver Rowland’s World Championship win to Felipe Drugovich’s debut, there’s a lot to look forward to The text is then converted into natural, expressive speech using advanced text-to-speech technology, resulting in a polished audio report ready for distribution.

The reports will be available globally on Spotify and other popular audio platforms in more than 15 languages, including English, Spanish, French, German, Mandarin, and Arabic.",Formula E and Google Cloud team up to create AI-powered audio race report.

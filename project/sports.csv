'TU KAR SAKTA HAI'

R Ashwin: From fringe player to India's greatest match-winner

NEW DELHI: Delhi Capitals have pressed the reset button ahead of the 2025 edition of the Indian Premier League and will have a new captain, and plenty of fresh faces, from the upcoming season. Wicketkeeper-batter Abishek Porel believes that Delhi Capitals' long wait for the title will finally end under new captain Axar Patel Porel, who was retained by the franchise, highlighted Axar's deep understanding of the team, having spent six years with the Delhi outfit. Axar has been a part of the Delhi Capitals setup since 2019 and has become a crucial player in India's white-ball set-up too.""Axar bhai has been with Delhi Capitals for the last 3-4 (7) years, so he knows everything. He is a good choice. It's good for us too. He is like a big brother and has helped me a lot, both on and off the field. He is funny off the field and focused on the field. I am really excited to play under him, and I am sure DC will win a trophy under his captaincy,"" said Porel during a select media interaction.""I love challenges"" — that's what Porel said while recalling interactions with Rishabh Pant during his time as DC captain. Pant departed from Delhi Capitals last season and will be donning the captaincy hat for a new team this season — Lucknow Super Giants .Porel also revealed that he has now become more fearless in his approach and credited former India skipper Sourav Ganguly , who served as the Director of Cricket for the franchise last season, for this transformation. Delhi Capitals have revamped their backroom staff, appointing Venugopal Rao as the new Director of Cricket while Ganguly transitions to focus on the Women's Premier League.""For me, DC has given me a lot of opportunities. I am really thankful to them. My cricket has gone to another level with these opportunities. Ganguly sir helped me a lot and backed me as well. 'Khul ke khelo, khul ke batting karo' - that's what Ganguly sir always told me,"" Porel said.The youngster is now pumped up for the upcoming season and will draw a lot of confidence from the successful outings in the domestic circuit for Bengal.""Last year, I spent a lot of time with both Ricky sir and Rishabh bhai. They both motivated me a lot. They taught me many things. Rishabh bhai used to have a lot of chats with me. Whenever I batted, he would say, 'Tu kar sakta hai, tu achha khelta hai.' I will take those learnings from Rishabh bhai this season. This season, DC has a new support staff, and they are highly talented. They are frank and very friendly.""I love challenges. From what I was to what I am now, I can see a lot of improvement in my performance and game. For the last 12 months, I have focused on my game and worked on my mental strength. The game has changed a lot and is becoming faster and more challenging. So, I am trying my best to match up to that. The level of cricket has gone really high. I play domestic cricket, but when I wasn't playing or during non-cricket days, I worked a lot at NCA. I had an impressive domestic season, and my ultimate aim is to do well this season,"" he said.","Abishek Porel believes that Delhi Capitals' long wait for the title will finally end under new captain Axar Patel.

CSK SQUAD FOR IPL 2025

NEW DELHI: When discussing title contenders in the IPL, the name Chennai Super Kings (CSK) inevitably rises to the top, thanks to their on-field dominance and a record five titles. With IPL 2025 set to commence on March 22 and CSK kicking off their campaign against fellow five-time champions Mumbai Indians on March 23 at the MA Chidambaram Stadium, all eyes will be on the Yellow Army and their iconic leader Mahendra Singh Dhoni.CSK's dominance can be attributed to the legendary Dhoni, under whose captaincy the team has secured five titles, reached the final ten times, and advanced to the playoffs on 12 occasions.After finishing as runners-up in the inaugural 2008 season, CSK made it to the semifinals in 2009. The following two years, 2010 and 2011, saw them clinch back-to-back titles, establishing their supremacy.In 2012 and 2013, CSK reached the finals but fell short, losing to Kolkata Knight Riders and Mumbai Indians, respectively. In 2014, they missed out on the final after being defeated by Punjab Kings (then Kings XI Punjab) in Qualifier 2.CSK's resurgence came in 2015 when they reached the final once again, only to lose to Mumbai Indians. However, the team faced a major setback when they were suspended from the IPL for two years (2016 and 2017) due to the 2013 IPL spot-fixing and betting scandal.The suspension did not diminish CSK's spirit. They returned triumphantly in IPL 2018, winning the title. In 2019, they narrowly missed out on the championship, losing to Mumbai Indians by just one run in a thrilling final.In 2020, CSK experienced their first failure to qualify for the playoffs, exiting after the league stage. However, they rebounded strongly in 2021 to claim their fourth title.The 2022 season saw another setback as CSK once again failed to reach the playoffs. Yet, they staged a remarkable comeback in 2023, clinching their fifth title.The 2024 season marked a significant change as Dhoni handed over the captaincy to Ruturaj Gaikwad . Unfortunately, the transition did not yield the desired results, as CSK faced an early exit, finishing fifth in the league stage with seven wins and seven losses, amassing 14 points.As IPL 2025 approaches, the burning question remains: Can CSK add a sixth trophy to their decorated cabinet?CSK have consistently checked all the boxes heading into tournaments, which explains their sustained dominance over the years.With the strategic brilliance of Dhoni still in the squad, CSK boast a formidable top-order lineup featuring New Zealand batting stars Rachin Ravindra and Devon Conway, along with the experienced Rahul Tripathi. Staying true to their tradition of prioritising all-rounders, CSK have once again picked a solid side, including Shivam Dube, Deepak Hooda, Vijay Shankar, Ravindra Jadeja, Sam Curran, and Ravichandran Ashwin.CSK's bowling attack also appears well-balanced, with the likes of Jamie Overton, Kamlesh Nagarkoti, Khaleel Ahmed, Shreyas Gopal, Matheesha Pathirana, Mukesh Choudhary, Nathan Ellis, and Noor Ahmad.The only chink in CSK's armour seems to be their captaincy.Ruturaj Gaikwad, who was entrusted with the leadership role in IPL 2024, fell short of expectations as CSK finished fifth in IPL 2024 with seven wins and as many losses.CSK will be hoping that Ruturaj can put the 2024 disappointment behind him and lead the team with fiery determination to secure their sixth title.Devon Conway/Rachin Ravindra*, Ruturaj Gaikwad (capt), Rahul Tripathi, Deepak Hooda/Vijay Shankar, Shivam Dube, Ravindra Jadeja, Sam Curran*, MS Dhoni (wk), R Ashwin, Noor Ahmad/Nathan Ellis*, Matheesha Pathirana*, Khaleel Ahmed (*denotes overseas player)Devon Conway, Rachin Ravindra, Ruturaj Gaikwad (capt), Rahul Tripathi, Deepak Hooda, Vijay Shankar, Shivam Dube, Ravindra Jadeja, Sam Curran, MS Dhoni (wk), R Ashwin, Noor Ahmad, Nathan Ellis, Matheesha Pathirana, Khaleel Ahmed, C Andre Siddarth, Vansh Bedi, Shaik Rasheed, Ramakrishna Ghosh, Shreyas Gopal, Anshul Kamboj, Gurjapneet Singh, Mukesh Choudhary, Kamlesh Nagarkoti","Chennai Super Kings (CSK) have won a record five IPL titles.

Argentina’s footballing maestro Lionel Messi will not feature in the national team’s upcoming World Cup qualifying matches against Uruguay and Brazil, as announced by coach Lionel Scaloni on Monday. The 37-year-old was absent from the 25-man squad, raising questions among fans and media alike.Despite speculation, the Argentine Football Association (AFA) did not provide an official reason for Messi’s exclusion. However, Argentine media reports suggest that the star forward suffered a sore left thigh during Inter Miami ’s 2-1 victory over Atlanta United in Major League Soccer (MLS) on Sunday. Messi played the full 90 minutes, scoring the opening goal in his return to the starting lineup after missing three consecutive matches due to ""load management.""Inter Miami manager Javier Mascherano , who has been cautious with Messi’s fitness throughout the MLS season, addressed the issue following the match against Atlanta United.""We tried to take away from the overload Messi had, so that it wouldn't go further than that. We tried to handle it in the best way. Luckily, we were able to control it and that it didn't turn into an injury or much more... There's no secret in this,"" Mascherano stated.He further explained that Inter Miami has maintained close communication with Argentina’s medical staff regarding Messi’s condition.""Obviously the Argentinian national team doctors are in contact with the doctors here, and they are the ones who specifically talk about that,"" he added.Messi was initially named in Argentina’s 33-man provisional squad but did not make the final cut, leaving fans disappointed ahead of two crucial qualifiers. Argentina, who currently lead the South American standings with 25 points from 12 matches, will face second-placed Uruguay on Friday before hosting fifth-placed Brazil at the Monumental Stadium in Buenos Aires four days later.The absence of the seven-time Ballon d’Or winner is not the only blow for Argentina, as Paulo Dybala , Gonzalo Montiel, and Giovani Lo Celso are also set to miss the doubleheader.","Lionel Messi will not feature in Argentina's upcoming World Cup qualifying matches against Uruguay and Brazil.

Will Rohit Sharma win 2027 World Cup? Astrologer Lobo predicts after getting Champions Trophy bang on!

NEW DELHI: India cricket legend Sunil Gavaskar has praised the incredible depth of Indian cricket following the team's unbeaten run to the 2025 Champions Trophy title, achieved even without ace pacer Jasprit Bumrah . Reflecting on the triumph, Gavaskar made a bold claim that no individual player is indispensable in the current Indian lineup — not even veteran batters Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma Writing in his column for Mid-Day, Gavaskar remarked, ""The triumph in the Champions Trophy and that too without Bumrah also emphasises that nobody is indispensable in this game. In the past too, India has won without Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli, but there’s not the slightest doubt that their presence in the team gives the team an even more invincible look.""Gavaskar lauded Team India ’s resilience after bouncing back from a dismal Test series defeat against Australia to clinch victory in the England T20Is and ODIs, followed by the Champions Trophy. He noted how the team’s ability to triumph without their key players showcased the immense talent pool in Indian cricket.""Very seldom has a team depended on one individual like the Indians depended on Jasprit Bumrah in Australia, and his absence from the bowling attack to defend the small target set by India tilted the scales Australia’s way,"" Gavaskar said. ""For the Indian team to bounce back the way they did with comprehensive wins in the ODI and T20 series against England that were played on the team’s return to India tells volumes of the talent that Indian cricket has.""The cricketing great also acknowledged the support from overseas players, who admitted that India would have emerged victorious regardless of the location, dismissing claims that the Dubai setting played a decisive role. ""It is good to see so many overseas cricketers now coming up and saying India would have won anyway wherever they played and not only because they were stationed in Dubai,"" Gavaskar added.Gavaskar’s remarks reflect a sense of confidence in the current Indian setup, asserting that while legends like Kohli and Rohit undeniably elevate the team, the core strength lies in the depth and talent of the entire squad.","India cricket legend Sunil Gavaskar has praised the incredible depth of Indian cricket following the team's unbeaten run to the 2025 Champions Trophy title.

‘Wanted my 100th Test to be my last’

India's former ace spinner Ravichandran Ashwin has seen it all – multiple Indian Premier League IPL ) teams, the growing corporatisation of the league, and the evolution of franchises. Yet, as he returned to the Chennai Super Kings ( CSK ) camp after nearly a decade, one thing stood out: the unchanged atmosphere of the team itself.“It feels like it’s 2011 again,” said Ashwin, who was felicitated by Krishnamachari Srikkanth on Sunday at the book launch of ‘Leo – The Untold Story of CSK’, written by PS Raman.Ashwin made his IPL debut in 2009 with CSK and was part of the team’s title-winning campaigns in 2010 and 2011. After stints with franchises like Punjab Kings, Rising Pune Supergiants (now defunct), Delhi Capitals, and Rajasthan Royals, the 38-year-old Tamil Nadu cricketer is back home at CSK for his 16th IPL season.“It was nice to go around and get a flavour of what it is like everywhere. You learn a lot, but one thing that really stands out is that CSK has remained a team that’s evolved, yet at the same time, remained an archive,” Ashwin said.“Today, in the world of cricket corporatisation, there’s nobody who runs a business to make a loss – I understand that. But things have evolved, and teams have changed so much. Coming here (to CSK) again, I realise it hasn’t changed one bit since I left in 2015. The fact is, it is organically cricket. The best way to run a cricket team and achieve success is to keep it cricket-oriented,” he added.For Ashwin, his comeback to CSK is not about returning as a seasoned star, but as someone who wants to “enjoy” playing cricket again.“Destinations are not reached just like that; you need to go through milestones. My comeback to CSK is not as the person who’s achieved all those things, but as someone who’s gone through the entire circle and wants to come back and enjoy the same moment, I experienced all those years ago. It’s a wonderful place to be,” Ashwin said.At the book launch event, CSK legend MS Dhoni was also present, and Ashwin couldn’t help but reflect on the special bond that he shares with the former captain.Recalling a moment from his 100th Test, Ashwin spoke of inviting Dhoni to hand over the memento during the match in Dharamshala (in March last year against England), a moment he had hoped would mark his final appearance in Test cricket.“I invited MS for my 100th Test to hand over the memento. I wanted to make that my last Test. Unfortunately, he couldn’t come, but I didn’t think you’d hand over the gift of getting me back to CSK. It’s a much better one, so thank you MS,” Ashwin said.","Ravichandran Ashwin made his IPL debut in 2009 with CSK and was part of the team’s title-winning campaigns in 2010 and 2011.

Even when Delhi Capitals’ last pair was at the crease, you could see MI fielders moving around briskly.“We fought till the last ball,” she said, aptly summing up the team’s effort during the post-match presentation.Harmanpreet may have played third fiddle to Nat Sciver-Brunt and Hayley Matthews in the batting line-up, but when it mattered the most, she was the one who played the innings of the tournament to help MI post 149 for 7 with her 44-ball 66. The next best batter was Sciver-Brunt, who scored a 28-ball 30 and struggled to get going on the night.It wasn’t the best of starts for the right-hand batter as she managed to score just one half-century in the first seven matches. But in the last four games, Harmanpreet called on all her experience to play vital knocks. She top-scored against Gujarat Giants with a 33-ball 54, and a 12-ball 36 against the same opponents in the eliminator helped MI post 213 for 4 — their highest score in the tournament. Then came the icing on the cake — the knock in the final.She finished the tournament with 302 runs in 10 matches at a strike rate of almost 155. On a track where most MI batters perished when they decided to open their shoulders, Harmanpreet was the opposite.Coming in at 14 for 2, she took her time to read the situation and once settled, started to pierce the field. It was the best innings she had played in a long time.“It was not easy when I went in. But I had that belief that if I stayed there and kept rotating the strike, we could get to a decent total. Partnership (with Sciver-Brunt) was amazing; I wanted to keep things simple and easy. We took calculated risks and that helped us. (A target of) 150 was not a decent total, but in pressure games, it always looks like 180,” said Harmanpreet.After Sciver-Brunt and Shabnim Ismail dismissed Meg Lanning and Shafali Verma, it was about making the right calls to keep the opposition under pressure. Harmanpreet marshalled her resources well and employed the right fields for her bowlers who delivered.",Harmanpreet Kaur played the innings of the tournament to help MI post 149 for 7.

Newcastle stun Liverpool in League Cup final to end 56-year trophy drought,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/newcastle-stun-liverpool-in-league-cup-final-to-end-56-year-trophy-drought/articleshow/119099737.cms,"Newcastle players celebrate after winning the League Cup against Liverpool at Wembley Stadium in London. (AP)

History for Newcastle

Newcastle ended their 56-year trophy drought in stunning style as Dan Burn and Alexander Isak sealed a 2-1 win against Liverpool in the League Cup final on Sunday.Eddie Howe 's side made history at Wembley with a superb display that left the runaway Premier League leaders shell-shocked.Burn put Newcastle ahead late in the first half and Isak's 27th goal in all competitions doubled their lead after the interval.Federico Chiesa got one back in the closing seconds, but Newcastle held on for their first major silverware since the 1969 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup.That success in the predecessor to the Europa League is a relic of a bygone era, but this long-awaited triumph will be forever etched in the memories of the Newcastle fans who turned one half of Wembley into a roiling sea of black and white with their ecstatic celebrations.It was also Newcastle's first major domestic prize dating back 70 years to the 1955 FA Cup.Since the Magpies lifted the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, 30 different English teams had won silverware, while Liverpool had clinched 38 major trophies in that time.But after losing the 2023 League Cup final against Manchester United, Howe's team returned to Wembley and set the record straight at last.""We were well aware of the history and we wanted to do the club proud. We wanted to score, we wanted to perform and we wanted to win,"" Howe said.""We are breaking new ground. I thought we were magnificent today.""Newcastle had endured five relegations to the second tier since their last trophy, with club legends like Alan Shearer, Paul Gascoigne and Malcolm MacDonald failing to win silverware in their time on Tyneside.Aside from a brief period when Kevin Keegan's self-styled ""entertainers"" challenged for the title in the 1990s, Newcastle have endured decades of underachievement and self-inflicted wounds that rendered them a laughing stock for long periods.All that changed in 2021 when a Saudi-backed consortium completed a takeover from unpopular owner Mike Ashley and quickly hired Howe as their manager.Thanks to Howe's astute leadership and the Saudi financial backing, Newcastle have been transformed from relegation candidates to silverware winners.The defeat was another painful blow for Liverpool just days after their Champions League last 16 exit on penalties against Paris Saint-Germain.But despite failing to win their first trophy under boss Arne Slot, Liverpool still sit 12 points clear at the top of the Premier League, within touching distance of a record-equalling 20th English title.""It's a very disappointing result. The game went the way Newcastle wanted it. They deserved to win. We were out-played in their style. They won more aerial duels than us,"" Slot said.Liverpool are 23 points ahead of sixth-placed Newcastle in the league and hadn't lost to them for 17 games dating back to 2015.But Howe's men were in no mood to be cowed by past failuresNewcastle fans unveiled a banner before kick-off urging their team to ""write your name in the history books"".They rose to the challenge in spectacular fashion, snapping into tackles and counter-attacking with purpose, while Liverpool were sluggish and sloppy in possession.Newcastle's desire and drive was clear to see when Joelinton tracked back from midfield to stop Jarell Quansah in his tracks and celebrated with a fist-pumping roar.Despite nearly being caught out by Burn's aerial prowess earlier in the game, Liverpool failed to heed the warning as the towering centre-back put Newcastle ahead in the 45th minute.Bizarrely left unmarked, with only the diminutive Alex Mac Allister anywhere near him, Burn was allowed to rise unchallenged to meet Kieran Tripper's corner as he thumped a powerful header into far corner from 12 yards.Burn's goal -- Newcastle's first in a cup final since 1976 -- capped an incredible week for the journeyman centre-back, who received his first England call-up on Friday.With Liverpool talisman Mohamed Salah completely anonymous, the lethargic Reds had no answer as Isak put Newcastle into dreamland after 52 minutes.Newcastle dominated in the air again as Jacob Murphy met Tino Livramento's cross with a header that found Isak, who drilled a superb first-time finish past Caoimhin Kelleher from 10 yards.Chiesa's stoppage-time strike set up an anxious finale, but good things comes to those who wait.And all across Wembley, Newcastle players and fans celebrated with abandon as a party over half a century in the making got into full swing.",Newcastle beat Liverpool 2-1 in the League Cup final at Wembley Stadium. Dan Burn and Alexander Isak score the goals for the Magpies. Federico Chiesa pulls one back for Liverpool in the closing seconds. It is Newcastle's first major silverware since the 1969 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119099966,imgsize-469196,width-400,resizemode-4/119099966.jpg"

For shorter tours, family time is limited to one week.This policy modification came into effect after India's 3-1 defeat to Australia in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy.""Some things are beyond our control. While we all have personal opinions, it's essential to focus on what we can manage. How can the presence of families be a bad thing? If something isn't in our hands, it's best to leave it as it is.

And I feel quite disappointed about that because it is like people who have no control over what is going on are kind of brought into conversations and put out at the forefront that, 'oh, maybe they need to be kept away'.""""I want to be able to be normal.

Pakistan all-rounder Khushdil Shah has been fined 50% of his match fee after being found guilty of a Level 2 breach of the ICC Code of Conduct during the opening T20I against New Zealand in Christchurch on Sunday. The incident occurred during the 8th over of Pakistan’s innings when Khushdil collided with New Zealand bowler Zakary Foulkes.The ICC charged Khushdil under Article 2.12, which pertains to improper physical contact during an international match. Match officials, including referee Jeff Crowe, deemed the collision as ""forceful physical contact that was both careless and preventable."" Khushdil accepted the charge and the imposed sanction, negating the need for a formal hearing.In addition to the hefty fine, three demerit points were added to Khushdil’s disciplinary record. This was his first offense in the past 24 months, and under ICC regulations, accumulating four demerit points within this period would convert to suspension points, potentially leading to match bans.The incident added to Pakistan’s woes on a disappointing day as they managed to post only 91 runs in their innings, marking a lackluster start to Salman Ali Agha ’s tenure as permanent T20I captain. Despite Khushdil’s 32-run effort, the rest of the batting lineup faltered. Agha (18) and Jahandad Khan (17) were the only other players to reach double figures.New Zealand’s bowling attack was relentless, with Jacob Duffy taking 4/14 and Kyle Jamieson grabbing 3/8, dismantling Pakistan’s batting order. Chasing a modest target, the hosts eased to victory with Tim Seifert top-scoring with 44 off 29 balls. Despite Abrar Ahmed ’s dismissal of Seifert, Finn Allen (29*) and Tim Robinson (18*) comfortably saw the Black Caps home with nine wickets in hand and 59 balls remaining, giving New Zealand a 1-0 lead in the five-match series.",Khushdil Shah fined 50% of his match fee for Level 2 breach of ICC Code of Conduct.

Since a horror season as Mumbai Indians' (MI) captain last year, Hardik Pandya 's life on the field has turned around in remarkable fashion, landing him the honour of being part of India's triumphant T20 World Cup and ICC Champions Trophy teams. And the star all-rounder is ready to extend that turnaround to the upcoming Indian Premier League IPL ) season, where he would want to leave a forgettable last-place finish in 2024 behind and lead the team by example.MI will open their campaign this season against fellow five-time winners Chennai Super Kings in Chennai on Sunday.The negative response Hardik encountered in IPL 2024 stemmed from the franchise's choice to appoint him as captain, succeeding fan-favourite Rohit Sharma, who had steered the team to five titles. Those jeers escalated after MI finished at the bottom of the league table.""For me, it has always been about never leaving the battlefield. There have been phases in my career where my focus wasn't necessarily on winning but on surviving and holding my ground,"" Hardik said while talking to 'JioHotstar' ahead of the IPL starting March 22.""I realised that no matter what was happening around me, cricket would always be my greatest ally...I kept pushing through, and when all the hard work finally paid off, it was beyond anything I could have scripted.""The six-month phase where we won the (T20) World Cup, and then the kind of love and support I received upon returning -- it was a complete 360-degree turnaround for me,"" the 31-year-old Hardik added.""I didn't know exactly when that would happen, but as they say, destiny had its plan, and in my case, everything changed within two and a half months.""He had a message for the youngsters, urging them to be patient with themselves whatever the situation.""...Believe in yourself...the biggest challenge at this stage is self-doubt. Sometimes, players start questioning whether they belong at this level, and that doubt can take away from their skill set. Managing that mental aspect is crucial,"" he said.""In this game, there will be highs and lows. The key is to remain balanced, not just for one season but throughout their careers.""Hardik made significant contributions alongside Mohammed Shami, particularly with the new ball, during India's successful Champions Trophy campaign, while Jasprit Bumrah was unavailable.Despite MI's disappointing performance in the 2024 IPL season, Hardik expressed confidence in the team's prospects. He believes that MI managed to assemble a balanced squad at the mega auction last November.""Having played in the IPL for almost 11 years now, each season brings new energy and fresh positivity. The 2024 season was undoubtedly challenging for us as a group, but it also provided invaluable lessons,"" the MI captain said.""We analysed those learnings and applied them while building our team for 2025. This time, we have assembled an experienced squad -- players who have played a lot of cricket at the highest level. That in itself is exciting.""Playing in the IPL in Mumbai, particularly at Wankhede, can be intimidating due to the high-scoring nature of the pitch. We wanted bowlers with experience, pace, and the ability to generate swing and bounce. I believe we have put together a well-balanced team, one that meets all our requirements from top to bottom. Now it's about turning up and delivering on the field,"" he added.","Hardik Pandya has been named in India's triumphant T20 World Cup and ICC Champions Trophy teams. The all-rounder is the captain of Mumbai Indians in the upcoming Indian Premier League IPL season. MI finished bottom of the league table in 2024, with Hardik receiving jeers from fans.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119107009,imgsize-44302,width-400,resizemode-4/119107009.jpg"

THE REGULATION

ELIGIBILITY OF A REPLACEMENT PLAYER

WHAT ABOUT THE SALARY CAP?

PLAYERS THAT HAVE BEEN REPLACED SO FAR

Kolkata Knight Riders:

Mumbai Indians:

Sunrisers Hyderabad:

The rules around replacement of players by a team in the Indian Premier League IPL ) became a matter of intrigue after Corbin Bosch's inclusion in the Mumbai Indians' squad for Lizaad Williams was reported as alleged breach of his existing contract with Pakistan Super League (PSL), with Bosch facing legal action from the Pakistan Cricket Board.It, therefore, warrants a re-visit to the rules by the IPL teams who may seek replacements over the course of two-months-long season, which begins on March 22 and ends with the final on May 25.The BCCI has expanded its player replacement policy, permitting teams to bring in substitutes for players facing season-ending injuries or illnesses. The governing body has modified the regulations for the current season, extending the replacement window until the 12th league fixture, compared to the previous limit which only allowed changes up to the seventh match.A player seeking to be a Replacement Player must ensure their name appears on the Registered Available Player Pool (RAPP) list for that season. Additionally, their full-season league fee, based on complete availability, should not be below their self-declared reserve price as specified in the RAPP list.Bowlers on the RAPP listed as net bowlers by a specific franchise can also be picked by other franchises seeking replacements for their injured players. The compensation for a replacement player is capped at the league fee that would have been due to the original player being substituted.The rule specifically reads: ""If a Replacement Player is recruited during a season, the League Fee actually paid to him will be reduced to take account of the Franchisee's Matches during the relevant season which took place before he was registered and any other relevant deductions under the Player Contract."".According to the BCCI rule book, ""The League Fee payable to any Replacement Player signed pursuant to this paragraph 6 will be ignored for the purpose of the Salary Cap for that Season. If a Replacement Player's Player Contract is extended in accordance with its terms, the League Fee payable to the Player for the subsequent Season will be charged against the Salary Cap for the relevant Season.""In any case, the squad size of the franchise can't exceed 25 players.The rule further states, ""For the avoidance of doubt, if a franchisee extends the contract of a replacement player, he shall, for any relevant subsequent season, be treated as any other player for the purpose of the squad composition regulations and the salary cap.""If a replacement is sought in the middle of the season for a player who has already played a game, then, the regulations say that...i) The said injury or illness occurs during or before the 12th League Match of the relevant Team in the Season;ii) a doctor nominated by the BCCI confirms that the injury or illness is season ending (i.e. it means the Player will not be match fit until after the end of the Season (including the Playoffs)iii) absent the injury or illness, the Player would have been available for all of the remaining Matches in the Seasoniv) as a result of the injury or illness the Player would miss the remaining League Matches in that Season.NB: In such circumstances, the Player who is replaced may not play for the Franchisee again in any Match during the relevant Season.Chetan Sakariya (INR 75 lakh, base price) for Umran Malik (INR 75 lakh, base price)Mujeeb-ur-Rahman (INR 2 crore) for Allah Ghazanfar (INR 4.8 crore)Wiaan Mulder (INR 75 lakh, base price) for Brydon Carse (INR 1 crore, base price)MI's second replacement, Bosch for Lizaad, hasn't specified how much bringing in Bosch cost the five-time champions. He remained unsold in the mega auction last November at his base price of INR 30 lakh. Lizaad was acquired by MI for his base price of INR 75 lakh.",The Indian Premier League has expanded its player replacement policy. Teams can bring in substitutes for players facing season-ending injuries or illnesses.

Delhi Capitals Auction Review: DC Targets Shreyas Iyer, Attempts Rishabh Pant, Secures KL Rahul

IPL mega auction: KKR spend Rs 23.75 crore to buy back Venkatesh Iyer

Former England all-rounder Moeen Ali and spinner Adil Rashid have supported BCCI 's decision to ban Harry Brook from the Indian Premier League for two years. The ban comes after Brook withdrew from this year's IPL season , making him ineligible for the auction in the next two years under the board's new policy.Brook has opted out of the IPL for two consecutive seasons, citing preparation time needed for national team commitments. Delhi Capitals had acquired him for Rs 6.25 Crore in the November mega auction, while Sunrisers Hyderabad had previously secured him for Rs 4 crore. He had skipped IPL last season due to the death of his grandmother.""It's not harsh. I kind of agree with it, in a way, because a lot of people do that. A lot of people have done it in the past, and then they come back in and they end up getting a better financial package, or whatever it is. And he kind of messes a lot of things up as well at the same time,"" said Moeen Ali on the podcast""I mean, it's messed his team up, obviously, by pulling out. Any team that loses Harry Brook is messed up a bit, and they've got to now rejig everything and stuff like that. Forget him for a second, but if you do pull out, the rule is that you get a ban unless it's for family reasons or due to injury or something. If it's injury or something, it's different. But I think if you just pull out, then it's. I kind of agree with the teams. You actually mess a lot of stuff up. He's a top player. They've probably picked the team around him, and then all of a sudden, you're pulling out.""England leg-spinner Rashid supported his teammate's perspective. ""They actually put that rule in place before, and then this happened. So, you know when you're going in, this is the rule. So when you put your name in, you know if you pull out, this is going to happen. So you know the consequences of it. So I don't think it's harsh.""""No, but if you pull out and you have, like you say, an injury or whatever, then I think that's where something like the rules may differ or change in that way. Not just him (Harry Brook), but. But this has been going on for, I don't know, for a little while, I reckon. Mo (Moeen Ali) has been in the IPL a lot longer, but in the past probably five, ten years, a lot of players have been selected generally and have pulled out. So that's why they're trying to stop it that way.""","Harry Brook has been banned from the Indian Premier League for two years. The ban comes after Brook withdrew from this year's IPL season. Brook has opted out of the IPL for two consecutive seasons, citing preparation time needed for national team commitments. Moeen Ali and Adil Rashid have supported the ban.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119105321,imgsize-103,width-400,resizemode-4/119105321.jpg"

Barcelona secured a dramatic 4-2 victory against Atletico Madrid after coming back from a two-goal deficit in Sunday's crucial Spanish league match .Lamine Yamal and Ferran Torres scored in stoppage time, helping Barcelona reclaim the top spot in the standings after Real Madrid had temporarily moved ahead following their win against Villarreal on Saturday.Barcelona and Real Madrid are now level on 60 points, with Barcelona holding a game in hand. Atletico Madrid sits four points behind the leaders following their home defeat against Hansi Flick's team, completing a disappointing week after their Champions League exit.""How we play, the confidence we have, it's really good to see. We will try everything to win trophies, the match today gives us more confidence,"" said Flick.Barcelona, who had previously suffered late setbacks against Atletico this season, turned the tables this time, extending their unbeaten run to 18 matches across all competitions.The match saw Julian Alvarez and Alexander Sorloth put Atletico ahead before Robert Lewandowski and Torres equalised for Barcelona, who ultimately secured victory in added time.""I think that after the anger, the feeling of impotence, not being comfortable in the game, we put our best foot forward and gave the best that we have. It was a very important game to win in the end, beating Atletico was a statement win, we put ourselves back as leaders having played a game fewer and we're very happy,"" Yamal told DAZN.Flick had earlier cautioned his players about maintaining focus, following a December incident where they conceded a 96th-minute goal to Atletico, losing their league lead in a 2-1 home defeat.Barcelona's first significant opportunity came near halftime when Pedri set up Lewandowski, whose powerful shot hit the crossbar.Atletico immediately capitalised on the subsequent goal kick, with Antoine Griezmann providing a brilliant pass to Giuliano Simeone, leading to Alvarez's opener.The goal provided some consolation for Alvarez, who had experienced disappointment earlier in the week when his penalty against Real Madrid was controversially disallowed during their Champions League elimination.Diego Simeone refreshed his team with substitutes following their Champions League exit, bringing on Sorloth and Conor Gallagher, who combined for Atletico's second goal.Griezmann played a crucial role in another well-executed team move, with Gallagher assisting Sorloth for his 11th league goal of the season.Barcelona quickly responded despite their protests about a Rodrigo De Paul handball being dismissed. Martinez launched an attack and found Lewandowski, who controlled well and scored.Torres then equalised after receiving a cross from Raphinha, before Yamal's deflected long-range effort put Barcelona ahead in stoppage time.""We have to congratulate our opponent, they had a good game and in the end were very effective with their chances. They had that bit of luck which you have to have, in the deflection for Yamal's goal for 3-2,"" said Simeone.Torres sealed the victory with his second goal in the closing moments.""It was a strange game because we did well in the first half, we had them under control and scored two goals... it's true the 120 minutes in the Champions League weighed on us, and in the end the team fell apart. We will fight to the end (for La Liga ), we have seen many times how things change, you have a good month and someone else has a bad one, and you turn it all around,"" said Atletico's Llorente.",Barcelona come from two goals down to beat Atletico Madrid 4-2 in La Liga.

Leicester set unwanted record

Chelsea 's bid for a Champions League spot weakened following their lifeless 0-1 loss at Arsenal on Sunday, while Fulham secured a 2-0 victory against Tottenham. Manchester United continued their upward trend with a 3-0 win at Leicester.A solitary goal from Mikel Merino settled an uninspiring match at the Emirates, helping Arsenal strengthen their second position and reduce Liverpool's advantage to 12 points.The absence of Cole Palmer through illness proved costly for Chelsea, who delivered a lacklustre performance that hampered their top-four aspirations.Despite maintaining fourth position presently, Chelsea face pressure from five clubs between Manchester City in fifth and Aston Villa in ninth, all within four points of Enzo Maresca's side.Arsenal's goalscoring difficulties have persisted since Kai Havertz's season-ending injury forced midfielder Merino to adopt a forward position. The Spanish international proved decisive from a corner, heading in Martin Odegaard's delivery at the far post after 20 minutes.Whilst Chelsea created few chances, they nearly equalised when David Raya mishandled Marc Cucurella's attempt, with the ball rolling wide.Robert Sanchez produced an excellent save to prevent Merino from scoring Arsenal's second, in what was the half's finest attempt.The match concluded quietly with minimal attacking threat, as the subdued display intensified criticism of Maresca's tactical approach amongst Chelsea supporters.""We did enough to deserve to win the game,"" said Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta. ""Now we have the international break so let's take a chance to breathe and bring some players back hopefully.""Tottenham, fresh from their Europa League quarter-final qualification against AZ Alkmaar on Thursday, experienced another post-European setback at Craven Cottage.Fulham's triumph elevates Marco Silva's team to eighth position, four points from fourth place and three behind fifth.A fifth-place finish should secure Champions League participation next season, owing to English clubs' strong European performances.Spurs have struggled with their Premier League form following European fixtures, winning just three of 10 league matches after Europa League games.Ange Postecoglou's team were second-best throughout, conceding in the 78th minute when Rodrigo Muniz converted Andreas Pereira's pass. Ryan Sessegnon sealed the victory against his previous club with an elegant finish.""It's been a difficult campaign for sure,"" said Spurs captain Son Heung-min.""But I feel we've lost too many games that we should have got stuff out of, and this was one of those games.""United extended their unbeaten streak in open play to seven matches with a convincing win over a struggling Leicester side.Rasmus Hojlund broke his 21-game goal drought by scoring to put United ahead in the 28th minute.Alejandro Garnacho had to be patient for his first goal since November, having been flagged offside early in the second half. However, he eventually found the net with a quick shot that Mads Hermansen should have saved.This victory marked United’s fourth win against Leicester this season, including two matches where Ruud van Nistelrooy served as the interim manager for the Red Devils. Unfortunately for the Dutchman, he hasn't achieved the same success at the King Power Stadium.Leicester's situation has worsened, suffering 13 losses in their last 14 league games and now sitting nine points behind safety. Additionally, they set an unwanted record as the first Premier League team to go seven home games without scoring.Bruno Fernandes capped off United's victory with a brilliant strike from the edge of the box, marking his seventh goal in as many games.",Arsenal beat Chelsea 0-1 at the Emirates.

PANAJI: Whenever Diego Godin closes his eyes and thinks of that magical night of May 17, 2014, at the Camp Nou, the former Atletico de Madrid defender remembers every scene almost perfectly.The frenzied start by hosts Barcelona , a lightning strike from Alexis Sanchez to put the home team ahead and the inspirational half-time talk from his team’s manager, Diego Simeone.It was the concluding clash of La Liga , and having lost the chance to wrap up the Spanish league title earlier, Atletico needed at least a point at the Camp Nou with Barca also chasing the title. Both Diego Costa and Arda Turan were taken off injured in the first 45 minutes. Then, as ends were changed, Godin powered a header from Koke’s corner to put Atletico level and eventually end the duopoly in Spanish football .It was their first league title in 18 years and the first time in ten years anyone outside Barcelona and Real Madrid had had a taste of it.“It wasn’t easy for us to win that championship at the Camp Nou,” Godin, now retired, said during a global media call arranged by La Liga on Saturday. “There were so many emotions, so much joy. If I have to handpick my best memory from my time at Atletico, the key moment was clearly that goal.”Since that 2014 triumph, Atletico have won La Liga just once, with Barcelona and Madrid taking turns to become champions. Now they have another chance as Barcelona visit the Wanda Metropolitano on Sunday. The Catalans are currently just one point ahead of the two Madrid clubs, with a game in hand.Defeat at Getafe last week put a massive dent in Atletico’s own title bid.“I wouldn’t say it’s a decisive clash but it’s an important one in the title race. If Atletico win, it will help the team a lot and lift their morale after their elimination from the Champions League (against rivals Real Madrid on penalties). Another defeat will be very hard to take,"" said Godin.“The (Champions League) defeat was very painful. It hurts more because Atletico were really enthusiastic and excited about going through (to the next stage). When you are eliminated from a competition where you’re so excited, you feel very empty (after a defeat).”Under Simeone, the former Uruguay captain and the country’s most capped footballer turned himself into a leader and the force around whom the team revolved. For nine years, he made close to 400 appearances, winning La Liga, two Europa Leagues, one Copa del Rey, one Spanish Super Cup and three UEFA Super Cups.Atletico also made it to the final of the Champions League twice, only to lose both times to bitter rivals Real Madrid.“When I joined, Atletico were a long way from Barcelona and Real Madrid but now it’s a team that can compete on equal terms. We’ve won leagues against them. We’ve got to the finals of Champions League, of Copa del Rey, the Super Cup.“So, you can imagine how the club has grown, and how the club continues to grow. It’s got better quality players, young players. The very equal competitiveness in sporting terms with Real and Barca is important. We cannot compete with them in terms of their finances, but in terms of sport, we can give them a fight,” said Godin.",Diego Godin won the La Liga title with Atletico de Madrid in May 2014. Godin scored the winning goal against Barcelona at the Camp Nou. Atletico have won La Liga just once since that triumph.

It will be a challenging task, but senior defender Sandesh Jhingan expressed on Saturday that the Indian football team aims to defeat Maldives and Bangladesh without conceding a goal in the upcoming international matches. India is set to host Maldives in an international friendly on March 19, followed by a crucial clash against Bangladesh on March 25 in their opening match of the 2027 AFC Asian Cup qualifying third round.Both matches will take place at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium in Shillong, marking the first time the Meghalaya capital will host international games. The match against Maldives will also witness the return of the legendary Sunil Chhetri from international retirement.""Our main aim is to get the result in the Bangladesh match, as that would give us a good start in the Asian Cup Qualifiers, and I think the 10-day training ahead of that, along with the friendly against Maldives will greatly help us prepare for it,"" Jhingan said.""Our target is two clean sheet victories,"" the 31-year-old was quoted as saying in an AIFF release.The 40-year-old Chhetri had announced his retirement in June 2024 after a stellar international career that began in 2005. However, he has demonstrated his continued prowess in the 2024-25 ISL season, where he scored 12 goals in 24 matches, becoming the second-highest scorer overall and the top Indian scorer.Head coach Manolo Marquez explained the rationale behind convincing Chhetri to return to the national team.""Because it was a special situation, I spoke with the AIFF and Bengaluru FC before I called him. I spoke with Sunil and explained to him what I wanted from him,"" Marquez said.""It doesn't matter if he's 40. The national team needs players who are in good form,"" the Spaniard added.India is placed in Group C of the 2027 Asian Cup qualifying third round, alongside Bangladesh, Hong Kong, and Singapore. Only the top team will secure a spot in the continental tournament.It will be a tough challenge to top the group, which Marquez acknowledged when he referred to the ""special situation.""""Sunil is the Indian top-scorer in the ISL, with practically double goals than the next player, who is Brison. After that are Subhasish, Irfan, Manvir... all of them are here with us in the national team.""We need players who score goals. In my four matches so far, we have only scored two goals - one of them from a set-piece. At this moment, the most important thing is to get results. Nothing else matters.""The Indian squad held a 45-minute gym session on Saturday morning and had their first on-pitch training session at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium, the match venue, later in the evening.","Sandesh Jhingan says Indian football team aims to defeat Maldives and Bangladesh without conceding a goal in upcoming international matches.

I felt like I was in control. I knew what I needed to do. I just went for it and played to win.""In his first Masters 1000 final, Draper established control early, taking a 4-0 lead. He lost only four points on serve in the opening set, while Rune committed 10 of his 19 unforced errors.Rune, who had previously won the Paris Masters in 2022, managed to hold serve twice before losing the first set. The set concluded with Draper's ace, followed by Rune's backhand error.""I think today was very clear that I didn't play well enough. He was serving amazing, for sure. But I think I could have done my part better. Jack was playing extremely well, but the few chances I had to make it difficult for him, I didn't quite take them, because I wasn't really trusting every shot of my game today.""The second set began with Draper breaking Rune's serve.

""My serve was really struggling. I didn't feel like I was in control of the ball, and I lost my way mentally last year.""So I knew coming here this year is a challenge, but not only for me but for a lot of the players. I think Taylor and Carlos play in a way where they are very aggressive with their forehand, they serve great.""As the matches went on, I felt more and more confident in these conditions.""Draper, who claimed his two prior ATP titles in 2024, said his biggest title to date was a testament to his perseverance.""I feel like I deserve it, in all honesty,"" he said.

Carlos came out a little flat, I sensed that. I had a chance in the first game of the second, and he came up with an ace... What happened to him happened to me, I got tight, I had low energy.

BENGALURU: The first two months of the 2025 tennis season has been all uphill for Sumit Nagal , starting in Melbourne in January and then on clay in Rosario and Buenos Aires, laid low by a flu.The 27-year-old will make a return to tournament play in the ATP Challenger in Murcia next week after staying away from the Tour for about a month.Nagal, whose ranking is down to 132, was thrown a curveball by what he suspects was a bout of Covid-19 in January. The Indian, who chose the rigour of the South American swing over the four-week ATP Challenger series in India in February, was caught unawares in Argentina.“If I knew I was (so) unwell I would never have gone to South America,” Nagal told TOI during a telephone interview. “You’re going so far away, not feeling your best, that makes no sense.”Nagal, who has spent the last few weeks at his training base in Germany, is gradually working his way back.“I never really felt good since Australia, it was maybe Covid-19 over there, I wasn’t sure,” the India No.1 said. “When I was in Argentina I was practicing a bit and then I wasn’t really practicing. It wasn’t a great few weeks for me. I was struggling so much with my health, I was fatigued, I was barely practicing. And when I practiced or played I would feel super tired.”“It has been good in the last two weeks. I have been practicing quite a bit, pushing a bit,” said Nagal, who marked his fitness at eight on a scale of 1 to 10.Nagal, who climbed to a career-high No.68 in the ranking last July, is now chasing a main draw berth at Roland Garros. He’s scheduled to play two ATP Challengers, followed by Monte Carlo Masters 1000, where he went through qualifiers last year to make the round of 32, after which the Indian will look at 250 Series tournaments.While there are nine Indians in the top-150 of the doubles rankings, Nagal is the only Indian in the top-250 of the singles rankings on the men’s and women’s tours.","Sumit Nagal will make a return to tournament play in the ATP Challenger in Murcia next week.

Sabalenka trounces Keys in Australian Open re-match

Russian teenager Mirra Andreeva ended the defending champion Iga Swiatek 's quest for a historic third Indian Wells title, defeating the world number two 7-6 (1), 1-6, 6-3 on Friday to advance to the final.At just 17, Andreeva snapped Swiatek's 10-match winning streak at Indian Wells, marking her second victory over the Polish star in three weeks—having previously triumphed in Dubai's quarter-finals en route to becoming the youngest WTA 1000 champion ever.On Sunday, Andreeva will face Aryna Sabalenka , who dominated Australian Open champion Madison Keys . The American veteran Keys had denied Sabalenka a third consecutive title in Melbourne, where she claimed her first major in January.Andreeva is the youngest finalist at Indian Wells since Kim Clijsters, who was 17 in 2001.In the match against Swiatek, Andreeva showcased her skills in the first set tiebreaker and managed to regroup after a challenging second set.Although Swiatek started confidently, dropping only one point in her first three service games, Andreeva seized a 5-4 lead with a crucial break, benefiting from a double fault by Swiatek. The match proceeded to a tiebreaker where Andreeva dominated.""I felt like I'm gonna go and play the tiebreak like it's the last tiebreak of my life,"" she said. ""So I just went for all my shots. My serve was great. I just felt super comfortable and confident,"" she said.""I saw my mom's nervous face in the big screen,"" Andreeva told the crowd. ""I tried not to look there.""Despite Swiatek rebounding in the second set with three breaks, the momentum shifted back to Andreeva in the third. She ultimately secured victory with her third break of the set.""I just decided to kind of still play the same but maybe go for my shots more, trying to play a little bit more aggressive,"" she said.""I feel also that I was dealing with the nerves and the pressure pretty good, so I just feel proud of myself.""World number one Aryna Sabalenka dispatched Madison Keys 6-0, 6-1 to reach the Indian Wells final, avenging her loss to the fifth-ranked American in the Australian Open final.In just 51 minutes, Sabalenka set up a title match against Andreeva.The Belarusian, seeking revenge after her January defeat to Keys, was sharp from the start, completing the first set in just 23 minutes.""I was hungry,"" said Sabalenka, who had made no bones about wanting revenge. ""That Australian Open match was really heartbroken for me, and I really needed some time to recover after that.""And if I would lose today again, it would get in my head and I didn't want that to happen. I was really focused -- I was just really hungry to get this win against Madison.""Keys, who had a 16-match winning streak culminating in her Australian Open victory, struggled to make an impact.""I think tactically I played really great tennis,"" said Sabalenka, adding her strategy was to ""just keep her out of the rhythm"".Despite overcoming the cold, swirling winds on Stadium Court and winning the first 11 games, Sabalenka's dominance was clear. Keys managed to hold serve for the first time at 5-1 in the second set, but Sabalenka quickly closed out the match.This marks Sabalenka's second appearance in the Indian Wells final; she was the runner-up to Elena Rybakina in 2023.","Russian teenager Mirra Andreeva beat defending champion Iga Swiatek 7-6 (1), 1-6, 6-3.

Madison Keys powered into the Indian Wells semifinals on Thursday, dismantling wild-card Belinda Bencic 6-1, 6-1 in just 65 minutes to notch her 16th straight victory. The fifth-seeded American, who claimed the Australian Open title earlier this year, now sets up a highly anticipated rematch with world No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka . The two last met at Melbourne Park in January, where Keys defeated Sabalenka in a three-set battle, halting the Belarusian’s bid for a third straight title.Despite upsetting No. 4 seed Coco Gauff in the previous round, Bencic — a 28-year-old from Switzerland — had no answers for Keys’ relentless play.Elsewhere in the women’s draw, defending champion Iga Swiatek continued her dominant run in the California desert, advancing to her fourth straight semifinal at Indian Wells with a 6-3, 6-3 win over eighth-seeded Qinwen Zheng. Swiatek, the No. 2 seed and a five-time Grand Slam winner, is aiming to become the first woman to win the event three times. She’s riding a 10-match win streak at Indian Wells, having also lifted the trophy in 2022.Zheng, who had ended Swiatek’s 25-match winning streak at the Paris Olympics last year, couldn’t replicate that magic. Though she broke Swiatek twice and won six games — equaling the total games Swiatek had lost all tournament — the Polish star converted all five of her break points to seal the match.In the men’s draw, two-time defending champion Carlos Alcaraz fought off determined challenger Francisco Cerundolo 6-3, 7-6 (7/4) to reach the semi-finals.On another cold, blustery night in the California desert, Alcaraz battled back from 1-4 down in the second set, coming up with a break and two love service holds to force the tiebreaker as he kept his bid to join Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic as the only men to win three straight Indian Wells titles on track.Alcaraz had to save break points in each of his first three service games. But after an emphatic hold for 4-3 he gained the first break of the contest with a deft volley and just like that he was serving for the first set.After sliding to pop a drop volley winner over the net for set point Alcaraz drilled a deep forehand that Cerundolo could barely get a racquet on.But it was Cerundolo who broke first in the second, finally converting his ninth break point of the match then holding for 4-1.But he couldn't hold off the world number three, who raced to a 5-2 lead in the tiebreaker on the way to victory.""It was really difficult for me to start the match,"" said Alcaraz, who looked less comfortable in the windy weather than he did just a day before.""He got a lot of chances in the first set,"" Alcaraz said. ""I'm just pleased about saving all of them and taking the only one that I had.""I didn't hit the ball as clear as yesterday, but I just did what I had to and that's what it's about.""Alcaraz next faces Britain's Jack Draper, who reached his first Masters 1000 semi-final with a 6-4, 7-5 victory over American Ben Shelton.Draper took the opening set with one break of serve then rallied from 0-3 down in a second-set slug-fest.Shelton's 32 unforced errors included five double-faults -- including one to hand Draper a break for 6-5 in the second.Russian Daniil Medvedev , runner-up to Alcaraz each of the past two years, rallied from a break down in a wild, wind-blown final set to beat Arthur Fils 6-4, 2-6, 7-6 (9/7).The world number six booked a semi-final meeting with Denmark's Holger Rune , a 5-7, 6-0, 6-3 winner over Tallon Griekspoor.Medvedev, a six-time Grand Slam finalist, trailed 20-year-old Fils 2-4 in the third set of a compelling clash that was momentarily paused as gusting winds sent towels and trash cans flying on Stadium Court.France's Fils had shown admirable maturity in the face of Medvedev's formidable defensive skills.He cut down on the unforced errors that marred his first set to win the second with ease and maintained his poise as he erased an early break in the third to seize the lead.But Medvedev wouldn't be denied and after forcing the tiebreaker prevailed on his third match point when Fils pushed a backhand volley long.Medvedev, who had won just one of his past nine third-set tiebreakers, gave a leap of sheer joy after securing the win in 2 hours and 25 minutes to keep alive his bid for a first title since 2023 -- when he won five.""I lost a lot of tight matches this year where I could have won, should have won maybe,"" Medvedev said. ""I have lost a lot of tight matches where it goes a little bit 50-50 and the more it goes like that, the more you can lose confidence in the tight moments.""I was happy I was able to get over the line as he saved some match points and had a break lead in the third. I am just happy to win.""Medvedev faces another young gun in Rune, who burst onto the scene in 2022 with a win over Novak Djokovic in the Paris Masters final.Rune has struggled often since, but after dropping the first set he dominated Griekspoor, the 43rd-ranked Dutchman who had ousted top-seeded Alexander Zverev in the second round.","Madison Keys crushes wild-card Belinda Bencic 6-1,6-1 in just 65 minutes to notch her 16th straight victory.

NEW DELHI: Mirra Andreeva ’s stunning rise in the WTA rankings has been so rapid that even the 17-year-old Russian admits she can’t quite keep up with it. Just last month in Dubai, she made history as the youngest-ever WTA 1000 champion , defeating both Grand Slam winners Iga Swiatek and Elena Rybakina on her way to the title — a win that catapulted her into the top 10 for the first time, landing at No. 9.Now at Indian Wells , Andreeva entered the tournament ranked 11th, but wins over Rybakina once again in the fourth round and Elina Svitolina in the quarter-finals are expected to lift her back into the top 10. Not that she’s been checking too closely.""Before, I was always checking live rankings because before I was playing for a dog,"" Andreeva said with a smile. ""So after every match I play I would check the live rankings to see if I did it.""That milestone — breaking into the top 20 — came after she defeated Magda Linette in Beijing last October. The reward? A promise of a dog. But even now, the pet hasn’t arrived yet, as she’s still narrowing down her choice.""I'm thinking to get an ultra mini labradoodle ,"" she revealed. ""It's going to be a labrador mixed with poodle and it's ultra min, so going to be even smaller than a mini version. It's going to take time until the dog that I want will be born.""While rankings may not be her primary focus anymore, Andreeva is channeling her energy into what’s right in front of her — like an upcoming semi-final clash at Indian Wells against defending champion Swiatek. Despite her recent win over the Pole in Dubai, she’s not expecting it to give her any advantage.""It doesn't give me any benefit to our match (on Friday),"" she admitted.Tennis has become increasingly serious for the teenager, but she's not letting that take the fun out of the game completely. The young star, who draws inspiration from athletes like Roger Federer and LeBron James, is trying to balance focus with enjoyment.""When I was a bit younger it would all be about having fun,"" Andreeva said. ""But now I start to understand that it's pretty serious what I do out here.

NEW DELHI: Carlos Alcaraz , the two-time defending champion, showcased his dominance at the ATP Indian Wells Masters on Wednesday. The world number three from Spain overcame the challenging windy conditions on Stadium Court to deliver a commanding performance against Grigor Dimitrov , defeating him 6-1, 6-1.Alcaraz's victory denied Dimitrov's bid to join Canadian Felix Auger-Aliassime as the only players to beat the Spaniard in three consecutive meetings. The Bulgarian had previously won their last two encounters, including the quarter-finals at the Miami Open last year.With his 50th ATP Masters 1000 match win, Alcaraz kept his hopes alive of joining Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic as the only men to win three consecutive Indian Wells titles.Having reached the fourth round without dropping a set, Alcaraz produced his most impressive performance of the tournament. Despite the swirling winds that caused ball kids to scramble after blowing trash, Alcaraz appeared supremely untroubled.He broke Dimitrov's serve to open the match and secured the first set with another break. Alcaraz didn't face a break point until the fifth game of the second set, but he overcame that challenge with an ace on Dimitrov's third break chance. Alcaraz then broke the Bulgarian's serve to take a 5-1 lead.Alcaraz sealed the victory in style, earning a match point with his sixth ace of the match and clinching the win with a forehand winner. He will next face Argentina's Francisco Cerundolo , who defeated Australian Alex de Minaur 7-5, 6-3, for a place in the semi-finals.","Carlos Alcaraz defeated Grigor Dimitrov 6-1, 6- 1 in the fourth round of the ATP Indian Wells Masters.

NEW DELHI: Belinda Bencic produced a stunning comeback to upset world number three Coco Gauff on Wednesday, booking her place in the Indian Wells quarter-finals where she will face Australian Open champion Madison Keys .The Swiss star, who gave birth to her daughter Bella last April, triumphed 3-6, 6-3, 6-4 to reach her first WTA 1000 quarter-final since becoming a mother. Unranked when she returned to the tour in October, Bencic has steadily climbed back, capturing her ninth career title in Abu Dhabi last month and rising to 58th in the world this week.“I just kept on working also on the physical side,” Bencic said. “In the last matches in tournaments, I was able to play back-to-back, some three-set matches, and am fresher every time. The body is holding up much better, almost like it was before.”Bencic showed remarkable poise against Gauff, recovering from a first-set loss and keeping the American under constant pressure. Gauff, who had beaten Bencic at the Australian Open earlier this year, struggled with her forehand and gave away the crucial break with a loose return at 4-4 in the deciding set.Keys also had to fight back in her match, defeating Croatia’s Donna Vekic 4-6, 7-6 (9/7), 6-3. After failing to convert a set point in the second set and trailing 3-5 in the tiebreak, the American dug deep and eventually powered through, breaking twice in the third set to seal victory with a fierce backhand return.In the men’s draw, Ben Shelton downed Brandon Nakashima 7-6 (8/6), 6-1 to reach his third ATP Masters 1000 quarter-final. The 22-year-old became the youngest American in the Indian Wells last eight since Andy Roddick in 2004.Women’s world number one Aryna Sabalenka cruised past Sonay Kartal 6-1, 6-2 and will meet either Jasmine Paolini or Liudmila Samsonova in the quarters.","Belinda Bencic beats Coco Gauff to reach Indian Wells quarter-finals.

NEW DELHI: Holger Rune delivered one of the most jaw-dropping moments of Indian Wells 2025 on Tuesday, hitting a between-the-legs winner to save break point en route to a straight-sets victory over Stefanos Tsitsipas . But as thrilled as the crowd was, Rune was just as excited — at least until he saw the replay.""You know, I kind of had the expectation that I looked like Roger Federer when I hit it, and I didn't quite do that,"" Rune said with a laugh after his 6-4, 6-4 win. ""So that was disappointing.""The 21-year-old Dane’s flashy shot wasn’t just for show — it helped him knock off the world No. 9 and book a spot in the Indian Wells quarterfinals for the second consecutive year.It also marked Rune’s first quarterfinal appearance of 2025, a year that hasn’t quite lived up to expectations for the former world No. 4.After bursting onto the scene in 2022 with a memorable win over Novak Djokovic at the Paris Masters, Rune has struggled to maintain consistency, slipping to 13th in the rankings while contemporaries like Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner continue to climb.Still, Rune is staying focused, emphasising growth over frustration.""It's about making results, but at the same time improving your game and having stability,"" he said. ""Because I don't believe I have become the worse player the last two years. I actually think the opposite. I think I have become a better all-around player.""He admits falling short of expectations can sting. ""You know, when you have these expectations and you don't quite, like, live up to them, of course it's disappointing,"" he said.""But it's very basic and maybe it's very boring to say it, but I just love tennis .""So even not being satisfied with my results, I still love to go down to the practice court and hit forehands, backhands, work on my shots, my physicality ... I think I'm living my dream.""",Holger Rune beat Stefanos Tsitsipas in straight sets at Indian Wells. Rune hit a between-the-legs winner to save break point.

Inside story of why Shubman Gill was DROPPED from India T20I World Cup squad

Nothing dramatic was expected when BCCI chief selector Ajit Agarkar and India’s T20I captain Suryakumar Yadav unveiled the squad for the 2026 T20 World Cup on Saturday. The build-up suggested continuity rather than surprise. That is why the omission of Shubman Gill landed with such force, instantly becoming the biggest talking point around India’s plans to defend their title at the tournament co-hosted by Sri Lanka next year.Gill, once a first-choice opener and the vice-captain in the format, being left out was not just a personal setback. It sent a clear signal about the direction the selectors want to take. His absence effectively confirmed that Sanju Samson is set to return to the top of the order, a move that has been widely debated and demanded in Indian cricket circles over the past year.Samson’s case was strengthened publicly by his aggressive cameo of 37 off 22 balls in the fifth T20I against South Africa in Ahmedabad, an innings that showcased his intent and powerplay impact. However, former India off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin believes that knock had little to do with the final call.Speaking on his YouTube channel Ash ki Baat, Ashwin said the decision was already locked in well before that match. According to him, the shift in combination had been evident for some time, and Samson’s selection over Gill was more procedural than reactive.Ashwin pointed out that once Gill was ruled out of the last two T20Is due to injury, the writing was on the wall. From that moment, he felt it was obvious that Samson would be part of India’s World Cup plans. Drawing on his long international experience, Ashwin described the process as straightforward rather than analytical.Samson’s inclusion also shaped the rest of the squad. The selectors opted for a second wicketkeeper with a similar skill set, bringing back Ishan Kishan after his strong Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy campaign, where he captained Jharkhand to their first title and led the batting from the front.That balance at the top gave the team management room to tweak the lower order. Rinku Singh was preferred as the finishing option, replacing Jitesh Sharma, while Axar Patel was reinstated as vice-captain to support Suryakumar Yadav in the leadership group.Taken together, the selections underline a clear shift in India’s T20 thinking, prioritising explosive starts, flexible wicketkeeping options, and defined roles as they look ahead to the challenges of the next World Cup.","Shubman Gill left out of India's squad for 2026 T20 World Cup.

Inside story of why Shubman Gill was DROPPED from India T20I World Cup squad

India’s T20I squad for the 2026 World Cup threw up a major talking point, with Shubman Gill left out and Axar Patel named vice-captain instead. The decision caught many by surprise, including Sunil Gavaskar , who admitted on air that he did not see Gill’s omission coming.Reacting to the squad announcement, the former India captain said the call genuinely shocked him. “Not a bit of a surprise, it is a surprise,” Gavaskar remarked, making it clear that Gill’s absence was unexpected.Gavaskar was quick to underline Gill’s quality, even while acknowledging his recent struggles. He described Gill as a class batter who has enjoyed an excellent run with the bat in the recent past. While conceding that Gill found it tough in the series against South Africa, Gavaskar stressed that form can fluctuate, but class remains constant.He also pointed to the challenges of returning to T20 cricket after time away from the game. According to Gavaskar, a lack of rhythm can be brutally exposed in the shortest format, where batters are expected to attack from the very first ball. Coming off a long layoff, Gill appeared short of timing, which made the task even harder.Gavaskar explained that Gill’s natural game is more suited to longer formats, with an emphasis on timing and playing along the ground.When rhythm is missing, adjusting to the range of shots required in T20 cricket does not come easily. However, he was clear that this does not mean Gill is unsuited to the format, pointing out Gill’s strong performances in the IPL as proof of his T20 credentials.Adding a personal touch, Gavaskar revealed that he had just travelled from Ahmedabad on the same flight as Gill and India captain Suryakumar Yadav . During their brief interaction, Gavaskar said he offered Gill some heartfelt advice, saying he told Gill to ask someone elder at home to ward off the evil eye. “Ghar pe kisiko bolo nazar utar de. You know, because we believe in that. We believe in ki kabhi kabhi nazar lag jaati hain,” Gavaskar said, adding that his words came only from a place of care and goodwill for the young batter.Despite the omission, Gavaskar’s words reflected continued faith in Gill’s ability and a belief that the right-handed batter will find his way back once rhythm and fortune return.",Shubman Gill left out of India's T20I squad for the 2026 World Cup.

Curious case! Why Ajit Agarkar & Co. continue to ignore Ishan Kishan

When Jharkhand players were deservingly celebrating with the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy at the MCA Stadium in Gahunje, two former India players looked at the frenzy from the sidelines. Saurabh Tiwary and Shahbaz Nadeem reluctantly joined the team for a picture with the trophy only upon skipper Ishan Kishan and his teammates’ insistence.It was 15 years ago, in 2011, when Jharkhand lifted a BCCI trophy when Tiwary’s team defeated a strong Parthiv Patel-led Gujarat by 159 runs in the Vijay Hazare final. The star of that match was Nadeem by taking four wickets in four overs in exchange for only six runs. He was deservedly declared player of the match. The duo is still doing their job of making their team win, albeit, in different capacities.The former players have now turned into full-time administrators, with Tiwary taking the Jharkhand Cricket Association’s secretary’s position and Nadeem managing the joint-secretary's role. “This trophy means a lot for us as it has come after a long time. I feel the credit goes to the players, the support staff for making this happen,” a visibly overwhelmed Tiwary said.“Hopefully, in the coming days, we will play many more finals in various formats,” he added.Nadeem said though the association was on the right track, significant changes have been made in the overall working and results will follow.“It isn't that Jharkhand didn’t reach the finals of important tournaments be fore. But there were some areas that nee ded improvement. I would say, we were 80 per cent there, but at this level, even 20 per cent matters a lot. Our aim is to work on that 20 per cent,” the former India left arm spinner said. “The team did not depend on any individual. Everybody played their part. We played as a strong team,” he added.He said the experience of their playing days helped them plan things better. “During our playing days, we found some things, facilities, lacking for players. We tried to fill in the gaps and will lo ok for more holes to fill,” he added.“I feel we have emphasized a lot on players’ freedom to express themselves in the matches. As far as the changes in the association are concerned, I feel the inclusion of multi-day formats in the age-group cricket has been vital. Earlier we had limited overs matches only, but we took this decision to start days cricket and I feel it was needed,” Nadeem said.When it is Jharkhand, Mahendra Singh Dhoni can’t be far from discussion. Nadeem said the former India skipper played an important role in boosting the team's morale and also gave suggestions to the association.“Before the season, when we were selecting the coaches, the support staff and selectors, MS bhai’s involvement was there. Be it women’s cricket, age group teams, he gave his inputs for each team,” Nadeem said.",Jharkhand lifted the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy at the MCA Stadium in Gahunje.

Fans throw objects, vandalise stadium after Messi leaves early | Hyderabad next

Former India captain Sourav Ganguly has taken legal action against Uttam Saha, the president of the Argentina Fan Club of Kolkata, by filing a defamation case seeking Rs 50 crore in damages. The move follows allegations made by Saha linking Ganguly to the controversy surrounding the chaotic Yuva Bharati Stadium event during Lionel Messi ’s visit to Kolkata on Saturday, December 13.The complaint, lodged at Lalbazar, states that Saha’s public remarks were baseless and caused serious damage to Ganguly’s reputation. Ganguly has termed the accusations “false, malicious, offensive and defamatory”, alleging that they were made with full knowledge of the harm they could cause to his public image.Currently serving as the president of the Cricket Association of Bengal, Ganguly clarified in his complaint that he had no official role in organising or managing the Messi event. He maintained that his presence at the stadium was strictly as an invited guest and that he had no involvement in the planning or execution of the programme.The legal action adds a new dimension to the fallout from Messi’s much-hyped visit to Kolkata, which descended into disorder and sparked widespread criticism.Ganguly’s complaint specifically challenges claims made by Saha that he acted as a middleman in the management of the event, which was overseen by its main organiser, Satadru Dutta.“Serious allegations are being made publicly without any factual basis,” Ganguly stated in his filing. His legal representatives have since issued a notice to Saha, demanding a retraction of the statements and compensation for the alleged damage caused.Following the chaos at the venue, event organiser Satadru Dutta was detained for questioning by authorities. West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee later issued a public apology on X, expressing regret over the mismanagement of the event and apologising to Lionel Messi as well as football fans in Kolkata who were unable to see the Argentine star properly.During the event at Yuva Bharati Stadium, Ganguly was present in a separate area of the venue. As the situation in the stands deteriorated, he was seen exiting the stadium, visibly disappointed by the turn of events.The Messi programme was widely criticised for poor planning and crowd control, leaving fans frustrated after paying hefty ticket prices in anticipation of a memorable experience. Instead, scenes of disorder dominated coverage, drawing national and international attention to shortcomings in the organisation of high-profile sporting events in India.The incident also revived debates around VIP culture at major sports functions. Reports and videos highlighted limited fan interaction with Messi, while officials and invited guests occupied the field area, further fuelling anger among supporters and adding to the backlash surrounding the event.",Sourav Ganguly has filed a defamation case against Uttam Saha.

NEW DELHI: With just 50 days to go for the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup in India and Sri Lanka, Team India’s numbers no longer scream dominance, even if recent results offer some comfort.As defending champions, India began their post 2024 title run in ruthless fashion, winning 17 of their next 20 T20Is. Nine scores crossed the 200 mark, five of them were 220 plus and three breached 245 mark, underlining a batting unit operating well ahead of the curve. That curve has flattened since the 2025 Asia Cup. India’s overall strike rate has dropped to 141.64, a worrying decline for a side that had redefined intent at the top of the order.Since the Asia Cup, Abhishek Sharma remains the only Indian batter striking above 145. Everyone else has slowed down, and the biggest talking point has shifted to the new opening combination. The Sanju Samson–Abhishek Sharma partnership set the tone for India’s surge after the 2024 World Cup. Across 13 innings, the pair scored at a run rate of 10.05 and averaged 25.38. That early momentum allowed India to sustain a strike rate of 154.56 through the middle overs and 169.39 at the death.The dynamic shifted when Shubman Gill returned to the playing XI as part of the management’s long-term leadership plan. Samson, who amassed 417 runs in 12 T20Is at a strike rate of 183.70 with three centuries at the top, was pushed down the order.His Asia Cup returns were mixed, though he still finished as India’s third highest run-getter with 132 runs, behind Abhishek Sharma’s 314 and Tilak Varma’s 213. A solitary outing in Australia at No. 3 ended without impact, after which Samson was dropped from the playing XI.Gill’s own returns since his comeback have been underwhelming. In 15 matches, he has scored 291 runs at an average of 24.25 and a strike rate of 137, without a single fifty. The numbers point to a batter searching for rhythm at a time when India’s top order needs clarity more than caution.Speaking at the JioStar Press Room ahead of the upcoming T20 World Cup, former India batter Robin Uthappa , who was part of the 2007 World Cup winning squad, was clear about the balance he wants to see. “I would not personally like to tinker with the opening combination,” JioStar expert Uthappa said. “What I would like is to see Sanju bat at No. 3, Tilak at No. 4 and Surya at No. 5. Suryakumar Yadav plays his best cricket outside the powerplay. Tilak Verma needs a pivotal role in this team and that is why No. 4 suits him.”Uthappa explained that placing Tilak Verma at No. 4 and Suryakumar Yadav at No. 5 would free up the top order. “This gives the openers and the No. 3 position the authority to go hard,” he said.He then addressed Gill’s role directly. “You can have someone like Shubman Gill play that sheet anchor role that India desperately need right now, so everyone else can play aggressively around him. India can still use the hyper aggressive batting template that has worked for them, while Gill bats at a 140 to 150 strike rate, which is where he thrives. It is similar to the role Virat Kohli played in the last T20 World Cup. ”The concerns, however, extend beyond Gill alone. India’s intent has also dipped due to Suryakumar’s prolonged lean patch. In 2025, the captain has scored just 213 runs from 20 matches at an average of 14.20 and a strike rate of 125.29. With both captain and vice-captain struggling for form, pressure has inevitably shifted on to the middle order.At the same interaction, former India all-rounder Irfan Pathan stressed that the phase of experimentation must now come to an end. “There has been a lot of talk about chopping and changing,” JioStar expert Pathan said. “I think the team management was trying to understand who can play different roles, but this is not the time to experiment. When the World Cup starts, it has to be very clear who is batting at what position.”That experimentation has been evident. In the last two T20I series against Australia and South Africa, India tried multiple options at No. 3, including Sanju Samson, Shivam Dube, Suryakumar Yadav, Tilak Varma and even Axar Patel.Pathan also did not hide his concern over Suryakumar’s form. “As a captain, you need to bat well and be in form going into a big tournament like the World Cup,” he said. “The concern is not just that he is not scoring runs, but that his strike rate is also going down. His strike rate is generally around 166, but over the last year it has come down to around 119.”Referring to Abhishek Sharma’s high risk approach at the top, Pathan said that such a style will inevitably lead to occasional early dismissals and that is acceptable. “He does not need to change,” Pathan said. “That is why he has been successful. But then the pressure comes on the middle order. When you have an in-form Suryakumar Yadav, it becomes a completely different game. Hopefully, he finds a way to stay a bit longer at the crease and get those runs before the World Cup. ”What Team India needs right now is certainty of roles. With the World Cup fast approaching, rediscovering tempo, fixing roles and getting their leaders back among the runs may matter far more than any tactical tweak.","Team India's numbers no longer scream dominance, even if recent results offer some comfort. India’s overall strike rate has dropped to 141.64, a worrying decline for a side that had redefined intent at the top of the order. The biggest talking point has shifted to the new opening combination.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126079854,imgsize-117706,width-400,resizemode-4/ind-vs-sa-5th-t20i-match.jpg"

Inside story of why Shubman Gill was DROPPED from India T20I World Cup squad

Former India cricketer Dinesh Karthik said he was surprised by the exclusion of Shubman Gill from India’s squads for the T20 World Cup 2026 and the upcoming T20I series against New Zealand. Karthik also said he was disappointed to see Jitesh Sharma left out.The squad was announced on Saturday by BCCI secretary Devajit Saikia, captain Suryakumar Yadav and chief selector Ajit Agarkar. Axar Patel was named vice-captain. Ishan Kishan returned to the T20I side after leading Jharkhand to the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy title, while Rinku Singh was also recalled after missing the recent 3-1 series win in South Africa.Reacting to the selection, Karthik said the omissions of Gill and Jitesh came as a shock.""The big news of the day: India World Cup T20 squad is announced and guess what? Shubman Gill, the current vice captain of the T20 team, incumbent opener has been dropped. Not just from the XI but from the squad. They wanted to bring in an extra opener and they brought in Ishan Kishan and dropped Jitesh Sharma as well. And instead of Jitesh Sharma, it’s gonna be Rinku Singh. That is huge news. Dropping Shubman Gill and Jitesh Sharma.I didn’t see it coming. Just tells you there’s a little bit of clarity lacking. They have backed Shubman Gill for so long and come the day they pick the squad, they have let him go,” Karthik said on Instagram.Karthik said India still have a strong squad based on the players selected. He pointed to Abhishek Sharma, Varun Chakaravarthy, Hardik Pandya and Jasprit Bumrah as key players across roles, saying their presence gives India a solid playing XI.“India looks a strong squad on paper, no matter what names you add there, this team is a solid team. Across every skillset, they have the best in the world: best opener: Abhishek Sharma, best spinner: Varun Chakaravarthy, best allrounder in the world: Hardik Pandya, the best fast bowler ever maybe: Jasprit Bumrah. So with those 4 in the squad, you are going to have a strong XI walking into that World Cup,” he said.He also flagged two areas of concern. Karthik noted that India will play a T20 World Cup without Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli for the first time, and said Suryakumar Yadav’s recent form could be an issue, while backing him to recover.“Couple of areas of vulnerabilities that India would have: For the first time ever in a T20 World Cup, they will have no experience of the greatest two that’s probably ever played in Rohit Sharma or Virat Kohli in a World Cup team. And the second point would be Suryakumar Yadav’s form. But we all know how good he is. That vulnerable aspect will it change into a strength when he finds form? It definitely will. Well, let’s just finish by saying: Shubman Gill. Didn’t see that coming. And I feel really bad for Jitesh Sharma. 2 shocking omissions from this squad,” he added.India will begin their T20 World Cup campaign on February 7 against the United States at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai. They will play Namibia on February 12 in New Delhi, face Pakistan on February 15 in Colombo, and conclude their group stage against the Netherlands on February 18 in Ahmedabad.","Former India cricketer Dinesh Karthik said he was surprised by the exclusion of Shubman Gill from India’s squads for the T20 World Cup 2026 and the upcoming T20I series against New Zealand.

India World Cup squad: No Shubman Gill, Jitesh as selectors recall Rinku, Ishan Kishan

Legendary India batter Sunil Gavaskar has expressed surprise at Shubman Gill’s omission from the Indian squad for the 2026 T20 World Cup, citing the right-hander’s recent lack of form as a likely factor.At a press conference held at BCCI headquarters on Saturday, Gill’s exclusion from both the T20 World Cup squad and the upcoming T20I series against New Zealand quickly became a major talking point. Since returning from the Asia Cup, the 26-year-old struggled to find consistency, with his highest score across 15 innings being just 47.“It is surprising,” Gavaskar told JioStar. “He is a classy, quality batter who had an excellent season following the 2024 T20 World Cup. Yes, he had a few quiet matches against South Africa. But class is permanent, and form is temporary. He was also returning after a long break and was a bit out of rhythm.”The former India captain added that the challenges of T20 cricket may have contributed to Gill’s struggles. “When you are not in rhythm in T20s, where you have to attack from the first ball, it becomes tough. His natural game suits Test cricket more, playing along the ground.The shots needed in T20s don’t come as easily. But we know he is a very good player. His IPL performances show that T20 is not new to him. Perhaps just the lack of form and touch worked against him this time. ”In Gill’s absence, Axar Patel was named India’s vice-captain, while the team management also reshuffled the top order to accommodate a wicketkeeper-batter at the top. This paved the way for Ishan Kishan ’s return to the T20I side, his first appearance since November 2023.Kishan had a stellar domestic season, captaining Jharkhand to victory in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy and finishing as the tournament’s top scorer with 517 runs in 10 innings. Gavaskar praised his form and consistency. “When you see someone performing, you pick him. Ishan has already represented India and shown he can deliver. His current performance proves that domestic cricket should matter for selection, not just the IPL. He has made a fantastic comeback after being out of the team for a couple of years and led his state team to a title.”The squad also saw other notable changes. Wicketkeeper Jitesh Sharma was left out, while left-handed batter Rinku Singh was included to strengthen the middle order. Gavaskar sympathised with Sharma. “I feel for Jitesh. He did nothing wrong. He was a very capable wicketkeeper, and after MS Dhoni, perhaps the best at assisting the captain with DRS calls from behind the stumps. It is tough for him, but he is young. He just needs to go back to domestic cricket and continue performing.”With Gill sidelined and Kishan back in the fold, India’s T20 plans are being restructured ahead of the World Cup. Gavaskar’s observations highlight both the challenges of form and fitness in international cricket and the value of domestic performances in shaping national selections.","Shubman Gill has been left out of the India squad for the 2026 T20 World Cup. The 26-year-old has struggled to find consistency since returning from the Asia Cup.

Ex-India spinner Ravichandran Ashwin has shared his excitement over India’s squad for the 2026 Men’s T20 World Cup, highlighting the team’s readiness to defend their title. The former India spinner also congratulated his “brother,” Sanju Samson , and praised Ishan Kishan for making a remarkable return to international cricket.In a move that surprised many fans, India’s defending champions have left out Shubman Gill from the squad for next year’s T20 World Cup, as well as the upcoming T20I series against New Zealand. Announced by BCCI Secretary Devajit Saikia, alongside captain Suryakumar Yadav , chief selector Ajit Agarkar, and vice-captain Axar Patel, the squad features several notable changes.Alongside Gill, wicketkeeper-batter Jitesh Sharma has also been excluded, making way for Ishan Kishan’s comeback. Kishan earned his spot after leading Jharkhand to their maiden Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy title, scoring heavily and displaying exceptional form throughout the tournament. Rinku Singh has also returned to the squad after missing India’s 3-1 T20I series win in South Africa.“Title defence loading. Superb squad. Great to see Rinku back and happy for my thambi Sanju, who will now rightfully open alongside Abhishek. Adipoli Chetta! Huge applause for Ishan, who showed his hunger by grinding hard in the domestic circuit,” Ashwin wrote on X, highlighting the blend of experience and fresh energy in the squad.The 2026 Men’s T20 World Cup will be held from February 7 to March 8, with 40 group-stage matches scheduled to conclude by February 20.The top two teams from each of the four groups will advance to the Super Eights, beginning on February 21.This edition of the tournament is co-hosted by India and Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka previously hosted the T20 World Cup in 2012, while India last held the event in 2016. Ahead of the World Cup, India will play five T20Is against New Zealand starting January 21 in Nagpur. The series will also feature matches in Raipur, Guwahati, Visakhapatnam, and Thiruvananthapuram.In the World Cup, India is placed in Group A alongside Pakistan, the USA, Netherlands, and Namibia. The team opens its campaign against the USA at Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai on February 7. The next match is against Namibia at Arun Jaitley Stadium, New Delhi, on February 12.India’s high-profile clash with Pakistan is scheduled for February 15 at the R. Premadasa Stadium in Colombo. The group-stage phase concludes with a match against the Netherlands at Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad on February 18.","Shubman Gill left out of India's squad for 2026 T20 World Cup.

Poll Do you agree with Dinesh Karthik's assessment of Shubman Gill and Jitesh Sharma's omissions from the T20 World Cup squad? Yes, it's shocking No, it's justified Unsure Need more information

naseeb mein tha. Mujhe achhe log milte gaye. Mere bhaagya mein tha

In his minute and 40-second Instagram Reel, former India cricketer Dinesh Karthik couldn’t hide his emotions while talking about India’s T20 World Cup squad. He labelled the omission of Shubman Gill and Jitesh Sharma as “shocking.”Karthik said: “I didn’t see that coming. It just tells you there’s a little bit of clarity lacking. I feel really bad for Shubman Gill and Jitesh Sharma.”Much will be made of Shubman Gill being dropped but it is equally bewildering to see Jitesh Sharma not being named in the 15-member squad. The wicketkeeper-batter has been a perfect team man. With Sanju Samson being the first-choice keeper, he warmed the bench without making any fuss during the Bangladesh series last year. In the next series, he was shown the door.The Baroda batter let his bat do the talking in the Indian Premier League . Jitesh scored only 261 runs in Royal Challengers Bengaluru’s (RCB) title-winning season, but it wasn’t the runs that caught the selectors’ eyes — it was his strike rate of 176.35 while batting at Nos. 6 and 7.Those performances helped him get back into the India team for the Asia Cup. T20I captain Suryakumar Yadav , who Jitesh considers as his cricketing idol, backed him during the continental tournament.“Post last T20 World Cup, we spoke a lot on how to go about it. We spoke about not thinking of milestones ahead and following the journey. He’s been a completely different cricketer post that. The way he performed in the IPL and domestic tournaments he played, he’s done really well and earned his spot again,” Suryakumar had said on Jitesh’s comeback.Before the start of the Asia Cup, TimesofIndia.com learnt that with Shubman Gill back as an opener, it would be Jitesh Sharma who would play in the middle order. But in Dubai, the team management backed Sanju to bat at No. 5 in a revolving batting order.The Sanju experiment in the middle order fell flat. On the other hand, Jitesh kept working hard in the nets, waiting for his chance, but ended up warming the bench throughout the Asia Cup.It was in Australia where Jitesh finally got the chance to play. In the three T20Is, he batted twice — scoring an unbeaten 22 off 13 balls in the third T20I in India’s five-wicket win while batting at No. 7 and playing his role to perfection.In the recently concluded five-match series against South Africa, he went out to bat thrice — scoring a five-ball 10 in Cuttack, a quickfire 27 off 17 balls in New Chandigarh, and not getting to face a ball in Ahmedabad. The 32-year-old was excellent with the gloves as well.Jitesh didn’t do anything wrong. He was a perfect team man and probably an easy scapegoat for the management, which is why he was dropped from India’s T20 World Cup squad.TimesofIndia.com has also learnt the wicketkeeper-batter was in the team management's Playing XI plans for the World Cup but now finds himself out of the squad. He was preparing for match situations where he would get only 5-7 balls to face but the designated finisher has been conveniently dropped for a top-order option in Ishan Kishan.A lot happened in the last few hours as not many saw these changes coming. It doesn't matter whether it was due to a combination call or something else, the fact is Jitesh has been left in the lurch by his cricketing idol — Suryakumar Yadav.In his career, Jitesh has seen one too many swings of misfortune. But this brutal omission, without any explanation, says a lot about the “lack of clarity” in the Indian dressing room.Shubman Gill is 26, and with age on his side, he may get another go at a World Cup — not to forget he plays the other two formats as well. But for players like Jitesh, 32, who plays just one format and are absolute team men, this was a moment to cherish. Instead, it has been destroyed, and it will take him time to come out of this heartbreak.Earlier this year, in an exclusive interview with TimesofIndia.com, Jitesh had spoken about his belief in fate. “(It was in my destiny. I kept meeting good people. It was in my fate),” he had said about his cricketing career.It seems Jitesh will now have to accept his fate and, hopefully, bounce back from this setback.",Shubman Gill and Jitesh Sharma have been left out of India's T20 World Cup squad.

'Brutal realisation, hardcore transformation'

'Abhishek Sharma's praise'

Legendary coach Chandrakant Pandit is a stickler for discipline and ensuring that cricket is played strictly according to rules. However, Pandit decided to make a rare exception, granting a second breath of life to a highly rated 17-year-old batter. The 64-year-old coach adjudged the batter not out despite the ball striking his pads, gifting concession in a practice match where he was umpiring. The 17-year-old cricketer went on to score 165, which impressed Pandit and paved the way for entry into the Madhya Pradesh (MP) setup.IPL 2026's player auction recently witnessed heavy demand for Akshat Raghuwanshi, the player being referred to, drawing a bidding war between Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) and SunRisers Hyderabad (SRH). LSG eventually signed the 22-year-old batter for rupees 2.2 crore, acquiring a cricketer who has drawn comparisons to Australia's Cameron Green for his big-hitting. Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) all-rounder Venkatesh Iyer had earlier stated that he hasn't seen a more talented player than Raghuwanshi at 21.The right-handed batter smashed 239 runs in four matches at a strike rate of 177.04 in the last edition of the Madhya Pradesh Premier League, plundering 16 sixes. Raghuwanshi, who idolises Rohit Sharma , especially caught the eye with his no-look upper cut, which has emerged as a signature shot. The MP batter had gone unsold in the previous edition of IPL despite quality performances, leading to nervousness. However, there was quiet confidence at the same time, having drawn trial invitations from nine franchises.""We were very sad after Akshat went unsold in the last IPL auction, as the whole family had sat down together to watch him get a historic opportunity. This time, we were following proceedings quietly in our respective homes due to fear of another setback. However, everyone started bursting crackers and distributing sweets after Akshat got picked,"" said Raghuwanshi's father Krishna Pal, during an exclusive interaction with. LSG pacer Avesh Khan kept Akshat abreast about the teams bidding for him after the latter's TV broke down midway during the auction.""We hail from Ashoknagar, a remote city in Madhya Pradesh, which resulted in fewer opportunities for Akshat. Otherwise, my son was well capable of being picked in the IPL two years back,"" added Krishna Pal.Raghuwanshi started playing cricket when he was 3 years old, showcasing unprecedented strength and excellent footwork, drawing encouragement from his father. The MP batter could perfectly play a cover drive, flick shot or cut shot despite not having the ability to speak, urging Krishna Pal to quit his business and shift to Indore for enhanced training in the coming years. Noting his talent, Union Communications Minister Jyotiraditya Scindia approached the Madhya Pradesh Cricket Association (MPCA), urging them to include Raghuwanshi in the residential training programme. The request was turned down due to concerns over the MP batter's age as he was just 11.However, Raghuwanshi impressed ex-India cricketer Amay Khurasiya with his fearlessness during the selection trials next year, stepping forward to defend a short-pitched delivery bowled at 125 km/h. The MP batter was hardly 4 ft tall but showcased confidence against an under-19 pacer, leaving Khurasiya stunned. ""He said, 'Akshat is the son of a lion and not scared of anyone. Witnessing his character, Amay sir decided to include him in the residential academy,"" shared Krishna Pal.Training sessions under Khurasiya were well structured with utmost focus on discipline. Even a second's delay in arrival for practice was considered unpardonable and while shots were encouraged, rashness in execution was a strict no-no. Raghuwanshi ran his fair share of rounds and was even scolded by Khurasiya for his shot selection but considers it a phase which strengthened character and developed his game even further.""There was a medical test scheduled when I was 12 years old. We were instructed not to have breakfast and to skip practice. However, the training session still took place where Khurasiya sir noted my absence and called me. When I narrated the instructions, sir said, 'Does he want to play for India or do you?'. I ran 12 rounds after that,"" stated Raghuwanshi.Training under such a structured routine where complete commitment is a necessity also developed a strong sense of accountability within the MP batter. Raghuwanshi can be exceedingly tough on himself as evident from an instance where Khurasiya asked the 22-year-old cricketer to train from 10 AM to 12 PM. Krishna Pal arrived at 11.45 AM, urging his son to leave along with the other players. Khurasiya soon noted Raghuwanshi's absence, instructing the MP batter's father not to give him lunch as a form of punishment.""Akshat was very tired but didn't eat lunch and dinner that day out of guilt over making such an error in judgment. He never repeated such a mistake again,"" said Krishna Pal.Raghuwanshi soon started impressing for MP, scoring a century on first-class debut, followed by a half-century in the second match. However, despite all the runs in domestic cricket, a shot at the IPL continued to elude him, resulting in a brutal realisation two years back which emerged as a major eye-opener. Raghuwanshi used to focus on orthodox cricket earlier with grounded shots but soon realised that such gameplay and a strike rate of 150 wouldn't earn him a spot in the T20 league.""Akshat used to tell me again and again, 'Players are scoring 80 off 40 balls and getting picked. Why will anyone take me?'. I would scold him, saying that playing too fast will ruin his game. However, Akshat was convinced that a strike rate of 150 will only lead to state-level opportunities, shifting focus towards maintaining a strike rate of 200 in every knock,"" shared Krishna Pal.Raghuwanshi quickly figured out a training programme involving a fine mix of strength, innovation and focus on ensuring 300 sixes daily in training sessions stretching up to six hours. The 22-year-old batter also enjoys strong conviction in his gameplay, sticking to his aggressive mindset despite being discouraged by coaches. Raghuwanshi was dropped as punishment on certain occasions but stuck to the same approach due to his ultimate dream of featuring in the IPL. The MP batter was especially scolded a lot for playing the sweep shot which has been a strong weapon in his armour, staying resolute due to the dominance it provides against spinners.Interestingly, Raghuwanshi drew praise from Abhishek Sharma during a tournament in Baroda last year. Sharma encouraged the MP batter to maintain strong belief, emphasising that the 22-year-old cricketer is built for cricket's highest levels.""Akshat can spot the length very accurately and enjoys strong balance at the crease. He can cut and pull astutely as well as make a difference as an opener, middle-order batter and finisher. His mental strength and character will hold him in good stead,"" stated Khurasiya.","Akshat Raghuwanshi has drawn comparisons to Australia's Cameron Green for his big-hitting. The right-handed batter smashed 239 runs in four matches at a strike rate of 177.04 in the last edition of the Madhya Pradesh Premier League, plundering 16 sixes.

The long way back: From contract snub to World Cup squad - Ishan Kishan's story of comeback,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/icc-mens-t20-world-cup/the-long-way-back-from-contract-snub-to-world-cup-squad-ishan-kishans-story-of-comeback/articleshow/126093447.cms,"India's Ishan Kishan (PTI Photo/R Senthil Kumar)

India World Cup squad: No Shubman Gill, Jitesh as selectors recall Rinku, Ishan Kishan

When India announced their squad for the 2026 T20 World Cup, Kishan’s name was back where it once felt natural. In a list that came with big talking points—Shubman Gill being dropped, Axar Patel named vice-captain, Rinku Singh returning—Kishan’s inclusion stood out for a different reason. It felt earned the hard way.At one point, when it seemed Kishan may have played his last game for India and would not return for a while, this comeback is both surprising and inspiring.Two years ago, he was part of India’s regular white-ball plans. An aggressive opener who could also bat in the middle order. A left-hander who could change games in a few overs. Kishan was also drafted in India’s white-ball setup as a like-for-like replacement for Rishabh Pant and seen as India’s second-choice wicketkeeper. He even made his Test debut against the West Indies in July 2023.Then things began to slip. He stepped away from a South Africa tour in late 2023, citing personal reasons and mental fatigue. The timing was poor, and the explanation did not land well. Questions followed.Then came the bigger blow.Kishan made himself unavailable for domestic cricket during that period. The BCCI took note. When the central contracts were announced in 2024, his name was missing.The board ended its release with an unusually direct reminder that players must give precedence to domestic cricket when not on national duty. The message was clear, and it was not meant for just one player.Around the same time, BCCI secretary Jay Shah had written to centrally contracted players, warning them against prioritising the IPL over domestic and national commitments. The letter spoke of severe implications. Kishan became one of the first visible examples of that line being enforced, along with Shreyas Iyer. Shah told the Times of India, ""If you look at the Duleep Trophy squad, apart from Rohit and Virat, the rest are going to play. It's because of the harsh steps I have taken. Shreyas Iyer and Ishan Kishan are playing Duleep Trophy.""India’s head coach at the time, Rahul Dravid, later said Kishan had not made himself available for selection and would need to play domestic cricket to be considered again. Even captain Rohit Sharma spoke publicly about the need for hunger, especially in the longer formats. In Kishan’s absence, Dhruv Jurel debuted in Tests, made an immediate impact, and became India’s second-choice wicketkeeper and a backup to Rishabh Pant.During this period, Kishan did not react publicly. No interviews. No emotional statements. He went back home to Jharkhand and did the one thing selectors always ask for but do not always reward—he played domestic cricket seriously.In IPL 2025, Sunrisers Hyderabad picked Kishan. He started the season with a storm, scoring a century in his very first game against Rajasthan Royals, helping SRH post a mammoth total of 286 for 6. Everyone thought this IPL would be Kishan’s redemption arc. But what followed was not a smooth story. Despite the opening century, Kishan ended the season with 354 runs. His 94 not out against RCB at the very end stood out, but runs did not flow consistently in the rest of the games.What followed was the best phase of his career.Leading Jharkhand in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy, Kishan played with clarity and purpose. He did not look like someone chasing a comeback. He looked like someone enjoying responsibility. Jharkhand went on to win their maiden SMAT title. Kishan finished as the tournament’s highest run-getter with 517 runs in 10 innings. Two hundreds. Two fifties. A strike rate brushing 200. And then the biggest one of all—a century in the final against Haryana.Two days later, India announced their World Cup squad.Timing matters in cricket. Kishan finally got it right.Speaking after the announcement, his words were simple. He spoke about happiness. About Jharkhand. About the team effort. Nothing about redemption. Nothing about proving a point. That told its own story.This selection was not driven by emotion. It was about balance and combination.With India deciding to go back to opening with a wicketkeeper-batter, the selectors wanted flexibility. Sanju Samson is the first-choice wicketkeeper. They needed a second option who could also open. That edged Jitesh Sharma out of the picture. Kishan fitted the role better.Ajit Agarkar was clear at the press conference. Shubman Gill missed out because of lack of runs and team balance. Gill remains India’s ODI and Test captain. This was not a long-term judgement. It was a short-format call.India squad for T20 World Cup: Suryakumar Yadav (captain), Abhishek Sharma, Tilak Varma, Hardik Pandya, Shivam Dube, Axar Patel (vc), Kuldeep Yadav, Jasprit Bumrah, Arshdeep Singh, Harshit Rana, Sanju Samson (wk), Washington Sundar, Varun Chakravarthy, Ishan Kishan (wk), Rinku Singh.","Ishan Kishan was part of India’s regular white-ball plans two years ago.

Ajit Agarkar and Suryakumar Yadav press conference: On dropping Shubman Gill and other tough calls

India's squad for New Zealand T20Is and 2026 T20 World Cup:

NEW DELHI: Hours before the T20 World Cup squad announcement in Mumbai on Saturday, India vice-captain Shubman Gill was with the squad in Ahmedabad. His participation in the fixture, as previously reported by TimesofIndia.com, was touch and go due to a toe injury. The management didn't want to risk pushing him for the fifth T20I vs South Africa. They also explored the option of an injection for the ""minor niggle"" but the decision-makers, keeping the New Zealand T20Is and T20 World Cup in mind, decided against it.Gill sat out but few would have read the undertones of the ""cautious decision.""""Shubman Gill could have played as the niggle was minor and there was no fracture etc. but it was a cautious decision to not rush him for the match,"" said a team source.A couple of days back, when the team reached Lucknow for the fourth T20I, there was a temptation within the think-tank to try out Sanju Samson. A toe injury in the nets gave them that opportunity. The fixture was abandoned due to fog but in Ahmedabad, there was another chance to try the wicketkeeper-batter at top of the order. A breezy 22-ball 37 and 63-run stand with Abhishek Sharma was enough to not only force Gill out of the Playing XI, but also the squad.When Gill returned to the T20I setup during the Asia Cup in September, he opened with Abhishek and it forced Samson to bat lower down the order.In the four innings he played, the right-handed Samson batted just once at No. 3 and was largely given the middle-order slot. A role he hasn't held in the past and clearly didn't look comfortable. It's understood that the wicketkeeper-batter had a word with the management in this regard and asked for a top-order role.That was the primary reason he was tried at No.3 in the T20I vs Australia at MCG and went on to open in every match he played for Kerala in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy. Two half-centuries and a couple of 40s later, he sent another reminder to the selectors.Gill, however, didn't get the kind of backing captain Suryakumar Yadav has enjoyed even after a long poor patch with the bat, and he was omitted from the squad sheet. A move that not many saw coming and took everyone by surprise.It's further learnt that there wasn't any dialogue with the India ODI and Test captain in Ahmedabad and he was informed about the non-selection moments before the meeting on Saturday.""Shubman Gill was spoken to before the meeting. Obviously, we can't give the details but he explained the combination call. Unfortunate for him but at the end of the day you need the best combination for the World Cup,"" said a BCCI official.Ajit Agarkar explained the Gill call and why the selectors explored different options at top of the order.""It's more to do with the combination that we want to play, or what the team management is comfortable with playing,"" Agarkar said.""Their thoughts are... who's going to bat at the top? Abhishek, obviously, has done what he has done over the last year. And we felt the keeper at the top at this point gives us a lot more solidity than anywhere else in the team to play different combinations. There are only 15 that we could have picked. Someone has to miss out. It's him. It's not because he's not a good player. Again, Jitesh hasn't done too much wrong. These are the combinations that the team management is looking for,"" he added.Captain Suryakumar Yadav, too, spoke on similar lines and why there was a need to have a wicketkeeper-batter at top of the order. Surya played down the form and lack of runs chatter around Gill and said it was purely a combination call.""It's not about his form or anything. It's just about the combination right now. We wanted to have a keeper at the top. We wanted to have someone like Rinku Singh or maybe a Washington Sundar later on, to have a different combination. So that's why we brought in that extra wicketkeeper at the top.""And he's a terrific player. And there's no question about that. The only thing is that the situation is such that we need a keeper at the top of the order to have two-three good combinations which can win us the World Cup,"" said Surya.The moment Gill was out of the squad and Samson returned to top of the order, it was going to be difficult to accommodate Jitesh Sharma and the need for another top-order wicketkeeper option forced the selectors to look towards an in-form Ishan Kishan - a player who was nowhere close to India call a week back but a terrific Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy campaign and the late combination calls opened the door for the left-hander.The way this entire Gill non-selection has played out, it is comfortable for everyone. Captain Suryakumar doesn't have a high-profile vice-captain breathing down his neck. Chief selector Agarkar has rewarded a domestic performer. And, coach Gambhir will not be accused of favouring Gill.Suryakumar Yadav (capt), Abhishek Sharma, Sanju Samson (wk), Tilak Varma, Hardik Pandya, Shivam Dube, Axar Patel (vice-capt), Rinku Singh, Jasprit Bumrah, Harshit Rana, Arshdeep Singh, Kuldeep Yadav, Varun Chakaravarthy, Washington Sundar, Ishan Kishan (wk)","India vice-captain Shubman Gill was with the squad in Ahmedabad.

NEW DELHI: The Indian selectors on Saturday made a clear statement of intent ahead of the T20 World Cup, dropping Shubman Gill from the squad and recalling wicketkeeper-batter Ishan Kishan along with Rinku Singh. The move underlined the team management’s preference for impact-driven roles over reputation, especially at the top of the order in the shortest format. Gill’s exclusion was the key call taken at the selection meeting in Mumbai. Given his recent returns, the decision did not come as a surprise.While Gill has been consistent in Tests and ODIs, he has struggled to secure a defined role in T20Is, especially as an opener, where the team management is looking for quick starts instead of run accumulation. His powerplay strike rate and the rise of more aggressive options appear to have worked against him. Against South Africa, he scored 4, 0 and 28 in three matches.""Shubman Gill is short of runs at the moment and missed the last WC too,"" chairman of selectors Ajit Agarkar said at the press conference.""It’s not about Gill’s form.

Lionel Messi India tour: Inside story of what went wrong in Kolkata

NEW DELHI: Satadru Dutta, the main organiser of Lionel Messi’s event held on December 13 and now under arrest, has told investigators that the footballer was unhappy with physical contact during his appearance at the Salt Lake Stadium and left the venue before completing the scheduled programme, news agency PTI reported on Saturday, quoting a source in the Special Investigation Team (SIT).During questioning, Dutta told SIT officers that Messi ""did not like being touched on the back or being hugged"" and that this concern had been communicated in advance by foreign security officials assigned to protect the footballer, the source said.""Despite repeated public announcements to restrain the crowd, there was no impact. The manner in which Messi was surrounded and embraced was completely unacceptable to the World Cup-winning footballer,"" Dutta told investigators during his grilling on Friday, the source added, as cited by the PTI.West Bengal sports minister Aroop Biswas was seen close to Messi during the programme, with visuals showing him holding the footballer around the waist while posing for photographs. Biswas has been accused of using his influence to allow relatives and personal acquaintances access to Messi. Amid criticism, he resigned from his post as sports minister pending completion of the investigation.Investigators are examining how a large number of people were allowed to access the ground area.Dutta claimed that initially only 150 ground passes were issued, but the number was tripled after a ""very influential person"" arrived at the stadium and ""overpowered him"". Police are checking whether the increase in access led to the crowd control failure.""The arrested accused also claimed that once that particular influential person reached the stadium, all the flow-chart for the Messi programme got disturbed and he could not control it,"" the official told PTI.Dutta also shared financial details related to Messi’s India visit. ""Lionel Messi was paid Rs 89 crore for the tour, while Rs 11 crore was paid as tax to the Indian government,"" he told investigators, putting the total cost at Rs 100 crore. Sources said 30 per cent of the amount came from sponsors and another 30 per cent from ticket sales.SIT officers also found more than Rs 20 crore in Dutta’s frozen bank accounts. On Friday, they seized several documents during raids at his residence.""Dutta claimed that the amount in his bank account was the money which he got from selling the tickets for the Messi event in Kolkata and Hyderabad and also from the sponsors. We are verifying his claims,"" the officer said.What was supposed to be a marquee football spectacle turned into widespread violence and disorder at the stadium last week after Messi’s brief and tightly ring-fenced appearance, his first at the venue since 2011, left large sections of the crowd frustrated.They failed to catch a glimpse of their superstar despite having travelled from far and wide, paying hefty sums for tickets.The West Bengal government has formed an SIT comprising senior IPS officers Piyush Pandey, Javed Shamim, Supratim Sarkar and Muralidhar to investigate the vandalism, security lapses, access violations and the role of organisers and officials in the incident, the officer added.","Satadru Dutta, the main organiser of Lionel Messi’s event held on December 13 and now under arrest, has told investigators that the footballer was unhappy with physical contact.

A trophy with a meaning

The hollow in a million hearts

A new trophy, a new start

A forgotten memory

NEW DELHI: Looking back today, it feels almost unreal that the original FIFA World Cup trophy no longer exists.In an era where constant digital tracking and tight security were absent, football lost one of its most treasured symbols quietly and permanently. The Jules Rimet Trophy, which crowned the world champions of football for four decades, was stolen in 1983 and never recovered.The Jules Rimet Trophy was the first official World Cup prize. It was awarded to the winners of the FIFA World Cup from 1930 to 1970. Named after Jules Rimet, the former FIFA president who played a key role in starting the World Cup, the trophy carried enormous historical value.It was made of solid gold and featured a sculpted figure holding a cup, making it instantly recognisable to fans across the world.For Brazil, the trophy had special meaning.The country first won the World Cup in 1958 and defended the title in 1962. Brazil won the tournament in 1970 for the third time, completing a remarkable journey.At the time, it was under FIFA rules that any country that won the World Cup three times was allowed to keep the Jules Rimet Trophy permanently.Led by football legend Pelé, Brazil’s victory in 1970 gave the nation permanent ownership of the trophy.After the celebrations ended, the Jules Rimet Trophy was placed at the headquarters of the Brazilian Football Confederation in Rio de Janeiro.It was displayed in a glass case and treated as a symbol of Brazil’s football greatness. Security arrangements were modest, reflecting a time when the idea of stealing such an object seemed unlikely.That sense of safety did not last.In December 1983, the Jules Rimet Trophy was stolen. It all happened under the night skies when thieves broke into the CBF building. They damaged the display case and took the trophy.When officials arrived later, they found that the most famous prize in football history was gone.News of the theft reached the ears of the general public soon across Brazil and beyond. In a country where football makes people fanatics, the loss was deeply felt.The trophy was not only the representation of their success on the pitch, but it also stood for generations of players and moments that shaped the sport.Brazilian police launched an investigation immediately. Over time, several suspects were arrested, including a jeweller. Investigators worked to trace the trophy and understand the motive behind the theft. Their findings pointed to a simple but devastating conclusion. The Jules Rimet Trophy was made of solid gold, and gold could be melted.According to the investigation, the trophy was melted down and sold as gold. This conclusion was based on police evidence and statements from those involved.Once melted, the trophy lost its identity completely. No markings, shapes or features remained. Not a single piece of the original Jules Rimet Trophy has ever been recovered.This was not the first time the trophy had been stolen. In 1966, ahead of the World Cup in England, the Jules Rimet Trophy disappeared from an exhibition in London.In an interesting end to the saga, the trophy was found wrapped in newspaper under a hedge by a dog named Pickles.It was soon returned safely, and the incident became part of football folklore.The 1983 theft in Brazil had no such ending.With no hope of recovery, Brazil later commissioned a replica of the Jules Rimet Trophy. The replica was placed on display to preserve the memory of Brazil’s achievement.However, it could not replace the historical value of the original trophy that had been lifted by champions from 1930 onwards.The disappearance of the Jules Rimet Trophy also influenced how football treated its prizes.After Brazil’s third World Cup win, FIFA introduced a new trophy, first awarded in 1974. The current FIFA World Cup Trophy is not permanently awarded to any nation. Winners lift the original trophy during celebrations but are later given a replica to keep. The original remains under FIFA’s control.The loss of the Jules Rimet Trophy forced FIFA to look at this rule with a strict eye.For Brazil, the theft was especially painful.The 1970 team is widely considered one of the greatest sides in football history. Players like Pelé, Jairzinho, Rivelino and others created moments that will forever be in the memories of the fans.The trophy they earned through skill and success on the field was lost through negligence and crime.The story continues to be remembered even after decades.Authorities believe they know what happened to the trophy. Yet, the sense of loss remains because the outcome cannot be reversed.Football history was erased in physical form.Today, fans can only see photographs and replicas of the Jules Rimet Trophy. Museums display its likeness, and books recount its journey. But the original, which once travelled across continents and crowned the first world champions, no longer exists.The stolen World Cup trophy stands as a reminder of a different era. It shows how even the most valuable symbols can be lost if they are not protected. It also highlights how fragile history can be.Football has moved forward since then. New trophies have been lifted, new legends have emerged, and new memories have been created. Yet the story of the Jules Rimet Trophy remains one of the sport’s most sobering chapters.It is a throwback to a time when the World Cup could disappear. And never return.","The Jules Rimet Trophy was the first official World Cup prize. It was awarded to the winners of the FIFA World Cup from 1930 to 1970. For Brazil, the trophy had special meaning.

Engage with the Ministry as outlined above; and Constitute a joint working group comprising representatives of AIFF, Ministry and the Clubs to address legal, regulatory, and transitional matters, including timelines and approvals from AFC, FIFA, and the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India.""Representatives of all ISL clubs have been invited to attend the upcoming AIFF Annual General Meeting on Saturday, where the matter is expected to be discussed.","Indian Super League (ISL) clubs formally propose a fundamental restructuring of the country's top-tier professional football league.

At least 59 people, including seven police officers, were injured after violent clashes erupted between rival football supporters following Colombia’s Copa Colombia final in Medellin on Wednesday night, authorities said, in scenes that overshadowed Atletico Nacional’s title triumph.The unrest broke out moments after the final whistle at the Atanasio Girardot Stadium, where Atletico Nacional edged past city rivals Deportivo Independiente Medellin 1-0 to lift the trophy. What should have been a night of celebration quickly descended into chaos as fans from both sides stormed the pitch, hurled projectiles and clashed with security forces.Videos of the violence circulated widely on social media, showing dozens of supporters invading the field and confrontations breaking out in different sections of the stadium. Riot police were forced to intervene to restore order as the situation spiralled out of control in front of a crowd of around 43,000 spectators.Medellin’s security secretary Manuel Villa confirmed that 52 fans were treated for injuries sustained during the clashes, while police said seven officers were also hurt. No arrests were reported, but Villa said authorities were reviewing CCTV footage from inside and around the stadium to identify those responsible.The violence had immediate consequences for the event, with officials cancelling the post-match trophy presentation and medal ceremony for Atletico Nacional players due to safety concerns.In Colombia, visiting fans are typically barred from attending high-risk fixtures to prevent crowd trouble. However, Medellin city hall had allowed Atletico Nacional supporters — officially designated as the visiting side — to attend the final as part of an initiative to promote peaceful coexistence in football.Medellin mayor Federico Gutierrez strongly condemned the incidents, describing those involved as “criminals” and “misfits” who do not represent the sport.","At least 59 people, including seven police officers, were injured after violent clashes erupted following Colombia’s Copa Colombia final.

PARIS: Paris Saint-Germain goalkeeper Matvey Safonov has been left with a fractured hand following his penalty shootout heroics to win the Intercontinental Cup.Safonov made four straight penalty saves as PSG beat Brazil's Flamengo 2-1 in the shootout on Wednesday to secure the club's first global title.

The player doesn’t know how it happened,” coach Luis Enrique said in translated comments Friday.He added that the most plausible explanation seemed to be that Safonov was hurt during the shootout and kept playing with the fracture.In a video posted on social media app Telegram, Safonov didn't address what happened directly, but said: “You know, no matter what happens, I can't be broken.”Safonov, PSG’s Russian backup goalkeeper, hadn’t played a single minute for the team until summer signing Lucas Chevalier sustained an ankle injury which has ruled him out since his last game Nov. 29.Chevalier was on the bench against Flamengo.

NEW DELHI: The Indian Super League (ISL) clubs were on Thursday asked to submit a proposal for forming a consortium to run the 2025-26 season of the league, which is yet to begin.Representatives of all ISL clubs were invited to attend the Annual General Meeting of the All India Football Federation on Saturday, on the sidelines of which the matter was discussed.“Regarding the consortium thing, the clubs have been told to submit to the ministry their proposal so that it can be discussed during the Dec 20 AGM. But there is no guarantee,” a club representative told news agency PTI.The request followed a virtual meeting on Thursday between AIFF officials, ISL club representatives and the sports ministry. The clubs were asked to submit their proposal by Friday evening.The AIFF also informed the clubs that, under its new constitution, any amendment to its provisions could be done only after the General Body of the national federation was formed according to the new constitution itself.“It could be hotchpotch also since the new National Sports Grievance Act is likely to be implemented shortly. So there can be changes under the Act also,” a source in the know of things said.Meanwhile, the Indian Women’s League, starting December 20, will be held without a sponsor after the AIFF and Capri Sports – the lone bidder in the national federation’s tender to monetise the commercial rights of the first and second divisions of the IWL for five years – could not reach an agreement.The clubs had earlier suggested forming a consortium to resolve the ongoing commercial impasse in Indian football.The AIFF said this would require deliberations and approval by its Executive Committee and the AGM.The Marketing Rights Agreement between the AIFF and Football Sports Development Limited, which organised the ISL for 12 seasons since its inception in 2014, ended on December 8, leaving the top-tier league without a commercial framework.","Indian Super League (ISL) clubs were on Thursday asked to submit a proposal for forming a consortium to run the 2025-26 season of the league, which is yet to begin.

NEW DELHI: Today is December 18. For some, it is just another day on the way to Christmas and the New Year. For football fans, however, it is a date that will forever live in the sport’s collective memory as the night Lionel Messi completed the game.Under the bright lights of Lusail Stadium in Qatar three years back, Argentina defeated France in a final that felt less like a match and more like destiny unfolding in real time.For Messi, it was not just a World Cup title; it was the closing chapter of a lifelong pursuit that had defined his career, his country, and an entire generation of football fans.For nearly two decades, Messi’s greatness had been measured against an absence.He had won everything at club level, from Champions League to multiple Ballon d’Ors, league titles and goal-scoring records that once seemed untouchable.And yet, the World Cup remained the one prize that eluded him, the yardstick by which football immortality is often judged.In Argentina, where Diego Maradona ’s shadow still loomed large, that absence was felt more sharply than anywhere else.Qatar 2022 began with doubt rather than certainty. Argentina’s shocking opening defeat to Saudi Arabia threatened to derail the campaign before it truly began.For a brief moment, old fears resurfaced: was this another World Cup destined to end in heartbreak for Messi?But what followed was a team and a captain refusing to surrender to narrative or pressure.Messi led with calm authority. He scored, he created, he inspired, and, perhaps most importantly, he believed.From the group stages to the knockout rounds, Argentina grew stronger with each game, feeding off Messi’s composure and clarity. Against Australia, the Netherlands, and Croatia, he was not just a playmaker but the emotional compass of the side, guiding younger teammates through moments of chaos and tension.Then came the final: Argentina versus France, Messi versus Kylian Mbappé, experience versus explosive youth. It was billed as a passing-of-the-torch moment, but Messi was not ready to hand anything over.He scored from the penalty spot to give Argentina the lead and later added a second, arriving in the box with perfect timing to finish off a flowing move. At 2–0, it seemed as though the dream was finally within reach.Football, however, rarely allows fairy tales to unfold without resistance. In a breathtaking twist, Mbappé struck twice in the space of minutes to drag France back into the contest.Extra time followed, and Messi once again stepped up, poking the ball home to make it 3–2. Still, France refused to yield. Mbappé completed his hat-trick from the penalty spot, forcing a shootout that felt almost unbearable in its tension.As penalties loomed, the weight of history hung heavy. Argentina had been here before. It was close, but not close enough. This time, though, the script was different.Emiliano Martínez produced heroics in goal, Argentine penalties were struck with conviction, and when Gonzalo Montiel converted the decisive kick, Messi dropped to his knees, overcome with emotion.Tears flowed freely.Teammates swarmed him. In that moment, the burden he had carried for so long seemed to lift. The image of Messi, draped in the black bisht as he raised the World Cup trophy, became instantly iconic.For Argentina, the victory healed old wounds. It united generations that had debated Messi’s place in the pantheon and finally allowed him to be celebrated without caveats.For Messi himself, it was redemption, validation, and closure all at once.He had not just won a World Cup; he had done so as the undisputed leader of the team, delivering when it mattered most.Two years on, the significance of that night has only grown.December 18 is no longer just a date on the football calendar. It is the day Lionel Messi stepped beyond comparison, beyond debate, and into footballing eternity; World Cup in hand, legacy complete.","Lionel Messi won the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022 trophy on December 18, 2013. Argentina defeated France in a final that felt less like a match and more like destiny unfolding in real time. For Messi, it was not just a World Cup title; it was the closing chapter of a lifelong pursuit.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126060079,imgsize-238744,width-400,resizemode-4/argentina-v-france-final-fifa-world-cup-qatar-2022.jpg"

Congress member Jose K Mani raised India's football future in the Rajya Sabha on Thursday, comparing India's struggles with tiny Curacao's World Cup qualification while questioning Sports Minister Mansukh Mandaviya about plans to develop the sport in India, which is currently facing significant challenges including the suspension of domestic leagues.Mani, representing Kerala, highlighted how Curacao, with just 158,000 people and an area under 450km, qualified for next year's FIFA World Cup through CONCACAF, while India, despite its billion-plus population, continues to struggle.""Qualifying for FIFA world cup is based on the criteria laid down by FIFA, international governing body for football sport discipline,"" Mandaviya responded to Mani's queries.""Responsibility for development of a specific sports including taking steps for participation in World Cup/World Championships is that of concerned National Sports Federation (NSF).

Tom Brady Instagram post sparks conversation after Gisele Bündchen’s remarriage



Tom Brady broke his silence without issuing a single formal statement. Instead, he did what he has always done best. He let timing, tone, and confidence speak for him. On Saturday, the retired NFL icon appeared on Instagram for the first time since news surfaced that his former wife, Gisele Bündchen, had quietly remarried. The post arrived without commentary or explanation, yet it instantly caught attention and invited interpretation across the sports and celebrity worlds.At 48, Brady understands the weight of symbolism. Every word, image, and song choice matters when millions are watching. His Stories did not address the wedding directly, but they landed within days of confirmation that Bündchen had tied the knot with jiu-jitsu instructor Joaquim Valente in a private Surfside, Florida ceremony. In the absence of a public reaction, the posts filled the silence with meaning.Brady shared two images with his 15.3 million followers. In the first, he wore a white hoodie printed with the words “Forever Young.” Over the image, he added, “Yup,” followed by a red “100” emoji. The second showed him outdoors in a black T-shirt and shorts, football in hand, paired with the caption “LFG.” Both Stories were set to Logic’s 2017 track “1-800-273-8255,” a song widely known for its focus on suicide prevention and emotional struggle.The lyrics include lines such as “I feel like my life ain’t mine” and “I don’t wanna be alive,” giving the post a heavier undertone than its visuals suggested.The song title references the former National Suicide Prevention Lifeline number, now updated to 988. That choice alone prompted debate, with fans reading it as introspective rather than celebratory. Brady did not clarify his intent, but the contrast between the confident imagery and the somber soundtrack felt deliberate.Meanwhile, Bündchen has entered a new chapter. She and Valente welcomed a son earlier this year, with sources later revealing his middle name is River. Friends have shared that the baby’s first name holds deep family meaning for the supermodel. A source told Page Six that Valente “is thrilled they finally tied the knot after having a kid together.” Bündchen also continues to raise son Benjamin, 16, and daughter Vivian, 13, with Brady, while Brady remains father to Jack, 18, from his previous relationship with Bridget Moynahan.Brady’s post-divorce life has unfolded in public view, shaped by fatherhood, reflection, and quiet reinvention. His recent Instagram return fits that pattern. No explanations. No denial. Just a carefully chosen moment that signals he is still moving forward, on his own terms, even as the past reshapes itself around him.Also Read: Tom Brady's ex Gisele Bündchen marries Joaquim Valente in hush-hush ceremony","Tom Brady appeared on Instagram for the first time since Gisele Bündchen's remarriage.

Saquon Barkley’s kids: Everything to know about Jada and Saquon Jr.

Philadelphia Eagles star running back Saquon Barkley has never separated who he is on the field from who he is at home. The same discipline that fuels his game now shapes his parenting. Long before Super Bowl lights and championship stages, Barkley made a quiet promise to himself. He would lead by example, even when no one was watching. That mindset now defines how he raises his children, not with speeches, but with actions they can see and touch.When Barkley left Penn State early for the 2018 NFL Draft, he carried unfinished business beyond football. Education mattered to him, not as a backup plan, but as a lesson. He wanted his children to understand that goals do not expire when life accelerates. Years later, that lesson came full circle in a way far bigger than a stat line.Saquon Barkley made good on his word in 2022 when he returned to Penn State and completed his degree. The moment carried deep meaning, especially as a father. “I’m going to walk across that stage, hold my degree up high, and then go home and hang it on my wall to show my daughter that I accomplished something great,” Barkley wrote in an essay for The Players’ Tribune.That same intention shows up in how Barkley speaks about Jada and Saquon Jr., the two children he shares with his college sweetheart, Anna Congdon. “I’m happy I was able to accomplish something that was a goal of mine,” Barkley said. “I want my kids to be goal setters.”Jada, now seven, has grown into a familiar presence around her father’s career. From walking red carpets to standing on championship fields, she carries herself with confidence rooted in connection. Their pregame handshake has become a ritual, capped by a kiss and shared peace signs. Barkley once explained his responsibility clearly. “I always gotta try to set the standard for her because her image of a man is going to be off of me,” he said in a 2019 NFL film.Saquon Jr., known as S.J., brings a different energy. Born in September 2022, he is described by his father with warmth and honesty. “He lights up the room. Amazing smile. Jada is being an amazing big sister. Anna, obviously, an amazing mom. We’ve got a beautiful little family.” Barkley has also admitted his parenting instincts are still evolving. “If Jada falls, I’m like, ‘aww, aww, aww’ ... If Saquon Jr. falls, I’m looking like, ‘get up,’” Barkley said. “I got to do better in that area.”For Barkley, fatherhood is not a side story to his career. It is the reason behind every sacrifice. “I go out there and sacrifice my body every single day for my daughter,” he once shared. Championships fade. Lessons last.Also Read: Who is Josh Johnson, the Commanders’ emergency QB whose NFL resume includes stops with nearly half the league","Philadelphia Eagles star running back Saquon Barkley has two children with his college sweetheart.

Josh Johnson was not supposed to be the headline name for Washington in Week 16, yet circumstances forced him into the spotlight. With Jayden Daniels ruled out for the season and Marcus Mariota leaving the Eagles game injured, the Commanders suddenly leaned on one of the most experienced journeymen the NFL has ever seen. What began as a routine depth chart adjustment quickly turned into a test of preparation, durability, and trust at quarterback.For Washington, this was not about future plans or long-term development. It was about getting through a game and possibly the rest of the season without the position collapsing entirely. Josh Johnson’s entry was less dramatic and more practical. He stepped in because he knew the system, understood the pressure, and could keep the offense functional when options were running out fast.Josh Johnson’s career is built on moments exactly like this. He has lived on the edges of rosters, learned countless playbooks, and answered calls when teams were desperate for stability. Eighteen seasons across four professional leagues have shaped him into a quarterback who values efficiency over flash. Coaches know what they are getting. Teammates do too.Washington’s emergency depth tells the real story. Sam Hartman remains on the practice squad but was not elevated, making him unavailable.Luke McCaffrey and Colson Yankoff, both former college quarterbacks now playing other positions, were inactive due to injuries. If Johnson were to go down, there would be no true quarterback left to run the offense. That reality explains why every snap he takes carries weight beyond the scoreboard.Johnson’s NFL journey reads like a map of football survival. He has been part of 14 franchises, from early starts in Tampa Bay to short stints in San Francisco, Baltimore, and New York. He has filled roles in the UFL, XFL, and AAF, always staying ready, always waiting for the next call. Those experiences sharpen instincts that do not show up in box scores. in chronological order, he has played for the following teams so far:His numbers may be modest, averaging just under 20 passes per NFL season, but his value lies elsewhere. Johnson understands game flow, limits mistakes, and keeps teammates calm. In a week defined by injuries and uncertainty, Washington is not asking him to be a savior. They are asking him to be steady. Sometimes, in the NFL, that is the hardest role of all.Also Read: Matthew Stafford’s wife Kelly lashes out at NFL refs in fiery post after shocking Rams loss","Josh Johnson has been part of 14 NFL franchises.

Randi Mahomes’ message brings calm as the Chiefs face a rare turning point

It feels like a strange place for the Kansas City Chiefs to be in, and the emotions of this moment stretch far beyond the field. Patrick Mahomes' season-ending knee injury has changed everything from the Chiefs' outlook on making the playoffs to bringing attention toward how his family is handling such a difficult time.Brittany Mahomes has avoided addressing the public, but Patrick's mother, Randi Mahomes, has been a steady and reassuring voice for fans.Following surgery to repair torn ACL and LCL ligaments in his left knee, which abruptly ended his 2025 season, Patrick Mahomes formally started his rehabilitation. Randi Mahomes spoke to fans directly as concerns about the Chiefs' future circulate, expressing gratitude for the emotional support her son has received.“Thank you all for the prayers and kind messages for Patrick. We truly appreciate every one of them,” she wrote.Her message resonated with a fan base that wasn't used to disappointment. Expectations are extremely high due to Kansas City's dynasty-era dominance, and it is shocking for Mahomes to miss the playoffs for the first time. Those close to the team, however, maintain that fear is unfounded.His recovery is expected to take about nine months, according to team doctors, keeping him on track for a full return in 2026.Chiefs officials are still optimistic that Mahomes' legacy won't be defined by this setback because of his work ethic and access to modern medical care.For the time being, Randi's appreciation and Brittany's silence both convey the same message: healing comes first.

Despite pain and prior back issues, Stafford stayed in the game, reinforcing his tough mindset. The Rams’ loss tightened the MVP race, but Kelly’s post highlighted the human side behind the pressure.

Kelly Stafford breaks her silence after Matthew Stafford's injury scare

The late-game injury scare for Los Angeles Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford against the Seattle Seahawks was cause for concern far beyond the final score. In the middle of a brutal NFL stretch run, Stafford took a heavy hit to the ribs that sent him briefly to the medical tent, freezing fans and analysts alike. But what followed mattered just as much as the injury itself.Kelly Stafford chose that moment to publicly remind people who Matthew is beyond the helmet-a husband, father, and competitor who continues to show up-not a stat line or betting favorite. It cut through the noise of MVP odds, playoff math, and weekly hot takes; it grounded the conversation in something more human and real.Kelly Stafford's Instagram reel was personal. By framing Matthew through the context of the chaotic season, she repositioned the injury scare as part of a much longer story of resiliency. Stafford staying in the game despite rib pain only reinforced that image. The moment also carried extra weight considering he has already been managing lingering back issues that limited his offseason and forced the Rams to carefully pace his preparation.Stafford himself has never leaned away from physical football. As he put it, “Whatever happens, happens. I’m playing like I always play. I got no issues with a physical game.Obviously, would love to stay as clean as possible, but I’m not thinking twice about that at all. I’m out there ready to go play.” That mindset explains why he stayed on the field and why his wife’s message resonated.From a football perspective, the Seahawks loss complicated things. Stafford's MVP odds slipped slightly, not because his play cratered, but because the Rams lost control of the NFC West and the race for the No. 1 seed. MVP voters tend to reward quarterbacks on top teams, opening the door for contenders like Josh Allen and Drake Maye.Still, with two weeks left, the spotlight is only getting brighter. Kelly Stafford's message didn't defend a résumé or argue for awards. It reminded everyone what's underneath them and why this stretch matters more than ever.Also Read: ‘Should we be looking into this?’ Matthew Stafford’s beau Kelly ignites firestorm after Rams’ OT loss to Seahawks","Kelly Stafford shared an emotional message after Matthew Stafford’s rib injury scare against the Seahawks.

The comment, shared by a Turning Point USA associate, sparked backlash and debate online. Swift has not responded, but the moment highlights her outsized cultural influence beyond music.

How a private comment turned Taylor Swift into a viral lightning rod

Taylor Swift has been dragged into another political-adjacent controversy, this one without saying a word. The global pop star was trending online after comments attributed to Erika Kirk, the widow of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, blew up into a social media firestorm.What started as an internal remark about honoring a late husband spilled into the public sphere, largely because of how Swift's record-shattering Eras Tour was invoked. For many fans, the comparison felt unnecessary and disrespectful. For critics, it only underlined how Swift's cultural dominance is increasingly deployed even in moments far removed from music, entertainment, or fandom.The controversy took off after Alex Clark, a podcast host associated with Turning Point USA, shared a post describing directions allegedly given by Erika Kirk while planning her late husband’s funeral. Clark wrote:""Last night Erika gave us specific direction: 'I want the Taylor Swift concert to look like nothing compared to this.' As a swiftie I know what that means and what the challenge is. Buy your flights. Let’s go.”Multiple reports said Kirk’s comment was meant to emphasize sold-out crowds and a huge audience to celebrate her husband’s memory. But Swift’s Eras Tour is widely regarded as both a cultural moment and a major commercial force, so invoking that event opened the online chat.People on social media began questioning why a pop star would be used as a yardstick for such a delicate context.Swift's supporters placed blame on Kirk and her team for dragging the singer into an unrelated political or ideological arena, while others suggested that this comparison showed just how deeply Swift's influence has seeped into American culture.Most important, Swift and her team have kept silent. No word has been issued by the singer or her representatives, allowing the argument to go on without vindication.What is clear, however, is that Taylor Swift's name is now way heavier than music. Praised, criticized, or simply invoked, her cultural imprint feeds dialogue-serving as tinder in many a place unlikely or uncomfortable.Also Read: “Men that I date…”: Taylor Swift shares emotional truth about breakup with Joe Alwyn that led her to Travis Kelce","Comments attributed to Erika Kirk, widow of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, sparked a social media firestorm.

A new chapter for Gisele Bündchen as Tom Brady stays rooted in football and fatherhood

Three years since one of the most discussed celebrity divorces in the history of sports, the Tom Brady-Gisele Bündchen chapter is still developing in quite different ways. Although Brady is publicly engaged in football, family time, and his post-retirement business, Bundchen has made one incredibly personal choice, which is an indicator of a new stage in her life.After many years of fame, the one-time supermodel has decided to find stability and privacy after spending more than a decade with the NFL star. This recent development highlights that both have since gone their own ways, but are at least connected by shared parenting, history and a general level of interest in their personal lives that never really goes away as fans revisit the emotional aftermath of their 2022 breakup. As Bündchen's wedding news made headlines, Brady shared an adorable family picture on his Instagram story.According to TMZ, Bündchen has married longtime partner Joaquim Valente in a private ceremony in Florida, marking a major personal milestone years after her divorce from Brady. The outlet reported:“A source familiar with the situation tells us Gisele and Joaquim got hitched earlier this month in a small ceremony at their house in Surfside, Florida.We obtained their marriage license, and it shows they were issued the license on Dec. 1 and got hitched Dec. 3.”Bundchen and Valente have a young son whose existence has been another dimension to her family life. Although the supermodel has mostly avoided taking sides, the gesture is an indication of a deliberate choice of focusing on emotion over headlines.Meanwhile, Brady juggles between work and fatherhood. He recently posted a seldom seen family image, cementing his reputation as a man who does it all with Benjamin and Vivian, his two children with Bundchen, and the eldest son, Jack. Brady is also one of the most recognizable NFL faces professionally, as Fox Sports lead analyst and a minor shareholder in the Las Vegas Raiders.Even though their lives have diverged, the two seem to be on their own terms firmly dedicated to growth, family, and moving on.Also Read: Is Tom Brady dating Brooks Nader?

His heartfelt comments describing her as “incredible” have fueled curiosity, especially with no photos or appearances to confirm her identity. Rodgers’ rare openness highlights a deeply private love story unfolding away from the spotlight.

Why Aaron Rodgers’ quiet love story continues to fascinate fans

Aaron Rodgers is not only a great quarterback in the NFL, he is also among the most discussed players of the league as he is controversial due to his frankness, individuality, and weirdness in his approach to fame.In early 2025, the Pittsburgh Steelers star stated that he was married but did not want people to know much about his wife. Her name is Brittani, but even after months of curiosity, she has not been seen. She has no photos, no appearances in the media, no social media posts. Such silence has only given people increased curiosity which has turned the personal life of Rodgers into one of the most confusing off-field stories of the NFL.Rodgers shocked fans in December 2024 when he announced that Brittani was his girlfriend on The Pat McAfee Show. June 2025, the interest increased when he visited the Steelers facility wearing a wedding ring and this confirmed they were married although he had failed to announce it publicly but Rodgers offered no public details.However, during Steelers training camp in July, Rodgers opened up emotionally in an interview with NFL Network, offering his clearest insight yet into his marriage.“When you meet the right one, and you’re with the right one, your whole world changes in a second,” he said. “And to have that person that unconditionally loves you behind the scenes, there's no better feeling in the world, and I have the most incredible wife. I just really love her.”Rodgers did not talk a lot or idealize his relationship. He instead concentrated more on emotional foundation, support and personal development as Brittani proves that she maintains things in the background.Rodgers puts a stark contrast between his image in the public and his personal tranquility by maintaining the privacy of his marriage. When being seen can be a way of being proven correct, Rodgers has proven to be the best player in the game and has shown that sometimes being silent and not showing everything is best.Also Read: Aaron Rodgers’ mystery marriage raises questions after Olivia Munn reveals what she endured","Aaron Rodgers has confirmed he is married but continues to keep his wife, Brittani, completely out of the public eye. His heartfelt comments describing her as “incredible” have fueled curiosity, especially with no photos or appearances to confirm her identity.

“The losses affect Taylor”: Travis Kelce’s season-ending loss forces Taylor Swift into an emotional reality check,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/the-losses-affect-taylor-travis-kelces-season-ending-loss-forces-taylor-swift-into-an-emotional-reality-check/articleshow/126092566.cms,"Travis Kelce’s season-ending loss with the Chiefs has reportedly taken an emotional toll not just on him, but on Taylor Swift as well. Sources say Swift is sharing the weight of Kelce’s frustration as he processes a rare professional low. The setback has introduced unfamiliar emotional territory for the high-profile couple.

The emotional burden of Travis Kelce losses that Taylor Swift is carrying on her hands

The heartbreaking defeat of the Kansas City Chiefs against the Los Angeles Chargers did not only end a season, but placed a rare emotional test before one of the most discussed couples in pop culture. Shuffle Insider reports the loss of 16-13 put Travis Kelce’s playoff dreams to rest, and the burden of such an event is weighing down on his relationship with Taylor Swift.The couple has been in the blissful stage of new love, but this loss has thrust them into uncharted territory. Swift is one of the artists who, based on reports, is undergoing an alternate persona, being present in and around the loss rather than the victory. This is solid, grounded, and real, and it is a change for a couple used to winning seasons and extended applause.According to the sources that are close to the situation, Kelce has been taking the loss seriously, as elite competitors tend to do. One of the insiders said, “Like any top athlete, Travis is all about winning, so when things aren’t going the team’s way he takes it pretty badly. The losses affect Taylor because she’s riding out all of those emotions alongside him.”According to the source, this is a new stage to them, and they said, “They’ve both been on a high for so long so this is uncharted territory for them.” Reflecting more on this challenging time for the couple, the source claims, “They’re not this golden couple who can wave a magic wand at anything and come out on top.”The fact that Kelce was seen to be frustrated after the game was just fuel to the speculations. He eluded media questions and gave only a single brief answer, saying “It’s not the time. I’ll catch you guys during the week.”That silence has sparked a retirement discussion once more, as Kelce has already admitted that he was undecided about his future when he appeared on the "" Bussin with the Boys"" podcast. He said, “It’s the last one on the contract. I’m focused on this one. I don’t know what next year is going to feel like. I don’t know what I’m going to feel like in March or April next year when I make that decision.”In the case of Swift and Kelce, this loss at the end of the season can possibly signal a more human period that is less about head lines and more about the strength, the cheers and what follows the applause.Also Read: “Men that I date…”: Taylor Swift shares emotional truth about breakup with Joe Alwyn that led her to Travis Kelce",Travis Kelce's season-ending loss has reportedly taken an emotional toll on Taylor Swift.

Cooper Kupp’s NFL earnings, contracts, and bonuses

Cooper Kupp’s net worth, endorsements, and business ventures in 2025

Arguably the pre-eminent wide receiver of his generation, Cooper Kupp has now entered the news cycle in 2025 as a football player but also regarding his wealth status. Kupp, who is most recognized by casual observers as the MVP of Super Bowl LVI and arguably the best route runner in football after a historic 2021, has established himself as an invaluable offensive weapon. With his career entering a new chapter, the earnings profile reflects past success and long-term brand value.The trade of Kupp has long been a remarkable development for a now-32-year-old Kupp from the Los Angeles Rams. His marketability has not waned, although he has been injury-prone in recent seasons. His NFL career is winding down, and while he has earned some of this cash on the field, through contract earnings and performance bonuses, he has earned the rest as one of the biggest names in sports endorsements.After being drafted by the Rams, Cooper Kupp signed a humble rookie contract and then became one of the most productive receivers in the NFL. He was rewarded with an extension last offseason, a three-year contract with a maximum value of $80 million, making him one of the highest-paid wide receivers on the market.Kupp obviously never came close to making the full dollar amount on that contract, due to injury, but he still netted a chunk of change in guaranteed salary and bonuses.The Seattle Seahawks signed him to a new three-year, $45 million contract after his release in 2025 by the Rams. The contract includes a large signing bonus, guaranteed money, and incentives based on playing time and roster status.As such, Kupp's annual salary for the 2025 campaign ranks him well behind the NFL's highest-paid wide receivers and amongst veteran receivers. Yet, his lifetime NFL earnings have now surpassed the hundreds of millions themselves, which is a solid economic cornerstone.Cooper Kupp has an estimated net worth of $18 million by 2025. The number accounts for his NFL earnings as well as endorsements and personal investments over close to ten years in the league.Kupp has collaborated with a handful of mega companies in the clothing, food, and lifestyle space. With his clean public persona and image as a disciplinarian, he has become a constant ambassador for national campaigns, providing steady off-field revenue. Such endorsements have assuaged the effects of injury-shortened seasons and diminishing on-field productivity.Also Read: Why Davante Adams is not playing vs Seahawks today?

Grant Cohn criticizes Tom Brady’s role with the Las Vegas Raiders

Tom Brady is once again in the middle of NFL talk, but this time it is not about wins or Super Bowls. The former quarterback is now a minority owner of the Las Vegas Raiders, a FOX Sports broadcaster, and a businessman. On Friday, December 13, 2025, a short clip of Tom Brady speaking about leadership went viral on X. The timing mattered. The Raiders were already struggling with a 2–12 record in the 2025 NFL season.The comment sparked a strong reaction from NFL insider Grant Cohn, who questioned whether Tom Brady is paying enough attention to the Raiders while the team continues to lose under head coach Pete Carroll.Grant Cohn shared his reaction on Saturday, December 14, 2025, through a post on X. He responded directly to Tom Brady’s leadership comments made on the Impaulsive Podcast, hosted by Logan Paul.In that interview, Tom Brady said leaders “don’t have days off” and show up every day to make others better. Cohn turned that message against him. “This man is running the Raiders,” Grant Cohn wrote.“That team is the 10th thing on his mind. They’re so screwed.” The post quickly spread among NFL fans and media members, adding more pressure to an already rough season in Las Vegas.Tom Brady officially became a minority owner of the Raiders earlier in 2025. His role is advisory, not daily operations. He is not on the sideline like Pete Carroll during games.He is also not handling roster decisions like general manager John Spytek. Still, because of Tom Brady’s history with the New England Patriots and his reputation as a winner, many expected his presence to help change the culture.Pete Carroll’s first season with the Raiders has been difficult. The team entered Week 16 with a 2–12 record, placing them near the bottom of the AFC standings. Injuries, uneven quarterback play, and defensive mistakes have all played a role.The Raiders are set to face the Houston Texans in Week 16 on Sunday, December 22, 2025, in Houston, Texas. The Texans are 9–5 and known for their strong defense and steady offense.Earlier this season, on December 7, the Texans were credited with eliminating Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs from playoff contention.If Las Vegas loses, the record would drop to 2–13. After that, the Raiders play the New York Giants on December 28 in Las Vegas, followed by a season finale against the Kansas City Chiefs, who look different without Patrick Mahomes.Also Read: Stefon Diggs Vs Travis Kelce Net Worth In 2025: Who Is Richer, NFL Career Endorsements, Mansions And More","NFL insider questions Tom Brady’s focus as Pete Carroll and the Raiders sink to 2–12 in 2025.

Jason Kelce’s casual comment is what kicked off the wedding tradition speculation

Is #JasonKelce ready for his best man speech?

When it comes to Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce , even the smallest comment can turn into full-blown internet speculation. This time, the buzz isn’t about a song lyric or a game-day appearance, it’s about a wedding tradition that might not happen at all. The surprising part? The hint didn’t come from tabloids or fans, but from Travis Kelce’s own brother, Jason Kelce. One casual comment was enough to send Swifties and NFL fans into theory mode.The entire conversation started after Jason Kelce made an appearance where he was asked about Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce’s future wedding plans. Instead of teasing details or confirming anything, Jason kept it very real. He admitted he hasn’t been told to be the best man.Jason didn’t suggest plans were finalized, and he didn’t say anything was intentionally being skipped. He simply said he hasn’t been looped in yet. Still, coming from someone inside the Kelce family, that uncertainty instantly grabbed attention.So what’s the tradition everyone is talking about? The best man role and speech.Because Jason Kelce said he doesn’t know if he’s the best man or if there will even be a speech, fans took that as a sign that Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce might skip the classic best man moment altogether.That includes the formal title and the traditional toast during the reception.There is no confirmation that this tradition is being dropped. There’s also no confirmation that wedding plans are finalized at all. The idea comes purely from Jason saying he hasn’t been given details, not from an official decision by the couple.If anything, this situation highlights how intentionally low-key Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce are being. They haven’t confirmed the wedding guestlist, bands or traditions and Jason’s comment suggests even close family members aren’t sharing details publicly.That doesn’t mean traditions are being skipped on purpose. It simply shows the couple is keeping plans close, avoiding leaks, and doing things their own way whether that includes a best man speech or not.Until the couple shares details themselves if they ever do everything else remains guesswork. And knowing Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce, doing things quietly and differently might be the most on-brand move of all.Also read - Puka Nacua fined $25,000 by the NFL — here’s what he said about the referees","Jason Kelce’s casual comment is what kicked off the wedding tradition speculation.

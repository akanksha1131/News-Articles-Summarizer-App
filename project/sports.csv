BENGALURU: Coming in at No. 6 in the 16th over against Mumbai Indians on Monday, Jitesh Sharma got going against Trent Boult following up a boundary with a maximum. In fact, the Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) wicketkeeper-bat scored 24 off eight Boult deliveries. He even picked up a loose ball from Jasprit Bumrah to send it into the long-on stands during his unbeaten 19-ball 40.Sharma’s repertoire of shots garnered a lot of attention. A utility player of high value, Sharma, who was roped in by RCB for Rs 11 crore this season, came into his own with the Punjab Kings in 2022. At RCB, Dinesh Karthik has taken the 31-year-old under his wings and the result — from one finisher to another — is telling.Sharma, a like-to-like replacement to Karthik — who hung up his boots after last season — worked extensively with the now RCB batting coach during the off-season. On the eve of RCB’s home game against Delhi Capitals, Sharma spoke about Karthik’s role in reshaping his game.“It’s been a great journey till now. During the off-season I worked hard with him (Karthik). The shots I am playing right now are a replica of what he used to play. He is trying to turn me into a new player because he believes that I can play all around the circle.”After an underwhelming 2024 season, Sharma emphasised on the mental blocks he has been able to clear.“Last year’s performance was because of mental issues. I was not mentally in the game because I was thinking ahead and about the future. When I met Dinesh bhai, he told me that it’s a human error. It’s not rocket science; it happens to everyone,” he explained.Having sorted his mental demons, Sharma also revealed that confidence building is a part of his training regime.“My confidence doesn’t rely on the score. It always depends on my process and how I train. It’s because, if I have confidence in the end result, then the variables go up and down. So, I mostly keep my confidence high during practice,” he added.",Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) wicketkeeper-bat scored 24 off eight Boult deliveries.

BENGALURU: Thanks to the auction process, players in the Indian Premier League (IPL) regularly come up against their old teams, some with a sense of nostalgia and others with, perhaps, revenge in mind. Regardless, little love is lost as they pursue IPL glory and its riches.Mohammed Siraj, currently with Gujarat Titans, is a case in point as he made an emotional return to the M Chinnaswamy Stadium last week and did enough to hand Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) their first loss in three matches. Emotions will run high again when unbeaten Delhi Capitals (DC) take on RCB on Thursday.Several DC players have a connection with RCB and their home ground. There is Faf du Plessis, who led RCB for three seasons until the franchise relinquished their hold on him ahead of the auction last year. The 40-year-old missed out on silverware but came close to etching his name as RCB’s most famous captain since he led the team into two playoffs. He scored more than 400 runs in each season, a remarkable 730 runs in 2023 being the highlight.Du Plessis, now deputy to Axar Patel in DC, could add a few more at a ground that was his second home not long ago, though his fitness remains a concern. He sat out the previous game against Chennai Super Kings due to a groin niggle.Capitals’ assistant coach Matthew Mott was non-committal on du Plessis’s availability.“The beauty of the schedule so far is we’ve had some really good breaks and Faf’s had a good break. He’ll get assessed today by the physios with a view to playing. To the naked eye, he certainly looks like he’s moving around a lot better.”Then, there is Australian pace merchant Mitchell Starc, who cut his teeth in the IPL with RCB in 2014. The left-arm pacer picked up 34 wickets in two seasons before a foot fracture ruled him out of the 2016 edition.KL Rahul is another who returns to his home ground with a new team again this season. The stylish batter, who missed the opening match due to the birth of his daughter, scored a match-winning 51-ball 77 in the previous contest against CSK. Rahul, who spent four seasons at RCB, was widely speculated to return home at the auction but was snapped up by DC for Rs 14 crore.Both the teams come into the contest on the back of wins, with RCB prevailing in a tense defence of their tall total against Mumbai Indians at the Wankhede Stadium on Monday. While skipper Rajat Patidar and Virat Kohli scored crucial half-centuries, the takeaways from the match were the return to form of southpaw Devdutt Padikkal and wicketkeeper Jitesh Sharma’s game-changing unbeaten 19-ball 40.Barring leggie Suyash Sharma and pace ace Josh Hazlewood, all the other bowlers conceded runs, especially in the second half of Mumbai’s innings, but they managed to soak up the pressure at the death.This new-look RCB have got a lot off their back. They conquered Kolkata Knight Riders, CSK, and MI in their own dens, but came a cropper against the Titans at home. They will hope that loss is an aberration, since the Capitals have plenty of bowling ammunition, especially with spin duo Kuldeep Yadav and Axar in their ranks.","Delhi Capitals take on Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) on Thursday.

Their only final appearance ended in defeat to Barcelona in 2006.Real Madrid's defeat exposed their vulnerabilities, having already lost 10 times this season. They currently sit four points behind Barcelona in La Liga.The match began with Real Madrid showing early promise. Vinicius Junior curled a shot wide after receiving a pass from Mbappe inside the Arsenal area. Kylian Mbappe demonstrated his pace by breaking through Arsenal's defense, but his shot went straight at goalkeeper David Raya.Arsenal responded with Rice forcing a save from Courtois with a header from Jurrien Timber's cross. Courtois also denied Gabriel Martinelli's follow-up attempt.The deadlock was broken in the 58th minute when Rice scored his first free-kick from 25 yards, curling the ball around the Real Madrid wall.Arsenal maintained their momentum with a sequence of attempts. Courtois saved shots from Martinelli and Merino, while David Alaba made a goal-line clearance.Rice scored his second goal in the 70th minute with another free-kick from 20 yards that found the top corner.Arsenal fans celebrated Rice's performance with chants of ""Declan Rice, we got him half praise,"" referencing his £105 million transfer fee.Merino sealed the victory five minutes later with a precise finish from 12 yards out.The match ended on a sour note for Real Madrid when Camavinga received a red card for kicking the ball away in the closing minutes.Real Madrid's star players struggled to make an impact, with Jude Bellingham having a quiet game while Mbappe and Vinicius Junior only managed occasional threats.For Arsenal, this victory represented one of their most significant European nights, putting them in a strong position to advance to their first Champions League semi-final in 15 years.The return leg at the Bernabeu will determine if Arsenal can maintain their advantage and progress in their quest for their first Champions League trophy.",Arsenal defeated Real Madrid 3-0 in their Champions League quarter-final first leg. Declan Rice scored two stunning free-kicks in the second half. Mikel Merino added a third goal before Real's Eduardo Camavinga was sent off.

KOLKATA: Mohun Bagan SG are alive with their dream of an Indian Super League ( ISL ) ‘double’.A penalty by Jason Cummings (51) and a banger from Lalengmawia Ralte ‘Apuia’ (90+4) helped Jose Molina’s League Shield winners subdue a doggedly defensive Jamshedpur FC 2-0 in the return leg of the ISL Cup semifinals at the Salt Lake Stadium on Monday and clinch a place in the final for the third season running with a 3-2 victory on aggregate.Mohun Bagan — who lost the championship final to Mumbai City last season — will host Bengaluru FC in the summit clash here on April 12, hoping to become the second team to seal a Shield-and-Cup double.Khalid Jamil’s Jamshedpur came here with a 2-1 advantage and laid out an ultra-defensive plan, making life difficult for Bagan, who lashed the rival box with attack after attack.In the absence of suspended defensive mainstay Stephen Eze and Ashutosh Mehta, Pranoy Halder rose to the occasion, trying to keep Jamshedpur afloat against the tide. But Halder also committed blunders allowing Bagan the necessary routes to turn things around.First, Halder handled Tom Aldred’s header off a Cummings corner. Cummings made no mistake from the resultant penalty. Then, Apuia provided the proverbial coup de grâce, after Halder gave the ball away to Anirudh Thapa who laid it in the Mizo’s path.",Mohun Bagan SG are alive with their dream of an Indian Super League ( ISL ) ‘double’ A penalty by Jason Cummings (51) and a banger from Lalengmawia Ralte ‘Apuia’ (90+4) helped Jose Molina’s League Shield winners subdue a doggedly defensive Jamshedpur FC 2-0.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120083779,imgsize-68342,width-400,resizemode-4/Mohun-Bagan.jpg"

Bombay Sport Exchange Ep. 2: GroupM's Vinit Karnik on IPL's growth and emerging sports

Mumbai: He may have only been at the Santiago Bernabeu for a season, but it was enough for Michael Owen to understand the weight of wearing the Real Madrid jersey. And when you join one of the most decorated football clubs in the world, comparisons with its past greats are inevitable, Owen says.That’s the moment Madrid’s superstar summer signing Kylian Mbappe is currently living. Having equalled his idol Cristiano Ronaldo ’s tally of 33 goals in his first season with the Madrid giants, the France captain has got his coach Carlo Ancelotti wishing Mbappe can go on to match the Portuguese great’s towering accomplishments at the club.“The thing with Real Madrid, of course, is everybody compares you to greats of the past and you almost have to win virtually every trophy just to keep up with the demand and the expectation,” Owen said ahead of the ‘Legends Faceoff’ fixture in Mumbai on Sunday.“(With) Real Madrid winning the league, winning Champions Leagues in recent years, if Mbappe then turns up and they don’t have a good season, everybody blames him. That is an incredible pressure because they were winning before. I’m sure they will continue to be successful as well, but I think he’s done very well.“He is one of the most destructive players on the planet. He’s quick, he’s got great touch, he can score great goals, so I always thought it was going to be a great signing.”The former England international also analysed how football has evolved over the years, particularly the role of the number 9.“Everybody had two strikers when I played professional football. Now hardly anybody does. Somebody like myself, I guess I don’t know where I would fit in in today’s game. Maybe I’d have to play in one of the wider areas, I don’t know. The profile of the striker has definitely changed,” Owen said.Many pundits and former players attribute this change to Pep Guardiola, whose breathtaking Barcelona team from 2008–2012 soon became a template which teams across Europe couldn’t resist copying. Owen joined the chorus who feel it has turned football into a monotonous watch.“Yeah, I do agree. Everybody sees a great manager and their success and feels as if they have to copy that. And certain players, certain teams are not really capable in many ways of it, yet they still play that way and give away goals. It doesn’t suit all players,” he said, also expressing concern over the decreasing number of footballing ‘geniuses’.“It’s a much more athletic game now. It’s as important to be a good runner than it is to have skill which was never ever the case. Those old maverick players, just genius types of players, they’re slowly disappearing from our game and now it’s about hard, fast stats and running stats. So it is changing but it’s fascinating and it will continue to change again.”A technically gifted striker with a great eye for goal during his prime, Owen, now 45, scored 16 goals from 45 games in the famous Los Blancos shirt, including one in a 4-2 El Clasico win against Barcelona at the Bernabeu.“I was fortunate that I played in virtually all of the big derbies in England, but I don’t think anything compares to El Clasico. As a one-off game. I think it’s the biggest.“Scoring and playing in front of your own crowds and winning a big game was probably my biggest and best memory of playing for Real Madrid,” said Owen who had the opportunity to relive those memories as he featured for the Real Madrid Legends side at DY Patil Stadium.",Michael Owen believes Real Madrid's Kylian Mbappe is one of the most destructive players on the planet. The former England striker also believes the profile of the striker has changed over the years.

When will CSK legend MS Dhoni retire from IPL? Astrologer Greenstone Lobo predicts

Chennai: For over a decade now, Manchester United have been a shadow of the indomitable force that they were under serial winner Alex Ferguson.The trophy cabinet has had to be opened only a few times since Ferguson’s departure in 2013 and United have constantly been playing catch-up in England. One player who saw the English Premier League outfit reach multiple troughs during his 12-year stint (2011 to 2023) was defender Phil Jones . The former England international crisply summed up how United’s stocks have fallen drastically over the years, saying that mid-table teams and relegation battlers in the EPL are no longer frightened when making the trip to the iconic Old Trafford .“Around 2011, when we were in the tunnel before playing matches against lower-ranked teams, we had won even before we walked out onto the pitch. They (opponents) were petrified playing at Old Trafford, you could see the fear in them. We have sort of lost that and that is where we need to get back to,” said Jones, who was in Chennai for the final of the third edition of Apollo Tyres ‘Road to Old Trafford’, a five-a-side tournament supported by United.While Jones acknowledged that there is heaps of work to be done for United to get back to the upper echelons, he backed manager Ruben Amorim to guide them to great heights. “Amorim should be given a long run. He has been brought in for the right reasons, to improve United. I love how honest and open he is. You can understand where he is coming from, he is not hiding anything. I really like that side of him,” Jones said of the Portuguese.“It is going to be difficult for Amorim. He loves to play a different style and brand of football to the formation that we are used to, so we need to prepare to go through (this journey). We have to be patient and believe in what he is building,” added Jones.The two-time World Cupper is expecting United, stuttering in the league this term, to turn the tide next season. “There is still a great chance to qualify for the Champions League (by winning the Europa League). We could see success this season but hopefully, we see the best of United next season. There are a lot of young players in the team, there are a lot of players who are suffering from lack of confidence. Confidence is a huge thing in any sport. Slowly but surely, Amorim will build leaders who will bring that winning mentality,” Jones said.","Manchester United have been a shadow of the force that they were under Alex Ferguson.

“Watching KL Rahul bat is like sitting and watching paint dry on a wall,” Kevin Pietersen had once tweeted. And when Rahul cheekily brought up that old tweet after winning the Man of the Match award against Chennai Super Kings on Saturday, KP — now his team’s mentor — laughed: “Did I say that? Well, I’m glad you’ve changed your game.”Promoted at the eleventh hour to open after Faf du Plessis was ruled out due to an injury, adaptable craftsman KL Rahul produced a knock (77, 51b; 6x4, 3x6) of quiet finesse that became the centrepiece in Delhi Capitals ’ win at the MA Chidambaram Stadium.“Just at about 11 o’clock this morning when we found out that Faf would be doubtful, I had a chat with him saying, ‘KL, this is an option we’re looking at. How open are you?’ (Pat came the reply): ‘Happy, coach. I’m happy to go up the order.’ So it was as seamless as that,” said Delhi head coach Hemang Badani Rahul doesn’t seem to have a permanent slot in the batting line-up, either for India or for his franchise. The issue came up for discussion and Badani was adamant that it’s the right-hander’s ability to adapt that makes him such a flexible cricketer. “He’s somebody who’s been around long enough to understand the need of the hour. He has opened for India, he’s batted at four-five in the recently concluded Champions Trophy. And, he’s somebody who can play spin and pace well. I don’t think it’s difficult for someone of his calibre. If I had to make someone else do it, then it wouldn’t have been easy. But I think he has got the calibre, mindset and understanding of the game to go up the order par or bat at No. 4,” explained Badani .Opening is familiar ground for Rahul. It’s also where he’s faced the sharpest scrutiny for anchoring too much, for not keeping pace with the game. But there’s been a shift. At 32, Rahul seems determined to step out of the old template.“I worked really hard on my white-ball game in the last year or so. Big shout to Abhishek Nayar (current India assistant coach). I worked a lot with him, ever since he’s come into the Indian team. We spend hours and hours together talking about my white-ball game and how I can be better,” said Rahul, who last played a T20 international way back in 2022.Rahul also revealed that he has realised that T20 cricket has changed a lot and now he wants to just enjoy hitting boundaries. “I think somewhere I found the fun playing white-ball cricket, I think somewhere along the way I lost that fun of hitting boundaries and hitting sixes. I wanted to take the game ‘deep, deep, deep’ and that somehow stuck in my head. So back to enjoying my cricket. Just see the ball and try to be aggressive.”From “paint dry” to powerplay disruptor, Rahul, who is now also embracing fatherhood, played with intent, fluency and adaptability against CSK. His strike rate? A healthy 150. This wasn’t Rahul rebranding himself. It was more like the beginning of a new KL Rahul in T20 cricket.","KL Rahul was promoted to open for Delhi Capitals after Faf du Plessis was ruled out due to an injury.

Panaji: At a time when Indian football is making news for the wrong reasons, here’s another unwanted first for the sport in the country.The I-League , Indian football’s second-tier club competition run by the All India Football Federation (AIFF), saw high-intensity contests on the concluding day, but there was no champion.As things stand, Churchill Brothers finished on top with 40 points, one more than second-placed Inter Kashi (39). Ideally, they should have been crowned champions, but with Kashi scoring twice in stoppage time to edge past Rajasthan United 3-1 at home, they are also in contention for the top spot, and consequently a place in next season’s Indian Super League (ISL).Kashi were awarded three points by the AIFF disciplinary committee after Namdhari were found to have fielded an ineligible player. That decision was challenged and later stayed by the appeals committee, with the next hearing scheduled for April 28. Should the appeals committee decide that the forfeiture stands, Kashi will move on top with 42 points.“While the draw against Real Kashmir keeps Churchill Brothers at the top of the table, they must await the result of the AIFF Appeals Committee ’s hearing,” the AIFF said in its official report. Till then, no team can celebrate.When the referee blew the final whistle in Srinagar after Churchill were held 1-1 by Real Kashmir, some of the visiting players fell to the ground, knowing they had blown away a chance to win the title outright, without waiting for the appeals committee verdict.The Alemao family, out there in full force, were celebrating right in the middle of the field, only to be later greeted by a post from AIFF which said, “@churchillbrothersfcgoa provisionally finish top of the #ILeague table!”","Real Kashmir play out 1-1 draw with Churchill Brothers to close I-League season.

Saints demise

Liverpool slumped to just their second Premier League defeat this season as Fulham clinched a shock 3-2 win over the runaway leaders, while Southampton were relegated in record-setting time after a 3-1 loss at Tottenham on Sunday.The drama at Craven Cottage and Tottenham overshadowed a drab 0-0 draw between Manchester United and Manchester City Arsenal's 1-1 draw at Everton on Saturday left Liverpool needing just 11 points to secure a record-equalling 20th English top-flight title.Arne Slot's men were unbeaten in 26 league games and looked set to take another step towards the title when Alexis Mac Allister's stunning strike opened the scoring.But poor defending allowed Ryan Sessegnon, Alex Iwobi and Rodrigo Muniz to turn the game around for Fulham.The Reds appear to be running out of steam after challenging in four competitions for most of Slot's largely impressive first season since replacing Jurgen Klopp.But Liverpool are still almost certain to win their first title since 2020 with only seven games remaining for second-placed Arsenal to catch them.After a Champions League exit to Paris Saint-Germain and League Cup final defeat to Newcastle, Liverpool edged Everton 1-0 in a feisty Merseyside derby on Wednesday to get back to winning ways.However, their lethargic effort against Fulham might delay the title party for a little while longer.""In general we are not making many of these errors, let alone three in one game,"" Slot said.""People want to make stories which is their job. Many teams find it difficult to play Fulham. The second half performance was outstanding. We had chances but in the end we lacked time.""In north London, Brennan Johnson struck twice in the first half and Mateus Fernandes' late reply was too late to stop bottom-of-the-table Southampton crashing back to the Championship.Beaten for the 25th time in 31 games, Southampton are the first Premier League team to be relegated with seven matches still to play.Ipswich and Derby were relegated with six games left in 1994-95 and 2007-08 respectively.Ivan Juric's side are also still one shy of matching Derby's 2007-08 record low Premier League total points of 11.Juric, whose team are without a win in their last seven league matches, admitted this week that avoiding the record low points tally is Southampton's only target for the rest of their dismal season.""We have to avoid that record. Do our best. It cannot happen,"" Juric said.Southampton were pushed to the brink of relegation when fourth-bottom Wolves came from behind to beat Ipswich 2-1 on Saturday, leaving Saints 22 points from safety.Their slide down to the second tier was confirmed 315 days after they clinched promotion by beating Leeds in the Championship play-off final at Wembley.""It's a difficult day, a tough day but I see the fans, how they love their players and their team. It's something incredible. This experience has to serve to create something stronger than this,"" Juric said.Tottenham have been in turmoil themselves for much of the season, with fan protests against chairman Daniel Levy before and during the game underlining the depth of the problems in north London.But under-fire boss Ange Postecoglou, who was jeered by Tottenham fans during Thursday's defeat at Chelsea, earned a little breathing space thanks to a first win in five league games.Manchester City missed a chance to climb into fourth place after a dour derby stalemate at Old Trafford.Pep Guardiola's side remain fifth, which is likely to be the final place that brings qualification for next season's Champions League.But City have only a one-point advantage over sixth-placed Aston Villa and are just two points ahead of seventh-placed Newcastle, who have two games in hand.Cole Palmer was left on the bench for almost an hour as fourth-placed Chelsea's winless run on the road continued with a 0-0 draw at Brentford.Blues boss Enzo Maresca raised eyebrows by dropping England forward Palmer despite his side's battle to qualify for the Champions League.Chelsea have a UEFA Conference League quarter-final trip to Legia Warsaw on Thursday, but Maresca's priorities were questioned following the Blues' insipid display.",Liverpool slump to just their second Premier League defeat this season.

PUNE: India's young women tennis players have produced sparks of brilliance in recent times. They have a chance to step up to the next level when they compete in the AsiaOceania Group 1 competition of the Billie Jean King Cup , starting here on Tuesday.The Indian women barely managed to stay in the group after finishing fourth in the six-team event, held in China, last year. With Japan and the hosts having advanced to the Qualifiers, this edition presents Vishaal Uppal’s side with the best chance to go through to the playoffs.Team captain Uppal, a former Davis Cupper, has led the team to the World Group playoffs in 2020, a first for the Indian women. They lost to Latvia away the following year. Four years on, things couldn’t have been more different.The highest-ranked player in the field is World No. 41 Lulu Sun from New Zealand. The 23-year-old of mixed heritage caught the attention with her quarterfinal run at the Wimbledon as a qualifier last year, beating then World No. 8 Qinwen Zheng in the first round. Besides Sun, Thailand’s Mananchaya Sawangkaew (world ranked 110) and Lanlana Tararudee (166) as well as Joanna Garland of Chinese Taipei pose a major threat.“It’s a very even group. If you see the rankings of all the teams, they’re very similar, not much to choose from. So that makes the group very tough and very competitive,” Uppal said.Changes have swept through the Indian team as well. None of the players is ranked in the top-300, unlike in 2021 when Ankita Raina was 183. The side is also without Karman Kaur Thandi, who had broken into the top-200 in 2018 but is currently unranked owing to a lengthy injury layoff.

Carlos Alcaraz revealed at the Monte Carlo Masters press conference on Sunday that the pressure to overtake suspended Jannik Sinner as World No. 1 has negatively impacted his performance this season, with his only title in 2025 coming at Rotterdam two months ago.The 21-year-old Spanish tennis star currently sits at world number three, trailing Sinner by 3,610 points in the rankings.""A lot of people are asking me, or are telling me, that I have the chance to become number one if Jannik is not playing. So probably that pressure has killed me in some way,"" Alcaraz said during the press conference.""I'm not surprised because the people always say that we have to win the tournaments or the top people have to be there all the time playing finals or winning tournaments,"" he added.The Monte Carlo Masters marks the beginning of the clay-court season, a surface where Alcaraz has previously excelled, winning the French Open last year and consecutive Madrid Masters titles in 2022 and 2023.Sinner, the current world number one, received a three-month doping ban in February after testing positive twice for clostebol traces in March last year. The 23-year-old Italian is expected to return at the Rome Open in May.""I'm just thinking that I'm not able to become number one... in the clay season, even if Jannik is not playing, I don't have the chance to do it,"" Alcaraz stated. ""I think I'm too far from Jannik. So I'm just here and I realise that I don't have to think about it and just go there and play. That's my mindset right now.""The four-time Grand Slam champion has yet to win a match at Monte Carlo, having been eliminated in his 2022 debut and withdrawing from the last two editions.After receiving a first-round bye, Alcaraz will face either Francisco Cerundolo or Fabio Fognini in his opening match.","Carlos Alcaraz says pressure to overtake Jannik Sinner as World No. 1 has negatively impacted his performance this season.

NEW DELHI: Jannik Sinner , the three-time Grand Slam champion , received a three-month ban after testing positive twice for the banned substance clostebol .The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) agreed to the ban after Sinner admitted ""partial responsibility"" for team mistakes.Umberto Ferrara , Sinner's former physical trainer, has spoken publicly about the scandal for the first time. He claims to be blameless and places the responsibility squarely on Sinner's former physiotherapist, Giacomo Naldi .""I was perfectly aware that it was banned so I always kept it safely stashed away in my wash bag. I suggested to Naldi to use it for a cut which had not healed and was affecting his work. I was absolutely clear when I spoke to him about the nature of the product and it was imperative it never came into contact with Jannik. In effect I told him to use it only in my bathroom. Naldi did not deny he had been told, but he said he could not recall,"" he told Gazzetta dello Sport.Ferrara states that he had been using a spray containing clostebol, prescribed by a doctor for an illness, and had kept it safely stored away.He suggested that Naldi use the spray for a cut that was not healing, but explicitly warned him to use it only in Ferrara's bathroom and to ensure it never came into contact with Sinner.According to Ferrara, Naldi did not deny being warned about the nature of the product but claimed he could not recall the instructions.Ferrara alleges that Naldi treated Sinner without gloves and without washing his hands after using the spray, despite the warnings.Ferrara acknowledges that, in hindsight, he would not have handled the situation the same way. He expresses regret over the behavior of others and claims to have suffered due to the ""bad faith of some.""Sinner's suspension ends on May 4, allowing him to return in time for the French Open. The clay-court tournament in Hamburg will be his second tournament after his return, followed by the Italian Open in Rome.","Jannik Sinner received a three-month ban after testing positive twice for the banned substance clostebol.

Czech teen sensation Jakub Mensik stunned Novak Djokovic in straight sets 7-6 (7/4), 7-6 (7/4) to clinch the Miami Open championship at Hard Rock Stadium on Sunday. The 19-year-old world number 54 captured his maiden ATP Tour title in impressive fashion.The victory prevented Djokovic from reaching the milestone of 100 professional tennis titles in his illustrious career.Mensik overcame rain delays and a determined Djokovic to claim the Miami Open title. At 19, he became the second-youngest champion in the tournament’s history, following Carlos Alcaraz, who won as an 18-year-old in 2022.The match was delayed for nearly six hours due to rain in Florida, leaving Mensik with plenty of time to process the challenge ahead — preventing Djokovic from clinching his 100th career title.Born in September 2005, when Djokovic had already broken into the ATP top-100, Mensik refused to be overwhelmed by the occasion. Instead, he delivered a near-flawless performance, using his powerful serve and aggressive baseline game to become the first Czech player since Tomas Berdych in 2005 to win an ATP Masters 1000 event.Djokovic, appearing troubled by an issue under his right eye, frequently applied eye drops and consulted his team.Still, Mensik capitalised, racing to a 3-0 lead in the first set before Djokovic clawed back. In the tie-break, Mensik dominated, building a 5-0 advantage before closing it out with an overhead smash.The second set saw Djokovic applying pressure from the baseline, but Mensik remained composed, dropping just one break point in the match. With 77% of first-serve points won, the Czech teen sealed a statement victory, toppling a legend and etching his name in Miami Open history.","Jakub Mensik beat Novak Djokovic in straight sets 7-6 (7/4), 7-4.

World number one Aryna Sabalenka secured her first Miami Open title by defeating American Jessica Pegula 7-5 6-2 in the WTA 1000 event final at Hard Rock Stadium on Saturday. This victory marks Sabalenka's second title of 2025, following her Brisbane triumph in January, and her eighth WTA 1000 title overall.Sabalenka, who had recently lost the Indian Wells final to Russian teenager Mirra Andreeva, showed determination not to repeat that outcome in Miami.""I'm super happy to have this trophy, I was able to play my best tennis in the final,"" said Sabalenka, acknowledging Pegula's performance and referencing their previous encounter at the US Open final.The first set was marked by service struggles, featuring seven breaks of serve. Pegula challenged Sabalenka by drawing her to the net, but the momentum shifted when Pegula served at 6-5 down.Sabalenka secured the first set with a combination of a delicate forehand drop and a down-the-line winner.Despite losing her first service game in the second set, Sabalenka quickly regained control. She broke twice to establish a 3-1 lead and maintained her dominance to complete the victory in one hour and 27 minutes.""I think I was able to completely forget about (it being) the final, about the outside things and I was just so focused on the game,"" Sabalenka reflected.The Belarusian has won 12 of her last 14 matches against top 10 players, attributing her success to her performance in crucial moments.""It is all about those key moments of the match, about playing aggressive and staying with the game plan, going for shots without being afraid of losing the point,"" she explained.This marked Pegula's third loss to Sabalenka in a final. The American acknowledged Sabalenka's superiority on hard courts.""I consider myself one of the world's best hard-court players, but she's probably the best,"" Pegula stated after the match.""She just keeps ... raising her level in key moments of the match when she needs to, and I feel like that was the big difference today and the last few times I have played her,"" Pegula added.Despite the loss, Pegula expressed satisfaction with her tournament performance: ""Happy to be in another big 1000 final and having consistent results and keep going deep in tournaments. The reason we play is to put ourselves in good chances to win these events. I was able to do that the last couple weeks.""At 26, Sabalenka has accumulated 19 WTA Tour titles, with 17 on hard courts, including three Grand Slam singles titles - the 2023 Australian Open, 2024 Australian Open, and 2024 US Open.Sabalenka's on-court demeanour has evolved from her earlier years, showing more composure during challenging moments.""I think before, every time I would lose my serve, one game, I could just completely lose the match because I would still be thinking about that first game,"" she reflected.Sabalenka credited her past serving challenges for developing a stronger overall game and mental approach.""When I was struggling with my serve I had to push myself on the return and had to play with something else. So now, every time I am losing (serve) I know that I have weapons, that I can return well and that I can break back,"" she said.""I think that challenge really helped me to be more focused and not get too crazy on court after losing a game on my serve,"" she added.The Miami Open men's final is scheduled for Sunday, featuring Novak Djokovic against Czech teenager Jakub Mensik, with Djokovic pursuing his 100th professional title.","Aryna Sabalenka beats Jessica Pegula 7-5 6-2 in the final of the Miami Open.

Football superstar and Argentina's World Cup-winning captain Lionel Messi was in attendance at the Hard Rock Stadium on Friday, where Novak Djokovic advanced to the Miami Open final with a commanding victory over 14th-seeded Grigor DimitrovIn pursuit of his 100th singles title, and seventh in Miami, Djokovic won 6-2, 6-3 and will face upstart Jakub Mensik, who upset Taylor Fritz 7-6 (7-4), 4-6, 7-6 (7-4) in the other semfinial, for the title.During his post-match court interview, Djokovic recognised that Messi, who currently represents Inter Miami in Major League Soccer, was present, referring to him as ""King Leo.""Djokovic revealed that Messi, accompanied by his wife and children, visited the locker room where they exchanged presents. While Djokovic had previously attended Messi's matches, this marked the first occasion where the football star watched him play.""Obviously, it's a thrill to have his whole family,'' Djokovic said. ""It's a huge honour. He's such a great athlete, not just a football player. His impact on the world of sports in the last 20 years has been immense.""To have him watch me live brings me great joy and excitement and also a little pressure. It's definitely different when he brings his family. I was touched by that.""The 37-year-old Djokovic's performance hasn't been up to his lofty standards, beginning with a withdrawal due to injury at the Australian Open in January. At Indian Wells earlier this month, he suffered a first-round defeat against Botic van de Zandschulp.During the third game, play was halted when security personnel escorted a disruptive spectator from the venue. The chair umpire descended from his position and approached the stands while summoning security staff.Dimitrov engaged in a verbal exchange with the spectator and proceeded to direct the umpire's attention to the location of the troublesome fan at the sideline.""It's just heckling, it's fine,'' Dimitrov said. ""I'm a very calm guy overall. I don't pick any fights but don't trigger me.''Despite Dimitrov securing an early break against Djokovic in the opening game, the Serbian regained composure and secured the first set in 32 minutes.The current men's record holder of 24 Grand Slam titles displayed remarkable serving efficiency, landing 87% of first serves with merely six misses throughout the match. He maintained exceptional control, recording only five unforced errors during the 70-minute contest.""Now I know how it feels to be (John) Isner and (Reilly) Opelka,'' Djokovic said of two serving behemoths. ""Maybe my serve has been a bit underrated.""Djokovic extended his dominant head-to-head record against Dimitrov to 13-1. The Bulgarian player showcased his finest performance during the match.""He wears confidence like a stain on your shirt,'' Dimitrov said. ""It's beautiful to see. Only a few athletes on earth possess that quality.''Mensik, who entered the Miami Open as world number 54, has yet to reach a final in an ATP 1,000-point tournament.In a crucial moment against Fritz, he displayed remarkable composure at 4-4 in the final tiebreaker, securing victory by winning three consecutive points.Throughout the match lasting two hours and 25 minutes, Mensik failed to break serve but managed to win with a brilliant backhand winner down the line at 5-4. Fritz subsequently lost the next two points, sending a forehand long after a 20-shot exchange and netting a forehand on match point.Prior to the match, Mensik had a handshake with Messi. ""I didn't wash my hands before I stepped on the court,"" Mensik said.Tennis inspiration came to Mensik through Djokovic, whom he faced in a three-set match at the Shanghai Masters last October. The age difference between them stands at 18 years.","Novak Djokovic beats Grigor Dimitrov 6-2, 6-3 to reach Miami Open final.

CHENNAI: Sankar Muthusamy recorded the biggest win of his nascent career yet, defeating World No. 2 Anders Antonsen of Denmark 18-21, 21-12, 21-5 in the Swiss Open men’s singles pre-quarterfinals in Basel late on Thursday.What surprised many was the way in which the Indian dominated the deciding game. Despite losing the opener, the 21-year-old did not give up and pushed the match to the decider. He was helped by a flurry of unforced errors that Antonsen committed — the Dane hitting the shuttle wide and long on multiple occasions. Sankar made the most of the opportunity and succeeded.The Chennai lad entered the tournament as a qualifier and registered two wins to enter the main draw.“It feels good, and I have been doing well in this tournament. The first game (against Antonsen) lasted for close to 30 minutes and I feel that he became tired after that. I was able to score points from long rallies and capitalised on the situation. I was focusing on one point at a time and did not think much about the result,” Sankar, ranked 64th, told TOI from Basel.“In the deciding game, I was just expecting him to come back at me and was ready to handle the situation. My aim was to move him around the court and make him tired.”Sankar, who was a former junior World No. 1, lacked consistency in the 2024 season due to various reasons. However, he started the 2025 season on a bright note, reaching the quarterfinals of the Thailand Masters. He was later down with fever and could not give his best in the next few tournaments. However, Sankar recovered well ahead of the Swiss Open.The youngster, who is known for his defensive play, has improved his attacking skills and stroke-making.“My strokes have become sharper than usual, and I am able to finish off points from the rear court. My power is gradually increasing, and I am working on it. There is still a long way to go,” he said.Sankar’s long-time coach Aravindan Samiappan said that the win has come at the right time for his ward.“The moment has not sunk in properly. Sankar was an underdog and had nothing to lose. Our plan was to stay neck-to-neck on points and towards the end anything could have happened. But none would have expected such a scoreline in the decider. It was a bit shocking but that happens sometimes,” Aravindan said.The coach feels that opponents can no longer come prepared for Sankar, as he lends unpredictability into his game now.“Sankar can vary the pace of the match whenever required, and this was not the case one and a half years ago. Players could anticipate what he was going to do, as he played at a single pace.

A day after dethroning reigning champion Jonatan Christie , Lakshya Sen faltered against Li Shi Feng of China 10-21, 16-21 in the men’s singles quarterfinals of the All England Championships in Birmingham on Friday.Soon after, the Indian challenge ended as the women’s doubles pair of Treesa Jolly and Gayatri Gopichand lost to Chinese second seeds Liu Sheng Shu and Tan Ning 14-21, 10-21.Given his 7-4 win-loss record and having won the last two matches against Li last year, Lakshya was expected to fare well in the quarterfinals. But the Indian was a pale shadow of the shuttler on show against Christie.From 4-4, Li widened the gap. He scored eight points on the trot and Lakshya was out of the first game even before he had warmed up.Emboldened by the easy victory in the first game, Li started on an aggressive note while Lakshya crawled his way back. With good netplay and by pushing the shuttle to the corners with good effect, Lakshya secured a crucial three-point lead (11-8) at the halfway stage. However, Li toned down his aggression and scored the next four points by engaging the Indian in long rallies, mostly close to the net. It was anybody’s game till 15-15.Thereafter, Li came up with two smash winners and a lucky net drop to widen the gap to 19-15.

NEW DELHI: India's Lakshya Sen exited the All England Badminton Championships following a straight-game defeat to Chinese world No. 6 Li Shi Feng in the men's singles quarterfinals on Friday. The 2022 finalist, who narrowly missed an Olympic medal in Paris last year, was outplayed 10-21, 16-21 in a 45-minute encounter.Ranked world No. 15, Sen had won his last two encounters against Li, including at the Thomas Cup. However, this time, he struggled against his familiar Chinese rival from the junior class of 2018.Feng dominated early, wrapping up the first game in just 17 minutes. Playing with composure and avoiding unnecessary risks, he surged to a 9-4 lead with a powerful smash and entered the break with an 11-4 advantage. Sen's unsuccessful review left him trailing 4-12, but a brief resurgence saw him reduce the deficit to 7-12 with a sharp cross-court smash. Yet, Feng quickly adjusted, mixing up his pace and tactics to clinch the game.Sen showed improvement in the second game but couldn't match Feng's consistency. Trailing 2-5 initially, Sen fought back with better net play, taking a 10-8 lead after a grueling 37-shot rally. He maintained a slender three-point lead at the break and fought hard in a tight contest, with a marathon 44-shot exchange tying the score at 14-all. However, Feng's aggression proved decisive as he surged ahead 17-15 with a powerful smash.At 15-18, Sen suffered finger bruises, spilling blood on the court and requiring medical attention, leading to a brief stoppage. However, the break did little to disrupt Feng's momentum as he sealed the match with another thunderous smash.Despite the loss, Sen's campaign was commendable, highlighted by his stunning straight-game victory over defending champion Jonatan Christie, avenging his semifinal defeat to the Indonesian last year.With this win, Feng advances to the semifinals to face the winner between top seed Shi Yu Qi and Singapore's Loh Kean Yew.Meanwhile, India's doubles duo Satwiksairaj Rankireddy and Chirag Shetty withdrew due to injury, Malvika Bansod bowed out in women's singles, and the mixed doubles pair of Rohan Kapoor and Ruthvika Shivani Gadde also fell short.","Lakshya Sen loses 10-21, 16-21 to Chinese world No. 6 Li Shi Feng.

4th T20I: Time for India to change combination against England?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/england-tour-of-india-2025/4th-t20i-time-for-india-to-change-combination-against-england/articleshow/117766009.cms,"Tweaking a spin-heavy combination and being more guarded in powerplay could be the way forward for India in Pune

PUNE: Mohammed Shami's international comeback in the last match, the availability of middle-order batter Rinku Singh and conditions at Gahunje stadium will play a role as India look to play their best playing XI to seal the T20 series against England. Suryakumar Yadav 's team, leading 2-1, play Jos Buttler's men in the fourth match at Gahunje stadium on Friday night. The hosts had a chance to clinch the series in Rajkot but fumbled in a chase of 172 runs - widely viewed as a sub-par target - on Tuesday.The team had to rest left arm pacer Arshdeep Singh in that contest to make way for Shami. For, they stuck to the idea of playing four spinners - left-armer Axar Patel, offie Washington Sundar and leggies Varun Chakravarthy and Ravi Bishnoi. However, the pitch for this match is not doctored to assist spinners like it was for the October's Test against New Zealand. Hence, not resting Shami, but bringing in Arshdeep and Rinku in place of Sundar/Bishnoi and Dhruv Jurel respectively may make sense.Rinku missed the second and third games due to lower back spasms, but he was available for selection when Team India practised on Thursday evening. England chose not to train.Regardless of India's spin combination, the faceoff between tweakers from the hosts and England leggie Adil Rashid will be a nice sub-plot to the contest.Bishnoi has leaked 95 runs in 12 overs for one wicket in the series. He was taken to the cleaners in the last match with two fours and five sixes. And England batters are perfectly capable of repeating the act. Though the pitch is expected to offer some assistance to the bowlers, it is unlikely to play tricks. Still, India cannot take visiting pacers - led by Jofra Archer - lightly.England had managed to choke India and stop them from hitting boundaries for 43 balls in the middle overs in the last match. And coach Gautam Gambhir may have taken serious note of that.Hardik Pandya has enjoyed the status of being one of the most valued members of the team since he offers a rare all-round fare - aggressive batting and pace bowling. But his ability to maintain strike rate, especially if he comes into bat before the 10th over has come under the scanner.How to use your resources optimally is a bigger task for captains in T20 than in other forms of the game. Jurel, playing as a specialist batter, came in quite late in the last game. Axar was under bowled and Washington Sundar's one over (15 runs) was quite costly.England can take credit for handing the reigning T20 World Champions a rare defeat - only their third in the last 31 games. And their aggressive brand of cricket means they are perfectly capable of taking the series to the decider in Mumbai on Sunday. But since the format offers their batters a license to kill, they can also shoot themselves in the foot.The retirement of Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli from T20Is, has opened the big door for Sanju Samson, Abhishek Sharma and Tilak Varma to establish themselves at the top of the order. And if they survive the initial spell and boundary-hitting temptation in the powerplay, they can make a big impact.","Mohammed Shami's international comeback and availability of middle-order batter Rinku Singh will play a role as India look to play their best playing XI to seal the T20 series against England.

Joburg Super Kings ' (JSK) captain Faf du Plessis spearheaded his team's seven-wicket win over Paar Royals on Thursday with a sublime half-century, which kept them alive in the race to the playoffs.Du Plessis's 87 off 55 balls, including 7 sixes and 4 fours, never allowed the Royals a chance after they had put up a modest 150 for 9 on the board.The victory put JSK level with Sunrisers Eastern Cape (SEC) on 19 points, though they remain at the fourth spot, behind SEC on bonus-point count.JSK's opening partnership laid the foundation of the win as Du Plessis and Devon Conway (20 off 25 balls) put up a valuable 54-run stand for the first wicket, which was broken by Mujeeb Ur Rehman when he dismissed Convoy.Keith Dudgeon got the wicket of du Plessis, but by then the JSK chase had reached 130 and the writing was on the wall for the Royals.Leus du Plooy (18*) and Jonny Bairstow (8*) then took the Super Kings home in 17.5 overs.Earlier, the Royals suffered an early setback when Sam Hain (2), who replaced the rested Joe Root, was dismissed on the second delivery of their innings by Donovan Ferreira who registered figures of 3 for 23.The equally effective Lutho Sipamla (3 for 19) continued to shine, taking his tournament tally to 11 wickets.Despite Lhuan-dre Pretorius (19 of 11 balls) and Rubin Hermann (28 off 26 balls) making brief contributions, it was Dinesh Kartik who stood tall for the Royals , scoring his first SA20 fifty with 53 off 39 balls.The Royals were also without skipper David Miller, who is at home with his family following the birth of his child.Paarl Royals have already secured their spot in Qualifier 1, where they will face MI Cape Town Gqeberha on February 4.SEC, JSK, and Pretoria Capitals are competing for the remaining two playoff positions.","Joburg Super Kings (JSK) beat Paar Royals by seven wickets.

PCB to have an event in Lahore

NEW DELHI: The 2025 edition of the Champions Trophy will not have a pre-tournament captains photo-op due to different arrival schedules of participating teams. It is reliably understood that there are a lot of hurdles in getting all captains together before the tournament gets underway as even England and Australia will be reaching Pakistan late due to their ongoing international assignments.The development means there is no need for India captain Rohit Sharma to travel to Pakistan and he can stay with the Indian team in Dubai - where they play the three group matches and also the knockouts if they qualify.It is learnt that the Indian team is likely to leave for Dubai on February 15 and more clarity on the departure schedule is expected in the coming days.Rohit Sharma and Co. will be camped in Dubai and are unlikely to play a warm-up game before their opening game vs Bangladesh on February 20. Various options were explored but since most teams will be in Pakistan for their matches, it was difficult arranging a fixture.It is further understood that the Indian camp is okay with quality net sessions as they are scheduled to play three ODIs vs England before starting their Champions Trophy campaign.The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has planned an event in Lahore ahead of the Champions Trophy. There were discussions of having it in Karachi but it has now been moved to Lahore. It is learnt that opening ceremonies/events are carried out by host nations and Pakistan have decided to have it in Lahore.The venues in Pakistan are yet to be handed over to the global cricket body but PCB are confident to finish the work in the coming week. The multi-nation tournament gets underway on February 19 and the final will happen on March 9.If India qualify for semi-final, they will play that fixture in Dubai only and even the final will be moved there if India make it to the title clash.",The 2025 edition of the Champions Trophy will not have a pre-tournament captains photo-op due to different arrival schedules of participating teams.

The Sharjah Warriorz took a massive step towards the ILT20 playoffs as they jumped from sixth to third spot after their four-wicket win over Abu Dhabi Knight Riders (ADKR) in Sharjah on Thursday, championed by Adam Zampa and Adam Milne's spirited show with the ball and Johnson Charles 's half-century.In pursuit of 162, the Warriorz started brilliantly as Charles and Tom Kohler-Cadmore launched attacked from the word go, putting together a 66-run partnership that set up the stage perfectly.During the fourth over, the pair hammered Ibrar Ahmad for 24 runs. Vijayakanth Viyaskanth eventually broke through, dismissing Kohler-Cadmore who was caught in the deep, having scored 39 runs off 21 balls.Charles continued to dominate the innings, taking on all the bowlers, while Rohan Mustafa played a supporting role.Mustafa's innings was cut short by Sunil Narine after he had scord just five runs, causing a temporary dip in scoring rate, but Charles maintained his aggressive approach.A lifeline was given to Charles in the 11th over when he was dropped, allowing him to reach his fifty. The following over saw another fielding lapse when Roston Chase failed to hold onto an edge from Jason Roy's bat.Charles appeared poised for a big knock but was dismissed by Narine after a decisive innings of 65 of 35 balls. Roy's departure for 15 followed shortly when Jason Holder delivered a wicket maiden in the 16th over.The Warriorz suffered a collapse as Tim Seifert (10) and Ethan D'Souza (1) were dismissed in quick succession, losing three wickets while adding merely two runs. Despite their earlier dominance, they found themselves in a challenging position at 148 for6, requiring 14 runs from 16 deliveries.However, Ashton Agar's calculated assault (12* off 10), comprising a six and a four, effectively managed the pressure situation and steered the Warriorz home.Earlier, Milne provided the Sharjah Warriorz with an excellent beginning by striking early to leave the Knight Riders struggling at 29 for 2.Andries Gous was dismissed for a golden duck and Joe Clarke was sent back for 15 after smashing Milne for three successive boundaries.Chase navigated through some precarious moments before establishing a crucial 58-run partnership with Kyle Mayers for the third wicket. However, Zampa secured a breakthrough when Chase departed after scoring a quick 33.Mayers took control of the Knight Riders' innings, reaching his half-century in just 29 balls. Just when it appeared he would guide his team to a substantial total, Zampa struck again, claiming the crucial wicket of the West Indian for 56.When Milne (3 for 33) returned to bowl in the 15th over, he immediately dismissed Narine (2). Subsequently, Zampa (3 for 27) outwitted Andre Russell, who managed only three runs, as both Warriorz bowlers enjoyed significant success.In the closing stages, Holder (26 off 17) played an impactful innings, particularly targeting Tim Southee (0 for 39) in the 19th over where he scored 17 runs, helping the Knight Riders achieve a competitive total of 161 for 8.",Sharjah Warriorz beat Abu Dhabi Knight Riders by four wickets. Adam Zampa and Adam Milne took three wickets each for the Warriorz. Johnson Charles scored 65 of 35 balls in Sharjah's chase of 162. Ashton Agar (12* off 10) steered Sharjah home with six balls to spare.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117763311,imgsize-51500,width-400,resizemode-4/117763311.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Paris Olympics bronze medallist Aman Sehrawat will not be able to defend his men's 57kg category title at the forthcoming Zagreb Open ranking series tournament next week, as the Wrestling Federation of India ( WFI ) failed to secure requisite clearance for the event from the sports ministry due to its inexplicable suspension since Dec 2023.And it's not solely Sehrawat who has been denied the opportunity to compete at the season's first ranking series meet, which carries vital ranking points for seedings at the senior World wrestling championships, scheduled to be held later this year.Other Indian men and women freestyle and greco-roman wrestlers, too, have been compelled to forgo yet another prestigious championship because the ministry has declined to grant affiliation to an elected body in WFI, which has the recognition from the sport's world governing body – UWW . Sanjay Singh was duly elected the WFI president more than a year back after decisively defeating govt-backed candidate Anita Sheoran .According to sources, the WFI waited for the ministry's authorisation for the Feb 5-9 event in Croatia's capital despite submitting entries to the organisers well in advance, as well as reminding the Sports Authority of India (SAI) about the same on multiple occasions. However, the clearance hadn't materialised as of Thursday evening.""The trip to Zagreb has been called off. There's no time remaining to process anything. You have a weekend approaching (Feb 1-2) and the Croatian embassy in Delhi will be closed. The wrestlers were scheduled to depart on Monday evening for the event commencing on Wednesday. You cannot arrange everything in just one day (Friday, Jan 31). The team's participation has been withdrawn since the federation hasn't received confirmation from the SAI. The wrestlers have been notified about this,"" a WFI official said.Earlier, too, the wrestlers had missed participating in two important invitational tournaments in Belarus and Egypt in Nov-Dec last year after the SAI refused to clear the teams owing to the WFI's continued derecognition.",Aman Sehrawat will not be able to defend his men's 57kg category title at the forthcoming Zagreb Open ranking series tournament next week.

Cricket fans in India are set for a spectacular journey down memory lane when some of the biggest cricketers, once rivals, will return to action. The International Masters League ( IML ) has unveiled the schedule for the highly-anticipated inaugural season, which will feature six teams – India, Australia, England, South Africa, Sri Lanka and the West Indies.The opening match, scheduled for February 22, 2025, will witness a clash between India and Sri Lanka. Master Blaster Sachin Tendulkar will lead the Indian team against a Sri Lankan side captained by Kumar Sangakkara , one of Sri Lanka’s most successful captains.""The IML will be a celebration of cricket’s unique and enduring legacy. I can’t wait to step back onto the field with my contemporaries in a league that will be intense and competitive, with all the teams playing hard, but fair”, Tendulkar, captain of the Indian team, said.""The IML is a tribute to cricket’s timeless charm. It is a wonderful opportunity for former cricketers. It's a platform where they can relive old rivalries and reconnect with fans. I am excited to participate in this historic league alongside so many illustrious names"", said Sangakkara, the captain of the Sri Lankan team.The IML will be played across three cities - Navi Mumbai, Rajkot, Raipur. The first five matches will take place in Navi Mumbai followed by six games in Rajkot. Raipur will have the luxury of hosting seven games including the semi-finals and final.“We are thrilled and honoured to partner with JioStar for the IML.

Challengers standings: Thai Dai van Nguyen (7.5), Erwin l'Ami (7.0), Aydin Suleymanli (6.5), Benjamin Bok (6.5), Frederik Svane (6.0), Miaoyi (5.5), Ediz Gurel (5.5), Kazybek Nogerbek (5.5), Nodirbek Yakubboev (5.0), Vaishali (5.0), Arthur Pijpers (4.5), Faustino Oro (2.5), Divya Deshmukh (2.0), Irina Bulmaga (1.0).

NEW DELHI: Following one of the most highly anticipated clashes of Round 10, India’s Gukesh Dommaraju maintained his lead at the top of the Masters leaderboard at the 2025 Tata Steel Chess Tournament , defeating Dutchman Max Warmerdam on his home soil in Wijk aan Zee on Wednesday.Defending with the black pieces, Gukesh responded to the King’s Pawn Opening with an out-of-the-box Pirc Defense. Showing early aggression, the youngest-ever World Chess Champion captured Warmerdam’s first piece, the Queen’s Pawn, with Cxd4.With the Chennai-born grandmaster maintaining his aggressive stance, continued pressure from his pieces ultimately provoked a blunder from the 24-year-old Dutchman.As Gukesh captured Warmerdam’s rook with Qxc8 on move 27, Warmerdam, in a desperate attempt to attack Gukesh’s queen, played Rc1.The advantage was now entirely in Gukesh’s hands, and he capitalised immediately, playing Nxg3 on move 30. With no escape from the mounting pressure, Warmerdam resigned, sealing Gukesh’s second consecutive win in the 87th edition of the ""Wimbledon of Chess"".The game between Slovenia’s Vladimir Fedoseev and Praggnanandhaa Rameshbabu was another thriller. One of the tournament’s most formidable, in-form players, Fedoseev had already defeated Arjun Erigaisi, Fabiano Caruana, Vincent Keymer, and Pentala Harikrishna, suffering only one loss — to Alexey Sarana — before facing Praggnanandhaa in this Round 10 matchup.An unconventional Tarrasch Defense with the Two Knights Variation saw Fedoseev, defending with black, deploy his pieces in an early offence.However, as he concentrated on stacking up his pieces on the left side of the board, Praggnanandhaa remained composed, refraining from an overzealous push and ensuring he retained the upper hand.With the queens traded off by move 36, Praggnanandhaa delivered a decisive rook check before successfully promoting his d8 pawn to a queen.With that, the game was effectively over, giving the Indian grandmaster a much-needed victory after his crushing defeat to Dutch No. 1 Anish Giri on Tuesday.Elsewhere, Arjun Erigaisi mounted a recovery from the poor start to the tournament with a much-needed draw against Germany’s Vincent Keymer, while last year’s Challengers winner, Leon Luke Mendonca, held off Giri in a 30-move battle.Meanwhile, Nodirbek Abdusattorov, Gukesh’s closest rival in the standings, secured a crucial win over Alexey Sarana with the white pieces. Pentala Harikrishna and Fabiano Caruana, after a gruelling 68-move duel, agreed to a draw.ALSO SEE: Tata Steel Chess 2025 Schedule In the Challengers section, it was a tough day for the Indian contingent as Vaishali Rameshbabu and Divya Deshmukh both suffered defeats, losing to table-topper Thai Dai Van Nguyen and Frederik Svane, respectively. With Thursday being reserved as a rest day, both Vaishali and Divya will be looking to make a strong comeback for the final stretch of the 13-round-long tournament.39-year-old Erwin l’Ami edged past 11-year-old Argentine sensation Faustino Oro in a hard-fought game, while China's 14-year-old Lu Miaoyi played to a draw against Türkiye’s formidable Ediz Gurel.ALSO READ: India to host FIDE Chess World Cup 2025; Arjuna Awardee 'surprised' at the move",India’s Gukesh Dommaraju maintained his lead at the top of the Masters leaderboard at the 2025 Tata Steel Chess Tournament.

NEW DELHI: India seamer Shardul Thakur took a hat-trick for Mumbai against Meghalaya in a crucial Ranji Trophy encounter at the Sharad Pawar Cricket Academy in Mumbai on Thursday.As Mumbai bowled first against Meghalaya, Thakur opened the bowling and removed Anirudh B, Sumit Kumar, and Jaskirat in the third over before dismissing Nishant Chakraborty on the fourth ball of the innings.In the 2024-25 Ranji Trophy season, he became the second bowler to take a hat-trick, following Rishi Dhawan of Himachal Pradesh against Pondicherry.The 33-year-old also became the fifth Mumbai bowler in Ranji Trophy history to seal a hat-trick.The other four bowlers are Royston Harold Dias (Mumbai) against Bihar in the 2023-2024 season, Abdul Moosabhoy Ismail (Bombay) against Saurashtra in 1973-74, Umesh Narayan Kulkarni (Bombay) against Gujarat in 1963-64, and Jehangir Behramji Khot (Bombay) against Baroda in 1943-44.Thakur has taken 20 wickets and amassed 297 runs in seven games so far this season, including two fifties and a century.Also See: ICC Champions Trophy 2025 Meghalaya, who were 2/6 at one stage, were reduced to 29/6 in 12 overs thanks to Thakur's 4-14 and two wickets from Mohit Avasthi.Mumbai bowled out Meghalaya for 86 runs.Mumbai, currently ranked third in Group A, needs to win the current game by an innings or ten wickets in order to earn the extra point. With Baroda in second place with 27 points, that will tie them with J&K at 29 points.Mumbai would be hopeful that neither J&K nor Baroda wins more than one point in their match in the Vadodara final round.","Shardul Thakur took a hat-trick for Mumbai against Meghalaya.

NEW DELHI: Upendra Yadav played a defiant knock of 95 to steer Railways to 241 on Day 1 of their Ranji Trophy clash against Delhi, a game marked by Virat Kohli ’s much-anticipated return to domestic red-ball cricket after 13 years.Delhi's pace trio — Navdeep Saini , Siddhant Sharma, and Money Grewal — made early inroads, reducing Railways to 66 for five in the first session by exploiting the morning conditions. However, Upendra, along with veteran spinner Karn Sharma (50 off 105), stitched a crucial 104-run stand for the sixth wicket, stabilising the innings.Kohli’s presence added an extra spark to the contest, energising both teams and drawing an unprecedented Ranji Trophy crowd of over 15,000 spectators.Upendra was on course for his third century of the season but fell late in the day, mistiming an aerial stroke off left-arm spinner Sumit Mathur to be caught at long-off. Before his dismissal, he had confidently pulled a couple of deliveries into the 90s, accumulating 10 fours and a six in his innings.Karn Sharma and Upendra’s partnership frustrated Delhi as the pitch eased out post-lunch. Delhi skipper Ayush Badoni, primarily a batter, remained his team’s leading wicket-taker for the season with his off-spin, highlighting the side’s bowling struggles.While Grewal impressed in the morning, Saini showcased his persistence in the afternoon session, breaking the crucial sixth-wicket stand in the 53rd over.He dismissed Karn Sharma, caught at fine leg after a rash slog, and trapped Ayan Chaudhari lbw on the very next delivery, swinging momentum back in Delhi’s favor before tea, leaving Railways at 182 for seven. Saini had earlier bowled opener Vivek Singh with a sharp, seaming delivery.Left-arm spinner Mathur cleaned up the tail, drawing cheers from the crowd, which was eagerly waiting for Kohli’s turn to bat.Saini and Grewal bowled 18 and 17 overs, respectively, while Siddhant Sharma was used sparingly with just nine overs.Kohli’s intensity remained high throughout, whether stationed at second slip for the pacers or moving to cover. He frequently engaged with the crowd, keeping the energy levels up. Briefly leaving the field twice, he returned to thunderous applause each time.With the anticipation building, the biggest moment will come on Friday when Kohli walks out to bat. At stumps, Delhi stood at 41 for one in 10 overs.","Upendra Yadav scores 95 to steer Railways to 241 on Day 1 of their Ranji Trophy clash against Delhi.

NEW DELHI: The unmatched aura of Virat Kohli was on full display at the Arun Jaitley Stadium as thousands of fans turned up for Delhi’s Ranji Trophy clash against Railways on Thursday, creating a surreal atmosphere rarely seen in domestic cricket.The excitement, however, reached a boiling point when an overzealous fan breached security, ran onto the field, and touched Kohli’s feet before being whisked away by officials.The incident occurred in the 12th over of Railways’ innings, when Kohli was stationed at second slip.As the fan sprinted towards him, the crowd erupted in cheers.

The dramatic moment summed up the fervor surrounding Kohli’s first domestic red-ball appearance in over 12 years.The Delhi & District Cricket Association (DDCA) had anticipated around 10,000 fans for Kohli’s return, an extraordinary number for a Ranji Trophy fixture. However, as the morning progressed, it became clear that the projections had fallen short.The officials have later confirmed that more than 15,000 fans are watching the match in the stadium.Despite the electrifying atmosphere, Delhi’s bowlers kept their focus, reducing Railways to 66/5. Siddhant Sharma and Money Grewal claimed two wickets each early in the morning session.

Match ends in thrilling draw

NEW DELHI: Run-outs are often game-changers in cricket, capable of shifting momentum in an instant. But in a rare and unlucky turn of events, England U19 batter Aaryan Sawant suffered one of the most bizarre dismissals in recent memory during the first unofficial Test against South Africa U19 in Stellenbosch.Sawant, batting on 11 with England at 106/2 in their second innings, was facing left-arm spinner Jason Rowles. Attempting a sweep shot, he directed the ball towards short-leg fielder Jorich Van Schalkwyk. In a freakish sequence, the ball ricocheted off Van Schalkwyk’s helmet and crashed into the stumps while Sawant was out of his crease. The South African players immediately erupted in celebration, while Van Schalkwyk remained on the ground in pain from the impact, requiring medical attention.The incident left commentators in disbelief, with one remarking, ""When you think you've seen everything in cricket..."" - a sentiment echoed across social media as the video of the dismissal quickly went viral.The match itself was a gripping contest, ending in a nail-biting draw as South Africa finished at 295/9, just 22 runs short of the 317-run target set by England.Also See: ICC Champions Trophy 2025 England had posted 299 in their first innings before South Africa took a slender 20-run lead with 319. In their second innings, England declared at 336/9, setting up a challenging chase for the hosts. Despite the unusual run-out, the game remained evenly poised until the final ball, with England needing just one more wicket for victory.While the match ended without a winner, Sawant’s dismissal will be remembered as one of the unluckiest in cricket history, proving once again that the sport never ceases to surprise.","England U19 batter Aaryan Sawant suffered one of the most bizarre dismissals in recent memory during the first unofficial Test against South Africa U19 in Stellenbosch.

NEW DELHI: It was cold play, the old way. The Arun Jaitley Stadium (formerly Feroz Shah Kotla Stadium) heaved with excited fans who'd braved the early-morning nip in the air to be there.There was a group of youngsters, who'd started from Meerut at 4am. There were Greater Noida families with kids long having banished sleep from their eyes, who'd reached the venue as early as 7am -a full two-and-a-half hours before scheduled start of play.You could be forgiven for thinking they were there for an international match or even the IPL . In fact, they were there for just one man. Over 13,000 people, thronging the two stands thrown open for free on the first day of Virat Kohli 's first Ranji match in over 12 years.He didn't get to bat on Day 1, but even that did not dampen the crowd's enthusiasm. They loyally stayed on, cheering his every move.Seldom, in recent memory, has a sporting fixture in the Capital attracted such an instinctive, organic outpouring of crowds as happened on Thursday. Twelve years ago, on a bitterly cold January day, the great Sachin Tendulkar 's penultimate Ranji game, at the Palam Ground here, hardly drew a hundred and some yawns. This time, Central Delhi, that final district between a bygone world and the new one, was simply buzzing.On the first day of his first Ranji match in over 12 years, Kohli didn't get to bat. Yet the crowd was captivated by his mere presence and a few gestures throughout the day.An odd mix of hope and an anti-climactic sentiment hung in the air. Would Delhi bat first? The chatter was all Kohli. Despite the traffic restrictions for Gandhi's death anniversary, and VIP movement at Rajghat next door, the queues at the stadium gates from dawn is an apt measure for the pull Kohli manages to generate even at this late stage of his career.Meerut lads, bantering with the security men with their ropes, goading the guy ahead to get moving, told stories of how they left for the stadium at 4 am. Others spoke of their travel from the suburbs, this time no complaints against crushing everyday rush-hour. Navdeep Saini , a seasoned IPL and India player, was taken aback when he saw scores walking in a couple of hours before the start. The security, beefed up by Delhi Police and CRPF personnel, was forced to open the gates ahead of schedule.Once in, it was an impromptu carnival. Reels were made, selfies taken and the world was made aware of the enduring love of the home boy. A fan slipped into the field of play and scampered to the far end, to touch the feet of the man, fielding at second slip. This is not new, perhaps something Kohli is used to. The response was out of the ordinary. About 20 security personnel, in hot pursuit, sprinted on to the centre square to evict the fan before CRPF personnel marched in to take charge. Snap homage paid, order was restored.Seldom has a Ranji game garnered such interest, especially in Delhi and for Delhi, the team. Thursday unfolded into an event driven by Brand Virat Kohli. Besides Kohli, only four others in the XI have played in front of packed houses, there are none from the Railways team who would have experienced this nature of fandom.Such was the effect of his presence and the adulation that it inspired that you forgot to notice Railways' wicketkeeper Upendra Yadav 's classy 95 on a tricky pitch.The all-day chants of ""Kohli… Kohli"" hit the high notes in the last hour of the day after Railways were bowled out for 241. Because then, the home crowd began cheering the Railways bowlers to get the first two wickets quickly to make way for Kohli to take strike. The eagerness peaked when Delhi lost one of their openers with half an hour for stumps. As people thronged the fencing next to the dressing room where Kohli was padded up, amusingly desperate chants like ""Kohli bhai, please aa jao batting karne! (Kohli bro, please come out to bat)"" rent the air.Yadav later didn't mind conceding that the vociferous crowd overwhelmed his Railways team. ""It was overwhelming indeed. But as cricketers we are entertainers after all. We would want to play in front of so many people. I have seen what a packed house could feel like having been part of the Sunrisers Hyderabad squad. Today, I told my teammates to get inspired but not get carried away. It's tough, we need to stick to the basics,"" he said.It is evident that a match which would have been another domestic match played in anonymity received this heartwarming dose of adrenaline with Kohli 's participation. Saini put it humbly: ""Even for me, a player of such stature spurs you on. His active involvement in the game and energy is infectious. I can see our teammates putting in more effort on the field.""As if on encore, Friday promises to be another ""Kohli, Kohli!"" day. Be there.","Virat Kohli didn't get to bat on Day 1, but even that did not dampen the crowd's enthusiasm. The all-day chants of ""Kohli… Kohli"" hit the high notes in the last hour of the day after Railways were bowled out for 241.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117765354,imgsize-86156,width-400,resizemode-4/117765354.jpg"

Rinku Singh is fit and available for fourth T20I against England: Ryan ten Doeschate

Renowned for his 360-degree stroke play, Suryakumar Yadav is India's best T20I player, just as ICC Player of the Year 2024 Jasprit Bumrah is in Tests, according to former India batter Sanjay Manjrekar Surya's journey is one of the most inspiring in Indian cricket-making his national team debut at 30 and rising to become India's T20I captain in just three years.In the latest episode of Deep Point on Star Sports, experts Manjrekar and Sanjay Bangar delved into Surya's stature as India's top T20I batter and his potential as captain.Manjrekar strongly endorsed SKY as India's premier T20I batter, emphasising his meteoric rise from IPL standout to one of the finest players in the format today.""This has taken a lot of time; it didn't happen in just two years. He used to play for KKR (Kolkata Knight Riders), and I remember he had just two shots. Predictably, he would play the flick shot on the first ball of the innings, no matter where it landed. The growth of Suryakumar Yadav is incredible. Who would have predicted, when he was playing lower down the order for KKR, that he would go on to become the best T20I batter in the world?""Former India batting coach Bangar highlighted how the 34-year-old batter's exceptional skill is further elevated by his imagination and adaptability.""The method to this madness is proactiveness. It takes a lot of imagination, courage, and the ability to anticipate where the ball is coming from before it's even bowled-that's his hallmark,"" said Bangar.""During the Asia Cup, we analysed how, when bowlers try to adjust their deliveries after Surya gets into position, he still has another option to punish them. That’s his special ability. There are many players who can hit across 360 degrees, but his ability to abandon his plan and react to a delivery is amazing,"" he added.Commenting on Surya's captaincy, Bangar admitted he was surprised by Hardik Pandya 's exclusion but suggested that Surya could be the perfect leader for India's next generation of T20 talent.""Honestly, I was shocked that he was elevated to captain because, until that point, Hardik Pandya was the captain-designate. The way he handled that transition shows his great man-management skills. It's still early days, but he's the best fit for this young squad after the retirements of Jadeja, Kohli, and Rohit. That's a big plus - he can be the leader of this new generation, someone who is one among them,"" Bangar added.Under Suryakumar's captaincy, India have registered 16 wins and just four losses in T20Is. Manjrekar believes that Surya’s status as the team’s best player makes him the ideal choice to continue leading the side.""He has a great temperament. Throughout his career, you can see that after a strong innings, he always has a smile during his interviews. He's light-hearted. Just like Bumrah for India's Test captaincy, SKY is by far the best player on this T20I team,"" he said.Manjrekar also emphasised the importance of strong coaching support for Surya's captaincy.""In T20Is, if you have a great coach working alongside the captain, because you need outside inputs, I think he could be a great long-term leader. I'm very excited to see if he has any say in team selection because I’m looking forward to watching players like Abhishek Sharma and Sanju Samson, Rinku Singh making a comeback, and even Varun Chakravarthy getting a chance.""","Suryakumar Yadav is India's best T20I player, according to Sanjay Manjrekar and Sanjay Bangar. The 34-year-old made his national team debut at 30 and became captain in just three years.

However, their relief was short-lived as Dhekale joined Mhatre at the crease, and the duo unleashed a relentless assault, punishing the bowlers from both ends.Pacer Manish Waghmare struck a crucial double blow for Srinagar, breaking the Singams' momentum in the ninth over by dismissing both Ketan Mhatre and Sumeet Dhekale as they attempted big hits.

However, the day ended in disappointment for them after he didn't come out to bat as Delhi lost only one wicket, of opener Harshit Rana, in their 10 overs of batting with Yash Dhull and Sanat Sangwan ensuring no further damage against Railways.However, Virat will come out to bat on the second day if and when Delhi loses another wicket. But Railways' Upendra Yadav , who was the top scorer for his team, scoring 95, said that they have ""made plans"" for Kohli.""We had a discussion with our bowlers regarding him (Kohli) and we have made some plans for him, which I cannot tell right now,"" Upendra said while talking to the media after the day's play.""We have asked our bowlers to not get carried away, and bowl around the good-length area. A good bowl is as good for Virat bhaiya as it is for any other batter. If you bowl in good areas, you will get the results,"" Upendra added.Upendra missed his well-deserved hundred, which could have been his third of the season, by just 5 runs and lost his wicket while trying to hit a six over long-on to left-arm orthodox spinner, Sumit Mathur. When asked about his dismissal, Upendra said, ""I did not play it (the shot) because I was tired. I played it because I had confidence that I could clear the fielder.""Upendra, with his resolute defence and judicious stroke play, was at the forefront of Railways' recovery from 66-5 after Delhi's fast bowlers' early onslaught and built a 104-run partnership for the sixth wicket with Karn Sharma.Upendra was the highest scorer for the Railways (95 off 177 deliveries), followed by Karn Sharma (50 off 105), and helped his team reach a respectable total of 241.Earlier in the day, Kohli’s presence on the field led to an extraordinary turnout for a Ranji Trophy match, unlike anything seen in recent years.The Delhi and District Cricket Association ( DDCA ) had estimated a crowd of around 10,000 for Kohli’s much-anticipated homecoming — an unprecedented figure for a domestic fixture. However, his immense star power shattered those expectations.Even before play began at 9:30 am, thousands of fans were eagerly pushing to enter the stadium, where entry remains free for domestic matches. Initially, the DDCA opened the 6,000-capacity ‘Gautam Gambhir stand’ for spectators, but as the crowd kept swelling, officials had no choice but to open the ‘Bishan Singh Bedi stand,’ which can accommodate around 11,000 people.","Virat Kohli didn't come out to bat on the first day of the Ranji Trophy match between Railways and Delhi. But Railways' Upendra Yadav said that they have ""made plans"" for Kohli. Upendra was the highest scorer for the Railways (95 off 177 deliveries), followed by Karn Sharma (50 off 105), and helped his team reach a respectable total of 241.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117746684,imgsize-101112,width-400,resizemode-4/117746684.jpg"
Ranji Trophy: Karnataka let go of early advantage against Haryana,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/ranji-trophy-karnataka-let-go-of-early-advantage-against-haryana/articleshow/117743810.cms,"Mayank Agarwal. (PTI Photo)

BENGALURU: The equation for Karnataka was plain and simple when Haryana skipper Ankit Kumar called right at the toss and invited the home side to bat in their final Ranji Trophy league engagement at the M Chinnaswamy stadium. Karnataka needed a bevy of points to make it to the knockouts and they had to bat deep to have any chance of harvesting those points.The execution wasn't as firm as the plan. Karnataka's top order delivered mixed results while the middle-order didn't quite capitalise on a decent platform. At stumps, Karnataka were 267/5 in 89 overs, a score that would disappoint the home side but would cheer the visitors, especially since the wicket had eased considerably in the final session.Karnataka's lineup included three Test players - Mayank Agarwal (91), KL Rahul (26) and Devdutt Padikkal (43) - but a big score eluded the latter two. Agarwal in the company of KV Aneesh had begun adroitly but Haryana's bowlers were persistent without being flamboyant and that trait eventually paid off.The new-ball pair of Anshul Kamboj (2/25) and Ajit Chahal kept a tight line and got the length almost accurate although the first 20 overs were a toil amidst a defensive field setting. But just when Agarwal was opening up and finding the gaps, Kamboj's nagging persistence paid off as he knocked back Aneesh's middle stump.Embarrassingly, the crowd celebrated Aneesh's exit since it meant Rahul would walk out next. His stay didn't quite befit the welcome. Still Karnataka, at 88/1 at lunch, were in a fine position since their most experienced batters at the crease.Rahul was just settling into what looked like a promising innings, when a peach of a delivery from Kamboj, who induced a faint edge and was taken by wicketkeeper Rohit Sharma, ended the threatening partnership.Agarwal, who completed his half-century in the first over after lunch, found his mojo with the spinners coming on. The skipper stepped out, cut and drove assuredly, clobbering the seasoned Jayant Yadav into the stands twice while pasting Nishant Sindhu around the ground. Agarwal and Padikkal built a quick 84-ball 62 association, but that partnership too was nipped just when it was threatening to blossom.After a fine cover-driven boundary which took him into the 90s, Agarwal, who survived a close call off the first delivery of the day, looked to go after Anuj Thakral (2/74) but only holed out to Kamboj at deep point. At 161/3 and the top three back in the dressing room, the onus was on southpaws Padikkal and R Smaran (35). But the home team lost both batters against the run of play. Padikkal was the first to go, ending the 59-run association. With Thakral coming around the wicket, he misread the line and was caught plumb in front. Smaran followed with a Sindhu delivery turning in sharply to trap the previous match double centurion in the front.KL Shirjith and Yashovardhan Parantap did well to see off the remaining 23 overs with their patient unbeaten 139-ball 45.Karnataka made three changes to the line-up with Rahul and Vidwath Kaverappa coming in place of Abhinav Manohar and Abhilash Shetty. Leggie Shreyas Gopal, who is nursing a niggle, was replaced by Hardik Raj.",Mayank Agarwal (91) and KL Rahul (26) top scored for Karnataka. Karnataka were 267/5 in 89 overs at stumps. Haryana were bowled out for 267 in their final Ranji Trophy league match.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117743799,imgsize-33414,width-400,resizemode-4/117743799.jpg"

His exhilarating 146-run partnership with Khawaja wore down Sri Lanka’s bowling attack. Inglis celebrated his maiden Test hundred with sheer delight but fell in the very next over, caught at short cover off Prabath Jayasuriya.Khawaja, who batted for 352 balls and struck 16 fours and a six, reached his milestone with a single off Jayasuriya.

Former Manchester United captain Roy Keane has criticised Marcus Rashford , stating that the forward ""must be ashamed"" of his current situation under manager Ruben Amorim .The 27-year-old has not played for United in seven weeks, and Amorim has made it clear that Rashford ""has to change"" if he wants to have a future at Old Trafford. Despite training with the squad ahead of Thursday's Europa League match against Romanian side FCSB, Rashford was left out of the traveling squad.With the transfer window closing at 23:00 GMT on Monday, Rashford has been linked with a potential loan move to Barcelona, but time is running out to finalize a deal.Speaking on the Stick to Football podcast, Keane expressed his frustration over Rashford’s situation:""I can't get involved in the conversation, I still can't understand at any level. Whatever's going on with players leaving, months left on contracts, a player who doesn't train properly... I don't understand it.You might as well leave me out of this conversation. Especially if you think he wants to move, which is more of a reason to train properly so when you go to a new club you're up to speed and when you leave the club at least you showed a decent attitude. He must be ashamed.""Fellow United legend Wayne Rooney also shared his thoughts, recalling a recent visit to United’s Carrington training facility :""I went into Carrington on Sunday to take my kids to game day, and Marcus Rashford was out on the training pitch with the fitness coach, but he was right over towards where the parents were walking past for the kids' games.I looked at him thinking how embarrassing it must be for him as parents walk past.""Rooney admitted he had spoken to Rashford and advised him to leave Manchester United in order to revive his career:""I've spoken to Marcus a couple of times and I've given him my thoughts and feelings that he needs to leave the football club because whatever is going on in his life and at Manchester United, he's not the same. For him to have a fresh start, he needs to leave the club.""A product of United’s youth academy, Rashford has scored 138 goals in 426 appearances for the club, including seven goals in 24 games this season. However, a potential move remains complicated due to his reported £300,000-a-week ($374,000) contract, which runs until 2028.",Marcus Rashford has not played for Manchester United in seven weeks.

Manchester City led the way last season with 28 goals in their entire Champions League campaign, including knockout games.7: Liverpool's winning streak stopped at seven games with a 3-2 loss at PSV Eindhoven. That loss meant there were no unbeaten teams in the league phase. Six teams qualified unbeaten from their groups last season.23: The number of games won by a margin of four goals or more. Bayern Munich's 9-2 win over Dinamo Zagreb on the opening night set the tone as one-sided games were more common. Last year only four group games were won by four goals or more.

Clubs from Croatia, Czech Republic, Serbia, Slovakia and Ukraine all finished outside the top 24. Zagreb was closest in 25th but missed out on goal difference despite upsetting AC Milan 2-1.

Edited excerpts:

How do you do this balancing act of coaching club and country?

Everyone says the mentality of an Indian footballer is not the same as in other countries. Do you agree?

It's been five years for you in India, the longest time you have spent outside your home country. What has your experience been like?

Now that you are the coach of the national team, what changes do you want to implement?

In India, cricket is a religion, so how do you see football cross that barrier?

Manolo Marquez is the first foreigner to take up the dual role of coaching an Indian football club, FC Goa, and the national team. In a free-wheeling chat during Townhall With The Times of India, the Indian football team coach opens up on his first impressions of the country, adapting to the ""Indian way"" of getting things done, while discussing the way forward for the beautiful game.I didn't expect to share both jobs. The beginning was more difficult because the national team had games in Sept, Oct and Nov and FC Goa had a bad start. People talk, but I always say all this noise (and criticism) is why I get paid. About the dual role, it's not normal, but it's not the first time either.I always joke that one day I will write a book on India and the title will be 'The Indian Mentality'. There is a lot of talent, but they don't know how to show this talent. There is no consistency (in performances).When I arrived here, the players that were very good in the first season disappeared in the second. Players who were very bad in the previous season, did very good in the next. You need consistency. I miss this in Indian football.Looking at the chaos (during the Covid-19 pandemic) on the first day I arrived in Mumbai, I asked myself, 'what are you doing here?' Then I landed in Goa (to be inside the biosecure bubble for ISL ), got inside the car and was astonished with the driving. I told the driver, 'Wow, you can be an incredible winger, you surpassed cars, dogs, cows, people.' It was completely crazy. I wanted to leave after 10 minutes. It's my fifth season now. India is an incredible country.The national team, at this moment, is less important. You need to focus on the grassroots. There is Vision 2047 (by the AIFF ), but if you don't start work immediately (on the grassroots), it will be Vision 2097. You need to do something as soon as possible because the talent is there. If you see U-13, U-15, U-17 players in FC Goa, maybe you will be surprised. There are better, or the same, players here like in Spain.But the (development) process is completely different. Here the focus is on studies, and they cannot attend (regular) training sessions because they have exams constantly. Then there are (travel) distances. When people ask me when India will play at the World Cup, I tell them this is the last question (anyone should be asking). You need to start from the bottom.In my opinion, football will never surpass cricket in India. Never. But in a country of 1.4 billion, there is space for more than one sport. What I do hate is when I am told that ISL must finish before IPL starts. I know a million more people will watch IPL cricket than ISL, but that's okay, if (football) is the second sport. Keep going, don't change fixtures. This is something India needs to improve. Maybe I am from another culture, another mentality. Here, everything is organised at the last moment, and then it's changed. You need a proper schedule. Now I have learnt a lot to improvise. Do it the Indian way.","Manolo Marquez is the first foreigner to take up the dual role of coaching an Indian football club, FC Goa, and the national team.

Poll Is It Right For A Coach To File A FIFA Complaint Over Wages? No Yes

NEW DELHI: Andrey Chernyshov resigned as head coach of Mohammedan Sporting on Wednesday, citing unpaid wages going back three months. The Russian tactician, who guided Mohammedan Sporting to the I-League title last season, announced his departure with a post on social media.""My dear friends, fans of the club. Today is a very sad day for me. I am forced to step down as head coach of MSC and my contract has been terminated for failure to fulfil the terms by the club. Circumstances force me to make this difficult decision. This is the most difficult and sad decision in my coaching career,"" Chernyshov wrote on Instagram.""As a professional, I cannot work for 3 months without receiving a salary. I will not now talk about the difficulties that we, the players, coaches and staff had to overcome this season. I have never been afraid of difficulties and always came out to you and journalists when you wanted to talk to me. But this cannot continue. I made this decision with tears in my eyes. But all the blame for this lies with the club’s management, which did not fulfill the terms of the contract.""A senior official from Mohammedan Sporting SC told TimesofIndia.com, ""We received news from another source that Chernyshov had lodged a complaint with FIFA regarding the club’s financial situation and player wage issues without informing us. However, we have not received any official notice from FIFA regarding the matter.""It is believed that the club currently does not have any plans to appoint a new head coach. For the time being, assistant coach Mehrajuddin Wadoo will step in as the interim manager.Suggesting that a meeting with club shareholders, Bunkerhill and Shrachi Group, is yet to be held, the official further clarified, ""This coach was brought in by Bunkerhill. Shrachi Group and Mohammedan SC played no role in his hiring. Now, all stakeholders will convene to determine how to settle the coach’s pending dues.""TimesofIndia.com understands that the club management was displeased with Chernyshov’s handling of the financial crisis.While players refused to train due to unpaid wages, it is learned that Chernyshov opted to remain inside his room rather than encouraging the squad to take to the field.Playing their debut ISL season, Mohammedan Sporting have won only two matches and drawn five, currently sitting at the bottom of the league table.

Champions League fixtures (all to start at 1:30am IST):

The new league phase of this season's expanded UEFA Champions League is set for a frantic conclusion on Wednesday.18 matches will be played simultaneously across Europe and the likes of Manchester City and Paris Saint-Germain are the teams in focus as they battle to avoid an early exit.The top eight teams, in the 36-club format, will qualify automatically for the next stage in the competition. Meanwhile, the teams that finish between ninth to 24th in the standings will go into Friday's draw for the playoffs. There, the first legs will be played on February 11 and 12 and the return matches a week later.The teams that finish higher up in the standings will be rewarded by facing teams that finished further down the table in the playoffs. So, teams finishing ninth and 10th will face the side either in 23rd or 24th place, while 15th and 16th will face either 17th or 18th.In this revised format, teams from same country can be drawn together and there is a potential for teams that have already played this season to meet once again.Having said all that, plenty can change, or will change, on Wednesday, but based on the current points table PSG could play Lille in the playoffs, while Bayern or Real Madrid could play Juventus or Celtic.For the teams that finish in the top-eight places, there is the incentive of skipping the two-legged knockout round playoffs, getting some precious rest as they advance straight to the last-16 in March.Liverpool , with seven wins out of seven, and Barcelona are the only two teams to have already booked their place in the last-16.Arsenal, Inter Milan, Atletico Madrid, AC Milan, Atalanta and Bayer Leverkusen occupy the other six spots. That could change dramatically in this closely-contested new structure.Take this into consideration: Stuttgart, in 24th position, are only three points behind Bayer Leverkusen in eighth, with 15 sides in between them.Arsenal and Inter Milan need only draw away to Girona and at home to Monaco, respectively, in order to secure their last-16 spots.Only nine of the 36 teams come into the final matchday still fighting to secure qualification for the next phase, including former European Cup winners PSV Eindhoven and Benfica.Big names like defending champions Real Madrid, last season's runners-up Borussia Dortmund, Bayern Munich and Juventus are all hoping to avoid going into the playoffs. However, they are already guaranteed to at least be in February's playoff round.Meanwhile, the biggest name under threat of going out completely is Manchester City. The 2023 champions are currently languishing in 25th position, one place and two points outside the qualifying spots.Pep Guardiola's team were beaten 4-2 away at PSG last week and have taken a single point from their last four games in the competition.""Today we don't deserve it,"" Guardiola said when asked following the PSG defeat if the new format was fair.""What is the argument that it isn't fair? I said to the players to accept it and recover. We have to recover our game, that is what we have to do.""City, sitting in a challenging position, know a win in their last match - against Club Brugge at the Etihad Stadium - will take them through.PSG, who took a big swing at the European elite by beating City, eased their fears of being eliminated, although it could still happen. The Ligue 1 champions go to Stuttgart, where a draw will be enough to take both teams through.For many, especially the clubs who are still involved in domestic tournaments and have had packed calendars, avoiding the playoffs would be an objective as well.""The table does not lie. At the moment we aren't a top team. Top teams don't lose as many games. But we still have the feeling that we're in a process and on a good path,"" said Bayern's Joshua Kimmich after his team's 3-0 loss at Feyenoord last week.Liverpool, BarcelonaArsenal, Aston Villa, Atalanta, Atletico Madrid, Bayern Munich, Brest, Celtic, Borussia Dortmund, Feyenoord, Inter, Juventus, Bayer Leverkusen, Lille, AC Milan, Monaco, Real MadridNoneBologna, Red Star Belgrade, Girona, Leipzig, Salzburg, Slovan Bratislava, Sparta Prague, Sturm Graz, Young BoysSporting CP vs BolognaPSV vs LiverpoolYoung Boys vs Red Star BelgradeStuttgart vs PSGSturm Graz vs LeipzigManchester City vs Club BruggeBayern Munich vs Slovan BratislavaInter vs MonacoBorussia Dortmund vs Shakhtar DonetskBarcelona vs AtalantaBayer Leverkusen vs Sparta PragueJuventus vs BenficaDinamo Zagreb vs AC MilanSalsburg vs Atletico MadridLille vs FeyenoordAston Villa vs CelticGirona vs ArsenalBrest vs Real Madrid","18 matches will be played simultaneously across Europe on Wednesday.

Novak Djokovic v Alexander Zverev Highlights | Australian Open 2025 Semifinal

Rafael Nadal's uncle and former coach has joined others in questioning Novak Djokovic 's hamstring injury that led to his withdrawal from the Australian Open semi-final. Toni Nadal , who coached Rafael for almost 30 years, also addressed the crowd's reaction to Djokovic 's retirement.In his column for El Pais , Toni Nadal expressed concerns about Djokovic's decision to retire against Alexander Zverev without attempting a medical timeout during the match.The crowd at Rod Laver Arena , who had paid over $400 for tickets, responded with boos and jeers when Djokovic retired from the match.""I believe that a great champion like the Serbian, someone who has contributed to the most sublime pages in the history of tennis, should not leave any court in this way and, even less so Rod Laver Arena, where he holds the record for victories and titles,"" Nadal wrote.""Respect ... is well deserved in the difficult moment, leaving the court that has seen him win so many times. I understand that the public showed their disappointment and anger at being deprived of the expected spectacle after having paid an entrance fee for it.""Toni Nadal suggested that Djokovic's history of playing through injuries has been marked by theatrical displays.""Over the years, a certain suspicion has been fostered around Novak, due to his grimaces or histrionics, which has sown doubts about the veracity of his injuries,"" he stated.""Suspicions began in his quarter-final match against Carlos Alcaraz. After losing the first set, and with obvious gestures of pain, the Serbian made it clear to his opponent and the general public he would hardly be able to continue his match. But the reality was he not only faced the rest of the match with total normality, but he even ended up winning it. Against Zverev, he played the entire first set with apparent normality and without visible signs of pain until he decided to abandon it just after the German won the first set.""Following the match, Djokovic explained that he was ""upset"" about his worsening hamstring tear . He mentioned trying everything possible to manage the pain.Djokovic later shared an MRI image of his injured hamstring on social media to address skepticism about his condition.""When a player faces physical problems in a match of this nature, he normally waits until the end to decide to retire,"" Toni Nadal continued. ""He calls the physiotherapist, plays some games impaired and, only when he sees the inevitable fate, does he decide to retire. On more than one occasion we have seen Novak with similar performances, with facial gestures and body language that contradict what we are seeing on the court, and that sow certain doubts about the authenticity of his problems.""Australian Open tournament director Craig Tiley had revealed in 2023 that Djokovic had won his tenth Melbourne Park title while dealing with a 3cm hamstring tear. However, athletes and medical experts disputed this claim.Toni Nadal's coaching career includes guiding Rafael to numerous major victories, including 10 Roland-Garros titles, one Australian Open, two Wimbledon championships, three US Open titles, and an Olympic gold medal. Their partnership lasted until 2017. He later spent three years coaching Canadian player Félix Auger-Aliassime.","Novak Djokovic retired mid-way into his Australian Open 2025 semi-final match with injury.

NEW DELHI: For tennis aficionados, the name Togo might not ring a bell. Few would bet on them to trouble India in the Davis Cup 2025 World Group Playoff match here on the weekend. But for their captain Ali Agnamba , who believes his team is in the middle of the best phase in two decades, it would be anything but a cakewalk. Agnamba has a point.Togo have reached this position the back of a 10-match winning streak - achieved by a group of young players who play their tennis abroad. It may sound a bit fanciful when he suggested that his team could beat India, but then he threw up numbers to support his belief.""When we played against Latvia in the last match, nobody expected us to win,"" he said referring to the World No.73 Togo's Davis Cup tie against World No. 46 Latvia. ""Even back home, people thought this was going to be the end. But the guys came together, they were like 'Oh, we want to win this. We're going to win'. And we surprised a lot of people. Even the Latvia players were surprised when we beat them 4-0.""India are ranked eight places above Latvia - at 38.The captain, a former Togolese Davis Cupper himself who migrated to the US years back and was in the coaching team that worked with the Williams sisters in their formative years, draws his confidence from the ability of the four-member team at his disposal. His team of players are based around the world and have been specially assembled for this journey - two from Paris, one from Nantes and the other from Atlanta, USA - not just to earn glory, but respect too.""The Williams sisters changed women tennis. If you have a female tennis player doing what they're doing now, is because of them. Because before, nobody had to go to the gym to get strong. Those girls came, they're so powerful that they force everybody to do a lot more,"" he said.They also changed mindset on race, reminded Agnamba. ""You know, when you're a person of colour, you're already 10 steps below before you can come up. You have to be the best of the best to get respect. Even that sometimes you may not.""Togo would be looking to inspire some of that respect over the weekend. ""Obviously we have four players here that all live in different parts of the world, but we have a way to communicate together through chat. And when there's a competition like this, we kind of figure out how each player can get ready individually, either by training or going to competition. And that's how the team has been performing for the past three years,"" said Agnamba, who admitted having a culture shock when he shifted base to the US 30 years back.In a bid to escape poverty and being able to pursue the sport, the players had to leave Togo seeking greener pastures abroad, but their loyalty remains firmly with the western African country. So, in the match against India, the objective was not just to have a better show in Davis Cup, but to inspire several others back home struggling to make ends meet. Tennis is the second-most followed sport in Togo, behind football.""When you grow up in developing countries, the opportunity is very small. And when you are good at any type of sport, I mean, since we're talking about tennis and the dream is always to get out of the country because once you get out, you have more opportunity to train, you have better equipment. And yeah, that's always been a dream to get out of the country, to have more opportunity.""So, the average kid that plays tennis back home, they're coming from very poor families, and you cannot be your best in Africa. You must get up. And I think for any African country that played in the Davis Cup, 90% of the players live overseas. In developing countries there are a lot of poor kids that use sport as a way to get out of the country to have a better life. And I'll tell you, 99% of the players that are able to compete for Togo come from very poor families. But the system that we have there, the federation helps the best players.""",Togo face India in the Davis Cup 2025 World Group Playoff match on the weekend.

There’s an opaqueness to Jannik Sinner on a tennis court, the tighter a match gets the more inscrutable his expression becomes. Then, as the contest peaks and he is pulled out wide, he threads the needle with a two-hander. Sinner clutches his racket at the throat and shakes it, as if he’s in a conversation with his coaches Darren Cahill and Simone Vagnozzi, who are seated in his courtside box.The 23-year-old World No.1, who scored a straight-set win over the No.2 seed Alexander Zverev in the Australian Open final on Sunday, which made him the first Italian to lift three Grand Slam trophies, has been under a doping cloud these last nine months. Sinner, who won successive hard court majors in a span of four months while dealing with the upshot of positive drug tests, has flaunted serious heft.The World Anti-Doping Agency has appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport and a hearing is scheduled for April. The Italian faces a potential ban of up to two years.“Even when it's very difficult to block these kind of things, when I go on the court, I have the team and people who are close to me who trust me,” he said, sporting a striking Italian blue for his post-championship media conference. “That for me is even more important because I can talk with them, very openly.”“When I go on court, I try to focus on the match,” he said. “I know the match can be three, four, five hours, but that's the time when I have to be very focused. Obviously also in the gym, trying to stay with your routine, then you think a bit less about what's happening. Of course, it's still a little bit in the back of your mind.”Sinner and world No.3 Carlos Alcaraz, who have taken the baton from tennis’ terrific trio – Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and the still-competing Novak Djokovic -- who between them have won the last five Grand Slams, and six of the last seven, said he doesn’t need to use the CAS case to give him extra motivation to succeed.“What happened, happened, no?” Sinner said. “As I always say, I keep playing like this because I have a clear mind on what happened. If I was guilty, I would not play like this, that's it. At the moment, I'm not thinking about this. Of course, you have your moments, certain days where you feel like I wish I would not have this problem. In the other way, I'm always looking forward to go on the court.”Sinner, whose first language is German and speaks passable Italian, is his country’s most popular sportsperson. Last year, when Sinner emerged as the surprise winner of the Melbourne Park fortnight, there were no Italian journalists present, there hadn’t been one for years. This year there was almost a dozen of them, tracking the No.1s moves.Gaia Piccardi, tennis writer for Corriere Della Sera, says Italians admire Sinner’s work ethic. “Italians love a good sporting story, especially one that’s going to go a few years,” she says, “they see Jannik as someone they can cheer on for another 10 years.’’Vagnozzi, who has been with Sinner since February 2022, spoke of the No.1’s mental prowess.“Mentally he is really, really strong. When he wants something, he tries to do the best he can. So sometimes when someone speak about Jannik, they talk about his groundstrokes or his power. But for me, as a coach, when you ask him (to do) something, he's able to do it quite fast.”Zverev, who said Sinner was miles ahead of everyone on hardcourts, compared the Italian to Djokovic at his best.“They barely miss, they make you think like you have to overhit all the time to have a chance in a rally against them,” the German said of Djokovic and Sinner. “It's very, very difficult to win a point from the back of the court against them. They're constantly on the baseline. They don't give you any space. They don't give you any time.”Sinner’s win over Zverev in the Australian Open final took his win streak in hardcourt majors to 21 matches. The Italian hasn’t lost a set against top-10 opposition since losing to Alcaraz in the Beijing final.“I think the facts speak for themselves,” Zverev said. “He's in a different universe right now to anyone else.”",World No.1 Jannik Sinner won the Australian Open on Sunday. The 23-year-old is the first Italian to win three Grand Slams. Sinner has been under a doping cloud these last nine months.

Alexander Zverev 's loss in the Australian Open final on Sunday was followed by a startling moment during the trophy ceremony.As Zverev stood at the microphone, a person in the stadium repeatedly shouted the names of two of his ex-girlfriends who have accused him of physical abuse in the past, saying ""Australia believes"" them.The crowd's reaction was mixed, with some booing and whistling in response to the interruption. At his post-match press conference, Zverev was asked about the incident.""I believe there are no more accusations,"" Zverev responded. ""There haven't been for — what? — nine months now. ... I think I've done everything I can, and I'm not about to open that subject again.""Last June, as Zverev reached the French Open final , news emerged that a Berlin district court had ended a trial stemming from a woman's accusation of domestic violence during a 2020 argument. The resolution was reached with the agreement of state prosecutors and lawyers for Zverev and his former partner.Zverev had previously denied another assault allegation made by a different woman. The ATP investigated her claims and stated in January 2023 that there was insufficient evidence.","Alexander Zverev lost to Novak Djokovic in the Australian Open final.

Jannik Sinner retains Australian Open title with straight sets victory over Alexander Zverev,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/australian-open/jannik-sinner-retains-australian-open-title-with-straight-sets-victory-over-alexander-zverev/articleshow/117578014.cms,"(Photo by Darrian Traynor/Getty Images)

Jannik Sinner threw in a daring drop shot at match point, it came off his forehand side and was shaped with underspin. Alexander Zverev picked it up and didn't place it too poorly, but Sinner stepped in and swung through the court to close out the Australian Open final.After two-hours and 42-minutes of action in which time he strung together the 6-3, 7-6 (4), 6-3 win, Sinner, the world No.1, pushed his head back and threw up his arms in celebration. After the few seconds he had to himself, Rod Laver Arena on its feet, cheering him, Sinner looked at his team – coaches Darren Cahill and Simone Vagnozzi, trainer and physio Marco Panichi and Ulises Badio – before going over to embrace them.Not far from where Sinner celebrated his second successive win at Australian Open, Zverev, the world No.2, sat in his courtside seat, head bowed. The German has played three Slam finals and is looking for his first major title.Sinner and Zverev shared a warm embrace at the net and the 23-year-old began his speech with encouraging words for Zverev.""You are an amazing player,"" Sinner said. ""Keep believing in yourself, because all players and coaches know how strong you are, not only as a player, but also as a person. We all believe that you can lift one of these very, very soon.""Sinner, now a two-time Australian Open champion, and a three-time major winner, placed the Norman Brookes Challenge Cup beside him as he spoke, said, ""Talking about my team, what can I say? We worked a lot to be again in this position. It’s an amazing feeling to share this moment with all of you. It is amazing to achieve these things, but mostly to share this with you guys.""""And I know Darren, it's probably your - maybe, I try to convince you to stay - your last Australian Open as a coach, and I'm very, very happy to share this trophy with you,"" Sinner told Cahill, who was tearing up. ""Everything started a little bit when I made my whole change to Simone (Vagnozzi), and I think you are an amazing combination of coaches.""Earlier, when the German stepped forward to make his speech, there was a shout from the crowd, ""Australia Believes Olya and Brenda! Australia Believes Olya and Brenda!""Zverev battled a domestic violence case in Germany last year, accused by his ex-girlfriend Brenda Patea, the mother of his child, of physically abusing her. All of which he denies and wasn't formally charged.When asked about it in the press conference, Zverev said, ""I believe there are no more accusations. There haven't been for nine months now. Good for her. I think she was the only one in the stadium who believed anything in that moment. I think I've done everything I can, and I'm not about to open that subject again.""Zverev applauded the winner in his speech. ""You are the best player in the world by far. I was hoping that I could be more of a competitor today, but you were just too good. Congratulations to you. You really deserve it.""Sinner, who hasn't lost a set against top-ten opponents since losing to Carlos Alcaraz in Beijing in September, may not have played his best match in the final, but did enough to get through without facing a breakpoint.Sinner was kitted in colour blocks of the palest yellow and white, his attire cutting an anaemic look, while across the net Zverev was all colour, red on maroon with red shoes.In the first set, the 27-year-old, coming into the net, trying to unsettle the Italian, gave Sinner some target practice. The German trailed 15-40 in the fourth and eighth games, if the defending champion was sharpening his knife in the fourth game, he struck in the eighth and then went on to serve out the set at love in the ninth, closing with a 194 kmph ace.The roof over Rod Laver Arena was open and like the evening sky, that had lost some of its sparkle, Zverev, who looked to be in striking form as he advanced to the final at Melbourne Park , seemed to have lost some of the edge. The German did well to push the set to tie-break, where Sinner came through with a slice of luck on the ninth point, the net cord working for him, and the world No.1 broke away to seal a two-sets-to-love lead.In the third set, Sinner broke in the sixth game, as a dejected Zverev appeared to throw in the towel. The Italian was out in the front and didn't look back.","World No.1 Jannik Sinner beats Alexander Zverev in Australian Open final. Sinner wins 6-3, 7-6 (4), 6- 3 in two-hours and 42-minutes in Melbourne. German Sinner is a two-time Australian Open champion and three-time major winner.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117578658,imgsize-55946,width-400,resizemode-4/117578658.jpg"

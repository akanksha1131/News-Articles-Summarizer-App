NEW DELHI: Former Australia wicketkeeper and Punjab Kings assistant coach Brad Haddin has described Shreyas Iyer 's omission from India's Asia Cup 2025 squad as an “extraordinary selection”, admitting he was left baffled by the decision of the Indian selectors.Iyer, 30, was not included in the 15-member squad announced by BCCI chief selector Ajit Agarkar on Tuesday, nor was he named among the standbys. The exclusion of the in-form batter, who recently guided Punjab Kings to the IPL 2025 final, has sent ripples across the cricketing fraternity.“Well, one, leadership qualities. Two, the style of player he is under pressure, and he's someone that everyone plays better with when he's on the team. I had no idea. I first thought when I was reading it that he was injured, but he's not. So, it's a strange decision for me because he brings so much to the game. I actually thought he was going to be captain. Extraordinary selection,” Haddin said on the Willow Talk podcast.Iyer's credentials in franchise cricket underline the shock. In IPL 2025, he amassed 604 runs at a strike rate of 175.07, carrying Punjab Kings to only their second-ever final.Just a year earlier, he had captained Kolkata Knight Riders to their third IPL crown.Even Australian cricketers outside the selection circle were startled. On the LiSTNR Sport podcast, Alyssa Healy's instant reaction to the news was a stunned, “Oh my God!”, while host Adam Peacock quipped that it was “a Punjab conspiracy.”With India eyeing continental supremacy, the absence of Iyer, regarded as a big-match leader and proven performer, remains one of the most debated calls ahead of the Asia Cup.",Shreyas Iyer not included in India's 15-member squad for Asia Cup 2025.

Poll Do you agree with Aakash Chopra's view on RCB's influence over state cricket captaincy? Yes, it's inappropriate. No, it's a strategic move.

NEW DELHI: Former India cricketer Aakash Chopra has triggered a storm of debate on social media after questioning comments made by Royal Challengers Bengaluru's (RCB) Director of Cricket, Mo Bobat, regarding Rajat Patidar 's rise as a captain.RCB's decision to appoint Patidar as their new skipper ahead of the IPL 2025 season was a ‘surprise’ to many. However, Bobat, speaking to Cricbuzz, revealed that talks around Patidar's leadership role began midway through the 2024 season.“Actually, if I'm totally honest, the thought on Rajat was even earlier than what people might have thought. Midway through the 2024 season, I first spoke to him about captaincy and leadership,” Bobat said.The RCB official further disclosed that he encouraged Patidar to seek captaincy opportunities at the state level. “I did say: ‘Look, for you to even be an option or one of our senior leaders, it'd be good if you did some captaincy. So, go to your seniors, see if they'd be prepared to make you captain, even if it's just for white-ball cricket. Then let's see how it goes,'” Bobat added.Patidar soon spoke to Madhya Pradesh coach Chandrakant Pandit and was named MP captain, later leading them to the final of the 2024-25 Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy.But Bobat's remarks left Chopra stunned. The former India batter took to X and wrote: ""A franchise can’t possibly ‘nudge’ someone to lead in ‘domestic cricket’. Right? One could understand if someone is a seasoned State Team captain and is asked to continue (in case, he’s offered the captaincy by the state team again). Rajat was a first-time skipper at MP. This math isn’t mathing.”Chopra's post has since sparked widespread debate on whether IPL franchises should have any influence on state cricket captaincy decisions.While RCB might have found their leader in Patidar and they won their maiden IPL title, Chopra's sharp remark has ensured the discussion around the ethics of such influence is far from over.","Royal Challengers Bengaluru's Director of Cricket, Mo Bobat, made comments about Rajat Patidar's rise as a captain.

EXCLUSIVE: India to boycott Pakistan in Asia Cup? Harbhajan Singh says, 'Khoon aur paani ek saath nahi beh sakte'

Poll Should India participate in the match against Pakistan at the Asia Cup 2025? Yes, it promotes sportsmanship No, it undermines national sentiments

With less than a month to go for the Asia Cup 2025, political debate has intensified over India’s scheduled fixture against Pakistan in Dubai on September 14. The Samajwadi Party (SP) on Friday sharply criticised the government, questioning the need for sporting ties amid strained relations.SP’s Maharashtra unit chief Abu Asim Azmi said that holding the high-profile match was a “suspicious” move. “People demanded action, but instead, a ceasefire was announced. Now, when a cricket match is being organised, it feels suspicious. The people of India will not tolerate this. The government must give a clarification,” he told IANS.While stating he personally favoured peace, Azmi insisted that Pakistan’s actions made sporting engagements unacceptable. “I want friendship with Pakistan, but how can we play cricket with a country that keeps attacking us? Such matches should be completely boycotted,” he added.Similar sentiments were echoed by SP leader S.T. Hasan, who referred to the Pahalgam attack earlier this year. “We do not support playing a match with Pakistan. The wounds from the recent Pahalgam terror attack are still fresh. How can we sit and cheer for a cricket match against those responsible? Matches are meant for friends, not enemies.To play against Pakistan is nothing less than shameless,” he said.Hasan went further, stressing that trust could only be built once terrorsm ceased. “We taught Pakistan a good lesson then, so why should we now shake hands with them on a cricket field? If Pakistan really wants to build trust, it must guarantee an end to terrorsm. Only then should cricket or any sporting ties resume,” he remarked.He added, “Right now, the atmosphere is not right. If India goes ahead and plays Pakistan, it will be a disgrace for our nation in front of the entire world.”The Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports, meanwhile, recently reaffirmed its stance that India will not play bilateral cricket with Pakistan but will participate in multilateral tournaments where Pakistan is involved. This has cleared the path for the two teams’ Asia Cup clash, their first meeting since the Pahalgam attack escalated tensions.","The Samajwadi Party (SP) on Friday sharply criticised the government, questioning the need for sporting ties amid strained relations. “I want friendship with Pakistan, but how can we play cricket with a country that keeps attacking us?

Poll How do you rate Jitesh Sharma's performance in the IPL this year? Outstanding Good Average

BENGALURU: T20 cricket in India is brutally competitive. The quality of players who are missing from India’s team for the Asia Cup is ample evidence.In this scenario, for a 31-year-old to secure a spot after returning a cumulative 100 runs in nine T20I matches is an incredible comeback. But then, wicketkeeper-batter Jitesh Sharma always had the potential. It was only a question of finding himself.Jitesh made his India T20 debut at the Hangzhou Asian Games in 2023 but hasn’t worn India colours since Jan last year, when he featured against Afghanistan. Much of the interval has been a period of immense soul-searching.This year saw the emergence of Jitesh 2.0 during the Indian Premier League (IPL). Besides keeping wickets and playing the role of a finisher, the Vidarbha cricketer also assumed the role of stand-in skipper for eventual champions Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) when Rajat Patidar was injured.Playing in the middle order, he returned 261 runs at a strike rate of a staggering 176, playing some crucial knocks in his team's march to their maiden title. It was that performance that earned him his place back in the Indian team.The turnaround began long before the IPL. Jitesh privately admitted to fellow players that he had to reset mentally, and one of the people who helped him during the phase was India T20I skipper Suryakumar Yadav This was around the time the T20 World Cup squad was announced. Jitesh, who didn’t make the cut, was down and out. The long haul back began with a conversation with ‘SKY’.During the team announcement earlier this week, Suryakuamar said, “Post the last T20 World Cup, we spoke a lot about our approach. We said, ‘Let’s not think about milestones, just focus on the journey’. Since then, he's been a completely different cricketer — slow and steady. The way he performed in the IPL and the domestic tournaments he played, he's done really well and has earned his spot.”In the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy, Jitesh returned 135 runs in six outings at a strike rate of 225. His mentor and batting coach at RCB, Dinesh Karthik , told TOI that he always saw potential in Sharma.“Right from the outset, I was very sure Jitesh was someone who would come back into the Indian team and show his skills as a finisher,” said Karthik. “I think he did quite well in his first stint at IPL, but when the World Cup was around the corner, he put more pressure on himself than he had to and that kind of hindered his performances.”In the off-season, Jitesh worked with Karthik to iron out issues, both mentally and gamewise. “He was clear that he needed to target IPL and make sure he won the competition for the team,” said Karthik. “He was very conscious and very vocal about it. And that was the starting point. It takes a lot of courage for someone to be so honest about a situation like that. And that’s the one thing Jitesh does have in abundance — courage and belief in his skill and at times, admitting to his mistakes as well. ”On his work behind the scenes, Karthik said, “The first thing we worked on was how he can adapt to various situations because he’s got the skill. It was all about understanding how it needs to be done at the back end of an innings... the areas he should target, and the positions he should be getting into. It was very easy as a coach because of how malleable he was in his mind and how willing he was to work and do whatever it took to understand how to win a game or how to set a total up that could be above par in most cases. ""Karthik says Jitesh hasn’t grown just as a batter but also as a leader and player with intense game awareness. “He is a leader,” the former India wicketkeeper said. “When given the opportunity, when Rajat Patidar was injured, he just took over and did a wonderful job with the gloves and with the bat. I’m very excited to see how well he does for India because he has all the tools at his disposal. He simply must understand that he has all it takes to do well in international cricket. ”","Jitesh Sharma made his India T20 debut at the Hangzhou Asian Games in 2023.

India Asia Cup squad: Why Shreyas Iyer and Shubman Gill are biggest talking points

NEW DELHI: Former New Zealand batter Ross Taylor on Friday said the omission of Shreyas Iyer from India's squad for the upcoming Asia Cup underlined the incredible depth in the country's T20 esources.Iyer, who enjoyed a strong domestic season and guided Punjab Kings to the IPL 2025 final, was left out of the 15-member squad as well as five reserve names announced earlier this week.“I haven't seen the side yet so can't say. (But) when you can leave that type of quality out, you've got to be pretty comfortable with the depth of your squad,” Taylor told PTI Videos on the sidelines of the CLT10 League.The former Kiwi great also praised India's new Test captain Shubman Gill , who recently led his side to a 2-2 draw against England in the Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy. “It was a great series against England. Whenever you go into foreign conditions in Test cricket, especially these days, you have to take it very well. He has played in great spirits and led from the front,” Taylor said.Taylor will feature for the Supreme Stallions in the CLT10 League, calling it a nostalgic moment. “It has gone full circle — started playing with the tennis ball and now finishing my career playing with the tennis ball. It's a great concept,” he remarked.He added that the 10-over format offered younger players a platform: “The way these players express themselves, it is an opportunity to showcase their talent. As the tournament goes on, we will get to know them even more.”",Shreyas Iyer was left out of India's squad for the Asia Cup.

Poll Is South Africa now the dominant team in ODIs against Australia? Yes, absolutely No, Australia can bounce back

South Africa continued their stranglehold over Australia in one-day internationals, clinching their fifth successive bilateral ODI series win with a commanding performance in Mackay on Friday. The Proteas defended 277 to secure victory by 84 runs in the second ODI, taking an unassailable 2-0 lead in the three-match series.The triumph extends South Africa’s dominance in the rivalry, with the Proteas now having won eight of the last 10 bilateral ODI series against Australia, including each of the last five (2016, 2018, 2019, 2023 and now 2025). They have also taken 17 of the last 21 completed ODIs between the two teams.Australia’s batting woes once again proved costly. Chasing 278, they folded for just 193, marking the fourth consecutive time they have been dismissed for under 200 in home ODIs. Remarkably, three of those four collapses have come against South Africa.Apart from Josh Inglis, who struck a fighting half-century (87 off 74), the rest of the Australian batting line-up faltered against disciplined bowling from Lungi Ngidi (5/42) and Nandre Burger (2/23).Ngidi, who claimed a five-wicket haul, was all smiles at the end, with Inglis’ dismissal proving the final nail in the coffin.South Africa’s innings was set up by Matthew Breetzke (88 off 78) and Tristan Stubbs (74), who added crucial partnerships after early wickets. Breetzke, continuing his dream start to international cricket, struck eight fours and two sixes in his knock, making it four successive 50-plus scores in his first four ODIs. Stubbs provided stability in the middle overs before Adam Zampa (3/63) pegged back the visitors. The Proteas were eventually bowled out for 277 in 49.1 overs.Australia’s reply began poorly, with Burger and Ngidi striking early to dismiss Travis Head and Marnus Labuschagne. Cameron Green (35) added some resistance alongside Inglis, but Senuran Muthusamy broke that stand, leaving the hosts in deeper trouble. Dropped catches did not cost South Africa much, as they wrapped up the game comfortably.For Australia, the defeat continues a worrying trend. They have now lost seven of their last eight ODIs, with their only win in that period coming against England during the Champions Trophy earlier this year.South Africa, meanwhile, have made a habit of outplaying their fierce rivals, and this fifth consecutive ODI series win firmly underlines their supremacy in the contest.",South Africa beat Australia by 84 runs in the second ODI in Mackay.

Poll Will India dominate the Asia Cup 2025? Yes, they are favorites No, they might struggle

Former India wicketkeeper Vijay Dahiya believes Shreyas Iyer can consider himself unfortunate to miss out on the Asia Cup squad but admitted such omissions are inevitable given the depth of the Indian side.Iyer, who guided Kolkata Knight Riders to the IPL 2024 title and scored over 600 runs at a strike rate of 175 in IPL 2025 for Punjab Kings, was not included in the 15-member squad for the tournament starting September 9 in the UAE. Yashasvi Jaiswal was another notable absentee.“Once the team is picked, we cannot say much about it. Whenever any Indian team is picked, some players will always miss out. The bench strength we have, we can field two separate teams but some players will always be left out,” Dahiya told PTI.He added that Iyer’s form made his absence a talking point. “But nothing much can be changed now, as he is not even part of the reserves as well. But yes, the way he has performed has made everyone think that he is missing.”While Iyer sits out, pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah has been included inthe white-ball side for the first time since the 2024 T20 World Cup. The fast bowler has only played Tests over the past year and missed the Champions Trophy as well.Dahiya, however, feels the team management will be cautious with him. “I feel that there will be many such matches where he (Bumrah) might not play and feature only in those crunch matches, and we can manage his workload there,” he said.Mohammed Siraj was also left out of the squad, a decision Dahiya attributed to workload management after a taxing five-Test series in England.Looking ahead, Dahiya backed India to dominate the competition. “There is not much threat in the Asia Cup for India but T20 is a format that changes quickly. India will lose only if we have a bad day or someone plays exceptional cricket,” he said.",Former India wicketkeeper Vijay Dahiya believes Shreyas Iyer can consider himself unfortunate to miss out on the Asia Cup squad.

Major League Cricket 2025 Explained: Teams, Schedule & Where to Watch

International Cricket Council (ICC) has been a spectator as USA Cricket (USAC) continues to be run in a chaotic state. Earlier this week, USAC sent notices to American Cricket Enterprises (ACE) threatening them of derailing cricket administration in the US thereby fueling chaos in the region's cricketing fraternity. Despite repeated notices from the ICC and United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee's (USOPC) appeal for a regime change, USAC has continued to remain defiant.Last year, the global body had put USAC on notice and a further extension of three months was given at ICC's Annual General Meeting (AGM) in Singapore last month. This was after the USOPC had categorically stated that they would not be keen on working with the current cricket administration in the country.""In relation to USA Cricket, the ICC reiterated its previous position and confirmed that the organisation remains on notice. USA Cricket is required to undertake comprehensive governance reforms, including but not limited to completing free and fair elections within a three-month period. The Board, however, reserves the right to take such actions as it deems appropriate,"" read the ICC statement.In less than a month since that call to get its house in order, chaos continues to reign supreme in the region.After months of threats to issue breach notices, USA Cricket published a press release that said they were terminating their commercial agreement with ACE, which was signed in 2019.In doing so, USAC has conveyed to the ICC that they refuse to identify with the global body's recommendations and are not interested in coordinating with the USOPC either.""USA Cricket today announced the termination of its commercial agreement with American Cricket Enterprises (ACE), citing multiple material breaches of the Term Sheet signed between the parties in May 2019,"" read a USA Cricket release.The move is slated to affect a lot of cricketing activities as ACE was responsible for the Major League Cricket (MLC) and Minor League Cricket (MiLC) — the two professionally run tournaments in the region.MLC, which recently completed its third season, saw leading international cricketers in action and has a strong presence from India in the form of IPL team owners. The latest development leaves MiLC, which was due to start soon, uncertain and the future of cricketers looking to make a name for themselves at the mercy of administrators who haven't been able to get their house in order.It is worth noting that ICC has maintained a very soft stance with the USAC and ignored the misgovernance even in the build-up to the 2024 T20 World Cup. The USAC were kept at arm's length as ICC handled the preparations. As a result of all this, one of the biggest markets remains untapped.The USAC looks far from ready to host fair elections, musical chairs have continued with the role of the Chief Executive Officer (CEO). Dr. Noor Murad, the former CEO, had his contract terminated and it is reliably learnt that he never got a free hand from the top brass to implement cricketing decisions and other policies. Additionally, he is believed to have highlighted the over-influence of administrators in cricketing and selection matters.Different ICC leaderships have failed to address the mess and with the LA 2028 Olympics not too far away, it's imperative the global cricket body acts tough and sets the house in order. If it doesn't, it could lead to embarrassment of its own doing.","International Cricket Council (ICC) has been a spectator as USA Cricket (USAC) continues to be run in a chaotic state.

Poll Which sport do you think is more complex to understand: cricket or rugby? Cricket Rugby Neither, they're both simple

Pop icon Taylor Swift once admitted to being baffled by cricket during an appearance on The Graham Norton Show, where she shared the couch with former England cricketer Kevin Pietersen . The exchange, which aired in 2014, resurfaced for the singer’s candid and light-heartedly hilarious remarks about the sport.At the time, Pietersen was promoting his autobiography KP: The Autobiography, which revisited the infamous “textgate” controversy of 2012. The former England batter faced pointed questions from Norton about sending provocative messages to members of the South African team during a Test series, a scandal that tainted his relationship with then-captain Andrew Strauss.While the discussion turned serious for Pietersen, Swift admitted she was still trying to wrap her head around the game. “I’ve never been to a cricket match,” she confessed, before adding, “But I went to Lord’s today.”Pietersen jumped at the chance to tease her. “If you Google ‘cricket’, you will get a result that ‘Lord’s is the home of cricket.’ So Taylor walked through the door at Lord’s, and said: ‘Cricket, of course I know who you are’. ‘No, you don’t! You don’t know what cricket is!’” he joked.Swift defended herself, describing her limited understanding of the sport.“I know what cricket is. I know it’s relatively violent,” she said, drawing laughter from the audience.She went on to explain where the impression came from. “In an episode of the popular sitcom Friends, Ross Geller is dating an English girl, and in a scene Ross joins his girlfriend’s friends in a game of cricket. He tries to play and he breaks all the bones in his body! It’s wild,” Swift recalled.To this, the host Graham Norton responded with amusement: “Wasn’t that rugby?” Swift too, accepted that she got the two mixed up with an awkward smile on her face.","Taylor Swift once admitted to being baffled by cricket during an appearance on The Graham Norton Show.

Chelsea secured a commanding 5-1 victory against West Ham on Friday after falling behind early in the match. Former Chelsea manager Graham Potter faces mounting pressure after winning only five out of 21 games since taking charge in January.The result follows West Ham's disappointing 3-0 loss to newly-promoted Sunderland last weekend. Lucas Paqueta gave West Ham an early lead with an impressive strike.""It was a tough evening for us. Against a top team, to concede the goals in the manner we have, it is an impossible task,"" Potter said.Chelsea's response was swift, with Joao Pedro scoring from a corner. Pedro Neto and Enzo Fernandez extended Chelsea's lead further.Moises Caicedo and Trevoh Chalobah capitalised on mistakes by West Ham's new goalkeeper Mads Hermansen. The win propelled Chelsea to the top of the Premier League for the first time since December 2021.Chelsea faced a setback before the match when Cole Palmer withdrew during warm-up due to a muscle injury.""The last four or five days he was not 100 percent. We prefer not to take any risks and we see in the next hours (how serious the injury is),"" Maresca stated.Palmer's absence provided an opportunity for Brazilian youngster Estevao to make his first Premier League start. Another Brazilian, Paqueta, opened the scoring with a spectacular goal.Paqueta had recently been cleared of spot-fixing allegations by an independent regulatory commission. The 27-year-old celebrated emotionally, pointing to his club badge after scoring.West Ham's lead lasted only nine minutes before Chelsea's comeback began. Joao Pedro scored his first Premier League goal for Chelsea, heading in from Marc Cucurella's corner.West Ham thought they had regained the lead through Niclas Fuellkrug, but VAR ruled it offside. Pedro then assisted Neto for Chelsea's second goal.Estevao, an 18-year-old talent who previously scored against Chelsea for Palmeiras, showed impressive pace. He assisted Fernandez for Chelsea's third goal after 34 minutes.West Ham's transfer activity has been minimal during the summer window. Their new goalkeeper Hermansen, signed for £20 million from Leicester, made crucial errors leading to Chelsea's fourth and fifth goals.Caicedo capitalised on Hermansen's dropped corner for the fourth goal. Chalobah added the fifth after another corner kick error by the goalkeeper.Many home supporters left the stadium with 30 minutes remaining, while those who stayed expressed their disappointment at full-time. Potter, who was dismissed from Chelsea in 2023 after seven months, now faces pressure to improve West Ham's performance.","Chelsea defeated West Ham 5-1 in the Premier League on Friday.

Poll Do you believe Ashvir Singh Johal's appointment as the first Sikh manager in British professional football is significant? Yes, it's a major milestone No, it's just a coincidence

Morecambe FC have made history after becoming the first professional football club in England to be owned by Sikh owners, following a takeover by Panjab Warriors this week. The landmark moment was further underlined when Ashvir Singh Johal was appointed as the new manager, making him the first Sikh to lead a professional British club.The new owners said that they want their cultural identity and values to guide the way they run the National League side. “Punjab, the land of five rivers, is our native land,” Gurpreet Singh, the group’s head of communications, told BBC. “For us, our heritage, our culture and our faith are our core principles. They make us who we are. And it is these principles – discipline, trustfulness, compassion – that we want to bring to Morecambe. ”Morecambe chief executive Ropinder Singh also reflected those sentiments. “There is no better marriage than Punjab and football,” he told BBC. “The doors are open for everybody. The idea is that we want to change the narrative that football ownership is an unethical process.”The development has been welcomed across the Sikh community in the UK and beyond. Jagbir Jhutti-Johal, professor of Sikh studies at the University of Birmingham, told BBC: “People back home in Punjab will be very proud of the fact that Sikhs are running a club here.Sikhs in America, Canada, etc, will be watching closely. And those in the UK, even if they might be fans of Liverpool or Manchester United, will also be rooting for Morecambe. ”Johal’s appointment has been described as a powerful moment of representation. Preetam Singh, founder of Stretford Sikhs, which is Manchester United’s first official Sikh supporters’ club said, “Ashvir wears a patka and has a dadhi, so the clear image of a Sikh is now out there on a big stage. People notice, they ask questions, they learn. Even his name and appearance alone can spark understanding – and that’s going to have a massive impact. ”Former referee Jarnail Singh, the first turban-wearing official in English league football, also underlined the significance. “For the South Asian community, and especially the Sikh community, I think it’s absolutely superb where we actually have broken the glass ceiling in terms of going into management,” he told BBC. “It just gives everybody the drive to know that one of our Sikhs has reached the pinnacle as a manager, and he’ll be a great role model. ”For Johal himself, the appointment is less about symbolism and more about his coaching ambitions. His father, Kulvinder, said, “At the moment, Ash has got a job to do. He’s not purposely gone out to be a role model. He is chasing his dream to be a coach. This is another milestone in a career that began when he was 15, 16 years old.”He added, “If along the way he happens to become a role model for other people in the community, if this allows others to chase their dreams, then that can only be a good thing for the UK as a whole.”","Ashvir Singh Johal has been appointed as the new manager of Morecambe FC.

Images of a fan jumping from the stands to escape a beating as bottles, rocks and seats fly through the air at a game between Chilean and Argentine clubs in Buenos Aires on Wednesday highlight the enduring problem of violence in Latin American football.Over 100 people were arrested over the bloody battles between supporters of Universidad de Chile and Argentina's Independiente , which left 19 people injured, three seriously.From Mexico to Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Chile and Ecuador, stadium violence continues to mar the beautiful game in football-mad Latin America.Here is a quick overview of the situation:Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Honduras, Ecuador, Peru and Uruguay have all enacted laws over the past two decades to tackle hooliganism, including, in some cases, with prison sentences.But the violence continues unabated.So far this year in Chile, twelve matches were suspended due to violence, according to the players' union.In April, two fans died during a stampede outside a Santiago stadium before a Copa Libertadores match between local side Colo Colo and Brazil's Fortaleza.In Argentina, more than 100 people have died in the last 20 years, 157 in Brazil between 2009 and 2019, and 170 died in Colombia between 2001 and 2019, according to academic and NGO studies.There's an idea ""that stadiums are spaces where it's legitimate to commit acts of violence, not just physical violence, but also racism and homophobia,"" Argentine sociologist Diego Murze, author of the book ""Football, Violence, and the State,"" told AFP.According to Murze, there's a ""tribal logic that has always prevailed in football,"" including a culture of provocation between fans that has ""re-emerged in recent years.""For many fans, ""football is a channel for frustration,"" says Colombian sociologist German Gomez, author of the book ""Football and Hooligans, an Urban Phenomenon.""Gomez attributed it to ""a poeticization of what a team's victory means in the lives of these fans, which leads to that loss of emotional control when a match is won, and even when it is lost.""Security has been stepped up at stadiums around the continent, with some requiring biometric identification for entry and installing video surveillance of the stands.""In Argentina, they monitor you more in a soccer stadium than at the airport,"" Murze said,But the technology, while useful to identify banned offenders, is often powerless to prevent violence by hitherto unknown individuals with masked faces.The Colombian sociologist accused Conmebol, South America's football governing body, of being lax on violence, saying it doesn't ""issue exemplary sanctions against soccer clubs because... closing a soccer club can mean significant financial losses.""In Argentina, visiting fans are not allowed at local first division games.Several clubs in the World Cup title holder, as well as in Chile and Uruguay, were forced to play behind closed doors last year as punishment for fan violence.Murze argued that clubs need to professionalise their security apparatus, as they currently ""rely entirely on what the state and the police can do.""Following the deaths of the two fans in Chile in April, the Chilean government ended the ""Safe Stadium"" program, an initiative created in 2011 to combat football violence, without success.The program prohibited drums and banners from stadiums and left stadium security in the hands of private individuals.The government has pledged to replace it with new rules for all mass events.""Mitigating football violence in South America must be driven by actions that promote education and football culture,"" said Gomez.","Stadium violence continues to mar the beautiful game in football-mad Latin America. More than 100 people have died in the last 20 years, 157 in Brazil between 2009 and 2019, and 170 in Colombia between 2001 and 2019.

What’s common between the three Formula E world champions

How the three World Champions fared in Formula E Season 11

Days after Oliver Rowland lifted his Formula E World Championship trophy in London this season, an interesting trend has come to the attention of Formula E and its fans. As a coincidence, all Formula E drivers who won the Mexico City E-Prix went on to win the Formula E World Championship that season, and this has been proved right for three consecutive years.Highlighting the same since 2023, a poster of three World Champions was shared on X by Formula E with the caption, “The trend continues. Each winner of the #MexicoCityEPrix from the past three seasons has gone on to become World Champion.”The special poster features 2023 Formula E World Champion Jake Dennis from Andretti, then TAG Heuer Porsche’s Pascal Wehrlein, who won in 2024, and the new World Champion, Nissan driver Oliver Rowland. All three of them won in the Mexico E-Prix and went on to lift the winner’s trophy in the Formula E World Championship that year.Oliver Rowland had strengthened his chances of winning the Formula E World Championship this year much earlier. He was leading the Formula E Driver Standings ever since he won Part 2 of the Jeddah E-Prix, which was his second win of the season after winning the Mexico E-Prix. In the last leg, the Nissan driver got nervous for a while as Pascal Wehrlein, who was following him in the number two position, closed the gap after grabbing quite a few podiums while Rowland had a dull period.Things became serious for Rowland when he failed to finish the Round 13 race in Berlin, while Wehrlein won second spot on the podium. But he eventually managed to confirm his championship in Berlin after four wins and three more podiums.Sharing about his bad race in Berlin, Rowland had said, “I was hoping before the weekend that the outcome could be [the World Championship], but after yesterday (Saturday) and this morning (Sunday), I was more worried that it might never come.”Also Read: Oliver Rowland reacts to daughter’s sweet radio message after Formula E Championship win: “It’s amazing” Things, however, changed for Wehrlein, who was pushed to third position after Nick Cassidy made a late entry in the Formula E Driver Standings by registering three consecutive wins.

Wehrlein registered one win and five more podiums this season.Meanwhile, Andretti driver Jake Dennis finished in seventh position in the Formula E Driver Standings.

Taylor Barnard on losing top three spot in Formula E World Championship

Fans hail Taylor Barnard for his fantastic rookie season

It was Taylor Barnard’s rookie season this year, and the NEOM McLaren driver put up a fantastic performance by temporarily making it to the top three in the Formula E Driver Standings by ousting the much more experienced Porsche driver Antonio Felix Da Costa. He was, however, ousted from the top three at the London E-Prix as Jaguar’s Nick Cassidy went on to register three consecutive wins. Barnard took to Instagram to share his feelings on losing out on the top three in his first-ever season and his claim to the championship.Taking to Instagram after the London E-Prix, Barnard wrote, “London wasn’t what we hoped for, easily being the toughest weekend of our season. Taking 0 points away as a team from a doubleheader hurts, but one weekend doesn’t define the year we’ve had.”He further wrote, “As the season closes, I want to say a massive thank you to the entire team, both trackside and behind the scenes, for everything this season. Finishing P4 in the Drivers’ Championship and coming into the final weekend with a shot at runner-up is something to be proud of.”Also adding a note for teammate Sam Bird, as NEOM McLaren withdrew from Formula E after the end of the season, Barnard wrote, “@sambird_official it wasn’t the weekend you deserved either.You’ve been a huge part of my season both on and off the track, and I’m grateful for everything. You deserved more. To all the Papaya fans, thank you for the incredible support in our final race together. You always go above and beyond. ”Reacting to his post, a fan wrote, “An incredible debut season, huge congrats and excited to see where you go next!” Another said, “I know I said it the other day, but you’ve been incredible to watch this last year and a pleasure to support you in Papaya — there are many of us that can’t wait to support you in whatever you do next!” One more commented, “You were incredible all season around, Taylor.

We couldn’t have done it without you all — your trust and support have never been taken for granted,” he added.Praising the two McLaren drivers, he wrote, “Sam clinched McLaren’s first-ever fully electric win at the São Paulo E-Prix in Season 10, pulling off one of Formula E’s all-time great overtakes, before being waved across the line by none other than Emerson Fittipaldi – McLaren's first Formula 1 World Champion. While Taylor has been a rookie sensation in Season 11, securing five Formula E records, including the youngest driver to start a race, the youngest points scorer, the youngest driver to lead a lap, the youngest podium finisher, and the youngest polesitter. ”He ended the letter saying, “Some of us have been together since the day we first launched this team, while others have seamlessly fitted in along the way and flourished within the environment we have cultivated. For many, I am sure that we will cross paths again soon, but whatever the future holds for those here at Bicester, whatever path they choose to follow, I have no doubt that it will be bright.

How do Formula E and ABB work together?

What do ABB and Formula E say about the partnership?

After a successful Season 11, ABB and Formula E have announced that they will continue their partnership in the upcoming season. This gives ABB another opportunity to promote its new brand positioning via the ABB FIA Formula E World Championship, along with technologies that help industries take a cleaner route.Over a period of eight seasons, the partnership with Formula E has provided ABB a platform to showcase how technology can help industries outrun challenges, engage with customers around the world, and implement its own solutions into the series to improve reliability and efficiency. The partnership extension will provide a year-round opportunity for brand-building and activation, communicating ABB and its technology solutions to new global audiences, including Formula E’s international fanbase.ABB and Formula E will also join hands to engage a new generation of fans, collaborating with unexpected influencers and content creators to tell compelling stories that make advanced electrification and automation technologies tangible and exciting.The end of the mid-race car swap, a 150kW increase in power, top speeds that are 43 percent higher, and energy recovery increasing from 15 to 50 percent indicate how far Formula E technology has come to outperform on track.ABB has also built on its technical involvement in the series, supplying the race chargers from Season 9, and introducing its ABB Ability OPTIMAX® energy management software (Season 9) and Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) technology (Season 5) to the sport.ABB Head of Brand Paco Liebrand said, “We are pleased to be continuing our partnership with Formula E which, like ABB, is striving for a leaner and cleaner future. The synergy between the two organizations, combined with the global appeal of the Championship, makes it a great platform to promote our brand positioning.”He further said, “Formula E is increasingly working with content creators, influencers, and celebrities, with initiatives such as the Evo Sessions making an impact through digital channels beyond the racing itself, which is also an essential part of ABB’s new brand strategy. Going forward, we will be enhancing the way we harness the benefits of this collaboration, ensuring the focus is on delivering content and activations that reinforce our new messaging, build familiarity, and tell the ‘Engineered to Outrun’ story. ”Formula E Chief Revenue Officer Tiziana Di Gioia said, “Our renewed partnership with ABB is a testament to the commercial power and benefit of Formula E as a global platform that drives both brand and business growth. ABB, like our wider partnership portfolio, has and continues to see enormous value in collaborating with the fastest-growing motorsport on the planet, with viewership, commercial integration, and brand storytelling continuing to accelerate. Over eight seasons, ABB has moved from brand visibility to brand activation—integrating deeply into the fan experience, the sport’s ecosystem, and our innovation narrative.Also Read: Antonio Felix Da Costa shares happy memories as Porsche wins Formula E Teams and Manufacturers’ World Championships “This next chapter elevates the partnership even further. With ABB’s new positioning, we are co-creating opportunities across content, digital storytelling, and market engagement, transforming a title partnership into a year-round, value-generating relationship. It’s a model of how modern sponsorships should evolve, rooted in purpose and cultural alignment but measured by impact,” she added.Formula E Season 12 will begin with testing in Valencia in October.","ABB and Formula E have announced that they will continue their partnership in the upcoming season.

Poll How do you feel about the decision to feature singles players in the mixed doubles event? It's a great idea for visibility. It undermines doubles specialists. It should remain separate.

When Sara Errani and Andrea Vavassori stepped on to the court at Flushing Meadows, they weren’t just defending their US Open mixed doubles title. They were fighting for doubles specialists everywhere as the event had been overhauled into a 16-team ‘spectacle’ starring singles superstars, backed by $1 million prize money and a radical Fast4 tennis format.Unseeded and wildcards Errani and Vavassori were injected into a field that had numerous headline acts. Carlos Alcaraz, Jannik Sinner, Aryna Sabalenka (both withdrew), Novak Djokovic, Taylor Fritz, Iga Swiatek, Emma Raducanu, Jessica Pegula and Madison Keys were some of the big names involved.But the winners were still to be crowned Grand Slam champions and that’s what irked doubles specialists who couldn't be part of the event and not by choice.Unsurprisingly, there was an outcry. Jamie Murray dismissed it as ""a glorified exhibition."" Errani-Vavassori had said in a joint statement that it was ""pseudo-exhibition"" and “profound injustice” which “disrespect(s) an entire category of players.”Rather hilariously, Casper Ruud, who has lost three major singles finals, was positioned as someone chasing their maiden Grand Slam title.""I know it created a lot of reaction and [it was] somewhat bold to do it,"" said Ruud on United States Tennis Association's (USTA) move to upend the event that gets largely ignored otherwise.""You can't argue that it's not been great for the fans.""If the objective was to draw fans, bring attention to the event that otherwise gets lost and ignored and get viewers hooked to the TV, one can reasonably argue that the goal has been met.But at what cost? The 138-year tradition was ripped apart. As was the chance for many doubles specialists to win a major tournament, including this year's Wimbledon champions Sam Verbeek and Katerina Siniakova. To add to the injustice of it all, doubles World No. 2 Siniakova was withdrawn from the draw at the last minute when her partner Sinner pulled out late. By then, she had skipped Cleveland to play the US Open.In the end, as far as polarising narratives go, the final offered another one. Doubles specialists vs singles specialists. It has been one of the raging arguments in the sport and rarely is it answered with much at stake. And here we were, with plenty riding on it.Both Ruud and Swiatek found it challenging to deal with Errani's 70mph serve as Vavassori moved about at the net to cause distraction. At one point in the second set, Ruud and Swiatek were both guilty of shanking three consecutive forehand returns.Australia's Ellen Perez, a doubles specialist herself, said she had ""never felt more Italian"" as she supported them.The moment Vavassori landed an unpickable return on Swiatek's feet after a 92-minute match, the doubles community had been vindicated. “This is for all the doubles players who couldn’t play this tournament,” Errani said. Vavassori added: “We have been on a mission.”""We showed that doubles is a great product and in the future we need more marketing and visibility,"" Vavassori shot out at the US Open decision-makers.But the success of the two-day doubles showdown, where singles players seemingly enjoyed, Louis Armstrong and Arthur Ashe Stadium were used and DJs worked overtime, could mean USTA sticks by this structure instead of tinkering with it and introducing more doubles teams for the future.Jack Draper and Karolina Muchova called it an 'exhibition' - a word that is disparagingly used by athletes. On the opening day, it appeared to be the case. With two courts in use, giant screens showing the other match as well and attention being dragged, the quality felt laboured. The semi-finals and final turned that notion around with a more serious feel to it.If the US Open continues with the mixed doubles event for the future, it must come with some much-needed changes. As far as the playing field is concerned, bringing in champions from three other majors could be an idea worth exploring to not just address the concerns of the doubles specialists but also make things even more interesting on the doubles vs singles quotient.Additionally, the tournament needs better organisation and coordination. Sabalenka and Gauff pulled out to hurt the hype train. Cincinnati Open finished mere hours before the mixed event got underway in New York and an ill Sinner withdrew while Swiatek barely made it in time.Caty McNally had just 60 seconds to agree to a partner. “Sunday night I was home in Cincinnati and my agent called me, and he said you have 60 seconds to tell me if you want to play with Lorenzo Musetti.”Many teams didn't even practice together before taking to court, which could explain the comic point involving Andrey Rublev and Muchova. Naomi Osaka played her first round match, alongside Gael Monfils, in a practice kit.The obvious exceptions to this all were the Italians Errani and Vavassori who needed 42, 56, 44 and 92 minutes, respectively, to win the title. It is worth reminding that the duo, who have won 12 major titles, were unseeded and needed a wildcard to get in.As the beaten finalist Swiatek said: “You proved that mixed doubles players are smarter tactically than singles players, I guess.”For now, as far as mic drop moments go, Errani and Vavassori had delivered it - embarrassed the US Open organisers, successfully defended their title against the best singles players in the world and walked off with a cool million dollars.","Sara Errani and Andrea Vavassori beat Casper Ruud and Iga Swiatek in the US Open mixed doubles final at Flushing Meadows.

Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma, Shubman Gill struggle as India falter in first ODI vs Australia

NEW DELHI: Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma ’s much-anticipated return to international cricket after an eight-month hiatus ended in disappointment, as both failed to make an impact in India’s first ODI against Australia at Perth’s Optus Stadium. The Indian stalwarts, who had not played since IPL 2025, struggled on the fast, bouncy pitch despite three practice sessions prior to the match.Rohit Sharma could manage only 8 runs before being dismissed by a brilliant delivery from Josh Hazlewood, while Kohli’s outing was even shorter, lasting just eight balls before Mitchell Starc claimed his wicket.Former Australian pacer Glenn McGrath analysed their performances on the Fast Bowling Cartel YouTube channel.""There was a lot of talk going into the match about the two greats, Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli. They've not had a lot of cricket under their belt. And I think they got found out a little bit on a pitch that has got a little bit more pace and a lot more bounce than what they're used to back in India,"" McGrath said.The Indian team has now moved to Adelaide, where they held their first training session at the Adelaide Oval on Tuesday afternoon.Both Kohli and Sharma participated in extended batting practice.Their performances in the upcoming matches have taken on added significance as discussions continue about their future in the squad. Questions remain over whether the duo will be part of India’s team for the 2027 World Cup, scheduled across South Africa, Namibia, and Zimbabwe.The return of these two senior players had generated massive excitement among fans, but their extended absence from international cricket seemed to affect their performance on the challenging Perth pitch.","Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma failed to make an impact in India’s first ODI against Australia.

ACB spokesperson condemns 'barbaric attack' that killed 3 Afghanistan cricketers

Afghanistan Cricket Board (ACB) spokesperson Sayed Naseem Sadaat announced on Tuesday that the board possesses clear evidence, including video footage, implicating Pakistan in an attack that killed three local cricketers in Afghanistan's Urgun district. The incident has prompted Afghanistan to withdraw from next month’s Tri-Nation T20I Series scheduled to be held in Pakistan.The statement comes after the Pakistan government denied reports of cricketers being killed in an airstrike.""We got evidence all the cricket fraternity and all the people around the world would have definitely watched our video report on the incident that was made by our media team. So, we got clear evidence that the attack was done by a Pakistani state,"" Sadaat told ANI.The ACB spokesperson confirmed that the board has officially decided to withdraw from the upcoming tri-series hosted by Pakistan.In a post on X last Friday, the ACB reported that the attack had caused multiple casualties, including three local cricketers — Kabeer, Sibghatullah, and Haroon — who were returning home after playing a friendly match in Sharana, Paktika province.""The ACB considers this a great loss for Afghanistan's sports community, its athletes, and the cricketing family,"" the board stated.""We call upon all the cricket boards to condemn such barbaric attacks because cricket is a game that carries the message of peace. Cricketers are peace ambassadors and they should be stayed away from the war. War should not be interfered in sports. So we call upon all the cricket fraternity and boards to condemn such attacks and keep cricket away from war,"" Sadaat said.Both the International Cricket Council (ICC) and the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) have expressed their support for the ACB following the tragic incident.Zimbabwe has since stepped in to replace Afghanistan in the tri-series, joining Pakistan and Sri Lanka.The series will begin on November 17 in Rawalpindi, with Pakistan facing Zimbabwe in the opener, followed by Zimbabwe taking on Sri Lanka at the same venue.

Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma, Shubman Gill struggle as India falter in first ODI vs Australia

NEW DELHI: While his long-time teammate Virat Kohli will be looking to continue his stellar form at a familiar Adelaide Oval during the second ODI against Australia on Thursday, former skipper Rohit Sharma faces a very different challenge — breaking his run-drought at the venue.The first ODI in Perth was a disappointing return for Rohit, as he managed just eight runs off 14 balls, hitting only a single boundary.Fans, and perhaps Rohit himself, expected fireworks during the powerplay, with the 'Hitman' dispatching bowlers to the ropes. Instead, he looked like a player trying to catch up after months away from international cricket.With openers like Yashasvi Jaiswal , Abhishek Sharma, and Prabhsimran Singh vying for spots with strong List-A performances, Rohit will need to make the most of these two ODIs in Australia, as well as the three remaining ODIs at home against South Africa this year.Historically, Rohit has shone under pressure, and he will be looking to channel that form to keep his 2027 Cricket World Cup aspirations alive.A video circulating on social media shows Rohit taking Jaiswal’s bat and doing shadow practice.Watch the video here Despite his overall success against Australia, Adelaide Oval has not been kind to Rohit. In 12 ODIs across 15 innings, he has scored only 287 runs at an average of 19.13, with a top score of 43.In six ODIs specifically at the venue, he has 131 runs at an average of 21.83.During his last appearance at Adelaide Oval in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy 2025, Rohit struggled, scoring three and six in the pink-ball Test, dismissed by Scott Boland and Pat Cummins. This time, however, Rohit arrives fitter and in a format where he has historically excelled, hoping to rewrite his Adelaide narrative.","The first ODI in Perth was a disappointing return for Rohit Sharma, as he managed just eight runs off 14 balls, hitting only a single boundary.

'Unfair at this stage!': Virat Kohli's childhood coach on the treatment of senior duo Virat-Rohit

NEW DELHI: Australia batter Matthew Short believes his team’s pacers will continue to target Virat Kohli outside off stump when India face Australia in the second ODI on Thursday. Kohli, dismissed for a duck in the series opener in Perth, will be eager to bounce back at the Adelaide Oval, his most successful overseas venue with five international centuries and an average of 65 across formats.""I'm not in the fast-bowling meetings, but that seems to be the way he has been getting out recently,"" Short told reporters.""Some of the guys like 'Hoff' (Josh Hazlewood) and 'Starcy' ( Mitchell Starc ), they have bowled a lot against him, they know what they're doing. In Perth they sort of let the conditions do all the work, a bit of swing and nip on the wicket, so I'm sure they'll do the same again.""India enjoyed overwhelming support from a 42,423-strong crowd at the Optus Stadium during the first ODI, most of whom had come to see Rohit Sharma and Kohli return to action after more than seven months. Having retired from Tests and T20Is, the former captains returned to the ODI squad for the first time since winning the Champions Trophy on March 9.""When Rohit or (Shubman) Gill got out the other day (in Perth), and then Kohli came on, just the cheer when he was walking on — you'd feel pretty bad as the batter walking off. It's just an amazing experience,"" Short added.Both Rohit and Kohli looked rusty, scoring 8 and 0 respectively, as Australia’s stand-in skipper Mitchell Marsh led from the front with an unbeaten 46 to secure a seven-wicket win in the rain-affected match.India now trail the series 0-1, making Thursday’s Adelaide ODI a must-win to stay alive — and possibly the duo’s final outing in Australia.""But it's going to be a cool way for him to go out, especially with so many fans here in Australia,"" Short said.""It's pretty cool to share the field with such a legend of the sport. I'll definitely get the chance to have a chat to him at some stage throughout the series.""For Short, this white-ball series also serves as preparation for the 2027 World Cup in South Africa. The right-hander has faced injuries and fluctuating roles, from No.8 on debut to No.3 in the current series, and is still searching for form.""It's always going to be tough to get a spot in the XI and I'll sort of take whatever that is, whether it's opening, batting at three or wherever. It's just (about) staying flexible and trying to bat wherever you're put and be able to take that,"" he said.Meanwhile, left-arm seamer Ben Dwarshuis has been ruled out of the ODI series due to a calf injury but hopes to return for the T20Is starting October 29 in Canberra. The final ODI will be played in Sydney on Saturday.","Australia batter Matthew Short believes his team’s pacers will continue to target Virat Kohli outside off stump when India face Australia in the second ODI on Thursday.

A visibly frustrated Rohit lashed out at Gill while walking back to the dugout.Rohit had struck a powerful shot to mid-off off Fazalhaq Farooqi, but his partner was more focused on tracking the ball than calling for a run. Ibrahim Zadran collected the ball quickly and threw it to the striker’s end, catching Rohit off guard.Watch the video here The video shows clear frustration on Rohit’s face as he expressed his disappointment with Gill at the opposite end, highlighting the importance of coordination between India’s openers ahead of the crucial second ODI.Rohit became the fifth player from India to make his 500th international appearance after he featured in the Playing XI in the first ODI match in Perth.He became the fifth Indian player to achieve this milestone, following Sachin Tendulkar , Virat Kohli, MS Dhoni, and Rahul Dravid.","India take on Australia in the second ODI in Adelaide on Thursday.

Arshdeep Singh Press Conference After IND vs AUS 1st ODI: Praises Captain Gill, Backs Virat Kohli

NEW DELHI: Former Australian cricketer Matthew Hayden has urged Virat Kohli to steer clear of overthinking and self-arguments after his duck in the first ODI against Australia in Perth on Sunday. Kohli, playing his first ODI since March 2025, was caught behind playing outside the off-stump against Mitchell Starc.Hayden voiced strong faith in Kohli’s technique and overall approach, citing his wealth of experience in the format.""Virat Kohli's striking ability and contact points are exceptional. After scoring 14,000 runs in this format, there's little to question about his approach, as he consistently plays the ball on the rise and finds timing early,"" Hayden said on Star Sports.""One thing I hope he avoids is arguing with himself and overthinking, which can lead to mistakes. He is destructive when he has clarity, certainty, and the ability to read the game—qualities his experience provides,"" he added.Australia won the first ODI by seven wickets. The second match will be played on Thursday in Adelaide.India pacer Arshdeep Singh, meanwhile, defended Kohli’s performance and expressed his admiration for sharing the dressing room with the star batter.""He has played more than 300 matches for India, so form is just a word for him,"" Arshdeep said at the post-match media conference.""He knows how to get going. It is always like a blessing to be in the same dressing room with him, and going forward I feel there'll be a lot of runs for him in this series as well.""When asked about Kohli’s mindset while playing just one format, Arshdeep preferred to remain discreet.""....talking about the format he is playing, he has mastered this one. So I don't know how he feels about it. I will ask him about his feelings, and maybe tell you in the next press conference.""","Former Australian cricketer Matthew Hayden has urged Virat Kohli to steer clear of overthinking and self-arguments.

Women's World Cup prediction: Greenstone Lobo explains which team has best chance to win

Poll How do you feel about India's chances of qualifying for the semifinals? Confident Doubtful

SCENARIO 1 – WIN BOTH MATCHES:

India beat New Zealand and Bangladesh.

Result: India qualifies for the semifinals regardless of other outcomes.

SCENARIO 2 – LOSE TO NEW ZEALAND:

India lose to New Zealand.

Then, India hope New Zealand lose their final match against England.

India must beat Bangladesh to advance.

SCENARIO 3 – WIN vs NEW ZEALAND, LOSE vs BANGLADESH:

India beat New Zealand but lose to Bangladesh.

New Zealand must defeat England in their last match.

The team with the better net run-rate (India or New Zealand) will progress.

NEW DELHI: India’s Women’s World Cup campaign is hanging by a thread after another heart-wrenching defeat. Chasing 289 against England in Indore on Sunday, India fell just four runs short, marking their third consecutive loss in the tournament. England’s win secured them a semifinal spot, joining South Africa and Australia, leaving only one berth still up for grabs. India currently sit fourth in the points table with four points from five matches (NRR +0.526), while New Zealand, their main rival for the final semifinal place, also has four points but a lower net run-rate (-0.245).The defeat leaves India, co-hosts and pre-tournament favourites, on the brink of elimination, with their semifinal hopes dependent on the outcomes of the remaining two group matches.India will next face New Zealand on Thursday, followed by their final group clash against Bangladesh on October 26.A win in both matches would guarantee India a semifinal berth.If they lose to New Zealand, India will need the White Ferns to lose their final match against England and then beat Bangladesh to advance.There is also a third scenario: If India beat New Zealand but lose to Bangladesh, and New Zealand defeat England, the team with the better net run-rate will progress.Against England, India looked in control for much of the chase. Skipper Smriti Mandhana scored a commanding 88, while Harmanpreet Kaur contributed 70 and Deepti Sharma added 50.With India needing 56 runs off 54 balls and seven wickets in hand, the match appeared under control. But England fought back brilliantly to clinch victory. Heather Knight’s 109 off 91 balls, in her 300th international appearance, anchored England’s total of 288/8, with Amy Jones contributing 56.India’s bowlers triggered a late collapse, but Linsey Smith and Sophie Ecclestone sealed England’s triumph in the final overs.“It’s a bad feeling when you have put so much hard work in but the last 5-6 overs didn’t go according to the plan,” Harmanpreet said after the match. “Smriti’s wicket was the turning point for us. It’s a heartbreaking moment. Credit to England. They didn’t lose hope, they kept bowling and getting wickets.”","India's World Cup hopes hanging by a thread after another heart-wrenching defeat.

Poll Who was the standout performer for Pakistan on Day 2 of the Test match against South Africa? Asif Afridi Keshav Maharaj Saud Shakeel Tony de Zorzi

In a remarkable Test cricket display on Tuesday, 38-year-old debutant spinner Asif Afridi claimed two crucial late wickets against South Africa, who finished Day 2 at 185-4 in Rawalpindi, Pakistan . The Proteas trail Pakistan by 148 runs after Pakistan was dismissed for 333, with South African spinner Keshav Maharaj taking 7-102 on an abrasive wicket.Tristan Stubbs remained unbeaten on 68 off 184 balls, showcasing exceptional patience against Pakistan's spin attack. He formed a vital 113-run partnership with Tony de Zorzi, who scored 55 before falling to Afridi.Afridi's debut proved memorable as he first trapped de Zorzi leg before wicket, successfully overturning the on-field decision through a television review. He then quickly dismissed Dewald Brevis for a duck, with Salman Ali Agha taking a smart catch off the shoulder of the bat.The day began with Pakistan at 259-5, as Saud Shakeel and Agha extended their sixth-wicket partnership to 70 runs. Shakeel completed his half-century off 118 balls, pushing Maharaj to square leg for two runs.Maharaj, who missed the first Test due to a groin injury, dominated the morning session by taking the last five Pakistan wickets for just 15 runs. South Africa's fielding improved significantly from Day 1, with the team holding onto all their chances.Earlier in the South African innings, Shaheen Shah Afridi delivered an impressive opening spell, dismissing Ryan Rickelton for 14. Captain Aiden Markram scored 32 before being caught at long-on off Sajid Khan's bowling.Pakistan missed opportunities to dismiss both de Zorzi and Stubbs earlier in their innings. They failed to review a potential lbw decision against de Zorzi when he was on 5, while Khan couldn't hold onto a return catch from Stubbs.De Zorzi, following his century in the first Test, played more aggressively than his partner, reaching his fifty off 86 balls. Stubbs marked his half-century in style by hitting Khan for a straight six.The morning session saw Marco Jansen and Kagiso Rabada bowling tight lines, though they couldn't breakthrough before Maharaj's intervention. Maharaj's crucial spell included the dismissal of Agha, who missed a straight delivery that hit his shin.Maharaj continued his outstanding performance by finding the outside edge of Shakeel's bat, with Markram making amends for his previous day's drop by taking the catch. Shaheen Shah Afridi, recently appointed as Pakistan's ODI captain, was bowled by Maharaj without scoring.The South African bowling figures showed Maharaj's dominance with 7-102, while Simon Harmer took 2-75 and Rabada finished with 1-60. At stumps, wicketkeeper-batter Kyle Verreynne remained not out on 10 alongside Stubbs.The match remains delicately poised with South Africa still trailing by 148 runs on a pitch that continues to favor spin bowling.

Poll Do you think West Indies' strategy of using only spin bowlers was effective? Yes, it was a great tactic No, it backfired

In a historic first in One Day International cricket, West Indies deployed only spin bowlers for their entire 50 overs against Bangladesh in the second ODI at Dhaka's Shere Bangla National Stadium. The visitors, trailing 1-0 in the three-match series, used five spinners - Akael Hosein, Roston Chase , Gudakesh Motie, Khary Pierre, and Alick Athanaze - who bowled 10 overs each.The West Indies team, seeking automatic qualification for the 2027 ICC Cricket World Cup, made this unusual strategy on a dry, cracked pitch similar to the first ODI.Bangladesh managed to post 213/7 in their 50 overs, with Soumya Sarkar contributing 45 runs from 89 balls, including three fours and a six.A crucial seventh-wicket partnership between captain Mehidy Hasan Miraz and Rishad Hossain lifted Bangladesh from 163/7 in the 46th over. Miraz remained unbeaten on 32 from 58 balls with one four, while Rishad played an explosive innings of 39 not out from just 14 balls, hitting three fours and four sixes.For West Indies, Gudakesh Motie was the most successful bowler with figures of 3/65. Alick Athanaze impressed with 2/14 in his full quota of 10 overs, while Akael Hosein claimed 2/41.West Indies will be looking to bounce back after their disappointing performance in the first ODI, where they were bowled out for 133 while chasing 208 runs.","West Indies deployed only spin bowlers for their entire 50 overs against Bangladesh in the second ODI at Dhaka's Shere Bangla National Stadium.

Player Match Tournament/Format Date Days Gap Virat Kohli RCB vs PBKS IPL 3 June 138 days Rohit Sharma MI vs PBKS IPL 1 June 140 days Shreyas Iyer India A vs Australia A List A 5 October 14 days

Lack of real match practice for India’s star batters Virat Kohli Rohit Sharma , and Shreyas Iyer could hurt India’s ODI plans leading up to the 2027 World Cup. The recent Perth ODI against Australia was a small warning sign.Kohli, Rohit, and Iyer form India’s top four, but all three are currently playing only one format. Rohit and Virat have retired from T20Is and Tests, while Shreyas Iyer, who has taken a six-month break from red-ball cricket, is not part of India’s T20I setup for the upcoming World Cup in February next year.The Indian cricket team was slated to play 27 ODIs according to the ICC’s Future Tours Program (FTP) 2023–27. The three-match ODI series against Bangladesh, which was scheduled for August, has been postponed, and the first ODI at Perth was not a promising start for India’s quest for the 2027 ODI World Cup. Rohit, Virat, and Shreyas lasted just 46 balls between them, managing only 19 runs.Rohit and Virat were playing a competitive match after a gap of five months and looked rusty. Meanwhile, Shreyas, who has played for India A and in the Duleep Trophy, had his technical flaws exposed again. Both Josh Hazlewood and Mitchell Starc, who stand six feet six inches tall, have a high release point of almost 2.15 metres (nearly 7.05 feet).Whatever length they bowled, the duo generated extra bounce, with almost every ball hitting the top half of the bat. Perth was a bouncy track, and India’s top order looked all at sea.The ball that dismissed Rohit Sharma wasn’t particularly short, but it rose sharply to armpit height outside the off-stump, striking the upper portion of Rohit’s bat. He could have left it alone, but ended up poking at it. The unexpected bounce surprised him; yet it wasn’t due to the pitch — it was Hazlewood’s skill that gave it its sting.Virat Kohli, who registered his first duck on Australian soil, was also troubled by that length. Starc and Hazlewood had troubled Kohli in the past too. In 10 ODI innings, Hazlewood had dismissed Kohli five times — averaging a wicket every second innings. But it was Hazlewood’s new-ball partner, Starc, who sent Kohli back. Kohli went for a booming shot, chasing the ball away from his body, and Cooper Connolly, patrolling at backward point, took a spectacular catch. It was a shot born out of desperation to get off the mark, which we have rarely seen from Kohli in a format where he is an undisputed king.Meanwhile, Shreyas Iyer’s struggles against short-pitched balls are well documented. The newly appointed ODI vice-captain had been prolific in the last two 50-over ICC tournaments. In the Champions Trophy earlier this year, he was India’s leading run-getter with 243 runs in five innings. Iyer had hammered 530 runs during the 2023 ODI World Cup.He had been pivotal in India’s success in both tournaments, but in Perth, Hazlewood exposed a chink in Shreyas’ armour again. Relentless Hazlewood denied Shreyas any width, hitting the deck hard and creating an angle from a good length, which tangled Shreyas up. As he tried to adjust and negate the extra bounce, rising around his ribs, the ball ended up brushing his gloves.The three dismissals have raised eyebrows as the next World Cup will be held in South Africa, where pitches will be bouncy. India will play only two away ODI series to tackle the bounce factor: the ongoing three-match series against world champions Australia, and another against England in July 2026. However, the spice in English pitches has lessened, as it doesn’t suit their “Bazball” approach.In the case of Shreyas, he is playing for India A and, after taking a break from four-day cricket, will likely be available for Mumbai in the Vijay Hazare Trophy. But the big question is whether the two senior stars, Kohli and Rohit, will play domestic 50-over tournaments to stay match-ready. It doesn’t matter how hard they train in the nets; having played enough cricket, they know there is no substitute for real match scenarios.Since Rohit and Virat now play only one format, their rustiness was visible in the first outing. Playing just the IPL won’t guarantee them a spot in India’s 2027 ODI World Cup squad. If they want to pursue their broken November 19 dream and win the trophy in South Africa, they must play domestic cricket to stay match-fit. If they choose not to, they are doing a disservice to Indian cricket and their own reputations.After India’s Test series win against West Indies in New Delhi, coach Gautam Gambhir was asked , “Are Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli still part of India’s plans for the 2027 World Cup?”Gambhir said: “Look, the 50-over World Cup is still two-and-a-half years away, and it is very important to stay in the present. Obviously, they are quality players; their experience will be invaluable in Australia as well. Hopefully, those two will have a successful tour, and more importantly, the team will have a successful series.”Gambhir may have dodged the big question, but he knows the clock is ticking. If he and Shubman Gill want India to take a step forward in 2027, they will need their ageing superstars match-ready. If not, India must blood talents like Yashasvi Jaiswal and Tilak Verma, giving them limited matches to prepare for the 2027 ODI World Cup.","Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma and Shreyas Iyer produced paltry returns in the first ODI vs Australia in Perth.

Al-Nassr FC have confirmed that their captain, Cristiano Ronaldo , will not be part of the travelling squad that will arrive in India later tonight.

Goa police too had officially sought a status report on the Portugal superstar’s arrival.“Al-Nassr have informed FC Goa today that Ronaldo will not travel,” a source who has been tracking the development told TOI on Monday. “Even when FC Goa sought confirmation yesterday, they were asked to wait till today. The club is expected to make an official statement now.”Coach Jorge Jesus and the management believes it’s important to manage Ronaldo’s game time, particularly since the star is now 40 and keen to take part in next year’s FIFA World Cup 2026, which will be his record sixth appearance at the biggest sporting event on earth.Lothar Matthaus, Antonio Carbajal, Rafa Marquez, Gianluigi Buffon, Andres Guardado, Guillermo Ochoa and Lionel Messi are the others in the elite club of players with appearances at five different World Cups.Even without Ronaldo, Al-Nassr have done well in the AFC Champions League Two, winning both their games.

Liverpool faced their fourth consecutive defeat, a first in 11 years, as Manchester United secured a 2-1 victory at Anfield on Sunday. Harry Maguire scored the winning goal with a header in the 84th minute, giving United manager Ruben Amorim his first back-to-back Premier League wins.Cody Gakpo had equalised for Liverpool, cancelling out Bryan Mbeumo's early goal that came just 61 seconds into the match.Liverpool now trails Arsenal by four points at the top of the table. Manager Arne Slot continues to seek the right combination after spending £450 million on new players.United moved up to ninth place, now just two points behind Liverpool. This victory marks Amorim's most significant win in his nearly one-year tenure.Liverpool's previous dominance in this fixture was notable, having lost only one of their last 14 Premier League meetings. United hadn't won at Anfield since January 2016.Liverpool's current struggles follow a period of transition after rebuilding their title-winning squad. The team was also affected by the tragic loss of Diogo Jota in a July car accident.The match started poorly for Liverpool, who were already dealing with three consecutive losses under Slot.Mbeumo scored the opening goal, getting past Virgil van Dijk and finishing from Amad Diallo's pass.Liverpool protested the goal, arguing that play should have stopped when Alexis MacAllister suffered a head injury from Van Dijk.Slot kept £100 million signing Florian Wirtz on the bench again, trying to balance defensive and attacking needs.Gakpo nearly scored when his shot hit the post from Mohamed Salah's pass, in Liverpool's best first-half move.United missed an opportunity to extend their lead when Bruno Fernandes hit the post from the edge of the area.Liverpool's record signing Alexander Isak almost scored his first Premier League goal, but Senne Lammens made a crucial save.Gakpo was unlucky as his deflected cross hit the post, and he later hit the woodwork again early in the second half.Slot introduced Wirtz and Hugo Ekitike after an hour, joining Salah, Gakpo, and Isak in attack.Salah, despite his scoring record in this fixture, missed a clear chance when he shot wide with only Lammens to beat.Liverpool finally scored when Federico Chiesa, who had just replaced Isak, provided a low cross for Gakpo to convert from close range.United quickly responded as Maguire headed in Fernandes's cross, exposing Liverpool's defensive weaknesses.Gakpo had a late chance to equalize but headed wide from Jeremie Frimpong's cross.The defeat ended Liverpool's year-long unbeaten league run at Anfield, damaging their hopes of winning a record 21st English top-flight title.","Manchester United beat Liverpool 2-1 at Anfield on Sunday.

There weren't too many chances. I think overall it could've gone either way,"" Frank said.""I think 1-1 would've been a fair result. Villa scored two goals from outside the box in moments where you wouldn't expect them to score.Fair play for their moments of quality.

Substitute Ronald Araújo snatched Barcelona a 2-1 victory over Girona in stoppage time in La Liga on Saturday and ended a mini losing streak before the clasico at Real Madrid next week.The central defender made the move of a striker when he slid in front of his marker as they raced to the near post and skilfully redirected a low pass from Frenkie de Jong and ignited the home crowd.Araújo's last-gasp goal came moments after Barcelona coach Hansi Flick was sent off with two quick yellow cards apparently for complaining that the referee had not added more than four minutes of injury time.The sending off means Flick won't be on the sideline for the first clasico of the season.Before the international break, Barcelona lost to Paris Saint-Germain 2-1 in the Champions League and was stunned at Sevilla 4-1 in La Liga.Pedri González gave Barcelona the lead with an exquisite goal in the 13th, sliding an angled ball back across the area and inside the near post without looking at the target.But Barcelona's control collapsed after Axel Witsel equalized seven minutes later with an acrobatic bicycle kick to whip a loose high ball off the turf and past Wojciech Szczesny.Only Szczesny's saves and some poor marksmanship by Girona kept the visitors from taking the lead before halftime after it was able to mount repeated counterattacks after Barcelona lost possession.Girona then needed goalie Paulo Gazzaniga to turn back shots by Fermín López and Marcus Rashord before Araújo´s clinched the result.With Barcelona missing strikers Robert Lewandowski and Ferran Torres and playmaker Dani Olmo to injury, Flick gave a La Liga debut to 17-year-old forward Toni Fernández.

After achieving success in the 2023 Intercontinental Cup, SAFF Championship, and Tri-Nation Series, the team's performance has declined considerably.Their promising period, which had helped them reach the top 100 rankings, was followed by a disappointing AFC Asian Cup campaign in Qatar.

Igor Štimac was replaced by Manolo Márquez, who was later succeeded by Khalid Jamil.Under Jamil's leadership, the team showed some tactical improvements during the CAFA Nations Cup friendly tournament. However, their competitive match results have remained unsatisfactory.The team's most recent competitive victory was against Kuwait in November 2023, with a score of 1-0.In the global rankings, Spain maintains its position at the top, followed by Argentina and France in second and third places respectively.

Maxx Crosby and the Raiders: A long-term commitment



Why Trading Crosby doesn’t make sense now



The Las Vegas Raiders made it clear: Maxx Crosby is not going anywhere this season. Rumors swirled after reports suggested the Cowboys inquired about trading for the star edge rusher ahead of the Nov. 4 deadline. Despite interest from multiple teams, the Raiders met with Crosby to confirm that they have no plans to trade their defensive standout. After a rough 2–5 start, the Raiders remain committed to building around Crosby, who has expressed a strong desire to win in Las Vegas.Crosby, now in his eighth season, was drafted by the Raiders in the fourth round of the 2020 NFL Draft. This past offseason, Las Vegas reinforced their commitment to him by signing a three-year, $106.5 million extension. Trading Crosby might bring in valuable draft picks, but the Raiders recognize that NFL rebuilds don’t always follow a straight path. History shows that losing a team’s top player rarely leads to immediate success, as seen with the Cowboys without Micah Parsons or the Titans missing A.J. Brown.With Crosby anchoring the defense, the Raiders have a far better chance at a swift turnaround. Teams often go from worst to first within a season, and keeping Crosby gives Las Vegas the foundational star needed to attract other impact players.Even if fans are frustrated by the team’s early struggles, the Raiders are wisely holding onto their elite pass rusher while exploring other roster improvements around him.While Crosby would command a significant return—likely at least two first-round picks—trading him during a season under veteran head coach Pete Carroll doesn’t align with the Raiders’ strategy. Carroll, at 74, isn’t starting a rebuild from scratch. Crosby himself wants to stay, and the team can realistically aim for contention if the right free agents and draft picks fall into place.The Week 7 blowout loss to the Chiefs highlighted the team’s weaknesses, but the bye week gives the Raiders a chance to regroup. With a slightly easier schedule ahead and new pieces still adjusting, the team’s trajectory could improve quickly. If change becomes necessary, the Raiders can revisit trading Crosby in the offseason. Until then, their focus remains on keeping one of the league’s best pass rushers and building a competitive team around him.Also Read: Travis Kelce’s kind gesture with Taylor Swift moves little boy to tears amid ongoing 1587 Prime backlash","The Las Vegas Raiders have no plans to trade star edge rusher Maxx Crosby.

A.J. Brown’s cryptic message sparks fan frenzy

“Just throw the f—ing ball!”

Is A.J. Brown trolling the media — or sending a message?

playing

The Philadelphia Eagles should’ve been celebrating their hard-fought Week 7 victory over the Minnesota Vikings. Instead, headlines quickly shifted from their impressive 28-22 win to — what else — A.J. Brown’s latest social media post. The star wide receiver, fresh off a 121-yard, two-touchdown performance, managed to light up the internet with just one cryptic sentence: “Using me but not using me.”It’s not unusual for A.J. Brown to dominate on the field, but these days, his Instagram seems just as explosive. His latest post, short yet loaded with meaning, instantly triggered speculation about whether he’s frustrated with his role in the offense. After all, he caught four passes and turned them into game-changing plays — yet only had six targets.Adding to the intrigue, cameras caught Brown shouting,after scoring his second touchdown against Minnesota. The emotion was raw, and fans couldn’t help but wonder if the post was connected. Brown’s passion has always been his trademark, but it often walks the fine line between competitiveness and controversy.This isn’t the first time the All-Pro receiver has gone cryptic online. Earlier this season, he posted a Bible verse about handling frustration — then quickly deleted it. He’s also made comments hinting at dissatisfaction with the Eagles’ offensive scheme.

Tom Brady vs. Michael Jordan: Who truly mastered the art of retirement and legacy building?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/tom-brady-vs-michael-jordan-who-truly-mastered-the-art-of-retirement-and-legacy-building/articleshow/124713209.cms,"Tom Brady and Michael Jordan, sports icons, navigated life after retirement differently.

Brady's approach offers a new blueprint for athletes transitioning from competition to new ventures.

Michael Jordan’s post-NBA years: A perfectionist searching for purpose

Tom Brady’s evolution: From NFL legend to lifestyle mogul





The final verdict: Two legends, two paths to immortality

When it comes to sports legends, few names carry as much cultural weight as Tom Brady and Michael Jordan. Both transcended their games, redefining football and basketball through unmatched competitiveness, longevity, and success. Yet, as fans look beyond their championship eras, a new debate emerges: which icon handled life after greatness better?When Jordan retired (for the third and final time in 2003), his post-playing path was filled with both ambition and uncertainty. Ownership of the Charlotte Hornets gave him influence but not the same dominance he enjoyed as a player. While his Air Jordan brand remains a global empire worth billions, many argue that MJ struggled to channel his intensity outside the game.He was known for his insatiable will to win, something that, once the spotlight dimmed, became harder to satisfy. “I can’t accept not trying,” Jordan once said, reflecting the inner battle that followed his NBA exit. Even two decades later, his mystique remains untouchable, but his presence feels more mythic than personal, a reminder of a man still defined by his playing days.Brady’s post-football journey has been markedly different.After retiring (officially this time) in 2023, he approached his second act like a carefully scripted game plan.From TB12 and Brady Brand to Hollywood production deals and his Netflix Roast, he’s managed to reinvent himself while staying relatable. His self-deprecating humor and openness about challenges, including divorce, business setbacks, and personal growth, have humanized the seven-time Super Bowl champion.Brady once said, “I don’t think life stops when football stops, I think it’s just the next chapter.” That mindset has made him a model for modern athletes seeking longevity beyond competition.While Jordan built a legacy of mystique, Brady built one of evolution. One guarded his greatness like a secret; the other shared his with the world. In mastering retirement, Brady may not have changed the game like Jordan, but he changed what greatness looks like when the final whistle blows.Also Read: ""People are motivated for..."": Troy Aikman admits he was ‘caught off guard’ by fan outrage over his Caleb Williams comments","Tom Brady and Michael Jordan, sports icons, navigated life after retirement differently.

Broderick Jones says he'll tackle Aaron Rodgers again



Broderick Jones and the wider stakes for Sunday



A playful but charged moment from last week’s Steelers game has become the talk of the league. After Broderick Jones accidentally brought his quarterback Aaron Rodgers to the ground following a 68-yard touchdown, the 24-year-old offensive tackle told reporters he might do it again. “We shall see on Sunday after he throws another touchdown,” Jones said on Tuesday, Oct. 21. The rivalry, laughter and tension all head into Pittsburgh on Oct. 26.The clip that went viral shows Rodgers celebrating with his trademark “Mario” leap after the long pass to Pat Freiermuth. As Rodgers ran, Jones joined the celebration and unintentionally knocked him down. Rodgers, 41, looked visibly upset and shoved Jones when he stood back up.Still, Jones has not backed down. “I’m gonna tackle him again,” he told the media. He followed that with a softer note about their relationship. “Yeah we’re still joking about it,” Jones said on Tuesday. “Yeah he was a little mad, but sorry, you know, it’s football, it gets intense.” The exchange captures both the heat of the moment and the short memories teams must have to move forward during a long season. No love lost as always... He told me don’t lose the fire, and I told him the same. We'll see on Sunday, if he throws another touchdown, I might tackle him again.”Beyond a viral clip and banter, the incident matters for several reasons. First, it shows the emotional mix inside a team where a veteran like Rodgers meets a young teammate fresh from college. Jones acknowledged his respect for Rodgers and the competitive spark they share. “It’s just the energy that he brings and I bring,” Jones said.“He told me don’t lose the fire and I told him the same.” Second, this Sunday’s game in Pittsburgh brings added storyline weight: it will be Rodgers’ first matchup against the team where he spent 18 seasons. If Rodgers’ Packers lose, he could become only the fifth quarterback in NFL history to have beaten all 32 teams, a stat that adds drama to every play and every sideline scuffle.That mix of respect, rivalry and possible history makes the encounter more than a meme. It is a snapshot of what football asks from its players — keep pushing, laugh it off when you can, and be ready for the next big moment. Whether Jones follows through remains to be seen, but the conversation he started will keep eyes glued to Sunday’s kickoff.Also Read: Travis Kelce’s kind gesture with Taylor Swift moves little boy to tears amid ongoing 1587 Prime backlash",Broderick Jones accidentally knocked Aaron Rodgers to the ground during a touchdown celebration.

This relationship highlights her growth, showcasing intimacy built on safety, laughter, and mutual respect, marking a deeply human chapter.

From fairytales to self-awareness: Taylor Swift’s early lessons in love

Finding balance with Travis Kelce: Love without hiding

For nearly two decades, Taylor Swift has worn her heart on her sleeve not just in her music, but in the way she experiences love itself. What began as fairytale storytelling in her Fearless and Speak Now eras has transformed into a nuanced understanding of partnership, vulnerability, and balance. Her relationships, from her early romances to her current bond with Travis Kelce, reveal how fame has refined, not ruined, her capacity for connection.In her teens and early twenties, Swift’s songs painted love as both a dream and a disaster, the promise of “Romeo and Juliet” followed by the ache of heartbreak in “All Too Well.” These experiences mirrored the growing pains of someone learning how to love under a microscope.The world saw every heartbreak, every headline, every rumor and for a while, Swift’s love language was shaped by defense. She became selective, even cautious, using her music as both a diary and a shield.As she matured, however, Swift’s lens on love shifted inward. Albums like Lover and Folklore introduced emotional intelligence and patience, revealing a woman who had learned that affection isn’t about fireworks, it’s about understanding.“You are what you love,” she once said in an interview, reflecting her realization that love starts with self-acceptance before it can be shared.Now, with Travis Kelce, Swift seems to be in her most open and grounded relationship yet. For the first time, she’s blending her public and private worlds comfortably, appearing at NFL games, laughing in luxury boxes, and letting fans see her joy without the usual guarded distance. Kelce’s confidence and humor appear to complement her own growth perfectly.Fame once made love complicated for Taylor Swift. Today, it seems to have taught her something deeper: that real intimacy isn’t about secrecy or spectacle, but about safety, laughter, and mutual respect. And for a woman who has turned heartbreak into art, this chapter feels like her most human love story yet.Also Read: “Blake definitely won’t be among the guests”: Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce's massive wedding guest list includes everyone but former bestie","Taylor Swift's journey through love has evolved from fairytale narratives to a mature understanding of partnership.

A lighthearted moment before a strong comeback



San Francisco 49ers tight end George Kittle found himself in a hilarious situation before his team’s victory over the Atlanta Falcons on October 19.

What followed quickly became one of the weekend’s most talked-about NFL moments.Just before kickoff at Levi’s Stadium, cameras captured George, 32, making his way toward the friends and family section, calling out, “Where’s my wife?” When Claire didn’t appear, he didn’t let the moment go awkward.

Ike Hilliard’s firing and Ray-Ray McCloud III’s NFL career

Ray-Ray McCloud III has been released by the Atlanta Falcons. This comes just days after the team sent him home because of a private matter. Head coach Raheem Morris confirmed last Friday that Ray-Ray McCloud was told to leave team activities. He did not share the reason and called it a private issue. McCloud was then a healthy scratch for the Week 7 game against the San Francisco 49ers. Two days after that game, the Falcons released him from the roster.Raheem Morris said that sending McCloud home was not a punishment. He said it was not a disciplinary move but more of a football-related issue. McCloud practiced on Wednesday but missed Thursday and Friday practice for non-injury reasons.Raheem Morris said the team is still working through it and that it is strictly between McCloud and the organization. Ray-Ray McCloud had been Atlanta’s No. 3 wide receiver since last season.However, in the 2025 season, he had only six catches for 64 yards in four games. Last year, which was his first season with Atlanta, he caught 62 passes for 686 yards and one touchdown. He also returned 14 kickoffs and averaged 25.8 yards per return.The Falcons fired wide receivers coach Ike Hilliard after their 30-0 loss to the Carolina Panthers in Week 3. Hilliard was one of the main reasons McCloud signed with Atlanta in 2024.But Raheem Morris said Ray-Ray McCloud’s current situation has nothing to do with Hilliard being fired.

Why Maxx Crosby could be the fix Dallas needs

What a Crosby trade would mean for Dallas

The Dallas Cowboys are quietly making moves as the NFL trade deadline approaches, looking to strengthen their defense after a rocky start to the season. Sitting at 3-3-1 and fresh off a strong win against the Washington Commanders, Dallas is reportedly interested in adding a star pass rusher to help fix their defensive struggles. One name popping up in trade talks is Las Vegas Raiders’ edge rusher Maxx Crosby , widely considered one of the best at his position. The Cowboys have reportedly reached out to the Raiders to see if Crosby could be available.Former ESPN NFL analyst Trey Wingo shared that Dallas has already made contact with Las Vegas about a potential deal. “Breaking: according to sources, the Cowboys have made inquiries with the Raiders about a potential trade for Maxx Crosby,” Wingo posted on X. This is a surprising development given Dallas traded away their own young edge rusher, Micah Parsons, to the Green Bay Packers before the season started. Parsons was a key player for the Cowboys’ defense, and without him, Dallas has struggled to generate pressure and stop the run.Maxx Crosby recently signed a huge three-year, $106.5 million extension with the Raiders, making him one of the highest-paid edge rushers in the NFL.Although he’s two years older than Parsons, Crosby has been incredibly productive, racking up 63.6 career sacks, 153 quarterback hits, and 115 tackles for loss over seven seasons. This year alone, Crosby has four sacks, 10 tackles for loss, and nine QB hits in just seven games. Dallas’ defense has had trouble filling Parsons’ shoes, so adding Crosby could address many of their biggest issues.Bringing in Crosby would be a big move for Dallas, showing they are serious about fixing their defense and staying competitive this season. While the cost might be high, Crosby’s age could mean the price is not as steep as what the Cowboys paid for Parsons. Crosby’s leadership, motor and ability to impact games on every snap make him an ideal fit for a defense lacking identity since Parsons’ exit. His presence could elevate Dallas’ front seven and bring much-needed consistency to their pass rush.If the trade happens, Dallas would gain a proven pass rusher and likely improve their chances in the playoffs. Crosby’s experience and skill could be just what the Cowboys need to get back on track defensively.","The Dallas Cowboys have reportedly made contact with the Las Vegas Raiders about Maxx Crosby.

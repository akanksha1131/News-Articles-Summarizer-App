Growing up in Mohali, in a 2BHK flat, Shubman Gill ’s favourite pastime was copying his childhood hero -- Virat Kohli . He would try to imitate his walk, his cover drive, his celebration, and even played most of his early career with a red handkerchief tucked in his trousers.Around 8,782 kilometers from Mohali, in Pretoria, in the Brevis’ backyard, Dewald and his elder brother Reinardt, wearing Virat Kohli and AB de Villiers’ Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) jerseys, used to mimic both the legends with match simulations -- imagining themselves pulling off a heist for RCB.Brevis has had a similar trajectory to Gill. Like Gill, he was portrayed as the next “prince.”Both of them hit a wall. Form deserted them, critics came out with swords, but their heroes stood like rocks and kept backing them. Back in 2019, when Gill first entered the Indian dressing room in New Zealand, Kohli famously said: “I saw him bat in the nets and I was like 'wow -- I was not even 10 percent of that when I was 19.'”Similarly, De Villiers also helped Brevis in his early days. “I have been his mentor for about two years now and helped him with his batting and his attitude towards cricket,” De Villiers had told Netwerk24 in 2022, when the youngster burst onto the scene in the U19 World Cup.In the last couple of months, Gill, the anointed prince, found his feet in Test cricket, smashing 754 runs in his first Test series as captain. It was Kohli again who wrote a special message for his successor at No. 4: “Well played star boy. Rewriting history. Onwards and upwards from here. You deserve all this,” Kohli wrote after Gill scored a sublime 269 and 161 at Edgbaston.Likewise, earlier this week, when Brevis smoked a 41-ball hundred against Australia, De Villiers went gung-ho over his countryman’s knock and took a shot at the IPL teams, saying: “The boy can play.”Before Shubman Gill was appointed Team India’s Test captain, he wanted to prove himself in England. He practiced with the red Dukes, worked on his trigger movement, and sought help from his cricket-tragic father Lakhwinder Singh Gill.Gill Sr. reminded the youngster why he was such a prolific run-scorer at the age-group level and in the Ranji Trophy, and asked him to “go back to the basics.” A confident Shubman even predicted that he wanted to be the best batter in the Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy, and boy, did he walk the talk.For Dewald Brevis, it was his childhood coach Deon Botes -- who has played a massive role in the development of several South African cricketers, including AB de Villiers and Faf du Plessis.Botes, an Economics professor and former Director of Sport at Afrikaans Hoër Seunskool, more popularly known as Affies, shared how the child prodigy battled his dark phase and turned it around.“He went back to his basics. So, I think with the T20 game, he might have gone a bit loose technically,” Botes told“In T20 cricket, obviously power hitting plays a big role. And I think he got a bit stuck with that. Playing a bit more red-ball cricket in the domestic league, I think, helped him just to fine-tune his technique a bit. So, it just looks like the old Dewald Brevis that we knew. I think he’s basically gone back to what he knows works, and it’s been successful for him.”Last year, after Christmas, Brevis called Botes asking for help.“So, last year, on the 28th of December, he came back to me and we worked for three days on his game again. Just going back to the basics, to what he was used to,” shared Botes.“He just wanted to get back to basics, which we did. And we basically gave him a clearer mind of what he wanted to do. A lot of people talk to you and there’s a lot of noise about you, and at times, you kind of lose track of what you actually want to do and what works for you.“So, he came back to me at the end of last year to just get back to his roots, back to the basics, and to find the right way for him to score. It was tough, but we had lots of conversations and lots of sessions to work through it.”When asked whether playing too much T20 cricket had corrupted Brevis’ technique, Botes said: “He really wanted to play cricket at the highest level and to show his skills and abilities. So, I think it was never about that for him.“He just wanted to play and score runs and be good. That’s basically all. Somewhere in this process, he might have got a bit confused about what he wanted to do. Like I said, there’s a lot of noise around playing like that, with people talking to him as a youngster. It’s probably difficult for him to work out who to listen to and who not. But he can’t listen to everybody. So when he came back to me, it was just about having one voice and going back to what works for him. ”Botes feels his ward is ready to take all three formats by storm.“I think he can definitely play in all three formats for South Africa. He’s already played in two of them. So it’s just the 50-over game he hasn’t debuted in yet, but I think that will come now.“Yes, I think he’ll be successful in all three. I think Dewald would actually appreciate the long format, red-ball cricket. And I think he’s good enough to make it in all three formats,” he said.Every cricket lover has lived that moment, standing before a mirror, trying to mimic a hero’s batting stance or a bowler’s graceful run-up and release. Most imitations end in awkward copies, but a rare few manage to carry those borrowed styles all the way to the international stage. It’s the perfect embodiment of the saying: fake it till you make it.Experts often insist that a player’s trademark shot or bowling action is inimitable, something born of instinct and impossible to reproduce. Yet, some youngsters tune that noise out and keep practicing what inspires them.Take Virat Kohli and AB de Villiers, for instance. They have long been the blueprint for aspiring cricketers. And Shubman Gill and Dewald Brevis, their biggest admirers, seem to have unlocked that template. From cover drives to the lap shot, from the scoop to the front-foot punch, to the reverse sweep -- Gill and Brevis mirror the range of their idols with astonishing ease.","Dewald Brevis has had a similar trajectory to India's Shubman Gill.

Poll Which aspect of Bobby Simpson's game do you admire the most? His batting skills. His leadership qualities. His fielding ability.

Cricket was in chaos in 1977. Billionaire TV mogul Kerry Packer had lured Australia’s best, barring speed demon Jeff Thomson, for a never-before seen pro league cobbled from cricket’s reigning stars. The Australian board was forced to pull out a mothballed Bobby Simpson, then 41, to skipper the side against Bishan Singh Bedi’s touring India.The desperate decision turned out to be a masterstroke. Simpson, who passed away on Saturday at 89, not only skippered the squad filled with newbies with tactical acumen but also became the team’s leading run-scorer (539). Interestingly, he had played his last Test against MAK Pataudi’s India in 1968 and was making a comeback from retirement after nine long years.In the three Tests that Australia won of the five-match series, Simpson’s resolute batting was vital, indeed the difference between the two sides: 7 and 89 in Brisbane, 176 and 39 in Perth and 100 and 51 in Adelaide. In the two Tests he failed, Melbourne (2 and 4) and Sydney (38 and 33), India won handsomely.In both these games, Chandrashekhar’s googly had his number. Unlike in his prime when he batted as an opener, Simpson turned up in the middle-order for this series.The home side prevailed 3-2 but the series continues to be rated among the finest and closest that India was ever involved in. As Mihir Bose wrote in his book, ‘A History of Indian Cricket,’ “In a head-tohead confrontation with Packer’s circus, the traditional game proved that nothing could replace real Tests.”Praising Simpson, who also took four wickets in the series, TOI’s KN Prabhu wrote in a series analysis, “A man of his experience and character was needed to nurse the many fledglings in his charge to full stature – and how successful he was proved in his achievements.As a cricketer, Simpson always emphasised on fitness and was also regarded among the finest slip fielders of all time. He also epitomised grit.Writing for Sportsweek’s World of Cricket in 1978, renowned cricket writer Ray Robinson revealed that the Aussie captain’s century in the decisive fifth Test against India had come under exceptional circumstances. “Not till after the match did he (Simpson) reveal he batted with a broken little finger from a dropped catch in the fourth Test,” Robinson wrote.In his 62 Test career, Simpson struck 10 centuries. Of them four came against India, the other two in the 1968 series against Pataudi’s men. His overall Test average was close to 47, but his average against India was a little above 53. Clearly, he relished batting against quality spinners often using the pad to great effect.But in the famous Bombay Test in 1964, Simpson was at the receiving end when India wrenched out a nail-biting victory by two wickets on Dussehra day. “It was the most exciting Test seen in India since the 1948 (India vs West Indies in Bombay) one, some said the most exciting ever,” wrote Bose.Incidentally, not many know that Simpson was among the first to moot the idea of a cricket World Cup to secure the sport’s future.",Bobby Simpson passed away on Saturday at the age of 89. Simpson captained Australia against India in 1977. He was the team's leading run-scorer (539) and took four wickets in the series.

Poll What aspect of Jordan Cox's innings impressed you the most? The number of sixes he hit His strike rate of 296.55 The variety of shots played

Jordan Cox produced one of the most explosive batting displays seen in The Hundred as Oval Invincibles stormed to a record total of 226/4 before crushing Welsh Fire by 83 runs at The Kia Oval.The right-hander blasted 86 not out from just 29 deliveries, including 10 sixes, which equaled the competition’s individual record set by Liam Livingstone. His most spectacular moment came in the 11th over against Ajeet Singh Dale, where he hit him for 26 runs.Cox launched the first three balls for consecutive sixes, over long-on, deep mid-wicket, and again over mid-wicket respectively, before a wide and a dot briefly halted the charge. He finished the set in style, reversing his stance to scoop a full toss over short fine leg, a shot that had the crowd on its feet.Cox’s merciless attack, a rapid opening partnership of 76 between Tawanda Muyeye and Will Jacks, Sam Curran adding 34 in a 97-run partnership with the star of the night all meant that the Invincibles set multiple records in the process. In total, they cleared the ropes 17 times, the most ever in a Hundred innings.Remarkably, Cox had managed only eight runs from his first eight balls before starting to fire on all cylinders.Welsh Fire never recovered in the chase. Jason Behrendorff struck with his first delivery, and Cox added a highlight in the field by sprinting back from mid-on to dismiss Steve Smith. Some resistance came in the form of Jonny Bairstow, whose 50 off 28 balls helped, but Tom Curran’s 4/15 wrapped up the innings for 143 in 93 balls.The margin of defeat was the third largest in the competition’s history. More importantly, the total set by The Oval Invincibles (226/4) is the highest ever since its inception in 2021.","The Oval Invincibles set highest-ever The Hundred total of 226/4.

If it ain’t broke, don’t Gill it

NEW DELHI: Before Shubman Gill took flight to England for the recently concluded Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy, there were some doubts, rather apprehensions: whether Gill would be successful as a Test batter in English conditions or if he would prove to be a good captain.Gill answered them - perfectly. He scored 754 runs in five Tests, putting on an exhibition while also proving that he is more than capable of leading the team -- his composure during The Oval Test serves as a fitting example.With the Asia Cup and T20 World Cup the next big events, both to be played in the shortest format of the sport, there have been talks about not only bringing Gill back in the T20 side but also giving him the role of vice captain, as a precursor to succeed Suryakumar Yadav at some point.It is argued, in favour of Gill, that the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has always had a tradition of all-format captains and not the split captaincy, as is the case now.Also related is the rationale of brand value and commerce. After the retirement of Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma, two superstars of Indian cricket over the last decade and a half, there is an urge to build the next-gen ""brand"" of Indian Cricket.That Gill has become a major brand and favourite for broadcasters is a fact that not many would deny.While there is no question of Gill's place in One Day Internationals (ODIs), and he could even be the heir to Rohit as the leader of the side; to bring him into the T20 side, currently, however, would appear to be a forced decision rather than a natural one.By any measure, Shubman Gill is a decent T20 player. In 21 T20Is, Gill has scored 578 runs at an average of 30.42. He has also scored them at a strike rate of 139.27.While Gill is a generational batter with a sound technique, he is not a ""hitter"". A batter is someone who tries to score runs with less risk and build their innings. While the hitter is someone who tries to score as many runs on every ball as possible, playing high-risk shots.In T20s, where the value of runs scored quickly is more valuable than preserving wickets, teams across the world have been prioritising ""hitters"" over ""batters"".The Indian team took a long time to adopt this approach, but after the 2024 T20 World Cup, they are the ones spearheading it. The role of anchors - a category appropriate for Gill - has become redundant in modern T20s.In 2021 the percentage of balls attacked by Indian batters was 28.82 per innings, it almost doubled and went up to 43.84 per innings in 2024. Moreover, the number of attacking runs per innings also increased to 138.85 in 2024 from 98.64 in 2021.Gill's scoring rate of 139.27 is by no means bad. However, the current Indian top-order scores sit at a much higher strike rate.Playing what coach Gautam Gambhir described as ""high-risk, high-reward cricket"", Abhishek Sharma scores at an unreal strike rate of 193.84, his partner-in-crime Sanju Samson strikes at 152.38. While the new number three Tilak Varma scores at 155.07, Surya thrashes opposition bowling at 167.07.After the 2024 T20 World Cup, India’s top three batters have scored at a combined strike rate of 173.1. If Gill’s seven innings at 129.2 are removed from that period, the figure rises to 181.3.Moreover, in the eight innings where he faced 15 or more balls in all T20Is, only thrice has Shubman Gill scored the runs at or over the strike rate of 160. In comparison, Abhishek Sharma has faced more than 15 balls in six innings so far and in five of them, he has struck at 200 or above.While Tilak Varma scored at over 160 strike rate in six out of 15 innings in which he faced 15 or more balls, Suryakumar Yadav hit the ball at over 160 strike rate in 24 out of 40 such innings. Only Sanju Samson falls behind a bit in this context, but even he has scored at an above 160 strike rate in three out of five occasions where he faced 15 or more balls since the start of 2024.The current Indian T20 side is well settled and is reaping results, having won 14 of the 17 matches after the 2024 World Cup. Much of that success comes from an all-out attacking approach by the top-order that matches the demands of modern T20 cricket. Gill’s style of play does not match this template.Since the 2024 World Cup, the new group of hitters and the team management have taken the attacking game to another level. In this short period, India have scored three of their fastest T20I hundreds.If the team management wants a backup opener for Abhishek and Sanju, the right option could be Yashasvi Jaiswal, who has scored at 170.00 in the six matches he has played after the 2024 World Cup.ALSO READ: Devil lies in action: What makes Jasprit Bumrah injury-prone - why his workload management is crucial Indian cricket took far too long to realise that T20 is a game of ""hitters"". It took too long to realise and implement the theory that in T20 games, a specialist T20 batter is far better than an all-format batter who plays an anchor role.That change has finally created a team that can truly represent a country with the world’s most competitive T20 league. Forcing Gill into the T20 side at this moment would be less about cricketing needs and more about fitting a ""star"" into a system that is already firing without him.","Gill scored 754 runs in five Tests, putting on an exhibition while also proving that he is more than capable of leading the team.

EXCLUSIVE | Harbhajan Singh on Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, Shubman Gill, India vs Pakistan and more

Former Indian cricket legends Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma recently announced their retirements from Test cricket within a five-day gap, breaking the traditional pattern of gradual transitions in Indian cricket. Former Indian cricketer Karsan Ghavri has claimed that internal politics within the BCCI and the selection committee led by Ajit Agarkar forced both players to retire prematurely, despite their desire to continue playing the longest format.The retirement announcements came unexpectedly, with Rohit first announcing his departure through an Instagram Story, followed by Kohli's official announcement two days later through an Instagram post.The sudden retirements raised questions among fans and cricket observers, especially given that both players had indicated plans to continue in Test cricket. Kohli had returned to play Ranji Trophy for Delhi and expressed intentions to score multiple centuries in England, while Rohit had discussed his anticipation for the Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy in conversations with Michael Clarke during the IPL break.Karsan Ghavri, who played 39 Tests and 19 ODIs for India and opened bowling with Kapil Dev in the 1970s, has provided insights into the situation through his statements on the Vickey Lalwani Show.""He [Kohli] should have definitely continued playing for India easily, probably for another couple of years. But something really forced him to retire. And unfortunately, when he retired, he was not even given a farewell by the BCCI.Such players, such a great player who has done such great service to BCCI, India cricket and Indian fans, should be given a grand and fabulous farewell.""Kohli concluded his Test career as India's fourth-highest run-getter, falling short of 10,000 runs in the format. During his 14-year career, he became India's most successful Test captain with 40 wins, including India's first series victory in Australia during the 2018-19 Border-Gavaskar Trophy.Rohit Sharma's Test career experienced a revival after he began opening in September 2019, though it never reached the heights of Kohli's achievements.""It's due to internal politics within the BCCI, which is hard to understand. And I think this is the reason he retired prematurely. Even Rohit Sharma retired prematurely. They were asked to go out. It's not like they wanted to leave. They wanted to continue. But the selectors and BCCI had different ideas. It was a matter of some kind of petty politics,"" Ghavri stated.This departure marks a significant shift from the traditional retirement pattern in Indian cricket, where players like Sourav Ganguly, Rahul Dravid, VVS Laxman, Sachin Tendulkar, and Virender Sehwag retired gradually over several years between 2008 and 2014.",Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma announced their retirement from Test cricket within a five-day gap.

Australian cricket has lost one of its great figures with the passing of former captain and coach Bob Simpson at the age of 89. Cricket Australia confirmed the news on Saturday.Simpson was a central figure in the game for decades. He played 62 Tests for Australia between 1957 and 1978, scoring 4,869 runs at an impressive average of 46.81 while also taking 71 wickets. As captain, he led his country in 39 Tests and guided them to 12 victories.In one of the most remarkable chapters of his career, Simpson returned from retirement at the age of 41 to captain a depleted Australian side during the challenging years of World Series Cricket.After hanging up his boots, Simpson went on to become Australia’s first full-time coach. He took charge of a struggling team that had gone four years without a Test series win and turned them into a dominant force.Under his leadership, Australia lifted the 1987 World Cup, won four Ashes series and finally claimed the Frank Worrell Trophy in 1995, ending a 17-year wait for success against the West Indies.Simpson stepped down after the 1996 World Cup but continued to serve Australian cricket as a national selector. His contributions were formally recognised in 2013 when he was inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame.Bob Simpson’s impact went far beyond numbers. He was a leader, a teacher and a pioneer who helped shape the modern Australian team into the powerhouse it became.","Bob Simpson has passed away at the age of 89.

Poll Who do you think had the upper hand in the Pathan-Afridi rivalry? Irfan Pathan Shahid Afridi Both were equally matched

NEW DELHI: Former India all-rounder Irfan Pathan has opened up about his long-standing on-field rivalry with Pakistan’s Shahid Afridi , recalling both the personal barbs and the cricketing battles that defined their encounters.Pathan, who had immense success against Pakistan in his career — taking 67 wickets and scoring 807 runs, including a century — dismissed Afridi 11 times across formats, including a golden duck in the 2007 T20 World Cup final. Speaking on Lallantop, the former left-arm pacer revealed how the rivalry turned personal early on.“Dismissed him 11 times. I have a different kind of fight with him [Afridi] because when I was new and young in the team… there was an interview of Afridi with Harsha Bhogle,” Pathan said. “Afridi had said, ‘I am the real Pathan, he is a fake Pathan’. Badtameez aadmi hai. Mujhe laga ki aap sirf mere baare mein nahi bol rahe ho, mere waalid ke baare mein bhi baat kar rahe, jo aapko nahi karna chahiye tha.”Pathan admitted the comment fueled his determination whenever he bowled to Afridi. “Toh jab jab mere haath mein ball tha, mere jahan mein yeh tha ki isko toh main out kar dunga. Maine out karke usko gyara baar bata chuka hoon ki asli Pathan kaun hai.Bade bade maukon mein out kiya hai — series decider mein, World Cup final mein,” he added.The rivalry also played out off the field. Pathan recalled a heated exchange during India’s 2006 tour of Pakistan when both teams were traveling by flight from Karachi to Lahore. “Afridi came and placed his hand on my head, messing up my hair. He asked me, ‘How are you kid?’ I said, ‘Since when have you become my father?’ The childish behaviour was actually his,” Pathan recounted.What followed was a verbal spat, with Pathan landing the sharper wordplay. “I said, ‘He (Afridi) has eaten dog meat, he has been barking for a long time.’ After that, Afridi couldn’t say anything. Whatever he might have said, I would have just said, ‘Look, he is barking again.’ From that moment, he understood he could not win against me verbally,” Pathan explained.For Pathan, Afridi’s remarks may have crossed a line, but the Indian all-rounder believes his performances on the field offered the most fitting reply. “I showed him who the real Pathan is — not once, but 11 times.”","Former India all-rounder Irfan Pathan has opened up about his long-standing on- field rivalry with Pakistan’s Shahid Afridi.

How and why Rishabh Pant's England tour could come to an abrupt end due to toe fracture

'The breakup of the Serious Injury Replacement rule'

Deliberate short run

Retiring batsman

MUMBAI: In a historic move in the light of injuries to Rishabh Pant and Chris Woakes which initially ruled them out of the fourth and fifth Tests in the Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy recently, the Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ) has introduced a 'Serious Injury Replacement' clause in its playing conditions for the multi-day matches in the 2025-26 domestic season, which will allow teams to replace a player who can take no further part in the match due to an injury with another like-for-like player, just like in the case of the concussion substitute rule, which was introduced a few years back in international cricket.“This rule is being implemented by the BCCI at the ICC's behest for one season in India's multi-day domestic cricket-basically first-class matches. The rule to replace a like-for-like is only for external injury, and was explained to the domestic umpires during an ongoing seminar for them recently in Ahmedabad,"" a source told TOI. The new injury replacement rule applies in the Duleep Trophy, Irani Cup and the Ranji Trophy, Cooch Behar Trophy (for Under-19) and Col CK Nayudu Trophy (for Under-23).However, no such injury replacement will be allowed by the BCCI in domestic white-ball cricket tournaments - Syed Mushtaq Ali or Vijay Hazare tournament.Presently, the International Cricket Council's playing conditions allow teams to make replacements if a player is concussed or contracts Covid-19, but there is no scope to replace an injured player, something which other sports normally allow. While there is no serious injury replacement rule in international cricket as of now, the new clause being introduced by the BCCI in India's domestic cricket for the upcoming season is part of the International Cricket Council’s pilot run in this regard.In fact, the BCCI is the first full member to introduce this rule.“A player who suffers a serious injury on the field of play at any time after the match has started (including any pre-match warm-up period) may be replaced for the remainder of the match by a fully participating like-for-like player,” the ICC had said in a statement last on June 25.The newly-introduced rule is mentioned in the playing conditions (TOI has a copy) for domestic multi-day format matches for the 2025-26 season which were sent by the BCCI to the state associations recently, and will be effective immediately from the upcoming Duleep Trophy, which will kick off from Aug 28.Under clause 1.2.8, which has a subhead with 'Serious Injury Replacement,' it has been mentioned that ""If a player sustains a serious injury during the course of the relevant match, a Serious Injury Replacement may be permitted in the following circumstances."" the newly-introduced rule in the Playing Conditions states.“The serious injury must have been sustained during play and within the playing area described in clause 1.2.5.2 above. The injury must have occurred due to an external blow and result in fracture / deep cut / dislocation etc. The injury should render the player unavailable for the remainder of the match.”“1.2.8.1.2 (The) On Field umpires shall be the final authority to decide on the extent of serious injury and allowability of Serious Injury Replacement. They may consult the BCCI Match Referee and / or doctor available on ground.”In the first innings of the Old Trafford Test, Pant fractured his foot while trying to reverse sweep a Chris Woakes yorker, while Woakes dislocated his shoulder. Both, though, gallantly shrugged off their injuries and walked into bat for the sake of their, despite experiencing extreme pain. While many fans appreciated their bravery, there were calls for a replacement rule to be introduced, lest players aggravate their injuries.After Pant had to retire hurt in the first inning of the Old Trafford Test, India's head coach Gautam Gambhir had called for the introduction of injury replacements in Test cricket, a stance which England captain Ben Stokes said he considered ""absolutely ridiculous"".""Absolutely, I'm all for it. If the umpires and the match referee sees and feels that is a major injury, I think it's very important. It's very important to have this rule where you can get a substitute - that is, if it's very visible. There's nothing wrong in doing that, especially in a series like this where it's been such a closely fought series in the previous three Test matches. Imagine if we would've had to play with ten men against 11. How unfortunate would this be for us,"" Gambhir had said.Post Pant's injury, India were able to use Dhruv Jurel, a substitute, as their wicketkeeper in Pant's place, but he was not eligible to bat in their second innings.However, Stokes had said that the conversation should be ""shut down and stopped"" because any proposal ""would have too many loopholes"" for the teams to exploit. ""I think it's absolutely ridiculous that there's a conversation around an injury replacement. I think that there would just be too many loopholes for teams to be able to go through. You pick your XI for a game; injuries are part of the game. I completely understand the concussion replacement - player welfare, [and] player safety. But I think the conversation should just honestly stop around injury replacements because if you stick me in an MRI scanner, I could get someone else in straightaway. If you stick anyone else with an MRI scanner, a bowler is going to show, 'oh yeah, you've got a bit of inflammation around your knee; oh sweet, we can get another fresh bowler in'. I just think that conversation should be shut down and stopped,"" Stokes had said.The BCCI has elaborately laid out the procedure for an injury replacement (given below) and said the match referee will be the final authority who will decide after consulting a doctor and on-field replacement on the extent and seriousness of the injury.1.2.8.1 If a player sustains a serious injury during the course of the relevant match, a Serious Injury Replacement may be permitted in the following circumstances:1.2.8.1.1 the serious injury must have been sustained during play and within the playing area described in clause1.2.5.2 above. The injury must have occurred due to an external blow and result in fracture / deep cut / dislocation etc. The injury should render player unavailable for remainder of the match.1.2.8.1.2 Onfield umpires shall be final authority do decide on extend of serious injury and allowability of Serious Injury Replacement. They may consult BCCI Match Referee and / or doctor available on ground.1.2.8.1.3 the Team Manager shall submit a Serious Injury Replacement Request to the BCCI Match Referee on a standard form, which shall:1.2.8.1.3.1 identify the player who has sustained the serious injury.1.2.8.1.3.2 specify the incident in which the serious injury was sustained, including the time at which it occurred.1.2.8.1.3.3 confirm that, the player has sustained a serious injury and will not be able to participate further in the match due to the injury; and1.2.8.1.3.4 identify the requested Serious Injury Replacement, who shall be like-for-like replacement for the player who has sustained the serious injury.1.2.8.1.3.5 In all circumstances serious injury replacement player shall be from nominated substitutes at the time of toss (For Col C K Nayudu Trophy from the time of nomination of players). Only in the case where wicket-keeper is seriously injured and needs a replacement then Match Referee may allow a wicket-keeper from player outside the nominated substitutes if there is no wicket-keeper in the nominated substitutes.1.2.8.2 The Serious Injury Replacement Request must be submitted to the BCCI Match Referee as soon as possible after the incident specified in clause 1.2.8.1.3.2 if a Serious Injury Replacement is to be permitted.1.2.8.3 The BCCI Match Referee should ordinarily approve a Serious Injury Replacement Request if the replacement is a like-for-like player whose inclusion will not excessively advantage his team for the remainder of the match.1.2.8.4 In assessing whether the nominated Serious Injury Replacement should be considered a like-for-like player, the BCCI Match Referee should consider the likely role that the seriously injured player would have played during the remainder of the match, and the normal role that would be performed by the nominated Serious Injury Replacement.1.2.8.5 If the BCCI Match Referee believes that the inclusion of the nominated Serious Injury Replacement, when performing their normal role, would excessively advantage their team, the BCCI Match Referee may impose such conditions upon the identity and involvement of the Serious Injury Replacement as he/she sees fit, in line with the overriding objective of facilitating a like-for-like replacement for the seriously injured player.For clarity, a Serious Injury replacement will inherit all warnings, penalty time and suspensions that were imposed on the replaced player.1.2.8.6 The BCCI Match Referee may, in reviewing a Serious Injury Replacement Request made in accordance with clause 1.2.8.1.3 request any such further information as may be required in order to make the determination required under clauses 1.2.8.4 and 1.2.8.5.1.2.8.7 The decision of the BCCI Match Referee in relation to any Serious Injury Replacement Request shall be final and neither team shall have any right of appeal.1.2.8.8 Once the Serious Injury Replacement has been approved by the BCCI Match Referee, the replaced player shall take no further part in the match.1.2.8.9 Both the Serious Injury Replacement and the replaced player shall be considered to have played in the match for records and statistical purposes.A deliberate short run is an attempt for batters to appear to run more than one run, while at least one batter deliberately does not make good their ground at one end. Batters may choose to abort a run, provided the umpire believes that there was no intention by the batter concerned to deceive the umpires or to score the run in which they didn't make their ground.- request the captain of the fielding side to identify which of the two batters will take strike for the next delivery.25.4.3 If a batsman retires for any reason other than as in clause 25.4.2, he will be considered as dismissed immediately and will not have the option of returning to bat even with the consent of the opposite captain. His innings will be recorded as 'Retired - out'.","The Board of Control for Cricket in India has introduced a 'Serious Injury Replacement' clause in its playing conditions for the 2025-26 domestic season.

NEW DELHI: For Karun Nair, the recently concluded Anderson–Tendulkar Trophy in England was a bittersweet experience. The India batter, who travelled with a mountain of domestic runs behind him, returned with 205 runs from eight innings at an average of 25.62. The top score of 57 at The Oval was his lone half-century, but what truly rankled were the missed chances: scores of 40, 31, 26 and 21 — good starts that fizzled out.“I was batting really well throughout the series and I was getting starts in most games. But I was just not able to convert it, which was frustrating for me more than anyone else,” Nair admitted to PTI. “The one lesson I’ve reflected upon is making sure that I convert the start that I get. I’ve spoken to a lot of people about it, and I’m going to work on it very soon.”Yet, the 33-year-old takes pride in being part of a side that fought England to a 2–2 draw. “Not many teams have gone to England and levelled the series in five Tests. I’m really proud to be part of this amazing team,” he said.Nair credited skipper Shubman Gill and head coach Gautam Gambhir for fostering clarity and resilience. “The best part was that the messaging was clear.We showed that we never give up, and the attitude was to always keep fighting. You could see that on the field,” he noted.Back in India, Nair’s immediate focus will be Karnataka, where he returns after two seasons with Vidarbha. “It was a tough decision to leave, but due to personal reasons I had to. Now it’s about helping Karnataka and guiding the youngsters whenever needed,” he said.Currently leading Mysore Warriors in the KSCA Maharaja Trophy, Nair insists his eyes are set firmly on improvement. “For me, it’s about working on myself day by day and improving every single day on my skills and fitness,” he said.","India batsman Karun Nair returned with 205 runs from eight innings at an average of 25.62.

South African young batsman Dewald Brevis, also known as ""Baby AB"", achieved the fastest T20I fifty for his country against Australia in the third T20I series decider at Cazaly's Stadium on Saturday. His explosive innings featured numerous shots, living up to his nickname 'Baby AB'.Brevis reached his half-century in just 22 balls, surpassing his own previous record of 25 balls set during the second T20I in Darwin earlier this week. JP Duminy previously held the record with a 31-ball fifty scored in Melbourne in 2009.The 22-year-old's performance also broke the record for the quickest fifty against Australia on their home soil, beating Ravi Bopara's 23-ball effort in Hobart in 2014. His innings ended in the 12th over when Nathan Ellis dismissed him, affecting South Africa's momentum.Brevis started his innings aggressively, scoring his first boundary with a hard cut shot. He then hit Josh Hazlewood for a six off a short-length delivery with a top edge.He showcased his batting prowess against Aaron Hardie with two impressive no-look shots for sixes.One sailed over the boundary rope, while the other cleared long-on.Brevis continued his assault on Hardie, hitting two more sixes. He first shuffled across the crease for a six, then hit over deep cover for his fourth consecutive maximum to reach his fifty.Ellis eventually dismissed Brevis for 53 off 26 balls with a slower short-length delivery. Glenn Maxwell completed the catch while running to end Brevis's innings.In the previous match, Brevis had scored an unbeaten 125 from 56 balls in Darwin. His century came in 41 balls, making it the second-fastest for South Africa, behind only David Miller's 35-ball hundred against Bangladesh in 2017.","Dewald Brevis reached his half-century in just 22 balls, surpassing his own previous record of 25 balls set during the second T20I in Darwin earlier this week.

NEW DELHI: With the Indian selectors set to announce the Asia Cup 2025 squad on Tuesday, August 19, former India batter Mohammad Kaif has created a stir with his own team prediction.Sharing his thoughts on his YouTube channel, Kaif made a surprising call by including Test captain Shubman Gill in the 15-member squad but leaving him out of the playing XI.Gill, who has been one of India’s most consistent batters across formats in recent years, finds himself on the bench in Kaif’s set-up. Instead, Kaif backed Sanju Samson and Abhishek Sharma as his opening pair, with Tilak Varma slotted at No. 3. India’s T20 captain Suryakumar Yadav was Kaif’s choice to lead the side, with Axar Patel named as vice-captain — another unusual pick that sparked debate among fans.Kaif’s middle and lower order featured Hardik Pandya, Shivam Dube, Washington Sundar, and Kuldeep Yadav, while the pace attack was led by Jasprit Bumrah, supported by Arshdeep Singh and Mohammed Siraj.For the bench, Kaif listed Gill, Siraj, Jitesh Sharma, and Varun Chakaravarthy, meaning the Test captain, Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy’s star pacer, a wicketkeeper-batter, and a mystery spinner all missed out from his preferred XI.Kaif justified his bold selection by stressing the need for balance and versatility in the shortest format, highlighting Samson’s attacking ability at the top and Abhishek’s recent all-round performances. His choices, however, have already triggered strong reactions, particularly given Gill’s stature and recent form.As the Ajit Agarkar-led selection committee finalises its squad, all eyes will be on whether Gill not only makes the cut but also secures vice-captaincy in India’s squad for the Asia Cup.","Mohammad Kaif has named his India squad for the Asia Cup 2025.

Poll Which player had the biggest impact in Manchester City's victory over Wolves? Tijjani Reijnders Erling Haaland Rayan Cherki Someone else

Manchester City began their Premier League campaign in emphatic fashion, crushing Wolves 4-0 at Molineux on Saturday, as newcomers Tijjani Reijnders and Rayan Cherki made instant impacts.Reijnders, a summer signing from AC Milan, was involved in three of the goals, showcasing the creativity Pep Guardiola wanted in order to replace Kevin De Bruyne. The Dutch midfielder assisted Erling Haaland’s opener with a cheeky flick in the 34th minute, before scoring himself three minutes later with an accurate strike into the bottom corner.He continued to control the game, combining with Oscar Bobb to set up Haaland’s second just past the hour. France international Cherki added the finishing touch, curling home from distance soon after coming on as a substitute.Tottenham also impressed, easing past Burnley 3-0 at home. Richarlison struck twice, both set up by Mohammed Kudus from the right flank, including a spectacular scissor kick for his second. Brennan Johnson added a third from Pape Sarr’s through ball to secure a comfortable win for last season’s Europa League champions.At Villa Park, Newcastle failed to take advantage of their dominance in a goalless draw against Aston Villa. Without striker Alexander Isak, who continues to push for a move away, the visitors lacked a cutting edge.New signing Anthony Elanga looked lively, but Villa held firm despite being reduced to 10 men when Ezri Konsa was dismissed for denying a goalscoring chance.Promoted Sunderland stunned West Ham with a 3-0 victory at home. Eliezer Mayenda and Dan Ballard both scored headers in the second half before Wilson Isidor sealed the result in stoppage time.Brighton looked set for three points when Matt O’Riley converted a penalty in the 55th minute after Sander Berge fouled Georginio Rutter. But deep into added time, Fulham snatched a draw as Rodrigo Muniz pounced on a corner to equalize in the 96th minute.Earlier in the day, the Premier League held moments of silence and applause across grounds in memory of Diogo Jota, the former Liverpool and Wolves forward who recently died in a car crash alongside his brother. Wolves fans displayed a large tifo and chanted his name in the 18th minute, honoring the number he wore for the club.The tributes followed Friday’s emotional scenes at Anfield, where Liverpool supporters remembered Jota in the club's 4-2 win over Bournemouth. That game was however, marred by alleged racial abuse directed at Bournemouth’s Antoine Semenyo, who later thanked the football community for its support.","Manchester City beat Wolves 4-0 at Molineux.

Barcelona’s 3-0 win over Mallorca in La Liga on Saturday was overshadowed by a shocking incident involving debutant goalkeeper Joan García, who was on the receiving end of a brutal challenge.The 24-year-old, playing his first league game for the Catalan side, was struck in the face by Mallorca striker Vedat Muriqi in the 36th minute at Son Moix. Muriqi, stretching to reach a loose ball, raised his boot dangerously high and caught García full on the face. The impact stunned players and fans alike, with silence briefly falling over the stadium.Initially, play continued, but referee intervention followed after a VAR review. The footage confirmed the severity of the foul, and Muriqi was shown a straight red card. The expulsion left Mallorca further crippled, having already lost Manu Morlanes to a red card just three minutes earlier. Reduced to nine men before halftime, the home side’s chances of getting a result plummeted.The challenge quickly became one of the talking points of the match. Clips of the incident became viral immediately, with many labeling it among the most reckless fouls seen in La Liga in recent times.For García, it was a debut that will be remembered less for his contributions in goal and more for the violent moment that marked it. Despite the scare, he remained solid, maintained a clean sheet and was called on to make just one save.As for the match itself, Raphinha opened the scoring for the visitors, Ferran Torres doubled the lead, and teenage star Lamine Yamal sealed the result late with a spectacular strike. The win added three points to Barcelona’s tally, but the evening will be recalled above all for the shocking blow García suffered in his first La Liga appearance.","Joan García was struck in the face by Mallorca striker Vedat Muriqi in the 36th minute at Son Moix.

Bournemouth captain Adam Smith called the incident “unacceptable,” while head coach Iraola said, “It’s a big shame, most of the news will be about this thing.

Anfield was filled with emotion on Friday night as Liverpool paid a heartfelt tribute to Diogo Jota and his brother, Andre Silva, before their Premier League opener against Bournemouth. It was the first competitive game at the stadium since the two Portuguese footballers tragically lost their lives in a car accident last month.Before kick-off, the entire stadium stood in silence. Fans held up placards to form “DJ20” and “AS30” in two stands, while both sets of players stood arm-in-arm in the centre circle. A large banner in The Kop sent a message of comfort to Jota’s wife, Rute Cardoso, and their three children: “Rute, Dinis, Duarte, Mafalda – Anfield will always be your home. You’ll Never Walk Alone.”Liverpool manager Arne Slot, his staff, and all players wore black armbands. A picture of Jota and Silva appeared on the big screen, while “You’ll Never Walk Alone” rang out with scarves, flags, and banners waving in their memory.The match itself was a rollercoaster. Liverpool took the lead through Hugo Ekitike and Cody Gakpo, but Bournemouth’s Antoine Semenyo struck twice to level, despite earlier reporting racial abuse from a spectator. Federico Chiesa’s late goal and a stoppage-time strike from Mohamed Salah sealed a 4-2 win for the Reds.The emotion peaked after the final whistle. Salah, who had mimicked one of Jota’s celebrations after scoring, stood in front of The Kop in tears as supporters sang Jota’s name. Slot later described the tribute as “impressive and powerful.”Jota spent five seasons at Liverpool, winning the Premier League , FA Cup, and League Cup.

What’s common between the three Formula E world champions

How the three World Champions fared in Formula E Season 11

Days after Oliver Rowland lifted his Formula E World Championship trophy in London this season, an interesting trend has come to the attention of Formula E and its fans. As a coincidence, all Formula E drivers who won the Mexico City E-Prix went on to win the Formula E World Championship that season, and this has been proved right for three consecutive years.Highlighting the same since 2023, a poster of three World Champions was shared on X by Formula E with the caption, “The trend continues. Each winner of the #MexicoCityEPrix from the past three seasons has gone on to become World Champion.”The special poster features 2023 Formula E World Champion Jake Dennis from Andretti, then TAG Heuer Porsche’s Pascal Wehrlein, who won in 2024, and the new World Champion, Nissan driver Oliver Rowland. All three of them won in the Mexico E-Prix and went on to lift the winner’s trophy in the Formula E World Championship that year.Oliver Rowland had strengthened his chances of winning the Formula E World Championship this year much earlier. He was leading the Formula E Driver Standings ever since he won Part 2 of the Jeddah E-Prix, which was his second win of the season after winning the Mexico E-Prix. In the last leg, the Nissan driver got nervous for a while as Pascal Wehrlein, who was following him in the number two position, closed the gap after grabbing quite a few podiums while Rowland had a dull period.Things became serious for Rowland when he failed to finish the Round 13 race in Berlin, while Wehrlein won second spot on the podium. But he eventually managed to confirm his championship in Berlin after four wins and three more podiums.Sharing about his bad race in Berlin, Rowland had said, “I was hoping before the weekend that the outcome could be [the World Championship], but after yesterday (Saturday) and this morning (Sunday), I was more worried that it might never come.”Also Read: Oliver Rowland reacts to daughter’s sweet radio message after Formula E Championship win: “It’s amazing” Things, however, changed for Wehrlein, who was pushed to third position after Nick Cassidy made a late entry in the Formula E Driver Standings by registering three consecutive wins.

Wehrlein registered one win and five more podiums this season.Meanwhile, Andretti driver Jake Dennis finished in seventh position in the Formula E Driver Standings.

Taylor Barnard on losing top three spot in Formula E World Championship

Fans hail Taylor Barnard for his fantastic rookie season

It was Taylor Barnard’s rookie season this year, and the NEOM McLaren driver put up a fantastic performance by temporarily making it to the top three in the Formula E Driver Standings by ousting the much more experienced Porsche driver Antonio Felix Da Costa.

Finishing P4 in the Drivers’ Championship and coming into the final weekend with a shot at runner-up is something to be proud of.”Also adding a note for teammate Sam Bird, as NEOM McLaren withdrew from Formula E after the end of the season, Barnard wrote, “@sambird_official it wasn’t the weekend you deserved either.You’ve been a huge part of my season both on and off the track, and I’m grateful for everything.

We couldn’t have done it without you all — your trust and support have never been taken for granted,” he added.Praising the two McLaren drivers, he wrote, “Sam clinched McLaren’s first-ever fully electric win at the São Paulo E-Prix in Season 10, pulling off one of Formula E’s all-time great overtakes, before being waved across the line by none other than Emerson Fittipaldi – McLaren's first Formula 1 World Champion. While Taylor has been a rookie sensation in Season 11, securing five Formula E records, including the youngest driver to start a race, the youngest points scorer, the youngest driver to lead a lap, the youngest podium finisher, and the youngest polesitter. ”He ended the letter saying, “Some of us have been together since the day we first launched this team, while others have seamlessly fitted in along the way and flourished within the environment we have cultivated. For many, I am sure that we will cross paths again soon, but whatever the future holds for those here at Bicester, whatever path they choose to follow, I have no doubt that it will be bright.

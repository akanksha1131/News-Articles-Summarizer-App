NEW DELHI: India captain Suryakumar Yadav believes his side has “ticked almost all the boxes” in the group stage, signalling confidence and momentum as they march into the Super 8s of the T20 World Cup after a hard-fought 17-run victory over the Netherlands.Powered by Shivam Dube’s counter-attacking 66 off 31 balls, India recovered from early trouble to post 193 for six after opting to bat first. The Netherlands responded bravely but fell short at 176 for seven, handing India their fourth straight win and confirming their dominance atop Group A.“I think we wanted to bat first. We went on to score 190 and then coming out, there was a little bit of dew, a little bit challenging for the bowlers, but all in all, at the end of the day, very happy,” Suryakumar said at the post-match presentation.The skipper stressed that the bigger satisfaction lay in the team’s overall progress. “You can say that we have ticked almost all the boxes, but even if you win, you learn something out of it. We have learned a few areas, we’ll go back, have a chat, and keep improving,” he added.India’s innings had been wobbling at 69 for three before Dube turned the tide, something Suryakumar said reflected the team’s depth and clarity.“We might be in a similar situation on the next day also. It’s very important for all the batters to understand what the responsibility is and how the wicket is playing. Later on, we have enough firepower… anyone can finish the game nicely.”He reserved special praise for Dube’s composure. “The way he batted in the middle overs, took pressure off everyone, and taking it to 190 on this wicket, I think it was a very good score,” he said.Another major positive, according to the captain, was India’s bowling flexibility. “Sometimes it’s a good headache to have. I have a lot of options in the middle. Whatever the wicket demands, they can chip in with a few overs.”With contributions flowing across departments, Suryakumar made it clear India’s Super 8s entry is not just qualification — it is a warning. “The contribution is almost coming from every single batter. Those small partnerships are what get you to a good score. I’m very happy with the way things are moving.”",India captain Suryakumar Yadav believes his side has ‘ticked almost all the boxes’ in the group stage of the T20 World Cup.

Cricket became full-time over time

'My parents started believing that I am talented'

NEW DELHI: In 2004, T20 cricket was still an idea waiting to happen. The shortest format, which today commands prime-time slots, billions in franchise cricket, biennial World Cup events, and the ICC's most-reliable route to globalise the game, had not yet been played at the international level.That same year, a 17-year-old Saad Bin Zafar moved from Gujranwala in Pakistan to Canada. Cricket was not the reason for the move. Education was.""When we moved to Canada in the beginning, the sole reason was for me to get a good education,"" Saad told TimesofIndia.com during an exclusive interaction. ""My parents, especially my dad, used to tell me to focus on my studies, 'play cricket but don’t let your studies affect you. That’s the sole reason we decided to move you to Canada.' So, there was some pressure from my family.""Two decades later, Saad is Canada’s most experienced campaigner in the ongoing T20 World Cup 2026 and their leading wicket-taker with four wickets.And as his team prepares to play Afghanistan in their final match of the tournament on Thursday at the MA Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai, the 39-year-old has just one ambition: ""To give our best and show our potential.""For the 1986-born, cricket was a pastime in Pakistan, rather than a serious pursuit.“I didn’t play a lot of club cricket in Pakistan. I played school cricket. I didn’t have in mind that I would take up cricket as a career,” he said.After moving to Canada, he joined the University of Toronto and completed a Bachelor’s degree in Business Administration there.Cricket initially fit around his studies. He would play club cricket in Toronto’s Super 9 league before making his debut for Canada in 2008.However, the early years were filled with inconsistency.“From 2008 to 2015, I was on and off in the team. I used to be picked and then dropped,” he added. “I was a youngster. I was new in the team. I was trying to make my place.”That changed in 2015. He gradually made his mark as a regular in the national side and became one of the team's most trusted assets.Saad played an integral part in leading Canada through the qualifiers into the T20 World Cup, later becoming the country’s first captain in the tournament's history. Under his leadership, Canada regained ODI status in 2023.Although he doesn't hold the captain's armband anymore, the responsibilities have only got bigger.“I play my role as a bowling all-rounder, left-arm spinner, left-hand batsman, lower-middle order. I want to win matches for Canada through good performances. And I want to share my experience with the youngsters and groom them,” he said.He has also had experience of playing foreign franchise cricket, including the Caribbean Premier League for St Lucia Zouks.In November 2021, he recorded a rare feat in T20Is: becoming the first man to concede no runs in a four-over spell and finishing with figures of 4-4-0-2 against Panama.For most of his career, cricket was not a full-time profession in Canada. Saad worked as a procurement analyst in an insurance company while playing international cricket.“It was very difficult at the start. After all, cricket was not a full-time profession in Canada,” he revealed. “Even when you play for Canada, you have to work together.”He negotiated leave for tours and sometimes worked remotely while travelling. But employers were not always welcoming.“There was a point when they said that we can’t accommodate you that much. So, you have to either work or play cricket,” he recalled.“When a company would start bothering me, I used to find another job. But I didn’t leave cricket.”In 2018, after becoming Player of the Match in the GT20 final and receiving opportunities in other franchise leagues, he made the decision to quit his job and focus fully on cricket.Saad moved to Canada with his family as the eldest son. The move was primarily for his university education. After three years, his family returned to Pakistan while he stayed back to complete his studies. However, eventually, his other four siblings also moved to Canada. Also, his father’s stance changed.“Eventually, when I got a call-up in the national team and started playing for Canada, my parents started believing that I am talented enough to represent Canada. After that, my dad started supporting me,” he added with a smile.""He then stopped telling me to give up cricket and focus on my studies. They now feel proud.""",Saad Bin Zafar is Canada's leading wicket-taker at the T20 World Cup 2026. The 39-year-old made his debut for Canada in 2008.

Hardik Pandya's post for Mahieka Sharma

NEW DELHI: Indian cricketer Hardik Pandya shared a sweet birthday post for his girlfriend Mahieka Sharma on Instagram. He posted a warm photo with her and wrote, “Happy birthday my princess.”Hardik confirmed his relationship with Mahieka in late 2025. This came more than a year after his divorce from Natasa Stankovic in July 2024.Since then, Hardik and Mahieka have been seen together many times. She has also been seen spending time with Hardik’s son, Agastya, which showed the growing closeness between them.In an interview with JioStar amid this ongoing T20 World Cup, Hardik spoke about how Mahieka helped him in his cricket journey.He admitted that he had not used his full potential as a batter.He said, “After the last IPL, I realised that I really wanted to play to my full potential. I think until now, I haven't utilised more than 40 per cent of my batting potential.” He explained that he needed time to understand how to bring out his best form.Hardik said Mahieka played a key role in motivating him.He added, “That's when Mahieka came into my life. We started talking about the sport and how to bring that child back.”He also said, “Mahieka helped me rediscover that excitement for the game that I always had.”He shared that he trained for long hours and spent six to seven hours on the ground on some days.On Valentine’s Day 2026, Hardik got a tattoo on the back of his neck to show his feelings for Mahieka. The tattoo includes the letter ‘M’ and two leopards. The leopards symbolise their strong bond and how they push each other to be better.Tattoo artist Sunny Bhanushali explained the meaning and said, “Hardik came with the idea of an initial, but conversations revealed something much deeper. They described themselves as partners who amplify each other's strengths. The leopard became the perfect metaphor — powerful alone, unstoppable together.”","Indian cricketer Hardik Pandya shared a sweet birthday post for his girlfriend Mahieka Sharma.

MEN BEHIND THE MILESTONE: THE TEAM’S KEY PERFORMERS

Auqib Nabi:

Sunil Kumar:

Abdul Samad:

Paras Dogra:

KALYANI: One clean swing, one red ball sailing into the stands, and a 67-year wait came to an end. The moment Vanshaj Sharma launched Bengal pacer Mukesh Kumar for six, J&K players, support staff and officials poured onto the field at the Bengal Cricket Academy ground here on Wednesday. Their celebratory roar could probably be heard all the way to the Himalayan state.With that hit, J&K sealed its first-ever spot in the final of the Ranji Trophy , India’s premier domestic red-ball cricket event. Once famous for the Kashmir willow, J&K is etching a chapter of its own in the annals of Indian cricket.The result, a 6-wicket win, was emphatic, even though there were moments when the match appeared to be slipping away. Set 126 for victory, the team completed the chase in 34.4 overs, getting it done before lunch on Day 4.“I have played the Ranji final a number of times. But this time, it’s different. I had not slept for the last three nights. Today I will sleep well,” an elated coach Ajay Sharma, once a stalwart of the domestic scene for Delhi, said.As history beckoned, J&K began Day 4 within touching distance, only 83 runs away, yet Bengal came hard at them.Akash Deep, already among the wickets, struck twice to remove Shubham Khajuria and Yawer Hassan, then returned to send back skipper Paras Dogra. Mohammed Shami , relentless as ever, bowled Shubham Pundir to briefly widen the doorway for a comeback. But Abdul Samad and Sharma shut it with authority with an unbeaten 55-run fifth-wicket partnership that carried J&K to the line without another stumble. Samad’s unbeaten 30 off 27 balls, studded with three sixes, provided the finishing fire. Sharma’s 43 not out off 83 balls supplied the composure.The semifinal had turned on J&K’s refusal to panic after conceding a first-innings lead. Bengal piled up 328, powered by Sudip Kumar Gharami’s superb 146, and then had J&K out for 302 in reply, with Shami ripping through the innings with 8/90. Yet J&K stayed within reach through Samad’s counter-attacking 82, Dogra’s 58 and valuable lower-order runs that kept the deficit to 26.Few might have expected J&K to flip that deficit into a ticket to the final. But Sharma insisted the belief never wavered. “I told the boys that the match is not over. We have two more days. Cricket always gives you a second chance. Red-ball cricket is a dangerous game,” the 61-year-old Sharma said.Day 3 delivered the match’s decisive lurch. Bengal, under pressure, collapsed for 99 in just 25.1 overs. Sunil Kumar grabbed 4/27 and Auqib Nabi — the breakout fast bowler this season — took 4/36 to complete a match haul of 9/123, also chipping in with 42 with the bat earlier. Dogra underlined how quickly the equation changed.“That was not a significant lead (26 runs) and we still had seven sessions of play. But of course we never expected them (Bengal) to fold so cheaply,” he said. The final will carry personal meaning for Dogra, a veteran who crossed 10,000 Ranji runs during this match and now finds himself within a game of the trophy that has eluded him.“It will be big for me. My first Ranji final too. I never thought that I would get such a good group of players,” Dogra said, adding: “There was belief in everyone from the beginning of the season that we can win the Ranji Trophy.”Both Dogra and Sharma could not stop talking about pacer Nabi. “He is a match-winner for us,” Dogra said. “He has good work ethics and has been disciplined.” Coach Sharma believes bigger things are not far away for the 29-year-old from Baramulla. “Age is on his side and he has developed the skill set. He will play the IPL (for Delhi Capitals) and if he performs there, the sky’s the limit for him,” Sharma said.The final is next, and J&K have earned the right to dream all the way.J&K 302 (Samad 82, Shami 8-90) & 126/4 (Vanshaj 43, Samad 30*, Akash Deep 3-46) beat Bengal 328 (Gharami 146, Nabi 5-87) & 99 (Shahbaz 24, Sunil 4-27, Nabi 4-36) by 6 wicketsThe medium-pacer took 12 wickets (7/40 & 5/70) against MP in the quarterfinal, and 9 (5/87 & 4/36) in the semifinal. Nabi has a 8.4cr IPL deal with Delhi Capitals. Will an India Test call-up follow? Matches This Season: 9, Wkts: 55, Avg: 12.7, Economy Rate: 2.7, Strike Rate: 28.5The left-arm medium-pacer has been the perfect foil to Nabi. His 3/41 & 4/27 in the semis proved crucial. Matches: 8, Wkts: 29, Avg: 15.1, ER: 2.6, SR: 34.9The middle-order batter’s composure under pressure has seen him pull off several rescue acts. In the semis, he first slammed 82, then scored an unbeaten 30 off 27 balls to finish a tricky chase. Matches: 9, Runs: 655, Avg: 59.5The skipper has led with both bat and tactical acumen. Fittingly, the 41-yr-old has become only the 2nd batter to cross 10,000 runs in the Ranji Trophy. Matches: 9, Runs: 551, Avg: 42.4",Jammu and Kashmir beat Bengal by six wickets in Ranji Trophy semifinal. It is J&K's first-ever win in India's premier domestic red-ball cricket event.

Why Pakistan don't trust Babar Azam any more | T20 World Cup 2026

Sahibzada Farhan etched his name into the record books with a maiden T20I century during Pakistan ’s T20 World Cup 2026 Group A clash against Namibia on Wednesday. However, while the milestone was significant, former India all-rounder Irfan Pathan was not entirely impressed with how the opener approached the closing moments of the innings.Farhan reached his hundred in the penultimate over but did so in a manner that raised eyebrows. On the second ball of the 20th over, he calmly pushed the delivery towards long-on for a single to bring up the landmark. In doing so, he became only the second Pakistan batter after Ahmed Shehzad to score a century in the T20 World Cup.Pathan, though, questioned the timing and intent behind the approach, suggesting that the team’s total should have been the sole focus in the final over.“He definitely has scored a century, but taking a single? Unbelievable. Unbelievable. You would be happy that you have scored a century and that Pakistan have reached 199,” Irfan said on air.“But in the last over, you play a defensive shot, then you leave the last ball. Kamaal hai,” he added.Farhan also failed to capitalise on the final delivery of the innings, unable to reach a wide ball bowled by Namibia captain Gerhard Erasmus . The last over wasn’t fully maximised, and had Shadab Khan not struck two crucial sixes, Pakistan may not have pushed their total to 199.The 29-year-old eventually finished unbeaten on 100 from 58 balls, an innings decorated with 11 fours and four sixes at a strike rate of 172.41.In the broader context of the match, Farhan’s century laid the foundation for Pakistan’s imposing 199/3 in Colombo. Captain Salman Ali Agha contributed 38, while Shadab remained unbeaten on 36 to provide a late flourish. In reply, Namibia were outclassed as Usman Tariq’s mystery spin (4/16) dismantled the middle order and Shadab claimed 3/19. Namibia were bowled out for 97 in 17.3 overs, handing Pakistan a commanding 102-run victory and confirming their place in the Super 8 stage.",Sahibzada Farhan scores maiden T20I century in Pakistan's win over Namibia.

According to him, the players had to wait 13 to 14 hours at Sydney Airport before flying to Canberra.When the team arrived at their hotel, they were told that no advance payment had been made, so there were no confirmed bookings. The players had to wait for hours and even walk around the streets before a place to stay was arranged. Pakistan lost 2-3 to Australia in their first FIH Pro League match and went on to lose all their matches during the Australia leg, including games against Australia and Germany.Butt said the situation was embarrassing and affected the team’s performance.""What was pathetic was that even the Airbnb accommodation was arranged for 10 days when we had to stay for 13 days. We had to move into a cheaper residence after 10-days,"" Butt said.The Pakistan Sports Board said it had given more than 10 million rupees to the federation for hotel arrangements.

Joji Varghese with Canada cricket team captain Dilpreet Bajwa

JOJI'S JOURNEY: KERALA TO CANADA

NEW DELHI: In 2017, Joji Varghese packed his luggage, left Thiruvananthapuram forever, and flew to Canada. He had obtained a Canadian PR — a challenging but necessary step to secure a bright future for his children. His wife had been working as a nurse in Italy, but language barriers made settling there difficult. A long-term vision, his children’s future, and a decent life — these were all in Joji's mind, and hence he chose Canada. While applying for PR, he needed a profession to qualify and chose a six-month massage therapy course. The course eventually helped him secure permanent residency in Canada.He moved to Canada and started living in Brampton, near Toronto.He had achieved all his dreams by then except one — meeting his favourite cricketer, Sanju Samson , whom he had watched play from afar at the same college where he worked as a physical education teacher.Fate, it seems, had its own plans. Destiny served that dream on a platter to Joji, and he became emotional.Over time, Joji made a name for himself as a skilled massage therapist in Canada and later got an opportunity to work with Cricket Canada.Now, he is travelling with the Canadian team for the T20 World Cup 2026 in India. Wearing the Canada jersey, he moves from one corner of a cricket ground to another, meeting cricketers from all over the world and cherishing every moment of his homecoming.Interestingly, his long-cherished dream was fulfilled when India and Canada were scheduled to practice at the Arun Jaitley Stadium recently in different time slots, and Joji got to meet his hero — Sanju Samson.""I was destined to meet him. It’s nothing short of a dream story for me. Finally meeting Sanju was truly a dream come true,"" Joji told TimesofIndia.com in an exclusive interview. ""Back when he was a college student, I would often see him on campus because we were in the same college. He was at Mar Baselios Engineering College in Thiruvananthapuram for his bachelor’s degree, and I was in the Sports Department in the same campus. """"When I learned that Canada and India were sharing the same practice session, I was really excited. And when I finally saw him on the ground, it became one of the most memorable moments of my life that I will cherish forever. Our conversation took place after his warm-up session when he came to the dressing room. Sanju was extremely humble, approachable, and down-to-earth. When I told him I was from Kerala, he immediately smiled, addressed me as ‘Chetta,’ and asked, ‘Sugamano?’—instantly creating a personal and emotional connection. Despite being such a big international star, he interacted with great simplicity and respect,"" he said.""We spoke about Canadian cricket and our journeys. Sanju also has a massive fan following in Canada. The Indian community there, as well as many members of the Canadian team, admire him deeply for his batting consistency and calm leadership. Among young cricketers and fans of Kerala origin, his popularity continues to grow. Every weekend, people form teams and play cricket, and Sanju is a big inspiration for them,"" Joji added.Joji has also worked with several international cricketers including Rassie van der Dussen, Dwaine Pretorius, Moeen Ali, Shane Bond, Tim Southee, Yuvraj Singh and Mark Chapman.With his wife working in Italy, Joji managed both children while continuing his job in Thiruvananthapuram.Both Joji and his wife applied for Canadian PR, and once they received it, they didn’t look back. The decision was emotional, but considering the future of their children, they took this bold step.""My daughter missed her mother a lot. We needed money at that time, so my wife had to leave. In Italy, you need to know Italian if you apply for PR. That’s why we chose an English-speaking country, and we chose Canada. My wife is in the medical field, so she easily got PR, and I did a sports massage therapist course. Because of the demand, I got an opportunity too,"" he said.""Now, I have four kids. My daughter is 16, my second child, a son, is 13, and I have twin boys who are six years old,"" he added.""I worked in a private company and then got the opportunity with the Global T20 Canada tournament. That was a big opportunity for me. Later, I got an offer with Cricket Canada, and with the help of the cricket board, I am now travelling to India,"" he said.""Currently, it’s minus 30 degrees in Canada. Cricketers need extra attention in such conditions. We came in the first week of January to Sri Lanka for a practice session to adapt to the climate. We trained there for a whole month,"" he added.",Joji Varghese is travelling with the Canadian team for the T20 World Cup 2026 in India.

A dominant India will be hoping that Abhishek Sharma rediscovers his destructive form and that the rest of the batting lineup steps up against spin when they take on the Netherlands in their final T20 World Cup league match on Wednesday. Despite being one of the most dangerous batters over the past 18 months, Abhishek has yet to make a big impact in the ICC event at home.After a duck in the opener, a stomach infection kept him out against Namibia. He returned for the high-stakes clash with Pakistan but again failed to score.Thankfully, Ishan Kishan’s imperious form at the other end has kept India’s campaign on track. To his credit, Abhishek’s high-risk approach has delivered multiple wins for India, and it may only be a matter of time before he dismantles top bowlers again. Yet, four ducks in his last six innings indicate he might need to rethink his powerplay strategy.With India already through to the Super 8s, the Netherlands game offers the perfect chance to get back among the runs. On the bowling front, India could rest a few players ahead of the next stage, including pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah.

How Suryakumar Yadav and Tilak Varma are hurting India | T20 World Cup

12 - India have extended their record in T20 World Cup with their twelfth triumph in succession between June 5, 2024 and Feb 18, 2026.



66 - Shivam Dube has recorded his maiden fifty in the T20 World Cup, bettering the 34 vs Bangladesh in North Sound on June 22, 2024. His knock is his career-best in T20Is. His previous best was 65 vs New Zealand in Vizag on Jan 28, 2026.



1 - Dube’s knock is an Indian record for the highest individual innings by a No. 5 batter or below in the T20 World Cup, bettering Hardik Pandya’s 63 vs England in Adelaide on Nov 10, 2022.



13 - Hardik Pandya has become the 13th all-rounder and the first Indian to complete the double of 6000+ runs and 200+ wickets in Twenty20.



3 - Abhishek Sharma is the third opening batter to get three ducks in a T20 WC tournament. The first two are West Indies’ Andrew Fletcher in 2009 and Bangladesh’s Tanzid Hasan in 2024. Three other batters have recorded three ducks in a T20 WC competition — Scotland’s Richie Berrington in 2021-22, Zimbabwe’s Regis Chakabva in 2022-23 and Uganda’s Roger Mukasa in 2024.



4 - Abhishek is the fourth batter to register three successive ducks in the T20 World Cup, the first three being India’s Ashish Nehra between 2010 and 2016, Fletcher in 2009 and Mukasa in 2024.



55 - Abhishek is the second Indian batter to get 5 ducks in 8 innings in a calendar year. Sanju Samson had registered five ducks in 12 innings in 2024.

AHMEDABAD: Abhishek Sharma was out for his third consecutive duck but showing yet again how dangerous and impactful he can be, Shivam Dube struck a career-best 66 off just 31 balls to star in India’s 17-run win over the Netherlands here on Wednesday.The defending champions and co-hosts rounded off the league stage by winning all their four matches and topping Group A. They now take a well-earned breather for the next three days before they take on South Africa at the same venue in their first Super 8s match.With an aim to help the bowlers get used to defending a total in dewy conditions in the Super 8s, India decided to bat first in the inconsequential tie. Dube’s power-packed half-century — his first in T20 World Cups — lifted India to a daunting 193-6 after they struggled initially against Dutch spinner Aryan Dutt, who bowled brilliantly to finish with 2-19 in four overs.Varun Chakravarthy then spun some of his own magic, taking 3-14 in three overs, but a spirited Dutch team did well to respond with 176-7.India dropped a few catches on the night but the biggest worry would be the terrible run of Abhishek, who fell for his fifth duck of the year. Ishan Kishan (18; 7b, 22x4, 1x6), Tilak Varma (31; 27b, 3x4, 1x6) and skipper Suryakumar Yadav (34; 28b, 2x4, 1x6) were all dismissed when well set.When ‘SKY’ was caught at fine leg off Logan van Beek (3-56 in four overs), India were literally crawling at 110/4 in the 14th over. However, all-rounders Hardik Pandya (30; 21b, 3x6) and Dube then put on 76 in just 35 balls for the fifth wicket to give the tournament co-hosts some much needed momentum in the second half of the innings.With Dube, who reached his fifty off 25 balls, and Pandya tonking nine sixes between them, India plundered 75 in the last five overs, giving plenty of entertainment to the 68,000-strong crowd.In the penultimate over, the Dube-Pandya pair took 21 off Kyle Klein as Pandya smoked the medium-pacer for two sixes and Dube took a four off him.Overall, India’s batters struck 13 sixes on the night. Dube, who employs his long levers, timing and raw power to send the ball into orbit if pitched in his arc, had also produced cameos of 23 (16b) and 27 (17 balls) against Namibia and Pakistan in his previous two outings.Abhishek, meanwhile, lost his leg stump off the third delivery that he faced as Aryan Dutt, bowling brilliantly, had one skidding off the surface. Short of confidence, Abhishek missed the line of the ball completely as tried to heave it on the on side. Delivering a fabulous spell in the Powerplay, Dutt also had Ishan Kishan bowled in a freakish way: the ball brushed off the in-form left-hander’s pads and elbow before trickling on to the stumps even as he tried to stop it.The Netherlands deserve to be complimented for the way they kept India, who were 51/2 after the Powerplay, in check in the first 15 overs before the Dube-Pandya onslaught.",Shivam Dube hits career-best 66 as India beat Netherlands by 17 runs. Abhishek Sharma is third opening batter to get three ducks in a T20 WC tournament. Hardik Pandya becomes first Indian to complete double of 6000+ runs and 200+ wickets in Twenty20.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128538700,imgsize-151054,width-400,resizemode-4/shivam-dube.jpg"

Although qualification permutations are no longer in play with the Super Eights line-up already confirmed, there is still plenty at stake when Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe face off in Colombo. Both sides remain unbeaten in the group stage, and this fixture offers a timely dress rehearsal before the next phase of the tournament.For context, one of these teams failed to progress to the Super Eights in the 2024 edition, while the other did not even make it to that tournament. By that measure alone, this campaign marks clear progress for both outfits. However, Zimbabwe captain Sikandar Raza made it clear after the washed-out clash against Ireland that merely reaching the Super Eights will not satisfy his team.Zimbabwe have already made headlines by knocking Australia out early and will aim to carry that momentum forward when they travel to India for the next round. With two strong victories built on collective performances across batting, bowling and fielding, another win — especially against the co-hosts — would significantly boost their confidence and potentially secure a top finish in Group B.Standing in their way is a Sri Lankan side brimming with form. They are coming off one of their most dominant T20 World Cup victories in recent memory. Pathum Nissanka delivered what many consider the innings of the tournament so far, Kusal Mendis has been in outstanding touch, and Pavan Rathnayake has emerged as an unexpected but effective presence at No.4.Injuries, however, have tested Sri Lanka’s depth. Matheesha Pathirana has been ruled out of the competition, adding to the earlier loss of Wanindu Hasaranga. As co-hosts, they will be eager to avoid further setbacks while maintaining their rhythm heading into the Super Eights.",Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe face off in Colombo on Thursday.

All about Abhishek Sharma’s lonely net session in Ahmedabad

Having served as the head of the ad-hoc committee to run the Jammu and Kashmir Cricket Association (JKCA) till last September, BCCI president Mithun Manhas said that the cricket infrastructure in the state will grow faster once the state association is approved by the government.“Everything is ready with forming the state association. They have gone to the government for approval. Once they get it done, BCCI funds will be unlocked to improve the infrastructure in the state. Right now, they play at the Harbux Stadium in Srinagar and the College Ground in Jammu. Work towards building a proper cricket stadium with proper facilities can start immediately,” Manhas told TOI on Wednesday.Manhas recalled the process of setting up facilities to help J&K cricket rise since he took charge in 2021. “I must thank Jay Shah , who was the BCCI secretary then, for giving us a free hand and funds to organise the facilities even though we were an ad-hoc committee. We made red-soil pitches in two stadiums so that the team was ready to play on all kinds of pitches across India. We used to start our talent hunt programme from April every year and went to every district. The teams were sent to play off-season tournaments in different parts of the country. Now, the plan is to invite other state teams to play invitational tournaments in J&K,” Manhas said.While 41-year-old Paras Dogra , coming in as a guest player, led from the front as captain in the last two seasons, Manhas said that the endeavour was never to rely heavily on outstation professional players.“Dogra’s experience helped these young batters learn to bat for longer periods. But he is the only guest player in the team. We need to give time to the young players to groom into leadership roles,” the former Delhi captain claimed.Manhas also highlighted that there was a conscious effort to develop more qualified coaches in the region. “When I took charge, there was only one NCA Level 1 coach in the state. Now we have close to 40 Level 2 coaches. That has helped in grooming talent in pockets of the state,” he mentioned.","Mithun Manhas says cricket infrastructure in the state will grow faster once the state association is approved by the government.

TimesofIndia.com in Colombo:

Inside Pakistan’s camp What is the Naqvi problem

Pakistan all-rounder Shadab Khan has hit back at former Pakistan captain and batting legend Mohammad Yousuf and Shahid Afridi , who have claimed that the country’s cricket is currently in its “darkest period” and said players like Babar Azam and Shaheen Shah Afridi should no longer be considered for the shortest format.“Criticism is something we can’t control. Every individual has his own opinion; they are free to have it,” Shadab told reporters after Pakistan’s thumping 102-run win over Namibia at the Sinhalese Sports Club Ground in Colombo.Shadab had a poor outing against India, where he managed only 14 runs and gave away 17 runs in the only over he bowled.“Time’s up for Shaheen, Babar, and Shadab. Pakistan’s T20 squad needs new performers, not empty wins against weaker sides,” Mohammad Yousuf wrote on X on Sunday.However, against Namibia in a must-win game for Pakistan, Shadab redeemed himself. The all-rounder scored an unbeaten 36 off 22 balls and picked up three crucial wickets.“I feel that since I have made a comeback, I bowled one bad over, and because of that there is so much criticism. I don’t try to justify it. I can’t control these things. It was a bad day and a bad over. It’s T20 cricket; you can go for runs and take wickets as well.I don’t ponder too much about the criticism,” he said.Yousuf, who served as the men’s team batting coach for a period of three months between March and June 2025 before resigning from the role, was scathing in his remarks.“Unless we remove political influence and personal agendas from Pakistan cricket, we cannot return to the team we once were. This is the darkest period in our cricketing history, and my heart bleeds for it. Incompetent individuals must be removed from office and from the team,” Yousuf wrote on social media platform X on Monday.Yousuf was not alone. Pakistan cricket legend Shahid Afridi has called for senior players like Shaheen Shah Afridi, Babar Azam, and Shadab Khan to be dropped from Pakistan’s final group-stage game against Namibia.“If it were up to me to make a decision, I would drop Shaheen, Babar, and Shadab. I would bench them all,” Shahid Afridi said on a panel show for Samaa TV.“They are all senior players who, in my opinion, have a responsibility to perform. You lose matches. But nobody loses like this. Nobody loses in such a one-sided manner. My point is, this is the Pakistan team; you have to fight. We have also played cricket; we have lost many times, but I don’t recall us ever playing or losing in this specific way. We have lost, but we fought,” Afridi added.Shadab took a swipe at the legends without taking any names and cited the 2021 T20 World Cup example, when Babar Azam-led Pakistan thrashed India by ten wickets in Dubai. It remains the only time Pakistan have defeated India in World Cups.“Our ex-cricketers have their own opinions. They have done well for Pakistan, and at the end of the day, they have also never defeated India in the World Cup. We were the ones who defeated India in the 2021 World Cup. In World Cups, we have beaten India only once. Yes, they are legends, but they have never done anything remarkable against India in the World Cup,” he said.Shadab also credited India batter Ishan Kishan, who scored a breathtaking 77 off 40 balls on Sunday in Colombo.“In a high-pressure match, it is all about how you get the start. India started well. They have a player, Ishan Kishan, who was in good form, and he played an excellent innings,” he said.“We are talking too much about one match. Yes, the obvious goal was to win that match against India as well. At the end of the day, our main aim is to win the World Cup. We are trusting our process, and we will get the results,” he added.Pakistan will start their Super Eight campaign against New Zealand at the R Premadasa Stadium in Colombo on February 21.

Why is Ahmedabad likely to be the sporting capital of India? | Bombay Sport Exchange

On the eve of NorthEast United FC ’s Indian Super League (ISL) opener against East Bengal FC, head coach Juan Pedro Benali struck a deeply emotional yet clear-headed note, calling on fans to rally behind their teams while keeping the bigger picture of Indian football in mind.“It’s easy to criticise on social media. Buy the tickets to watch your team, be it NorthEast United FC, East Bengal FC or Kerala Blasters FC, make people feel that football is important,” he said, before adding, “Rather than sitting at home and criticising, not watching the games, come to the stadiums.”The 56-year-old Spaniard emphasised that even small acts of support can make a meaningful difference, urging fans to go the extra mile for their clubs and the sport.“We know it is a difficult moment, but support your team. Just for that Rs 100, Rs 200 or Rs 50 (match ticket price), it’s money. The sacrifice that you make by travelling to watch the game, be it 10, 20, 50, or 80 km, is a sacrifice. But when you make that sacrifice, you earn the right to criticise, and you can say, I helped my club,” Benali added.While acknowledging the frustrations surrounding Indian football, Benali made it clear that fans are fully entitled to express their views — but insisted that criticism should be matched with action.“The national team is not doing well, because of this, that… I understand. It’s your right (to voice your opinion). Do it, but also help. Rs 200 for each game. Go to the FanCode, pay Rs 299 for the season pass. Buy the subscription to watch NorthEast United FC (Team Pass). That’s what we’re asking from the fans. That’s the support. That’s the help. This is where the clubs can feel that they have (supporting) hands, and not the fans who only talk,” he said.In a call for unity during what he described as a challenging phase, Benali urged supporters to stand by their teams regardless of results or circumstances.“It is not a moment to say NorthEast will not do well or go to the second division. No, it is a moment to be with everyone, regardless of the results. Be with your team, your players,” he added.He signed off with a broader appeal, urging the entire Indian football ecosystem to come together as one.“This is the real moment to be a family. This is the real moment to be an Indian football family, all together. The clubs, the players, the fans. This is the moment to show the world that even if 10 per cent of the Indian population loves football, that’s 150 million people.

Jay Shah’s 2036 Olympic blueprint for India: '8 Medals won’t cut it'

The military will use two types of equipment:

A semi-mobile system that creates a protected zone where no unauthorized drone can fly.

A portable system that a soldier can carry and point at a suspicious drone.

The Mexican military is getting ready to deal with unauthorized drones during this summer’s football World Cup.Mexico is hosting the tournament together with the United States and Canada from June 11 to July 19. On Tuesday, soldiers at a military base in Mexico City showed the anti-drone equipment they plan to use to protect stadiums.The move comes because drug cartels in Mexico have increasingly used drones bought online to attack rivals and sometimes civilians. This has become more common over the past five years.However, most of the cartel violence happens far from the three World Cup host cities: Mexico City, Guadalajara, and Monterrey. These cities will host 13 matches during the tournament.""(Drone prevention) is going to be focused in the stadiums and where there are crowds, which could be the 'Fan Fest' events, or any point where there are meetings of people,"" army Captain Jose Alfredo Lara, a communications and electronics engineer, told AFP.Once the military team locates a drone, it cuts off the pilot's communication with the apparatus. ""The device loses control and won't be able to come close,"" Lara explained.This causes the drone to lose control and prevents it from getting close. Depending on how it is set up, the drone may return to its operator, try to leave the blocked area, or crash.Several major criminal groups in Mexico, including the Sinaloa Cartel, Cartel Jalisco Nueva Generacion, and La Familia Michoacana, are known to use drones. Their activity is mostly reported in states like Michoacan, Chihuahua, and Guanajuato.Last October, drones carrying homemade explosives attacked state prosecutor offices in Tijuana, a city near the US border.The Mexican military says these new security measures are meant to reduce the risk of drone attacks during the World Cup and keep fans safe.",Mexico is hosting the tournament together with the United States and Canada from June 11 to July 19.

Dance, drums and fun! Team India land in Colombo | Hardik Pandya with Mahieka Sharmaindia arrival-

Kolkata: Some wobbles, some worries and in the end Mohun Bagan Super Giant got just what the doctor ordered — a 2-0 win over Kerala Blasters to start their defence of the ISL title here on Saturday.Jamie Maclaren put Sergio Lobera’s side in front in the 36th minute and Tom Aldred came off the bench to head home the second goal to polish the victory up deep into injury time.However, it was not the kind of rise-and-shine moment the 30,000-odd fans present at the stands would love to be thrilled with.The defending champions’ path to victory was strewn with some avoidable potholes here and there, something which one might be tempted to attribute to their opening match rustiness and ineptitude.It was Petratos who had a direct role in breaking the deadlock. The Bagan No. 9, receiving the ball inside the box from Apuia, laid it off quickly for fellow Australian Maclaren, who steered clear of Aiban Dohling’s challenge with a sharp turn to beat the goalkeeper Sachin Suresh with a left-footed low volley. Bagan thereafter had more possession and more territory, but they couldn’t control the opponents, who looked more ambitious in the second half, especially with the arrival of Kevin Yoke.Sensing the problem, Lobera introduced Aldred in the 81st minute, taking off Petratos. Defender Aldred calmed the nerves for his team, rising to the occasion to meet Anirush Thapa’s free-kick and beating the Blasters goalkeeper for the second time. It also ensured a perfect start to the Lobera reign at the club as the Spaniard has now kept the record of a winning debut in the ISL for all four clubs he has managed so far.",Mohun Bagan Super Giant beat Kerala Blasters 2-0 in ISL opener.

KOLKATA: Defending champions Mohun Bagan Super Giant started Indian Super League 2025-26 with a comfortable 2-0 victory over Kerala Blasters FC in the season opener here at the Vivekananda Yuba Bharathi Krirangan (VYBK).A first-half strike from Jamie Maclaren (36') and a second-half injury-time goal from Tom Aldred (90+6') secured three points for the Mariners.Mohun Bagan SG head coach Sergio Lobera named a very strong lineup with all the familiar faces including Dimi Petratos, Jamie Maclaren and Alberto Rodriguez, taking the field for the Spaniard's first match in charge of the Mariners. New signings Mehtab Singh, Robson Da Silva, and Amey Ranawade were the fresh faces in the whole match day squad. On the other hand, David Catala named a young lineup in his first ISL match, with foreign signings Oumar Ba and Victor Bertomeu making their debuts alongside midfielders Y Ebindas and Rowllin Borges, as per an ISL press release.The defending champions had the better possession in the first half, with Anirudh Thapa and Lalengmawia Ralte (Apuia) controlling the midfield, allowing Robson and Liston Colaco to find space to attack through the wings.Dimi Petratos returned to his preferred No. 10 role behind Jamie Maclaren, and the Australian almost gave his side an early lead. Liston Colaco found Petratos inside the box, but the forward snatched his shot, which went wide of the goal.The Mariners were dominating possession, but were finding it difficult to break down the stubborn defence of Kerala Blasters. They did manage to take the lead after the water break through Jamie Maclaren. He was found inside the box by Petratos, and the Aussie striker turned Aiban Dohling and found the net through a composed left-footed finish for the first goal of the ISL season. Mohun Bagan ended the first half with the one goal lead registering ten shots on goal with six on target at the end of the half.Catala made two changes in the start of the second half, bringing in Naocha Singh and Marlon Trujillo while Subhasish Bose was replaced by Amey Ranawade for Mohun Bagan. The second half also saw the Mariners being comfortable with the ball, maintaining possession for long periods to force the Blasters to defend deep in their own half.Kerala Blasters became stronger in the final quarter of the game, especially with the introduction of Kevin Yoke, who showed his pace and dribbling abilities down the wings, but could not muster any clear-cut chances to trouble Vishal Kaith in goal. Mohun Bagan put the game beyond the reach of the opposition in injury-time of the second half with substitute Tom Aldred finding the goal with a powerful header past Sachin Suresh from the free-kick of Anirudh Thapa.Jamie Maclaren was named Player of the Match.",Defending champions Mohun Bagan Super Giant started Indian Super League 2025-26 with a comfortable 2-0 victory over Kerala Blasters FC.

Hours before the truncated Indian Super League (ISL) season gets underway on Saturday, it became official that FanCode had sub-licensed the linear TV rights to Sony Pictures Network India (SPNI). Under the agreement, as reported by TimesofIndia.com , Sony Sports Network will hold exclusive TV broadcast rights for India and non-exclusive rights for Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Maldives, Nepal, and Sri Lanka. The position on international broadcast, however, is still in the works.All 91-matches will be telecast on Sony Ten 2 and pushed to other channels too if there is a double header at the same time.This is not the first time Sony Sports Network and FanCode will work together. Both platforms carried tennis' French Open in 2025 with Sony retaining the primary broadcast and sub-licensing the streaming aspect of all courts to Dream Sports-owned FanCode.Last year, a similar ploy was employed between Sony Sports and JioHotstar for cricket's India tour of England. Under those terms, Sony kept the television broadcast rights while JioHotstar was responsible for the digital streaming.""The macro observation on this is (that) there's so much opportunity (in the sports industry). (It) is so large that honestly there's just so much to be done in the industry that collaboration is probably more apt at this moment than competition because there's so much opportunity,"" explained FanCode co-founder Yannick Colaco of the sub-licensing strategy""And the way we look at it is very clear. We are a digital-first platform. So the two things that are unique about Fancode is (that) we are digital first and we are sports only.""Our product, our approach has always been focused on technology, focused on experience, focused on how we are available across 11 operating systems, focused on innovation on the digital side. And we neither have, nor (a) desire, to have any focus on building a linear TV business.""So when you look at those two unique pieces, there is tremendous opportunity to collaborate with other large media companies, which have a much bigger mandate and ambit. Very politely, we are a much smaller player in this overall media landscape.""And I think that's the way we look at it in the sense that while younger audiences are all digital first, and even some of the older audiences are migrating to digital, there is still a large audience which consumes sports content on linear television.""So when we're working with partners like the AIFF (All India Football Federation) and the ISL, we're very conscious of the fact that to help the sport grow, help the event be successful, give it maximum amount of distribution, we need to be collaborating with partners who have the linear TV presence so that we are able to reach out and basically able to reach out to all sports fans and all ISL fans across the country,"" he continued.Less than two weeks ago, FanCode acquired the broadcast rights -- linear TV and digital -- for the ISL at Rs 8.62 crore. Even though the company has presence only in digital streaming space, it consciously bid for both aspects knowing there were few, if any, players interested in just the linear TV rights.During conversations between FanCode, AIFF and the ISL interim committee, the provider made it clear they wanted to help ensure the top-division football was showcased to as many viewers as possible.After officially bagging the rights, the company entered into conversations with multiple national providers and even some regional ones.""We immediately started speaking to a bunch of people about this, including regional broadcasters, and we took a bunch of proposals that we got, we put them all together. We shared them with the AIFF and the interim committee. We got on a call with them. I shared the pros and cons of each one with them. And on that basis, a decision was made to accept Sony's proposal,"" said Colaco.While that was happening, FanCode also spoke to ISL club representatives to understand their expectations on how to improve the product. It was at this stage that the concept of each club's 'superfan' recording visuals behind the scenes came into being.ISL will have commentary in English, Hindi, Malayalam, Bengali and Tamil (only for Chennaiyin matches).Doing all this, why give away market share to a competitor like Sony Sports?""I'm making it easier for people who prefer to watch the game on linear television to watch it. And yes, (if it comes) at the cost of us also, that's okay. I think it's important to think consumer first. So I believe that eventually our product is what will give users the choice and deliver a great experience. And if it's good enough, which I hope it is, and I believe it is, consumers will come,"" reasoned Colaco.""I don't think it should be forced and that's always what we (have) believed. And I also think that you know a partner like Sony will help in raising the promotion levels and contribute (to the) marketing. (As the saying goes) A rising tide lifts all boats,"" he added.On their part, Sony Sports Network, who had attended the pre-bid conference for the broadcast rights but chose not to make a final bid, sees this as an opportunity to add to their football portfolio which is largely led by European competitions.""While we were keen to add ISL to our sports portfolio, back then, we needed more time to evaluate the property before putting in our financial offer,"" said Rajesh Kaul, Chief Revenue Officer and Business Head - Sports and International, SPNI,Yet this won't be their first foray into Indian football having previously showcased the I-League and Durand Cup.""Our aim is to cater to football fans and expand the football ecosystem in India. Sony Pictures Networks India is the Home of Football in India and we have a diverse and expansive portfolio of both International and Indian football properties that includes UEFA EURO 2028, the UEFA Champions League, UEFA Europa League, UEFA Nations League, Bundesliga, FA Cup along with India’s very own legacy tournament Durand Cup. Last year, we were also the official broadcasters of I-League which is also homegrown football league,"" he stated.","FanCode sub-licensed the linear TV rights to Sony Pictures Network India. Sony Sports Network will hold exclusive TV broadcast rights for India and non- exclusive rights for Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Maldives, Nepal, and Sri Lanka. All 91-matches will be telecast on Sony Ten 2 and pushed to other channels too if there is a double header.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128338674,imgsize-56580,width-400,resizemode-4/fancode-sony.jpg"

Cam Newton's personal life: Kids and more



Former Carolina Panthers quarterback Cam Newton is facing fresh backlash after remarks made during a recent podcast appearance sparked debate online. Speaking on the “It’s Giving - Podcast” with Sarah Fontenot, Newton shared his views on relationships and parenthood. His comments, especially about women with children, quickly circulated across social media.Newton, a father of nine with three different women, responded to a question about whether a woman’s value changes if she has children with multiple partners. His direct answer drew strong reactions. The discussion has since added to a growing list of public statements that have kept the former MVP in headlines.During the podcast conversation, Cam Newton stated, “Women’s value get lower the more children that they have.” The remark came after host Sarah Fontenot asked if he believes “women’s value gets lowered when they have multiple children by multiple men,” and Newton agreed.He explained that he has had similar conversations in his personal life. Referring to one of the mothers of his children, he said, “The guy that you’re dating or will date, if he ain’t willing to love on these five children that you have that ain’t the guy for you, because when I came into your life… I was willing to accept you and whatever you had.”Newton continued, “There’s guys out there that’s going to say ‘them ain’t my kids, I want you.’ But that’s not to say that she can’t find nobody.”His comments triggered widespread criticism online, with many questioning his stance given his own family situation. The debate intensified as clips from the episode spread across platforms.Newton has four children with former fiancée Kia Proctor, who also had a daughter before their relationship. He also has children with LaReina Shaw and comedian Jasmin Brown. Brown recently welcomed a son with Newton in October.The latest controversy follows other remarks that drew attention. On his “Funky Friday” podcast, Newton previously said, “I'm not about to be around no woman platonically,” and added, “I don't have no attractive woman that I'm cool with that I do not have plans on stabbing.”His recent statements continue to generate discussion as audiences weigh in on his perspective and public messaging.","Cam Newton made the comments during a recent podcast appearance.

George Kittle and Christian McCaffrey witness Team USA Men’s Hockey’s dramatic Olympic quarterfinal win



George Kittle and Christian McCaffrey were nowhere near a football field, yet their competitive pulse was impossible to miss. The San Francisco 49ers stars sat among a tense crowd in Milan on Wednesday, fully absorbed in a different kind of battle. Their season had ended weeks earlier, but the edge that defines elite athletes does not fade easily. It simply finds a new outlet.This time, it came inside an Olympic hockey arena. Watching Team USA Men's Hockey fight through a suffocating quarterfinal against Sweden men's national ice hockey team, both players experienced the familiar rhythm of postseason tension. Every shift mattered. Every mistake lingered. For athletes wired like them, it felt close to home.The Americans struck first, and it carried the kind of weight playoff games demand. Dylan Larkin broke through in the second period, giving the United States a fragile 1-0 lead. From there, the game tightened. Chances were rare. Space disappeared. At both ends, goaltenders refused to blink.Connor Hellebuyck stood tall, turning away wave after wave with calm precision.Across the ice, Jacob Markstrom answered with brilliance of his own, frustrating American shooters and keeping Sweden alive. The tension built quietly, then all at once.With just 1:31 left, Mika Zibanejad found the equalizer. Suddenly, the building shifted. Overtime was inevitable. The stakes rose instantly. Three skaters aside. One mistake decides everything.It ended quickly. At 3:27 of overtime, Quinn Hughes fired a wrist shot that rang off the post and in. The release was clean. The reaction was not. The American bench erupted. So did the crowd. Somewhere in the stands, George Kittle and Christian McCaffrey likely felt that familiar rush, the kind that only sudden victory brings.It was more than entertainment. It was a reminder.All this hype is not suprising. During a December episode, Kittle spoke with longtime friend and Nashville Predators forward Filip Forsberg, who represents Sweden internationally.""Olympic hockey is going to be electric,"" Kittle said during the episode. ""For USA-Canada, the puck drops and there's three fights in the first 10 seconds... now we want more!""Team USA now turns toward a semifinal meeting with Slovakia men's national ice hockey team, carrying momentum and belief. For Kittle and McCaffrey, the night offered perspective. They understood the grind they were watching. They knew the work behind it.Soon enough, their own climb begins again.","San Francisco 49ers stars George Kittle and Christian McCaffrey spotted during Team USA Olympic game.

George Kittle reveals why Rams rivalry drives his intensity



Kyle Shanahan, Greg Papa discuss key matchups in 49ers' Week 10 game vs. Rams | 49ers Talk | NBCSBA

George Kittle has never hidden how much the San Francisco 49ers vs Los Angeles Rams rivalry means to him. It shows in the way he talks, and more clearly, in the way he plays. Earlier in the 2025 season, the 49ers edged the Rams 26 to 23 in overtime on the road, a bruising win that revealed their edge. Weeks later, the Rams answered back with a 42 to 26 statement at Levi's Stadium.Those swings capture what this matchup has become. For Kittle, it is not just about standings. It is personal history. He arrived in 2017 when the balance of power leaned heavily toward Los Angeles. Losses piled up. Lessons did too. Over time, they shaped how he approaches these games and what they demand from him and the team.George Kittle traces the edge back to his early seasons, when the Rams set the standard under Sean McVay. ""I don't know, the Rams week is just because when I first got in the league, they were the best team in the division, easily,"" Kittle explained on NBC Sports Bay Area. ""And I think we lost our first four games to them or something like that, or three games to them. And so, it just always made me want to beat them. And every single time I ever play them, I always want to beat them. ""His feelings stretch beyond one opponent. ""The Seahawks and the Cardinals are always they're up there,"" he said, referencing the Seattle Seahawks and Arizona Cardinals.He added with a laugh, ""Division rivals are always up there, just because we play them twice a year, and for some reason, my wife (Claire) hates all three of them, which I just love that out of her. I think her and [49ers kicker] Eddy [Piñeiro] both hate them, and I'm not entirely sure the reason, but they both hate them. ""But the Rams bring something else out of him. ""It probably started in 2019,"" Kittle said. ""The only way to beat these guys, because they're always athletic, they're always talented, they always got a great scheme, they always got a great offense, and the only way to beat them is just to mentally say, screw it. I'm going to be really violent and physical.""Now the longest tenured player drafted by San Francisco, Kittle carries that mindset into every meeting. He understands what these games represent. Not just for him, but for the city stitched across his chest.","George Kittle has never hidden how much the San Francisco 49ers vs Los Angeles Rams rivalry means to him.

Who was Neal Dahlen? How he quietly built championship empires with the 49ers and Denver Broncos



Neal Dahlen built a life in football that rarely drew headlines but often shaped them. The longtime executive, who helped assemble some of the NFL’s greatest rosters, died at 85, the Denver Broncos confirmed Wednesday. His seven Super Bowl rings still stand as quiet proof of his impact. Only Bill Belichick has more, while Dahlen shares second place with Tom Brady, an astonishing tie for someone who never played a snap.What defined Dahlen was not just the total, but the timing. He had a gift for arriving before greatness fully formed, then helping guide it into reality. From San Francisco’s dynasty years to Denver’s championship breakthrough, his fingerprints were everywhere, even if his name stayed in the background.Neal Dahlen’s story truly began with the San Francisco 49ers in 1979, when the franchise was struggling and searching for direction. Working closely with coach Bill Walsh, Dahlen played a key role in spotting a skinny receiver from Mississippi Valley State University. Many were unsure. Walsh and Dahlen were not.“Bill could see Jerry was something special; that he could transform the 49ers' passing game,” Dahlen said in a 2015 feature at Levi's Stadium.“His thinking was, ‘just get Rice. Do what you have to do to get him.’”The team traded with the New England Patriots to secure the pick and select Jerry Rice. That decision changed football. Rice became the standard for excellence, while San Francisco captured multiple championships with stars like Joe Montana leading the way.Dahlen was part of Denver's back-to-back Super Bowl XXXII and XXXIII wins following his role as a member of San Francisco's run with Super Bowl victories in the 1981, '84, '88, '89 and 1994 seasons. He also served as the Broncos general manager from 1999-2001.Dahlen’s touch did not fade. He helped bring in defenders like Charles Haley and later pushed for the signing of Deion Sanders, whose presence fueled another title run in 1994. He understood how one bold move could tilt a season.In 1996, Dahlen moved to Denver, joining a team still chasing its first championship. Working alongside quarterback John Elway, running back Terrell Davis, and coach Mike Shanahan, he helped build rosters that won back to back Super Bowls. He later became general manager, guiding the team through its next phase.Dahlen’s career began with a two win team and ended with a legacy few can match. Those who worked with him often spoke of his calm belief. He did not chase credit. He chased the right players, the right fit, and the right moment. The rings followed.","Neal Dahlen was part of the San Francisco 49ers dynasty of the 1980s and 1990s. Dahlen helped bring in players like Deion Sanders, Charles Haley, and Terrell Davis.

Myles Garrett and Chloe Kim celebrate Valentine’s Day after Olympic silver



Myles Garrett did not need a press conference to make it clear. The Cleveland Browns star let a T shirt do the talking for him and for Chloe Kim. On Valentine’s Day, Kim shared a photo of Garrett wearing a bold gift she picked out herself. Across the back, it read, ""I ❤︎⁠ my super hot beautiful girlfriend. So please stay away from me."" It was playful, loud, and impossible to miss. So was the message behind it.The post marked their first Valentine’s Day together, nearly a year after they were first linked in May 2025 and months after confirming their relationship publicly in November. Kim captioned the carousel, ""blinked and suddenly I had a Valentine ❤️ and yes I bought him the shirt."" Garrett, never one to miss a chance to respond, jumped into the comments with, ""Still waiting for you to wear my shirt 🙄."" Kim shot back, ""🫡 I’m on it!!"" It felt easy. Natural. Like two people enjoying the moment.The timing mattered. Just two days earlier, Chloe Kim had claimed silver in the women’s halfpipe at the 2026 Winter Olympics. She posted a best score of 88.00, finishing just behind South Korea’s Choi Gaon. Kim had hoped to become the first woman to win three straight Olympic gold medals in the event.Instead, she settled for silver. And she smiled.Garrett was there through it all. He watched from the crowd in a jacket featuring a giant photo of Kim, beaming as she landed backside 720s and double cork 1080s. At one point, he even picked up a long lens camera and played photographer. When the final score flashed and her medal was secured, he met her with a kiss. It was quiet support, but unmistakable.Kim’s silver came after a difficult few weeks. She had torn her labrum in January during practice. The injury threatened her buildup, yet she pushed through and delivered another podium finish, adding to her collection of three Olympic medals. That context made Garrett’s tribute feel deeper. He wrote, ""So proud of you! I’m thankful that I get to be by your side watching the extraordinary things you do. You fought through so much to even get to this point and you earned everything and more. The 🐐, my love and my Valentine. Happy Valentine’s Day babe ❤️."" Kim replied, ""My love!! Thank you for dealing with my craziness over the last couple months. Grateful for you, forever my Valentine ❤️.""The photos, the jokes, the jacket, the kiss. None of it felt staged. Just two elite athletes finding joy in each other’s biggest moments.",Myles Garrett and Chloe Kim celebrate Valentine's Day after Olympic silver medal.

Breaking Down the Chiefs' Master Plan: Mahomes, Hill, and Kelce Reunion Inches Closer

The Kansas City Chiefs aren't just looking to fix a 6-11 season, they are looking to reclaim their identity. According to league sources, the blockbuster restructure of Patrick Mahomes ’ contract on Wednesday was more than just a cap-compliance move, it was the opening plan to reunite the most feared trio in modern NFL history.With the Miami Dolphins officially releasing Tyreek Hill earlier this week, the ""Reunite the Band"" rumors have shifted from fan fiction to a legitimate front-office priority.Insiders close to the situation suggest that Hill, currently recovering from a major knee injury, has already ""circled"" Kansas City as his preferred destination. While several teams like the Denver Broncos are reportedly in the mix, the sentiment among league executives is that if the money makes sense, Hill is ""Chiefs-bound."" Adding a deep threat of his caliber, even one rehabbing an ACL would instantly solve the explosive-play deficit that plagued Andy Reid’s offense in 2025.Perhaps more importantly, the $43.56 million in newly created cap space appears to have settled the biggest question in Kansas City: Travis Kelce’s retirement. While the All-Pro tight end has spent the last month weighing his future, sources indicate that the prospect of one ""Last Dance"" alongside Mahomes and a returning Hill has reinvigorated the future Hall of Famer.It’s no coincidence that Mahomes’ restructure happened within 48 hours of Hill hitting the open market. By dropping his cap hit from $78.2 million to $34.65 million, Mahomes has given GM Brett Veach the ""ammunition"" needed to offer Hill an incentive-laden deal while still securing Kelce’s roster spot.The Chiefs have the money, the motivation, and the MVP. While ""The Band"" isn't officially back together yet, the stage has been set for a blockbuster offseason. While the ink isn't dry on a contract for Hill, the signals are loud and clear. The Chiefs aren't rebuilding, they’re reloading with the familiar faces that built their dynasty.","The Kansas City Chiefs restructure quarterback Patrick Mahomes' contract.

The Philadelphia 76ers return from the All-Star break facing urgency. With 28 games left in the regular season, every result matters in a tight Eastern Conference race. Their first test comes Thursday night against the Atlanta Hawks. However, as per recent updates, Sixers’ big man Joel Embiid will not play Thursday’s game.The Sixers confirmed the update after Embiid experienced soreness in his right shin during the break. The team sits at 30-24 and sixth in the East. They have struggled without their franchise center, losing six of the last seven games he missed. With Paul George serving a suspension, Philadelphia enters this matchup short-handed and searching for stability.The organization released a detailed medical update before Thursday’s game. The statement read: “While participating in a right knee injury management program during the All-Star break, Joel Embiid reported soreness in his right shin. Following a consultation with doctors, Embiid has received daily treatment, while progressing through on-court work and strength conditioning. Further updates will be provided later this week.A team official later added, “While participating in a right knee injury management program, Joel Embiid reported soreness in his right shin. Following a consultation with doctors, Embiid has received daily treatment, while progressing through on-court work and strength and conditioning.“He will be out for tomorrow night’s game vs. Atlanta and re-evaluated ahead of the team’s back-to-back this weekend. Further updates will be provided later this week.”Head coach Nick Nurse offered a brief on-court observation after Wednesday’s practice. According to Nurse, Embiid “was out there a little bit” and “looked pretty good.” The center will be evaluated again before the weekend road back-to-back in New Orleans and Minnesota.Despite the latest setback, Embiid’s availability has improved compared to recent years. The former Kia NBA MVP has played 31 games, 12 more than he managed last season. He is averaging 26.6 points, 7.5 rebounds and 3.6 assists while operating without the strict minute limits that once defined his workload.His presence has shaped Philadelphia’s season. The 7-footer delivered dominant stretches, including a 40-point, 11-rebound performance last month. His health has often dictated the team’s rhythm. That trend continues now.","The Philadelphia 76ers return from the All-Star break against the Atlanta Hawks. Joel Embiid experienced soreness in his right shin during the break.

What LeBron James Has Said

The Team’s Position

The Los Angeles Lakers are heading into the offseason without clarity on LeBron James’ future. He is 41, still productive, and on an expiring contract.

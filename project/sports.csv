From Lahli to Navi Mumbai: Shafali Verma's return gift to idol Sachin Tendulkar,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/icc-womens-world-cup-2025/from-lahli-to-navi-mumbai-shafali-vermas-return-gift-to-idol-sachin-tendulkar/articleshow/125071936.cms,"Shafali Verma (@BCCIWomen X/ANI Photo)

New Delhi:

Harmanpreet Kaur gets emotional after leading India to World Cup glory

The last time Shafali Verma’s father, Sanjeev Verma, closed his jewellery shop for four days was in 2013, when Sachin Tendulkar was in Rohtak, playing his last first-class match at Chaudhary Bansi Lal Cricket Stadium in Lahli.Sanjeev was then forced by his nine-year-old daughter to take her to the stadium to catch a glimpse of Tendulkar, whose poster she had bought from the Dussehra fair just a couple of weeks earlier.He vividly recalls how he had to carry his daughter on his shoulders so she could see her idol.“Jeena mushkil kar diya tha Sachin ko dekhne ke liye (She had made my life difficult just to see Sachin). She was very young and used to play cricket with a tennis ball. But after the final day, when Sachin scored 79 not out and Mumbai won the match, she told me, ‘Papa, ab bahut hua tennis ball, ab Sachin ki tarah leather se khelna hai’ (Enough with the tennis ball, now I want to play with the leather ball like Sachin),” Sanjeev told TimesofIndia.com after his daughter’s exploits in the ICC Women’s World Cup final in Navi Mumbai on Sunday.On Sunday, life came full circle for Shafali. She gifted India a World Cup in her idol’s backyard, with Tendulkar watching from the stands.It seemed written in the stars that Shafali would play a big role in India’s first Women’s World Cup triumph with Tendulkar cheering her every run, just as she had cheered for him 12 years ago in Lahli.“When people were chanting ‘Shafali, Shafali’ in our street, it took me back to 2013, when Shafali was shouting ‘Sachiiin, Sachiiin’ at Lahli,” said an emotional father.Shafali, who was not even in the standbys and was with the Haryana State team in Surat for the Senior Women’s T20 Trophy, got the call-up after in-form Pratika Rawal was ruled out due to injury during India’s last league match against Bangladesh.“She is generally a very confident kid, but I sensed a bit of nerves in her eyes,” said Mahipal Singh , coach of the Haryana women’s side.“I told her, ‘You’ve got this. The management knows your importance and that’s why they’ve called you. Just be yourself, a destructive opener. This is your chance to shine. You are the chosen one,’” Mahipal recalled.After India reached the final, the nerves caught up with Shafali. Barring the inaugural U-19 World Cup final in 2023, she had never won a final. Her WPL franchise - Delhi Capitals - had lost three finals. The T20 World Cup final defeat to Australia at the MCG and the Commonwealth Games final loss in Birmingham still haunt her.Shafali, who went into a shell after being left out of the World Cup squad, cried her heart out in front of her father. On the eve of the big final, she called her family.“I know my daughter. Straightaway, I knew something was off. After she spoke to everyone, I took the mobile, sat in another room, and asked her what’s wrong. She said, ‘Papa, darr lag raha hai, final mein record acha nahi hai mera (I’m scared, I don’t have a good record in finals),” shared Sanjeev.“I reminded her of the day she was dropped from the side. I told her she’s gone through worse. She’s 21 and has already seen enough ups and downs. I reminded her of her journey — when I had cut her hair like a boy so she could play cricket, when she first went to Ram Narain Academy. I told her that her god, Sachin, would be watching the match. She calmed down, and the way she played was just mind-blowing,” he said.Ashwani Kumar, a former Haryana opener and ex-coach of the state team, has trained Shafali for the past four years.“She came to us when she was nine, and I was mesmerized by her potential. She was no match for the girls in my academy, so I made her play with the U-19 boys. She used to take those bowlers to the cleaners. She’s a natural talent, just like Sachin was. For her, offence is the best defence,” Ashwani said.Since bursting onto the scene as a teenage sensation, Shafali had struggled to meet expectations. Inconsistency crept in. Her fitness became an issue, and her inability to rotate the strike cost her a place in the ODI side. However, she remained part of India’s Test and T20I setups.Krushmi Chheda Pawar, a sports scientist and performance nutritionist, who has worked with the Haryana Cricket Association (HCA) for the past three years, opened up about Shafali’s fitness journey.“Yes, she did shed a few kilos. She’s worked tirelessly on her fitness, but it took her some time to reach this level,” said Krushmi.“A 16-year-old boy is different from a girl of the same age. Post-puberty, boys tend to lose body fat, but for girls, it’s the opposite. It becomes tougher for female athletes.“She’s been focusing on her overall fitness — diet, nutrition, and strength training. Everything has come together now. She’s realised that nutrition isn’t just about losing weight, it’s also about recovery. With experience, she’s become more disciplined,” Krushmi added.After ticking the fitness box, Shafali worked on her game, especially strike rotation and bowling. Both clicked on Sunday. She ran 37 singles and five twos to go with seven boundaries and two sixes during her 78-ball 87 in the final. Then, she picked up two crucial wickets — Sune Luus and Marizanne Kapp — which derailed South Africa’s chase.“She’s been bowling her full quota for Haryana regularly. She’s stopped playing cross-batted shots, following advice from her WPL captain Meg Lanning . She’s tweaked her technique a bit. Earlier, her head used to tilt slightly backward; now, she positions it slightly forward, which has improved her perception of the ball’s height and length,” said Mahipal.“At Rohtak, we worked on her strike rotation, hit a boundary, then look for singles unless it’s in your arc. The results have started to show, and now we’ll work on her game against short-pitched bowling,” he added.Shafali is still only 21. As a nine-year-old, she had dreamt of playing 20 years for her country after watching Sachin in Lahli. That dream is still alive, and with her idol’s presence at DY Patil Stadium, she found calm and inspiration.“When I saw Sachin sir, I had an unbelievable feeling. I keep talking with him; he always gives me confidence. But I had goosebumps seeing him today,” she said at the post-match presentation.After all these years, Shafali remains in awe of Sachin and the legend still inspires her. But there’s one small difference: now, amid “Sachin! Sachin!” chants, she also hears “Shafali! Shafali!”",Shafali Verma played a key role in India's ICC Women's World Cup triumph. She was not even in the standbys and was with the Haryana State team in Surat for the Senior Women’s T20 Trophy.

The first thing that comes to mind when I think of Rohan is that he’s been one of the biggest and most genuine supporters of Indian tennis Divij Sharan

Longevity. Perseverance. Inspiring. Passionate. Fine wine. Icon.These are some of the fitting words that Rohan Bopanna ’s peers in Indian tennis used for him after he called time on an incredible 22-year professional career.In Indian tennis, longevity is not new. Leander Paes retired in 2020 at 47 years old. Mahesh Bhupathi played until he was 42 in 2016. Sania Mirza was 36 when she exited the big stage in 2023. And now, Bopanna does so as a 45-year-old.What makes him unique, in multiple ways, is that his best came at a late juncture in his career. If one were to Google for persistence, Rohan Bopanna’s CV should pop up. Two Grand Slam trophies, six Masters 1000 titles, 26 ATP doubles titles, two Asian Games gold medals and World No. 1 ranking.Beyond these highlights would be the asterisk to point out that he became the oldest Grand Slam champion, oldest Masters 1000 champion, oldest ATP 500 finalist and oldest first-time World No. 1. Fittingly, ‘Level 43’ was coined after the 2024 Australian Open crown.If you dig deeper, the tenacity becomes clearer still. He won his first Grand Slam - the 2017 French Open mixed doubles - as 37 years old. This was his second major final - seven years after he and his Pakistani doubles partner Aisam-ul-Haq Qureshi suffered defeat in New York.11 years had passed between his career-best rankings of World No. 3 and World No. 1. And then there was the 13-year gap between first and second appearance in the final of a men's doubles Grand Slam final.“Rohan sir showed that age is never a ceiling when you have discipline, belief, and the courage to keep evolving. He made consistency look effortless, but behind it was years of hard work and an incredible mindset,” said a young Shrivalli Bhamidipaty to TimesofIndia.com.Amid slew of controversies that plagued Indian tennis during the 2010s, Bopanna focused on the sport. He plucked multiple small titles and progressed to the second week of majors on a consistent basis. His long-time physio Yash Pandey captured that with a walk down memory lane.""I cannot forget the Paris Masters title that we won in 2012 - that was my first title with Rohan and Mahesh. The semi-finals match was against Paes-Stepanek [Radek Stepanek] at the World Tour finals. The 2013 Tokyo title which got him to World No. 3 (his highest ranking then and for so many years). The Wimbledon of 2015 when Rohan and Florin (Mergea) beat (the) Bryan brothers in the quarters and a heartbreaking defeat in (the) semis against (Jean-Julien) Rojer and (Horia) Tecau 11-13 in the fifth set. The mixed doubles match at the 2016 Rio Olympics where we (Bopanna and Mirza) lost a medal by 7 points against (Rajeev) Ram and Venus (Williams),” recollected Pandey.And with this longevity came the experience to read the game perfectly.Divij Sharan, alongside whom Bopanna won the 2018 Asian Games gold medal, recalled a Bopanna-inspired tactical change which swung the semi-final around. “They [Japanese pairing] were zoning and took the first set off us. During the changeover, Rohan said, ‘Let’s switch sides in the second set.’ That small tactical move threw them off completely. We won the second set, then the match tiebreak, and went on to win gold for India. His experience was invaluable — not just in that match, but in so many key moments we’ve shared.”Another aspect that makes Bopanna unique is in his desire to give back to tennis. In a sport that is significantly selfish by nature of its demands, Bopanna launched and mentored the ‘Doubles Dream of India’ to support the ATP doubles players with coaches, physios and support in enhancing their performance. On the court, Bopanna is a vocal presence when his peers are playing.When Sumit Nagal made history during the 2024 Australian Open, Bopanna was courtside and offered plenty of support. It has been the theme during the majors, during the ATP tournaments and at Davis Cup. He is one of the first to get up and offer support to his younger teammates.“The first thing that comes to mind when I think of Rohan is that he’s been one of the biggest and most genuine supporters of Indian tennis,” said Divij Sharan, with whom Bopanna won the 2019 Maharashtra Open.Prajnesh Gunneswaran echoed his thoughts. “Rohan’s always been the kind of guy who actually shows up. Whether it’s Davis Cup or an ATP event, if we’re at the same tournament, he’ll somehow find the time to watch every match and cheer you on — even with his own packed schedule. It’s never just for show; he’s genuinely there to support.""Vishnu Vardhan looks back at his 2011 Davis Cup debut against Kei Nishikori of Japan for his fondest memory of Bopanna. ""I was really nervous getting on the court. I was in the locker room and Rohan just walks in, smiles and plays Bollywood music, tells me to relax, dance on the court, he lightened up the mood for me. I owe a large part of my fighting debut to Rohan. He has always been special for me,"" stated Vardhan before adding he wished Bopanna and Mirza had gone on to clinch the medal at the Rio Olympics.Even in his decision to step away from the Davis Cup in 2023, Bopanna had one eye on the future. “I’ve been here for two decades, and there are a lot of other players who are coming up and doing well, who can take that spot,” he had said then. It came moments after he had replicated Ben Shelton’s hang-up-the-phone celebration with 23-year-old Digvijay Pratap Singh - who was only two years old when Bopanna had made his Davis Cup debut in 2002.The bricks, quite literally, in shaping the future of Indian tennis were placed in Bengaluru in 2016 which later came to be known as the Rohan Bopanna Tennis Academy (RBTA). Besides initiatives such as housing 25 underprivileged kids from Assam in 2024, the academy nurtured and built the 2019 national champion Niki Poonacha. “Pure passion, dedication and commitment for playing the sport for this long at the highest level and to improve the sport in India. Huge respect for that,” said Poonacha who proudly recalls taking a practice set off Bopanna despite being aced 10 times!As Bopanna steps away from the court as a pro player, his love for the sport will continue to reflect in the manner of a mentor, academy owner and name behind getting the UTR Tennis Pro to India. What will be missing, though, is the tenacity that he brought to the court each time he stepped up and the words of a philosophical journeyman of Indian tennis.","Rohan Bopanna announced his retirement from professional tennis on Saturday. The 45-year-old won two Grand Slam trophies, six Masters 1000 titles, 26 ATP doubles titles, two Asian Games gold medals and World No. 1 ranking. He won the 2024 Australian Open men's doubles title with Matt Ebden.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125073183,imgsize-140140,width-400,resizemode-4/rohan-bopanna-announces-retirement.jpg"

'It hurts, but I’m proud': Laura Wolvaardt reacts after South Africa’s World Cup final loss

While India rejoiced after lifting the 2025 ICC Women’s ODI World Cup at a packed DY Patil Stadium in Navi Mumbai, the reaction back in South Africa was very different. Among the loudest voices came from Cape Town, where actress, writer, and avid cricket follower Thanja Vuur sparked a storm with her scathing remarks about her own country’s absence of support.In a viral Instagram reel posted from her handle @cape_town_cricket_queen, Vuur questioned why South Africa’s top cricket figures and influential personalities failed to turn up for the final. Her video has since triggered a heated debate across both nations.“Who the hell showed up from South Africa?” she began, pointing out the contrast between India’s overwhelming presence in the stands and South Africa’s silence.Click here to watch: South African actress blasts over for skipping Women’s World Cup final Before her criticism, Vuur took a moment to praise Indian fans for their unmatched passion. “India, you win this World Cup. Your congratulations is coming. Just give me a few minutes because first I’m gonna tell you why. The reason is you,” she said.She highlighted how legends like Sachin Tendulkar , Rohit Sharma, VVS Laxman, and Sunil Gavaskar were all seen at the venue, along with several ICC and franchise figures.According to her, that was the difference between the two cricketing nations.Turning the spotlight on her own country, Vuur launched into the line that has gone viral: “Who the hell showed up from South Africa? These ex-cricket players that you love from South Africa, the men.... where are they? Oh, this event was not high-profile enough for them.”Her criticism did not end there. Vuur expressed her disappointment over the absence of South Africa’s political and sports leadership, saying she was “disappointed that not even the Sports Minister” attended the final.“The girls worked so hard. They did so well. But what does it feel like when none of these people show up? Did they just think we were gonna lose? Is that the message they’re sending?” she asked, framing the moment as one of emotional neglect as much as defeat.Vuur’s reel later shifted focus back to India, where she credited the country’s cricket culture and passionate fans for driving the team to glory. “You guys live and breathe this sport... It is breakfast, lunch, and dinner. You are the winners of this World Cup. And you know what? You deserve it,” she said, emphasising the connection between fan energy and the team’s success.Her comments have since opened up a serious discussion in South Africa about how women’s cricket is valued, and why on the most important night of their careers, the players were left without the support of their own icons and leaders.","Actress Thanja Vuur questioned why South Africa's top cricket figures and influential personalities failed to turn up for the final.

Harmanpreet Kaur gets emotional after leading India to World Cup glory

Former India off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin has lavished praise on India’s young left-arm spinner Sree Charani for her exceptional performance in the 2025 ICC Women’s World Cup. The 39-year-old veteran believes the youngster has all the makings of a future superstar and broke down the technical brilliance behind her success since debuting for India earlier this year in April.Charani ended her first-ever ODI World Cup campaign with 14 wickets in nine matches at an average of 27.64, including standout spells in the knockout stages. The 21-year-old held her nerve under pressure, returning figures of 2 for 49 in the semi-final and 1 for 48 in the final, helping India script a historic title win.“Her ball rotation is at the correct speed. It matches Sophie Ecclestone, Jess Jonassen or Sophie Molineux, her weight transfer. She goes into a lovely side-on position. From there, her hand comes to the front. There is no collapse anywhere. There is no energy leakage,” Ashwin explained on his YouTube channel.“She crushed the World Cup. She is the biggest reason for India to win this World Cup. She is going to be a superstar bowler in the future,” he added.Ashwin also drew parallels between India’s 2025 triumph and past landmark victories in Indian cricket, saying that the seeds sown by captain Harmanpreet Kaur and her team will be remembered for generations — just like the iconic World Cup wins under Kapil Dev and MS Dhoni .“The thing is, coming from a place like this, Harmanpreet Kaur would have seen a lot of disappointments. The 2017 World Cup final, for instance, where they beat Australia and lost to England in the final. Jhulan Goswami was there. Harmanpreet Kaur has seen such things. She has faced defeats. She has seen defeats from situations where the World Cup could have been won. From outside, you may not be witness to the effort she has put in,” Ashwin said.“The seed she has sown — after 10 or 20 years, how Kapil Dev sowed it, how Dhoni sowed it in 2011 or 2007 — like how we talk about those, we will talk about this as well,” he concluded.","Sree Charani has all the makings of a future superstar, says Ravichandran Ashwin.

Harmanpreet Kaur gets emotional after leading India to World Cup glory

India’s Women’s World Cup 2025 triumph was nothing short of a fairytale. Few had expected Harmanpreet Kaur ’s side to even reach the final, especially after a shaky group stage that nearly ended their campaign. But what followed was one of the most remarkable turnarounds in Indian cricket history — one that, as Harmanpreet revealed, began with a fiery team talk from head coach Amol Muzumdar The hosts had started the tournament brightly with wins against Sri Lanka and Pakistan, before stumbling badly with consecutive defeats to South Africa, Australia and England. With their semifinal hopes hanging by a thread, India needed a spark. That moment came after the loss to England, when Muzumdar gave the team a stern reminder of what was at stake.Recalling that turning point after India’s 52-run win over South Africa in the final, Harmanpreet said, “The last month has been very interesting. It’s very rare that things don’t go according to your plan, and yet you stay so positive. We were really looking for this cup — that was something special in our group. Not a single player said, ‘What will we do now?’”She added, “Everybody just thought, ‘It’s okay.’ After losing the England match, we were really heartbroken. We were about to win that match, but we collapsed. We had seen this in the past. That day, (Amol Muzumdar) Sir also said, ‘You can’t make the same mistakes again and again. You have to cross that line’. After that day, a lot changed for us. Every time, we cannot go on repeating the same things. We had to come with a strong mind. That night changed a lot for us. It had an impact on everyone.”India went on to defeat New Zealand in a virtual quarter-final, shocked Australia in the semifinals, and sealed the title with an all-round show from Deepti Sharma and Shafali Verma in the final.Reflecting on the historic moment, Harmanpreet said, “We have been talking about this for many years – we’ve been playing good cricket, but we had to win one big tournament. (But) without that, we couldn’t talk about change.”“At the end of the day, fans and the audience want to see their favourite team win. It’s not that we weren’t playing good cricket, but we were waiting badly for this moment, and today we got a chance to live it. I don’t know how to express it, but I’m so happy and so proud of this team. I’m just trying to express what I’m feeling. I am numb. I am not able to understand.

Harmanpreet Kaur gets emotional after leading India to World Cup glory

NAVI MUMBAI: The ending of the fairytale called India's maiden Women's World Cup triumph couldn't have been more fitting. Chasing a low full toss, South African big-hitter Nadine de Klerk, who had smashed a 54-ball 84 not out in the league phase to inflict a three-wicket defeat on India, chipped the ball to extra cover, where Indian captain Harmanpreet Kaur jogged backwards to take the catch. Having slammed a valuable half-century (58, 58b, 3x4, 1x6) earlier, Deepti Sharma took a five-for (5 for 39 in 9.3 overs), making the final her own with both bat and ball while fashioning India's biggest-ever victory in women’s cricket.Soon after, a 45,000-strong crowd, along with the Indian team, broke into celebrations, with Harman and the Women in Blue breaking into tears of joy.Finally, the Indian women’s cricket team’s ‘83 moment had arrived. Fighting back after suffering three defeats on the trot that had put their World Cup campaign in danger, India won the three matches that mattered to cross the line — at last, after numerous heartbreaks.Outclassing South Africa by 52 runs in the final of the 2025 Women’s ODI World Cup at the DY Patil Stadium on Sunday night, with 45,000 fans cheering them, India finally put an end to their long wait for an elusive World Cup crown. A billion hearts can now celebrate the Women in Blue’s memorable, historic, game-changing triumph for women’s cricket in India for a long time to come — courtesy of a player who wasn’t even in the reserves!“God has sent me here to do something good,” Shafali Verma had said before India slayed giants Australia in the semifinals, thanks to a brilliant hundred by Jemimah Rodrigues.Unfurling a blistering, career-best 87 (78b, 7x4, 2x6), which helped India post 298 for six after being asked to bat first, and later taking two for 36 in seven overs, Shafali Verma — marking a fairytale comeback — played a massive part in India posting 298 for six after a two-hour rain delay, and then striking vital blows when South Africa looked to be cruising in their chase at one stage.Following up on a match-winning epic knock of 169 in the semifinal against England at Guwahati, South African captain and opener Laura Wolvaardt slammed another superb century (101, 98b, 10x4, 1x6). But when she was caught — in the fielder's third attempt — by a sprinting Amanjot Kaur off Deepti in the 42nd over, the game was firmly in India's grip.The Proteas crumbled under the pressure of a tall chase and a home crowd that cheered their team to the historic win all the way. Chasing 299, South Africa seemed to be coasting at 114 for two in the 21st over, before Shafali’s twin strikes — she caught Sune Luus (25, 31b, 4x4) off her own innocuous-looking delivery, and had Marizanne Kapp (4) caught behind in her next over.Wolvaardt and fellow opener Tazmin Brits (23, 35b, 2x4, 1x6) had added 51 in 57 balls before Amanjot Kaur produced a direct hit to give India the first breakthrough. Soon, Anneke Bosch, who had a poor game as she dropped a sitter at deep mid-wicket off Shafali when the batter was on 57, was trapped on the back foot by Shree Charani for a six-ball duck.Banking too heavily on their in-form captain, South Africa were brought back into the game by Annerie Dercksen (25 off 37 balls), but Deepti yorked her in the 40th over to put India in the driver's seat.Earlier, Shafali Verma's blistering, career-best 87 (78b, 7x4, 2x6) and Deepti Sharma's composed half-century (58, 58b, 3x4, 1x6), along with fine support acts by Smriti Mandhana (45, 58b, 8x4) and Richa Ghosh (34 off 24 balls, 3x4, 2x6), helped India post a challenging, yet slightly under-par total of 298 for six against South Africa in the 2025 Women's ODI World Cup final at the DY Patil Stadium on Sunday.Asked to bat after a two-hour delayed start due to unseasonal rain, India were off to a flying start as Shafali, recalled for the knockouts after Pratika Rawal's injury, and vice-captain Smriti Mandhana (45), cheered by a vociferous home crowd of 45,000, added 104 for the opening wicket in 106 balls to lay the platform for a big total. It was just the second hundred-run opening stand in WODI World Cup finals.Playing delightful strokes, the duo brought up India’s fifty in just 39 balls, as the tournament hosts raced away to 64 for no loss in 10 overs. Looking to take on the bowlers by charging down repeatedly, Shafali tonked two sixes down the ground — the second one off de Klerk being a treat to watch.Scoring her first WODI fifty in over three years — the last one came against South Africa too, in July 2022 — Shafali, who scored her fifth half-century off 49 balls, took the bull by the horns, taking the attack to the Proteas before falling short of her maiden century when she perished while trying to clear mid-off off the spirited Ayabonga Khaka, who was the pick of the bowlers, taking three for 58 in nine overs and striking at regular intervals to keep South Africa in the game.Shafali's 87 is now the highest-ever individual score by an Indian opening batter in a World Cup final — men or women, ODI or T20I. At 21 years and 278 days, she's also the youngest player to score a fifty in a Women's ODI World Cup final.The Proteas heaved a sigh of relief when Mandhana was caught behind while trying to cut Chloe Tryon, but Shafali, who hit the very first ball she faced in the final — from Khaka — for a four past point, kept going, adding 62 in 62 balls for the second wicket with semifinal centurion Jemimah Rodrigues (24 off 37 balls, one four).Striving for their maiden World Cup triumph like India, South Africa were also boosted by an economical spell by left-arm spinner Nonkululeko Mlaba, who took one for 47 in 10 overs on a batting beauty, putting the brakes on India's innings.Fighting back after India's commanding start, South Africa did well to deny the tournament hosts a psychological 300-mark. Still, India recorded the second-highest total ever in a Women's ODI World Cup final, behind Australia's 356 for five against England in the 2022 World Cup.Striking in successive overs, Khaka removed Shafali and Jemimah (caught at extra cover), while Mlaba castled skipper Harmanpreet Kaur (20 off 29 balls), ending her promising 56-ball, 52-run partnership with Deepti Sharma for the fourth wicket.India were cruising at 223 for three in the 39th over when Harman was dismissed while trying to play a late cut. That blow saw them get just 75 in the remaining overs, mostly thanks to Richa's lusty blows and her 35-ball, 47-run partnership for the sixth wicket with Deepti that brought the crowd alive. Richa had hammered a power-packed, fighting 94 off 77 balls when these two teams met in the group stage, and gave impetus to India's innings on Sunday, smashing sixes off de Klerk and Kapp — a super shot over extra cover off a wide yorker.Anchoring the innings, Deepti stroked her 18th ODI half-century and third in this tournament before she was run out off the last ball.While their ground fielding was brilliant, South Africa dropped a couple of catches. They first let off Shafali when, batting on 53 in the 21st over, she slog-swept Sune Luus to deep mid-wicket, where Anneke Bosch fluffed the chance, and in the 40th over, skipper Laura Wolvaardt grassed Deepti’s catch at long-on. In between, Marizanne Kapp dropped a slightly tougher chance off Deepti off her own bowling.","India beat South Africa by 52 runs in the final of the 2025 Women’s ODI World Cup at the DY Patil Stadium on Sunday night. Deepti Sharma took a five-for (5 for 39 in 9.3 overs), making the final her own with both bat and ball while fashioning India's biggest-ever victory in women's cricket.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125041517,imgsize-128366,width-400,resizemode-4/india-trophy-0311-pti.jpg"

The Indian women’s cricket team’s World Cup victory in 2025 wasn’t just a sporting milestone — it was an emotional full circle. Years of heartbreak, hard work, and hope finally came together in one unforgettable night. The moment India lifted that trophy, millions across the country celebrated the women who had rewritten history.The win has also drawn attention to how far women’s cricket has evolved — not just in achievements but in financial recognition too.Born in Jodhpur on December 3, 1982, Mithali Raj grew up in a Tamil family deeply rooted in discipline and service. Her father, Dorai Raj, served as a warrant officer in the Indian Air Force, while her mother, Leela Raj, supported her dream from an early age. Mithali began playing cricket at just 10 years old, practising alongside her elder brother.Over the years, Mithali has created countless records that transformed women’s cricket in India. She remains the highest run-scorer in women’s international cricket, with her calm batting and unmatched consistency inspiring generations.With an estimated net worth of ₹40–45 crore, Mithali is also India’s wealthiest female cricketer.Even after retiring, she continues to earn through brand endorsements, mentorship roles, and her strong presence in cricket development initiatives. Her journey from Jodhpur’s dusty grounds to global glory remains one of Indian sport’s most inspiring stories.At 29, Smriti Mandhana is not just a cricketing star but a brand in herself. Her net worth, estimated between ₹32–34 crore, comes from a mix of cricket earnings, endorsements, and business ventures. Smriti holds a Grade A BCCI contract worth ₹50 lakh a year and earns ₹3.4 crore from the Women’s Premier League, where she captains Royal Challengers Bengaluru. Off the field, she endorses global brands like Hyundai, Nike, and Red Bull, and her deals often fetch ₹50–75 lakh each.She lives in a beautiful home in Sangli, complete with a personal gym, theatre, and even a small café she owns called SM-18 Sports Café. Her charm, discipline, and success have made her one of India’s most marketable athletes.After leading India to their first-ever World Cup title, Harmanpreet Kaur has become a household name across the country. Her net worth estimated at around ₹25 crore, reflects not only her cricketing success but also her growing brand value. Harmanpreet earns ₹50 lakh annually from her BCCI Grade A contract and ₹1.8 crore per season with Mumbai Indians in the WPL.She also serves as a Deputy Superintendent of Police in Punjab, adding to her steady income. Endorsements form a large part of her wealth, with partnerships with PUMA, CEAT, HDFC Life, and Boost bringing in up to ₹50 lakh a year. Off the field, she owns homes in Patiala and Mumbai, drives luxury cars, and is known for her love of motorbikes.At 36, she became the oldest captain to win the Women’s World Cup, proving that experience and belief can break any barrier. Her journey from Moga to Mumbai stands as a symbol of resilience and leadership.The rise of these stars shows how far women’s cricket in India has come. With the WPL and international recognition, financial stability is no longer a dream but a reality for many players. From Mithali’s pioneering days to Smriti’s modern stardom and Harmanpreet’s championship moment, India’s women cricketers are not just winning matches — they are changing the face of Indian sport forever.","India Women's cricketers to become CROREPATIS after World Cup win.

Harmanpreet Kaur gets emotional after leading India to World Cup glory

NEW DELHI: The BCCI has yet to finalise any plans for a grand victory parade to celebrate the women’s cricket team’s historic ICC World Cup triumph, secretary Devajit Saikia told IANS on Monday.India’s women ended their title drought in emphatic fashion on Sunday, lifting their maiden ICC World Cup after defeating first-time finalists South Africa by 52 runs at Navi Mumbai’s DY Patil Stadium. The moment marked a new chapter for Indian cricket — but fans may have to wait a little longer before seeing the champions parade the trophy through the streets.“Nothing like a victory parade is planned as of now,” Saikia said while speaking from Mumbai airport. “I’m leaving for Dubai to attend the ICC meetings. Several senior officials are heading there as well, so once we return, we will plan accordingly.”The ICC meetings, scheduled from November 4–7 in Dubai, will occupy most of the BCCI’s top brass this week. Once concluded, the board is expected to chart out the official celebration plans, including a potential felicitation ceremony for Harmanpreet Kaur ’s trailblazing team.Saikia also confirmed that the BCCI would raise the issue of the missing Asia Cup trophy with the International Cricket Council.“We will take up the Asia Cup trophy matter with the ICC and hopefully get our trophy back with the respect and honour it deserves,” he added.Meanwhile, to mark the women’s team’s historic feat, the BCCI has announced a Rs 51 crore cash prize for the players, coaches, and support staff. “Harmanpreet Kaur and her team haven’t just won a trophy, they’ve won the hearts of all Indians,” Saikia said, calling the triumph “a new dawn” for women’s cricket in the country.",The BCCI has yet to finalise any plans for a grand victory parade to celebrate the women's cricket team's historic ICC World Cup triumph.

Harmanpreet Kaur gets emotional after leading India to World Cup glory

India's women's cricket team captain Harmanpreet Kaur revealed how intense criticism after their loss against England brought the team closer together, leading to their first World Cup victory. Speaking at a post-match press conference in Navi Mumbai on Sunday, she emphasized how the team's unity strengthened following their challenging period of consecutive losses.The Indian team faced a difficult phase when they lost three consecutive matches against South Africa, Australia, and England. The England match was particularly devastating as India failed to chase down a target of 289 despite being well-positioned at 234 for 3.Following the England defeat, head coach Amol Mujumdar confronted the team while external critics called for leadership changes.""Not a single player said 'what will happen now' when things were not going well, especially after the heartbreaking loss against England. That night changed a lot of things for us, we thought we will have to come out with a stronger mindset and everyone came together even more,"" Harmanpreet explained.When questioned about handling harsh criticism, Harmanpreet maintained a balanced perspective. ""It is a part of our life, criticism, because it brings some balance. I don't blame those who criticise us and I don't have much to say. For me it is important to keep things balanced within the team.""The team adopted their coach's approach of creating an internal bubble and ignoring external pressures.Harmanpreet and vice-captain Smriti Mandhana were determined to avoid another disappointment after experiencing several heartbreaks in previous World Cups.""I have played a lot of World Cups with her (Mandhana). We would lose at home and we were not able to break it (jinx). When we got to know the venue was DY Patil, we started celebrating and we decided we will not leave it.

Pratika Rawal Father Interview: On daughter's hundred, the World Cup dream and more

Pratika Rawal may not have played the final stages of the Women’s World Cup 2025, but her contribution to India’s historic triumph remains unforgettable. The 25-year-old batter finished as the team’s second-highest run-scorer despite missing the knockout games, yet she did not receive a winner’s medal due to ICC rules.Rawal’s World Cup campaign came to a heartbreaking halt after she injured her ankle during India’s group-stage clash against Bangladesh. Before that setback, she had scored 308 runs in six innings at an impressive average of 51.33, including several crucial knocks that helped India reach the semifinals. However, her injury forced the team management to bring in Shafali Verma as a replacement.Also Watch:According to ICC regulations, medals are awarded only to players in the final 15-member squad. Since Rawal was replaced before the semifinal, she missed out on the winner’s medal, even though her runs were instrumental in setting up India’s title charge. Interestingly, the same situation occurred in the 2003 Men’s World Cup when Australia’s Jason Gillespie, despite taking eight wickets in four games, was replaced after an injury and did not receive a medal.On Sunday night, as India defeated South Africa by 52 runs at the DY Patil Stadium to lift their maiden Women’s ODI World Cup trophy, Rawal watched the scenes unfold from the sidelines.Sitting in her wheelchair, wrapped in the Indian flag, she could not hold back her tears.“I can’t even express it. There are no words. This flag on my shoulder means so much. To be here with my team — it’s surreal. Injuries are part of the game, but I’m just so happy I could still be part of this team. I love this team. I can’t express what I feel — we actually did it! We’re the first Indian team to win the World Cup in so long. The whole of India deserves this,” she said emotionally.For Rawal, the moment was bittersweet. She could not take the field in the final, but as Shafali Verma’s blistering 87 guided India to victory, she celebrated every boundary and wicket with the same passion as her teammates.“Honestly, it was harder to watch than to play. Every wicket, every boundary — it gave me goosebumps. The energy, the crowd, the emotion — it was incredible,” she said.Her story stands as a reminder that sometimes heroes of a championship do not always stand on the podium, but their impact is deeply felt in every cheer, every run, and every dream fulfilled.",Pratika Rawal scored 308 runs in six innings at an impressive average of 51.33.

Smriti Mandhana's IG story for her teammate

India’s maiden Women’s World Cup triumph on Sunday night was marked by joy, emotion, and moments that went beyond the scoreboard.As the celebrations carried on deep into the night at DY Patil Stadium, one gesture from vice-captain Smriti Mandhana stood out.While every player received their share of applause, Mandhana took to Instagram to appreciate a teammate who didn’t feature in a single game during the tournament — pacer Arundhati Reddy. The 28-year-old bowler, however, was an energetic presence in team huddles and in the dugout.She also featured in the celebratory posts made by Jemimah Rodrigues, especially the one that went viral and was captioned ""Are we still dreaming?""Sharing a story with a message for Reddy, Mandhana wrote, “People from the outside won’t know what you have done for this team! To not get to play a match but still show up every session with a smile and take care of everyone around! You are our Star! @arundhati.reddy.”The message reflected the close relationship within the squad that powered India to its first-ever Women’s ODI World Cup title.Reddy, though not part of the playing XI in any of the nine matches, was lauded by teammates for her spirit and support throughout the campaign.On the field, India sealed history with a commanding 52-run win over South Africa in the final. Shafali Verma and Deepti Sharma were central to the performance.Shafali struck 87 at the top, while Deepti produced an all-round display with 54 runs and a five-wicket haul.India posted 298/7, the second-highest total ever in a Women’s ODI World Cup final.In response, South Africa fought hard through Laura Wolvaardt’s century, but Deepti’s 5 for 39 and sharp fielding efforts, including a direct hit from Amanjot Kaur to run out Tazmin Brits, sealed the result.The victory ended decades of heartbreak and brought India their first ICC title in women’s cricket.Yet amid the historic celebrations, Mandhana’s words for Reddy highlighted the unseen contributions that shaped this journey, sending a reminder that every World Cup win is built not just on those who play, but also on those who lift the team from behind the scenes.",Smriti Mandhana took to Instagram to thank Arundhati Reddy for her support.

Harmanpreet Kaur gets emotional after leading India to World Cup glory

India Women's cricketers to become CROREPATIS after World Cup win!

NEW DELHI: History was scripted on the midnight of Sunday (Nov 2) as the Indian women’s cricket team lifted its maiden ICC ODI World Cup title, defeating South Africa by 52 runs at the D.Y. Patil Stadium in Navi Mumbai. It was a night that will be remembered forever — a defining moment not just for Indian cricket, but for Indian women’s sport. Skipper Harmanpreet Kaur stood at the heart of it all, and when ICC Chairman Jay Shah handed her the gleaming trophy, the stadium erupted. But it wasn’t just the triumph — it was her Lionel Messi-like celebration that captured the imagination of millions.Having taken the winning catch to dismiss Nadine de Klerk, Harmanpreet sealed India’s place in history. Her team had done what generations before could only dream of — becoming world champions for the first time. With the win, India joined an elite list of nations — Australia, England, and New Zealand — as the only teams to have lifted the Women’s ODI World Cup.However, the post-match scenes became just as iconic as the victory itself.Once the trophy was presented to Harmanpreet, she danced her way to the podium, where her jubilant teammates awaited her.The walk, the poise, and the smile were reminiscent of Lionel Messi’s iconic celebration after leading Argentina to the FIFA World Cup in December 2022.While Messi’s moment came under the lights of Lusail Stadium, Harmanpreet’s came under the glow of fireworks in Navi Mumbai.Unlike Messi’s long march with the trophy, Harmanpreet’s was short and simple — yet filled with equal emotion. She walked with pride before raising the trophy over her head as chants of “India! India!” echoed across the stands.Interestingly, fans also drew parallels between her celebration and that of Rohit Sharma , who had done a similar walk after leading India to victory in the 2024 T20 World Cup.A video has since gone viral on social media, showing Rohit’s lookalike “training” Harmanpreet to walk with the same flair ahead of the World Cup.It appears Harmanpreet took that inspiration quite literally, winning her own coveted title and celebrating in trademark Indian captain style.Her leadership throughout the tournament was both intuitive and fearless — a quality that came to the fore in the final. When Harmanpreet addressed the post-match presentation, she made sure to keep her focus on the bigger picture.Watch the video here ""This is the start. We wanted to break this barrier. And our next plan is to make this a habit. We were waiting for it, now this moment has come. So many big occasions are coming, and we want to keep improving. This is not the end, just the beginning,"" the skipper said, her voice filled with pride and purpose.Captaincy is often about instinct — and Harmanpreet showed shades of Kapil Dev’s legendary gut feeling from June 25, 1983, when he handed one more over to Madan Lal against a rampaging Vivian Richards. On this historic night, Harmanpreet’s own instinct told her to hand the ball to Shafali Verma — a move that proved decisive.""When Laura and Sune were batting, they were looking really good. I just saw Shafali standing there, and the way she was batting, I knew it was our day,” Harmanpreet recalled.""I thought I have to go with my gut feeling. My heart was saying, I had to give her at least one over. And that was the turning point for us. In the end, they panicked a little and that is where we cashed (in). At the right time, Deepti came in and took those wickets.""Shafali, who had bowled just 14 overs in her entire ODI career before this match, rose to the occasion — claiming two crucial wickets.""When she came to the team, we spoke to her that we might need 2-3 overs, and she said if you give me bowling, I will bowl ten overs. Credit goes to her, she was so positive and she was there for the team. Salute her,"" Harmanpreet said, lauding the young star’s contribution.Behind the scenes, the role of coach Amol Muzumdar and the support staff was equally significant. Harmanpreet acknowledged their constant motivation and planning.""Amol sir was with the team and he was always telling us to come up with something special, and to keep preparing for the big occasion,” she said.""We should give credit to the support staff and the BCCI. We did not make too many changes (to our squad), and they really invested in us, and because of everyone, we are standing here.""From gut calls to graceful celebrations, Harmanpreet’s leadership defined India’s golden night. And as fireworks lit up the Mumbai sky, it became clear — this was not just a victory, it was the beginning of a new era for women’s cricket in India.","Harmanpreet Kaur took the winning catch to dismiss Nadine de Klerk.

Poll Who do you think was the standout player for India in the World Cup final? Amanjot Kaur Deepti Sharma Shafali Verma Smriti Mandhana

In a final filled with defining moments, Amanjot Kaur delivered one that will be remembered for years. Her dramatic catch to dismiss South Africa captain Laura Wolvaardt turned the Women’s World Cup final decisively in India’s favour and sparked scenes of celebration across the DY Patil Stadium.The moment came in the 42nd over when Wolvaardt, batting on 101, mistimed a shot that flew towards deep mid-wicket. Amanjot juggled the ball twice before finally holding on, triggering an eruption of relief and joy both on the field and in the stands. She had earlier produced a sharp run-out to dismiss Tazmin Brits, giving India their first breakthrough.Fielding coach Munish Bali, addressing the team after the win, summed up the pride in the dressing room. “Thank you so much for making us proud. Thank you so much for giving us a chance to wear this t-shirt. Champions! Let’s go ladies,” Bali said in a video shared by the BCCI.Teammate Jemimah Rodrigues hailed Amanjot’s moment of brilliance, saying it had changed everything. “So girls, we talk about special moments… there are some moments in a game that change lives forever and that moment has changed our lives forever — and that is today, Amanjot,” she said.“You just didn’t catch that catch, you caught the World Cup.”Bali also highlighted Smriti Mandhana ’s contribution in the field, revealing that she topped the team’s leaderboard. “Smriti Mandhana is at the top with eight catches, no errors. We win on the outfield. Well done, Smriti,” he added.This prompted a light-hearted and hilarious reaction from Jemimah, who asked him whether she and teammate Radha (Yadav) were doing nothing on the pitch - ""one minute sir, kya mai aur Radha chana kha rahe the?"" she asked as her teammates burst out laughing.India’s 52-run victory was anchored by all-round excellence, owed to Deepti Sharma’s five-wicket haul (5/39) and half-century (58), Shafali Verma’s 87, and sharp fielding that kept South Africa under pressure.Despite Wolvaardt’s century, India bundled out the visitors for 246 in 45.3 overs to secure their first-ever Women’s World Cup title.","Amanjot Kaur's dramatic catch to dismiss South Africa captain Laura Wolvaardt turned the Women's World Cup final decisively in India's favour.

India Women's cricketers to become CROREPATIS after World Cup win!

‘BOWLING STILL A CONCERN’: AREAS INDIA MUST ADDRESS

‘10-FOLD GROWTH IN THE GAME’S POPULARITY’

NEW DELHI: A day after India’s historic triumph at the ICC Women’s ODI World Cup 2025, former India captain Shantha Rangaswamy has called for a leadership transition — suggesting that Harmanpreet Kaur should step down as captain for the long-term benefit of Indian cricket.Rangaswamy believes that relinquishing the captaincy would actually help the 36-year-old, who remains one of the team’s most valuable assets as both a batter and a fielder.“It’s overdue. Because Harman as a batter and a fielder is brilliant. Yes. But tactically, she can fumble at times. I feel she can contribute more if she’s without the burden of captaincy,” Rangaswamy told PTI.She said the decision should be taken keeping India’s future in mind, with the next ODI World Cup scheduled in 2029 and the T20 World Cup in the UK next year.Rangaswamy also backed Smriti Mandhana , 29, as the natural successor to lead the side across formats.“See, when it comes after a success like this (World Cup win), it will not be taken well but in the interest of Indian cricket and in Harman's own interest, I think she can contribute much more as a batter without the burden of captaincy.“She still has three-four years of big-time cricket left. Not being captain would allow her to do that.Smriti should be made captain across formats. You need to plan for future World Cups also,” she said.Drawing a parallel with the men’s team, Rangaswamy noted how the selectors moved on from Rohit Sharma after he guided India to the Champions Trophy title earlier this year, highlighting the need to think ahead rather than rest on recent glory.While celebrating India’s title-winning run at home, Rangaswamy also pointed out the team’s vulnerabilities — particularly in the bowling department.“In our days batting used to be the weaker link. Now batting has a settled look but bowling is a concern. Fielding too can be a lot better.“Australia lost only because they did not have a good bowling attack. I would say Pakistan and Bangladesh had better bowling attacks. The batters did the job for us,” she said, referring to Australia’s semifinal defeat to India after failing to defend 338.Rangaswamy predicted that India’s World Cup victory will trigger an unprecedented rise in the popularity of women’s cricket across the country.“Ten years down the line, you would see the massive impact of this win. This will inspire millions to take up the sport,” she said.She also praised outgoing chief selector Neetu David and her panel for assembling a championship-winning team that delivered when it mattered most.",Shantha Rangaswamy believes Harmanpreet Kaur should step down as captain for the long-term benefit of Indian cricket.

For Deepti Sharma , India’s maiden Women’s World Cup triumph at home was more than just a dream fulfilled. As she said after the win, it was in the team's destiny.The all-rounder, who delivered standout performances throughout the tournament and particularly in the final, said the team’s long wait for an ICC title was “written to happen in India. ” Deepti was at the heart of India’s 52-run win over South Africa in Sunday’s final at the DY Patil Stadium, taking five wickets for 39 runs after scoring a crucial 58 to help India post 298/7. Her all-round effort earned her the Player of the Tournament award, having finished with 22 wickets and 215 runs across the competition.“I am feeling really good, since the day we played the first game of the World Cup, I have performed exactly how I wanted to play as a senior player,” Deepti told PTI. “There cannot be anything better than giving such a good performance in the final and lifting the trophy.”Reflecting on the years of heartbreak before this triumph, she said, “It took us really long to win the World Cup, but what God has written for you happens only at the destined time and I think it was written to take place in India.”The off-spinning all-rounder, who became the first player across men’s and women’s cricket to score a fifty and take a five-wicket haul in a World Cup knockout, added that playing at the DY Patil Stadium carried special significance.“I have so many good memories of DY Patil Stadium as we have won all the series here. We were very positive as a team, and whatever the result might be we will play as a team,” she said.In the final, Shafali Verma top-scored with 87, while Deepti and Richa Ghosh’s late partnership pushed India close to the 300-run mark.South Africa’s Laura Wolvaardt fought hard with a century, but Deepti’s five-wicket burst sealed the deal for India.As Deepti summed it up, “We wanted to win it as this was happening in India and we had to win this as a team... and now that wait has come to an end.”",Deepti Sharma was at the heart of India's 52-run win over South Africa in Sunday's final.

Liverpool secured a 2-0 victory against Aston Villa in the Premier League , ending their four-game losing streak. Mohamed Salah achieved his 250th goal for the club, and Ryan Gravenberch added another goal to help the defending champions move up to third place in the standings.""I'm glad we are back on track now. It's a very tricky season for us because we have a few new players, they are very good players, but they need time to adapt. We lost some players too. It takes time to adapt and know each other's games, but everything will be fine,"" said Salah.Liverpool manager Arne Slot's decision to make multiple changes during Wednesday's 3-0 League Cup loss to Crystal Palace increased pressure on the returning players to secure a win after six defeats in seven games across all competitions.""What I liked most was that I think everybody here felt the importance of the game. I'm talking about my players and I'm talking about the fans. From start to finish the players showed up,"" said Slot.Liverpool faced early pressure when Morgan Rogers hit the post with a shot after five minutes. This continued their pattern of struggling in the opening 15 minutes, which had been evident in their previous four Premier League defeats.Villa initially showed strength in breaking through Liverpool's defense but later struggled with their own defensive play. Dominik Szoboszlai missed an opportunity after taking the ball from Pau Torres, shooting directly at Martinez.Hugo Ekitike's header goal was disallowed after VAR review showed he was offside from Szoboszlai's cross. Martinez's error then allowed Salah to score just before half-time, marking his 250th goal for Liverpool.Salah's goal, his fifth of the season, places him as Liverpool's third-highest scorer in club history, behind only Ian Rush and Roger Hunt. The goal also ended Liverpool's streak of conceding first in seven consecutive games.Villa entered the match having won their previous four league games, including victories over Tottenham and Manchester City. They were level on points with Liverpool before the game.Gravenberch, who had missed the previous weekend's 3-2 loss at Brentford due to an ankle injury, scored Liverpool's second goal. His shot deflected off Pau Torres, deceiving Martinez.Liverpool achieved their first clean sheet in 11 games. The team now prepares for upcoming matches against Real Madrid in the Champions League and Manchester City in the Premier League.Liverpool's recent poor form has created a significant challenge in their title defence against Arsenal. The victory reduced their gap behind Arsenal to seven points, providing a starting point for their return to the title race.Joao Pedro ended his goal drought for Chelsea by scoring the decisive goal in a 1-0 victory against Tottenham at their home stadium on Saturday.The Brazilian striker scored his first goal since August 30, when he last found the net against Fulham, breaking a nine-game goalless streak across all competitions.Since his £60 million transfer from Brighton during the transfer window, the 24-year-old has only managed to score three times for Chelsea.Chelsea moved to fourth place in the Premier League standings after securing their third win in four matches, trailing Tottenham only on goal difference.Tottenham's struggles at home continue, as they haven't secured a victory at their stadium since defeating Burnley in the season opener in August.Their poor home form in 2025 began under previous manager Ange Postecoglou and has persisted under Frank's leadership.Despite a League Cup defeat at Newcastle, Tottenham's away performances have been stronger, including a convincing 3-0 win at Everton in their last league match.Tottenham supporters are showing increasing dissatisfaction with Frank's tactical approach, which differs from the club's traditional attacking philosophy.An early setback occurred when Lucas Bergvall suffered a head injury and was replaced by Xavi Simons as a concussion substitute.Bergvall showed resistance to the medical staff's decision, pushing one of them before Frank stepped in to calm the situation.Alejandro Garnacho posed Chelsea's primary attacking threat in the first half, testing Tottenham goalkeeper Guglielmo Vicario with long-range attempts.Vicario recovered from a knee injury to make a crucial save, denying Joao Pedro after a defensive error by Pedro Porro.Joao Pedro broke the deadlock in the 34th minute, capitalising on Moises Caicedo's pressure on Simons and Van de Ven to score from close range.Frank expressed his frustration with Tottenham's defensive errors by kicking a water bottle on the sideline.Joao Pedro nearly doubled his tally, but Vicario saved his powerful shot following Malo Gusto's assist.Rodrigo Bentancur received a yellow card for a challenge on Reece James, which could have warranted a more severe punishment.Mohammed Kudus tested Chelsea goalkeeper Robert Sanchez just before halftime, but his shot was well saved.After the break, Enzo Fernandez missed a clear opportunity, heading over from James' cross from ten yards out.Tottenham's possession problems continued in the second half, leading to growing frustration among their supporters.Vicario was forced to make another save from Pedro Neto's powerful attempt, while Tottenham failed to mount a serious comeback in the closing stages.",Liverpool secured a 2-0 victory against Aston Villa in the Premier League.

Viktor Gyokeres opened the scoring with a well-timed header from Declan Rice’s corner in the first half, marking his first league goal since mid-September.Rice then doubled Arsenal’s advantage in the 35th minute, heading home from close range to give the visitors firm control at Turf Moor. Arsenal’s threat from set-pieces once again proved decisive, while their defensive record remained formidable, having conceded just three league goals in ten games this season.Arteta praised the balance in his side’s performances, saying his players had “shown maturity in difficult away games” and were “playing with a real sense of control.” The Gunners have now won nine straight games across all competitions, maintaining a consistent rhythm on both ends of the pitch.Burnley rarely threatened and remain in the bottom three, struggling to find form at home. Arsenal, meanwhile, continue to set the pace in the title race with another confident display built on discipline and precision. Manchester United were held to a 2-2 draw by Nottingham Forest in a tense contest at the City Ground, despite leading twice.Casemiro put United ahead in the first half, giving Ruben Amorim’s side hope of a fourth straight league win. However, Forest, who had not scored a league goal since September 20, produced a spirited response after the break.Morgan Gibbs-White equalised in the 48th minute with a strong header before Nicolo Savona completed a quick turnaround just two minutes later. United were forced to chase the game and eventually found a late equaliser through Amad Diallo, whose sharp volley in the 81st minute ensured the points were shared.Amorim later said his team “created enough to win” but admitted Forest “showed great character.” For Forest, manager Sean Dyche said he was “pleased with the fight shown,” though the result keeps them in the relegation zone, four points adrift of safety.United stay within reach of the top four but were left ruing missed chances in a match that tested their recent resurgence.",Manchester United were held to a 2-2 draw by Nottingham Forest.

Poll Is Liverpool's season salvageable after the recent defeats? Yes, they can turn it around No, it's too late Maybe, depends on next few games

Liverpool’s season went from bad to worse on Wednesday night as they crashed out of the League Cup following a stunning 3-0 defeat to Crystal Palace at Anfield — their sixth loss in the last seven matches across all competitions.Ismaila Sarr struck twice before halftime and Yeremy Pino added a late third, as Palace inflicted yet another humiliation on Arne Slot’s struggling side. The defeat compounds Liverpool’s growing crisis, coming just days after their 3-2 Premier League loss to Brentford, which further derailed their title defence.Slot’s decision to rest several key players — including Mohamed Salah, Virgil van Dijk, Alexander Isak and Florian Wirtz — backfired spectacularly. With one eye on crucial fixtures against Aston Villa, Real Madrid and Manchester City, the Dutchman fielded a largely second-string team featuring teenagers Kieran Morrison, Rio Ngumoha and Trey Nyoni.“It’s not Liverpool standards to lose six out of seven,” Slot admitted after the match. “But with the squad we have — maybe 15, 16 fit first-team players — this was the choice I had to make. The schedule is brutal, and next week will be even tougher.”The weakened lineup struggled to keep up with Palace’s intensity. Joe Gomez’s defensive lapse allowed Sarr to open the scoring in the 41st minute, before the Senegalese winger doubled the lead just moments before halftime from Pino’s assist. Substitute Amara Nallo’s late red card only deepened Liverpool’s woes, and Pino’s composed finish in the 88th minute sealed the emphatic win.The result means Palace have now beaten Liverpool three times in 80 days — following their Community Shield shootout win and a 2-1 Premier League victory.Liverpool’s latest defeat leaves Slot under increasing pressure as the club’s season threatens to unravel. With top players out of form, mounting injuries, and growing fan frustration, the next two weeks — featuring clashes against Villa, Madrid and City — could define the fate of his debut campaign.Meanwhile, Manchester City, Arsenal, Chelsea and Newcastle all advanced to the quarter-finals after securing wins in their respective ties.","Liverpool crashed out of the League Cup following a 3-0 defeat to Crystal Palace.

The holiday season hasn’t even begun, but Haley Cavinder seems to be running on Christmas spirit already. The influencer, known for her viral moments with twin sister Hanna, gave fans a glimpse of her festive home and her dazzling Cowboys-themed outfit — all before Thanksgiving even hits the calendar. As her fiancé, Dallas Cowboys tight end Jake Ferguson, gears up for Monday Night Football against the Arizona Cardinals, Haley’s post has everyone talking for a different reason.In her latest Instagram update, Cavinder posed in a custom pair of sparkly Cowboys jeans, proudly showing off her massive engagement ring.

But this time, fans’ attention wasn’t just on her look — it was on her background.Her home was already glowing with Christmas decorations on November 3, just two days after Halloween. For many, it’s a little early to start decking the halls, especially since Thanksgiving — a holiday deeply tied to Cowboys football tradition — is still weeks away. But Cavinder seems to have joined the growing wave of early decorators, a trend fueled by influencers and brands eager to embrace the festive aesthetic.It’s a shift that mirrors how social media reshapes traditions.

Dre’Mont Jones adds strength and versatility to Ravens’ defense



Ravens eye playoff push with renewed defensive energy



More NFL News:

The Baltimore Ravens made a decisive move to strengthen their defense by acquiring edge rusher Dre’Mont Jones from the Tennessee Titans in exchange for a conditional fifth-round pick. The deal, reported by NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport, could escalate to a fourth-rounder depending on performance conditions. Jones arrives at a time when the Ravens are showing signs of resurgence but still struggling to generate consistent quarterback pressure.Jones, 28, has been on a hot streak in recent weeks, recording 4.5 sacks and nine quarterback hits in his last four games. In total, he’s posted 26 tackles and five tackles for loss this season, proving himself as one of the league’s most disruptive pass rushers. His standout performance against the Los Angeles Chargers — featuring 1.5 sacks, four tackles, and eight quarterback pressures — turned heads across the league and likely pushed Baltimore to pull the trigger on the trade.A third-round pick by the Denver Broncos in 2019, Dre’Mont Jones has carved out a reputation as a relentless rusher capable of creating havoc from multiple positions. Over his seven-year NFL career, he’s played 99 games with 61 starts, amassing 236 tackles, 35 sacks, and 72 quarterback hits.His ability to shift between interior and edge roles makes him a perfect fit for a Ravens defense that values flexibility and creativity.Earlier in his career, Jones played primarily as an interior lineman, but he trimmed down ahead of the 2023 season to adapt to an edge-rushing role. That move paid off, as he’s become faster off the snap and more effective in collapsing pockets — exactly what the Ravens need after injuries and trades left their pass-rush unit depleted. With Odafe Oweh traded and Tavius Robinson sidelined, Baltimore has been forced to rely heavily on veterans like Kyle Van Noy and young talents such as Mike Green and David Ojabo. Jones’ arrival injects proven experience and production into that mix.The Ravens’ defense has improved in recent weeks, but their pass-rush stats tell a different story. With just 11 sacks in eight games, they rank near the bottom of the league, ahead of only Jacksonville. Jones’ presence could immediately change that dynamic.“The #Ravens are trading for #Titans edge Dre’Mont Jones, sending a conditional 5th rounder that could possibly become a fourth-rounder. More defensive help in Baltimore from a player who has had 4.5 sacks in the last four games,” Rapoport noted.As Baltimore gears up for a potential playoff run, Jones could be the missing piece to help them close out games with defensive dominance. The trade not only strengthens their pass rush but also signals that the Ravens are fully committed to chasing postseason success this season.","Dre’Mont Jones, 28, has been on a hot streak in recent weeks, recording 4.5 sacks and nine quarterback hits in his last four games.

Tucker Kraft’s breakout season cut short by torn ACL



Packers face tough road ahead without Tucker Kraft



More coverage on NFL:

It was supposed to be a day of celebration for Tucker Kraft. Instead, it turned into heartbreak. The Green Bay Packers’ rising star tight end learned on his 25th birthday that he suffered a torn ACL in Sunday’s 16-13 loss to the Carolina Panthers. The injury, confirmed through tests on Monday, will sideline him for the rest of the 2025 season, as first reported by ESPN’s Adam Schefter.The devastating moment came in the second half when Kraft took a hit to his knee while blocking. He was carted off the field, visibly in pain, and didn’t return. After the game, head coach Matt LaFleur admitted the injury didn’t “look good” and that it was “serious.” Unfortunately, LaFleur’s fears turned out to be true.Kraft had been one of the brightest sparks in Green Bay’s offense this season. Through eight games, he recorded 32 receptions for 489 yards and six touchdowns — both team highs. His combination of power and agility made him one of the NFL’s most exciting young tight ends and a consistent playmaker in clutch moments.An MRI on Monday confirmed the worst. NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport reported that Kraft’s torn ACL would end his season prematurely.The timing couldn’t have been worse, given that the former third-round pick was on pace to surpass his 2024 stats of 50 catches for 707 yards and seven touchdowns. For a team that had leaned on his reliability, losing him now is a major blow.After receiving the grim news, Kraft took to Instagram and posted a cryptic photo of himself kneeling on the field, with just an hourglass emoji as the caption. It sent a clear message — his time will come again, even if fans have to wait until 2026 to see him back in action.With Kraft out, the Packers will need others to step up. Tight end Luke Musgrave, who has just nine catches for 88 yards this season, could see his role increase. General manager Brian Gutekunst might also explore trade options before the deadline, but replacing Kraft’s unique skill set won’t be easy.A rare big-play threat at tight end and a leader in yards after the catch, Tucker Kraft had emerged as a cornerstone for Green Bay’s young offense. His injury is a painful reminder of how quickly fortunes can change in the NFL — and how much the Packers will miss their breakout star.","Tucker Kraft suffered a torn ACL in Sunday's 16-13 loss to the Carolina Panthers.

Fan backlash intensifies as safety concerns collide with perception issues



Some fans think it’s not about safety, but about avoiding another hostile crowd moment

More coverage on NFL:

Taylor Swift’s name has become part of every NFL broadcast lower-third this season, sometimes even when she’s not physically in the stadium. But her absence from the Kansas City Chiefs’ recent road matchup against the Buffalo Bills has triggered a new wave of criticism across social platforms, with some NFL fans accusing her of “selective support. ”The timing is messy too, because Swift has been extremely vocal recently about supporting Travis Kelce, while simultaneously promoting her new album Life of A Showgirl. Now, between talk of “concerns” over safety, a reported $2 million security upgrade, and lingering memories of getting booed by fans last season, the internet is suddenly treating Taylor not attending an away game like a scandal in itself.Reports claim Taylor Swift has been increasingly wary about her security posture, especially following a stalker case and what insiders describe as rising tension across America. A source told The US Sun: “She is seeing America getting tense, which is creating a feeling of unease.”The same insider emphasized she doesn’t want to be a distraction inside NFL environments: “The measures at Arrowhead Stadium are important for her. She knows she is always the center of attention and wants to avoid that if possible.”That’s a complicated spot, because the very act of not showing up is also causing conversation.When Swift was booed at multiple games last season, including the Super Bowl, the moment became football meme content. So when users on Instagram wrote comments like, “We are all tired of the show,” and “She's afraid of getting booed again,” it wasn’t shocking, this discourse has existed before.Swift isn’t obligated to attend road games. But the NFL continues to treat her presence like an event. And this weekend, the event was her absence.","Taylor Swift's absence from a recent Kansas City Chiefs road game has sparked accusations of ""selective support"" While promoting her new album and vocal about Travis Kelce, her decision not to attend has fueled criticism.

Instead of simply announcing which player the Dallas Cowboys acquired, like every normal NFL front office does, Jones went on SiriusXM and dropped a bomb that instantly sent Cowboys Nation into hysteria. He claimed Dallas did make a trade… but refused to say who the Cowboys traded for.That one sentence was enough to detonate an entire rumor war across social media. Fans, insiders and even rival fanbases are now trying to piece together which defensive difference-maker could be landing in Dallas, especially after Jones teased that the player would “immediately” be on the field and would fix “our shortcomings.”Dallas doesn’t leak often, but when Jerry Jones leaves a breadcrumb, it usually has weight. Their defense has been shredded all season, the tackling has been suspect, the secondary has been thin, and the pass rush lacks consistency.This is why names like Minkah Fitzpatrick and Bradley Chubb are immediately being floated. Fitzpatrick, a five-time Pro Bowler, was already publicly available. Chubb has also been quietly shopped. Both are high-impact plugs for Dallas’ biggest collapse area: coverage and disruption.Add in young developmental names like Joshua Williams or Riq Woolen and the Cowboys’ target board starts to feel like a real shopping cart.If the Cowboys view linebacker as the greater emergency, Logan Wilson, who already wants out of Cincinnati, fits the identity of a Jerry-style fix. He’s cheap, tough, and would instantly stabilize the middle.And then there’s the troll-king option, Trey Hendrickson. Trading for him after moving Micah Parsons would be peak Jones chaos. Either way, this isn’t a “minor depth move.”Jerry basically told everyone on live radio that this person will walk right into the starting lineup, “Immediately, we will have him on the field, and it will address some of the things that have been our shortcomings.”Fans wanted clarity.Instead, Jones gave them a guessing game before the deadline buzzer.","Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones ignited a frenzy by hinting at a significant trade acquisition without revealing the player's identity. Speculation is rampant, focusing on defensive reinforcements like Minkah Fitzpatrick or Bradley Chubb. Jones emphasized the newcomer will immediately impact the field, promising to fix existing shortcomings.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125071886,imgsize-32368,width-400,resizemode-4/125071886.jpg"

Crystal Westbrooks timeline questions resurface as fans revisit emotional clip

DJ Akademiks triggers another viral spiral with K’yanna Barbers and the alleged ‘twin pregnancy’ rumor

More coverage on NHL:

Cardi B and Stefon Diggs should be entering one of the sweetest and most joyful chapters of their relationship, instead, they’re trending for the most chaotic reason imaginable. The New England Patriots wide receiver is buzzing online for all the wrong reasons as social media sleuths attempt to unpack claims that multiple women may also be pregnant with his children at the exact same time Cardi is carrying his baby.That allegation alone has turned the gossip meters red-hot, simply because the couple only confirmed their relationship publicly in June and Cardi only announced she was expecting in September. Now, Diggs’ Instagram behaviour and resurfaced clips involving other women are fuelling a wave of messy speculation.Crystal Westbrooks’ name is back in rotation, not because she said something new, but because resurfaced footage has fans wondering if she was referring to Diggs. Online observers claim Crystal had gone quiet around the same time Diggs was reportedly spotted in Los Angeles.It’s the quiet-pieces-fit-too-neatly narratives that people online love and this one came with whispers that she “decided to terminate the pregnancy” after allegedly conceiving with him.None of the parties have confirmed anything, but the silence itself keeps the oxygen supply flowing.A post from DJ Akademiks alleging K’yanna Barbers may be expecting twins with Diggs sent the Cardi fandom into emotional whiplash. Barbers is already known for saying she was the ‘Kiki’ referenced in Drake’s hit. Now, her name is attached to pregnancy claims that Cardi fans do not want to hear, especially given Cardi’s history with infidelity in her previous marriage.Diggs has not verbally addressed it, but his quote card, “As a man you need to learn the habit of not talking too much”, is being read as a statement anyway.Cardi B is choosing silence too. And that silence, fair or not, might be the loudest part of the entire scandal.","Cardi B and NFL star Stefon Diggs are embroiled in a scandal as allegations surface of multiple simultaneous pregnancies with other women.

Resurfaced clips show Kayla Nicole was ready to be Travis Kelce’s wife as she shades Taylor Swift with Halloween performance,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/resurfaced-clips-show-kayla-nicole-was-ready-to-be-travis-kelces-wife-as-she-shades-taylor-swift-with-halloween-performance/articleshow/125056139.cms,"Kayla Nicole's Halloween performance, referencing Toni Braxton's ""He Wasn't Man Enough,"" sparked a cultural debate. This moment, juxtaposed with past declarations of wanting to be a wife, was interpreted by fans as a strategic message tied to Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift's relationship timeline. The contrast fueled online narratives about public perception and unresolved past intentions.

Viral performance clips collided with old confessions — and that contrast fueled the narrative

Public perception can shift overnight when old receipts suddenly matter again

When this moment first hit social platforms in late 2025, it was never just about a Halloween stage outfit, it quickly became a cultural flashpoint tied to the Travis Kelce timeline, the Taylor Swift fandom economy, and the post-breakup image management every high-profile ex experiences online. Kayla Nicole’s performance, paired with Toni Braxton ’s He Wasn’t Man Enough era aesthetic, was instantly interpreted as a lyrical message.And because the internet never forgets, viewers immediately started resurfacing old clips of Kayla saying she was “ready to be a wife.” The contrast between the newly resurfaced confident-shade moment and her past vulnerable declarations lit a match that social media happily poured gasoline on.Many fans saw the brazen costume moment as a subtle jab at Taylor Swift, who has been publicly inseparable with Travis Kelce since mid-2023, with the pair now engaged. The timing raised eyebrows because Swift’s album The Life of a Showgirl contains the track “Opalite,” which Swifties believe is referencing Kelce’s old dynamic with Nicole based on the lyric, “You were in it for real / She was on her phone.”Fans connected that lyric to a resurfaced moment where Kelce told Nicole to “get off your phone.” So when Kayla stepped out with a Toni Braxton reference, a song that famously communicates “I had him first” energy, it was hard for the internet not to interpret the moment as strategic.The resurfaced clips from Kayla’s past, including her saying, “I’m ready to be a wife though,” and, “I was stupid, I thought I’d be a wife after dating for five years,” complicated things further. The story wasn’t just shade. It was emotional contrast.Even months later, the “performance vs. past intention” dynamic remains the center of the conversation, because online, narratives rarely stay in the past when they still feel unresolved.Also Read: Taylor Swift’s reaction to Harry Styles dating one of her best friends as she plans her future with Travis Kelce is sparking major curiosity","Kayla Nicole's Halloween performance, referencing Toni Braxton's ""He Wasn't Man Enough,"" sparked a cultural debate.

“Ripping her hair out”: Tyreek Hill’s estranged wife claims he abused her several times over their 17-month marriage,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/ripping-her-hair-out-tyreek-hills-estranged-wife-claims-he-abused-her-several-times-over-their-17-month-marriage/articleshow/125055640.cms,"Tyreek Hill faced renewed scrutiny in September 2025 following domestic violence allegations from his estranged wife, Keeta Vaccaro. Her divorce filings detailed eight alleged violent incidents between January 2024 and mid-2025, including accusations of shoving, assault, and spitting. These explicit claims, describing a pattern of behavior, intensified public discourse surrounding athlete misconduct in the NFL.

The alleged incidents described a pattern rather than a single isolated moment

Their separation became public before anyone processed the emotional and cultural weight

When Tyreek Hill's domestic violence report surfaced in September 2025, it immediately reignited uncomfortable conversations around how domestic violence allegations involving star athletes are perceived, handled and processed in the NFL ecosystem. Hill wasn’t just another wide receiver at that point, he was the face of Miami’s offense, a weekly highlight-reel threat, and one of the most recognizable non-quarterback names in the league.So when his estranged wife, Keeta Vaccaro, alleged in new divorce-related legal filings that there were multiple incidents of violence during their marriage, the tone of the discourse changed. These weren’t vague, speculative rumors, these were dates, alleged events, and specific behaviors being documented. And the NFL spotlight doesn’t look away when filings are that explicit.Keeta Vaccaro’s filing at the time claimed there were eight separate domestic violence episodes between January 2024 and mid-2025. According to the reporting then, one described moment happened during a conversation about a postnup, when he allegedly shoved her and “ripped a necklace off her, leaving a cut and bruise.”Another incident she cited claimed he “violently attacked her, throwing her to the floor, twisting her intimate body parts, ripping her hair out and grabbing anything on her person he could get a hold of.”She also alleged that one incident happened while she was pregnant and in another, she said he spat on her.Vaccaro filed for divorce in April 2025. Police had previously been called in one separate argument at the condo after Vaccaro’s mother said she feared for her daughter’s safety. Vaccaro later told officers Hill became angry and “throws objects around.”And in one of the filings, she summarized it bluntly: Hill’s conduct was “outrageous, beyond all bounds of decency, and is regarded as atrocious and utterly intolerable in a civilized community.”That sentence is still the one that lingers, even months later, because of the magnitude of who he was at the time, and how much the public had already invested in the persona of Tyreek Hill.Also Read: Is Tyreek Hill’s season officially over?

By September 2023, Ramos was spotted at a Cowboys game wearing a jacket with Prescott’s number, fueling relationship rumors. Their bond only grew stronger, and within a year, the pair were engaged.Prescott proposed in October 2024 during a golf outing, a few months after they welcomed their first daughter, Margaret Jane “MJ” Rose, in February. The proposal featured an adorable twist — their 7-month-old wore a onesie that read, ""Hi Mommy, Daddy has a question for you!?""

Opting for simple motherhood over celebrity theatrics, she was seen enjoying a sunny walk with her newborn and dog. This peaceful, uncurated moment reflects a new era of presence and a slower rhythm, a stark contrast to her previous high-profile years.

Gisele Bündchen opted out of the Halloween performance culture and chose simple motherhood instead

This era of her life has a quieter rhythm than the Tom Brady years





When this sighting first made headlines back in early November 2025, it quietly highlighted how dramatically Gisele Bündchen’s life had shifted in just a few short years. Instead of red carpets, stadium-sized attention, or buzzy celebrity-couple Halloween theatrics, the former Victoria’s Secret star seemed far more grounded in her new routine, particularly with a newborn whose name she and partner Joaquim Valente hadn’t yet revealed.Halloween 2025 wasn’t about matching outfits or curated family portraits for social platforms; it was about a walk, sunshine, and her baby boy’s very first October 31 out in the world. And that understated moment; tank top, stroller, neighborhood sidewalks, offered more insight into this era of Gisele than any costume ever could.Backgrid photos circulated on Instagram, showing Gisele Bündchen in a cropped white tank, low-slung sweats, sunglasses, and Miami-casual confidence walking beside a black stroller. Her German Shepherd, Alfie, trotted along, a reminder that her circle this year wasn’t a Hollywood set, but a Florida block. The baby, born in February 2025, remained off-camera and unnamed publicly, yet his presence was the entire point. There was a softness to the visual: no stylists, no camera crews, no “content moment.”While she didn’t share fresh Halloween images of her older kids Benjamin and Vivian, her previous Mother’s Day mini-essay still captured her emotional state: “I’ve been quiet over here but very busy living life..Sometimes,the most beautiful moments aren’t shared — they’re simply lived.”Her romance with Valente, which began after her divorce from Tom Brady in 2022 and developed publicly in 2023, grew in a way that felt slower and more lifestyle-based than headline-driven. Gisele was leaning into presence, not performance. And Halloween 2025 quiet, stroller, sunlight, was simply another real-world snapshot of that truth.Also Read: Gisele Bündchen’s post divorce evolution raises question: did Tom Brady underestimate what letting her go would cost him?","Gisele Bündchen's life has taken a quieter turn, evident in her understated Halloween 2025.

“Made him a very rich”: Joe Alwyn still benefits financially from Taylor Swift while she builds a new chapter with Travis Kelce,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/made-him-a-very-rich-joe-alwyn-still-benefits-financially-from-taylor-swift-while-she-builds-a-new-chapter-with-travis-kelce/articleshow/125055176.cms,"Joe Alwyn continues to earn significantly from his songwriting contributions to Taylor Swift's past albums, even a year after their split. Royalties from hits on 'Folklore,' 'Evermore,' and 'Midnights' have reportedly made him millions, a fact that allegedly left Swift furious. This financial windfall from their shared musical past highlights how creative partnerships can yield lasting benefits.

The royalties alone positioned Joe for financial comfort long after the breakup

Taylor Swift meanwhile, was reportedly furious that her ex was still profiting





Back when it was first reported in early 2024, Joe Alwyn had technically been out of Taylor Swift ’s life for nearly a year, but financially, he wasn’t hurting in the slightest. While the breakup narrative had already shifted toward Taylor’s new relationship with Travis Kelce, the business side of her past love story with Joe remained surprisingly lucrative.During their six-year relationship, Alwyn wasn’t just a quiet partner in the background, he quietly helped write multiple songs that became globally streamed staples in Swift’s catalog. And because songwriting royalties don’t expire when a romance ends, the checks keep on coming. That meant that even post-split, the actor still had a direct pipeline of earnings tied to Taylor’s most successful era.Industry insiders had pointed out at the time that Alwyn’s involvement in Folklore, Evermore and Midnights transformed him from “supportive boyfriend” into a Grammy-winning contributor. A Life & Style insider even claimed at the time, “Fair or not, it’s made him a very rich guy.”According to their analysis back then, Joe had already made roughly $2.3 million just from Spotify streams alone, before factoring in Apple Music, publishing splits, licensing placements, or performance revenue tied to The Eras Tour. Another source said, “Joe is making so much on royalties and returns from [Taylor’s] Eras tour that he doesn’t ever need to worry about money again.”That was where it got messy. The same report noted that Taylor wasn’t thrilled that her former partner was still cashing in. One insider claimed she was “furious” that he continued to profit from music she emotionally labored over and hinted her album rollout The Tortured Poets Department might include verbal daggers aimed directly in his direction.At that time, fans were already dissecting titles like “So Long, London” and “The Smallest Man Who Ever Lived” for hidden Joe references. And as history now reflects, even when love ends, publishing deals don’t.Also Read: Taylor Swift’s reaction to Harry Styles dating one of her best friends as she plans her future with Travis Kelce is sparking major curiosity","Joe Alwyn continues to earn significantly from his songwriting contributions to Taylor Swift's past albums.

KOCHI: The war of words between the Kerala Cricket Association (KCA) and former Indian pacer S Sreesanth is showing no signs of abating.On Friday, two days after the KCA issued a show cause notice to Sreesanth, they offered a clarification in which they dragged the infamous spot-fixing scandal allegations against the speedster into the issue, which only added fuel to the fire.In its statement, the KCA clarified that the show cause notice was issued to seek an explanation on the false and defamatory statements Sreesanth made against the KCA and not for backing Sanju Samson “The KCA has always protected its players. In fact, the officials of the association visited Sreesanth when he was in jail facing allegations in the spot-fixing scandal in 2013 and offered him support. Though the court quashed the criminal case against him, he was not acquitted in the match-fixing case. So Sreesanth doesn’t need to take up the protection of players,” read the KCA statement.The KCA also mentioned that it wouldn’t tolerate indiscipline and would take strict action against those who spread falsehoods about the state cricket body.Responding to this, Sreesanth said he will continue to support Kerala players. “We need players who dream of playing for the country. I cannot stand with those who try to undermine it. I have faith in law, justice, and fate. I am concerned about those who turn away from the real issues affecting Kerala cricket. Those who released a defamatory press statement against me will have to answer soon,” Sreesanth said.",The Kerala Cricket Association (KCA) and former Indian pacer S Sreesanth are locked in a war of words. The KCA issued a show cause notice to Sreesath two days ago. The association has now dragged the infamous spot-fixing scandal allegations against the speedster into the issue.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118048416,imgsize-43226,width-400,resizemode-4/118048416.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Carlos Alcaraz , the Spanish tennis sensation, continued his impressive run at the Rotterdam Open on Friday, securing a spot in the semi-finals with a commanding 6-2, 6-1 victory over his compatriot Pedro Martinez .The world number three, aiming to become the first Spaniard to triumph in Rotterdam, will next face Hubert Hurkacz of Poland in a bid to reach Sunday's final.Alcaraz's performance was nothing short of remarkable, as he maintained a high level of play throughout the match, without any significant dips in form.Despite the challenge of facing a fellow Spaniard, Alcaraz remained focused from the outset, breaking Martinez's serve in the opening game and never looking back.The gulf in class between the two players was evident, with Alcaraz showcasing his superiority through a combination of powerful groundstrokes and precise serving.He wrapped up the first set with an ace and carried the momentum into the second, capitalizing on Martinez's unforced errors to secure another early break.Alcaraz's relentless pursuit of victory was highlighted by a remarkable rally that showcased both players' athleticism and determination.Ultimately, the young Spaniard sealed the match with a whipped crosscourt forehand, his 29th winner, in just over an hour.In the other quarter-final match, Stefanos Tsitsipas , the world number 12, fell victim to an extraordinary run by Italian qualifier Mattia Bellucci , who secured a 6-4, 6-2 upset victory.Bellucci's left-handed serve and combination of flat backhands and heavy topspin forehands, coupled with well-disguised drop shots, proved too much for Tsitsipas to handle.With his sights set on the trophy, Alcaraz remains confident in his ability to continue improving with each match, setting the stage for an enthralling semi-final clash against Hurkacz.","Carlos Alcaraz beat compatriot Pedro Martinez 6-2, 6-1 in Rotterdam Open quarter-final.

NEW DELHI: Manchester United 's FA Cup defence remained alive as they staged a remarkable comeback to defeat Leicester City 2-1 on Friday night at Old Trafford.The match witnessed a fairytale return for former United striker Ruud van Nistelrooy , who was in the opposition dugout as Leicester's interim manager.The first half was a frustrating affair for the home side, as they struggled to create meaningful chances.Leicester took the lead in the 42nd minute through Bobby De Cordova-Reid, who nodded home from close range after Wilfred Ndidi 's initial effort was saved by Andre Onana.United's manager, Ruben Amorim , recognised the need for a change and introduced Alejandro Garnacho at halftime, a move that proved to be a game-changer. The young Argentine winger injected pace and directness into United's attack, causing problems for the Leicester defence.The equaliser arrived midway through the second half when fellow substitute Joshua Zirkzee tapped in from close range after Rasmus Hojlund's flick from Garnacho's cross was blocked.With the momentum firmly in their favour, United pushed for a winner, and it came deep into stoppage time. Harry Maguire rose highest to head home a Bruno Fernandes free-kick, sparking wild celebrations at Old Trafford.While the goal appeared to be offside, the lack of VAR in the FA Cup meant the decision stood, and United secured a hard-fought victory.The match held added significance for Ruud van Nistelrooy, who had enjoyed a brief spell as United's interim manager earlier in the season following the sacking of Erik ten Hag.During his tenure, United had scored eight goals in two games against Leicester, but this time, the Dutchman was on the receiving end of a United comeback.For United, the win provided a much-needed boost after a recent run of poor form at home, where they had suffered five defeats in their previous seven matches across all competitions.The absence of key players like Lisandro Martinez, who sustained a cruciate ligament injury against Crystal Palace, and the January departures of Marcus Rashford and Antony, had left United light in attacking options.However, the introduction of Garnacho and Zirkzee's impact highlighted the depth in United's squad.As the FA Cup defence continues, United will take confidence from their ability to grind out a result against a determined Leicester side. The comeback victory not only kept their hopes of silverware alive but also provided a timely reminder of the resilience and fighting spirit that has been a hallmark of successful United teams throughout their illustrious history.","Manchester United staged a remarkable comeback to defeat Leicester City 2-1 on Friday night at Old Trafford.

'Peaking at the right time': Tony de Zorzi as Sunrisers storm into third consecutive SA20 final

NEW DELHI: South African cricket legend and league ambassador Allan Donald believes MI Cape Town are the favourites to lift the SA20 trophy but warns that two-time defending champions Sunrisers Eastern Cape have peaked at the perfect time to challenge them in Saturday’s final at the Wanderers Stadium in Johannesburg.""You'd have to say going on pure and utter form that MI Cape Town would probably pip as the favourites to take the trophy,"" Donald said in reply to the query fromduring an online interaction. ""But, but and this is a big but, the boys from the Eastern Cape, they have just come charging at the very, very right time. They just look like a team now that has just found utter belief. It's got the making of an unbelievable final.""Sunrisers Eastern Cape stormed into their third successive SA20 final with a commanding eight-wicket victory over Paarl Royals . Having already won two consecutive titles, they are now eyeing an unprecedented hat-trick. Despite MI Cape Town’s dominant run, Donald believes Sunrisers' experience in high-pressure situations makes them a formidable opponent.""You know, you can almost see it. It's going to go down to the bare minimum,"" he said. ""The absolute clinical manner that MI Cape Town have gone about their cricket is just... you'd have to say they deserve to be up there as finalists and maybe they are favourites to win it. But yeah, I think the boys in orange [Sunrisers] will have something else to say.""Donald credited Sunrisers coach Adrian Birrell for his ability to prepare the team mentally for big games. ""I don't think Sunrisers fear it [playing MI Cape Town in the final] at all. They've played in two finals before, had difficult moments, and dealt with them. Adrian Birrell is a bit of a mentalist - he works very, very cleverly with the mind. He knows there's so much skill in that change room, and it's just a matter of fine-tuning it and keeping people calm.""He added that MI Cape Town will feel the pressure of being labeled favourites. ""The only thing that can stop Sunrisers is a dodgy wicket, which I don't think will be the case. I think Wanderers will be a great pitch - pace and bounce. As much as I've said that MI Cape Town are the favourites, the pressure will be all on them because this team in orange will not see it that way. They will come out swinging. The last two wins for them have been so clinical, and they finished those teams in every aspect of T20 pressures. They stood up top. So I just think they're a machine that's going to be hard to stop. I think the boys in blue [MI Cape Town] will have to play out of their boots.""Donald also highlighted standout young South African players from the tournament, naming Rubin Hermann, Lhuan-dre Pretorius, and Jordan Hermann as promising talents. ""Rubin Hermann has done superbly for Paarl Royals, and his brother Jordan flourished when elevated in the batting order. Bjorn Fortuin , the left-arm spinner, has been an unsung hero for Paarl Royals, delivering crucial performances in tough overs.""With both teams in prime form, the SA20 final promises an intense battle between MI Cape Town’s consistency and Sunrisers Eastern Cape’s championship pedigree.",South African cricket legend Allan Donald believes MI Cape Town are the favourites to lift the SA20 trophy.

NEW DELHI: FIFA has suspended the Pakistan Football Federation (PFF) after it failed to implement constitutional amendments deemed essential by the global governing body for the fair and efficient administration of the sport in the country. FIFA stated that the suspension would remain in place until the PFF Congress adopts the required amendments.Pakistan football has been under the control of a FIFA-appointed Normalisation Committee since June 2019. The committee was tasked with conducting elections and resolving internal conflicts within the federation, but it has struggled to fulfill its mandate.Despite multiple changes in leadership over the past five years, the fundamental issues within Pakistan's football structure persist. The Normalisation Committee has also been at odds with the state-run Pakistan Sports Board, further delaying the constitutional amendments.Earlier this week, PFF Normalisation Committee chairman Haroon Malik cautioned a parliamentary panel that his tenure would end on February 15 and that Pakistan risked suspension if the amendments were not implemented. He clarified that making these amendments did not mean he would be a candidate in the upcoming PFF elections.Malik also revealed that the PFF Congress was unwilling to comply with FIFA’s directives, resulting in the ongoing standoff.This marks the third time Pakistan's football federation has been suspended since 2017.",FIFA has suspended the Pakistan Football Federation.

Thombare-Hartono back in doubles final

MUMBAI: Maaya Rajeshwaran Revathi came into the L&T Mumbai Open unranked. Check the live WTA rankings now and you will see the promising 15-year-old’s name in 645th spot after she marched into the semifinals of the WTA 125K tournament at the Cricket Club of India here on Friday.Taking on the 285th-ranked Japanese qualifier Mei Yamaguchi in the quarterfinals, Maaya, not for the first time this week, showed why she is regarded as one of India’s bright, young tennis hopes, as she overcame a second-set wobble to win 6-4, 3-6, 6-2 in just under two hours.To put her victory in context, she is the first Indian female to get this far in a WTA tournament at home in singles since Sania Mirza won a Tour event in her home city of Hyderabad in 2005 — over four years before Maaya was born. And to think that she hadn’t actually planned to play in Mumbai to begin with!Having received a wild card to the qualifiers here, Maaya, who recently joined the Rafa Nadal Academy in Mallorca, hasn’t looked back. From earning six ranking points by virtue of winning her two qualifying matches, the Coimbatore teenager has gone on to amass an additional 49 points as a result of her now reaching the semifinals.“It means a lot,” she said, reserving a word of thanks for tournament director Sunder Iyer. “MSLTA and Sunder sir, they gave me this opportunity. I’m really grateful for that, and it all started from there. As I said, wasn’t part of the plan, but they trusted me and gave me an opportunity, and here it is now.”Indeed. Though when she double-faulted to hand Yamaguchi the second set in a game where she was 40-15 up, the outcome of the match was very much in the balance. But Maaya felt she was prepared after coming through both qualifying matches in three sets.“It’s the third third-set victory this week, and all three of them, I took the first and lost the second. So this is not something new for me,” she said, confidently stating that she didn’t feel the need to recalibrate. “The moment I lost the second set, I knew I had to go all out in the third. And whenever I do that, if I get my legs going, I’ll be winning the third set.”While the 25-year-old Japanese began the match stronger of the two, she would suddenly lose rhythm on her serve, allowing Maaya to claw her way back from a 1-3 deficit and clinch the opening set.The second set saw Yamaguchi, playing with a tightly-strapped right thigh, rediscover the sting in her forehand as well as raise her first serve percentage which helped her put pressure on the young Indian. Just as Maaya had done in the opening set, Yamaguchi would break the Indian’s serve for three consecutive games to even the match.But her challenge fizzled in the deciding set, as an exquisite crosscourt backhand winner followed by a crushing forehand return gave Maaya the double break.On Saturday, the fifth seed Jil Teichmann of Switzerland awaits the teenager in the semifinals. Teichmann had extinguished any hope of seeing an all-Indian last four battle when she outclassed Shrivalli Bhamidipaty 6-2, 6-2 earlier in the day.“It’s a very tough match, but it should be the toughest match of the week for me. And she’s a lefty too. I just hope to compete well, no pressure on me,” said Maaya.India’s top-ranked woman doubles player Prarthana Thombare and Dutch partner Arianne Hartono earned themselves another crack at the title here, as they fought back to beat the British-Russian pairing of Eden Silva and Anastasia Tikhonova 2-6, 6-4, 10-2 in the semifinal on Friday. Thombare and Hartono finished runners-up last year, losing to Dalila Jakupovic and Sabrina Santamaria in the final.","Maaya Rajeshwaran Revathi beats Japanese qualifier Mei Yamaguchi 6-4, 3-6, 6-2.

Today I think I played even better, technically speaking, against a great opponent but I was in a mindset to fight for every point,"" said the Italian.Bellucci, ranked 92nd globally, had previously showcased his abilities by eliminating second seed Daniil Medvedev in the earlier round.The Italian demonstrated strong defensive skills in the first set, catching Tsitsipas off guard with well-executed drop shots.After breaking Tsitsipas at 4-4, Bellucci successfully served out the set, saving a break point before securing it when his opponent hit a backhand long.The sixth-seeded Greek's difficulties persisted in the second set, with Bellucci breaking serve and establishing a 3-1 lead through skillful drop shots.Tsitsipas contributed to his own defeat by double-faulting on break point, giving up a second break of serve.He managed to save a match point at 5-1, similar to his previous match against Tallon Griekspoor, but couldn't complete another comeback.Bellucci closed out the match confidently, serving to love and earning appreciation from the crowd.His semi-final opponent will be Australia's Alex de Minaur, last year's finalist, who defeated German lucky loser Daniel Altmaier 6-1, 6-4.The tournament's other matches feature world number three Carlos Alcaraz facing fellow Spaniard Pedro Martinez, while Russia's Andrey Rublev competes against Poland's Hubert Hurkacz.","Mattia Bellucci defeats Stefanos Tsitsipas 6-4, 6-2 to reach Rotterdam Open semi-finals.

MUMBAI: It didn't seem like Maaya Rajeshwaran Revathi had done much wrong. She had just completed a 6-4, 6-1 over Belarusian Iryna Shymanovich, finishing the match exactly how she had started it, with an ace. It was not just her first round match of the L&T Mumbai Open , this was her WTA main draw debut, and for most part, the 15-year-old looked to have ticked a lot of the right boxes judging by the applause she drew from the Cricket Club of India crowd here on Tuesday.And yet, the promising teenager wasn't totally pleased with her performance while reflecting on it later. “Well, one thing is that I think I played my qualifying rounds better than today. So one thing that I'm happy about is that I managed to win even though I didn't play my best today,” Maaya would say.Winning despite not being at your best! That's a trait that the man whose famous academy Maaya currently trains at often fell back on over the course of his storied career. For now, she is still in the early days of her one-year stint at the Rafa Nadal Academy in Mallorca, and apart from saying “it's going good” and mentioning a “small conversation” she had with Toni, Rafa's uncle and long-time coach, there's not much else Maaya can share just yet.Her racket, however, did the talking against the 225th-ranked Shymanovich, who, Maaya happened to learn would be her opponent “just five minutes” before she was to step on court.As she and Shymanovich were hitting to each other in the warm-up, a livescoring app still showed Yuriko Miyazaki of Great Britain as Maaya's opponent. Miyazaki was forced to withdraw due to illness.Did the late twist throw Maaya off in any way? “Nah, because either way, I didn't know anything about my previous opponent. The same applies to this (player),” the Coimbatore girl grinned.There was notable support for Maaya in the crowd as Grand Slam doubles champion Rohan Bopanna followed the youngster's progress over the first set. “I'm really honoured to have him here because I think he flew down to watch this match and I'm really happy that he was here,” she said.Tuesday's win coupled with her two victories in the qualifiers have earned Maaya 21 WTA ranking points, taking her total points tally to 24 and earning her an entry into the WTA rankings.She will take on Zarina Diyas in the second round, after the Kazakh eliminated defending champion Darja Semenistaja 6-3, 6-3.Meanwhile, Ankita Raina and Shrivalli Bhamidipaty were the other Indian players to advance to the last 16 stage on Tuesday. Raina proved too strong for compatriot Vaishnavi Adkar, coming through 6-2, 6-2, while Bhamidipaty produced a devastating display to take out the 182nd-ranked Elena Pridankina of Russia 6-1, 6-0 in just 64 minutes.","Maaya Rajeshwaran Revathi beat Belarusian Iryna Shymanovich 6-4, 6-1.

Indian tennis star Sumit Nagal reaches pre-quarterfinals at Rosario Challenger,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/indian-tennis-star-sumit-nagal-reaches-pre-quarterfinals-at-rosario-challenger/articleshow/117908818.cms,"(@nagalsumit Photo on X)

NEW DELHI: Indian tennis player Sumit Nagal secured his place in the pre-quarterfinals following a resilient victory against Argentina's Renzo Olivo in a notable advancement at the 2025 Rosario Challenger .The match concluded with scores of 5-7, 6-1, 6-0 in favour of Nagal, who is the eighth seed in the tournament. This victory marks a significant achievement for the 27-year-old Indian, displaying his ability to recover and dominate after an initial setback.Nagal's next opponent will be determined by the outcome of the match between Tseng Chun-hsin from Chinese Taipei and Bolivia's Hugo Dellien .This triumph comes at a crucial time for Nagal, who recently experienced a decline in his professional standing.Prior to this event, he had fallen out of the ATP top-100 rankings, a position he had maintained for 10 consecutive months since March 2024.This drop was attributed to a series of disappointing performances, with Nagal securing only three main draw victories in 18 tournaments since Wimbledon 2024.Despite this, his earlier entry into the top-100 in February 2024, following a commendable performance at a Grand Slam event, underscores his potential and skill on the international stage.In related developments within Indian tennis, veteran doubles player Rohan Bopanna , aged 44, has also experienced a setback, falling five places to No. 21 in the rankings.This decline followed an early exit from the Australian Open, where he was unable to defend the points from his previous championship win.Bopanna's attempt to retain his standing, alongside new partner Nicolas Barrientos, ended prematurely in the opening round of the competition.Other Indian players, including Sasikumar Mukund, Ramkumar Ramanathan, Karan Singh, and Aryan Shah, maintain their positions within the top-600 in singles rankings.In doubles, alongside Bopanna, players such as Yuki Bhambri, N Sriram Balaji, Rithvik Choudary Bollipalli, and Arjun Kadhe are within the top-100.","Indian tennis player Sumit Nagal secured his place in the pre-quarterfinals following a resilient victory against Argentina's Renzo Olivo.

Anand Amritraj slams Indian stars for skipping Davis Cup,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/anand-amritraj-slams-indian-stars-for-skipping-davis-cup/articleshow/117900335.cms,"MUMBAI: Former India Davis Cup captain Anand Amritaj has ripped into the country's top-ranked players who have recently turned down the chance to represent the nation in the prestigious team competition.India's expected demolition of minnows Togo in New Delhi on Sunday came without top singles player Sumit Nagal and Yuki Bhambri , the second ranked doubles player in the country.Nagal's case particularly garnered attention after the All India Tennis Association (Aita) had recently claimed that the 27-year-old had demanded an annual fee of $50,000 to play Davis Cup ties for India. The player defended his stand in a lengthy post on social media, saying ""it is standard practice in professional sports for athletes to be compensated for their participation in events, even when representing their country"".Amritraj , who worked with Nagal when he held the role of captain a few years ago, described the idea as ""inconceivable"".""To me personally, it is just inconceivable that if you are ranked high enough and the country wants you to play, that you would play without any financial compensation,"" Amritraj told reporters here on the sidelines of the L&T Mumbai Open at the Cricket Club of India on Monday.""Unless you are injured and you can't walk on the court, other than that, there should be no question that you're going to play Davis Cup. Same for me, same for Vijay,"" he added, referring to his brother with whom he helped India reach the 1974 Davis Cup finals against South Africa.""Both of us felt that it is the greatest honour that you can have to play for your country. Maybe this is old-school thinking, but that is absolutely how it should be.""You got 50 weeks in the year to make money, two weeks of the year, you should be able to give to places you grew up in, and it should be an honour and a privilege.""On Nagal's case, the 73-yearold said: ""I like Sumit, when I was captain he was the reserve on my team five years ago. I got along very well with him, but he didn't play the last tie (vs Sweden in Sept) either, which is really a shame because he is our best player right now.""Asked if there should be strong repercussions for players who choose to not turn up for national team duties, Amritraj said it was a tricky situation as players could always lean on the ""independence of the ATP Tour "" to make their decisions.With some Indian players, however, enjoying government funding through programmes like the Target Olympic Podium Scheme (TOPS), it could be a way for Aita to crack the whip, Amritraj felt.""That's where you should put the screws on them. I think you should definitely do that. If you're in any kind of place with some leverage, you should say: 'Either you play Davis Cup, or you won't get this'. Simple.""","Top-ranked players Sumit Nagal and Yuki Bhambri turned down chance to represent India.

"Handed wildcards, Indians have a point to prove",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/handed-wildcards-indians-have-a-point-to-prove/articleshow/117891061.cms,"Ramkumar Ramanathan

CHENNAI: Indian tennis is not going through the best of times. While its top-ranked singles player Sumit Nagal has made good strides in recent years, the rest of the crop has struggled in the journey to the top.The player distribution in the Chennai Open Challenger best explains the current scenario. Even in a home tournament, India, in the absence of Nagal, is forced to rely on wildcards for main-draw singles entries as the next-best players from the country find it difficult to directly make the cut. Davis Cuppers Mukund Sasikumar (ranked 365), Ramkumar Ramanathan (406) and Karan Singh will have a point to prove after being awarded wildcards by the organisers.The onus will be on the experienced Ramkumar and Mukund to gain valuable points to move up in the rankings chart. The 28-year-old Mukund had a good run in Chennai last year, reaching the quarterfinals, but could not carry forward the momentum in the tournaments that followed. Ramkumar’s story in the past few years has not been much different, with the 30-year-old’s inconsistency hampering his chances to move to a higher level. Youngster Karan has shown promise in the early stages of his career and is steadily rising up the ladder.Moving to foreign interest, quite a few players are looking to resurrect their careers and compete in the Grand Slams. For instance, Lloyd Harris, who is the second seed in singles, was once ranked as high as 31 and reached the quarterfinals of the US Open in 2021. Injury issues forced the South African to stay away from action for quite a long period and the 27-year-old will compete in his first match since the Wimbledon last year.Former world No. 35 Jiri Vesely had to sit out in 2023 due to injury concerns. The 31-year-old had won the ATP 250 title in Pune in 2020 and had a good time in India in the past. Ahead of the Chennai Open, Vesely said: “Preparations have been good and I am getting used to the weather, but it is not easy. It is always nice to be in India and people are very friendly and supportive. I love coming back here and I hope to have a good run on this trip.”Vesely dropped outside the top-600 a few years ago and since then, he has found it tough to be back to his best. “I wish to move up and it is not easy. A lot of youngsters are playing well and I need to compete with them and give my best.”","India's top-ranked singles player Sumit Nagal has made good strides in recent years.

CHENNAI: Italian tennis player Jacopo Berrettini does not have to look far for inspiration. The 26-year-old shares a strong bond with his elder brother Matteo Berrettini , a former top-10 singles player and 2021 Wimbledon finalist, whom he regards not only his best friend but also his idol.“I have a good relationship with him. He is a very good human, and I am so glad and lucky to have him. Apart from on-court training, he mentors me off the field and is a good coach. We shared the same (coaching) team for the past three years and now share the same trainer. Before coming here, we trained together for three days in Rome,” Jacopo, who will begin his season at the Chennai Open Challenger , told TOI on Saturday.Jacopo and Matteo had a tough 2023 as their seasons were marred by injuries. Matteo had to take a six-month break, while Jacopo had to miss the majority of the year. In that period, the Berrettini brothers helped each other stay mentally strong. “It was a very tough period for us, for our family. We were trying to be the humans that we are, trying to stay mentally focused and healthy. We had to work a lot after recovery because this sport is so tough mentally and physically. We were trying to enjoy life outside the sport as it is very important as well. After suffering from a lot of injuries, Matteo had a good season last year,” Jacopo added.While Jacopo and Matteo do not spend much time together due to their playing commitments, they are always in touch. “We try to talk often and as much as we can. Sometimes, we train together, but if we are not able to spend a lot of time, it is okay since we travel and play regularly. We are healthy and that is a good thing for us.”‘Aim to carry forward momentum’: Jacopo had a productive season last year and achieved his career-best singles ranking of 317. The Italian will look to carry forward the momentum, starting with his season opener in Chennai. “It was a good year (2024) for me, playing many matches without any injury concerns. I worked on many aspects and will try to keep going. My goal for this year is to compete in the qualifiers of the Grand Slams, for which I have to get close to the 230 mark (rankings).”",Italian tennis player Jacopo Berrettini shares a strong bond with his elder brother Matteo.

The hosts, who had taken a commanding 2-0 lead by winning the first two singles on the opening day of the tie on Saturday, completed the formality with two dominant wins - in doubles and singles - on Sunday. The fifth rubber was not played. The World Group 1 tie would be played in September later this year and the name of their opponents would be announced later.The doubles pair of Sriram Balaji and Davis Cup debutant Rithvik Bollipalli put the hosts ahead in the fourth game when they broke M'lapa Akomlo, the substitute for regular player Thomas Setodji who pulled out with an injury. Akomlo proved to be the weak link as the Indians, playing some smart tennis with clever ball placement and strong net presence, broke his service to take the set 6-2. The second set was even shorter as the Indians broke Akomlo and his partner Isak Padio once each to claim the set 6-1. The match lasted 57 minutes.With the tie secured, India gave rookie Karan Singh his Davis Cup debut in the dead rubber and the 21-year-old did not disappoint as he beat Isak, whom Togo fielded in place of original choice Setodji. The 20-year-old in fact put up the best show by a Togolese player on the trip as he stretched most of the games. He even managed to break Singh once in the second set as India won the match 6-2, 6-3 - the first instance when Togo won three games in a set on this tour.""I started playing tennis when I was an 11-year-old and I had no idea how far I would go. I just kept going day by day. And here we are today. And I really enjoyed playing the match today.

The captain's chairs are placed next to the chair umpire so that the players could consult with the captains during game breaks. ""I always do that. Sometimes it's as important as grooming players. Sitting on that chair has a different kind of pressure you need that experience. It's good for them. They'll be the future captains.

Elise Mertens secured her first WTA title in 17 months on Sunday, defeating unseeded Ann Li in straight sets to claim the Singapore Tennis Open.The second-seeded Belgian, who had fallen to McCartney Kessler in the Hobart International final last month, showcased her dominance at the Kallang Tennis Centre , winning 75 percent of her first-serve points to overpower the American 6-1, 6-4.Li had not dropped a set en route to the final but struggled with her serve early on, allowing Mertens to capitalize with three service breaks to wrap up the opening set in just 26 minutes.The American was broken again at the start of the second set but responded by breaking Mertens for the first time in the following game, settling into a better rhythm on serve.However, serving to stay in the match at 4-5, Li committed a pair of unforced errors, handing Mertens the victory after one hour and 22 minutes. The win marked Mertens' ninth career WTA singles title and her first since triumphing at the Monastir Open in Tunisia in October 2023.In the doubles final, second seeds Desirae Krawczyk of the United States and Giuliana Olmos of Mexico clinched the title with a commanding 7-5, 6-0 victory over the third-seeded Chinese duo of Wang Xinyu and Zheng Saisai.","Elise Mertens defeated Ann Li 6-1, 6-4 to win the Singapore Tennis Open.

NEW DELHI: Two-time Olympic medallist and one of India’s most celebrated badminton players, PV Sindhu has embarked on a new chapter in her career by teaming up with renowned Indonesian coach Irwansyah Adi Pratama .This partnership comes at a crucial time as Sindhu aims to regain her competitive edge and reclaim her status among the elite in women’s badminton.Previously, Sindhu has been coached by Pullela Gopichand , South Koreans Kim Ji-Hyun and Park Tae Sang, and Malaysia’s Muhammad Hafiz Hashim. Irwansyah, known for his success with Indonesian stars Jonatan Christie and Anthony Ginting, has been tasked with revitalizing Sindhu’s game.It has been a tough two years for Sindhu. After winning the 2022 Commonwealth Games title, she experienced a lull and didn’t win any tournament till her Syed Modi Super 300 crown in December last year.“Every player has been through something like this. What I’ve learned, I want to pass on to her. I’ll try my best. I believe she can still do it. She can come back and reach an even higher level than before. I do believe in it. That’s the reason I’m here,” Irwansyah said.“I want to help her enjoy herself more on the court. It’s important that she enjoys it because when she enjoys it, she’ll become more confident. That’s the main focus right now – working hard to get her to believe in herself again. After everything, the last two years have been tough -- injuries, maybe... It’s really about confidence. I’m doing my best to help her believe in what she has. She has a lot of potential,” the coach added.Irwansyah’s approach focuses on enhancing Sindhu’s natural aggressive playing style. “My plan is to make her a more attacking player. She has all the right qualities, so I just want to build on that and push her further. I want to change her game to be more aggressive -- more speed and power,” Irwansyah said.As Sindhu begins this new journey, she expresses a renewed sense of purpose and determination. “The bonding is important between coach and athlete. I’ve heard a lot about him, and I thought he is the right coach for me. The way he approaches opponents, I think it’s really good,” Sindhu said.At the India Open , Sindhu lost in the quarterfinals to Indonesia’s Gregoria Mariska Tungjung. Despite the loss, Sindhu gave a good account of herself, giving glimpses of her old self.“I need to maintain my speed. I need to have my power. The women’s singles game is evolving, and after playing for so many years, I think opponents definitely know my game by now. So, it’s crucial to strategize, having both Plan A and Plan B,” said Sindhu. “I still feel there’s so much more to achieve. I have that fire in me, and I know I can do it. It’s just a matter of time and rhythm.”","Two-time Olympic medallist PV Sindhu has teamed up with renowned Indonesian coach Irwansyah Adi Pratama.

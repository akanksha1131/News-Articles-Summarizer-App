IPL | Punjab Kings' Suryansh Shedge: From playing under Shreyas to dreaming of meeting Kohli

Rajasthan Royals' stand-in captain Riyan Parag has been fined Rs 12 lakhs by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) for maintaining a slow over-rate during their match against Chennai Super Kings at Barsapara Stadium on Sunday. The fine came after Rajasthan secured their first win of IPL 2025 in three attempts, following losses to Sunrisers Hyderabad and Kolkata Knight Riders.The penalty was imposed under Article 2.22 of the IPL's Code of Conduct, which deals with minimum over-rate offences. As this was the team's first offence of the season, Parag received a monetary penalty.Parag became the second captain this season to face such a fine, following Mumbai Indians' Hardik Pandya, who was penalised similarly after their match against Gujarat Titans in Ahmedabad on Saturday, where MI suffered a 36-run defeat.The BCCI has implemented new regulations for the current season regarding over-rate violations. Captains will no longer face match bans but will receive demerit points based on the severity of the offence. This change follows Hardik's one-match ban in 2024, which caused him to miss Mumbai's season opener against Chennai Super Kings in IPL 2025.In the match against CSK, Rajasthan Royals secured a crucial victory. Sri Lankan spinner Wanindu Hasaranga played a pivotal role, claiming 4 wickets for 35 runs and exposing Chennai's weakness against spin bowling.Nitish Rana's half-century helped Rajasthan post a competitive total. The match went down to the wire, with Sandeep Sharma successfully defending 20 runs in the final over, including the crucial wicket of MS Dhoni.The victory marked Rajasthan's first win of the season after two consecutive losses. They had previously lost their opening match to Sunrisers Hyderabad and their second game to defending champions Kolkata Knight Riders.Rajasthan Royals will look to build on this momentum when they face Punjab Kings in their next match at the Maharaja Yadavindra Singh Cricket Stadium in Chandigarh.","Rajasthan Royals' stand-in captain Riyan Parag has been fined Rs 12 lakhs by the Board of Control for Cricket in India.

NEW DELHI: MS Dhoni on strike. 20 runs needed off the last over. The weight of expectations from thousands of roaring CSK fans. A nightmare scenario for any bowler, but Rajasthan Royals’ medium-pacer Sandeep Sharma rose to the occasion with nerves of steel.Defending a total against the ultimate last-over finisher is no small task, and the tension was palpable as Sandeep was handed the ball for the final over. He started with a wide, adding to the drama, but what followed stunned the Guwahati crowd into silence.On the next delivery, Sandeep bowled a low full toss, and Dhoni, attempting to muscle it across the leg side, made solid contact. But stationed at deep mid-wicket was Shimron Hetmyer, who sprinted to his left and pulled off a stunning low catch. The stadium, which had erupted moments earlier, fell into an eerie hush as Dhoni stood motionless, processing his dismissal.Sandeep, overwhelmed by the moment, folded his hands and looked up, thanking the almighty. His teammates rushed in to celebrate, knowing they had sealed a crucial victory. Rajasthan Royals had conquered the Dhoni factor, clinching the match by six runs.CSK fans had hoped for a vintage Dhoni-Jadeja rescue act with 45 needed off the last three overs.Dhoni, under scrutiny for batting at No. 9 in the previous match, promoted himself to No. 7 this time but struggled to find the boundary. In the 18th over, bowled by Maheesh Theekshana, he faced three deliveries and could only manage three runs, further increasing the pressure.The spark finally came in the penultimate over when Dhoni hammered Tushar Deshpande for a boundary off the first ball and followed it up with a huge six. The crowd found its voice again as CSK needed 20 off the last six balls.With Dhoni in full flow, many believed the script was set for another magical finish. But Sandeep Sharma had other plans. Keeping his composure, he executed his deliveries to perfection, starting with Dhoni’s dismissal and ensuring CSK never recovered from the setback.Earlier in the match, Rajasthan Royals posted 182/9, led by Riyan Parag’s 37 and Nitish Rana ’s explosive 81. CSK, despite Ruturaj Gaikwad’s 63, fell just short, thanks to Sandeep’s brilliance at the death.With this thrilling victory, Rajasthan Royals gained crucial momentum and will now shift their focus to their next clash against Punjab Kings on Saturday.","CSK fans had hoped for a vintage Dhoni-Jadeja rescue act with 45 needed off the last three overs.

Overcoming challenges and changing Mindset

A tough IPL and a fitting T20 farewell

A career of highs and lows: Rohit Sharma's journey

Bombay Sports Exchange Episode 1: Interview with Sanjog Gupta, CEO (Sports) at JioStar

NEW DELHI: Reflecting on India's incredible run in ICC tournaments, Rohit Sharma highlighted the team’s resilience over the past nine months, navigating cricket’s highs and lows. Under his leadership, India won the ICC Champions Trophy and the T20 World Cup , but the only blemish was the heartbreaking defeat to Australia in the 2023 ODI World Cup final.""Look at what this team has achieved in this big three tournaments. After playing the tournament like that and getting defeated only once, and that too in a final (2023 ODI World Cup),"" Rohit said in a video posted by Mumbai Indians on their X (formerly Twitter) handle. ""But imagine if we had won that as well to go undefeated in three ICC tournaments is crazy, never heard of, but I will take this, 23 wins in 24 games is unheard of. It looks very nice from the outside, but the team has gone through a lot of ups and downs.""We had some really tough times as well, but that is when you've got to celebrate. If you do things like this, you've got to celebrate. I feel that all the people who played these three tournaments deserve respect.""Rohit credited India’s success to the shift in mindset that began after their semifinal exit in the 2022 T20 World Cup in Australia. The team focused on clarity, fearless cricket, and collective responsibility.""But thereafter, we made a lot of things clear with the players that this is what we expect from you, and this is how we want you to play. So there was a lot of clarity, a lot of conversations with the players to perform,"" he added.""There needs to be freedom amongst the group so that they go out and play without any fear. There were a few lows, a few series that we lost, but we never panicked and we never went away from our thought process. When you are building a squad, the first thing that you need to put in front of you is what the team want. Where did we lack in the previous series, previous tournaments? Why did we not get the results?""Interestingly, Rohit's remarks came on the day when BCCI’s top brass was set to discuss India's future roadmap, though the meeting was later postponed.The journey was not without setbacks. In between the three ICC tournaments, India lost a rare home Test series to New Zealand and struggled in Australia. But Rohit saw these challenges as learning experiences.""These nine months are a perfect example of how life is -- it’s always going to be up and down. Any sportsman going through a low wants to fight back, bounce back, and turn things around. And that’s exactly what we did,"" he reflected.Rohit also opened up about his disappointing 2024 IPL season, where Mumbai Indians finished last. Despite the setback, he remained focused on the bigger picture -- ending his T20I career on a high.He continued, ""It (2024 IPL) was a low for the team, and I think we didn't play our best cricket also, and there were so many things after IPL to look forward to.""""I knew there was a World Cup coming up and I had to shift my focus to the World Cup, knowing that this is going to be my last T20 World Cup. So I really wanted to make it count, and obviously I knew without the help of other players it is not going to be possible. So we just got around as a group, and there was a lot of collective performance from everyone throughout the tournament,"" he said.India went on to defeat South Africa by 7 runs in Barbados, securing the T20 World Cup title.""My career for 17-18 years has always been up and down, and these nine months were no different,"" Rohit admitted.Speaking about his journey with Mumbai Indians, he acknowledged the changes over the years, adding, ""Obviously, since the time I started till now lot of things have changed because I used to bat middle-order then, now I am opening the batting. I was captain then (MI), but now I am not the captain. There were a few teammates with whom I won championships, they are not there, they are in the coaching role now.""So, the roles have changed, a lot of things have changed but the mindset has not changed. What I want to do for this team has not changed, just to go out there and win games and trophies, that is what MI is known for all these years.""","Rohit Sharma reflects on India's incredible run in ICC tournaments.

NEW DELHI: Chennai Super Kings (CSK) head coach Stephen Fleming was visibly frustrated with a journalist during the post-match press conference following his team's loss to Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) on Friday. The former New Zealand captain reacted strongly when the journalist compared CSK's style of play to other teams, dismissing the question as ""silly.""The match marked CSK’s first defeat of the season, with RCB securing their first victory at Chepauk since 2008, winning by 50 runs.Tensions flared in the press conference when Fleming confronted the journalist over the criticism of CSK’s approach.: ""In the first game, you chased 156 in almost 20 overs. Today, you scored 146. I know this is your way of playing cricket, but do you think it's kind of getting outdated?"": ""What do you mean by my way of playing? You talk about firepower. We have got firepower all the way through. I don't understand this question. Just because we don't swing from ball No.1 and have some luck go our way, just see at the end, who wins it. It is a positive brand of cricket. Don't discount us."": ""I am not discounting you."": ""You sort of are. Silly question.""Addressing the notion of ""home advantage,"" Fleming argued that Chepauk no longer provides CSK with a clear edge, as the team has struggled to read the pitch consistently.""Well, as we've been telling you for a number of years, there was no home advantage at Chepauk. We've won away from home a couple of times. And we haven't been able to read... we've been really honest with you,"" Fleming said in the post-match press conference.""We haven't been able to read the wickets here in the last couple of years. So, it's not new. We are trying to come to grips each day with what we get, and we don't know. It's not the Chepauk [of old] where you can just go in and play four spinners.

After Delhi Capitals (DC) secured a dominant seven-wicket victory over Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH), captain Axar Patel expressed his delight over Mitchell Starc ’s sensational five-wicket haul and provided insights into the franchise’s approach for their upcoming games at their primary home venue, Arun Jaitley Stadium.With this win, DC registered their second consecutive triumph in IPL 2025 , climbing to second place in the points table. Meanwhile, SRH, who had previously put up a stellar performance against Rajasthan Royals (RR), slipped to seventh after their second loss of the season.Speaking at the post-match presentation, Axar emphasised the importance of maintaining focus and executing game plans effectively.""I have told before that I am going to lead the side in the same manner. You need to be up with your game. You cannot take any game easily, there are 10 good teams playing. We need to focus on our plans and process. Today we were successful in doing so. Plan was to give Starc two overs at the start and two overs at the end, but he was in good rhythm. Hence, I gave him the third over and he was able to pick an important wicket. We have experienced players in the team, they give me suggestions. Sometimes I follow them. Enjoying playing with these players. We are playing at Kotla since many years, we will have similar plans. Need to assess the conditions after going there,"" Axar stated.After opting to bat first, SRH found themselves in early trouble as Starc’s fiery opening spell left them reeling at 37/4. A crucial 77-run partnership between Aniket Verma (74 off 41 balls, including five fours and six sixes) and Heinrich Klaasen (32 off 19 balls, with two fours and two sixes) helped SRH recover.However, DC’s bowlers continued to dominate, with Kuldeep Yadav (3/22) and Starc (5/35) dismantling the middle and lower order, restricting SRH to 163 in 18.4 overs.Chasing 164, DC got off to a strong start, courtesy of an 81-run opening stand between Jake Fraser-McGurk (38 off 32 balls, with four boundaries and two sixes) and Faf du Plessis (50 off 27 balls, with three fours and three sixes).Though DC lost a few quick wickets, Abishek Porel (34* off 18 balls, with two fours and two sixes) and Tristan Stubbs (21 off 14 balls, with three fours) ensured a comfortable finish. The duo guided DC home with four overs to spare, sealing a convincing seven-wicket victory.For his match-winning spell of 5/35, Mitchell Starc was adjudged the 'Player of the Match,' further solidifying his impact in DC’s campaign.","Delhi Capitals (DC) secured a dominant seven-wicket victory over Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) Captain Axar Patel expressed his delight over Mitchell Starc ’s sensational five- wicket haul.

NEW DELHI: Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) skipper Pat Cummins remains unfazed by consecutive defeats following their explosive start to IPL 2025 , maintaining that it's ""too early to worry.""After setting the tournament alight with a massive 286/6 against Rajasthan Royals , SRH faltered with a five-wicket loss to Lucknow Super Giants at home, followed by a seven-wicket defeat to Delhi Capitals on Sunday.""It's too early to worry about being two down, hopefully, we'll get back going forward,"" Cummins said post-match. ""As I said, we need to have a look at a few of our options. Maybe we just need to do one or two things differently and the results would change.""Also See: RR vs CSK Live Score Despite setbacks, the Australian pacer isn't looking for drastic changes. ""Overall, guys have shown glimpses of what they can do, don't think we'll change too much.""He acknowledged that top-order struggles and poor shot selection played a role in their downfall.""We didn't get going, didn't get a score on the board. A few wrong shots, but catches in the deep does happen in this format of the game.""Believing fine margins made the difference, he added, ""I don't think it's a big margin, on another day, you get going with a couple of shots, not everything went our way in the last two games, we can look back and think about different options.""Aniket Verma’s fighting 74-run knock was a rare bright spot in an otherwise disappointing batting effort, preventing SRH from collapsing below 150.""Coming into the tournament, everyone was super impressed with him (Aniket) going into the lead-up to the tournament, was fantastic and gave us half a chance, was impressive with the way he went about things (during the net sessions and practice games).""Meanwhile, Mitchell Starc , who dismantled SRH’s top order with a stunning five-wicket haul, credited a complete team effort for Delhi Capitals' dominant performance.""It has been a good day. With the ball, in the field and with the bat. It was a fantastic performance by us today. There's no ego in bowlers these days.""The left-arm pacer emphasized the importance of adaptability.""As a bowler, you got to think out of the box. You need to do things you wouldn't normally do. It was nice to contribute in the win today, we move forward from here.""Acknowledging the challenge of staying unpredictable, he added, ""Guys know what I am going to do, so you need to think out of the box. As an older player, you need to find different ways to get batters out. Tried to bowl different balls today, was pretty effective I think.""Starc also praised the young squad, stating, ""It's a new set of players, they have been fantastic. You get to play with new guys, it's a great group of players. It's a pretty young group to be fair, looking forward to playing more with them.""Delhi Capitals skipper Axar Patel was satisfied with how their plans unfolded.""You need to be up with your game. You can't take any game easily, there are 10 good teams playing. We need to focus on our plans and process. Today we were successful in doing so.""Explaining his decision to extend Starc’s spell, he said, ""The plan was to give Starc two overs at the start and two overs at the end, but he was in good rhythm.

NEW DELHI: Aniket Verma lit up the Visakhapatnam stadium with a sensational knock on Sunday in Visakhapatnam, smashing 74 off just 41 balls in Sunrisers Hyderabad ’s innings against Delhi Capitals .Coming in at a precarious position, with SRH struggling at 37/4, the 23-year-old counter-attacked with fearless stroke play to amass his first fifty in the Indian Premier League IPL ).His innings was laced with five fours and six sixes, boasting a strike rate of 180.49, the highest among SRH batters in the match.His explosive batting not only rescued SRH but also registered the second-highest score for an SRH batter at number five or below in IPL history, after Heinrich Klaasen’s 80 not out last season.Aniket took on Delhi’s formidable bowling attack, including Mitchell Starc and Kuldeep Yadav, with aggressive intent.His partnership with Heinrich Klaasen briefly steadied SRH, pushing the team to a fighting total of 163. Despite wickets tumbling around him, Aniket played with remarkable composure and power, proving why SRH invested in him during the IPL auction.Born in Jhansi, Uttar Pradesh, Aniket Verma is a rising cricket star, whose journey to the IPL has been one of relentless determination and sheer talent.The 23-year-old first caught the attention of scouts in the Madhya Pradesh Premier League 2024, where he smashed 273 runs in six innings, including a blistering 32-ball century and a tournament-high 25 sixes.His power-hitting ability made him a standout performer, earning him a trial with Sunrisers Hyderabad ahead of the IPL 2025 mega auction. SRH were quick to recognise his potential and secured him for his base price of INR 30 Lakh.Aniket’s cricketing journey wasn’t easy. He lost his mother at a young age and was raised by his uncle, Amit Verma, who became his biggest support system.Despite financial struggles, Amit ensured that Aniket received proper training, driving him 13 kilometers daily to Ankur Cricket Academy in Bhopal.His childhood coach, Jyoti Prakash Tyagi, immediately recognised his exceptional power and predicted that one day, Aniket would score 400 runs in an innings -- a prophecy that came true when he hit 400 in a four-day inter-division match.During the COVID-19 lockdown, Aniket sharpened his power game at Faith Cricket Club, practicing on an international-standard ground and analysing his own batting footage to improve his technique.His admiration for big hitters like Heinrich Klaasen and Hardik Pandya has shaped his aggressive batting style.Now, with a dream IPL debut knock of 74 off 41 balls, Aniket has announced himself on the big stage. With SRH backing his six-hitting abilities, he could be the next big thing in Indian cricket.","Aniket Verma scored 74 off just 41 balls in Sunrisers Hyderabad's innings against Delhi Capitals.

Barcelona secured a commanding 4-1 victory over Girona at the Olympic Stadium on Sunday, with Robert Lewandowski scoring twice to help his team move three points clear at the top of La Liga. The win came after Real Madrid had temporarily drawn level on points following their victory against Leganes on Saturday.Barcelona extended their unbeaten run to 20 matches this year, with goals coming from a Ladislav Krejci own goal, Lewandowski's double, and Ferran Torres's strike. Girona's Arnaut Danjuma managed to score an equalizer during the match.Lewandowski, who remains three goals ahead in Spain's golden boot race against Real Madrid's Kylian Mbappe, shared his thoughts on the victory: ""We played with patience, we had a plan and if we play with that plan we can always score a lot of goals and win the game.""The 36-year-old Polish striker expressed confidence about his future in the sport: ""I know a lot of people are talking about my age but... I want to play more years at the top level. I feel very good physically, I think looking at the stats there's no difference now to a few years ago.""Girona, currently sitting in 13th place, had previously beaten Barcelona twice last season but failed to replicate that form. Their coach Michel Sanchez acknowledged Barcelona's superiority: ""They were superior. There's a difference between the teams and that's the truth... Barcelona dream of titles every year.""Manager Hansi Flick rotated his squad with an upcoming Copa del Rey semi-final against Atletico Madrid in mind. The first half saw Barcelona dominating possession, with Lamine Yamal and Fermin Lopez providing attacking threats.A controversial moment arose when Barcelona appealed for a penalty after Fermin was brought down by Yaser Asprilla. While VAR showed contact inside the area, the referee ruled that Lopez had fouled Asprilla.Barcelona broke the deadlock before halftime when Yamal's free-kick was deflected into his own net by Krejci. Girona equalized through Danjuma early in the second half, but Lewandowski quickly restored Barcelona's lead with a clever finish.The Polish striker added his second goal after being set up by substitute Frenkie de Jong. Torres completed the scoring, while Yamal hit the crossbar in the closing stages.This performance marked the 20th time this season that Flick's team has scored four or more goals in 45 games, as they pursue a potential treble.Flick expressed his satisfaction with the team's attacking mentality: ""This is what I love about my team, they always want to score goals, it's always like that. This is the mentality and the attitude of the team and it's good, I think everyone loves it, you love it, the fans love it, the club loves it, and everyone is happy at the moment.""In other La Liga matches, Athletic Bilbao drew 0-0 with Osasuna at home, while Villarreal defeated Getafe 2-1 to close the gap on fourth place to six points.Real Betis continued their impressive form with a sixth consecutive victory, beating local rivals Sevilla 2-1 in a derby match.Valencia moved to 15th place after securing a 1-0 victory over Mallorca, putting them four points clear of the relegation zone.","Barcelona defeated Girona 4-1 at the Olympic Stadium on Sunday.

Sels heroics

Brighton, Mar 30, 2025 -Nottingham Forest reached the FA Cup semi-finals for the first time in 34 years as Belgian goalkeeper Matz Sels starred in a 4-3 penalty shoot-out win over Brighton on Saturday.After the quarter-final clash at the Amex Stadium finished 0-0 following extra-time, Sels took centre-stage to send Forest to Wembley.Sels saved spot-kicks from Jack Hinshelwood and Diego Gomez and, although Forest's Neco Williams blazed over, Ryan Yates held his nerve to stroke home the winner.Forest also needed shoot-outs to get past third-tier Exeter and top-flight strugglers Ipswich in the fourth and fifth rounds respectively this season.Nuno Espirito Santo 's side are enjoying a remarkable season that could culminate in Champions League qualification and a first FA Cup final appearance since 1991.""It was such a stressful moment. Matz saved us again. He's been doing really well. It's the third time and we've always been successful. Credit to him,"" Nuno said.""We are so happy. It's a huge moment for all of us to share with our fans.""We have to focus on the Premier League but it's going to be a beautiful moment for all of us on our journey.""Forest, who last won the FA Cup in 1959, have climbed to third in the Premier League, leaving them within touching distance of appearing in the Champions League for the first time since 1980-81.They are five points clear of fourth-placed Chelsea and six ahead of fifth-placed Manchester City with nine games to go.Brian Clough's men were the last Forest team to make the FA Cup semi-finals, beating West Ham before losing the final to Tottenham.Forest join Crystal Palace in the last four after the Eagles won 3-0 at Fulham in Saturday's other quarter-final.On Sunday, Manchester City travel to Bournemouth and Aston Villa visit Championship side Preston, the last club from outside the top tier in this season's tournament.Forest crushed Brighton 7-0 at the City Ground in Premier League in February, a result that ranked as the Seagulls' heaviest defeat for 67 years.Since that humbling loss, Brighton had won four times in a five-game unbeaten run in the league, but they were unable to stop Forest's penalty mastery.Nuno surprisingly dropped wingers Callum Hudson-Odoi and Anthony Elanga to the bench in a move that appeared to prioritise Tuesday's league clash with Manchester United.Forest were also without Chris Wood after their leading scorer suffered a hip injury on international duty with New Zealand.Wood's replacement Taiwo Awoniyi went close to an early opener, accelerating on to Ola Aina's pass for a stinging strike that Bart Verbruggen saved at his near post.But, shorn of their best attacking options, Forest struggled to make headway after that.Brighton were hardly much more incisive, with Pervis Estupinan's long-range blast pushed away by Sels.Carlos Baleba was inches away from putting the Seagulls ahead on the stroke of half-time, lashing just wide from the edge of the area.After their tepid start, Forest finally showed signs of life when Morgan Gibbs-White's strike from distance forced a superb save from Verbruggen.But Nuno had seen enough and sent on Hudson-Odoi and Elanga.Verbruggen repelled Elanga's close-range effort to force the tie into extra-time.Gomez nearly won it for Brighton in the closing stages, but his header from Brajan Gruda's cross was brilliantly saved by Sels, foreshadowing the keeper's heroics in the shoot-out.smg/dj",Nottingham Forest reach the FA Cup semi-finals for the first time in 34 years.

Real Madrid striker Kylian Mbappe equalled Cristiano Ronaldo 's first-season record of 33 goals for the club after scoring twice in Saturday's 3-2 victory over Leganes in La Liga , matching the Portuguese star's tally from the 2009-10 campaign across 44 appearances in all competitions.Mbappe's performance helped Real Madrid come from behind to secure the win at the Santiago Bernabeu , bringing them level with Barcelona at the top of the table before the Catalans' Sunday match against Girona.The French forward opened the scoring with a Panenka-style penalty down the middle and later completed Madrid's comeback with a free-kick after the team had fallen behind.""It's very special... to have the same number of goals as Cristiano is always good,"" Mbappe told Real Madrid TV. ""We know what he means for Real Madrid and me, we speak, he gives me a lot of advice, he scored many goals -- but we have to win trophies here.""Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti praised Mbappe's recent form following his summer transfer from Paris Saint-Germain.""He's doing very well, he's a lot more active and present in (the team's) play,"" Ancelotti told reporters.

CHENNAI: In an otherwise disappointing Indian Women’s League (IWL) campaign for Sethu FC, Amnah Nababi has been one of the few shining lights.But it is not just the on-field performances – she is Sethu’s best performer with six goals and one assist in 10 appearances – that have made her stand out in her maiden IWL season. The Uganda international, in her constant fight against poverty back home, is using football as a powerful tool to perform social work and give back to her community.The 26-year-old Amnah is allotting 20% of her IWL salary to “support” underprivileged children in her home district Luweero, situated about 70 kilometres from Kampala, where she is currently based. “Poverty is one thing that we are struggling with in Uganda. There are a lot of kids who do not have enough food at home, they do not have enough money to pay school fees. Their background is not really good. I pursued my education through scholarships, so I feel that I should go out there and support the kids from the money I receive through football,” said Amnah, who netted a brace in Sethu’s 3-1 victory over Odisha FC on Thursday.“Whenever I get an opportunity, I share the money with them. Obviously, I have been using my Sethu salary for the cause. One of the things I am planning to do after the IWL season is to go back home and give them more,” she added.Amnah, a capable operator in both attack and midfield, took the noble initiative a few years ago and now leads her “team” comprising about 30 children.“I started doing this during Covid. I had to do personal training (in Luweero) and the kids would come and play football with me. I used to play with them because I was free. After that, I became busy with football and work (she worked at an NGO). I have a small team, I cannot call it an academy because it is not registered. The kids stay around my home in Luweero and they get together after school in the evenings. I try to support them with small things.”Amnah relies on her friends when she is on duty away from home. “There are people who take care of the kids. Some of the kids who are now 15 or 16 years old take care of the younger ones. I have a lot of things to do when I go back home, many people are waiting for me. I hope to go there (Luweero) and spend time with the children,” Amnah said.Amnah, with a heart of gold and plenty of footballing tricks up her sleeve, is “setting an example” both on and off the field.","Amnah Nababi is Sethu FC's best performer in the Indian Women's League.

The Confederation of Brazilian Football (CBF) announced on Friday the dismissal of Dorival Junior from his position as Brazil 's head coach in the aftermath of Brazil's devastating 4-1 loss to their fierce rivals Argentina in the FIFA World Cup qualifying match three days earlier.The five-time World Cup champions Brazil currently occupy fourth position in the South American qualifying standings, trailing Argentina, the reigning world champions, by 10 points and also behind Ecuador and Uruguay. Argentina secured their qualification for the World Cup by beating Brazil.South American teams have six automatic qualification spots available for the World Cup.""Dorival Junior is no longer in charge of the Brazilian national team. The management thanks him and wishes him success for the rest of his career,"" the CBF said in a statement.Dorival, aged 62, took over the managerial role in January 2024, replacing interim coach Fernando Diniz. However, his tenure has been marked by underwhelming performances in the 2026 World Cup qualifying matches for the tournament to be held across the United States, Mexico and Canada.Brazil's upcoming qualifying fixtures include an away match against Ecuador and a home game against Paraguay, scheduled for June 4 and June 9, respectively.""Nobody expected what we saw today (against Argentina), and the responsibility is entirely mine,"" the Brazil coach had said after the crushing defeat.Dorival assumed leadership of the Selecao following his successful tenure securing championships with Flamengo and Sao Paulo.Brazilian press reports suggest that Ancelotti remains a candidate to replace Dorival, alongside Portuguese tactician Jorge Jesus, who presently manages Al Hilal in Saudi Arabia.Another Portuguese coach, Abel Ferreira, who achieved multiple championships with Brazilian side Palmeiras, is also considered a potential candidate for the position.Ancelotti, however, is confident of completing the term of his contract in Madrid which runs until June 2026.The incoming manager's primary responsibility will be to revive Brazil's distinctive playing approach and secure their first championship since claiming the Copa America in 2019.","Dorival Junior has been dismissed from his position as Brazil's head coach.

This victory marks Sabalenka's second title of 2025, following her Brisbane triumph in January, and her eighth WTA 1000 title overall.Sabalenka, who had recently lost the Indian Wells final to Russian teenager Mirra Andreeva, showed determination not to repeat that outcome in Miami.""I'm super happy to have this trophy, I was able to play my best tennis in the final,"" said Sabalenka, acknowledging Pegula's performance and referencing their previous encounter at the US Open final.The first set was marked by service struggles, featuring seven breaks of serve.

She broke twice to establish a 3-1 lead and maintained her dominance to complete the victory in one hour and 27 minutes.""I think I was able to completely forget about (it being) the final, about the outside things and I was just so focused on the game,"" Sabalenka reflected.The Belarusian has won 12 of her last 14 matches against top 10 players, attributing her success to her performance in crucial moments.""It is all about those key moments of the match, about playing aggressive and staying with the game plan, going for shots without being afraid of losing the point,"" she explained.This marked Pegula's third loss to Sabalenka in a final. The American acknowledged Sabalenka's superiority on hard courts.""I consider myself one of the world's best hard-court players, but she's probably the best,"" Pegula stated after the match.""She just keeps ... raising her level in key moments of the match when she needs to, and I feel like that was the big difference today and the last few times I have played her,"" Pegula added.Despite the loss, Pegula expressed satisfaction with her tournament performance: ""Happy to be in another big 1000 final and having consistent results and keep going deep in tournaments.

Football superstar and Argentina's World Cup-winning captain Lionel Messi was in attendance at the Hard Rock Stadium on Friday, where Novak Djokovic advanced to the Miami Open final with a commanding victory over 14th-seeded Grigor DimitrovIn pursuit of his 100th singles title, and seventh in Miami, Djokovic won 6-2, 6-3 and will face upstart Jakub Mensik, who upset Taylor Fritz 7-6 (7-4), 4-6, 7-6 (7-4) in the other semfinial, for the title.During his post-match court interview, Djokovic recognised that Messi, who currently represents Inter Miami in Major League Soccer, was present, referring to him as ""King Leo.""Djokovic revealed that Messi, accompanied by his wife and children, visited the locker room where they exchanged presents. While Djokovic had previously attended Messi's matches, this marked the first occasion where the football star watched him play.""Obviously, it's a thrill to have his whole family,'' Djokovic said. ""It's a huge honour. He's such a great athlete, not just a football player. His impact on the world of sports in the last 20 years has been immense.""To have him watch me live brings me great joy and excitement and also a little pressure. It's definitely different when he brings his family. I was touched by that.""The 37-year-old Djokovic's performance hasn't been up to his lofty standards, beginning with a withdrawal due to injury at the Australian Open in January. At Indian Wells earlier this month, he suffered a first-round defeat against Botic van de Zandschulp.During the third game, play was halted when security personnel escorted a disruptive spectator from the venue. The chair umpire descended from his position and approached the stands while summoning security staff.Dimitrov engaged in a verbal exchange with the spectator and proceeded to direct the umpire's attention to the location of the troublesome fan at the sideline.""It's just heckling, it's fine,'' Dimitrov said. ""I'm a very calm guy overall. I don't pick any fights but don't trigger me.''Despite Dimitrov securing an early break against Djokovic in the opening game, the Serbian regained composure and secured the first set in 32 minutes.The current men's record holder of 24 Grand Slam titles displayed remarkable serving efficiency, landing 87% of first serves with merely six misses throughout the match. He maintained exceptional control, recording only five unforced errors during the 70-minute contest.""Now I know how it feels to be (John) Isner and (Reilly) Opelka,'' Djokovic said of two serving behemoths. ""Maybe my serve has been a bit underrated.""Djokovic extended his dominant head-to-head record against Dimitrov to 13-1. The Bulgarian player showcased his finest performance during the match.""He wears confidence like a stain on your shirt,'' Dimitrov said. ""It's beautiful to see. Only a few athletes on earth possess that quality.''Mensik, who entered the Miami Open as world number 54, has yet to reach a final in an ATP 1,000-point tournament.In a crucial moment against Fritz, he displayed remarkable composure at 4-4 in the final tiebreaker, securing victory by winning three consecutive points.Throughout the match lasting two hours and 25 minutes, Mensik failed to break serve but managed to win with a brilliant backhand winner down the line at 5-4. Fritz subsequently lost the next two points, sending a forehand long after a 20-shot exchange and netting a forehand on match point.Prior to the match, Mensik had a handshake with Messi. ""I didn't wash my hands before I stepped on the court,"" Mensik said.Tennis inspiration came to Mensik through Djokovic, whom he faced in a three-set match at the Shanghai Masters last October. The age difference between them stands at 18 years.","Novak Djokovic beats Grigor Dimitrov 6-2, 6-3 to reach Miami Open final.

You know, I really wanted to keep that moment in my mind.""Eala exhibited remarkable poise in the biggest match of her WTA Tour career, showcasing excellent preparation despite her limited experience.""I don't have a lot of experience on the WTA Tour, that's for sure, but I do have experience with compartmentalising. I have experience with being professional.""""I have no hesitation to bring that part of me out when I'm on court and when I'm in a setting that calls for professionalism.""Eala's professional journey began at age 13 when she left the Philippines to join Rafael Nadal's academy in Mallorca. She has spent six years immersed in tennis, training alongside top coaches and aspiring tour players.Her disciplined approach stems more from family influence than her academy training.""It's not something I learned in the academy. It's something I've gotten from, I guess, from my experience as the things I have been through leading up to this moment. It's also something my family has guided me through, it's part of my family's values.""""They are successful people in business, they are successful in their own fields and people I look up to. I think they lead by example when it comes to that.""The match drew special supporters to her box. Her parents traveled from the Philippines, accompanied by an uncle and cousin from Seattle. Toni Nadal , Rafael's uncle and former coach, represented the academy.""So a lot of extra motivation for my match today. I really wanted to have my family see me winning, but I know they'd be happy just to see me compete in this setting.""""And Toni also came in to Miami. That did mean a lot, because I have been working closely with him for so long, alongside my main coaches from the academy, it showed a lot about the confidence and the pride the academy has in me.""Eala recalled a previous photograph with Swiatek at an academy graduation event two years ago. She expressed hope that her victory would inspire young people in the Philippines to pursue tennis.The 19-year-old from Quezon City joins a list of teenagers who have made dramatic entrances into WTA elite competition.

Miami Gardens: Alexandra Eala , a 19-year-old wildcard from the Philippines, produced a huge upset at the Miami Open on Wednesday, defeating world number two Iga Swiatek 6-2 7-5 to reach the semi-finals.Ranked 140th in the world, Eala, the first woman from her country to reach the last eight of a WTA 1000 tournament, took advantage of a unusually poor display from Swiatek, keeping her focus as she fought back from 4-2 down in the second set.Eala broke the Pole for the eighth and final time when Swiatek was serving to stay in the match at 6-5 down in the second set and looked stunned as she struggled to contain her emotions.""I'm just in disbelief right now. It's so surreal,"" she said on court.""I'm so happy and so blessed to be able to compete with such a player on this stage,"" said Eala, who has now beaten three grand slam winners on her route to the last four at Miami -- having dealt with Jelena Ostapenko and Madison Keys before upsetting four-time French Open champion Swiatek.""I'm trusting my shots and I have a great team to tell me that I can do it,"" she said.Eala moved to Spain at the age of 13 to join Rafael Nadal's academy in Mallorca and Toni Nadal, the Spaniard's uncle and former coach, was in her box for the match.""It meant a lot that he showed up here. It showed the confidence he had in me and the confidence the academy had in me,"" she said.Eala will face Jessica Pegula , who beat Britain's Emma Raducanu in the other quarter-final.

World number one Aryna Sabalenka fought back in the second set to secure her spot in the semi-finals of the Miami Open , defeating China's Zheng Qinwen 6-2, 7-5 on Tuesday.This win marks Sabalenka’s first appearance in the semi-finals in Miami, where she’ll meet Italy's Jasmine Paolini for a chance to reach the final.It seemed like a straightforward match for the Belarusian against the ninth seed Zheng as she easily took the first set. However, Zheng made adjustments and came out strong in the second set, breaking Sabalenka twice to establish a 4-2 lead.Sabalenka faced significant pressure at 0-40 but, after showing some frustration, rallied to hold serve and tie it at 4-4. She then unleashed a powerful finish, breaking Zheng again to lead 6-5 and serving confidently to clinch the match.""Honestly every match is tough against her, I always have to work really hard to get the win and today was an incredible level from both of us,"" said Sabalenka.""I'm super happy to get this win.

Paolini, aiming for her second WTA 1000 title since winning in Dubai last year, exuded confidence and expressed that she knew her hard work would eventually lead to results.""I think I didn't play bad this season but I just didn't have a great result.

Paolini sinks Osaka

Australia's Alex de Minaur put an end to Brazilian talent Joao Fonseca 's challenge at the Miami Open, outlasting the 18-year-old 5-7, 7-5, 6-3 in an enthralling contest.Attendance on stadium court had been sparse throughout Monday, but the Hard Rock Stadium turned into a mini-Maracana Stadium for Fonseca's match, complete with Brazilian flags and football-style chanting.Fonseca brought his energetic brand of ultra-attacking tennis, but De Minaur was up to the challenge, coping with both the blistering forehands and the partisan crowd.Such was the dominance of Fonseca's raucous support that the referee switched to Portuguese for his appeals for quiet.But de Minaur won six of the final seven games to move into the fourth round, keeping his cool even when the crowd, at times, disrupted his serve preparation.""Mentally I was ready for this match, I knew I was not only going to play an incredible talent like Joao, playing with immense confidence and nothing to lose, but also an incredible crowd that was on his side from the first point until the last,"" de Minaur said.""One of my biggest strengths is my mentality and that is what got me the win today,"" he added.Top seed Alexander Zverev recovered from a slow start to power into the fourth round of the Miami Open with a 7-5, 6-4 win against Australia's Jordan Thompson.The German was 4-1 down in the first set but then went on a roll, winning eight of the next nine games to progress.Zverev lost in the opening round at Indian Wells, but with Carlos Alcaraz already out in Miami he will fancy his chances of adding to his list of seven Masters 1000 titles.Third-seed Taylor Fritz also moved into the fourth round beating Denis Shapovalov of Canada 7-5, 6-3.The American let slip a 5-2 lead in the first set, but regained control with his serve proving too much for Shapovalov.In the women's draw, third-seed Coco Gauff 's bid ended with a 6-4 6-4 loss to Poland's Magda Linette .Top-seeded Aryna Sabalenka eased her way into the last eight with a 6-4, 6-4 win over last year's winner Danielle Collins of the USA.Next, Sabalenka will be up against ninth seeded Olympic gold medallist Zheng Qinwen who reached her second consecutive WTA 1000 quarter-final, with a straight-sets win over Ashlyn Krueger.""I'm super happy to get this win in straight sets and happy with the level I played today,"" said Sabalenka.""She's a tough opponent, and we had a lot of tough and tricky matches in the past. So was very happy to get through this one,"" she added.Italy's Jasmine Paolini enjoyed a 3-6, 6-4, 6-4 comeback win over Naomi Osaka in 2 hours and 15 minutes.Since her comeback from maternity leave 15 months ago, Osaka has been showing some signs of getting back towards her best but Paolini was the first top 10 player Osaka has faced this year.""I don't think that I can say that I've played a lot of matches against top players like this in a while,"" said Osaka.""The way she plays kind of catches me off guard, simply because of her height. I didn't know she could hit like that,"" she added.Emma Raducanu continued her impressive form in Miami, cruising to a 6-1, 6-3 victory in 69 minutes over American Amanda Anisimova, who had eliminated Indian Wells winner Mirra Andreeva on Sunday.It is the first time Raducanu has won four straight WTA Tour main draw matches in a row since her US Open triumph in 2021. She will face American Jessica Pegula next.Raducanu, who has brought in some old faces from the early days of her career for this tournament, said she was benefitting from their presence.""I'm really happy with how things are on and off the court right now and just so happy that's able to transfer on to the match court,"" she said.Alexandra Eala, the 19-year-old from the Philippines who upset Australian Open champion Madison Keys on Sunday, was handed a place in the quarter-finals after her fourth round opponent, Spain's Paula Badosa, pulled out with a lower back injury.In the last eight Eala will face second seed Iga Swiatek who battled past Ukraine's Elina Svitolina 7-6 (7/5) 6-3.","Alex de Minaur beats Joao Fonseca 5-7, 7-5, 6-3 in enthralling contest.

Alexandra Eala , a 19-year-old tennis player from the Philippines, achieved a historic victory at the Miami Open on Sunday by defeating Australian Open champion Madison Keys .This win marked a significant milestone as Eala became the first Filipino woman to defeat a top-10 ranked player since the ranking system's inception 50 years ago.The emotional victory saw Eala celebrating with her team, embracing them while fighting back tears.""It's a big thing to take in, and I feel it's important for me to take it in step by step. I'm so super proud of what I was able to accomplish, but it definitely fuels me more.""""I know and it's in my mind that I have a next match, but I need to stop, and I need to recognise that what I did today was really amazing. I think my reaction on court, you know, sums up pretty much how I feel about it.""At the age of 13, Eala's family made the decision to send her to Rafael Nadal's academy in Mallorca, Spain, recognizing her evident talent.The academy's exceptional coaching and facilities helped shape Eala into the 2022 US Open girls' singles champion and a competitive player on the WTA Tour .""The academy has been my home for the past seven years. Of course, my family should take credit for the foundation that they laid out before they sent me there.""""But of course, the academy was able to build on that foundation in such a way that I'm able to be where I am now. And I think the combination of everything that I've been through since I started tennis is what has led to this moment and what has led to me having all these opportunities.""The decision to move to Europe was made easier as her brother Miko also joined the academy.""It was definitely a big decision for me, for us. As soon as I heard that, I jumped at the opportunity because I knew that I had to get out of the country eventually to improve.""Eala's tennis journey began with her grandfather, a club player who coached her brother and cousins before focusing on her development.""I was kind of the next in line to do that and to spend time with him. It eventually blossomed into the career I have now.""Her victory came shortly after fellow Nadal Academy member Coleman Wong from Hong Kong defeated American 13th seed Ben Shelton in Miami.""I'm super happy for him and to see someone that I've known so long do so well is definitely an inspiration. Not just to me, but I feel in general a lot of people can take inspiration from him.""Despite her success, Eala maintains a humble perspective about being a role model for young players in the Philippines.""The young kids, the youth in the Philippines, they don't need to take inspiration from me. They can take inspiration from anyone they want. You know, they can take inspiration from other things, which is what I did growing up.""","Alexandra Eala became the first Filipino woman to defeat a top-10 ranked player since the ranking system's inception 50 years ago.

CHENNAI: Sankar Muthusamy recorded the biggest win of his nascent career yet, defeating World No. 2 Anders Antonsen of Denmark 18-21, 21-12, 21-5 in the Swiss Open men’s singles pre-quarterfinals in Basel late on Thursday.What surprised many was the way in which the Indian dominated the deciding game. Despite losing the opener, the 21-year-old did not give up and pushed the match to the decider. He was helped by a flurry of unforced errors that Antonsen committed — the Dane hitting the shuttle wide and long on multiple occasions. Sankar made the most of the opportunity and succeeded.The Chennai lad entered the tournament as a qualifier and registered two wins to enter the main draw.“It feels good, and I have been doing well in this tournament. The first game (against Antonsen) lasted for close to 30 minutes and I feel that he became tired after that. I was able to score points from long rallies and capitalised on the situation. I was focusing on one point at a time and did not think much about the result,” Sankar, ranked 64th, told TOI from Basel.“In the deciding game, I was just expecting him to come back at me and was ready to handle the situation. My aim was to move him around the court and make him tired.”Sankar, who was a former junior World No. 1, lacked consistency in the 2024 season due to various reasons. However, he started the 2025 season on a bright note, reaching the quarterfinals of the Thailand Masters. He was later down with fever and could not give his best in the next few tournaments. However, Sankar recovered well ahead of the Swiss Open.The youngster, who is known for his defensive play, has improved his attacking skills and stroke-making.“My strokes have become sharper than usual, and I am able to finish off points from the rear court. My power is gradually increasing, and I am working on it. There is still a long way to go,” he said.Sankar’s long-time coach Aravindan Samiappan said that the win has come at the right time for his ward.“The moment has not sunk in properly. Sankar was an underdog and had nothing to lose. Our plan was to stay neck-to-neck on points and towards the end anything could have happened. But none would have expected such a scoreline in the decider. It was a bit shocking but that happens sometimes,” Aravindan said.The coach feels that opponents can no longer come prepared for Sankar, as he lends unpredictability into his game now.“Sankar can vary the pace of the match whenever required, and this was not the case one and a half years ago. Players could anticipate what he was going to do, as he played at a single pace. Now, you cannot predict him, and that is the major difference in his gameplay,” pointed out the coach.","Sankar Muthusamy defeated World No. 2 Anders Antonsen of Denmark 18-21, 21-12,. 21-5 in the Swiss Open men’s singles pre-quarterfinals in Basel late on Thursday.

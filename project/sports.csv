CUTTACK: Rohit Sharma generally enjoys his interactions with journalists and often sports a smiling face at press conferences. But at the pre-match media conference ahead of the first game of the ongoing ODI series against England in Nagpur, Rohit lost his cool, a rarity for him.Asked to reflect on his prolonged lean patch and whether he had been asked to clarify his future plans to selectors, the India captain had shot back, ""How is it relevant that I talk about my future plans sitting here when there are three ODIs and a Champions Trophy coming up?""(Such) reports have been going around for a number of years, but I am not here to clarify those. For me, these three games and the Champions Trophy are very important, so my focus is on these games. We will see what happens afterwards.""Thankfully, on Sunday, Rohit was back to his usual best with bat in hand in the second ODI against England. He looked calm and composed and would have soothed many nerves with his 32nd ODI century.Later, at the presentation ceremony, Rohit, an easy choice for the Player-of-the-Match award at the Barabati Stadium , reflected on his approach.""I really broke it down into pieces about how I wanted to bat. It's a 50-over format, a little longer than T20 and a lot shorter than Test cricket. Obviously, you still need to break it down and assess what you need to do at regular intervals and that is what I kept doing. It was important for a batter who gets set to bat as deep as possible and that was my focus.""Prior to Sunday's century - his second fastest in ODIs - Rohit's last 16 innings across formats had yielded 6, 5, 23, 8, 2, 52, 0, 8, 18, 11, 3, 6, 10, 3, 9, and 2. He had scored 166 runs at an average of 10.37. During this period, he managed to score 30 or more runs only once and had sub-10 scores 11 times. The only half century came against New Zealand in the Bengaluru Test in Oct last year.However, Rohit's ODI scores since his last century (131) against Afghanistan in the ODI World Cup on Oct 11, 2023, are 86, 48, 46, 87, 4, 40, 61, 47, 47, 58, 64, 35 and 2. It's quite good considering he was consistently scoring half-centuries or getting out in the 40s.However, now that he has retired from T20Is after leading India to the T20 World Cup title last year - and that ODIs are played less these days - his lack of runs across formats came under the spotlight.Naturally, Rohit was long overdue for an innings which fits his nickname, the 'Hitman'. Rohit will be hoping this is not a one-off and that he can find consistency and rediscover the knack of scoring big hundreds heading into the Champions Trophy.""Looking at the pitch, when you play on black soil, (the ball) tends to skid on a bit, so it's important that you show the full face of the bat when you are batting initially. Once I got into my innings, I understood what they were trying to do - bowling into my body and trying to not give any room, keep it on the stumps,"" Rohit said about his approach to the innings.""That's where I prepared my plan as well, what I wanted to do with those kinds of deliveries, trying to access the gaps which were there. It's about understanding what you want to do as a batter and obviously I got very good support from (Shubman) Gill to start with and then Shreyas (Iyer),"" acknowledged the skipper.With Gill, Rohit shared a 136-run opening stand in under 17 overs. The Punjab opener, ""a very, very classy player who doesn't get overawed by the situation"" - according to his skipper - was all praise for his senior opening partner.""He makes things much easier than what it is,"" Gill said after the game. ""The way he dominated the fast bowlers today was just a treat to watch from the non-striker's end.""Rohit had spoken about ticking all the boxes before the Champions Trophy starts on Feb 19. With his trademark innings leading India to series winning victory, he certainly has ticked a very important checkbox for himself as well as the team.Meanwhile, teammate Ravindra Jadeja brushed aside any dressing-room concerns about the skipper's lean patch. ""In our dressing room, there was no such atmosphere (of pressure). He is such a great player that he knows exactly how to build an innings,"" Jadeja said about Rohit's match-winning century.""It's just a matter of one good innings. As you saw, it didn't even feel like he hadn't scored runs in the previous innings. The shots he played were smooth and he looked confident. He played normal strokes,"" said Jadeja.","Rohit Sharma scores 32nd ODI century in second ODI against England. Rohit's last 16 innings across formats had yielded 6, 5, 23, 8, 2, 52, 0, 8,. 18, 11, 3, 6, 10, 3,. 9, and 2.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118130708,imgsize-44118,width-400,resizemode-4/118130708.jpg"

reflects on victory

Tactical decisions and overcoming challenges

A historic win for the franchise

Sikandar Raza’s clutch performance

The standard of ILT20

Dubai Capitals clinched their maiden ILT20 title in a thrilling final against Desert Vipers , securing a four-wicket victory at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium on Sunday. Chasing 189, Sikandar Raza played a decisive role with a blistering 12-ball 34 not out, ensuring victory in the final over. Rovman Powell 's 63 and Shai Hope's composed 43 provided the foundation for the Capitals' chase.For the Vipers, Max Holden’s resilient 76 kept them in contention after early setbacks, while Sam Curran 's unbeaten half-century, 62*, featuring five fours and three sixes, propelled them to a competitive total.Following the triumph, Dubai Capitals' captain Sam Billings lauded his team’s perseverance and composure under pressure.""What a game of cricket again. We've had some brilliant games against the Desert Vipers, and tonight was an outstanding one. At one point, it was all about small margins - both teams made errors that shifted the momentum back and forth. But the composure our guys showed at the end was remarkable. In Twenty20 cricket, especially chasing in this part of the world, you're never out of the game if two people get going. It was a brilliant game of cricket and an incredible feeling to come out on top.""Billings reflected on the Capitals’ journey, comparing it to their previous season.""Similar to last year, we were bottom of the table and had to win five or six in a row to reach the final. Today, I don’t think we bowled as well as we could have, but we managed to peg them back towards the end. The key difference from last year is that we didn’t let them completely get away. We’ve played good cricket, won in different ways, and today, thankfully, we got across the line.""On his strategy of utilising seven different bowlers, Billings explained the impact of missing key pacer Dushmantha Chameera Also See: ICC Champions Trophy 2025 ""When you lose a player of Chameera’s quality, it's a big challenge. He’s been our standout pace bowler, and his skill level is phenomenal. We had to adapt, and while I would have liked to use Haider more, the situation with Sam Curran and Max Holden going strong made it difficult. Chopping and changing the attack was necessary to disrupt the batters' rhythm.""Being the first captain to secure a major trophy for the Capitals franchise, Billings dedicated the win to the ownership group.""This win is for Kiran [Grandhi] and the whole family. Kiran is one of the finest gentlemen in cricket - classy, full of integrity, and incredibly calm. He trusts players to do their jobs without undue pressure. I was gutted when we couldn’t get it done last year, but this time, we delivered. As players, we play to win trophies, create memories, and this triumph means everything.""Praising Raza’s match-winning knock, Billings stated, ""Yeah, clutch - that’s the word. I told him in the last few games, ‘You're going to be the guy to hit the winning runs.’ He has done it before, and his experience in high-pressure moments is invaluable. Rovman Powell and Dussen played their roles brilliantly too, but Raza’s finishing ability is what sets him apart.""On the quality of the ILT20 tournament, Billings highlighted its growing reputation.""The standard is improving each year. Having nine overseas players elevates the competition, and when you have passionate crowds, it adds to the pressure. This league tests skill and temperament across three different venues, making adaptability crucial. The emergence of local talents like Mohammed Waseem, Haider Ali, and young Farhan is another positive sign. If the tournament can find a dedicated window in the cricket calendar, it will only get stronger.""Dubai Capitals’ triumph in ILT20 Season 3 was a testament to their resilience, strategic execution, and the leadership of Sam Billings. With the league's growing stature, the future of ILT20 looks brighter than ever.","Dubai Capitals clinched their maiden ILT20 title in a thrilling final against Desert Vipers on Sunday.

Ravindra Jadeja credits domestic cricket for maintaining rhythm,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/england-tour-of-india-2025/ravindra-jadeja-credits-domestic-cricket-for-maintaining-rhythm/articleshow/118130854.cms,"CUTTACK: Allrounder Ravindra Jadeja , who came up with another impressive performance in the second ODI against England , believes his recent stint in domestic cricket in the Ranji Trophy helped him get into the right rhythm even for the white-ball 50-over format.Jadeja played two Ranji Trophy matches for Saurashtra before the England series but bowled in only one of them, against Delhi - 30 overs for 12 wickets across the two innings.It was the perfect way to prepare and he has continued his good form from there on, pocketing six wickets from the 19 overs he has bowled in the first two games of the England ODI series. His pivotal performance ahead of the Champions Trophy , beginning in just about a week from now, will also be a confidence booster for the entire team.Jadeja credited the short stint in domestic cricket for maintaining his rhythm despite returning to the format after long, largely due to lesser ODIs being played these days.""It feels really good, especially after almost two years - since the (ODI) World Cup . Coming back into this format requires quick adaptation, but I believe the domestic matches I played helped me a lot,"" the veteran allrounder said.""In the match (against Delhi), I bowled more than 30 overs, which helped me maintain my rhythm, so I never lost my rhythm. I'm trying to bowl Test lines and lengths in ODIs as well. What we call rhythm, continuity, was in place because my break from cricket wasn't that long. So in my view, I have benefited from the domestic match that I played,"" he added.Following the debacle in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy Down Under, the Indian cricket board ( BCCI ) issued a mandate that barring injuries or workload-management issues, top players have to turn out for their Ranji Trophy state teams whenever free from national duty.Jadeja acknowledging the benefits of the move appears to be a vindication of the board's views.","Allrounder Ravindra Jadeja believes his recent stint in domestic cricket helped him get into the right rhythm.

NEW DELHI: Australia's head coach Andrew McDonald has provided insights into the team's plans for the upcoming ODI series against Sri Lanka and the upcoming major tournaments.With the absence of key players like Mitchell Marsh, Pat Cummins, and Josh Hazlewood due to injuries, and Marcus Stoinis's retirement from ODI cricket, the team will be exploring different options and combinations.McDonald acknowledged that while winning is always the goal, the ODIs against Sri Lanka will serve as an opportunity to evaluate alternative strategies and personnel.""You want to play to win, there's no doubt about that because winning form always helps the confidence of a group. But there will definitely be some options that we look at, how we go about it - what the structure of the top three (batting) looks like without Mitch Marsh there,"" said McDonald.""And the bowling dynamic completely changes, it's almost a whole new attack so we have to work out how that functions as well.

Try and bat the way I do.""During the knock in Cuttack, Rohit also surpassed legendary Sachin Tendulkar (15,335 runs) in the list of batters with the most runs across formats as an opener. Rohit now has amassed 15,404 runs as an opener across formats, only behind Virender Sehwag 's 15,758 runs in the all-time list.""Like I said, I have been here long enough. One or two knocks are not going to change my mind. Just another day in the office. We need to do our job, okay. Our job is to just go out there and play the game. As long as you go out there and you know that today when you go to bat, you have given your best, that is what matters,"" Rohit remarked.While discussing his approach as a batter, Rohit explained: ""Every time I walk on to the pitch, walk on to play the game, I want to try and do well. Sometimes it happens, and sometimes it may not happen. As long as I am clear on what I want to do, that's all that matters, nothing else matters.""Also See: 2025 Champions Trophy ""When you have scored so many runs, you have done something right. You just need to get back to that. That mindset of how to get runs, how to score runs. Sounds really simple, but it is quite difficult. But in my mind, it was just about enjoying. That is what we play the sport for - enjoy the game more than anything else,"" Rohit concluded.Fueled by hundred from their skipper, India defeated England to take an unassailable 2-0 lead in the three-match series.

Will Rohit Sharma win another ICC trophy? Here's what the horoscope says

What does Shubman Gill's horoscope say about his captaincy future

Former cricketers Ravi Shastri and Ricky Ponting believe Pakistan will be a formidable force at the ICC Champions Trophy 2025 , citing home advantage, a potent pace attack, and key match-winners as reasons why they could excel.With Pakistan set to co-host a senior ICC event for the first time since the 1996 Cricket World Cup, the tournament carries added significance for the nation.Former India head coach Shastri emphasised the unique challenges and expectations that come with playing in subcontinental conditions but asserted that Pakistan has the squad to thrive under pressure.""There’s always pressure when you play at home in the subcontinent – whether it’s India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, or Pakistan – the expectations are massive,"" Shastri said in a conversation on The ICC Review. ""But I think Pakistan are the kind of side that, with the exposure they’ve had in the last six to eight months in white-ball cricket, have put up some really strong performances, especially in South Africa.""Shastri acknowledged the absence of young opener Saim Ayub due to injury but remains confident in Pakistan’s squad depth.""They've missed Ayub at the top, and he’s a crucial player,"" he admitted. ""But Pakistan have enough depth to be dangerous, especially in home conditions. I would say they should qualify for the semi-finals and from there, it’s anyone’s game.""He further stressed that if Pakistan reaches the knockout stages, they could prove to be one of the most dangerous teams in the competition.""Pakistan are still very, very dangerous, and if they qualify, they’ll be doubly more dangerous,"" he added.Ponting, the former Australian captain, echoed Shastri’s views, particularly highlighting Pakistan’s strong pace attack and the role of star batter Babar Azam ""I agree with Ravi. Saim Ayub is a high-quality player, and his absence is a massive gap to fill,"" Ponting told The ICC Review. ""But Pakistan’s fast bowling brigade is very, very good. Led by Shaheen Afridi and Naseem Shah, who’ve been terrific in recent series, they have the pace and skill to trouble any batting line-up.""Ponting also pointed out the importance of Babar and Mohammad Rizwan in anchoring Pakistan’s batting line-up.""Babar has been a bit up and down in recent years, but if he and Rizwan can bring their A-games, that’s when Pakistan becomes incredibly dangerous,"" he remarked.The former World Cup-winning captain also noted how playing at home could be both a challenge and a boost.""The pressure of playing at home can work both ways. It can be a real motivator, especially with the home crowd behind you. That support can sometimes help you cross the line in big moments.""Ponting concluded by reinforcing Pakistan’s potential to beat any team if they perform to their ability.""They’ve still got enough high-quality players to beat any team on any given day,"" he said. ""If they play well, they’ll be right in it.""","Pakistan set to co-host a senior ICC event for the first time since the 1996 Cricket World Cup.

Most 50+ scores for England in ODIs

56 - Joe Root

55 - Eoin Morgan

39 - Ian Bell

38 - Jos Buttler

34 - Kevin Pietersen

England's star batter Joe Root etched his name in the record books during the second ODI against India in Cuttack, surpassing former captain Eoin Morgan to register the most fifty-plus scores for England in men's ODIs.Root, who has been a pillar of consistency in England's batting lineup, played a crucial knock of 69 off 72 balls, anchoring the innings in favourable batting conditions. His composed innings, which featured six boundaries at a strike rate of 95.83, helped England post a competitive total of 304 while batting first.With this knock, Root registered his 40th ODI half-century, taking his tally of fifty-plus scores to 56, which includes 16 centuries. He had previously been tied with Morgan at 55 before claiming the record outright.England's all-time list of most fifty-plus scores in men's ODIs now sees Root on top, followed by Morgan (55), Ian Bell (39), current captain Jos Buttler (38), and Kevin Pietersen (34).Root played a vital role in steadying England's innings, forging a crucial 66-run stand with Harry Brook (31) for the third wicket. However, despite England's strong total, India chased down the target with ease, led by a stunning 119 from skipper Rohit Sharma . India's victory, achieved with 33 balls and four wickets to spare, sealed the series 2-0.While the result didn't go England's way, Root's achievement highlights his enduring importance to the team. As England continue to rebuild in ODIs, the experienced right-hander remains a vital cog in their batting line-up.","Joe Root surpasses former captain Eoin Morgan to register the most fifty-plus scores for England in men's ODIs.

NEW DELHI: former Indian cricketer Harbhajan Singh believes India would have an advantage over Pakistan in their highly awaited match in the 2025 ICC Champions Trophy since they will be accustomed to the pitches in Dubai.Speaking to ANI, Singh said, ""The hype is being created regarding the India-Pakistan match...the team that is going to adjust better with the pitch will get a better result...India has an advantage, it will play all its matches in Dubai so it will have an idea about the pitch and conditions. Overall I feel the Indian team is better than the Pakistan team and the result will be in favour of India...""The former Indian bowler further emphasized that although Jasprit Bumrah cannot be replaced, his absence gives players like Mohammed Shami and Arshdeep Singh the chance to step up and assume responsibility.""When a player like Bumrah is not playing, someone else has to step up and take responsibility. No one can truly replace Bumrah, but his absence creates an opportunity for others to showcase their abilities. Players like Arshdeep and Shami have a chance to make an impact and prove themselves,"" he added.Then, in spite of recent criticism regarding their form, Harbhajan supported Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma to demonstrate their ability to win matches at the Champions Trophy ""Virat and Rohit haven't scored as many runs as expected, given their past performances. The expectations are high, and when they fall short, criticism is natural. However, with the Champions Trophy ahead, they have a great opportunity to showcase their abilities and prove how they can still win matches for India. If they don't succeed, naturally, the young players waiting in the wings will start getting more opportunities. But I still believe both have plenty of cricket left in them--they are highly capable players who can still score runs,"" he said.","Former Indian cricketer Harbhajan Singh believes India would have an advantage over Pakistan in their highly awaited match in the 2025 ICC Champions Trophy.

'ILT20 is great for UAE cricket': Sehwag anticipates thrilling finale

Team India Squad for ICC Men's Champions Trophy 2025

NEW DELHI: Jasprit Bumrah is all set to commence his rehabilitation at the National Cricket Academy (NCA) in Bengaluru after he underwent scans and thorough assessment under the watch of Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ) medical team. It is reliably learnt that the reports were internally discussed and now the seamer is likely to start physical activity - some gym work, even light bowling - in the next 24-48 hours.The International Cricket Council (ICC) deadline to make changes to Champions Trophy provisional squad is a couple of days away - February 11 midnight Dubai time as the support period starts February 12 - and it will not be a surprise if the Indian cricket board plays the waiting game with Bumrah. They followed a similar route even when Hardik Pandya was injured during the group stages of the 2023 ODI World Cup.""Even if there is a 1% chance, the BCCI is likely to wait. They did the same with Hardik Pandya as they waited for close to two weeks before getting Prasidh Krishna as a replacement. Even when Shubman Gill was down with dengue, they didn't have any thoughts of looking for a replacement. Yes those two incidents happened during the campaign but approach with Bumrah could well be no different. This is just the deadline to submit the squad and they could approach the Event Technical Committee at a later stage to seek a replacement if he fails to regain fitness,"" says a source close to developments.India's ace seamer was asked to off-load for five weeks after the Sydney Test vs Australia where he injured himself and didn't come out to bowl in the second innings. Since then, there has been no proper update from the BCCI on the nature and extent of his injury, and suspense around his return to competitive cricket has continued.Bumrah was named in the ODI squad for ongoing series vs England but his name was missing from the squad sheet when Varun Chakaravarthy was added to the set-up. With Harshit Rana already there and Varun added to the ODI squad, the Indian team management is clearly keeping the options ready if Bumrah doesn't get the all-clear from the NCA in time for the multi-nation tournament which starts on February 19.India captain Rohit Sharma had said that Varun, who even made his debut in the 2nd ODI, is also very much in contention.“Clearly during the series it presents us an opportunity to play him at some stage and see what he is capable of. Right now we are not thinking about whether we are going to take him or not but definitely he will be in contention. If things plan out really well for us and he does what is required then definitely there is something that we need to think about,” Rohit had said during the pre-series media interaction.Rohit Sharma (c), Shubman Gill (vc), Virat Kohli, Shreyas Iyer, KL Rahul, Hardik Pandya, Axar Patel, Washington Sundar, Kuldeep Yadav, Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammed Shami, Arshdeep Singh, Yashasvi Jaiswal, Rishabh Pant and Ravindra Jadeja","Jasprit Bumrah is all set to commence his rehabilitation at the National Cricket Academy (NCA) in Bengaluru.

Poll How Important Is Domestic Cricket for a Player’s Success? Not Essential – International Experience Matters More Crucial – It Helps Players Stay Match-Ready and Improve Skills

Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel.

NEW DELHI: India all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja has attributed his recent form and consistency to his stint in domestic cricket , stating that playing for Saurashtra in the Ranji Trophy helped him stay in rhythm despite a long break from ODIs.Jadeja, who last played an ODI during the 2023 World Cup before the current series, was instrumental in India's series-clinching four-wicket victory over England in the second ODI at the Barabati Stadium in Cuttack on Sunday. His controlled bowling and crucial contributions in the middle order provided balance to the Indian side, ensuring a smooth transition back into the 50-over format.The 36-year-old returned to India's ODI setup after featuring for Saurashtra in the Ranji Trophy 2024-25. He produced a match-winning performance against Delhi, claiming 12 wickets to power Saurashtra to a dominant 10-wicket win. He also played against Assam but did not bowl in that match, focusing instead on his batting.Speaking at the post-match press conference, Jadeja emphasised the importance of domestic cricket in keeping him sharp and match-ready.""It feels really good, especially after almost two years - since the World Cup. Coming back into this format requires quick adaptation, but I believe the domestic matches I played helped me a lot,"" Jadeja said.""In those matches, I bowled over 30 overs, which helped me maintain my rhythm. Even in Tests, I tried to maintain the same line and length in ODIs. The rhythm remained intact because the break wasn’t too long. So, I think playing domestic games benefitted me in maintaining my rhythm,"" he added.Jadeja’s comments underline the significance of domestic cricket in keeping players in top form, especially ahead of major international assignments.Also See: Champions Trophy 2025",India all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja has attributed his recent form and consistency to his stint in domestic cricket.

Targeting England tour

Handling pressure

No target in mind

NEW DELHI: All-rounder Shardul Thakur maintains a positive outlook about his future in Indian cricket, despite currently being out of the reckoning in the national set-up.Shardul on Monday delivered yet another impressive performance for Mumbai in the Ranji Trophy quarterfinal against Haryana in Kolkata, bagging a six-for to secure a 14-run first-innings lead.The 33-year-old all-rounder, who was instrumental in India's 2021 England tour, has shown exceptional form in the current domestic season.In Mumbai's lineup, Thakur stands as the fifth-highest run scorer with 396 runs across nine innings at an average of 44.00. His batting achievements include one century and three half-centuries. On the bowling front, he has been equally impactful with 30 wickets at an average of 21.10.""When there's no place in the team, there's naturally disappointment. And, when you're not playing, sitting idle at home, you tend to think about it more,"" said Thakur.""But once I step onto the field, my entire focus is on the match -- whether it's club cricket, Ranji Trophy, IPL, or playing for India. To me, every cricket match is the same, regardless of the level. I always aim to give my best in whichever game I play, I don't have any other thoughts.""Thakur has played 11 Test matches for India, with his last appearance being against South Africa at Centurion in December 2023.With India set to tour England in June-July for the start of the new World Test Championship cycle, Thakur remains hopeful of making a comeback.""Yes, absolutely. I believe I'm in contention. The next step is to make my place in the team and earn selection. That's always the goal,"" he said.""Right now, I'm playing at the Ranji Trophy level. International cricket is the highest level we all strive for. It's always on my mind, it's the motivation to play for the country that drives me forward. That passion, that fire, never fades.""Thakur, who went unsold in the IPL mega auction, is open to playing county cricket to gain experience in English conditions.""If I get an offer, I'll definitely play. It would be a great new experience. Right now, there are no concrete plans, but county cricket has 6-7 matches around that time. If selected, it will help me adjust to English conditions before the (England) tour,"" he said.Cricket, with its unpredictable nature, comes with its share of highs and lows, and Thakur believes mental resilience is key to navigating them.""It affects every player differently. Personally, I don't dwell on the past. If I do, it only leads to disappointment and distracts me from the game. My focus is on what's in my hands,"" he said.""Professional cricket comes with highs and lows. Sometimes you perform, sometimes you don't. Sometimes you're in the team, sometimes you're dropped. But the real challenge is bouncing back, preparing well, and delivering when it matters. That's the fun part of it.""When I'm in the nets or alone in my room, I analyse my game and think about the next match. It's important to train the mind to stay in the present. The subconscious may still think about selection, but on the field, my only focus is contributing -- whether it's taking wickets or scoring runs.""Mumbai has a history of lower-order resilience, and Thakur believes it is a vital part of their team culture.""Mumbai cricket has always emphasised that every batter, even No. 11, must contribute. Since childhood, we've been taught that every run matters, even if it's just 2, 5, or 10,"" he said.""Historically, Mumbai's lower order has stepped up in crisis situations, and we follow that tradition. It's ingrained in our team culture, and we hope it continues in the years to come.""Thakur further said they don't have any declaration score in mind and would look to push for a bigger total.""There's no such thing as a safe total in cricket. Two full days remain. Our goal is to bat as much as possible,"" he said.""The longer we play, the more wear and tear the pitch will undergo, which will help our spinners in the fourth innings. That's why we'll look to stretch our innings tomorrow. We haven't set a specific target yet,"" he concluded.","All-rounder Shardul Thakur has shown exceptional form in the current domestic season.

NEW DELHI: Pacer Aditya Thakare secured his sixth five-wicket haul in first-class cricket while Yash Rathod scored a half-century in the second innings as Vidarbha established a substantial 297-run lead against Tamil Nadu in their Ranji Trophy quarterfinal match in Nagpur on Monday.Thakare's impressive bowling performance, including four wickets on Sunday, restricted Tamil Nadu to 225 in 64.3 overs after Vidarbha scored 353 in their first innings.Vidarbha, maintaining their unbeaten record this season, recovered from a slow start to reach 169 for 5 at stumps on day three, to take their overall lead to 297.Rathod remained unbeaten on 55, partnering with Harsh Dubey who scored 29 not out.Tamil Nadu's struggles continued as they lost captain Sai Kishore early, adding just one run to his overnight score of six. Tail-ender Sonu Yadav's responsible innings helped the team reach a respectable total before being the last wicket to fall.Vidarbha, who topped their group with six wins and one draw, faced early setbacks losing three wickets for 61 runs.Karun Nair contributed 29 runs before Rathod's unbeaten half-century, his sixth in first-class cricket, steered the team to a safer position.The 55-run partnership between Rathod and Dubey for the sixth wicket strengthened Vidarbha's position heading into day four. Given Tamil Nadu's strong batting lineup featuring Narayan Jagadeesan, Sai Sudharsan, and Vijay Shankar, Vidarbha might aim to extend their lead further.Despite a promising start, Vidarbha lost openers Atharva Taide (19), Dhruv Shorey (20), and Danish Malewar (0) in quick succession.

'Everyone played a part': Captain Rashid Khan as MI Cape Town clinch maiden SA20 title

NEW DELHI: Star batter Kane Williamson struck a magnificent century to power New Zealand into the tri-series final with a commanding six-wicket victory over South Africa in Lahore on Monday. His unbeaten 133 overshadowed debutant Matthew Breetzke ’s record-breaking 150, guiding the Black Caps to a comfortable chase at Gaddafi Stadium .The tri-series, a preparatory tournament for the upcoming eight-nation Champions Trophy — set to begin on February 19 in Pakistan and the UAE — now sees New Zealand assured of a spot in the final.The second finalist will be determined when Pakistan face South Africa on Wednesday in Karachi, with the summit clash scheduled for Friday at the same venue.Williamson, who notched his first ODI century in nearly five years, formed a match-winning 187-run partnership with opener Devon Conway , who fell agonisingly short of a century, scoring 97.The duo laid a solid foundation after Will Young (19) fell early, ensuring New Zealand remained on track despite the dismissals of Daryl Mitchell (10) and Tom Latham (0).The New Zealand skipper, exuding complete confidence, sealed the chase with a boundary in the 49th over, ensuring his side secured their second consecutive win in the tournament.Earlier in the day, South Africa’s Matthew Breetzke scripted history with a record-breaking 150 on debut, the highest by any batter in his maiden ODI. His knock surpassed the previous record of 148 set by Desmond Haynes (West Indies) in 1978 against Australia.Breetzke’s superb 148-ball innings featured 11 fours and five sixes, forming crucial partnerships — 37 runs with Temba Bavuma (20) and 93 with Jason Smith (41) — as South Africa posted a competitive 304-6.However, their bowlers struggled to contain a determined New Zealand batting unit.South Africa was forced to field four debutants due to the absence of key players, either engaged in a T20 league back home or recovering from injuries.New Zealand, on the other hand, made a crucial change — bringing in Devon Conway to replace Rachin Ravindra , who was ruled out after sustaining an injury during their 78-run victory over Pakistan on Saturday.","New Zealand beat South Africa by six wickets to reach tri-series final. Kane Williamson scored 133, his first ODI century in nearly five years. Matthew Breetzke scored 150 on debut, the highest by any batter in his maiden ODI.

Brief Scores: Saurashtra 216 and 2nd Innings 33/0 in 16 overs.

Gujarat 1st Innings 511 in 159.1 overs (Jaymeet Patel 103, Urvil Patel 140. D Jadeja 5/120, J Unadkat 1/107).

NEW DELHI: Jaymeet Patel completed a well-earned century in the morning, but it was wicketkeeper-batter Urvil Patel who dismantled hosts Saurashtra with a blistering 140, pushing Gujarat closer to the Ranji Trophy semi-finals on day three of their quarter-final in Rajkot.After dismissing Saurashtra for 216, Gujarat piled up a commanding 511 in their first innings, securing a massive 295-run lead—leaving Chintan Gaja’s team in firm control.Manan Hingrajia’s gritty 83 off 219 deliveries laid the foundation, while left-hander Jaymeet (103 off 171) ensured stability before Urvil unleashed an attacking masterclass. His 197-ball knock saw him take seasoned Saurashtra seamer Jaydev Unadkat (1/107 in 31 overs) to the cleaners.Unadkat, rarely taken apart so brutally, conceded 14 boundaries and two sixes to Urvil. The aggressive right-hander struck half of his 17 boundaries off the Saurashtra skipper while also punishing experienced spinner Dharmendra Jadeja (5/120 in 37.1 overs), smashing him for two of his four sixes.Urvil’s fearless approach eventually led to his dismissal—stumped while attempting a fifth six off Jadeja.At stumps, Saurashtra were 33 for no loss, reducing the deficit to 262, but the task ahead remains monumental.To stand a chance, Saurashtra will need to amass at least 450 runs on day four to set a defendable fourth-innings target of around 220. However, with the pitch slowing down, scoring at a brisk pace will be a challenge. Much will depend on how Chirag Jani and Harvik Desai approach the morning session.In the final hour of day three, caution prevailed as Saurashtra managed only 33 runs in 16 overs, highlighting the difficulty of their uphill battle.","Gujarat pile up a commanding 511 in their first innings, securing a massive 295-run lead.

Brief Scores:

Mumbai: 315 and 278/4 in 67 overs (Ajinkya Rahane 88 batting, Suryakumar Yadav 70, Siddhesh Lad 43, Shivam Dube 30 batting) vs Haryana 301 in 84.5 overs (Ankit Kumar 136, Yashvardhan Dalal 36; Shardul Thakur 6/58). Mumbai lead by 292 runs.

NEW DELHI: Suryakumar Yadav roared back to form with a fluent 70, forging a match-defining 129-run partnership with Ajinkya Rahane (88*), as defending champions Mumbai tightened their grip over Haryana on day three of their Ranji Trophy quarterfinal in Kolkata on Monday.Their commanding batting display, following Shardul Thakur ’s sensational six-wicket haul in the morning, propelled Mumbai to 278/4 in 67 overs at stumps, extending their lead to a formidable 292 runs.Rahane, composed and steady, remained unbeaten on 88 off 142 balls, striking 10 boundaries, while Suryakumar lit up the innings with his trademark aggressive strokeplay. The Indian T20I skipper’s 86-ball knock featured eight fours and two sixes, including audacious reverse hits and elegant drives that put Mumbai firmly in control.Earlier in the day, Mumbai’s pace spearhead Shardul Thakur (18.5-3-58-6) dismantled Haryana’s lower order, wrapping up their innings for 301 within the first hour of play. Despite a slender 14-run first-innings lead, Mumbai’s bowlers had ensured a psychological edge.Spin duo Shams Mulani and Tanush Kotian chipped in with two wickets each, complementing Shardul’s fiery spell.However, Mumbai’s second innings began on a shaky note. Openers Akash Anand (10) and Ayush Mhatre (31) fell cheaply, while Siddhesh Lad (43) failed to convert his start, falling to Jayant Yadav’s off-spin. At 116/3, Mumbai needed stability—enter Rahane and Suryakumar.Desperate for runs after a string of low scores, Suryakumar started aggressively, racing to 28 off 23 balls. He tore apart Sumit Kumar with three boundaries in quick succession—one lofted straight down the ground, another sliced past the cordon, and the third cut crisply through point.His half-century, his first 50-plus score in 14 innings across formats, was a much-needed confidence boost. Coming off a dismal T20I series against England (where he managed just 28 runs in five innings), Suryakumar was determined to turn things around. His recent struggles included a highest score of 20 in the Vijay Hazare Trophy and a mere 7 in his only Ranji Trophy appearance this season.However, just as he looked set for a big score, Suryakumar perished in the final hour, mistiming a hook off rookie pacer Anuj Thakral. The ball ballooned to mid-on, cutting short his promising innings.While Suryakumar entertained, Rahane remained the anchor. The veteran reached his third fifty of the season, his second consecutive, with a pull shot over mid-wicket off Nishant Sindhu. He followed it up with a well-timed cut behind point, further solidifying Mumbai’s dominance.As stumps were drawn, Rahane stood tall at 88*, ensuring Mumbai remained in complete control and setting up a daunting fourth-innings chase for Haryana.Mumbai had set the tone early in the morning, with Shardul striking in the very first over. Haryana’s overnight batter Rohit Sharma (22) top-edged a pull shot, sending a simple catch to Mohit Avasthi at deep fine leg.Jayant Yadav survived momentarily after successfully reviewing an LBW decision, but Shardul soon had his man. With the lower order exposed, he tightened the screws further.Anshul Kamboj misjudged an incoming delivery and was trapped LBW after a successful DRS appeal overturned the on-field decision. Shardul fittingly completed his six-wicket haul by dismissing Ajit Chahal for a golden duck, ending Haryana’s resistance.With a commanding lead and Rahane well-set, Mumbai now holds the upper hand, eyeing a strong finish to secure a semifinal berth.",Mumbai lead Haryana by 292 runs at stumps on day three of Ranji Trophy quarterfinal in Kolkata. Suryakumar Yadav (70) and Ajinkya Rahane (88) put on 129-run partnership for second wicket.

Ireland 260 and 298 v Zimbabwe 267 and 228 (W. Madhevere 84, B. Bennett 45; M. Humphreys 6-57)

NEW DELHI: Spinner Matthew Humphreys delivered another stellar performance, adding two more wickets to his four earlier in the innings as Ireland sealed a 63-run victory over Zimbabwe in their one-off Test at Queens Sports Club in Bulawayo on Monday.After winning the toss, Ireland posted 260 and 298, while Zimbabwe replied with 267 and 228. Wessly Madhevere ’s attacking 84 was the standout effort for the hosts in their second innings.This win marked Ireland’s second consecutive Test triumph over Zimbabwe, following their four-wicket victory in Belfast last July.""Humphreys was superb, and (Andy) McBrine too. Our bowlers worked hard, taking wickets at key moments,"" said Ireland captain Andy Balbirnie . ""We love Test cricket as a team. Our guys have grown up playing one-day and T20 cricket, but they prepared well for this match.""Zimbabwe skipper Johnathan Campbell acknowledged his team's struggles with the bat: ""Our bowlers impressed throughout, but we flopped with the bat. There were good individual performances, but we lacked overall cohesion. Wessly had a fighting knock, and debutant Nick (Welch) did well. There is exciting talent in Zimbabwe, and we are not far off.""Set 292 for victory, Zimbabwe's hopes were dashed by Humphreys, who finished with figures of 6-57 across three days. He dismissed first-innings centurion Welch (5) on Saturday before removing Brian Bennett (45) and Campbell (33) on Sunday.On Monday, he trapped tail-ender Newman Nyamhuri (8) leg before and then bowled Madhevere, who had added 23 runs to his overnight 61. A quick delivery with the second new ball zipped past Madhevere’s outside edge, crashing into the stumps.McBrine, atoning for earlier missed catches, took the final wicket by clean-bowling Richard Ngarava (14), sealing the win for Ireland.McBrine, whose vital 90 in the first innings rescued Ireland from 31-5, was named Player of the Match.Both teams now head to Harare for three one-day internationals starting Friday, followed by a three-match T20 series.",Ireland beat Zimbabwe by 63 runs in their one-off Test at Queens Sports Club in Bulawayo.

NEW DELHI: Liverpool 's quadruple bid for the season came to a stunning end as they suffered a 1-0 defeat against Championship strugglers Plymouth Argyle in the FA Cup on Sunday.Having fielded a weakened side, Liverpool manager Arne Slot saw his decision backfiring, with Ryan Hardie 's second-half penalty sealing Plymouth's epic upset at Home Park.In another high-profile clash, Aston Villa inflicted a 2-1 defeat on Tottenham Hotspur , piling further pressure on manager Ange Postecoglou .Villa took an early lead through Jacob Ramsey's goal, and Morgan Rogers doubled their advantage midway through the second half. Mathys Tel scored a late consolation for Spurs, but it was too little, too late.The 2-1 loss in the fourth round came on the back of an exit from the English League Cup semifinals after a 4-0 second-leg humbling at Liverpool on Thursday.Plymouth's victory over Liverpool is considered one of the greatest giant-killings in FA Cup history.The Argyle, managed by Miron Muslic, a former refugee from war-torn Bosnia, had already beaten Premier League side Brentford in the previous round and secured their first league win since November against West Brom.Slot acknowledged Liverpool's underwhelming performance, stating, ""We were not having a very good day. A result like this is the outcome."" Muslic, on the other hand, expressed his delight, calling it a ""magical day"" for Plymouth.Elsewhere, Wolves cruised into the fifth round with a 2-0 win over Blackburn Rovers, courtesy of goals from Joao Gomes and Matheus Cunha within 39 seconds of each other.The FA Cup exits for Liverpool and Tottenham have ended their hopes of achieving a quadruple and winning silverware this season, respectively.

Liverpool suffered a humiliating FA Cup exit as Championship strugglers Plymouth ended their quadruple hopes with a stunning 1-0 victory in the fourth round on Sunday.Arne Slot ’s decision to field a weakened team backfired spectacularly, with Ryan Hardie’s second-half penalty securing Plymouth’s memorable triumph at Home Park.Slot made 10 changes from the side that dominated Tottenham 4-0 in the League Cup semi-final second leg, resting key players like Virgil van Dijk Mohamed Salah , Andrew Robertson, and Cody Gakpo. However, the gamble proved costly, marking a rare misstep in an otherwise stellar debut season for the former Feyenoord boss.Liverpool’s fourth defeat across all competitions this season also represented only the third time they had failed to score under Slot. More significantly, it was just the fourth instance of a Premier League leader being knocked out of the FA Cup by a lower-division club.The Reds must now regroup quickly ahead of the Merseyside derby against Everton at Goodison Park on Wednesday. A victory there would extend their lead over second-placed Arsenal to nine points in the title race. Meanwhile, they remain contenders in the Champions League last 16 and will face Newcastle in the League Cup final in March.Plymouth manager Miron Muslic masterminded one of the FA Cup’s greatest giant-killings while battling to lift his team from the bottom of the Championship. Muslic, a refugee from war-torn Bosnia, moved to Austria at the age of nine after fleeing his besieged hometown of Bihac in 1992.Having already eliminated Premier League side Brentford in the third round, Plymouth entered the match buoyed by their first league victory since November, a 3-2 win over West Brom. Their determined display against Liverpool will go down in FA Cup history.Playing under a wintry sun on the Devon coast, Liverpool’s under-strength squad suffered an early blow when Joe Gomez limped off injured in the first half. The Reds struggled to generate attacking momentum, with Plymouth’s relentless energy frustrating their efforts.James McConnell’s long-range strike in the 36th minute forced a save from Conor Hazard, but Liverpool otherwise lacked cutting edge.The breakthrough came in the 54th minute when Darko Gyabi’s overhead kick struck Harvey Elliott’s raised arm, leading to a clear penalty. Hardie calmly sent Caoimhin Kelleher the wrong way to put Plymouth ahead.Late pressure from Liverpool saw Diogo Jota and Darwin Nunez denied by superb saves from Hazard, as Home Park erupted in celebration at the final whistle.Elsewhere in the FA Cup, Wolves secured a 2-0 win at Blackburn, scoring twice in 39 seconds. Joao Gomes’ shot slipped past Balazs Toth in the 33rd minute, before Matheus Cunha’s blistering strike doubled the lead moments later.Struggling just two points above the Premier League relegation zone, Wolves welcomed the distraction of cup success as they advanced to the fifth round.Meanwhile, Tottenham boss Ange Postecoglou faces mounting pressure ahead of their clash against Aston Villa. Having previously claimed he always wins a trophy in his second season, the Australian manager is running out of opportunities to keep that promise if Spurs exit the FA Cup.",Plymouth beat Liverpool 1-0 in the fourth round of the FA Cup.

NEW DELHI: Kylian Mbappe 's timely strike secured a hard-fought 1-1 draw for Real Madrid against their fierce rivals Atletico Madrid in a tense La Liga encounter on Saturday.The result maintained Los Blancos' slender one-point lead over Atletico at the top of the table, while also keeping Barcelona within striking distance in third place.The match was a closely contested affair, with both sides displaying their defensive resilience and intensity. Atletico drew first blood in the first half through Julian Alvarez 's controversial penalty, which was awarded after a VAR review for a clumsy challenge by Aurelien Tchouameni on Samuel Lino.Alvarez coolly converted the spot-kick with a cheeky Panenka, much to the frustration of the Real Madrid faithful, who vented their anger towards the officials.However, Real Madrid responded swiftly in the second half, with Mbappe pouncing on a rebound from Jude Bellingham 's blocked shot to level the scores. The French striker's goal on his debut in the heated derby clash underlined his importance to the team and his ability to deliver in crucial moments.The second half saw Real Madrid take control of the proceedings, with Bellingham twice coming agonizingly close to putting his side ahead. The England international's headed efforts were denied by the woodwork and a fine save from Atletico goalkeeper Jan Oblak, who also produced crucial stops to deny Vinicius Junior, Rodrygo, and Mbappe.Despite their dominance, Real Madrid could not find the elusive winner, leaving both teams to settle for a share of the spoils. The result left Carlo Ancelotti 's side clinging to their narrow lead at the summit, while Atletico will rue their inability to capitalize on their first-half advantage.In his post-match comments, Ancelotti acknowledged his team's disappointment at not securing all three points but expressed satisfaction with their continued leadership of the league.""The team is disappointed because they think they deserved more... but we're happy because we're still leaders,"" Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti told reporters. ""In the second half we had total control, we had a lot of chances.""Atletico coach Diego Simeone , on the other hand, lamented his side's lack of composure in front of goal, particularly in the first half.""We had a good first half, but we weren't relaxed enough in front of goal to (score) more,"" said Simeone. ""In the end it was a draw in which both teams think they could have taken more from it.""The hard-fought draw sets the stage for an intriguing midweek clash, as Real Madrid prepare to face Pep Guardiola's Manchester City in the first leg of the Champions League play-off round.Meanwhile, the La Liga title race remains delicately poised, with Barcelona given an opportunity to close the gap on the top two when they face Sevilla on Sunday.",Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid draw 1-1 in La Liga derby on Saturday.

SHILLONG: Football frenzy was at its peak as the city welcomed Indian Super League and hoped to see NorthEast United FC script a memorable win and star striker Alaaeddine Ajaraie break the league’s goalscoring record at the revamped Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium here on Friday.But while there was no dearth in their support – with a Alaaeddine fan getting into the ground and hugging his hero in the 62nd minute – Juan Pedro Benali’s men could not live up to the expectation as Mumbai City FC won 2-0 with goals from two former NEUFC players – Bipin Singh (41’) and Lallianzuala Chhangte (90+2’).The victory meant that the visitors leapfrogged both NEUFC and Bengaluru FC to go fourth with 31 points from 19 games while the hosts went a rung down to fifth with 29 points from 20 matches.With the fervent northeastern fans behind them, NEUFC started the game with gusto despite the celsius scale tipping to 10 degrees in what might be the coldest ISL fixture this season.It was the hosts, looking to make a winning start in their ‘second home’, who kept pushing ahead and creating moves to break the Mumbai City defence. Jithin MS and Nestor Albiach looked menacing on the left wing as they tried feeding the ball to Alaaeddine in the middle.The cheers of “Alaaeddine, Alaaeddine” around the revamped and upgraded venue appeared to have done the trick in the 8th minute when a Macarton cross reached the Moroccan in the box. However, to the disbelief of the fans, his header went just over the bar.But the constant attacks by NEUFC did not ebb as Petr Kratky’s men maintained a very deep line of defence, led by the in-form Mehtab Singh in the centre. And while NEUFC kept bombarding with attacks, Alaaeddine and Co. were unable to find a breakthrough in the final third.It was against the run of play and from a half chance that the visitors eventually broke the deadlock in the 41st minute.Bipin delayed his run to meet a Fernandez cross inside the box from the right and headed the ball in that dropped before Gurmeet Singh but still ricocheted into the goal for the Mumbai City breakthrough and brought the till-then cheers from the stands to complete silence.Benali’s men tried to regroup fast and restarted their quest to break the Mumbai City defence. But nothing seemed to be working for them as the first half ended with the visitors in the lead.Soon after the change of ends, NEUFC got a free-kick in a dangerous spot outside the box. But Nestor’s shot was easily punched out by Mumbai custodian Purba Lachenpa in the 49th minute. Incessant moves by NEUFC in the Mumbai half, only to find them curtailed by the visitors’ final line of defence continued to be the script for most of the remaining time.The match, which saw seven yellow cards being shown by the referee, was starting to get ill-tempered when it was taken beyond the hosts’ grip by none other than northeast’s very own Chhangte.Getting at the end of a long cross from the Mumbai box by Tiri, skipper Chhangte put his skills on display to beat the NEUFC defenders and send a shot that Gurmeet got a touch to but could not stop from rolling into the goal.",Mumbai City FC won 2-0 with goals from Bipin Singh (41’) and Lallianzuala Chhangte (90+2’).

PANAJI: The Derbi Madrileno or Madrid Derby holds plenty of promise. A depleted Real Madrid and a fired up Atletico Madrid are separated by just a point after 22 matches at the top of the Liga table.When the teams met earlier in the season, it ended 1-1, a feisty game that saw Atletico grab a stoppage time equaliser. The return leg could be a potentially season-defining clash at the Santiago Bernabeu on Saturday, even though Real Madrid are handicapped with several absentees, particularly in defence. Carlo Ancelotti ’s Real are now without Antonio Rudiger and David Alaba, who joined the sick bay alongside right-back Dani Carvajal, regular centre-back Eder Militao and midfielder Eduardo Camavinga.Even a makeshift defence will not dampen Madrid’s enthusiasm at home, feels Diego Forlan, the former Uruguay striker who spent five years at crosstown rivals Atletico (2007-2011) and won the Golden Boot in 2009, during which he scored 32 goals.""I don't think there's any advantage (for Atletico) because of the injuries,"" Forlan told TOI during a global media interaction, arranged by La Liga earlier this week. ""Real Madrid have a deep squad with so much quality. Many important players will be missing, but with a squad that Madrid possess, they are still at the top of the table. Even though they don't have the regular starting XI, I'm sure it's a team that you have to respect, because they will have others (who can dominate).""Forlan scored over 300 goals in a storied career that won him the Golden Ball for the best player at the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa. At the club level, the Uruguayan striker won the Pichichi Trophy — the award for the top goalscorer in a La Liga season — at both Atletico and Villareal. Yet, when it came to the Madrid Derby, Forlan didn't taste similar success.In his four seasons at Atletico between 2007 and 2011, Forlan played eight Madrid derbies that resulted in seven losses and one draw. The lack of success wasn't Forlan's fault; between 1999 and 2013, Atletico didn't win in 25 meetings with Madrid, until the arrival of Diego Simeone eventually changed their fortunes. ""Well, we were close to winning against Real Madrid on several occasions but lost or drew. That trend has now changed. So, whether you're playing at home or away, I think the Derby is a lot more equal today. They are now playing on more equal footing,"" said Forlan.It is Simeone's arrival at Atletico that has helped restore the balance. In the 41 derbies played since then, Atletico have won 12, drawing 14 and losing 15. Madrid, though, continue to be the giants, so does Atletico have anything to prove to their city rivals or the world?""There's nothing to prove, you know, for a side that has been great for the last 10 years, winning lots of trophies (even) at the European level. They've made it to the final of the UEFA Champions League (losing to Madrid). This is an important derby, like El Clasico. Atletico and Madrid have always had great players, the derbies were spectacular. Today, the stakes are a lot higher since it's being watched all over the world,"" said Forlan.While Madrid are struggling at the back, their attacking players are fit and firing. There's Kylian Mbappe – playing his first derby after missing the first leg -- Rodrygo and Vinicius, all striking form. At the other end, there's Julian Alvarez, Antonio Griezmann and, of course, Simeone's son Giuliano, ""a real fighter with similar characteristics (like his father), one of the best signings.""",Diego Forlan feels the Derbi Madrileno is now similar to El Clasico.

NEW DELHI: Manchester United 's FA Cup defence remained alive as they staged a remarkable comeback to defeat Leicester City 2-1 on Friday night at Old Trafford.The match witnessed a fairytale return for former United striker Ruud van Nistelrooy , who was in the opposition dugout as Leicester's interim manager.The first half was a frustrating affair for the home side, as they struggled to create meaningful chances.Leicester took the lead in the 42nd minute through Bobby De Cordova-Reid, who nodded home from close range after Wilfred Ndidi 's initial effort was saved by Andre Onana.United's manager, Ruben Amorim , recognised the need for a change and introduced Alejandro Garnacho at halftime, a move that proved to be a game-changer. The young Argentine winger injected pace and directness into United's attack, causing problems for the Leicester defence.The equaliser arrived midway through the second half when fellow substitute Joshua Zirkzee tapped in from close range after Rasmus Hojlund's flick from Garnacho's cross was blocked.With the momentum firmly in their favour, United pushed for a winner, and it came deep into stoppage time. Harry Maguire rose highest to head home a Bruno Fernandes free-kick, sparking wild celebrations at Old Trafford.While the goal appeared to be offside, the lack of VAR in the FA Cup meant the decision stood, and United secured a hard-fought victory.The match held added significance for Ruud van Nistelrooy, who had enjoyed a brief spell as United's interim manager earlier in the season following the sacking of Erik ten Hag.During his tenure, United had scored eight goals in two games against Leicester, but this time, the Dutchman was on the receiving end of a United comeback.For United, the win provided a much-needed boost after a recent run of poor form at home, where they had suffered five defeats in their previous seven matches across all competitions.The absence of key players like Lisandro Martinez, who sustained a cruciate ligament injury against Crystal Palace, and the January departures of Marcus Rashford and Antony, had left United light in attacking options.However, the introduction of Garnacho and Zirkzee's impact highlighted the depth in United's squad.As the FA Cup defence continues, United will take confidence from their ability to grind out a result against a determined Leicester side. The comeback victory not only kept their hopes of silverware alive but also provided a timely reminder of the resilience and fighting spirit that has been a hallmark of successful United teams throughout their illustrious history.","Manchester United staged a remarkable comeback to defeat Leicester City 2-1 on Friday night at Old Trafford.

The Normalisation Committee has also been at odds with the state-run Pakistan Sports Board, further delaying the constitutional amendments.Earlier this week, PFF Normalisation Committee chairman Haroon Malik cautioned a parliamentary panel that his tenure would end on February 15 and that Pakistan risked suspension if the amendments were not implemented. He clarified that making these amendments did not mean he would be a candidate in the upcoming PFF elections.Malik also revealed that the PFF Congress was unwilling to comply with FIFA’s directives, resulting in the ongoing standoff.This marks the third time Pakistan's football federation has been suspended since 2017.",FIFA has suspended the Pakistan Football Federation.

Jannik Sinner’s success has a lot to do with coach Cahill: Amritraj,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/jannik-sinners-success-has-a-lot-to-do-with-coach-cahill-amritraj/articleshow/118122407.cms,"Vijay Amritraj

CHENNAI: Italy’s Jannik Sinner appears to be by far the most in-form men’s tennis player on the world circuit. Despite facing doping allegations, the world No. 1 did not let that affect him as he asserted his authority by winning the US Open and Australian Open.Indian legend Vijay Amritraj credited coach Darren Cahill for Sinner’s success. “The one major factor in Sinner’s game has been Cahill. I always knew that Darren had a very strong mental approach, and his ability to impart that to you and help you reach a point where you believe in yourself, where there is no second place for me – only first – has been crucial. And when I see Sinner play, I see a lot of that in him,” Vijay, who introduced Cahill to television, said on the sidelines of the Chennai Open Challenger. Novak Djokovic ’s decision to join forces with coach Andy Murray took Vijay by surprise. Djokovic and his former rival Murray began their partnership at the Australian Open, and the 37-year-old had a decent start to the season, reaching the semifinals.“I am surprised by Andy’s decision because he has just finished his tennis career, and to jump into something like this... you know, he has a family and would probably want to stay home. But he loves the game so much. I think they are a good match, and Andy can rejuvenate Djokovic to perform better.“Also, Djokovic’s match against (Carlos) Alcaraz was unbelievable – one of the best matches we have seen in a long time. Alcaraz is marginally more inconsistent mentally. He has more to offer in terms of his game,” Vijay added.The former Davis Cup finalist was vocal about the US Open’s move to add an extra day to the competition. He also stressed that the ATP reducing the number of 250-level Tour events is not a good sign. “By adding a day, they have killed the ATP 250 tournament the week before. The Slams are very important but let us not forget that you need tournaments in every part of the world. To become a Djokovic, (Roger) Federer, or (Rafael) Nadal, you still need other players to beat, right? These five or six guys alone cannot go and play the Grand Slams. You need another 100 players in the draw. So, I do not understand why they do not allow others to host tournaments.”'Trying to bring a big tournament to India'India lost its right to host an ATP 250 event a few years ago. In 2022, the country hosted a WTA 250 Tour event, but it has not been a permanent fixture on the calendar. Vijay has been pushing to host a top-level event in India but to no avail. “If you want to be a global sport, you need to have an event in India. When I was playing in the 70s and 80s, we had tournaments across all capitals in Asia. And you are saying none of this is possible? I am being very vocal with these guys about doing this,” said Vijay, who is the president of the Tamil Nadu Tennis Association (TNTA).",Vijay Amritraj credits coach Darren Cahill for Italy's Jannik Sinner's success.

Chennai: Soon after winning the Chennai Open Challenger men’s singles title on Sunday, Kyrian Jacquet humbly stated that he had not played his best tennis over the week. However, during the Frenchman’s journey to the crown, he defeated two seeded players and dropped just a single set.The 23-year-old Jacquet’s level was enough to comfortably beat Elias Ymer of Sweden 7-6(1), 6-4 in the final, a result that handed him the coveted title and 100 ranking points.At the SDAT Stadium , Jacquet made an early breakthrough, taking a 4-2 lead in the opening set. However, Ymer refused to back down, breaking Jacquet’s serve in the eighth game and pushing the set into a tie-breaker. But the tie-breaker was a one-sided affair, with the Swede making six unforced errors and leaving Jacquet with little to do.In the second set, Ymer’s unforced errors continued to give Jacquet an advantage and soon, the former was trailing 1-4. Though Ymer fought back, winning three games in a row, he faltered in the end. Inconsistency crept in, and errors began to pile up. Jacquet, maintaining his composure, comfortably cruised to victory with a double fault from Ymer sealing the win.Jacquet operated with the strategy of using his slices effectively, taking pace off the ball. By doing so, he disrupted Ymer’s rhythm, forcing him to generate more pace on his shots. “I played a lot of slices during all the matches because I like to play slices to change the rhythm. I try to destabilise the opponent. So yeah, I did well today (Sunday),” Jacquet said.Jacquet had previously mentioned that he believes his tennis is better than what his current ranking reflects. Last year, a string of injuries forced him to be sidelined for eight months, which led to a drop in his ranking. His performance in Chennai showed that he is on the comeback trail, proving his potential. “I play better than my rank, that is for sure. It was very tough last year, and I did all the work that I could to be ready to come here. I am really happy about the week because I was feeling better and better as the days went by. If I continue to play like this, I will go up faster (in the rankings).”Jacquet will jump above 60 places and get close to the top-200 mark in the ATP singles chart.","Kyrian Jacquet beat Elias Ymer of Sweden 7-6(1), 6-4 in the final.

Even though she was able to get one back, the lead was too much as the fifth seed took the opening set.The Thai's forehand often let her down in the 1 hour, 37 minute encounter, and three errors in succession gave Teichmann an early break in set two. Though the eighth seed was able to break back immediately, the inconsistency in her game proved detrimental to her chances, as the Swiss grabbed the advantage once again.Sawangkaew did manage to draw level in the sixth game, but Teichmann banked on her lethal forehand, producing two timely winners to earn the decisive break in the seventh game.Her booming serve down the T has been another formidable weapon this week, and she landed one perfectly to bring up three match points. Sawangkaew saved the first but a deft backhand volley from Teichmann was a fitting way for the Swiss to complete the win, and take home $15,500.In the doubles final, Prarthana Thombare and Arianne Hartono endured heartbreak for the second year in a row, as the Indian-Dutch pairing went down 7-6(4), 2-6, 10-7 to the all-Russian combination of Amina Anshba and Elena Pridankina.","Jil Teichmann beats Mananchaya Sawangkaew 6-3, 6-4 in the L&T Mumbai Open final.

The Australian, ranked No. 8, responded with a love break in the seventh game, leveling the set at 4-4.However, an ill-advised drop shot at 0-30 gifted Alcaraz another chance, and a powerful backhand pass set up the opportunity to serve out the set. The Spaniard capitalized, closing it out as De Minaur netted a forehand return.Momentum shifted in the second set, with De Minaur breaking early and surging to a 3-0 lead. He missed two chances for a double break but held on to even the match at one set apiece, sealing it as Alcaraz faltered with errant groundstrokes.The decider remained on serve until the sixth game when Alcaraz broke with a deft drop shot that De Minaur pushed wide. Serving at 2-5 to stay in the match, the Australian handed Alcaraz two championship points with a costly double fault.A weary backhand into the net sealed the Spaniard’s victory—his 17th ATP title — prompting a triumphant “Vamos!” as the Rotterdam crowd erupted.For De Minaur, it was a painful repeat of last year’s final, where he also finished runner-up, that time to Jannik Sinner.","Carlos Alcaraz claims his first indoor title at the Rotterdam Open on Sunday.

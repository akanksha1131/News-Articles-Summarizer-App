Shubman Gill press conference: Breaks silence on T20 World Cup snub, and more on his future

NEW DELHI: Wherever Virat Kohli goes, a sea of fans is never far behind. From selfies and autographs to a simple greeting, such scenes have become routine whenever the former India captain is around. That familiar frenzy was on display once again in Vadodara as Kohli prepared for the upcoming three-match ODI series against New Zealand, starting January 11.The 37-year-old has been leaving nothing to chance in his build-up, spending long hours in the nets as he looks to extend his impressive run in the 50-over format.Kohli’s recent ODI numbers underline his rhythm and hunger. In his last four appearances for India, he has struck two centuries and two fifties, and the upcoming series against the Blackcaps offers another opportunity to maintain that momentum.Amid the intense training sessions, Kohli found time for a lighter, heartwarming moment that quickly caught the attention of fans online.During a brief break, he interacted with supporters and signed autographs when a young fan stood out for his uncanny resemblance to a young Kohli. Photos of the two soon made the rounds on social media, triggering a wave of amused reactions.One fan remarked, “19-20 ka bhi farak nahi hai,” pointing out how little difference there was between the two.Others chimed in with comments like “Really looking like same to same,” while some simply dubbed the youngster “Mini VK.”Another user humorously wrote, “Very funny, King Kohli. Same to same copy.”On the cricketing front, Kohli has stayed busy even outside international duty. Following the ODIs against South Africa, he turned out for Delhi in the Vijay Hazare Trophy, scoring a century and a half-century in two matches before missing the game against Railways. Despite questions surrounding his future after retiring from Tests, Kohli answered critics emphatically, bouncing back with big scores after early setbacks against Australia.Alongside Rohit Sharma , Kohli also stitched together two double-century partnerships recently, one each against Australia and South Africa. The duo will aim to carry that form into the New Zealand series, with matches scheduled in Vadodara, Rajkot and Indore.","Virat Kohli was in Vadodara to prepare for the ODI series against New Zealand.

Shubman Gill press conference: Breaks silence on T20 World Cup snub, and more on his future

VADODARA: In a big setback to him and Team India, India's wicketkeeper-batter Rishabh Pant was on Saturday ruled out of the ODI series against New Zealand, which begins here on Sunday.Pant sustained a side strain after being hit just above his waist, on the ribs, from one of the deliveries bowled by a throwdown specialist late in his long batting session here. The 28-year-old was attended by the support staff members, including head coach Gautam Gambhir , and left the BCA B ground after receiving treatment, grimacing in pain.""He has been diagnosed with a right-sided strain with internal oblique muscle tear, and has thus been ruled out of the forthcoming ODI series against New Zealand,"" a reliable source told TOI. While KL Rahul is the regular wicketkeeper in India's ODI side, the selectors will soon announce a replacement for Pant.Pant last played an ODI for India against Sri Lanka in July 2024. He was part of the squad that won the Champions Trophy in 2025, but did not feature in a single match. The left-hander led Delhi in the 2025-26 Vijay Hazare Trophy recently and made two half-centuries against Services and Railways, respectively. He made his comeback after recovering from a toe fracture he sustained in the fourth Test against England at Manchester, during the two-Test series against South Africa at home.","India's wicketkeeper-batter Rishabh Pant ruled out of the ODI series against New Zealand.

Shubman Gill press conference: Breaks silence on T20 World Cup snub, and more on his future

NEW DELHI: Mumbai Indians made light work of Delhi Capitals on Saturday as they put in a complete team performance to register a comfortable 50-run win in the Women’s Premier League. After doing well with the bat, MI’s bowlers stepped up and ensured there were no late scares.Batting first, Mumbai Indians were powered by brilliant unbeaten half-centuries from Nat Sciver-Brunt and captain Harmanpreet Kaur . Sciver-Brunt scored 70 off 46 balls. On the other hand, Harmanpreet smashed an unbeaten 74 from just 42 deliveries.The experienced duo guided MI to a strong total of 195 for 4, bouncing back after a narrow loss to Royal Challengers Bengaluru the previous day.Mumbai had a shaky start when Amelia Kerr was dismissed on the very first ball. Kerr’s poor run with the bat continued as she edged a wide delivery soon after. However, Sciver-Brunt took control immediately and steadied the innings.She played with great confidence, finding the gaps regularly and punishing loose balls. Her 49-run stand with opener Gunalan Kamalini helped MI regain momentum.Kamalini played her part before falling to a smart delivery from young pacer Nandani Sharma. From there on, Sciver-Brunt and Harmanpreet took charge.The pair added 66 runs for the third wicket, forming the backbone of Mumbai’s innings.Sciver-Brunt reached her half-century in just 32 balls, striking 13 boundaries in total. Harmanpreet, equally aggressive, hit eight fours and three sixes, taking over the scoring once Sciver-Brunt was dismissed.Chasing 196, Delhi Capitals never really got going. Nicola Carey delivered the decisive blows in the middle overs. She removed dangerous batters Shafali Verma and Laura Wolvaardt in the same over, reducing DC to 33 for 3.The situation worsened quickly as Delhi slumped to 46 for 5 inside seven overs.Though Chinelle Henry fought back with a spirited 56 off 33 balls, the target was always out of reach. Nat Sciver-Brunt also made an impact with the ball, picking up two wickets, while Amelia Kerr redeemed herself by taking 3 for 24.Led by India's World Cup hero Jemimah Rodrigues for the first time, Delhi were eventually bowled out for 145 in 19 overs, as Mumbai Indians returned to winning ways with a dominant all-round display.","Mumbai Indians beat Delhi Capitals by 50 runs in the Women's Premier League.

Brief Scores

Pretoria Capitals:

Paarl Royals:

In searing Paarl heat and on a pitch that offered little for stroke-play, Pretoria Capitals produced a disciplined all-round performance to outlast Paarl Royals by 21 runs and move to third on the SA20 points table.Asked to bat first, the Capitals were kept in check throughout by the Royals’ bowling attack. Early wickets meant there was no real momentum at the top, with only Shai Hope (22 off 21) showing any early fluency. It was left to Sherfane Rutherford to anchor the innings, the left-hander once again showing his value to the Capitals in difficult conditions.Rutherford paced his knock astutely, absorbing pressure through the middle overs before launching a late assault. Two towering sixes off Hardus Viljoen in the final over lifted the Capitals to 138/9, Rutherford finishing unbeaten on 42 off 35 balls in an innings that was far more significant than it looked on paper.The Royals’ chase never quite found its footing. Lungi Ngidi struck with the second ball of the innings to remove Lhuan-dre Pretorius, and the pressure continued to build as Keshav Maharaj and Gideon Peters tightened the screws in the middle overs.Rubin Hermann fought hard with 35 off 37, but his dismissal left the Royals needing too much with too little time. David Miller tried to produce one of his trademark finishes, cracking a trio of sixes to briefly revive hope, but he lacked support at the other end. Lizaad Williams held his nerve at the death, removing Miller for 45 and sealing the contest.With the Royals restricted to 117/6, the Capitals completed a superb defensive effort that underlined their growing momentum in the tournament.138 for 9 in 20 overs (Sherfane Rutherford 42 not out; Sikandar Raza 2/13)117 for 6 in 20 overs (David Miller 45; Keshav Maharaj 2/14)",Pretoria Capitals beat Paarl Royals by 21 runs. Sherfane Rutherford scored 42 not out for the Capitals. David Miller scored 45 for the Royals. The result sees Pretoria Capitals move to third in the SA20 points table.

Excerpts:

This season has been very unlike in the past in terms of rain interruptions. Has that been a challenge?



SA20 League Commissioner Graeme Smith during an event ahead of Season 4 of SA20, South Africa's premier T20 franchise league, in Mumbai.

As a League Commissioner and administrator, what markers do you look at to evaluate success.



Do you think the SA20 now needs more teams from next season?

How much impact does SA20 have on the social critical scenario of South Africa as a community builder?



Do you see SA20 has come to a stage where it is changing the lives of cricketers who are coming from backgrounds where they did not have money to play cricket. Now they are in, you know, SA20 playing. Say someone like Mokoena who was spotted.

With regards to the investors and the IPL team owners here in SA20, you reckon it was very important to have patience from them because they are coming from a big, giant league?

One of the most important success factors of the new franchise leagues is the presence of superstars from other countries. In the last four years, has the SA20 developed as a viable alternative for the global players?



Sourav Ganguly is head coach of Pretoria Capitals this season. How has it been having him around?

Keeping the game and the league clean. Has that been a big area of attention?



Poll What do you think is the most significant factor in the commercial success of the SA20 league this season? Increased ticket sales High quality of cricket Support from IPL franchises Strong viewership growth

Do you see on the horizon where an exhibition match or two, three matches, like women's SA20 getting started some way?



: SA20 is in the middle of its fourth edition and the league commercially is having its best edition till date. The stadiums are full, investors are happy and the league is growing from strength to strength with every match. With hundreds, hat-tricks, Super Over and tight contests, quality of cricket has been right up there and League Commissioner Graeme Smith is very happy to see the progress. In an interaction on the sidelines of a fixture in Durban, the former South Africa captain opens up on the commercial success, support of IPL franchises, role of Cricket South Africa and more.I think firstly, we've seen growth in the first two weeks. Viewership, crowd attendance, atmosphere, and cricket has been good. So I think that was really exciting. Unfortunately, you can't always predict these things, and when these unseasonal types of fronts come through certain parts of South Africa, it's a challenge, especially when you've got a game a day and you're moving around the country. But I think right now we've just got to stay positive. There's a lot of cricket still left to be played. We're only halfway really in the season.And the tension and the atmosphere, and I can just feel in the mind of people that are talking, wanting to come to games.Even one or two washed out games, watching how the crowds haven't left, it shows you that the product I think has really stepped up another level this year.I don't know if I like the word administrator, but, you know, I mean, obviously we're always following metrics. I think for us, ticketing is a big one. So we've seen a big increase in ticketing. I think we've four more sold-out games already than we were at the same point last year. Over 27 or 28% increase in ticketing in the first half of the season. Viewership is up in India, viewership is up here.Digital growth is up. The other metrics that's important for me is always got to be the cricket. The pitches have been slightly better on a consistent level than they were last year. We've seen closer games, super overs, hundreds, hat-tricks, and, a number of last over finishes. For me the quality of cricket has been excellent this year. I'm hoping that over the next two weeks we'll really see the same or even get better.I don't know if it requires it. The decision's got to be that it's got to add value. Outside IPL, we've seen other leagues get bigger and struggle, over longer periods. We also work very closely with Cricket South Africa on the future tours programmes and making sure that there's enough international cricket happening around the SA20. There's definitely interest in being a part of the league.That's not the issue. The issue is just what is right for the league going forward and when is the right time to add more teams. After the 27 World Cup, you know, the FTP, then it's a little bit easier to work with. There's more, space to work and manoeuvre if you want to grow the number of games, extend the league by another 20 games. You need another two, three weeks or whatever it is. I think post 2027 27, in the new cycle, we'll work with Cricket South Africa and see what's the best way forward.Look, that's always the case. There's always, in the southern hemisphere, a lot of cricket on the go. Just look at India now. Women's Premier League starts and there's an Indian vs New Zealand series. We've been up against the Ashes and all that sort of stuff. I think the one thing about being here since the beginning is we've always built that way.We've never had a clean window. We've always had to build up against ILT20 or against, a busy southern hemisphere. And I think we've proven to be successful in that climate. You know, so our brains don't work like that. Our brains are focused on, like, developing the best product. Making sure that people enjoy it, that cricket's competitive, that the fans are filling the stadiums and having a great time.And hopefully we get some great sunshine in the next two weeks to really help with that momentum. I think the game every day and close games, we see, when we have two or three good games close together, how you can feel the tension shift and change. And, hopefully we'll get that run of games now.Well, I mean, we have obviously our social partners like Laureus where we're investing in communities. I think the most important thing is that we're also delivering money back to Cricket South Africa, which flows into growing the game. We, as SA20, have invested in our own development programmes as well. So we have SA20 schools, which is girls and boys in our over 700 schools.And then from an economy perspective, last year we brought over R4 billion to the economy, created 8,500 jobs. So those are some really great metrics in a very young product. You know, we're delivering almost a world event every year in this country. From that perspective, I think being just around four years old now, I think we've done some amazing work around the social aspect of South Africa.I mean, it's great. I actually watched his interview last night. Just listening to him, his first experience bowling at the Wanderers in a high-pressure game, and he's done extremely well. He's been throwing the ball in some of the most high-pressure moments as a young man. It's great to see him coming through last year. I think credit to our franchises that have really got behind the youth programme that we've tried. The rookies have started now in the U23. I think IPL franchises are good at attracting youth and backing them.I think we've seen that in India. We see it here as well. And, you know, a lot more players are getting an opportunity to be recognised on a global stage. I was looking at it the other day. Over 10 years, you know, the player salaries will probably be close to a billion rand, if you take it over the 10-year period. And that's a huge, huge uplift in South African cricket ecosystem for players. I think now as a youngster coming through, the cricket dream or from a job perspective, it's looking highly strong for youngsters that want to make it or play.We've been pretty consistent in our window. I think this year is an anomaly. We normally, every year we start at January 9 and 10 after the New Year's Test match and we run for those couple of weeks after that. This year because of South Africa being in India up until the 20th of December and the World Cup in February and there wasn't any international cricket in the window.So, it made sense for us to start slightly earlier. But outside that, our window will generally always be the same, depending on when the New Year's Test match starts and run for a couple of weeks after that. In terms of plugs, I think for us, what we've realised is a lot of what we've done has been really good and it's about making sure we hit those same markers every year. Obviously, they're improving. I think we would love to see the pool of South African players get bigger.So, now we're starting to see across the six teams that the South African group of players are getting really strong. If you want to start adding more teams and stuff into the future, you need to start looking at another 20, 25 high-quality players that make sure when we add new franchises that there's enough depth to make sure that the league remains equally competitive.And then, you know, for us, commercially, we're having our strongest year. You know, we're seeing corporate South Africa get behind us. Global broadcasters as well. So, I think it's about now just making sure you go from strength to strength.I think having six IPL franchises for us has been amazing. I know not every other league has all IPL, but for us it's been amazing because they're equally competitive, they want to win, they invest in players. They're highly driven to be successful. I think they've also had the patience to learn. So, when they move into a new region, they've had to learn about South Africa, learn about ticketing, hospitality, the way fans operate, you know, the culture as well.But they've brought excellence to South African cricket, and that has been a huge asset. They bring excellence to the table and they push you. And that helps everyone get better.Obviously these things, not being in a clean window, are always FTP-related. You know, like Ben Stokes was under contract, but the Ashes is happening, he doesn't come back, he gets replaced. And a poor owner, right. So, I think what you want is for those top players in your window to, if they're not playing international cricket, to want to be here.And I think that's the message we're getting back from them. That they really love coming here, it's highly competitive cricket. Obviously, it's a great place to be over the summer, and there's crowds, and it's fun. Hopefully, also credit to the franchises. I think they play a huge role in attracting the international talent as well.No, we hope to get more and more, you know. There's some great friends that we have in India. And like I say, we've worked closely with the BCCI as well.They've been really supportive in helping us make some key decisions over the years in terms of building the product. But, you know, to have Dada, you know, is a highlight. And I know, having chatted to him a number of times through the year, how seriously he's taking this, and he wants to do well.He's a competitive man. With the Capitals franchise, he has a big influential role. Now, coaching, so he's put himself in the hot seat. I hope the rest of the season goes well for him. It's been a huge asset to have people like him, Kumar Sangakkara Stephen Fleming come out here for our players and also for the status of the league.You can't control everything. We do invest a lot of money in making sure that our anti-corruption units are strong, working with the ICC, best practise. We've had a very strong anti-corruption team here. We educate players on everything... We've seen a strong influence in the drug-free sport.We've seen anti-corruption. So we do all the educational stuff pre-tournament, constantly follow up on it. Make sure there's good policing units around. And you're right. It is a risk to your league. So that's why we spend a lot of money making sure that we're doing everything we can to protect the integrity of the game.I do. I really do. I've said over the last few years, Cricket South Africa started a domestic women's programme, I think it was two years ago. We've invested in the schools and, you know, trying to grow the depth of the women's game here. You know, I think how it starts, I'm not sure yet. I think that'll be a bit, you know, the Cricket South Africa CEO has come out and said that it's time now. So, I think post this tournament, we will all sit down and figure out what that step looks like. But absolutely, it will be one of the major discussions post season four.",SA20 League Commissioner Graeme Smith talks to Sportsmail about the new season.

Bangladesh seek T20 WC match shift from India after Mustafizur Rahman's IPL exit

The Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ) on Friday offered its first response to the ongoing controversy surrounding Bangladesh’s request to play its T20 World Cup matches outside India. The BCCI top brass reviewed operations at its Centre of Excellence (CoE) in Bengaluru and also discussed plans to streamline India U-19 and India A tours going forward, board secretary Devajit Saikia told PTI.Following the meeting, Saikia was asked about Bangladesh approaching the International Cricket Council (ICC) to seek a shift of its T20 World Cup games out of India after the BCCI instructed IPL franchise Kolkata Knight Riders to release Mustafizur Rahman from its roster amid the prevailing relations between the two countries.Saikia responded: ""The meeting was about CoE and other cricketing matters. It's not our domain to talk about that (as the ICC has the final say on Bangladesh's participation in the T20 World Cup).""The meeting, held in Mumbai, was also attended by BCCI president Mithun Manhas, vice-president Rajeev Shukla and head of cricket at the CoE VVS Laxman. Several key technical positions at the CoE, which became fully operational in April last year, remain vacant, including the roles of head of education and head of sports science.""We assessed the vacancies at CoE and decided to go ahead with the recruitment process soon. There is an acute shortage of technical personnel worldwide, but we are trying to fill the positions at the earliest,"" Saikia said.Reviewing the operations at the CoE and outlining the way forward, Saikia added: ""We thought it was an appropriate time to review the preparations and activities of CoE.""We are hosting matches on the three grounds there (including the ongoing Vijay Hazare Trophy). We also talked about how the A tours need to be scheduled going forward.""In certain situations, the A side and senior team are touring together at the same time. We need to ensure that there is no overlap. An A tour is an important supply line of cricketers,"" said the cricketer-turned-lawyer from Assam.",Bangladesh seek T20 WC match shift from India after Mustafizur Rahman's IPL exit.

NEW DELHI: RCB all-rounder Nadine de Klerk on Friday said it would take a few days for the dramatic three-wicket win over defending champions Mumbai Indians in the Women’s Premier League opener to sink in, adding that backing her strengths helped her play a decisive role in the thrilling contest.The South African returned impressive figures of 4/26 to restrict Mumbai Indians to 154 for six and then held her nerve with the bat, scoring an unbeaten 63 off 44 balls under pressure to claim the player-of-the-match award in the last-ball victory.""It is probably going to take a couple of days. If it is your day, you have to ensure you cash in. Glad to get the win,"" de Klerk said when asked if the feeling had sunk in.De Klerk said she stuck to the basics while bowling, which helped her reap rewards.""Just about coming in and backing your skills, and executing. Just sticking to my strengths... sometimes it goes your way, sometimes it does not. On these grounds, on these batting wickets, you just need to cash in.""Speaking about her approach while batting, de Klerk said she wanted to maximise her impact by staying on strike.""Towards the back end, I was thinking of taking a bulk of the strike. Couple of important partnerships.Arundhati (Reddy, 20 runs) batted beautifully. A couple of boundaries (by Prema Rawat - 8 not out) were also very important.""RCB skipper Smriti Mandhana said her side was known for dramatic finishes.""It was a thriller. RCB are known for thrillers, and brilliant from Nadine (to win us this game). Everyone was very positive, even when things were not going well. Nadine did all the work for us in the batting and bowling department,"" Mandhana said.Mumbai Indians captain Harmanpreet Kaur admitted her bowlers fell short on the day.""We just did not bowl one good ball. This happens. We gave her (de Klerk) chances and sometimes, batters come with strong mindset. We missed those chances.""In WPL, we always get matches like that. We need to think what better we can do in the next match,"" she added.","Nadine de Klerk says backing her strengths helped her play a decisive role in the thrilling contest.

Bangladesh seek T20 WC match shift from India after Mustafizur Rahman's IPL exit

Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) president Aminul Islam Bulbul on Friday said the board is still waiting for a response from the International Cricket Council (ICC) on its concerns over playing T20 World Cup matches at venues in India, reiterating that Bangladesh’s position on the issue has not changed.Bangladesh have conveyed their reluctance to tour India for the tournament, which begins on February 7, and have requested that their matches be shifted to co-host Sri Lanka, citing security concerns.The concerns were raised after Bangladesh pacer Mustafizur Rahman was released by IPL franchise Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) on the instructions of the BCCI for unspecified reasons. This came amid reports of attacks on minorities in Bangladesh.""We haven't yet received any reply from the ICC. We have sent all the attachments and proofs of our concern,"" Bulbul told media persons, as cited by news agency PTI.He said the BCB has clearly communicated its stand to the global body and added that shifting matches to another Indian city would not resolve the issue.""Any alternate Indian venue at the end of the day is an Indian venue. You all know that no unilateral decision can be taken and we have to abide by the government's diktat.We are standing where we had been a few days back.""Bulbul said the board would wait for the ICC’s response before deciding on the next step.""I can't comment on what we will do if we aren't allowed to play in Sri Lanka unless the ICC sends its response,"" he said.Bangladesh are scheduled to play three group matches in Kolkata and one in Mumbai. Bulbul said he was not aware of reports suggesting Hyderabad and Chennai as possible alternative venues.""I haven't heard about Hyderabad and Chennai being replacement venues. We might come to know maybe on Monday or Tuesday.""Expressing confidence in the team, Bulbul said Bangladesh can do well, especially in sub-continental conditions.""I believe Bangladesh is a big team in world cricket. We have played the quarterfinals of the 2015 ODI World Cup, we played the Champions Trophy semifinals and in sub-continental conditions we have a good chance of doing well,"" he said.On the recent controversy involving former captain Tamim Iqbal, Bulbul said a BCB director calling Tamim a ""traitor"" was a personal opinion, and that he has sought an explanation.""It was the personal opinion of the director and I have asked him to give clarification. Tamim has achieved so much and he should have kept that in mind while putting his opinion in public,"" Bulbul said.Reflecting on his time in charge, Bulbul said the phase has been instructive for the board.""It’s a learning experience for 25 board of directors.

Shubman Gill press conference: Breaks silence on T20 World Cup snub, and more on his future

Former India cricketer Sanjay Manjrekar recently triggered debate with a strong remark on Virat Kohli , saying the former India captain had stepped away from Test cricket and chosen what he called an easier path by continuing only in ODIs.""I just feel sad that people like Joe Root and Steve Smith, Kane Williamson are really making a name for themselves in Test Cricket. It was okay, Virat Kohli just walked away from cricket, retired from all cricket. But that he's chosen to play one day cricket actually disappoints me more, because this is a format which for a top-order batter, I've said before as well, is the easiest format,"" Manjrekar had said a few days ago.Manjrekar’s view that ODI cricket is the easiest format has led to mixed reactions, especially with a three-match ODI series against New Zealand set to begin in Baroda on Sunday, January 11. India captain Shubman Gill responded to the discussion by pointing out that results do not support the idea that any format is easy.""I don't think any format is easy. If you look at it, the Indian cricket team hasn't won a World Cup since 2011, so if it was that, he would be winning (the) World Cup every second year.It's easy to say, but I don't think any format is easy, it requires a lot of resilience and a lot of persistence and a lot of determination to be able to win big ICC tournaments,"" Gill said.Gill also spoke about the role of Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma in the Indian team. Addressing the media ahead of the first ODI against New Zealand, Gill described Rohit as one of the greatest openers in ODI cricket and Kohli as one of the greatest ODI batters.The India ODI captain said having the two senior players in the side helps the leadership group, particularly during difficult phases in a match.""Among the two players you have named, one is one of the greatest openers (Rohit) of all time in ODIs, and Virat bhai is one of the greatest ODI batsmen ever. So definitely, having these two people in your team makes your life a lot easier, and whenever you are in a challenging situation, you can go to them for input. Because they have often been in those situations, you can go to them to see how they think or what they would do. That piece of information is very valuable for any captain,"" Gill said.India will begin the three-match ODI series against a new-look New Zealand side on Sunday, with Kohli and Rohit expected to play key roles as the hosts look to start the series on a positive note.",Former India cricketer Sanjay Manjrekar recently triggered debate with a strong remark on Virat Kohli.

India can survive without Virat and Rohit, not without Bumrah

Former India captain Sourav Ganguly on Saturday backed India’s spin attack to be a key factor at the upcoming home T20 World Cup, saying Varun Chakravarthy’s fitness could play an important role in the host team’s title defence when the tournament begins on February 7.India have named a spin-heavy bowling group for the next month's T20 World Cup, including Chakravarthy, Kuldeep Yadav, Axar Patel and Washington Sundar. Ganguly said the spin options give India an edge in home conditions.""Yeah, nothing (home WC) gets bigger than that, and India is always my favourite team. They have a strong spin attack and if Chakravarthy is fit then it's good for India,"" Ganguly said while speaking to media persons in Cape Town.Ganguly, who is currently coaching Pretoria Capitals in the SA20, also spoke about taking up a head coach role for the first time in his career. He said the experience has been different from his playing days and has helped him learn new aspects of the game.""First time ever in my life, head coach. But I am enjoying it. Actually, I am very close to (Delhi Capitals co-owner) Parth (Jindal), so he asked me to do this, so I did it.I am also learning. I may have played any amount of matches, captained any amount of matches, but this (coaching) is different. I am coaching and I am doing this to learn and understand,"" said Ganguly, who also serves as the Director of Cricket at Delhi Capitals in the IPL.Earlier in the day, Pretoria Capitals defeated Paarl Royals by 21 runs at Boland Park to move up to third place in the points table. It was their second consecutive win in the tournament.""When you play any big tournament, whether it's a World Cup, IPL or SA20, the back-end gets very tight and competitive and that's where you need to be at your best. It's a very important point. You know these sort of wins when you defend one side, it actually gives you a lot of confidence. Hopefully we will continue to do that. But in sport, every day is a new day. So we'll pick ourselves up and start fresh the day after tomorrow,"" he said.Ganguly also said he was happy to begin his coaching journey in South Africa, a country where he has played several important matches.""This has been a great place for us. I have come so many times here, the World Cup finals, in 2003. We lost, but we were exceptional in the tournament. South Africa is a place for cricket. You can see how good the tournament is.""The stands are full, even on a weekday, people come and watch.

India Squad:

New Zealand Squad:

India and New Zealand are set to begin their three-match ODI series on Sunday, with all eyes once again on Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma . The two senior batters are expected to play a key role as India field a near full-strength side at home. Even though the T20 World Cup is just weeks away, the ODIs remain important, and Kohli and Rohit are likely to dominate attention over the next seven days.Both players have stayed busy in recent weeks. They featured in the Vijay Hazare Trophy and scored heavily, showing they are still in top form. Their performances suggest that India’s ODI plans continue to revolve around their experience and consistency.A lot of focus will also be on Shubman Gill . The Indian captain returns to the ODI side after being left out of the T20 World Cup squad. His form has been under scrutiny, and his comeback could mean Yashasvi Jaiswal misses out at the top of the order despite scoring his maiden ODI hundred against South Africa recently. Shreyas Iyer’s return is expected to bring stability back at No. 4 after several experiments.KL Rahul is likely to continue as wicketkeeper and finisher, keeping Rishabh Pant out of the XI for now. Ravindra Jadeja has trained fully and looks fit, while Jasprit Bumrah and Hardik Pandya have been rested to manage workload.The pace attack will be led by Mohammed Siraj, along with Arshdeep Singh, Prasidh Krishna and Harshit Rana.Spin duties will be shared by Kuldeep Yadav, Washington Sundar and Jadeja. With flat pitches and dew expected, bowlers may focus more on control than attacking for wickets.The match will be historic as it marks the first men’s international at the new BCA Stadium in Vadodara.New Zealand arrive with a fresh-looking squad and several senior players missing. Despite that, they remain confident and committed to their mindset. On previous tours, Kiwi players spoke about wanting to “fire the first shot”, while their current approach is “you are where your feet are”. Michael Bracewell will lead the side, with experienced batters like Devon Conway and Daryl Mitchell still posing a threat.Rohit Sharma, Shubman Gill(c), Virat Kohli, Shreyas Iyer, KL Rahul(w), Washington Sundar, Nitish Kumar Reddy, Harshit Rana, Kuldeep Yadav, Arshdeep Singh, Mohammed Siraj, Prasidh Krishna, Rishabh Pant, Yashasvi Jaiswal, Ravindra Jadeja.Devon Conway(w), Will Young, Henry Nicholls, Daryl Mitchell, Glenn Phillips, Michael Bracewell(c), Zakary Foulkes, Nick Kelly, Josh Clarkson, Michael Rae, Kyle Jamieson, Mitchell Hay, Adithya Ashok, Kristian Clarke, Jayden Lennox.","India and New Zealand begin their three-match ODI series on Sunday.

NEW DELHI: Indian fast bowler Umran Malik, often compared with Pakistan's legendary Shoaib Akhtar for his raw pace, has been left out of Jammu and Kashmir’s squad for the Ranji Trophy preparatory camp in Pondicherry.The decision has surprised many fans, especially given Malik’s experience at the international level. Picked by Kolkata Knight Riders for Rs 75 lakh at the IPL 2025 auction and retained this year, the pacer has represented India in 10 ODIs and eight T20Is, but his recent domestic form has not been convincing enough for selection.Umran was part of Jammu and Kashmir’s squad for the first half of the Ranji Trophy season.However, he featured in only one match, against Rajasthan in Srinagar, where he failed to take a wicket. His struggles continued in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy, where he played five matches and picked up six wickets.Despite that, Malik was dropped from the squad for the Vijay Hazare Trophy and has now also missed out on the Ranji Trophy preparatory camp. The reason for the snub, however, is still unknown.“To prepare the J&K Team for the tournament & acclimatise the team, the Management has decided to send its team to Pondicherry.The players and Members of Support staff of the team will travel directly to Chennai under the arrangements of JKCA on 16th January, 2026 from their respective locations,"" wrote the JKCA in a statement.“The team will then travel in the Bus from Chennai to Pondicherry arranged by the Cricket Association of Pondicherry.

Captain Ashleigh Gardner anchored the innings with a well-paced 65. Opener Sophie Devine set the tone early with 38 before being dismissed in the sixth over.

Captain Meg Lanning and Phoebe Litchfield then steadied the chase with a 70-run partnership for the second wicket. Lanning scored 30 off 27 balls, rotating the strike as Litchfield played the attacking role.The match turned sharply in Gujarat’s favour during a brief collapse.

Litchfield struck eight fours and five sixes during her knock, but her dismissal in the 16th over effectively ended the chase.Asha Sobhana provided late resistance with an unbeaten 27 off 10 balls, hitting three fours and two sixes, but the required rate proved too steep.

Poll What do you think of Kazuyoshi Miura's decision to play professional football at 58? Inspiring Questionable Unusual but brave

Kazuyoshi Miura is not ready to fade away. At 58, the former Japan international striker has vowed to show he still belongs on the football pitch as he prepares for an extraordinary 41st professional season, extending a career that began nearly four decades ago.Popularly known as “King Kazu,” Miura has joined third-division side Fukushima United on a six-month loan ahead of the new Japanese season, which kicks off in early February. The move brings him back into the J. League structure for the first time in five years and underlines his refusal to let age dictate the end of his playing days.Speaking at his official unveiling in Tokyo on Friday, Miura said he was determined to repay the faith shown in him by his new club. “Strikers can score goals in bunches or they can go through dry spells, and you have to have an image in your mind of scoring goals,” he told reporters. “It’s difficult to put a number on it but I definitely want to score and assist.”Still brimming with ambition, Miura added that he wants to contribute in multiple ways. “I’d like to dribble down the left wing and whip in crosses,” he said, offering a glimpse of the attacking intent that has defined his long career.Miura made his professional debut in 1986 with Brazilian giants Santos and has since played across the globe, turning out for clubs in Italy, Croatia, Australia and Portugal. He was a central figure in popularising football in Japan, particularly after the launch of the professional J. League in 1993.Last season, Miura featured for fourth-tier Atletico Suzuka, making eight appearances without scoring as the club was relegated after finishing second from bottom and losing a playoff. Despite the setback, he remains undeterred.Miura, who earned 89 caps and scored 55 goals for Japan but was famously omitted from their 1998 World Cup squad, summed up his motivation simply: “I just want to be on the pitch, even for just one minute or one second longer.”","Kazuyoshi Miura has joined third-division side Fukushima United on a six-month loan ahead of the new Japanese season, which kicks off in early February.

Arsenal winger Gabriel Martinelli has issued a public apology to Liverpool defender Conor Bradley after a controversial late incident marred the goalless Premier League draw at the Emirates, drawing fierce criticism from pundits and rival players alike.The flashpoint occurred deep into stoppage time when Bradley went down near the touchline after landing awkwardly while making a clearance. As the Liverpool defender lay in visible pain, Martinelli attempted to hurry the restart by dropping the ball on him and then shoving him off the pitch. Bradley eventually left the stadium on crutches with his knee strapped, raising fears of a serious injury.The Brazilian winger was shown a yellow card, but some former players felt the punishment was lenient. On Sky Sports, Roy Keane branded Martinelli's conduct “a disgrace,” while Gary Neville described it as “absolutely disgraceful,” reflecting the widespread backlash that followed the final whistle.Responding to the criticism, Martinelli took to Instagram to offer a heartfelt apology, revealing he had already contacted Bradley directly.“Conor and I have messaged and I've already apologised to him,” Martinelli wrote. “I really didn't understand he was seriously injured in the heat of the moment. I want to say I'm deeply sorry for reacting. Sending Conor all my best again for a quick recovery.”Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta came out in defence of his player, insisting there was no malicious intent. “Knowing Gabi, there's zero intention,” Arteta said. “Probably he doesn't know [Bradley is injured]. He's an incredible, lovely guy and would never do that if he knew the situation.”Liverpool boss Arne Slot echoed that view while expressing concern over Bradley's condition. “Let's hope for the best, but I fear the worst for Conor Bradley,” Slot said. “You cannot expect Martinelli to think so clearly in the 94th minute. I'm 100 percent sure that if he knew what the injury might be, he would never do that.”However, Slot also admitted his discomfort at seeing an injured player being moved. “I didn't like to see one of my players being moved out of the pitch if he might have such a big injury,” he added.The match itself ended 0-0, marking Arsenal's first home blank of the season but still extending their lead at the top of the table to six points over Manchester City.","Gabriel Martinelli has issued a public apology to Liverpool defender Conor Bradley after a controversial late incident.

New Delhi: Bengaluru FC owner Parth Jindal on Wednesday called on the players to ""make sacrifices"" in view of the ""financial burden"" the club will shoulder to participate in the delayed Indian Super League (ISL) next month, saying without their support, the club may have to ""shut shop for good"".All India Football Federation's (AIFF) bid to rope in a new commercial partner did not find any takers after the Master Rights Agreement (MRA) with the ISL organisers, the Reliance-owned FSDL, ended on December 8 last year.Though Sports Minister Mansukh Mandaviya on Tuesday announced that the delayed and truncated 2025-26 ISL season will begin on February 14 with all the 14 clubs participating in it, the franchises will struggle financially if the top-tier tournament does not get a commercial partner soon.The AIFF is expected to float another tender soon for a commercial partner.Jindal did not specifically explain the kind of sacrifice the footballers will be expected to make, but it could well be a reduced salary for this season. The club features, among others, former India captain Sunil Chhetri and star goalkeeper Gurpreet Singh Sandhu.The ISL clubs are required to share 60 per cent of the financial cost (around Rs one crore per club) for the league to start after a nearly six months long pause.The total cost for the upcoming season has been pegged at Rs 25 crore by the AIFF.""Tremendous sacrifice from all clubs is being asked for to play the ISL in its current format. Repercussions if we don't have a league are very worrying,"" Jindal wrote on 'X'.""Truly hope the players understand the additional financial burden on the clubs and agree to also sacrifice as we are all in this together. We are in this for the love of football and to see our country play the beautiful game and be good at it.""He admitted that Bengaluru FC has been a loss-making franchise since joining the ISL and said the club may have to wind up its operations if players do not cooperate.""@bengalurufc football has been a loss making proposition for all since I can remember - this year's numbers without the players helping out will force many to shut shop for good,"" he said in the tweet which was reposted by FC Goa CEO Ravi Puskur.Jindal also thanked Mandaviya ""for his intervention and his proposal"", which led to the ending of a crisis that paralysed Indian football.Earlier on Friday, leading names such as Sunil Chhetri, along with several foreign recruits of the ISL, had called for world governing body FIFA's intervention to rescue the ISL.Chhetri, Gurpreet Singh Sandhu and Sandhesh Jhingan voiced concern over the prolonged uncertainty, warning that Indian football would be slipping into a state of ""permanent paralysis"".On Tuesday, Mandaviya announced that the ISL will have 91 matches on home and away basis, the logistics of which are still being worked out.AIFF President Kalyan Chaubey, who took over the explaining part after the Minister's announcement, said a Rs 25 crore central pool has been made for only the conduct of the ISL.""Ten percent of this fund will come from AIFF, 30 percent was to come from a commercial partner but since we don't have one right now, the AIFF will pitch in with that contribution,"" Chaubey had said.""In all, the AIFF will give Rs 14 crore for ISL and about Rs 3.2 crore for I League till we find a commercial partner.

Poll Do you agree with the decision to change the ISL format to a single leg home and away structure? Yes, it's a good change. No, I preferred the previous format. Undecided.

PANAJI: The sports ministry and the All India Football Federation (AIFF) turned the tables on top-tier clubs during a joint meeting in the Capital on Tuesday, leaving them with no choice but agree to take part in this edition of the Indian Super League (ISL).Sports minister Mansukh Mandaviya later announced that the ISL will kick off on Feb 14 with all 14 teams taking part. When clubs headed to the Capital at short notice — summoned individually through a phone call late on Monday night by AIFF deputy secretary general M Satyanarayan — they were expecting to hear the proposal, return home, study and then consult owners. Instead, they were told time was running out and they had to say “yes or no” on Tuesday itself.“We had no choice to decide whether the (short-term) proposal makes sense,” said one club official who had to hurriedly call the club owner and inform him of the latest developments.Consistent in their stand that they are taking part in the top league, whatever the format and financial implications, Jamshedpur FC were the first to provide an email confirmation, followed by the likes of Punjab FC, East Bengal, NorthEast United, Mohammedan Sporting and Inter Kashi.Later, Delhi SC, Bengaluru FC and Mohun Bagan Super Giant came on board. Five clubs — Kerala Blasters, Chennaiyin FC, Mumbai City, FC Goa and Odisha FC — needed time to speak with their owners and reluctantly agreed. ISL clubs were also taken aback with the change in format.While most were in favour of a single-leg centralised format, AIFF proposed a single leg home and away structure for the current season, estimated to cost Rs24.3 crore. AIFF said a single leg centralised format will cost Rs 38 crore, adding to the cost.The ISL will have a total of 91 matches with all 14 teams playing each other once. Clubs have to pay Rs 1 crore each as franchise fee. As per the constitution, the top league will have principles of promotion and relegation, but AIFF is likely to approach the Supreme Court for a one-year relaxation, given that it will be a truncated league. Talking to the media, sports minister Mansukh Mandaviya said: “Today the govt, football federation and 14 clubs had a meeting and we have decided that ISL will start Feb 14 on Saturday. All 14 clubs will participate.”“Similarly, the I-League will be held around the same time with all 11 clubs participating. The leagues will finally happen,” he added.Mandaviya was joined by the beleaguered AIFF president Kalyan Chaubey, who explained the financial and logistical aspects of both leagues. “A Rs 25 crore central pool has been made only for the conduct of the ISL. 10 percent of this fund will come from AIFF, 50% from clubs and 10% from legacy partners (clubs). Another 30% was to come from a commercial partner but since we don’t have one right now, the AIFF will pitch in with that contribution for this season,” Chaubey said.","Sports minister Mansukh Mandaviya announced that the ISL will kick off on Feb 14 with all 14 teams taking part.

Usman Khawaja's retirement speech: 'I want the journey for the next Usman Khawaja to be easier'

- Full-time job? -

LONDON: Manchester United interim boss Darren Fletcher said Tuesday that leading the club was beyond his ""wildest dreams"" but insisted he has not considered replacing the sacked Ruben Amorim. The Portuguese manager was axed on Monday after a turbulent 14 months at Old Trafford, with former United midfielder Fletcher put in temporary charge.The under-18s coach faced the press for the first time on the eve of his team's match at Burnley.""It's surreal,"" said Fletcher, who made 342 appearances for the Red Devils and has worked in a variety of different roles for them since 2020, including as technical director.""It's an amazing honour to be able to lead a Manchester United team,"" he said. ""I don't even think it was in my wildest dreams that that was something that could potentially happen, even thinking about playing for the club and stuff like that.""But to lead out the team is an amazing honour and something I am really proud to do.""It's not (happened) in the circumstances that I expected it to happen so that obviously is something that doesn't sit quite easy with me, but I just have to think I've got a job to do and I've got to lead the team tomorrow and think of the great honour and pride in doing that.""The former Scotland international is expected to remain in place until the club appoints a caretaker boss, with United planning to name Amorim's permanent successor at the end of the season.The BBC reported that the club had held preliminary talks with Fletcher, Michael Carrick and former boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, all ex-United players, about the position of caretaker.But Fletcher, 41, said at his pre-match press conference that conversations with United's hierarchy had focused on Wednesday's game and they would talk again after the match.Fletcher was asked whether he wanted to try to earn the manager's job on a full-time basis.""Honestly it's not something I've thought about,"" he said. ""I'm focusing on Burnley. I think that discussion is for after the game.""There has been that much going on and it has all happened so quickly that all my concentration, efforts and thoughts have gone into Burnley.""Fletcher won five Premier League titles under the management of Alex Ferguson but the club have not been English champions since 2013.""Everyone expects Manchester United to be on the top and winning, that's the standard, that's what we all have to try and achieve,"" said a bullish Fletcher.He was asked what his United team would look like.""Hopefully it looks like a Manchester United team that represents a bit of me, I think in terms of what I know is Manchester United,"" he said.""So I hope it resembles a Manchester United team that fans can be proud of, that I can be proud of, and I'm sure they will because I believe in the players.""I think we've got good players and I think we've got players who care and I think we've got a lot of quality in that team and I hope to give them a platform to go out there to express themselves.""Fletcher said he hoped to welcome back captain Bruno Fernandes and Mason Mount into a squad badly depleted by injuries and international commitments.He joked that he refused to disclose sensitive information when asked whether his twin sons, Jack and Tyler, would be given full debuts against Burnley.United are sixth in the Premier League table, three points behind fourth-placed Liverpool.","Darren Fletcher says leading Manchester United is beyond his ""wildest dreams"" Fletcher says he has not considered replacing the sacked Ruben Amorim.

Who will the Rams play next?



Los Angeles Rams next playoff opponent is now the biggest question swirling around the NFC as the postseason tightens and margins grow thinner. Survival mattered more than style on wild-card weekend, and Los Angeles proved it can still win when the game slips toward chaos. Mistakes piled up, momentum swung, and the crowd held its breath. Yet when the season hung in the balance, the Rams leaned on experience and nerve.That grit carried them past Carolina in a 34-31 escape that felt more like a street fight than a statement. Early control vanished, turnovers haunted them, and special teams faltered. Still, Matthew Stafford refused to blink. With the clock draining and pressure mounting, he engineered a calm, precise drive that ended with Colby Parkinson crossing the goal line with 38 seconds left. It was not flawless football. It was winning football.The Rams now wait as the NFL ’s reseeded playoff bracket reshapes the road ahead. Their divisional-round opponent will emerge from a web of results still unfolding across wild-card weekend. Seattle sits comfortably with a bye, watching the rest of the field battle for position. Philadelphia and San Francisco clash on Sunday, while Chicago meets Green Bay under Saturday night lights.Several paths are in play. A Packers win paired with an Eagles victory sends Los Angeles to Philadelphia. If Green Bay wins and the 49ers advance, the Rams would host San Francisco in a rivalry soaked in history. Should Chicago knock off the Packers and Philadelphia survive, the Rams head north to face Seattle. If the Bears win and San Francisco moves on, Chicago becomes the destination.Each matchup brings a different emotional weight. Seattle carries recent familiarity and postseason confidence, where Los Angeles owns a perfect playoff record against the Seahawks. Chicago represents unfinished business after last season’s loss and memories of a distant but painful NFC title defeat. Philadelphia still stings, fresh off last year’s divisional heartbreak and a narrow regular-season loss. San Francisco is the oldest rivalry of them all, one that has swung wildly and delivered unforgettable January drama.What remains constant is the Rams’ position. This is their second straight divisional appearance and the 21st in franchise history. They have walked this path before, including the 2022 run that ended with a Super Bowl parade. Whoever lines up across from them next week will face a team that bends, survives, and believes when it matters most.Also Read: Matthew Stafford’s wife Kelly steals Wild Card spotlight with daring MVP claim and coordinated Rams looks for daughters","The Los Angeles Rams beat the Carolina Panthers 34-31 in the NFC wild-card game.

Packers vs Bears snow game adds another chapter to a bitter rivalry



Packers vs Bears snow game instantly turns Soldier Field into a stage where football feels raw, loud, and beautifully unforgiving. Snow is a familiar enemy in Chicago, the kind that clings to boots and turns simple drives into slow battles. Yet when kickoff nears, that same nuisance becomes part of the theater. Early Saturday, a steady blanket of white covered Soldier Field, hinting that this matchup would not be clean or comfortable. For fans raised on frozen Sundays, the sight alone was enough to stir memories of old-school football, where grit mattered as much as talent.Cold-weather games have a way of pulling viewers in, even those far from the Midwest. Television loves it. So do fans. The swirling flakes, frozen breath, and muddied jerseys create drama no dome can match. Reporters on site shared images of the field slowly disappearing under snow, setting the tone hours before kickoff. This was not just another playoff game. It felt like an event.Green Bay has long embraced ugly conditions as part of its identity. The franchise lore is filled with snow-packed victories that shaped the NFL’s image, and this night offered another chance to lean into that history.Forecasts pointed to biting wind chills and gusts between 20 and 30 miles per hour, conditions that punish hesitation and reward discipline.Neither side entered unfamiliar territory. The rivals already traded wins during the regular season, splitting two cold December contests. Green Bay struck first in Week 14 with a 28-21 victory, only to watch Chicago answer two weeks later with a 22-16 overtime win. Those results set the stage for a tiebreaker that mattered far more.Chicago arrived confident under head coach Ben Johnson after capturing its first division title since 2018. The Bears offense closed the season averaging nearly 26 points per game, backed by a defense that thrived on chaos with a league-leading 33 takeaways. Green Bay’s case rested on quarterback Jordan Love , who delivered a sharp season marked by efficiency, poise, and protection of the football.Still, the snow did not hide every concern. Green Bay’s defense entered short-handed after losing Micah Parsons to a torn ACL, a blow that lingered through a rough finish to the regular season. In weather like this, depth matters. So does resolve.Also Read: Madison Beer’s jaw-dropping selfie steals spotlight as Justin Herbert prepares for Chargers-Patriots playoff clash","Green Bay Packers and Chicago Bears face off in a snow-covered playoff game.

Madison Beer turns heads as Justin Herbert prepares for Patriots playoff clash



Madison Beer does not wait for game day lights to command attention. While playoff pressure builds around the Los Angeles Chargers, she found her own way to dominate the conversation, doing it quietly, stylishly, and entirely on her terms. Long before kickoff in Foxborough, the pop singer shifted the spotlight with a carefully curated Instagram carousel that felt personal rather than performative.The post featured ten photos, but one image carried undeniable weight. In a mirror selfie, Beer wore a black structured bodice paired with ripped beige stockings and a cinched waist belt. The look balanced edge with restraint. Her hair fell naturally with a center part, adding softness to an otherwise bold fit. Other frames in the carousel hinted at what is next for her creatively, including a pose with the cover of her upcoming album, Locket, signaling momentum beyond fashion.Away from the gridiron noise, Beer followed up with another quiet flex on her Instagram Story. Wearing a simple white tank top, she posed from the rear angle while holding two new covers of Locket. The image felt unfiltered and intentional, reinforcing her control over her narrative as both an artist and public figure.No captions were needed. The message was clear.All this unfolded as Justin Herbert prepared for a daunting road test. The Chargers travel to Massachusetts to face the New England Patriots in the Wild Card Round, with Herbert still searching for his first postseason win. At 0-2 in playoff appearances, the challenge is steep for the 27-year-old quarterback, especially as the No. 7 seed facing the No. 2 team.Off the field, though, Herbert appears steady. His relationship with Beer became public this season, starting with a kiss at a Chargers game in Los Angeles. Since then, she has been a visible presence, dancing in the stands during a win, attending games with her mother, and sharing moments from Lakers games and the World Series. Matching sailor costumes on Halloween only added to their easy chemistry.Beer recently spoke openly about that bond, saying, ""I feel supported and taken care of in a way that I can break down and I have someone to lean on,"" Beer admitted. ""I think it’s important.”Whether she appears at Gillette Stadium remains to be seen. But as Herbert chases a breakthrough on the field, Beer continues to thrive in her own lane. Win or lose, their worlds are clearly aligned, each finding success in different arenas.Also Read: Matthew Stafford’s wife Kelly steals Wild Card spotlight with daring MVP claim and coordinated Rams looks for daughters","Justin Herbert and Madison Beer's relationship became public this season.

The internet barely had time to catch its breath after Jaxson Dart went Instagram official before the Giants quarterback added a personal twist that sent fans buzzing. Hours after confirming his relationship with Marissa Ayers, Dart made his feelings unmistakably clear with a nickname that felt intimate, playful, and unmistakably public.Ayers had shared a carousel of moments that felt curated yet candid.

Her caption kept things teasing and open ended: “Rumor has it…,” leaving the rest to interpretation.The comment section quickly became the real story. Dart responded with a simple but telling message: “My Peach,” instantly drawing attention from fans and teammates alike. He followed it up with another line that leaned into the romance without trying too hard: “In a movie w you 🥰.”The reactions did not stop there. Giants running back Cam Skattebo, one of Dart’s closest friends, added humor to the moment by writing, “Give back my boy 😢.” The lighthearted exchange reflected the tight bond between the two rookies, who entered the league together in the 2025 NFL Draft.That friendship has always been loud and unconventional. Dart once described their first interaction in vivid detail, saying, “The first [time we met] we said three words to each other and just head-butted each other.That was kind of like the start of our relationship. Obviously, we're still getting to know each other. I fell asleep on the plane and I wake up to this dude wet-willying me and trying to put food on my face while I'm sleeping. That is kind of an accurate representation. It's 100% [who he is].”Even Skattebo’s girlfriend Chloe Rodriguez joined the fun, joking in the comments, “Rumor has it we still haven’t gone on a double date.🤧”For a Giants team coming off a difficult season, Dart’s off field moment offered something lighter.

After a hard fall, Diggs disputed concussion concerns, insisting his issue was his shoulder. He returned quickly, finishing with nine catches for 138 yards in a statement performance for the New England Patriots.

Why Stefon Diggs refused to stay sidelined

The moment barely lasted a few minutes, but it told a much bigger story about who Stefon Diggs is at this stage of his career. On a cold December night in Baltimore, Diggs was not just battling defenders. He was battling protocol, trainers, and the quiet fear that follows any hard fall in the NFL.Last year, the Patriots were early into their prime time matchup against the Baltimore Ravens when Diggs landed awkwardly after a big catch. Cameras caught him heading into the blue medical tent. Minutes later, he was gone. Not cleared. Not escorted. Gone. What followed became one of the most talked about moments of New England’s late season push.After the game, Diggs did not dodge the questions. He leaned into them with raw honesty and a touch of humor. His explanation revealed both his frustration and his mindset as a veteran trying to prove he still belongs.“I was blacking out, bro,” Diggs said. “They were holding me in the tent. They said I had a concussion, but they never touched my head, I never laid on the ground. They monitored me for a concussion. I said, ‘I never had a concussion.’ I was touching my shoulder, so how y’all say I had a concussion?”“I was fighting with them to get back out there. It was the first drive.I’m wired to get back out there to make plays for my team. We had a little stall, so I was like, ‘Damn, I’m supposed to be out there.’ I feel like I let the team down if I’m not out there. I apologized to them afterwards, but you can’t stop me from being out on the field.”Diggs backed up that intensity with production. He finished the night with nine catches for 138 yards, delivering in every critical moment. For a player over 30, coming off a torn ACL, and signed late by the New England Patriots, it felt personal.Under first year head coach Mike Vrabel, Diggs did not just chase yards. He chased relevance. On that night, he made sure the world was still watching.Also Read: Stefon Diggs and Cardi B are becoming a growing headache for the Patriots as the couple stirs nonstop controversy","Stefon Diggs disputed concussion concerns, insisting his issue was his shoulder.

The Chiefs star said her support helps him stay balanced as an athlete and a father. Mahomes also shared hopes that the series will one day inspire his children to chase their dreams while valuing family life.

Patrick Mahomes credits Brittany for keeping life and football in balance

Talent is rarely a source of success in the NFL. In the case of Patrick Mahomes, the root goes much deeper and begins at home. When cameras flashed at the Los Angeles premiere of Netflix Quarterback in July 2023, Mahomes made it clear that the net support system he has is not located in locker rooms or playbooks, but stand by his side each day.It is no easy task to balance between superstardom, fatherhood, and marriage, but Mahomes attributes all his achievements on the field to stability off of it. With two Super Bowl titles already to his name, the Chiefs quarterback spoke with rare openness about how family allows him to stay grounded while chasing greatness.Standing on the red carpet, Mahomes did not hesitate when asked about the secret behind managing pressure and expectations. “I have a great wife. I think that helps out a ton,” he told PEOPLE in 2023. “She helps me out a ton by taking stuff off my plate.”That sense of ease allows him to remain authentic, even as his profile continues to grow. “I have great people around me and I can be Patrick Mahomes,” he added. “I can be myself, the same person I've grown up being and luckily that's won a couple of Super Bowls.”His wider circle includes wife Brittany Mahomes, daughter Sterling Skye, and son Patrick “Bronze” Lavon Mahomes III.For Mahomes, Quarterback is not just a sports series. It is a future message to his children. “That when dad's not home, he's out there working hard to achieve his dream,” he said. “I don't know what my kids' dreams are going to be, but I want them to work hard at it and try to achieve those.”Brittany sees that balance up close. She praised her husband’s growth, saying, “He has a soft spot, but I think he's done such an amazing job at balancing his work life and his at-home life, and I think he's really switched around his priorities and figured it out,” calling him “The best father ever.”From football to family, Mahomes continues to prove that elite performance starts with unwavering support at home.Also Read: Brittany Mahomes’ postpartum struggles didn’t end quietly, and her latest reveal has everyone asking questions",Patrick Mahomes credits wife Brittany for keeping life and football in balance.

Sources claim relatives worry about financial imbalance and potential prenup loopholes, despite the couple’s happiness and growing family. While Bündchen appears confident in her choice, those closest to her remain cautious about long term security.

Gisele Bündchen ’s family still compares Joaquim Valente to Tom Brady

With Gisele Bundchen moving into married life with Joaquim Valente, the family seems to have no genuine move out of the shadow of her former marriage with Tom Brady. Although the supermodel appears to be happy and unafraid of her new life, the people close to her were reportedly more cautious about it.Sources suggest the concern has little to do with love and more to do with long term security. Bündchen built a global empire through decades of modeling and business ventures. For her family, financial independence has always mattered, and comparisons to Brady remain unavoidable given his wealth and stature during their 13 year marriage.According to a source speaking to Page Six, Bündchen’s family fears her new marriage could create complications down the line despite legal safeguards. The source said, “Her family warned her that marrying a penniless guy when she is worth millions is a mistake. Her family told her to just live with him.”The source added, “But between Valente's pressure and her being a traditionalist, she felt since they have a child, they might as well marry. There is a prenup, but with some loopholes that mean if they divorce there will be a financial settlement for him.”That unease contrasts sharply with how Bündchen’s relationship with Brady once appeared.Brady earned his own fortune through football and endorsements, which removed financial imbalance from the equation. With Valente, the dynamic is different, even if the emotional bond appears strong.Bündchen and Valente met through her children’s jiu jitsu training and moved quickly after her 2022 divorce. In less than three years, they built a family and formalized their commitment. Publicly, there are no cracks. Privately, family members remain watchful.For now, Bündchen seems unfazed by outside noise. She has chosen stability, love, and tradition on her own terms. Whether her family’s worries prove valid will only be answered with time, but the comparison to Brady still lingers where it matters most behind closed doors.Also Read: Tom Brady’s suicide hotline reference fuels worries about his mental state after Gisele Bündchen split and Alix Earle dating rumors","Gisele Bündchen’s family is reportedly uneasy about her marriage to Joaquim Valente, with Tom Brady still serving as a point of comparison.

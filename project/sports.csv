Josh Hazlewood - we picked up momentum from Jitesh’s knock in Lucknow

Poll Do you think RCB has the best bowling attack in the IPL? Yes, definitely It's competitive but not the best No, there are stronger teams

Punjab Kings bowling coach James Hopes on where it went wrong - after the first over





In the last couple of years, Josh Hazlewood has taken his T20 game to the next level. The seamer is six feet five inches tall, has a high release point, and he makes the most of it.The ball that nailed Punjab Kings' Josh Inglis in Qualifier 1 was not too short. It was just an effort ball, and his fellow countryman was undone by the extra bounce. On Thursday night against the Kings, he picked up 3 for 21, and dismantled the opposition in the powerplay by getting rid of their in-form captain Shreyas Iyer.For a bowler who hadn’t seemed too clued about the T20 format in his earlier days, Hazlewood is playing a different game now. He sees it as a natural evolution of playing more and more T20s.""I think, purely just opportunity and experience of playing the format more often, different leagues, obviously mostly international but I think I've really improved,"" he told reporters after RCB cruised to their fourth final, following a convincing eight-wicket victory over Punjab Kings.""You just learn every year. I think you always learn something and you sort of just take that and put it into your arsenal and remember that the next time.You can train all you want but I think playing the game, playing T20 cricket, you are learning all the time, so yeah that is probably the main thing I think that has made me improve as a T20 bowler. Purely the opportunity and the learning from the experiences,"" he added.Hazlewood missed a few matches for RCB after he sustained a shoulder injury.""Worked really hard the last few weeks on the shoulders to get back and got some good overs into it the last sort of 10 days. I was happy with tonight, the wicket helped obviously, didn't it? Not having to bowl fast yorkers or anything like that. So yeah, it is good to be back,"" he said.The break proved to be a blessing in disguise for the Australian pacer. He has not only recovered but is raring to go for the second World Test Championship (WTC) final, starting from June 11 against South Africa.""I've got to be bowling, you know, wherever I am in the world I've got to be bowling, getting ready for that game anyway. There's no better place than, I think, out in the middle, obviously you've got to bowl more, more hours of training from time to time to build up for a Test, but to get that intensity right up, there's no better place than the IPL. I don't bowl too much differently in Test match cricket than tonight,"" said Hazlewood.Hazlewood suggests RCB has got all the bases covered when it comes to bowling. He said: ""I think we've just got all bases covered, it feels like. I think any one of the five or six bowlers can bowl at any moment of the game, whether it's the start, middle or end.""""I think it obviously helps having Bhuvi, who has so much experience, quite a calm customer, so that sort of rubs off on the rest of their attack. I'm probably pretty similar to Bhuvi as well in that regard, everything is quite relaxed, quite calm, focus on your skill and try and execute that,"" he added.A couple of years ago, Australia head coach Andrew McDonald had summed up Hazlewood’s rise in T20s: “If you give a highly-skilled bowler a chance in the format, he will work it out.” In a way, he was correct. Hazlewood hasn't changed as a bowler. The soul of his bowling is to hit that good length consistently and keep trapping the batters, who always go for an adventure in this format.With 21 wickets in just 11 games, Hazlewood has shown that he is probably the most crucial piece in RCB's quest for an elusive title.",Royal Challengers Bengaluru beat Punjab Kings by eight wickets to reach IPL final. Josh Hazlewood took 3 for 21 as RCB cruised to their fourth final.

At the innings break, Punjab Kings (PBKS) players posed for the camera. The moment their faces hit the big screens, it told the story of the 85 minutes they had just endured against a charged-up Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) in Qualifier 1 of the IPL playoffs at the Maharaja Yadavindra Singh International Cricket Stadium in Mullanpur.The faces of the Punjab Kings players said it all — battered, dejected, bruised, and in complete disbelief at what had just hit them. The stars of the show? The RCB bowlers.After being put in to bat first, PBKS were annihilated by the RCB attack, bundled out for just 101 in 14.1 overs. Everything RCB touched on the night turned to gold — barring one bizarre review.RCB were simply outstanding with the ball, and every bowler chipped in. Whether it was Yash Dayal (2/26), Bhuvneshwar Kumar (1/17), Josh Hazlewood (3/21), Suyash Sharma (3/17), or Romario Shepherd (1/5) — they hunted down the PBKS batters like a pack of wolves. Their execution, aggression, and fielding intensity completely smothered Punjab.RCB put their bodies on the line, executed every plan to perfection, and brought relentless energy onto the field — putting PBKS into a deep sleep.While RCB’s bowlers were top-class, Punjab contributed heavily to their own downfall with some atrocious cricket. There were plenty of soft dismissals, a flurry of rash shots, and the end result was plain for all to see.PBKS were in such a hurry, they lasted only 14.1 overs in a 20-over innings — the shortest batting innings in IPL playoff history. The previous low was Delhi Capitals’ 16.1 overs against Rajasthan Royals in the IPL 2008 semifinal.Only Prabhsimran Singh, Marcus Stoinis, and Azmatullah Omarzai managed to reach double digits, with Stoinis top-scoring with a 17-ball 26.The collapse began with the soft dismissal of Priyansh Arya, who had punished deliveries outside off stump throughout the tournament. But playing away from the body to a ball with extra bounce, he checked his shot and offered a simple catch to Krunal Pandya at cover. Prabhsimran and Shreyas Iyer followed with identical hoicks to keeper Jitesh Sharma.Josh Hazlewood, returning from an injury layoff, picked up three big wickets — Shreyas Iyer, Josh Inglis, and Azmatullah Omarzai.Suyash Sharma, who hadn’t been at his best in recent matches, spun a web around Punjab’s lower middle order — removing Shashank Singh, impact sub Musheer Khan (for a duck), and the big fish, Marcus Stoinis.Romario Shepherd came in to bowl the 14th over and capped it off by breaking Harpreet Brar’s off stump, summing up PBKS’s horror evening with the bat.Chasing a modest total, RCB were off the blocks like they had a flight to catch to Ahmedabad that very night. Riding on Phil Salt's 27-ball 56, they chased it down with eight wickets in hand and 60 balls to spare. The win helped RCB cruise into the IPL 2025 final.Arshdeep Singh leaked 24 runs from his first two overs. The lanky Kyle Jamieson briefly brought the silent Punjab Kings fans back into the game after dismissing Virat Kohli — in similar fashion to the way he got him out during the inaugural World Test Championship (WTC) final in 2021 at Southampton. Extra bounce from a short-of-length delivery outside off did the trick again, with Kohli edging behind for Josh Inglis to complete the catch.The wicket didn't deter Phil Salt, who was at his attacking best, smashing PBKS bowlers all around the park. The winning six came off skipper Rajat Patidar's bat.Punjab Kings will now face the winner of Gujarat Titans vs Mumbai Indians in Qualifier 2, while RCB will enjoy a break and wait to play the final on June 3.","Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) beat Punjab Kings (PBKS) by six wickets.

After powering Royal Challengers Bengaluru into their first IPL final since 2016 with an unbeaten 56 off just 27 balls, Phil Salt offered a candid and composed post-match reflection.His whirlwind knock helped RCB cruise past Punjab Kings' modest 101-run total in just 10 overs, sealing an emphatic eight-wicket victory in Qualifier 1 at Mullanpur.Salt, who smashed six fours and three sixes on a surface where no other batter looked in control, revealed a personal subplot that drove his calculated aggression. “Don’t get out to Arshdeep — that was the only thing on my mind,” he said with a smile. “We played two group games with PBKS and he’s got me out in different ways. Today, it was just about reacting to the ball.”While many viewed RCB’s disrupted travel schedule as a disadvantage, Salt framed it differently. “I told Andy (Flower) before the game, maybe the travel and breaks were a blessing in disguise. This win gives us momentum. It’s a cliché, but it’s what you want at the back end of a tournament.”Quiz: Who's that IPL player?

Kohli, known for wearing his heart on his sleeve, was seen celebrating animatedly after Josh Hazlewood dismissed Punjab Kings captain Shreyas Iyer for just 2 runs off 3 balls.It was a crucial breakthrough in the early stages of the innings. Hazlewood, brought into the playing XI in place of Nuwan Thushara, made an immediate impact. Bowling a hard length just outside off, Hazlewood extracted extra bounce off the deck.

With clenched fists, intense roars, and an animated reaction directed toward the RCB dugout and the crowd, Kohli’s energy lit up the stadium.Royal Challengers Bengaluru captain Rajat Patidar won the toss and elected to bowl first against Punjab Kings in Mullanpur.

NEW DELHI: Preity Zinta ’s cheerful smile quickly faded into visible concern as the Punjab Kings suffered a nightmarish start in their IPL 2025 Qualifier 1 clash against Royal Challengers Bengaluru. The co-owner of PBKS, who was initially spotted smiling and cheering from the stands, looked visibly tense as her team lost four crucial wickets inside the Powerplay — Priyansh Arya, Prabhsimran Singh, Shreyas Iyer , and Josh Inglis — all falling in rapid succession.The collapse began with Priyansh Arya’s dismissal. Trying to play a crisp drive off Yash Dayal, Arya ended up hitting the ball straight to Krunal Pandya at cover. It was a simple take, and Dayal gave RCB the early breakthrough they were looking for.Things got worse for PBKS in the next over. Veteran pacer Bhuvneshwar Kumar outsmarted Prabhsimran Singh, who attempted an aggressive charge down the track. The experienced bowler shortened the length just in time, forcing an edge that wicketkeeper Jitesh Sharma safely pouched. With both openers back in the pavilion, Preity Zinta’s concerned expressions were soon caught on camera.The pressure only mounted when captain Shreyas Iyer fell cheaply to Josh Hazlewood. Attempting a wild slog across the line, Iyer edged the ball to Jitesh Sharma, giving RCB their third wicket inside the first five overs. Hazlewood wasn’t done yet — he returned to dismiss Josh Inglis with a short ball that reared up awkwardly.Inglis's mistimed pull landed straight in the hands of Bhuvneshwar Kumar at long leg.As the wickets kept tumbling in Mullanpur, Preity Zinta’s stress was palpable.

During IPL-2025, when he was slaying the bowlers while scoring 640 runs in 14 matches-his best IPL season ever, India's T20 captain Suryakumar Yadav took out time from his busy schedule to attend the retirement function of his father Ashok Kumar Yadav at BARC (Bhabha Atomic Research Centre) in Chembur. Ashok Kumar Yadav worked as a scientist with BARC.Giving an emotional speech, which was also peppered with jokes that drew instant laughter from the audience-the employees of BARC- about his father, SKY said, ""This is a moment when a pre-decided speech or the phone won’t work. I'd like to share my experience (with him) of all these years. It seems as if a match is about to start! I just want to say one thing…when so many people get together for one man, and there's no place to even sit, people want to come inside (the auditorium) and see what's going on. So, that means dad, you must've done something well! You've showed us such good videos (messages for his father from his colleagues at BARC). I didn’t know that dad sings so well too, because he never sings at home! Maybe he would have sung something when I and my sister weren't there at home! I've never seen him sing. It felt really good to see this. Definitely, You've got a lot of time at your disposal now to entertain mom!”The 34-year-old joked that his father’s office colleagues would now have to call up his mother Swapna Yadav and seek his appointment if they wished to talk to him!In our world, they say that every beautiful journey has come to an end someday.So, this has also been your fairy-tale journey with your such good, lovely friends who love you so much, and it’s now coming to an end. However, we'll fully try to ensure that your second innings is even more beautiful and memorable than this. So many people have given such lovely speeches about dad here, and said that they will always remember dad. However, earlier you would call him directly to talk, but now you'll have to call up mom first to seek his appointment and talk to him!Talking about how his father was his idol growing up, Surya said, ""Growing up, you need a Superman-like figure to me, from whom you can learn a lot in life. Definitely, my father was that figure for me. He supported me from the beginning of my career journey. I had no idea what the future held for me. We've seen each and every day go by. He would get up early in the morning for me, make my dabbas (tiffin box), drop me to school and college, so that I won't bunk either! All these small things you don't tend to forget. Like how we play a first-class match from 9am to 5am, dad would go to the office in the morning and return home at 6pm. Even if anything would happen in the office, a tiff or something, he would never bring it home. There were many such things that I learnt from him. Like you guys said, he would treat everyone in the office equally. I've imbibed all these qualities from him. I just want to wish him all the best for his second innings with us. Now you can give us all the time that you can. Definitely, now mom too, who's his pillar of strength, will get to spend more time with him. I just want to say: 'Comon, let's go home!""Surya also posted an emotional tribute to his father on Instagram as he retired, thanking him for the work he put into him and the family. The Mumbai Indians batter shared a picture of him with his family and expressed his love and appreciation. Suryakumar described his father as a “simple man who left no stone unturned to give us an extraordinary life,” reflecting on what his father taught him through his values and his strength.“To my first and forever hero, role model, life manual, and guide… an important innings finishes for you and every time you have played a role, you have hit it out of the park,” Suryakumar said and paid tribute to the work his dad put in, “Time to gear up for your next innings, dad, a tad less important one.” The post was well-received and flooded with love and congratulations by fans and cricketers.","Suryakumar Yadav attended the retirement function of his father Ashok Kumar Yadav at BARC (Bhabha Atomic Research Centre) in Chembur.

The Mumbai Indians (MI) have once again showcased their resilience, securing a spot in the IPL 2025 playoffs. Spearheaded by the indomitable Suryakumar Yadav and bolstered by a formidable bowling lineup, MI's campaign has been a blend of brilliance and challenges.Suryakumar Yadav has been the linchpin of MI's batting, amassing an impressive 640 runs this season. In doing so, he surpassed Sachin Tendulkar's long-standing record of 618 runs in a single season for MI, set in 2010. His consistency and flair have been pivotal in anchoring the team's batting efforts. Trent Boult has led the bowling attack with 19 wickets, providing crucial breakthroughs in the powerplay overs.

IPL 2025: What went wrong for Lucknow Super Giants?





The Gujrat Titans may not have the glitz of some other franchises, but have once again proven that cricket is a team game. With smart roles, ruthless top-order batting, and an emerging bowling core, GT marched into the IPL 2025 playoffs.But just when it mattered most, two of their biggest names—Jos Buttler and Kagiso Rabada—have exited the tournament for national duty. The Eliminator now looks a lot more daunting.GT’s batting this season was beautifully top-heavy. Shubman Gill and Sai Sudharsan opened the innings with composure and aggression, setting the tone in nearly every game. Then came Jos Buttler at No. 3, blending power and experience with finishing finesse.In multiple matches, at least one of these three batted deep into the innings, shielding the middle order and ensuring smooth run-chases or defendable totals.With Buttler gone, that smooth engine now has a missing piston.The flip side of top-order dominance? The middle order is largely unproven under pressure. Players like Shahrukh Khan,Rahul Tewatia, and haven’t had many chances to play match-defining knocks.In a high-stakes Eliminator, GT will need at least one of them to step up.The real breakout star in Gujarat’s camp this season has been Prasidh Krishna . After a quiet 2024, he’s roared back to form—23 wickets in 14 games at 7.91 economy, currently second on the Purple Cap leaderboard. His pace and death-over accuracy have anchored GT’s bowling plans.Quiz: Who's that IPL player? Adding to the firepower is R Sai Kishore, the crafty left-arm off-spinner who’s had a dream season. His 17 wickets have come at key moments—especially in middle overs where he’s throttled opposition momentum.With Kagiso Rabada also heading back to South Africa, Gujarat lose their pace spearhead. Though he didn't dominate the wickets chart, Rabada’s experience and early breakthroughs made a big difference. Without him, Krishna will shoulder a bigger load—and GT may have to rely on Azmatullah Omarzai or uncapped options.GT’s campaign included highlight wins—like the 10-wicket demolition of Delhi Capitals, strong performances against RCB and SRH, and a strategic win over Mumbai Indians . But they’ve also been involved in a few high-scoring losses that exposed some bowling gaps.Still, 8 wins from 14 games is no small feat in a packed season.Gujarat Titans' results from their 14 league-stage matches in IPL 2025:1. Match 5 vs Punjab Kings (25 Mar) – Lost by 11 runs2. Match 9 vs Mumbai Indians (29 Mar) – Won by 36 runs3. Match 14 vs Royal Challengers Bengaluru (2 Apr) – Won by 8 wickets4.

NEW DELHI: The googly proved to be Suyash Sharma’s deadly weapon as he helped Royal Challengers Bengaluru secure a commanding eight-wicket victory over Punjab Kings in Qualifier 1 at the Maharaja Yadavindra Singh International Cricket Stadium, propelling RCB into the IPL 2025 final. The leg-spinner credited some assistance from the worn pitch for his success.In a remarkable spell of 3-17, Suyash dismantled Punjab’s lower order by taking the wickets of Shashank Singh, Musheer Khan, and Marcus Stoinis in quick succession. His efforts ensured PBKS were bundled out for a mere 101 runs in just 14.1 overs. RCB comfortably chased down the target in exactly 10 overs, marking their first IPL final appearance since 2016.“I have performed well, that’s why everyone is happy for me. My coaches gave me just one role, which was to hit the stumps, whether I bowl leg-break, googly, flipper, or any other variation. I just try to finish all my percentage balls on the stumps,” said Suyash.He added, “It (googly) is my stock ball, and also I got a bit of help from the wicket as well, so that’s why many weren’t able to pick it up. Not quite now (whether he will be celebrating tonight), I will celebrate on the 3rd (June) and very hard as well,” during the post-match presentation.Chasing the modest total, opener Phil Salt dazzled with his stroke play, scoring a quickfire 23-ball fifty—his fastest in the IPL—and remained unbeaten on 56 off 27 balls. Reflecting on the match, Salt said that the short turnaround between their last league match and the qualifier worked in their favor.“Great feeling right now, it (the ball) did move a bit. I think that was not the worst wicket to have played on this season. (Replying to what was going on in his mind during the chase) Don't get out to Arshdeep, we played two group games (with PBKS) and he's found different ways to get me out, so I was just trying to react to the ball.”He concluded, “I said before the game to Andy (Flower) that it was a blessing in disguise for us. (This win) Gives us the momentum, it is a cliche but true, that's what you want at the backend of the tournament, want to hit your straps and play a part with the bat or ball.”","Royal Challengers Bengaluru beat Punjab Kings by eight wickets in IPL Qualifier 1.

NEW DELHI: Royal Challengers Bengaluru stormed into their first Indian Premier League final since 2016 with a commanding eight-wicket win over Punjab Kings in a one-sided Qualifier 1 on Thursday. Punjab’s ultra-aggressive batting strategy backfired, as they were bowled out for just 101 in 14.1 overs by a relentless RCB bowling attack.Despite having made it to the IPL final on three previous occasions (2009, 2011, and 2016), RCB are still chasing their maiden title. On this occasion, they took a giant step closer by chasing down the modest target in just 10 overs, led by a blazing unbeaten half-century from opener Phil Salt (56* off 27).With an all-round performance that ticked nearly every box, RCB cruised into the title clash scheduled for June 3 in Ahmedabad.Reflecting on the performance after securing the final berth, RCB captain Rajat Patidar said:""I think we were clear in our plans, how we have to bowl. I think the fast bowlers used the surface really well. The way Suyash chipped in, the way he bowled his lines and lengths, that was really good.""""As a captain I am clear about his bowling. He has to target the stumps, that's his strength. His wrong 'un is difficult to read for the batters.

We have had a lot of practice sessions throughout the tournament, so one day of not practising won't harm you.""The way he (Salt) is batting in most of the matches. The way he is giving starts, I am a big fan of him. It's a treat to watch him from the dugout. That's really good.

IPL 2025: What went wrong for Delhi Capitals?

Paris, May 29, 2025 -Khvicha Kvaratskhelia has already played a part in denying Inter Milan the Serie A title this season, and the Georgian is now hoping to get the better of them again with Paris Saint-Germain in Saturday's Champions League final.The 24-year-old Kvaratskhelia moved to Paris in January from Napoli for a reported 70 million euros ($79.2m) plus bonuses.He is set to have a key role to play for Luis Enrique's side against Inter in Munich, despite missing last weekend's French Cup final victory over Reims as a precaution due to a minor fitness issue.Perhaps he had been up late the previous night celebrating his former club's Serie A triumph, as Napoli pipped Inter to the Scudetto in their final game of the season.Napoli's second Italian league championship in three campaigns was claimed despite 'Kvara', one of the stars of their title in 2023, leaving the team in the middle of the season.Instrumental two years ago when he earned the nickname 'Kvaradona' at the club where Diego Maradona is an icon, he played a pivotal part in the early weeks of this season under Antonio Conte, scoring five goals in the first 10 Serie A games -- only four Napoli players finished the campaign with more goals, including Scott McTominay.Kvaratskhelia can therefore claim an Italian league winner's medal for this season as well as one for Ligue 1 for his contribution towards PSG's cruise to the domestic title.However, his transfer to PSG has really aided the French side in Europe, where the extra competition for places in attack has helped bring the best out of fellow forwards Ousmane Dembele, Bradley Barcola and Desire Doue.The left-winger who loves to play with his socks rolled down around his ankles also fits perfectly into coach Luis Enrique's system, which demands that the attackers do their bit to help the team defensively.""He is perfectly adaptable to our way of playing. He is versatile. He can go past players and he can also defend which is essential because we need to be able to defend as 11 players and attack as 11 players,"" Luis Enrique said in January.""He fits into our idea of how to play football.""- Key for PSG already -Kvaratskhelia has so far contributed six goals and six assists in 24 appearances for PSG, including one magnificent strike against Aston Villa in the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final and the pass to set up Dembele's winning goal away to Arsenal in the semis.PSG had already started to turn a corner following a sluggish start this season when the former Rubin Kazan player arrived, but Luis Enrique is convinced Kvaratskhelia's presence has been essential in his team getting to Munich.""If you analyse in depth how we have improved defensively, it comes down to the way the attackers help out. The way they defend is exceptional, and the statistics show how many balls they recover for us,"" the coach said last week.The PSG boss still faces a difficult decision over which one of his four main attackers to leave out of the front three on the night -- 33-goal top scorer Dembele is certain to start, meaning one of the in-form Doue or the lively Barcola will have to drop to the bench if Kvaratskhelia is to be in the starting XI.But his experience of playing Inter could be invaluable, even if Simone Inzaghi's side fared well when they came up against him at Napoli.Kvaratskhelia won just once in six clashes against the Nerazzurri with his former club, and has never scored against them.""Technically he's a special player so it won't be easy,"" insisted Denzel Dumfries, Inter's Dutch right wing-back who is likely to be in direct opposition to Kvaratskhelia on the night.Can Inter this time be celebrating at his expense or will Kvaratskhelia get his hands on another winner's medal on Saturday?",Khvicha Kvaratskhelia is set to start for Paris Saint-Germain in Saturday's Champions League final against Inter Milan.

Paris Saint-Germain coach Luis Enrique, who took charge in July 2023 following the departures of Lionel Messi and Neymar, has transformed the team into a formidable force ahead of this weekend's Champions League final. The 55-year-old Spanish manager has revived his reputation after being dismissed by Spain post their 2022 World Cup exit, molding PSG into one of Europe's most feared sides despite the challenge of replacing departing superstar Kylian Mbappe Luis Enrique arrived at PSG during a period of transition, with the club moving away from its star-studded attacking trio of Messi, Neymar, and Mbappe, who were known for their limited defensive contributions.The departure of Messi and Neymar, followed by Mbappe's impending exit, allowed Luis Enrique to implement his vision for the team.PSG president Nasser al-Khelaifi acknowledged this shift in philosophy early in the season, stating: ""We are in the middle of building a new identity, our own style and way of playing, and a new culture."" He added that winning the Champions League was no longer ""something we are obsessed with.""In his first season, Luis Enrique led PSG to a domestic league and cup double, along with reaching the Champions League semi-finals before losing to Borussia Dortmund.Despite Mbappe's imminent departure, Luis Enrique remained confident about the team's future. ""If everything goes well I'm convinced we'll have a much better team than this year,"" he said in February 2024.The Spanish coach's tactical approach emphasizes possession-based football and aggressive pressing, though some critics, including former player Iago Aspas, have questioned his flexibility. ""Luis Enrique had a very clear game plan, and when plan A didn't work, there was no plan B,"" Aspas remarked.Quiz: Who's that IPL player? Early season struggles and a defeat to Bayern Munich in November threatened PSG's Champions League campaign. When questioned about his tactics after losing to Arsenal, Luis Enrique responded: ""I have no intention of explaining my tactics to you. You wouldn't understand.""The team's transformation has been remarkable since then, with impressive victories over Manchester City, Liverpool, Aston Villa, and Arsenal.Luis Enrique successfully converted winger Ousmane Dembele into a prolific scorer, with 33 goals this season, proving his decision to play without a traditional striker effective.The coach, who previously won the Champions League with Barcelona in 2015, now stands on the brink of joining an elite group of managers who have won the trophy multiple times.Reflecting on his past success, Luis Enrique said: ""Getting to a Champions League final is always difficult. All players and coaches dream of it, but not everyone gets there. The job I did at Barca was extraordinary. Even if people said it was easy to win the Champions League with that team, it wasn't.""Between his Barcelona tenure and PSG appointment, Luis Enrique managed Spain twice, taking a break in 2019 following his daughter Xana's death from bone cancer.Drawing from these experiences, he believes he's evolved as a coach. ""I have more experience now. I remember before my first final I was really stressed,"" he shared. ""This time I hope to transmit a message of calm. Otherwise I think I have learnt from my mistakes and that has helped me get where I am now.""",Luis Enrique has transformed Paris Saint-Germain into one of Europe's most feared sides.

And now, with Chhetri stepping back onto the international stage after ‘retirement’, Venkatesh voices a deep-seated disappointment. The man who once cleared the path for Chhetri is left wondering why Indian football isn’t doing the same for those waiting in the wings.“Two decades ago, I told a senior player to hang up his boots so a young Sunil Chhetri could rise,” Venkatesh, who is currently the technical director at FC Madras, told TOI. “But now, Chhetri breaking his retirement to come back is bad news for Indian football. It’s demotivating for all the young players. I’m not blaming Chhetri. He will play only one or two matches. But if you bring a youngster and back him now, he will give 10 years.“Indirectly, we are sending a message to everyone that we don’t have players. We are seeing that a lot of grassroots programme have come and there are a lot of tournaments. Still, we are depending on the 40-year-old striker?”Venkatesh, a former assistant coach of the India senior team, didn’t mince words on the chaos surrounding head coach Manolo Marquez, who had a dual role while coaching FC Goa and the national team.“We are going 20 years back,” the star midfield of his time bluntly said. “We have done this before. We failed when Armando Colaco was coach for both Dempo and the national team (in 2011). We have to bring a permanent coach. I respect all the coaches, including Manolo. But which coach will think about Indian football and take risks for it? That’s a big question.”Venkatesh, who holds an AFC Pro Licence, explained the differences between coaching a club and steering a national team and how each demands a separate mindset and level of commitment.“Thanks to the ISL (Indian Super League), they brought a lot of attention to football in India. But when you play in the ISL, the Indian players will play only against four foreigners. When we go for international games, you have to face eleven foreigners. The temperament is completely different. You can’t compare ISL and international football. Tomorrow, if you play against a team like Korea, you need solid preparation. It’s true Manolo has done well as an ISL coach and that’s why AIFF thought he knew Indian football well. But international football is something different,” said Venkatesh.So, what’s the way forward? For Venkatesh, it starts with looking beyond the obvious. “I feel this is high time that Indian football bosses think seriously about building a second layer. There has to be a Team ‘A’ and a Team ‘B’. Fill Team B with young players, give them time and space to grow. The only thing that separates a star from the rest is opportunity. And when there’s pressure for places in the first team, it naturally brings out the best in players,” the 46-year-old said.Venkatesh is optimistic about the current bunch of Indian players. “I can see that the current Indian players, in terms of technique and physicality, are very strong. If you see all the players, all the positions, you can see aggression. Indian football is more aggressive now,” said Venkatesh.Venkatesh also pointed out that there is a lack of a proper bridge between youth and senior levels. “I feel we should concentrate more on the under-21 category, then only you will get a strong core for the future. There’s a big gap post the under-19 level. Players are jumping straight into the senior team without proper progression. The under-21 level is the backbone of Indian football,” he said.",Venkatesh Shanmugam says Indian football needs to build a second layer. The former India captain is disappointed by the decision of Sunil Chhetri to return to the national team. He also believes there is a lack of a proper bridge between youth and senior levels.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121448443,imgsize-802088,width-400,resizemode-4/121448443.jpg"

More Than a Team: The Rise of CSK & the Whistle Podu Army

Chelsea were once one of Europe's most well-run clubs under their former owner Roman Abramovich, with a focus on shrewd transfer dealings and value creation. There was specific emphasis on signing proven campaigners, which paid off handsomely, with the Blues winning two Champions League titles as well as five Premier League trophies. However, Abramovich was forced to sell the club to a consortium led by American billionaire Todd Boehly, turning things upside down. Financial wisdom went out the window, with players purchased at immensely extravagant sums. A recent UEFA report stated that Chelsea spent almost two billion euros in transfer fees from 2020 to 2024, terming the club's 2024 squad as ""the most expensive ever assembled.""Close to 39 transfers have been completed in just two years, resulting in fans and experts terming the decision-making ""madness."" Boehly's stint drew controversy early on following the decision to sack the club's 2021 Champions League-winning manager Thomas Tuchel. The billionaire picked ex-Brighton manager Graham Potter as a replacement, which failed miserably, as Chelsea finished 12th in the 2022/23 season after a third-place finish. Former Tottenham Hotspur manager Mauricio Pochettino also failed to transform fortunes, leading to yet another managerial vacancy.While pundits expected Boehly to re-appoint Tuchel, the billionaire took an unprecedented decision by handing over charge to ex-Leicester City manager Enzo Maresca at the start of the 2024/25 season. The decision seemed quite brazen, considering Maresca had no formal Premier League experience as a manager. While the transfer merry-go-round continued under Maresca, with 11 new players signed including Jadon Sancho, the Italian manager developed a robust system around young and hungry players.Maresca faced a tough start to his stint, as the Blues conceded easy goals in friendlies and suffered a loss in their opening PL match against Manchester City. However, the Italian took a leaf out of his former boss Pep Guardiola's playbook by retaining self-belief amid pressure. Moises Caicedo, Enzo Fernandez, Cole Palmer, and Levi Colwill formed the core of the setup, with Maresca placing trust in Nicolas Jackson despite the striker's inexperience. There was also heavy focus on versatility to catch the opposition unawares, with full-backs Marc Cucurella and Malo Gusto inverting into midfield.""Maresca picked the two best players for every position with emphasis on versatile players like Gusto who can play either as a right-back or a central midfielder,"" said Spanish football manager Mario Rivera.Chelsea dominated proceedings in the season's first half with fast, fluid, and explosive football, smashing goals for fun. While Palmer had already developed a reputation as a game-changer, emerging players like Noni Madueke also made their presence felt, as evident from the latter's 14-minute hat-trick against Wolves.""The main tactical change in the Chelsea setup is the numeric superiority in the central channel. While attacking, they operate in a 3-2-2-3 formation with four midfielders, offering greater control. The high-press system gives Chelsea a chance to play far off the goalpost with much more balance for transitions,"" stated Rivera.Chelsea were well in contention for the league title until December after jumping to the second spot, resulting in fans chanting, ""We have our Chelsea back."" However, injuries to crucial players like defender Wesley Fofana and Jackson, as well as Mykhailo Mudryk's long-term suspension, impacted results over a crucial two-month period, pushing Maresca into a spot of bother. While experts stated that opponents had figured out the Italian's gameplay, there were also question marks over the system's intensity, resulting in fatigue.Three wins in 12 matches between December 22 and February 22 pushed Chelsea to sixth place, resulting in heavy criticism over the quality of recruitment. However, Maresca's 'band of brothers' kept marching on, with Champions League qualification coming down to their final Premier League match against Nottingham Forest — who had been brilliant themselves. Colwill stepped up in this crucial encounter, vindicating the Italian manager's faith by scoring the winner.Maresca's brilliance enabled Chelsea to qualify for the Champions League for the first time since Boehly's takeover, recording the feat with the youngest average line-up in Premier League history — 24 years and 36 days. ""The doubt was from outside. Critics were saying that we were not able to win because we are too young and inexperienced. F**k off to all of them,"" said the Italian manager in a no-holds-barred retort after a league season which has revived Chelsea's flagging fortunes.","Chelsea were once one of Europe's most well-run clubs, with a focus on shrewd transfer dealings and value creation.

Watch the infamous collision of the first ever Formula E race in Beijing

What Nick Heidfeld said after the crash



What saved Nick Heidfeld

The Beijing E-Prix, held in 2014, was the first-ever Formula E race. It didn’t just grab attention for being a high-speed electric car event styled like Formula 1 — it became widely talked about due to a mind-numbing collision between Venturi’s Nick Heidfeld and e.dams Renault’s Nicolas Prost. Both drivers were chasing the historic opportunity to become the first winner in a fully-electric single-seater race but ended up smashing into each other. Here's everything about what led to that infamous crash — and what saved Heidfeld as his car somersaulted before crashing head-first into the ground. Also, see what the driver had to say after the incident.The crash happened at the final corner on the last lap. As Nick Heidfeld made a move to take the lead, Nicholas Prost steered across the track to defend. When their cars made contact, Heidfeld’s front-right suspension broke, sending his car out of control. He wasn’t able to slow down and hit a kerb, went airborne, and slammed into the barrier. Miraculously, Heidfeld walked away unharmed and immediately went over to Prost to talk about the incident.rost was given a 10-place grid penalty for the following race, while Lucas Di Grassi went on to win the Beijing E-Prix.A day before the Shanghai E-Prix, Formula E shared the video of the infamous crash on Instagram, captioned: “Drama from the very start! Our first-ever race in 2014 ended with a huge incident in Beijing!”Formula E fans were shocked watching the replay. “What on earth was that move!!!!” asked one fan. Another commented, “Did he get charged with attempted murder? Awful move.” One more added, “It was Epic start of the sport. I was shocked watching this live. And it was before the Halo.” Several also pointed out the lack of a halo — a safety device introduced years later: “Wtf, they should have halos on those things that coulda been deadly,” read one comment.Nick Heidfeld, however, chose to focus on the positives, though he admitted he was lucky to be unharmed. Speaking to Formula E’s YouTube channel after the crash, he said: “I think more about the chance I had here last year, how good the car worked, and that I could have won, rather than about the crash. Of course you see it all the time everywhere and people speak about it and for me it was quite easy to cope with because I was simply lucky that nothing happened. ”He added: “It's maybe not the perfect reason to have people tuning in but it was still fantastic to get a lot of attention for the championship and I think after that a lot of people kept watching it because it's not only the crash but as the following races did show they were all exciting races you never know who's gonna win and it was good in the end for the championship.”Also Read: Countdown to Shanghai E-Prix begins as special trophies and soundtrack unveiled for Formula E double header The roll hoop in Heidfeld’s Venturi car protected his head when the vehicle landed upside down. This component had been tested to withstand a nine-tonne vertical force before the electric cars hit the track.

Stoffel Vandoorne shares their strategy for Tokyo race

It cannot be just a coincidence that Maserati MSG Racing driver Stoffel Vandoorne started from the 14th position on the grid and went on to win the Tokyo E-Prix Round 8. He even managed to beat Nissan’s Oliver Rowland, who had started from pole. Vandoorne shined while others struggled with poor visibility, a slippery track, and grip issues as it rained cats and dogs during the Tokyo race. Not only that, he also recovered from a spin on the wet track to cross the finish line first. The Tokyo winner says it’s all because of how their plan fell in place to perfection.Stoffel Vandoorne revealed that their winning strategy involved a calculated risk of taking the Pit Boost early in the race, which could have worked in their favor if there had been a race stoppage, allowing them to save time during the gap.""It was not an easy race, but a lot of opportunities with the rain and the management. We kind of gamble a little bit with our strategy but it was also calculated at the same time. The plan perfectly played in our hands, and the chances of this happening in Formula E are very, very slim,” Vandoorne told Formula E in an interview.""It was difficult because I had to manage so many things. I was on the radio with my engineer in between laps and he was giving me advice on the gap that I had to Oliver (Rowland) to make sure I was safe enough with my energy.I was struggling, and I was down to 10% at some point and I had to bring the car home so there was a lot of management to do,"" he added.Vandoorne moved to Maserati MSG Racing last season and is in love with his new team. Talking about the same, he said, ""I’m just happy for the team, for myself, it’s been a little while. They are such a good group of people, some familiar faces from the past as well, their vibe is super cool, their base is Monaco and that is my home as well.

Not only is he leading the Formula E Driver Standings, but he has also won four of the nine races in the current season. Rowland has now said it all feels like a dream—and at times, he even feels the need to wake up from it. He also spoke about getting emotional after seeing his daughter following his fourth win of the season at the Tokyo E-Prix Round 9.It was a heartwarming sight to watch Oliver Rowland stand on the podium in Tokyo with his daughter Harper. Reflecting on the moment, the Nissan driver told Formulae.com, ""I was already tired after qualifying. I was feeling pretty stressed with everything. There was a lot of pressure to go through. I was looking forward to the race being over, to be honest, and when it was over... when I saw her face I just couldn't help but be super emotional.""[The atmosphere] was amazing. I didn't realise how many people were here until I stood on the podium, so it was a really special moment for me and the team. Honestly, sometimes I feel like I need to wake up from the dream that I'm living at the moment,"" he added.After finishing second in the Round 8 race the day before, Rowland lifted the winner’s trophy in Round 9 on Sunday—despite starting from sixth on the grid. He admitted to doing a “poor job” in the first half of the race, which saw TAG Heuer Porsche driver Pascal Wehrlein finishing in second place.Speaking about beating Wehrlein to take the victory, Rowland revealed, ""Pascal was pushing pretty hard in the 350[kw], so to follow him was quite difficult. I knew I was just going to get one chance, and I had to make it count. I think there was about a car's-width gap, and it closed as I was in it! I think I was touching the wall and him at some point. He was hard, but I like racing like this. People complain about it: sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't, and I think it was just an excellent bit of racing, to be honest.

Poll What do you think contributed most to Abhinav Tejrana's success in Goa? Support from family Opportunities in local tournaments Coaching and mentorship in Goa

A ‘Tejrana’ from Delhi plying his trade for Goa in the Ranji Trophy seems bizarre.""I am not playing as a professional for Goa. I am a local,"" Abhinav Tejrana clarifies in a freewheeling chat with TimesofIndia.com from Porvorim.The 24-year-old top-order batter has set the Ranji Trophy on fire. Batting at No. 3 for Goa, the Delhi-born cricketer has amassed 651 runs in eight innings, including a double century on his first-class debut against Chandigarh. He has also smashed two centuries against Punjab and Saurashtra, and not to forget his match-saving unbeaten 73 against Karnataka.Abhinav, who has played U-19 cricket for Delhi, was given the cold shoulder by the Delhi & District Cricket Association (DDCA) selectors. The thought of quitting the game initially crossed Abhinav's mind in 2021, but his father Anil Kumar, a Delhi Government employee, put his arm around his son's shoulder and said: ""There's always a smile on your face whenever you pick up a bat. Never lose that, keep believing.""Tejrana vividly recollects the advice he received from his father, and in 2022, he decided to move to Goa to take care of a ""guest house""—a property his father had invested in years ago—and also in a quest to find a second home.""Actually, I wasn't playing for 2–3 years in Delhi. I last played in under-19. And then for 2 years, I didn't play for DDCA. So I decided to shift. I had some business in Goa and residence here, so it kind of made my decision easier,"" shares Abhinav.""I started playing the local tournaments and leagues in Goa. From there onwards, I started giving trials for the Goa Cricket Association (GCA). Then I played under-23 last season and was also in the Ranji Trophy camp. This year, finally, I made my Ranji Trophy debut,"" he says.Abhinav found his second home in Goa, but it came at an emotional cost.""I am playing as a local here. My father works in the Delhi government, so he is based in New Delhi. My sisters and most of my family live in Delhi. My mother decided to stay with me,"" says an emotional Abhinav.""I had a lot of people to support me. My family always believed in me, encouraged me to keep going. They always believed in my potential.""In the initial days in Goa, many local people also backed me. So I kept going on. It is always tough to work hard when you don't know whether it is going to happen or not. But it is important to keep going and have that faith,"" he says.I have always felt at home here in Goa, and most of the credit goes to the GCA. They have helped me a lotThe faith definitely worked wonders for Tejrana as he not only found a home in Goa but his exploits have also helped Goa punch above their weight.""I have always felt at home here in Goa, and most of the credit goes to the GCA. They have helped me a lot. Chetan Desai sir, Vinod Phadke sir, who are the chiefs in Goa, the secretary Tulsidas (Shetye) sir and President Mahesh Desai sir, they have all backed me. And when I wasn't getting the opportunities, Vipul Phadke sir also encouraged me in my low times. Head coach Milap Mewada—how can I forget his name. I really want to thank all of them,"" Tejrana shows his gratitude.No. 3 in first-class cricket is probably the most crucial number to bat at, and the southpaw eased into the role seamlessly.""Actually, in red-ball cricket, the top 3 batters are mostly openers. In white-ball cricket, I don't know yet where I would bat. But I think growing up, I have played in most of the numbers. It's not like I have always opened. I have experience of playing in the middle order as well,"" he says.Talking about the season, the youngster, who will turn 25 in a month's time, rates his double hundred on Ranji debut as very special.""I think the first one was important because it gave us a good score on the board. And we were 3 down for 115. Then me and Lalit (Yadav) bhai had a 309-run partnership. That was very important for the team to have 7 points in the first game.""And after that, I think against Karnataka in Shimoga, they were going for the outright win. So we had to play in tough conditions. The ball was doing a lot. So to play those 46 overs out was helpful for the team. So those two were, I would say, helpful for the team to get some points,"" he says.Reflecting on the grind he went through after moving to Goa, he believes it made him a tough cookie.""I think it made me more of a complete player. I am still in the process, as there is a lot to learn. But I think having this experience of playing these matches was a bit new to me. But gradually playing in the Goa Premier League Division gave me a lot of experience. And the setup that the association has is really nice,"" he says.""We have a red-ball camp for 2–3 weeks, and I got to prepare very well for the red ball. So I didn't face any issues because I have been playing red-ball cricket for the last 3 months now. That helped me a lot,"" he adds.Goa is not known for cricket; it has a rich history in football. But Abhinav feels things are changing.""Currently the pool of cricketers in Goa is not that big. But I think the way the leagues are conducted, they are far better. Because I have never played a three-day match in the Delhi leagues. There are no days matches there. So the type of tournament that they conduct here in Goa, I think, is much better. The structure of leagues and trials and camps—I think they have a structure that is more player-friendly. And surely you will see more young guys at under-19 level coming through the ranks because they have such a structure that is bound to improve players and produce quality players,"" he says.Abhinav's eyes are set on the upcoming Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy, and he wants to continue playing cricket with a smile on his face, as he promised his father a couple of years ago.""I think I have always played cricket to enjoy. That is the most important thing. And that's what my father says to me. And that is my goal ultimately—to enjoy when I am playing on the field. I don't think that much about the runs, the performances. I have a game plan which I follow, and even if I get out executing my plans, I don't mind it,"" he says.",Abhinav Tejrana is the leading run scorer in Ranji Trophy Elite group. The Delhi-born cricketer has amassed 651 runs in eight innings. He has smashed two centuries against Punjab and Saurashtra. The 24-year-old was given the cold shoulder by the Delhi & District Cricket Association.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125514920,imgsize-42618,width-400,resizemode-4/abhinav-tejrana.jpg"

Travis Head’s whirlwind century seals victory

Australia’s commanding eight-wicket triumph over England in the first Ashes Test in Perth was more than just a dominant win — it rewrote record books, producing three rare feats not seen in over a century, with the match concluding in under two days.England’s batting woes were historic. Across both innings, they faced just 405 deliveries, their shortest combined total in a Test match since 1904. The visitors managed only 172 in the first innings and 164 in the second, marking just the third occasion in their history that a Test side has faced fewer than 410 balls.The collapse was abrupt and stark, underlining how even in the era of Bazball, England’s batting could crumble with shocking speed.Perth 2025 became the first Ashes Test in 100 years to finish in less than 48 hours, joining only a handful of historic matches from the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The last Ashes game to end this quickly was Nottingham in 1921.The match required just 847 deliveries, making it the shortest Ashes contest by balls bowled since the 19th century.Over 113 overs, fast bowlers dominated, claiming 30 wickets for 468 runs. Day one alone saw 19 wickets fall — the most in a single day in modern Ashes history. Mitchell Starc was the spearhead, taking 10 wickets in the match, including a career-best 7-58 in England’s first innings. On day two, he dismissed Zak Crawley , Joe Root, and Ben Stokes , while Scott Boland’s devastating post-lunch burst — three wickets in 11 balls — reduced England from 65-1 to 88-6. A stubborn 50-run partnership between Gus Atkinson (37) and Brydon Carse (20) was the only resistance before setting a target of 205.Australia promoted Travis Head to open in Khawaja’s absence, and he produced a counterattacking masterpiece. Head scored 123 off 83 balls, reaching his century in 69 deliveries — the fastest Ashes hundred by an opener. He struck 16 fours and four sixes, dismantling England’s short-ball strategy.Head fell with just 13 runs remaining, but Marnus Labuschagne (51*) finished the chase in style with a six, ensuring Australia’s eight-wicket victory and setting a new benchmark for rapid Ashes Test finishes.","Perth 2025 became the first Ashes Test in 100 years to finish in less than 48 hours, joining only a handful of historic matches from the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

Former England cricketer Geoffrey Boycott has criticised the England team following their loss in the first Ashes Test match against Australia in Perth, which concluded in just two days.Boycott expressed his views in his column for The Telegraph UK, titled ""I cannot take this stupid England team seriously anymore,"" where the 85-year-old criticised the team's approach.""Before this series started Ben Stokes told the world that any ex-player who criticised them or had a different opinion were ""has-beens"" because Test cricket had changed and the past was irrelevant.

Brainless batting and bowling lost England the match. A 40-run lead on a fast bouncy low scoring pitch was huge and with Ben Duckett and Ollie Pope together at one stage England were in charge at effectively 100 for one.

Guwahati: The ODI team for the South Africa series will be announced soon, and captain Shubman Gill will miss it. But it doesn't end there. The ODI captain may not play any cricket this year and may be back in action only next year against New Zealand.His neck injury is more serious than it looks, and one understands that it is a nerve injury. He has been given an injection, and according to a report, a copy of which is with TOI, his rehab will start after quite a few days.The team management wants him to be fit as soon as possible, but with the T20 World Cup just around the corner in February-March, they don't want to aggravate his injury.Hence, it is likely that he will miss the T20Is against South Africa as well and will be back in action in January against New Zealand.Gill is currently in Mumbai, where his fitness will be assessed by the BCCI medical team. It is likely that KL Rahul could be handed the captaincy on a stop-gap basis. Rishabh Pant is also one of the contenders, even though he has not been part of the ODI team for a while now. It will be interesting if the BCCI considers him for the leadership role in white-ball cricket.With Rohit Sharma and Yashasvi Jaiswal set to open, the third opener's slot will be vacant, and it may not be a bad idea to have Abhishek Sharma in the squad.Meanwhile, with Jasprit Bumrah likely to sit out the ODIs, the selection committee may look to include Akash Deep along with Prasidh Krishna, Harshit Rana, and Arshdeep Singh.Bowling coach Morne Morkel worked long and hard with Akash Deep with the white ball on Saturday, where the Bengal bowler seemed to be working on yorkers. It was a good indication that he may find a place in the squad.","Shubman Gill will miss the ODI series against South Africa.

Shubman Gill ruled out of South Africa ODIs; three captaincy candidates emerge

Guwahati: An Indian wristspinner working his way through a strong batting lineup on a good batting pitch on Day One of a Test match — the idea seems a page out of a long-forgotten novel we once cherished. In an age of raging turners where pitching the ball in the right areas gets you wickets, Kuldeep Yadav ’s performance (3-48) seemed like a breath of fresh air. The left-arm wrist spinner, since his debut in Dharamshala against Australia in a must-win Test in 2017, hasn’t always won the team management’s confidence to get a look into the first XI. Yet, whenever the chances have come, he has delivered.Three wickets for the day isn’t the greatest of returns if you go by the volume of wickets the fingers have got on Indian tracks over the last few years. But on Saturday, Kuldeep brought back memories of the art of guile, drift, and deception that once used to be part of Indian Test cricket.In 13 Tests that the left-arm wrist spinner has played in India, he has taken 57 wickets at a terrific average of 21.60. In the four that he has played away, the average is an even healthier 19.55, but all that he has got in eight years is 17 Tests. Anil Kumble , under whose coaching Kuldeep made his Test debut, beautifully explains why the left-arm spinner looked so good on a pitch where batting wasn’t very difficult.“On red-soil pitches like this one, Kuldeep generates bounce and gets the ball to go a little faster off the pitch. On black-soil pitches, the ball sometimes tends to go a little slower off the surface and Kuldeep ends up trying too hard to bowl faster. That sometimes leads to erring in length,” the master leg-spinner with 619 Test wickets said.Indian fielding coach Ryan ten Doeschate too underlined Kumble’s point, saying that “with a little more pace in the wicket, Kuldeep is slightly more effective in conditions like these. The finger spinners are going to come into it later on in the game. But certainly, in terms of strategy and how we wanted to set up the first day, it’s a real bonus for Kuldeep to get us a foothold,” ten Doeschate said.While Kuldeep had Ryan Rickelton nicking with a googly that left him, he induced a false shot off Wiaan Mulder with one that dipped on him. But the best of the day for Kuldeep was definitely the Tristan Stubbs wicket. The right-hander was well-settled, and Kuldeep got his drift going immediately when he came back for his new spell. Stubbs, looking for his half-century, nicked him to first slip.“It was definitely a better pitch than Eden. For Kuldeep to get a wicket, he had to get his drift going,” Stubbs said.",Kuldeep Yadav took 3-48 on Day One of the second Test against South Africa in Guwahati. The left-arm wrist spinner has taken 57 wickets at a terrific average of 21.60 in 13 Tests that he has played in India.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125514664,imgsize-126358,width-400,resizemode-4/ind-vs-sa-2nd-test-day-1.jpg"

Shreyas Iyer’s condition critical after suffering life-threatening injury in Sydney | Inside details

Pandya likely to play in T20Is vs SA

Mumbai: Despite showing signs of recovering well, India’s ODI batter Shreyas Iyer, who suffered a spleen laceration during the Sydney ODI against Australia on October 25, faces a lengthier spell on the sidelines and is likely to be ruled out of India’s home ODI series against New Zealand, which begins in Vadodara on January 11.As per a medical assessment of his injury, Iyer, who returned to India from Australia on November 16, will have to wait for a couple of months before resuming proper training. He also must follow a controlled rehabilitation roadmap.The India vice-captain is recovering from the abdominal injury he suffered during the ODI series against Australia.“In any splenic rupture, exercise and activities such as weight-training is allowed only after completion of two months following the injury. It would take him two-three weeks thereafter to regain full match fitness,” a source in the BCCI told TOI on Saturday.The 30-year-old will obviously miss India’s upcoming ODI series against South Africa.While he is not in contention for a berth in the 2026 T20 World Cup in February-March in India and Sri Lanka, Iyer may also not be in the selectors’ plans for that tournament as he won't be playing any competitive matches before then, even if he regains full fitness ahead of the event.“He should be fit for the T20 World Cup, but he may not play any competitive matches before that. The selectors will have to take a call on that,” the source told TOI.Iyer had landed awkwardly while completing a catch in the third ODI in Sydney on October 25.The BCCI later said he had sustained a blunt-force abdominal injury that caused a laceration to his spleen and resulted in internal bleeding. He subsequently underwent a minor procedure to control the bleeding and was later discharged once his condition stabilised.Since returning home, Iyer has been under the regular medical supervision of renowned sports medicine specialist Dr Dinshaw Pardiwala.Meanwhile, it’s learnt that India’s premier white-ball allrounder Hardik Pandya’s comeback from injury has been slightly delayed, and he is now likely to turn out in the T20I series against South Africa, which will start from December 8 in Cuttack.“Hardik was supposed to return to action in the ODI series against South Africa (starting November 30), but it was decided at the BCCI’s Centre of Excellence that it would be better for him to avoid the slightly heavier workload involved in the ODIs straightaway after returning from an injury. With the T20 World Cup approaching in a few months, it would be better if he returns in the shorter format first. He will feature in a few matches for Baroda in the Syed Mushtaq Ali T20 Trophy (starting November 26),” a source said.",Shreyas Iyer will have to wait for a couple of months before resuming proper training.

Trae Young and Shelby Miller’s private life behind the spotlight

Trae Young is one of the brightest point guards on the Atlanta Hawks and is known for his confident personality on the court. Away from basketball, he has always kept his personal life very warm and grounded. A big part of that stability comes from his wife, Shelby Miller, who has supported him since long before his NBA success began. Here’s a closer look at who she is and the story of their relationship.Shelby Miller grew up in Norman, Oklahoma, in a supportive family and completed her schooling in her hometown. Later, she attended the University of Oklahoma, where she studied Communication and Media. During her university days, Shelby wasn’t just focused on academics. She was a cheerleader for the Oklahoma Sooners, where she became well known for her energetic personality.Trae Young and Shelby Miller first met at the University of Oklahoma. At that time, Trae was becoming a rising basketball star for the Oklahoma Sooners. Their connection deepened during those college years, and they began dating in 2017, long before Trae made his NBA debut. Their relationship continued even after Trae was drafted by the Atlanta Hawks in 2018.In December 2021, Trae proposed to Shelby in a beautifully decorated setting filled with balloons and a glowing “Marry Me” sign. The couple later tied the knot on July 22, 2023, in an elegant wedding ceremony in the Bahamas, surrounded by family and close friends. Their journey together, from college sweethearts to life partners, reflects a relationship built on love, trust, and consistent support.Trae Young and Shelby Miller welcomed their first child, a son named Tydus Reign Young, on June 2, 2022. The couple often posts adorable family photos on social media, celebrating their special moments. In November 2023, the couple was blessed with their second child, a daughter named Teal Dove Young. Shelby regularly expresses her joy about motherhood and also praises Young for being a loving and devoted father.Although Shelby does not work in a public full-time profession, she is often seen supporting Trae at Hawks games and devotes most of her time to raising their children. She keeps a warm and low-key online presence and mainly posts about family life, celebrations, and special moments with her husband and their kids. Her role shows that she chooses a private life focused on family support rather than media attention.Also Read: ""Disappointed"" - Trae Young left waiting as Atlanta Hawks' silence on extension sparks NBA outrage","Shelby Miller grew up in Norman, Oklahoma, in a supportive family.

Pant steps in for a must-win game as India look to level the two-match series, which South Africa currently lead 1-0 following their memorable victory at Eden Gardens.Gill was released from the Test squad on Friday after failing to recover from the neck spasm he suffered while batting during the first innings of the Kolkata Test.The India captain was taken to the hospital for examination after the end of play on Day 2 and was kept under observation before being discharged the next day.“Team India captain Shubman Gill, who suffered a neck injury during the first Test against South Africa, has been ruled out of the second Test in Guwahati,” BCCI secretary Devajit Saikia said in a statement.Gill travelled with the team to Guwahati on November 19 but continued to experience discomfort, prompting the medical team to advise rest.“Unfortunately, he was not fully fit to feature in the 2nd Test and will head to Mumbai for further assessment,” the statement added.India batting coach Sitanshu Kotak had earlier underlined the risk of rushing Gill back, saying, “We don’t want recurrence of spasm during the game.”With Gill’s availability for the upcoming ODI series also uncertain, Pant now has the responsibility of leading India in a crucial encounter that could decide the fate of the series.: India vs South Africa, 2nd Test: Saturday, November 22, 2025: Barsapara Cricket Stadium, Guwahati9:00 AM ISTThe second Test match between India and South Africa will be played from November 22, Saturday.The second Test match between India and South Africa will be played at Barsapara Cricket Stadium in Guwahati.The second Test match between India and South Africa will start at 9:00 AM IST.

Poll Do you think India can perform well without Shubman Gill and Shreyas Iyer in the ODI series against South Africa? Yes, they have enough talent in the squad. No, losing both is a significant setback.

In a huge setback to Team India, ODI captain Shubman Gill will be unavailable for the three-match 50-over series versus South Africa, starting from November 30. With Shreyas Iyer already out of action for an extended period, India will be without their captain and vice-captain for the series.Gill, who flew to Mumbai from Guwahati on November 21, and is missing the second Test against South Africa, has been advised further rest by Dr Dinshaw Pardiwala. The 26-year-old is likely to be ready for the five-match T20I series against the same opposition from December 9. A fresh assessment will be done next week to check on his progress and chart the road ahead.""Unfortunately Gill will not be available for selection for the three ODIs vs South Africa. He has been advised more rest by the specialists and continues to be monitored by the BCCI medical team,"" said a BCCI official.In the absence of Gill and Iyer, the men's senior selection committee will have to assemble a stop-gap leadership group for the South Africa ODIs. The likes of KL Rahul Axar Patel and Rishabh Pant are likely to be in the mix when the selectors meet in Guwahati in the coming days.Pant hasn't been a regular feature in the ODIs but the management wants to recalibrate their approach in the format and there will be cautious effort to have some left-handers in the mix.The current ODI batting order is right-handed dominated and the decision makers want to inject some southpaws, who can change the tempo of the game. Both Pant and Tilak Varma could be in the mix for that No. 4 spot in absence of Iyer with Yashasvi Jaiswal expected to walk straight into the playing XI in place of injured Gill.India's top-six in Australia had Axar Patel as the only left-hander and the thinktank could explore some left-handed middle-order options. It could well mean a promotion for Washington Sundar too but the idea is to continue the left-right combination because regular top three - Shubman Gill, Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli - are all right-handers.On the bowling front, it will be interesting to see how selectors handle Jasprit Bumrah. It will make a lot of sense to rest India's spearhead and keep him ready for the T20Is. India need to freeze their combinations in the shortest format and every fixture before the T20 World Cup next year will allow them that opportunity.Bumrah has now featured in last four Tests the team has played and also played the five-T20I series vs Australia. He didn't play the ODIs vs Australia and a similar approach is likely to be followed for South Africa too.",Shubman Gill will miss the three-match ODI series against South Africa. The 26-year-old has been advised further rest by Dr Dinshaw Pardiwala. Shreyas Iyer is already out of action for an extended period.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125506848,imgsize-125644,width-400,resizemode-4/ind-vs-sa-1st-test-match.jpg"

England cricket captain Ben Stokes expressed shock following their defeat to Australia in the first Ashes Test, emphasising the need for quick recovery before their next match in Brisbane.England missed their chance to secure their first Test victory in Australia in 15 years, suffering a defeat within two days at Perth Stadium.The English team struggled against the bowling of Mitchell Starc and Scott Boland, while Travis Head's impressive 123 runs led Australia to an eight-wicket victory.""Little bit shell-shocked, it was pretty phenomenal from Head,"" Stokes said. ""It's pretty raw, pretty emotional, but that was some knock. We tried three or four different plans to get him, but when he's going like a train he's very hard to stop.""Stokes found some encouraging aspects in their performance, particularly noting their bowling in the first innings that restricted Australia to 132 runs.""The way in which we bowled yesterday was phenomenal. A lot happened on day one, a good day for the bowlers,"" he said. ""It's a tough one as we felt we were in control. We'll let this sink in, but we've got four more games.

So that's up to myself. It's up to some of the other senior guys who have a lot of experience in big series like these because you've got to let emotions like this sink in, and it has got to hurt. But also you've then got to get rid of them as quickly as you possibly can, while also learning from it.""Because when we get to Brisbane we need to be back up to that mindset of how we came into this game, still very confident of our abilities and achieving the goal.

Travis Head, serving as a makeshift opener, scored a rapid century off 69 balls to lead Australia to victory in the opening Ashes Test at Perth Stadium against England.Australia successfully chased down a target of 205 runs on day two, securing an eight-wicket win. Head scored 123 runs while Marnus Labuschagne remained unbeaten on 51 and Steve Smith on 2.""Wow, what a couple of days. It's been unbelievable,"" said Head. ""The emotions are pretty high.

Guwahati:

Agarkar needs to stop travelling abroad with team | Start watching domestic

It was the 79th over of the day and the light was fading fast across the Assam Cricket Association ground at Barsapara. Captain Rishabh Pant ran towards third man, where Jasprit Bumrah was fielding, and asked whether he was game for one final burst.Bumrah, who had already bowled 16 overs in the day, nodded ‘yes’ and the new captain took the new ball soon. With the fresh red cherry under floodlights, Bumrah came back and threatened the batters but didn’t get another wicket.As South Africa looked to end the day on a high, it was Mohammed Siraj, charging in from the other end, who stole the show late. Fading light, the light meter, the ball bouncing and moving a little more — everything suddenly came into the equation when left-hander Tony de Zorzi, who was looking immensely solid till then, nicked one. There was jubilation in the India camp, and when the stumps were drawn with South Africa at 247/6 three balls later, the visitors might have felt that they had let go of the upper hand they had battled so hard for through the opening day of the second Test here.The game, though, is pretty much in the balance on a red-soil pitch that is significantly better to bat on than Eden Gardens in Kolkata. There was initial carry and even bounce, and the only point of concern was that the ball didn’t come on to the bat.That was one of the reasons why Temba Bavuma (41), after looking well-settled, couldn’t time his uppish drive off Ravindra Jadeja early in the third session. The ball carried to Yashasvi Jaiswal at mid-off and the South African captain’s wicket helped India get a first foot in the door.But it could have happened much earlier in the day had KL Rahul , at second slip, not put down Aiden Markram off Bumrah when the score was 13. Within the first half-hour, the ball was doing a bit and Markram’s dismissal at that stage could have allowed India to control the proceedings in the first session after they lost the toss.Markram (38) and Ryan Rickelton (35) put their heads down, grafted and came close to playing out the potentially dangerous opening two hours of the day. Bumrah (1-38), though, had the last laugh when he got the ball to move back in the last over before lunch and Markram, trying an expansive off-drive, was bowled.Right after lunch, Kuldeep Yadav got into the action with his left-arm wrist spin. His googly left Rickelton, took the edge and Pant completed the catch. At 82-2, the anticipation for a few more grew, but it was Bavuma and Tristan Stubbs (49) who dug in. With no serious demons in the pitch, the duo put their heads down and battled for the runs, taking toll of the rare loose ball. While the Indian spinners, led by Kuldeep (3-48), kept it tight, Bavuma and Stubbs didn’t try to be adventurous either.In this age of frantic three-day matches, it felt like a good old day of Test cricket — a rarity these days in India, or perhaps all around the world as well. The spinners tried to out-think the batters while the South Africans showed patience, batting at a run rate of less than three in the session.The crowd, getting their first taste of Test cricket at home, did get impatient once in a while. But they were ready to wait for the Indian bowlers to provide them with some joy on a hot Saturday afternoon. Which they got once the final session started. After Jadeja dismissed Bavuma, Kuldeep got his drift going beautifully. He induced an edge off Stubbs (49) looking for a half-century and started looking seriously threatening. He got his pace right, rarely got the length wrong and was rewarded with Wiaan Mulder’s wicket, who failed to clear the inner ring looking for a shot in the air. And once de Zorzi was dismissed late on, there was some relief in the India camp. But no one seemed certain what a good score was.Later, while Stubbs seemed disappointed that no one carried on with the starts they got and that the Proteas are slightly short at the moment, Team India fielding coach Ryan ten Doeschate felt that the pitch can get difficult to bat on in the second innings. “I feel the wicket rarely determines who wins the game. If we’d played better in Kolkata, we could have won on that surface… So the first thing isn’t to look at the wicket, it’s to look at the quality of cricket we are playing,” the fielding coach said.",Jasprit Bumrah takes wicket of Aiden Markram in the last over before lunch.

England captain Ben Stokes delivered a sensational spell in the opening Ashes Test at Perth’s Optus Stadium, finishing with 5 for 23 from just six overs—the best bowling figures ever recorded by an England skipper in an Ashes Test played in Australia. His burst changed the course of Australia’s first innings.Stokes first broke a promising 45-run fifth-wicket partnership between Travis Head and Cameron Green, a stand that had lifted Australia from a precarious 31/4. He removed both batters in quick succession before going on to dismiss Alex Carey, Mitchell Starc, and Scott Boland.By doing so, Stokes became only the fifth England captain to claim a five-wicket haul in an Ashes Test in Australia, joining Gubby Allen (5/36, Brisbane 1936), Johnny Douglas (5/46, Melbourne 1912), Freddie Brown (5/49, Melbourne 1951) and Bob Willis (5/66, Brisbane 1982).The performance continued his impressive year with the ball: Stokes has now collected 25 wickets in six Tests at an average of 20.16, including two five-fors in 11 innings. Earlier in the year during the Anderson–Tendulkar Trophy against India at home, he took 17 wickets in four matches at 25.23, with best figures of 5/72, finishing as the third-highest wicket-taker in that series.Australia, resuming day two on 123/9 with Brendan Doggett (3) and Nathan Lyon (0), managed to chip away a few more runs, rotating strike where possible, before Ben Duckett took a sharp catch at gully to end the innings at 132 in 45.2 overs, leaving Australia 40 runs behind England’s first-innings total of 172.Stokes’ five-wicket haul was supported by a fierce pace display from Brydon Carse (3/45) and Jofra Archer (2/11). Their early strikes on day one had demolished the Australian top order, removing debutant opener Jake Weatherald (0), Marnus Labuschagne (9), Steve Smith (17) and Usman Khawaja (2) before Head and Green attempted to rebuild.With a 40-run lead, England began their second innings aiming to extend the advantage, but Mitchell Starc, who had already caused damage on day one, produced a spectacular one-handed catch to remove Zak Crawley for his second duck of the match, leaving England at 0/1 after 0.5 overs.From there, Ben Duckett (28) and Ollie Pope (24) settled things again, much as they did in the first innings, guiding England to 59/1 and stretching the lead to 99 runs by the end of the first session on day two.Day one had swung back and forth. After winning the toss and batting, England slipped to 39/3, despite a bright start from Duckett (21 off 20, 4 boundaries) and despite hopes resting on Joe Root, who fell for a duck to Starc. A half-century stand between Pope (46 off 58, 4 fours) and Harry Brook offered stability before England again stumbled to 115/5. Brook (52 off 61, 5 fours and a six) and Jamie Smith (33 off 22, 6 fours) counterattacked briefly, but Starc’s 7/58—assisted by Doggett’s 2/27—ended the innings swiftly with England bowled out for 172 in 32.5 overs, undermined further by some reckless shot selection.Brief scores:Australia 132 (Carey 26, Green 24; Stokes 5/23)England 172 & 59/1 (Duckett 28, Pope 24; Starc 1/13)","Ben Stokes takes five-wicket haul in first innings of first Ashes Test.

Poll Which team do you think has better chances of winning the Test after day one? India South Africa

India assistant coach Ryan ten Doeschate said the opening-day pitch in Guwahati aligned well with the team’s current home approach but maintained that the surface does not dictate Test results. India ended day one in a strong position after reducing South Africa to 247 for six in the second Test.“My personal point of view is that the wicket very rarely determines who wins the game. If we'd played better in Kolkata, I feel we could have won the Test on that surface,” ten Doeschate told reporters, reflecting on the series opener.He added that India’s preferred balance - of two quicks, a pace-bowling all-rounder and three spinners - fits the nature of the Barsapara Stadium track. “The template for us is probably closer to this, than playing on some of the wickets we have played on. You've got to be prepared to fight really hard and this game is going to go deep.”The former Netherlands captain did not hide his disappointment with the surface at Eden Gardens. “I thought it's a massive contrast from the Kolkata pitch, for one thing. We were expecting a better wicket. I thought it was pretty lifeless,” he said.At the same time, he noted that batting was not easy even in Guwahati. “.....but I've just heard Tristan Stubbs say that it was quite hard to score as well.I think it was just good old-fashioned Test cricket,” he added.South Africa’s innings was built on starts rather than big scores. Aiden Markram (38) and Ryan Rickelton (35) put on 82 before India struck twice. Temba Bavuma (41) and Tristan Stubbs (49) added 84, but both fell in the final session as the hosts tightened the screws.Kuldeep Yadav was central to India’s surge with 3 for 48, a performance ten Doeschate said suited the conditions. “We know Kuldeep's strike rate is phenomenal,” he said. “But maybe the fact that he sort of gets overspin and with the red soil and a little bit more pace in the wicket, maybe he was slightly more effective in the conditions today.”He expected the rest of India’s spin attack to feature more prominently later. “And like I said, I think later on, the finger spinners are going to come into it. But certainly… it's a real bonus for him to pick up three wickets and get us a foothold in the game.”The pitch, he said, had held up well so far. “There's some foot marks and some tiny ball marks, but nothing to suggest it's dry or cracking at the top. So fingers crossed that it lasts and plays well for the next few days.”Senuran Muthusamy (25*) and Kyle Verreynne (1*) will resume when play begins on day two.",Kuldeep Yadav took three wickets for India on day one of the second Test.

ISPL trials: 101 cities covered across India after 44 lakh registrations

In a concerted step towards professionalising grassroots cricket, the Indian Street Premier League (ISPL) has this season introduced the SET Score - an acronym for 'Speed & Endurance Test' designed to assess both physical fitness and mental stamina of players.This new test, which will be made compulsory for all players who reach the simulation-match phase, marks a significant shift in how the league evaluates talent.The SET Score is no ordinary time-trial. It blends high-intensity physical challenges with mental endurance tasks, meaning players are tested not just for sprint speed and lung-power but also for concentration, recovery and resilience under fatigue.As part of the test, players would need to undergo a mix of shuttle runs, obstacle work and decision-making drills.What makes this development particularly noteworthy is the message it sends to young cricketers across India’s informal circuits: talent alone may no longer be enough.The ISPL is signalling that modern cricket demands stamina, agility, and mental toughness from the earliest stages. For a competition that prides itself on discovery and opportunity, the SET Score adds a layer of professionalism to its talent-pathway.In practical terms, players now need to plan for much more than batting and bowling drills.

South Africa produced a statistical rarity on the opening day of the second Test, becoming the first team in Test history to see all of their top four score at least 35 without anyone reaching a fifty. The 'milestone' did little to prevent India from clawing back control, as the visitors closed on 247 for 6 in fading light.After choosing to bat, Aiden Markram and Ryan Rickelton set the tone with an 82-run stand. Markram battled for 38 off 81 balls in a cautious start, while Rickelton matched the tempo with 35 from 82. Both departed in the space of two overs — Jasprit Bumrah bowling Markram at the stroke of the first interval, and Kuldeep Yadav removing Rickelton soon after play resumed. Bumrah had earlier shown his frustration when KL Rahul dropped a straightforward chance at slip, with the bowler covering his face in dismay.South Africa steadied again through Tristan Stubbs and captain Temba Bavuma , who added 84 for the third wicket. Stubbs made 49 off 112, briefly lifting the tempo with two sixes, including one off Ravindra Jadeja, while Bavuma worked his way to 41 from 92 balls.Jadeja ended the partnership when Bavuma chipped to mid-off. Shortly afterwards, Kuldeep denied Stubbs his maiden fifty, drawing an edge to slip to energise the weekend crowd.Earlier, play had begun 30 minutes early due to the modified session timings at India’s newest Test venue. The crowd of over 15,000 watched India’s spinners gradually influence the day, with Kuldeep finishing at 3 for 48. He later removed Wiaan Mulder for 13 to deepen the slide before Mohammed Siraj struck with the second new ball, bouncing out Tony de Zorzi for 28.By stumps, Senuran Muthusamy was on 25 off 45 balls alongside wicketkeeper Kyle Verreynne on 1, after bad light forced an early close with 81.5 overs bowled.South Africa, holding a 1-0 lead after their 30-run win in Kolkata, will look to push past 300 on the second morning, while India aim to press home their late momentum.","South Africa produced a statistical rarity on the opening day of the second Test.

Delays and deadlines

Villarreal keep pace

A stunner from midfield

Barcelona marked its long-awaited return to Camp Nou with a commanding 4-0 win over a 10-man Athletic Bilbao, turning the night into a double celebration.Around 45,000 supporters filled the partially reopened stadium, which is operating at roughly half capacity after more than two years of renovation work. The club, burdened by heavy debt, is banking on the revamped venue to generate much-needed revenue.The evening began perfectly for the hosts as Robert Lewandowski struck just four minutes in. Ferran Torres then netted twice, both goals created by excellent service from young star Lamine Yamal, before Fermín López added another on his Camp Nou debut. Athletic’s hopes faded completely when Oihan Sancet was sent off in the 53rd minute for a reckless challenge on López, with Barcelona already three goals clear.Lewandowski said the night meant more than the scoreline. “We played well from the start and added another three points, but the real joy today is being back at Camp Nou. Playing here is different. We feel stronger.”Fans embraced that feeling too. Despite the cold, there was a festive energy as thousands sang the club anthem before kick-off. Their last visit to Camp Nou had been in May 2023, and for over 900 days they had to travel to the less accessible Olympic Stadium on the city’s hillside for home matches.“It’s like returning home,” said 36-year-old supporter Carlos Narváez. “The atmosphere at the Olympic Stadium wasn’t the same. You can see how excited everyone is.”To mark the occasion, Barcelona released clouds of blue and maroon smoke before the game and staged a fireworks show afterward. Some supporters even chanted Lionel Messi ’s name, remembering the golden era he owned on this very pitch.But the new Camp Nou is still far from its final form. Large cranes tower above the incomplete upper tier, which remains an exposed frame of concrete and steel. Many parts of the ground still resemble an active construction zone. Once finished, the stadium is projected to hold 105,000 spectators.There were also positive notes on the injury front. Joan García returned in goal, while Raphinha made a late appearance, both stepping back onto the pitch after nearly two months out with leg injuries.The victory lifted Barcelona level on points with leaders Real Madrid, who travel to Elche on Sunday. Up next for Xavi’s side is a Champions League visit to Chelsea on Tuesday.Renovation work began in June 2023 with the aim of modernising and expanding the famed arena, previously seating 99,000. The club raised 1.45 billion euros (about $1.6 billion at the time) through several investors to fund the ambitious overhaul.Barcelona had hoped to return by November 2024 to coincide with its 125th anniversary, but the target was pushed back multiple times. The club has yet to announce a new completion date and plans to request permission to open additional sections as progress continues.More than 20,000 fans recently attended Barcelona’s first open training session back at the stadium, and this week UEFA cleared the club to host Eintracht Frankfurt at Camp Nou on 9 December.Villarreal remained just two points behind the leaders after Tani Oluwaseyi struck an 83rd-minute winner in a 2-1 victory against Mallorca. The Canadian forward, formerly of Major League Soccer, secured all three points late on.Real Sociedad produced a dramatic second-half turnaround in their 3-1 win over Osasuna, capped by a spectacular goal from Ander Barrenetxea. Spotting goalkeeper Sergio Herrera off his line, the forward launched a lob from inside the centre circle. Herrera managed to get a hand to it, but not enough to prevent the ball from dropping into the net. It was Sociedad’s first away victory of the campaign.Elsewhere, Iago Aspas converted a second-half penalty to give Celta Vigo a narrow 1-0 win away to Alaves.","Barcelona beat Athletic Bilbao 4-0 at Camp Nou.

It’s about time. It’s been so long!” That was Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta’s response when quizzed about the club’s long-wait for a fourth Premier League title. And this was three years ago! The wait has only grown longer for a club who were last crowned English champions in 2004.Now, after a couple of agonising near misses, and with the Spaniard into his sixth full season since taking charge of the Gunners, the “it’s about time” sentiment has only increased among not just critics, but club icons like Thierry Henry too.Three months into the new season, Arsenal have got off to a start which once again offers their long suffering fans promise.Ahead of Sunday’s eagerly-anticipated North London derby against Tottenham Hotspur, Arteta’s side sit four points clear at the top of the table with 11 games played. It’s the sort of situation that’s bound to generate ‘a lot of noise’, as the club’s star midfielder Declan Rice pointed out.“I think it’s just one of those things that there’s always going to be talk around us because we have such a good manager, we have such good players, and obviously to the start of this season,” Rice told TOI in an interview facilitated by JioHotstar this week. “We’ve been top of the table going into the last two international breaks, so that creates a lot of noise.But it’s important for us that we block that out, which we have been doing.“We take no notice of it and we just keep doing what we’ve been doing, because in the Premier League , anything can happen at any time, and we just need to stay focused.”(Watch Arsenal vs Tottenham in EPL on November 23, LIVE & Exclusive on Star Sports and JioHotstar)",Arsenal sit four points clear at the top of the EPL table with 11 games played.

Chelsea Close In

Other Results

Liverpool’s Premier League campaign continued its downward spiral on Saturday as the defending champions suffered a 3-0 home defeat to Nottingham Forest. Meanwhile, Manchester City’s pursuit of Arsenal was stalled by a 2-1 loss at Newcastle.Liverpool’s sixth defeat of the season leaves them 11th in the table, eight points behind leaders Arsenal, with a game in hand. Coach Arne Slot described the result as “very, very, very bad” and admitted he could offer no excuses for the team’s worrying form.“That is far from good enough, and I’m responsible for that,” Slot said after Murillo, Nicolo Savona, and Morgan Gibbs-White’s goals at Anfield handed Liverpool six losses in their last seven league games. To put it in perspective, last season’s title-winning team lost only four matches all campaign.Arsenal benefited from the slip-ups of its main rivals without taking the field. City suffered their fourth defeat as Harvey Barnes scored twice for Newcastle at St James’ Park. Chelsea moved up to second, closing to within three points of Arsenal with a 2-0 win over Burnley. Arsenal faces Tottenham on Sunday.Elsewhere, Crystal Palace beat Wolves 2-0, Fulham edged Sunderland 1-0, Brighton recovered from a goal down to beat Brentford 2-1, and Bournemouth came back from 2-0 down to draw 2-2 with West Ham.Forest’s victory marked the second consecutive season they’ve beaten Liverpool at Anfield and lifted Sean Dyche’s side out of the relegation zone. It was also Forest’s first back-to-back wins this season under their third coach, following the dismissals of Nuno Espirito Santo and Ange Postecoglou.Liverpool has managed just one league win since September 20. The latest defeat could have been heavier, as Igor Jesus saw a first-half goal disallowed for handball. Murillo opened the scoring in the 33rd minute, with Savona doubling Forest’s advantage immediately after the break. Gibbs-White wrapped up the 3-0 win in the 78th minute.Even the return of Alisson and Alexander Isak, who started his first league match in a month, failed to lift Liverpool’s fortunes. Isak was substituted after 68 minutes, extending his goalless streak to six games this season. Captain Virgil van Dijk said: “Everyone is disappointed, like they should be, because losing at home against Nottingham Forest is very bad.”Manchester City had the chance to draw level with Arsenal but were undone by Newcastle. Harvey Barnes scored in the 63rd minute, Ruben Dias equalised for City shortly after, only for Barnes to flick in the winner seven minutes later. City now sit third, four points behind Arsenal. Pep Guardiola insisted, “There is a long, long, long way to go.”Chelsea moved up to second thanks to goals from Pedro Neto and Enzo Fernandez at Burnley. Neto opened the scoring in the 37th minute, with Fernandez sealing the 2-0 win in the 88th. Burnley slipped into the relegation zone, while West Ham squandered a 2-0 lead at Bournemouth, letting Marcus Tavernier and Enes Unal secure a 2-2 draw.Crystal Palace defeated Wolves 2-0, with goals from Daniel Munoz and Yeremy Pino in quick succession, leaving Wolves still without a win in 12 matches. Brighton maintained their momentum with Danny Welbeck scoring his seventh goal in eight games to help the Seagulls overturn Brentford 2-1. Fulham picked up a rare win, Raul Jimenez scoring the decisive goal in the 84th minute against Sunderland.","Nottingham Forest beat Liverpool 3-0 at Anfield.

From being toothless to making World Cup playoffs: Ireland’s rise under ‘dentist' Heimir Hallgrimsson,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/from-being-toothless-to-making-world-cup-playoffs-irelands-rise-under-dentist-heimir-hallgrimsson/articleshow/125510652.cms,"Heimir Hallgrimsson

CHENNAI: Republic of Ireland’s toothless performances in the first half of their FIFA World Cup qualifying campaign caused ire among the national team’s faithfuls.After Ireland picked up only a solitary point from their first three group F matches, some even went to the extent of mocking head coach Heimir Hallgrimsson, questioning how a ‘tooth fixer’ could solve their aggravating problems. But Hallgrimsson, also a qualified dentist hailing from Iceland, stuck to his methods to eventually make his once doubters grin from ear to ear.Thanks to a tooth-and-nail fight in the all-important 3-2 victory over Hungary, led by hat-trick hero Troy Parrott who successfully completed the operation, the ‘Boys in Green’ are now just two steps away from the global extravaganza.“Of course, I am biased but, in my opinion, we have been steadily improving,” Hallgrimsson told TOI after steering Ireland to the WC playoffs, a run that also included a famous win against Portugal. “We have had performances, but we cannot always turn performances into wins. It takes time for the players to do it, not only to believe in what we are doing but also to believe in each other. I felt that this (three-match winning streak) was coming and I could smell it. ”In a chat arranged by Sports For Life, a platform for grassroots sports development, Hallgrimsson said that he learned from those around him that consistency is the most important part of a national team.“We just have to stick to what we believe will get us the results. There has been consistency in the way we speak to the players and the way they train and play. We never stopped believing. When you never stop believing, you always have a chance to score a lucky goal, if you can term it that,” said the former Iceland coach.While the Irish football community is basking in the moment and buzzing with excitement, Hallgrimsson is focused on accomplishing the mission. In the playoffs in March, Ireland will cross swords with Czech Republic, and if they get past that hurdle, will face either Denmark or North Macedonia in what Hallgrimsson described as a ‘cup final’.“The nation is with us, but I hope that they do not go overboard. We must grow to keep on winning because the task ahead is always bigger. I believe that we have a psychological edge (of having been in the same situation in the past).”Learnings from dentistry: Hallgrimsson’s learnings from dentistry have come in handy during his football managerial career, with the coach saying that it has helped him better understand the psychological characteristics of his players.“When you are a dentist, you always need to approach the person on the dental chair. A lot of people are afraid to sit on it, so I need to adjust to the people who are coming. You need to calm down some of them; you need to cheer up some of them. It is the same with football players. They have different characteristics, so I need to adapt. I need to speak in one way to one player and in a different way to some other player. It is something that has helped me, probably more than education in medicine, sickness etc,” he said.","Heimir Hallgrimsson says consistency is the most important part of a national team.

Pep Guardiola believes Manchester City are entering the phase where the title race truly begins, with the champions looking to close the gap on league leaders Arsenal this weekend. City travel to Newcastle on Saturday knowing a win would take them to within a point of the Gunners, who face Tottenham the following day.Speaking ahead of the trip to St James’ Park, Guardiola said the coming stretch, which is free from international breaks, often decides how the season shapes up. “Now the international break is done so we'll be (together) until March, see each other every three days, four days. Now the real, real season starts,” he said.City cut Arsenal’s advantage to four points before the break after their 3-0 win over Liverpool, a result that followed Arsenal dropping points at Sunderland. Guardiola admitted the momentum shift mattered, especially given how strongly Arsenal have started.He stressed that allowing Mikel Arteta’s side to extend their lead could make the run-in far more difficult. “The feeling that I had in the past when we fought incredibly against Liverpool, I had the feeling that we'll not drop many points and if they can take a lot of distance it will be difficult to catch up,” he said.He referenced how similar the scenario felt to last season’s chase involving Liverpool, adding: “It was similar with Liverpool last season. ”But Guardiola also made it clear that nothing is settled in November. “There's two parts of the season, when the transfer window is over in summer and after, when the international break is over,” he said. The aim, he added, is simply to stay within striking distance. “The important thing is to be there, to be close there and after that arrive at the end of the season with the chance that we can fight for it.”A win at Newcastle, he said, would be another step in that direction. “That is the target and of course winning tomorrow would be an important step for us.”City will be without Mateo Kovacic and Rodri for the match. “Everybody is fit except Kova and Rodri,” Guardiola confirmed, adding that Rodri was “making steps good” in his recovery.Newcastle host Manchester City on Saturday, with Arsenal facing Tottenham a day later in the Premier League.",Manchester City travel to Newcastle on Saturday in the Premier League.

Scotland captain Andy Robertson revealed emotional thoughts about his late Liverpool teammate Diogo Jota after Scotland secured qualification for the 2026 World Cup by defeating Denmark 4-2 on Tuesday, marking their first World Cup appearance since 1998.Scotland's victory came through goals from Scott McTominay, Lawrence Shankland, Kieran Tierney, and Kenny McLean in the match against Denmark at their home ground.Robertson shared his deep emotional connection to the achievement, particularly thinking about his former teammate Jota, who died at 28 in a car accident in July.""I've hidden it well, but today I've been in bits,"" Robertson told the BBC. ""I know the age I'm at, this could be my last chance to go to the World Cup. I couldn't get my mate Diogo Jota out of my head today.""""We talked so much about going to the World Cup because he missed the last one with Portugal and I did with Scotland. I know he'll be smiling down on me today. I'm so glad it's ended up this way.""""This group of boys, this group of staff – it's the best group I've been involved in.

FIFA Shuts Down Trump's 2026 World Cup 'Unsafe Cities' Threat With Bold Remark

Poll Do you think Curacao's qualification for the World Cup will inspire other small nations in football? Yes, definitely! Possibly, but it depends on circumstances. Not really, it's a unique case. No, small nations face too many challenges.

In one of the most extraordinary nights in CONCACAF football history, the tiny Caribbean island of Curacao — home to just 156,000 people — scripted an unprecedented chapter by becoming the smallest country ever to qualify for the FIFA World Cup . Their tense 0-0 draw against Jamaica in Kingston on Tuesday was enough to secure passage to the 2026 finals in the United States, Canada and Mexico.The result capped a dramatic, nerve-wracking finale to the qualifiers, where Curacao survived relentless pressure from Jamaica — who struck the woodwork three times in the second half — and escaped a last-minute penalty scare. Salvadoran referee Ivan Barton initially pointed to the spot after Jeremy Antonisse clipped Dujuan Richards inside the box, but VAR overturned the call in a stunning twist that preserved Curacao’s historic dream.Coached by veteran Dutch tactician Dick Advocaat, who missed the clash due to a family emergency, the ‘Blue Wave’ finished atop Group B with 12 points from six matches, one clear of Jamaica. Curacao now surpass Iceland (population ~350,000 in 2018) as the smallest nation to ever reach a World Cup — a milestone made possible in the first edition featuring 48 teams.Elsewhere, the night produced more fairytale scenes. Haiti, forced to play “home” matches in Curacao due to political unrest, sealed their first World Cup appearance since 1974 after a crucial 2-0 win over Nicaragua.Goals from Louicius Don Deedson and Ruben Providence, combined with Honduras’ goalless draw against Costa Rica, lifted Haiti to the top of Group C with 11 points.Meanwhile, Panama secured the final automatic CONCACAF berth with a dominant 3-0 win over El Salvador, extinguishing Suriname’s hopes despite their qualification for the playoffs.For Curacao, the smallest of football nations, a World Cup dream once thought impossible is now gloriously real — a landmark for the island, the Caribbean, and world football itself.","Smallest nation to qualify for the World Cup, Curacao, beats Costa Rica 1-0. First time in history that two nations have qualified for the same tournament. The first time that two teams from the same country have done so.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125426769,imgsize-106144,width-400,resizemode-4/curacao.jpg"

Pittsburgh Steelers cornerback Jalen Ramsey fine sparks debate



Pittsburgh Steelers cornerback Jalen Ramsey is back in the spotlight after a heated moment in Week 11 turned into one of the most talked–about incidents of the season. The NFL has fined him $14,491 for Unsportsmanlike Conduct after he struck Cincinnati Bengals wide receiver Ja'Marr Chase during a tense exchange. What set everything off was a moment caught on video showing Chase spitting on Ramsey, a move that instantly changed the tone of the game and the public reaction that followed.The league’s response left many fans confused and frustrated. They believed Ramsey’s reaction fit the moment, especially after the video surfaced. Despite Chase denying any wrongdoing, the replay told a different story, and the fallout has now impacted both players in ways neither expected heading into Week 12.The NFL handed Chase a mandatory one–game suspension for violating Rule 12, Section 3, Article 1, which covers behavior that goes against the principles of sportsmanship. The league stated, ""During the fourth quarter, Chase spit on Pittsburgh cornerback Jalen Ramsey, violating Rule 12, Section 3, Article 1, which applies to 'any act which is contrary to the generally understood principles of sportsmanship,' Per NFL Staff."" Chase appealed the decision, but officials upheld the suspension. The missed game against the 9-2 New England Patriots will cost him around $500,000.Ramsey was ejected late in the game, a contest the Steelers won 34-12. Afterward, he made it clear that the situation left him with no choice. ""He spit on me,"" Ramsey said, per ESPN's Brooke Pryor. ""I don't give a f--- about football after that, respectfully. I'm always going to be all for trash talking, s--- talking, things like that. I actually enjoy that part of the game. I think that people know that."" Chase pushed back on the claim and told The Athletic's Paul Dehner Jr. , ""I never opened my mouth to that guy. I didn't spit on nobody.""Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin even stood by Ramsey’s emotional response. ""I have no message if someone spits in your face. Do what comes natural,"" Tomlin said.This is Ramsey’s second major fine of the season, following a Week 9 altercation with Michael Pittman Jr. that cost him $17,389. As the Steelers shift focus to their Week 12 matchup against the Chicago Bears, the conversation around fairness, reactions, and player conduct continues to grow louder.Also Read: Bill Belichick caught in family firestorm after Jen Belichick’s heated rant targeting girlfriend Jordon Hudson post-UNC game","Pittsburgh Steelers cornerback Jalen Ramsey has been fined $14,491 for Unsportsmanlike Conduct.

Bill Belichick’s relationship with Jordon Hudson sparks family tension



North Carolina football has had its share of on-field pressure this season, but what erupted behind closed doors has overshadowed everything else. Tension inside the Belichick family reached a breaking point when Jen Belichick, wife of defensive coordinator Steve Belichick, confronted Jordon Hudson, the 24-year-old girlfriend of head coach Bill Belichick. What began as unease after a brief interaction earlier in the day turned into a long, heated tirade that left everyone stunned.According to reports, the clash unfolded inside Bill’s office at Kenan Memorial Stadium. Witnesses say the confrontation erupted minutes after UNC’s narrow 20-15 win over Stanford and lasted nearly forty minutes. With Bill, Steve and others in the room, Jen let out what one source described as a “profanity-laced tirade,” calling Hudson “bat-(expletive) crazy” and accusing her of trying to “control (expletive). ” At one point, Jen declared that she did not care if her words resulted in Bill disowning her or Steve losing his job. She even shouted, “He wants to fire you, fire you. He wants to (expletive) disown me, disown me. I don’t (expletive) care.”The tension reached its peak when Jen told Bill to choose between his family and Hudson. Witnesses say she believed Hudson was twisting his judgment and pushing her way into private family matters.Her frustration also touched on Hudson’s outfits and public presence, even remarking during the confrontation that she needed to “eat a burger.” The remarks added another layer to a conflict already brewing for months.Fans have reacted strongly, many taking Jen’s side and claiming she voiced what others had long suspected. Hudson’s growing involvement in Bill’s personal and professional life, along with her appearance in a CBS interview earlier this year, has already drawn public attention. The drama now comes at a time when UNC is fighting to stay bowl eligible at 4-6, adding pressure to Bill’s first season as head coach.Hudson, who met Bill on a flight in 2021 before they began dating years later, has been a steady presence at games. But whether she and Jen will appear at the upcoming rivalry matchup against Duke remains uncertain. What is clear is that the fallout from this confrontation has created a rift that the family cannot easily ignore.Also Read: Josh Allen’s cozy moments with Hailee Steinfeld at Wyoming game overshadow Bills drama and create fan frenzy","Jen Belichick, wife of North Carolina head coach Bill Belichick, confronted Jordon Hudson.

An adorable couple shares a genuine moment



Josh Allen and Hailee Steinfeld shared a warm moment that instantly caught attention during the University of Wyoming’s halftime celebration on Saturday. The Buffalo Bills quarterback returned to his alma mater to see his No. 17 jersey retired, a first in Cowboys football history. While the honor alone was monumental, the tenderness between the couple became the highlight as cameras captured them cuddling, smiling and soaking in the afternoon energy in matching brown and gold outfits. Steinfeld completed her look with an “Allen” cap, a quiet but sweet nod to her husband.The appearance was rare. Since marrying this past May, the pair have been selective about stepping into the public eye, yet every moment they share seems to speak volumes. Allen has often described their wedding as the “best night of his life,” while Steinfeld has said the experience brought her “inner peace” and clarity. Their joy stood in sharp contrast to the Bills’ recent frustrations, which included a tough 23-19 loss to the Texans earlier in the week.Their afternoon at Wyoming revealed how grounded they remain amid demanding careers. Steinfeld, coming off the runaway success of her blockbuster “Sinners,” which crossed the 365 million dollar mark globally, continues preparing for her next big role in “Winter Games,” slated for 2027.She recently said, “I’ve gotten a lot better at understanding what it means to slow down and to share that with someone,” a reflection of how much her marriage has shaped her personal balance.Allen is deep into his eighth NFL season, steering the Bills through a challenging but hopeful 7-4 start. Even as pressure mounts around the team’s offensive struggles, his outlook remains anchored by his life off the field. He told ESPN’s Marty Smith, “Getting married, it was the coolest — it was the most important day of my life, and then all that other stuff is just kind of the cherry on top.”Despite the Bills’ rocky moments, Allen’s connection with Steinfeld appears unshakable. He often calls her his “rockstar” and the “most fulfilling” part of his life. And while Buffalo searches for answers, fans find comfort knowing their quarterback still has a steady, joyful place to return to.Also Read: Ciara hilariously exposes how ‘nosy’ Russell Wilson gets whenever her celebrity friends start sharing juicy conversations","Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen and his wife, Hailee Steinfeld, shared a warm moment at Wyoming's halftime celebration.

She aims to share her financial learning journey, empowering others to manage, grow, and protect their money. This move signifies her commitment to independence and long-term stability.

Keeta Vaccaro opens up about financial knowledge, empowerment, and supporting others

Keeta Vaccaro, the estranged wife of Miami Dolphins star Tyreek Hill, is stepping into a new chapter, one that signals independence, self-protection, and long-term planning. In the middle of a highly publicized divorce and a wave of disturbing allegations, Vaccaro revealed she is returning to school to pursue a master’s degree in finance at the University of Miami.Her announcement, shared through a candid Instagram video, quickly gained attention not just because of the timing, but because of the message behind it. At a moment when her personal life has been pushed under intense scrutiny, Vaccaro’s choice to prioritize financial literacy and long-term stability reflects both confidence and resilience. It also gives her followers a window into how she’s rebuilding life on her own terms, with transparency at the center.Vaccaro explained that she enrolled in the finance program to truly understand how to “manage,” “grow,” and “protect” her money, skills she wants to pass along to her followers as she learns them. “I'll be pretty much just kind of going over all the everything that I'm learning,” she said. “That way, girls that are in my position or even men, know about financing, saving money, investing money. I wish I would have a big sister like this so.She reinforced that mission in her caption, writing, “No gatekeeping on this journey 😌💸,” making it clear she intends to turn her personal challenges into a learning experience for others.Vaccaro’s decision comes months after she filed for divorce on April 8, ending their 17-month marriage. Her filing included allegations of multiple incidents of domestic violence spanning January 2024 to April 2025, some of which involved police intervention.Recently unsealed court documents detailed accusations that Hill “violently attacked her, throwing her to the floor, twisting her intimate body parts, ripping her hair out,” and in another instance, attempted to strike her pregnant stomach. Hill has denied all allegations and has not been charged.Despite the turmoil, both continue to share moments with their daughter, Capri, who experienced a health scare in August but recovered after ER care. For Vaccaro, though, her latest move marks a clear step toward rebuilding, publicly, purposefully, and on her own terms.Also Read: Cardi B sparks buzz after Stefon Diggs’ viral sideline moment with Patriots cheerleader takes over the internet","Keeta Vaccaro, the estranged wife of Miami Dolphins star Tyreek Hill, is pursuing a master's in finance at the University of Miami.

Cardi B Debuts Newborn Son in Patriots Gear as She and Stefon Diggs Melt the Internet

How a simple sideline gesture turned into a social media firestorm involving Cardi B

The NFL rarely lacks drama, but this week’s viral moment involving Stefon Diggs and a Patriots cheerleader brought an entirely different level of intrigue and Cardi B ’s name is a big reason why. What started as a routine out-of-bounds play instantly turned into a trending cultural moment once fans connected it to the rapper’s recent life update.Days after announcing the birth of her baby with Diggs, the internet was already hyperfocused on the couple. So when Diggs casually tossed a football toward an unsuspecting cheerleader, social media didn’t just notice it, they dissected it. The clip exploded across platforms, pulling Cardi B straight into the spotlight even without her saying a single word.During the Patriots–Jets matchup, Diggs finished a play by flipping the ball toward a cheerleader engrossed in her routine, an interaction that would’ve been forgotten any other week. But with the couple’s new-parent spotlight burning bright, fans immediately tied the moment to Cardi B and questioned the wide receiver’s intentions.Comments from the “Bardi Gang” flooded timelines, with some insisting, “Stefon knows the cameras are on him every second. Why toss the ball to her like that?” Others chimed in, “Cardi just had his baby. This timing is wild.”While Diggs stayed silent, Cardi B fueled speculation with a perfectly timed retweet about “protecting your peace from public embarrassment.”She didn’t call out Diggs directly, but the internet didn’t need explicit confirmation, the timing was enough to send TikTok and X into a decoding frenzy.Reactions remained sharply split. Some viewers chalked the moment up as harmless football energy, nothing more than a playful interaction captured at an unfortunate angle. Others insisted Diggs should be more self-aware, especially with heightened attention on his personal life.What’s clear is that celebrity-athlete storylines no longer live only on the field, they thrive in the space where sports and pop culture collide. And when Cardi B is part of the equation, even a routine sideline toss becomes headline news. As the couple adjusts to a new chapter, every small gesture, intentional or not, continues to be magnified under the intense, always-watching eye of the internet.Also Read: Kim Kardashian sparks new controversy with All’s Fair’s Taylor Swift–coded episode title as Travis Kelce stays out of the drama","Stefon Diggs tossed a football to a Patriots cheerleader during a game.

“Did me dirty”: Justin Herbert's beau Madison Beer shares how ‘Bittersweet’ became a turning point in her life,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/did-me-dirty-justin-herberts-beau-madison-beer-shares-how-bittersweet-became-a-turning-point-in-her-life/articleshow/125507720.cms,"Madison Beer unveils her upcoming album 'Locket' and its lead single 'Bittersweet,' a deeply personal track born from emotional necessity. She reveals how fan feedback inspired a return to vocal ad-libs and experimental sounds, collaborating with Tim Sommers. The song navigates heartbreak with a choice for growth, a sentiment echoed in its music video.

Madison Beer opens up about creating ‘ bittersweet ’ and how fan feedback shaped her most personal era yet

Madison Beer is stepping into a new chapter, one she admits is equal parts vulnerable, nostalgic, and creatively freeing. As she gears up for the release of her third studio album Locket on January 16, the two-time Grammy nominee is giving fans a deeper look at the emotional world that inspired her latest single, “Bittersweet. ”The track, which follows her comeback single “Yes Baby,” marks a return not just to music, but to a version of herself she’s been slowly rediscovering. Beer says the song emerged during a moment she “felt compelled to document,” and the outpouring of fan support has played a major role in this new creative direction.For Beer, “Bittersweet” wasn’t simply a song idea, it was an emotional necessity. “I was going through something very emotional and real and I was like, ‘I need to write about this. It feels insane not to,’” she said, explaining that the track became a turning point in both her personal life and the larger story she tells on Locket. Though rooted in heartbreak, she frames the song as a choice toward growth rather than resentment. “I can be bitter over things, but I’m choosing to be bittersweet,” she joked.Fans have also shaped the sound more directly than ever before. “I am very close with my fans and their opinions definitely mean a lot to me,” she said.Touring revealed the moments that resonated most, including her early-career ad-libs that fans often begged her to bring back. “My fans are always like, ‘Girl, you do so much fun stuff on stage, do it in your songs,’” she said, crediting their encouragement for sparking her renewed love for vocal ad-libs.Her long-time creative partner Tim Sommers (One Love), someone she says she “has a language” with, helped push those experimental textures even further. Together they leaned into distorted synths and early-2000s tones, elements she affectionately compares to Super Mario Galaxy.The song’s shift toward confrontation in the bridge, “There has to be a moment where you’re like, ‘No, you did me dirty’”, balances the final note of acceptance, “At the end of the day, you’ll know I tried my best with you.”And with the “Bittersweet” music video surpassing millions of views, Beer’s chemistry with co-star Sean Kaufman has only fueled fan excitement. Though she jokingly called herself “a fraud” for not having seen The Summer I Turned Pretty before casting him, their instant friendship made the collaboration seamless and yes, she’s “team Steven, of course.”Also Read: “It was hard”: Josh Allen reflects on the pressure he felt before taking a major next step with Hailee Steinfeld","Madison Beer's third album, Locket, will be released on January 16.

NEW DELHI: Even as Royal Challengers Bengaluru finally lifted their maiden Indian Premier League title in 2025, ending a nearly two-decade-long wait, it was Virat Kohli 's post-match words that sparked conversations far beyond the boundary ropes.Following RCB's six-run win over Punjab Kings in a gripping final at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad, an emotional Kohli stole the spotlight — not just for the tears, the turf kiss, or his long-awaited hands on the trophy — but for a quote that now has fans wondering: Was Virat Kohli targeting someone?While speaking with former Australia opener Matthew Hayden on the field, Kohli was asked about the relentless passion and drive that continues to define his game. His reply, now going viral, was both heartfelt and pointed:“Well, I have an opportunity to play this game for not many years, so there is an end date to our career as you know. And by the time that I hang up my boots I want to sit at home and say I gave it everything I had. So I look for ways to improve. I can't play as an impact player. I want to field, I want to field 20 overs and make an impact in the field. That's the kind of player I am, I have been.”The comment struck a chord, not just with fans but also within cricketing circles, as Kohli made it clear: playing only as a batter doesn't align with his ethos.In the era of the 'Impact Player' rule — where several veteran stars and young talents are fielded purely for their batting or bowling — Kohli's declaration felt both personal and philosophical.Was it a veiled message to those choosing to limit their roles? Or simply a reflection of his enduring intensity and commitment?“I'm so very grateful for this victory. So thankful to God for giving it in my lap finally tonight,” Kohli concluded, adding another emotional layer to a night that saw RCB, and their captain-in-spirit, finally crowned champions.Either way, Virat Kohli has once again reminded everyone why he remains more than just a name on the team sheet.","Royal Challengers Bengaluru won their maiden Indian Premier League title in 2025.

Royal Challengers Bengaluru secured their first Indian Premier League title defeating Punjab Kings by six runs at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad on June 3. The high-octane clash saw RCB clinch the win in emphatic fashion after successfully defending 190 against Shreyas Iyer and Co.Following the win, a viral, a viral moment captured attention during the trophy celebrations as captain Rajat Patidar broke tradition. The RCB skipper had earlier dedicated the iconic win to their loyal talisman Virat Kohli , who led the charge for his side with 43 runs off 34 balls.A newly surfaced video shows Patidar encouraging a hesitant Kohli to sign the camera after the victory, breaking the customary tradition of IPL-winning captains signing the camera post-final. Patidar joins an elite group of captains, becoming only the fourth after Shane Warne, Rohit Sharma, and Hardik Pandya to win the IPL trophy in their debut season as skipper.Kohli emerged as RCB's standout performer in IPL 2025, accumulating 657 runs across 15 innings with an average of 54.75 and a strike rate of 144.71, including eight half-centuries in winning causes.The victory was particularly emotional for Kohli, who fell to his knees and covered his face as he let the tears flow after the final match, with teammates rushing to celebrate with him following Josh Hazlewood's final delivery.""This win is as much for the fans as it is for the team. It has been 18 long years. I have given this team my youth, my prime and my experience, and I have tried to win this every season that I have come. I have given everything I have and to finally have this moment come, it is an unbelievable feeling,"" Kohli expressed during the post-match presentation.The celebration's aftermath took a tragic turn when a stampede occurred outside the M Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bengaluru during the team's victory parade, where 11 people lost their lives and several more were injured. Following the tragic incident, RCB's marketing and revenue head Nikhil Sosale was arrested along with three members of the event management company, DNA.The incident also led to the resignation of the Karnataka State Cricket Association's secretary and treasurer.","Royal Challengers Bengaluru secured their first Indian Premier League title defeating Punjab Kings by six runs at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad on June 3.

NEW DELHI: Jannik Sinner versus Carlos Alcaraz has been hailed as the next big rivalry in men's tennis, with Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal , and Andy Murray all retired and 38-year-old Novak Djokovic losing his powers.They've brought this sensational contest to the grandest scales as well, including last year's French Open , Wimbledon in 2022, and sandwiched in between was a shot-making bonanza at the 2022 US Open.All of these have come on the path to glory. Round of 16 at 2022 Wimbledon, quarter-final at 2022 US Open and semi-final at Roland Garros last year. On Sunday, when they step up for their 12th match-up overall, it will be with a trophy on the line.The matchup has already created a couple of milestones. Sinner became only the second Italian to reach the Roland Garros final since 1976. He is now into his third straight major final, winning the previous two.Defending champion Alcaraz is the fifth-youngest player to reach five Men's Singles Grand Slam finals and has been to the title matches of a major for four straight years now.Maybe, most important of all, it will be the first major final between two men born in the 2000s, just in case anyone needed further affirmation that the new era has begun.If that's not enough, here's more: 22-year-old Alcaraz and 23-year-old Sinner have won the last five majors.The path to the title clash has been contrasting, though. As Alcaraz hopes to retain the Coupe des Mousquetaires for only the third time since Gustavo Kuerten and Nadal, it comes with the knowledge that Sinner has yet to drop a set this fortnight.The World No. 1 has lost just seven matches since the start of 2024, including one this year, but four of them have come against the Spaniard, the most recent one coming in Rome three weeks back.""He's the best tennis player right now,"" said Alcaraz. ""I mean, he's destroying every opponent.""Such is the brutality and consistency of Sinner's shot-making that there is a running joke among his peers where they celebrate getting a game off the Italian. Jiri Lehecka, Andrey Rublev, Alexander Bublik and Casper Ruud have been at the receiving end in the last month.Bublik and Rublev needed 27 minutes to win one game against Sinner, Ruud took 47 minutes and Lehecka raised his arms in celebration after 55 minutes.The latest opponent, Djokovic, pushed him the longest: three hours and 16 minutes. Yet, all he could squeeze out of the lanky Italian were 15 games.Alcaraz, meanwhile, has won just two of his six matches in straight sets but had a shorter time on court on Friday after Lorenzo Musetti was forced to retire.There are plenty of things going in the Spaniard's favour, too. He is 21-1 on clay; won titles in Rome and Monte Carlo in the tune-up; has won the past four matches against Sinner to lead the head-to-head 7-4.Contrary to Sinner, Alcaraz is jovial on the court, likes to entertain and didn't hesitate in acknowledging that he's unlikely to make things easy for himself and his fans. His belief is backed by the confidence of not giving up. “Because I know that I have time and I’m strong mentally enough to come back,” Alcaraz said.He proved just that in last year's French Open final, when he came back from two-sets-to-one-down to beat Alexander Zverev.Sinner and Alcaraz come into the French Open final with a flawless record in major title clashes. That, however, will change on Sunday.""The stage, it doesn't get any bigger now. Grand Slam finals against Carlos, it's a special moment for me and for him, too,"" said Sinner.""The tension you feel before the match and during the match is a little bit different in a way, because we are both very young, we are both different, but talented.""Alcaraz acknowledged he'll have to play out of his skin to deny Sinner a maiden French Open title.""I love that battle. But most of the time is just about suffering, because (he pushes) you to the limit,"" said Carlos.Rivalry comparisons with Nadal-Djokovic-Federer get repeated and rightly so. But the 38-year-old Serb, who has been embroiled in 60 clashes with Nadal and 50 with Federer, thinks it's too early to draw fair comparisons.“At the moment, that's kind of hard, because they need to play against each for at least 10-plus years nonstop in order to be part of the same discussion,” the 38-year-old Djokovic said Friday, laughing. “But they're definitely great for tennis, both of them. I think their rivalry is something that our sport needs, no doubt. I’m sure that we're going to see them lifting the big trophies quite often.”","Carlos Alcaraz faces Jannik Sinner in the French Open final on Sunday. It will be the first major final between two men born in the 2000s. Sinner became only the second Italian to reach the Roland Garros final since 1976. He is now into his third straight major final, winning the previous two.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121697812,imgsize-45582,width-400,resizemode-4/121697812.jpg"

NEW DELHI: ""In sports, you never know what will happen,"" GM Anna Muzychuk had said during a chat with TimesofIndia.com last February. Back then, Ukraine's No. 1 was looking ahead to 2025 with cautious optimism.Five months on, Muzychuk has three back-to-back classical chess titles under her belt: the Nicosia Grand Prix in March, Grosslobming Grand Prix in May, and now the prestigious Norway Chess.Despite her consistent form, the current World No. 6 (based on live ratings) entered the Stavanger event without much fanfare.The spotlight was instead on reigning world champion Ju Wenjun, former champion Lei Tingjie, India’s Koneru Humpy, and rising stars like Vaishali Rameshbabu and Sara Khadem.On social media and in chess circles, most conversations overlooked Muzychuk’s quiet momentum, while global attention was heavily skewed towards big names in the Open section: Magnus Carlsen ’s return to classical chess, his on-board rivalry against World Champion D Gukesh, and elite players like Hikaru Nakamura, Arjun Erigaisi, and Fabiano Caruana.Amid this high-profile cast, Muzychuk stayed away from public scrutiny -- until her results did the talking.""Yes, last year, I finished second behind the Women's World Champion… It would be wonderful if I could win it,"" Ukraine's top-rated Grandmaster had said before the tournament.She did, and she did it effortlessly. The 35-year-old was the only player in the women's field to remain unbeaten in classical games this year.With four classical wins and steady results in the Armageddon rounds, she amassed 16.5 points, enough to edge the rest and secure the title.Along with the trophy, Muzychuk also received NOK 700,000 (approximately Rs 59 lakh), the same amount awarded to Carlsen for winning the Open section.This edition marked the first time Norway Chess offered equal prize money across both sections, a move hailed as a significant step for women’s chess.""For us, as women, we are very excited about it. It’s very important and a big step forward,"" Muzychuk had stated earlier. ""As you know, in general, there are more open tournaments, which are mainly for men, and the prize funds in those tournaments are usually higher. So we would love to see more women’s events with higher prizes. That would be a great motivation for us and for the next generation, showing them that such tournaments exist and what they can aspire to achieve. ""The Norway Chess format itself is unique.A win in the classical round earns 3 points. A draw leads to an Armageddon tiebreak, where a win grants 1.5 points and a loss, 1 point.ALSO READ: Rs 50,000 a month and countless sacrifices: How India's chess future shapes up in Chennai hut In Armageddon, White gets 10 minutes and must win; Black gets 7 minutes (with a 1-second increment after move 41) and wins the game if it ends in a draw.""Usually, in my case in Armageddon, I just play the game, but I always keep in mind that a draw favours Black. So if I have a choice between simplifying or going for something more complex, I might prefer the simpler option,"" Muzychuk explained. ""If I’m White, I might go for complexity. But if I get a chance to force a draw with a perpetual check, I might take it instead of risking everything.""With this title, Muzychuk has reinforced her status as one of the most consistent performers in women’s chess today, even if the spotlight hasn't always followed.","Anna Muzychuk won Norway Chess for the third time.

NEW DELHI: Chloe Tryon has been named the ICC Women’s Player of the Month for May 2025, following a series of stellar all-round performances during South Africa’s ODI tri-series against Sri Lanka and India. The dynamic all-rounder edged out fellow nominees Hayley Matthews of the West Indies and India’s Jemimah Rodrigues to claim the prestigious monthly honor.Tryon led from the front in Sri Lanka, playing a key role with both bat and ball across the series. She was particularly impressive in South Africa’s penultimate fixture, a narrow 23-run loss to India, where she struck a blazing 67 off just 43 balls. Her innings featured four boundaries and five sixes as she powered her team’s chase of 337. Earlier in the match, she claimed the crucial wicket of Indian opener Smriti Mandhana, finishing with figures of 1/46.However, it was in the final match of the tri-series that Tryon truly stamped her authority. Batting first, she hammered 74 runs from 51 deliveries, smashing four fours and five sixes to help South Africa post a commanding 315. With the ball, she delivered a career-best performance, picking up her maiden five-wicket haul, finishing with 5/34 in eight overs—including a memorable hat-trick—as the Proteas sealed a 76-run victory.Tryon ended the month with 176 runs at an average of 58.66 and a strike rate of 131.34 in three ODIs, along with six wickets at an economy rate of 5.00.Reacting to the recognition, Tryon said, “I probably didn’t expect this award, but I see it as a great achievement. I’ve been trying to find consistency for a while, so I’m happy that it finally came together in Sri Lanka... Everything came together, and I’m just really happy that I could perform and help the team win.”With a World Cup on the horizon, the 31-year-old will be aiming to build on her form and continue delivering match-winning performances.","Chloe Tryon has been named the ICC Women's Player of the Month for May 2025.

I will probably nail down a few more overs tomorrow and then over the next few days, tick a lot of boxes,"" Hazlewood told ICC on Saturday.Hazlewood's recent participation in IPL 2025, where he won the title with Royal Challengers Bengaluru, has helped him maintain his bowling rhythm despite a minor shoulder niggle.""I ticked over some good overs just before the (IPL) Final in Ahmedabad in different weather than this, and it was quite a tough session.And then obviously, every time you play a game in the IPL, you're probably going to get almost seven or eight overs in, if you really want to.""Quiz: Who's that IPL player?""So in and around with warm-ups, and obviously the four overs in the game.

The venue also has stands named after cricket legends Sunil Gavaskar (there's also a special box for him), Sachin Tendulkar and former India captain Dilip Vengsarkar In his letter (TOI has a copy), Hattangadi has written, ""Dear president, I write to you not only as a former player but as someone who has proudly served Mumbai cricket for over a decade.Those of us who have emerged from this great city—be it from school, club, junior levels, Ranji Trophy, or eventually representing India—deeply cherish the legacy, tradition, and culture that Mumbai cricket has built over generations.

Every name etched on the stadium walls—be it senior or junior—stands as a testament to the rich history we are privileged to be part of.

It means every Test you play has something on it, it brings all the countries into play, and anyone can make the final. You're playing for a trophy at the end of a two-year cycle. I think it has worked great. Two years ago, when we beat India, it was awesome. I'm looking at it from a player's perspective, and it looks like the game is in a great place,"" he said.The Australian batter highlighted the role of major cricket nations in sustaining Test cricket's popularity.""Every time Test cricket is on, people want to watch it. India, Australia and England are probably carrying a bit of the load of Test cricket, but we really want to see all the countries keep producing great players and being part of upholding such an amazing tradition of Test cricket,"" he added.Quiz: Who's that IPL player? Labuschagne's Test career began notably at Lord's in 2019, where he became cricket's first concussion substitute.His career flourished afterward, achieving an impressive average of 63.43 after 14 Tests and reaching the top spot in ICC Test rankings for six months starting December 2021.The South African-born cricketer also discussed his long-standing relationship with his club.""I love playing with the guys here; they are close friends, and I love the environment at the club. The benefit of having a relationship with the club for six years is that you have the perks of being able to call the director of cricket and say: This is what it looks like, is there a chance we can line this up?"" he said.He further emphasized the advantages of his commitment to the club.""Without that relationship, there might be some hesitancy, or you might not get someone in for two games. But that's the benefit of the long-term commitment I have shown over the last six years,"" he added.",Australian cricketer Marnus Labuschagne expressed his optimism about Test cricket's future.

Gautam Gambhir sends stern message after Bengaluru tragedy





Former South Africa cricket head coach Mark Boucher believes a victory for the Temba Bavuma-led South African team in the upcoming World Test Championship final against Australia at Lord's on June 11 could revitalize Test cricket in South Africa. The team secured their first-ever WTC final appearance after winning seven consecutive Tests and topping the 2023-25 cycle points table with a 69.44 percentage.South Africa is currently preparing for the crucial one-off Test with a warm-up match against Zimbabwe at Arundel.""A lot of people have criticised South Africa, which is not really fair. You play what's in front of you, and with all due respect, the sides that we've played against, we probably should have beaten, and we've done that. So we find ourselves in a final,"" Boucher said.""But I wouldn't say that it has got the crowds going in our country. Everyone's very excited about it now, as the opportunity arises, a lot of people are going to travel over to London, spend all their Rands, and go watch what should be a good match. If we win it, I think that could be the turnaround for Test cricket in our country,"" he added.The Lord's clash marks the second ICC title match appearance for the men's team following their runner-up finish in the 2024 Men's T20 World Cup.The women's team has also finished as runners-up in consecutive T20 World Cups.""We're playing for a trophy, so I guess a lot of people are saying no [we can't win], but I think it's a different feel in Test match cricket. It's played over a longer period of time, and you've just got to win big moments in the game as well. Yes, there will be that tag [chokers] that gets thrown our way until we win a trophy,"" Boucher stated.""You're not going to get rid of the tag. Is it deserving of these youngsters coming through? No, it's almost like they're carrying the burden of what happened in previous years, which is always going to be tough on them, but they're the ones in control of their futures at the moment,"" he continued.Quiz: Who's that IPL player? Boucher expressed confidence in opener Ryan Rickelton and batsman Tristan Stubbs for the upcoming final.""Ryan Rickelton has been playing nicely for Mumbai Indians (MI), and he was actually on the tour that we went to England (in 2022) as well. He's actually played quite a few games in England as well, so he'll know the conditions,"" he remarked.""And Tristan Stubbs has come back and played a lot of domestic cricket and basically forced his way into the Test side because of the runs that he's got. On paper, Australia will probably feel that they've got a better batting line-up than what we have, but have we got the attitude to go out there and, in a one-off game, just leave it all out there? Absolutely,"" Boucher concluded.",South Africa will play Australia in the World Test Championship final at Lord's on June 11.

South Africa Test captain Temba Bavuma , the first Black cricketer to lead his country in Test cricket, shared his journey from playing cricket in the streets of Langa to leading his team at Lord's in the upcoming ICC World Test Championship final against Australia on June 11. South Africa last faced Australia in a Test series in 2022-23, where Australia won 2-0.Bavuma, now 35, recalled his childhood connection to Lord's cricket ground, drawing parallels between the streets of his hometown and famous cricket venues.""There was always some sort of allegiance with Lord's when we were growing up in Langa. On the right-hand side of the street the tar wasn't done so nicely and we used to call it Karachi. The other side was the MCG . But my favourite section was clean and done up nicely, and we called it Lord's because it just looked better. As a kid of 10, I already had that dream of playing at Lord's,"" Bavuma told The Guardian.His journey included earning a scholarship to SACS, where he faced challenges adapting to a predominantly white institution.""It was tough integrating within the system, learning and understanding the (white) culture,"" he said of his time at SACS. ""But I had to learn about discipline and etiquette. I also had to learn confidence. Can you imagine taking a child from the township into a system where, basically, everything is there? There were always doubts. Am I good enough to be here?""Bavuma remembered the stark differences when SACS played against Langa. ""My friends from Langa would have huge plates at lunch. We'd laugh about it but… the Langa boy would be wondering when is he going to get another opportunity to eat food like that?""His cricket career progressed after moving to Johannesburg and attending St David's, which has since named its cricket ground after him.Bavuma achieved a significant milestone in 2016 by becoming the first Black South African to score a Test century. His second century came in 2023 after becoming Test captain.Quiz: Who's that IPL player? ""The added responsibility, getting pushed up the order, is something I thrived on,"" Bavuma said.

Carlo Ancelotti's debut as coach of Brazil ended in a goalless draw in Ecuador in South American World Cup qualifying on Thursday.Argentina, already assured of a place in next year's tournament, beat Chile 1-0 in Santiago with a goal from Julian Alvarez, a result which guarantees Lionel Scaloni's team top spot and leaves bottom placed 'La Roja' with virtually no hope of qualifying.Ancelotti, the 65-year-old Italian, who left Real Madrid at the end of the European season, has been charged with taking Brazil through the latter stages of qualifying for the 2026 World Cup.The former AC Milan and Chelsea manager replaced Dorival Junior, who was sacked at the end of March after the 4-1 thrashing at the hands of reigning champions and bitter rivals Argentina.Thursday's result leaves the Selecao in fourth place in the qualifying table on 22 points while Ecuador, the surprise package in the campaign, remain in second on 24 points.Argentina lead the standings on 34 points and are the only team to have officially secured their place in the tournament which will be held in the USA, Canada and Mexico.Paraguay, who enjoyed a 2-0 win over Marcelo Bielsa's Uruguay, sit in third place, level on points with Ecuador.Ecuador knew a win would put them on the brink of qualification and there was a packed crowd at the Estadio Monumental in Guayaquil.But the home side were dealt a blow just before kick-off when goalkeeper Hernan Galindez suffered a muscle strain in the warm-up and replacement Gonzalo Valle was hurriedly sent out to make his debut.If Valle had any nerves they eased when he did well to parry a shot from inside the box from Vinicius Jr. who had been set up by Gerson following a turnover.Chances were limited in a contest where neither side was able to get control of midfield.The pattern continued after the break with Ecuador, missing their injured striker and talisman Enner Valencia, struggling to pose a threat.Real Madrid star Vinicius was quiet for much of the game and with Rodrygo absent, Brazil also lacked potency in attack.The best opening came in the 75th minute when Vinicius broke down the left and cut back to Casemiro, but the Manchester United midfielder, recalled to the national side by Ancelotti, saw a tame side-footed effort easily dealt with by Valle.While there was no instant impact from Ancelotti, Vinicius, who played under the coach in Madrid, said he needed time to make his impact felt.""I'm very happy to have Ancelotti here with us, because I've always said he's the best coach I've ever worked with. Having the opportunity to work with him in the Brazilian national team is the best,"" the winger told SporTV.""He hasn't had time to show his work, his game plan, because he's only had two or three days of training,"" he added.Atletico Madrid striker Alvarez put Argentina ahead at the Estadio Nacional in the 16th minute with a deft finish after he had been put through by a perfectly weighted pass from Thiago Almada. Lionel Messi came off the bench in the 57th minute but Chile sensed a chance to get something from the game and created more as the game progressed.Argentina keeper Emiliano Martinez made a series of crucial saves and Lucas Cepeda went closest with a fierce shot which struck the bar.Cepeda then had the best chance of the game when he was found at the back post but he blasted his volley wide.Messi set up Giuliano Simeone with a chance to make it 2-0 but the son of former Argentina captain and Atletico Madrid coach Diego, fired his shot into the side netting.A header from midfielder Matias Galarza just 13 minutes into the game and a late penalty from Julio Enciso earned Paraguay a crucial victory over a depleted Uruguay.The victory left Paraguay on the verge of securing their return to the World Cup for the first time since qualifying for the 2010 finals in South Africa.Victory in Sao Paulo on Tuesday against Brazil would secure their place in the tournament.The top six teams in the 10-team qualifying group head directly into the World Cup draw while the seventh placed team must enter the inter-confederation playoffs.",Carlo Ancelotti's debut as coach of Brazil ends in a goalless draw in Ecuador in South American World Cup qualifying.

Uzbekistan and Jordan made history on Thursday by qualifying for their first World Cup, while the pair will be joined in next year's tournament by perennial participants South Korea.Uzbekistan, one of the fastest-rising national teams in Asia, drew 0-0 with the UAE in Abu Dhabi to take the second automatic spot in Group A, although top place is still in play after already qualified Iran lost 1-0 to Qatar in Doha.Heading into the third round's final set of fixtures on Tuesday, Iran sit at the summit, two points ahead of Uzbekistan.The top two teams in each of the three Asian groups go straight to the World Cup, while those finishing third and fourth -- the UAE and Qatar hold those slots in Group A -- enter a fourth round of qualifiers.In Group B, South Korea confirmed their place in an 11th straight World Cup by defeating Iraq 2-0 in Basra.The victory, sealed by second-half goals from Kim Jin-gyu and Oh Hyeon-gyu, means South Korea reclaim top spot from Jordan, whose 3-0 victory against Oman earlier on Thursday ultimately proved enough to secure their participation at the expanded 48-team showpiece in the United States, Canada and Mexico.Jordan's King Abdullah II congratulated the team on social media.""This historic qualification is well-deserved by our team, which includes stars and cadres of whom we are proud,"" he wrote on X.""Special thanks go to our loyal fans who have been our support and encouragement.""Ali Olwin netted a hat-trick as the 2023 Asian Cup runners-up etched their name in the record books.Iraq were reduced to 10 men midway through the first half when Ali Al Hamadi's foul on Cho Yu-min was upgraded to a red card following a VAR review.Iraq sit third in Group B, with Oman and Palestine still able to progress to the fourth round of qualifying. Palestine, who defeated Kuwait 2-0 in Ardhiya, host Oman on Tuesday, while Iraq face Jordan in Amman.Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia and Australia will go head-to-head on Tuesday for the second automatic spot in Group C.Australia remain in pole position following their last-gasp win against group leaders Japan in Perth.Defender Aziz Behich was the home hero in front of more than 57,000 fans, rifling into the corner in the 90th minute to give Tony Popovic's side a crucial 1-0 victory.""We know there's room to grow and room to improve, but we've done something special tonight,"" said Popovic, who saw his team outplayed for long periods by an experimental Japan side.Saudi Arabia ensured the race for second place will go down to the wire courtesy of a 2-0 win against Bahrain in Riffa. Goals in either half from Musab Al Juwayr and Abdulrahman Al Obud saw Herve Renard's men stay three points behind second-placed Australia.However, the Saudis will have to win in Jeddah by five goals to leapfrog the Socceroos.Popovic, who replaced Graham Arnold in the dugout in September, added: ""We've all played a part in getting us to this point. We want to go to Saudi Arabia and really finish the job off.""Also in Group C, Patrick Kluivert's Indonesia kept alive their hopes of reaching a first World Cup since the country's independence in 1945 with a 1-0 win over China.That leaves Indonesia fourth in the group, one point behind Saudi. Ole Romeny scored the only goal, his controversial penalty just before half time following a VAR check leaving China rooted to the bottom of the group and thus ending their hopes of making a second World Cup.",Uzbekistan and Jordan qualify for their first-ever FIFA World Cup tournament.

Despite a thunderous campaign with Inter this season, Inter boss Simone Inzaghi has parted ways with the club.

Portugal secured a 2-1 comeback victory against Germany in their Nations League semifinal in Munich on Wednesday. While the side by Cristiano Ronaldo made it to their second final in the history of the competition, it was their 40-year-old skipper scoring his 137th international goal to become the oldest player to score against Germany that grabbed all the headlines.Ronaldo's goal came five minutes after substitute Francisco Conceicao equalized with a powerful shot in the 63rd minute, helping Portugal overcome their initial deficit and ending Ronaldo's personal losing streak against Germany.Florian Wirtz had given Germany the lead in the 48th minute with a precise header inside the right post, but Portugal coach Roberto Martinez's strategic substitutions proved decisive.Champions League winner Vitinha, who helped Paris Saint-Germain triumph against Inter Milan at the same stadium just four days earlier, made a significant impact after coming on as a substitute. German goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen stood his ground to prevent Portugal from extending their lead further.PSG wing backs Joao Neves and Nuno Mendes were in the starting line-up for Portugal, while Nick Woltemade made his debut start for Germany.Conceicao made an immediate impact after coming on, scoring with an impressive long-range strike past Robin Gosens. Mendes then provided the assist for Ronaldo's comfortable finish five minutes later. The Al-Nassr man was in the right place to guide the pass from his teammate into an empty net.While Portugal have already booked their spot in the final, they will have to wait to know who they are to face in the title decider.

PATHUM THANI (THAILAND): A lacklustre India lost 0-2 against Thailand in an international football friendly in a reality check ahead of their crucial Asian Cup qualifying round match on Wednesday.Benjamin Davis and Poramet Arjvilai scored for Thailand in the 8th and 59th minute respectively as the home side dominated the match at the Thammasat Stadium.India had won the last two matches between the two sides before Wednesday's defeat but Thailand, ranked 99th in the world, were clearly the better side on the day.India are currently ranked a lowly 127th.The talismanic Sunil Chhetri , who had scored twice in India's 4-1 win against Thailand in the 2019 AFC Asian Cup, nearly scored in the 24th minute but his glancing header was saved by a diving Thailand goalkeeper Saranon Anui.India had also beaten Thailand 1-0 in the Kings Cup in 2019.Thailand were technically bettered equipped and more clinical while India were left ruing missed opportunities and costly defensive lapses. The Indian midfield also lacked creativity.This was the Indian team's second defeat in seven matches under head coach Manolo Marquez, the last one being 0-3 loss to Syria in the Intercontinental Cup last year in Hyderabad.Out of the five remaining matches under his charge, four were drawn games while the lone win came against Maldives (3-0) in March in an international friendly.Thailand made their early dominance count. Phitiwat Sookjitthammakul found Korawich Tasa near the edge of the Indian box in the eighth minute. Tasa smartly laid it off for Ben Davis, who took a deft first touch to steady himself before unleashing a thunderous right-footed shot past Indian goalkeeper Vishal Kaith.It was Davis’ fourth goal in seven appearances for Thailand, and the Indian backline was left exposed, reacting too late to close him down.India gradually grew into the game, using the width of the pitch to stretch the Thailand defence. Liston Colaco, operating fluently between midfield and the left flank, was a standout performer, linking up well with Sunil Chhetri and forward Ashique Kuruniyan.India's first opportunity to level the score in the first half came in the 24th minute. Colaco delivered a teasing free-kick from the left which Chhetri met with a clever header, timing his run perfectly to get ahead of his marker. However, Thailand goalkeeper Saranon Anuin dived to his left to pull off a sharp save.Thailand continued to pose threat on the Indian citadel, with long-range efforts from Korawich Tasa and Arjvilai narrowly missing the target.The momentum began to shift slightly in India’s favour as the half wore on. Abhishek came close with a driven shot from distance that missed the horizontal by inches in the 40th minute.But the golden opportunity arrived in first-half stoppage time. Chhetri played a sublime through ball from midfield to find Colaco’s run, splitting the Thai defence. Colaco brought the ball under control but couldn’t finish the one-on-one chance as Anuin narrowed the angle to eventually thwart the danger with a timely save.In the 59th minute, a miss pass in the midfield gifted Thailand ball possession. The ball was quickly fed to Arjvilai on the left flank. Spotting Vishal Kaith slightly off his line after sidestepping Ashish Rai, Arjvilai curled a magnificent effort into the top-right corner to double Thailand’s lead and deflate Indian hopes.Substitute Lallianzuala Chhangte got a fine chance in the 80th minute but his left footer went just wide of the upright.The Changsuek, meanwhile, looked to exploit the spaces India left behind and could have added a third if not for a crucial intervention by Anwar Ali, who threw himself in front of a goal-bound shot in the dying moments.The match was part of preparation for India's crucial AFC Asian Cup qualifying round match against Hong Kong on June 10 in Kowloon.The same was also the case for Thailand as they face Turkmenistan in their AFC Asian Cup final round qualifier.",Benjamin Davis and Poramet Arjvilai scored for Thailand in the 8th and 59th minute respectively.

'A particularly special feeling': Andy Flower hails Virat Kohli, RCB after historic title win





PANAJI: Naushad Moosa has returned as head coach of the India under-23 squad. This time, he has been handed a longer rope, stretching a year, and tasked with preparing the team for next year’s Asian Games and the AFC U-23 Asian Cup, qualifiers for which will be held in September.Last year, Moosa, assistant to Juan Pedro at NorthEast United, was in charge of the under-23 team for two friendlies against Malaysia in Kuala Lumpur.“The longer contract helps me understand the players better,” Moosa told TOI in a recent interview. “I spoke with the AIFF and told them it’s important to have longer camps as well, so that we can properly assess the players and opponents. I want to bring the best out of these players. Getting them to gel together, though, will be a challenge.”Moosa, a former international who played for India between 1994 and 1998 and won the SAFF Championship in 1997, has named a 29-member probable squad for the two friendlies in Dushanbe against Tajikistan and Kyrgyz Republic, later this month. A concern for Moosa is that a majority of players are with ISL clubs. Many of them are without enough playing time in the top tier of Indian football.“The younger under-19 players, all of them want to play for ISL clubs. My advice is don’t jump (straightway) into the ISL. Of course, you should try, but only a few make it to the top. The youngsters can sign for clubs where they get to play. At this age, it’s important for them to be playing competitive matches. Sitting on the bench for financially-rich clubs doesn't really help in their growth as players,” said Moosa.“The younger players in the ISL are not getting enough opportunities. There are a lot of promising players in the I-League who we will track,” added Moosa.From amongst the 29 probables, only a handful have featured regularly for their teams in the ISL. Just one among them, Vibin Mohanan, has a senior team appearance, though Ayush Chhetri, Abhishek Singh and Suhail Bhat, all aged below 23, are currently under Manolo Marquez with the national team.Mohammed Sanan, Nikhil Barla (both Jamshedpur), Korou Singh, Bikash Yumnam (both Kerala Blasters), Macarton Louis Nickson, Parthib Gogoi (both NorthEast United) and Dipendu Biswas (Mohun Bagan) are the more recognisable names among the under-23 probables.Only two players -- Rahul Raju (Gokulam Kerala) and Mohammad Arbaz (Real Kashmir) – are doing duty in the I-League, the second tier tournament.“We need to have more camps, more exposure matches. If we cannot travel abroad, we can play here, but with stronger opponents. Losing is not a problem. It’s important we play stronger opponents to prepare for the challenges. Our aim should not be to win SAFF. We must look at the bigger stage where we will be properly judged,” said Moosa.India U-23 will face Tajikistan and Kyrgyz Republic in two friendlies on June 18 and June 21 as part of the AIFF’s long-term plans to smoothen a pathway to the senior national team.The team is in Kolkata where they will train before setting off for Dushanbe on June 16.",India U-23 coach Naushad Moosa has been handed a long-term contract by the AIFF.

Jadon Sancho will leave Chelsea when his loan spell ends on June 30 after failing to agree on personal terms for a permanent transfer, despite having helped the club secure Champions League qualification with a fourth-place Premier League finish. The Englishman scoring in the UEFA Conference League final against Real Betis was not enough to hand him a permanent deal at Stamford Bridge.The 25-year-old winger joined Chelsea last summer from Manchester United on a temporary deal that included a £25million obligation to buy clause, subject to personal terms being agreed upon with the player.However, the club have opted against it and will now have to pay a fine of £5million to get out of the obligation. The Manchester United player, who still has a year left on his deal at Old Trafford is now exploring options both in England and across Europe for his next move.During his time at Chelsea, Sancho's numbers did not amount to anything significant, although he bagged five goals and ten assists in 42 appearances across all competitions.Speaking after the Conference League final, Maresca addressed Sancho's future, stating: ""From now on is when we sit down with the club and decide about next year.""The manager further praised Sancho's contribution, saying: ""Jadon Sancho, if we finished fourth, it's because of Jadon, if we won tonight it's because of Jadon. It's also because of Robert Sanchez — during the season, everyone is up and down a little bit, that's part of the game. ""While unable to strike a deal with the Blues, the 25-year-old is on the lookout for a new club, be it in the Premier League or elsewhere. While United prepares to negotiate with other clubs to offload the high-wage winger, who reportedly makes close to£300,000 a week, his current wage may prevent a permanent deal from materialising. Sancho has been linked with the likes of West Ham United and the Saudi Pro League.","Jadon Sancho will leave Chelsea when his loan spell ends on June 30.

TAG Heuer Porsche driver Pascal Wehrlein gained no points on Day 1 of the Shanghai E-Prix last weekend. However, the Formula E driver was able to turn the tables in a rainy race the next day and claim second place on the podium.

The two had started in the same positions on the grid but in reverse order. It was, nevertheless, a double gain for Porsche on Sunday.Talking about the Round 11 race, Wehrlein said, “Very tricky conditions especially in the beginning, I think it got a little bit better towards the end, but our pace was good. Not good enough for P1, but quite far ahead of the guys behind. Personally I’m very happy about the result today because today was the first time that I felt like we were very competitive in the wet, which wasn’t the case in Tokyo and Monaco. I think we’ve found a good way there and in the end a happy ending for us. ”The two also scored double podiums at the Mexico E-Prix and then again in Miami, where Wehrlein won. He earned another podium at the Tokyo E-Prix.With such a strong performance this year, Wehrlein currently holds second place in the Formula E Driver Standings with 103 points.“It was a very strong result today in very tricky and challenging wet conditions,” Porsche Formula E boss Florian Modlinger stated after the double podium in Round 11. The 34 points earned from the results, plus the fastest lap by Wehrlein, also promoted Porsche to the top of the Teams’ World Championship—by a single point ahead of Nissan.“We are really happy with these points and regaining the lead in the Teams’ Championship by a single point. It will be a very hard fight to the end of the year.

We'd like to address those comments that he made I believe on the team radio. Number one, thank you for the free publicity. We'll take that any day of the week.

I was sitting at the back for a very long time; I was quite good on energy but I didn’t understand how the race was playing out. The team did a great job with the strategy because I came out of the pit lane in sixth so I thought, ‘now I can fight!’, but I need to look at the race after to understand a little bit better what’s actually happened.

I felt like my balance wasn’t quite there and I really struggled with my rears, so it wasn’t enjoyable and it was very hard to keep the car on track. I was slow to be honest, but good enough for a podium – two cars from the team are on the podium so that’s always positive.”Talking about his third-place finish, he added, “I’m happy for Nick [Cassidy], he did a really good job, but we’ve got good points. Starting second and finishing third is not ideal – in the beginning I thought we had something, but then it was clear to me that I didn’t have the pace of the two cars in front, so it was all about bringing the podium home.”Antonio now stands third in the 2025 Formula E Driver Standings with 88 points.Taking to Instagram after the race, Antonio Felix Da Costa shared a picture of himself spraying champagne from the podium. He wrote along with it, “Today we got a podium. P3 on a very rainy day. We keep fighting. Thanks guys.”Many congratulated him in the comments section. One fan wrote in his praise, “You drive great and make Portugal proud beyond its borders. You will win the championship. I believe in you. Go for it.” Another said, “A weekend where I can see your smile. Thank you too.” One more added, “Let’s go.”Also Read: Shanghai E-Prix 2025 Round 11 results: Nick Cassidy wins, Porsche duo Pascal Wehrlein and Antonio Da Costa take 2nd and 3rd spot Da Costa has claimed four podiums this season but is still waiting for a win.

Suryakumar Yadav press conference: On India T20I Playing XI, personal form and more

NAGPUR: Over the last two years, India in T20Is have been an irresistible force. Powered by a batting unit packed with big-hitters and attacking stroke-makers, a balanced bowling attack with full of variety, the reigning World T20 champions have won 72% of the matches in this period.With their playing XI sorted for the T20 World Cup, a bilateral series barely three weeks ahead of the marquee event should ideally have been all about last-minute fine-tuning for India.The Kiwis, though, with their recent exploits, have forced India to approach the five-match series, beginning in Nagpur from Wednesday, as more than just a dress rehearsal for the T20 World Cup. Just 447 kms away, on Sunday, New Zealand won their first ODI series in India in Indore. A couple of years ago, the Kiwis broke India’s 12-year invincible home record in Tests with a 3-0 clean sweep.Up against their nemesis of sorts, India are led by a man desperately trying to rediscover his form. With Suryakumar Yadav at the helm, India perfected the art of winning T20Is. The captain, though, has been plagued by diminishing returns when it comes to consistency.In the last 22 T20Is, Suryakumar has averaged just 12.84 without a fifty to his name.It’s to his credit that his poor form has not affected his decision making and captaincy. But can that continue when more pressing engagements lie ahead in a high pressure environment like a home World Cup? It’s a situation Indian fans dread. The Indian camp would be hoping that the marauding Suryakumar of the past turns up at the Jamtha Stadium on Wednesday and for the rest of the series.Apart from the skipper’s form, India do not have too many other issues in the batting department.They would have loved to have the reassuring sight of Tilak Varma walk in at no.3 though. Sadly, the left-hander is recuperating after abdominal surgery. With Shubman Gill out of the T20I scheme of things, Sanju Samson is assured of his preferred opening slot along with Abhishek Sharma. Samson has a terrific record as a T20I opener — three centuries in 18 innings, a strike rate of 178, and a 32-plus average.On the eve of the match, Suryakumar announced that Ishan Kishan will be India’s No 3 batter on Wednesday. While the skipper and Hardik Pandya complete the batting line-up, the remaining lone slot is expected to be a toss-up between Rinku Singh, Shivam Dube and Shreyas Iyer. In the bowling department, Jasprit Bumrah will be making a comeback along with Varun Chakravarthy.Having won their first Test and ODI series in India recently, New Zealand will be looking for an encore in the T20 format too. With the likes of skipper Mitchell Santner, Devon Conway, Daryl Mitchell, Glenn Phillips, Rachin Ravindra and Jacob Duffy in their ranks, New Zealand have the firepower to spring a surprise.Kiwi coach Rob Walter said that Michael Bracewell’s participation in the series depends on his recovery from an injury. Pacer Kristian Clarke was added as a backup for the first three T20Is.While chasing is the ‘in thing’ in T20s, the past few games at Jamtha Stadium indicate it is not a wise decision. Of the last four matches in Nagpur, teams that have opted to chase have lost thrice. The only exception was the eight-over shootout, which India won by six wickets against Australia in 2022.",India face New Zealand in a five-match T20 series starting in Nagpur on Wednesday. New Zealand won their first ODI series in India in Indore on Sunday.

NEW DELHI: Questions around leadership often surface after a series defeat, and India’s 1–2 loss to New Zealand has been no different. This time, the spotlight has fallen on captain Shubman Gill and his on-field decisions during crucial moments.Former India spinner R Ashwin offered a straightforward assessment as he broke down where he felt India fell short and why experienced captains are often valued more in tight situations.Speaking on his YouTube channel, Ashwin explained what separates great captains from good ones.“Why do we praise Rohit Sharma and MS Dhoni so much as captains? Because they know where to use the resources and when to bring the resources, and against which batsman. That was a little missing. You shouldn't lose confidence in a bowler on the basis of the previous game,” he said.Ashwin felt the middle overs played a major role in deciding the series.India, according to him, failed to apply enough pressure when New Zealand’s middle order was settling in.He believed this was more about planning than execution. The bowling options were there, but they were not used at the right time.Kuldeep Yadav ’s handling drew specific criticism. Ashwin felt the left-arm spinner could have been more effective if trusted with short, aggressive spells.“I would have loved to see two-over spells. If the same Glenn Phillips had to encounter Kuldeep Yadav through the middle overs in two-over spells... give one run to Daryl Mitchell, try and bowl round the stumps. If you use the resources properly and if there is a failure, then it's done. The point is, you bowl your best bowlers at the right time.”According to Ashwin, Gill seemed cautious during pressure moments. He suggested past performances may have influenced those calls. He also felt there was no clear Plan B once momentum shifted.","Former India spinner R Ashwin breaks down where he felt India fell short.

Jay Shah’s 2036 Olympic blueprint for India: '8 Medals won’t cut it'

Poll What do you think about the railway's decision to penalize the athletes? It was justified It was unfair They could have handled it better

NEW DELHI: India’s leading pole vaulter and current national record holder, Dev Meena, and his teammates, including interuniversity champion Kuldeep Yadav, were left stranded for hours at Maharashtra’s Panvel station and missed their connection to Bhopal after railways officials told them to pay a ‘penalty amount’ for carrying their equipment (pole vaults) inside the coach, which the ticket examiners referred to as “steel pipes”.Poles are made from lightweight fibres, primarily fibreglass and carbon fibre, and each pole weighs two kg with a dimension of 5mx5mx61cm.Their ordeal started soon after they reached Panvel station following an overnight journey from Mangaluru, venue for the All India Inter-University championships. Yadav won gold after clearing the horizontal bar with a leap of 5.10m, while Meena finished fourth after suffering a bout of fever a day before his competition round on Jan 15th. Meena’s personal best jump of 5.40m set at the World University Games in 2025 is the current Indian record in pole vault.“Our team of seven athletes, including junior girls’ players, and our coach Ghanshyam Yadav had booked ourselves on two trains for our return journey, Mangaluru to Panvel and then to Bhopal. We were carrying a total of 10 new poles with us, each costing Rs 2 lakh. We reached Panvel at around 12 pm on Saturday (Jan 17) and had our onward train to Bhopal scheduled at 3:50 pm,” Meena told TOI.“When we were sitting in a waiting room, a senior Travelling Ticket Examiner (TTE) came and asked us about our poles. We told them that we are international athletes and were returning from a domestic competition in Mangaluru. Later, another TTE joined in, and both told us to pay a penalty amount (fine) of Rs 8,000 for carrying unbooked luggage (UBL),” added the champion vaulter.“We reasoned with the TTEs, but they refused to listen. They said the 10 poles weigh around 80kgs, but they weighed 20kgs in all. We were made to wait at the station for 4-5 hours and missed our scheduled train,” he said.Meena recalled that the TTEs called up Railways Protection Force (RPF) personnel to keep a watch and told them that they shouldn’t be leaving without paying the fine. “Our coach (Yadav) intervened and pleaded with folded hands to let us go, but they were not ready to budge. Later, we paid Rs 1,865 as fine to the railways and got our equipment released from the RPF. We booked ourselves on another train to Bhopal which departed at 7 pm, resulting in all the team members paying extra money,” Meena added.Later, the Divisional Railway Manager (DRM) office for the Mumbai division of the central railway (CR) issued a statement, stating: “On 17/01/26, at PNVL station, pipes were found with passengers. They are more than permitted dimensions, which can cause inconvenience to fellow passengers if carried in passenger coaches. Passengers were advised to carry it in the SLR luggage compartment. They were charged (Rs 1,865) under unbooked luggage. The passengers were not deboarded from any train. They were not kept waiting for 5-6 hours.”","India’s leading pole vaulter and current national record holder, Dev Meena, and his teammates, including interuniversity champion Kuldeep Yadav, were left stranded for hours at Panvel station. railways officials told them to pay a ‘penalty amount’ for carrying their equipment (pole vaults) inside the coach.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126922440,imgsize-43130,width-400,resizemode-4/kuldeep-yadav-and-dev-meena.jpg"

Bangladesh squad for T20 World Cup:

NEW DELHI: Bangladesh captain Litton Das raised fresh questions over his team’s participation in the upcoming T20 World Cup after Rangpur Riders were knocked out of the Bangladesh Premier League (BPL) on Tuesday.Litton was speaking after Rangpur lost a tense, low-scoring qualifier to Sylhet Titans. Chasing just 112, Sylhet won off the last ball when Chris Woakes hit Faheem Ashraf for a six. Rangpur’s exit came moments before Litton walked into the press conference.Asked whether the slow pitches in the BPL were good preparation for the T20 World Cup, Litton replied bluntly: “Are you sure we are going to play in the World Cup?”“In fact, there is still a long time to go before the World Cup, and we are not even certain whether we will go at all. This is by no means an ideal wicket for T20 cricket. We had expected a much better wicket for a qualifier match,” Litton said, as quoted by Bangladeshi media The Daily Star.When questioned if the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) had discussed its World Cup decision with him, Litton was clear.“No,” he said. Asked if such a discussion should have happened since he is the T20I captain, he added, “I don't know, but it hasn't happened with me.”The uncertainty comes after Bangladesh rejected what it called “unreasonable conditions” set by the ICC for participating in the T20 World Cup in India.Youth and Sports Adviser Asif Nazrul said Bangladesh would not accept pressure. “If the ICC bows to pressure from the Indian cricket board and imposes unreasonable conditions on us, we will not accept them,” he said.Nazrul also pointed to past examples. “There are precedents in international cricket, when India refused to play in Pakistan, the ICC changed the venue. We have reasonably asked for a venue Change,” he added.The issue escalated after Mustafizur Rahman was removed from IPL 2026, following which BCB reiterated it would not tour India under the current situation.While ICC sources say Bangladesh were given a January 21 deadline, BCB has denied this. Media committee chairman Amjad Hossain said, “no specific date” has been set. He explained that discussions are ongoing and the ICC will respond later.For now, ICC remains firm on the schedule. Bangladesh are set to play group matches in Kolkata and Mumbai starting February 7. With the opener just weeks away, Bangladesh’s World Cup participation remains uncertain.Litton Das (C), Tanzid Hasan, Parvez Hossain Emon, Saif Hassan, Tawhid Hridoy, Shamim Hossain, Quazi Nurul Hasan Sohan, Shak Mahedi Hasan, Rishad Hossain, Nasum Ahmed, Mustafizur Rahman, Tanzim Hasan Sakib, Taskin Ahmed, Shaif Uddin, Shoriful Islam",Bangladesh captain Litton Das questions team's participation in T20 World Cup.

Allan Donald on Virat Kohli’s legacy: Can he reach 100 centuries?

Poll Do you agree with the decision to remove the A+ grading category from the BCCI Central Contracts? Yes, it's a good change. No, it should remain.

MUMBAI: A major overhaul in the BCCI ’s Annual Central Contracts system, changes that could reshape the hierarchy of Indian cricket’s elite players, could come into play for the 2025-26 season.Sources tracking developments revealed that the Ajit Agarkar-led national selection committee has proposed doing away with the Grade A+ category which was introduced in 2018 altogether, a move that would directly impact senior stalwarts Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma.As per the existing policy, a cricketer in A+ category is paid Rs 7 crore annually, Rs 5 crore in A, Rs 3 crore in B and Rs 1 crore in C.It is likely that in the retainers for 2025-26, players will only be bracketed in A, B and C categories, instead of the existing four-tier system. Sources privy to the discussions indicate that the A+ category is likely to be scrapped if the model receives approval from the BCCI’s apex council.In the previous cycle, only four players — Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, Jasprit Bumrah and Ravindra Jadeja — were included in the A+ category.However, there is unlikely to be any pay cut for Bumrah and other A contract holders.Since Rohit and Kohli do not play in all three formats there is speculation that they could be placed in B category, which currently carries a retainer of Rs 3 crore. It’s clear, however, that Bumrah and Test and ODI captain Shubman Gill will be in the highest paid ‘A’ category.“This suggestion will be discussed in the BCCI’s next apex council meeting,” a source told TOI. The apex council is expected to deliberate on the proposal in its next meeting, where clarity will also emerge on whether the monetary slabs will be revised too.The existing 2024-25 central contracts list also featured Mohammed Siraj, KL Rahul, Shubman Gill, Hardik Pandya, Mohammed Shami and Rishabh Pant in Grade A, while Grade B included Suryakumar Yadav, Axar Patel, Kuldeep Yadav, Yashasvi Jaiswal and Shreyas Iyer. Spinners Kuldeep and Washington Sundar, who has a Grade C contract currently, play in all the formats.Grade C generally includes a large pool of emerging players.Central contracts are annual retainers paid in addition to match fees and serve as both financial security and an indicator of a player’s standing in the national setup.","The A+ category is likely to be scrapped if the model receives approval from the BCCI’s apex council.

India begin their final build-up to the T20 World Cup with a five-match home series against New Zealand, starting Wednesday, and the spotlight will firmly be on captain Suryakumar Yadav. With the tournament less than three weeks away, the series doubles up as a crucial dress rehearsal for the defending champions and a personal test for the skipper, whose leadership numbers have been impressive but batting form a growing concern.Since taking over as India’s T20I captain in 2024, Suryakumar has led the side to a winning percentage north of 72, masking his struggles with the bat for a prolonged period. However, playing at home with expectations of becoming the first team to successfully defend a T20 World Cup title, the pressure is now unavoidable.India’s T20 unit has largely been on cruise control over the last two years, powered by clearly defined roles and strong IPL performers. New Zealand, though, arrived high on confidence after achieving several historic firsts in India across formats. While India remain favourites in T20Is, Suryakumar’s form could prove the decisive subplot in a series designed to sharpen minds before the global showpiece.The five-match T20I series between India and New Zealand will be played from 21 January to 31 January.The matches will get underway at 7:00 PM IST, with the toss scheduled for 6:30 PM IST.The matches will be broadcast live on the Star Sports Network.The matches will be live stream on JioHotsar app and websiteLive updates and coverage of the matches will be available onSuryakumar Yadav (captain), Abhishek Sharma, Sanju Samson (wk), Ishan Kishan, Shreyas Iyer, Hardik Pandya , Shivam Dube, Axar Patel, Kuldeep Yadav, Jasprit Bumrah, Varun Chakravarthy, Rinku Singh, Arshdeep Singh, Ravi Bishnoi, Harshit Rana.Mitchell Santner (captain), Devon Conway, Bevon Jacobs, Daryl Mitchell , Glenn Phillips, Tim Robinson, Jimmy Neesham, Ish Sodi, Zak Foulkes, Mark Chapman, Michael Bracewell, Rachin Ravindra, Kyle Jamieson, Matt Henry, Jacob Duffy, Kristian Clarke.","India begin their final build-up to the T20 World Cup with a five-match home series against New Zealand, starting Wednesday.

Bangladesh cricket in turmoil: What it means for the T20 World Cup?

NEW DELHI: There have been no talks between the global cricket governing body, ICC, and Scotland about replacing Bangladesh at next month’s ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2026, according to a report from BBC.The report suggests that the position is clear for now. But Scottish players are ready if a call ever comes.Bangladesh have told the ICC they will not travel to India for the tournament. They have raised concerns over political tensions between the two countries and asked for their matches to be moved to Sri Lanka, the co-hosts.Scotland are currently the highest-ranked team not playing in the upcoming T20 World Cup. This puts them in line as a possible replacement if Bangladesh pull out.However, a report from BBC suggests that the ICC has not contacted Cricket Scotland yet.Scottish officials are also not planning to approach the ICC. They say this is out of respect for the Bangladesh Cricket Board.Scotland missed out on qualification for the 2026 T20 World Cup after finishing fourth in last summer’s Europe Qualifier. The Netherlands and Italy took the two available spots.Scotland are ranked 14th in ICC T20 rankings. With players back in training, they are preparing for a one-day tri-series against Namibia and Oman in March.Reports suggest a final decision on Bangladesh’s participation could come soon.The ICC has not clarified how it would choose a replacement if a team withdraws.In 2009, Zimbabwe pulled out of the T20 World Cup, and Scotland replaced them. That system no longer applies clearly due to regional qualification.The BCB has already denied reports of a January 21 deadline from ICC. Director Amzad Hossain explained what happened in talks with the ICC.""Last Saturday, January 17, an ICC representative came. A meeting was held with a delegation from our Cricket Board. There, we clearly conveyed our position regarding the World Cup participation and informed them that we are unable to play at the specified venue, and we requested an alternative venue. A detailed discussion took place with their representative. At that time, they told us that they would inform the ICC about these matters and later communicate the decision to us. However, they did not mention any specific date or timeline for when they would inform us—only that they would let us know the next date.

Shubman Gill on missed chances, fielding lapses & World Cup preparation after ODI series loss

Poll What do you think is the main reason for India's recent ODI losses? Excessive changes in the lineup Lack of clarity in player roles Inadequate coaching strategies Strong opposition teams

NEW DELHI: Former India batter Ajinkya Rahane has delivered a blunt assessment of what he believes is going wrong in the Indian team under head coach Gautam Gambhir , following the side’s 1-2 ODI series defeat to New Zealand at home. Calling for clarity, security and honest conversations, Rahane said India’s recent struggles in the 50-over format were a result of excessive changes and a lack of defined roles as the team builds towards the 2027 ODI World Cup.India began the three-match series on a positive note with a win in the opener under Shubman Gill , but losses in the next two games handed New Zealand the series. Even Virat Kohli ’s standout performances were not enough to turn the tide.Speaking on Cricbuzz, Rahane did not shy away from highlighting uncomfortable truths. “See, there will be tough questions. India lost five ODIs in the last nine. And that’s the reason: too many changes,” he said. “You are looking at the World Cup, where players actually need that security, that clarity from management. If you are going to play certain players in that format, it’s always about clarity.”Under Gambhir, India have now lost ODI series to Sri Lanka, Australia and New Zealand, raising concerns about direction and continuity.Rahane stressed that results would improve if the management focused on communication and stability. “So yes, tough questions will be asked, which is very natural,” he added, pointing out how deeply fans are emotionally invested in Indian cricket.Rahane also underlined the weight of expectations in home conditions. “Especially in India, playing against New Zealand, which was probably the New Zealand A or B team, due respect to all the players. But expectations were there that we all thought India would win easily, probably 3-0,” he said, while also praising New Zealand’s execution.Despite the criticism, Rahane believes the scheduling break could work in India’s favour. India do not play another ODI until July 2026, when they tour England, and he feels the gap offers the management time to reset. “They just need to follow the process. Just see which are the players you are going to back,” Rahane said. “You have time. After T20, there’s nothing at all.”Emphasising the need for decisive planning, he concluded, “It’s always about finding your right thing, right players, right combination, and just back them.”",Former India batter Ajinkya Rahane has delivered a blunt assessment of what he believes is going wrong in the Indian team under head coach Gautam Gambhir.

Shubman Gill on missed chances, fielding lapses & World Cup preparation after ODI series loss

Poll What should Kuldeep Yadav focus on to improve his performance? Experiment with different strategies Stick to his original style Seek advice from seniors

NEW DELHI: Former India spinner Ravichandran Ashwin has raised concerns over Kuldeep Yadav ’s confidence heading into the T20 World Cup after the wrist-spinner endured a difficult ODI series against New Zealand. Kuldeep, expected to be a key pillar of India’s spin attack in the sub-continent showpiece, managed just three wickets across the three-match series and was repeatedly targeted by New Zealand’s batters.The most damaging blows came from Daryl Mitchell , who enjoyed a dream run at No. 4, registering three consecutive half-centuries, including back-to-back hundreds, as the Black Caps clinched the series 2-1. Mitchell’s proactive approach against spin, particularly Kuldeep, tilted the balance decisively in New Zealand’s favour.Speaking on his YouTube channel, Ashwin said the timing of Kuldeep’s struggles could not be worse. “New Zealand batters took the proactive approach against the Indian spinners by taking them on immediately. Kuldeep Yadav is one of the finest bowlers. He has all the tools. But before the T20 World Cup, his confidence would have come down a bit,” Ashwin said.Ashwin, however, was quick to stress that the phase should be treated as a learning opportunity rather than a setback. He urged Kuldeep to become more flexible and experimental when faced with batters in top form. “My only submission to Kuldeep Yadav would be asking him to experiment a little more,” Ashwin said. “When a batter is batting as well as Daryl Mitchell is against you, and wickets aren’t falling, we have to make the play. ”The former off-spinner pointed out that Mitchell’s scoring areas offered clues that could have been exploited. “His wagon wheel will show you no runs on the offside because of a closed bottom hand. I am concerned that Kuldeep didn’t do this in all three ODIs,” Ashwin noted.Ashwin also broadened the discussion to India’s overall spin approach in ODIs, suggesting there was room for growth. While Kuldeep bore the brunt of New Zealand’s aggressive batting, Ravindra Jadeja went wicket-less in the series. “Many saw (Jayden) Lennox’s bowling and criticised Jadeja and Kuldeep’s bowling,” Ashwin said. “Yes, both are in a situation where they have to expand their game. Both the Indian spinners can be a bit more creative.”",Former India spinner Ravichandran Ashwin has raised concerns over Kuldeep Yadav ’s confidence heading into the T20 World Cup.

It was a mammoth score of 574/6 that they posted to surpass the previous mark of 506/2 and set a new List A world record.Amid the noise, what one forgot to address was that while Bihar first started playing first-class cricket in 1935-36 while Arunachal Pradesh made their Ranji Trophy debut in the 2018-19 season.It was only from 2003-04 till the 2017-18 season that Bihar didn’t play in the domestic tournaments following the formation of Jharkhand. But cricket continued to be played and followed in the state and many players from Bihar shifted to Jharkhand to continue their career including former India captain MS Dhoni.However, in Arunachal Pradesh, where football remains the first love, cricket came to be taken seriously only after the state was granted full member status in July 2018 following Lodha Committee recommendations and made their debut in domestic cricket that same year.One such cricketer was Nabam Abo. At 34 years of age, he made his first-class debut in 2022 and went on to play 13 matches for Arunachal, including List A and T20 games.Abo, however, took up the sport only after Arunachal got the full member status. Before that he used to be a VFX artist.“Some of the kids used to train near my house, so I set up the nets and started playing with them and got quite good at it,” remembers Abo, “I participated in the panchayat and district level tournaments and later gave trials for the state team and got selected. Abo returned figures of 9 for 79 in his debut Ranji match against Bihar.Having retired last year, he has now turned his focus on producing budding cricketers and has set up an indoor training facility in state capital Itanagar called Academy for Cricketing Excellence.“We bring coaches from other states to come and train the players here from Feb to Sept. Last year, we got Gautam Yadav from Bihar to train the 50-60 kids we have at the academy,” added the former Ranji bowler.While there are three such academies in the capital, the current players, including their star batter Techi Doria, prefer going to other states for professional training.“Last time I went to Gujarat to train under Monty Desai. Before that I had also gone to Lucknow and Bengaluru,” says Doria., one of the most successful players from Arunachal, who has two List A centuries and multiple first-class half centuries.Doria was in the team that went down to Bihar in that fateful match but rather than beating themselves over it, he wants to see it as a one-off incident. “We have beaten Bihar earlier in Ranji Trophy, too, but that day we dropped multiple catches. Also, the match took place at the Oval Ground in Ranchi where run scoring is easier,” adds the batter.It’s not the first time that Oval Ground has seen such records being made. Even when Arunachal Pradesh took on Railways in Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy during the 2023-24 season, Railways batter Ashutosh Sharma scored a half-century off just 11 balls, the fastest T20 fifty by an Indian batter.Doria, however, wants to put that game behind him and focus on the future which he believes is bright. “We need to take the positives from the season and just work hard. This time we won one match, next time we can maybe win three matches and make it to the Elite group next season,” he says.However, for this to happen, a key requirement is the establishment of a dedicated cricket ground. “We have procured land for a cricket stadium and ground four years ago. We have also approached BCCI for funding to make this ground complete where we can conduct Ranji Trophy matches like in other states. But we are still waiting for the funding,” says Arunachal Cricket Association secretary Nabam Vivek.The biggest positive though is that the interest in cricket has grown among the people in Arunachal. Also, the number of registered players has risen from 210 in 2018-19 to 308 in 2025-26. And former player Abo believes it will continue to rise due to the career opportunities the sport provides.“The kids are aware that they have a future in cricket. Even for the women, there are so many tournaments nowadays. They at times doubt themselves because of the lack of their physical qualities but you don’t need that in cricket since it’s a technical game, and anyone can succeed if they work hard,” adds the former player.Those aspirations were on display at the Balo Dachak T20 tournament, a local competition held for the second year in a row in Jan, and Doria is hopeful it will help more talent break through ahead of the next domestic season.",Bihar first started playing first-class cricket in 1935-36. Arunachal Pradesh made their Ranji Trophy debut in the 2018-19 season. Bihar didn't play in domestic tournaments following formation of Jharkhand. Many players from Bihar shifted to Jharkshand to continue their career.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126919584,imgsize-211068,width-400,resizemode-4/team-arunachal-pradesh.jpg"

Former India cricketer Sanjay Manjrekar has come out in support of head coach Gautam Gambhir after India’s surprising ODI series loss at home to New Zealand. The defeat raised many questions among fans and experts, but Manjrekar believes the reaction has been blown out of proportion.Speaking in a video shared on his official Instagram account, Manjrekar asked fans to take a step back and look at the bigger picture. According to him, bilateral ODI series do not carry the same importance as major global tournaments. He feels this is especially true in modern-day cricket.“Honestly, in 50-overs cricket today, what really matters are the World Cups and not even the Champions Trophy,” Manjrekar said.He explained that World Cups leave a lasting impact, while other tournaments fade quickly from memory.“If you try and remember the last three Champions Trophy winners, you'll struggle to remember those. But the 50-over World Cup, you'll remember each winner from the time the World Cup started.”Manjrekar added that setbacks in smaller series should not cause panic. In fact, he believes such losses can sometimes help teams reset and improve before bigger events.“So, yes, if you want to have your setbacks and poor performances, get it out of the system now, in time for the next World Cup,” he said.He went on to downplay the overall value of bilateral series, calling them more like preparation games.“These bilateral series are scheduled, but they're mostly warm up games and one shouldn't read too much into them,” Manjrekar explained.He stressed how quickly such results are forgotten. “In fact, the importance of these bilateral series has become such that, two weeks later, no cricket fan also remembers the result of what happened in that bilateral ODI series.”Manjrekar also challenged the idea that current form always decides success at World Cups. “It's all about the World Cups and form coming into the World Cup is really not a big indicator of who's going to win the World Cup,” he said.","Former India cricketer Sanjay Manjrekar has come out in support of head coach Gautam Gambhir after India’s surprising ODI series loss at home to New Zealand.

Adrian Birrell press conference: 'We didn't quite get going with the bat' vs MICT

The team culture is fantastic and it's led very well by Adrian Birrell. He's a Eastern Cape boy. The Eastern Cape people, they're very homely people. They love their home ground. They're very humble as well. And I know for a fact that Birrell tried to drive that into his players. Mark Boucher

Sunrisers Eastern Cape (SEC) have made the SA20 playoffs for four seasons running and were champions in the first two. In the third season, they finished runners-up and their fate for the fourth, the ongoing tournament, remains to be determined.Like the second season of the SA20, SEC qualified for the playoffs by topping the standings — alongside Pretoria Capitals, Paarl Royals and Joburg Super Kings. As per the format, Sunrisers will face Pretoria Capitals in the first qualifier at Kingsmead on Wednesday (January 21). If they win that match, they advance straight to the final at Newlands on January 25. If they lose, they get another chance via the second qualifier route.SEC were the first team to qualify for the knockouts with five wins. Tristan Stubbs-led team’s dominance was evident in the four bonus points they collected, the most in the six-team competition.When asked, former South Africa players JP Duminy and Mark Boucher credited coach Adrian ""Adi"" Birrell for the success of the franchise. The former South Africa assistant coach has held the job for all four seasons and the results speak for themselves.""He's an advocate to create a great environment where people feel that they can come in and be themselves and really just focus on being their best version through their performances,"" said JP Duminy in an interaction facilitated by the SA20.Duminy spoke highly of the SEC's seam bowling attack and the leadership that the franchise has had whether it was Aiden Markram earlier or Tristan Stubbs now.​​""Everything rises and falls on leadership most times and when you have a great coach creating a great environment and a captain that is leading through performance, people want to follow that sort of leadership style,"" said Duminy.Born and raised in Makhanda, Birrell understands the Eastern Cape province and the expectations of the boisterous brass band that creates plenty of noise at St George's Park better than most people.The 65-year-old played his school and first class cricket for Eastern Province, before turning to coaching. Locally he has overseen the Titans and Warriors before shifting focus to Ireland, South Africa, Hampshire and now SEC.Ex-South Africa wicketkeeper-batter Boucher, who was also born in the Eastern Cape, said Birrell's 'fantastic' approach to the squad reflects the people of the province.​​""I think the team culture is fantastic and it's led very well by Adrian Birrell. He's a Eastern Cape boy. The Eastern Cape people, they're very homely people. They love their home ground. They're very humble as well. And I know for a fact that Birrell tried to drive that into his players. We've seen video clips of him walking into a changing room and saying to all the players, 'you must get to learn every person's name around the ground, from your backroom staff, the people who come in and collect the plates. ' There's a lot of respect for the people around,"" stated Boucher.""So it doesn't surprise me that they've been like that. You always see them as probably the best fielding side in the team. And fielding is largely about attitude. So they've all got great attitudes. They understand what their roles are. And they go out there and they just want to win. And they win in a gracious way as well. They keep their feet on the ground. And I think that's largely driven by Adrian,"" continued Boucher.Birrell's philosophy can be understood through his remarks after SEC's loss to MI Cape Town last week. Despite having qualified already, Birrell admitted to being ""hurt"" by the three-wicket defeat. ""You can look at it philosophically: it’s difficult to win four or five games in a row to win the trophy, so maybe a loss isn't the worst thing,” he had said.​​​When posed the ultimate question -- what makes them so successful -- Birrell, like all good coaches, opted to credit the team.“We’ve had good teams. We've got another good team this year, and we’ve played a good style of cricket,"" he claimed.“We’ve produced some good wins and when we’ve lost we’ve only just lost. We’ll take confidence into the back end of the tournament,” he continued.Backed by strong performances from Quinton de Kock (328 runs), Jordan Hermann (212 runs), Jonny Bairstow (205 runs), Anrich Nortje (14 wickets), Adam Milne (11 wickets) and Marco Jansen (10 wickets), SEC enter the playoffs as the two-time champions, current season's table-toppers, and with a spring in their step, courtesy of Eastern Cape's very own sitting on the sidelines.","Sunrisers Eastern Cape have made the SA20 playoffs for four seasons running. They were champions in the first two seasons and finished runners-up in the third. Former South Africa players JP Duminy and Mark Boucher credited coach Adrian ""Adi"" Birrell for the success.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126837314,imgsize-336370,width-400,resizemode-4/adrian-birrell-sec-sportzpics.jpg"

Rohit the captain marvel

The memories of January 15, 2023, remain deeply etched into the fabric of Thiruvananthapuram’s Greenfield International Stadium. Long after the floodlights dimmed and the crowd dispersed, the echoes of thunderous sixes, crisp boundaries and deafening cheers seemed to linger in the humid Kerala air. For everyone present that night — fans, players, officials — it was an experience that felt historic even as it unfolded.India had already sealed the three-match ODI series against Sri Lanka by winning the opening two games. The final encounter was meant to be a formality, an opportunity to complete a clean sweep. Few, however, could have predicted that the contest would turn into one of the most one-sided matches in the history of the format, producing a record that would stand tall for years.Batting first, India piled on a colossal 390 runs, a total built almost entirely on the brilliance of Virat Kohli and Shubman Gill. The duo stitched together a monumental partnership, scoring 282 runs between them and completely flattening a Sri Lankan bowling attack that had no answers. Kohli’s masterclass and Gill’s elegance transformed what was expected to be a competitive total into a near-impossible chase.Sri Lanka’s response was nothing short of catastrophic. Under relentless pressure, they folded for a mere 73, with only three batters managing to reach double figures. India’s 317-run victory became the biggest margin of victory in ODI history — a record that would remain intact for two years before England eclipsed it.India completed a flawless 3-0 series triumph by dismantling Sri Lanka in the final ODI, delivering a crushing 317-run defeat that rewrote the record books.On a flat surface that offered little for bowlers, Kohli produced yet another statement innings, registering his 46th ODI century. At the other end, Gill continued his meteoric rise, reinforcing his credentials as India’s long-term opening option with his second hundred. Their dominance propelled India to a formidable 390/5, a score that left Sri Lanka staring at a mountain far too steep to climb.What followed was a total collapse. Sri Lanka were bowled out for just 73 runs inside 22 overs — their fourth-lowest total in ODIs. Mohammed Siraj led the charge with the ball, exploiting movement and seam to rip through the top order. His spell of 4 for 32 was the best of his ODI career. Mohammed Shami and Kuldeep Yadav provided excellent support, picking up two wickets apiece and maintaining relentless pressure.Siraj struck early, drawing Avishka Fernando into edging a delivery straight to first slip. In his next over, he unleashed a wobble-seam ball that forced Kusal Mendis to nick behind to the wicketkeeper. Shami then joined the act, inducing Charith Asalanka into mistiming a shot to backward point.The carnage continued as Siraj picked up his third wicket when Nuwanidu Fernando chopped an outswinger onto his stumps. In the final over of the powerplay, he produced another wobble-seam delivery that jagged back in to uproot Wanindu Hasaranga’s off stump.With half the side back in the dressing room, panic spread through the Sri Lankan camp. That nervousness resulted in a bizarre run-out, with Chamika Karunaratne caught out of his crease after a defensive shot, allowing Siraj to hit the stumps directly at the striker’s end.Kuldeep then took charge in the middle overs, luring Dasun Shanaka forward before beating him through the gate. Dunith Wellalage, who came in as a concussion substitute after a collision while fielding, lasted briefly before chipping a simple catch to point off Shami.With injuries reducing Sri Lanka’s resistance further, Kuldeep wrapped up the innings by knocking over Lahiru Kumara, sealing a staggering victory. Kohli’s unbeaten 166 off 110 balls earned him both the Player of the Match and Player of the Series awards.When discussing the biggest ODI wins by margin of runs, India feature twice in the top five — a remarkable achievement made even more special by the fact that both victories came under Rohit Sharma ’s leadership.After orchestrating the historic win against Sri Lanka in January 2023, Rohit etched his name deeper into cricketing folklore just ten months later. During the ICC World Cup in November 2023, India once again turned Sri Lanka into their victims, hammering them by 302 runs in a high-stakes tournament clash.That World Cup encounter at Mumbai’s Wankhede Stadium was equally ruthless. Siraj, Shami and Jasprit Bumrah tore through Sri Lanka’s batting line-up, bundling them out for just 55 and sealing India’s seventh straight win of the tournament. The result confirmed India’s place in the semi-finals and underlined their dominance.Chasing 358, Sri Lanka had no response to India’s pace battery. Shami, already in sensational form after nine wickets against New Zealand and England, added another five to his tally. The top order collapsed in stunning fashion, with the first five scores reading like binary code: 0, 0, 1, 0, 1.By the time Shami removed the seventh and eighth batters for ducks, Sri Lanka were on the brink of registering the lowest ODI total ever. They were eventually dismissed in 19.4 overs, as India completed the fourth-biggest ODI win in history. Shami’s figures of 5 for 18 also made him India’s leading wicket-taker in World Cup history.It marked the third instance in 2023 where India dismissed Sri Lanka for under 100 in ODIs — and their second victory by a margin exceeding 300 runs in the same year — further cementing Rohit's era as one defined by dominance and record-shattering performances.","India completed a flawless 3-0 series triumph by dismantling Sri Lanka in the final ODI, delivering a crushing 317-run defeat that rewrote the record books. Virat Kohli produced yet another statement innings, registering his 46th ODI century. Shubman Gill continued his meteoric rise, reinforcing his credentials as India’s long-term opening option.

Suryakumar Yadav press conference: On India T20I Playing XI, personal form and more

India squad for T20I series against New Zealand:

NEW DELHI: Ahead of the first T20I against New Zealand on Wednesday, India’s T20I captain Suryakumar Yadav sounded confident despite a lean run in the shortest format. The right-hander endured a difficult 2025 in T20Is, failing to score a single half-century in 21 matches (19 innings). He managed 218 runs at an average of 13.62, with an unbeaten 47 as his highest score.Speaking at the pre-match press conference, Suryakumar said he has been batting well in the nets and is not keen on changing his approach, which has brought him success over the last few years.The India skipper stressed that he would continue playing his natural game and is prepared to reassess and work harder if the results do not follow.""Every game we play in a series is crucial. We try to get something out of it. I have been batting really well at the nets and also talking about the runs; it will definitely come, but at the same time, I can't do things differently. I don't want to change my identity. What has given me success in the past 3-4 years, I would like to bat the same way. And then if performance comes, I will take it. If it doesn't come, then I will go back to the drawing board, practice again, work hard and come back stronger,"" Suryakumar said.Suryakumar also acknowledged that India will miss Tilak Varma and Washington Sundar, both ruled out of the series due to injuries. However, he pointed out that their absence has opened doors for others to step up.""Injury is a big part of a sportsman's life. So, we can't do anything about it. It's not in anyone's control. But at the same time, someone else will get an opportunity to play. I mean, we will obviously miss Tilak and Washington as well. They have done so much for the Indian team whenever they have played this format. But at the same time, someone will have to play in their place. We can't go without nine people. But yeah, someone will get an opportunity, and I wish them all the best,"" India T20I captain said.On January 16, the BCCI confirmed that Washington Sundar had been ruled out of the five-match T20I series. The all-rounder reported discomfort in his lower rib area while bowling during the first ODI against New Zealand in Vadodara on January 11.Subsequent scans and an in-person consultation revealed a side strain, following which Sundar was advised rest before reporting to the BCCI Centre of Excellence for further treatment.Leg-spinner Ravi Bishnoi has been named as Sundar’s replacement. The Men’s Selection Committee has also added Shreyas Iyer to the T20I squad for the first three matches, replacing the injured Tilak Varma, who recently underwent surgery for an abdominal issue.The first T20I between India and New Zealand will be played at the Vidarbha Cricket Association Stadium on January 20.Suryakumar Yadav (captain), Abhishek Sharma , Sanju Samson (WK), Shreyas Iyer (first three T20Is), Hardik Pandya , Shivam Dube, Axar Patel (vice captain), Rinku Singh, Jasprit Bumrah, Harshit Rana, Arshdeep Singh, Kuldeep Yadav, Varun Chakaravarthy, Ishan Kishan (wicketkeeper), Ravi Bishnoi.","Suryakumar Yadav has failed to score a half-century in 21 T20Is.

NEW DELHI: India captain Suryakumar Yadav has explained why Ishan Kishan will play ahead of Shreyas Iyer in the T20 series against New Zealand. He said the decision is mainly because Ishan is part of India’s T20 World Cup squad and is a like-for-like replacement for injured Tilak Varma, who is a left-hander.Tilak, who is usually an automatic choice at number three, has undergone abdominal surgery and is ruled out of the first three matches starting Wednesday.His injury opened the door for Shreyas Iyer to return to the national squad, but only for those initial games.However, the captain made it clear that Iyer is being seen as a number five batter.Suryakumar said, “Ishan will bat at number 3 because he is a part of our T20 World Cup team and he was picked in the squad first so it's our responsibility to give him a chance.” He also pointed out Ishan’s hard work, saying, “He hasn't played for India for past one and half year and in the mean time consistently performed in domestic cricket.”Explaining further, he added, “Since he (Ishan) has been picked for World T20, he deserves to play ahead (of Shreyas). Had it been a question of batting slots Nos 4 or 5, it would have been a different question altogether. Unfortunately, Tilak isn't there so Ishan is our best bet.”The T20 World Cup begins on February 7 and will be co-hosted by India and Sri Lanka.When asked about batting at number three himself, Suryakumar said he is flexible. “I have batted at both positions for India. My stats at No. 4 are sightly better although they are good at No. 3 also. But then we are flexible with that,” he said.He added, “We will see and if the situation demands that we have to send a right-hander… then, I will go in, otherwise Tilak (now injured) has been doing really well at number three.”Speaking about his own form, Suryakumar admitted struggles but remained confident. “I've been out of runs. But I can't change my identity,” he said, adding, “If the performance comes, I'll take it, if it doesn't, it's back to the drawing board.”He ended by stressing team success over personal form, saying, “This is team sport and my first responsibility is to ensure that my team does well.”",Ishan Kishan will play ahead of Shreyas Iyer in the T20 series against New Zealand.

NEW DELHI: India wrist-spinner Kuldeep Yadav is known for making frequent appeals during his spells. He is also often seen urging his captains to go for DRS reviews — calls that do not always work in India’s favour.Former India captain Rohit Sharma was recently asked if he had any advice for Kuldeep ahead of the ICC T20 World Cup next month, especially with team management facing a selection call between Kuldeep and Varun Chakaravarthy.The former T20 World Cup and Champions Trophy-winning skipper, fondly known as the ‘Hitman’, responded in a straightforward manner, albeit with a cheeky smile.""The biggest challenge will be how they play them together, combination agar banana ho toh dono ko saath me aap tabhi khela sakte ho jab aap do hi seamer ke saath khelo (If you want to build a combination, you can only play both of them when you go in with just two seamers.)""Rohit was then asked if he had any advice for Kuldeep regarding his tendency to push for DRS calls. Here’s what Rohit Sharma had to say:""Koi advice nahi hai bhaisab ko. Ball daal apna chup chap aur peeche ja, har ball pe you can't appeal yaar (There’s no advice for him. Just bowl your ball quietly and go back. You can’t appeal on every delivery.)""Kuldeep featured in the recently concluded three-match ODI series against New Zealand, which India lost 1-2.The left-arm wrist-spinner picked up three wickets across the three matches.Kuldeep Yadav has been a regular member of the Indian team across formats for several years. He was also part of the ICC T20 World Cup 2024 and ICC Champions Trophy 2025-winning squads led by Rohit Sharma.He is included in India’s squad for the five-match T20I series against New Zealand and is also part of the team for the T20 World Cup, which begins on February 7.",Kuldeep Yadav is known for making frequent appeals during his spells.

'I completely understand the booing': Kylian Mbappé responds to fans’ treatment of Vinícius Júnior,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/i-completely-understand-the-booing-kylian-mbapp-responds-to-fans-treatment-of-vincius-jnior/articleshow/126704155.cms,"Kylian Mbappé of Real Madrid celebrates (Photo by Juan Manuel Serrano Arce/Getty Images)

A tough week

Kylian Mbappé criticized Real Madrid fans for singling out Vinícius Júnior and booing the star forward in the team's Spanish league match on Saturday.Mbappé said fans are entitled to boo when they are unhappy, but should criticize the whole squad and not specific players.“I understand the fans,” Mbappé said Monday ahead of the team's Champions League game against Monaco on Tuesday.“Before I was a player, I was a young guy who watched football, was critical and gave his opinion. I completely understand the booing, but if they're going to do it, they should boo the whole squad, not just a few players. We're all playing poorly.”Madrid beat Levante 2-0 on Saturday to end a slide in form that included a loss to Barcelona in the final of the Spanish Super Cup in Saudi Arabia last weekend and an embarrassing elimination against second-division club Albacete in the round of 16 of the Copa del Rey on Wednesday.The crowd at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium on Saturday jeered loudly when Vinícius' name was announced before the match against Levante, and again nearly every time the Brazil forward touched the ball.“It's not Vini's fault we're not playing as well as we'd like. The whole squad is to blame,” Mbappé said. “That's the only thing I have to say to the fans. Boo the whole squad. We have to turn the situation around. We're all to blame.We're going to do just that because we're Real Madrid players and there are always moments like this.Mbappé said Vinícius was affected by the boos and said the whole squad had to try to support him.“Vini is a human being,” Mbappé said. “It's normal to be affected when people speak negatively about you. Sometimes it's fair, sometimes it's not. Vini is a fantastic player. He's an incredible man. I'm lucky to know him, and I'm very fond of him. We as a team have to protect him better so he's not in this position of being alone against everyone. We're going to protect him so he can give us his best, because when he's at his best, he's one of the best in the world. ”The fans also booed Jude Bellingham and Federico Valverde on Saturday. The trio was considered by many to be among those who were not behind former coach Xabi Alonso, who was fired following the team's loss to Barcelona in the Spanish Super Cup. Alonso was replaced by former B-team coach Álvaro Arbeloa.Mbappé said he spoke with Alonso after his departure and wished him well.“I had a wonderful relationship with him. I wish him all the best because I liked how he viewed the game,” Mbappé said.“He's a coach who's obsessed with the game and the details, and he knows a lot about modern soccer. It's a decision by the club that we have to respect. Now there's a new coach, and we have to support him. We're going to give it our all to ensure things go well for both Arbeloa and Real Madrid.”Mbappé was among the players telling Alonso that they would not do the guard of honor to Barcelona in the awards ceremony at the Spanish Super Cup, an image many said showed a break between Alonso and the players in the locker room.“I'm not going to play dumb,” Mbappé said. “Of course, things go on. There are a lot of things said that ultimately aren't true. I don't think that's right. Our job is to accept it, but when I have the opportunity to speak out, I do so. We have to keep quiet and do our talking on the pitch.”Mbappé said it “hasn't been an easy week” for Madrid and the match against Monaco could prove to be a turning point.“We have to show our character to change these kinds of circumstances and to get everyone back on side,” he said.“I think the fans are eager to give us their support, but we have to earn it. We have to keep fighting for all the titles, and tomorrow the most important thing is the Champions League. We're going to show as a team that we can compete and that we're ready to win all the titles we have left this season.”Madrid sits in seventh place in the league phase of the Champions League. The club trails Barcelona by a point in the Spanish league.","Kylian Mbappé says Real Madrid fans are entitled to boo when they are unhappy.

Lionel Messi India tour: Inside story of what went wrong in Kolkata

Drama unfolded in the Africa Cup of Nations final on Sunday as Senegal survived chaos to win the title. With Senegalese players walking off the pitch, fans clashed with security. However, a missed Panenka penalty changed everything.The final was played at the Prince Moulay Abdellah Stadium in Rabat. Senegal and Morocco were locked at 0-0 deep into injury time. Morocco were then awarded a penalty after a VAR review. The decision was for a challenge on Brahim Diaz.Senegal were already angry. Minutes earlier, they had a goal ruled out for a soft foul. The referee did not check VAR for that moment. When the penalty was given, Senegal players reacted in fury. Some of them walked off the pitch in protest.The situation grew worse in the stands. Senegal fans tried to enter the field. They clashed with security staff. The match was stopped for almost 20 minutes.Eventually, play resumed. Diaz stepped up to take the penalty. He tried a weak Panenka. Senegal goalkeeper Edouard Mendy saved it.Watch:In extra time, Senegal stayed calm. In the fourth minute, Pape Gueye scored a brilliant goal.It was the only goal of the match. Senegal won 1-0 and lifted the trophy.""We had a feeling of injustice. Just before the penalty we thought we should have had a goal and the referee didn't go to VAR,"" said Villarreal midfielder Gueye. ""Sadio told us to come back on and we remobilised. Edouard then made the save, we stayed focused, got the goal and won the game.""Senegal coach Pape Thiaw admitted fault. ""After thinking about it, I realised that I shouldn't have asked them to go off. I apologise for that,"" Thiaw told French broadcaster beIN Sports.""Sometimes you can react in the heat of the moment. Before that we scored a goal that was not given. But now we accept that referees do make mistakes and we apologise.""This was Senegal’s second AFCON title. Their first came four years ago in Cameroon. That final was decided on penalties against Egypt.Gueye’s goal was historic. It was Senegal’s first ever goal in four AFCON finals.""We are very happy with the victory tonight,"" said Gueye.

LONDON: Aston Villa's Premier League title challenge suffered a huge blow in a 1-0 defeat against Everton, while Newcastle's push towards the top four was derailed by a 0-0 draw at Wolves on Sunday.Unai Emery's side could have closed to within four points of leaders Arsenal if they had beaten Everton at Villa Park.But they wasted the chance to put pressure on the Gunners with a limp performance that was punished by Thierno Barry's second-half winner.After Arsenal's goalless draw at Nottingham Forest on Saturday, Mikel Arteta's men are seven points clear of third-placed Villa.Second-placed Manchester City are also seven points behind the leaders following their 2-0 loss at Manchester United on Saturday.Arsenal are chasing a first English title since 2004 and the stumbles from City and Villa this weekend have tightened their grip on the title race.""There are other teams with more potential than us,"" Emery said of Villa's fading title chances.""We lost a very good opportunity. We did a very good season until now, but today we lost.""We had our chances, we didn't score and they had less chances, but they scored.""Adding to Villa's woes, their captain John McGinn limped off with a first-half injury.Villa had won their previous 11 home games in all competitions.But Everton's Merlin Rohl nearly shattered that feeling of invincibility in just 11 seconds when he capitalised on sloppy defending to shoot against the post.Despite being a boyhood Villa fan, Everton winger Jack Grealish was loudly jeered on his return to his former club.Grealish almost silenced his tormentors with a goal-bound volley that was blocked by Evann Guessand.Everton's Jake O'Brien headed home from a corner, only to see his effort disallowed for offside against Harrison Armstrong.Villa went close just before half-time when Youri Tielemans's cross picked out Guessand and the Ivory Coast forward looped his header onto the bar.But Emery's men lacked a cutting edge and they paid the price in the 59th minute.- Newcastle frustrated -It was a shambolic goal to concede as Pau Torres carelessly surrendered possession just outside his own area.Dwight McNeil pounced with a shot that Emiliano Martinez pushed out to Barry and the striker chipped the ball into the net from close range for his third goal in his last five appearances.Goalkeeper Jordan Pickford preserved Everton's victory with a brilliant tip-over from Morgan Rogers's curler, leaving Villa with only one win from their last four league games.At rain-lashed Molineux, Eddie Howe's Newcastle were unable to prise open the Wolves defence as two points slipped away.Wins over Burnley, Crystal Palace and Leeds had bolstered their bid to qualify for next season's Champions League.But the Magpies are stuck in eighth place after failing to beat bottom-of-the-table Wolves.Following their disappointing 2-0 defeat against Manchester City in the League Cup semi-final first leg on Tuesday, it was another frustrating result for Newcastle.""We needed to do more in attack. I expected us to do better and create more,"" Howe said after Newcastle took 85 minutes to muster a shot on target.""Football is such a strange game. We scored four against Leeds and looked free-scoring, but today we struggled.""Nick Woltemade has now gone seven games without a goal, scoring just twice in 13 appearances after squandering two good headed chances.With crucial matches against top-four rivals Aston Villa and Liverpool looming before the end of the month, Howe's men must get back on track quickly.Wolves are now unbeaten in four league games but still sit 14 points from safety.",Aston Villa lose 1-0 at home to Everton in the Premier League.

Sorloth winner for Atletico

MADRID: Disallowed goals, hitting the woodwork five times, and great saves.It was just too much for Barcelona to overcome on Sunday as it lost 2-1 to Real Sociedad in the Spanish league to see its 11-game winning streak come to an end.Barcelona had three goals disallowed — as well as a penalty-kick call reversed by video review — in the first half alone. It had five attempts hit the woodwork, including an 84th-minute header by Jules Koundé from close range, and Sociedad goalkeeper Álex Remiro made a series of impressive saves.""Disappointed, we created a lot of opportunities. The result does not reflect our game,"" Barcelona coach Hansi Flick said.""Sometimes it's like that. At the end, there are some days you invest a lot of energy and at the end you are unlucky. I appreciate a lot what I saw.""The loss left the Catalan club one point ahead of second-place Real Madrid, which beat Levante 2-0 at home on Saturday.It was the second consecutive win for Sociedad, which moved to eighth place.""Three amazing points,"" said Remiro. He made one terrific close-range save off a header by Robert Lewandowski in the second half.Mikel Oyarzabal put the hosts ahead with a volley by the far post in the 32nd minute. Barcelona equalized with a header from Marcus Rashford in the 70th but a minute later Gonçalo Guedes put Sociedad ahead again with a shot from inside the area.Barcelona had plenty of chances throughout the match. It thought it had taken the lead a few minutes into the game when Fermín López scored with a low shot from outside the area, but the goal was disallowed by video review for a foul by Dani Olmo on Sociedad's Takefusa Kubo in the buildup.Barcelona also had a goal by Frenkie de Jong called back for offside in the 21st and another by Lamine Yamal in the 27th.Yamal was awarded a penalty in first-half stoppage time but the call was reversed because he was offside.""We played well, had many scoring opportunities,"" De Jong said.""We deserved to win. We need to be able to capitalize on these chances.""Sociedad's Carlos Soler was sent off in the 88th for a hard foul.Barcelona had won 11 in a row across all competitions in a streak that included a 2-1 victory over Real Madrid in the final of the Spanish Super Cup in Saudi Arabia last weekend. It hadn't lost since a 3-0 road defeat against Chelsea in the league phase of the Champions League.Its last Spanish league loss had been a 2-1 defeat against Real Madrid in the first clasico of the season at the Santiago Bernabeu Stadium in October.Barcelona forward Raphinha was not included in the squad for Sunday's match. João Cancelo made his debut off the bench in the second half after recently signing with the Catalan club.Kubo had to be taken off the field on a stretcher in the second half because of an injury.Alexander Sorloth scored early in the second half to give Atletico Madrid a 1-0 home win over relegation-threatened Alaves.Sorloth struck in the 48th minute with a firm header from near the penalty spot after Pablo Barrios crossed from the right flank. The ball hit the post at the far corner before going in.It was the 10th start in 19 league games for Sorloth this season. The Norway forward has six goals, three with headers.Alaves, winless in five straight league games, came close to equalizing a few times late in the match at the Metropolitano stadium in the Spanish capital.Alaves has seven losses in its last nine league games, with its only win, 1-0, against Real Sociedad in December.Earlier Sunday, Valencia moved out of the relegation zone by winning 1-0 at Getafe with an 84th-minute goal by José Gayà.The result ended Valencia's six-game winless streak in the league. Getafe is now winless in six consecutive league games, with five losses.Celta Vigo routed 10-man Rayo Vallecano 3-0 at home.

KOCHI: Manisha Kalyan’s journey has never followed the well-trodden path. Her move from India to Peru is another sharp turn taken with purpose. From Gokulam Kerala’s relentless pressing game to the demanding rhythms of South American football , the left winger has stepped into what she calls the “next level” of learning.Peru’s Alianza Lima Femenino signed Manisha from Greek club PAOK FC, the South American club announced on Friday.Alianza Lima Femenino will be the third overseas club in Manisha’s career. After playing for Sethu FC and Gokulam Kerala at home, the 24-year-old joined Cyprian club Apollon Ladies FC in 2022. She became the first Indian footballer to compete in the UEFA Women’s Champions League. She scored 14 goals in 36 matches for Apollon Ladies.In 2024, Manisha joined Greek club PAOK FC.Manisha, however, gained in prominence at home, when she featured for Gokulam Kerala FC from 2018 to 2022, a club in which she notched up 21 goals in 24 appearances.Now, having already tested herself in Greece, Manisha is clear about her progression. The level in Europe, she admits, was good.""Peru, though, feels different...it's more professional, more exacting, and far less forgiving.Training sessions are longer, sharper, and layered with detail. Fitness is non-negotiable. Technique is constantly refined. Tactical drills, focus on ball positioning, timing and awareness being in the right place at the right time,"" she tells TOI.For Manisha, this is not a leap of faith so much as the next step in a carefully built learning process. She speaks like a player still in her apprenticeship, not someone content with milestones already reached.The move, on a one-year contract, is about absorbing football education in its most purest form. ""There is still a lot to learn and improve and there's no better place to do that than here in Peru. In terms of technique and fitness, I think this is where I want to be at this stage of my career,"" she explains.""How to read space, how to stretch a back line from the left wing, and how to make decisions under pressure are things I'm looking to learn,"" she adds.There is quiet pride, too, in how far she has come. From Hoshiarpur in Punjab to Greece and now Peru, Manisha carries the imprint of Indian footballers who are hungry to improve. Gokulam Kerala shaped her edge and ambition. In Peru, in a more demanding environment, she believes she has found the classroom she was looking for.","Peru's Alianza Lima Femenino sign Manisha Kalyan from Greek club PAOK FC.

- A step forward -

MADRID: Angry Real Madrid fans jeered their own team before they went on to beat Levante 2-0 in La Liga on Saturday to record new coach Alvaro Arbeloa's first win at the helm. Villarreal, third, stumbled to a 2-0 defeat at Real Betis, hampering their attempts at mounting a title challenge.Arbeloa's debut after replacing Xabi Alonso ended in a humiliating Copa del Rey defeat in midweek at second-tier Albacete, but second-half goals from Kylian Mbappe and Raul Asencio secured Madrid three vital points at a moody Santiago Bernabeu.Second-place Madrid cut the gap on leaders Barcelona to one point before the in-form Spanish champions visit Real Sociedad on Sunday.Star players Vinicius Junior and Jude Bellingham came in for ire from the home fans after a disastrous week. Mbappe also started but was spared the jeers.The French forward had been expected to return for the Champions League game against Monaco next week as he manages his recovery from a knee sprain.""I've always respected the Bernabeu (crowd), they whistled me a lot too (as a player), and it's one of the aspects that make this club so great, how demanding the fans are,"" said Arbeloa, defending the right of the fans to express themselves.It was Arbeloa's 43rd birthday and he was eventually able to celebrate with a victory, although his team lacked energy and spark in the first half.That was not the case in the stands as a significant part of the crowd harangued their own team, in response to a wild week at the club.Los Blancos lost the Spanish Super Cup final to rivals Barcelona in Saudi Arabia on Sunday, parted ways with Alonso on Monday and then crashed out of the cup on Wednesday.Some fans also chanted for president Florentino Perez to resign in a sour atmosphere in the Spanish capital.Mbappe had the best chance of a flat first half against the team in 19th in La Liga. Reaching a long ball the French superstar met it with a volley that flew wide of the post.Home fans jeered their side in at the break and Madrid emerged for the second half with more impetus, with Arbeloa bringing on Franco Mastantuono and Arda Guler.Mbappe drew a foul in the area from Adrian de la Fuente to earn a penalty, which he dispatched for his 19th league goal of the campaign.Mbappe has scored 50 goals in 53 La Liga games, taking only a little longer than Real Madrid's all-time top goalscorer Cristiano Ronaldo to reach the milestone.The Portuguese managed it in 51 appearances.Asencio doubled Madrid's advantage with a header into the top corner from Guler's corner as the hosts took control.Bellingham came close to adding a third but Mathew Ryan parried his header and then saved Vinicius's effort after a darting run from the Brazilian.Ryan thwarted Bellingham again as tensions calmed by the end, with the crowd temporarily sated by the victory. Unless Madrid can build on it, the jeers and whistles will return.""Today was a very important day, playing in front of our fans, we wanted to turn around the situation,"" Asencio told Real Madrid TV.""What happened at Albacete should not have happened, we felt guilty and we wanted to make things better.""Elsewhere, Vedat Muriqi scored a hat-trick for Mallorca in a 3-2 win over Athletic Bilbao, before Villarreal fell to defeat at La Cartuja.Aitor Ruibal and Pablo Fornals's second-half goals helped Betis earn an impressive victory over Marcelino Garcia Toral's visitors.The loss leaves Villarreal eight points behind leaders Barcelona and damaged their chances of competing for a first-ever La Liga title.Betis had more of the ball in an otherwise even first half before Ruibal volleyed them ahead after 57 minutes.Santi Comesana's red card for a rash challenge on Giovani Lo Celso made Villarreal's job harder and Fornals killed the game by drilling home with precision from outside the area with seven minutes remaining.""It was a hard-fought game, the details led to Betis winning, I think a draw would have been fairest,"" Villarreal midfielder Dani Parejo told Movistar.""We lacked the finishing touch but had some clear chances... I think the team showed up well, but in both boxes we weren't quite good enough.""","Real Madrid beat Levante 2-0 in La Liga on Saturday to record new coach Alvaro Arbeloa's first win at the helm. Second-half goals from Kylian Mbappe and Raul Asencio secured Madrid three vital points at a moody Santiago Bernabeu. Villarreal, third, stumbled to a 2- 0 defeat at Real Betis, hampering their attempts at mounting a title challenge.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126636463,imgsize-60004,width-400,resizemode-4/real-madrid-1801-getty.jpg"

'India's dream of FIFA World Cup is still alive': Veteran footballer Ashalata Devi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/indias-dream-of-fifa-world-cup-is-still-alive-veteran-footballer-ashalata-devi/articleshow/126613772.cms,"Ashalata Devi (PTI Photo)

Indian women’s football stalwart Ashalata Devi says the dream of seeing the country play at the FIFA Women’s World Cup remains alive, but stressed that sustained progress at the grassroots level is crucial to bridge the gap with the world’s elite.“Our dream of the World Cup is still alive. We still have to work even harder at this time,” Ashalata told PTI.The veteran defender pointed out that all three national teams -- Under-17, Under-19 and the senior side -- have qualified for their respective AFC Asian Championships, making 2026 a potentially defining year for the women’s game in India.“Under-17, Under-19 and the senior team have already qualified for AFC (competitions). If we do well there, obviously our dream of the World Cup is still alive,” she said.One of the most capped players in Indian women’s football history, Ashalata -- who has earned over 100 international caps and captained the national side on multiple occasions -- said the (senior) team has made steady progress but is still short of world-class standards.“We have been doing better for a long time, but still according to world-class levels, we are not there yet.Still, we are trying a lot,” she said.“I have so much faith in the players. Their passion, hard work and dedication — they have been working for so many years. I really hope this time we qualify for the World Cup and do better for Indian women’s football.”Having spent more than a decade anchoring India’s defence, Ashalata identified grassroots development as the biggest area needing immediate attention.“The problem is that we skip the basics and go straight to the technical aspects,” she said.“In my time, I started playing football at the age of 13. Now many players start at 10 or 11. But if we start at five or six years, learning becomes much better.”She emphasised that skill acquisition becomes increasingly difficult with age.“After 17 or 18 years, teaching skills like ball control becomes very difficult. By then, players play more by expression than learning. That’s why grassroots football is very important,” she added.While acknowledging the role of the All India Football Federation (AIFF), the senior pro said responsibility must also lie with state associations.“AIFF has a big role, but every state has its own association. They must show interest and take initiative. Everything cannot be done only at the top level,” Ashalata said, adding that consistency at the state level is essential to create a sustainable pipeline of talent.Off the field, Ashalata has already begun planning her contribution to the game beyond her playing career through the Ashalata Devi Football Festival (ADFF), which she started along with fellow India international Aditi Chauhan in Imphal.“I never knew what I would do after retirement other than football. I still feel connected to football and I wanted to do something for it,” she said.Drawing from her own experiences, Ashalata said the Festival aims to ensure young players do not have to choose between football and education.“When I was young, I couldn’t manage football and school together because there was no academy near my house. I don’t want the next generation to face what I struggled with,” she said.The initiative, which focuses on combining football training with education, has already exceeded expectations.“I planned for around 50 players, but almost 47–48 kids came. I never expected such a response, and I’m really happy,” Ashalata signed off.","Ashalata Devi is one of the most capped players in Indian women’s football history. The veteran defender has earned over 100 international caps and captained the national side on multiple occasions. All three national teams -- Under-17, Under-19 and the senior side -- have qualified for their respective AFC Asian Championships.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126614242,imgsize-24626,width-400,resizemode-4/ashalata-devi-pti-photo.jpg"

Ahead of the Manchester derby at Old Trafford on Saturday, Manchester United striker Benjamin Sesko reflected on adjusting to the Premier League 's intensity, his goal-scoring form, and praised the interim manager Michael Carrick's detail-oriented approach.Carrick stepped in as the Man Utd manager after Ruben Amorim was sacked from his job.Speaking exclusively to, Sesko shared his thoughts ahead of the Manchester derby: ""Life in Manchester is great so far—I love the city and the top-class training ground. Training here is always fun. Off-pitch, I enjoy coffee shops and good restaurants.""""It's been really good—a totally new life, everything on another level. Once your body and mind adjust, you see how great it is and what a pleasure to play for this club. So far, I've really liked it.""“Premier League is on another level. Everything is way faster; you must be perfect every second, no time to think twice. Plus, everyone is very physical.""“The transition is big, so body and mind need time to adapt to the speed.It takes a couple of weeks or months.""“The work I've put in, plus teammates now understand my movements and effort on chances. Hard work always pays off—this shows in my last two games with 2-3 goals.""“It's true—scoring sparks confidence instantly. For me, the key is helping the team now; team success is everything. I want us to win together, contributing goals to secure victories.""“That moment was crucial—I positioned to score. Video shows it looked pre-planned, but it flowed naturally. Hard work off the pitch on positioning pays off in those key moments.""""He's a legend here who knows the club inside out. I like him as a person and coach—this week's training has been excellent, leaving us well-prepared. Everyone's enjoying it and looking forward.""""I sense his energy and the knowledge he instils in us—he's highly detailed, which I love. We'll get along great as a team. Looking forward to working with him.""""I'm really looking forward to it—this derby means so much to fans and is special by name alone. We're prepared, believe we can play well, stay organised, and give our best.""""It'd be massive to beat them—they've dominated for a decade, but it won't be easy. We must stay focused and detail-oriented; one lapse means conceding. Everyone needs to be 100 percent.""","Benjamin Sesko speaks exclusively to JioHotstar ahead of Manchester derby.

A.J. Brown Trade Rumors: Eagles could move star WR to reset cap and offense,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/a-j-brown-trade-rumors-eagles-could-move-star-wr-to-reset-cap-and-offense/articleshow/126915563.cms,"A.J. Brown Trade Rumors: Eagles could move star WR to reset cap and offense(Getty)

Eagles weighing A.J. Brown trade as cap pressure builds

The Philadelphia Eagles ended their season the same way it felt for months. Frustrating, messy, and full of questions. A wild-card loss on Jan 18, 2026, closed the book on a year that never really found its rhythm.Now, the spotlight has shifted to the offseason. And one of the biggest names on the roster sits right in the middle of it. A.J. Brown, the face of the Eagles’ passing game, has become a serious trade candidate as the front office looks for ways to reset both the locker room and the salary cap.The rumors gained real traction on Jan 20, when ESPN insider Jeremy Fowler discussed Brown’s situation during a segment that aired on SportsRadio 94WIP in Philadelphia.“An A.J. Brown trade is possible this offseason,” Fowler said on the show. “Some league executives have felt that way since October.”Fowler explained that if the Eagles designate Brown as a post-June 1 trade, the team could clear around $7 million in cap space. That flexibility could help Philadelphia rework a roster that already carries several big contracts.Brown’s 2025 season looked solid on paper but felt quieter than usual.He finished with 78 catches, 1,003 yards, and seven TDs. Those numbers marked a step down from his dominant stretch in previous years.Around the league, many believe the dip came from changes in the offense. TE Dallas Goedert saw more targets, and the passing game never settled into a clear identity.Still, talent is not the question.“He’s an immediate upgrade for any team,” an NFL personnel evaluator told ESPN. “You plug him in and the whole offense looks different.”Brown turns 29 in June 2026, which keeps him firmly in his prime. That age, combined with his résumé, makes him one of the most attractive trade pieces on the market.The Buffalo Bills remain one of the teams most closely linked to him. Josh Allen continues to search for a true No. 1 receiver.“The Bills need help at wideout,” the evaluator said. “Khalil Shakir is good, but he’s not that guy defenses fear.”Other teams showing interest include the Titans, Browns, 49ers, and Raiders. Tennessee and Cleveland both want reliable targets for young quarterbacks. San Francisco keeps chasing offensive stability. Las Vegas plans to draft Fernando Mendoza in 2026 and could use a proven veteran to ease that transition.For Philly's, this goes beyond money. Brown has been a leader and one of the emotional engines of the team. But after another early playoff exit and growing tension inside the offense, the Eagles may finally choose a clean break.If they do, A.J. Brown will not just be traded. He will reset the entire offseason market in one move.","A.J. Brown, the face of the Eagles’ passing game, has become a serious trade candidate.

Robert Kraft confirms NFL moving toward 18-game season with focus on international growth,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/robert-kraft-confirms-nfl-moving-toward-18-game-season-with-focus-on-international-growth/articleshow/126912423.cms,"Robert Kraft confirms NFL moving toward 18-game season with focus on international growth(Getty)

Robert Kraft says 18 games now inevitable as NFL eyes global market



The NFL has stretched its season once already, and it may not be done yet. Five years after adding a 17th regular-season game, the league now appears ready to take another step that could reshape professional football.New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft publicly confirmed that an 18-game season is no longer a distant idea. He said the league sees international growth as the main reason behind the move.Kraft shared his views during an interview with ""98.5 The Sports Hub"" in Boston. He made it clear that league owners believe the NFL has almost reached its ceiling inside the United States.“We’re going to push like the dickens now to make international more important with us,” Kraft said on the radio show. “Part of the reason is so we can continue to grow the cap and keep our labor happy.”Kraft added that the NFL already dominates American television. He said the league controls “93 of the top 100 programs on television,” which leaves little room for further domestic growth. That reality, according to Kraft, forces the league to look overseas.He also confirmed that league officials already have a rough structure for an 18-game season.Under the current plan, each team would play 18 regular-season games and two preseason games. One preseason matchup would get removed.“Every team will go to 18 and two and eliminate one of the preseason games,” Kraft said during the same interview.The NFL first moved to a 17-game season in 2021 after the new collective bargaining agreement was approved in 2020. Since then, international games have expanded steadily. The league now plays regular-season games in London, Germany, Mexico, and Brazil, with more cities expected in the future.Still, player safety remains the biggest obstacle. On Feb. 8, 2025, NFL Players Association executive director Lloyd Howell Jr. openly pushed back on the idea. He spoke during a media availability at the NFLPA HQs in Washington.“No one wants to play an 18th game. No one,” Howell said. “Seventeen games is already, for many of the guys, too long.”Howell also thinks that any real change must come through a formal process. The current collective bargaining agreement runs until March 2030. Till Then, the league cannot add games without player approval.For now, Kraft’s comments signal intent, not a final decision. But they also confirm what many around the league already suspected. The NFL sees international markets as the next financial engine, and an 18-game season appears to be the price of that global push.","Robert Kraft confirms NFL moving toward 18-game season with focus on international growth.

Maxx Crosby targets June return after knee surgery

Las Vegas waited weeks for a real update. On Jan. 20, 2026, Maxx Crosby finally put a precise timeline on his return. After months of playing through pain, the Raiders star confirmed he had knee surgery and now has a target date for returning to the field.Crosby did not release a statement through the team. He shared it himself, in his own words, on his podcast. That made the update feel more real. No press release. No vague language. Just Crosby explaining where his body stands and what comes next.Crosby revealed his recovery plan on the January 20, 2026, episode of The Rush With Maxx Crosby podcast.“We’re going to f****g crush this rehab better than any of the rehabs we’ve done before,” Crosby said on the show. “I know I’ll be back in June, around that time, fully. So yeah, we've got a long road ahead.”The Raiders' defensive end confirmed he underwent knee surgery earlier this month. The procedure was performed in Los Angeles and handled by Dr. Neal ElAttrache. He is the same surgeon who previously worked on Crosby’s knee and labrum.Crosby said he had planned the surgery back in September 2025. He delayed it so he could finish the season with the team.The injury first happened on October 19, 2025, during a game against the Kansas City Chiefs. From that point on, Crosby rarely practiced at full speed.Despite that, he still played through most of the season. He admitted on the podcast that his knee never felt right after the Chiefs game. But he chose to stay on the field while the Raiders pushed through a challenging year.Rehab officially began in mid-January. Crosby said he already feels progress and called the early results “incredible” during the same podcast episode. He also shared that he now spends most of his time in recovery sessions, strength work, and physical therapy.Off the field, Crosby said he uses the downtime to stay with his daughter, Ella. He also thanked his partner, Rachel, for supporting him through the process.The June timeline matters for Las Vegas. That puts Crosby on track for full participation in training camp, which usually begins in late July. If rehab stays on schedule, he should avoid missing any major offseason program.For the Raiders, this update brings relief. Crosby remains the face of their defense and one of the most consistent pass rushers in the NFL. His return in June gives the team some hope ahead.","Raiders star Maxx Crosby confirmed he had knee surgery earlier this month. Crosby did not release a statement through the team.

Micah Parsons and Sam Darnold net worth comparison: One ‘gave everything’ and still trails the other by $23 Million,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/micah-parsons-and-sam-darnold-net-worth-comparison-one-gave-everything-and-still-trails-the-other-by-23-million/articleshow/126819763.cms,"Micah Parsons trails Sam Darnold by $23 million in net worth, a gap driven by position, contracts, and timing. (Images via Getty)

Micah Parsons Net Worth Reflects Leverage, Not His Ceiling

Sam Darnold Net Worth Shows the Value of Survival

According to Marca and reporting by Anjana PV, Micah Parsons’ net worth in 2025 is estimated at $7 Million. That figure comes from his rookie contract with the Dallas Cowboys, which was worth nearly $17 Million, including a $9.8 Million signing bonus, along with multiple endorsement deals.Sam Darnold’s financial position is already far ahead. According to Pro Football Network, Darnold’s net worth is listed at $30 Million. His earnings stem from multiple NFL contracts, including his most recent deal with the Seattle Seahawks, and endorsement partnerships with major brands.This comparison is not about talent. It is about timing. Parsons’ money surge is just beginning. Darnold’s arrived earlier because quarterbacks get paid sooner and longer.Micah Parsons’ current net worth does not match his value. That is the point. Parsons entered the league on a four-year rookie deal signed in 2021. By 2025, he was earning a base salary of $2.2 Million. At the same time, he had already posted 52.5 sacks and nine forced fumbles in four seasons, becoming a three-time All-Pro and one of the league’s most dominant defenders.Contract talks with Dallas stalled. Parsons responded by requesting a trade.He put his frustration in writing and handed it directly to Cowboys executive Stephen Jones.“This was a tough decision,” Parsons wrote. “But I’ve come to the conclusion that I no longer want to be part of an organisation that won’t commit to me the way I’ve committed to it.” “I gave everything,” he continued. “I showed up. I played hurt. I played hard. I wore that star on my helmet with pride.”The result was a blockbuster trade to the Green Bay Packers and a four-year, $188 Million contract, including $136 Million guaranteed. That deal makes Parsons the highest-paid non-quarterback in NFL history, with annual earnings exceeding $47 Million.Parsons’ endorsement portfolio includes Pizza Hut, Old Spice, Nocco, Mentality, C4 Energy, and SWBC. The exact figures are undisclosed, but his commercial value has risen alongside his leverage.His net worth looks modest now because the contract money has not fully hit yet. That will change fast.Sam Darnold’s career did not follow a straight line. His bank account did. Darnold entered the NFL as the third overall pick in the 2018 NFL Draft. His four-year rookie deal with the New York Jets paid $30.2 Million, including a fifth-year option. He followed that with short-term contracts as his role shifted across teams.He signed a one-year, $4.5 Million deal with the San Francisco 49ers in 2023. In 2024, he earned $10.0 Million with the Minnesota Vikings during a season that revived his value. That run set up his biggest payday.In the 2025 offseason, Darnold signed a three-year, $100.5 Million contract with the Seattle Seahawks. The deal includes $55.0 Million guaranteed and a $32.0 Million signing bonus. His average annual value of $33.5 Million ranks 18th among quarterbacks in 2025.According to Spotrac, Darnold earned $65.2 Million through the 2024 season. His Seahawks contract could push his career earnings past $165 Million.Off the field, Darnold has endorsement deals with Nike, Bose, and Panini. He is also active in philanthropy, including long-standing involvement with the Never Ever Give Up Jessie Rees Foundation.“We did a camp with them, and a bunch of kids came out and they got to catch touchdowns from us,” Darnold said. “It was special. That kind of left a mark on me.”",Parsons’ net worth in 2025 is estimated at $7 Million. Darnold’s net worth is listed at $30 Million. Parsons’ money surge is just beginning.

While fans focus on celebrity buzz and quarterback dynamics, those inside the Chiefs see continuity as the real factor. Kelce’s strongest years came under Bieniemy, and the reunion could heavily influence whether the veteran tight end chooses to return.

A reunion that could redefine Travis Kelce’s decision

Kansas City is buzzing again, and it has nothing to do with pop stardom or quarterback contracts. Inside the Chiefs’ facility, a familiar presence is quietly shifting the tone of the offseason. The return of Eric Bieniemy has reopened a door many believed was already closed, and the ripple effects could reach the most emotional decision facing the franchise.For Travis Kelce , this moment feels personal. Retirement whispers have followed him for months, growing louder after another long season. While fans speculate about the influence of Taylor Swift or the long-term vision around Patrick Mahomes , the real pull may come from the coach who helped shape Kelce’s peak years.Bieniemy’s expected return is more than a staff move. It signals a reset toward what once made Kansas City ruthless on offense. During their years together, Kelce was not just productive. He was central, trusted, and constantly evolving. That bond has never faded, and Kelce has always spoken about it without hesitation.""Week in, week out, he has our team prepared and ready to go,"" Kelce said in February 2022. ""Everyone says it's an Andy Reid offense-he has 51%, I'm not going to say it's not.But it is a collective group putting this offense together. I ask everybody, 'Come on in, see who's standing up in front of our offense getting us ready for situational football, who's in front of us week in week out at halftime trying to make adjustments. Who is the guy that's rallying this group and has the emotion as a player and as a coach to keep us firing as an offensive unit?' And that's Eric Bieniemy.""I've been a big fan of him my entire career, he's done unbelievable things for my skillset personally and my mentality in terms of helping me grow as a player. More than deserving [of an NFL head coaching job].""For the Kansas City Chiefs, the timing is critical. Matt Nagy’s contract is expiring, continuity matters, and Kelce’s future remains undecided. Bieniemy represents comfort, belief, and unfinished business. Sometimes, legacy is not decided by contracts or headlines, but by who is back in the room when it matters most.","Eric Bieniemy's expected return to Kansas City has quietly shifted the conversation around Travis Kelce’s future.

Is Justin Herbert the mystery wolf chasing Madison Beer in her new video? Fans mock him after playoff loss,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/is-justin-herbert-the-mystery-wolf-chasing-madison-beer-in-her-new-video-fans-mock-him-after-playoff-loss/articleshow/126885828.cms,"Fans sparked a viral theory claiming Justin Herbert appeared as a wolf in Madison Beer’s music video after the Chargers’ playoff loss. The rumor fueled online mockery, with critics questioning his focus following the defeat. The speculation was later debunked when actor Austin Minard confirmed he played the role, but the episode highlighted how quickly internet jokes can snowball after big NFL losses.

Did Justin Herbert play the wolf in Madison Beer’s video?

NFL fans did not wait long to find a new target after the Los Angeles Chargers’ playoff exit. As frustration poured out online, attention shifted from box scores to pop culture, pulling Justin Herbert into an unexpected viral storm. This time, it was not about arm strength or play calling. It was about a wolf.Hours after the loss, fans began connecting dots between Herbert’s quiet public persona and a mysterious figure in his girlfriend Madison Beer’s latest music video. What started as playful speculation quickly turned into full blown mockery, fueled by timing, emotion, and the internet’s endless appetite for jokes.Beer’s song Bad Enough, released as part of her album Locket, features a dramatic chase scene. She runs through dark surroundings in a light blue dress while a werewolf-like creature follows closely behind. The imagery alone was enough to spark theories. The Chargers’ defeat only amplified them.After Herbert completed 19 of 31 passes for 159 yards with no touchdowns and took six sacks, fans rushed to social media with sharp reactions.“Doing anything but winning a playoff game,” one fan wrote. “At least He did that better than playing football in the playoffs,” added another.“Music videos: 1. Wins in playoffs: 0. Let's go Herbert!” a third fan joked.Despite the viral claims, Herbert never appeared in the video. The man inside the costume was actor and model Austin Minard, who shut down the rumors himself. “Bad Enough @madisonbeer video. Monster played by me. This was a fun one,” Minard wrote on Instagram.The speculation still says plenty about modern fandom. Herbert and Beer have kept their relationship low key since being linked last summer, even while attending games and public events together.

Kayla Nicole shares vulnerable thoughts as Travis Kelce’s future keeps wedding on hold



The spotlight has a way of circling back, even when people try to move on quietly. This week, that glare landed once again on Kayla Nicole, whose candid words about isolation struck a nerve online. As conversations swirl around Travis Kelce and his future, Nicole’s honesty offered a raw contrast to the polished headlines dominating pop culture feeds.Her message did not chase sympathy. It felt like a pause. A moment of reflection shared without filters at a time when old chapters are being publicly reopened. Fans quickly connected her emotional openness with the renewed attention surrounding Kelce and Taylor Swift , whose relationship continues to live under intense scrutiny.“Not to be dramatic, but idk if my solitude is expanding me or slowly erasing me,” Kayle Nicole said in her recent Instagram story. “The thought of re-engaging with people feels increasingly overwhelming.”Those words resonated because they spoke to something larger than celebrity. Nicole has long acknowledged how difficult it is to rebuild an identity after a high profile breakup. Her past relationship with Kelce unfolded mostly in private, yet its aftermath played out loudly.Since then, she has chosen to speak on her own terms, even when public curiosity refuses to fade.“I have learned that, for me personally, peace is just way more valuable than perception,” Nicole once said in an interview with PEOPLE magazine. “I can’t control the headlines. I can’t control what’s written about me. All that I can control is how I navigate through it.”At the same time, attention has shifted to Kelce’s next move. After a disappointing season for the Kansas City Chiefs, questions around retirement have grown louder. That uncertainty has reportedly slowed wedding plans with Swift, who is choosing patience over pressure.“Taylor is trying to put him in a better mood by spending more time with him and not bombarding him with wedding plans,” the report, quoting an insider, revealed. “She would want him to focus on [the wedding] after he makes his career decision because she knows how important that is to him.”Together, these parallel stories reveal different sides of the same moment. One person choosing solitude to protect peace. Another weighing legacy before love. And millions watching, reminded that behind the headlines are real emotions unfolding in real time.","Kayla Nicole’s candid message about loneliness has gone viral.

“He always made me feel special”: Tom Brady's ex-wife Gisele Bündchen grieves the loss of someone deeply close to her,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/he-always-made-me-feel-special-tom-bradys-ex-wife-gisele-bndchen-grieves-the-loss-of-someone-deeply-close-to-her/articleshow/126882475.cms,"Gisele Bündchen shared an emotional tribute after the death of a fashion figure who played a deeply personal role in her early career. Reflecting on his kindness, support, and belief in her during difficult years, she described him as someone who made her feel valued. Fans echoed her grief, mourning not just a designer, but a mentor and friend.

Gisele Bündchen honors Valentino Garavani as fans reflect on a timeless fashion Legacy

The fashion industry is taking a break and so is Tom Brady's ex-wife Gisele Bundchen. With all the great praise being sung after the death of iconic designer Valentino Garavani, the Brazilian supermodel has sent a very personal farewell that transcends professional praise. This loss is almost heartbreaking to Bundchen, but it comes into a chapter that defined her who she was well before she grew into being a former wife of NFL superstar Tom Brady.Though the death of Valentino as he was 93 has led to the industry to reflect on the issue, Bundchen has shed light in the words he said through their sincerity and emotional impact. The tribute of hers is not based on nostalgia itself. It shows trust, guidance and silent mercy at the most questionable period of her work. It is that human connection that has resonated so much with the fans of both the fashion and sports culture equally that her message carries such a powerful chord.Gisele Bündchen wrote, “Valentino was a true genius, an artist with a rare sensitivity and grace. I feel incredibly grateful that I had the opportunity to work with him, to know him, and to experience his kindness and generosity firsthand. He was so supportive of my career, and he always made me feel special.”Long before global superstardom, Bündchen faced repeated rejection. Valentino entered her journey at a moment when belief mattered more than exposure. Their collaboration during the late 1990s helped position her as a rising force in luxury fashion, but what stayed with her was the way he treated her behind the scenes.“One of my favorite memories will always be the fittings before his shows,” she recalled. “Normally, you’d have time for about four outfit changes, but he would sometimes give me seven. I would always wonder, how am I going to make this happen? And even though I was half disheveled from changing so fast, barely making it and running out of breath every time I stepped back onto the runway, I just wanted to make it happen for him because he was always so excited to have me wear those looks. ”Her farewell closed with quiet grace. “Farewell, Valentino. Thank you for the beauty you brought into the world and for the warmth you gave so freely. You will be deeply missed ❤️.”Fans echoed that sentiment, not mourning a brand, but honoring a man whose legacy lives on through the people he uplifted.","Gisele Bündchen shared an emotional tribute after the death of a fashion figure who played a deeply personal role in her early career.

Whispers around Tom Brady rarely stay quiet for long. A single New Year’s Eve sighting in St. Barts was enough to ignite a full-blown conversation about the former quarterback’s private world. Photos and videos of Brady sharing an intimate moment with Alix Earle spread fast, pulling fans straight back into his post-divorce narrative.The attention comes at a complicated time. Brady has faced public criticism over his appearance, business ventures, and now his dating life. Yet instead of leaning into the headlines, he chose restraint. Until now. In a rare and carefully worded interview, the seven-time Super Bowl champion offered a glimpse into how he views love, work, and balance at this stage of his life.Speaking to People, Brady did not name names or confirm romance rumours. What he did was redirect the focus. His words carried weight because of their simplicity and honesty.""You know what? I don't have much time for a personal life or much time for myself, but I love working and I love my kids,"" Brady said, in reference to daughter Vivian, 12, and son Benjamin, 15, who he shares with ex-wife Gisele Bündchen, and 18-year-old son Jack, who he shares with ex-girlfriend Bridget Moynahan.His focus, he explained, remains rooted in purpose rather than speculation. ""I like to be busy and try to really stay fulfilled in the things I'm doing, so I'm working on some really cool projects and I'm involved with some great teams of people that are doing some really positive things,"" he went on, adding: ""I'm so blessed in so many parts of my life.""That perspective reframes the St. Barts headlines. Whether Brady is casually dating, exploring a new connection, or simply enjoying freedom, his priorities appear unchanged. Work. Family. Fulfilment. The rest, for now, remains his to keep private.","Tom Brady opens up about love, work, and family amid dating speculation.

“Being blackmailed”: Sherrone Moore faces renewed scrutiny as former Michigan players break silence on what really went wrong,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/being-blackmailed-sherrone-moore-faces-renewed-scrutiny-as-former-michigan-players-break-silence-on-what-really-went-wrong/articleshow/126802918.cms,"Former Michigan players have backed Anthony Simpson’s claim that unfair internal dynamics limited his role under Sherrone Moore. Simpson alleged favoritism and pressure influenced lineup decisions, despite support from team leaders. Reactions from ex-teammates amplified concerns about culture and transparency. The episode has reopened scrutiny of Moore’s tenure and raised fresh questions about trust, accountability, and program stability moving forward.

Michigan football faces fresh scrutiny after ex-players back Anthony Simpson ’s claims

The mood around the Michigan Wolverines has shifted from uneasy to openly uncomfortable. What once felt like isolated frustration is now being spoken aloud. Former players are no longer whispering concerns privately. They are backing claims publicly, and the timing could not be worse for a program trying to stabilise its identity after a turbulent coaching chapter.At the centre of the conversation is Sherrone Moore, whose short tenure continues to draw scrutiny even after his departure. While investigations and administrative decisions closed one chapter, player testimony has opened another. This time, it is about trust, fairness, and how decisions were made behind closed doors in Ann Arbor.Former Michigan wide receiver Anthony Simpson did not quietly move on. Instead, he chose clarity. After seeing the field for just 24 offensive snaps despite a productive past, Simpson shared his experience in full view of the public. His statement struck a nerve because it went beyond playing time. It questioned integrity.""Targets vs non targets, I was the best slot receiver for Michigan and I was treated unfairly due to [Sherrone] Moore being blackmailed by players and staff members.Which jeopardized my opportunity to get on the field. Fastest player on the team and I won reps every day in practice. Only there for fall camp. Our team captains also advocated for me to play. I was denied fairness.""What followed mattered just as much. Former players Cristian Dixon and Raheem Anderson did not dismiss the claim. They reinforced it, signalling that Simpson’s words carried weight inside the locker room long before they reached social media.For Michigan, the concern is not one player leaving. It is the pattern that these comments suggest. Perception shapes recruiting, retention, and belief inside a program. When former players echo similar frustrations, it becomes more than noise. It becomes a credibility test.With a new season approaching and fresh leadership in place, Michigan has a chance to reset. But rebuilding confidence often takes longer than rebuilding a depth chart.","Michigan football faces fresh scrutiny after ex-players back Anthony Simpson ’s claims about Sherrone Moore.

PANAJI: At lunch break, when Goa's Snehal Kauthankar and Kashyap Bakle trooped into the dressing room after putting on 577 runs for the third wicket against Arunachal, the two were told they were just 18 runs short of the highest-ever partnership in Ranji Trophy history.Kauthankar had struck a triple century, while Kashyap, playing only his second Ranji game, was unbeaten on 280.On resumption, the duo went past Maharashtra's Swapnil Gugale and Ankit Bawne's record 594. The Academy ground in Porvorim erupted in joy. The two had stitched a 606-run partnership, with Kashyap too reaching a triple ton, when Goa captain Darshan Misal declared. Only later did Misal realise that the duo was just 19 runs short of a first class world record.""We came to know about the world record after declaring our innings,"" Kauthankar told TOI. ""Nobody was aware, else we would have surely gone for that record (as well).""The highest partnership in first-class cricket is the 624 runs scored by Sri Lankan pair of Kumar Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardene during a Test match against South Africa at home in 2006.""We don't have any regrets of not getting the world record. We are extremely proud of our performance. More importantly, we are now going to the Elite group,"" said the experienced Goa batter, who scored 250 in the previous game against Mizoram.Goa are playing in the Plate group, comprising six of the lowest-ranked teams. Until last season, Goa were in the Elite category but were relegated after finishing at the bottom of the pool. This season, they topped the group and qualified, winning all their five matches. In contrast, Arunachal Pradesh lost all five games, the one in Goa in less than two days.After bowling out Arunachal for 84 in their first innings, Goa declared their innings at 727-2, with Kauthankar (314* off 215 balls) and Bakle (300* off 269 balls) putting on a record partnership for the third wicket. Arunachal's second innings ended at 92 in 22.3 overs, giving Goa a win by an innings and 551 runs, a Ranji record.Goa's 727-2 was their highest score in the premier domestic cricket tournament, but it was well short of the record in Ranji Trophy. That belongs to Tamil Nadu who declared their innings at a massive 912-6, incidentally against Goa in Panaji in 1989.In that game, Tamil Nadu's WV Raman and Arjun Kripal Singh had scored 313 and 302 runs, the first instance of two batters getting triple centuries.Arunachal 84 (Nabam Tagan Abo 25, Neelam Obi 22; Arjun Tendulkar 5-25, Mohit Redkar 3-15) & 92 (Nabam 31) Lakshay Garg 4-43, Deepraj Gaonkar 2-15, Keith 2-25) lost to Goa 727-2 (Snehal Kauthankar 314*, Kashyap Bakle 300*, Suyash Prabhudessai 73).",Goa's Snehal Kauthankar and Kashyap Bakhale put on the highest-ever partnership in Ranji Trophy history. The duo went past Maharashtra's Swapnil Gugale and Ankit Bawne's record 594. Goa's 727-2 was their highest score in the premier domestic cricket tournament.

#LIVE: India preparations in Perth | 1st Test vs Australia | 1 Week To Go For #BGT | #BTB

NEW DELHI: Virat Kohli will be in the spotlight as India prepare to face Australia in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy , starting on November 22 in Perth. All eyes will be on the star batter as he aims to overcome recent struggles and make history on Australian soil.Despite a recent dip in form, Kohli has a strong track record in Australia, making it an ideal setting for him to rediscover his peak performance and leave a lasting legacy.Kohli is on the verge of achieving several significant milestones during this series.* One of the most notable milestones within Kohli's reach is surpassing Sachin Tendulkar 's record of 1,809 Test runs in Australia. Kohli currently sits at 1,352 runs in 13 Tests at an average of 54.08, needing 458 more runs to claim the top spot for an Indian batter.* Kohli is also closing in on the record for most Test centuries by a visiting player in Australia. He currently holds six centuries, putting him within striking distance of surpassing English legends Jack Hobbs (nine centuries) and Wally Hammond (seven centuries).* The Adelaide Oval holds a special place in Kohli's heart, as it's his most successful Australian venue. He has amassed 509 runs in four Tests there, averaging an impressive 63.62. With 102 more runs, he can surpass Brian Lara 's tally of 610 runs and become the highest-scoring visiting batter at this iconic ground.* Beyond Test cricket, Kohli is also in contention to top the list for most fifty-plus scores in international cricket by a visiting batter in Australia. He currently boasts an impressive 30 fifty-plus scores across all formats (11 centuries, 19 fifties), putting him in the running alongside legends Viv Richards (42) and Desmond Haynes (34).* Kohli's consistent performance in Australia extends to overall international runs. He has accumulated 3,426 runs across all formats, putting him 126 runs ahead of Sachin Tendulkar's record of 3,300 runs. He's also aiming to become the first Indian to reach 4,000 international runs on Australian soil, requiring 574 more runs to achieve this milestone.* The Adelaide Oval has been particularly kind to Kohli, as he's already notched five centuries at the venue. Scoring another century there wouldn't just make him the first visiting player to reach 1,000 runs at the venue, but also surpass Jack Hobbs' record of five centuries at the MCG.* This series will mark Kohli's 100th international match against Australia, likely during the third Test at The Gabba. This achievement would make him the second Indian to reach this milestone, joining the ranks of Sachin Tendulkar who has played 110 matches against the Aussies.* Kohli's current tally of 16 centuries against Australia puts him in a strong position to chase down Sachin Tendulkar's record of 20 international centuries against the Aussies.Having faced a challenging year with the bat, scoring just 488 runs in 19 matches across formats at an average of 20.33, Kohli will be eager to use this series as a platform for redemption. Australia has historically been a happy hunting ground for him, and his performance in this series holds the potential to shape not only the outcome of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy but also cement his legacy in Test cricket.The series begins on November 22 in Perth, followed by matches in Adelaide, The Gabba, and the Boxing Day Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. The final Test will be held at the Sydney Cricket Ground from January 3, 2025.",Virat Kohli will be in the spotlight as India prepare to face Australia in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy.

NEW DELHI: Australian Test opener Usman Khawaja emphasizes the depth of India's bowling attack ahead of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy , stating it's not just about Jasprit Bumrah While acknowledging Bumrah's impressive track record, Khawaja highlights the skills of Mohammed Siraj and Mohammed Shami “Everyone talks about Jasprit, but they actually have a lot of other good bowlers. I think [Mohammed] Siraj is a very good bowler. He's a very good bowler to both right-handers and left-handers. When [Mohammed] Shami was fit, when he was playing those series, he was a very good bowler. He was very underrated. No one really talked about him. And then they got good spinners lining up, too, which really complements their fast bowlers,"" Khawaja told Fox Cricket.""So for me it's never ... I'm just not thinking about Jasprit Bumrah. You want to ask me where do you think... I'm not thinking about where he is getting me out. I'm thinking about where am I scoring runs against him. And I'm sure all good batsmen would tell you exactly the same thing because if he misses, well, then I'm coming and then if he bowls good stuff, then I'll respect that. So that's just Test cricket,"" he added.He further explains his approach to facing India's bowlers, stating he focuses on scoring runs rather than worrying about getting out.The Border-Gavaskar Trophy commences on November 22nd in Perth.The second Test, scheduled for December 6 to 10 at Adelaide Oval, will feature the exciting day-night format under the stadium's lights.After that, fans will turn their attention to The Gabba in Brisbane for the third Test, which will be held from December 14 to 18.The customary Boxing Day Test, set for December 26 to 30 at Melbourne's storied Melbourne Cricket Ground, will bring the series to its penultimate stage.The fifth and final Test, to take place at the Sydney Cricket Ground from January 3 to 7, will serve as the series climax, promising a dramatic conclusion to an exciting contest.","Usman Khawaja emphasizes the depth of India's bowling attack ahead of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy.

A rare opportunity to bat at No. 3 was all Tilak Varma needed to justify skipper Surya Kumar Yadav 's faith. Having badgered his skipper to be allowed to bat at his favourite position, the southpaw seized the opportunity at SuperSport Park to score a marvellous 107 (56b; 8x4, 7x6), his first international century, and set up an 11-run win for India in the third T20I against South Africa.Varma had reservations about the dual nature of the pitch when he came in to bat. ""Bahut slow hai (it's too slow),"" he was heard telling partner Abhishek Sharma after he came out to face the third ball of the innings. A top edge that grazed the helmet proved a minor distraction and he soon found his bearings.""He (Surya) gave me an opportunity to bat at No. 3,"" Tilak said. ""I love to bat at No. 3 or 4, but in the last two matches I played at No. 4. Last night (on Tuesday), Surya came to my room and said that I'll bat at No. 3. I told him that I'll perform. That's why I pointed the bat at him,"" Tilak said of his celebration after reaching his maiden T20I century. Tilak was under a bit of pressure coming into this game — his previous two outings in this fourmatch series at No. 4 saw him score 33 in Durban and 20 in Gqueberha.Earlier this year, in the IPL, Tilak suffered an injury and missed training for two months. Having missed two T20I series in the process, he needed a big knock to prove his mettle and regain confidence.""I suffered an injury in the last game of the IPL. I missed series in Zimbabwe and Sri Lanka. I was feeling very bad but I was patient and focused on my process. I worked very hard,"" Tilak said.Fortunately for him, the Indian team management has been very supporting and encouraging. With such emphasis on aggressive intent, the youngsters are looking to emulate the brand of cricket India played en route to winning the T20 World Cup this year. ""We had a lot of backing from the team. Even when we flop, we are told to play with positive intent.""We are the World Cup champions (T20), we should display our brand of cricket. There was no pressure. Even if we lose a wicket early, we're told not to worry. We followed the basics and played with positive intent,"" he said after India took a 2-1 lead in the fourmatch series.Back home, his coach Salam Bayash, who used to give him a 41-km scooter ride daily before Tilak's family moved closer to the academy, was naturally over the moon seeing Tilak score a hundred.""I have never seen Tilak so happy. He called me around 2.30 am (IST) after the match and expressed his joy over his first century. He is a very quiet lad. It was so heartening to see,"" Bayash told TOI on Thursday.The coach also backed his ward to do well in the red-ball cricket. ""He spends more time training with red ball than white. I am sure he will do well in Tests. He is definitely a three-format player. He has been working hard on his bowling too.""When he was out of the game for two months with injury to his left hand, he was nervous and tense. But he trained hard on his bowling and his fitness,"" Bayash added.","'We're T20 champions, we should display our brand of cricket,' says batter after scoring his maiden international ton.

New Zealand 's bowling great Tim Southee has announced his retirement plans and will bow out from the red-ball format after his team's ongoing World Test Championship (2023-25) campaign.Southee is New Zealand's all-time leading wicket-taker and the coming series against England at home could mark his final appearance, but should the Kiwis qualify for the WTC final, he might play in the summit clash at Lord's in June next year.The 35-year-old pacer's white-ball plans are still not sure, and he is yet to take a call on playing the limited-overs internationals against Sri Lanka after Christmas.""Representing New Zealand was all I ever dreamed of growing up,"" Southee was quoted as saying by the International Cricket Council website. ""To play for the Black Caps for 18 years has been the greatest honour and privilege, but the time feels right to now step away from the game that has given so much to me."" Test cricket holds a special place in my heart, so to be able to play such a big series against the same opponent my Test career began against all those years ago, and on three grounds that are incredibly special to me, seems the perfect way to end my time in the black cap.""I'll always be so grateful to my family, friends, coaches, our fans and everyone involved in the game who has supported me and my career over the years.

NEW DELHI: Ahead of the highly-anticipated Indian Premier league mega auction, the Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ) has said that there will be two sets of marquee players at the two-day event, Cricbuzz reported.The auction is scheduled for November 24 and 25 at the Benchmark Arena in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.Franchises are preparing for the auction and have learned from the BCCI that two marquee lists will be used, each featuring 8-9 players.While using two Elite lists isn't unprecedented in mega-auctions, the previous major auction in 2022 only employed one.Notably, the 2018 and 2014 auctions did utilize two sets.Players expected to be included in the Elite grade are Rishabh Pant, KL Rahul, Shreyas Iyer, Mohammed Siraj, Mohammed Shami, Arshdeep Singh, R Ashwin, Mitchell Starc, and Jos Buttler, among others.Star England all-rounder Ben Stokes, who would have been in the marquee list, had earlier opted out of this year's auction.With each marquee player setting a base price of INR 2 crore, the first two sets of players could exhaust 30 to 50 percent of the total auction purse.Franchises are expected to secure at least two prominent players each, potentially costing between INR 20-25 crore on average.This could amount to INR 200-250 crore from the total purse of Rs 641.5 crore.It's important to note that franchises have already allocated Rs 558.5 crore of their permitted INR 1200 crore during recent retentions.The auction's trajectory over the two days will likely hinge on the bids placed for players in the first two sets, many of whom are expected to be sold.Punjab Kings, holding the largest available purse at INR 110.5 crore, are well-positioned to acquire top players.The BCCI will soon announce the precise bidding order and the marquee list.They recently distributed a register of 1,574 names, including 1,165 Indian players and 409 overseas players.This roster comprises 320 capped, 1224 uncapped, and 30 Associate players.Additionally, franchises have retained a total of 46 players.","IPL mega auction scheduled for November 24 and 25 in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.

NEW DELHI: Former Australia captain Ricky Ponting took a fresh dig at India head coach Gautam Gambhir after clarifying his remarks about Virat Kohli 's performance.Speaking on the podcast 'The Run Home with Joel & Fletch,' Ponting again labeled Gambhir as a 'prickly character'. He suggested that Gambhir's reaction, during the press conference before leaving for Border-Gavaskar Trophy (BGT), was influenced by India's recent Test series loss to New Zealand.""I'm not sure if I mentioned a couple of them [other Indian batters], but I reckon he's just throwing me in the deep end, trying to find their two most experienced and make sure when they come out, they put that back on me,"" Ponting said.In the lead-up to the BGT, Ponting had raised concerns about Kohli's form. He highlighted Kohli's declining home average, which has dropped to almost 30, with only three centuries in the past five years. However, Ponting also acknowledged Kohli's excellent track record in Australia, suggesting that this tour could be an opportunity for him to regain his form.Ponting believes Gambhir misinterpreted his comments and reacted emotionally, possibly due to the recent series defeat.""I think the hair on the back of his neck was already standing up. We got a bit of history as well, but he took a chance to fire back at me,"" Ponting said, adding that Gambhir seemed anxious and was looking for a reason to retaliate.Despite their differences, Ponting stood by his initial assessment of Kohli's recent form, attributing his concerns to the statistical decline in Kohli's performance. Ponting, however, expressed confidence that the Australian tour could be a turning point for Kohli.""I said if there ever was a tour where he [Kohli] could turn things around, it would be this,"" Ponting noted.","Former Australia captain Ricky Ponting takes a fresh dig at India head coach Gautam Gambhir after clarifying his remarks about Virat Kohli's performance.

NEW DELHI: Marco Jansen 's blistering fifty, the fastest ever against India in T20Is, almost turned the tide in South Africa's favor, but India held on to clinch a nerve-wracking 11-run victory in the third T20I in Centurion.Jansen's late assault, which saw him reach fifty off just 16 balls, gave India a serious scare in the final moments of the match, but Arshdeep Singh 's calm death bowling secured the win, giving India an unbeatable 2-1 lead in the four-match series.Chasing India's imposing total of 219/6, South Africa appeared to be out of the contest at 169/6 after 18 overs. But Jansen had other plans. Walking in at No. 7, the tall all-rounder unleashed a furious attack on India's bowlers, hammering Hardik Pandya for 26 runs in the penultimate over, which included two sixes and three fours. His blitzkrieg brought South Africa within touching distance, needing 25 runs off the final over to pull off a miraculous win.Jansen's onslaught continued into the last over, where he smashed a six off Arshdeep Singh's second ball to reach his record-breaking fifty in just 16 deliveries, the fastest by any batter against India in T20I history. However, Arshdeep responded immediately, dismissing Jansen on the very next delivery to extinguish South Africa's hopes of a dramatic win. Despite Jansen's heroics, South Africa managed only 208/7, falling short by 11 runs.The explosive knock by Jansen, who finished with 54 off just 17 balls, almost overshadowed Tilak Varma's earlier century for India. Varma's unbeaten 107 off 56 balls, supported by Abhishek Sharma 's quickfire 50, had powered India to a commanding total. However, Jansen's extraordinary hitting in the final overs nearly turned the match on its head, forcing India to dig deep for the win.Arshdeep, who finished with figures of 3/37, held his nerve in the last over, conceding only 13 runs and delivering the crucial breakthrough that ended Jansen's charge. Despite the scare, India walked away with the victory and a series lead.","Jansen's blistering fifty, the fastest ever against India in T20Is, almost turned the tide in South Africa's favor.

But you know he's a little, you know, things that you know, used to come in and do this and bowl. And can you imagine he got one ball to turn, and I played that down the wrong line, top edge and I was out.""In 20 Test matches against India, Border took 4 wickets and one of them was Gavaskar.Gavaskar continues, ""So you know, I am reminded of it every time I bump into him. He comes and says 'Hello Bunny, how are you?'

Champions Trophy - Future of India-Pakistan Cricket is in danger - Ahmed Shehzad & Sikander Bakht

🔴LIVE: IND v SA 3rd T20I Live: All eyes on Abhishek Sharma as visitors eye series lead in Centurion

NEW DELHI: The ongoing tension over the Champions Trophy remains one of the long-standing complexities in India-Pakistan cricket relations.Recently, Pakistan cricketer Ahmad Shahzad openly criticized India's stance on the upcoming tournament, voicing frustration over what he sees as India's 'false promises.'He pointed out that while Pakistan gives credit to India when they perform well on the field, their hesitance to play in Pakistan appears to be driven by more than just cricket concerns.""Pakistan now needs to step forward and clarify its stance. We've known for a long time that India are making false promises. Whenever they play well, we praise them because they deserve it. But when it comes to this issue (coming to Pakistan), India have been lying for a long time. Even before, whenever Pakistan would try to do something like this (hosting a mega event), India would try to financially damage it,"" said Ahmad Shahzad on the Pakistani channel Geo News.""And this time, they've crossed the line. Pakistan need to take a strong stance. If India don't want to come, let them stay away—enough is enough!"" added a frustrated Shahzad.In response to India's refusal to play in Pakistan for the 2025 Champions Trophy, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) is reportedly preparing to challenge this decision by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI).According to the Dawn newspaper, the PCB plans to question the International Cricket Council (ICC) to understand the rationale behind BCCI's stance.While a hybrid model, allowing India to play in a neutral venue, was proposed, PCB chairman Mohsin Naqvi has reportedly opposed this arrangement.The ICC now faces the difficult task of finding a solution, with options including moving the tournament out of Pakistan entirely, potentially to South Africa or the UAE.Some reports, however, have also suggested that Pakistan might consider withdrawing from the Champions Trophy if hosting rights are removed—a decision that would mark a significant escalation in the dispute.","Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) is reportedly preparing to challenge this decision by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) The ICC now faces the difficult task of finding a solution, with options including moving the tournament out of Pakistan entirely, potentially to South Africa or the UAE.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115275763,imgsize-50158,width-400,resizemode-4/115275763.jpg"

BRIEF SCORES

Gujarat (Overnight 281 for 6 in 86 overs): 343 all out in 105.3 overs (Vishal Jayswal 112, Priyank Panchal 88, Chintan Gaja 86; Aditya Thakare 3-63, Nachiket Bhute 3-66, Praful Hinge 3-74, Harsh Dubey 1-69) lead Vidarbha: 202 for 2 in 65 overs (Karun Nair 81 batting, Danish Malewar 76 batting, Dhruv Shorey 27; Tejas Patel 1-33, Arzan Nagaswalla 1-38) by 141 runs.

NAGPUR: At 50 for 2, Vidarbha were in trouble. Gujarat ’s first innings total of 343 was still far away. The openers, after a solid start, had slipped. Two in the Vidarbha lineup, Karun Nair and Danish Malewar , though, knew they had miles to go, and a promise to keep.The unbeaten 152-run partnership, the highest of the match so far, by Nair and Malewar firm brought Vidarbha back in the hunt. The hosts finished Day 2 of the Elite Group ‘B’ Ranji Trophy match on 202 for 2 in 65 overs at Jamtha Stadium in Nagpur.With Vidarbha still 141 adrift of Gujarat, the two and the rest of the batting line-up need to put in a solid performance for the team to get into the driver’s seat.Nair (81*; 137b;11x4;2x6) hardly put a foot wrong on Thursday. Malewar (76*;11x4;1x6), the promising 21-year-old batter, complimented the senior professional shot for shot. Malewar erred just once in his 152-ball stay at the crease and was saved by the third umpire.Prior to the Nair-Malewar show, Gujarat skipper Chintan Gaja finished unbeaten on 86 (178b;12x4;1x6). Gujarat’s last four wickets added 62 to the board, with Gaja scoring 43 of those runs. Gaja reached his fifty with an on-the-up punch to the cover boundary in the third over of the day.The next over, 90th of the Gujarat inning, saw medium pacer Thakare playing with the patience of Vishal Jayswal (112;139b;12x4;4x6) by bowling five consecutive dots. On the sixth, Jayswal lost his cool and tried to heave the ball out of the park. His mistimed shot was gleefully pouched by Akshay Wakhare at short mid-off as Gujarat lost the first wicket of the day with scoreboard reading 293 for 7.With Vidarbha on 134 for 2 in the 43rd over, Malewar, batting on 40, tried to cut a delivery from Vishal Jayswal only to edge it to the wicketkeeper. As Malewar trudged back to the dressing room, he was stopped by the umpires thanks to a No ball alert. Replays showed Jayswal had overstepped. From thereon, Malewar finished the day unbeaten, posting his highest First Class score.Nachiket Bhute did a Herschelle Gibbs on Thursday, letting the ball slip out of his hand while trying to celebrate a dismissal. Gujarat skipper Chintan Gaja, batting on 71, offered a simple caught and bowled chance to Bhute. The right-arm medium pacer caught the ball in one hand in his follow-through. But too eager to celebrate, Bhute saw the ball slip out of his hand before he could legally complete the catch. The slip-up, though, didn’t prove costly for Vidarbha as the Gujarat innings folded after the addition of just 16 runs post the incident.",Gujarat lead Vidarbha by 141 runs after Day 2 of Elite Group ‘B’ Ranji Trophy match. Karun Nair (81) and Danish Malewar (76) posted unbeaten 152-run partnership.

There will be a heavy police presence but few visiting fans when France hosts Israel in UEFA Nations League match on Thursday amid an increasingly tense political climate.French police chief Laurent Nunez said 4,000 police officers and security staff will be deployed around the Stade de France , with another 1,500 police on public transport.Paris authorities are on high alert and pursuing extreme measures one week after violence against Israeli fans around a Europa League football game in Amsterdam in attacks widely condemned across Europe as antisemitic.Nunez said the event was at ""high risk"" of tensions. ""What we learned from Amsterdam is that we need to be present in the public space including far away from the stadium,"" and in public transports before and after the match, he said Thursday on French news broadcaster France Info.Three months after hosting the Olympic closing ceremony, the atmosphere has gone from festive to fearful and the national stadium was expected to be three-quarters empty for the match. French President Emmanuel Macron and French Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau will be present. Former presidents Francois Hollande and Nicolas Sarkozy are also to attend.Only 20,000 of 80,000 tickets have been sold with around 150 Israel supporters reportedly attending, escorted by police.""We've tried to prepare for this match as normally as possible.

""But we have to adapt.""The low number of visiting fans comes after Israel's National Security Council warned citizens abroad to avoid sports and cultural events, specifically the match in Paris.Retailleau told French news channel TF1 on Tuesday that no specific threats were identified but ""zero risk does not exist.""Therefore, he said, exceptional measures are in place ""before the match, during the match and after the match.""The elite tactical unit of the French National Police, known as RAID, will be in the stadium and some police will be in plain clothes mingling with fans. There will also be heavy surveillance within Paris, including at Jewish places of worship and schools.""It is out of the question that we take the risk of seeing a repeat of the dramatic events, of the manhunt, that we saw in Amsterdam,"" Retailleau said, adding that postponing or moving the game elsewhere was ruled out.""France does not retreat,"" he said. ""France does not submit, and the France-Israel match will take place where it's supposed to.""Amsterdam witnessed scenes of chaos when Israeli fans were attacked by hordes of young people apparently riled up by calls on social media to target Jewish people, according to Dutch authorities.

Argentina looks to Messi

Vinicius under pressure

Unfinished business

Argentina and Brazil will have two of their leading stars available again as South American qualifying for the 2026 World Cup resumes with the last two rounds of games this year. Defending World Cup champion Argentina will once again count on goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez , who was suspended for two international matches in October. Brazil will bring back winger Vinicius Júnior , who missed the last two qualifiers through injury but has recovered.South American leaders Argentina will play at Paraguay on Thursday, shortly after fourth-place Brazil visits Venezuela.Also on Thursday, host Ecuador and Bolivia will face off in Guayaquil.Potentially the most interesting match of the 11th round will be played on Friday in Montevideo, where third-place Uruguay hosts second-place Colombia. The bottom two in the 10-team standings, Peru and Chile, will meet the same day.All teams play again next Tuesday in the 12th round of games, when Argentina hosts Peru and Brazil has a home game against Uruguay.Argentina currently has 22 points, three more than Colombia, with Uruguay and Brazil third and fourth with 16 points each. Ecuador and Paraguay, with 13 points, complete the top six which are direct spots in the next World Cup.Bolivia has 12 points, and its seventh place would qualify the Andean team for an international playoff. Venezuela (11), Peru (6) and Chile (5) complete the standings.Argentina can move even closer to a spot at the World Cup by beating Paraguay and Peru.Captain Lionel Messi will be his team's best hope for goals once again after his hat trick and two assists in the 6-0 win against Bolivia in October, with the 37-year-old the top scorer in the current South American qualifying.Argentina will travel to Asuncion with an additional challenge since Paraguay has been unbeaten since coach Gustavo Alfaro, an Argentine, took over in the middle of the year. In September, the Paraguayans beat Brazil 1-0.Coach Lionel Scaloni faced a last-minute injury that could force even more changes in Argentina's defense. Lisandro Martinez suffered an apparent abdomen injury during Manchester United's 3-0 Premier League victory over Leicester and was discharged from international duty. Scaloni had already lost Germán Pezzella.Pressure on Brazil coach Dorival Júnior was eased in October after two wins in qualifying over Chile and Peru. And Vinicius wasn't on duty in either of them.Fans will pay close attention to the winger's performances against tough defenses at Venezuela and later against Uruguay, as he tries to reproduce for Brazil the same decisive performances for Real Madrid.Brazil once again will not have Neymar, who picked up a muscular injury earlier this month. There's no big name as a center forward because Rodrygo is injured, too, and Endrick was not chosen. Vinicius will likely have to link up effectively with Raphinha and Luiz Henrique.Vinicius will face two teams that are in a degree of turmoil. Venezuela hasn't won any of its last six qualifiers, and Uruguay coach Marcelo Bielsa is still under fire from former players for his handling of the team.Two wins for Brazil won't secure the team a spot at the next World Cup just yet, but they will give fans and players some reassurance after a turbulent year.Colombia is hardly expecting a friendly reception in Montevideo on Friday. After all, there's unfinished business with Uruguay since their turbulent semifinal encounter at the Copa América in the United States in July.Colombia's victory kicked off a brawl between Colombian fans and relatives of the Uruguay players. Led by striker Darwin Núñez, the Uruguayans went into the stands to defend their relatives. Núnez was later suspended for five matches.Uruguay's Bielsa will be without two key midfielders, Nicolás de la Cruz and Giorgian de Arrascaeta, both injured. Uruguay has not won since its third-place match at the Copa America.","Argentina and Brazil will have two of their leading stars available again as South American qualifying resumes.

TURIN: Frances Tiafoe , who reached the semifinals of the US Open, received a substantial fine for his behavior during a match at the Shanghai Masters last month. While he will not be suspended from playing, the consequences of his actions are significant.The ATP , the governing body of men's professional tennis , announced that Tiafoe was fined a total of $120,000 for his outburst.The hefty penalty comprises two parts: the maximum on-site fine of $60,000 for verbal abuse and an additional $60,000 for aggravated behavior.Despite the severity of the fine, the ATP confirmed that Tiafoe would not face suspension and would be eligible to participate in upcoming tournaments.The incident occurred during Tiafoe's third-round match against Roman Safiullin, ranked 61st at the time. After a hard-fought battle, Tiafoe lost the match with a final score of 5-7, 7-5, 7-6 (5).Following the match, Tiafoe engaged in a profanity-laced tirade directed at chair umpire Jimmy Pinoargote, lasting approximately one minute. It was reported that Tiafoe used around ten expletives during this outburst.In the aftermath of the incident, Tiafoe took to social media to express remorse for his actions. He acknowledged that his behavior was unacceptable and apologized for his outburst.“That is not who I am and not how I ever want to treat people. I let my frustration in the heat of the moment get the best of me and I’m extremely disappointed with how I handled the situation.”The primary source of Tiafoe's frustration stemmed from a penalty he received for a time violation during the crucial closing tiebreaker.With the score tied at 5-5, Tiafoe was preparing to serve when the serve clock was about to expire. He tossed the ball in the air at the baseline, but umpire Pinoargote deemed this action insufficient to constitute a genuine attempt to serve.As a result, Tiafoe was penalized with a fault, costing him his first serve. While he initially protested the decision, he continued playing but ultimately lost the point and the subsequent point, leading to his defeat.Despite the heated exchange, Tiafoe displayed sportsmanship by congratulating Safiullin at the net after the match concluded. However, he then turned towards the umpire and began shouting expletives.Tiafoe then moved to the other side of the net, positioning himself closer to his chair, and voiced his discontent, asserting that the umpire's decision had negatively impacted the match's outcome.Tiafoe's impressive run to the US Open semifinals in 2022, where he faced eventual champion Carlos Alcaraz, solidified his status as a rising star in tennis. He replicated this feat in the 2023 tournament, reaching the semifinals before being defeated by fellow American Taylor Fritz in a hard-fought five-set match.","Frances Tiafoe received a substantial fine for his behavior during a match at the Shanghai Masters last month. The ATP confirmed that TiaFoe would not face suspension and would be eligible to participate in upcoming tournaments. The incident occurred during the third-round match against Roman Safiullin, ranked 61st at the time.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115320470,imgsize-46364,width-400,resizemode-4/115320470.jpg"

TURIN (Italy): He's got a stranglehold on the No. 1 ranking. He's unbeaten this week and hasn't dropped a set. And his home Italian fans can't get enough of him.Things couldn't get much better for Jannik Sinner at the ATP Finals so far — despite an ongoing doping case that likely won't be decided until early next year.Sinner and US Open finalist Taylor Fritz advanced to the semifinals on Thursday at the season-ending tournament for the year's top eight players.Sinner won the round-robin group after a 6-3, 6-4 victory over 2020 champion Daniil Medvedev; and Fritz advanced in second after rallying past Alex de Minaur 5-7, 6-4, 6-3.Sinner was already assured of a spot in the last four before his match against Medvedev but still extended his winning streak to nine matches. Sinner beat Fritz in the U.S. Open final in September for his second Grand Slam title.“I hope this match gives me confidence for the semifinals, where I'm hoping to raise the level,"" Sinner said. ""But honestly, I'm happy with the level I'm playing at right now.”Sinner is playing at home for the first time since it was announced before his U.S. Open title that he tested positive in two separate drug tests this year.A decision to clear Sinner of wrongdoing was appealed by the World Anti-Doping Agency in September and a final ruling in the case is expected in 2025.Medvedev, who won one of three matches, and De Minaur, who didn't win any, were eliminated.Last year, Sinner lost the final to Novak Djokovic , who pulled out injured this year.Alexander Zverev leads the other group ahead of Casper Ruud, Carlos Alcaraz and Andrey Rublev.Sinner took the edge in his career meetings with Medvedev at 8-7 — after Medvedev swept their first six matches.“He's in full confidence right now,” Medvedev said. “I watched his practice before the match — barely misses a shot and he hits strong. Many times a lot of players that don't miss a lot, at least they don't hit strong. He can hit strong — very strong, probably one of maybe top three, four, five hitters on tour, and doesn't miss.”Fritz improved to 4-5 in his career against De Minaur and could pull level next week in a quarterfinal matchup between the United States and Australia at the Davis Cup Finals.“I feel like he typically plays better in the team environment. I also feel like I play better in the team environment,"" Fritz said. ""It's still going to be a nightmare to play him next week, too.”","Jannik Sinner and Taylor Fritz advanced to the semifinals of the ATP World Tour Finals. Sinner won the round-robin group after a 6-3, 6-4 victory over 2020 champion Daniil Medvedev. Fritz advanced in second after rallying past Alex de Minaur 5-7,6-4, 6 -3.

(AP)

Taylor Fritz moved closer to the semis of the season-ending ATP Finals after the American beat Alex de Minaur 5-7 6-4 6-3 in their last group game on Thursday, but he will have to wait and see if Jannik Sinner can take a set off Daniil Medvedev .The match also marked the first time a deciding set was played at this year's tournament as Fritz bounced back from a set down with a dominant display in the second before running away with the third set.US Open runner-up Fritz can qualify for the final four if Sinner takes a set in his match against Medvedev. But the American will be eliminated if Medvedev beats Sinner in straight sets.Seventh seed De Minaur, meanwhile, goes home without winning a single match in the Ilie Nastase group on his tournament debut.""He was all over me (in the first set). What I did a great job of was in the second set, towards the end of the second set, I really started to find my serve,"" Fritz said.""I started serving much better and then that allowed me to just stay with it and create more pressure on his service games... It just gave me a little bit of comfort to just stay in the match and not be under so much pressure all the time.""The two played some entertaining tennis in the opening set, including a 30-shot rally which De Minaur won with a passing shot while Fritz walked back to the baseline with a wry smile.De Minaur converted the all-important break at 5-5 and served for the set, sealing it with an ace, which also confirmed world number one Sinner as the first semi-finalist.De Minaur, however, needed to win the second set comfortably to stand a chance of advancing to the semi-finals and the Australian saw his slim hopes of going through evaporate when Fritz levelled the score at one set apiece.That was all the motivation a fired-up Fritz needed as he raced into a 4-1 lead to gain control of the decider while De Minaur crumbled. At 5-3, Fritz had three match points and took the contest with an ace.""I think all of us are pretty beat up, but if I'm in the semis of the World Tour finals, I've got energy to give it for the semis,"" Fritz added.",Taylor Fritz beats Alex de Minaur 5-7 6-4 6-3 at ATP World Tour Finals.

(AP)

There ""could have been better communication"" in explaining the rules involved in Jannik Sinner 's doping case, ATP Tour chairman Andrea Gaudenzi acknowledged Thursday.However, Gaudenzi said at the ATP Finals that anyone hinting that a ""double standard"" was applied because of top-ranked Sinner's status is ""unfair because the rules have been the same.""Sinner is playing at home this week for the first time since it was announced before his U.S. Open title that he tested positive for an anabolic steroid in two separate drug tests in March.The case wasn't made public until August.""I learned the day before we all learned,"" Gaudenzi said in his first public comments on the case. He spoke in a round-table discussion with international reporters.""And to be honest, I'm happy about that. I really thank the ITA (International Testing Agency) and our representatives there for intentionally keeping me and our entire team in the dark because that's how it should be.""It should be completely independent and that was agreed by the (parties). It was a shock, but obviously comforted by the evidence afterward.""A decision by an independent tribunal to clear Sinner of wrongdoing was appealed by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) in September and the Switzerland-based Court of Arbitration for Sport is expected to make a final ruling on the case early next year.Sinner's explanation was that the banned performance-enhancer entered his system unintentionally through a massage from his physiotherapist, who used a spray containing the steroid to treat his own cut finger.WADA is seeking a ban of one to two years for Sinner.""We are completely external and it's (an) independent process,"" Gaudenzi said. ""I generally think has been a fair process. It was really done by the book and by the rules. Maybe there could have been better communication in explaining those rules, and that is something that I would urge every party involved to work better in the next time.""ATP Finals future will be revealed Gaudenzi said he plans to announce on Sunday the future host of the ATP Finals. The contract with Turin expires next year and there is an option to move the event to nearby Milan at a bigger arena being built for the 2026 Milan-Cortina Olympics.""We are all super happy with what's happened here in Turin and of course we've been a bit lucky with the players in Italy,"" Gaudenzi said. ""It's not only Jannik but also Matteo Berrettini played the first edition. Nobody could foresee that.""We knew we were going to a tennis country,"" said Gaudenzi, who is Italian and a former pro player. ""(Finals) should definitely go in a market that loves tennis. ... It's obviously going to get better if you have a local hero, no doubt.""Gaudenzi does not want to move the finals too far away geographically from the previous stop on the circuit, the Paris Masters.""We want to try to avoid the players to fly around the world,"" he said, ""because they do enough traveling all over throughout the year.""","Top-ranked Jannik Sinner is playing at home this week for the first time since he tested positive for an anabolic steroid in March.

Ruud misses chance

TURIN: Carlos Alcaraz opened his account at the ATP Finals on Wednesday with an entertaining 6-3, 7-6 (10/8) win over Andrey Rublev , while Casper Ruud missed an early chance to reach the semi-finals after losing in straight sets to Alexander Zverev .World number three Alcaraz comfortably defeated Rublev to lift himself off the bottom of the John Newcombe Group and looked in much better form despite struggling with fatigue and illness in the lead-up to the match.There had been some doubt as to whether Alcaraz, who lost his opening match in straight sets to Ruud, would continue in Turin after quickly ending his training session on Tuesday, with his coach Juan Carlos Ferrero saying that he had trouble breathing.""I could be better, I'm not going to lie,"" said Alcaraz on court after beating Rublev.""I've been struggling with my health the last week and today I thought I was going to feel better. I was OK to play, but thinking about the first match I was thinking a lot about that I was sick, that I couldn't play.""Today I really wanted to step on the court and just think about tennis , try to play a high level... When I played the first match I felt like I did not entertain the people, I did not play good tennis.""Alcaraz, who has won the Wimbledon and French Open titles this season, cruised to the first set in 38 minutes, breaking Rublev in game seven and quickly winning the next two to go one set ahead.And although the Spaniard had a harder time of it in the second set, he delighted the spectators with a series of spectacular shots which suggested he might be approaching his best form.Rublev meanwhile drops to last place after losing his sixth straight Finals match, although he put up a battle and had two opportunities to win the second set.Alcaraz winning in straight sets meant that Ruud would have reached the semi-finals with a match to spare if he had beaten two-time Finals champion Alexander Zverev in the day's late match.However, Zverev put on a punishing display to prevail in straight sets 7-6 (7/3), 6-3 and all-but ensure a spot in the last four with his second win from as many matches.Zverev took charge of the match in the tie-break at the end of a first set, which before then had gone entirely with serve, and the pair exchanged blows until the German broke in game eight of the second set and then served to love to win the match.""I think it was a very good match actually from both of us,"" said Zverev on court.""I'm happy to win today but it was very, very close. One or two points decided the first set and I thought the level was very high from both of us.""Leader Zverev can eliminate Alcaraz in his final match of the group stage on Friday, when Ruud takes on Rublev.On Thursday, world number one Jannik Sinner will reach the last four if he claims a single set against Daniil Medvedev , and will top the Ilie Nastase Group with a third straight win.","Carlos Alcaraz beats Andrey Rublev 6-3, 7-6 (10/8) at ATP Finals.

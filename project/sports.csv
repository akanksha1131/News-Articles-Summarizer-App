Poll What do you think was the key to Mitchell Starc's success in the final over? Team support and dynamics Rajasthan's batting strategy A bit of luck Execution of his bowling plan

NEW DELHI: Mitchell Starc ’s nerves of steel in the final over helped Delhi Capitals drag their IPL 2025 clash against Rajasthan Royals into the season’s first Super Over at the Arun Jaitley Stadium on Wednesday.Defending just nine runs in the 20th over, Starc delivered a masterclass in death bowling, conceding only eight and forcing a tie. The game eventually swung in Delhi’s favor in the Super Over, where they chased down a 12-run target with ease.Reflecting on his performance, Starc credited his execution and a touch of fortune.“(On the final over) Just backed my execution, running in with a clear plan. Sometimes it comes off; a bit of luck goes a long way. It was a fantastic game, happy to get on the right side. I've played long enough for everyone to know what I'd do, but if I execute, then I know I'll get by. A bit of luck goes a long way,” said Starc at the post-match presentation.Starc also admitted he was caught slightly off guard by Rajasthan’s Super Over strategy.“(On RR's choice of batters for the Super Over) It was a bit of a surprise to see left-handers come in with my angle as the ball was tailing back in. Got one wrong there with the side line no-ball, but we had the batting depth then to chase that down,” he added.Rajasthan posted 11 runs in their Super Over, with Delhi replying confidently. KL Rahul and Tristan Stubbs took charge for DC, facing Sandeep Sharma, and wrapped up the chase in just four balls.Starc, who ended with figures of 1/36, was named Player of the Match for his crucial role at the death and in the Super Over. He also lauded the team environment and the balanced squad dynamics.“(On team atmosphere) Good mix of youth and experience here. Axar is leading us well. Kuldeep has been fantastic. Stubbs and KL are very experienced as well. We are having a lot of fun, success helps that as well,” he said.With a blend of experience and composure under pressure, Starc once again proved why he remains one of the most lethal fast bowlers in the T20 format.",Mitchell Starc named Player of the Match in IPL 2025 clash with Rajasthan Royals.

Poll Should players be penalized for using non-compliant bats? Only for repeat offenders No, it's not a big deal Yes, strict penalties should be enforced

WHY ARE UMPIRES CHECKING BATS?

WHAT ARE THE RULES ON BAT SIZES?

NEW DELHI: Rajasthan Royals’ Riyan Parag was at the center of a rare interruption during the IPL 2025 match against Delhi Capitals at the Arun Jaitley Stadium, as he was forced to change his bat moments before taking strike.Coming in to bat in place of the injured Sanju Samson, Parag was halted by the on-field umpire for a routine bat gauge check. The bat failed to meet the required specifications, leading to a brief but animated exchange between the batter and the official. Despite his protest, Parag had no option but to change his bat before resuming play.A video capturing the incident has gone viral on social media, showing the exact moment the bat was tested and Parag’s visible displeasure upon learning it didn’t pass.However, the change in equipment didn’t bring a change in fortune. Parag managed just 8 runs from 11 balls before being dismissed.This incident adds to a growing list of players flagged for bat regulation breaches this season. Earlier, KKR's Sunil Narine and Anrich Nortje were also made to replace their bats after similar checks by match officials.According to IPL 2025 regulations, bats must adhere to strict dimensions: a maximum width of 10.79 cm, blade thickness of up to 6.7 cm, edge thickness not exceeding 4 cm, and a total length capped at 96.4 cm.With enforcement tightening, players and franchises are being reminded that compliance with equipment standards is non-negotiable this season.The umpires are checking the bats as part of BCCI protocol which aims to prevent players from gaining unfair advantages in an era of aggressive powerhitting.The BCCI has authorised IPL match officials to inspect any bat they consider necessary during live games, marking a significant change from previous seasons where such checks were confined to dressing rooms.The ICC regulations stipulate specific bat dimensions. The bat face width must not exceed 4.25 inches (10.79 cm), while the middle of the bat thickness is limited to 2.64 inches (6.7 cm). The edge width cannot be more than 1.56 inches (4 cm), and the bat's total height from handle to base must not exceed 38 inches (96.4 cm).","Rajasthan Royals’ Riyan Parag forced to change his bat moments before taking strike.

Poll How crucial was Mitchell Starc's final over in securing the win for Delhi Capitals? Not at all crucial Not very crucial Somewhat crucial Extremely crucial

NEW DELHI: Delhi Capitals skipper Axar Patel hailed Mitchell Starc ’s clinical execution in the final over as the key factor in their nail-biting Super Over win against Rajasthan Royals at the Arun Jaitley Stadium on Wednesday. In a match that went down to the wire, the Royals required just nine runs from the last over, but Starc held his nerve, giving away only eight to force the first Super Over of IPL 2025 .“I knew if Starc hit his mark, we’d be back in the contest. He delivered 12 balls straight—every single one aimed as a yorker. He’s an Australian legend, and his mindset was spot on. He only missed the mark once,” said Axar, praising the left-arm pacer.Delhi, who batted first in regulation time, chased down a 12-run target in the Super Over with remarkable ease. KL Rahul and Tristan Stubbs sealed the win in just four deliveries, with Sandeep Sharma handling the pressure over for Rajasthan.Reflecting on the team's batting, Axar admitted that Delhi fell short of expectations during the powerplay.“We should have scored more early on. KL Rahul mentioned the pitch wasn’t easy to bat on. I reminded the boys to stay positive and show intent. Sometimes, pressure makes you panic. When RR were dominating, I felt the heat. I took a strategic timeout and asked my bowlers to stick to proper line and length,” he shared.Assessing Delhi’s overall performance, Axar said the team gained momentum after a sluggish start. “All’s well that ends well. The way we began, especially in the powerplay, we could’ve done better.""During the first strategic break, our batters told us the wicket was tricky for new batters. I told them to maintain intent. Fortunately, we picked up steam around the 12th or 13th over.”","Delhi Capitals skipper Axar Patel hails Mitchell Starc's clinical execution in the final over as the key factor in their nail-biting Super Over win against Rajasthan Royals.

KL RAHUL MANIA

AXAR'S FIRST WICKET OF IPL 2025

NEW DELHI: In trouble? Call Mitchell Starc . That’s exactly what Axar Patel did when things got tense. With just 9 runs to defend in the final over, he turned to his strike bowler — and Starc delivered.Yorker after yorker, Starc kept the pressure high and the fans on edge. Dhruv Jurel and Shimron Hetmyer managed to survive the heat but couldn’t find the boundaries needed. The match ended in a thrilling tie, pushing the contest into the first Super Over of IPL 2025 .Starc returned for the Super Over, taking the ball once again with ice in his veins. Rajasthan Royals managed just 11 runs, setting Delhi Capitals a target of 12.Enter KL Rahul and Tristan Stubbs , with Sandeep Sharma bowling.Rahul started with a couple, followed it up with a crisp boundary, and handed over the strike after a single. Stubbs needed no second invitation — he launched Sandeep into the stands, sealing a dramatic win for Delhi Capitals.It was their first win at home this season, and it took them right back to the top of the table. As the players celebrated, the ‘Dilli re, Roar Macha!’ anthem echoed through the Kotla — a perfect end to a pulsating night of cricket.Tension was palpable in the Rajasthan Royals dugout. Sanju Samson wore a frustrated look behind the stumps as Sandeep Sharma — one of their most trusted bowlers at the death — lost his rhythm when it mattered the most. Tasked with bowling the final over, Sandeep’s six legal deliveries stretched into a chaotic 11-ball over: Wd 0 Wd Wd Wd N1 4 6 1 1 1 — a rare meltdown from the usually reliable pacer.Delhi Capitals finished their innings at 188/5, and the mood in their camp was upbeat. Smiles lit up their dugout, with players clearly satisfied with what looked like a competitive total.Opener Abishek Porel, who set the tone early with the bat, sounded confident in the mid-innings chat with the broadcasters.""The plan was to go hard in the powerplay which would make it easier later on. If you bowl slower, it is helpful on this wicket and hopefully our bowlers do well. A very good total on this wicket,"" he said.But Rajasthan Royals had other ideas.They came out all guns blazing, dismantling Delhi’s bowling attack from the outset. Yashasvi Jaiswal set the tone with a brisk 51, while Sanju Samson, before retiring hurt on 31, ensured the momentum stayed firmly in Rajasthan’s corner.And then came Nitish Rana, who played a stunning knock of 51 off 28 balls to give a big home but star pacer Starc pulled things back in Delhi's favour.When the match headed into a Super Over, Sandeep found himself in the spotlight once again — a chance at redemption after a forgettable final over.But pressure mounted, and history repeated itself.Sandeep struggled to hold his nerve, failing to apply any real pressure. Delhi Capitals chased down the target in just four deliveries, sealing a memorable win and leaving Sandeep with another tough outing to reflect on.""Bhaiya, plain t-shirt hai ya kissi player ke naam wali jersey?"" — a curious fan asked a t-shirt vendor stationed outside the Arun Jaitley Stadium, just an hour and a half before the Delhi Capitals vs Rajasthan Royals clash.The seller replied, ""Sirf KL Rahul ki hai."" One fan bought it. Then another. Soon, a line of eager customers formed, each asking for different sizes, as the buzz around KL Rahul gripped the scene outside the stadium.Interestingly, the jersey bore the Delhi Capitals colours, but had ""KL Rahul"" and the number 01 printed on the back — a curious sight, yet a clear sign of the mania surrounding the star batter.Inside the Kotla, it was a vibrant sea of blue and red.The atmosphere reached a crescendo when the stadium DJ dropped the ""Dilli re, Roar Macha!"" anthem — and right on cue, KL Rahul cleared his front leg to send a slot ball from Tushar Deshpande soaring over long-off. The crowd erupted.Rahul's knock was entertaining, albeit not blistering. He scored 38 runs off 32 deliveries before falling to Jofra Archer — notably, the first time Archer managed to dismiss Rahul in IPL history.And he showed his composure in the Super Over too, delivering under pressure and giving fans a treat to watch.""We perhaps got too casual in the middle phase,"" admitted Axar Patel after Delhi Capitals’ unbeaten run was halted by Mumbai Indians in their previous outing.Before the clash against Rajasthan Royals, a quick glance at Axar's IPL 2025 stats painted a worrying picture: 67 runs, 0 wickets in 5 matches — far from the impact expected from the captain and star allrounder.Trolled heavily for throwing his wicket away against Mumbai, Axar walked out to a mix of pressure and expectation. But amidst loud chants of ""Bapu! Bapu!"" echoing around the Kotla, he responded like a true leader — smashing a fiery 34 off just 14 balls, laced with four boundaries and two sixes.The crowd, however, erupted when he made an impact with the ball. Coming in just when his team needed a breakthrough, Axar cleaned up Riyan Parag for 8 — his first wicket of IPL 2025. The dismissal came at a crucial juncture, especially after Sanju Samson had to retire hurt on 31.Axar had finally delivered with both bat and ball — and the Kotla faithful made sure he knew it.","Delhi Capitals beat Rajasthan Royals in the first Super Over of IPL 2025.

Playoff Chances

After playing 7 matches, the Lucknow Super Giants find themselves in a pretty decent position — sitting right in the middle of the points table. With 4 wins from 7 games, LSG currently hold the 5th spot and are very much in the playoff race.One of the biggest positives for Lucknow this season has been Nicholas Pooran, who was retained by the franchise for a whopping amount of Rs 21 crore. He has certainly justified his price tag, smashing 357 runs at an average of 59.50 and a staggering strike rate of 208.77. Pooran has been the backbone of the LSG batting line-up.Another big plus has been Mitchell Marsh, who has given solid support to Pooran. Marsh has scored 295 runs at an average of 49.16 and a strike rate of 171.51. Impressively, he has hit four fifties this season in just six matches — a significant leap considering he had only three IPL fifties before this season.On the bowling front, uncapped player Digvesh Rathi has emerged as a bright spot. He has picked up 9 wickets at an average of 23.11 and an impressive economy of 7.42. Shardul Thakur has also chipped in with 11 wickets at an average of 24.90, though he has been slightly expensive with an economy of 10.96. He currently sits third on the Purple Cap leaderboard.Rishabh Pant, who was LSG’s most expensive signing at Rs 27 crore, has struggled to make an impact this season. He has managed just 103 runs at an average of 17.17 and a strike rate of 104 — numbers that include a scratchy 63 against CSK where he never really looked in rhythm.Apart from Pant, the rest of LSG’s middle order is yet to click. Players like David Miller and Ayush Badoni haven’t had much game time, and when they did, they couldn’t make it count.LSG have a solid shot at making it to the top four if they maintain their current form. Winning 4 out of their remaining 7 matches should be enough to secure a playoff berth. But the bigger question remains — can they go beyond that and actually lift the trophy this time?","Lucknow Super Giants currently sit in the 5th spot in the IPL points table.

Poll Do you think Sanju Samson's injury will significantly impact Rajasthan Royals' performance in IPL 2025? No, they can still perform well. Yes, it will be a major setback.

NEW DELHI: Rajasthan Royals suffered a major blow during their Indian Premier League 2025 clash against Delhi Capitals at the Arun Jaitley Stadium on Wednesday as captain Sanju Samson walked off retired hurt in visible discomfort during the sixth over of their run chase.Samson, who was in terrific touch, had just hit a four and a six off the first two balls of the over bowled by DC spinner Vipraj Nigam. However, on the very next delivery — a no-ball — he attempted a fierce slash and missed. Immediately after the shot, he clutched his side and called for medical attention, indicating pain in his ribs.Despite receiving treatment and taking strike for the free-hit, Samson clearly wasn’t comfortable. He hit the ball towards long-on but didn’t attempt a run. In visible pain, the RR skipper decided to walk off after scoring 31 off 19 deliveries, laced with three sixes and two fours. He had earlier stitched a quick 61-run opening partnership with Yashasvi Jaiswal in just 5.3 overs.Earlier, Delhi Capitals posted a competitive 188/5, powered by impactful knocks from Axar Patel (34 off 14) and Tristan Stubbs (34 off 18).

'I was under pressure': SRH's Abhishek Sharma after a record 141 against Punjab Kings

MUMBAI: This match, irrespective of which team wins, should be a treat for Mumbai’s fans. Abhishek Sharma is back at the Wankhede, the venue where he smashed that fabulous 54-ball 135 against a stunned England at the Wankhede Stadium in early Feb this year.What’s more, he is fresh off an equally murderous 55-ball 141 which helped the Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) chase down Punjab Kings’ 246 with ease in Uppal. Needless to say, hosts Mumbai Indians (MI) have a massive challenge on their hands when they face SRH on Thursday night.Perhaps burdened by the weight of huge expectations since that scintillating century against England, the 24-year-old was groping for runs at the start of the IPL, getting out for scores of 24, 6, 1, 2, and 18. Then he exploded against PBKS to register the highest-ever individual score by an Indian batter in the IPL.MI will look to control the damage from Abhishek and his equally destructive opening partner Travis Head by unleashing their ace seam bowling duo, Jasprit Bumrah and Trent Boult. Both Abhishek and Head like to pounce on the new ball, but attacking Boult, who has a habit of striking in the Powerplays, and Bumrah, won’t be straight forward.Abhishek, Head and South African ’keeper bat Heinrich Klaasen form the engine room of the SRH batting lineup. But MI will also have to deal with an insider. Ishan Kishan , who was an integral part of the franchise since 2018, and was let go by MI, will be having a point to prove. And he knows the Wankhede inside out.Ishan had a stunning debut for SRH, smashing a blazing 106 not out off just 47 balls against Rajasthan Royals, but since then his form has dipped. Conversely, MI have someone in their lineup who was on the SRH rolls once: Karn Sharma Playing his first match of the season, the experienced leggie took 3/36, including the crucial wickets of the in-form KL Rahul and Tristian Stubbs, to help Mumbai pull off a heist against DC in the last match. If Karn and Kiwi left-arm spinner Mitchell Santner, whose brilliant delivery castled a well-set Karun Nair and changed the course of the last match, combine well again, MI will be difficult to beat.Two SRH bowlers who will be marked men will be Uttar Pradesh’s impressive young leg-spinner Zeshan Ansari, who has taken four wickets in four matches at 35.25 (ER 9.40), and Sri Lankan seamer Eshan Malinga. Taking 2/45 on his debut in four overs in a high-scoring match, Eshan managed to impress Lasith Malinga.The Sri Lankan fastbowling great posted on X after watching him: “Well bowled, Malinga!” MI will no doubt be rejuvenated after their comefrom-behind win against the Delhi Capitals in their last match on Sunday.","Abhishek Sharma is back at the Wankhede, the venue where he smashed that fabulous 54-ball 135 against a stunned England in early Feb this year.

How did it feel it to dismiss your idol Sunil Narine?

You celebrated aggressively when you took Punjab Kings batter

Priyansh Arya

’s wicket...

How do you think success in the IPL will change your career?

Digvesh Rathi , the longhaired Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) mystery spinner , is the toast of IPL-2025, having caught everyone’s attention with his frugal spells and crucial wickets. Having been penalised twice for his extravagant ‘notebook’ celebration, Rathi hopes he can script a memorable season for himself and the franchise.Excerpts from an exclusive interview...I was a batsman initially, but there were very few opportunities. After batting, I would warm up or bowl to senior batsmen, and I learned a lot by watching Sunil Narine ’s bowling (as a net bowler for Kolkata Knight Riders in 2024). I tried those techniques in the nets and learned everything new from there.I never learned the basics. No one taught me. I didn’t do basic bowling! I liked doing ‘mystery bowling’ because it was new to the world, I enjoyed bowling and watching it. I used to bat, but when I bowled in the nets, I found great joy in beating batsmen with mystery balls. I played at a complex in Dilshad Garden (in Delhi), where a senior teammmate, Robin Bisht, told me to focus on bowling. He told me I was meant to be a bowler, not a batsman. That’s when I started. Regarding mystery bowling, if you ask anyone, they’ll likely say they don’t know much about it. Mystery spinners often discuss things among themselves. I spoke to Mujeeb ur Rehman during the Mumbai Indians match, and he thinks the same way I do. Last year, when I was a net bowler for KKR, I spoke to Varun Chakravarthy, and he thinks similarly. I believe all mystery spinners think this way.No one motivated me. Everyone said this ‘mystery’ spin wouldn’t work, that I should give it up and just do regular spin, and that I should play in the Ranji Trophy. All my coaches said I should bowl offspin, but I didn’t like off-spin at all. Cricket in Delhi is so fast-paced that if you bowl offspin, you can only bowl 2-3 overs at the most. After that, batsmen just target the offspinner and try to hit sixes, regardless of the ground size or pitch conditions.Yes, not just for me but for all the cricketers in Delhi. Many cricketers play very well, and for them, the DPL is a big platform. If they’re not able to play domestic cricket for Delhi for some reason, they can perform well in the DPL and also catch the attention of IPL franchises. I took 14 wickets in the DPL. I felt I should have taken more.It was an extremely special moment in my life. I was supposed to bowl in the Powerplay, but in that match, I didn’t get the opportunity. I had prepared a strategic setup for Narine because he bats exceptionally well. My plan was to get him out in the Powerplay, but when I didn’t get to bowl in that period, I felt it would be easier to dismiss him later, when the field was open. I really admire his bowling, although he is also a good batsman.I knew if I bowled to him the way I usually do, I would not be able to get him out.

Hardik Pandya-led Mumbai Indians (MI) will lock horns against Pat Cummins' Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) in Match No 33 of the Indian Premier League (IPL) at the iconic Wankhede Stadium on Thursday.Both the teams will be looking to improve their position in the tournament after securing just two wins each from six matches in this tournament so far.Mumbai Indians have found some positives in Suryakumar Yadav and Tilak Varma's recent performances, during their thrilling win against Delhi Capitals. Naman Dhir has also impressed with his lower-order batting and fielding abilities.Nearing the halfway mark, the Sunrisers are also struggling to find their range, tottering at ninth on the table with only net run rate separating the two teams after four losses and two wins in six matches each. MI has a NRR of +0.10 while SRH's run-rate stands at -1.24.But MI will have to be wary of SRH's batters who have given signs of finding back their mojo after a lull.Each of the top four - Head, Abhishek, Klaasen and Kishan - fired on all cylinders to stun Punjab Kings to give SRH their second win of the season. The match holds special significance for Ishan Kishan, who will be returning to his former home ground at Wankhede Stadium.With Wankhede's surface offering bounce and short boundaries, another high-scoring contest is on the cards.

MUMBAI: The BCCI ’s decision to carry out on-field inspections of bats has become a major talking point. The initiative commenced on Sunday with checks during the RR vs RCB and DC vs MI matches. Pictures of MI skipper Hardik Pandya’s bat undergoing a check went viral.However, on Tuesday, KKR players Sunil Narine and Anrich Nortje became the first to fail the gauge test. Reserve umpire Saiyed Khalid found Narine’s bat oversized before their chase against PBKS. A video shows Narine with Angkrish Raghuvanshi near the dugout during inspection, where Raghuvanshi’s bat passed through the gauge but Narine’s didn’t.Forced to change his bat, a distracted Narine was dismissed for five runs by Marco Jansen. Similarly, debutant Nortje’s bat too failed the gauge test. However, he remained at the non-striker’s end and didn’t take strike. SRH head coach Daniel Vettori downplayed the situation on Wednesday at the Wankhede Stadium, noting regular bat compliance checks occur in dressing rooms.“I wish they’d checked the bats when I was playing,” he joked. “The umpires go through the dressing rooms a lot of the time, so guys know that their bats are compliant. It’ll reset anyone trying to have a bigger bat, but it’s pretty easy to get your bat through that cage.” He acknowledged bat evolution as natural progression, citing manufacturers’ ability to create larger yet lightweight bats. Will bat sizes be reduced in the future to give bowlers more of a chance in the game? “I mean, everyone seems to enjoy sixes and fours.I don’t think we’re going to get a reduction in bat size and it doesn’t really worry me,” Vettori stated. However, Paras Anand, CEO of Meerut-based Sanspareils Greenlands (SG), a wellknown bat manufacturer, feels that the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), the custodians of the laws of the game, and the ICC must look at other areas to restore balance.“Modern-day players practise hitting sixes. Cricket is not what it was 15 years ago. There are other ways of achieving balance between bat and ball, like churning out sporting pitches, using a ball that swings a bit more, or increasing the size of the boundaries. A 1 mm or 2 mm increase in the size of the bats won’t make a difference,” Anand told TOI.Current IPL rules state: “The blade of the bat must not exceed the following dimensions: width 4.25 in or 10.8 cm, depth 2.64 in or 6.7 cm, edge 1.56 in or 4 cm. Moreover, it must be able to pass through a bat gauge.”",KKR's Sunil Narine and Anrich Nortje fail the 'gauge test' during their match against Punjab Kings.

NEW DELHI: Tristan Stubbs starred in a pulsating Super Over win for Delhi Capitals against Rajasthan Royals , hitting a six that sealed the issue after having contributed an 18-ball 34 not out down the order that helped the Capitals put up a fighting total.Stubbs’ maximum came as heartbreak for the Royals, who at one point looked to be in total command of the 189-ball chase. Stubbs’ star turn was one among many for the Capitals, starting with Abhishek Porel, who again showcased his versatility. A natural strokeplayer, Porel blended elegance, aggression, and situational awareness to notch up a sprightly 49 (off 37b; 4x5, 1x6).Thereafter, KL Rahul (38 off 32b), Axar Patel (34 off 14b), Stubbs and Ashutosh Sharma (15* off 11b) made telling contributions as Delhi Capitals posted 188/5. The Royals, though, appeared to have it all under control at one stage during the chase. Nitish Rana (51 off 28b; 6x4, 2x6) brought his ‘A’ game, playing a captivating innings full of aggression. His knock was pivotal in maintaining the momentum after Yashasvi Jaiswal (51 off 37b; 3x4, 4x6) and Sanju Samson (31 retd. off 19b) got RR off to a rocking start.Towards the end, Dhruv Jurel (26 off 17b) and Shimron Hetmyer (15* off 9b) nearly got RR over the line. But DC speedster Mitchell Starc bowled an incredible final over, nailing his yorkers with precision. RR required nine from the final over to win, but the Jurel-Hetmyer duo managed to get only eight.As the match went into a Super Over, the first of this season, Starc once again showed his impressive death-bowling skills as RR put 11 on the board. Chasing 12, KL Rahul and Stubbs walked out for DC, with Sandeep Sharma bowling for Rajasthan. Rahul carved a boundary, and Stubbs smacked the winning six high into the stands over midwicket off the fourth delivery.Earlier, DC opener Porel smashed Tushar Deshpande for 23 runs in the second over. A graceful pick-up whip that saw the ball soar deep into the stands at deep backward square leg was the highlight. As Deshpande delivered it full on the pads, Porel just waited before effortlessly flicking it over the ropes for six.But back-to-back wickets of Jake Fraser-McGurk and Karun Nair saw Porel tone down his belligerent self. While FraserMcGurk fell to the pace and bounce of Jofra Archer, Nair was run out after a horrible mix-up between him and Porel. Rahul’s stint at the crease was sedate and nothing out of the ordinary.He mostly preferred to milk the bowling rather than go for aggressive options. The 63-run partnership between him and Porel took 9.3 overs. Rahul holed out to deep midwicket off Archer’s bowling, and soon Porel miscued one from Wanindu Hasaranga. But skipper Axar Patel injected some much-needed momentum to the DC innings. He first got hold of Hasaranga for a 19-run over in the 16th, and then collected 16 runs off the next one (17th) bowled by Maheesh Theekshana.","Tristan Stubbs hits winning six as Delhi Capitals beat Rajasthan Royals.

Poll Do you support the BCCI's decision to conduct on-field inspections of players' bats? No, it's an unnecessary hassle. Yes, it's necessary for the game's integrity.

The BCCI ’s decision to carry out on-field inspections of players' bats has become a major talking point in IPL-2025 since Sunday, when bat checks were conducted on the field of play during the Rajasthan Royals (RR) vs Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) game and the Delhi Capitals (DC) vs Mumbai Indians (MI) match. Pictures of MI skipper Hardik Pandya’s bat undergoing a check went viral on social media, though a source confirmed that all MI players’ bats were found to be compliant.However, on Tuesday, 'history' was made when the bats of two Kolkata Knight Riders players—opener Sunil Narine and No. 11 Anrich Nortje—failed the 'gauge test' as they walked out to the middle. Narine and Nortje are among the first players to fail the bat size checks in the IPL this year, introduced recently by the BCCI to restore the balance between bat and ball.Narine's bat was found to be oversized before the start of KKR 's unsuccessful chase of PBKS's 111 by reserve umpire Saiyed Khalid outside the playing arena. In a video that has gone viral on social media since Tuesday night, Narine can be seen standing alongside Angkrish Raghuvanshi near the dugout as the bat size was being checked by reserve umpire Sayed Khalid. While Raghuvanshi's bat passed through the 'house-shaped' bat gauge comfortably, Narine's did not fit. Narine was eventually forced to change his bat, and perhaps distracted by this development, the West Indian all-rounder was bowled by left-arm pacer Marco Jansen for just five.Making his debut for KKR, Nortje walked out to bat when KKR were struggling at 95 for nine in the 16th over. His bat size also failed the mandatory size check. However, Nortje didn’t get an opportunity to use his new bat as he was stranded at the non-striker's end when Andre Russell was bowled by Jansen off the first ball of the 16th over.Playing down the issue in the pre-match conference at the Wankhede Stadium before his team’s match against the Mumbai Indians, Sunrisers Hyderabad head coach Daniel Vettori said on Wednesday, “I wish they'd checked the bats when I was playing! No, I don't think it makes any difference. I think the guys get tested regularly. The umpires go through the dressing rooms a lot of the time, so guys know that their bats are compliant, so it's just a quick one second, and everyone moves on, I think. So, I think it'll reset anyone trying to have a bigger bat, but I think it's pretty easy to get your bat through that cage.”The former New Zealand left-arm spinner said that better bats were “a part of the evolution in the game.” “I suppose the way that bats have been able to get bigger without an increase in weight, that's a skill to the bat manufacturers and a demand for what batting groups or batters want these days. So, I think it's just part of the game, part of evolution.”Will bat sizes be reduced in the future to give bowlers more of a chance in the game? “I mean, everyone seems to enjoy sixes and fours, so I don't think we're going to get a reduction in bat size and it doesn't really worry me,” Vettori said.However, Paras Anand , CEO of Meerut-based Sanspareils Greenlands (SG), a well-known bat manufacturer, feels that the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), the custodians of the laws of the game, and the ICC must look at making other changes in the game to restore balance, rather than just being strict on the dimensions of the bats. ""Modern-day players practice hitting sixes. Cricket is not what it was 15 years ago. You would not have seen a Sachin Tendulkar or a Rahul Dravid thrashing the ball in the nets like the current generation of batsmen do these days. Yes, it's important to maintain the balance of the bat and ball. However, there are other ways of doing that, like churning out sporting pitches, using a ball that perhaps swings a bit more, or increasing the size of the ground, rather than just reducing the dimensions of the bat by one or two millimetres. Believe me, one or two mm here and there don't make much of a difference. Those batters who hit sixes will continue doing so even with a different bat,"" Anand told TOI.""A few years back (in 2016), the MCC had declared that from October 2017, the thickness of professional cricket bats would be limited to a maximum of 108mm width, 67mm depth and 40mm edges, after David Warner's bat was found to have a depth of 85mm. Did it bring down the number of sixes?"" he added.While bat size checks in the dressing room have been common practice in previous IPL seasons, the BCCI introduced on-field inspections to ensure greater vigilance, as batters often carry multiple bats. It was not always guaranteed that the bat brought onto the field was the one that had passed the mandatory check.According to the rules, the width of the bat face should not exceed 10.79cm, the thickness of the blade shouldn't be more than 6.7cm, and the width of the edge of the bat cannot be more than 4cm. The length of the bat should not exceed 96.4cm.According to the IPL rulebook: ""The blade of the bat must not exceed the following dimensions - Width: 4.25 in / 10.8 cm, Depth: 2.64 in / 6.7 cm, Edge: 1.56 in / 4.0 cm. Moreover, it must be able to pass through a bat gauge.""Speaking on his YouTube channel called 'Umpire's call by Anil Chaudhary' and his Instagram handle, Anil Chaudhary, who has umpired in a record 131 IPL matches, said, ""Normally, the fourth umpire used to check the bats of the players with the help of the team manager. Normally, a batsman used five to six bats. However, it seems that someone has used a bat which was not of the permitted size. Now, the fourth umpire checks all the bats with the gauge. Since the dugouts are far off in the ground these days, the on-field umpire does this. This will help in the game's integrity and transparency. The bat must go through this gauge. Earlier, we used to check the ball randomly, but now all the bats which will be used in the middle will be checked.""","Kolkata Knight Riders batsmen Sunil Narine and Anrich Nortje fail the 'gauge test' Narine's bat was found to be oversized before the start of KKR's unsuccessful chase of PBKS's 111 by reserve umpire Saiyed Khalid outside the playing arena.

The seven-person medical team faces up to 25 years in prison for alleged negligence in the football legend's final days.Maradona passed away at age 60 while recovering at home from surgery to remove a blood clot in his brain. The cause of death was determined to be heart failure and acute pulmonary edema, a condition where fluid builds up in the lungs.""If they had done their job, this would have been avoided,"" Dalma Maradona, 38, told the court. ""They deceived us in the cruelest way.""The medical team, including physician Leopoldo Luque, is charged with ""homicide with possible intent"" for allegedly knowing their actions could lead to their patient's death.Dalma testified that Dr. Luque had insisted home hospitalization was ""the only option"" and promised 24-hour care with an ambulance on standby.""It never happened,"" she said. ""It was a house where, occasionally, a doctor would come to see him.""She described finding the house in deplorable conditions after her father's death, stating it was ""disgusting, and it smelled like urine.""Dalma also revealed she had attempted to visit her father days before his death but was denied entry by his lawyer and an assistant.Prosecutors allege Maradona endured a ""prolonged, agonizing period"" before his death, having battled cocaine and alcohol addiction for decades.The trial, which had faced delays, is expected to continue until July with nearly 120 witnesses scheduled to testify.The defendants are accused of abandoning their patient and pursuing a course of action despite knowing it could result in his death.","Dalma Maradona testified in court on Tuesday in San Isidro, Argentina, stating that her father's death in November 2020 could have been prevented if his medical team had provided proper care.

Kolkata: Is Jose Molina ’s Mohun Bagan Super Giant the best team in Indian Super League ’s 11-year-old history?Finishing the 2024-2025 season with a remarkable Shield-Cup double, with record-breaking 19 wins and 52 goals, Mohun Bagan have set a benchmark for other teams to emulate. It’s perhaps ideal for them to complete the double with a come-from-behind 2-1 win over Bengaluru FC at their boisterous fortress — the Salt Lake Stadium — which was brought to its feet in game after game in salute of a genuinely special team at play and its repertoire of promise and panache.History will remember Sergio Lobera ’s Mumbai City FC as the first team to do the ISL double when, backed by the financial and technical might of the City Football Group which owns Man City, they achieved the target in Goa in 2020-2021 at a time when the world was existing in a bubble.Molina’s Bagan, in a way, made the real noise. Like Mumbai City of five seasons ago, they too have had a strong financial backing from principal team owner Sanjiv Goenka. Like Lobera’s side, Molina’s team also has had the strongest squad in the league. Bagan’s ascent to a triumphant finish to the league, many believe, looked destined before the season started rolling.Of course, Lobera’s FC Goa in 2019-20 and Des Buckingham’s Mumbai City in 2022-2023 were special in their own rights, but there was also a lingering lament that both these teams failed to explore their full potentiality.True that football, just like life, doesn’t always follow scripts of one’s liking. Credit to Molina for turning his team into a winning machine running on the engine of consistency, character and never-say-die mentality.Take for example the Spaniard’s use of substitutions in the second half here on Saturday, bringing Ashique Kuruniyan and Sahal Abdul Samad in place of an off-colour Liston Colaco and an ineffective Anirudh Thapa.“Sahal and Ashique had their moment in the final. You need great players on the bench who can wait for their moment and change the game,” Molina said after the match. “But at the end of the day, there’s no secret to success. It’s all about hard work and belief,” the Bagan coach pointed out.","Mohun Bagan beat Bengaluru FC to complete the ISL Shield and Cup double. Jose Molina’s Bagan, in a way, made the real noise.

Liverpool moved within touching distance of the Premier League title after a dramatic 2-1 win over West Ham at Anfield on Sunday, thanks to a late header from captain Virgil van Dijk . The result, coupled with Tottenham 's 2-4 defeat to Wolves, widened Liverpool’s lead at the top to 13 points over second-placed Arsenal with just six matches remaining.The Reds rebounded from a stuttering run of form — including defeats to Fulham, Newcastle and Paris Saint-Germain — with a gritty performance. Mohamed Salah ignited Liverpool’s charge in the 18th minute with a brilliant run from halfway, sliding a perfectly timed ball to Luis Diaz , who tapped in from close range.Though an unfortunate own goal from Andy Robertson — deflecting off Van Dijk — briefly pegged Liverpool back in the 86th minute, redemption followed swiftly. Van Dijk rose to meet Alexis Mac Allister’s corner just three minutes later, sealing a vital victory.“In the 18th minute, Mohamed Salah sprinted away on the halfway line, accelerating towards the West Ham area and caressing a perfectly weighted pass to Diaz, who had the simple task of slotting home from six yards,” the club noted.Liverpool could secure their 20th English league championship as early as April 20 if they defeat Leicester and Arsenal slip up at Ipswich.Elsewhere, Tottenham’s domestic woes deepened as Wolves cruised to victory at Molineux.

(An El Clasico fan pens his experience of watching some of his favourite footballers in action)

MUMBAI: A balmy Mumbai evening turned into a time capsule on Sunday a week back as Barcelona and Real Madrid legends rekindled one of football’s fiercest rivalries.While the scoreline read 2-0 in favour of the Real Madrid Leyendas, the night was much more than just goals. It was a celebration of football’s enduring legacy.Fans at the DY Patil Stadium in Navi Mumbai may not have filled every seat, but those in attendance were treated to a surreal experience.FIFA World Cup and UEFA Champions League winners graced the pitch. Xavi Hernandez , Rivaldo , Carles Puyol for Barcelona, and Luis Figo , Fernando Morientes, and Michael Owen for Madrid.Though older and past their competitive prime, the skill, footballing IQ, and passion were unmistakably intact.The match saw Morientes strike early with a trademark finish in the 15th minute, followed by David Barral doubling Madrid’s lead midway through the second half.Despite the deficit, Barça responded with composure and flair, orchestrated by Xavi and spearheaded by a lively Rivaldo.Phillip Cocu made his long-awaited return in a Blaugrana jersey, while Javier Saviola - who sported colours for both clubs in his playing days - added bursts of energy. Yet, the Catalans couldn’t find the finishing touch.On the Madrid side, the ball gravitated towards Figo, who looked sharp and determined, still very much the heart of Los Blancos.Every touch from the Portuguese legend was met with thunderous cheers or emphatic boos, depending on the fan allegiance, proof that the rivalry, though friendly in nature, still runs deep.What stood out beyond the game was the atmosphere in the stands. Indian fans, many of whom grew up idolising these players, sang, waved club banners, and relived memories from a golden era.Despite the rivalry, camaraderie was in abundance.Barca and Madrid fans shared stands, clicked pictures for each other, and engaged in healthy banter, a rare sight for a fixture historically defined by tension.While the match saw passionate attendance, the reach was limited: advertising, ticket pricing, and scheduling played a role.For such events to serve as a launchpad for football’s growth in India, there is a need for broader awareness, grassroots engagement, and structured interaction between legends and local players or coaches.Ultimately, Mumbai witnessed more than a match.It was a reminder of football’s power to inspire and unite. It was an evening where legends walked again and a generation of fans got a glimpse of their heroes not through screens, but in the flesh.","A week ago in Mumbai, football legends from Barcelona and Real Madrid reignited their rivalry in an exhibition match.

Kolkata: If winning is a habit, trust Mohun Bagan SG to make it a magical monotony at home this season.Let them face the biggest of challenges, let them have all sorts of odds stacked against them and let them be forced to trail with a title at stake. But invariably and unflinchingly, expect Jose Molina’s men to find a way out of the crisis and have the last laugh. Bengaluru FC learnt this in quite a compelling way at the Salt Lake Stadium. Gerard Zaragoza’s visitors were welcomed to the Bagan’s formidable fortress with a giant tifo from the home fans — “Champion’s home, entry prohibited.”Yet they silenced the thunderous crowd when Alberto Rodriguez was forced into conceding an own goal while dealing with Ryan Williams’ centre in the 49th minute.Jason Cummings’ penalty in the 72nd minute and Jamie Maclaren’s poacher’s goal six minutes into the first half of extra time were all Bagan required to script a turnaround in a 2-1 win here on Saturday and become the second team after Mumbai City FC to complete the Indian Super League double.A year ago, Bagan lost a similar opportunity to Mumbai City at the same place. But this season they seemed to be a different beast, assuming a juggernaut crushing one opponent after another at home to stretch their winning run to 14 matches. Two months after sealing their back-to-back Shield, they deservedly lifted the ISL Cup in front of 59,112 spectators.It’s quite a journey for Molina’s men. Nine months ago, BFC inflicted the heaviest defeat on them (0-3), putting Molina’s Bagan project under serious question mark. Now claiming the double at BFC’s expense should come as completion of a circle for the winners.Bagan began in a way culled straight from their playbook, setting the alarm bells ringing in the all-Indian rival defence with some trademark moves from the wings. Having somehow managed to weather that storm, BFC started to establish a more recognizable rhythm. BFC duly and deservedly went ahead soon after the restart. It started with another incisive run from Ryan Williams down the right and the Australian delivered an inviting cross. Rodriguez ended up miskicking it into his own.Molina sought intervention from the bench. The introduction of Ashique Kuruniyan and Sahal Abdul Samad brought pace and panache to the attack. When Cummings swivelled to take aim, it looked destined for a goal but Gurpreet denied him. But BFC caved in to Bagan’s constant pressure.As Maclaren tried to get past Chinglensana Singh following Cummings’ centre, the ball touched the BFC centre-back’s hands, forcing referee Senthil Nathan to point to the spot. Cummings made no mistake in beating Gurpreet.Maclaren then provided the coup de grace.",Mohun Bagan beat Bengaluru FC 2-1 to complete the ISL Shield and Cup double. Jason Cummings’ penalty in the 72nd minute and Jamie Maclaren’s goal six minutes into the first half of extra time were all Bagan required.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120248559,imgsize-204508,width-400,resizemode-4/Mohun-Bagan-BFC-ISL.jpg"

Poll Do you think Barcelona can maintain their unbeaten run for the rest of the season? No, they will face tougher opponents. Yes, they have the momentum.

Barcelona secured a crucial 1-0 victory against Leganes through Jorge Saenz's own goal on Saturday at Butarque stadium, extending their lead to seven points at the top of La Liga .

""(Madrid) have a match tomorrow but we're only looking at ourselves, three points is good and we had a great week.""""In the end what is important in these games are three points,"" Barcelona defender Eric Garcia told DAZN. ""I think this is the type of game where the league is won... we're top of the table, which is where we want to be, and today we could extend that distance a bit.""The match was a reversal of fortunes from December when Leganes won 1-0 at Barcelona's home ground.Leganes created the best chance of a lackluster first half when Dani Raba set up Adria Altimira, whose shot was saved by Barcelona goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny.Barcelona suffered a setback when defender Alejandro Balde was forced off with a muscular injury before halftime.""Balde is not so good... (but) I will say nothing and we will wait until tomorrow,"" Flick commented on the injury.The breakthrough came after halftime when Raphinha's low cross was deflected into his own net by Saenz, with Robert Lewandowski's presence forcing the error.Barcelona created several chances afterward, with Fermin Lopez missing a clear opportunity and Lewandowski heading wide from Raphinha's cross.Leganes thought they had equalised through Raba's header, but it was ruled offside. Diego Garcia also missed a good chance late in the game.The match concluded with a crucial tackle by Inigo Martinez on former Barcelona player Munir El Haddadi, preserving the visitors' victory.""The last save (by Martinez) was unbelievable,"" said Flick. ""Everyone celebrated this as if it was a goal.""The defeat leaves Leganes in 19th place, two points from safety.""It's so tough... we leave with empty hands against a Barca that, while it's true they attacked against us, they were not as efficient as usual, and you leave with a bitter feeling because we put in a great performance,"" Leganes midfielder Renato Tapia told DAZN.""We can do it (stay up), and I think today we showed it.""Jules Kounde had Barcelona's only other notable attempt in the first half, with his deflected shot saved by Leganes goalkeeper Marko Dmitrovic.Teenage star Lamine Yamal forced a late save from Dmitrovic at his near post as Barcelona looked to secure their narrow advantage.Flick made tactical changes at halftime, bringing on Frenkie de Jong for Ronald Araujo and moving Eric Garcia into defense, which ultimately helped secure the victory.",Barcelona beat Leganes 1-0 at Butarque stadium in La Liga.

Formula E is now in its 11th season since its debut in 2014, and the electric motorsport has achieved impressive success, carving its own identity despite the dominance of Formula 1. One of the key indicators of this success is the growing grid of 11 teams and 22 drivers—one more than the 10 teams in F1. While drivers like Oliver Rowland and Pascal Wehrlein have previously tested their skills in F1, it seems they've found their true calling in the more sustainable and rapidly evolving Formula E.Oliver Rowland is currently leading the Formula E standings with 68 points, thanks to his victory at this season’s Mexico City E-Prix. Rowland had a brief stint with F1 team Williams in 2018 before transitioning to Formula E, where he raced for Mahindra Racing and then Nissan, ultimately making a name for himself with the Japanese team. Antonio Felix da Costa, driving for Porsche, is also a formidable force in the series. He currently sits in third place with 39 points this season, continuing to prove his prowess on the track.Maximilian Günther has made a strong impression after his move from Maserati MSG Racing to DS Penske. At the Jeddah E-Prix, Günther took pole position, posted the fastest lap, and ultimately clinched the victory. With this standout performance, he’s now eyeing an even higher position, currently sitting fourth in the driver standings.German driver Pascal Wehrlein, another former F1 racer, began his Formula E career with Mahindra Racing before joining Tag Heuer Porsche. After winning the Formula E World Championship last season, Wehrlein has maintained his strong form, registering the fastest lap in two races this season—at the São Paulo and Mexico City E-Prix. He’s currently in eighth place with 25 points but remains a serious contender with 7 career wins and 6 pole positions to his name.Mitch Evans, a consistent presence with Jaguar TCS Racing since 2016, continues to be among the best drivers in Formula E.

Who founded Formula E

All eyes are currently on Formula 1 , as the season kicked off last month in Australia. However, there's another motorsport series that deserves just as much attention—one that not only thrills but is also in tune with the global movement for sustainability. Enter Formula E, the FIA-recognized single-seater world championship. Like Formula 1, it showcases high-speed racing, but with a key distinction: it’s environmentally conscious. Formula E uses all-electric cars, offering a cleaner, greener alternative to traditional motorsports while also driving innovation in the electric vehicle sector.Formula E cars are smaller, lighter, and require far fewer tire changes over the course of the season, which helps minimize their environmental footprint. And if you’re wondering whether these electric racers can deliver the same level of excitement as Formula 1, consider this: the Generation 3 Formula E car can reach speeds exceeding 100 km/h, proving that sustainability and speed can indeed go hand in hand.The ABB FIA Formula E Championship is currently in its 11th season, with the next race—the Miami ePrix—set for April 12. The season will run until July 27, with many more thrilling races scheduled across the globe.Formula 1 has been around since 1950 and has only evolved into hybrid vehicles relying on fossil fuels like E10 fuel (a mix of 90% petrol and 10% renewable ethanol). In contrast, Formula E is the motorsport of the 21st century after coming into existence in 2014. These races feature all-electric cars that run on powertrains converting energy from a battery into motion.One of the most striking differences between the two sports is how the cars handle tire changes. In Formula 1, teams often swap tires multiple times during a single race due to varying track conditions. In Formula E, however, teams are only allowed to change tires twice throughout the entire championship. The tires used in Formula E are made from natural rubber and recycled fibers, and are specifically designed to perform well in all weather conditions.Despite this difference, Formula E is by no means inferior. While a Formula 1 car can reach speeds in excess of 350 km/h, the new Formula E Gen3 Evo can reach 322 km/h, but it can accelerate faster than a F1 car. It can go from 0-100 km/h in 1.86 seconds., faster than many Formula 1 cars.Although both series use the same chassis, battery, and tires, the real performance differences come from the powertrains provided by each team. There is one aspect where Formula 1 still holds an edge, primarily due to the electric car's battery limitations. As the battery depletes, an electric car loses speed, requiring a pit stop to recharge in a flash. A Formula 1 car, on the other hand, can maintain top speed even with a quarter tank of fuel.Additionally, Formula E cars must be kept light—around 284 kg for the battery, which accounts for one-third of the car's weight that’s fixed at 840 kg, including the driver.Despite the technical differences, Formula E has its own appeal. Even Red Bull driver Max Verstappen has acknowledged how difficult it can be to drive the RB21. In comparison, electric cars in Formula E are simpler, with single-speed transmission and no gear shifts necessary, unlike the multiple gears in a F1 car.Currently, Formula E features 11 teams, with 22 drivers. Unlike Formula 1, where the top speeds are often the focus, Formula E records are typically based on average race speeds. The fastest race in Formula E history took place in Cape Town in 2023, with an average speed of 132.2 km/h.Practice sessions are held on Friday and Saturday, lasting 30 minutes each, giving drivers a chance to fine-tune their performance.Qualifying: Drivers are split into two groups based on their championship standing. Each group has a 10-minute session to set the fastest lap at 300 kW. The top 4 from each group then advance to the ""duels"" stage, where drivers face off head-to-head at 350 kW in a series of quarter-finals, semi-finals, and a final. The winner of the final claims pole position.The top ten drivers receive points using the standard FIA system (25–18–15–12–10–8–6–4–2–1). The pole position winner earns an additional 3 points, while the driver setting the fastest lap (if they finish in the top ten) receives 1 point.Drivers can deploy a combined 8 minutes of Attack Mode during the race. It provides additional power, activated by driving through a designated area of the circuit off the racing line. All Attack Modes must be used before the end of the race.A new feature has been introduced this season. It requires all drivers to make a mandatory 30-second pit stop to recharge their car's batteries at 600 kW. This adds 3.85 kWh of energy (around 10% more) to be used for the remainder of the race.Formula E was founded by Spanish businessman Alejandro Agag, who serves as the company's Chairman, while Jeff Dodds is the Chief Executive Officer. Many may not realize that Warner Bros. Discovery is among its shareholders.","Formula E is the FIA-recognized single-seater world championship.

Japan beat Canada to qualify for finals

Tokyo:

Pune: For Indian women’s tennis team captain Vishaal Uppal , it was “mission accomplished” after his team secured their World Group Playoff berth in the Billie Jean King Cup .“At the start, I sent the team a message saying our mission is Project Playoff. And it’s mission accomplished,” Uppal said on Saturday after India beat South Korea 2-1 in their last round-robin match to finish in the top two in Asia-Oceania Group 1 .“We have just proven when we become ‘We’, what we can achieve. It’s truly amazing. I know I was tough on them this week. I pushed them. But we had Project Playoff. It was a team effort,” said the former Davis Cupper.Shrivalli Rashmikaa played a stellar role as she won all her five singles matches, but Uppal emphasised on the team bonding, which he said played a vital role in lifting the Hyderabad girl’s performance. “She beat a lot of higher ranked players this week,” he said.“We’re playing a team competition, and for her to come out and perform like that, I think the credit has to go to the entire team,” he said. “When Shrivalli beat (Hong Yi) Cody Wong (of Hong Kong) the other day and Ankita ran on to the court and hugged her. That says a lot.” Ankita Raina played her part in the team’s success, combining with fellow senior Prarthana Thombare , to clinch the decisive doubles rubber against Korea. “It was deja-vu for me. When it became one-all against Korea, I remembered the mindset I had in Dubai for doubles, and tried to keep that momentum,” she said, referring to the last time India advanced to the playoffs in 2020.“And we were aggressive because as we all know that in doubles, the momentum can change quickly,” she said, adding, “We really came together. We are traveling and playing by ourselves, but there’s this one week every year when we come together as a team.”Prarthana, Asian Games doubles bronze medallist with Sania Mirza in 2014, hit the winning shot — a sizzling forehand service return down the line. And she was modest about it all.“Sahaja (Yamalapalli) and Shrivalli were fighting their hearts out. And it gives us the confidence,” the 30-year-old from Barshi said. “As much as it is ours, it is each and every person who wants to play tennis. It’s their win as well.”Ena Shibahara and Shuko Aoyama defeated Kayla Cross and Rebecca Marino 6-3, 5-7, 6-2 in the decisive doubles match to secure Japan a spot in the Billie Jean King Cup Finals on Sunday.The BJK Cup Finals will be played in Shenzhen in September.","India beat South Korea 2-1 in their last round-robin match to finish in the top two in Asia-Oceania Group 1.

Alcaraz wins

Monte Carlo Masters

Carlos Alcaraz had an outstanding start to his clay-court season last week, clinching the Monte Carlo title on Sunday for the first time in his career.After missing this Masters 1000 event last year, he earned the full 1,000 ranking points when he beat Lorenzo Musetti in the final, elevating his total from 6,720 to 7,720 points.As a result, Alcaraz moves one place in the latest ATP rankings (April1 4), moving up from No. 3 to No. 2, surpassing Alexander Zverev, who lost his first match in Monte Carlo this year. Zverev’s ranking points drop from 7,645 to 7,595, causing him to fall one place.This marks Alcaraz's first return to the Top 2 since October 28 last year, when he was also ranked No. 2; he had spent 23 consecutive weeks at No. 3 since then. Overall, this is his 89th week in the Top 2, with 36 weeks at No. 1 and 53 weeks at No. 2.Alcaraz also narrows the gap between him and current No. 1 Jannik Sinner, who is suspended presently, from 3,610 points (10,330 to 6,720) to 2,210 points (9,930 to 7,720).Sinner missed Monte Carlo while defending semi-final points as he serves a three-month suspension for two failed dope tests last year. Although Alcaraz can’t overtake him before Sinner returns on the tour in Rome, winning both Barcelona and Madrid in the coming weeks could reduce that gap to just 720 points, putting the No. 1 ranking within reach in Italy.In addition to Alcaraz and Zverev's place swap, there was movement elsewhere in the ATP Top 10: Alex de Minaur made the biggest jump, climbing from No. 10 to No. 7 — just one spot shy of his career-high of No. 6 — after reaching the semifinals of his second Masters 1000 event.Andrey Rublev also rose from No. 9 back to No. 8, while Daniil Medvedev returned to the Top 10 after being outside for two weeks, moving from No. 11 to No. 9. This marked the 2021 US Open champion's first absence from the elite group in over two years, dating back to February 2023.Meanwhile, Musetti closed in on a Top 10 debut, climbing from No. 16 to No. 11 — surpassing his previous career - high of No. 15 — after reaching the finals of his first Masters 1000 event. He’s now just 15 points behind the No. 10-ranked Ruud, with scores of 3,215 to 3,200.""I'm just really happy to have won Monte Carlo for the first time,"" Alcaraz said. ""It's been a really difficult week with a lot of difficult situations. I'm really proud of myself, how I've dealt with everything. It's been a really difficult month for me on the court and outside. Coming here and seeing how the whole hard work has paid off, I'm really happy.""This victory represents Alcaraz's first clay court success since his French Open triumph last season, with his only other clay court appearance resulting in a silver medal at the Paris Olympics.Musetti, appearing in his first Masters 1000 final after defeating top 10 players Stefanos Tsitsipas and Alex de Minaur, started strongly but faced physical challenges as the match progressed.The Italian received medical treatment for his right leg when trailing 0-3 in the final set, though he continued to play despite the injury.""It is not the way I would have wanted to win a match,"" Alcaraz said. ""Lorenzo's been through a really tough week, long and intense matches. I feel sorry for him, one of the best results he has done. To end like this is not easy. Hopefully it's not serious and he's 100 percent soon.""""It was probably one of my best tournaments so far,"" Musetti said, who won bronze at last year's Olympics behind Alcaraz and gold medalist Novak Djokovic. ""I'm disappointed I couldn't finish the match in the best way, for the crowd. You deserve it so I will keep going and try and come back for revenge.""The match began with Musetti dropping his opening service game but immediately breaking back and taking the first set, capitalising on Alcaraz's six unforced errors.Alcaraz's game improved significantly in the second set, which he won convincingly before completing the victory with a dominant final set.Both players will continue their clay court preparations at the Barcelona Open next week as they build toward the French Open at the end of May.","Carlos Alcaraz won the Monte Carlo Masters for the first time in his career. He beat Lorenzo Musetti in the final, earning the full 1,000 ranking points.

Carlos Alcaraz captured his first Monte Carlo Masters title on Sunday with a commanding 3-6, 6-1, 6-0 win over Italy’s Lorenzo Musetti , marking his sixth Masters 1000 crown and most significant title since Wimbledon 2024.The 21-year-old Spaniard, a four-time Grand Slam champion, overcame a slow start to dominate the final two sets, showcasing his trademark intensity and athleticism. Alcaraz had lost in the opening round on his only previous appearance at Monte Carlo in 2022 but returned stronger this year.“It’s been a really difficult week and a tough month for me, both on and off the court,” said Alcaraz. “I’m proud of how I dealt with everything.”Musetti, playing in his first Masters 1000 final, started brightly, rallying from an early break to take the opening set. However, the Italian began struggling with a leg issue early in the third set, requiring medical attention at 0-3. From that point, Alcaraz never looked back, sealing the decider without dropping a game.Despite the defeat, Musetti earned a rankings boost to World No. 11 and valuable experience ahead of the French Open . “It was probably one of my best tournaments so far,” he said. “I’m disappointed I couldn’t finish stronger, but I’ll come back for revenge.”Alcaraz will rise to World No. 2, overtaking Alexander Zverev, as the clay-court season intensifies. With Roland Garros on the horizon, his Monte Carlo triumph sets the tone for another strong title push.","Carlos Alcaraz wins first Monte Carlo Masters title.

Carlos Alcaraz secured his first Monte Carlo Masters final appearance by defeating fellow Spaniard Alejandro Davidovich Fokina 7-6 (7/2), 6-4 on Saturday. He will face 13th-seeded Italian Lorenzo Musetti , who overcame Australian eighth seed Alex de Minaur 1-6, 6-4, 7-6 (7/4) in the second semi-final.Four-time Grand Slam champion Alcaraz is seeking his first Masters title since his victory at Indian Wells last year. His only title this season came at the ATP 500 event in Rotterdam in February.""I knew how well Davidovich Fokina had played in Monte Carlo so I had to be ready to fight,"" said Alcaraz.""It's been a long time since I've had the chance to win a title on clay and I can't wait to try my luck again here,"" Alcaraz said, referencing his Olympic final loss to Novak Djokovic in August.""At the beginning of the week, the first tournament on clay, you have to get used to the conditions,"" he added. ""The ball comes different. You know, the play on clay is different... I'm just really happy to get the level that I wanted at the beginning of the week.""Alcaraz emerged as the tournament favourite following early exits by top seed Alexander Zverev and Novak Djokovic, while world number one Jannik Sinner remains suspended due to a doping ban.""The first question, you know, since Jannik was unable to play tournaments, a lot of people were asking me and talking about, how important (the) moment that I have ahead is to reach the number one (ranking) again or to win tournaments or whatever,"" Alcaraz said. ""I was thinking so much about it instead of playing my good tennis and enjoy the time that I have, stepping on the court and playing matches.""The 21-year-old Spaniard started strongly against world number 42 Davidovich Fokina, securing an early break. However, Davidovich Fokina fought back to level at 5-5 before losing the first-set tiebreak 7/2.Alcaraz broke early again in the second set and maintained his advantage despite Davidovich Fokina saving 13 break points and four match points.In the other semi-final, Musetti overcame a difficult start where he lost all four service games in the first set. The Italian regained his composure in the second set, breaking De Minaur in the ninth game.The decisive third set saw multiple service breaks before heading to a tiebreak, where Musetti prevailed on his first match point when De Minaur hit a forehand into the net.""It means so much. Honestly, it's unexpected,"" said Musetti, who will enter the world's top 10 if he wins the final. ""If I look back where we started, at the beginning of the week, I was of course dreaming to be in final and to have the chance to play for the top 10, for the title, for a lot of things.""The final will be a rematch between Alcaraz and Musetti, with the Spaniard winning their last three encounters. However, Musetti won their only previous final meeting in Hamburg in 2022.""For sure the key of that match was the mental part,"" added Musetti.

The Hyderabad girl — with a smooth serving action and fluid, strong ground strokes on both the flanks — broke Tararudee twice in both the sets, although in different circumstances.Shrivalli — ranked 345th in the world, which is nearly 190 spots lower than her rival — nudged ahead 4-2 in the first set when Tararudee double-faulted on second breakpoint. The Thai saved the first one with an ace down Shrivalli’s backhand before the latter set up another chance with an accurate service return that landed right at Tararudee’s feet.Tararudee, impressive with her accuracy and placement, upped her intensity in the following game, pulling Shrivalli wide and opening up the court. But the Indian did well to hold off the challenge. Shrivalli rode on the momentum to close the set in the 10th game when Tararudee put an overhead smash into the net on breakpoint.The 23-year-old Indian dropped serve in the opening game of the second set against the run of play and it seemed Tararudee, world No. 166, had taken control of the proceedings for a while. Shrivalli then turned it around brilliantly when, trailing 2-4, took the next four games in a row to clinch the match.The focus then shifted on Sahaja, who ran away to a 3-0 lead.","Ankita Raina and Prarthana Thombare pull off the decisive doubles rubber to help India pip Thailand 2-1 in their second match of the Billie Jean King Cup Asia- Oceania Group 1 women’s team tennis competition.

PUNE: India's young women tennis players have produced sparks of brilliance in recent times. They have a chance to step up to the next level when they compete in the AsiaOceania Group 1 competition of the Billie Jean King Cup , starting here on Tuesday.The Indian women barely managed to stay in the group after finishing fourth in the six-team event, held in China, last year. With Japan and the hosts having advanced to the Qualifiers, this edition presents Vishaal Uppal’s side with the best chance to go through to the playoffs.Team captain Uppal, a former Davis Cupper, has led the team to the World Group playoffs in 2020, a first for the Indian women. They lost to Latvia away the following year. Four years on, things couldn’t have been more different.The highest-ranked player in the field is World No. 41 Lulu Sun from New Zealand. The 23-year-old of mixed heritage caught the attention with her quarterfinal run at the Wimbledon as a qualifier last year, beating then World No. 8 Qinwen Zheng in the first round. Besides Sun, Thailand’s Mananchaya Sawangkaew (world ranked 110) and Lanlana Tararudee (166) as well as Joanna Garland of Chinese Taipei pose a major threat.“It’s a very even group. If you see the rankings of all the teams, they’re very similar, not much to choose from. So that makes the group very tough and very competitive,” Uppal said.Changes have swept through the Indian team as well. None of the players is ranked in the top-300, unlike in 2021 when Ankita Raina was 183. The side is also without Karman Kaur Thandi, who had broken into the top-200 in 2018 but is currently unranked owing to a lengthy injury layoff. Yet, Shrivalli Rashmikaa and Sahaja Yamalapalli have kept the hopes alive with some stand-out performances.There couldn’t have been a stronger fourth singles player than Vaidehee Chaudhari while Prarthana Thombare brings in the much needed experience and solidity as the doubles player.",India's women play in the AsiaOceania Group 1 competition of the Billie Jean King Cup.

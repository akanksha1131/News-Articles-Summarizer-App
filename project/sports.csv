Why Pat Cummins laughed when he was asked about facing Jasprit Bumrah

NEW DELHI: Australia captain Pat Cummins lauded India’s pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah , acknowledging his exceptional form and consistent ability to trouble batters across all formats. Speaking ahead of the fifth and final Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy at the Sydney Cricket Ground, Cummins admitted that facing Bumrah is always a daunting task.""Bumrah is bowling well at the moment. He is always tough,"" Cummins said during the pre-match press conference. ""Hopefully, by the time I come in, late in the day, he has bowled quite a bit, which might make it a bit easier for me. But he is bowling well. I’ve faced him quite a bit across the world in different formats, and he always poses a challenge.""In a lighthearted comment, Cummins added, ""Last game, it helped as I was at the non-striker’s end. That certainly helped [laugh].""Australia, leading the series 2-1, have the chance to secure the Border-Gavaskar Trophy for the first time since 2014-15 with a win or draw in Sydney. Victory would also guarantee their place in the World Test Championship final at Lord’s in June against South Africa.In addition to praising Bumrah, Cummins confirmed a few changes in Australia’s lineup . Allrounder Mitch Marsh has been dropped following a string of underwhelming performances, with Beau Webster set to make his debut.""Mitchy obviously hasn’t quite got the runs or wickets he would have liked this series and felt like it was time for a freshen up,"" Cummins explained. ""Beau’s been with the squad and been great. It’s a shame for Mitchy because we know how much he brings to the team, but we feel like now is a good time for Beau to get a chance."" Mitchell Starc , despite carrying a rib niggle, has been retained and will feature in the bowling attack alongside Cummins, Scott Boland, and Nathan Lyon. Starc’s inclusion underscores his significance, with Cummins remarking, ""He was never going to miss this one.""","Pat Cummins hails Jasprit Bumrah's form and ability to trouble batters.

Pat Cummins reveals Australia's XI for Boxing Day Test

NEW DELHI: Melbourne witnessed high-octane cricket and heated moments during the Boxing Day Test at the MCG, where Virat Kohli 's shoulder bump incident with Australian debutant Sam Konstas became a major talking point.Konstas, in his very first Test appearance, stunned the cricketing world with a fearless display against India's premier pacer Jasprit Bumrah . The young batter executed a daring ramp shot for six over wicketkeeper Rishabh Pant’s head, leaving the Indian team momentarily stunned.However, tensions boiled over at the end of the 10th over when Kohli brushed shoulders with Konstas. The heated exchange that followed saw Usman Khawaja step in to diffuse the situation.Former Australia captain Michael Clarke weighed in on the incident, suggesting Kohli’s reaction stemmed from frustration at the respect - or lack thereof - shown to Bumrah.""Virat is such a tough player. He will not take a backward step and never has throughout his whole career. I think Virat was getting frustrated with the lack of respect that Sam was showing as the best bowler in the world in Bumrah,"" Clarke remarked on the Beyond 23 Cricket Podcast.Despite the fiery exchange, Clarke defended Kohli's character, adding, ""I am sure he would have spoken to Sam after the game. Virat is a great guy. He is not a nasty person. I think it was Virat sticking up for his team.""Konstas went on to score an impressive 60 off 65 deliveries, including six fours and two sixes, before falling to Ravindra Jadeja. Australia secured a commanding 184-run victory, taking a 2-1 lead in the series.In the same game, another Indian star emerged - Nitish Kumar Reddy , whose maiden Test century came at a critical juncture for India. Clarke praised the 21-year-old all-rounder, calling him a ""genius"" and advocating for his promotion in the batting order. ""He has not feared any Australian bowler. He bats, bowls, and fields.

NEW DELHI: The 2024 World Blitz Championship final in Wall Street, New York culminated in a groundbreaking decision as Magnus Carlsen and Ian Nepomniachtchi chose to share the coveted title.This unprecedented outcome followed an intense, closely fought series of games that, if not anything, tested both players’ resilience and mastery under extreme time pressure.The championship final saw Carlsen start strongly, seizing victory in the first two games.In the opener, he converted a precarious position where his queen and pawn outmanoeuvred Nepo’s rook pair.Carlsen followed this with another commanding victory, this time playing White, setting the stage to retain his title with just a draw in Game 3.However, Nepomniachtchi mounted an incredible comeback in the third game. Employing tactical brilliance in an endgame of rook pair versus rook and bishop, Nepo outplayed Carlsen and kept his chances alive.With the score at 2.0-1.0, the pressure on Nepo to win Game 4 was immense.Rising to the occasion, the Russian delivered a tactical masterstroke, sacrificing a knight to force a decisive win and level the match at 2.0-2.0, pushing the contest into sudden death.The sudden-death rounds were marked by unmatched precision, with both players displaying over 98% accuracy—an incredible feat given the limited time control.Despite the tension, the first game ended in a hard-fought draw. The second sudden-death game followed the same script. In the third, both players mirrored their earlier consistency, battling to yet another stalemate.Following some discussions, FIDE and both players agreed on a historic compromise: to share the title. This marked the first time in the World Blitz Championship's history that dual winners were declared.“It feels very good to share gold with Nepo. We reached a point where it had been a long day. We played many games, we had three draws and I felt that I could keep playing. But it was a nice solution to share the win, it was a good way to end it,” Carlsen, reflecting on the decision to share the title, told the Norwegian media NRK.","Magnus Carlsen and Ian Nepomniachtchi share World Blitz Championship title.

Marsh has managed just 73 runs at an average of 10.42, prompting selectors to opt for Webster as a stronger batting option in the top six.Webster’s impressive recent first-class bowling performances also played a role in the decision, offering additional depth to Australia’s attack, especially with the short turnaround after their fifth-day victory in Melbourne.Australia lead the series 2-1 and will look to seal the contest in Sydney with a fresh combination.Cummins, speaking ahead of the match, expressed confidence in Webster’s ability to contribute to the team’s performance.

Nitish Reddy reveals Virat Kohli’s special words for him after hundred at MCG

With Australia leading the five Test Border-Gavaskar Trophy 2-1 against India on the back of a 184-run victory in the Boxing Day Test at MCG, the action now shifts to the Sydney Cricket Ground ( SCG ) in Sydney for the fifth and final Test of the series.India's record at this venue has been notably poor, with only a single victory, which came way back in January 1978 under the leadership of Bishan Singh Bedi, in their 13 Tests. It is worth examining India's last Test performance at this historic ground.The SCG has historically been a venue where Team India has faced both challenges and triumphs. The last time India played at the SCG, during the Border-Gavaskar Trophy 2020-21, the match turned out to be a thrilling and iconic chapter in Test cricket history.The third Test of the series, held from January 7 to 11, 2021, ended in a dramatic draw, with India showcasing immense grit and determination. Batting first, Australia posted a formidable 338, powered by Steve Smith’s masterful 131 and Marnus Labuschagne’s 91.India responded with 244, thanks to Shubman Gill's impressive 50 and Cheteshwar Pujara ’s gritty 50, but they conceded a significant first-innings lead.Australia set India a daunting target of 407, declaring their second innings at 312/6. With two full days to survive, India faced an uphill battle. The situation looked bleak after losing openers Rohit Sharma and Shubman Gill early on Day 5. However, it was the resilience of the middle and lower order that turned the tide.Rishabh Pant’s counterattacking 97 off 118 balls reignited hope, while Cheteshwar Pujara held firm with a determined 77. The defining moment, however, was the remarkable partnership between Vihari (23* off 161 balls) and Ashwin (39* off 128 balls). Both players, battling injuries, batted for over 42 overs to ensure India secured an unforgettable draw.The result set the stage for their historic series win at the Gabba. The SCG Test remains a symbol of India’s fighting spirit and determination to defy the odds on foreign soil.","Australia lead the five Test Border-Gavaskar Trophy 2-1 against India.

Nitish Reddy reveals Virat Kohli’s special words for him after hundred at MCG

London: Liverpool moved a step closer to a record-equalling 20th English top-flight title as a 5-0 thrashing of West Ham opened up an eight-point lead at the top of the Premier League Luis Diaz , Cody Gakpo, Mohamed Salah , Trent Alexander-Arnold and Diogo Jota were on target for the rampant Reds in east London as they ended the year as huge favourites to deliver just a second league title in 35 years.Nottingham Forest are the surprise closest challengers in second, but Arsenal and Chelsea can close the gap when they are in action later in the week.Arne Slot has repeatedly stressed nothing can be won yet with Liverpool still one game shy of the halfway mark in the Premier League.But the Dutchman's succession of Jurgen Klopp continues to look flawless after a 23rd win in 27 matches in all competitions.""I enjoyed it a lot because it doesn't happen many times that I could just sit back and enjoy,"" said Slot.Diaz had been rested for the 3-1 win over Leicester on Boxing Day and it was the Colombian who opened the floodgates on 30 minutes at the London Stadium.His intended pass into Curtis Jones rebounded back into his path off a West Ham defender and he dispatched his shot low into the corner.Mohammed Kudus was inches away from an equaliser when his effort came back off the post.But another heavy home defeat puts Hammers boss Julen Lopetegui back under pressure after a four-game unbeaten run.""We are talking about the best team in the Premier League and around the world, but at home and in front of our fans, I am very sorry about this,"" said Lopetegui.Two goals in four minutes just before half-time killed the game as a contest.Salah's delightful turn helped tee up Gakpo to roll in his ninth goal in 14 games.The Egyptian then curled in at Alphonse Areola's near post, with some help from the West Ham goalkeeper, to hit the 20-goal mark for the eighth consecutive season since joining Liverpool in 2017.Speculation over Alexander-Arnold, Salah and Virgil van Dijk's futures has not derailed Liverpool's flying start under Slot.All three could discuss a move to a foreign club on a free transfer next season within days, but remain focused for the moment on winning a second Premier League title together.""The only thing in my mind is that I want Liverpool to win the league and I want to be part of it,"" said Salah.""That is the only thing I have focused on. I will do my best to win the trophy. We are in the right direction but there are other teams trying to catch up with us.

NEW DELHI: Pep Guardiola 's Manchester City secured a much-needed 2-0 victory over Leicester City on Sunday, ending a run of eight away games without a win.The victory provided some relief for the crisis-hit English champions , who have been struggling with a remarkable slump in form.The first half saw City take the lead through Savinho's strike, but Leicester squandered several chances to equalize, with Jamie Vardy and James Justin missing golden opportunities.After the break, Erling Haaland doubled City's lead with a powerful header, scoring his 19th goal of the season and ending his four-game goal drought.Despite the win, City's performance was still far from the standards they have set in recent years, having won an unprecedented four consecutive English top-flight titles.However, the celebrations after Haaland's goal showed that the three points were all that mattered for the visitors, temporarily halting their slump.The victory lifted City to fifth place in the Premier League table, but they remain 11 points behind leaders Liverpool , who have two games in hand. For Leicester, the defeat leaves them rooted in the bottom three, adding to their struggles this season.While City's performance was not at their usual level, the win provides a much-needed boost for Guardiola's side as they look to regain their form and mount a challenge for the title. However, with Liverpool's lead and games in hand, City face an uphill battle to defend their crown.","Manchester City beat Leicester City 2-0 on Sunday.

Lautaro back in the goals

Atalanta kept hold of top spot in Serie A on Saturday after escaping Lazio with a 1-1 draw which kept Inter Milan at bay but ended their club-record league winning streak at 11 matches.Marco Brescianini tapped home into an open goal with two minutes remaining to snatch a point from the Stadio Olimpico in Rome, where a passionate crowd thought a big win was coming their way.Instead Atalanta will end a historic year a point ahead of Inter, who have a game in hand, after the champions briefly drew level on points with a 3-0 win earlier at Cagliari .Europa League holders Atalanta will lead the league even if Napoli beat Venezia on Sunday and draw level on 41 points with Gian Piero Gasperini 's side who have a significantly better goal difference than the 2023 champions.Should two teams finish level at the top of Serie A come the end of the season they will face off in a single match to decide the destination of the Scudetto, which Atalanta have never won.""We struggled for long periods in the first half, but we were much better in the second,"" said Atalanta coach Gasperini.""This year has been the best year in Atalanta's history, let's hope we can make 2025 the same.""Atalanta showed great character to battle back from Fisayo Dele-Bashiru's 27th-minute goal which came in an intense opening period from Lazio.The away side were initially blitzed by Lazio, with Marco Carnesecchi making two sensational stops before Matteo Guendouzi curled a great strike off the post in the 11th minute.But as the match wore on, Atalanta, who were without injured star striker Mateo Retegui, grew into the game and deservedly drew level in front of a boisterous and hostile crowd in the Italian capital.Brescianini netted his third goal of the season thanks largely to Ademola Lookman, who made up for earlier missing from yards out by beating Lazio's offside trap, meeting Nicolo Zaniolo's hooked pass and rolling across to his teammate to salvage a precious point.Next up, Atalanta travel to play the Italian Super Cup in Saudi Arabia, where they will face Inter on Thursday.Lautaro Martinez ended an eight-match scoring drought at Cagliari, netting the second in an engaging contest in Sardinia which Inter won with second-half goals from the Argentina striker, Alessandro Bastoni and Hakan Calhanoglu.Inter have won their last five in Italy's top flight, scoring 19 and conceding just once, a burst in form which has re-established Inter as favourites to retain the Scudetto.The only thing missing for Inter were goals from captain Martinez, who hadn't scored since November 3 before he prodded home Nicolo Barella's cross in the 71st minute on Saturday.""The most important thing is that Inter win. If I get a goal too, then that's a bonus,"" said Martinez.""We work hard every day to win trophies and anyone who sets foot on the pitch will give their all for the team. We've just got to keep going and make 2025 like this year.""Inter could have won by an even more convincing margin had captain Martinez not wasted great chances in each half and Cagliari goalkeeper Simone Scuffet not pulled off superb saves to deny Marcus Thuram and Barella.But Martinez did net his seventh goal this season in all competitions and seven minutes later Calhanoglu made absolutely sure of the points from the penalty spot.Cagliari are just inside the relegation zone after a fourth consecutive defeat for Davide Nicola's side, a point behind Verona and Como who both play on Monday.",Atalanta draw 1-1 with Lazio at Stadio Olimpico in Rome.

NEW DELHI: World No. 2-ranked tennis player Alexander Zverev has withdrawn from the United Cup mixed teams tennis tournament due to a biceps strain .This injury comes less than two weeks before the start of the Australian Open , one of the four Grand Slam tournaments in professional tennis .The 27-year-old German had won his opening two singles matches of the season at the United Cup against Brazil's Thiago Monteiro and China's Zheng Zhizhen.However, he was forced to withdraw from his scheduled match against Alexander Shevchenko of Kazakhstan in the quarterfinals of the tournament.Zverev's withdrawal came at a crucial moment when Kazakhstan was leading the tie against Germany 1-0 after Elena Rybakina defeated Laura Siegemund 6-3, 6-1.The organizers announced that Daniel Masur would replace Zverev for the remaining singles match against Kazakhstan.Rybakina's impressive performance at the United Cup helped Kazakhstan secure a spot in the semi-finals of the 18-nation tournament. The 2022 Wimbledon champion showcased her prowess by defeating Laura Siegemund 6-3, 6-1, earning the first point for her team.Despite Zverev's withdrawal due to a bicep strain, Kazakhstan's Shevchenko stepped up and secured a hard-fought victory against Daniel Masur, overcoming challenges like difficulty breathing in the intense heat.Shevchenko's resilience and aggressive play were instrumental in his 6-7 (5/7), 6-2, 6-2 triumph.Despite his impressive ranking and consistent performances, Zverev has yet to win a Grand Slam singles title. He has finished as the runner-up in the 2020 US Open and the 2024 French Open , but the elusive Grand Slam victory has remained out of his grasp.The Australian Open, the first Grand Slam tournament of the year, is set to begin on January 12. Zverev's participation in the tournament may now be in jeopardy due to the biceps strain, as injuries can significantly impact a player's performance and recovery time.Injuries can derail even the most promising careers, and players must carefully manage their health and recovery to maintain their competitive edge.","World No. 2 tennis player Alexander Zverev has withdrawn from the United Cup mixed teams tennis tournament due to a biceps strain.

NEW DELHI: Four-time Grand Slam singles winner Naomi Osaka has made an impressive start to the 2025 season at the Auckland tennis classic . In her second-round match against Julia Grabher, Osaka displayed her resilience and skill, overcoming challenging conditions and a rain delay to secure a 7-5, 6-3 victory.Despite the swirling breeze and the interruption caused by the rain break, Osaka maintained her composure and executed her game plan effectively. Her serve proved to be a formidable weapon, as she won 80% of the points when her first serve landed in play.Osaka's ability to hold her serve throughout the match was a testament to her mental toughness and technical abilities.The first set was a closely contested affair, with neither player able to break serve until the 12th game. Osaka capitalised on the opportunity after the rain delay, breaking Grabher's serve to claim the opening set.In the second set, Osaka's dominance became more apparent as she secured an early break and maintained a comfortable lead until the end.Osaka's performance in Auckland is particularly noteworthy as it marks her second appearance in the quarterfinals of the tournament, having previously reached the same stage in 2017.Her recent collaboration with renowned coach Patrick Mouratoglou , who previously worked with Serena Williams, appears to be paying dividends, as Osaka credited his guidance for her focused approach on the court.Significantly, Osaka showed no signs of the back injury that prematurely ended her 2024 season, moving freely and hitting with power, particularly from her formidable forehand side.Her performance in Auckland serves as a promising indication of her readiness for the upcoming Australian Open , which commences on January 12.With former US Open champion Emma Raducanu and Elise Mertens withdrawing from the Auckland tournament due to injuries, Osaka's path to the title has become more favourable.“She was a really tough opponent for me to play against and I felt I just had to concentrate on myself a lot and try not to be as nervous as I felt,” Osaka said.“I got some great advice from a great coach over there. I just tried to focus on my bullet points and go out swinging if I had to go out. But fortunately, I'm here to play another round.”","Naomi Osaka defeated Julia Grabher 7-5, 6-3 in the second round of the Auckland Open.

She expressed respect for her fellow players but indicated she wouldn't continue playing if she couldn't maintain a certain ranking.“I have a lot of respect for all the players on tour, but the point of my life that I'm at right now, if I'm not above a certain ranking, I don't see myself playing for a while.”She explained that she would prioritize spending time with her daughter if she couldn't achieve her desired level of performance.“I'd rather spend time with my daughter if I'm not where I think I should be and where I feel like I can be.”Osaka's 2024 season saw a 22-17 win-loss record in singles matches.

She acknowledged the difficulty of not achieving her desired results despite her increased efforts.“I worked way harder than I've ever worked before.

People still talk to me about my Iga (Swiatek) match at the French Open (lost 7-6 1-6 7-5). So I'm glad that I was able to give people memories as well.”Osaka also expressed optimism about her performance before her injury in Beijing, her last tournament of 2024, where she was playing against Coco Gauff . She anticipates playing on hard courts again.“Even though I got injured in Beijing, which was my last tournament, I feel pretty optimistic about how that match would have turned out (against Coco Gauff) and I am excited to play on hardcourt again.”Osaka has won the Australian Open twice (2019 and 2021) and the US Open twice (2018 and 2020). She affirmed her continued passion for tennis despite recent setbacks due to injuries.“I've been playing tennis since I was three, and a huge part of that I owe to my parents, but I never really saw my life doing anything else.”Osaka spoke about her lifelong involvement with tennis, attributing much of it to her parents' influence. She realized her deep love for the sport after exploring other possibilities.“Then, when I sat there and had the opportunity to do other things, I realized that I'd rather be playing tennis.”This realization reinforced her commitment to tennis.“So it was kind of one of those realization moments where you feel like you thought you were forced to do something, but in actuality you very much truly loved it.”Osaka's first-round opponent at the ASB Classic will be Lina Glushko of Israel.",Naomi Osaka is scheduled to compete in the ASB Classic in Auckland on Monday.

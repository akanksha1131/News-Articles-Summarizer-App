MULLANPUR:

Rovman Powell Unfiltered: 'Playing in the IPL changed my life'

After bringing up his half-century in the first T20I in Cuttack on Monday evening, Hardik Pandya raised his bat high, looked at the dressing room with a straight face and simply got back to business. The unbeaten 28-ball 59 may have seemed like a par-for-the-course T20 knock from the talented allrounder, but Pandya’s innings offered a timely reminder of exactly what Team India have been missing in white-ball cricket in his absence.Pandya, an inherently flamboyant character, now exudes a sense of calm in a team packed with youngsters high on adrenaline. Coming out to bat on a damp pitch with India struggling at 78/4 in the 12th over against a shrewd South African bowling attack, he did not look flustered.India’s designated T20 hitters — Abhishek Sharma, Suryakumar Yadav and Tilak Varma — had all succumbed to the choke applied by South Africa’s bowlers. Pandya, re turning from a two-month layoff because of a quadricep injury, batted as if he had never gone away.The Indian team management and selectors took a harsh call when they dropped Pandya as a leadership contender after the victorious T20 World Cup campaign in 2024.This was largely due to the frequency of his injuries.Every time he does return after injury, though, Pandy reminds the world what the team has been missing. That the team management had to constantly shuffle its playing XI in ODIs in Pandya’s absence is a case in point. The two ODI series in Australia and against South Africa at home exposed India’s lack of power hitters in the back-end of the innings. Besides, Pandya is also the sixth bowler.“I’ve stood strong. I’ve done a lot of things with grace and that has helped me to become even more confident, back myself and really trust my skillset. I really believe in myself as a player,” Pandya told bcci.tv.Through his career, power and swagger have been part of Pandya’s cricketing identity, but now he has risen above mindless slogging and developed an ability to absorb pressure consistently without compromising the needs of the team. Since the Asia Cup, the middle order hasn’t really been as explosive as required in modern T20. The likes of Suryakumar and Tilak have not really been able to break free in conditions where the ball doesn’t come on to the bat at a consistent pace. Axar Patel ’s promotion up the order has been up for debate for over a year now.Former India wicketkeeper Deep Dasgupta explained the team’s thought process behind sending Pandya after Axar. “India have not been playing on flat pitches. They are likely to play more on pitches that will aid Varun Chakravarthy and Kuldeep Yadav in the T20 World Cup. It’s important for the younger batters to bat with more freedom knowing Pandya is there to steady the innings lower down. That’s the thing about Pandya now. He is the stabiliser in this batting lineup. Coming in after the 12th over is the sweet spot for him,” Dasgupta told TOI.Dasgupta established the point by highlighting how Pandya could bat with a high strike-rate and yet look risk free. “He was hitting straight and with ease. There were no risks taken. Once he came in to bat, he played the situation beautifully and also ensured the run-rate went up. It wasn’t an easy pitch to bat on but he took responsibility. That’s what India have been missing. Pandya is the link between the top-order and the lower middle-order,” he said.Pandya has endured a lot. Every time it looked like his career had found new wing, he would be bogged down by injury or off-field controversies. India will need this strong and calm Pandya to contribute more in white-ball cricket.",Hardik Pandya's unbeaten 59 in the first T20I in Cuttack was a timely reminder of exactly what Team India have been missing in white-ball cricket in his absence. The Indian team management and selectors took a harsh call when they dropped Pandya as a leadership contender after the victorious T20 World Cup campaign in 2024.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125901123,imgsize-41276,width-400,resizemode-4/hardik-pandya.jpg"

Sarpanch and his lads - the strengths of PBKS



What PBKS will look for in the IPL auction



You won't often say this for Punjab Kings (PBKS), but going into the Indian Premier League (IPL) Auction 2026 ahead of the next season, they have one of the most settled squads in the league.The last season's (2025) runner-up have come close to the trophy twice but have been denied to lay their hands on the silverware both times, once by Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) in 2014 and then by Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) last season.After the disastrous 2024 season, PBKS overhauled their squad to come back strongly and had a 58.8 win percentage last year, their third best after the 2014 (70.5%) and 2008 (66.6%) seasons.PBKS have released Glenn Maxwell, Josh Inglis, Aaron Hardie , Kyle Jamieson, Kuldeep Sen, and Praveen Dubey, and have Rs 11.50 crore of purse remaining.As the IPL auction is set to be held in Abu Dhabi on December 16, here's a look at the strengths of PBKS, the minor gaps they need to fill to make their side more formidable, and the players they would like to include in their squad.Among PBKS's biggest strengths is their captain, Shreyas Iyer . Iyer holds the unique record of having led three different IPL teams to the final: Delhi Capitals (DC) in 2020, won the trophy with KKR in 2024, and then PBKS in 2025. With 50 wins in 87 matches and a win percentage of 58.82, Iyer is among the most successful captains in IPL history.PBKS also possess a very strong Indian batting core. Led by Iyer himself, PBKS have in their armoury - Prabhsimran Singh and Priyansh Arya at the top, followed by Iyer, Nehal Wadhera, and Shashank Singh.All five were among the leading run-getters for Punjab last season. While Iyer scored 604 runs at a strike rate of 175.07, Prabhsimran smashed 599 runs at 161.89. Priyansh Arya was the third-highest run getter for PBKS with 545 runs at 182.27, followed by Shashank Singh with 372 runs at 159.66, and Nehal Wadhera with 369 runs at 145.85.Also among their strengths are the bowling options. PBKS will utilise Arshdeep Singh and Marco Jansen with the new ball - together, they took 39 wickets last season while conceding runs at 8.82 and 9.20, respectively.PBKS would hope Vijaykumar Vyshak, who was good in some matches but leaked runs in others, becomes more consistent this season at the death. Last season, Vyshak conceded 12.36 runs per over between overs 12-20. PBKS would expect better from him this season.PBKS also have New Zealand quicks Kyle Jamieson, Lockie Ferguson and Afghanistan all-rounder Azmatullah Omarzai as the pace bowling options in the squad.With Jansen, Stoinis, and Omarzai as more or less fixed overseas players, it would be hard for Jamieson and Ferguson to find a place as the fourth overseas player in the XII.Moreover, PBKS also have Yuzvendra Chahal and Harpreet Brar to trap opposition batters in the web of spin.PBKS have a purse of Rs 11.50 crore and can buy four players, including two overseas slots.Out of the five players PBKS released, one was forced: Josh Inglis, with the Australian wicketkeeper declaring that he won't be available to play most of the season. Apart from being the sixth highest run-getter for Punjab, Inglis was also a backup keeper for Prabhsimran Singh.PBKS have Vishnu Vinod as an India WK option, but in Inglis's absence, Punjab will most likely look for an experienced overseas keeper-batter who can bat in the middle order of their largely inexperienced, but explosive, batting side.Two players PBKS can target to fill that gap are Jonny Bairstow and Kiwi Tim Seifert. Bairstow is someone who has previously played for Punjab (2022 & 2024) and had a decent run. In 22 innings across two seasons, he had scored 551 runs, including a century.The other area PBKS may look towards is adding a spinner or two, likely a finger spinner, into their squad as a backup option for Harpreet Brar. Last season (2025), Maxwell did a decent job with the ball in hand, conceding runs at just 8.46, but since Punjab has released him, they will be on the hunt for a backup spinner or spin all-rounder.If PBKS look overseas, Australian Cooper Connolly could be an option, who has 13 wickets at an economy of 7.73 and has scored 646 runs at a strike rate of 132.92 in 35 T20s.Punjab Kings head into the auction without the pressure of rebuilding. The core of the squad is in place, and the gaps are limited and clear. With Rs 11.50 crore available and only a few roles to address, the task is about filling those minor gaps rather than bidding aggressively. A middle-order wicketkeeper-batter and a spin backup remain the main areas to cover. How well they fill these small gaps may determine whether last season’s run to the final becomes a platform for another title push or not.","Punjab Kings (PBKS) have one of the most settled squads in the league.

NEW DELHI: Indian women's cricket team vice-captain and star batter Smriti Mandhana has returned to what does best, training in nets for upcoming matches for the national team, following the announcement of her wedding cancellation with music composer Palash Muchhal . She was seen practising at what appeared to be a private facility.Smriti's brother Shravan Mandhana shared a photo on social media platform - Instagram - showing Smriti in full cricket gear, facing throwdowns in the nets. The image, accompanied by heart emojis, quickly gained attention on social media.Smriti, who played a crucial role in India's Women's ODI World Cup 2025 victory, is scheduled to return to competitive cricket in a five-match T20I series against Sri Lanka this month. The series will be played from December 21 to 30 in Visakhapatnam and Thiruvananthapuram.The matches will serve as preparation for next year's T20 World Cup. Smriti will also captain Royal Challengers Bengaluru in the Women's Premier League, beginning January 9 in Navi Mumbai.Addressing the wedding cancellation on Instagram, Mandhana wrote: ""I need to clarify that the wedding is called off.""She requested privacy for both families and emphasised her continued commitment to cricket, stating that representing India remains her highest priority.Palash Muchhal also made a public statement, writing that he had decided to ""move on"" from the relationship, describing the period as one of the most difficult phases of his life.Muchhal appealed against the ""baseless rumours"" circulating about their relationship and warned of legal action against the spreaders of false or defamatory content.The wedding was initially planned for November 23 in Sangli, Maharashtra, but was postponed due to health emergencies. Mandhana's father was hospitalised with cardiac issues on the wedding morning, and reports indicated Muchhal was also hospitalised.The postponement initially sparked hopes of rescheduling, but no new date was announced.

Second: A cryptic Instagram post goes viral

Third: A subtle Instagram bio change sparks chatter

NEW DELHI: Smriti Mandhana has been in the spotlight ever since she announced that her wedding with composer Palash Muchhal had been called off. In the days following the confirmation, the India vice-captain has shared — directly and indirectly — three notable updates that have caught the attention of fans and sparked fresh online conversation.Just a day after issuing her statement about the cancelled wedding, Smriti Mandhana was back on the field. A photo shared by her brother, Shravan Mandhana, showed the star batter in full training mode — padded up, facing throwdowns, and wearing her training jersey at what appeared to be a private facility. Heart emojis accompanied the picture, which quickly went viral across social media.Many fans praised Mandhana for her resilience and dedication, especially at a time when she is coping with a difficult personal phase. The left-hander is set to return to competitive cricket later this month during India’s five-match T20I series against Sri Lanka from December 21 to 30.Days after confirming the breakup, Mandhana posted a promotional picture on Instagram with the caption, “For me, calm isn’t silence — it’s control.”The post crossed eight lakh likes within hours, fuelling speculation once again regarding the circumstances behind the separation. Though the caption was part of a paid smartphone campaign, fans linked it to her personal situation, interpreting it as a message of strength and self-assurance.Mandhana also made headlines after removing the evil-eye emoji from her Instagram bio — a tiny update that nevertheless led to widespread speculation. With reports already circulating about the wedding being called off, the change triggered fresh discussions among fans trying to decipher its meaning.These developments came after Mandhana finally broke her silence, requesting privacy and urging everyone to stop the speculation surrounding her personal life.She clarified that the wedding had been officially called off and emphasised that her focus remains “firmly on cricket” as India enters a packed international season.""I need to clarify that the wedding is called off. I would like to close this matter here and implore all of you to do the same,"" she wrote.""Over the past few weeks there has been plenty of speculation around my life and I feel it is important for me to speak out at this time,"" she said in an Instagram post.Calling herself a ""very private person"", Mandhana said the need to set the record straight compelled her to speak.She requested fans and the public to ""respect the privacy of both families"" and allow them the ""space to process and move on"".Mandhana, who is preparing for India's upcoming international season, said her focus remains firmly on cricket.""I believe there is a higher purpose driving us all and for me that has always been representing my country at the highest level. I hope to continue to play and win trophies for India for as long as possible,"" she said.Soon after Mandhana's post, Palash Muchhal issued his own statement, confirming that he had ""decided to move on"" and expressing anguish over what he described as baseless online chatter.""I have decided to move on in my life and step back from my personal relationship. It's been very difficult for me to see people react so easily on baseless rumours about something which has been most sacred to me.""It's the most difficult phase of my life and I will deal with it gracefully holding on to my beliefs,"" he wrote.He urged the public to reflect before amplifying unverified claims.""I truly hope we, as a society, learn to pause before judging someone based on unverified gossip, whose sources are never identified. Our words can wound in ways we may never understand,"" he added.Muchhal also said his team would take legal action against those spreading defamatory content.""My team will be taking strict legal action against those spreading false and defamatory content,"" he said, thanking those who had supported him with ""kindness"" during this period.The development comes days after singer Palak Muchhal, sister of Palash, spoke on the issue.""I think the families have been through a very tough time... we would like to spread positivity as much as we can. We are also trying to stay strong,"" she had said.Both statements come against the backdrop of intensified social media discussions and unverified reports, prompting public figures to step in to curb conjecture.Mandhana, 28, has been a central figure in Indian women's cricket for nearly a decade, and her presence in the batting line-up has been crucial across formats. With India set for a busy 2026 calendar, the left-hander reiterated that her professional commitments remain her priority.""Thank you for all your support. It's time to move forward,"" her note concluded.","Smriti Mandhana returns to training a day after confirming her wedding is off.

Poll Is Hardik Pandya crucial for India's success in the World Cup? Definitely Somewhat Not really

NEW DELHI: India's new T20I template may be built on aggression, but former South Africa fast-bowling legend Dale Steyn believes its real foundation lies in Suryakumar Yadav 's secure and flexible captaincy, one that makes players feel backed enough to adapt for the team's needs.Speaking on JioStar, Steyn said a captain who isn't insecure about his spot or authority breeds a dressing room where players feel encouraged to put the team first.“You're not threatened by your spot or by the captaincy. You put the team first and ask: 'What's best for the individual? What's best for the team?'” Steyn said.Calling Surya “secure, welcoming, and willing to adjust for the greater good”, Steyn highlighted how the skipper's willingness to move between No. 3 and No. 4 shows leadership through action, not commands.“If he tells someone, 'You can't bat at three today, I need you at six,' the batter understands because the captain has backed him before. That flexibility brings out the best in your players,” Steyn added.The sentiment aligns with head coach Gautam Gambhir 's philosophy of dynamic, situation-based roles rather than fixed batting slots, a shift team India has experimented with since the start of the series in South Africa.Complementing India's evolving approach is the comeback of Hardik Pandya . Former India cricketer Robin Uthappa said the all-rounder's return makes India instantly more dangerous, adding balance that India rarely has.Hardik smashed a 28-ball 59 and dismissed David Miller in the series opener.“He is an out-and-out match-winner, integral to India's success at the World Cup. He brings balance no one else offers,” Uthappa said, noting India seldom fields two pace-bowling all-rounders, with Shivam Dube alongside Hardik.","Dale Steyn believes Suryakumar Yadav's captaincy is key to India's new T20I template.

Poll What do you think contributed most to India's victory in the first T20I? Pandya's batting Bowling attack South Africa's poor performance

NEW DELHI: Hardik Pandya delivered a statement innings under pressure and a message of intent for the season ahead, smashing an unbeaten 59 off just 28 balls to fire India to a commanding 101-run win over South Africa in the first T20I at Cuttack on Tuesday. Named Player of the Match, Pandya walked in when India were wobbling, assessed a spicy surface shrewdly, and counterattacked with brute precision to lift India to 175/6 — a total that proved far beyond the visitors, who folded for 74 in 12.3 overs.The all-rounder described the knock as a blend of instinct and composure. “I had to back my shots… the wicket had a bit of spice. You had to be a little gutsy. It was more about timing the ball, not trying to break the ball,” Pandya said, delighted with how he paced the innings.His blitz also came as a reward for relentless work on his conditioning. Away from home, away from distractions, the 32-year-old spent nearly two months grinding at the National Cricket Academy to regain peak fitness. “These last 50 days, being away from your loved ones, spending time at the NCA, making sure everything is covered… it's very satisfying when you come here and the results follow,” he reflected.But if there was one line that defined his night, it was his declaration of purpose. “It doesn't matter what Hardik Pandya wants; it matters what India wants. I've always tried to put my team first. That's my biggest USP,” he said, stressing that roles don't dictate his motivation — only contributions do.Pandya's calculated assault also included taking on Keshav Maharaj at a key stage. “He took a chance and I took a chance. Mine was more calculated on that track… it gave us rhythm and momentum,” he explained.India's total was more than enough, as Jasprit Bumrah, Arshdeep Singh, Varun Chakravarthy and Axar Patel all picked two wickets each, dismantling South Africa's chase with ruthless precision.","India beat South Africa by 101 runs in the first T20I at Cuttack.

Poll What do you think about the trend of having one captain across all formats? It's a great idea for consistency. It's not necessary; different formats need different leaders. It depends on the player's experience.

NEW DELHI: With Shubman Gill 's promotion as India's T20I vice-captain, the transition towards a single all-format leadership now appears inevitable. Gill already leads India in Tests and ODIs, and is widely expected to replace Suryakumar Yadav as T20I captain after next year's World Cup. In doing so, the BCCI would return to its traditional preference for one captain across formats.For former BCCI selector Salil Ankola, the move has been years in the making. He revealed that Gill's leadership future was identified as early as 2023, the year the young opener stamped his authority on international cricket.“We always thought Gill would become the captain. We had considered him for the role as early as 2023, believing he would take the reins into his hands,” Ankola said on Vicky Lalwani's YouTube channel. He explained the selector's consensus reached beyond just the coach and captain. “Selectors do take suggestions — not only from the coach and captain but also from other senior players. They also felt he was the right guy, even those who retired earlier. ”Gill's batting boom in 2023 made the choice straightforward. He racked up centuries and double tons across formats and, despite missing two matches at the ODI World Cup due to dengue, scored over 350 runs in nine innings. That made the selectors confident he would seamlessly take over when Rohit Sharma stepped down, a belief reinforced when Gill excelled as Test captain in England.Ankola said the performance validated the decision: “Everyone felt it, and he proved it in England. What a series he had! Under such pressure, if he scores 750 runs in England, that shows his mental capacity.” He also warned against knee-jerk opinions. “People will say someone else should have been captain, or bring someone back. Humans are very unsatisfied souls. Whatever good you do, they will find something bad in it. ”",Shubman Gill is expected to replace Suryakumar Yadav as T20I captain after next year's World Cup.

Poll Do you agree with Shaun Pollock's comparison of Shubman Gill to Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli? Yes, he is among the best now No, it's too early to compare I need to see more performances I disagree with this comparison

NEW DELHI: In Cuttack on Tuesday, Sanju Samson ’s name did not appear on the playing XI list for India against South Africa in the first T20I. For the fourth time in India’s last six T20Is, the wicketkeeper-batter watched from the sidelines as Jitesh Sharma took his place. The selection call reopened a debate that began when the BCCI unveiled their ‘ Shubman Gill plan’ during the Asia Cup — a move that shifted Samson from his successful opening role into the middle order for just five innings before he was dropped for a specialist finisher.This time, the discussion came with a stinging dose of praise — not for Samson, but for the man whose rise has pushed him out. Former South Africa great Shaun Pollock felt the decision reflected India’s elevation of Gill into a rare bracket.“Yes, Sanju got a raw deal… I suppose you kind of need to look at Shubman Gill from a different perspective now. I think he is almost being elevated to the likes of Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli ,” Pollock told Cricbuzz. He pointed to how stalwarts work their way back into a side when available. “When they came back into teams, where did they go? They went back into their position. It wasn’t a case of shifting them down.”Pollock added that Gill’s recent Test exploits in England only strengthened his status, making it nearly impossible to move him from the top. “I think what he’s shown, even in that Test series in England, is that he’s the number one, isn’t he, batting-wise?… It’s just team dynamics. When Shubman comes back… I think he’s the best player, so he goes to the top.”He also highlighted Gill’s chemistry with Abhishek Sharma. “They know each other’s game really well and bounce off each other nicely.”Joining the panel, former Kolkata Knight Riders team director Joy Bhattacharjya delivered a blunt conclusion about Samson’s selection. “If you’re not going to bat Sanju up the order, then keeping him really doesn’t make sense… If you’ve fixed that spot and Shubman has taken it, then your keeper has to be a finisher, which is Jitesh.” He suggested India instead pick another finisher-keeper like Rishabh Pant . “There’s no point… rather than have Sanju batting out of position.”Samson’s overall record only deepens the dilemma.

Unsustainable prices

All eggs in one basket

What next?

The development around JioStar’s ultimatum to the International Cricket Council (ICC) that it cannot service the remaining two years of the media rights contract due to “deep financial losses” conveys many things, but certainly not them exiting the deal.Like conjoined twins, the federation and the broadcaster have no choice but to follow the unique and challenging reality of their existence — they can neither afford to live with each other nor live without each other.On one hand, cricket has only one major broadcaster in Jio Star, and on the other, cricket is JioStar’s only recourse if they need to keep their subscription game going. So, nobody’s going anywhere.In 2023, when Disney India bought the ICC media rights at $3.04 billion, there were a total of 179 matches for the taking over the four-year cycle. Technically speaking, Disney India bid Rs 138.7 crore per game.The cost of a single IPL game at today’s global broadcast rights value is Rs 114 crore, which JioStar has been finding it difficult to sustain.Here, we’re talking about a tournament played at India prime time, involving top Indian and global cricketers, and is perched right up there among the global sports properties.Then, how exactly at Rs 138 crore per game will the broadcaster ever be able to sustain the value of ICC cricket rights? For the record, of the 179 matches, India will play only 28 games plus knockouts, if they qualify.In 2024, when Jio was taking over Disney India, did they not know the repercussions of the deal? They did, and that is the only reason why Disney exited the India market at a discounted value.Today, having acquired those rights at a discount, Jio expects the ICC to further renegotiate, only because they know there’s no other broadcaster in the fray.Today, if JioStar decides to stay away from cricket rights, cricket federations – read ICC, IPL, BCCI – simply do not have a Plan B. In fact, their Plan B will be to renegotiate and come back to Plan A, which is to stick with JioStar at a discounted price.It is precisely this lack of choice that leaves the members of the ICC with no other option but to be at the mercy of the current broadcaster. The ICC has two major events coming up in 2026 and 2027 — the men’s T20 World Cup, followed by the men’s 50-over World Cup.It is to be waited and seen if the ICC members will sit across the table with JioStar ahead of these events to guarantee them a better pricing in the next rights cycle to allow the cricketing caravan to keep moving.That is clearly the only end game to this whole exercise.The ruckus is not lost on the IPL franchises. In fact, ever since the mega merger between Jio and Disney happened, they had seen this coming.When a brand valuation and consultancy firm like Brand Finance comes out with a report that says IPL’s 2025 brand value is down by 20% — from $12b to $9.6b — one can pin it down to the broadcast rights, IPL’s biggest revenue source.In 2022, multiple bidders had fought tooth and nail to grab IPL rights, and it brought in a cash influx of Rs 48,300 cr.In 2026-27, only two broad casters will be in the fray (and one of them only for TV). What kind of a hike can the industry expect? The IPL rights stood at a billion in 2008, got sold for $2.6b in 2017 and got resold for $6.5b in 2022.While franchises are wondering what next, the industry is speculating a five to 10% hike, no more.That’s the long and short of the media rights story.","JioStar says it cannot service the remaining two years of the media rights contract due to ‘deep financial losses’ The cost of a single IPL game at today’s global broadcast rights value is Rs 114 crore, which JioStar has been finding it difficult to sustain.

NEW DELHI: Arshdeep Singh opened up about his mindset and approach with the new ball during India’s win over South Africa in the first T20I at the Barabati Stadium, explaining that his focus was on hitting the seam and trying to ""get as much purchase off the wicket. ""After being asked to bat first, India put up 175/6, led by Hardik Pandya ’s unbeaten 59, before the bowlers took control. Arshdeep delivered early breakthroughs in the powerplay, removing Quinton de Kock for a duck in the opening over and dismissing Tristan Stubbs in the third.The left-arm pacer struck once in each of the two overs he bowled, ending with figures of 2-14. Speaking about his thought process while defending the total, Arshdeep said, “The thought process is simple: just go there and try to use as much help as there is in the wicket and try to get the team early wickets. I feel like if you were hitting the seam hard, there was something in the wicket, either it was bouncing more or seaming in or out.""The idea was to just hit the seam as hard as possible and get as much purchase off the wicket. I bowled full, got a wicket. Then bowled full, went for a four. Then I knew I had to bowl short, got a wicket on that. Again bowled full, went for a four. So yeah, I was getting quick reminders there.”During the match, Jasprit Bumrah dismissed Dewald Brevis to complete 100 T20I wickets, becoming only the second Indian bowler after Arshdeep to reach the milestone.Asked what he told the Mumbai Indians pacer upon the achievement, the 26-year-old said, “Yeah, I just told him ‘Welcome.’ Congratulated him and told him, ‘Welcome to the club.’”Arshdeep also spoke about how economical spells from the bowlers help ease the captain’s decision-making. “It makes life very easy for the captain as well. They can play around with the bowling combinations, whenever he wants Jassi (Bumrah) bhai to bowl three in the powerplay or me to bowl three in the powerplay. We just try to give him as much flexibility as possible and we’re enjoying each other’s company. I mean, I’m just trying to enjoy the present and just have fun. It’s very rare you get to play on these kinds of wickets where there’s seam and swing on offer. So I just try to stay patient, not get too excited seeing help in the wicket, stay disciplined and enjoy whatever is there.”","Arshdeep Singh says his focus was on hitting the seam and trying to ""get as much purchase off the wicket"" The left-arm pacer struck once in each of the two overs he bowled, ending with figures of 2-14.

Rovman Powell Unfiltered: 'Playing in the IPL changed my life'

A genuine seam-bowling all-rounder is like a rare species in India, and Hardik Pandya is truly so.As India eased to a 101-run win over South Africa in the T20I series opener here on Tuesday, the Baroda man underlined his importance in the shortest-format setup once more with a match-winning show that raised his stakes further ahead of T20 World Cup in Feb-Mar next year.Coming to bat at No. 6 after spin-bowling all-rounder Axar Patel, Pandya unleashed his power-hitting self to counter the Proteas bowling which had reduced India to 78 for four in the 12th over.With his teammates wobbling in front of a four-pronged South Africa pace attack, Pandya’s breezy 28-ball unbeaten 59 turned the game on its head and helped India to a formidable total of 175 for six, which at one point looked a distant dream.Starting off with two huge sixes — off Keshav Maharaj — in the first four balls he faced, Pandya spared no one.Tearaway pacer Anrich Nortje , who made a comeback after 16 months and consistently bowled at 145kmph-plus at the Barabati, was hit for three fours and a clever six that flew over the third-man boundary as Pandya reached his seventh fifty in T20Is. Marco Jansen, Lutho Sipamla , and Donovan Ferreira also bore the brunt.“I had to trust my shots, it needed a bit of courage,” Pandya said after winning the Player of the Match award on return.“It was timing, not trying to break the ball. I was very happy with how I batted. It’s very satisfying that when you come here, the result comes like this.”South Africa batting coach Ashwell Prince also reflected on the same lines.“He has come back from an injury. He has come back looking sharp. He batted his time. He picked the right moments to attack with a spin on initially. There wasn’t a lot of spin on offer, so he got a couple of early sixes away,” the former South Africa captain said at the post-match press conference on Tuesday.“Against the seamers towards the end, he put the pressure on them. He struck the ball as screamy as ever so a lot of credit has to go to him.”Elaborating further on Pandya’s clarity of thought, Prince said the Indian had no half measures.“He is a six hitter, but he is also calm. I think identifying the right balls to attack, that comes with a lot of experience. As soon as the ball was in his areas, that he is very strong at, he put a good swing on it, no half measures,” he said before adding, “I think most of the time when Hardik hits it, he is not tentative. There is clarity in his thinking and there is clarity in his execution. It was an outstanding innings.”Dismissing any concern over his fitness while bowling, Pandya struck with the very first ball on his international return after playing the Asia Cup Super 4 match against Sri Lanka last on Sept 26. Pandya gave 16 runs in the two overs he bowled for the wicket of David Miller.“The last six, seven months have been really amazing from my fitness standpoint. I don’t make a big deal about the hard work which goes behind. But at the same point in time, these last 50 days, being away from your loved ones, spending time in NCA (now BCCI Centre of Excellence, Bengaluru), you know, making sure that all these things are covered,” he stated at the post-match presentation.On match eve, captain Suryakumar Yadav had spoken about the flexibility Pandya brings to the playing eleven and the man of the moment seconds his skipper on that front, too.Coming in as the first change after Jasprit Bumrah and Arshdeep Singh shared the new ball on Tuesday, Pandya, who opened the bowling during Asia Cup, said it’s always about how he could step up for the team when needed.“As a cricketer, I don’t think I have ever been fussy about what roles I have in the game. I have always been very motivated to ensure that it does not matter what Hardik Pandya wants; it matters what India wants. Whenever I get opportunities, I come and try to do my best. Some days are good, some days are not. But at the same point, it's the mindset that helps me,” he said with a sense of calmness, much like his muted celebration after reaching his 50 on Tuesday.“And I think it’s been throughout my career. I have always tried to put my team, the nation, and the team I have played for first. And I think that’s my biggest USP,” he signed off, with a promise to soar higher.",India beat South Africa by 101 runs in T20I series opener in Bengaluru.

Phil Oliver on the Desert Vipers & ILT20’s Rise, New Talent & the UAE’s Cricket Vision

Shubman Gill’s ascendancy as vice-captain in T20Is before Asia Cup in Sept changed many dynamics in the Indian team.And as the Punjab batter made a comeback into the side after missing one Test and three ODIs due to a neck injury suffered during the first Test against South Africa at Eden Gardens, wicketkeeper-batter Sanju Samson had to sit out of the first T20I here on Tuesday.While Samson’s usual opening slot was taken up by the man in possession, Gill, the other keeper-batter in the squad, Jitesh Sharma , was once again preferred over Samson as a middle-lower order bat more suited to play the finisher’s role.Playing in the last three T20Is of the five-game series against Australia Down Under in Nov and now the first game against South Africa here, it certainly looks like Jitesh has the backing of the team management going forward.So, Samson, India’s leading run scorer in T20Is last year with 436 runs and three tons to his credit from 13 games, had to warm the bench.Forging a potent opening pair with Abhishek Sharma, Samson’s strike rate was second best to none other than the explosive Punjab southpaw. Despite consistently performing atop the order, Samson’s stake has sadly taken a nosedive in the management’s current action plan going into the World Cup in two months’ time.However, with nine games left before the marquee event on home soil, Jitesh, who won the IPL trophy with Royal Challengers Bengaluru last season, believes it’s a healthy competition with Samson that helps him bring the A game.“I am very grateful that he (Samson) is in the team and I’m under him. Frankly speaking, he is like an elder brother to me. I think because of healthy competition, your talent comes out. I think it’s good for the team also. There is so much talent in this Indian team. You can feel that Sanju bhaiya is out and I’m playing,” said Jitesh at the post-match press conference.“He is a great player. If you have to compete against him and play shoulder to shoulder, then I have to bring my A-game. We are like brothers. We share lots of experiences with each other. He helps me a lot whenever I do ’keeping or batting,” he added.Coming at No. 7 or lower depends on the match situation and Jitesh is clear about his role.“For sure there is a role clarity as to whether I will bat in the middle or lower down the order. Whatever opportunity I get, I will try to control it as much as I can. I have full clarity from the management as to what my role will be and what expectations I have and I am enjoying that,” said the Maharashtra player who remained not out on 10 from five balls with a six on Tuesday and shared a 38-run unbroken stand with Hardik Pandya.“I have been doing the role of a finisher in IPL too, and for the last two-three series. That’s my bread and butter. In practice, I play with scenarios in mind and how can I be in the present and apply my skill and do the maximum I can do,” he further added.",Jitesh Sharma was preferred over Sanju Samson as a middle-lower order batsman.

Gautam Gambhir Press Conference: Team India head coach heaves fire after 2-1 ODI series win over SA

The BCCI ’s long-term leadership plans are slowly falling into place, and Shubman Gill now sits at the centre of it. With Gill recently appointed India’s T20I vice-captain, his elevation as the country’s all-format skipper is viewed as a matter of when, not if. Already leading the Test and ODI sides, Gill is expected to take over the T20I captaincy from Suryakumar Yadav after next year’s T20 World Cup, aligning with the board’s long-standing preference for a single captain across formats — a model followed by teams like Australia and England.India’s approach to captaincy stability has often been clear. When Rohit Sharma succeeded Virat Kohli as captain, his age meant his tenure would not be a long-term one. But Gill, still in his twenties and already a proven leader, fits the bill for a sustained run. His first Test series as captain showcased exactly why: he guided India to a 2-2 draw in the Anderson–Tendulkar Trophy and stood tall in tough conditions.What may surprise many, though, is that Gill’s rise to the role was planned years ago. Former BCCI selector Salil Ankola revealed that as early as 2023, the board had identified Gill as a future captaincy option. That was the year Gill exploded into world cricket, reeling off centuries and double hundreds with ease, and despite missing two World Cup matches due to dengue, piling up more than 350 runs in nine outings. According to Ankola, the selectors, senior players and team management all believed Gill would eventually take charge once Rohit stepped aside.“We always knew Gill would lead India one day. He was on our radar for the captaincy back in 2023,” Ankola said on Vicky Lalwani’s YouTube channel. “Everyone — from the coach and captain to former players — felt he was the right choice.”Once Rohit retired from Test cricket, the succession became straightforward. Gill not only took the role but excelled immediately, hammering 756 runs in England at an average of 75.40 and registering four centuries in one of the finest overseas tours by an Indian captain in years. India’s struggles in the home series against South Africa during his absence further underlined how crucial he has already become — both as a run-getter and a leader.Ankola said Gill’s performance under pressure speaks volumes. “If someone can score 750 runs in England in those conditions, that tells you all you need to know about their mental strength,” he added. He also noted that public criticism is inevitable, no matter who is chosen. “People always think they know more. Even if you do great things, they will find faults.”With Gill’s trajectory continuing upward, Indian cricket now appears to have its next long-term leader firmly in place — one the selectors had earmarked long before the rest of the world noticed.","Shubman Gill is expected to take over the T20I captaincy from Suryakumar Yadav after next year’s T20 World Cup.

Australian wicketkeeper-batter Alex Carey said England’s mid-series break in Noosa could help them, but cautioned Australia against relaxing despite the 2-0 lead in the Ashes. Carey said memories of the 2023 Ashes in England, when Australia were unable to win the series after leading 2-0, would keep his side alert.England reached Noosa, a resort town on the Queensland coast, on Tuesday for a four-night break. They are scheduled to train three times in Adelaide before the third Test.""I think it'd be a nice holiday. It's a pretty big series, with lots of time between games. For the Australian cricket team, we get to go home for a few days and be with families, so touring parties have got to find time to fill in those little windows,"" news agency ANI reported Carey as saying, citing ESPNcricinfo.“We know England are a very good team. We also understand we were in a position like this a couple of years ago in England. We weren't able to win that series, but we were good enough to retain the Ashes. We're really excited for the opportunity we've got, but we understand we've got to keep playing good cricket,"" he added.Carey said it was England’s call how they used the break and felt stepping away from the game could help players reset.He said the Ashes demands balance and players cannot stay focused on cricket every day.""I'm not sure you need to do it [but] it's totally up to the touring groups to find ways to take your mind off cricket for a little bit. The Ashes is very hotly contested. You don't want to be thinking of cricket every single day of the tour. If you do have a little break, it's probably not a bad time to refresh the batteries,"" Carey said.England’s attacking batting approach did not work in the first two Tests. They suffered a two-day defeat in Perth in the opening Test, with Travis Head playing a key role. In the second Test, Joe Root scored a century, while Zak Crawley and captain Ben Stokes spent time at the crease.After conceding a 177-run first-innings lead with a total of 511, England could not recover. Apart from a 96-run partnership between Stokes and Will Jacks, they were bowled out for 241 in the third innings, leaving Australia a target of 65, which they chased comfortably.Australia have also received a boost ahead of the third Test, with captain Pat Cummins set to return in Adelaide after recovering from a back injury.

Smriti Mandhana's Close Friend, Radha Unfollows Palash Muchhal Amid Cheating Controversy!

NEW DELHI: India's batting sensation and World Cup-winning vice-captain Smriti Mandhana says one truth has become clearer to her than anything else over the past 12 years — there is nothing she cares about more deeply than the game of cricket.India’s most accomplished left-handed batter in women's cricket looked back on her journey, from her international debut in 2013 to helping India lift the ICC ODI World Cup last month, while speaking at the Amazon Smbhav Summit on Wednesday. Mandhana spoke openly about what fuels her commitment each day. “I don’t think there is anything I love more than cricket. Putting on the India jersey is the biggest motivation. No matter what you’re going through, that one thought helps you block everything out,” she said.Even as a child, she knew exactly what she wanted. “The obsession with batting was always there. People around me didn’t really get it, but in my head I wanted only one thing — to be known as a world champion.”She described the World Cup win as the result of years of hard work and disappointment.“This trophy was the outcome of everything we’ve been fighting for. I’ve played for more than a decade, and so many times things didn’t fall into place.Before the final, we pictured that moment over and over again. When it finally appeared on the screen, it genuinely gave us goosebumps. It was emotional in every way.”The occasion was even more overwhelming with legends Mithali Raj and Jhulan Goswami watching from the stands. “We desperately wanted to win it for them too. Seeing tears in their eyes felt like the whole of women’s cricket had achieved something.

Former Australia spinner Steve O’Keefe has urged England to stay committed to head coach Brendon McCullum despite growing criticism after back-to-back defeats in the ongoing Ashes series.England have slipped 0–2 behind after losses in Perth and Brisbane, with their attacking philosophy facing intense questioning. The team’s refusal to adjust tactics, along with McCullum’s controversial remarks about over-training after the Brisbane defeat, has only added to the scrutiny. Many former players and pundits have suggested that a change in leadership may now be necessary.O’Keefe, though, believes England should remain patient with McCullum, highlighting the dramatic shift he brought to the side when he took charge in 2022. Speaking on SEN Radio, he said England’s progress under the former New Zealand captain cannot be ignored.“If you remove the emotion and look at the numbers, he should stay. Under Joe Root and Chris Silverwood, England won just one of their last 17 Tests. With McCullum, they’re winning at around 58 percent. And historically, no England side has travelled well in Australia since 2010–11. A lot of people think he won’t survive this, but I’d stick with him,” O’Keefe said.McCullum’s contract runs until the end of the 2027 season, which includes the next Ashes series in England. O’Keefe added that while the head coach has brought a fresh, fearless style to the team, he now needs to absorb the lessons from this tour and be open to tactical shifts.“He’s introduced a bold mindset, but change is needed. He has to adapt, listen more, and correct what’s clearly not working. A century of Test cricket shows you can’t keep repeating the same approach when you’re being dominated,” O’Keefe noted.He also criticised England’s preparation, pointing out that their training-to-match balance has been far from ideal. “Saying the team is over-trained makes no sense when they aren’t playing tour matches. They’ve had 11 training days and six days of Test cricket. That has to stop.”The Ashes now move to Adelaide, where the third Test begins on 17 December, followed by matches at the Melbourne Cricket Ground and Sydney Cricket Ground.",Former Australia spinner Steve O’Keefe has urged England to stay committed to head coach Brendon McCullum.

IPL Auction Preview: KKR eye a big rebuild with the largest purse,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/ipl/top-stories/ipl-auction-preview-kkr-eye-a-big-rebuild-with-the-largest-purse/articleshow/125891678.cms,"Kolkata Knight Riders (Photo by Prakash Singh/Getty Images)

KKR IPL 2026 trades, retentions, releases, squad update: Are they missing Gambhir?



KKR’s retained a trimmed core



Biggest question: Who will lead them?



Identifying the opening pair



No wicketkeepers



Overseas pacers





Overseas all-rounders





Conclusion

Kolkata Knight Riders, the three-time IPL champions who tasted success as recently as 2024 under captain Shreyas Iyer and mentor Gautam Gambhir, found themselves slipping into an underwhelming campaign in 2025. The defending champions finished eighth, a fall few saw coming.KKR have not tip-toed into the IPL 2026 cycle. They have ripped up their old blueprint and arrived with the largest purse in the room. Andre Russell, a cricketer virtually synonymous with KKR for a decade, was released in a move that stunned the league. Venkatesh Iyer , signed for a staggering Rs 23.75 crore at the mega auction, has also been let go. Shortly after, Russell announced his retirement from the IPL and moved into the franchise as a Power Coach. On top of that, KKR have offloaded all their frontline wicketkeepers while choosing to retain a much smaller core.They enter the IPL auction with a Rs 64.30 crore purse, the highest among all ten teams. The irony is that a massive purse at a mini auction rarely guarantees success. The supply of top-tier players is usually thin, and the inflated competition for a handful of names can distort planning. KKR’s unusually large budget also reflects how much they misread the previous mega auction.Strong mega-auction squads typically walk into mini auctions with much lesser purse and a settled group. KKR, instead, walk in with both uncertainty and flexibility.It leaves them in a curious but compelling position. How much of their best eleven is already in place, and how much must be constructed from scratch on December 16?The Knight Riders enter the December mini auction with 12 retained players and 13 slots available.Retained players:Batters: Ajinkya Rahane , Rinku Singh, Angkrish Raghuvanshi, Manish PandeyAll rounders: Sunil Narine , Rovman Powell, Ramandeep Singh, Anukul RoyBowlers: Varun Chakaravarthy, Harshit Rana, Umran Malik, Vaibhav AroraKKR also possess one of the strongest spin partnerships in the league through Sunil Narine and Varun Chakaravarthy. This is the one department they need not interfere with. All they require are capable backups. Wanindu Hasaranga or Maheesh Theekshana would be ideal support acts behind Narine should they choose to invest.Before turning to their opening combination, KKR must resolve the captaincy question. Ajinkya Rahane led them in 2025 and finished as their highest run getter. If Rahane is entrusted with the role again, the logical progression is straightforward – he must open.Rahane’s 2025 season was split cleanly into two halves. He scored 390 runs at an average of 35.45 and a strike rate of 147.73, but those numbers were heavily powered by his performance in the Powerplay. In the first six overs he was exceptional, scoring 238 runs at a strike rate of 187 and an average of 119. Once the field spread, his returns dropped sharply.Outside the powerplay Rahane scored 152 runs off 137 balls in 10 innings with nine dismissals. His average was 16.9, his strike rate 110.9, and his highest score 28. He hit only eight fours and five sixes while recording a dot-ball percentage of 33.6. These numbers highlight that his game is most effective against the new ball. His recent SMAT returns reinforce that point: 289 runs in six innings at an average of 57.80 and a strike rate of 158 while opening for Mumbai.If he is captain, he must open. Anything else reduces his impact drastically.One of the major foundations of KKR’s 2024 title run was their opening combination. Sunil Narine and Phil Salt consistently provided explosive starts. In 2025 the script flipped. De Kock and Gurbaz could not find rhythm, and Narine endured one of his leanest seasons with the bat, failing to cross fifty.Rahane’s repeated early arrivals at number three saw him dominating the powerplay, but that only reinforces the broader point. If KKR intend to maximise Rahane, he should be one of their openers. Narine should not return to the top of the order. His batting renaissance under Gambhir’s mentorship peaked in 2024 and did not resurface this year. That chapter should now be closed.KKR are without a single domestic wicketkeeper. Their reliance on overseas options has not paid off. De Kock managed 152 runs in 8 innings at 21.71 and 129.91, while Gurbaz produced 74 runs in 5 matches at 18.50 and 139.This mini auction does not offer a deep pool of wicketkeepers, but it does offer some intriguing options. Jonny Bairstow is available after his stint as Will Jacks’ replacement at MI. Finn Allen is another explosive choice, capable of doubling as an opener. Jamie Smith, the young English keeper-batter, offers long-term value.KKR won IPL 2024 on the back of a strong pace gamble that paid off spectacularly. Their Rs 24.75 crore investment in Mitchell Starc delivered a title. In 2025 their picks of Nortje and Spencer Johnson did not have the same effect. This year, pace again becomes a top priority.Matheesha Pathirana is expected to be their headline target – a death-overs specialist who fits perfectly into their requirements. Other options include Matt Henry, Jacob Duffy and Gerald Coetzee. Among Indian quicks, Shivam Mavi, Akash Deep and Akash Madhwal offer solid backup profiles.With Russell’s retirement, KKR must secure a powerful overseas all-rounder. Cameron Green appears the most natural fit and the most sought-after player in this auction. KKR certainly have the financial clout to enter that race. Liam Livingstone is another option, providing middle-order hitting and useful spin. Green’s flexibility – he can open or bat at three – makes him especially valuable in KKR’s evolving structure.Backed by the largest purse, KKR enter the auction with a trimmed core and a long list of decisions that will define their next cycle. They have dismantled half of their squad yet preserved the elements that still give them identity. Whether they can recreate the clarity and steel of their 2024 campaign will depend entirely on how well they read the room on December 16. If they get their captaincy call right, address the top order, settle the wicketkeeping void and secure the overseas match-winners they are targeting, KKR could swiftly move from uncertainty to genuine resurgence. The materials for a turnaround are available. It now comes down to assembling them with precision.",Kolkata Knight Riders have released Andre Russell and Venkatesh Iyer. KKR have retained 12 retained players and 13 slots available at the mini auction. Ajinkya Rahane and Sunil Narine are the only two wicketkeepers retained.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125891756,imgsize-179114,width-400,resizemode-4/2025-ipl-kolkata-knight-riders-v-chennai-super-kings.jpg"

Trump ERUPTS On Stage As Peace Prize Surprise Drops After 'Saving Millions Of Lives' | FIFA

Human rights group FairSquare has filed a formal complaint to FIFA's ethics committee, alleging that world football president Gianni Infantino violated the organisation's neutrality rules by endorsing US President Donald Trump. The controversy stems from Infantino awarding Trump FIFA's first-ever Peace Prize during the December 6 draw for the 2026 World Cup, which will be hosted by the United States, Canada and Mexico.In its complaint, FairSquare argues that the award itself represents a serious ethical breach. The group says granting a peace prize to a “sitting political figure is in and of itself a clear breach” of Article 15 of FIFA's code of ethics, which prohibits officials from expressing political preferences.FairSquare also targeted the way FIFA is being run. Calling the current leadership system “absurd”, the NGO accused Infantino of undermining the organisation's integrity and acting against the interests of global football.“This complaint is about a lot more than Infantino's support for President Donald Trump's political agenda,” FairSquare programme director Nicholas McGeehan said. “This is about how FIFA's absurd governance structure has allowed Gianni Infantino to openly flout the organisation's rules and act in ways that are both dangerous and directly contrary to the interests of the world's most popular sport.”The NGO has also asked the committee to investigate how the FIFA Peace Prize was created and why Trump was selected. It highlighted Infantino's previous praise for Trump, including his public plea in October that the US President be considered for the Nobel Peace Prize, along with three other political statements favourable to him.","Human rights group FairSquare has filed a formal complaint to FIFA's ethics committee.

Silent message: Dropped Mohamed Salah posts gym photo amid Liverpool uncertainty,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/silent-message-dropped-mohamed-salah-posts-gym-photo-amid-liverpool-uncertainty/articleshow/125873830.cms,"Photo credit: X/@MoSalah

With questions around his future at Liverpool, Mohamed Salah sent a message on Tuesday without using words. After the reaction to his comments on Saturday, Salah shared a photo on Instagram and X, showing him alone in the gym at Liverpool’s training base.In the image, Salah is seated on a workout bench facing a mirror, holding his phone for a selfie, with no expression on his face. The Egypt forward was not included in Liverpool’s squad for the Champions League match against Inter Milan. Despite that, the post showed he had reported for training and was working out at the club’s facilities.The post followed stronger comments he made after being left out of the team for the third match in a row, as Liverpool drew 3-3 with Leeds on Saturday.""It seems like the club has thrown me under the bus. That is how I am feeling. I think it is very clear that someone wanted me to get all of the blame,"" he said during an unscheduled interaction with reporters outside the stadium.Salah was aware of the impact of those remarks, made at a time when Liverpool’s title defence has struggled and pressure has increased on head coach Arne Slot.He did not travel with the squad to Milan on Monday. Slot said he was unsure whether Salah would play for the club again.""I cannot answer that question at this point in time,"" Slot said. ""I am a firm believer that there is always a possibility to return for a player. I can leave it with that I think.""Former Liverpool player and Sky Sports analyst Jamie Carragher was more critical.""I thought it was a disgrace what he did after the game,"" Carragher said on Monday Night Football. ""Some people have painted it as an emotional outburst, I don’t think it was.""Carragher added that Salah had decided ""to go for the manager and maybe try and get him sacked.""Salah is among Liverpool’s most successful players. He has won two Premier League titles, the Champions League and several other trophies with the club.Last season, he was named player of the year for the third time after scoring 34 goals in all competitions and helping Liverpool win a record-equaling 20th league title.He ended speculation about his future in April by signing a two-year contract extension, which reports said made him the club’s highest-paid player. However, his form has declined during a difficult start to the season, with Liverpool winning only two of their last 10 league matches.Salah has scored four league goals in 13 appearances this season. He was first left out against West Ham last month, then named on the bench against Sunderland, and later remained an unused substitute against Leeds.Those decisions led to his remarks, including saying he felt like ""someone doesn’t want me in the club.""He also said he has ""any relationship"" with Slot.""It is not the first or last time a player who doesn’t play says something similar to what he did,"" Slot said Monday. ""But my reaction to that is clear and that’s why he is not here tonight.""Salah is set to leave for the Africa Cup of Nations next week.

Lionel Messi has secured the MLS MVP award, making history as the first player to claim this honour in consecutive years. As the captain of the MLS Cup champions, Inter Miami, Messi has established himself as the dominant force in Major League Soccer.At 38, the Argentine star continues to break records, adding another milestone to his illustrious career. His outstanding performance included 29 goals and 19 assists during the regular season, leading the league in scoring.Messi joins Preki as only the second player to win multiple MVP awards in MLS history. While Preki won in 1997 and 2003, all other recipients have earned the award only once.""He was fantastic the whole season, with the numbers and also with the commitment,"" Inter Miami coach and longtime Messi teammate Javier Mascherano said.Despite playing in only half of Inter Miami's regular-season games in 2024, Messi's impact was undeniable. While last year's vote was close, this year's decision was clear-cut.The voting results showed Messi receiving 70.4% of total votes. San Diego's Anders Dreyer finished second with 11.2%, followed by LAFC's Denis Bouanga at 7.3%, Cincinnati's Evander at 4.8%, and Nashville's Sam Surridge at 2.4%.Messi's career accolades include eight Ballon d'Or titles, eight Pichichi trophies, six La Liga best player awards, three Best FIFA Men's Player awards, three UEFA Men's Player of the Year wins, two FIFA World Cup Golden Balls, and 15 selections as Argentina's best player.He has won 47 trophies with club and country, including the 2022 World Cup.""The reality,"" Mascherano said as the regular season was ending, ""is that Leo clears all doubts.""Messi becomes the sixth player to win both MVP and a championship in the same MLS season. Only Josef Martinez of Atlanta United in 2018 had previously achieved the triple feat of MVP, title, and Golden Boot in one year, which Messi matched in 2025.In MLS history, only four players have been MVP finalists the year after winning the award: Carlos Valderrama (1996-1997), Marco Etcheverry (1998-1999), David Villa (2016-2017), and Josef Martinez (2018-2019).Messi has committed his future to Inter Miami with a three-year contract extension. He will be present when the team opens its new stadium near Miami International Airport next season.Back-to-back MVPs are common in other major US sports leagues. Recent examples include Shohei Ohtani and Aaron Judge in baseball, A'ja Wilson in the WNBA, Nikola Jokic in the NBA, Aaron Rodgers in the NFL, and Alex Ovechkin in the NHL.","Lionel Messi has secured the MLS MVP award, making history as the first player to claim this honour in consecutive years.

NEW DELHI: In a landmark moment for Indian football, seven transgender teams made their debut in a dedicated tournament held under the banner of the Jamshedpur Super League (JSL). The Transgenders' League, which kicked off on Sunday, features seven sides — Jamshedpur FT, Chaibasa FC, Chakradharpur FC, Jamshedpur Indranagar FC, Naomundi FC, Saraikela FC and Kolhan Tiger FC — competing in a five-a-side format.Originally, only four teams were planned, but increasing interest led to three additional teams being added. The competition is part of the larger JSL framework, which also includes several age-group leagues.The opening day produced dominant performances. Jamshedpur FT registered a resounding 7-0 win against Chaibasa FC, while Kolhan Tiger FC clinched a 3-0 victory over Chakradharpur FC. Jamshedpur Indranagar FC and Noamundi FC played out a goalless draw.For Jamshedpur FT forward Puja Soy, scoring four goals in the inaugural match marked more than just sporting success — it symbolised long-awaited recognition.“Football is such a beautiful sport, and for the first time, I felt like I wasn’t being seen for my gender, but for my game,” she said.Another participant, Aliya, expressed how playing in a professional setup was a first for many.“This is the first time we are playing in a proper professional environment,” she said. “The support from the club and the fans makes us feel like we truly belong to the football family.”For most participants, just stepping onto the pitch was empowering. Jamshedpur FT captain Pyari Hessa summed up the emotional milestone.“We are thrilled to be part of this ground-breaking initiative, India’s first Transgender League,” she said.“It gives us a platform we never had before and will hopefully inspire other states to create similar spaces. We’re very grateful to Jamshedpur FC for making this possible.”According to organisers, the objective goes far beyond competition.""The introduction of the Transgender Football League marks a progressive and meaningful step in our commitment to making football inclusive, accessible, and empowering for every individual,"" said Jamshedpur FC Head of Grassroot and Youth Football, Kundan Chandra.""As a club we firmly believe that football must serve as a platform where talent is nurtured without discrimination.""The league features 70 players from diverse backgrounds — Tata Steel employees, daily-wage earners, small-business workers and more. Each team will play 12 matches, with 42 fixtures scheduled overall.Rebranded from the All India Football Federation’s Blue Cubs League framework, the JSL has evolved into a vibrant six-month football festival — one that now includes a historic step toward inclusivity in Indian sport.","The Jamshedpur Super League (JSL) features seven transgender teams.

Poll Do you support the mandatory hydration breaks during the 2026 Men's World Cup matches? Yes, it's necessary for player safety. No, it disrupts the flow of the game.

FIFA has confirmed a major change to match regulations for the 2026 Men's World Cup in North America: every game will now feature a mandatory three-minute hydration break in each half, regardless of weather conditions, venue or stadium technology.Starting next year, referees will stop the game at the 22-minute mark of each half to allow players to drink water and cool down. Unlike previous tournaments, this rule will apply even in roofed stadiums or venues with advanced air-conditioning systems across the United States, Canada and Mexico.Officials will have limited flexibility. If the game is already paused shortly before the 22-minute mark because of an injury or stoppage, the hydration break could be merged into that delay. “This will be addressed on the spot with the referee,” said Manolo Zubiria, FIFA's chief tournament officer for 2026, during a meeting with broadcasters where the change was first presented.The governing body called the update a “streamlined and simplified version” of existing regulations, which previously mandated breaks only when a specific heat threshold was crossed — once set at 32°C using the wet bulb global temperature measurement.The decision follows concerns raised during this year's FIFA Club World Cup in the United States, where players struggled in high humidity. Tournaments in previous years have also highlighted similar risks, with a Brazilian court famously ordering FIFA to enforce cooling breaks during the 2014 World Cup or face fines.Beyond safety, the change is expected to benefit broadcasters, who gain predictable stoppage windows for advertising breaks and coverage planning — a rare fixed moment in a sport known for continuous play.","FIFA has confirmed a major change to match regulations for the 2026 Men's World Cup in North America.

Vidit Gujrathi Exclusive: Indian Grandmaster Hits Out At Goa Criticism During FIDE World Cup

NEW DELHI: With the future of the Indian Super League (ISL) looking uncertain, TOI has learnt from sources that the sports ministry has ruled out using govt funds to support the All India Football Federation (AIFF), club owners and other stakeholders in running the ISL. Although the ministry has assured that the ISL and the second-tier I-League will take place this season, it could not draw on its annual budgetary allocation for that purpose. “The ministry can't help in funding and running of the league. That has to be done by the stakeholders involved,” a source informed.The ministry has suggested that ISL clubs should fund the interim expenses themselves until a new sponsorship deal is struck. This would allow the league to begin at the earliest. Once a suitable new commercial sponsor comes on board or the existing agreement with Football Sports Development Limited (FSDL) is reworked, the amount spent could be adjusted against the sponsorship revenue.It also recommended that clubs limit the number of venues and explore conducting the league in fewer cities to cut operational and logistical costs. The ISL usually kicks off in Sept every season but, as yet, the competition has not started. The Supreme Court (SC) is all set to hold a crucial hearing on Tuesday to resolve the commercial rights impasse concerning the future of the ISL. The agenda of the hearing is to discuss a pathway for the commercial aspects of the league, as the existing Master Rights Agreement between AIFF and its commercial partner FSDL expired on Monday (Dec 8).It's been learnt that the ministry submitted a status report to the apex court on Monday.","The sports ministry has ruled out using govt funds to support the All India Football Federation (AIFF), club owners and other stakeholders in running the ISL.

“I’ve been through more than most”: Cincinnati Bengals Quarterback Joe Burrow opens up about mental and physical toll of injuries,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/ive-been-through-more-than-most-cincinnati-bengals-quarterback-joe-burrow-opens-up-about-mental-and-physical-toll-of-injuries/articleshow/125900772.cms,"(Image Source - Getty Images)

Joe Burrow reflects on the mental toll of multiple injuries in 2024

This week, Joe Burrow ’s press conference hit differently, and you could feel it in the room. The Bengals are struggling to keep their playoff hopes alive, the offense has struggled without him, and his recovery from turf toe has been a key storyline this season. But when he faced the cameras before the Ravens game, his thoughts moved away from medical timelines. He talked about joy, pressure, and the emotional burden of six seasons packed with amazing highs and tough lows.The ACL tear back in 2020, the wrist injury that happened in 2023, and the most recent surgery in 2024 have all had an impact that numbers just can't capture. Reporters seeking a health update ended up with something deeper. They were reminded that even the strongest players need to take a moment to reflect when their bodies keep sidelining them. As the Bengals aim to steer clear of another postseason-less year, Burrow’s candidness might be the best indicator of his mindset as he reenters the lineup.Burrow was open about the total impact of his injuries when asked. ""I think I’ve been through more than most,"" he told reporters during the December 11, 2024, press conference at Paycor Stadium.""Certainly not easy on the brain or the body, so just trying to have fun doing it again.""The admission was made after an ESPN reporter followed up, asking about the mental hurdles of going through multiple recoveries. Burrow went into detail, recognizing the impact but not getting into specifics, ""I have been through a lot. If it’s not fun, then what am I doing it for?"" He added, ""It doesn’t change my desire to win,"".When another reporter from NFL Network asked if it was tough to find joy again considering his past, Burrow answered simply, ""It’s certainly."" He pointed out that the shift came from ongoing career contemplation rather than a single lightbulb moment, emphasizing that it was more of a gradual awareness than a pinpointed event.Burrow's candor extended to broader pressures. Asked about external factors influencing his mindset, he said, ""There are just a lot of things going on right now. A lot of things going on."" Clarifying to a Cincinnati Enquirer reporter whether these were football-related or personal, he stated simply, ""All of the above.""These quotes indicated a shift from Burrow's normal brevity. They portrayed a 29-year-old star grappling with not only physical pain, turf toe swelling that extended into practices but also the mental weariness of uncertainty. ""If I want to keep doing this, I have to have fun doing it,"" he reiterated, a line that resonated as a quiet manifesto for sustainability.Joe Burrow’s straightforwardness provided a rare insight into a star aiming to reconnect with the game on his own terms. His dedication to joy, balance, and longevity set a tone that felt larger than any individual matchup.Also Read: Aaron Rodgers and Mason Rudolph appear to kiss in a viral clip after Pittsburgh Steelers beat Baltimore Ravens","Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow was open about the total impact of his injuries when asked.

Taylor Swift turns Kelce brothers into repeat listeners





Chiefs and Eagles Frustrations, Philip Rivers Returns and Kelce Hygiene | EP 169

Taylor Swift’s music didn’t just dominate charts this year. It also took over the Kelce household, turning both Travis and Jason Kelce into full-on fans. Their latest episode of the “New Heights” podcast offered a playful window into how often the brothers streamed Swift’s new album, The Life of a Showgirl, and the results caught even them off guard. Their reactions, mixed with humor, pride and some unexpected family confessions, sparked a wave of chatter online.The episode also arrived at a tense moment for Travis, who is navigating a rough patch with the Kansas City Chiefs while still supporting Swift’s landmark year. The mix of football frustration, music talk and brotherly teasing created a candid, lively conversation that fans devoured across platforms.The music reveal began when Travis asked, “Did you look at your Spotify Wrap?” Jason pulled up his dashboard and instantly cringed. “Oh my God! That’s embarrassing,” he said, after seeing his “average age” come in at 83. Travis joked that he didn’t fare much better with a 68.Their attention quickly shifted to Swift’s new album, released in October. Jason admitted that The Life of a Showgirl was his second most-played project of 2025, while his top album was a doo-wop record he sings to his seven-month-old daughter Finnley.“Outside of doo-wop,” he said, his No. 2 was Swift’s album. Travis immediately chimed in, “It was No. 1 for me,” prompting Jason to laugh, “Damn it. You beat me.”The teasing continued when Jason joked about trying to sing Swift’s songs. “I can’t sing Tay songs. ‘Dad, you’re really off pitch here!’” Travis urged him to “just sing along” to the “catchy” tracks that have swept listeners worldwide.Swift’s album has shattered records, including the biggest first-day global iTunes sales and her strongest U.S. first-week totals after selling 2.7 million copies in 24 hours.The podcast also touched on football. Travis addressed the Chiefs’ 23-20 loss to the Chargers, saying, “It’s been a tough f–king go around for the past two days… I feel like I always had the answers … and this year, I just can’t find them.”Swift watched that game from a suite with Selena Gomez, Lena Dunham, and Leonardo DiCaprio. She and Travis, who got engaged in August, will marry this summer in Rhode Island.Also Read: ""Off-balance and out of rhythm"": Is Patrick Mahomes the reason behind Chiefs' struggle?

Gracie Hunt has grown up with the Kansas City Chiefs in her bloodstream, but her impact on the NFL goes far beyond family ties and box-seat views. As the daughter of team owner Clark Hunt, she’s been part of the franchise her entire life, yet she’s building a personal brand that blends sports culture with fashion, empowerment, and community influence.Hunt’s latest collaboration with fine jeweler Monica Rich Kosann isn’t just a tribute to the Chiefs aesthetic; it’s a statement about identity and intention. She calls the arrow-inspired pendants a symbol of direction, heritage, and inner drive. “The arrowhead has been part of my life for as long as I can remember, so it carries a deep sense of identity and direction for me,” she shared, using football legacy as inspiration for wearable meaning.The exclusive “Aim True” pendant collection features sleek silver and 18K gold designs, engraved with words meant to inspire personal focus. Hunt says teaming up with Kosann came naturally because “[Monica’s] jewelry has always felt like more than adornment, it feels like intention you can wear.”That intention extends beyond her accessories. Hunt even gifted Taylor Swift one of the necklaces as an engagement present, proving the Chiefs’ fashion circle is expanding in glittering ways.But while high-end jewelry gives game day its polish, Hunt says her look is rooted in ritual. Products like Tatcha’s Dewy Skin Cream and Silk Sunscreen are “non-negotiable” for her long days at Arrowhead Stadium.With hours in the spotlight and unpredictable weather, she relies on setting sprays like BareMinerals Original Mineral Veil 24 HR Setting Spray to “lock everything in,” while Tower 28’s SOS Daily Rescue Facial Spray is her “go-to everyday essential.” Mini perfumes, glosses, and deodorants keep her appearance memorable yet manageable.Still, Hunt insists that her glamorous persona isn’t about perfection. For her, style is simply another form of confidence. “Whether it’s game day or every day, I remind myself to keep it classy, sassy, and a little bit flashy,” she said, then added what she considers the real secret to looking your best. “And truly, the prettiest thing anyone can wear is confidence.”Also Read: Chiefs heiress Gracie Hunt brings runway-worthy style to an intense mint green training session","Gracie Hunt is the daughter of Kansas City Chiefs owner Clark Hunt.

“Very hurtful”: Gisele Bündchen sees her divorce from Tom Brady as the end of a dream and the start of a new life,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/very-hurtful-gisele-bndchen-sees-her-divorce-from-tom-brady-as-the-end-of-a-dream-and-the-start-of-a-new-life/articleshow/125890938.cms,"Gisele Bündchen described her divorce from Tom Brady as a ""death and a rebirth,"" emphasizing that their split stemmed from growing apart, not conflict. She clarified that football was not the reason for their separation, highlighting their mutual desire for each other's happiness. The couple now co-parents their children respectfully, demonstrating a mature approach to their evolving family dynamic.

How Gisele Bündchen describes love changing over time and why football wasn’t the real reason behind the split

When Gisele Bündchen first spoke openly about her divorce from NFL legend Tom Brady, the world was still stunned that one of pop culture’s most admired marriages had come to an end. Years have now passed since the couple finalized their split, but the supermodel’s words continue to resonate with anyone who has watched their own life change direction.In her emotional interview with Vanity Fair, Bündchen described the separation as “a death and a rebirth,” acknowledging how difficult it was to accept the loss of the future she once imagined. What was once a fairytale relationship became a reminder that even the most glamorous partnerships are fragile. Her reflection wasn’t bitter, only deeply honest about love, growth, and the courage to start over.At a time when rumors swirled that Brady’s football career, and his refusal to retire, led to the breakup, Bündchen firmly dismissed that narrative. She called the allegations “very hurtful” and “the craziest thing I’ve ever heard,” explaining that she had actually always been one of his biggest supporters.“Listen, I have always cheered for him, and I would continue forever… If there's one person I want to be the happiest in the world, it's him,” she said, emphasizing that she still wanted Brady to succeed long after their marriage ended.Instead, Bündchen said the divorce came not from conflict, but from growth. “Sometimes you grow together; sometimes you grow apart,” she explained, reflecting on how their dreams changed over time. What they wanted as a young couple didn’t fully align with who they eventually became. “That doesn't mean you don't love the person. It just means that… you have to have somebody who can meet you in the middle, right? It's a dance. It's a balance.”Today, the two remain committed to raising their children in a supportive, modern family structure, with both living in Miami and co-parenting with mutual respect. Bündchen returned to modeling and embraced life in Costa Rica, and Brady moved on from his playing career. She summed up their evolution with rare maturity: “We’re not playing against each other. We are a team, and that’s beautiful.”Also Read: “You make every room brighter”: Gisele Bündchen makes rare appearance in Tom Brady’s heartfelt Instagram post","Gisele Bündchen spoke out about her divorce from Tom Brady in an interview with Vanity Fair.

New Justin Baldoni twist drags Taylor Swift into explosive legal battle as Travis Kelce stays silent after Chiefs loss,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/new-justin-baldoni-twist-drags-taylor-swift-into-explosive-legal-battle-as-travis-kelce-stays-silent-after-chiefs-loss/articleshow/125890482.cms,"Director Justin Baldoni allegedly referenced Taylor Swift's public image in private messages, comparing actress Blake Lively's alleged tactics to the ""Taylor Swift playbook"" amid a Hollywood dispute. This comes as Swift's fiancé, Travis Kelce, faces intense scrutiny following a Kansas City Chiefs loss, highlighting the pervasive influence of both figures.

How Taylor Swift’s name landed in a dispute far outside the NFL spotlight





The ongoing fallout between It Ends With Us director Justin Baldoni and actress Blake Lively has unexpectedly spilled into the world of Taylor Swift and, indirectly, the NFL spotlight surrounding her fiancé, Travis Kelce . Swift, who has stayed publicly removed from the feud, was referenced in recently revealed messages Baldoni allegedly sent describing Lively’s behavior during the movie’s production. The actor claimed Lively was attempting to “play the victim”, a move he compared to what he called the “Taylor Swift playbook.”The timing of Swift’s name being dragged into Hollywood tension has collided with a tough week for Kelce on the football field. Following a brutal loss to the Houston Texans, the Kansas City Chiefs star reportedly avoided the media and endured heavy online criticism. While the situations are unrelated, both reflect the intense scrutiny attached to two of the world’s most recognizable figures.In Baldoni’s private texts that surfaced amid the lawsuits, the director warned a friend of what he believed Lively was capable of during disagreements over the film’s control. “If she doesn’t promote the movie, she can leak that I’m a bad person or that she felt unsafe with me and all the stuff she has on me. Then she’s the victim. It’s the Taylor Swift playbook.”“So she can ask for whatever she wants because she knows I know.”By invoking Swift’s name, Baldoni painted a broader narrative about public influence, suggesting that Lively could mirror the pop star’s ability to win public sympathy.However, the comparison ignores a key distinction: Swift has been known to speak out primarily when defending herself, not when steering controversies around business disagreements. That nuance has been missing from the online noise surrounding the claim. Instead, social media quickly turned the narrative into a speculative debate about Swift’s reputation, even though the pop icon has zero involvement in the dispute.Meanwhile, Kelce found himself in a storm of sports backlash after a low-impact performance in the Chiefs’ loss. Fans on social media mocked both his play and his partnership with Swift, proving that even when she isn’t speaking, her presence becomes part of every headline.In the end, Swift isn’t fighting a battle in Hollywood or in Kansas City, yet her name remains the loudest echo in both.Also Read: “You lose actual connection”: Ed Sheeran breaks silence on shift in friendship with Taylor Swift after her engagement to Travis Kelce","Director Justin Baldoni allegedly referenced Taylor Swift's public image in private messages, comparing actress Blake Lively's alleged tactics to the ""Taylor Swift playbook"" This comes as Swift's fiancé, Travis Kelce, faces intense scrutiny following a Kansas City Chiefs loss, highlighting the pervasive influence of both figures.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125890482,imgsize-57234,width-400,resizemode-4/125890482.jpg"

Aaron Rodgers, the Pittsburgh Steelers’ veteran, has sparked chaos ever since he spoke about his marriage but kept the identity of his wife hidden.Nearly six months later, the identity of Aaron Rodgers’ wife remains private but now, it seems his family’s feelings about the whole thing has resurfaced.A few months ago, in June 2025, a source had revealed what Aaron Rodgers estranged brother Jordan and his wife, JoJo, feel about the entire thing.As per Daily Mail, a source had revealed, “Jordan and JoJo didn’t go to the wedding and don’t even know anything really about Brittani…”The source added, “What they’ve heard is secondhand from his parents [Ed and Darla]. They are still angry that Aaron didn’t go to their wedding [in May 2022]. He didn’t want to be with his brother on the biggest day of his life, so why should they twist themselves up over this wedding?”The source continued, “Secondhand, they hear that she’s willing to stay private and that she’s not with him for his fame or money. But they know nothing about her…This is not a close family unit at all. Right now, JoJo and Jordan are getting the news about the marriage from the internet.”However, Aaron Rodgers has not addressed these speculations as fans troll him for keeping the identity of his wife hidden.A few months ago, Aaron Rodgers appeared on ESPN's Pat McAfee’s show, The Pat McAfee, where he opened up about how he and his wife want privacy in their personal life.Aaron Rodgers said, ""Now I’m with somebody who's private, who doesn’t want to be in the public eye, didn’t sign up to be a celebrity, doesn’t want to be part of it…”The NFL veteran added, ""And because I do things in private because I want my personal life to be private and now I’m somehow weird and now the paparazzi is stalking me on the beach trying to get a picture of her, stalking me in the workout.

Dwyane Wade ’s wife Gabrielle Union sends emotional shoutout to A’ja Wilson for her outstanding WNBA contributions



A’ja Wilson secures AP Female Athlete of the Year



The name of A’ja Wilson has turned into a synonym of excellence, strength, and inspiration. This week she was showered in praise by Gabrielle Union who termed Wilson a culture shifter and her capacity to make an impact without being controversial. Union shared that Wilson makes the world open its eyes, no scandal, no gimmicks. This applause shows the impact that Wilson has had on the basketball field as well as serving as an example to both young players and fans. Her profession is a depiction of persistence, talent and personality.The accolades keep piling up for Wilson, whose season with the Las Vegas Aces has been nothing short of extraordinary. On top of her athletic feats, the four-time WNBA MVP has inspired a new generation of female athletes. Even LeBron James reflected on her broader influence, noting, “I realized her greatest impact isn’t what I see, it’s what Zhuri sees. A’ja Wilson is the definition of female Black excellence, and I am so grateful she is giving my daughter the kind of inspiration I got from Michael Jordan and Ken Griffey Jr. ”NBA legend Dwyane Wade’s wife Gabrielle Union told Time that A’ja Wilson “a culture shifter.” “She forces the world to take notice without scandal or gimmicks, just excellence without trying to be perfect,” Union added.Wilson’s 2025 season further established her legacy. She led the Aces to a third championship in four seasons while claiming her fourth MVP, third Defensive Player of the Year, and second Finals MVP.Coach Becky Hammon shared Wilson’s unique blend of talent and humility, saying, “Her relatability, her being down to earth makes her a great superstar. Her skill set is unmatched, but she’s also the easiest player to coach. To have that mixture of humility, grace and skill, there’s a reason why she’s doing things that have never been done.” Wilson overcame adversity, rallying her team from a .500 record to a 16-game winning streak, ultimately sweeping Phoenix in the WNBA Finals.Wilson’s excellence has been recognized beyond the WNBA. She was named TIME’s 2025 Athlete of the Year and The Associated Press Female Athlete of the Year, making her only the fifth basketball player to earn the honor since 1931.Reflecting on the recognition, Wilson said, “It’s an honor when you think about the group of women who have won before. Just to have my name be a part of it, I’m blessed.” Wilson also has cultural influence and in business ventures, including a successful shoe and clothing line with Nike, demonstrating that Wilson’s impact transcends basketball.Also Read: Hollywood actress receives touching compliment from Magic Johnson after posing for a photo at star-studded event","A’ja Wilson was named TIME’s 2025 Athlete of the Year and The Associated Press Female athlete of the year.

My Final Verdict On This Mock Trade: Clear Advantage for Miami Heat

Rumors around Giannis Antetokounmpo’s future have intensified again, and the Miami Heat sit front and center in the speculation. With Milwaukee stumbling to a 10-15 start and the two-time MVP recently discussing his calf injury situation with the Bucks’ front office, league insiders continue to float the possibility of a franchise-altering move if the team cannot rebound. Miami, sitting at 14-11 and searching for a new offensive engine, has emerged as one of the most aggressive theoretical suitors.Tyler Herro, Miami’s 2025 All-Star guard averaging 23.8 points per game, has become the headline name in potential packages. His $31 million salary and on-ball scoring make him the most realistic matching asset in any scenario involving Antetokounmpo.A hypothetical trade framework circulating among insiders outlines how a blockbuster could be structured. Miami would receive Giannis Antetokounmpo (31, extension-eligible at $175 million), Gary Trent Jr., Andre Jackson Jr., and Thanasis Antetokounmpo.Milwaukee Bucks, in turn, would gain a combination of young talent, expiring salary, and long-term draft control: Tyler Herro, Kel’el Ware, Jaime Jaquez Jr., Terry Rozier, two first-round picks (2030 and 2032), and a 2031 pick swap. Trade machine projections show the salaries balancing without forcing Miami to include Bam Adebayo.• Adds a generational force to pair with Bam Adebayo• Immediately elevates its ceiling, especially without Jimmy Butler’s usual playoff presence• Maintains defensive structure by keeping Adebayo• Fits Antetokounmpo’s preference for disciplined, competitive environments like Pat Riley’s culture• Positions Miami as a top-three seed in the East• Acquires Herro as a 25-year-old efficient scorer to reset the backcourt• Adds Kel’el Ware, one of the most promising rookie bigs• Gains two first-round picks and an additional swap to reshape a roster that has slipped to 11th in the East• Begins a post-Damian Lillard rebuild with real foundational pieces• Avoids losing Giannis for limited value at a later date• Miami sacrifices Herro’s shot creation and Ware’s long-term upside• Milwaukee faces immediate fan backlash for parting with a Finals MVP• Heat lose future flexibility with multiple picks outgoing• Bucks take on short-term competitive decline during the resetIf completed, this deal would instantly shift the balance of power. The Heat would deploy a Giannis-Bam frontcourt that rivals any defensive tandem in the league, while Antetokounmpo’s 28.9 points, 10.8 rebounds, and 6.8 assists this season make him the exact offensive presence Miami has lacked.Milwaukee, meanwhile, gets a workable overhaul. Herro’s 23.8 points per game and 52.4 percent shooting offer a fresh scoring identity, while Ware and Jaquez add developmental depth. With draft assets added, the Bucks have multiple paths to rebuild quickly or pivot again at future deadlines.• Elevates roster from fringe contender to immediate title threat• Giannis transforms offensive efficiency and defensive versatility• Seamless pairing next to Adebayo• Fits Miami’s culture and timeline• Depth weakens without Herro and Ware• Limited draft capital moving forward• Pressure skyrockets to win immediately• Gain two foundational young pieces in Herro and Ware• Receive picks needed for a full rebuild• Reset the roster in response to the 11th-place slump• Lose their franchise identity and star power• Potential fan revolt• Short-term competitiveness declines sharplyIf this blockbuster ever materializes, Miami Heat emerge as the clear beneficiary. The Giannis-Bam duo alone positions them at the top of the Eastern Conference hierarchy, while the acquisition fills every gap in their current structure. Milwaukee’s return is logical and strategic, but losing a two-time MVP rarely results in a balanced outcome.Also read: NBA trade rumors: Los Angeles Lakers linked to $68 million New Orleans Pelicans superstar in blockbuster move to pair with Luka Doncic Given the Bucks’ early-season struggles, internal discussions about Giannis’ injury, and prior reports linking Miami to summer offers, the Heat remain one of the few organizations with both the assets and the motivation to make such a seismic move before February’s deadline. Should these rumors ever gather real momentum, the NBA landscape would shift immediately.","Rumors around Giannis Antetokounmpo’s future have intensified again, and the Miami Heat sit front and center in the speculation. Miami, sitting at 14-11 and searching for a new offensive engine, has emerged as one of the most aggressive theoretical suitors.

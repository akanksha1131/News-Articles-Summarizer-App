Rohit Sharma's batting in ODIs has been game changing: Shubman Gill

India’s updated squad for ODI series against England:

The suspense around Jasprit Bumrah 's fitness continues as the updated squad for the ODI series against England released by the BCCI on Tuesday does not feature his name, while he was earlier expected to be available for the third match of the series.The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) added mystery spinner Varun Chakaravarthy to the squad, rewarding him for the 14 wickets, including a five-wicket haul, he took in the five-match T20I series against England. It earned him the 'Player of the Series' award.Initially, when India's ODI squad was announced last month, the BCCI chief selector Ajit Agarkar had expressed hope for Bumrah to recover in time from his back injury for the third match.Bumrah suffered back spasms during the Sydney Test and could not bowl during Australia's second innings.""With Bumrah, we are waiting to hear about his fitness and when he's likely to be available,"" Agarkar had said while announcing the squad for the England white-ball series and Champions Trophy. ""At the moment I don't think he is likely to be fit for the first couple of games (ODIs vs England) at least from what we gather. We will probably hear more in the next week or so about his fitness.""I know he was asked to offload for five weeks of bowling, which is early first week February if I'm not wrong. And we'll probably find out a bit more around that time what exactly and with regards to what his medical condition is...It's better it comes from the (BCCI) medical department than me trying to explain what exactly is wrong with him. But that's the time frame that we've been told. And hopefully, he's okay after that.""However, on Tuesday, the updated ODI squad for the England series released by the BCCI did not feature Bumrah's name.As reported by Timesofindia.com earlier, Bumrah reached Bengaluru on February 2 and was scheduled to undergo scans and further assessment under the watchful eyes of BCCI's medical team.Bumrah has been named in India's Champions Trophy squad but his participation in the eight-team tournament depends on the outcome of the scans and assessment at the National Cricket Academy.The first ODI against England will be played in Nagpur on February 6, and the next two on February 9 and 12.

MI Cape Town continued their rampant run in the SA20 when they beat Paarl Royals by 39 runs in the first qualifier on Tuesday. With their comfortable win at St George's Park in Gqeberha, MI Cape Town booked their place in the final at the Wanderers in Johannesburg on Saturday. Paarl Royals, meanwhile, will have another bite at the cherry when they take on the victor of the Eliminator between Joburg Super Kings and Sunrisers Eastern Cape.MI Cape Town will enter the final with momentum on their side, picking their fifth win in a row and extended their unbeaten streak seven. The last time they tasted defeat was against the Paarl Royals on January 15.Royals, on the other hand, are headed in the other direction as they succumbed to their third loss in a row, having waltzed into the playoffs courtesy a flawless home record - just like MICT.On Tuesday at St George's Park, the Royals never looked like bothering MICT. Even when three of MI Cape Town's wickets fell in the gap of six runs and eight balls. Or when David Miller and Dunith Wellalage built a 33-run stand and then Miller took the onus alongside Dinesh Karthik.The PR captain Miller slammed three boundaries in the ninth Corbin Bosch over. He then went big on two consecutive balls for back-to-back sixes in the 14th over. Despite this big hitting, the Royals never really looked like getting close to MI Cape Town's 200-run target.The game was put beyond the Royals' reach in the very first innings itself. St George's Park had seen an average total of 129 this season with the highest coming from the bat of MI Cape Town batters (174/7) at the start of the season.After the Royals won the toss and decided to field, they were put under the pump from the get go. Ryan Rickelton (44 from 27 balls) and Rassie van der Dussen (40 from 32 balls) continued their exploits this SA20 season. They quickly made their mark and raced off to 73/0 after the powerplay overs. Both the MICT batters dealt in boundaries with seven fours and four sixes between them.Just when Paarl Royals appeared to have applied the brakes with three quick wickets, up stepped George Linde (26 from 14 balls) to shift the flow of the game.MICT ended with a flourish, producing 74 runs from the last five overs - 15, 6, 9, 27, 17 respectively - to put the eventual outcome beyond any doubt. At the heart of the late flurry were Dewald Brevis (44* from 30 balls) and Delano Potgieter (32* from 17 balls).","MI Cape Town beat Paarl Royals by 39 runs in the first qualifier of the SA20 tournament.

Great that two Chennai boys played the final, says Pragg

CHENNAI: Grandmaster R Praggnanandhaa left 2024 behind with a tinge of disappointment. But he started the new year with a bang, toppling newly-crowned world champion D Gukesh in tie-breakers to claim his maiden Tata Steel Chess title in Wijk aan Zee , the Netherlands. In doing so, he became only the second Indian to win the event, after Viswanathan Anand After finishing runner-up in the 2023 World Cup, the 19-year-old's form took a hit in 2024. Pragg finished fifth at the Candidates but played a key role in India's gold at the Budapest Chess Olympiad. However, his loss to Wesley So in the penultimate round ended India's unbeaten run in the Open section.""It feels really good because I didn't have a great end to 2024. I was highly motivated for this event and worked hard with my coach RB Ramesh sir. I think my efforts paid off, and I'm very happy that I managed to start the year with such a result,"" Pragg told reporters after receiving a warm welcome from Sports Development Authority of Tamil Nadu (SDAT) officials at Chennai Airport on Tuesday.Pragg's victory at Tata Steel Chess was shaped by a mix of his brilliance and the fortunate contributions of his Olympiad gold-winning squad. Arjun Erigaisi 's win over Gukesh in the final round pushed the latter into tie-breaks, while Pentala Harikrishna 's draw with Nodirbek Abdusattorov kept the Uzbek GM out of the playoffs.But it wasn't just in one way that Pragg's teammates contributed to his triumph.When asked how he motivated himself after a challenging period, the Chennai boy said: ""The results of other Indian chess players, like Gukesh winning the World Championship or Arjun Erigaisi crossing 2800 (Elo rating in classical chess), have definitely inspired me to work harder and keep it going. That is one of the reasons, but not the only one. I was not really happy with my game quality, and I wanted to play better. I knew I could, and that's what kept me going. So, I kept practising.""With this big victory, Pragg earned 25 circuit points, placing him second on the 2025 FIDE circuit leaderboard – a crucial step toward qualifying for the Candidates Tournament . Pragg said while the win was significant, there's still a long road ahead. ""It's still the start of the year. Many tournaments are coming up in 2025, like the World Cup and Grand Swiss, and all these are very important for Candidates' qualification. Still, this win is important for my confidence.""In the intense final moments, the two Chennai boys, Pragg and Gukesh, fiercely vied for the title. ""At the end of the day, the title came to our city, so that's a proud feeling. It was nice to have two Chennai boys in the final. Huge congratulations to him (Gukesh) as well; he played really well. After the match, we spoke a bit about our game, but both of us were exhausted after such a long day,"" said Pragg.","Grandmaster R Praggnanandhaa wins maiden Tata Steel Chess title in Wijk aan Zee. He topples newly-crowned world champion D Gukesh in tie-breakers.

Will Rohit Sharma win another ICC trophy? Here's what the horoscope says

NEW DELHI: Former India coach Ravi Shastri has cautioned against rushing Jasprit Bumrah back into action for the Champions Trophy if he is not fully fit. Calling it a ""high-risk move,"" Shastri emphasised the importance of managing Bumrah’s workload carefully, given his history of injuries.With the ICC Men’s Champions Trophy 2025 approaching, India's title prospects face scrutiny amid uncertainty over the fitness of pace spearhead Bumrah.Cricket legends Ricky Ponting and Ravi Shastri believe Bumrah’s potential absence could significantly weaken India’s campaign, reducing their chances of winning by nearly 30-35%.Bumrah, who had an exceptional 2024, was recently named ICC Men’s Cricketer of the Year and ICC Men’s Test Cricketer of the Year. He played a key role in India’s T20 World Cup triumph and delivered outstanding performances across formats.However, a back spasm sustained during the Sydney Test against Australia in January has sidelined him since. Though included in India’s initial Champions Trophy squad, his absence from the upcoming three-match ODI series against England has intensified concerns over his fitness.Shastri, speaking on The ICC Review, strongly advised against rushing Bumrah back into the side, emphasising the risks involved. He pointed out that India has a packed international schedule ahead, and jeopardising the fitness of their premier fast bowler for a single tournament could have long-term repercussions.“I think it's high risk. There's too much big cricket coming up for India,” Shastri said on The ICC Review.“At this stage of his career, I think he's too precious to be just called on for one game out of the blue and asked to deliver. The expectations will be so much. They'll think that he'll come in straight away and set the world on fire. It’s never that easy when you come back from injury.”Shastri also emphasised Bumrah's crucial role in India's Champions Trophy campaign, stating that his absence would be a significant setback to the team's plans.“Bumrah not fit will reduce India's chances [of winning the Champions Trophy by 30%, literally by 30-35%,” he said. “With a fully fit Bumrah playing, you are guaranteed those death overs. It would’ve been a different ball game altogether.”Former Australia captain Ponting echoed Shastri’s concerns, suggesting that Bumrah’s heavy workload during the recent Border-Gavaskar Trophy may have played a role in his injury. Ponting emphasised that managing Bumrah’s fitness should be a top priority for India, given his immense value across formats.With Bumrah’s availability in doubt, Ponting believes the spotlight now shifts to Mohammed Shami , who has recently returned from an injury layoff. Shami featured in India’s limited-overs series against England, and his experience and ability to lead the pace attack will be crucial if Bumrah is unable to recover in time for the big-ticket event.“My biggest concern about India when they came for Australia in the Test series was Bumrah not having Shami there as a backup and him having to shoulder most of the load,” Ponting said on The ICC Review.“And that's probably what happened, and might even have something to do with why he [Bumrah] got hurt. He probably ended up having to bowl a bit more in that series with Shami not being there.”However, Ponting sees Shami’s return as a positive development for India. The veteran pacer has displayed glimpses of his best form, notably delivering an impressive spell of 3/25 in the fourth T20I against England.Shastri also weighed in on Shami’s comeback, stressing that his fitness and endurance will be tested in the ODIs against England. He noted that with Bumrah’s availability uncertain, Shami’s ability to step up as India’s pace spearhead will be crucial for their Champions Trophy campaign.“It will be interesting to see if India play him out in all three, or they give him the first one and the third one, and then ease him into the Champions Trophy,” Shastri said.“But he'll be watched very closely because 10 overs is totally different to four overs, and then you're going to see how he pulls up in the field as well having bowled those 10 overs.”Shami last played an ODI for India in the 2023 ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup final against Australia, where he emerged as the tournament’s highest wicket-taker. His return to the 50-over format comes at a critical juncture for India, with the Champions Trophy on the horizon and uncertainty surrounding Bumrah’s fitness.Shami’s ability to stay fit and consistently bowl full spells will be vital for India’s campaign, particularly if Bumrah is unavailable. His experience, swing, and knack for breaking partnerships make him a key asset, and the upcoming ODI series against England will serve as an important test of his readiness.",Jasprit Bumrah was named ICC Men's Cricketer of the Year. He has been sidelined with a back spasm since January. Ravi Shastri and Ricky Ponting have warned against rushing him back. They believe his absence could significantly weaken India's Champions Trophy campaign.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117922252,imgsize-33582,width-400,resizemode-4/117922252.jpg"

Will Rohit Sharma win another ICC trophy? Here's what the horoscope says

What does Shubman Gill's horoscope say about his captaincy future

NEW DELHI: Former batter Suresh Raina believes that while India may have faced recent struggles, the form of skipper Rohit Sharma and his longtime teammate Virat Kohli will be crucial to the team's success in the upcoming ICC Champions Trophy . The tournament, set to begin on February 19 in Pakistan and conclude on March 9, will see India playing all their matches in Dubai under the hybrid model agreement finalised by the relevant parties.Speaking to broadcaster Star Sports, Raina said, ""Rohit Sharma's strike rate has improved significantly after the ODI World Cup in 2023. Since then, he has scored runs at a strike rate of 119-120, making him one of India's best ODI batsmen.""For Rohit and Virat, I would say that when you have a strong record of past performances, it gives you a lot of confidence. They complement each other well, and both have the skill to score big runs. If they perform well, India's Champions Trophy campaign will benefit immensely.""India have been clubbed with arch-rivals Pakistan, New Zealand and Bangladesh in the group stage of the tournament.Speaking about the spin department and team combination, Raina said, ""I think (Ravindra) Jadeja will definitely play because of his effectiveness in ODIs. Kuldeep (Yadav) has not played a match since his injury, but we also have Axar Patel, who has been consistently performing well.""The pitches in Dubai will offer some seam movement, but spin will also play a role. That's why Kuldeep, Axar, and Jadeja need to be in top form. Rohit's choice of team combination will be crucial.""Ahead of the Champions Trophy, India are schueduled to a three-match ODI series against England.""When it comes to white-ball cricket, Virat knows how to switch on and switch off. He has scored the most runs against England, so his energy will be at a different level automatically. The three ODIs will be played in Nagpur, Ahmedabad, and Cuttack -- all of which are high-scoring venues,"" Raina said of Kohli, who has struggled for runs in the Test series in Australia.Speaking on his expectations from Rohit, Raina said, ""I think Rohit should play aggressively. You saw how he batted in the ODI World Cup -- he was attacking even in the final. So, I believe his approach will remain the same.""The key question is who will open alongside him -- will it be Shubman (Gill)? I remember, whenever they play together, they maintain an aggressive intent.""Raina also lauded Rohit's captaincy.""Rohit Sharma is an attacking captain. The way he utilises his bowlers is commendable -- bringing in Mohammad Shami at crucial moments and relying on spinners strategically.""When Rohit scores runs, it also reflects in his captaincy. This could be his last ICC trophy as captain, and if he wins, he will become the first Indian player to win four ICC trophies.""He has already won the T20 World Cup, and securing the Champions Trophy would be a remarkable achievement. He will be motivated to make it happen, but scoring runs will be crucial for him.""","Suresh Raina believes form of Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli will be crucial to India's success in the upcoming ICC Champions Trophy. The tournament is set to begin on February 19 in Pakistan and conclude on March 9.

ISPL: I haven't seen such a well organised tournament for tennis ball cricket, says RP Singh

NEW DELHI: Australian cricket great Ian Healyhas supported the suggestion to recall Sam Konstas from the Sri Lanka tour, enabling him to participate in crucial Sheffield Shield matches before the World Test Championship later this year.Despite Konstas's impressive debut in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy series, where he notably handled Jasprit Bumrah well, he was excluded from the playing XI in Australia's victory in the first Test against Sri Lanka in Galle. Josh Inglis replaced him whilst Travis Head was promoted to open.Given Australia's commanding performance in Galle, the team composition is likely to remain unchanged for the second Test commencing on Thursday. Healy suggests that Konstas should return to represent New South Wales in the Sheffield Shield to gain additional red-ball cricket experience before the World Test Championship final.""You don't give just opportunities in a Test team, so they'll be keeping the same team as long as everyone's fit. Australia will have the same team, and I like the idea (of sending Konstas home to play First Class),"" Healy told SENQ Breakfast.Also See: ICC Champions Trophy 2025 ""He's had a week in Dubai; he's had a week or more training in Sri Lanka, watching a Test match and being around the dressing room and seeing how blokes are approaching each session.""Now, if you're not going to play him, he might as well be back playing for New South Wales and getting more red ball practice is, because they're going to use him in the World Test Championship. He'll come back to be the opening batsman against South Africa, so he's got to get some red ball cricket under his belt,"" he added.Healy believes Konstas has benefited from observing how to succeed in overseas conditions during his recent weeks with the team.""He would get stuff out of it. Even just to see the grind of Steve Smith and Usman Khawaja how he went out again and approached it right from ball one on the fifth session that he'd batted, it's those types of things.""He would have listened to the strategies and participated in the strategies, so he would have learned,"" Healy said.Previously, Brad Haddin, another former wicketkeeper, advocated for Konstas's return to New South Wales for their upcoming Sheffield Shield match against Queensland at the Gabba.",Ian Healy supports suggestion to recall Sam Konstas from the Sri Lanka tour.

NEW DELHI: The lack of form of Sanju Samson has alarmed former India spinner Ravichandran Ashwin , who claims that if he does not find a way out of his current rut, his mind may begin ""playing tricks"" with him.Samson, 30, had a miserable series against England's quick pace and short balls and will be sidelined for a month owing to a fracture in his right index finger.Only 51 runs were scored by him in the five-match match, which India won 4-1.""...if Sanju keeps getting dismissed like this, as a batter, the mind will be playing tricks,"" Ashwin said.""(It will force you to think) the bowler is bowling a certain way and I am getting dismissed like this, is the bowler bowling well or do I have a shortcoming? Will I be able to adapt? Once so many questions arises, then it becomes difficult,"" he explained.Also See: ICC Champions Trophy 2025 Ashwin also suggested that out-of-form captain Suryakumar Yadav alter his strategy in order to break out of the current rut in form that he is experiencing. Suryakumar's run total in the recently finished series against England was barely 28.""I can understand it happening in one or two games, but it is quite surprising,"" Ashwin said on his Hindi YouTube channel.""...when you know you are being attacked in a certain way, there should be a different approach to that ball or just avoid it and force the bowler to bowl at your strengths.""""Suryakumar Yadav is a very experienced guy. He has a lot of ability. One can say he brought about a change of guard in Indian batting, showing the way. But the time has come for him to take some time out and change his approach,"" he added.Samson, who has fluctuated in his performance during his career in international cricket, should respond appropriately, according to Ashwin , to prevent doubts from infiltrating his subconscious mind.But Ashwin cited legendary Sachin Tendulkar 's advice during last week's BCCI Naman Awards that players should use their subconscious mind too.""Sachin Tendulkar also said during the (BCCI) awards function that (you must) do so many repetitions that you allow the subconscious mind to take over,"" he said.""But if so much confusion comes over on the subconscious mind, then batting becomes a different ball game altogether.""Failure in T20 cricket , according to Ashwin, is not the issue; rather, the way dismissals are handled can raise questions.Also See: Champions Trophy Schedule 2025 ""As an experienced cricketer I will not focus on someone failing in T20 cricket but on how is he getting out, what is his decision making is like, I will focus on that. They are good enough players to find solutions and they will think over it,"" he said.A player's ability to manage pressure in the shortest formats is how they are always evaluated, according to Ashwin.""T20 cricket is (all) about failures, you are bound to fail. You will not be able to play percentage cricket. As per this, I will think (about) the player who can handle pressure and can deliver wins,"" he said.""Those players can be given long rope because T20 cricket is not about consistency, it's about excitement, putting fear in the opposition.""Ashwin was also taken aback by England's tactics in all forms, claiming that their aggressive approach is costing them more games than they are winning.""...if I was England, I would be really worried, because they play Bazball , one-day and T20 cricket... all that is fine,"" he said.""One can talk about it as much as they want, sometimes they pull off wins too. But I think they are losing more than they are winning so it is a serious matter of concern.""","Former India spinner Ravichandran Ashwin is concerned about Sanju Samson's recent form.

NEW DELHI: Abhishek Sharma rewrote record books with his scintillating knock in the fifth T20I against England at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai on Sunday.Abhishek hit a brutal 135 to set up a crushing 150-run win over England and seal the series 4-1 and his incredible 54-ball knock, studded with 13 sixes, fired India, who clinched the series in the fourth T20I, to 247/9.On Monday, the Indian cricket board (BCCI) shared a video on X where the opener looked back at his knock and also explained his unique celebration with his index finger and thumb.Abhishek says in the video, ""When I reached a fifty I celebrated in that way, this is love. I really enjoyed my knock because before this, I didn't even have a thirty-run knock to my name in India. I used to think how I would celebrate reaching a hundred but when I reached it, I was totally blank, the emotions that came out were natural.""Also See: 2025 Champions Trophy Abhishek dominated a partnership of 115 for the second wicket with Tilak Varma and raced to his fifty in 17 balls with a six and then reached his second T20 century for India in 37 deliveries, missing the record of Rohit Sharma 's fastest T20I hundred by an Indian by just two deliveries.Abhishek continues in the video, ""I know he (Rohit) holds the record, I know that on my day even if the first ball is there to hit, I will hit and today was my day so I am very grateful. The way Suryakumar Yadav and Gautam Gambhir have supported me, it looks like they have more trust in me than I have in myself. So obviously it is a big motivation and when the captain and the coach say that an aggressive intent should be there, I like it coming from them. With that kind of support, I would say similar days are just around the corner for other youngsters also.""Abhishek was brutal in his knock and, with Tilak Varma (24), took 25 runs from one Jamie Overton over, the pair putting on 115 runs for the second wicket.Abhishek also took two wickets in the only over he bowled with left-arm spin as India bowled out England for 97 for their second biggest T20 victory by runs.Also See: ICC Champions Trophy Fixtures 2025 Talking about the Wankhede crowd, Abhishek said, ""The crowd here supports India all the time whatever match it is and I would say it's one of my lucky grounds.""India and England now head into three one-day internationals series starting February 6 in Nagpur.The series is a warm-up for the 50-over Champions Trophy starting February 19 in Pakistan and Dubai.","Abhishek Sharma hit 135 to set up India's crushing 150-run win over England.

Will Rohit Sharma win another ICC trophy? Here's what the horoscope says

Washington DC based Indian American tech tycoon Sanjay Govil is all set to acquire a large chunk of minority stake in Welsh Fire franchise in The Hundred competition . Govil is set to acquire 49% stake for £33m after his winning bid valued the franchise at £67.5m. This is Govil’s second major cricketing acquisition in his two-year foray in the cricket world after launching the Washington Freedom in the MLC.Govil’s Welsh Fire acquisition appears to be a calculated business move given that it likely will turn out to be the most affordable franchise to acquire while still benefiting from an evenly divided broadcast revenue. With three franchise bidding wars to go the team valuations have ranged from Welsh Fire’s £67.5m to London Spirit’s £295m.However Govil claims that there is more to it than just pure business dynamics. “It is not your usual arranged marriage. It began with dating, followed by engagement and then marriage!(laughs),” said Govil.It is the human touch at Glamorgan he claims that struck a chord with him.“They are really nice people. I felt a real chemistry. The way the chairman Mark Rhydderch and the rest of his group followed up on our plans, I felt they really wanted us. They took the pains to come visit me in London during Christman time during my last visit in England. Very warm and very supportive. It was always our first choice.”Govil credits Glamorgan legend and veteran broadcaster Alan Wilkins for getting the ball rolling with the county. Wilkins met Govil during his commentary stint at the inaugural edition of the MLC in 2023.Wilkins wittily remarked ‘Fire meets Freedom’. Which resonated well with me. Our initials match too. Washington Freedom is WF and so is Welsh Fire. Welsh Fire was also our captain Steve Smith’s first Hundred franchise.Govil sounded optimistic when being quizzed about Washington Freedom’s head coach Ricky Ponting ’s involvement with the Welsh Fire. Possible. Why not? Why not Travis Head? Why not Steve Smith or even Andries Gous? Why not other Freedom players at Fire and why not Fire players at the Freedom? I consider all my players and coaches as a family.English cricket raised some alarm bells after a galaxy of international stars prioritised MLC over the Hundred amidst overlapping schedules. However Govil’s vision of bringing synergies between his MLC and Hundred teams and the added presence of a few MLC franchise owners at the Hundred may finally mean an end to the uncertainty around distinct windows for both the leagues.“One of the reasons we were interested in the Hundred was it runs back to back after the MLC. It gives our players an opportunity to play back to back in two tournaments. The idea is to plan out the schedule that way especially with MI being there and along with a bunch of other MLC guys. I can go to a player and tell him I’ll sign you for X dollars here and X dollars over there within a couple of months. Building those synergies do help,” Goyal added.While Govil did manage to acquire 49% equity in the Welsh Fire franchise that the ECB decided to disinvest from, there is a high possibility the exclusive negotiations that he and Glamorgan are set to enable a controlling stake for Govil in the franchise. He is counting on their ‘chemistry’ to be a decisive factor in firming up the ownership ledger of the franchise.“Each investor is expected to work with their respective counties to come up with their ownership percentages. There are counties who want to sell 100%, 70% or even 50%. What you are seeing in the press is 49% because that is what the ECB is selling. But that doesn’t mean that is the end of it. We will do what is in the best interest of the team and club. That is where chemistry is critical.”Govil grew up in Delhi before moving to the US to build his tech empire. He is the chairman of Infinite Computer Solutions (a tech consulting firm) and Zyter (a health tech firm).",Sanjay Govil is set to acquire a large chunk of minority stake in Welsh Fire franchise in The Hundred competition.

On his leadership experience with the Desert Viper

'Still back the boys 100%': Lockie Ferguson's message after Desert Vipers' loss to Dubai Capitals

On RCB’s IPL 2024, where they came back from the dead to qualify for the playoffs

On linking up with

as part of Punjab Kings for IPL 2025

On the fast bowlers’ fraternity

On the remarkable returns he’s had in the past year (T20 economy of 7.00 and average of 16.8, against career figures of 7.7 and 22.4)

On the 2019 World Cup

Speed is Lockie Ferguson’s trademark. His bowling is among the quickest in the world, and even his captaincy career has taken off with velocity. Ferguson led New Zealand against Bangladesh for three ODIs in September 2023, but it is as leader of the Desert Vipers in ILT20 2025 that his captaincy has really come to the fore.For the first time in the ILT20, the Vipers have ended the league stage at the top of the table, with 7 wins in 10 games. They will now go into the playoffs with two chances at making the final. At the end of the league stage of the ILT20, Ferguson spoke to the media on a range of topics including his captaincy experience, the IPL , and even the 2019 World Cup.Joining this group, it was very easy for me. They’ve done a lot of work in the previous years in building a great environment for players to play in. The coaching staff with Moods ( Tom Moody ) and Fossy ( James Foster ) and Maka (Neil McKenzie) and Crowy (Carl Crowe) have really created an environment where players are enjoying their cricket.With that, they’ve obviously signed some pretty experienced players which certainly makes my job a lot easier. When we’re talking about bowling plans and guys have played in these conditions a lot before, or similar conditions back home and understand what works best here and make quick adjustments. So from my point of view, it’s been nice to join this group and try to add value where I see fit and also try to encourage guys to express their strengths. I really enjoyed the support that I’ve had from not only the coaching staff but also the players.Certainly a great tournament to be a part of. A tough start for the team that year. At times we were only losing by little margins here and there. We know in the IPL how small moments can change the whole game. Probably really hard to nail down exactly what it was, but certainly from my point of view, learning from Faf (du Plessis) and Andy (Flower) about how they managed that situation… Great learning and understanding of, you know when a team is struggling, how to control the environment, and how to encourage players.You’re just learning as quickly as possible from the last game. Also try to read other games and see what is working that year. I think for fast bowlers and bowlers in general, the IPL last year was pretty challenging. A lot of runs were scored. So adjustments needed to be made. And sometimes, they’re just small adjustments that actually build pressure from both ends.We managed to find a bit of a formula with the team last year into the backend. You can see how just a small bit of confidence can change a team. But again, I don’t think that just happened by chance. It was certainly led by Faf. His demeanour throughout the competition was very similar: whether we were losing or winning didn’t matter. He’s a very even leader.Virat (Kohli) was the same. The conversation teams were having in the changing rooms were controlled. We knew that we were short in a few areas at the start of the competition, and then we tried to adjust them and managed to do that and had some success and just rolled with it.Teams I’ve played in the past have ridden the emotions too much. It’s very difficult to go deep into the tournament (if you do that), because we know the game of cricket throws plenty of curveballs at you, and sometimes it’s out of your control. But it’s also why the game is so exciting because it can change at any point.There’s a lot to learn. I’ve been privileged in my career to play under some great captains, and I think there are some similarities in their demeanour when things are going well and when things are tough.I had Ricky with Washington Freedom, which was really exciting. He comes with such a high pedigree of cricket skill, and also his leadership and his knowledge around the game. It’s nice to talk to batters about what I’m thinking in the bowling sense in the moment, and then get feedback from them.The best thing about these franchise tournaments is, I grew up watching Ricky and thinking how incredible he is and now I get the opportunity to talk to him about cricket and what I think works and how he thinks my skill-sets fit into it. He’s obviously a keen golfer as well, so hopefully I’ll get a few fore-balls with him and can talk some golf and cricket at the same time! But yeah, really looking forward to joining him in a month or so.I’ve had some great conversations with Mohammad Amir , who has had so much experience in this part of the world. It’s nice to talk to him about how he builds his overs, understands when it’s time to attack and when it’s time to defend and get out of the over.It’s a very special fraternity, the fast bowlers’ fraternity. We’re happy to share with each other even if we’re not playing in the same team, which I think is awesome. It’s something I really try to tap into and certainly when I’m talking with young fast bowlers, I’m more than happy to pass on the knowledge that I have learned.It’s nice to have some good games. I’m just constantly trying to get better and trying to learn from other fast bowlers and coaches about my game and trying to make small adjustments. Constantly trying to deliver the ball differently and trying to deceive the batters in different ways. It’s such a fast-moving sport, and if you’re not moving forward, you can get left behind. You can see in this competition (the ILT20) how skilled the batters are, and how quickly they’re learning to play on the wickets that we’ve been playing on.It's been nice to have some good results in the last year, but probably more so than that I’ve been part of some really awesome teams. RCB was a great franchise to play for. I was with Sydney Thunder, and they just came short in the final (in BBL 2024-25). Huge turnaround for that group of players and a really enjoyable group to play with it.And then the Desert Vipers, it’s been so nice to just fit into the group. We’ve got such a great environment here and you can see why players are wanting to succeed. Obviously, we know the Black Caps is an awesome environment to play in too. We won the championship with the Washington Freedom (in MLC 2024). I don’t think it’s a fluke that I’ve had success because the environment those teams created allowed players to express themselves with confidence, and enjoy playing the game.I still have fond memories of the 2019 World Cup, even though it didn’t quite go our way in the end. But those couple of months were a big turning point in my career I think from a confidence point of view. Just how far our team went… you know we weren’t regarded as a top team in that tournament and we managed to make it to the final and whatever happened, happened. But I still look back on it very fondly from my personal growth and learning about the game. It was nice to have a little bit of success there. I’ve been fortunate that I’ve been part of some pretty successful teams. Hopefully, this week I’ll be able to say there was a great memory from this week.","Lockie Ferguson is the captain of the Desert Vipers in ILT20 2025.

Will Rohit Sharma win another ICC trophy? Here's what the horoscope says

MUMBAI: Former England captain Kevin Pietersen is mighty pleased with how India’s multiple investors and IPL team owners bought a stake in teams in a recently-conducted auction by the England & Wales Cricket Board ( ECB ) for teams in ‘The Hundred’ in the UK recently.Talking to reporters at an event, Pietersen said that it was obvious to anybody that it was India who was calling the shots in the game, and felt that the cash infusion would only be good for the English game.“At the end of the day, you are an absolute idiot if you don’t think that India runs the world of cricket and anyone arguing against that clearly is deluded. So, actually when you see what India is doing for global cricket, the amount of cash that's been injected into English cricket these last couple of weeks, it's amazing, brilliant for world and English cricket,” Pietersen said.“I think it's amazing what's happening in English cricket because there's a lot of the counties in English cricket that are really struggling. And so now with this cash injection and the majority of it, (of course, is Indian-based, it's amazing. Look at what they've done in South Africa.

Will Rohit Sharma win another ICC trophy? Here's what the horoscope says

MUMBAI: With his blistering innings of 54-ball 135 against England at the Wankhede Stadium in the fifth and final T20I on Sunday, Abhishek Sharma won the hearts of many. Amongst those blown away by the Indian opener's relentless blitzkrieg is former England captain Kevin Pietersen , who is here for commentary duties.After his blazing knock, the talented youngster received the ultimate compliment from 'KP,' who told the 24-year-old that it ""was the best innings that I have ever seen.""""He didn't tell me anything. He said 'Thank you' because I said to him that that was the best innings I have ever seen. The strokeplay was phenomenal. There was no hanky panky-reverse sweep, scooping, sweeping, ramping, rubbish. It was the most unbelievable strokeplay. It was the perfect innings. Not many T20 batters can play the perfect innings. That was the perfect innings, that too at the Wankhede where it bounces and it's fast. You have Sanju Samson who walks back onto his stumps and is intimidated by the short ball. Abhishek is running at (Jofra) Archer. It's just phenomenal. I'm so happy for him,"" Pietersen gushed about Sharma while talking to reporters at an event on Tuesday at the Mahalaxmi Racecourse.Pointing out a particular quality which impressed him about Abhishek's innings, Pietersen said, ""He has a very good eye.""While terming mystery spinner Varun Chakarvarthy's inclusion on Tuesday in India's ODI team for the upcoming series against England as a ""very good decision,"" the South Africa-born former England batsman pointed out that England's batters would play the tweaker, who took 14 wickets in the just-concluded T20I series at an average of just 9.85, ""better"" as they would get more time against him in the 50-over format.“The English batters would be better against him in the one-daters because they can spend more time. It’s a longer format, not every ball is an event and I think it is a great decision (to add Chakravarthy),” Pietersen said.'Virat, Rohit must be celebrated, deserve respect'Pietersen felt that India's senior pros Virat Kohli and Indian captain Rohit Sharma too, who are currently out of form, ""should be celebrated"" and deserve more respect"" for their sheer achievements.""I played 104 Test matches, and scored 23 Test hundreds. That means one in four or five Test matches was good (for me). You guys need to understand (that) these guys are human beings. When they look back at their career, you give them bamboo now, but at the end of their careers, you look back and (think) how did they make you feel when they played? They made people feel happy. It's not all about statistics, it's not all about winning or not about losing, and when you finish your career like I did, people talk to me about how I made them feel when I played. Virat and Rohit make people feel amazing. So, they should be celebrated, (when) they get to 36, 37, 38. I always feel those kinds of players should be celebrated. People shouldn't be giving them a constant stink. I think it's unfair. How can you tell somebody who scored as many runs as these guys that they must retire. Yes, it's a discussion and it's a topic...I get it, I understand it, but they deserve more respect than that,"" asserted Pietersen.",Kevin Pietersen says Abhishek Sharma's 135 against England was the best innings he has ever seen.

NEW DELHI: Chennai Singams secured a commanding seven-wicket victory against Falcons Risers Hyderabad in an Indian Street Premier League ( ISPL ) match at the Dadoji Kondadev Stadium in Thane on Tuesday.The Singams efficiently chased down the modest target of 65 runs with 2.5 overs remaining in their innings.Opening batter Ketan Mhatre set the tone with an aggressive innings of 35 runs from 12 deliveries, including two fours and four sixes, dismantling the Hyderabad bowling attack.Following Mhatre's departure, Jagannath Sarkar contributed 23 runs from 17 deliveries, whilst Prashant Gharat sealed the victory with a boundary.After choosing to field first, Chennai's decision proved effective immediately when Anurag Sarshar removed both Aakash Jangid and Prabjot Singh in the opening over.Liton Sarkar joined Kisan Satpute at the crease, and together they attempted to stabilise the Hyderabad innings after the early setbacks.Their 28-run partnership ended when Kisan was bowled by Venkatachalapathi Vignesh, failing to judge the bounce correctly.Sarkar top-scored for the Falcons with 18 runs from 13 balls, whilst Kisan made 10 from 12. Vishwajit Thakur (11) and Parveen Kumar (10) made valuable contributions at the end, helping the Falcons reach 64-9 in their allocated 10 overs.Mohammad Zeeshan was Chennai's most effective bowler, taking 3 wickets for 13 runs.Batting first, the Tiigers of Kolkata posted a competitive 84/8, thanks to a brisk start from Sarfaraz Khan and a late-order blitz by Bhavesh Pawar.Sarfaraz set the tone with a quickfire 27 off 20 balls, smashing a four and two sixes before Kolkata lost momentum due to Srinagar’s disciplined bowling attack.However, Bhavesh’s explosive finish shifted the momentum, as he hammered five towering sixes and a boundary in an unbeaten 39 off just 15 balls, propelling his team to a fighting total.For Srinagar, Suvronil Roy was the standout bowler, claiming 3/17, while Sahil Longale chipped in with 2/6.In response, in-form Sagar Ali singlehandedly guided Srinagar to victory with a blistering half-century, ensuring the chase was completed with 10 balls to spare.Opening the innings, he dominated from the outset, denying Kolkata any chance of a comeback. Sagar’s unbeaten 51 off 25 balls, laced with three sixes and five boundaries, laid the foundation for a smooth chase alongside skipper Mangesh Vaity, who contributed 15. Sanskar Dhyani sealed the win in style with a massive six.On Wednesday, KVN Bangalore Strikers will take on Chennai Singams, while Falcon Rising Hyderabad will face Majhi Mumbai.",Chennai Singams beat Falcons Risers Hyderabad by seven wickets.

Rohit Sharma's batting in ODIs has been game changing: Shubman Gill

The performance of India's young top-order batters has made competition for places stiffer, but Shubman Gill believes that hasn't led to any toxicity among the contenders.With Rohit Sharma in the twilight of his career and already retired from T20Is, the performances of Abhishek Sharma Yashasvi Jaiswal and Gill himself has led to competition for the opening spot, especially in white-ball cricket . But the 25-year-old Gill asserts it's not ""toxic"".""Abhishek is a childhood friend of mine. Jaiswal is also a friend, I don't think there is any toxic competition between us. Obviously if you are playing for the country, you want to perform in every match, and not think that 'I wish this guy doesn't perform',"" said Gill, who has been appointed the vice-captain of the ODI team as India take on England in a three-match series, followed by the ICC Champions Trophy.Both Gill and Jaiswal have been named in the squad, while Abhishek Sharma emerged as the top-scorer in the five-match T20I series against England with 279 runs at a strike rate of 219.69 and average of 55.80.Jaiswal, however, is yet to make his ODI debut and has played 23 T20Is so far. But his Test career has taken off like a bullet train, with 1798 runs in 36 innings, including four centuries -- two of which he turned into consecutive double hundreds -- and 10 fifties.Talking about captain Rohit, who has been in poor form since the start of the season, Gill said, ""The way Rohit bhai has been batting in the ODIs in the past one year and a half, it's been really game-changing for us. Taking the momentum right through from the start and taking the game away from ball one, it makes the job of the non-striker and the batters coming in a bit easier; and I think it has helped our team a lot.""On the subject of team selection and the debate around Karun Nair being ignored despite having a stellar run in the domestic circuit, Gill said too much chopping and changing creates an insecure environmentNair averaged 389.50 in the Vijay Hazare Trophy, but was not considered for the Champions Trophy.Gill said a secure team environment gives a lot of confidence to the players.""Karun had a great Vijay Hazare Trophy, but that doesn't mean the current players should be dropped. They have also performed well to reach this stage,"" said the Indian vice-captain.""We have lost only one game in the World Cups. The players in the squad have contributed significantly, and while it's unfortunate for those excelling in domestic cricket who weren't picked, constant chopping and changing will affect players' confidence. Without continuity, we can never build a strong team.""",Shubman Gill says there is no toxic competition between Abhishek Sharma and Yashasvi Jaiswal.

Will Rohit Sharma win another ICC trophy? Here's what the horoscope says

NEW DELHI: England's wicketkeeper Jamie Smith is doubtful for the initial two ODIs against India owing to calf problems, though he should recover for the Champions Trophy.Smith experienced calf discomfort during England's lone victory in the third T20I at Rajkot. Having replaced Jacob Bethell in the second and third T20Is, he subsequently missed two matches as India secured the series 4-1.A Daily Mail report indicates that the 24-year-old will undergo a fitness assessment in the tour's final match at Ahmedabad next Wednesday, coinciding with the deadline for submitting Champions Trophy squads to the International Cricket Council (ICC).While Joe Root has arrived for the ODI series , Smith's unavailability restricts their batting choices. Root was supposed to take Rehan Ahmed 's place, but the spinner has been retained for the ODI matches.During the T20I series, England consistently deployed four pace bowlers alongside Adil Rashid, whereas India utilised up to five spinners in a single innings.Following the T20I series defeat, Saqib Mahmood is likely to feature in the opening ODI at Rajkot.

NEW DELHI: In a captivating encounter at Stamford Bridge, Chelsea overturned a deficit to secure a 2-1 victory against West Ham in the Premier League 's latest London derby.This triumph, marking only their second in eight matches, propelled Chelsea into the fourth position in the league standings, positioning them two points clear of Manchester City and trailing Nottingham Forest by four points. Meanwhile, West Ham's challenges persist as they stay in 15th place.The match saw the return of England forward Jarrod Bowen for West Ham after a six-game absence due to a foot injury.Bowen made a significant impact, putting West Ham ahead shortly before the half-time break.The opportunity arose from a misjudged back pass by Levi Colwill, which Bowen capitalized on with a precise left-footed shot that found the net, beating Chelsea's goalkeeper Filip Jørgensen.Jørgensen was in the lineup in place of Robert Sanchez, who was sidelined due to a dip in form.Chelsea's response came in the 64th minute, amidst a period when West Ham appeared to be gaining the upper hand. Enzo Fernandez's attempt was initially thwarted on the goal line, but Pedro Neto, coming on as a substitute, managed to score on the rebound.The goal stood following a prolonged review and despite protests from West Ham players who alleged a foul on Bowen during the lead-up to the goal.The decisive moment for Chelsea came with 16 minutes remaining when Cole Palmer's attempt from a challenging angle was inadvertently deflected into West Ham's net by defender Aaron Wan-Bissaka, tilting the outcome in Chelsea's favour.Post-match, Jarrod Bowen expressed disappointment, highlighting the effort put forth by West Ham.""Just disappointed to be leading and lose the game,"" Bowen said. ""We left everything out there. We came to a side who are pushing for top four, pushing for the title.

NEW DELHI: The January transfer window witnessed significant activity from several top clubs as they sought to bolster their squads for the remainder of the season and beyond.Manchester City, the four-time defending Premier League champions, made a late splash by securing the services of Porto midfielder Nico Gonzalez for a reported fee of $60 million.This move was aimed at addressing the void left by the long-term injury to their defensive midfield lynchpin, Rodri.Aston Villa, currently competing in the Champions League , also made notable additions to their attacking ranks. They secured the loan signing of Marco Asensio from Real Madrid until the end of the season, adding Champions League-winning experience to their squad.Additionally, Villa acquired Marcus Rashford on loan from Manchester United, a player who had fallen out of favour but possesses immense potential to contribute to their European and domestic campaigns.Elsewhere, the uncertainty surrounding Bayern Munich forward Mathys Tel was resolved as he completed a loan move to Tottenham Hotspur, with the option of a permanent deal in the summer.Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) were one of the busiest clubs during the window, signing Khvicha Kvaratskhelia from Napoli for a reported $72 million, while also offloading several players, including Randal Kolo Muani, Milan Skriniar, and Asensio.Manchester City's spending spree, which exceeded $200 million, was a bid to salvage a campaign that had unravelled towards the end of the previous year and was further derailed by a 5-1 loss to Arsenal.In addition to Gonzalez, City acquired Egypt forward Omar Marmoush, defenders Abdukodir Khusanov and Vitor Reis, and young left-back Christian McFarlane from their sister club, New York City FC.PSG's acquisition of Kvaratskhelia represents a return to their previous strategy of marquee signings, albeit with a focus on younger talents rather than established superstars.This move comes after the departures of high-profile players like Lionel Messi, Neymar, and Kylian Mbappé in recent years.The Saudi Arabian league also made headlines, with Jhon Duran joining Al-Nassr from Aston Villa for a reported $80 million.However, the highly anticipated move of Neymar to Al-Hilal was cut short, as the Brazilian's contract was terminated, and he returned to his boyhood club, Santos.In the women's game, significant deals were also made, with US defender Naomi Girma becoming the first million-dollar player in the women's game as she moved from the San Diego Wave to Chelsea.The Blues also spent heavily to bring England midfielder Keira Walsh back to the Women's Super League from Barcelona.","The January transfer window witnessed significant activity from several top clubs.

NEW DELHI: Spanish women's national team forward Jenni Hermoso testified on Monday at the trial of Luis Rubiales , the former president of the Spanish Football Federation .The trial revolves around an incident that occurred during the 2023 Women's World Cup final presentation ceremony, where Rubiales kissed Hermoso without her consent.In her testimony, Hermoso stated that she did not consent to the kiss and felt disrespected by Rubiales's actions. “I felt disrespected,” Hermoso said. It ""stained one of the happiest days of my life.”She also revealed that she felt coerced to publicly exonerate Rubiales after the incident, but she refused to do so.Rubiales, who was present in the Madrid High Court, is facing charges of sexual assault and attempting to coerce Hermoso and others to publicly support him. He has denied the charges, claiming that the kiss was consensual and occurred in a ""moment of jubilation"".However, Hermoso firmly stated that Rubiales did not ask for her consent before kissing her.The incident sparked outrage in Spain and beyond, highlighting the prevalence of sexism in sports and society. Facing immense pressure, Rubiales resigned three weeks after the incident and was banned by FIFA for three years. He had previously claimed to be the victim of a ""witch hunt"" by ""false feminists"".Prosecutors, Hermoso, and the Spain players' association are seeking a prison sentence of two and a half years for Rubiales, a payment of 50,000 euros ($51,800) for damages, and a ban from working as a sports official.Hermoso celebrated the World Cup victory with her teammates after the kiss, but she clarified that she chose to celebrate the trophy win like any footballer would, as it was an important moment for her.The trial is expected to last at least 10 days, with nearly 20 witnesses expected to testify, including Spain's men's national coach Luis de la Fuente and some of Hermoso's teammates, such as former world player of the year Alexia Putellas.In addition to Rubiales, former Spain women's national coach Jorge Vilda, former sports director of the Spain men's team Albert Luque, and the federation's former head of marketing, Rubén Rivera, are also on trial. They are accused of allegedly pressuring Hermoso to defend Rubiales publicly in a statement after the incident, which she refused to do.Hermoso expressed that her life was put on standby after the incident and the ensuing controversy, and she was able to escape the spotlight by playing for a club in Mexico. The incident overshadowed Spain's first Women's World Cup triumph and triggered protests and widespread condemnation.","Spanish women's national team forward Jenni Hermoso testified on Monday at the trial of Luis Rubiales.

Five-star Arsenal crush woeful Manchester City to keep title bid alive,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/epl/top-stories/five-star-arsenal-crush-woeful-manchester-city-to-keep-title-bid-alive/articleshow/117872856.cms,"NEW DELHI: With a 5-1 thumping of a miserable Manchester City on Sunday, Arsenal maintained their hopes of winning the Premier League title, while the struggling champions suffered yet another setback in their terrible season.Following Liverpool's 2-0 victory over Bournemouth on Saturday, which put them nine points ahead of the Gunners, Mikel Arteta 's team had no room for mistake in the title fight.After 103 seconds at the Emirates Stadium, Martin Odegaard's first goal emboldened them to go on a spectacular display.Shortly after halftime, Erling Haaland scored his 25th goal of the season across all competitions to tie the score for City.However, when Thomas Partey took advantage of Phil Foden's shoddy pass to put Arsenal back ahead, the thoughtless errors that have plagued City over a lackluster season proved to be the difference.Kai Havertz and Ethan Nwaneri's late goals and Myles Lewis-Skelly's debut goal for Arsenal completed a brilliant performance that saw the Gunners get within six points of Liverpool.Although Arsenal's strong performance increased their undefeated streak to 14 games and demonstrated their desire to fight the Reds to the end, Liverpool's game in hand maintains them comfortably in charge of the title race.City's six-game winning streak in the top tier came to a cruel end, and they have now lost all four of their league encounters with Arsenal.After their miserable season, City's hopes of winning a fifth straight crown were long since dashed, and now Pep Guardiola's fourth-place team is concentrating on making it to the Champions League However, unless Guardiola can address the glaring gaps in his defense and the lack of energy in his midfield, even that might be beyond them, let alone defeating Real Madrid in this season's playoff round.Abdukodir Khusanov, a former Lens defender who made a clumsy start against Chelsea last weekend, was replaced by John Stones by Guardiola.Stones, however, was a part of the disastrous defense that gave Arsenal the lead in the second minute.Stones put his fellow defender in a tight spot with a pass to the marked Manuel Akanji.Leandro Trossard robbed Akanji right away, and with City's defense in disarray, Kai Havertz picked out Odegaard, who then slotted home from ten yards out.Guardiola marched thunderously back to the bench, already fearing the worst.The frustrated Guardiola made a variety of furious gestures as a result of City controlling possession but being toothless for extended periods of time.During the tempestuous 2-2 draw earlier this season, Haaland infuriated Arsenal by instructing Arteta to ""stay humble"" and hurling the ball at Gunners defender Gabriel Magalhaes.Unsurprisingly, Haaland scored City's equalizer in the 55th minute.Haaland had the opportunity to sneak in front of William Saliba and bury his close-range header after Savinho's excellently weighted cross.However, it only took Arsenal two minutes to make Haaland stop smiling.After Partey intercepted Foden's pass, the Ghanaian midfielder launched a strong long-range shot that struck Stones with a deft deflection.In the 62nd minute, Lewis-Skelly went for the kill as Arsenal smelt blood.The 18-year-old left-back cut inside the City area and curled a beautiful finish into the far corner with elegance that belied his inexperience.Lewis-Skelly mimicked the City star's contemplative celebration by sitting down with his legs crossed to mark the goal in a playful jab at Haaland.The much-maligned Havertz scored in the 76th minute, adding to the suffering of shell-shocked City.After stomping through City's flimsy defense, Gabriel Martinelli set up Havertz for a clinical 10-yard finish.Nwaneri, a young forward, struck the final punch deep into stoppage time with a brilliant goal into the far corner from a sharp angle.For the second time in a humiliating day, City had no answer to the taunts of ""you're getting sacked in the morning"" from Arsenal supporters directed at Guardiola.","Arsenal maintained their hopes of winning the Premier League title with a 5-1 thumping of a miserable Manchester City.

NEW DELHI: Liverpool on Saturday secured a 2-0 victory at Bournemouth with Mohamed Salah 's disputed penalty, extending their lead to nine points in the Premier League The opening goal came through Salah's penalty after Cody Gakpo appeared to fall over his own feet rather than from Lewis Cook's challenge.The decision sparked outrage from Bournemouth after referee Darren England's initial call was supported by VAR.""The referee's call of penalty was checked and confirmed by VAR – with the challenge deemed to have been a trip by Cook on Gakpo. The VAR also confirmed Gakpo was onside in the build-up,"" the Premier League said in a statement.Salah later scored his second goal in the match, further extending Liverpool's advantage over Arsenal in second place.The Egyptian forward has now scored 21 goals in 23 league appearances this season, achieving the 20-goal milestone for the fifth time in his Premier League career.With 178 Premier League goals, Salah has moved ahead of Frank Lampard into sixth place on the all-time scoring list.Liverpool have not lost in 19 league matches, winning 17 of their 23 games since Arne Slot took over from Jurgen Klopp before the season began.Liverpool, pursuing their 20th title and first since 2020, await the outcome of Manchester City's match against Arsenal on Sunday.They face Tottenham in the League Cup semi-final second leg on Thursday, trying to overcome a 1-0 deficit.The only concern for Slot was an injury to England right-back Trent Alexander-Arnold in the second half.Bournemouth's impressive season included home victories over Manchester City and Arsenal, plus a 5-0 win against Nottingham Forest last week.Their 11-game unbeaten league run ended against a determined Liverpool side.The match began dramatically when Alexander-Arnold lost possession to Antoine Semenyo after 12 seconds, requiring a save from Alisson Becker.Alexander-Arnold's defensive struggles continued as his poor clearance allowed Justin Kluivert through on goal before Alisson made another save.Semenyo managed to evade two defenders and hit the woodwork with a powerful shot.Liverpool showed their attacking prowess with Kepa Arrizabalaga saving Dominik Szoboszlai's attempt.The controversial opening goal came in the 30th minute when Cook appeared to make no contact with Gakpo before the penalty was given.Salah converted the penalty with confidence despite the controversy.Bournemouth's immediate response through David Brooks was ruled offside by VAR.Alisson continued his impressive performance by denying Semenyo in a one-on-one situation.The match saw more VAR involvement with checks for Alexander-Arnold's handball and Alexis Mac Allister's potential second yellow card for fouling Brooks.Marcus Tavernier hit the post with a long-range effort before Kluivert missed the rebound opportunity.Salah sealed the victory in the 75th minute, receiving Curtis Jones' pass and finishing skillfully past Kepa.",Liverpool beat Bournemouth 2-0 in Premier League.

NEW DELHI: Indian tennis player Sumit Nagal secured his place in the pre-quarterfinals following a resilient victory against Argentina's Renzo Olivo in a notable advancement at the 2025 Rosario Challenger .The match concluded with scores of 5-7, 6-1, 6-0 in favour of Nagal, who is the eighth seed in the tournament. This victory marks a significant achievement for the 27-year-old Indian, displaying his ability to recover and dominate after an initial setback.Nagal's next opponent will be determined by the outcome of the match between Tseng Chun-hsin from Chinese Taipei and Bolivia's Hugo Dellien .This triumph comes at a crucial time for Nagal, who recently experienced a decline in his professional standing.Prior to this event, he had fallen out of the ATP top-100 rankings, a position he had maintained for 10 consecutive months since March 2024.This drop was attributed to a series of disappointing performances, with Nagal securing only three main draw victories in 18 tournaments since Wimbledon 2024.Despite this, his earlier entry into the top-100 in February 2024, following a commendable performance at a Grand Slam event, underscores his potential and skill on the international stage.In related developments within Indian tennis, veteran doubles player Rohan Bopanna , aged 44, has also experienced a setback, falling five places to No. 21 in the rankings.This decline followed an early exit from the Australian Open, where he was unable to defend the points from his previous championship win.Bopanna's attempt to retain his standing, alongside new partner Nicolas Barrientos, ended prematurely in the opening round of the competition.Other Indian players, including Sasikumar Mukund, Ramkumar Ramanathan, Karan Singh, and Aryan Shah, maintain their positions within the top-600 in singles rankings.In doubles, alongside Bopanna, players such as Yuki Bhambri, N Sriram Balaji, Rithvik Choudary Bollipalli, and Arjun Kadhe are within the top-100.","Indian tennis player Sumit Nagal secured his place in the pre-quarterfinals following a resilient victory against Argentina's Renzo Olivo.

Anand Amritraj slams Indian stars for skipping Davis Cup,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/anand-amritraj-slams-indian-stars-for-skipping-davis-cup/articleshow/117900335.cms,"MUMBAI: Former India Davis Cup captain Anand Amritaj has ripped into the country's top-ranked players who have recently turned down the chance to represent the nation in the prestigious team competition.India's expected demolition of minnows Togo in New Delhi on Sunday came without top singles player Sumit Nagal and Yuki Bhambri , the second ranked doubles player in the country.Nagal's case particularly garnered attention after the All India Tennis Association (Aita) had recently claimed that the 27-year-old had demanded an annual fee of $50,000 to play Davis Cup ties for India. The player defended his stand in a lengthy post on social media, saying ""it is standard practice in professional sports for athletes to be compensated for their participation in events, even when representing their country"".Amritraj , who worked with Nagal when he held the role of captain a few years ago, described the idea as ""inconceivable"".""To me personally, it is just inconceivable that if you are ranked high enough and the country wants you to play, that you would play without any financial compensation,"" Amritraj told reporters here on the sidelines of the L&T Mumbai Open at the Cricket Club of India on Monday.""Unless you are injured and you can't walk on the court, other than that, there should be no question that you're going to play Davis Cup. Same for me, same for Vijay,"" he added, referring to his brother with whom he helped India reach the 1974 Davis Cup finals against South Africa.""Both of us felt that it is the greatest honour that you can have to play for your country. Maybe this is old-school thinking, but that is absolutely how it should be.""You got 50 weeks in the year to make money, two weeks of the year, you should be able to give to places you grew up in, and it should be an honour and a privilege.""On Nagal's case, the 73-yearold said: ""I like Sumit, when I was captain he was the reserve on my team five years ago. I got along very well with him, but he didn't play the last tie (vs Sweden in Sept) either, which is really a shame because he is our best player right now.""Asked if there should be strong repercussions for players who choose to not turn up for national team duties, Amritraj said it was a tricky situation as players could always lean on the ""independence of the ATP Tour "" to make their decisions.With some Indian players, however, enjoying government funding through programmes like the Target Olympic Podium Scheme (TOPS), it could be a way for Aita to crack the whip, Amritraj felt.""That's where you should put the screws on them. I think you should definitely do that. If you're in any kind of place with some leverage, you should say: 'Either you play Davis Cup, or you won't get this'. Simple.""","Top-ranked players Sumit Nagal and Yuki Bhambri turned down chance to represent India.

CHENNAI: Indian tennis is not going through the best of times. While its top-ranked singles player Sumit Nagal has made good strides in recent years, the rest of the crop has struggled in the journey to the top.The player distribution in the Chennai Open Challenger best explains the current scenario. Even in a home tournament, India, in the absence of Nagal, is forced to rely on wildcards for main-draw singles entries as the next-best players from the country find it difficult to directly make the cut. Davis Cuppers Mukund Sasikumar (ranked 365), Ramkumar Ramanathan (406) and Karan Singh will have a point to prove after being awarded wildcards by the organisers.The onus will be on the experienced Ramkumar and Mukund to gain valuable points to move up in the rankings chart. The 28-year-old Mukund had a good run in Chennai last year, reaching the quarterfinals, but could not carry forward the momentum in the tournaments that followed. Ramkumar’s story in the past few years has not been much different, with the 30-year-old’s inconsistency hampering his chances to move to a higher level. Youngster Karan has shown promise in the early stages of his career and is steadily rising up the ladder.Moving to foreign interest, quite a few players are looking to resurrect their careers and compete in the Grand Slams. For instance, Lloyd Harris, who is the second seed in singles, was once ranked as high as 31 and reached the quarterfinals of the US Open in 2021. Injury issues forced the South African to stay away from action for quite a long period and the 27-year-old will compete in his first match since the Wimbledon last year.Former world No. 35 Jiri Vesely had to sit out in 2023 due to injury concerns. The 31-year-old had won the ATP 250 title in Pune in 2020 and had a good time in India in the past. Ahead of the Chennai Open, Vesely said: “Preparations have been good and I am getting used to the weather, but it is not easy. It is always nice to be in India and people are very friendly and supportive. I love coming back here and I hope to have a good run on this trip.”Vesely dropped outside the top-600 a few years ago and since then, he has found it tough to be back to his best. “I wish to move up and it is not easy. A lot of youngsters are playing well and I need to compete with them and give my best.”","India's top-ranked singles player Sumit Nagal has made good strides in recent years.

CHENNAI: Italian tennis player Jacopo Berrettini does not have to look far for inspiration. The 26-year-old shares a strong bond with his elder brother Matteo Berrettini , a former top-10 singles player and 2021 Wimbledon finalist, whom he regards not only his best friend but also his idol.“I have a good relationship with him. He is a very good human, and I am so glad and lucky to have him. Apart from on-court training, he mentors me off the field and is a good coach. We shared the same (coaching) team for the past three years and now share the same trainer. Before coming here, we trained together for three days in Rome,” Jacopo, who will begin his season at the Chennai Open Challenger , told TOI on Saturday.Jacopo and Matteo had a tough 2023 as their seasons were marred by injuries. Matteo had to take a six-month break, while Jacopo had to miss the majority of the year. In that period, the Berrettini brothers helped each other stay mentally strong. “It was a very tough period for us, for our family. We were trying to be the humans that we are, trying to stay mentally focused and healthy. We had to work a lot after recovery because this sport is so tough mentally and physically. We were trying to enjoy life outside the sport as it is very important as well. After suffering from a lot of injuries, Matteo had a good season last year,” Jacopo added.While Jacopo and Matteo do not spend much time together due to their playing commitments, they are always in touch. “We try to talk often and as much as we can. Sometimes, we train together, but if we are not able to spend a lot of time, it is okay since we travel and play regularly. We are healthy and that is a good thing for us.”‘Aim to carry forward momentum’: Jacopo had a productive season last year and achieved his career-best singles ranking of 317. The Italian will look to carry forward the momentum, starting with his season opener in Chennai. “It was a good year (2024) for me, playing many matches without any injury concerns. I worked on many aspects and will try to keep going. My goal for this year is to compete in the qualifiers of the Grand Slams, for which I have to get close to the 230 mark (rankings).”",Italian tennis player Jacopo Berrettini shares a strong bond with his elder brother Matteo.

The hosts, who had taken a commanding 2-0 lead by winning the first two singles on the opening day of the tie on Saturday, completed the formality with two dominant wins - in doubles and singles - on Sunday. The fifth rubber was not played. The World Group 1 tie would be played in September later this year and the name of their opponents would be announced later.The doubles pair of Sriram Balaji and Davis Cup debutant Rithvik Bollipalli put the hosts ahead in the fourth game when they broke M'lapa Akomlo, the substitute for regular player Thomas Setodji who pulled out with an injury. Akomlo proved to be the weak link as the Indians, playing some smart tennis with clever ball placement and strong net presence, broke his service to take the set 6-2. The second set was even shorter as the Indians broke Akomlo and his partner Isak Padio once each to claim the set 6-1. The match lasted 57 minutes.With the tie secured, India gave rookie Karan Singh his Davis Cup debut in the dead rubber and the 21-year-old did not disappoint as he beat Isak, whom Togo fielded in place of original choice Setodji. The 20-year-old in fact put up the best show by a Togolese player on the trip as he stretched most of the games. He even managed to break Singh once in the second set as India won the match 6-2, 6-3 - the first instance when Togo won three games in a set on this tour.""I started playing tennis when I was an 11-year-old and I had no idea how far I would go. I just kept going day by day. And here we are today. And I really enjoyed playing the match today.

It's a little bit different from the regular matches that we play.""'Grooming future captain'Interestingly, once India won the doubles match and the Playoff, regular captain Rohit Rajpal took a backseat and allowed Mukund Sasikumar occupy the captain's chair during the fourth rubber, played by Karan Singh. The captain's chairs are placed next to the chair umpire so that the players could consult with the captains during game breaks. ""I always do that. Sometimes it's as important as grooming players. Sitting on that chair has a different kind of pressure you need that experience. It's good for them. They'll be the future captains.

NEW DELHI: Jasprit Bumrah 's return to competitive cricket may take a while longer. TOI has learnt that the ace fast bowler may miss the first week or two of the IPL and likely to join the Mumbai Indians camp only in April.Bumrah is undergoing rehab at the BCCI's Centre of Excellence (CoE) in Bengaluru after sitting out of the ongoing Champions Trophy due to a lower back injury.""Bumrah's medical reports are okay. He has resumed bowling at the CoE. However, it is unlikely he'll be able to bowl at the start of the IPL in another fortnight. As per current status, the first week of April looks a more realistic date for him to get back to high-intensity cricket,"" a BCCI source said.In that scenario, Bumrah is likely to miss the first three or four matches for MI. Bumrah, it is learnt, still hasn't started bowling full tilt. ""It's standard operating procedure. The medical team will gradually build up his workload and intensity. Unless he is able to bowl full tilt without any discomfort for some days, the medical team is unlikely to clear him,"" the source said.Incidentally, Lucknow Super Giants pacer Mayank Yadav , too, is expected to join the IPL in April.What needs to be factored in is that India have a tough five-Test tour of England immediately after the IPL. The eventual target is to have Bumrah fit for as many Tests in England as possible. With so much uncertainty around Rohit Sharma continuing as Test captain, Bumrah is seen as the frontrunner to lead the side if the selectors don't go for a younger captain, given the pacer's fitness concerns.It is learnt that with Bumrah and Mohammed Shami prone to injuries, the selectors don't want to plan the entire tour of England around these two seamers. ""How Shami and Bumrah endure the long IPL will be important. Shami is under constant watch. If the selectors get both of them together for two-three Tests, it will be the ideal situation. The team management will also be cautious of pushing the duo to pay all Tests together. Nobody wants either of them breaking down in the middle of a Test, like it happened with Bumrah in Sydney. Too much depended on Bumrah alone in Australia,"" sources said. Mohammed Siraj is almost certain to retain his Test place while Harshit Rana and Akash Deep will have to prove their worth. Mukesh Kumar and Arshdeep Singh will also be in the race. The India 'A' tour before the England Tests will be key.","Bumrah is undergoing rehab at the BCCI's Centre of Excellence (CoE) in Bengaluru.

Big injury scare for New Zealand as Matt Henry doubtful for Champions Trophy final

NEW DELHI: India's batting coach Sitanshu Kotak has hailed KL Rahul's adaptability, stating that his seamless transition to the No. 6 role has strengthened the team's batting depth.While Rahul had previously flourished at No. 5, he has willingly embraced the shift down the order since the ODI series against Sri Lanka last year.Rahul showcased his growing comfort in the Champions Trophy semifinal against Australia, playing a crucial unbeaten 42. Alongside Hardik Pandya , he added 34 quick runs to shut the door on Australia.Kotak praised Rahul's willingness to play any role the team requires. ""He is someone who can open, go at 4 or 5, and is now doing what No. 6 demands. He adapts well and is very happy in the role he is performing,"" he said.The coach emphasised how having a solid batter at No. 6 benefits the team. ""When he starts performing at that number, it obviously helps him too because he is adjusting to different situations. So, that is great for the team as well,"" Kotak explained. ""But whatever I have spoken to him, he is happy to do whatever the team requires, and he has been doing that.""Kotak also stressed that the Indian team is handling the pressure of the final well, thanks to the influence of senior players like Rohit Sharma Virat Kohli , Hardik Pandya, Mohammed Shami and Ravindra Jadeja.""The seniors, young players... they all talk. That is something very priceless,"" he said. ""They have 15-20 years of experience. They talk to the players who have been playing for two or three years. Some things you learn with experience, but listening to guys who have that experience and their 20 years of learning — that creates a great environment.""With Rahul excelling in his new role and experienced players keeping the dressing room calm, Team India looks well-prepared for the Champions Trophy final.",India's batting coach Sitanshu Kotak hails KL Rahul's adaptability.

NEW DELHI: India's Pranav Venkatesh clinched the World Junior Chess Championship (Under-20) following a draw against Slovenia's Matic Levrencic in the final round at Petrovac, Montenegro on Friday.The day proved exceptional for Indian chess as Aravindh Chithamabaram secured victory at the Prague Masters , surpassing several favoured competitors.Venkatesh, fresh from his victory in the challengers section at the Chennai International last year, maintained his impressive form amongst junior players globally, completing the tournament without a single defeat.With seven victories and four draws, he accumulated nine points from a possible 11. The final round pairings indicated that a draw would suffice for Venkatesh to secure the championship.Playing with black pieces, Levrencic chose the Sicilian defence, but the game took an unexpected turn when Venkatesh sacrificed a pawn early to gain developmental advantage.Facing a challenging position, the Slovenian opted for a cautious approach, agreeing to a draw after just 18 moves, positioning himself for either silver or gold medal. Viswanathan Anand expressed his appreciation for Venkatesh's outstanding achievement.""Congratulations to the World Junior Champion Pranav Venkatesh.He has been in great form lately.

NEW DELHI: Harleen Deol struck a dazzling half-century as Gujarat Giants secured their spot in the Women's Premier League Eliminator with a five-wicket victory over Delhi Capitals in Lucknow on Friday.Delhi Capitals, who had already qualified for the playoffs, posted a competitive total of 177 for five, riding on Lanning's outstanding 57-ball 92 that included 15 boundaries and a six.Gujarat's successful chase was then led by Harleen's unbeaten 70 runs off 49 balls and Beth Mooney's 44 runs from 35 balls.The finishing touches were provided by captain Ashleigh Gardner and Deandra Dottin, who scored 22 and 24 runs respectively.The win was Giants third in a row.Gujarat lost their first wicket early when Dayalan Hemalatha was caught by Lanning off Shikha Pandey's bowling.

Gautam Gambhir chases history! India coach targets maiden ICC trophy in first final

Big injury scare for New Zealand as Matt Henry doubtful for Champions Trophy final

NEW DELHI: Dubai is set for a thrilling showdown as India take on New Zealand in the Champions Trophy final at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium on Sunday. India enter the contest as firm favourites, having won all four of their matches in the tournament, including a 44-run victory over the Black Caps in the group stage. However, both teams had already secured semi-final spots at that point, making the final an entirely different battle.India, aiming for a record third Champions Trophy title, have relied on their world-class spin attack throughout the tournament. They fielded four spinners against New Zealand, with Varun Chakravarthy’s stunning 5-42 helping dismiss the Black Caps for 205 in a chase of 250.Former India wicketkeeper-batter Dinesh Karthik identified the key threats for India in the final, singling out Kane Williamson and Mitchell Santner as players who could pose major challenges.""I feel Kane Williamson again because he's someone who can bat through the middle nicely,"" Karthik told Cricbuzz. ""Santner is a big issue because he doesn't give away anything. A very, very wily customer, knows what to do correctly. He'll bowl one outside, one this way, one that way. Painful. And also a good leader and he's got some good people to rely on, like Kane Williamson and Tom Latham. So they're a good team. They are the team to beat. They are the best team in this tournament. It’s great to see New Zealand there. And if India need to win, they need to beat the best team. And that will be New Zealand.""While India boast a dominant squad, Virat Kohli’s ability to chase down totals remains one of their biggest weapons. Karthik elaborated on why Kohli is the greatest finisher in ODI cricket. ""Just the fact that he rotates so well, he is able to chase down totals because the pressure is so much less on him. And in between that, as we all know, he plays and hits brilliant boundaries as well. But for me the best thing about Virat Kohli is the fact that he can rotate strike well.""When asked about India’s prospects in the final, Karthik remained optimistic while avoiding overconfidence. ""They have done everything well so far. They just need to keep continuing that. But India's chances? Very high. No doubt about it. Very good chance. I don't want to jinx it enough.""Among non-Indian players, Karthik was particularly impressed by New Zealand’s Mitchell Santner. ""I really enjoyed watching Mitchell Santner bowl and the way he captained. I think he's good.""With a chance to lift their first ICC ODI title since the 2013 Champions Trophy, India’s confidence is sky-high. However, New Zealand’s resilience and tactical discipline make them formidable opponents. If India are to reclaim the trophy, they must overcome their biggest threats – a disciplined New Zealand unit led by Williamson and Santner – in what promises to be a high-stakes final in Dubai.","India take on New Zealand in the Champions Trophy final on Sunday.

SPURS BEATEN; ROMA, LYON WIN

Real Sociedad and Manchester United played a 1-1 draw in their Europa League last-16 first leg encounter on Thursday in San Sebastian, while Tottenham Hotspur went down 1-0 to AZ Alkmaar.United took the lead when Joshua Zirkzee struck from outside the box in the 57th minute, but Mikel Oyarzabal equalised from a penalty after Bruno Fernandes was penalised for handling the ball.The match followed a difficult period for Zirkzee, who had missed the crucial penalty in the FA Cup shootout defeat to Fulham the previous week. His challenging debut season at United continues, with the club's sole remaining chance for a trophy now resting in the Europa League competition.He found the back of the net for his first European goal this season, delivering a precise low shot from 20 yards following Alejandro Garnacho's well-placed pass.However, Ruben Amorim's team lost their lead when Fernandes committed a handball during a corner, resulting in Oyarzabal successfully converting the penalty.Andre Onana maintained parity with two outstanding saves as Real Sociedad sought a winning goal, setting up an balanced contest for next week's return fixture.An unfortunate first-half own goal by Lucas Bergvall resulted in Spurs' defeat in the Netherlands. The scoreline could have been more severe for Ange Postecoglou's team if not for Guglielmo Vicario's three excellent saves.Tottenham's troubles deepened when Dominic Solanke left the pitch with an injury after 20 minutes, cutting short his comeback from a seven-week knee injury layoff.Rangers secured a notable 3-1 victory on their visit to Fenerbahce, managed by Jose Mourinho.The Scottish side took an early advantage through Cyriel Dessers in Istanbul, though Alexander Djiku equalised for the Turkish team.Rangers, led by temporary manager Barry Ferguson, strengthened their position when Vaclav Cerny scored twice, including a goal nine minutes before the final whistle.Lyon made significant progress towards reaching the quarterfinals by securing a 3-1 win against Romanian side FCSB.There was an emotional moment when Nicolas Tagliafico scored, as Paulo Fonseca, who received a dugout ban until November from French football authorities following a heated exchange with a referee, became tearful whilst celebrating with his squad.After Alexandru Baluta had drawn FCSB level, Malick Fofana secured the victory for Lyon by scoring twice in the closing stages.In Italy, Uzbek striker Eldor Shomurodov delivered a dramatic finish, scoring with the last kick to give AS Roma a 2-1 triumph over Athletic Bilbao in their opening leg encounter.Paulo Dybala struck the crossbar for Roma before Inaki Williams put Athletic ahead with a header. Angelino equalised for the home side, and Shomurodov secured the victory after Athletic had a player dismissed.Lazio secured a dramatic victory at Viktoria Plzen, winning 2-1 despite being reduced to nine players, with Gustav Isaksen scoring in the 98th minute.The Italian side took the lead through Alessio Romagnoli, but Plzen equalised after half-time. Lazio subsequently lost Nicolo Rovella and Samuel Gigot to red cards before Isaksen's decisive goal.At Ajax, Eintracht Frankfurt recovered from a deficit to win 2-1, with Hugo Larsson and Ellyes Skhiri scoring after Brian Brobbey's 10th-minute opener.In another match, Bodo/Glimt defeated Olympiakos 3-0 at home, with Kasper Hogh scoring twice.","Manchester United and Real Sociedad play out 1-1 draw in Europa League last-16 first leg.

King Kohli's masterclass puts India in final | IND vs AUS | ICC Champions Trophy 2025

Gautam Gambhir hits out at critics after India beat Australia to reach Champions Trophy final

: Karachi to Rawalpindi to Dubai to Lahore to back in Dubai. Last few weeks have seen New Zealand play their four Champions Trophy fixtures at four different venues and they have only lost one game - to India in Dubai. Three days after losing the game, the Black Caps have landed in Dubai again to prepare for the title clash of the multi-nation tournament on March 9 The two top sides in the tournament have had a contrasting journey to the final as New Zealand acclimitised to different conditions for all their games and India were parked in Dubai since February 15, and played all their fixtures at the Dubai International Stadium.Even in their only defeat, the Mitchell Santner-led unit posed a stiff challenge for India but fell short of the target by 44 runs. Unbeaten India have managed to tick most of the boxes in their outings but they will have to be wary of the Kiwis who are the most prepared team in the competition , and will definitely have a score to settle on Sunday. They have encountered different challenges at different venues and have come out on top in spite of the non-stop travel, and have excelled in the art of adapting to different conditions.They did put India under the pump early in the group stage contest but a solid repair job and late flourish meant there were just enough runs for the spin quartet of Ravindra Jadeja, Kuldeep Yadav, Axar Patel and Varun Chakravarthy to defend. Varun, who picked a fifer on his maiden outing in the tournament, tormented the opposition batters but they did put up a fight and had Kane Williamson, 81, got some support from the other end, it could have been a much closer contest.On paper, very little separates the two teams as they have a very similar make-up of the Playing XI and there is no dearth of experience in both camps. If India have the potent spin quartet, Santner has Rachin Ravindra, Michael Bracewell and even Glenn Phillips to play the support cast. And as far as quicks are concerned, New Zealand definitely hold the edge as spin-heavy approach means India are reliant on Mohammed Shami to do the heavy lifting and only has Hardik Pandya to do the support job.More than the similar makeup and ability to seamlessly adapt, what would make India wary of New Zealand is the fact that they will for the first time play an opposition which has had a recent taste of Dubai conditions. The conditions which have been on the sluggish side and favoured spin. Yes, the seamers - Shami and Matt Henry - have enjoyed success but the slower bowlers have had a bigger impact on the match.New Zealand have embraced the challenges without any complaints and have set-up a mouth-watering repeat of the 2000 edition of the Champions Trophy. Senior batter Kane Williamson said the team will take learnings from their last meeting into the final, and reiterated that anything can happen in the final.""India are an outstanding team and is playing really well. So, look, it's important we try and take away some learnings from that last game. Park this match, and in a final, anything can happen. And it was a great atmosphere last game and I'm sure it'll be a good one again,"" said Williamson after the win over South Africa in the semis.On the expected lines, Williamson was asked a familiar question on the advantage India have of playing at the same venue. The experienced campaigner responded with the straight bat and chose to focus on the cricket they wish to play in the title clash.""I suppose having played there on a number of occasions; there's real clarity in how they want to operate. A little bit like our opportunity here, having played a number of times at this venue as well and I think that's part and parcel in cricket. So, it's just not something we're really looking too closely at. It's about the cricket that we want to play and take into account, obviously, the opposition, but be nice and smart come that final,"" added Williamson.New Zealand have few more days to do what they have seamlessly managed in the tournament so far - acclimitise and take the challenge head on.","New Zealand face India in the Champions Trophy final on March 9.

Chelsea advanced towards the UEFA Conference League quarter-finals with a 2-1 victory at Copenhagen on Thursday in their last 16 tie's first leg, whilst Panathinaikos and Fiorentina engaged in an intense five-goal contest.The visitors secured their advantage through second-half goals from Reece James and Enzo Fernandez, before Gabriel Pereira reduced the margin for the home side, as Enzo Maresca's team secured a narrow advantage in Denmark's capital.After a lacklustre first half, Chelsea captain James opened the scoring moments after the interval, receiving Marc Cucurella's deep pass before placing a long-range shot inside the near post.The match intensified following the goal, with Copenhagen nearly equalising immediately when Viktor Claesson's one-on-one attempt struck the inside of Robert Sanchez's post before rebounding into the keeper's hands.Substitute Fernandez secured a second goal for the visitors in the 65th minute, finishing decisively after impressive build-up play from young Tyrique George.The Premier League club appeared in control until Pereira found space in the penalty area to head in from a set-piece with 11 minutes remaining.Also, Panathinaikos secured a 3-2 victory against previous season's runners-up Fiorentina.Panathinaikos established an early dominance with Karol Swiderski and Nemanja Maksimovic scoring within the first 19 minutes, creating a 2-0 advantage. Fiorentina responded swiftly, with Lucas Beltran and Nicolo Fagioli scoring in quick succession to equalise the score.Tete secured the winning goal for the home side with a precise left-footed shot in the 55th minute, giving them an advantage before the return fixture.In Norway, Molde secured a 3-2 victory against Legia Warsaw. Eirik Hestad opened the scoring at 11 minutes, followed by Kristian Eriksen's goal six minutes afterwards.Fredrik Gulbrandsen extended the lead before half-time, capitalising on Emil Breivik's precise pass. Legia Warsaw reduced the deficit through Kacper Chodyna and Luquinhas, who scored within three minutes of each other in the second half.Real Betis shared points in a 2-2 draw with Portuguese side Vitoria Guimaraes at their home ground.Borac Banja Luka equalised against Rapid Vienna with David Vukovic's penalty in the 92nd minute, ending the match 1-1.Jagiellonia Bialystok dominated their match against ten-player Cercle Brugge, scoring three times after half-time for a 3-0 victory, whileCelje achieved a 1-0 home victory against Swiss team Lugano.Cyprus's Pafos secured a 1-0 result against Swedish side Djurgarden.",Chelsea advance to UEFA Conference League quarter-finals with a 2-1 victory at Copenhagen.

Devon Conway - the dark horse

New Zealand will look to play their cards more smartly in the match that matters, the Champions trophy final against India on Sunday, having experienced the spin-heavy strategy employed by Rohit Sharma & Co during their group-stage encounter. However, there's more than one thing about the Kiwis that India too must be wary of.Former India batter Ambati Rayudu gave a lowdown on the players that may trouble India in the title clash.Speaking about the big game in a Star Sports video, Rayudu said: ""We have to be very, very wary of three players.""New Zealand's bowling attack has revolved around the left-arm spin of captain Mitchell Santner, more so in Dubai than at the three batting-friendly venues in Pakistan. He showed that during his crafty spell in the semi-final against South Africa in Lahore, where he choked the Proteas with his 3 for 43 in the middle overs of their chase.While Santner's seven wickets in four matches may not appear a menacing stat, it's his economy rate of 4.85 runs that resembles the kind of web Indian spinners have tangled the opposition batters into. He will be even more important if tournament's top wicket-taker, fast bowler Matt Henry, doesn't recover from his shoulder injury to play the final.With two centuries in three matches, top-order batter Rachin Ravindra remains the biggest threat for the Indian bowlers. His 226 runs in three matches at an average of 75.33 has propped up the Kiwi batting line-up.The challenge for him will be to navigate through the quartet of Indian spinners in Dubai, especially considering his failure in the group-stage match against the Indian team, scoring just six runs before being dismissed by Hardik Pandya.Interestingly, Rayudu predicted Conway's return to the playing eleven in the final and warned India to not overlook the left-handed batter's attacking skills.He played New Zealand's first two matches of this Champions Trophy against Pakistan and Bangladesh, scoring 10 and 30 respectively. The opener has remained out of the playing eleven since then, with the Kiwis opting to open with Will Young and Ravindra in the subsequent group match against India and the semifinal against South Africa.",New Zealand take on India in the Champions Trophy final on Sunday. Ambati Rayudu says the Kiwis must be wary of three players.

FIFA, the governing body for global football , is considering a plan that would increase the number of teams in the 2030 World Cup to 64 for a one-off expansion to mark the centenary of the event, the organization said on Thursday.The proposal, which was made toward the end of a FIFA board meeting on Wednesday, would upend a tournament that already figures to be unwieldy and complicated because it will be played across three continents for the first time.The World Cup is the most lucrative and most watched event in sports, bringing in billions for FIFA, but the coveted nature of the competition has led to battles among nations to host it, as well as widespread allegations in the past of corruption.The decision to award the 2034 World Cup to Saudi Arabia was criticized by good governance organizations, after FIFA changed its own rules to allow the country to effectively secure rights without facing any competition.The FIFA president, Gianni Infantino , has already overseen the expansion of the World Cup once during his nine-year tenure, bringing the number of teams up to 48 from 32 at the next edition in 2026, which will be mostly played in the United States but also include matches in Mexico and Canada.According to four people with direct knowledge of the discussions, the proposal for a 64-team tournament came as the meeting was drawing to a close and had reached the section of the agenda earmarked for ""miscellaneous"" issues.At that point, a delegate from Uruguay, Ignacio Alonso, made the proposal, reading a prepared speech in English.Three of the people with knowledge of the meeting, which was held via video, described the reaction from others present as stunned silence, and the proposals will almost certainly be met with a huge outcry.But they cautioned that FIFA was likely to be guided by financial and political benefits as much as sporting ones when it came to making a decision.Infantino, who has expanded his influence over the organization and the sport since he become the head of FIFA, acknowledged the proposal and said it should be analyzed more closely, according to the four people.Since assuming the highest office in global football, Infantino has made several attempts to reshape the sport, efforts that have often led to public disputes with many other prominent figures in the football world.A proposal to analyze a 64-team World Cup to celebrate the centenary of the event ""was spontaneously raised by a FIFA Council member in the 'miscellaneous' agenda item near the end"" of a board meeting, FIFA said in a statement after The New York Times first published details of the discussions.""The idea was acknowledged as FIFA has a duty to analyze any proposal from one of its council members,"" the statement added.The last time FIFA considered a major change to the World Cup, staging the event every two years instead of four, it formed a committee that worked on the project for a year before quietly mothballing the idea.Expanding the World Cup to 64 teams -- more than a quarter of FIFA's overall membership -- could render many of the regional qualification competitions for the event meaningless.Already, as many as seven teams out of 10 from South America can qualify for the 2026 World Cup, and further expanding the World Cup could reduce its appeal for broadcasters.There are also significant logistical issues. The tournament, with 32 teams, already takes about a month and would almost certainly run longer in an expanded format. The 48-team tournament in 2026 will feature a record 104 games.Under Infantino, FIFA has been constantly exploring ways to alter its marquee event, efforts that have usually been met with blowback from other parts of the football industry.On Wednesday, FIFA announced a collaboration with the British rock band Coldplay to put together a halftime show for the first time at a World Cup final when it is played in New Jersey next summer.The move is similar to what the NFL does with the Super Bowl, its showpiece event, but the announcement was greeted with yet more criticism.At one point, Infantino supported the effort to play the World Cup every two years rather than four, and a furious reaction -- largely from European football's governing body -- forced backers of the idea to shelve it.Saudi Arabia secured its event after FIFA announced that Uruguay, Paraguay and Argentina would join Morocco, Spain and Portugal in hosting matches for the 2030 tournament, narrowing the field for potential future hosts in 2034.The three South American nations were awarded one game each to commemorate the centenary of the tournament, which was first played in Uruguay in 1930.The expansion proposal comes amid regional frustration at automatic places for the three South American hosts for the 2030 World Cup -- particularly Paraguay, home of the regional confederation president, which has failed in recent attempts to qualify for the World Cup.Infantino secured the FIFA presidency in 2016 after a corruption scandal that led to the ouster of most of its previous leadership.He ran on a campaign of promising more funds to FIFA's 211 members and a promise to increase the size of the World Cup. Infantino now spends most of his time in Miami and has grown close to President Donald Trump, who recently described the FIFA president, whom he invited to his inauguration, as the ""king of soccer.""Infantino has spent most of his time in his office devising ways to leave a lasting legacy. As well as expanding the World Cup for both men and women, he has created a new World Cup for club teams that will be staged for the first time this summer in the United States.Trump's daughter Ivanka Trump took part in the draw that set up the competitions matchups at an event in Miami late last year.The new club competition is facing several headwinds, including sluggish ticket sales in the United States and a dispute with leagues and player unions, which have filed legal complaints in Europe.","FIFA considering a plan to increase the number of teams in the 2030 World Cup to 64.

Virat Kohli steers India to third consecutive Champions Trophy final

Gautam Gambhir hits out at critics after India beat Australia to reach Champions Trophy final

In a team where most of India’s top guns are firing away, he has quietly delivered the goods. In a campaign where all talk has revolved around India’s spinners, the superlative comebacks of Mohammed Shami from injury and Virat Kohli from poor form, the sizzling batting of Shubman Gill, skipper Rohit Sharma, Shreyas Iyer and KL Rahul, what a consistent Hardik Pandya has brought to the team has found little or no word in edgewise.Hardly surprising, but not anymore. In Tuesday’s semifinal against Australia, walking in with India delicately placed at 225/5, having just lost the Virat Kohli for 84, Pandya turned the 265-run chase into a walk in the park.He unleashed three big sixes, beginning with a 106-m monster hit off Tanveer Sangha followed by back-to-back sixes off Adam Zampa. He eventually holed out to pacer Nathan Ellis, but the 31-year-old’s entertaining 24-ball 28 had done the job – swinging it decisively India’s way. Earlier, opening the bowling with Shami, Pandya ran into a belligerent Travis Head, but did well to hold his own. All he allowed Head was one run in his first over, before the attacking left-hander took his chances.“I thought his contributions against Pakistan and New Zealand were crucial too. He struck some lusty blows and made a few important breakthroughs,” ex-chairman of selector Kiran More told TOI from Baroda — the cricketing centre where the former India wicketkeeper trained the Pandya brothers, Hardik and Krunal at his academy.Against Pakistan, Pandya accounted for Babar Azam and a well-set Saud Shakeel while conceding just 31 off eight, and New Zealand saw him score a quickfire 45 off 45 balls, and then watched as he claimed the dangerous Rachin Ravindra while giving away 22 in four overs. Indeed, it is the sight of Pandya walking in at No. 7 that makes India such a formidable force here.For those from a generation back, it’s just the kind of strength that Australia would boast of in Tests in the early 2000s, when the legendary ’keeper-bat Adam Gilchrist would come in at that slot and destroy tiring bowling attacks.Against New Zealand in the final on Sunday night in Dubai, expect Pandya to again hold the key, both with ball and bat. It forces the mind back to the 2023 ODI World Cup, when he was ruled out after an ankle injury midway through the tournament. Would Pandya’s presence then have helped India get past eventual champions Australia in that final at Ahmedabad? Of course, the answer remains in the realm of imagination — that eternal ‘what if’ — but he certainly would have made a big difference.It is the presence of a player of his versatility, someone who can open the bowling as a reliable seamer and bat effectively at No. 7, that is allowing India the luxury of playing four spinners in Dubai.Bouncing back after a poor IPL last season, where he was skipper in Mumbai Indians’ poorest outing – finishing last after losing 10 matches and winning a mere four – and living through the ignominy of being booed by the Wankhede Stadium crowd, he played a stellar role in India’s T20 World Cup triumph in the West Indies and the US in June 2024. He took 11 wickets at 17.36, and chipping in with 144 runs with a strike rate of 151.57.Apparently being formed for white-ball captaincy, having led India’s T20 team since Jan 2023, Pandya was suddenly replaced by Suryakumar Yadav as T20 captain, and Shubman Gill overtook him as the ODI vice-captain. A demotion of this nature could have shaken up anyone, but Pandya simply sported his trademark shrug and shook off the setback. Today, he looks as happy as ever in the India dugout, amply evident with the way he hugged Virat Kohli and his other India teammates after India made the final.“He’s a lion-hearted cricketer. For the last six-seven months, it’s evident that he’s just enjoying his cricket. He is not someone who will hold grudges against anyone. Maaf karta hai aur chal deta hai (he forgives, forgets and moves on),” More said.","Hardik Pandya has quietly delivered the goods for India.

Big injury scare for New Zealand as Matt Henry doubtful for Champions Trophy final

DUBAI: In the centre of a major controversy around having a perceived advantage of playing at the same venue in the 2025 ICC Champions Trophy , the Indian team is not yielding to any suggestions in this regard.After skipper Rohit Sharma and head coach Gautam Gambhir , the team's batting coach Sitanshu Kotak is the latest to deny that Team India had an ""undeniable advantage"" of playing all their matches in the tournament at the Dubai International Stadium here, while all the other teams shuttled between Pakistan and UAE.Kotak, in fact, pointed out that the issue of India having an edge over other teams as a result of playing all their matches at one venue has been raked up more only because Rohit Sharma & Co had won four matches in a row and reached the final of the Champions Trophy.""I don't understand what advantage has been gained in that. There's no question of any advantage. We have played to the draw. If people feel it's an advantage after India has won four matches in a row, then I don't know what to say about it. At the end of the day, in a game, you have to play good cricket every day when you turn up. If you don't play well, you can't complain,"" Kotak said during Team India's practice session on Friday, just two days ahead of the final against New Zealand at Dubai International Cricket Stadium here.""And if you play well, there is no point saying whether you got an advantage or not. I don't really think so. Because we are practicing here (at the ICC Academy), and playing matches there (at DICS). We are practicing obviously (on a) different wicket. We all know that. So, the only thing is that we played here (In Dubai). But that is how the draw is. So, nothing else can be done in that. It is not that after coming here, they (the ICC) changed something and (we) got an advantage,"" Kotak said.Kotak didn’t agree to the idea that India held a psychological advantage over New Zealand in the final after defeating them in a group match at the same venue last Sunday. “I think we should not think like that. We should just try and turn up and play a good game of cricket. There is no point in thinking about the last match. We have to think on what to do on the 9th,” the former Saurashtra stalwart said.","Team India's batting coach Sitanshu Kotak is the latest to deny that Team India had an ""undeniable advantage"" of playing all their matches in the tournament at the Dubai International Stadium here.

"ODI is worst format, it has died due to terrible rules, says Moeen Ali",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/odi-is-worst-format-it-has-died-due-to-terrible-rules-says-moeen-ali/articleshow/118790186.cms,"Moeen Ali (Getty Images)

Former England all-rounder Moeen Ali has criticized the current ODI cricket rules that favor batsmen and expressed concerns about players choosing T20 leagues over the 50-over format.Moeen's international cricket career includes 138 ODIs where he scored 2,355 runs and took 111 wickets.He also played 68 Tests, scoring over 3000 runs and claiming more than 200 wickets before retiring from international cricket in September last year.Moeen is set to play for Kolkata Knight Riders in the upcoming IPL.""The format has almost completely died out, apart from World Cups and Champions Trophy . It is the worst format to play and I think there are many reasons for that,"" Moeen told Talksport Cricket.The cricket rules have evolved over time. Previously, five fielders were allowed outside the circle after the first powerplay, but now only four are permitted.Additionally, two new balls are used during matches, making it easier for batsmen to score.""I think the rules are terrible. To have that extra fielder after (the first powerplay), I think it's a horrendous rule for taking wickets, building any sort of pressure. Guys are averaging 60, 70 in ODI cricket now because of that.""When you're bowling at somebody and you put a little bit of pressure, he just reverse-sweeps and it's not even a single, it's a four. It's just there's always that option available for the batters (to score).""The use of two new balls has affected the game's dynamics. This change has eliminated reverse swing and altered batting conditions.""On top of all this, you have two new balls, you lose the reverse swing, you lose the art of trying to hit a softer ball.""Everything's always in the middle and crisp and it's flying off your bat and stuff. I think for those reasons, the cricket's just died. 50-over cricket has died,"" Moeen continued.Moeen warned that there are cricketers who would retire prematurely due to the money offered in T20 leagues.""I think franchise cricket is sadly eating it all up and the problem is the money that's out there and the money that's being thrown out there. It's so much that people just can't turn it down. It's very difficult.""There are probably guys who are probably going to retire in the next couple of years from international cricket to play franchise cricket,"" Moeen added.",Former England all-rounder Moeen Ali has criticized the current ODI cricket rules. He expressed concerns about players choosing T20 leagues over the 50-over format.

Gautam Gambhir chases history! India coach targets maiden ICC trophy in first final

Big injury scare for New Zealand as Matt Henry doubtful for Champions Trophy final

NEW DELHI: Former Australia pacer and ex-Pakistan Test coach Jason Gillespie has dismissed Sunil Gavaskar 's claim that an Indian B team could challenge and potentially defeat the current Pakistan side. Gavaskar made the remark after India's dominant win over Pakistan in their ICC Champions Trophy 2025 Group A clash in Dubai, further fueling concerns about the rivalry becoming one-sided.Speaking to Sports Today, Gavaskar had said, ""I think a B team (from India) certainly (can give Pakistan a run for their money). C team, I am not too sure. But a B team will be very, very hard to beat for Pakistan in their current form.""Gillespie, however, strongly rejected this notion, calling it ""absolute nonsense."" He insisted that Pakistan has the talent to compete with any side if given proper backing. ""I don't buy this rhetoric. I saw some comments from Sunil Gavaskar about the Indian B team or Indian C team beating the Pakistan top team. That's nonsense. Absolute nonsense,"" Gillespie said.He emphasised that Pakistan's main issue isn't a lack of talent but inconsistency in selection and lack of patience from the management. ""Pakistan need to pick and stick with the right players and give them time to shine, to learn, and develop their games. They can beat anyone, I've got no doubt about that. They've got the high-end talent, but they just need to pick the right ones, support them, and be patient,"" he added.Pakistan's campaign ended in disappointment as they finished last in Group A after defeats to India and New Zealand. Their squad selection has come under scrutiny, with many questioning the decision to pick just one frontline spinner and the absence of solid openers.Gillespie, who resigned as Pakistan's red-ball coach before the team's Test series against South Africa, blamed the management, particularly interim head coach Aaqib Javed and the selection committee, for the team's struggles.""If the PCB wants change and wants results to improve, they need to get the right people in place, get the right players on the bus, get the right selection panel in place, and back them. Be patient with them and let them do their jobs,"" he said.He further criticised the short-term approach towards coaching appointments, suggesting that instability is hindering the team's progress. ""Same goes with the coaches. If you're going to give a coach an opportunity, give them an opportunity to really build something meaningful. Otherwise, the results are going to stay the same,"" Gillespie remarked.","Jason Gillespie dismisses Sunil Gavaskar's claim that an Indian B team could challenge and potentially defeat the current Pakistan side.

NEW DELHI: India's young batting sensation Shubman Gill has been nominated for the ICC Men's Player of the Month award for February 2025 after a stellar run with the bat. Gill, who played a crucial role in India's recent dominance, stands out among the three nominees, which also include Australia's Steve Smith and New Zealand's Glenn Phillips Carrying his brilliant form into the ICC Men's Champions Trophy 2025 , Gill has been India's batting mainstay.

NZ hopeful bowler Henry will be fit for India final

DUBAI: When was the last time a cricketer playing just his third ODI emerged as such a threat to a team in an ICC final? Going into the Champions Trophy final against India at the Dubai International Stadium on Sunday, New Zealand aren't too daunted by the reputation of their opponents.Nor have they been left flustered by the constant travel between Pakistan and Dubai during the tournament-sore point with many current and former players. At the moment, as they eye their first ICC ODI title in almost 25 years, they seem most worried about how they would overcome the danger posed by 'mystery spinner' Varun Chakravarthy, who, featuring in just his second ODI, took five for 42 to bowl the Black Caps out for just 205 in 45.3 overs and script a 44-run win for India at this very venue last Sunday.Talking to reporters at the team hotel on Friday morning, Kiwis coach Gary Stead made no bones about the fact that Vaun could spoil his team's plans in the final. ""He's obviously a very good bowler. He bowled very well. We'll have a look at the pitch conditions down there as well and see what the effect is that he may have on the game. So, look, we certainly expect him to play after getting five for 42 against us in the last game. And yeah, we'll be planning our intentions around that as well,"" Stead said.Post his heroics against the Kiwis, Varun went on to take two for 49 against Australia, including taking the big wicket of dangerman Travis Head with just his first ball of the match. However, he has appeared to be a far more dangerous bowler under the lights, as has been evident by his superb record in T20s, where he has taken 138 wickets in 106 matches – a majority of them for the Kolkata Knight Riders, India and for various teams in the TNPL. Stead seemed to agree with the theory, while still terming the 34-year-old tweaker as a ""big, big threat"" for his side in the big game.""When you have a wrist spinner like that that's bowling, then you're looking for cues as a batsman. And I think it's always a little bit easier when you're in the daylight to see those things. So, look, there's no doubt he's a class bowler. He obviously showed his skills against us last time and he's a big, big threat in the game. So, we'll be putting our thinking caps on around how we nullify that and how we can still score runs against him,"" the 55-year-old said.The Black Caps are hopeful that their in-form pace bowler Matt Henry will be fit to face India in the Champions Trophy final in Dubai on Sunday. Henry, 33, the tournament's leading wicket-taker, jarred his right shoulder while taking a catch to dismiss Heinrich Klaasen in the 29th over, but after going back to the dressing room, the quick returned to bowl two more overs in the Kiwis' semifinal win against South Africa at Lahore on Wednesday.New Zealand are awaiting results of his scans and New Zealand's head coach said they will give Henry ""every chance"". ""It is still a little bit of an unknown. He is obviously pretty sore. [We are] hopeful he will be OK,"" Stead said. If Henry is not passed fit, pace bowler Jacob Duffy or fast-bowling all-rounder Nathan Smith may replace him. ""It was pretty uncomfortable. The positive thing for us is he got back out there to bowl. We are going to give him every chance to be playing in this match,"" Stead said.Henry has taken 10 wickets in New Zealand's four matches @16.70 at the Champions Trophy, with his best being five for 42 against India at the DICS- his absence would certainly be a big blow for the Kiwis and a boost for India in the summit clash.","New Zealand face India in the ICC Champions Trophy final in Dubai on Sunday.

It's always exciting to be in this situation and from our perspective, it just comes to a one-off game now and if we're good enough to beat India on Sunday, then I will be happy.""The New Zealand team's schedule involved travelling between Pakistan and Dubai for their matches, including the semifinal against South Africa.Stead acknowledged the demanding schedule but expressed confidence in the team's adaptability. ""There's no doubt that coming here off playing Lahore and we had a full day of travel yesterday, then it just takes it out of you a little bit, but we've got a couple of days now of a little bit of recovery and planning and training towards the game.""",New Zealand coach Gary Stead says India's'mystery' spinner Varun Chakravarthy poses a big challenge in the ICC Champions Trophy final.

PANAJI: India’s India’s record goal scorer Sunil Chhetri has been coaxed to come out of retirement and join the national team for the crucial final round of the AFC Asian Cup 2027 qualifiers.The 40-year-old Chhetri was included among the 26 probables for the international friendly against Maldives on March 19 and the Group C opener of the Asian Cup qualifiers against Bangladesh on March 25 in Shillong. India, without a win in the whole of 2024, have been clubbed with Bangladesh, Hong Kong and Singapore with only the top team making it to the continental showpiece in Saudi Arabia.“The qualification for the Asian Cup is very crucial for us. Given the importance of the tournament and the matches ahead, I discussed with Sunil Chhetri about making a comeback to strengthen the national team. He agreed, and so we have included him in the squad,” India coach Manolo Marquez said on Thursday.The striker had not made any official statement on this development till late Thursday.BFC however put out a cryptic “Maybe all goodbyes are just an ‘I’ll see you soon’ in disguise,” on their official X handle.“Sunil’s leadership qualities are unmatched. He has played international football for close to two decades and a player of his stature can motivate the entire team. His form too has been impeccable in the ISL, scoring 12 goals. India can greatly benefit with a striker like him in the team,” said All India Football Federation (AIFF) president Kalyan Chaubey.Chhetri is India’s highest-ever goalscorer and was third among the world’s active players, behind Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi, when he called time on his international career in May last year.Since then, he has continued to star for Bengaluru FC and has scored goals in the Indian Super League (ISL). This season he has scored 12 goals in the ISL, second only to the Moroccan Alaaeddine Ajaraie who tops the list with a record 21 for NorthEast United.Other Indian strikers have not really delivered, prompting Marquez to fall back on the services of the veteran striker. Marquez, who also coaches FC Goa, took over the national team after Chhetri’s international retirement and will have him in the dressing room for the first time. In his first assignment — the Inter -Continental Cup — Marquez tried young Kiyan Nassiri, Edmund Lalrindika, Manvir Singh and Liston Colaco upfront without much success.India drew goalless against Mauritius and lost 0-3 to Syria. India did score in the next two friendlies against Vietnam and Malaysia, both ending 1-1, through Farukh Chaudhary and Rahul Bheke. The only bright spark for Marquez and Indian football this season has been the rise of Brison Fernandes, with the Goa winger’s seven goals bracketing him among the top-10 strikers in the ISL.He could provide the surprise element on the wings for the national team, if declared fit. The other big call in the national team probable list is the exclusion of goalkeeper Gurpreet Singh Sandhu. The first name on the starting list for several years, Gurpreet’s form for BFC this season has been inconsistent and marked by errors.He lost his place in the team for two games to Lalthuammawia Ralte but has since made a comeback. ISL Golden Glove contender Vishal Kaith (Mohun Bagan), Amrinder Singh (Odisha) and Gurmeet Singh (NorthEast) are the three goalkeepers in Marquez’s list.","India's record goal scorer Sunil Chhetri has been coaxed to come out of retirement and join the national team.

However, the French side couldn't demonstrate the clinical finishing that had previously yielded 21 goals in their past five Champions League matches.Luis Enrique, the PSG manager, expressed that his team has ""nothing to lose"" in the upcoming match at Anfield next Tuesday.

However, Barcelona maintained their resilience, and Raphinha found the net with a powerful shot after 61 minutes, giving the five-time European champions a crucial lead to take forward.Inter Milan took command of their match against Feyenoord with a 2-0 victory in Rotterdam, courtesy of goals from Marcus Thuram and Lautaro Martinez.French forward Thuram converted Nicolo Barella's cross towards the end of the first half, somewhat contrary to the flow of play, while Martinez doubled the advantage with a powerful strike in the 50th minute.","Liverpool secured a crucial 1-0 victory against Paris Saint-Germain ( PSG ) in their Champions League last-16 first leg encounter on Wednesday.

Brazilian rising star Joao Fonseca demonstrated resilience by overcoming a third-set deficit to defeat British player Jacob Fearnley 6-2, 1-6, 6-3 on Thursday at Indian Wells .The teenager, who earned his place in history as the 10th-youngest ATP Tour winner with his victory at the Argentina Open in February, said: ""Today was petty difficult, a lot of windy, but I got through. Beginning of the match I played really well and he was making some mistakes. But the second set he played more aggressive and I was a bit more tight, maybe a bit more nervous.""Fearnley seemed to gain the upper hand after breaking Fonseca's serve in the third set's third game, and subsequently held his serve for a 3-1 lead in a lengthy game that reached deuce on five occasions.However, Fonseca responded by claiming the following five games in succession, securing two service breaks and finishing the competitive match between the world's 80th and 81st-ranked competitors with a decisive backhand volley winner.In the women's opening round, Olympic champion Belinda Bencic from Switzerland secured a straightforward victory against Germany's Tatjana Maria, winning 6-1, 6-1 in a swift 65-minute match.The Abu Dhabi champion from February 2024, Bencic, who welcomed her daughter Bella in April 2023, has made an impressive return to competitive tennis following her maternity break.The 27-year-old Swiss player, who has exceeded expectations in her return to the sport, acknowledged that managing the playing conditions was crucial to her success in the match.""Obviously today the main topic was the wind, trying to accept it and not trying to make it pretty -- just staying in the rallies, trying to be more smart rather than playing amazing shots.""Japanese tennis player and Indian Wells debutant Moyuka Uchijima delivered a commanding performance to defeat former US Open champion Emma Raducanu with a score of 6-3, 6-2.The victory earned Uchijima a second-round clash against world number three Coco Gauff.","Joao Fonseca defeats British player Jacob Fearnley 6-2, 1-6, 6-3 at Indian Wells.

The post featured an image of the tennis great at the center. To his left stood three teenage girls, and to his right, four more. On his far right, one could spot 15-year-old Maaya in her training attire, looking somewhat nervous, her right index finger tucked into her left fist.Nervousness was quite palpable - after all, the 22-time Grand Slam champion was right there in person at his Rafa Nadal Academy on the island of Mallorca, his watchful, forever-fiery eyes evaluating the teens.As for Maaya Rajeshwaran Revathi , this was her first meetup with the ""King of Clay"" after taking the tennis scene by storm with her exceptional performance at the Mumbai Open earlier this year.But here's a fun fact: Mumbai wasn't even on her calendar at the start of the year.""First of all, playing the Mumbai Open wasn't even part of the plan. My wildcard was confirmed just 2 days before the tournament,"" Maaya, born to father Rajeshwaran and mother Revathi in a Tamil family, told TimesofIndia.com in an exclusive chat. ""I was very confident that I'd compete well. Honestly, I didn't expect that I'd make it that far, but I just played match by match and gave my best.""Romping past opponents far more experienced than her, the rising star made waves across the tennis fraternity.As she reached the semi-finals at the Cricket Club of India and became the first 2009-born player to make semi-final of a WTA 125 event, some even clasped their hands in prayer, hoping for an outlandish title win. But a defeat to 27-year-old Jil Teichmann in the semis brought Maaya's dream run to an end.""After losing in the semi-finals, I was a bit upset because I didn't play as well as I hoped I would. But I had a lot of positives to take away from the Mumbai Open,"" added the rising star following the best series of results in her professional circuit so far.Even tennis was not part of Maaya's plan until she turned eight. For her, it was initially just a ""recreational sport"" after school.She decided to go pro when she was 10. At the heart of her journey are her parents, who, in Maaya's words, have been incredibly supportive.""I'm so blessed that my mom can travel with me. My home has always been my family, and also, I have a very good support system back home. Sometimes, I do miss them a lot,"" she told TimesofIndia.com. ""But specifically, I miss my dad so much. I'm very close to both my parents. I think if my dad would also be with me, I would feel very much like home.""At such a young age, staying abroad can make anyone homesick. Yet, this is exactly what Maaya had always wanted. She recalled, ""We were looking for a base in Europe last year, and the invitation from the Rafa Nadal Academy was quite surprising. But we were very happy that they took me in.""An avid reader and movie buff, Maaya also loves baking - baking, as she bakes, those chants already labelling her as the ""next big thing"" in Indian tennis. ""I'm definitely not worried about that. In fact, it's very supportive and encouraging to see people believe in me,"" she added.Currently, she is more into wading through the pages of the novel ""The Palace of Illusions"" by Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni as Maya reflected, ""If I could tell something to my younger self now, it would be to trust myself and the good people around me, no matter what happened, no matter if I didn't win, I just had to do what I love to do with all my heart.""You've probably heard these sayings: A life without a goal is like a ship without a rudder, a car without a steering wheel... or, for tennis fans, Rafael Nadal without a Grand Slam (not quite a famous one yet), but you get the idea.What is it that always drives Maaya?""The ultimate goal for me is to become the world no. 1 and win slams,"" sighed the current world no. 1 Aryna Sabalenka's aficionado.","Maaya Rajeshwaran Revathi, 15, is the first 2009-born player to make semi-final of a WTA 125 event.

Naomi Osaka was bundled out of the first round at Indian Wells on Wednesday, falling 6-4, 6-4 to Camila Osorio in the Japanese star's first tournament since injury forced her out of the Australian Open.Former world number one Osaka, now ranked 56th in the world, looked rusty against the 52nd-ranked Colombian, struggling to find the range on her powerful groundstrokes on a chilly night in the California desert.Osorio, who challenged Osaka with an array of drop shots and slices, gained the lone break of the opening set for a 5-4 lead and served it out without a hitch, then broke Osaka to open the second.The Japanese star immediately broke back, but Osorio gained the upper hand with a break in the seventh game. After Osaka fought off a match point against her own serve Osorio served it out, fighting off four break points to seal it with a stinging forehand winner.It was a winning return from injury for Osorio, who pulled out of last week's event in Merida, Mexico, with an abdominal injury.Osaka, who returned from a 15-month break last year after giving birth to daughter Shai in 2023, reached her first final since 2022 in Auckland, but retired from the title match with an abdominal injury.Back for the Australian Open, she was forced to retire from her third round match with an abdominal strain.Osorio, owner of two WTA titles, booked a second-round meeting with Denmark's Clara Tauson, the 22nd seed, who took the title in Auckland when Osaka retired.Two-time Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova, on the comeback trail seven months after giving birth to her son Petr, also fell in the first round.France's 70th-ranked Varvara Gracheva beat the Czech 4-6, 6-3, 6-4, but the 24-year-old was full of admiration for her 34-year-old opponent, who lifted the trophy at Wimbledon in 2011 and 2014.""If you let me step back a little bit, I really want to congratulate her,"" Gracheva said. ""Because she had a child quite recently, and I'm so happy that she now has the role of a mother and a tennis player, which is very demanding. It's very inspiring for sports, athletes, women -- it's just amazing.""All 32 men's and women's seeds have first round byes in this combined ATP Masters and WTA 1000 tournament.Gracheva lined up a second-round meeting with ninth-seeded Mirra Andreeva, the 17-year-old Russian who became the youngest ever WTA 1000 champion in Dubai last month.In other matches, French veteran Caroline Garcia beat US wild card Bernarda Pera 6-3, 6-4 to line up a second-round meeting with second-seeded defending champion Iga Swiatek.- Nishikori battles through -In men's action, Tallon Griekspoor of the Netherlands beat Miomir Kecmanovic of Serbia 6-7 (5/7), 6-4, 6-3 to book a second-round meeting with top-seeded German Alexander Zverev, who heads a field missing world number one Jannik Sinner as he serves a three-months drugs ban.China's Bu Yunchaokete defeated American Nishesh Basavareddy 7-5, 6-4 to book a second-round match against Russian fifth seed Daniil Medvedev, runner-up the past two years to Carlos Alcaraz -- who is seeded second as he chases a rare three-peat.Japanese veteran Kei Nishikori, who revealed during the Australian Open that he almost quit tennis last year after lengthy battles with injury, defeated Spain's Jaume Munar 6-2, 5-7, 7-6 (7/3) to line up a second-round match against 18th-seeded Ugo Humbert of France.Nishikori was treated for a leg injury in the third set and then soldiered through cramp to close out the victory.""It was not easy,"" Nishikori said. ""In the third set I was cramping pretty badly, but somehow I came back and won, so a very good match.""bb/rcw",Camila Osorio beats Naomi Osaka in first round of Indian Wells.

Emma Raducanu revealed she experienced severe emotional distress, unable to see clearly or breathe properly when she noticed a man who was intensely focused on her during a match.The British tennis star, who won the 2021 US Open, became upset during her match at the Dubai Championships last month due to the presence of this individual in the stands.The spectator, who had previously approached Raducanu during the tournament, was removed from the venue after she alerted the chair umpire during her second-round match against Karolina Muchova .Dubai police subsequently detained the individual, who signed an agreement to maintain distance from Raducanu. The WTA confirmed the person displayed obsessive behaviour.Speaking to British journalists at the BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells, her first competition since the event, Raducanu described her distress.""I saw him in the first game of the match and I was like, I don't know how I'm going to finish'. I literally couldn't see the ball through tears. I could barely breathe. I was like, I need to just take a breather here'.""Despite continuing after the individual's removal, Raducanu lost 7-6 6-4.She explained that her post-match emotional response wasn't primarily due to the defeat.Speaking to the BBC, Raducanu acknowledged that while the situation could have been handled more effectively, security measures have been enhanced.""I'm always now very aware and not necessarily doing things on my own any more. I'm always with someone and always being watched,"" Raducanu told the BBC.Previously in 2022, authorities issued a restraining order against an obsessive supporter who visited her residence three times.Raducanu is scheduled to compete against Japan's Moyuka Uchijima, ranked 52nd globally, three positions above her, in Thursday's first round in California. The victor will face third-seeded Coco Gauff , as the top 32 players receive automatic advancement to round two.","Emma Raducanu reveals she experienced severe emotional distress when she noticed a man who was intensely focused on her during a match.

WTA Merida Open

Mérida:

World number four Jessica Pegula powered to her first WTA title of 2025 on Sunday, beating McCartney Kessler 7-5, 6-2 in an all-American final in Austin, Texas.Pegula, the top seed, claimed a seventh WTA title and her first since she won the 1000 event in Toronto last year.That was one of Pegula's two titles in a 2024 campaign in which she also reached the US Open final.In Kessler she stopped a fast-rising talent, whose first two WTA finals had yielded a pair of titles -- in Cleveland last August and at Hobart in January.The 25-year-old arrived in Austin riding high after claiming her first career top-10 player with an upset of Coco Gauff in the second round at Dubai.But she couldn't find a way past Pegula, who snapped a three-match losing streak in finals for a confidence-building crown heading into the prestigious hard court tournaments at Indian Wells and Miami.Pegula, the only top-10 player in the draw, dropped just one set all week.Kessler looked set to change that when she rallied from 0-2 down to take a 4-2 lead in the first set.But too many unforced errors from Kessler allowed Pegula to get back in front and after Kessler missed a chance to break in the 11th game she was broken in the next as Pegula pocketed the first set.Kessler broke Pegula to open the second, but Pegula won the next four games to seize control.Top-seeded American Emma Navarro capped a dominant week with a 6-0, 6-0 thrashing of qualifier Emiliana Arango in the final of the WTA Merida Open on Sunday.Navarro, seeded No. 1 for the first time, marched to her second WTA title without dropping a set, adding the 500-level crown to the title she won in Hobart last year.Navarro hadn't reached a final since, although she made it to the quarter-finals or better at the last three Grand Slams and came into the week ranked 10th in the world.She needed just 55 minutes to subdue Arango, becoming the first player to win a WTA final 6-0, 6-0 since Iga Swiatek blanked Karolina Pliskova in the 2021 Rome title match.Arango, a 24-year-old Colombian who made it past the quarter-finals of a WTA tournament for the first time this week, came into the tournament ranked 133rd in the world and will crack the top 100 when the new rankings are announced on Monday.","Jessica Pegula wins WTA title in Austin, Texas.

DUBAI: The US Open's decision to cut and change the draw of its mixed-doubles event has divided the locker-room on the men's and women's tours. The Open's plan is to reschedule mixed-doubles as a standalone feature during the qualifying draw, tossing out $1 million in prize-money.This year's mixed-doubles event in New York, perhaps inspired by the vibe of last year's 'Mixed Madness' mela, will feature 16 pairs as against the 32 that make up mixed-doubles draws at Grand Slams. It will be played on August 19-20, three days before the start of the main draw. The qualification process has also been changed, with eight teams earning direct entry courtesy their combined singles ranking, while the other eight teams will be wildcard entries. Rohan Bopanna , still going strong in doubles at almost 45 years, said it was a lost opportunity for doubles specialists, who look forward to playing two events in Grand Slams -- doubles and mixed doubles. ""I don't think any doubles players can really play the mixed doubles. This year's US Open will be the first Grand Slam where we are not playing two events,"" Bopanna told TOI on the sidelines of the Dubai Duty Free Tennis championships here.Bopanna believes doubles is still a popular option for singles players on the ATP Tour. ""All the guys who enjoy doubles play doubles on the circuit,"" Bopanna said. ""The system is such that you can use singles ranking to get into doubles, on the ATP Tour you see a bunch of guys playing doubles and they enjoy it.""Yuki Bhambri, the India No.2 in the individual doubles ranking, said the USTA knew exactly what they were doing when they wrung in the changes. ""Grand Slams especially have always talked about tradition, that's why they never want to shorten matches,"" he said. ""They do that when it suits them, obviously business over (other) interests. The mixed doubles for a lot of countries like Great Britain, India and Australia has been a source of Grand Slam achievement. You're never going to get an opportunity like that with what they've done.""""You're essentially having the singles guys play a practice week,"" the 32-year-old Bhambri said, adding, ""It is obviously a sad day and a loss for a lot of the doubles players. We've all spoken about that, everyone is aware of what they've done and how they've gone about it.""Last year's Mixed Madness exhibition event before the start of the main draw saw a number of high-profile singles players pairing up. American Coco Gauff said she wouldn't be playing the mixed event this time even though she enjoyed being a part of Mixed Madness last year. ""It's an interesting situation because (on one side) some (players) rely on mixed doubles and it's an event that's been there forever. On the other hand, I know they're trying to get more singles players involved, maybe grow the sport,"" Gauff said, ""I most likely won't be participating just because it's not a great time for me, it will take away from the preparation for US Open.""",The US Open has cut and changed the draw of its mixed-doubles event.

Virat Kohli's last known on-field altercation took place during the Border-Gavaskar Test series at the MCG in Australia.

The team will play two four-day matches in Lucknow and three one-day games in Kanpur.Konstas, 19, was shoulder-barged by the Indian superstar during the Boxing Day Test in Melbourne. The young sensation had a breakthrough series after being handed his Test debut, scoring a half-century with an aggressive approach that forced Team India to rethink their game plan. He was also involved in multiple altercations with Indian players, including Kohli and Jasprit Bumrah.“I had a little chat after the game telling him that I idolise him, and it’s obviously a huge honour playing against him,” Konstas told The Daily Telegraph.Australia’s Chair of Selectors, George Bailey, said: “The sub-continent provides many unique challenges and the opportunity to utilise different skills with bat and ball.We hope repeated experiences in these conditions will assist players in developing an effective method and understanding of their game for future sub-continent tours.”Xavier Bartlett, Campbell Kellaway, Sam Konstas, Nathan McSweeney, Lance Morris, Fergus O’Neill, Ollie Peake, Josh Philippe, and Corey Rocchiccioli will feature in the four-day matches in Lucknow before returning for the opening round of the Sheffield Shield.Bailey added: “For many of these players, we remain interested in the development of their short-format cricket as well, but balancing priorities meant we wanted them back and available for the start of the Sheffield Shield season.”The one-day matches in Kanpur will feature Harry Dixon, Sam Elliott, Jake Fraser-McGurk, Mackenzie Harvey, Tanveer Sangha, Lachie Shaw, Tom Straker, Will Sutherland, and Callum Vidler.Xavier Bartlett, Cooper Connolly, Jack Edwards, Aaron Hardie, Campbell Kellaway, Sam Konstas, Nathan McSweeney, Lance Morris, Todd Murphy, Fergus O’Neill, Oliver Peake, Josh Philippe, Corey Rocchiccioli, Liam ScottCooper Connolly, Harry Dixon, Jack Edwards, Sam Elliott, Jake Fraser-McGurk, Aaron Hardie, Mackenzie Harvey, Todd Murphy, Tanveer Sangha, Liam Scott, Lachie Shaw, Tom Straker, Will Sutherland, Callum VidlerSeptember 16-19: Australia A v India A | LucknowSeptember 23-26: Australia A v India A | LucknowSeptember 30: Australia A v India A | KanpurOctober 3: Australia A v India A | KanpurOctober 5: Australia A v India A | Kanpur",Australia A will play two four-day matches in Lucknow and three one-day games in Kanpur.

Ben Stokes press conference: On Mohammed Siraj, Chris Woakes batting with injury, 2-2 result

Poll What was your reaction to Chris Woakes walking out to bat injured? Inspired Concerned Impressed

NEW DELHI: In a finale befitting a blockbuster series, England all-rounder Chris Woakes delivered one of the most courageous moments of the summer — walking out to bat with a dislocated shoulder during a tense chase against India in the fifth and final Test at The Oval.With England needing 17 runs and just one wicket remaining, Woakes, officially ruled out of the match on Day 1 due to injury, strode to the crease to a standing ovation. His left arm was strapped tightly in a sling under his sweater. Despite the intense pain — and even more intense pressure — Woakes was ready to face the fury of India’s fast bowlers.“The first one was the worst,” Woakes told The Guardian. “All I had taken was codeine and it was just so sore. Instinct took over – even with my arm strapped down I tried to run as you naturally do. I genuinely worried my shoulder had popped back out again, hence you saw me throw my helmet off, rip the glove off with my teeth, and check it was OK.”He did not face a single delivery. But just being there mattered. “It was bittersweet in the end. Part of me wondered what it might be like… to see if I could have defended the ball, seen out an over maybe, squeezed a run or carved a four,” he said.“But the other side of it was: ‘Thank God I didn’t face a 90mph bouncer, one-handed, facing the wrong way around.’”Woakes added 10 valuable runs with Gus Atkinson before Mohammed Siraj ended England’s hopes with a sizzling yorker to dismiss the latter.Despite the heartbreak, Woakes never considered staying back. “I’m still gutted, devastated really, that we couldn’t get the fairytale. But I never considered not going out there, even if it had been 100 runs still to win.”India clinched the Test by six runs, squaring the Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy 2-2. Woakes didn’t face a ball — but earned the respect of fans and players on both sides.","England all-rounder Chris Woakes walked out to bat with a dislocated shoulder.

Poll How would you rate Jasprit Bumrah's performance in the recent series against England? Outstanding Good Average Below Expectations

NEW DELHI: India’s hard-fought 2-2 series draw against England in the Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy produced numerous standout performances, but not everyone lived up to the billing. Former India all-rounder Irfan Pathan expressed disappointment in Jasprit Bumrah ’s performance, despite the pacer finishing as one of the top wicket-takers in the series.Bumrah featured in only three of the five Tests due to workload management. While he returned with 14 wickets at an average of 26.00 — including two five-wicket hauls — Pathan felt Bumrah lacked the killer instinct in crucial moments.“Bumrah will get six out of ten,” Pathan said on his YouTube channel. “When you're a senior player, there is a lot of responsibility to win matches. He played three Tests, and India didn’t win any of them.”Citing specific examples, Pathan pointed to the series opener where Bumrah took five wickets in the first innings but failed to pick up a single in the second while defending a sizeable total of 370.“At that crucial time, your main match-winner has to find a way — over the wicket, around the wicket, yorkers, slower balls, bouncers — anything to create pressure.That didn't happen. In the Leeds Test, we did not see that pressure being built. England ended up scoring heavily, and Bumrah did not take a single wicket,” he added.The former pacer also noted Bumrah’s reluctance to stretch spells when India needed breakthroughs. “There were moments, like when a sixth over was needed. Joe Root had been dismissed by him 11 times, and in that Lord's Test, Bumrah bowled just five overs. That one more over could’ve pushed harder. I felt he held back.”While acknowledging Bumrah’s name going up on the Lord’s honours board, Pathan stressed that the world’s top-ranked Test bowler is held to a higher standard.“He took a five-wicket haul and got his name on the Lord's honours board. But when you are the number one bowler, there is an expectation of number one-level performance, and I felt he did not quite live up to that.”",Former India all-rounder Irfan Pathan expressed disappointment in Jasprit Bumrah ’s performance.

Poll Do you agree with Ben Stokes' stance on injury substitutions in Test cricket? Yes, I fully support it. No, I think substitutions should be allowed. Not sure, need more information.

England seamer Chris Woakes , currently nursing a shoulder injury, has backed his captain Ben Stokes ' stance in the ongoing debate over ""injury substitutions"" in Test cricket.India wicketkeeper-batter Rishabh Pant had retired hurt on the first day of the drawn fourth Test in Manchester but returned to bat the next day, despite scans confirming a fracture in his right foot.India head coach Gautam Gambhir subsequently advocated for the introduction of injury replacements in Tests—a suggestion Stokes had dismissed as “absolutely ridiculous.”Interestingly, in the fifth Test at The Oval, England found themselves in a similar situation when Woakes suffered a fractured shoulder. Despite the injury, he came out to bat on the final day with England nine wickets down and needing fewer than 20 runs to win.“I’m with Stokesy, to be honest,” Woakes told The Guardian.“Having played for 18 years, the game is what it is—you lose a player, and as a team, you have to find a way. It makes you more resilient and the team stronger.""“I understand why people might feel it’s necessary in cases of freak injuries like mine, but there would be too many grey areas and loopholes.”Woakes’ gritty decision to bat despite his injury has earned him widespread respect.“I mean, it’s not the way you want to make the front page—you’d rather it be for five wickets or a century. There have been a lot of ups and downs since, but yeah, the love from the public has helped,” he said.“It’s so strange to go from starting a Test week thinking, ‘One last push,’ to ending up on a physio’s table wondering what the future holds.”","England seamer Chris Woakes has backed his captain Ben Stokes'stance in the ongoing debate over ""injury substitutions"" in Test cricket.

Poll What was your reaction to the fox interrupting the cricket match? I found it hilarious! It was distracting. I loved it! It was unique.

WATCH the wild visitor here:

In one of the rarest interruptions seen in cricket, a fox stole the spotlight during the season opener of The Hundred 2025, halting play momentarily and delighting a packed Lord’s Cricket Ground in London.The bizarre moment occurred during the high-octane clash between London Spirit and defending champions Oval Invincibles, when the game was suddenly interrupted — not by rain or an injury — but by a small, swift fox darting across the field.The fox appeared just as London Spirit pacer Daniel Worrall was about to deliver a ball. With the Invincibles needing 72 runs more to win, the animal sprinted across the playing surface, seemingly unaware of the chaos it caused. The sight of the furry intruder triggered loud cheers and laughter from the Lord’s crowd, and even the usually composed commentators Stuart Broad and Eoin Morgan couldn’t contain their amusement as the cameras followed the fox’s every move.Sky Sports Cricket captured the moment, sharing the clip online — where it quickly went viral.The fox eventually scampered across the boundary rope, bringing an end to the surprise interlude.Play resumed minutes later, but not before the moment etched itself as one of the quirkiest starts to a cricket season.On the cricketing front, the Oval Invincibles cruised to a six-wicket win, chasing down London Spirit’s modest total of 80 in just 69 balls. Rashid Khan and Sam Curran were the standout performers with the ball, both claiming three wickets each to dismantle a Spirit lineup that featured stars like David Warner, Kane Williamson, and Ashton Turner.Rashid, who took 3 for 11 and was named Player of the Match, said after the game: “It was nice to get off to a winning start… I haven’t bowled in the last couple of months but the amount of cricket I have played in the last ten years, that really helps.”While the Invincibles made a dominant start to their title defense, it was the fox at Lord’s that truly captured hearts.","A fox interrupted a cricket match between London Spirit and the Oval Invincibles at Lord’s.

India need EIGHT wickets, England 324 runs: Who will come out on top at The Oval?

NEW DELHI: Congress MP and renowned public figure Shashi Tharoor has once again sparked debate around Virat Kohli’s retirement from Test cricket, calling it “premature” and urging the Indian stalwart to return to the longest format. Tharoor’s latest remarks came after India’s spirited 2-2 series draw in England, under new skipper Shubman Gill , who led a young side admirably in the Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy.Despite India fighting back from a 1-2 deficit with a draw in Manchester and a nail-biting win at The Oval, Tharoor couldn’t help but reflect on what might have been with Kohli in the lineup.“I was just admiring Joe @root66’s consistent excellence as England’s hardy perennial at age 35, while @imVkohli, just two years older, languishes in premature retirement,” Tharoor posted on social media, in reply to a debate on Kohli’s potential return.Earlier during the fifth Test, Tharoor had already voiced his emotions, posting: “I’ve been missing @imVkohli a few times during this series, but never as much as in this Test match. His grit and intensity, his inspirational presence in the field, not to mention his abundant batting skills, might have led to a different outcome. Is it too late to call him out of retirement? Virat, the nation needs you!”Kohli, 36, announced his Test retirement in May 2025, ending a stellar 14-year red-ball career with 123 Tests, 9,230 runs, 30 hundreds, and a top score of 254*. He remains India's most successful Test captain in England, with three wins, and was central to several near-misses — including the closely contested 2018 series and the COVID-delayed 2021-22 finale.As Team India embraces a new era, Tharoor’s impassioned appeal may reignite calls from fans and pundits alike for King Kohli’s red-ball encore.","Congress MP and renowned public figure Shashi Tharoor has once again sparked debate around Virat Kohli’s retirement from Test cricket.

Poll Who do you think had a bigger impact on India's performance in the Test series against England? Jasprit Bumrah Mohammed Siraj Both had an equal impact

Former Australia cricketer Brad Haddin has made a bold remark about India’s pace duo Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Siraj Haddin said that Bumrah didn’t win any Test matches for India during the England tour.“India can take a lot out of this — that they can still play without Bumrah,” Haddin said on the YouTube channel LiSTNR Sport.“Life goes on if the other bowlers find a way. They have so much talent over there in India. But he didn’t win a Test match.“I think Siraj likes being the leader of the attack. He’s one of those guys who wants the ball in big situations.Yes, he makes mistakes, but he doesn’t shy away from the occasion. If you have players like that — who aren’t afraid to make mistakes, who can get under the skin of the opposition because of how much they want to be involved — those are the guys you want.”Jasprit Bumrah was released from India’s squad after not being included in the playing XI for the fifth Test against England at The Oval, owing to workload management.Before the five-match series began, chief selector Ajit Agarkar and head coach Gautam Gambhir had stated that Bumrah wouldn’t feature in more than three Tests on the tour due to workload considerations. Bumrah played in the first Test at Headingley, Leeds, followed by the third and fourth games at Lord’s and Old Trafford, Manchester, respectively.In those three games, Bumrah picked up 14 wickets — including two five-wicket hauls — bowling 119.4 overs at an average of 26, making him India’s leading wicket-taker before the fifth Test.Meanwhile, Siraj featured in all five Tests, ending as the highest wicket-taker in the series with 22 scalps, helping India level the Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy 2-2.“Mohammed Siraj wanted the ball in that last hour of play. There’s no way in the world he didn’t want to bowl every over to win the game. Yes, he dropped a catch — that was a bad miss. Your details have to be better when you’re catching in those moments.“But that one moment didn’t define his performance in the Test match.

shakeup

Once all the media formalities were completed, the Indian team whizzed out of the Oval fast on Monday afternoon. They reached the team hotel and had a short customary celebration before dispersing. If one went out for a stroll in the evening on the stretch from Oxford Street to Piccadilly Circus, one could have casually bumped into a few members of the Indian team.Prasidh Krishna was there with his family. Kuldeep Yadav hopped stores with former India leg-spinner Piyush Chawla. Arshdeep Singh too had his family with him. Head coach Gautam Gambhir checked out of the team hotel by evening. Captain Shubman Gill had his friends and family over to celebrate a memorable tour that has placed him at the centre of Indian cricket ’s power centre. The coach-captain duo has come out of their first assignment with flying colours, having drawn the five-Test series, including the dramatic six-run win in the fifth Test on Monday.Bigger milestones now beckon. Before this tour, there had been discussions around the future of the coach-captain combination. Having settled all the doubts, now it’s time for the two to set concrete plans for the future.Gill landed in England with an Indian team in the first week of June with questions being raised about his inexperience.Now he deserves to go off the constant high-performance routine of an India cricketer for a few days.Meanwhile, Gambhir’s tenure as India’s head coach has revolved around his strong people-over-individuals philosophy. He is also a coach who came into the Indian dressing room to wipe out the superstar culture.Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma and Ravichandran Ashwin retired from Test cricket before the selectors could get down to planning for the English summer. Jasprit Bumrah, the biggest name after Kohli and Rohit, declared he was available for only three of the five Tests.India boarded the flight from Mumbai to London after a disastrous first six months in Test cricket under Gambhir. The ICC Champions Trophy triumph in March aside, Gambhir knew he had to deliver. Not that there was any immediate threat to his position, but a drubbing with a fresh team here would have been detrimental to his reputation. The first thing he did was to instill enough conviction in Gill and the team.“Before the start of the series, Gauti bhai (Gambhir) said that we are a young team, but we don’t want to be looked at as a young team. We want to be looked at as a gun team’. The way we played today showed why we are a gun team,” Gill said. This has also been Gambhir’s line of thinking. After India pulled off a draw in the fourth Test in Manchester, having trailed almost throughout the match, a typically combative Gambhir decided to front up to the media. “I don’t like to call this a team in transition. I will say they are inexperienced,” he had said.There is this unmistakable aversion to the word ‘transition’. “Even if there was no transition or if we had the old players, everything would have looked good if batters and bowlers performed,” Gill said. Then he went on to highlight his batting lineup’s stellar performance in the series.“Almost every batter in the series has performed. They have scored hundreds. They have scored runs in crucial and crunch situations,” he mentioned, offering enough hints that this team management had moved on long before the world could.Gill’s confidence in his batting lineup is backed up by numbers. Gill himself scored 754 runs while KL Rahul and Ravindra Jadeja finished with more than 500 runs. Rishabh Pant scored 479 runs in the seven innings he batted before suffering a broken foot. Yashasvi Jaiswal finished with 412 runs.On the topic of transition or inexperience, Gill has been bullish about the potential of his team. He believed the scoreline before the fifth Test wasn’t a true reflection of the cricket India have played. He maintained that even after the win on Monday. For him, even if India had lost the last Test, the scoreline wouldn’t have been a fair one.The plans will be taking shape soon. There is a certain assertion in Gill’s speech now which suggests he is a man who is firmly in charge. He is already looking ahead.That India managed to win two Tests on the tour without Bumrah playing must have settled a lot of nerves. TOI understands that Bumrah will either play an entire Test series or sit out of it in future. So, it could come down to picking either the two-Test series against West Indies at home in Oct before South Africa come in Dec for another two Tests. India don’t have another five-Test series in two years. With the team expected to play on spin-friendly pitches in India, there won’t be much load on the pacers. The selectors and Bumrah can comfortably plan his availability for white-ball tournaments like the T20 World Cup at home in Feb-March next year.With Gill and Gambhir striking a cord, there could be a temptation to revisit the ODI leadership group going forward. Gill is already the designated vice-captain in the ODI format. His consistency with the bat makes him indispensable.With incumbent Rohit Sharma not being a certainty for the 2027 ODI World Cup in South Africa, there are murmurs in the board that if a new captain had to take charge, he should get a fair time to shape the ODI team according to his philosophies. India don’t play much ODI cricket in the build-up to the 2027 World Cup.",India captain Shubman Gill had his friends and family over to celebrate a memorable tour that has placed him at the centre of Indian cricket ’s power centre.

India vs England Day 5: Can India do the UNTHINKABLE at The Oval? Four wickets and 2-2!

Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel.

Poll Do you agree with Dinesh Karthik's critique of the Indian cricket team's management? Yes, I fully agree. No, I disagree.

NEW DELHI: Former India cricketer Dinesh Karthik has delivered a pointed critique of the team management under head coach Gautam Gambhir and captain Shubman Gill , saying the duo took an overly defensive approach during the recently concluded Test series in England, which ended in a 2-2 draw.While India’s young side showed commendable fight to bounce back after trailing 1-2, Karthik suggested the team’s composition reflected a fear of losing rather than a hunger to win.“You could almost argue they picked a team not to lose,” Karthik said on Cricbuzz. “He [Gambhir] is now getting his way, so he will be responsible for everything that happens in the Indian team. If it does well, credit to him. If it doesn’t do well, he should put his hands up and say, ‘we made a mistake’.”Karthik stopped short of blaming captain Shubman Gill, indicating that Gambhir appears to be the primary force behind team decisions.“He [Gambhir] has taken control of the team I feel. He is the driving force of this team with Shubman,” he remarked. “The one thing that I feel he can do is almost look at being serious about picking 20 wickets as much as he feels depth in batting is important.”He added that while Gambhir has a strong track record in white-ball formats, he is still finding his feet in the red-ball arena.“He’s a terrific white-ball coach and the results have been there for us to see. But, in Test cricket, he is also learning on the job.”Under Gambhir's tenure so far, India have suffered a 0-3 whitewash at home to New Zealand — the first in their Test history — and a 1-3 loss in the 2024-25 Border-Gavaskar Trophy in Australia. They also failed to reach the World Test Championship final for the first time.Karthik also weighed in on Jasprit Bumrah ’s workload management and dismissed narratives suggesting India win more without him.“You have to look at it from Jasprit Bumrah’s point of view. I think, these kind of wins, the way the series has panned out, the way the young team has fought, it will actually help him in his career. I believe Jasprit Bumrah will be very proud of this young bowling attack,” he said.“The stat of India winning when he doesn’t play is not his mistake. He is so impactful that others pale in comparison. I hope he will have a longer career, knowing he can pick and choose matches. Two back injuries, one nasty ACL that he had — it’s not easy.”","Former India cricketer Dinesh Karthik has delivered a pointed critique of the team management under head coach Gautam Gambhir and captain Shubman Gill. The duo took an overly defensive approach during the recently concluded Test series in England, which ended in a 2-2 draw. India’s young side showed commendable fight to bounce back after trailing 1-2.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123130474,imgsize-118502,width-400,resizemode-4/123130474.jpg"

Poll What do you think about Mohammed Siraj's performance in the Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy? Outstanding Good Average

NEW DELHI: India pacer Mohammed Siraj returned to the country on Wednesday, landing in Mumbai after a heroic performance in the recently concluded Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy, where India drew 2-2 against England. The 31-year-old fast bowler was the leading wicket-taker in the five-match Test series, finishing with 23 scalps at an average of 32.43.A video of Siraj’s arrival at Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport quickly went viral on social media, showing him walking out in crisp black casuals and acknowledging a small group of fans who had gathered to welcome him. Though there were enthusiastic requests for selfies and autographs, Siraj, ever low-key off the field, made a quick exit.Siraj’s performances in England, especially in the absence of Jasprit Bumrah for two Tests due to workload management, elevated his status from support act to spearhead. He produced a six-wicket haul at Birmingham, where his 6/70 helped India gain a 180-run lead, and followed it up with a stunning five-wicket spell at The Oval, triggering England’s collapse from 301/4 to 367 all out.Dubbed ‘Miyan Magic’, Siraj silenced critics who once pointed to his erratic spells, emerging as a dependable and tireless workhorse in overseas conditions. Since his Test debut in 2020, Siraj has bowled 1069.5 overs, taking 123 wickets in 41 Tests—only behind Bumrah in terms of workload among Indian pacers.With his passion, relentless energy, and emotional intensity, Siraj has not just delivered results but has become a symbol of India's evolving pace identity.",Mohammed Siraj returned to India on Wednesday after England series.

Poll Was Harry Brook's shot a turning point in the match? Absolutely, it cost the game No, the team had other chances Maybe, but other factors played a role

R Ashwin didn’t mince his words while talking about the recently-concluded Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy and criticised England cricketers for disrespecting the ""cricketing gods. ""Ashwin slammed England captain Ben Stokes and coach Brendon McCullum for encouraging what he called reckless cricket.“As a captain, as a coach, you can proclaim to the world that this is your brand of cricket,” Ashwin said on his Hindi YouTube show Ash Ki Baat.“They can say that Brook played the way we wanted him to play, that he embraced our beliefs.“All of this is easier said than done, but Test cricket needs a certain amount of balance. Yes, I agree that this approach got you runs in the first innings, but in the fourth innings, when you're batting on 100 and the finish line is in sight, it becomes your responsibility to see your team through.”Ashwin pointed out Harry Brook’s reckless shot after scoring a fantastic century, which gave India an opening at The Oval.“When he (Brook) walked in at 100/3, England were not in the game at all. He took chances against Akash Deep when England were staring down the barrel, and a big defeat was looming.But when he got out, it was a moment he could have cherished.“He could have walked out of The Oval with his bat held high alongside Joe Root, who was breaking record after record, and could have won the series 3-1 for England. But he played a reckless shot, and that punishment is why England lost the match and ended up drawing the series.“Brook definitely missed that opportunity. Everything fell on Root’s shoulders. And, fortunately for India, the conditions changed. Such things happen when the cricketing gods are disrespected.“The way England disrespected the cricketing gods — even the clouds came together, cried on the pitch, and allowed the ball to move a lot,” Ashwin said.","R Ashwin slams England captain Ben Stokes and coach Brendon McCullum for encouraging what he called reckless cricket.

The 2025 edition of The Hundred kicked off at Lord’s on Tuesday with a wave of nostalgia, especially for fans of the Indian Premier League franchise Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH).In a moment that melted hearts, two modern-day greats and former SRH stalwarts David Warner and Kane Williamson were seen walking out to bat together for London Spirit, evoking memories of their time as batting partners in Hyderabad’s orange.The official social media handle of Lord’s Cricket Ground shared the heartwarming video, capturing the duo emerging through the iconic Lord’s long room and stepping onto the field. The caption read: “A video @SunRisers fans will enjoy!”Between them, Warner and Williamson have represented SRH for over a decade — Warner for seven seasons and Williamson for eight. Their chemistry and calm aggression were a cornerstone of SRH’s success in the IPL, including their 2016 title win.However, the fairytale reunion didn’t translate into success for London Spirit on the night. Defending champions Oval Invincibles outclassed the Spirit, bundling them out for a paltry 80 in 94 balls, with Rashid Khan (3/11) and Sam Curran (3/18) leading the charge. The Invincibles chased down the target in just 69 balls, winning by six wickets.Post-match, Rashid reflected on his performance and preparations: “It was nice to get off to a winning start... There was spin on offer. I mixed things up and it worked well.”Adding to the spectacle, play was briefly halted by an unexpected intruder — a fox that darted across the ground, drawing laughter and cheers from the Lord’s crowd.","The 2025 edition of The Hundred kicked off at Lord’s on Tuesday.

IND vs ENG: Mohammed Siraj reflects on memorable win at The Oval

Poll Should Kuldeep Yadav have been included in India’s playing XI against England? Yes, he should have played. No, team balance was more important.

NEW DELHI: Former India batter Robin Uthappa has offered a nuanced perspective on the omission of Kuldeep Yadav from India’s playing XI during the recently concluded Test series against England, which ended in a 2-2 draw.While several voices criticised the Indian team management for not picking the in-form wrist-spinner on responsive surfaces, Uthappa argued that selection is not just about bowling skill — it’s about team balance and depth.Speaking on his YouTube channel, Uthappa said, “Put Kuldeep in the 11 and make sure your batting is still in a state where none of the fans will go after the team management or the captain. With all due respect to Kuldeep's prowess with the ball, he's got limitations to his batting. That's going to take a lot of effort from his side.”Uthappa went on to compare Kuldeep’s case with that of Ravichandran Ashwin , India’s former premier off-spinner, who also offers consistent runs lower down the order. “Ashwin has got five or six Test hundreds. If Kuldeep can do that at number eight or nine, then he will certainly play more Tests,” Uthappa added.Apart from bowling combinations, Uthappa also praised young opener Yashasvi Jaiswal , who scored 411 runs in the series. “I think he’s an absolute cricket nut. He is obsessed with the game, batting, and scoring runs. That’s what makes him a unique prospect,” he said.Reflecting on Shubman Gill’s leadership, Uthappa stated, “We've seen Shubman's captaincy in this series — good at times and passive at others. Tactically, he will grow. As a leader, he is coming into his own since leading Gujarat Titans.”",Robin Uthappa has offered a nuanced perspective on the omission of Kuldeep Yadav from India’s playing XI during the recently concluded Test series against England.

Ben Stokes press conference: On Mohammed Siraj, Chris Woakes batting with injury, 2-2 result

Poll Do you think Chris Woakes showed exceptional bravery by batting with a shoulder injury? Yes, absolutely No, it was not wise Maybe, depending on the situation

NEW DELHI: England pacer Chris Woakes has opened up about the dramatic final day of the fifth Test against India at The Oval, where he walked out to bat despite a serious shoulder injury. In a candid chat with The Guardian, Woakes shared the pain and emotion behind that courageous moment, and revealed how India captain Shubman Gill praised him for his bravery.Woakes had injured his shoulder while fielding on Day 1 and did not take part in the match afterward, until England were nine wickets down, needing 17 more runs to pull off a historic chase. To the crowd's roaring applause, Woakes emerged from the pavilion with his arm strapped, determined to support Gus Atkinson.""The first one was the worst. All I had taken was codeine and it was just so sore. Instinct took over here – even with my arm strapped down I tried to run as you naturally do. I genuinely worried my shoulder had popped back out again, hence you saw me throw my helmet off, rip the glove off with my teeth, and check it was OK,"" Woakes recalled.Ultimately, Atkinson was bowled and Woakes never faced a ball. But the crowd stood up, and so did the Indian team in appreciation. After the match, Gill walked over to Woakes.“Shubman said something like: ‘That was incredibly brave.’ I told him: ‘You’ve had an unbelievable series, well played, and credit to your team.’ Both sets of players had been through the mill in the series and deserve credit for the show we put on. Both teams wanted the win, of course, but it does kind of feel fair that it was drawn,” Woakes added.Woakes said he felt devastated not to get the fairytale finish.“I’m still gutted, devastated really, that we couldn’t get the fairytale. But I never considered not going out there, even if it had been 100 runs still to win. It was nice to have the ovation and some of the Indian players came over to show their respect. But any other player would have done the same. You couldn’t just call it off at nine wickets down,” he said.","England pacer Chris Woakes has opened up about the dramatic final day of the fifth Test against India at The Oval.

NEW DELHI: West Indies have named a 15-member squad for their upcoming three-match ODI series against Pakistan, set to take place in Trinidad.

The 18-year-old continues to impress and remains a key part of the team’s plans moving forward.Left-arm pacer Jediah Blades, who debuted in the 2024 Bangladesh series, has also been recalled. Amir Jangoo, who made headlines with a century on his ODI debut versus Bangladesh, keeps his place after playing against Ireland earlier this year.West Indies enter the series on the back of a 2-1 T20I defeat at home.

NEW DELHI: Indian skipper Shubman Gill ’s batting reached a new level during India’s hard-fought 2-2 series draw in England. The elegant right-hander from Punjab not only delivered with the bat but also impressed with his tactical acumen, guiding a young team in transition—without stalwarts Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, and Ravichandran Ashwin, who retired from Tests following a disastrous Border-Gavaskar Trophy campaign in Australia.Gill entered the series under immense scrutiny, having not crossed 40 outside Asia since his iconic 91 at Brisbane in 2021. Often touted as Virat Kohli’s ‘heir apparent,’ Gill needed to prove himself. A few technical tweaks and a calmer mindset helped him find the focus and discipline required to carve his name into Test cricket’s history books.Gill's first century outside Asia was a statement of redemption. It was a reminder to his critics and perhaps a reassurance to himself that he belonged at the highest level of Test cricket. He became only the fourth Indian—after Vijay Hazare, Sunil Gavaskar, and Virat Kohli—to score a century in his debut innings as Test captain. He also crossed 2,000 Test runs, echoing Kohli’s milestone in Adelaide (2014).If Leeds was redemption, Edgbaston was domination. Gill scored a majestic 269, laced with 30 fours and 3 sixes, followed by a blistering 161 off 162 balls in the second innings. His marathon effort powered India to their first-ever Test win at Birmingham—by a record 336 runs. He became:The iconic venue saw Gill falter, but even in failure, he overtook Rahul Dravid’s 602-run tally in 2002, registering the most runs in a single England tour by an Indian.A poor first-innings start was followed by a gritty comeback. After India slumped to 0/2, Gill forged a 188-run stand with KL Rahul and scored a patient 103 off 238 balls. His fourth century of the series tied him with Sunil Gavaskar and Don Bradman for the most centuries by a captain in a single Test series. He also became:A promising start was cut short by a run-out, but even then, Gill etched another record—surpassing Gavaskar’s 732 to record the most runs by an Indian captain in a Test series.Gill finished the series with 774 runs at an average of 75.40, including four centuries—the second-highest for India in a single series after Gavaskar’s 774 vs West Indies in 1971.

Poll Will Son Heung-min's presence boost LAFC's chances for the MLS Cup? Definitely Possibly Not likely

Son Heung-min has completed a sensational move to Los Angeles FC, signing a contract with the Major League Soccer (MLS) club on Tuesday. The 33-year-old South Korean forward ended his 10-year stint at Tottenham Hotspur, marking the end of an era in North London and the beginning of a new chapter in Southern California.Son was spotted in a luxury suite at BMO Stadium during LAFC’s Leagues Cup match against Tigres on Tuesday night. The club is expected to unveil him formally at a press conference on Wednesday. LAFC reportedly paid over $20 million for the transfer — potentially a record-breaking fee in MLS history.During his time at Spurs, Son became a fan favourite and one of the Premier League’s brightest stars, scoring 173 goals in 454 appearances. His departure was marked by an emotional farewell in Seoul last week, where he received a guard of honor and a standing ovation from nearly 65,000 fans during Tottenham’s exhibition against Newcastle.Los Angeles is a symbolic and strategic destination for Son. Home to the largest Korean population outside of Korea, the city offers the perfect platform for Son to extend his influence off the pitch, much like Shohei Ohtani has done with the LA Dodgers in Major League Baseball.Son’s move also reunites him with former Spurs captain Hugo Lloris, now LAFC’s goalkeeper.

What’s common between the three Formula E world champions

How the three World Champions fared in Formula E Season 11

Days after Oliver Rowland lifted his Formula E World Championship trophy in London this season, an interesting trend has come to the attention of Formula E and its fans. As a coincidence, all Formula E drivers who won the Mexico City E-Prix went on to win the Formula E World Championship that season, and this has been proved right for three consecutive years.Highlighting the same since 2023, a poster of three World Champions was shared on X by Formula E with the caption, “The trend continues. Each winner of the #MexicoCityEPrix from the past three seasons has gone on to become World Champion.”The special poster features 2023 Formula E World Champion Jake Dennis from Andretti, then TAG Heuer Porsche’s Pascal Wehrlein, who won in 2024, and the new World Champion, Nissan driver Oliver Rowland. All three of them won in the Mexico E-Prix and went on to lift the winner’s trophy in the Formula E World Championship that year.Oliver Rowland had strengthened his chances of winning the Formula E World Championship this year much earlier. He was leading the Formula E Driver Standings ever since he won Part 2 of the Jeddah E-Prix, which was his second win of the season after winning the Mexico E-Prix. In the last leg, the Nissan driver got nervous for a while as Pascal Wehrlein, who was following him in the number two position, closed the gap after grabbing quite a few podiums while Rowland had a dull period.Things became serious for Rowland when he failed to finish the Round 13 race in Berlin, while Wehrlein won second spot on the podium. But he eventually managed to confirm his championship in Berlin after four wins and three more podiums.Sharing about his bad race in Berlin, Rowland had said, “I was hoping before the weekend that the outcome could be [the World Championship], but after yesterday (Saturday) and this morning (Sunday), I was more worried that it might never come.”Also Read: Oliver Rowland reacts to daughter’s sweet radio message after Formula E Championship win: “It’s amazing” Things, however, changed for Wehrlein, who was pushed to third position after Nick Cassidy made a late entry in the Formula E Driver Standings by registering three consecutive wins.

Wehrlein registered one win and five more podiums this season.Meanwhile, Andretti driver Jake Dennis finished in seventh position in the Formula E Driver Standings.

Taylor Barnard on losing top three spot in Formula E World Championship

Fans hail Taylor Barnard for his fantastic rookie season

It was Taylor Barnard’s rookie season this year, and the NEOM McLaren driver put up a fantastic performance by temporarily making it to the top three in the Formula E Driver Standings by ousting the much more experienced Porsche driver Antonio Felix Da Costa. He was, however, ousted from the top three at the London E-Prix as Jaguar’s Nick Cassidy went on to register three consecutive wins. Barnard took to Instagram to share his feelings on losing out on the top three in his first-ever season and his claim to the championship.Taking to Instagram after the London E-Prix, Barnard wrote, “London wasn’t what we hoped for, easily being the toughest weekend of our season. Taking 0 points away as a team from a doubleheader hurts, but one weekend doesn’t define the year we’ve had.”He further wrote, “As the season closes, I want to say a massive thank you to the entire team, both trackside and behind the scenes, for everything this season. Finishing P4 in the Drivers’ Championship and coming into the final weekend with a shot at runner-up is something to be proud of.”Also adding a note for teammate Sam Bird, as NEOM McLaren withdrew from Formula E after the end of the season, Barnard wrote, “@sambird_official it wasn’t the weekend you deserved either.You’ve been a huge part of my season both on and off the track, and I’m grateful for everything. You deserved more. To all the Papaya fans, thank you for the incredible support in our final race together. You always go above and beyond. ”Reacting to his post, a fan wrote, “An incredible debut season, huge congrats and excited to see where you go next!” Another said, “I know I said it the other day, but you’ve been incredible to watch this last year and a pleasure to support you in Papaya — there are many of us that can’t wait to support you in whatever you do next!” One more commented, “You were incredible all season around, Taylor. Massive congratulations. You are the future of this sport.”Recalling Barnard’s maiden pole, a fan also wrote, “Fantastic season, Taylor, we'll never forget that Monaco pole.”Also Read: Taylor Barnard looks back at rookie season at McLaren: “Every step has been unforgettable” Barnard claimed five podiums in his first full season in Formula E.

Through the early days, the good days, the bad days, and the great days, we have always felt an overwhelming amount of support from you all.”For the partners associated with the team, he wrote, “They say that ‘racing is a state of mind’, and since its inception, this team has had the privilege of working for organisations, with partners, and racing for fans who fully embrace this philosophy.This is certainly true of those at McLaren, whose passion for racing is second to none.”“My heartfelt thanks go out to everyone who has been involved: those at McLaren who backed us, the fans who supported us, and the partners who allowed us to go racing. We couldn’t have done it without you all — your trust and support have never been taken for granted,” he added.Praising the two McLaren drivers, he wrote, “Sam clinched McLaren’s first-ever fully electric win at the São Paulo E-Prix in Season 10, pulling off one of Formula E’s all-time great overtakes, before being waved across the line by none other than Emerson Fittipaldi – McLaren's first Formula 1 World Champion. While Taylor has been a rookie sensation in Season 11, securing five Formula E records, including the youngest driver to start a race, the youngest points scorer, the youngest driver to lead a lap, the youngest podium finisher, and the youngest polesitter. ”He ended the letter saying, “Some of us have been together since the day we first launched this team, while others have seamlessly fitted in along the way and flourished within the environment we have cultivated. For many, I am sure that we will cross paths again soon, but whatever the future holds for those here at Bicester, whatever path they choose to follow, I have no doubt that it will be bright. Their potential is limitless. ”Reacting to the open letter on Instagram, Taylor Barnard wrote, “It’s been an honour to wear Papaya and represent this team.” Sam Bird also dropped a heart emoji and a hands-joined-in-prayer emoji in the comments section.Also Read: Taylor Barnard looks back at rookie season at McLaren: “Every step has been unforgettable” Neither Taylor Barnard nor Sam Bird has revealed their future course of action in Formula E Season 12.

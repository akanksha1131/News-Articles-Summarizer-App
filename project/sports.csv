Inside India’s Asia Cup 2025 Training | Exclusive Ground Zero Coverage

While Team India cruised past the United Arab Emirates in their Asia Cup 2025 opener, their eyes were firmly on Afghanistan, one of Asia’s most formidable T20 sides. Sanju Samson Jitesh Sharma , and Arshdeep Singh were seen intently watching Afghanistan’s nets for half an hour on Thursday. Later, Rinku Singh joined the group, as India’s stars studied the nuances of their upcoming opponents.Afghanistan had made a statement in their opening match, thrashing Hong Kong by 94 runs. Sediqullah Atal and Azmatullah Omarzai’s half-centuries, combined with Hong Kong’s top-order collapse, turned the game into a one-sided affair. Atal’s aggressive hitting, especially in the death overs, and Omarzai’s rapid 20-ball fifty showcased the firepower India will need to be wary of.For Team India, the focus was clear: understanding the strengths, tactics, and variations of Afghanistan’s key players. Samson, Pandya, and co. observed every move of the Afghanistan.India themselves had no trouble against UAE, bowling them out for just 57 before chasing the target in 4.3 overs. But while the victory was clinical, the players knew the real test would come against Afghanistan, whose spin variations could prove challenging.India’s focus on Afghanistan comes ahead of a high-stakes Group A clash against Pakistan on Sunday, September 14. Pakistan began their Asia Cup campaign with a clinical 93-run win over Oman, powered by Mohammad Haris’s 66 and a disciplined spin attack that bowled Oman out for 67 in just 16.4 overs. With both India and Pakistan unbeaten in the tournament so far, Sunday’s showdown in Dubai promises to be a thrilling contest.","Sanju Samson, Hardik Pandya, Jitesh Sharma and Arshdeep Singh watched Afghanistan nets closely.

Poll What was the most impressive aspect of England's 304-run total against South Africa? Phil Salt's 141 not out Jos Buttler's 83 runs 18 sixes hit by the team Breaking the 300-run barrier

When England stormed past the 300-run mark in Manchester on Friday night, the cricketing world stood still for a moment. Phil Salt’s breathtaking 141 not out, coupled with Jos Buttler ’s blazing 83, powered England to 304-2 against South Africa. It was the first time in a T20 international between two Test-playing nations that the 300 barrier was breached.Yet, for all the celebrations at Old Trafford, it still wasn’t the highest total ever made in men’s T20 internationals. That honour belongs to Zimbabwe, who stunned the record books last October with a staggering 344-4 against Gambia in Nairobi. Nepal also sit ahead of England on the charts, thanks to their 314-3 against Mongolia during the Asian Games in 2023.So while Salt and Buttler were rewriting English history, they were still some way off the all-time summit. India, too, remain in that elite club of near-300 giants, having posted 297-6 against Bangladesh in Hyderabad last year. Zimbabwe appear again in the top five, with 286-5 against Seychelles in Nairobi in 2024.For England, the achievement is still monumental. From the moment Salt carved Marco Jansen’s opening deliveries to the boundary, the intent was clear.The hosts smashed 18 sixes and 30 fours, leaving the South African attack in tatters. Salt’s hundred in just 39 balls not only broke Liam Livingstone’s England record but also lit up his home ground in style.South Africa’s chase was always a formality. Aiden Markram fought briefly with 41, but Jofra Archer ’s fiery 3-25 ensured the visitors folded for 158. It was their heaviest defeat in T20 internationals and England’s biggest win by runs.As Harry Brook said afterwards, “Me and Jos were stood out there and said we never thought anyone would get 300.” England proved otherwise.","England reached 304-2 against South Africa at Old Trafford on Friday.

Real Madrid’s defensive plans have taken a hit as centre-back Antonio Rudiger faces a lengthy spell on the sidelines following a muscle injury in his left leg. The German international, 32, suffered the setback during training on Friday, and early reports suggest he could be out for around two months.The club confirmed in a statement that scans revealed an injury to Rudiger’s rectus femoris muscle. While Real Madrid did not provide an exact recovery timeline, Spanish outlet AS described the injury as “serious.” The veteran defender has only featured once in La Liga this season, after managing 55 appearances for the club last year despite battling through injuries.Rudiger’s absence leaves Real with limited options at centre-back, though the club strengthened the position this summer by signing 20-year-old Dean Huijsen from Bournemouth. Reports also suggest that Real Madrid are keeping an eye on Liverpool’s France international Ibrahima Konaté, potentially as reinforcement at the end of the season.The Spanish champions face a busy schedule ahead, with a La Liga trip to Real Sociedad on Saturday followed by their Champions League opener against Marseille on Tuesday. Manager Carlo Ancelotti will be forced to reshuffle his defensive lineup in the absence of Rüdiger.Meanwhile, Jude Bellingham, who has been managing a shoulder injury, has opted for surgery following his Club World Cup commitments. The England midfielder has now begun rehabilitation, with Real Madrid hopeful of seeing him return later this season.With Rudiger sidelined and Bellingham recovering, Real Madrid will need to rely on squad depth as they juggle domestic and European challenges in the opening months of the campaign.",Antonio Rudiger faces a lengthy spell on the sidelines with a muscle injury.

Former Pakistan cricketer Kamran Akmal shared his thoughts on the upcoming India vs Pakistan fixture in an interview with Telecom Asia Sport. He acknowledged the tense times between the two countries but said the match could help improve relations. ""These are tough times in India-Pakistan relations. It will be tense, and that is why there are fears. But I think it will get better only if the game goes well,"" Akmal said.He also urged fans to behave responsibly in the stadium. ""Fans should show a big heart and come together to enjoy the full match. It should be an atmosphere like in the past. I request fans not to cross the line, whether they are from Pakistan or India. They must make the match successful so that Indo-Pak matches continue,"" he added.Akmal stressed that aggression is part of the India-Pakistan rivalry but players must keep it under control. ""Aggression is the beauty of an India-Pakistan match. How to take that aggression is the key. Respect should be there. Players will have to remember cricket is a gentleman’s game. If they keep that in mind, I am sure Sunday’s match will go untroubled,"" he said.He cited an example from last year in Oman where Sufiyan Muqeem and Abhishek Sharma had a verbal clash during an ‘A’ team match. ""Aggression will always be there, but it should be controlled,"" Akmal explained.Looking back at his own career, Akmal recalled a misunderstanding during the 2010 Asia Cup with India’s current head coach Gautam Gambhir . ""It was a misunderstanding. Gautam is a very good person. We had toured Kenya together for an ‘A’ team event and became good friends. In that Asia Cup match, I appealed when he missed a shot. He was talking to himself about the miss, but I thought he said something to me. That’s how the misunderstanding happened,"" he said.Pakistan will open their Asia Cup campaign on Friday against Oman. India began their tournament with a win over UAE.The fixture has drawn some criticism in India, with some citizens questioning whether the national team should face Pakistan.

Dubai: In the not-so-merry-goround world of Pakistan cricket, Mike Hesson is the latest to take the ride as head coach. Pakistan enjoyed a fair bit of success under the New Zealander, winning 10 of their 14 T20Is since he took charge in May. However, his first major test comes on Sunday when his men face arch-rivals India in a Group A clash of the Asia Cup at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium.Hesson is no stranger to the pressures of elite cricket. Apart from guiding New Zealand to the 2015 ODI World Cup final, the 50-year-old coached Punjab Kings in the IPL and served as Director of Cricket Operations for Royal Challengers Bengaluru for four seasons. He was also a regular pundit on Indian television before taking over as Pakistan’s white-ball coach.India hold a commanding 9-3 lead over Pakistan in T20Is, but Hesson appeared unfazed by the challenge ahead. “I’ve certainly watched many games from afar — whether while coaching other teams or commentating — so being on the other side of the fence, right in the middle of such a highly charged event, is going to be exciting,” Hesson told reporters on the eve of Pakistan’s match against Oman.“Just like in any final or major event, it’s about keeping everyone focused on the job at hand. That won’t be any different this weekend. We know India are hugely confident — and rightfully so, given how well they’ve played — but we’re focused on improving as a team day by day and not getting ahead of ourselves.”On Wednesday, Indian wrist spinners Kuldeep Yadav and Varun Chakravarthy ran through the UAE batting order. While Pakistan’s line-up is certainly a step up, doubts remain about their ability to pick quality wrist spin. In the recently concluded tri-series involving Pakistan, Afghanistan, and UAE, only captain Salman Ali Agha and Mohammad Nawaz looked assured against Afghanistan’s spinners. The rest of the batting order struggled to read the ball out of the hand — a concern with India’s spin duo looming large.Hesson, however, dismissed those fears. “I really don’t know where that’s come from or who would make that assessment,” he said. “We’ve played against Rashid (Khan), Noor Ahmad — probably the best wrist-spin attack in the world — on a surface in Sharjah that turned square, and we still scored 70 more than the opposition. So, I’m not quite sure where that perception comes from,” Hesson stressed.When asked if spin could dominate Sunday’s contest, given the nature of pitches here and the quality of wrist-spinners on both sides, Hesson was pragmatic. “I don’t think you can expect this pitch to spin like it did in Sharjah. Even on Wednesday, when Kuldeep bowled, it didn’t turn a huge amount. Whenever you’ve got wrist-spinners like that, the surface matters less. The beauty of our side is that we’ve got five spin options,” he assured.Hesson then lined up the spin and seam options that Pakistan possess. “Mohammad Nawaz has been ranked the No. 1 spin bowler in the world over the last six months, Abrar Ahmed and Sufiyan Muqeem have been excellent, and Salman Ali Agha — our Test spinner has hardly bowled yet. If the conditions suit spin, we’re well covered. If they don’t, we’ve got five seamers who give us options whether it’s air speed, change of pace, or reverse swing — depending on what the pitch offers. ”",Pakistan face arch-rivals India in a Group A clash of the Asia Cup.

Poll Do you think Vinayak Shukla will become a key player for Oman in future international tournaments? Yes No

Vinayak Shukla’s rise has been swift since breaking into Oman’s national side late last year. The wicketkeeper-batter, now 31, has already carved a reputation as a middle-order striker who can shift the momentum in T20 cricket.Shukla announced himself on debut in December 2024, blasting 40 off just 18 balls against Qatar to propel Oman past 200 in a commanding victory. Less than a week later, he underlined his potential with his first international half-century. Walking in at 67 for 4 against Kuwait, Shukla steadied the innings before accelerating to an unbeaten 52 from 29 deliveries.His attacking game has quickly made him Oman’s preferred option with both bat and gloves in the shortest format. In eight T20Is, Shukla has scored 190 runs at an average of 31.66 and a strike rate of 146.15, with one fifty to his name.His boundary count of 17 fours and seven sixes reflects his ability to clear the field, while his glovework has also been reliable with one catch and one stumping recorded so far. In ODIs, he has 9 catches and 3 stumpings.Shukla’s consistency earned him a place in the ODI side earlier this year, and he was included in Oman’s squad for their maiden Asia Cup campaign in Dubai. He was named in the XI for their opening match against Pakistan at Dubai International Cricket Stadium on Friday, where Oman restricted their opponents to 160 for 7.Born on June 18, 1994, the right-hander may have arrived late on the international stage, but his early returns suggest he could be a crucial figure for Oman’s batting unit moving forward.",Vinayak Shukla made his Oman debut in December 2024.

Brief scores: South Zone (I innings): 149 all out in 63 overs (Tanmay Agarwal 31; Kumar Kartikeya 4-53, Saransh Jain 5-49) vs Central Zone (O/N:50/0): 384/5 in 104 overs (Danish Malewar 53, Rajat Patidar 101, Yash Rathod 137 batting, Saransh Jain batting 47; Gurjapneet Singh 3/74).

BENGALURU: After lunch on Friday as South Zone skipper Mohammed Azharuddeen led his team back to the field, he glanced at the Duleep Trophy placed along the boundary line. He knew his team’s hope of laying hands on the trophy was slipping away, and their move to go with four pacers had backfired. On a rather flat deck with some assistance for spinners, South Zone went into the final with a solo specialist spinner, Ankit Sharma, and they paid heavily for it.On Friday, Central skipper Rajat Patidar (101; 115b; 12x4; 2x6) and Yash Rathod (137 n.o; 188b; 11x4; 1x6) scored elegant centuries to stretch their lead to 235. After bowling out South for a paltry 149 on Day 1, Central were 384/5 in 104 overs when stumps were drawn.The match being played at the BCCI Centre of Excellence on the outskirts of the city is closed to the public, but that hasn’t stopped people from standing along the compound wall. That handful of spectators was treated to a sumptuous feast of runs.Patidar, who was overlooked for India ‘A’ series against Australia ‘A’, continued to pile runs, scoring his second century of the tournament.The Madhya Pradesh batter, who has scores of 125, 66, and 77 in the previous two games, didn't take long to get down to business. On the third ball he faced —bowled by V Koushik—he found the gap through mid-off and followed it up with an elegantly struck four through midwicket.Patidar put on a display of T20 temperament coupled with red-ball pedigree. He used his wrist artistically and found gaps with ease. He put Central ahead past the 150-mark with a boundary through backward square leg off Ricky Bhui.On 44, he got a lifeline. Patidar was trapped in front by left-arm spinner Ankit, but off a no-ball. Patidar went a tad quiet after that, but brought up his half-century (73b) off a delectable late-cut through point.Bhui, who kept wickets for South in the 2023 edition of the tournament, didn't trouble the batters with his leg spin; instead, Patidar took a special liking towards him.Having upped the scoring after crossing 50, Patidar danced down the pitch to hit Bhui over long-on for his first six.There were no nervous 90s for Patidar, as he approached the century with a drive through extra covers off Gurjapneet Singh and then added an upper cut maximum.He sneaked a single to bring up his 15th First-Class century and soon fell to a short delivery from Gurjapneet, which he gloved to wicketkeeper Azharuddeen.At the other end, Rathod, who shared a 167-run association with Patidar, continued to blunt the tiring South attack.Rathod, the previous season's highest Ranji Trophy run getter, took time to get an eye in. He got off the mark on the 20th delivery he faced and was beaten regularly for a while before settling down. He upped his game after bringing up his half-century with a boundary off Gurjapneet. In the last 10 overs of play, Rathod went into a shell, but given the way he batted earlier, it holds promise of more on Saturday.Earlier, South would have fancied their chances after their pacers tied down the Central batters with a disciplined line and length backed by movement.While V Koushik dislodged Akshay Wadkar's off-stump, Gurjapneet sent Shubham Sharma's middle stump flying. Danish Malewar (53) then settled the Central nerves with a half-century.","Central Zone captain Rajat Patidar and Yash Rathod score elegant centuries to stretch their lead to 235.

Poll Who do you think will win the Asia Cup match between Pakistan and India? Pakistan India

Cricket legend Wasim Akram believes Pakistan can rise to the occasion against defending champions India when the two rivals collide in the Asia Cup in Dubai on Sunday. The contest, their first meeting since May’s military conflict, has already gripped fans worldwide.India enter as clear favourites, having won 18 of 21 T20 internationals since lifting last year’s World Cup. They made a statement in their opener against the UAE, cruising to a nine-wicket win. Pakistan, however, carry momentum from their recent tri-series victory over Afghanistan and UAE.“I think it will be a competitive match,” Wasim told Telecom Asia Sport. “Yes, India are a good and strong team and if you compare these two teams player-wise India look strong, but I think Pakistan will have the confidence of winning the tri-series and will give a good competition.”The former captain welcomed Pakistan’s transition under Salman Agha and Mike Hesson but warned patience is vital. “Pakistan is a young side with a good captain and a good head coach, so they need time to settle into a stronger unit. We, as a nation, need quick results which will not come,” he said.He flagged concerns over Mohammad Haris’ role in the batting order. “For me they have a few problems, like Mohammad Haris is not in the best of form but he is not playing at his usual number as opener,” Wasim noted, adding, “It’s tough on Haris… it’s next to impossible for an opener to bat in the middle order.”Bowling depth, too, remains a worry as per the 59-year-old. “You cannot have two part-time bowlers as a fifth bowling option. If you have two part-timers then the team will attack them,” Wasim warned.While highlighting Pakistan’s challenges, Akram did not hold back in his praise for India’s depth. “Kuldeep and Varun are both good. It’s tough to read them. Kuldeep was very accurate and lethal the other day,” he said, crediting India’s system and infrastructure for sustained excellence.On Jasprit Bumrah too, Akram heaped praise, highlighting how difficult it is for a pacer like him in the modern game. “Bumrah is top of the ladder and is being managed well by India.

Sitanshu Kotak press conference: On Sanju Samson position, no Arshdeep in XI, India v Pakistan

With anticipation building for the Asia Cup 2025 clash between India and Pakistan on Sunday, Team India batter Sanju Samson has emerged as a central talking point.India’s batting coach Sitanshu Kotak, however, confirmed on Friday that while Samson has not regularly featured at No. 5 or 6, he is ready to embrace the challenge.“Sanju has not batted at 5-6, but he is happy to take the challenge,” Kotak told reporters on the sidelines of the Team India's net session at the ICC Academy.The team management, however, has kept its cards close when it comes to the final XI.On Arshdeep Singh’s chances, Kotak clarified: “Playing XI will be decided after having a look at the wicket. There is no agenda. There is no personal liking and disliking. All 15 are capable to play. It is all about what the coach and captain wants.”When asked about the high-voltage India-Pakistan encounter, Kotak stressed focus over hype, adding, “We are here to play, we are here to be competitive.”The coach also shed light on team dynamics. “After openers all the batters are floaters. All the players are ready to take the challenge.Shivam Dube is capable to bowl four overs. We have more than one finisher in our team. Shivam, Hardik and Axar can take any attack. It is great to have three or four players who can finish the job,” Kotak explained.On workload management, he drew a clear line: “Workload management is for bowlers, not batters. Only if batters feel that he needs a break then only we give them the break.”Defending champions India come into the match on the back of a commanding nine-wicket win against hosts UAE. With the Indian side confident and Samson tipped for a key role in the middle order, Sunday’s fixture in Dubai promises another chapter in cricket ’s most intense rivalry.",India's batting coach Sitanshu Kotak confirms Sanju Samson has not regularly featured at No. 5 or 6.

Poll Who do you think will win the Asia Cup clash between India and Pakistan? India Pakistan

As India and Pakistan prepare for their Asia Cup Group A clash in Dubai on September 14, memories of heated moments from the past resurface, showing just how the rivalry often spills beyond cricketing skill into raw emotion.One of the most infamous incidents came in 2007 during an ODI in Kanpur, where current India head coach Gautam Gambhir and Shahid Afridi’s tempers flared in full view of a packed stadium.Afridi, frustrated at conceding runs, was already on edge when Gambhir struck him for a boundary. The all-rounder responded with a taunt, and the tension escalated quickly. On the very next delivery, as Gambhir attempted a single, the two collided mid-pitch. Heated words followed, forcing umpire Ian Gould to step in and separate them before matters worsened.The aftermath saw disciplinary action. Match referee Roshan Mahanama fined Afridi 95 percent of his match fee, while Gambhir was docked 65 percent, reflecting the seriousness with which the confrontation was viewed.Such moments are part of a rivalry shaped not only by cricket but also by the nations’ political backdrop.The upcoming meeting has already drawn wider attention, with a public interest litigation filed in India’s Supreme Court seeking cancellation of the fixture. Meanwhile, former Pakistan captain Rashid Latif has warned his team against letting emotions override tactics. “We get emotional or hyper and try to do everything in one go… India on the other hand play according to the pitch and match situation and that’s why they succeed,” he told PTI.Latif also praised India’s balance, citing Hardik Pandya as “the X-factor” and calling Jasprit Bumrah “a huge asset” in the bowling department.While India began their campaign with a resounding nine-wicket win over UAE, Pakistan are set to open against Oman. But for fans, Sunday’s clash remains the pinnacle, in a contest of skill, pride, and history.","Gautam Gambhir and Shahid Afridi collided mid-pitch during an ODI in 2007.

Ashwin's Instagram post

Ravichandran Ashwin may have bid farewell to the cricket field, but he continues to win hearts off it. The veteran off-spinner lit up Instagram on Friday by posting a warm, romantic picture with his wife Prithi Narayanan, reminding fans that beyond the numbers and milestones, there is a man deeply devoted to family and love.Ashwin’s post comes weeks after he announced the end of his Indian Premier League journey.Having retired from international cricket in December 2024, the 38-year-old confirmed that he would no longer feature in the IPL , signing off with Chennai Super Kings , the franchise where his story began.Speaking on his YouTube channel, Ashwin revealed that the demanding three-month tournament had taken a toll.“I was thinking if I can play IPL next year. Three months of IPL is a little too much for me. It’s draining. This is one of the reasons why I’m awe-struck by seeing someone like MS Dhoni. As you grow older, the bandwidth to play IPL becomes lesser,” he admitted.His candid reflections came amid speculation about CSK’s auction strategy, but Ashwin clarified that the decision was personal.He also hinted at exploring global opportunities, with links to The Hundred in England and South Africa’s SA20.“They say every ending has a new start,” he wrote in his farewell message.“My time as an IPL cricketer comes to a close today, but my time as an explorer of the game around various leagues begins today.”Over 16 IPL seasons, Ashwin played 221 matches, taking 187 wickets with an economy rate of 7.20, while also contributing 833 runs. His tactical acumen and fighting spirit made him a vital asset across teams including CSK, Rajasthan Royals, Punjab Kings, Delhi Capitals, and Rising Pune Supergiant.As he embraces life after the IPL, Ashwin’s romantic gesture online shows that while cricket may have defined his career, love and family continue to define the man.","Ravichandran Ashwin posts romantic picture with wife Prithi Narayanan.

Athletic Bilbao have confirmed the return of Spanish defender Aymeric Laporte after FIFA authorized his move from Al Nassr in the Saudi Pro League. The switch had stalled on deadline day due to administrative delays, but the world football governing body has now allowed the registration to be completed.Athletic Bilbao released an official statement confirming FIFA had granted Spain’s football federation (RFEF) the authority to secure the International Transfer Certificate from Saudi Arabia . This cleared the way for Laporte’s registration in La Liga.The transfer had initially collapsed on September 1, when Al Nassr reportedly failed to input key details into FIFA’s Transfer Matching System. That omission prevented the paperwork from being validated before the deadline. The RFEF appealed the decision, and FIFA has now ruled in favour of the Spanish side.FIFA’s decision to overturn its earlier refusal has provided clarity for both Laporte and Bilbao. The club regains a player who made over 160 La Liga appearances in his first spell, while Laporte secures a return to the team where his professional career began.The incident also underlined the challenges of coordinating moves between European clubs and the Saudi Pro League.Despite the league’s financial growth and international talent pool, the registration delays remain a recurring issue.During his two seasons with Al Nassr, Laporte played alongside global stars such as Cristiano Ronaldo , Sadio Mané, and Marcelo Brozović. While he was a consistent presence in defence, changes in the squad meant his long-term future was uncertain.Now, the Euro 2024 winner has returned to Athletic Bilbao with a wealth of experience. His time at Manchester City saw him win 13 trophies, including five Premier League titles and the UEFA Champions League Supporters at San Mamés are preparing a warm welcome and are hopeful that Laporte’s leadership and defensive skills can help push the club forward.",Athletic Bilbao have confirmed the return of Aymeric Laporte from Al Nassr.

Anthony Martial is set to join Monterrey as per several reports (Screengrab)

Poll Do you think Anthony Martial will be a success at Monterrey? Yes, definitely No, not at all

Anthony Martial is on the verge of a move to Liga MX side Monterrey, with reports suggesting the French forward has agreed terms and will undergo a medical in Mexico.The 29-year-old, released by Manchester United at the end of the 2023/24 season, had joined AEK Athens on a free transfer last summer. Despite being handed what was described as the biggest contract in the Greek club’s history, Martial struggled to make an impact, featuring in just 24 games across competitions. He has not been included in the squad for AEK’s last six fixtures.Transfer journalist Fabrizio Romano reported that Monterrey and Martial have reached an agreement, with the move pending medical clearance. Fellow Mexican side Pumas were also in the race but failed to finalise a deal after Martial declined to lower his wage demands.As per reports from journalist Cesar Luis Merlo, AEK were willing to loan him to Pumas free of charge (they should only pay his salary), but Martial earns a massive salary.Martial, who joined United from Monaco in 2015 for an initial £36m, went on to score 90 goals in 317 appearances for the Premier League club. His imminent switch to Monterrey comes just months after the Mexican side secured the signing of former Real Madrid defender Sergio Ramos.Should the move go through, Martial will link up with the 39-year-old veteran, who has already helped Monterrey climb to the top of the Liga MX standings with six wins from their opening seven matches.","Anthony Martial is on the verge of a move to Monterrey, according to reports.

Poll Should the identities of individuals involved in such cases be kept confidential until proven guilty? Yes, to protect their rights. No, transparency is important.

Former Premier League referee David Coote has pleaded not guilty to a charge of making an indecent video of a child. The 43-year-old, from Newark, appeared before Nottingham Magistrates’ Court on Thursday.Coote, who was dismissed by referees’ body PGMOL in 2024, faces an accusation of making one “category A” video of a child on January 2, 2020. Category A offences are considered the most serious, involving acts such as downloading, sharing or saving indecent material.Ben Payne, prosecuting, told the court that the matter came to light during an FA investigation into Coote, when mobile devices were examined by a third party. He also added that following a police investigation, Coote was arrested at his home, where two laptops were seized, as per AFP. A video involving a 15-year-old child was subsequently found.Payne said that that the “starting point for sentencing was a year in custody” and said the case was suitable for Magistrates’ Court. However, Coote used his right for a jury trial and requested the matter be sent to Crown Court. A pre-trial hearing at Nottingham Crown Court has been set for October 9.Earlier, defence solicitor Fraser Williamson applied to restrict publication of Coote’s home address, citing safety concerns following threats he had received during his officiating career. District Judge Gillian Young rejected the application.Coote remains on bail under conditions that prohibit him from having unsupervised contact with anyone under 18 or residing in a household with a minor without approval.","Former Premier League referee David Coote has pleaded not guilty to a charge of making an indecent video of a child.

The Blue Colts, already having beaten Bahrain 2-0 and narrowly losing to hosts Qatar 1-2, finished their campaign with six points, leaving qualification hopes dependent on other results.Midfielder Vibin Mohanan was the star of the show, scoring a rapid-fire hat-trick in the 5th, 7th, and 62nd minutes. Ayush Chhetri (41’) and Mohammed Aimen (87’, 90+7’) added three more for a comprehensive victory.India wasted no time asserting dominance, with Muhammed Suhail’s cutback setting up Vibin for the opener in the fifth minute, followed by a looping second goal that left Brunei goalkeeper helpless. A fine one-two between Chhetri and Sreekuttan MS set up India’s third, before Vibin completed his hat-trick with a curling free-kick in the second half. Aimen’s long-range strikes sealed the emphatic 6-0 win.However, the celebrations in Doha were overshadowed by security concerns.Several explosions were reported across the Qatari capital, with smoke rising over the Katara district. Israeli media cited senior officials, reporting that the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and Israeli Security Agency (ISA) targeted senior Hamas leaders allegedly responsible for orchestrating attacks against Israel, including the October 7 strikes.The IDF stated that “precise munitions” were used with additional intelligence to minimise civilian casualties. Israeli Prime Minister confirmed full responsibility, while US President Donald Trump reportedly approved the operation, according to Israeli Channel 12.Despite the tense backdrop, India’s youngsters remained focused on the pitch, dominating Brunei with clinical finishing and controlled possession.

What’s common between the three Formula E world champions

How the three World Champions fared in Formula E Season 11

Days after Oliver Rowland lifted his Formula E World Championship trophy in London this season, an interesting trend has come to the attention of Formula E and its fans. As a coincidence, all Formula E drivers who won the Mexico City E-Prix went on to win the Formula E World Championship that season, and this has been proved right for three consecutive years.Highlighting the same since 2023, a poster of three World Champions was shared on X by Formula E with the caption, “The trend continues. Each winner of the #MexicoCityEPrix from the past three seasons has gone on to become World Champion.”The special poster features 2023 Formula E World Champion Jake Dennis from Andretti, then TAG Heuer Porsche’s Pascal Wehrlein, who won in 2024, and the new World Champion, Nissan driver Oliver Rowland. All three of them won in the Mexico E-Prix and went on to lift the winner’s trophy in the Formula E World Championship that year.Oliver Rowland had strengthened his chances of winning the Formula E World Championship this year much earlier. He was leading the Formula E Driver Standings ever since he won Part 2 of the Jeddah E-Prix, which was his second win of the season after winning the Mexico E-Prix. In the last leg, the Nissan driver got nervous for a while as Pascal Wehrlein, who was following him in the number two position, closed the gap after grabbing quite a few podiums while Rowland had a dull period.Things became serious for Rowland when he failed to finish the Round 13 race in Berlin, while Wehrlein won second spot on the podium. But he eventually managed to confirm his championship in Berlin after four wins and three more podiums.Sharing about his bad race in Berlin, Rowland had said, “I was hoping before the weekend that the outcome could be [the World Championship], but after yesterday (Saturday) and this morning (Sunday), I was more worried that it might never come.”Also Read: Oliver Rowland reacts to daughter’s sweet radio message after Formula E Championship win: “It’s amazing” Things, however, changed for Wehrlein, who was pushed to third position after Nick Cassidy made a late entry in the Formula E Driver Standings by registering three consecutive wins.

Wehrlein registered one win and five more podiums this season.Meanwhile, Andretti driver Jake Dennis finished in seventh position in the Formula E Driver Standings.

Taylor Barnard on losing top three spot in Formula E World Championship

Fans hail Taylor Barnard for his fantastic rookie season

You always go above and beyond. ”Reacting to his post, a fan wrote, “An incredible debut season, huge congrats and excited to see where you go next!” Another said, “I know I said it the other day, but you’ve been incredible to watch this last year and a pleasure to support you in Papaya — there are many of us that can’t wait to support you in whatever you do next!” One more commented, “You were incredible all season around, Taylor.

We couldn’t have done it without you all — your trust and support have never been taken for granted,” he added.Praising the two McLaren drivers, he wrote, “Sam clinched McLaren’s first-ever fully electric win at the São Paulo E-Prix in Season 10, pulling off one of Formula E’s all-time great overtakes, before being waved across the line by none other than Emerson Fittipaldi – McLaren's first Formula 1 World Champion. While Taylor has been a rookie sensation in Season 11, securing five Formula E records, including the youngest driver to start a race, the youngest points scorer, the youngest driver to lead a lap, the youngest podium finisher, and the youngest polesitter. ”He ended the letter saying, “Some of us have been together since the day we first launched this team, while others have seamlessly fitted in along the way and flourished within the environment we have cultivated. For many, I am sure that we will cross paths again soon, but whatever the future holds for those here at Bicester, whatever path they choose to follow, I have no doubt that it will be bright.

After a successful Season 11, ABB and Formula E have announced that they will continue their partnership in the upcoming season. This gives ABB another opportunity to promote its new brand positioning via the ABB FIA Formula E World Championship, along with technologies that help industries take a cleaner route.Over a period of eight seasons, the partnership with Formula E has provided ABB a platform to showcase how technology can help industries outrun challenges, engage with customers around the world, and implement its own solutions into the series to improve reliability and efficiency. The partnership extension will provide a year-round opportunity for brand-building and activation, communicating ABB and its technology solutions to new global audiences, including Formula E’s international fanbase.ABB and Formula E will also join hands to engage a new generation of fans, collaborating with unexpected influencers and content creators to tell compelling stories that make advanced electrification and automation technologies tangible and exciting.The end of the mid-race car swap, a 150kW increase in power, top speeds that are 43 percent higher, and energy recovery increasing from 15 to 50 percent indicate how far Formula E technology has come to outperform on track.ABB has also built on its technical involvement in the series, supplying the race chargers from Season 9, and introducing its ABB Ability OPTIMAX® energy management software (Season 9) and Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) technology (Season 5) to the sport.ABB Head of Brand Paco Liebrand said, “We are pleased to be continuing our partnership with Formula E which, like ABB, is striving for a leaner and cleaner future. The synergy between the two organizations, combined with the global appeal of the Championship, makes it a great platform to promote our brand positioning.”He further said, “Formula E is increasingly working with content creators, influencers, and celebrities, with initiatives such as the Evo Sessions making an impact through digital channels beyond the racing itself, which is also an essential part of ABB’s new brand strategy. Going forward, we will be enhancing the way we harness the benefits of this collaboration, ensuring the focus is on delivering content and activations that reinforce our new messaging, build familiarity, and tell the ‘Engineered to Outrun’ story. ”Formula E Chief Revenue Officer Tiziana Di Gioia said, “Our renewed partnership with ABB is a testament to the commercial power and benefit of Formula E as a global platform that drives both brand and business growth. ABB, like our wider partnership portfolio, has and continues to see enormous value in collaborating with the fastest-growing motorsport on the planet, with viewership, commercial integration, and brand storytelling continuing to accelerate. Over eight seasons, ABB has moved from brand visibility to brand activation—integrating deeply into the fan experience, the sport’s ecosystem, and our innovation narrative.Also Read: Antonio Felix Da Costa shares happy memories as Porsche wins Formula E Teams and Manufacturers’ World Championships “This next chapter elevates the partnership even further.

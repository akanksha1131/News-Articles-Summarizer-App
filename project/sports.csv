NEW DELHI: The spin duo of Kuldeep Yadav and Varun Chakravarthy will be eagerly awaiting the selectors’ call as India’s squad for the Asia Cup 2025, scheduled from September 9, is set to be announced. Both would be keen to get their hands on leather and rattle the opposition.The two spinners come into the tournament with different recent history.Kuldeep spent the entire tour of England on the bench. Carrying drinks, passing on messages from the coaching staff, and quietly watching his teammates from the dressing room was all the chinaman managed over five Tests.Now, with the Asia Cup squad to be revealed on Tuesday (August 19), Kuldeep will be hoping to don the India blues, even if he didn't get the chance to wear the whites.The 30-year-old last featured in a T20I in the 2024 T20 World Cup, where he picked up 10 wickets in five matches. Overall, Kuldeep has played 40 T20Is, claiming 69 wickets, including two five-wicket hauls.Known for his deceptive wrong ’uns and sharp flippers, he remains a potent threat to batters, especially in UAE's spin-friendly conditions.While Kuldeep hasn’t played a T20I in the UAE, he has featured in ODIs there.He was also part of India’s victorious squads in the 2018 and 2023 editions of the Asia Cup (both in the ODI format).Varun Chakravarthy, meanwhile, has been in excellent form since making his international return last year.The 33-year-old mystery spinner, armed with nine different variations, has already produced match-winning spells, including two five-wicket hauls in T20Is and another in ODIs during India’s ICC Champions Trophy triumph.In his short T20I career so far, he has bagged 33 wickets in 18 matches.Kuldeep’s coach Kapil Pandey believes both bowlers are primed to shine at the Asia Cup and could form a dangerous partnership with Varun.""Every cricketer feels upset if he doesn’t get a chance. Kuldeep was sad too. But I told him — whatever has gone is gone, it’s time to look forward. He is really looking forward to a chance in the Asia Cup. He is hungry for wickets. India will benefit hugely from Kuldeep. And if he forms a combo with Varun, then the opposition will have a tough time. Varun is a solid bowler. They both complement each other when on the field,"" Kapil told TimesofIndia.com.""Opposition teams were scared of Kuldeep, and now they are scared of Varun too. If India play Pakistan, it will be a night to remember. These two guys will completely outfox them. They will not give them time to think. Kuldeep is very hungry right now,"" the coach added.India have been placed in Group A alongside Oman, hosts UAE, and arch-rivals Pakistan. Group B consists of Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Hong Kong, and Sri Lanka.With the Asia Cup followed by the 2026 T20 World Cup, the tournament provides both Kuldeep and Varun with the perfect opportunity to stake their claim for long-term spots in India’s T20I setup.","Kuldeep Yadav and Varun Chakravarthy will be hoping to shine at the Asia Cup 2025.

Poll Do you agree with Rayudu's statement that 'God was with us'? Yes, it's a matter of fate No, skill was the deciding factor I think it's a mix of both I don't believe in fate

NEW DELHI: Former Indian cricketer Ambati Rayudu has shed new light on one of the most debated moments from the T20 World Cup 2024 final between India and South Africa — Suryakumar Yadav ’s boundary catch to dismiss David Miller. According to Rayudu, the catch became possible because the boundary rope had been unintentionally pushed back earlier in the day when broadcast equipment was placed near the rope.Rayudu’s revelation comes more than a year after India’s title-winning final against South Africa, where Suryakumar’s stunning effort at the boundary was remembered as one of the defining moments.The dismissal, which turned out to be a defining moment in India’s triumph, drew scrutiny when replays showed the rope appeared to be positioned differently than usual.Speaking on the Unfiltered Podcast, Rayudu, who was part of the commentary team during the final, explained: ""There were world feed commentators. During the break, what usually happens is they put a chair there and a screen in order to help the broadcasters see what is happening. That is why they pushed the rope backwards a little bit. But, they left it like that (even after taking the screen and the chair away). That is how the boundary became a little bigger for us. We (the commentators) could see it from above. It was god's plan.""When asked whether the shot would have cleared the boundary under normal circumstances, Rayudu replied:""I don't know if it was a six (in natural circumstances) or not.If the rope had been placed at its normal position, maybe Surya would've run from inside.""Despite the controversy, Rayudu insisted the dismissal was legitimate. ""End of the day, God was with us,"" he said, adding that it was a “clean catch.”The rope placement sparked reactions from several current and former cricketers at the time, though the debate eventually faded.",Former Indian cricketer Ambati Rayudu has shed new light on one of the most debated moments from the T20 World Cup 2024 final between India and South Africa.

The focus is likely to be on maintaining continuity and keeping faith in the young and successful T20 specialists when the Indian selectors meet here at the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) headquarters on Tuesday to pick the squad for the Asia Cup (to be played in the T20 format) in the UAE, scheduled from September 9-28.The meeting will be attended by India's T20 captain Suryakumar Yadav , who will fly in from Bengaluru after clearing his fitness test at the BCCI's Centre of Excellence (CoE), which means SKY stays on as India’s T20 captain, possibly till the 2026 T20 World Cup in India and Sri Lanka.Contrary to expectations, star batter and India's Test captain Shubman Gill , who was tipped in some quarters to take over the vice-captaincy role in the T20 format after a highly successful tour of England, where he scored 754 runs in five Tests @75.40 with a top score of 269, is currently struggling to even make it to what is likely to be not more than a 15-man squad -- unless head coach Gautam Gambhir pushes for his inclusion in the T20 format too.""Gill is a terrific batsman, all the selectors and head coach Gautam Gambhir are huge fans of his batting, and he is rated almost as highly as Virat Kohli in India’s cricket circles in terms of potential. However, he doesn’t fit into the T20 scheme of things right now. Presently, the idea is to persist with ‘keeper-bat Sanju Samson and Abhishek Sharma as openers, with Tilak Varma coming in at No. 3 and skipper Suryakumar at No.4. If you see, Abhishek and Varma are rated as the No. 1 & No. 2 batters in T20Is in the ICC rankings currently. How can you keep them out?"" a source close to the developments told TOI.Gill had a successful IPL 2025 too, where he slammed 650 runs in 15 matches @50.00, at a strike rate of 155.87, with six fifties, while captaining the Gujarat Titans. Along with young left-hander Sai Sudharsan, the 25-year-old forged an extremely prolific opening combination for GT.However, Samson, Sharma, and Varma have done enough in T20Is last year to have the team management's confidence in them, at least for now. Samson smashed three hundreds in T20Is last year -- two against South Africa in an away series (107 & 109*) and one (111) against Bangladesh at Hyderabad in the home series. Tilak cracked back-to-back centuries (107 not out & 120 not out) against South Africa in November 2024. The 22-year-old had an average IPL this time for the Mumbai Indians, managing 343 runs in 16 matches @31.18 with two fifties, but that is unlikely to be held against him.""Even Hardik Pandya had a bad IPL last year (while captaining MI), but he turned out to be one of India’s biggest heroes of their 2024 T20 World Cup triumph in the West Indies. Even greats like Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma have endured bad IPLs, but they were a different beast while playing for India in T20Is. You can’t judge a player just by one IPL,"" a source pointed out.Abhishek, of course, is a certainty after bludgeoning a scintillating 135 off just 54 balls, including 13 sixes and seven fours, against England at the Wankhede Stadium on February 2 this year. Incidentally, it was the last T20I India played before the Asia Cup.""The current top four in India’s T20 cricket reflect their new-found resolve to play fearlessly in this format. In fact, if you are talking about taking a third opener in the Asia Cup squad, the case of Yashasvi Jaiswal is stronger than Gill's. Jaiswal has the tendency to hit a lot more boundaries in the Powerplay overs, which is mandatory in today’s T20 cricket. If you remember, Jaiswal was in India’s main squad in the T20 World Cup last year, while Gill was in the reserves,"" the source said.However, it’s learnt that Jaiswal, who scored two hundreds in the Test series in England (101 at Leeds & 118 at The Oval), has been asked to focus on red-ball cricket for now, considering India are scheduled to play four home Tests in the 2025-26 season—two each against West Indies and South Africa.Like Gill, Shreyas Iyer is also struggling to make the cut, despite captaining Punjab Kings to the final of IPL 2025 and being in blazing form with the bat. The 30-year-old was India’s top run-getter in their Champions Trophy triumph in Dubai in March, scoring 243 runs in five matches @48.60, including two fifties. He scored 79 off 98 against New Zealand in the group stage, then 45 off 62 against Australia in the semifinal, and 48 off 62 in the final. However, he is competing with big-hitting left-handers, allrounder Shivam Dube and ‘finisher’ Rinku Singh.In encouraging news for Team India, world No. 1 pacer Jasprit Bumrah, who played three Tests in England and was under the scanner for workload management, has conveyed his availability to the selectors for the Asia Cup, and will thus lead India’s attack.""Bumrah had a minor knee injury, but will be fit for the Asia Cup. He is supposed to report to the BCCI’s CoE on August 30 for a fitness assessment,"" a source told TOI.With the final of the Asia Cup set for September 28 in Dubai and the first Test against West Indies starting on October 2 in Ahmedabad, there’s a fair chance that Bumrah will miss at least the first Test of that series. Meanwhile, pacer Mohammed Siraj, who took nine for 190 in the fifth Test at The Oval and finished with 23 wickets in the England series, is likely to be rested from the Asia Cup. He will, however, be available for the home Tests.Apart from Bumrah, left-arm seamer Arshdeep Singh, Prasidh Krishna -- who won the Purple Cap in IPL 2025 with 25 wickets in 15 matches @19.52 for Gujarat Titans -- and Hardik Pandya will be the other seamers. Prasidh, though, could be competing for a spot with Delhi pacer Harshit Rana.Among spinners, Varun Chakravarthy and Kuldeep Yadav are certainties on the slow UAE wickets, while off-spinning allrounder Washington Sundar is almost guaranteed a spot.The Asia Cup will begin with Afghanistan vs Hong Kong in Abu Dhabi on September 9. Clubbed in Group A with arch-rivals Pakistan, UAE and Oman, India will launch their campaign against UAE on September 10 in Dubai. They take on Pakistan on September 14 in the league stage, and most likely again in the Super Four stage on September 21. The final is scheduled for September 28.Jitesh Sharma, a star performer for IPL 2025 champions RCB (261 runs in 15 matches @37.28, SR 176.35, including a top score of 85*), is expected to be picked as the second wicketkeeper in the squad.",The focus is likely to be on maintaining continuity and keeping faith in the young and successful T20 specialists when the Indian selectors meet on Tuesday. Star batter and India's Test captain Shubman Gill was tipped in some quarters to take over the vice-captaincy role in the T20 format. The meeting will be attended by India's T20 captain Suryakumar Yadav who will fly in from Bengaluru after clearing his fitness test.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123359631,imgsize-104400,width-400,resizemode-4/123359631.jpg"

An old video of Sara Tendulkar has resurfaced online, offering a glimpse of her close friendship with Saaniya Chandhok, who recently got engaged to Sara’s brother, Arjun Tendulkar.The clip, originally shared by Sara in a collaborative post on August 2023, shows the two along with a friend enjoying a day out at Kew Little Pigs Farm in the United Kingdom.

Captioned “Three little piggies went on an adventure,” the vlog gave yet another sneak peek into the close relationship between Sara and Arjun Tendulkar's fiancée Saaniya.The video has now gained attention following the news of Saaniya’s engagement to Arjun Tendulkar earlier this week. The 25-year-old cricketer, son of batting legend Sachin Tendulkar , formalised his relationship with Saaniya in a private ceremony on August 13, attended by close friends and family.The resurfaced clip underlines how long Saaniya has been part of the Tendulkar family circle, even before her engagement. Sara’s post from last year reflects the bond the two shared, which has now taken on greater significance.Saaniya, 26, is the granddaughter of businessman Ravi Ghai and belongs to a family with strong ties to India’s food and hospitality sector. The Ghai family’s Graviss Group manages Baskin Robbins’ India operations and owns The Brooklyn Creamery. Graviss Food Solutions Private Limited reported revenues of ₹624 crore for FY23-24.","Sara Tendulkar shared a video of her and Saaniya Chandhok at Kew Little Pigs Farm.

Poll How important is workload management for professional athletes? Very important Somewhat important Not important Unsure

Mumbai: At a time when there’s a raging debate amongst former cricketers and journalists around India’s ace pacer Jasprit Bumrah ’s workload, following his appearance in just three out of five Tests in the recently held series in England to manage his workload, former Team India physio John Gloster has offered an interesting perspective.Replying to a question on whether Bumrah should be given leeway in choosing which games he would play in a series/tournament, Glosters said, “Look, I know that's a very controversial topic at the moment, and I'll happily tackle most controversial topics. I think that the athlete at the end of the day knows themselves better than anybody.”Speaking at a book launch at the Cricket Club of India on Monday, Gloster said, “Most athletes these days who have good sports teams around them are taking advice from those people. But intuitively, most athletes know what's right and what's wrong. And he is a mature athlete. He’s a smart individual who knows exactly what he’s doing.”The 31-year-old Bumrah took 14 wickets in three Tests at 26.00 in the Tendulkar-Anderson Trophy, and was under fire for missing the crucial third and fifth Tests of the series due to workload management. Overall, Bumrah has taken 219 wickets in 48 Tests at 19.82, with 15 five-wicket hauls, and is set to feature in the Asia Cup , which Gloster felt “should not be a problem, since the tournament will be played in a T20 format and Bumrah has to bowl only four overs in a match.”Making a pertinent point about the need to manage Bumrah’s workload to ensure that he lasts for more years rather than just focusing on how he could play more and more matches in a series, which could put him at risk of burnout or injury, Gloster said, “And I think nine times out of ten, mature athletes who have good support are going to make the right decisions. And what we need to think about is not Bumrah for the next series or the series after that. We've got to think about Bumrah for the next two to three years.”“In Jasprit's case, he had significant success when he came back. With the type of injury that he had, or has, he always knew that there were going to be times when it would need to be managed differently in order for him to continue to have success and stay playing at the highest level. And it is through good counsel that he comes to terms with that.”Gloster pointed out that it was crucial in Bumrah’s case that he received the right guidance in terms of his workload and injury management, which meant that a lot of times, there could be “others taking decisions for him,” in order for him to have a long and successful career in international cricket.“He knows that his career and the length of his career, his sporting longevity, is going to be through sound counsel and sound advice. This is what it's going to be like. And he knows that there are going to be situations where others are going to have to make decisions for him in order for him to have the best and longest career that he's going to have,” Gloster said.","Former Team India physio John Gloster says Jasprit Bumrah should be given leeway in choosing which games he would play in a series/tournament.

The Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ) will unveil its 15-member squad for the ACC Men’s Asia Cup 2025 on Tuesday, following a high-profile selection meeting in Mumbai.The Senior Men’s Selection Committee will gather at the BCCI headquarters, with the squad announcement scheduled for 1:30 PM (IST) on the 4th floor of the BCCI HQ.The press conference will be attended by India’s T20 captain and the chairman of selectors.The Asia Cup, to be played in the T20 format in the UAE from September 9 to 28, comes just a year after India lifted the 2024 T20 World Cup.Naturally, the spotlight is on continuity and trust in the young T20 specialists who powered India’s success. Suryakumar Yadav is expected to continue as captain, having cleared his fitness test at the BCCI’s Centre of Excellence.As reported by TOI, star opener Shubman Gill , despite stellar Test and IPL performances, may find it difficult to break into the T20 side.With Sanju Samson, Abhishek Sharma, and Tilak Varma delivering consistently in the shortest format, the management is keen to back them.

The 2025 T20 Asia Cup will be unlike any other, with the top two run-scorers for both India and Pakistan set to miss the tournament. For India, Rohit Sharma (4,231 runs) and Virat Kohli (4,188 runs) have already retired from T20 internationals, while Pakistan’s selectors made the bold call to omit Babar Azam (4,223 runs) and Mohammad Rizwan (3,414 runs) from their 17-member squad announced on Sunday.Pakistan, led by Salman Ali Agha, will play a preparatory tri-series against Afghanistan and UAE in Sharjah from August 29 to September 7 before the Asia Cup begins in the Emirates on September 9.The team management’s decision to leave out two of Pakistan’s most successful modern-day batters has sparked major debate, given that Babar and Rizwan were central to Pakistan’s famous 10-wicket win over India in the 2021 T20 World Cup.Their last T20I appearances came in December 2024.Chief selector Aaqib Javed backed the new-look squad, stressing confidence in their ability to challenge India. “This team has the ability to beat India in the Asia Cup. Every player understands the magnitude of an India-Pakistan clash, but we don’t need to add extra pressure,” he said.Head coach Mike Hesson explained the decision regarding Babar, pointing out areas for improvement.“Babar has been asked to work on his strike rate and handling spin. He’s too good a player not to consider in the future, and playing in leagues like the BBL could help him showcase those improvements,” Hesson noted.Despite recent series defeats to Bangladesh and West Indies, Pakistan remain optimistic. Hesson highlighted Sahibzada Farhan’s emergence, noting his three Player-of-the-Match awards in just six games as a sign of promise.Pakistan will face India, UAE, and Oman in Group A of the eight-team Asia Cup, which concludes on September 28.

Former BCCI chairman of selectors Chetan Sharma has supported Jasprit Bumrah 's decision to play only three Tests in the five-match Anderson-Tendulkar series against England. The decision was made to manage Bumrah's workload, despite facing criticism.Bumrah, who has been prone to injuries, participated in the first, third, and fourth Tests while Mohammed Siraj led the pace attack in the remaining matches.Sharma, a former pace bowler himself, compared the situation to following a doctor's advice.""If the medical team advises, if the doctor tells me that I have to take antibiotics, then I have to consume them,"" Sharma said in ""The Great Indian Cricket Show"" on Doordarshan.""If our physios are telling a player to manage workload, I think we should listen to them because they are the better judges.""The comments were made at an event where Prasar Bharati, the country's public service broadcaster, signed a deal with London-based cricket analytics company.Sharma, who had a successful bowling partnership with Kapil Dev and claimed over 125 wickets in Tests and ODIs, expressed confidence in India's chances at the upcoming Asia Cup in the UAE.""I know that whoever is selected will be the best for the country. And the kind of cricket we are playing right now, I'm really proud with the way India played in England,"" he added.""And I'm very confident that we are definitely going to win the Asia Cup (to be played in T20 format) because soon after that we are playing the T20 World Cup (in 2026) in India.""It's a very big thing when you are playing (the World Cup) in you own backyard.

My opinion does not matter because I am no longer the chairman (of selectors), so I will only say that the best possible team should be selected,"" he stated.""We have such good cricketers that not just the top-15 but even if the top-30 are selected, they are all very good.

Poll Should Vaibhav Suryavanshi be included in India's squad for the Asia Cup T20? Yes, absolutely! No, he should wait.

Former India captain Kris Srikkanth has advocated for 14-year-old Vaibhav Suryavanshi's inclusion in India's 15-member squad for the upcoming Asia Cup T20, starting September 9. Srikkanth's endorsement comes as selectors prepare to finalize the squad on August 19, amid intense competition for spots, particularly in the opening positions. Vaibhav Suryavanshi has emerged as a strong contender following his performance in IPL 2025, where he scored 252 runs in seven matches for Rajasthan Royals at a strike rate exceeding 200. He also claimed the second-fastest century in IPL history, reaching the milestone in 35 deliveries against Gujarat Titans.The young prodigy continued his impressive form during the U19 tour of England, scoring a century and delivering strong performances in both one-day and four-day formats.""You have to play bold. Don't make him wait. Don't say things like 'let him mature'. He is already playing with remarkable maturity. His shot-making has been on another level. If I were chairman, I would definitely have him in the squad,"" Srikkanth stated on his YouTube show.The selection discussion involves several established players, including Abhishek Sharma and Sanju Samson , who have secured their positions with an aggressive approach under coach Gautam Gambhir Yashasvi Jaiswal , Shubman Gill and current IPL Orange Cap holder Sai Sudharsan are also in contention.Srikkanth expressed uncertainty about Sanju Samson's inclusion in the squad and outlined his preferred opening combinations.""Samson is doubtful, according to me,"" Srikkanth said. ""My first-choice opener is Abhishek Sharma, no doubt. I will have two more openers. My picks would be Vaibhav Suryavanshi or Sai Sudharsan, with Shubman Gill as an option. If I were a selector, I would keep Vaibhav in the 15 for the T20 World Cup. He has been outstanding.""""I think it should be Yashasvi Jaiswal, Vaibhav Suryavanshi, and Sai Sudharsan. I would take two out of these three. That would be my preference,"" he added.Since the T20 World Cup final in June 2024, Abhishek Sharma and Sanju Samson have been India's leading run-scorers in T20 internationals. Both players have received support from the team management, including head coach Gambhir and captain Suryakumar Yadav , for their aggressive batting style.Abhishek has accumulated 535 runs at an average of 33.43 with a strike rate of 193.84, including two centuries during this period. Samson has scored three hundreds in 17 matches at a strike rate of 171.47.However, Samson's recent performance in the five-match series against England has raised concerns. He struggled against short-pitched bowling and recorded three single-digit scores in five innings.Srikkanth, who previously captained a 16-year-old Sachin Tendulkar during his debut in Pakistan in 1989, believes India should not delay incorporating Vaibhav into the national setup as they prepare for next year's T20 World Cup.","Former India captain Kris Srikkanth has advocated for 14-year-old Vaibhav Suryavanshi's inclusion in India's 15-member squad for the upcoming Asia Cup T20.

The Supreme Court has scheduled a hearing for August 22 regarding a dispute between the All India Football Federation and Football Sports Development Limited concerning 11 Indian Super League clubs' contracts.The conflict emerged due to non-renewal of agreements between the national federation and tournament organizers.

EUPEN, Belgium - Lawyers for former France international Lassana Diarra said Monday he is claiming 65 million euros ($76 million) from FIFA and the Belgian soccer federation after a landmark legal win about transfer rules.Diarra's decade-long challenge to FIFA after a breakdown in relations with his former club Lokomotiv Moscow led to a ruling at the European Union's top court last October that some aspects of soccer's transfer rules do not comply with the 27-nation bloc's labor and competition laws.Lawyers for the 40-year-old former Chelsea, Arsenal and Real Madrid midfielder cited ""unsuccessful settlement negotiations with FIFA"" for the financial claim for damages throughout his career.""Lassana Diarra is claiming 65 million gross (35 million net) in compensation from FIFA and the Belgian Football Association,"" his legal firm Dupont Hissel said in a statement.FIFA was approached for comment about the latest high-stakes legal challenge to its authority.Diarra's case, which is back in court in Belgium, is supported by the global players' union FIFPRO, its European division and their national member union in France.The legal case started in the home country of Charleroi, the Belgian club that wanted to sign Diarra after his contract in Moscow was terminated.FIFA transfer rules at the time made the player and the potential signing club liable for paying the former club when a contract was ruled to have been broken without ""just cause."" The Court of Arbitration for Sport upheld FIFA's ruling in favor of Lokomotiv.The case was sent to the European court which said the FIFA rules ""hinder the free movement of players and competition between clubs.""Diarra's dispute with Lokomotiv and FIFA forced him to miss the 2014-15 season. He then signed for Marseille and ended his career at Paris Saint-Germain six years ago.""I am doing this for myself,"" Diarra said in a statement Monday published by his lawyers. ""And if I have been able to hold out against the FIFA steamroller, it is because I had a good career.""""But I have also done it for all the up and coming, lesser known players who do not have the financial and psychological means to challenge FIFA before real judges,"" he said.Diarra's lawyers also are working on a class action suit filed this month against FIFA and some national soccer federations in Europe which claims could benefit 100,000 players over more than two decades.","Former France international Lassana Diarra is claiming 65 million euros ($76 million) from FIFA and the Belgian soccer federation.

Poll Which team had the most impressive performance in the opening weekend of the Premier League? Arsenal Nottingham Forest Chelsea Manchester United

The Premier League ’s opening weekend offered plenty of drama on Sunday, with Arsenal edging Manchester United at Old Trafford, Chelsea frustrated by Crystal Palace and Nottingham Forest cruising past Brentford.At Old Trafford, Manchester United’s first full season under Ruben Amorim began with a narrow 1-0 defeat to Arsenal. Riccardo Calafiori capitalised on a mistake by stand-in goalkeeper Altay Bayindir to head home from a Declan Rice corner after just 13 minutes.United responded strongly, creating 22 attempts and dominating possession, but a £200 million front line of Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and substitute Benjamin Sesko failed to beat goalkeeper David Raya. Patrick Dorgu hit the post, while Cunha and Mbeumo were denied by Raya’s reflexes.However, a controversial call regarding an apparent foul on Matheus Cunha sunk the game into controversy. Fans on social media were livid as they claimed that William Saliba's attempt for the ball was completely missed and he ended up tripping up United's new signing Matheus Cunha. Despite several appeals from the Red Devils, no penalty wasDespite the defeat, Amorim was upbeat.“We need to win games but that was completely different to last season. We were the better team. In the end we lose the game, but really proud of the performance. We proved today we can win any game in the Premier League, against a great team like Arsenal,” the Portuguese coach said.In the other two games that took place on Sunday, Chelsea were held to a 0-0 draw against Crystal Palace. A stadium VAR announcement was made in a Premier League game for the first time ever as Palace saw a goal from Eberechi Eze denied. The game ended in a 0-0 draw, making it just the 2nd game in the league to have ended in a stalemate on matchday 1.Nottingham Forest on the other hand, got off to a roaring start against Brentford, thanks to a brace from Chris Wood and a dream Premier League debut for Dan Ndoye, which saw him score a diving header in the 42nd minute to help his side win 3-1.As the games on matchday 1 come to an end, Manchester City sit atop the table thanks to their 4-0 win over Wolves on Saturday.",Manchester United lost 1-0 to Arsenal at Old Trafford on Sunday.

Poll Do you think the new in-stadium communication system for VAR announcements improves the match experience for fans? Yes, definitely No, it complicates things

For the first time ever in the Premier League , fans inside Stamford Bridge on Sunday heard referee Darren England announce the outcome of a VAR review directly to the crowd. The new in-stadium communication system, introduced this season, was used during Chelsea’s goalless draw with Crystal Palace.The incident came midway through the first half when Eberechi Eze appeared to have given Palace the lead. The midfielder struck a powerful free-kick from the edge of the box, beating Chelsea goalkeeper Robert Sanchez and sparking celebrations among the visitors.However, those celebrations were short-lived. VAR advised referee England to review the goal on the pitch-side monitor. Initially, it seemed the strike had been disallowed because Palace defender Marc Guehi was judged to have pushed Chelsea’s Moises Caicedo in the wall.But following the review, the official addressed the stadium with the official explanation. His announcement went: ""After review, away number six is less than one metre away from the wall as the shot is taken. Therefore, it's an indirect free kick and a disallowed goal.""The message also appeared on the big screen, confirming that Guehi’s positioning was the infringement that led to the goal being ruled out.The Premier League Match Centre later provided further clarification, emphasising that the decision was based solely on Guehi’s distance from the wall when the free-kick was struck.Despite the controversy, neither side managed to break the deadlock, and the game finished 0-0. It was only the second goalless draw of the season, following Aston Villa’s stalemate with Newcastle United.For many inside Stamford Bridge, the bigger talking point was the historic first use of a referee’s VAR announcement in the Premier League, marking a change in how decisions are communicated to players and supporters.","Chelsea drew 0-0 with Crystal Palace at Stamford Bridge on Sunday.

Poll Do you think Manchester United can bounce back this season after their opening loss? Yes, they will improve No, it will be another tough season

Arsenal kicked off their Premier League campaign with a statement win, grinding out a 1-0 victory over Manchester United at Old Trafford on Sunday. In a clash billed as the marquee fixture of the opening round, Riccardo Calafiori’s early goal proved decisive as Mikel Arteta’s men displayed resilience at the back and efficiency from set pieces — a hallmark of their rise in recent seasons.The breakthrough came in the 13th minute when Declan Rice’s corner caused chaos inside United’s box. Back-up goalkeeper Altay Bayindir, preferred over first-choice Andre Onana, failed to collect cleanly, allowing Calafiori to nod home from close range. It was yet another reminder of Arsenal’s lethal edge from dead-ball situations, with Arteta’s side making a habit of punishing defensive lapses.For United, the script felt painfully familiar. After a miserable 15th-place finish last season, optimism had returned under Ruben Amorim, bolstered by nearly £200 million spent revamping their attack. Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha were given starting debuts, while highly rated Benjamin Sesko came off the bench in the second half. Despite flashes of energy, United lacked the cutting edge to breach Arsenal’s disciplined rearguard.Arsenal themselves had a quiet evening in open play. New striker Viktor Gyökeres struggled on his competitive debut, but with their backline marshaled superbly, the Gunners followed likely title rivals Liverpool and Manchester City in securing three points on opening weekend.Elsewhere, Chelsea endured frustration in their first match as reigning Club World Cup champions, held to a goalless draw at home by Crystal Palace.

India's newly-appointed head coach Khalid Jamil has explained the absence of striker Sunil Chhetri from the CAFA Nations Cup national camp. The tournament serves as preparation for the upcoming Asian Cup qualifying matches in October.Jamil, who took over from Manolo Marquez this month, announced a list of 35 probables for the CAFA Nations Cup in Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. Notably, Chhetri was not included in the selection.""He (Chhetri) is not there in this camp because we are playing a tournament which will essentially serve as a preparation for our Asian Cup Qualifiers. I also want to try out a few other players during this FIFA window. I had a talk with him about the same. It's always a pleasure to have a player like him in the team, and the door is always open for him. Sunil is a legend of Indian football. I have played against him, I've seen him play on numerous occasions, and he is one of my favourite players. He is a role model for Indian football,"" Jamil said.India will compete in Group B of the CAFA Nations Cup, facing Tajikistan on August 29, Iran on September 1, and Afghanistan on September 4.The tournament's third-place match and final are scheduled for September 8 in Hisor and Tashkent respectively.The national camp began on Saturday with 22 players. The remaining 13 players, currently involved in the Durand Cup, are expected to join soon. The AIFF has requested clubs to release their national team players for the tournament.Chhetri, aged 41, had initially retired from international football after playing against Kuwait in June last year. He later returned for national duty against Maldives in March following Marquez's request to assist in the Asian Cup qualifiers.Since his return, Chhetri has participated in four matches, scoring once in India's 3-0 victory over Maldives. India's recent performances include a goalless draw with Bangladesh and a 0-1 loss to Hong Kong in Asian Cup qualifiers, complicating their path to the 2027 continental tournament.The team also suffered a 0-2 defeat against Thailand in an international friendly, leading to Marquez's departure.""This will be India's first-ever participation in the CAFA Nations Cup, and it will be a good opportunity for us to play against stronger and quality opponents like Tajikistan and Iran in CAFA Nations Cup. This will definitely be beneficial for us to prepare for AFC Asian Cup qualifiers. There is absolutely no excuse for us, as we have enough time to prepare for it. We may be treating these as preparatory games, but this is serious business for us,"" he added.""We must do the simple things first and go step by step. We are treating these matches as friendly games, but I want to take players who are fit. When I say fit, I mean, the players who will play must be 100 per cent fit.""""We started the camp with some players still not available, but we've got the players we need to begin our preparations. We had a good first training session yesterday (Saturday), but there's a lot to improve on. The important thing is that we remain united as a team. For the national interest, we would like to request co-operation from clubs to release players on time, to ensure their adequate participation during the preparatory camp. ""Jamil, who previously coached Jamshedpur FC and NorthEast United, acknowledged the need for adjustment time with the team. He emphasised that player selection would be based on performance.""The players also need time to adjust to me. My doors are always open to everybody. Whoever is doing well will be selected,"" he explainedRegarding his appointment as India's head coach, Jamil expressed his gratitude: ""It is my pleasure to serve the country. It has always been my dream to do this, and it has now come true, so that feels very good. There is a big task ahead of us, and we've got many areas that we need to work on. I am fully aware how big a responsibility it is for me, but I feel thankful that the Federation (AIFF) felt me worthy to be entrusted with it.

Poll Which aspect of Fabio's career do you find most impressive? Longevity in the sport Achievements with various clubs His leadership on and off the field

Brazilian goalkeeper Fabio etched his name into football history by equalling former England great Peter Shilton’s long-standing record for the most competitive appearances in men’s football. The 44-year-old started Fluminense’s 2-1 victory over Fortaleza in Brazil’s Serie A, marking the 1,390th match of his professional career.Shilton, widely regarded as one of the greatest goalkeepers of all time, had set the benchmark more than two decades ago. While the England legend himself counts 1,387 appearances, Guinness World Records officially recognises the total as 1,390. Fabio’s latest outing has now brought him level at the summit.“I have to thank everyone who is part of my life, my father, my mother, my sisters, my friends, my wife… I try to be a good human being. The important thing is to help my team-mates. I am grateful, but without God nothing would be possible,” Fabio said after the milestone match.The veteran will stand alone as the outright record holder if he features in Fluminense’s Copa Sudamericana clash against Colombia’s America de Cali on Tuesday.Fabio’s career began in 1997 — the same year Shilton retired — before establishing himself as one of Brazilian football’s most enduring figures. He made 976 appearances for Cruzeiro between 2005 and 2022, alongside spells at Uniao Bandeirante (30 matches) and Vasco da Gama (150). Saturday’s match was his 234th for Fluminense, with whom he lifted the Copa Libertadores in 2023.","Fabio started Fluminense’s 2-1 victory over Fortaleza on Saturday.

Brighton and Hove Albion have confirmed that a supporter passed away during their Premier League opener against Fulham on Saturday.The 72-year-old man became unwell in the second half of the match while seated in the east stand upper. Despite immediate attention from emergency staff and prolonged efforts that included CPR and defibrillation, the supporter could not be revived.Privacy screens were quickly put up as medical teams worked on the scene. Paramedics from South East Coast Ambulance Service, St John Ambulance, Sussex Police, the club’s crowd doctor and stewards were all involved in the response.In a statement on the club’s official website, chief executive and deputy chairman Paul Barber said, “This was an incredibly sad end to the match this afternoon, and our deepest sympathies and condolences go out to the family and friends of the gentleman who lost his life. While the gentleman concerned is foremost in our minds, we are also aware that it was an emotional and distressing situation for staff and supporters in the direct vicinity. Over the coming days we will ensure those affected are properly supported.”Club doctor and emergency medicine consultant Dr Rob Galloway also addressed the tragedy.He said, “Firstly, I would like to convey my condolences and sympathies to the gentleman’s family and friends.It was a tragic outcome, but from an emergency response perspective, the medical care was exemplary, and the professionalism of club stewards and Sussex Police provided the medical team with the best possible working environment.”Officials explained why play was not halted during the incident. Brighton’s safety team, in consultation with Sussex Police and the Premier League, decided that stopping the match might have drawn unnecessary attention to the scene and disrupted resuscitation attempts.They also noted that any delay could have complicated matters if the supporter had responded and needed immediate transport to hospital.The match ended in a 1-1 draw, but the result was overshadowed by the events in the stands.For Brighton, the day will be remembered less for the football and more for the loss of one of their own, with tributes and condolences now flowing toward the supporter’s family and friends.","Brighton and Hove Albion confirm that a supporter has died.

How the three World Champions fared in Formula E Season 11

Days after Oliver Rowland lifted his Formula E World Championship trophy in London this season, an interesting trend has come to the attention of Formula E and its fans. As a coincidence, all Formula E drivers who won the Mexico City E-Prix went on to win the Formula E World Championship that season, and this has been proved right for three consecutive years.Highlighting the same since 2023, a poster of three World Champions was shared on X by Formula E with the caption, “The trend continues. Each winner of the #MexicoCityEPrix from the past three seasons has gone on to become World Champion.”The special poster features 2023 Formula E World Champion Jake Dennis from Andretti, then TAG Heuer Porsche’s Pascal Wehrlein, who won in 2024, and the new World Champion, Nissan driver Oliver Rowland. All three of them won in the Mexico E-Prix and went on to lift the winner’s trophy in the Formula E World Championship that year.Oliver Rowland had strengthened his chances of winning the Formula E World Championship this year much earlier. He was leading the Formula E Driver Standings ever since he won Part 2 of the Jeddah E-Prix, which was his second win of the season after winning the Mexico E-Prix. In the last leg, the Nissan driver got nervous for a while as Pascal Wehrlein, who was following him in the number two position, closed the gap after grabbing quite a few podiums while Rowland had a dull period.Things became serious for Rowland when he failed to finish the Round 13 race in Berlin, while Wehrlein won second spot on the podium. But he eventually managed to confirm his championship in Berlin after four wins and three more podiums.Sharing about his bad race in Berlin, Rowland had said, “I was hoping before the weekend that the outcome could be [the World Championship], but after yesterday (Saturday) and this morning (Sunday), I was more worried that it might never come.”Also Read: Oliver Rowland reacts to daughter’s sweet radio message after Formula E Championship win: “It’s amazing” Things, however, changed for Wehrlein, who was pushed to third position after Nick Cassidy made a late entry in the Formula E Driver Standings by registering three consecutive wins.

Taylor Barnard on losing top three spot in Formula E World Championship

Fans hail Taylor Barnard for his fantastic rookie season

It was Taylor Barnard’s rookie season this year, and the NEOM McLaren driver put up a fantastic performance by temporarily making it to the top three in the Formula E Driver Standings by ousting the much more experienced Porsche driver Antonio Felix Da Costa. He was, however, ousted from the top three at the London E-Prix as Jaguar’s Nick Cassidy went on to register three consecutive wins. Barnard took to Instagram to share his feelings on losing out on the top three in his first-ever season and his claim to the championship.Taking to Instagram after the London E-Prix, Barnard wrote, “London wasn’t what we hoped for, easily being the toughest weekend of our season. Taking 0 points away as a team from a doubleheader hurts, but one weekend doesn’t define the year we’ve had.”He further wrote, “As the season closes, I want to say a massive thank you to the entire team, both trackside and behind the scenes, for everything this season. Finishing P4 in the Drivers’ Championship and coming into the final weekend with a shot at runner-up is something to be proud of.”Also adding a note for teammate Sam Bird, as NEOM McLaren withdrew from Formula E after the end of the season, Barnard wrote, “@sambird_official it wasn’t the weekend you deserved either.You’ve been a huge part of my season both on and off the track, and I’m grateful for everything. You deserved more. To all the Papaya fans, thank you for the incredible support in our final race together. You always go above and beyond. ”Reacting to his post, a fan wrote, “An incredible debut season, huge congrats and excited to see where you go next!” Another said, “I know I said it the other day, but you’ve been incredible to watch this last year and a pleasure to support you in Papaya — there are many of us that can’t wait to support you in whatever you do next!” One more commented, “You were incredible all season around, Taylor.

McLaren team principal Ian James pens open letter to fans

What’s next in Formula E?

Team Principal Ian James of the departing Formula E team NEOM McLaren has penned an open letter to the fans of the team, marking their departure from the electric motorsport format. Addressing the Papaya Army, James thanked them for their trust and support as the team went on to win two Drivers’ World Championships and two Teams’ World Championships over 103 races in seven seasons.Ian James began the letter saying that he wrote it with “a huge amount of pride, as well as with more than a hint of sadness,” as the team closed the final chapter after seven years of competing in the ABB FIA Formula E World Championship.Thanking the fans for their love on social media and at the track, he said, “The team was always blown away by the amount of papaya we saw at circuits across the world, race-in, race-out, right from our very first round as the NEOM McLaren Formula E team.

How do Formula E and ABB work together?

What do ABB and Formula E say about the partnership?

After a successful Season 11, ABB and Formula E have announced that they will continue their partnership in the upcoming season. This gives ABB another opportunity to promote its new brand positioning via the ABB FIA Formula E World Championship, along with technologies that help industries take a cleaner route.Over a period of eight seasons, the partnership with Formula E has provided ABB a platform to showcase how technology can help industries outrun challenges, engage with customers around the world, and implement its own solutions into the series to improve reliability and efficiency. The partnership extension will provide a year-round opportunity for brand-building and activation, communicating ABB and its technology solutions to new global audiences, including Formula E’s international fanbase.ABB and Formula E will also join hands to engage a new generation of fans, collaborating with unexpected influencers and content creators to tell compelling stories that make advanced electrification and automation technologies tangible and exciting.The end of the mid-race car swap, a 150kW increase in power, top speeds that are 43 percent higher, and energy recovery increasing from 15 to 50 percent indicate how far Formula E technology has come to outperform on track.ABB has also built on its technical involvement in the series, supplying the race chargers from Season 9, and introducing its ABB Ability OPTIMAX® energy management software (Season 9) and Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) technology (Season 5) to the sport.ABB Head of Brand Paco Liebrand said, “We are pleased to be continuing our partnership with Formula E which, like ABB, is striving for a leaner and cleaner future. The synergy between the two organizations, combined with the global appeal of the Championship, makes it a great platform to promote our brand positioning.”He further said, “Formula E is increasingly working with content creators, influencers, and celebrities, with initiatives such as the Evo Sessions making an impact through digital channels beyond the racing itself, which is also an essential part of ABB’s new brand strategy. Going forward, we will be enhancing the way we harness the benefits of this collaboration, ensuring the focus is on delivering content and activations that reinforce our new messaging, build familiarity, and tell the ‘Engineered to Outrun’ story. ”Formula E Chief Revenue Officer Tiziana Di Gioia said, “Our renewed partnership with ABB is a testament to the commercial power and benefit of Formula E as a global platform that drives both brand and business growth. ABB, like our wider partnership portfolio, has and continues to see enormous value in collaborating with the fastest-growing motorsport on the planet, with viewership, commercial integration, and brand storytelling continuing to accelerate. Over eight seasons, ABB has moved from brand visibility to brand activation—integrating deeply into the fan experience, the sport’s ecosystem, and our innovation narrative.Also Read: Antonio Felix Da Costa shares happy memories as Porsche wins Formula E Teams and Manufacturers’ World Championships “This next chapter elevates the partnership even further. With ABB’s new positioning, we are co-creating opportunities across content, digital storytelling, and market engagement, transforming a title partnership into a year-round, value-generating relationship. It’s a model of how modern sponsorships should evolve, rooted in purpose and cultural alignment but measured by impact,” she added.Formula E Season 12 will begin with testing in Valencia in October.","ABB and Formula E have announced that they will continue their partnership in the upcoming season.

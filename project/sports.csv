Shubman Gill-led Gujarat Titans (GT) will take on Rishabh Pant's Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) at Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad on Thursday.With 18 points from 12 matches, table-toppers Titans have already booked their place in the playoffs. However, with Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) and Punjab Kings (PBKS) close behind on 17 points, the race for a top-two spot is still very much alive.Everything's clicked for Gujarat this season. Their formidable top three – B Sai Sudharsan (617 runs), captain Shubman Gill (601), and Jos Buttler (500) – have been in stunning form, consistently providing the backbone for their victories. With 16 half-centuries and a century between them, they've clinically dismantled opposition bowling. The only caveat? Their middle order remains largely untested due to this top-heavy success.Gujarat's bowling is equally impressive. Spearheaded by their Indian pacers, Prasidh Krishna is the season's top wicket-taker with 21 scalps. He's been well-supported by Mohammed Siraj and the tall left-arm spinner R Sai Kishore, who have each bagged 15 wickets.The pitch at the Narendra Modi Stadium is generally known to favor batters.The ball comes onto the bat well, making it easy for batsmen to hit boundaries. The average first innings score at this venue is around 165-170, but it can be higher in recent seasons due to batting-friendly conditions. The toss-winning captain might prefer to bat first to put runs on the board, but dew can become a factor later in the evening, making chasing easier.It is going to be hot and humid day in Ahmedabad with a chance of scattered thunderstorms during the match. The conditions will be challenging for the players due to the heat and humidity.Shubman Gill (c), B Sai Sudharsan, Jos Buttler (wk), Sherfane Rutherford, Shahrukh Khan, Rahul Tewatia, Rashid Khan, Kagiso Rabada, Arshad Khan, Sai Kishore, Mohammed SirajPrasidh KrishnaMitchell Marsh, Aiden Markram, Rishabh Pant (c & wk), Nicholas Pooran, Ayush Badoni, Abdul Samad, Shardul Thakur, Ravi Bishnoi, Akash Deep, Avesh Khan, Digvesh RathiWill O’RourkeThe GT vs LSG match will be played at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad.

Poll What do you think was the key factor in UAE's victory over Bangladesh? Strong bowling performance Consistent batting by Sharafu

Want to bring Mumbai's 'Khadoos' cricket mindset to the UAE team: Lalchand Rajput

The United Arab Emirates created history on Wednesday at the Sharjah Cricket Stadium , sealing their first-ever T20I bilateral series triumph over Bangladesh with a convincing seven-wicket win in the final match of the three-game series. The victory gave UAE a 2-1 series result, marking a significant milestone in the country’s cricketing journey.Alishan Sharafu struck the winning boundary through covers to cap off a dominant chase of 163 and sparked euphoric celebrations among his teammates. The win not only gave UAE their maiden series victory over a Full Member nation in T20Is but also dealt Bangladesh a heavy blow less than a year before the ICC T20 World Cup.After the win, Player of the Match Sharafu said, “The plan was simple, to play as many balls as possible. We had to rotate the strike and get the odd boundaries. Everyone was optimistic once that third game was announced. We believed we could win the series.”The series began with a 27-run defeat for UAE, but the hosts staged a remarkable comeback, chasing down 206 in the second T20I to level the series.In the decider, UAE’s bowlers laid the foundation with a clinical display after electing to field. Young left-arm spinner Haider Ali was the star with the ball, rattling Bangladesh’s top order and finishing with figures of 3 for 7.Despite cameos from Tanzid Hasan (40 off 18), Jaker Ali (41 off 34), and Hasan Mahmud (26* off 15), Bangladesh were restricted to 162/9, thanks to disciplined bowling and sharp fielding.In response, UAE lost skipper Muhammad Waseem early, and Muhammad Zohaib contributed 29 before falling. But Sharafu (68* off 51) stood tall, anchoring the innings with elegance and composure. He found a reliable ally in Asif Khan (41*), as the duo stitched an unbeaten 87-run partnership that dismantled Bangladesh’s hopes.Asif’s twin sixes in the penultimate over brought UAE to the brink, and Sharafu fittingly finished the job to etch UAE’s name into the record books.UAE captain and Player of the Series Waseem was emotional after the historic win and said: “Very happy with this victory... This series means a lot. The uncapped players did really well—Haider Ali was exceptional. To be honest, we didn't lose our hopes. First time I am receiving this trophy; I want to dedicate this award to my son.”“Definitely our performance wasn't up to the mark... UAE bowlers played really well. Their batters didn’t panic much, so credit goes to them,” Bangladesh captain Litton Das admitted his team fell short.","The United Arab Emirates created history on Wednesday at the Sharjah Cricket Stadium.

'Shubman Gill used his brains a lot more than the other guys'

AHMEDABAD: On paper, the clash between Gujarat Titans and Lucknow Super Giants on Thursday appears to be an inconsequential one, with the hosts already through to the playoffs and the visitors out of the reckoning. But, the match holds significance as GT will aim for a top-two finish while LSG seek a dignified conclusion to their campaign.Table-toppers Titans are sitting pretty with 18 points from 12 matches but with Royal Challengers Bengaluru and Punjab Kings close behind on 17 points, the race for a top-two spot is still up for grabs.The Titans’ batting prowess has been evident through consistent performances from openers Shubman Gill , B Sai Sudharsan and Jos Buttler at No. 3. Although their middle order of Sherfane Rutherford, M Shahrukh Khan and Rahul Tewatia hasn’t faced extensive challenges, they’ve demonstrated reliability under pressure, as noted by assistant coach Mathew Wade.On the middle-order being untested, Wade said, “The positive thing is the middle order. Sherfane, Shahrukh and Tewatia have had good impact in the games when they’ve got the opportunity. They just haven’t got a lot of game time over the last few weeks.”Jos Buttler is set to leave GT for national duty after the conclusion of the league stage, and Wade said his absence will provide an opportunity for someone to take over his role. “We’re going to lose Jos after a few more games. So, there’s going to be another opportunity for someone to come in at No. 3.”.LSG’s performances have presented a different picture.

Harry Maguire's captaincy was a period of inconsistency and transition

Bruno Fernandes' captaincy is about leading by example amid challenges

Assessing the impact of both captains in the United jersey

While Manchester United struggles through the 2024–25 season, the captaincy and vice-captaincy of Harry Maguire and Bruno Fernandes have been a hot topic. Now, the two players have both led the team in some of its darkest times, but with respective contrasting fortunes. Influence, performance, and team success all differ.Harry Maguire was made club captain by then-manager Ole Gunnar Solskjær in January 2020. After only just signing, Maguire's initial spell was significant for the rock solid, sensible defending of Stone that was a key aspect of his praise from the club's great, Bryan Robson, who was also saying he should wear the armband for his calming influence on and off the pitch.Not that it has been smooth sailing for United under Maguire's captaincy. There was no major silverware with the team, Maguire's form slumped, and observers in the stands and the punditry began to see red over the England international's displays. However, under Erik ten Hag, he soon fell down the pecking order at Old Trafford and was then relieving Maguire from the Man United captaincy in July 2023, claiming the group needed a captain to fit the vibe of the group.Bruno Fernandes - who regularly wore the armband when Maguire was absent - was named club captain in July 2023. Ten Hag made the decision to have Fernandes as skipper due to him being a rare leader by example, a hard worker who leads on the pitch, and a player who connects with his teammates.Against his captaincy, Fernandes has been fantastic for them, as demonstrated by his contribution to them in the offensive third. His haul for the 2024–25 season amounts to 19 goals and 19 assists with including matches that helped take his team into the Europa League. His leadership has helped put United into the Europa League final against Tottenham Hotspur, in a match which will offer the chance to gain entry to the Champions League, and one more trophy will top it off for him if he wins the match at Bilbao.Fernandes had shone despite the club’s domestic struggles and had already established himself as a key figure within it. He’s also shown humility and a team-first attitude.Harry Maguire was a much-hailed captain, but his reign corresponded with a time of underperformance and personal struggle. In opposition, Bruno Fernandes has used his captaincy to inspire others by taking the team and its performance in his stride. His captaincy has been a guiding light over the difficult season and may yet shape up to be a more wholesome captaincy record than his predecessor's.Also Read: How much prize money Manchester United or Tottenham will earn by winning the Europa League As Manchester United looks to rebuild and strive for success, Fernandes' influence as captain could be pivotal in shaping the team's future trajectory.","Harry Maguire was made club captain by Ole Gunnar Solskjær in January 2020.

Casemiro’s decorated legacy is still being written

Brazilian Casemiro is one of the most decorated and influential players of his generation by a country mile. Casemiro has carved out a career that serves as a lesson in midfield Saiyan style: thunderous tackles, tactical nous, and an indefatigable work ethic. Since bursting onto the scene in Brazil with São Paulo FC, to years of silverware success at Real Madrid, and further into life as a senior member at Manchester United, Casemiro has been playing world-class football for over a decade. As he toasts his new piece of silverware won in England, we take a look at just how much silverware Casemiro has to his name.Casemiro first caught the eye in Brazil with São Paulo, and he made a big step up when he moved to Real Madrid in 2013. He worked with the reserves and got promoted to Zidane's senior side in no time. And with the Spanish giants, Casemiro accrued an astonishing 18 major trophies during a nine-year stint. These include:Casemiro transferred to Manchester United in 2022. As he made his debut there, many were forced to ask similar questions about his game: could Casemiro adapt to the physical demands of the Premier League? But he quickly proved the skeptics wrong. His charisma and composure, his footballing intelligence, and his leadership made the United midfield a stronger beast and flicked the pride back into the club.At Manchester United, Casemiro has already added two more trophies to his cabinet:Casemiro's impact on the Brazilian team and his club has been huge.A relentless midfielder, he was an integral part of the squad that won the Copa América in 2019. He also captured the 2011 U-20 World Cup and the 2011 South American U-20 Championship with Brazil and the 2009 South American U-17 Championship. On the other hand, let’s not forget his prior success with Sao Paulo, which he led to a Copa Sudamericana title in 2012.Overall, there are 22 major titles to a name that suggest a level of consistency, durability, and influence at the highest level, which can’t be underestimated. He’s more than a pure holding midfielder — a natural leader who excels under pressure. Both while ramping up play in the capital and while anchoring the midfield in the north-west, Casemiro has had a say in everything.Also Read: Europa League: Manchester United dominate Athletic Bilbao to take 3-0 semi-final first leg lead Casemiro’s thirst for glory is no less as he embarks on the next stage of his career with Manchester United.

But the weather forecast shows a 100 percent chance of rainfall on both Saturday and Sunday. This is enough to concern the Formula E drivers, as—despite the much-improved Gen3 Evo cars this year running on Hankook tyres—racing in rain comes with hard-to-overcome challenges and risks. However, the rain may skip the Round 9 race Sunday evening. Here’s the complete weather forecast for the Tokyo Formula E race.According to Metcheck.com, the weather in Tokyo is expected to remain pleasant at 21 degrees Celsius on Friday, though it will be a cloudy day. There are only slight chances of rain as the Formula E drivers take part in the First Free Practice session at 4 pm (local time) and 12:30 pm IST.The temperature will remain in the range of 18–20 degrees Celsius on Saturday. However, there is a 100 percent chance of rain throughout the day.

The rain is expected to be much lighter, at 0.9 mm, during the main Round 8 race at 3:05 pm (local time), which will be broadcast in India at 11:35 am.The temperature will be in the range of 19–20 degrees Celsius on Sunday, while the rain will continue to be as heavy as the day before. There is a 100 percent chance of around 3.8 mm of rain during the Third Free Practice at 8 am (local time) and the Round 9 Qualifying at 10:20 am. But the good news is that no rain is predicted for the main Round 9 race, which will start at 3:05 pm (local time) and 11:35 am IST.Mitch Evans told RacingNews365.com that it was “very, very tricky” to race in wet conditions with the Hankook tyres in the recent races. He said, “In qualifying it was like, I was terrible. Nothing, you can't wake them [the tyres] up. In the race I was way more comfortable from the start, but the pace difference between me and some other guys was huge.

At the Australian Open, partnering Albano Olivetti, the duo bowed out in the first round.What has followed is a string of partner changes, not by design but by necessity, as Olivetti's injury and the volatile nature of the rankings forced Bhambri to adapt.His journey resumed with Croatian veteran Ivan Dodig at the ATP 250 in Montpellier. Since then, the Indian ace has had to recalibrate often. 2025 has so far witnessed Bhambri partnering with seven different players in 13 tournaments.Despite the instability, the results speak volumes. Bhambri (and Alexei Popyrin) clinched the ATP 500 title in Dubai, made it to the quarters at Indian Wells and Miami, and became India’s No. 1 in doubles last March, overtaking Rohan Bopanna , who had held that position since October 2019.Speaking to TimesofIndia.com before the Madrid Open, Bhambri acknowledged the highs and lows, ""I think it's part and parcel of our tennis, of rankings going up and down. I think tennis rewards you for consistency, and I've had good success over the last few months or so, which has just shown in the rankings.""But now comes another test, the clay. On the red dirt, Bhambri hasn't had the best results in the run-up to the French Open. Four of his last five clay appearances ended in first-round exits, with Robert Galloway being his regular companion in the latest tournaments.The 32-year-old, however, remains undeterred.""When you move on to clay, it's a lot slower. So you have to have a lot more patience. You have to be prepared to hit a lot of balls. You have to be prepared to slide on the court, find your footing, you know, be prepared for the bad bounces at times. So you're playing a very slow and patient game,"" he added.The only exception to Bhambri's clay troubles came in Bordeaux, partnering Galloway again. The pair fought in the ATP Challenger final but fell just short, losing 6-7(1), 6-7(2) to the fourth-seeded pairing of Francisco Cabral and Lucas Miedler.His dethroning of Bopanna ended a 286-week reign, coupled with a steady upward trend in his doubles rankings since the COVID-19 pandemic, signals nothing but sheer improvement.While Bhambri's stay at the top did not last long enough as the old warhorse Boppana has again occupied the India No.1 spot in the latest ATP doubles rankings, the New Delhi-born, who spends his days back in India mentoring kids at Roundglass Tennis Academy alongside his childhood coach Aditya Sachdeva, has grown more stubborn than ever.""I think the ultimate goal is to try and do better from here, to try and compete for more trophies. The French (Open) coming up, Wimbledon coming up soon in July, those would be the two key goals where I would really like to hopefully put my best foot forward and succeed,"" he noted.With Roland Garros just around the corner, the elements of something remarkable are there, but the big question remains: Can Bhambri, amid all the changes and challenges, find the right formula on clay? Indian tennis won’t have to wait long for an answer.",Yuki Bhambri is India's No.1 doubles player. The 32-year-old has had a string of partner changes this year. The Indian ace has had to recalibrate often on the red dirt. He has had four of his last five clay appearances end in first-round exits.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121292757,imgsize-37056,width-400,resizemode-4/121292757.jpg"

Carlos Alcaraz won the Italian Open on Sunday after beating rival Jannik Sinner 7-6 (7/5), 6-1 in the final and firing a warning shot for Roland Garros .Alcaraz, who will climb to world number two behind Sinner on Monday, won his third title of the season ahead of the French Open which starts next weekend. The Spaniard claimed victory in his fourth final of the season and sent a message to the rest of the men's tour for Roland Garros where he will defend the title.Sinner tops the world rankings but his 26-match winning streak was ended by Alcaraz, also the man who had last beat him in last year's China Open final.Alcaraz is the only man to beat Sinner in a tour final since the start of 2024, when his Italian rival began his rise to the top of men's tennis and three Grand Slam titles.The 22-year-old has had a hugely impressive clay court swing this season even with the thigh injury which cost him the chance to compete at the Madrid Open.Alcaraz won in Rome a second Masters 1000 title of the year to go alongside his victory at Monte Carlo last month. He also reached the final in Barcelona.Finishing runner-up is still a hugely positive result for Sinner in his first tournament since his three-month ban for testing positive twice in March last year for traces of clostebol, a contamination doping authorities accepted was accidental.His progress in Rome also sets up the possibility of another final clash with Alcaraz at Roland Garros, with the two young stars of men's tennis set to be the two top seeds in Paris.Sinner was gunning to become the first Italian man to win at the Foro Italico since Adriano Panatta back in 1976, but he failed to make it a hat-trick of triumphs for home players in the Italian capital.Earlier Jasmine Paolini became the first woman since Monica Seles in 1990 to win the Rome singles and doubles titles when she and Sara Errani beat Veronika Kudermetova and Elise Mertens 6-4, 7-5.Paolini secured that brace of victories a day after overcoming former US Open champion Coco Gauff in straight sets, and becoming the first Italian woman to win the Rome singles title since Raffaella Reggi in 1985.","Carlos Alcaraz beat Jannik Sinner 7-6 (7/5), 6-1 in the Italian Open final.

NEW DELHI: In a remarkable victory at the Italian Open on Saturday, Jasmine Paolini secured her second 1000 series championship by defeating Coco Gauff 6-4, 6-2, setting a positive tone before Roland Garros this month.The achievement marks Paolini as the first Italian woman to secure the Rome tournament since Raffaella Reggi's victory in 1985, demonstrating her superiority over former US Open champion Gauff.The packed centre court at the Foro Italico witnessed Paolini's triumph, potentially the first of three titles that could be secured by Italian players in this year's Rome tournament.At 29, Paolini has become the oldest first-time Rome champion in the Open Era. Meanwhile, Gauff, who is eight years younger, missed the opportunity to become the youngest victor since Serena Williams' achievement in 2002.Gauff's performance was hindered by 55 unforced errors and seven double faults on serve, similar to her semi-final match against Zheng Qinwen, which simplified Paolini's path to victory.Paolini could achieve additional success in the women's doubles tournament, where she and Sara Errani face Veronika Kudermetova and Elise Mertens in Sunday's final.The last woman to win both singles and doubles titles in Rome was Monica Seles in 1990, whilst Vera Zvonareva remains the sole player to accomplish this feat in a 1000 series tournament at Indian Wells in 2009.The tournament continues with Paolini's fellow Italian Jannik Sinner set to compete against Carlos Alcaraz in Sunday's men's singles final.","Jasmine Paolini defeated Coco Gauff 6-4, 6-2 in the Italian Open final.

Sinner bounces back

Jannik Sinner set up a blockbuster Italian Open final with Carlos Alcaraz by beating Tommy Paul 1-6, 6-0, 6-3 on Friday.World number one Sinner fought back from a set down in front of a packed crowd to continue his march towards a first title at the Foro Italico .After a strangely slow start, Sinner again showed good form on centre court where, since returning to action last week from a three-month doping ban, he has taken his unbeaten run to 26 matches.And the 23-year-old will face down Alcaraz, the last man to beat Sinner in the final at the China Open in early October, with all eyes on another potential final between the pair at the French Open next month.A win for Sinner against his rival would see the men's Rome title go to an Italian for the first time since Adriano Panatta in 1976.""If I want to win Sunday I have to play one of my best tennis for sure,"" said Sinner.""Carlos has played incredible tennis today, so let's see what's coming but from my side you know incredible to be here in the final.""Alcaraz booked his place in the showdown by beating Sinner's countryman Lorenzo Musetti 6-3, 7-6 (7/4).The four-time Grand Slam champion overcame Musetti and the windy conditions in just over two hours to reach his fourth final of the season.""I'm going to have dinner, but my phone is going to be there watching (Sinner's) match,"" said Alcaraz after his win.""I have to know against who I'm going to play. I have to watch the match and see how they are going to play.""Musetti was beaten by Alcaraz in the Monte Carlo final last month and fell to his fifth straight defeat to the Spaniard after a frustrating display.And he believes that Alcaraz will have the better of it against Sinner if he brings his top form on Sunday evening.""I really rate Carlos. I think on clay that the best version of Carlos is favourite against anyone... that includes Jannik,"" he told reporters.Paul rattled off the first five games in 21 minutes in a near replica of what Sinner did to Casper Ruud on Thursday, closing out the first set in less than half an hour.The last time Sinner lost a set 6-1 was in the quarter-finals of the US Open against Daniil Medvedev, a match he won on his way to his second Grand Slam triumph.Sinner looked a shadow of the player who dominated tennis throughout 2024 right up to the start of his suspension, which was agreed with the World Anti-Doping Agency in early February.But from nowhere he came roaring back in the second set, finally forcing Paul back with some deep baseline shots of his own and his first aces of the match to win the second set to love and level the match.It was a complete role reversal with Paul now the one being thrown around the court, the world number 12 winning just 12 points in the second set and looking bewildered at how quickly the momentum shifted.Paul then handed Sinner the initiative with his second double fault of the night in game two of the third set. The Italian eventually won nine games in a row and marched on to victory.Earlier, Jasmine Paolini continued her bid to win the women's singles and doubles titles in Rome after reaching her second final of the week, this time alongside fellow Italian Sara Errani .Paolini and Errani, the reigning doubles champions, will meet Veronika Kudermetova and Elise Mertens in the final on Sunday, before which Paolini could already be crowed singles champion.Late bloomer Paolini takes on Coco Gauff on Saturday aiming for her second 1000 series title at the age of 29 and to become the first Italian women to win in Rome since Raffaella Reggi in 1985.","Jannik Sinner will play Carlos Alcaraz in the Italian Open final.

Gauff joins Paolini

Jannik Sinner marched into the semi-finals of the Italian Open on Thursday after destroying Casper Ruud in straight sets 6-0, 6-1 as Coco Gauff won a marathon three-set battle with China's Zheng Qinwen to advance to the women's final.American Gauff will face Italy's Jasmine Paolini in Saturday's title match after pulling through 7-6 (7/3), 4-6, 7-6 (7/4) in a match that lasted over three-and-a-half hours.Ruud was supposed to be Sinner's toughest test in Rome since he came back from his three-month doping ban, as the Norwegian came into the match in hot form on clay after winning in Madrid earlier this month.In his previous matches Sinner looked to be still finding his feet after his suspension, accepted from the World Anti-Doping Agency for testing positive for traces of clostebol in March last year.But the 23-year-old demolished sixth seed Ruud in just over an hour with an ominous display of tennis, his domination such that the home fans at the packed centre court, seemingly out of sympathy, began to cheer the rare points that Ruud won.""I was feeling great on court today. I think we all saw that,"" said Sinner.""How I felt today was very, very positive signs for me... I was serving well and also returning well. Moving great on the court, so I'm very happy about that.""Ruud even got the loudest celebration of the match when he held his serve for the only time, in game three of the second set, holding his arms aloft in ironic joy.""He was just everywhere... it's just like playing a wall that you know shoots hundred miles an hour balls at you all the time,"" said a bewildered Ruud.Tommy Paul, a 7-6 (7/4), 6-3 winner over Hubert Hurkacz in the day's first match, will have wondered what on earth he can do to stop Sinner if the Italian brings that form to Friday's last-four clash.Sinner won the first set in just 27 minutes, giving up only seven points as he stalked the court with intent, dressed all in black as he has been all week.And he then maintained his record of not dropping a set in the tournament to not so much stroll as smash into the last four, and send a message to Carlos Alcaraz.Spaniard Alcaraz, Sinner's key Grand Slam rival ahead of the French Open, will contest the other semi-final with Lorenzo Musetti on Friday afternoon, with the blockbuster final tennis fans wanted still on.Gauff prevailed on a centre court left mostly empty by fans who headed for the exits in large numbers after watching Sinner's tennis clinic.Former US Open winner Gauff won her third straight match against Olympic gold medallist Zheng, after coming through a tie in which she made 15 double faults on serve and there were a combined total of 156 unforced errors.The 21-year-old is looking for her first title of the season after losing the Madrid final to Sabalenka, and against home hope Paolini will find herself in a much fiercer atmosphere than the soporific crowd which stayed till past midnight to watch her reach her second final of the year.""I told myself I'm ready to go home,"" said an exhausted Gauff.""It was tough for me, finding my rhythm especially at night, it was so slow, I just tried to stay in there.""I was frustrated. She forced me to get out of my comfort zone.""Sixth seed Paolini is the third Italian woman to reach the Foro Italico final, and the first since her doubles partner Sara Errani was thumped by Serena Williams in 2014.Late bloomer Paolini, 29, will have a chance to be the first woman from the Mediterranean nation to win in Rome since Raffaella Reggi in 1985, after beating Peyton Stearns 7-5, 6-1.""It's a privilege to be in this position. I matured late as a tennis player but everyone has their own path. Some mature earlier and some later,"" said Paolini.""I'm just enjoying it without thinking too much about the past.""Paolini could yet win both the singles and women's doubles tournaments, with her and Errani taking on Mirra Andreeva and Diana Shnaider in the semi-finals on Friday.","Jannik Sinner thrashes Casper Ruud in straight sets 6-0, 6-1.

Top-ranked tennis player Jannik Sinner met with Pope Leo XIV at the Vatican City on Wednesday during a break from the Italian Open , presenting the pontiff with a tennis racket and offering to play. The meeting came after the pope, known for his liking towards the sport, had earlier joked about not inviting Sinner, making a wordplay on the athlete's surname.The encounter took place in the Vatican's auditorium reception room, where Sinner arrived with his parents.""It's an honor,"" Sinner said in Italian as he presented the pope with a racket and ball, suggesting a quick volley.The 69-year-old American pope, who hails from Chicago, declined the offer to play, looking at the surrounding antiques and saying, ""Better not.""Leo XIV made a light-hearted comment about his white cassock being appropriate for Wimbledon, referencing the tournament's all-white dress code. The meeting included discussions about Sinner's progress in the Italian Open, where he faces a quarterfinal match on Thursday against Madrid champion Casper Ruud.Sinner is returning to competition after a three-month doping ban, which was determined to be due to accidental contamination.The Italian player is aiming to become the first from his country to claim the Rome title since Adriano Panatta's victory in 1976.During the interaction, Italian Tennis and Padel Federation head Angelo Binaghi presented the pope with an honorary federation card. ""We all felt the passion that Leo XIV has for our sport and this filled us with pride,"" Binaghi stated. ""We hope to embrace the Holy Father again soon, maybe on a tennis court.""The meeting included a photo session featuring the Davis Cup trophy, which Sinner helped Italy secure for the second consecutive year. The Billie Jean King Cup trophy, won by Italy in 2024, was also displayed during the meeting.Earlier in the week, Sinner had responded positively to the pope's initial joke, noting it was ""a good thing for us tennis players"" to have a pope who enjoys the sport.Beyond tennis, Pope Leo XIV is known to be a devoted Chicago White Sox baseball fan, following in the tradition of his predecessor, Pope Francis, who supported the Buenos Aires football club San Lorenzo.","Top-ranked tennis player Jannik Sinner met with Pope Leo XIV at the Vatican City on Wednesday during a break from the Italian Open.

Carlos Alcaraz made a triumphant return following his injury recovery, defeating Serbian qualifier Dusan Lajovic 6-3, 6-3 at the Italian Open on Friday.The world number three had previously pulled out of the Madrid Open, citing an upper right leg issue that impacted his performance in the Barcelona Open final, along with a left leg concern.Alcaraz competed against Lajovic whilst wearing a black support that covered his upper right leg, extending just below his knee.""The body felt great,"" Alcaraz said.

He regained control by breaking back, showcasing his court abilities at the Foro Italico with an impressive backhand winner following a drop shot.The second set progressed similarly, with Alcaraz establishing an early advantage. He registered 24 winners and 24 unforced errors during the match.Following his Monte Carlo Masters victory in April, Alcaraz's clay court statistics this season improved to 10-1.

Bombay Sport Exchange Ep 4: Prof. Ratnakar Shetty on BCCI, cricket politics & Indian cricket's growth

Jannik Sinner will delight crowds at the Rome Open this week when the world number one makes his return to tennis, but the Italian's three-month doping ban has allowed other local rising stars to move into the limelight.Sinner was on Monday joined in the top 10 of the men's world rankings by Lorenzo Musetti , who is at number nine after reaching the Monte Carlo final and the last four in Madrid.Meanwhile Luciano Darderi and Flavio Cobolli won tournaments in Marrakesh and Bucharest in April, further underlining the strength in depth that Italian tennis has behind Sinner, a three-time Grand Slam winner.Filippo Volandri , captain of the Italy team which has won the last two editions of the Davis Cup, told AFP that ""Italian tennis is clearly in a golden age"".""But it's been a long time coming, we're seeing the fruits of work which was started some time ago,"" he added.Volandri, who has been in charge of top-level male players for the Italian Tennis Federation (FITP) for the last nine years, showed AFP a graphic which illustrates Italy's recent progress.Between 2005 and 2015 Italian players won eight ATP titles -- with seven of those in the lowest 250 category -- but since 2016 the tally of tournament wins has more than trebled to 31.Five of those 31 wins have come in top-level Master 1000 tournaments, with another three being Sinner's Grand Slam triumphs. Sinner is responsible in total for 19 of Italy's ATP wins since 2016.""Jannik is the product of a movement which had already given us Matteo Berrettini reaching the Wimbledon final (in 2021). He is the result of a system that works,"" said Volandri.Michelangelo Dell'Edera, the director of the FITP's Higher Training Institute, told AFP that the federation runs a geographically-decentralised system which was put in place at the end of the 1990s.""Every province has a coach from the federation for children between 8-10 years old, while each region has a manager in charge of players between the ages of 11 and 16,"" explained Dell'Edera.Players were for a long time obliged to move to the national training centre at Tirrenia, just up the Tuscany coast from Livorno, but that is no longer the case.""Decentralisation means making our skills available to young players and their coaches,"" said Volandri.""We're reaching out to them rather than tearing them away from their families and their lives.""Dell'Edera said the renaissance in Italian tennis has also come via a change in training philosophy and playing style.""To make a comparison with another sport, we've gone from the marathon, where players were slugging forehands and backhands, to the 100m, a sort of 'speed tennis' where the emphasis is on the serve and return, two shots which determine whether a point can be won,"" he said.Every year for the past seven years, just before the Rome Open the FITP invites its 12,000 coaches to a seminar at the picturesque Foro Italico where the major clay court tournament is played.The seminar is held to discuss training, physical preparation and tactics, with guest appearances from big foreign names in the field such as Emilio Sanchez and Brad Gilbert, who were there on Saturday.Gilbert, the former coach of tennis icon Andre Agassi, is impressed with the work being done in Italy.""They're getting to the top, they have Sinner. Sometimes you get to the top and you rest. If anything, they are spending more,"" said Gilbert.""They've made an incredible commitment and they've got a great supporting team. Sinner is the reward.""But they started this thing 10, 15 years ago and they're still producing. I just watched this kid... Federico Cina.

This sport is brutal but I will keep trying, I think this loss will make me better,"" Draper said.The match began with Draper taking an early lead, breaking Ruud's serve for a 2-1 advantage in the first set. However, Ruud fought back to level the set at 5-5 before claiming it as Draper mishit a forehand.Draper dominated the second set, making just one unforced error and successfully breaking Ruud twice to force a deciding set.The final set saw intense competition, with Ruud breaking in the fifth game and consolidating for a 4-2 lead. Despite Draper's resistance and a late surge, Ruud secured the victory on his first match point.The 26-year-old Ruud, ranked 15th, added this Masters 1000 title to his collection of 12 ATP titles at 250 and 500 level.Draper remained optimistic about his future prospects despite the loss.""I honestly feel like I'm at the start of my journey. I'm going to keep on improving and keep on pushing hard and keep these sort of tough moments in my head to keep on driving myself to be better,"" he said.","Casper Ruud beats Jack Draper 7-5, 3-6, 6-4 in Madrid Open final.

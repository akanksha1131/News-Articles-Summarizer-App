Poll Who do you think is the strongest contender for the wicketkeeper position? Dhruv Jurel Ishan Kishan Rishabh Pant Other

NEW DELHI: With the announcement of India’s ODI squad for the three-match home series against New Zealand imminent, Dhruv Jurel has ensured the selectors have little room to ignore him. The young wicketkeeper-batter has delivered a timely and emphatic message through a stunning run of scores in the ongoing Vijay Hazare Trophy, underlining his credentials in the 50-over format.Jurel has piled up more than 300 runs in just three matches, beginning with an 80 against Hyderabad, followed by 67 versus Chandigarh, before producing a sensational unbeaten 160 against Baroda. The latest knock, played under pressure and at breathtaking speed, has come at the perfect moment as India weigh their options behind the stumps for the ODI series starting January 11.On Monday, Jurel was the standout performer as Uttar Pradesh thrashed Baroda by 54 runs to consolidate their position at the top of Group B. Walking in after the dismissal of opener Aryan Juyal, Jurel tore into the Baroda attack, smashing 160 not out off 101 balls, an innings studded with 15 fours and eight sixes.He first added 131 runs with Rinku Singh for the fourth wicket and then stitched a rapid 122-run stand with Prashant Veer to propel UP to a mammoth 369 for 7.Baroda’s bowlers had no answers, with pacer Rasikh Dar conceding 102 runs in his quota. In reply, despite fighting efforts from Krunal Pandya, Baroda fell short, bowled out for 315 on the final ball.Jurel’s purple patch has come amid reports suggesting that Rishabh Pant could be left out of the ODI squad, having not featured in the format since August 2024. That has opened up a selection debate involving multiple wicketkeeper-batters. Ishan Kishan, who has already been named in the T20 World Cup squad, remains a strong contender after a prolific domestic season, including a record-breaking Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy and a blazing Vijay Hazare hundred.Yet, in this crowded race, Jurel’s consistency and impact stand out. Not picked for the T20 World Cup, the 24-year-old has let his bat do the talking in the longer white-ball format. As selectors finalise combinations for the New Zealand series, Jurel’s Vijay Hazare heroics have turned the spotlight firmly in his direction, making his case hard to overlook.",Dhruv Jurel has scored more than 300 runs in just three matches. The 24-year-old scored 160 against Baroda in the Vijay Hazare Trophy.

GM Volodar Murzin Exclusive: GCL, Playing in India, Russia, Candidates 2026, and more

Poll Do you think Arjun Erigaisi will secure a world title in the near future? Yes, definitely! Maybe, he has potential. No, he will continue to face challenges.

Overshadowed by Gukesh, Pragg’s world titles

NAGPUR: Hope. Heartbreak. Repeat. That has long defined Arjun Erigaisi’s relationship with world championships. For eight years, the script barely changed: promise gave way to disappointment and near-misses piled up into a quiet burden. Until Sunday night, when Arjun finally caught a break, secured a podium finish in the Open section of the World Rapid Championship and became only the second Indian, after Viswanathan Anand , to do so.In 2017 — the year Anand won his last world rapid title — Arjun finished runner-up in the U-14 World Youth Championship. Since then, a world-championship podium had remained a so-near-yet-so-far affair.The wonder boy from Warangal has collected records across a 14-year journey: titles in international rated events, an Olympiad gold and a rise to India’s No. 1 in ratings. Despite having the strength of a Super GM, luck often played hide-andseek with him — in world titles as well as Candidates qualification. In Oct last year, Arjun became the 16th player in history to cross the 2800 mark in live ratings, only the second Indian to do so after Anand.In Doha, Arjun began brightly at the World Rapid Championship, sharing the lead with world No. 1 Magnus Carlsen . In the last round on Day One, he held Carlsen — who had two extra pawns — to a draw in a marathon 101-move game to stay in touch with the lead.Day Two brought his first defeat, followed by a couple of draws against lower-ranked opponents. Still, Arjun stayed joint 2nd. On the final day, just when was going great guns, he was stunned by 14-year-old and 156th-ranked Yagiz Kaan Erdogmus and nearly slipped out of medal contention. He kept fighting, however, and won the last two rounds.As it turned out, Carlsen took a clear one-point lead and was just a draw away from regaining the title. The joint second-placed players drew and Arjun sneaked onto the podium — by half a point on tie-breaks. In the previous three World Rapid C’ships, he had missed bronze by the same margin.In 2018, Arjun became a GM as a 14-year-old, within four months. Post-pandemic, from 2021 onwards, he played nonstop and registered his first Elo surge, climbing 230 places from 359th to 129th in the world. By 2022, he made a jump from 134th to 21st, placing himself firmly among the new generation of Indian stars alongside Gukesh and Praggnanandhaa.Between Nov 2023 and July 2024, Arjun outpaced the global elite to add 66 points for a rating of 2778, rising from 30th to fourth in the world. Yet, despite his consistency, he was often overshadowed by world champion Gukesh and Pragg, a twice Candidates winner and World Cup finalist. When he was eliminated in the Goa World Cup, Arjun was heartbroken. But he came back stronger in Doha.","The wonder boy from Warangal has collected records across a 14-year journey.

India World Cup squad: No Shubman Gill, Jitesh as selectors recall Rinku, Ishan Kishan

Middle order muddle



Arshdeep to turn up for Punjab



NEW DELHI: One spot. Three contenders. And no obvious answer. The backup option for KL Rahul 's wicketkeeper spot has quietly turned into a happy headache for the men's senior selection committee led by Ajit Agarkar.With the T20 World Cup around the corner, the ODIs have taken a backseat. However, the race for the second wicketkeeper’s role in the three-match ODI series against New Zealand, starting January 11, has heated up, with Ishan Kishan Rishabh Pant and Dhruv Jurel the contenders.In the ODI series against South Africa, Pant was slotted as the backup option, with Jurel picked purely as a batter. With Ishan bolting back into the T20 national reckoning after an exhilarating campaign in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy, he has emerged as a strong contender.Ishan, who led Jharkhand to their maiden Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy title, hammered 517 runs and was brought into India's squad for the T20 World Cup as a backup opener. Kishan also became only the second player to score a century (off 45 balls) in the tournament final.After a two-year absence from the national team, Ishan Kishan’s stock is rising again. The southpaw was asked to take rest by the BCCI after his blistering 39-ball 125 against Karnataka in Jharkhand’s opening fixture of the ongoing Vijay Hazare Trophy but has now been instructed by the selectors to play two more matches, TimesofIndia.com has learnt.“He (Ishan Kishan) has been given rest by the BCCI team. He has gone back home. He will be back on January 2,” Kumar Kushagra, Jharkhand’s stand-in captain, had said at the toss ahead of their match against Rajasthan.Kishan, who is in Patna, will join the Jharkhand squad on January 2 and will play the fixtures against Kerala and Madhya Pradesh, scheduled for January 3 and 6, respectively. “He is in the contention for sure,” a source tracking the developments tells TimesofIndia.com.The 27-year-old was very close to a return for the ODI series against South Africa, but his selection didn’t get the required support from the men who matter.“When I was not selected in the Indian team, I felt quite bad because I was doing well. But I told myself that if I am not selected with this sort of performance, then maybe I have to do more. Maybe I have to make my team win. Maybe we have to do well as a unit,” Kishan had said after the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy final.If Kishan gets the nod, it could be a bit unfair to Rishabh Pant as the Test vice-captain has been warming the bench in ODIs for over a year now. He has been playing the Vijay Hazare Trophy, but the Delhi captain's returns have been mixed: in three matches, he has managed 97 runs, including a 70.Jurel, meanwhile, batting at No. 3 for Uttar Pradesh, is in red-hot form, hammering 307 runs in three matches, including his maiden List A hundred against Baroda. He was also picked for South Africa ODIs but as a specialist batter.Fit-again captain Shubman Gill is all set to make a comeback. This means Yashasvi Jaiswal, who scored his maiden ODI century against the Proteas, will be back on the bench.Vice-captain Shreyas Iyer will also return for the New Zealand ODIs and could force Ruturaj Gaikwad out of the Playing XI. TimesofIndia.com has also learnt that the team management wants at least a couple of left-handed batters in the batting order in an otherwise right-hander-heavy line-up.In the ODI series against South Africa, India played Washington Sundar at No.6 and No.5 in the first two matches and then included Tilak Varma in the playing XI for the third game.Further down, it will be interesting to see whether selectors opt for a left-handed wicketkeeper-batter to play as a specialist in the middle-order. Against Jharkhand in the Vijay Hazare Trophy, Kishan batted at No. 6 and slammed a 33-ball century.He sent a strong message to the selectors and has thrown his hat into the ring if they are looking for an in-form southpaw in the middle order. Pant, too, is batting at No. 5 for Delhi.There isn’t much separating Kishan and Pant, but Kishan is a strong fielder in the outfield, unlike India's Test vice-captain. This gives him an edge.Left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh will represent Punjab in two Vijay Hazare Trophy fixtures on January 3 and 6. The 26-year-old missed the initial round after being asked to rest due to workload management, TimesofIndia.com has learnt.Arshdeep, who has been playing constant cricket since the Indian Premier League (IPL), last played on December 19 in the fifth and final T20I against South Africa. With Jasprit Bumrah likely to be rested for the three-match series against New Zealand, the left-arm quick, who impressed with the new ball against South Africa, is also in contention for the ODIs.The squad for the three-match ODI series against New Zealand is likely to be picked in the first week of January. The first game will be played on January 11 in Vadodara, and the ODI team is likely to assemble on January 7 or 8 in the city.","Ishan Kishan, Dhruv Jurel, and Rishabh Pant are the contenders for the second wicketkeeper's role in the three-match ODI series against New Zealand.

NEW DELHI: Former India captain Anil Kumble has shed light on the evolving role of Afghanistan leg-spinner Rashid Khan for the Gujarat Titans ahead of the 2026 Indian Premier League season, pointing to a strategic shift in how the franchise may use its premier spinner.Speaking on the ‘TATA IPL Auction Review’, JioStar expert Kumble said Rashid’s workload will need careful management, particularly alongside bowlers such as Sai Kishore. He also felt that all-round options like Rahul Tewatia and Washington Sundar could play a bigger role for Gujarat Titans in IPL 2026.""I think the novelty of Rashid Khan has worn off a little. There are many similar bowlers available now, so he is not as intimidating as before. His workload has to be managed more, along with bowlers like Sai Kishore. Even Rahul Tewatia and Washington Sundar can contribute more for GT this season,"" Kumble said.Former India all-rounder and JioStar expert Irfan Pathan also weighed in on Gujarat Titans’ decision to place faith in West Indies veteran Jason Holder ""Their bet on Jason Holder is interesting. He is an amazing bowler with the new ball, but his batting has improved, especially his six-hitting abilities.GT has put a lot of faith in that. Their main strength is their top three batters: Shubman Gill, Sai Sudharsan, and Jos Buttler. How they use Washington Sundar will be important, as his batting has gotten better too. The role of Glenn Phillips, or whoever plays at number four or five, will also be very big,"" Pathan said.Meanwhile, former India opener and JioStar expert Abhinav Mukund explained Gujarat Titans’ preference for left-arm pacers and all-rounders like Holder while shaping their squad for the upcoming season.""Gujarat Titans love fast bowlers, especially left-arm pacers like Prithviraj Yarra and Luke Wood. Ashok Sharma had a great Syed Mushtaq Ali season. But Jason Holder is there because they need someone to bat and finish innings at number six or seven, and bowl a couple of overs. They want someone to finish at the death. The team is so strong at the top that they felt they needed this. Last year, GT often did not play all four overseas players. So maybe if Glenn Phillips is fit, he plays in the middle order and Jason Holder finishes. Overall, they still look like a brilliant side. They have the best young Indian talent. I don't know who will control them on the bench. Good luck to Parthiv Patel and Ashish Nehra,"" Mukund said.","Former India captain Anil Kumble shed light on the evolving role of Afghanistan leg-spinner Rashid Khan for the Gujarat Titans.

Why Mumbai's iconic Azad Maidan is no longer safe for cricket | Bombay Sport Exchange

NEW DELHI: According to former Australia cricketer Tom Moody, India has so much talent that picking the best team has become very difficult.While this is a good situation to be in, it also puts a lot of pressure on selectors and captains.""One of the issues with Indian cricket is that there is too much talent. There are simply too many options. It's a wonderful problem to have, but it becomes a nightmare for a selector or a captain,"" Moody said on JioHotstar.Former England captain Eoin Morgan also shared his views, especially on white-ball cricket.He stressed the importance of a strong bowling unit in winning big tournaments.Morgan believes that when a team can defend low scores, it builds confidence and belief. This mindset, he feels, can make a team very dangerous in competitions like the World Cup.He said, ""In white-ball cricket, bowling attacks win you tournaments. When you can defend low scores, it creates a belief within the team that you can win a game from anywhere. That belief becomes a big threat for any team in a World Cup.""These comments come at a time when India has announced its squad for the T20 World Cup 2026. Suryakumar Yadav will lead the team in his first ICC tournament as captain, with Axar Patel named as vice-captain. The squad was unveiled earlier this month by BCCI secretary Devajit Saikia at the board’s headquarters, alongside chief selector Ajit Agarkar.India’s batting looks aggressive and flexible. Abhishek Sharma, known for his explosive style and high strike rate, is likely to open the innings with Sanju Samson.Ishan Kishan has returned to the T20 setup as a backup opener and wicketkeeper after last playing in 2023.The middle order appears strong, with players like Tilak Varma, Hardik Pandya, Shivam Dube, Axar Patel, Washington Sundar and Rinku Singh providing both power and balance.In bowling, Kuldeep Yadav and Varun Chakravarthy lead the spin department, while Jasprit Bumrah heads the fast-bowling attack along with Arshdeep Singh and Harshit Rana.India have been placed in Group A with Namibia, the Netherlands, Pakistan and the United States. The team will begin its World Cup campaign against the USA on February 7 in Mumbai.","Former Australia cricketer Tom Moody says India has so much talent that picking the best team has become very difficult.

Abu Dhabi Knight Riders (ADKR) came through in a do-or-die game to become the fourth team to book their place in the ILT20 playoffs. They will join Dubai Capitals (DC), Desert Vipers (DC) and MI Emirates (MIE) in making a final push to lift the trophy.In the first Qualifier, Desert Vipers will take on MI Emirates and the Eliminator will pit ADKR against the defending champions Capitals. As the rules go, the losing team from Qualifier 1 will then go up against the winning team of the Eliminator for a place in the final.Of the four teams that have qualified for the playoffs, the DC and MIE have lifted the ILT20 trophy before, in 2025 and 2024, respectively.The Vipers, however, have reached the final on two occasions, in 2023 and 2025, but never gone all the way. ADKR are into the ILT20 playoffs for the second time, having been to the knockouts in 2024.Desert Vipers had a blazing start to the season with six wins on the trot including close victories against ADKR (by 2 wickets with 3 balls remaining), Gulf Giants (in a Super Over), MI Emirates (by 1 run) and Dubai Capitals (by 5 wickets with 2 balls remaining). Eventually they finished with 8 wins out of 10 league matches to top the table.MI Emirates finished second in the points table despite a mixed start to the campaign. They lost three in the first five matches before staging a remarkable turnaround to clinch five consecutive wins - all by comfortable margin.Both Dubai Capitals and ADKR had patchy pushes to the playoffs during the league stage. DC, who are now led by Mohammad Nabi , strung three wins in a row only after a formation of two losses, two wins and two losses. They closed out the league stage with yet another defeat.ADKR, who had four wins and six losses in the group stage, had a poor campaign but not worse than Gulf Giants and Sharjah Warriorz who had three wins and seven defeats. Jason Holder-led ADKR were bottom of the standings halfway through the league stage with four defeats in five matches.Consecutive wins, against DV and GG, steered them up the standings. One final push, also against the Gulf Giants, on Sunday, helped them into the playoffs. Sam Curran had made a rollicking start with the bat for Desert Vipers. The England international has had the most impact so far this season with 285 runs at an average of 35.62, a strike rate of 123.91 with standout innings of an unbeaten 67 and 52, against Giants and DC, respectively. He has been less effective with the ball, picking 7 wickets, but has been an all-round asset for the table toppers.Equally decisive for the franchise has been Max Holden - the leading run-scorer (318 runs) going into the ILT20 playoffs. From the infamy of not being stumped on purpose and being retired out a ball later, against the MI Emirates on December 9, the 28-year-old has turned a leaf.Since that night of 37-ball 42, Holden has produced a 64-ball 41 vs Gulf Giants; 22-ball 34 vs Dubai Capitals; 43-ball 52 vs ADKR and Player of the Match winning 46-ball 66 against Sharjah Warriorz.Dubai Capitals have seen multiple strong individual performances so far.

RAW TALENTFancy a swig of raw milk? Good for your gut, and legs it seems. Head too. It’s superfood, just ask Super Haaland. He loves to visit a Cheshire farm to get his locally sourced bottles. And as you know, he rarely bottles up in front of goal – scoring 25 times in his 23 matches for City so far.

The Club World Cup may be already there. Winners Chelsea lifted a replica – Trump wanted to steal their celebration too but Cole & Co. were too clever to let him take the limelight.

PSG’s success story in 2025 is one to behold -- How Luis Enrique rebooted the continent’s nearly men into European champions with discipline, teamwork, tactics, belief while deleting the individualist approach.All for one and one for all, Luis’ musketeers reeled in trophy after trophy but there was one battle PSG lost, to former talisman Kylian Mbappe, in the boardroom and the courtroom. In this sabre fencing, Paris employed the slashing technique, cutting off the Frenchman’s salary that included a so-called ‘ethics bonus’. Mad in Madrid, Mbappe’s riposte was of the legal kind. After the back and forth, the court ruled that the former employers pay up unpaid wages of 60m euros. Back in Spain, Mbappe earned some Real love from the Bernabeu faithful, after scoring 59 goals in 59 games, equaling his ‘hero’ Cristiano Ronaldo’s record, the most in a calendar year. How did he celebrate it? Siuuuuu…NO FAN’S LANDThe Big Leagues’ global expansion was put on hold. La Liga president Javier Tebas’ plan to ‘host’ a league match between Barcelona and Villarreal in Miami 7,500-km away from the shores of Spain was cancelled. The league had also chartered planes to take around 2,000 to 3,000 Villarreal fans to the US of A. In Oct, there were league-wide protests, stopping active play to express displeasure. Ultimately, Tebas had to bow down as organisers pulled out. Last week, a high-profile plan to stage a Serie A match -- AC Milan vs. Como -- in Perth was scrapped.DIAMONDS ARE FOREVEROne of the most viral pics of 2025 was of Georgina Rodriguez’s oversized diamond engagement ring reported to be valued between $2 and 5m, the kind of flashy display that one can associate with her fiancé Cristiano Ronaldo.

Salah won it that day, and the tears flowed.Since then, fortunes have taken a different turn for both Liverpool and Mo. After promising and delivering a record-equalling 20th league title in April, ‘the Egyptian king’ found himself on the sidelines, and an outburst against club and gaffer, left him on the brink of an exit as he proceeded to AFCON duty with his legacy under threat and a question mark over his return.In Spain, close on the heels of a successful Euro campaign, Lamine Yamal finds himself ostracized -- from ‘wonderkid’ to ‘bad loser’, with his moves scrutinized in public by a damning jealous social media.

Ryan Rickelton press conference: 'Been tough last couple of months mentally in India'

Florian Wirtz's first Liverpool goal fired the Reds into the Premier League 's top four despite an unconvincing 2-1 win over Wolves on a day both clubs paid tribute to Diogo Jota . Jota, who was killed in a car accident alongside his brother Andre Silva in July, won four trophies after joining Liverpool from Wolves in 2020.Two of his children led the teams out as mascots, while his wife Rute Cardoso watched on from the sidelines.Both sets of fans sang chants in Jota's name in the 18th and 20th minutes -- the shirt numbers he wore during his spells at Molineux and Anfield respectively.""After the tragedy happened until now, I have seen so many special moments -- where the fans remembered him or our players conducted themselves unbelievably in the circumstances,"" said Liverpool boss Arne Slot.""Not only our fans but the fans of away teams have shown the respect both Diogo and his brother deserved. It was special to see his children being the mascot and how emotional it was before the game and then in the 20th minute.""On the field, both clubs have suffered this season with Wolves staring down the barrel of relegation after taking just two points from their opening 18 league games.Liverpool's form has improved of late and Wirtz is beginning to show flashes of the brilliance that lured the English champions into paying Bayer Leverkusen £100 million ($135 million) for the German international.The 22-year-old registered his first Premier League assist last weekend for a goal that came at some cost to Liverpool as Alexander Isak suffered a broken leg in opening the scoring against Tottenham.Shorn of the most expensive player in English football history for the coming months, there is even more pressure on Wirtz to deliver on his hefty price tag.""He's been very important for us throughout the season. But in football it is about results, you are mainly judged on results or on goals and assists,"" added Slot.""I think today he showed much more than just the goal he scored; he was special for us in many parts of the game.""Wirtz finally opened his account in his 23rd Liverpool appearance by prodding home Hugo Ekitike's pass to double the home side's lead.Just 90 seconds earlier, Liverpool had made the breakthrough when Ryan Gravenberch slammed in Jeremie Frimpong's cross.Yet, even with a 2-0 half-time lead against a side on course to become the worst in Premier League history, Slot could not relax.Santiago Bueno exposed Liverpool's frailty from set-pieces to pull a goal back just six minutes into the second half.Slot's men have made a habit of late collapses at Leeds and Tottenham in recent weeks and needed a perfectly-timed tackle from Conor Bradley to deny Jhon Arias a late equaliser.","Liverpool beat Wolves 2-1 in Premier League.

This year, most scrambled to check the Google Maps to find Curacao when the smallest-ever nation, in terms of population and size, qualified for next year’s mammoth World Cup 2026. With 155,000 inhabitants, the Caribbean island was guided to the top tier by Dick Advocaat, the former Rangers and PSV boss who has also worked with eight national teams including his native Netherlands (1992-94).Sebastian Migne never set foot on Haiti, another Caribbean nation, because international flights do not land there. They played all their World Cup home qualifiers in Curacao, some 500 miles across the sea.These football stories are the brightest beacon of 2025. In contrast, the darkness around Indian football seems to have grown deeper, unfathomable, with no light at the end of the tunnel.The year gone by has seen All India Football Federation officials spend more time making rounds of the courts than the national team spent on the field.It might delight a research scholar to know that AIFF has presented itself to the Supreme Court 16 times and counting.The national team has played only 12 matches. None of it, though, will bring cheer to the fans.Never since Independence has Indian football slipped into such a deep abyss. For the first time since 1996, when the national league was begun by then-AIFF president Priya Ranjan Das Munshi, it has stalled.One can say with a heavy heart that the league is an orphan now.The sponsorship ran out. The new occupants of Football House, who took charge in 2022, were aware of the matter. But the negotiations just refused to yield any money, assurance, or hope.Since 2010, the AIFF received Rs 50 crore every year from Football Sports Development Limited (FSDL), a Reliance Industries subsidiary, as part of an agreement. The 15-year contract ran out on Dec 8.It was obvious to all, except those in Football House, that no one wants to waste money to keep Indian football – once called a sleeping giant by Sepp Blatter just over a decade and a half ago – alive and awake.Till reports last came in, the AIFF plans to start the elite league around Feb 7-8 after presenting a 20-year plan to the ISL clubs. In accordance with the constitution, the league will be owned and operated by the AIFF and will “implement the principles of promotion and relegation.”“I am convinced we can start the league and then work out a long-term solution,” said IFA secy Anirban Dutta, a member of the committee to resolve the ISL crisis.All year, the stakeholders went into hair-splitting debates and nuanced offerings but the outcome, sadly, has been zero. Even a few clubs had temporarily stopped paying salaries to the players. There has been a frustrating sense of ennui.Last heard, there was some warmth shown by the beleaguered clubs towards the AIFF’s proposals. The format for a truncated league is expected to be confirmed in the year’s final week.Add to it the dismal performance of the national team. Hours after India lost to Bangladesh in their last Asian Cup qualification engagement, Haiti’s ticket to the World Cup sent euphoric shock waves around the world. To watch India’s matches this year, under coaches Manolo Marquez and Khalid Jamil, was like visiting the dentist with a severe toothache.The Indian senior men’s team failed to qualify for the 2027 AFC Asian Cup, which means no competitive football until at least Nov 2027. That is nearly three years without meaningful matches. One wonders what will be Khalid Jamil’s work schedule now?One question keeps haunting, though. If Curacao are able to hire the services of a world-renowned coach like Advocaat, why could India, claimed to be the fourth-largest economy in the world, never reach beyond the Manolos and the Stimacs and the Koevermans? One can keep waiting for an answer but there will only be silence from the All India Football Federation.Following some creditable performances against Bahrain (2-0) and Brunei (6-0), U-23 coach Naushad Moosa got stuck in Doha. Not one to be easily perturbed, even by the sudden bombing of the Qatari capital, Moosa showered rousing praise on the boys. But his enthusiasm was laced with bleakness.“What’s next for the boys? They will go back to their clubs and warm the bench. They won’t be getting any minutes,” he had said in Sept. With the U-17s, Bibiano Fernandes also made headlines by helping the boys cross the Asian Cup qualification hurdles.Repeating himself, Moosa confirmed his apprehensions in Dec. “Nothing is happening. The players too are sadly cooling their heels.” And we couldn’t but recall the days not too long ago, when the AIFF had to put a cap of 45 matches on the national team players.One may point out that these are silver linings. If so, then why can’t Manolo or Jamil do without Sunil Chhetri , India’s weather-beaten warhorse who is past 40? The striker had to break his retirement vows and don the India shirt again, confirming that Indian football’s cupboard is starkly bare.The year 2025 will stay in memory as the lowest point in Indian football.LEAGUE UNCERTAINTY: It’s the end of December, half-time in most football seasons, a time when clubs redraw their strategies, depending on the progress they’ve made in the league. This year, nothing. Indian football has never seen anything like this. There’s no word on the top tier ISL or the I-League, because the AIFF has simply failed to find a commercial partner. Everything’s at a standstill: clubs have paused first team operations, players have stopped training and many foreigners plan to move elsewhere once the transfer window opens on Jan 1. One club has told players they will have to “forego salaries” for months and they’d be “happy to resume payments” only from the date of restart.CAMPS WITHOUT PLAYERS: National team camps often kicked off without half the players. Coach Khalid Jamil wanted more time with the boys, but clubs refused to release players outside the FIFA international windows. It was no different for U-23 assignments. The trust deficit between the two parties has grown so much that Mohun Bagan SG, who have the maximum players at national camps, even accused the federation of negligence over the handling of their captain Subhashish Bose.MONUMENTAL FAILURE: In the 15 months between May 2024 and August 2025, the national team had three coaches — Igor Stimac, Manolo Marquez, Khalid Jamil — none of whom could ensure that India makes it to the AFC Asian Cup, the country’s first failure since the tournament was expanded to accommodate 24 teams. In the final round of qualifiers, India were the highest-ranked side but finished at the bottom, unable to register a single win and in five matches, scoring just twice. The defeat to Bangladesh in Dhaka, the first in 22 years, rankled the most.THE BIG EXIT: The City Football Group’s exit from Mumbai City FC was probably the biggest reflection of the mess that is Indian football. CFG, the world’s leading private owner and operator of 13 clubs, including Manchester City, had joined hands with Mumbai City with much fanfare. Their decision to divest its shareholding in the club is a huge blow. The reason: “CFG made this decision following a comprehensive commercial review and in light of the ongoing uncertainty surrounding the future of the Indian Super League (ISL). ”BUT, A SILVER LINING: The women’s team provided joy in an otherwise grim state. The senior team defied the odds to defeat World Cuppers Thailand and qualify for the AFC Asian Cup. The U-17 and U-20 teams also left India with three continental competitions to play for in the opening months of 2026. At club level, East Bengal’s SAFF Club Championship triumph and a first group stage win in the AFC Women’s Champions League brought cheer.UNDER MANOLO MARQUEZUNDER KHALID JAMILIndia won Bronze Medal at CAFA Nations CupTOTAL MATCHES: 11India Won: 3India Lost: 5Drawn: 3Goals Scored: 8Goals Conceded: 12","Indian football has slipped into such a deep abyss. The national team has played only 12 matches this year. The All India Football Federation officials spend more time making rounds of the courts than the national team spent on the field. For the first time since 1996, when the national league was begun, it has stalled.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126211640,imgsize-89856,width-400,resizemode-4/india-vs-bangladesh-football.jpg"
Rayan Cherki steals the show as Manchester City edge Nottingham Forest to go top of the Premier League,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/rayan-cherki-steals-the-show-as-manchester-city-edge-nottingham-forest-to-go-top-of-the-premier-league/articleshow/126206283.cms,"Manchester City's Rayan Cherki celebrates with Erling Haaland (Barrington Coombs/PA via AP)

Rayan Cherki delivered another decisive statement of his growing influence at Manchester City as his late strike secured a 2-1 Premier League win over Nottingham Forest and lifted Pep Guardiola’s side to the top of the table on Saturday.The France international was at the heart of everything City did well at the City Ground. After setting up Tijjani Reijnders for the opening goal early in the second half, Cherki returned in the closing stages to fire home the winner, capping a standout display that underlined his importance to City’s title push.City had to weather sustained pressure from Forest, who matched Guardiola’s men for large spells and were level soon after falling behind. Omari Hutchinson, scoring his first goal for the club, punished a rare City mistake to bring the home side back into the contest and briefly threaten another memorable result against the champions.Guardiola’s team eventually found a way through, extending their winning run to eight matches in all competitions and six straight league victories. The result moved City one point clear of Arsenal, although the Gunners could reclaim top spot later in the day with a home win over Brighton.Before kick-off, Forest paid tribute to club legend John Robertson, who passed away on Christmas Day at the age of 72. The former Scotland winger was a central figure in Forest’s back-to-back European Cup triumphs in 1979 and 1980, and his flair and end product were fondly remembered by the City Ground crowd.Cherki, who joined City from Lyon in the summer, appears to share that same blend of creativity and cutting edge. At just 22, he has quickly become a key figure in Guardiola’s side and, should City edge Arsenal to the title, his contribution is likely to be pivotal.Guardiola had set a stern tone over the festive period, warning his players against excess and making it clear that fitness standards would not be compromised. He even cancelled a planned rest day after last weekend’s win over West Ham. When asked about his squad’s condition, Guardiola joked that he was the only one who had put on weight.Despite that discipline, City looked flat before the break and Forest had the better chances. Morgan Gibbs-White went close after meeting a Callum Hudson-Odoi cross, while City struggled to impose themselves. Erling Haaland, who has 19 league goals by Christmas, the joint-most at this stage in Premier League history, was largely kept quiet.The visitors finally found their rhythm just after the interval. Cherki drifted inside and slipped a clever pass to Reijnders, who finished calmly from 12 yards for City’s first shot on target. Cherki then tested goalkeeper John Victor with a fierce effort moments later.Forest responded swiftly. Reijnders lost possession near his own area, allowing Gibbs-White to release Igor Jesus, whose cross was drilled home by Hutchinson from close range. With City wobbling, Neco Williams forced Gianluigi Donnarumma into a save before Nicolo Savona blazed over from the rebound.The decisive moment arrived in the 83rd minute. A loose ball fell to Cherki just inside the box and the Frenchman lashed an unstoppable finish past Victor. He celebrated by mimicking Haaland’s trademark calm pose in front of the travelling supporters.It was a fitting end to a performance that highlighted why Cherki is fast becoming one of Guardiola’s most trusted match-winners as City continue their relentless pursuit of another Premier League crown.",Manchester City beat Nottingham Forest 2-1 at the City Ground. Tijjani Reijnders opened the scoring before Omari Hutchinson equalised. Rayan Cherki scored the winner in the 83rd minute.

"AIFF proposes 20-season ISL framework under new model, February start possible",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/aiff-proposes-20-season-isl-framework-under-new-model-february-start-possible/articleshow/126192296.cms,"AIFF

The All India Football Federation (AIFF) on Friday proposed a new structure for the Indian Super League (ISL), under which the league would be owned and operated by the national body in accordance with its new constitution for the next 20 seasons.According to the new proposal the AIFF formulated after a meeting with the ISL clubs, the league will implement a promotion and relegation system from the upcoming season. Each season will be calculated from June 1 to May 31 of the next year.""We have sent the proposal to the clubs, we have to wait for their response in the next couple of days before finalising our plan,"" an AIFF source told PTI.""Let the clubs respond, we will try to find a solution after hearing them.""It is expected that the AIFF and the clubs will have two more rounds of meetings -- one on Sunday and the other on Monday.If all goes well, the ISL season may start in the first week of February, according to the source.According to the proposal, the ISL will have a predetermined 'Central Operational Budget' for every year that would come from yearly contributions from all 'revenue share holders' proportionate to their revenue share in the league.""This would be known as the 'League Membership Contribution'. Any operational expenses required for the league to be conducted and for clubs to comply with their applicable licensing criteria with the addition of prize money distribution would be capped and borne out of this budget,"" the proposal said.""Governance would be overseen by a Board that would be empowered by the AIFF general body with certain operational autonomy over commercial matters of the League. The jurisdiction of the board would be limited to the utilisation of unrestricted funds within the yearly operational budget earmarked for the same.""Each club, under the proposal, will pay the AIFF a 'standard participating fee' of Rs 1 crore a year at the beginning of the season. This would, however, be independent of any calculations of the 'Central Operating Expenditure'.""This amount would be fully reimbursable from the central revenue prior to distribution of 'Net Revenue'. The total participation fee for all clubs would be put at 20% of the 'central operational budget' of the League. In case the Board decides to raise the 'central operational budget' by 10% in the future, the 'standard participation fee' would proportionately increase.""Any profit, or savings from the operational budget, will be distributed equally amongst all revenue shareholders in proportion to the respective revenue shares.On December 20, a proposal from 10 ISL clubs for ""perpetual"" operational and commercial ownership of the country's top-tier competition failed to get the approval of the AIFF's General Body, which formed a committee to look into the matter.The AIFF panel was tasked with holding discussions with representatives of five clubs - Chennaiyin FC, Mumbai City FC, Delhi Sporting Club, NorthEast United FC and Mohun Bagan Super Giant from December 22 to 29.Under the AIFF's proposal, the total outlay of the first season of the ISL will be Rs 70 crore with the AIFF's revenue share pegged at 10 per cent (that is Rs 7 crore) in the first season, while 50 per cent (Rs 35 crore) will come from the clubs -- 14 as of now unless there is any pull out.But interestingly, a revenue share of 30 per cent has been reserved for a potential commercial partner. The AIFF is yet to get a commercial partner as it did not receive any bid after a tender was floated on the supervision of a Supreme Court-appointed committee under a retired SC judge.Though the AIFF has included a 30 per cent revenue share for a potential commercial partner in the proposal, it is learnt that since the number of matches this season could be less than earlier years, the ISL can be run with a 'central operating budget' of less than the proposed Rs 70 crore.",The All India Football Federation (AIFF) has proposed a new structure for the Indian Super League (ISL) The league would be owned and operated by the national body in accordance with its new constitution for the next 20 seasons.

RABAT: Organisers at the Africa Cup of Nations in Morocco are allowing supporters in for free after kick-off in matches where stadiums are not full, a Confederation of African Football source told AFP.The Group F game between Cameroon and Gabon on Wednesday in Agadir kicked off in front of almost empty stands but the ground filled up significantly over the course of the first half despite incessant rain.The official attendance was later announced as 35,200 inside a venue which can hold over 45,000.There have been similar scenes at numerous matches across the opening days of the competition, even leading to confusion over the attendance figures themselves.The crowd at Tuesday's Group D encounter between the Democratic Republic of Congo and Benin at Rabat's Al Medina Stadium -- which filled up considerably over the course of the game -- was initially announced as 6,703 before later being corrected to 13,073.The CAF source indicated that organisers, in agreement with African football's governing body, were opening stands around 20 minutes into games to allow fans gathered outside to enter without paying.Filling stadiums is an important issue for Cup of Nations organisers in Morocco, for which a successful hosting of the tournament is key as it builds towards the 2030 World Cup to be jointly held in the North African country, Spain and Portugal.CAF's official ticketing platform on Thursday showed seats available for almost all remaining group matches for prices starting at 100 dirhams ($10.96).The only matches shown as sell-outs were hosts Morocco's games against Mali on Friday and Zambia on Monday, as well as Algeria against Burkina Faso on Sunday and Algeria versus Equatorial Guinea next Wednesday.","Africa Cup of Nations organisers are allowing supporters in for free after kick- off in matches where stadiums are not full.

Where did it all go wrong for Indian football?

FC Goa players made a strong statement during their AFC Champions League 2 match against FC Istiklol by staging a silent protest before kick-off on Wednesday at the Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium.As the referee blew the whistle for kick-off, the FC Goa players staged the pre-planned protest and did not play for a few seconds.The protest was aimed at highlighting the “deepening uncertainty” that is affecting the Indian football ecosystem.Issues related to administration and commercial matters have caused major delays around top-tier domestic football competitions like the Indian Super League and the I-League.Players, coaches, and staff across clubs are feeling the impact of this situation.Soon after the incident, FC Goa released a statement on social media to explain their action.“This action was solely intended to draw attention to the broader challenges facing the domestic football ecosystem,” the club said in an official statement.FC Goa also made it clear that the protest was not against their opponents or the Asian Football Confederation.Instead, it was meant to show the frustration and concern felt by those involved in Indian football, who are unsure about the future of the game in the country.On the field, FC Goa started well despite the tense backdrop. The home team took the lead in the eighth minute when Dejan Drazic found space inside the box and scored with a fine curling shot into the top corner.In the second half, Istiklol made a strong comeback.

Lionel Messi India trip: Mumbai out in numbers for the superstar





No takers for game





Court hearings, President's appeal, sports ministry intervention





Women and juniors shine

NEW DELHI: Indian football remained in a state of terminal decline after experiencing arguably its darkest phase in a year marked by severe administrative crisis, court hearings, financial issues, absence of domestic leagues, and a steep decline in performance of the senior men's team.As the year drew to a close, the high-profile Lionel Messi GOAT India Tour generated some interest and forced a conversation around the sport.The much-publicised event did what it was meant to, and was not supposed to serve as a catalyst for real improvement in Indian football.If its own problems were not enough, the chaos and absolute disorder at Salt Lake Stadium on the first day of the Messi tour added to the embarrassment.While the breakdown of law and order in the 'Mecca of Indian football' was not good advertisement, the remaining three legs in Hyderabad, Mumbai and Delhi were well organised.Of the many disappointments, one on-field moment that still stings came when little-known Bangladeshi midfielder Sheikh Morsalin darted into the box and slipped the ball between the legs of Gurpreet Singh Sandhu with a delicate touch, completing another round of humiliation.The 11th minute strike, in an inconsequential 2027 AFC Asian Cup qualifying match on a November evening in Dhaka, meant the Indian senior men's team suffered its first defeat to Bangladesh in 22 years, after having struggled through the last 12 months to produce a result of any significance.While several factors contribute to a country's overall football ecosystem, globally the senior team's performance is often the most visible metric, and India was found severely wanting on that front.Unlike in 2024, when the team drew a blank in international matches, the Indian senior men's side did manage to churn out a few wins occasionally this year, including a bronze medal finish at the CAFA Nations Cup in the central Asian countries of Tajikistan and Uzbekistan in September.But, in the matches that mattered the most, India failed to deliver and could not qualify for the Asian Cup for the first time since the 2011 edition, following which the team plummeted further in the FIFA rankings.Besides Bangladesh, the team also suffered defeats to other lower-ranked opponents such as Hong Kong and Singapore, a 1-2 loss to whom dashed its hopes of entering the Asian Cup following a disappointing campaign in the Qualifications.While the men's team struggled on the field, especially when it came to scoring goals, the administrators grappled with issues off it.The game remained in the middle of a crisis due to the All India Football Federation's failure to secure a new commercial partner for the Indian Super League after its previous contract with the Reliance-owned Football Sports Development Limited (FSDL) expired on December 8.On expected lines, the lack of a commercial partner has had a crippling effect on the game. The ISL, which would have been into its third month now under normal circumstances, remains on hold.The sponsors are pulling out, clubs have put their operations on hold, players are staring at an uncertain future, after having implored each and every stakeholder to resolve the issue, and serious doubts hover over the domestic leagues' future.The ongoing crisis has highlighted a systemic failure in the country's football ecosystem brought about by poor governance, lack of long-term vision and the absence of proper youth development programmes.The year was also marked by frequent hearings at the Supreme Court and intervention from the union sports ministry to resolve the crisis. Even President Droupadi Murmu asked the stakeholders of Indian football to work together for the upliftment of the game in the country, reflecting the severity of the situation.When the Supreme Court approved the draft Constitution of the AIFF, prepared by former apex court judge L Nageswara Rao, in September, it was believed that a solution amenable to all concerned parties would finally be arrived at.However, no such thing happened in the ensuing months.Amid the gloom surrounding the sport, the women's national teams and the junior squads have impressed with their performances, raising hopes of a better future. In Chiang Mai, Thailand in July, the women's team scripted history by qualifying directly for the AFC Women's Asian Cup 2026, a feat never achieved before.Up against regional heavyweights and hosts Thailand in the final, the Indian women rode on Sangita Basfore's brilliant brace to emerge winners and make a statement of sorts. The achievement reminded one of former AIFF president Praful Patel's old statement that chances of the Indian women's team playing in a FIFA World Cup before their male counterparts are higher.While the girls still have a long way to go, they are definitely moving in the right direction.In another milestone, Indian Women's League reigning champions East Bengal FC became the first team from the country to win a main-draw match in the AFC Women's Champions League, helping the side earn a direct spot in the league stages of the next edition.As far as the junior teams were concerned, the India squad lifted its seventh SAFF U-17 Championship title in Sri Lanka, edging out Bangladesh in a dramatic final that went to penalties after a 2-2 stalemate.Under the guidance of Bibiano Fernandes, India then shocked continental giants Iran 2-1 to qualify for their 10th U-17 Asian Cup finals, even as the struggle to monetise the sport continued without a solution in sight.",Indian football remained in a state of terminal decline after experiencing arguably its darkest phase in a year marked by severe administrative crisis.

Who is Julie Hampton Cousins ?



Kirk Cousins has never treated football as the only defining part of his life, and that balance has shaped the quarterback he is today. From early career pressure to headline contracts and a new chapter in Atlanta, his journey has been grounded by something deeply personal. For Cousins, commitment does not stop at the locker room door. It travels with him onto the field, stitched quietly into every snap he takes.That belief has been visible for years, sometimes in the smallest detail. Wearing his wedding ring during NFL games became a symbol of pride rather than habit. “My wife’s been a huge supporter to me, and I want people not to be afraid of marriage but to be excited about it,” he said after a team workout in 2016, according to USA Today. The gesture reflects how central family has been throughout his 13-year career.Cousins built his reputation in Washington between 2012 and 2017 before resetting the market with a three-year, $84 million deal with the Minnesota Vikings in 2018. The spotlight followed him again in 2023 when he opened his life to fans on Netflix’s Quarterback. Season 2, set to release July 8, picks up after his departure from Minnesota and his four-year contract with the Atlanta Falcons, revealing how change feels behind closed doors.Through every transition, his wife Julie has remained a steady presence.Julie Hampton Cousins grew up far from NFL noise in Alpharetta, Georgia, where she was raised by her parents Sue and Michael alongside her two older brothers, Scott and Steve. She later attended the University of Georgia, building a life rooted in education and service. Her path crossed with Kirk’s in 2012 through a mutual family friend, according to The Washington Post, beginning a relationship that moved quietly but with intention.Kirk proposed in November 2013 in a moment filled with nerves and surprise. “I was extremely nervous,” he told the outlet. “On the way down driving the car, as we got close to the Capitol building, I was holding her hand and she goes, ‘Why are your hands cold and sweaty?’ I said, ‘I don’t know,’ but I knew it was because I was super nervous.” They married on June 28, 2014, in Atlanta.Julie, a former elementary school teacher, now helps lead the Julie & Kirk Cousins Foundation, supporting organizations like Boys and Girls Clubs of America and International Justice Mission. Together, they are raising two sons, Cooper and Turner, while managing philanthropy, family life, and even business ventures like purchasing Clearbrook Golf Course in Michigan. Their story shows how partnership can anchor success, even at football’s highest level.Also Read: Where is Brittani?

Is Drake London playing tonight vs. Rams? Latest injury status for Falcons WR,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/is-drake-london-playing-tonight-vs-rams-latest-injury-status-for-falcons-wr/articleshow/126241851.cms,"Drake London injury update (Imagn Images)

Is Drake London playing tonight?



Drake London enters Week 17 with more questions than certainty, yet his presence alone shifts the mood around the Atlanta Falcons. The season has slipped away from playoff hopes, but individual battles still matter. London’s knee has been the biggest obstacle, interrupting what once looked like a steady scoring rhythm. With six touchdowns already logged, the quiet stretch since Week 10 has only sharpened focus on his status. Monday night against the Rams is less about standings and more about whether Atlanta’s top receiver can reclaim momentum.For the Falcons, this matchup carries a subtle edge. Playing spoiler can still define character, especially against a Los Angeles team chasing NFC positioning. London’s return last week offered a glimpse rather than a statement. Limited yards, limited snaps, but a meaningful step forward. The question hovering all week was never about talent. It was about trust in the knee and confidence from the coaching staff.Yes, and that confirmation brings clarity. The Falcons listed Drake London as active for Week 17, easing concerns that lingered after his questionable tag. He practiced in a limited role all week, yet that steady participation marked progress.The team’s final inactive list did not include him, signaling faith in his readiness despite caution around workload.Head coach Raheem Morris helped set expectations earlier in the week. “Falcons head coach Raheem Morris said he feels ‘great’ about wide receiver Drake London playing Monday against the Rams, even though he’s listed as questionable on the game report,” Terrin Waack reported on X. Those words carried weight, especially given London’s recent four-game absence.Atlanta ruled out seven players elsewhere on the roster, but London was not one of them. That decision matters because his impact extends beyond box scores. When healthy, he draws coverage, opens lanes, and changes defensive priorities. Even if the knee limits explosiveness, his presence forces adjustments.London’s November stretch remains a reminder of his ceiling. Three games, all losses, yet over 100 receiving yards each time. That production fueled belief he could anchor the offense down the stretch. Injury delayed that plan, not erased it.Against a Rams defense missing Davante Adams on the opposite sideline, the stage is set differently. Atlanta may lean on balance, but London’s routes will be watched closely. This game is not about saving a season. It is about testing durability, restoring rhythm, and closing the year with purpose.Also Read: Drake Maye’s wife Ann Michael steals the spotlight with bold winter game-day look as Patriots clinch AFC East","Atlanta Falcons wide receiver Drake London was listed as questionable for Monday's game against the Rams.

Antonio Brown sparks comeback chatter while Steelers face season-defining playoff pressure amid legal trouble,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/antonio-brown-sparks-comeback-chatter-while-steelers-face-season-defining-playoff-pressure-amid-legal-trouble/articleshow/126240948.cms,"Antonio Brown has reignited NFL comeback speculation by suggesting he could help the Pittsburgh Steelers, who are battling inconsistency as the AFC playoff race tightens. Despite not playing since 2022, Brown continues to lobby for a return. However, strained ties with the team and unresolved legal issues make any reunion highly unlikely.

Antonio Brown reignites Steelers comeback talk

Antonio Brown never stays out of the NFL conversation for long. Even with his playing days seemingly behind him and serious legal questions still unresolved, the former All Pro wide receiver has once again pushed himself into the spotlight. As the AFC playoff picture tightens and Pittsburgh fights to stay alive, Brown’s sudden message has reopened an old and complicated chapter in Steelers history.Timing is everything in football, and Brown knows it. Pittsburgh’s offense has flashed promise but continues to stumble when pressure rises. With Week 18 looming and little margin for error, his comments have landed in the middle of a tense moment for a franchise searching for answers and stability.Brown’s message was simple, direct, and impossible to ignore. “84 Could help #Steelers,” he posted, instantly stirring debate across the league. It was not just nostalgia talking. The Steelers have struggled to find rhythm, especially after a frustrating loss where scoring opportunities vanished and execution fell apart late.This is not the first time Brown has floated the idea of returning. He previously revealed that conversations with Aaron Rodgers took place earlier this year.Those talks never turned into action, but Brown has kept the door open publicly and loudly. He doubled down with another post that left no room for confusion. “Offer still out there to come back and play for the Steelers for free to finish the season,” he wrote.From a football perspective, the idea is tempting. Brown understands the system, the city, and the pressure that comes with wearing black and gold. But football is only part of the equation. His relationship with head coach Mike Tomlin remains strained, and the silence from the organization speaks volumes. When asked about Brown’s offer, Tomlin chose to walk away rather than engage.Off the field, the situation grows heavier. Brown is facing serious legal proceedings tied to an alleged shooting incident earlier this year. He was arrested, released on bond, and is currently monitored while awaiting further legal action. That reality makes any return highly unlikely.For now, Brown’s words remain just that. Pittsburgh must decide whether consistency comes from looking forward or reopening a chapter it once worked hard to close.Also Read: Antonio Brown’s attempted murder case becomes political as supporters claim he’s being targeted for being “MAGA”","Antonio Brown has reignited NFL comeback speculation by suggesting he could help the Pittsburgh Steelers.

Sherrone Moore scandal deepens as five women come forward with detailed accounts of troubling interactions,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/sherrone-moore-scandal-deepens-as-five-women-come-forward-with-detailed-accounts-of-troubling-interactions/articleshow/126233125.cms,"Sherrone Moore’s scandal has widened as five women described uncomfortable interactions that surfaced amid his ongoing legal case. While the accounts do not allege criminal conduct, they add context to concerns about his behavior before his firing from Michigan. Moore has pleaded not guilty to criminal charges, and his attorney maintains the case will be decided by evidence, not speculation.

Sherrone Moore scandal expands with new accounts and legal response

Sherrone Moore became the center of a growing controversy as new accounts surfaced during an already turbulent period for the former Michigan head coach. What began as an internal issue has now widened into a public reckoning, with fresh details adding complexity to a case that continues to unfold in court and in the court of public opinion.In recent days, multiple reports have shifted the focus beyond the initial arrest and firing. Five women have now described uncomfortable interactions with Moore over several years. Their accounts do not allege criminal behavior, but they paint a picture of conduct that raised concerns long before his tenure collapsed. Together, these claims deepen questions about judgment, boundaries, and leadership at one of college football’s most prominent programs.According to a report by The Athletic, the women spoke anonymously and described awkward online exchanges dating back as far as five years. One woman said Moore sent her direct messages on November 1, the day Michigan defeated Purdue, and she initially believed the account was fake.Others recalled repeated reactions to Instagram stories, often using fire emojis or clapping hands, followed by messages like “How did we start following each other” despite Moore initiating contact.One exchange stood out for its tone. Moore allegedly offered to fly a woman to Michigan. When she asked whether she would be “holed up in some hotel,” he reportedly replied, “I guess we will have to see ! I would say yes but you would also have a driver haha. We will go into that detail later.” The report also described erratic behavior in the days leading up to his firing, including emotional breakdowns during staff meetings.Moore was arrested in December after allegedly entering the apartment of his executive assistant, Paige Shiver, hours after being dismissed for an inappropriate relationship with a staff member. He faces charges including breaking and entering, home invasion, and stalking. He has pleaded not guilty and was released on a $25,000 bond after two nights in jail.His attorney, Ellen Michaels, addressed the allegations directly, stating, “Sherrone Moore denies any criminal wrongdoing. There is no history of domestic violence, no prior adjudication supporting claims of dangerous conduct, and no judicial determination validating these allegations. This matter will be decided in court based on evidence and due process, not speculation.”Moore has not spoken publicly since his arrest. Michigan, meanwhile, continues to feel the fallout, with staff departures and interim leadership guiding the program into its bowl game. As legal proceedings move forward, the broader implications for accountability and trust in college athletics remain firmly in focus.Also Read: Was Paige Shiver hired to expose Sherrone Moore?

Commentary from Shannon Sharpe reframed the split around emotional absence rather than money, suggesting time and connection mattered more. Years later, their breakup feels less like celebrity drama and more like a reminder of the personal cost of relentless ambition.

Tom Brady and Gisele Bündchen divorce highlights emotional cost of success

Since their high-profile breakup, Tom Brady and Gisele Bündchen have been picked apart in public conversations, yet the deeper discussion around their divorce continues to shift even years after the headlines faded. The split still sparks debate today because it challenges a familiar belief: that success, fame, and financial comfort automatically lead to personal happiness.The divorce, finalized in 2022, marked the end of one of the most influential and closely watched partnerships in the worlds of sports and fashion. Although both have been on the offensive publicly, the candid considerations by former NFL star Shannon Sharpe revived the debate.His comments struck a chord because they framed the breakup not around scandal, but around emotional absence, timing, and unmet expectations that money simply cannot fix.Speaking on his Club Shay Shay podcast, Sharpe questioned the assumption that wealth alone sustains a marriage. “I think the problem with Tom is he's probably thinking, 'I've got all this money, why does she need to do that?' No, she's got all this money, and yet he still couldn't please his ex,” Sharpe said. The quote landed hard because it stripped away celebrity privilege and exposed something universal.Sharpe went further, suggesting that emotional availability may have mattered more than status.“Maybe she wanted time. Maybe she wanted attention. I don't know what she wanted. Tom seems to be happy,” he added. His co-host Andrew summed it up bluntly: “Oh, yeah, because they don't want money.” The exchange highlighted a truth many couples face quietly, often too late.Since the divorce, Brady has leaned into broadcasting and his ownership role with the Las Vegas Raiders. Bündchen, meanwhile, rebuilt her life away from the NFL spotlight, later welcoming a child with Joaquim Valente while continuing to raise her two children with Brady. Sharpe’s final thought echoed the lingering regret that follows many long marriages: “This was probably happening right under my nose.”With hindsight, the Brady Bündchen split feels less shocking and more instructive. It reminds readers that ambition can coexist with love, but only when time, effort, and emotional presence are not treated as optional.Also Read: Tom Brady may have moved forward, but Gisele Bündchen’s presence lives on as their daughter becomes her striking lookalike","Tom Brady and Gisele Bündchen divorce highlights emotional cost of success.

Justin Herbert benched for Chargers’ final regular-season game vs. Denver

The Los Angeles Chargers have officially confirmed that quarterback Justin Herbert will not start in Week 18 against the Denver Broncos, head coach Jim Harbaugh announced on Monday. With the AFC West already locked up by Denver and the Chargers safely in the playoff picture, the team is prioritizing player health and playoff preparation over finishing the regular season with starters on the field. Backup quarterbacks will take over, giving Herbert a chance to rest and focus on the postseason.Harbaugh told reporters that Herbert will sit this Sunday, citing strategy and playoff preparation as the main reasons. NFL insider Adam Schefter confirmed Harbaugh’s statement on X, emphasizing that the decision was a planned, strategic move rather than a reaction to an unexpected setback.With Herbert out, the Chargers will rely on backup quarterbacks Gardner Minshew and Chris Oladokun. Minshew has experience leading the offense in relief this season, while Oladokun has seen limited snaps but has been preparing in practice for situations like this. Chargers fans can expect a slightly different offensive approach, focusing on safe passing plays, shorter throws, and heavy involvement from the running game to protect the backups.Resting starters in late-season games has become a common strategy across the NFL, and for the Chargers, the Week 18 matchup has minimal impact on playoff seeding.With the AFC West title already out of reach and a wild-card berth secured, protecting key players including Herbert, Travis Kelce, and other starters, is a priority. The decision ensures that the team enters the playoffs healthy and ready for high-stakes matchups.By sitting Week 18, Herbert avoids unnecessary risk and gets additional recovery time ahead of the postseason. This rest could make a noticeable difference in his mobility, arm strength, and overall performance in the playoffs. Chargers fans will be watching closely, knowing that Herbert’s health is critical to the team’s championship hopes.Justin Herbert will sit out Week 18 against the Broncos, a move confirmed by Jim Harbaugh and backed by strategic playoff planning. While the Chargers will rely on backups for the final game of the regular season, the focus is squarely on ensuring Herbert is fresh, healthy, and ready to lead the team in the playoffs. Fans can now look forward to seeing the star QB return fully charged when it really matters.Also read - Lamar Jackson injury update: Ravens QB status uncertain for Week 18 vs. Steelers","Justin Herbert will not start for the Los Angeles Chargers in Week 18 against the Denver Broncos.

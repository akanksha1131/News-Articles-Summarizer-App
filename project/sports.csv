Pakistan may pull out of ICC Champions Trophy: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/pakistan-may-pull-out-of-icc-champions-trophy-report/articleshow/115197697.cms,"India's refusal to travel to Pakistan for the Champions Trophy next year may trigger a strong response from the Pakistan government that may ask its cricket board to withdraw from the tournament, according to a report in 'Dawn'.The International Cricket Council ( ICC ) has written to the Pakistan Cricket Board ( PCB ), informing them about the Board of Control for Cricket in India's ( BCCI ) decision that the Indian team won't travel to Pakistan for the tournament, which is scheduled to be played from February 19 to March 9, 2025.The Champions Trophy, which is making its return to the ICC calendar after 2017, could be turned into a 'hybrid' model, with India playing all their matches at a different venue, most likely in the UAE, while the rest of the tournament is hosted by Pakistan.The report states that the PCB chairman, Mohsin Naqvi, has ""ruled out the possibility"" of a hybrid model, which could force the ICC to move the entire tournament out of Pakistan.That may lead to Pakistan pulling out of the Champions Trophy.""In such a case, one of the options the government is mulling is that of asking the PCB to ensure Pakistan don’t participate in the Champions Trophy,"" the report quoted its source.Naqvi is also an interior minister in the country's federal government.India and Pakistan have not played any bilateral series since 2012, but continued to face off in ICC tournaments, including the ODI World Cup last year in India.Notably, the Asia Cup hosted by Pakistan last year was also turned into a hybrid model after India refused to play in Pakistan.

'I am not facing any heat': Coach Gautam Gambhir

MUMBAI: Despite his recent slump in form, India's head coach Gautam Gambhir is backing seasoned campaigner KL Rahul to open in the first Test of the highly anticipated Border-Gavaskar series in Australia if skipper Rohit Sharma is unavailable for the opener in Perth due to personal reasons.Rohit has not travelled with the team, leading to speculations over his availability for the first Test in Perth, which will begin on November 22. According to reliable sources, Virat Kohli travelled to Australia a day earlier than the rest of the team, while vice-captain Jasprit Bumrah flew Down Under with family on Monday night. The rest of the Indian team travelled to Australia in two separate batches on Nov 10 & 11.Speaking at a pre-departure media interaction on Monday morning, attended by a handful of journalists, Gambhir hoped that the captain would be available for the series opener, even though there is no confirmation yet. ""At the moment, there is no confirmation. We will let you know what the situation will be. Hopefully, he will be available. But you will get to know everything at the start of the series,"" Gambhir said while clarifying that Bumrah will lead the side in Rohit's absence. ""Bumrah is vice-captain; if Rohit is not available, he's going to lead in Perth.""The head coach, however, clarified that there are sufficient options and a contingency plan in place if Rohit is unavailable in Perth. ""We have (Abhimanyu) Easwaran and KL (Rahul) there, so we will take a call closer to the first Test if Rohit is not available,"" Gambhir said.Rahul has endured below-par performances of late and was dropped from the remainder of the home Test series against New Zealand after getting out for scores of 0 &12 in the first Test against New Zealand in Bengaluru. Sent to Australia a bit earlier along with 'keeper-bat Dhruv Jurel for some game time, he failed to utilise the opportunity, managing to score just 14 runs (4 & 10) in India A's unofficial Test against Australia A in Melbourne last week.However, Gambhir backed the batter to come good. ""KL Rahul can bat in the top order, he can bat at No. 3, he can play at No. 6. So, you need quite a lot of talent to do all these jobs, and he has kept in ODIs. Imagine how many countries have players like KL, who can open, can bat at No. 6 as well,"" the coach said, adding: ""If needed, he can do the job for us, especially if Rohit is not available for the first Test match.""","Gautam Gambhir backs KL Rahul to open in the first Test of the Border-Gavaskar series in Australia if skipper Rohit Sharma is unavailable.

'I am not facing any heat': Coach Gautam Gambhir

'Transition or not, seniors are hungry to succeed'

MUMBAI: Despite their recent slump in form, India's head coach Gautam Gambhir is standing firmly behind veterans, skipper Rohit Sharma and star batter Virat Kohli , whose places in the team have come under scrutiny.As India prepared to leave for Australia for the much anticipated Border-Gavaskar Trophy-a five-Test series for the first time since 1991-92- Gambhir, in characteristic style, fired back at Australian legend Ricky Ponting for questioning Kohli's form and place in the Indian team, suggesting Ponting should focus on cricket in his country.Ponting had voiced concerns about Kohli's prolonged slump, noting that the great batter has scored only two Test centuries in the last five years. Nonetheless, Ponting also backed the former India captain to roar back to form against Australia in Australia, given that he loves playing against the Aussies, and has a great record in Australia.""What does Ponting have to do with Indian cricket?"" Gambhir questioned during a media interaction on Monday. ""I think he should think about Australian cricket. More importantly, I have got no concerns whatsoever for Virat and Rohit.""Kohli has averaged merely 22.72 in six matches in 2024, the lowest in his career. The 36-year-old has scored just one fifty this year - 70 against New Zealand in the second innings of the first Test at Bengaluru, while his last Test century came in July 2023 against the West Indies. Kohli scored 93, and Rohit 91 runs in the India's humiliating 0-3 Test series loss to New Zealand at home.When asked if the senior batters' poor form is a concern, Gambhir was quick to reply, ""Not at all."" ""They are incredibly tough men. They have achieved a lot for Indian cricket, and they will continue to achieve a lot in future as well. For me, the most important thing is that they still work really hard, and they are still passionate, they still want to achieve a lot more and that is something which is very important,"" he stressed.As a head coach, Gambhir is bound to have a sense of deja vu as he boards the flight to Australia. He was a part of a team full of veteran players, which crumbled and went through a complete transition after the high of the 2011 World Cup with a new coach Duncan Fletcher in charge.Asked if he was feeling the pressure like Fletcher, Gambhir replied: ""I am not thinking about transition but the five Tests. Transition or no transition, if that has to happen, will happen but I see some incredibly tough characters in that dressing room who are hungry to do well. The only thing in my mind is, we are going to Australia to play five Test matches.""Batting continuously for senior pros Rohit and Kohli , the former India opener said it was the media which was obsessed with the word ""transition"".""You guys can keep talking about the transition and all that stuff. For me, they are still very hungry. I am sure they have got a lot of fire to achieve a lot of success for the nation and you should never doubt their passion for the country,"" Gambhir said.Reflecting on his own career values, Gambhir said, ""I've told them to put the team above personal milestones."" When asked if he felt pressure following India's recent home defeat to New Zealand, Gambhir replied, ""What difference does it make? Tell me, social media, what difference does it make in my life and for that matter, anyone's life?Gambhir made it clear that when he accepted the job, he was aware that coaching India would not be an easy task.""When I took up this job, I always thought that it was going to be a highly difficult job and highly prestigious job as well. I don't think as if I am feeling the heat because my job is to be absolutely honest and there are some incredibly tough people in that dressing room who have achieved some great things for the country and will continue to achieve some great things for the country. It is an absolute honour to be coaching them and coaching India,"" he said.Gambhir admitted that he was open to the criticism following the New Zealand series loss, saying he's ""ready to accept it with both hands.""However, he expressed confidence in India's ability to tackle Australia's fast and bouncy tracks. ""We don't control what wickets they give. It is their wish, whatever they want to dish us with. We are absolutely ready to play in any kind of conditions and we have got all the bases (covered) out. What difference does it make whether they give us a turning track or bouncy tracks or green wickets?""",Head coach Gautam Gambhir says he is not facing any heat from media. Says he has 'no concerns whatsoever' for Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma. Says it was the media which was obsessed with the word 'transition',"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115198426,imgsize-85072,width-400,resizemode-4/115198426.jpg"

Facing a new bowler can be a slight challenge to just pick up their action.“I've got a whole week before I head off to Perth so I can get mentally ready and I guess it starts now in preparation to hopefully start really well.“But there’s probably not (much you can do to replicate how Bumrah bowls).“Obviously he's got a unique action, he's one of the best bowlers in the world, so it's going to be hard to mimic that, that's for sure.“I'm just looking forward to all of that and I can't wait.”McSweeney is currently the fifth highest run-scorer Australia's domestic competition and earned his place in the side after solid performances during the 'A' matches against India.McSweeney feels that he has ben batting really well in the recent past and is looking to grab the opportunity with both hands in the series against India.“In the last month or so I really feel like I'm batting the best I ever have,” McSweeney said.“I think I'm the best I've ever been prepared to take this opportunity, so hopefully I can do that.“No doubt there's plenty of learning and experiences that I haven't experienced yet and I'm looking forward to learning all about the challenges of Test cricket and challenging my game against the very best.“There’s plenty of learning to go and plenty of improvement I hope, but I definitely feel like this is the best I’ve played and I’m ready for the challenge.”The first Test Border-Gavaskar Trophy starts from November 22 in Perth.",Australia's Nathan McSweeney is likely to make his debut in the Perth Test against India.

NEW DELHI: Cricket Australia and the broadcasters have been criticised for giving precedence to the upcoming five-Test series against India over the recent ODI series against Pakistan, according to Pakistan's head coach Jason Gillespie Pakistan registered a historic 2-1 victory in the series, marking their first ODI series win in Australia since 2002.Head coach Gillespie expressed disappointment regarding the lack of publicity for the Pakistan ODI series.""To be honest, I pretty much saw no promotion of our one-day series by Cricket Australia, which was a bit of a surprise. It's pretty obvious that they're prioritising the Border-Gavaskar Trophy Test series against India because I saw no promotion of this series,"" Gillespie was quoted as saying by the""Fox do a great job promoting, but it was pretty clear to us where CA's priorities lie. That's their prerogative and their decision, but I just didn't see any advertising, and promotion of this one-day series at all.""The fact it was behind the paywall as well probably limited the amount of advertising and interest in the series. The timing of it ... it's really difficult for administrators to schedule all the cricket in. But it has felt from Pakistan's perspective that based on selections and promotion of the series that their priorities have been India. Everyone can see that, it's pretty obvious.""He also said Pakistan were aware Australia would have a much-changed lineup in Perth with Pat Cummins, Josh Hazlewood, Mitchell Starc, Steve Smith, and Marnus Labuschagne all rested.""We knew that there was probably going to be some change, knowing what Australia have coming up. You always thought at the back of your mind were they going to send the big quicks over to Perth to play one 50-over game.""We anticipated that, and that's the nature of modern cricket and it's up to selectors and coaches to manage their players as best they can. Australia chose to do that. It was pretty obvious that this three-match one-day series wasn't the highest of priorities for Australia.""All we can do as Pakistan is play against the opposition that's presented and we did that really well. It was pleasing not just to beat Australia but beat them pretty convincingly. The reality is we should have won the first game as well,"" elaborated Gillespie.The Indian squad will strive to secure an unprecedented third consecutive series victory in Australian conditions.India have previously claimed consecutive series victories in Australia—first under Virat Kohli’s captaincy in 2018-19, and then under Ajinkya Rahane in 2020-21.The series commences with the first Test in Perth on November 22, followed by a day-night encounter at Adelaide Oval from December 6 to 10.The competition moves to The Gabba in Brisbane for the third Test from December 14 to 18, before the traditional Boxing Day Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground from December 26 to 30.The concluding Test match is scheduled at Sydney, beginning on January 3.","Pakistan registered a historic 2-1 victory in the series, marking their first ODI series win in Australia since 2002.

The latest 'Beyond The Boundary' episode delved into the world of cricket league wars and their impact on player availability. Airing on November 11th, the episode welcomed a panel of experts to dissect this pressing issue.Host Chetan Narula guided the discussion, joined by Times of India's Sports Group Editor K Shriniwas Rao, esteemed English cricket journalist George Dobell, Australian cricket writer Jarrod Kimber, and Cricbuzz's USA correspondent Smit Patel.The panel provided an in-depth analysis of the current franchise cricket landscape. With lucrative league contracts on offer, top players are increasingly facing a dilemma – balancing national duty with these enticing opportunities. This new era presents a challenge for the sport, as commitments become increasingly divided.Key discussion points included the expanding international cricket calendar, the proliferation of leagues worldwide, and the ramifications for player availability. The panel also explored the financial implications for players, the phenomenon of players switching between leagues, and the implications for their status as cricketers.The governance of these leagues was also scrutinized, examining whether they operate with or without official sanction. The role of theInternational Cricket Council (ICC) in this evolving landscape was also a topic of debate, particularly its ability to effectively govern these leagues.K Shrinivas Rao said, ""Wherever there is consumption, the game is going into that direction, these leagues are sprouting and white ball format is disintegrating because there is some kind of consumption around the world where these kind of cricket is talked about""K Shrinivas Rao emphasised the relationship between the growth of leagues and the demand for them, highlighting the global consumption driving this trend. He suggested that the white-ball format's fragmentation stems from the worldwide interest and discussion surrounding these leagues.“BCCI and ECB have the right to run the league of their choice and their format, it is any cricket board's right to do the same and they are well within the right to think what will benefit them.” K Shrinivas Rao added.K Shrinivas Rao advocated for a democratic structure within cricket, affirming the right of cricketing boards like the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) and the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) to establish and manage leagues according to their preferences. He emphasized that every cricket board possesses the autonomy to determine what serves its best interests.""Law of the jungle is going to apply, where the fittest will survive and anything that is not fit enough to stay in the race will perish"" he added.Acknowledging the democratic nature of cricket and the concerns surrounding player availability, K Shrinivas Rao pondered the future direction of the sport. He predicted a scenario where only the most resilient entities, including players and formats, would thrive, while those unable to adapt would face elimination.The panel delved into the global consumption patterns of various T20 cricket leagues. They highlighted England's introduction of The Hundred as a prime example and acknowledged the emergence of T10 cricket as a testament to the sport's evolving landscape.Experts highlighted the increasing strain on the international cricket schedule due to the proliferation of leagues. They predict that this intense competition will favour the most adaptable and resilient players. In contrast, those unable to keep pace risk being left behind.Smit Patel highlighted that the USA hosts over seven cricket leagues, supporting more than 25 first-class cricketers who have relocated there. Some teams or clubs are offering annual salaries of USD 60,000 to USD 70,000 to these players to participate exclusively in these US-based leagues.",The latest 'Beyond The Boundary' episode delved into the world of cricket league wars and their impact on player availability.

A new era begins at Manchester United as Ruben Amorim becomes the latest coach to take on the challenge of reviving the storied English club.After more than a decade of on-field decline the 20-time English champion has turned to a 39-year-old Portuguese who has delivered trophies and a thrilling style of soccer to Sporting Lisbon , but takes over a club that has made a habit of wrecking even the biggest reputations.High-caliber managers have come and gone, more than $1 billion has been spent on player signings, yet United just can't seem to get it right.""If anybody knew the answer (for that), we wouldn't have had the last 10, 11 years,"" Andy George, a 40-year-old United fan from Worcestershire, told The Associated Press. ""I always back the manager ... but it needs to work now.""George said he had been a supporter for 30 years and traveled around 100 miles (160 kilometers) for last week's 2-0 win against PAOK in the Europa League.Proven winner Amorim - a former Portugal international - was Lisbon coach from 2020 and ended its 19-year wait for the Portuguese title in 2021. He won it again in 2024 and his achievements led to links with jobs at Liverpool , Manchester City and Barcelona before he was hired to replaceErik ten Hag at the start of the month.""I'm not naive, I know that it's going to be very different, very tough,"" Amorim said Sunday after his final game with Sporting. ""But I feel that I'm ready. I'm at peace now, I can focus on my new job.""He is United's sixth permanent coach since club great Alex Ferguson retired in 2013 after winning his 13th Premier League title. Ferguson won 28 major trophies, including two Champions Leagues, and his record has cast a shadow over all of his successors.David Moyes was the first to try to step into his shoes, lasted eight months and began what has been a cycle of hiring, firing and reboots in an attempt to return the club to its past glories.Since then United has gone through Champions League winners (Louis van Gaal and Jose Mourinho), an iconic former player (Ole Gunnar Solskjaer) and one of Europe's emerging coaching talents (Ten Hag), but has not been able to stop City from dominating English soccer, while Liverpool, Chelsea and even Leicester have lifted the title in that time.High expectations United hopes Amorim will be the man to finally break the cycle.""We cannot ignore how he has changed Sporting,"" United midfielder Casemiro said Sunday. ""We know that Sporting won many titles, changed the club with titles, with trophies. He has already proved that he is a coach that has won a lot.""Amorim made a spectacular statement even before officially taking up his new role when, while serving out his notice at Lisbon, his team routed City 4-1 in the Champions League last week.""I was like, 'Oh, my gosh!' I lost my mind,"" said Joshua Hanley, a United fan from Kansas City who had flown to England to watch the PAOK game. ""We were changing airplanes and I'm sitting there kind of watching the score on my phone.""It was a fantastic start.""Amorim joked that he would be considered the new Ferguson if he beat City.Hanley's expectations are more modest to begin with.""If we can make top six, it would be a fantastic end of the season,"" he said, adding that he wants Amorim to ""make football exciting again"".New structure Amorim is the first head coach hired since British billionaire Jim Ratcliffe became a minority owner of United in February, assumed control of soccer operations and installed a new leadership team as part of his overhaul.Chief exectuive Omar Berrada was lured from City and sporting director Dan Ashworth came from Newcastle. Dave Brailsford, who helped Britain become a global force in cycling, is a director on United's soccer board.While Ten Hag was given a contract extension following an end of season review in the summer, he was appointed under a former regime. United's woeful start to the campaign - losing four of its opening nine league games - ultimately cost him.Amorim has the benefit of being chosen by United's new hierarchy and the final piece of leadership team assembled by Ratcliffe, which should afford him time implement his plans.Ambition Not that he is likely to get a free pass this season. The timing of the decision to fire Ten Hag could be considered instructive in terms of United's ambition.There have only been 11 rounds of the league campaign and Amorim takes over a team that, although 13th in the standings, is only four points off third place. It also remains in three cup competitions.Champions League qualification remains very much in play and after United spent around $230 million on transfers in the offseason, Amorim will be expected to quickly deliver winning soccer to a club that has been playing catchup for too long.In the long term, the challenge is to return United to the summit of English and European soccer - a task that has proved beyond any of his last five predecessors.",Ruben Amorim becomes Manchester United's sixth permanent coach since Alex Ferguson retired in 2013.

The match witnessed an early goal from Hugo Boumous in the fourth minute, while Manvir Singh found the equaliser for the visitors in the 36th, keeping the spectators engaged throughout the 90 minutes.Mohun Bagan had the lion's share of possession (61%) and 11 corners to Odisha's nil, but they failed to convert those into goals as the Kalinga Warriors dug deep to soak in the pressure and charge on the counterattack. Couple of good attempts by former Bagan striker Roy Krishna and midfielder Lalthathanga Khawlhring, aka Puitea, for the hosts went abegging as the scoreline stayed level till the final whistle.The hosts, Odisha FC, drew first blood when their midfield maestro, Hugo Boumous, found the back of the net with a well-placed right-footed shot from close range. The goal came after a set-piece situation inside the box, with Ahmed Jahouh providing the assist with a fine touch. The ball took a deflection off a MBSG defender before nestling into the back of the net, leaving goalkeeper Vishal Kaith with no chance of making a save.Odisha FC's resolute defence, led by the towering presence of Mourtada Fall, stood tall against the fancied MBSG attack, which had scored 12 goals before this encounter. The young Odisha backline thwarted the visitors' attempts to find an equaliser, frustrating their potent attacking force.However, MBSG's persistent threat paid off when Manvir Singh restored parity for the Mariners. The winger's well-timed header from the centre of the box found the bottom-right corner, leaving Odisha goalkeeper Amrinder Singh helpless despite getting his hands to the ball. The assist came from the pivotal midfielder Dimitri Petratos, who delivered a precise cross following a corner kick. Saviour Gama, who had conceded the corner, was stationed on the goal line but could not prevent the header from crossing the line.The first half ended with the scores level at 1-1, setting the stage for an exciting second period. Both teams displayed resilience and determination, with Odisha backline standing firm against MBSG's relentless attacks, while the visitors' defence remained vigilant to thwart any potential threats from the hosts.In the end, the tie ended in a keenly-fought draw.While Odisha FC will be pleased with their defensive resilience after conceding 13 goals before this game, MBSG will rue their missed chances to secure all three points. With one point from their seventh game MBSG consolidated their second place on the league table with 14 points while Odisha remained on ninth spot with nine points after eight games.","Mohun Bagan Super Giant (MBSG) and Odisha FC (OFC) played out an enthralling 1-1 draw in Bhubaneswar on Sunday.

Mumbai’s India On Track Football Club (IOT FC) has achieved this distinction in the last five years — rising from the lowest rung of the Mumbai Football League to the top at a breakneck speed. IOT FC is a grassroots football club founded in 2018, which has quickly become one of the most exciting teams in Mumbai football.In just four years, this senior men’s team has risen through the ranks of the Mumbai Football Association (MFA), achieving an unprecedented record: four consecutive league promotions in four seasons. In the 2024-25 season, this small club is going for a bigger record — winning the Mumbai Premier League, the top-tier football league and making it five in a row in the Mumbai Football Association’s Mumbai Football League, the second oldest football league in Asia after the Calcutta Football League Football leagues are usually organised in a pyramid system, so a club has to win the division or go through playoffs every year to achieve promotion to the higher division. Very few clubs around the world have managed to climb from the lowest to the top tier in a short period, clearing four divisions in four years. IOT FC is one of those that has achieved this feat. IOT FC’s story is one of grit, determination, and unparalleled consistency.They started their training sessions on Mumbai’s Juhu Beach, as there was no available ground for them to book. Yet, they rose through the ranks, achieving what only a few clubs, even on a global scale, can claim to have achieved. The club has been promoted four seasons in a row – a rare feat that only 15 other clubs in the world have managed to achieve joining the likes of Grazer AK (Austria), SV Rodinghausen and TV Herkenrath (Germany), SC Sagamihara and Iwaki FC (Japan), among others. What is remarkable is that IOT FC is one of the few clubs to do so in the last five years, further underscoring the magnitude of their achievement.What makes their achievements particularly noteworthy is that the club has made such progress without its own football ground, with the help of local talent, and without the financial clout enjoyed by other clubs in the top divisions of MFA. They have managed to keep their success graph despite the disruption caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.“We, as a club, have always been aligned to set winning processes. Although the intangibles of this process have been our values of commitment, honesty, sacrifice, and welfare of players and all people associated with the club. Hard work in training, opposition scouting, a clear tactical plan, game management, and the intangibles have made us successful so far,” says IOT FC head coach Yash Shah.After clinching four promotions in four years -- IOT has won one title and finished in the top two to gain automatic promotion in three others, the club will now be competing against the best football teams in Mumbai, showcasing the same drive, discipline and flair that have made them a formidable force in Mumbai football.What sets IOT FC apart is not just their impressive record but the values and vision that underpin the club. As a grassroots football organisation, the club was founded to nurture and develop local talent, and it continues to be a platform for aspiring footballers to grow and achieve their full potential. Their rapid rise through the MFA leagues is a testament not only to the talent and skill of the players but also to the dedication and strategic planning of the club’s management.IOT FC is more than just a football team; it is a symbol of ambition, resilience, and community. Their success has inspired countless young footballers across Mumbai, demonstrating what is possible when passion and hard work come together. As the team prepares to face Mumbai’s top clubs in the Premier League, they do so as a club that has earned the respect of both players and fans alike.“With India On Track FC, we set out to prove that grassroots football, when done right, when done with the values of discipline, integrity and a winning mindset, can achieve remarkable results. Our mission was to combine professional training with strong values, and I’m incredibly proud of how far we’ve come. Watching the team succeed season after season is a testament to that original vision, and we’re really looking forward to how IOT FC will grow, how its players will develop, and the opportunities we can give them for new beginnings, constant improvement, and a positive team environment,” says Gaurav Modwel, Chairman of IOT, who was previously the CEO of Pune City FC, a club that competed in the Indian Super League (ISL).At Pune City FC, he was instrumental in establishing the club’s presence and fostering a competitive football culture, and further influenced and impacted Indian sport, especially football, because of his deep focus on youth sports development. As IOT FC’s campaign in the Mumbai Premier League gathers pace, the focus is on maintaining the momentum that has carried them through four consecutive league titles. They are in Group B of the 18-team league and in the top half after three rounds and on course to achieving their ambition.The club’s ambition is not limited to just this season; they have their sights set on building a long-term legacy in Mumbai football and beyond. With a squad brimming with talent and a coaching team that has guided them to success year after year, IOT FC is well-positioned to continue their winning ways. This season, however, will be their toughest test yet. Competing against Mumbai’s elite, IOT FC will need to bring their very best to the pitch. But with the team’s track record, there is every reason to believe that they will rise to the challenge and continue to defy expectations.As the Mumbai Premier League gets underway, football fans across the city are eager to see whether IOT FC can make history by securing their fifth consecutive title. Whatever the outcome, one thing is certain: IOT FC is a club that has already made an indelible mark on Indian football, and their story is far from over.""It’s not just about winning titles – it’s about fostering a culture of excellence, discipline, and integrity. We want to give athletes the platform to realise their full potential and, in doing so, elevate Indian football, create team India’s next generation of players, and put India on the global stage,"" says Modwel.","India On Track Football Club (IOT FC) is a Mumbai-based grassroots football club.

Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz are set to further their emerging rivalry when the ATP Finals commence on Sunday, marking the first time in 23 years that the event will be held without any of the Big Three.Sinner, the top-ranked player, and No. 3 Alcaraz each claimed two Grand Slam titles this year, so a matchup between them in Turin would be fitting.In the draw on Thursday , Sinner and Alcaraz were placed in separate groups. Sinner will compete in the Ilie Nastase Group alongside Daniil Medvedev, Taylor Fritz, and Alex de Minaur, while Alcaraz will be in the John Newcombe Group with Alexander Zverev, Casper Ruud, and Andrey Rublev. The top two players from each group will advance to the semifinals following the round-robin stage.After withdrawing from last week's Paris Masters due to illness, Sinner arrived in Turin early to prepare. “For me, this is the main event of the end of the year,” he stated.Notably absent is defending champion Novak Djokovic, who withdrew on Tuesday due to an unspecified injury . This is the first year since 2001 that the finals will occur without at least one of Djokovic, Roger Federer, or Rafael Nadal. Additionally, this season also marks the first time since 2002 that no member of that trio has won a Grand Slam title.Djokovic holds the record for the most ATP Finals victories, having won seven times and defeating Sinner in the final last year. Federer, who retired in 2022, won the event six times, while Nadal, who will retire after the Davis Cup next week, was a finalist twice but never secured a title.“It’s strange not to see Novak here, given all his success,” Zverev remarked. “When I won in 2018, you needed to defeat at least two of the top three players. It feels different now. But with Jannik and Carlos emerging, the focus has shifted to new talent. You have to overcome them to win big tournaments. They've both won two Grand Slams this year and undoubtedly rank among the best players in the world.”As the sole Italian in the competition, Sinner will attract significant attention, particularly since this is his first home appearance following the announcement of positive drug tests earlier this year before his US Open title.The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) appealed a decision exonerating Sinner, and the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) is expected to issue a ruling early next year. Sinner expressed uncertainty over updates, emphasising his positive outlook despite the challenging circumstance.Alcaraz has defeated Sinner in all three of their official meetings this year and currently leads their overall head-to-head 6-4.Sinner's year started with an Australian Open victory — the first Grand Slam title for an Italian man since Adriano Panatta's 1976 French Open win. Alcaraz subsequently secured the French Open and Wimbledon titles, bringing his career total to four Grand Slams. Sinner later triumphed at the US Open. Notably, Sinner defeated Alcaraz during the Six Kings Slam exhibition in Saudi Arabia last month.Zverev, who has previously won the finals in London in 2018 and in Turin in 2021, seeks to claim his third title. Medvedev, the only other player in the field with a finals win, lifted the trophy in 2020.Zverev arrives in promising form following a title victory at the Paris Masters , which propelled him past Alcaraz to No. 2 in the rankings.Fritz aims to build on his maiden Grand Slam final appearance in New York, Ruud was a finalist in 2022, De Minaur is making his debut in the tournament, and Rublev is competing for the fifth consecutive year.The ATP Finals, featuring the top eight singles players and doubles teams, begins on November 10 and runs until November 17.The ATP Finals will be contested in Turin, Italy for the fourth consecutive year. The event will take place at the Inalpi Arena.Ilie Nastase Group: Jannik Sinner (1), Daniil Medvedev (4), Taylor Fritz (5), Alex de Minaur (7)John Newcombe Group: Alexander Zverev (2), Carlos Alcaraz (3), Casper Ruud (6), Andrey Rublev (8)Bob Bryan Group: Marcelo Arevalo and Mate Pavic (1), Simone Bolelli and Andrea Vavassori (4), Rohan Bopanna and Matthew Ebden (6), Kevin Krawietz and Tim Puetz (8)zverevMike Bryan Group: Marcel Granollers and Horacio Zeballos (2), Wesley Koolhof and Nikola Mektic (3), Max Purcell and Jordan Thompson (5), Harri Heliovaara and Henry Patten (7)The champion of the ATP Finals will receive $4.8 million, the largest prize in men’s tennis history. This amount surpasses the earnings from Sinner and Alcaraz’s Grand Slam victories this year, with Sinner earning $3.6 million for the US Open and Alcaraz $3.45 million (or £2.7 million) for Wimbledon.The singles and doubles competitions will take place in a round-robin format. The players and teams will play each other(s) once and the top two in singles/doubles will advance to the semi-finals. The top player/team from each group will face the No. 2 placed player/team in the other group.The ATP Finals 2024 will be available on TV on Sony Sports Network in India.The tournament will be live streamed on SonyLiv app and website in India.","The ATP Finals will take place in Turin, Italy, for the fourth consecutive year.

Defending WTA Finals champion Iga Swiatek was eliminated from the season-ending championship on Thursday after Barbora Krejcikova's 7-5 6-4 win over Coco Gauff meant the Polish world number two failed to advance to the last four.Gauff was already guaranteed to make the semis, but five-times Grand Slam champion Swiatek needed the American to beat eighth-seeded Czech Krejcikova who required a victory herself to progress.The 13th-ranked Krejcikova took a tight first set, which lasted 54 minutes, after saving four break points, wrapping it up with a powerful backhand that zipped down the line.Former US Open champion Gauff, who had not dropped a set in the tournament before the contest, was hurt by unforced errors — 23 alone in the opener.The second set was once again a close affair, but the Wimbledon champion held her nerve to secure the win in one hour and 42 minutes.""This is a big win for me and really happy with how I played and it was a really good match,"" the 27-year-old Krejcikova said. ""It's tough, it was up and down. The Wimbledon victory is the highest point in my career so far.""Being here and reaching the semi-final, it's something unimaginable. I'm really proud of myself and I'm looking forward to the new challenges.""Krejcikova is the lowest-ranked player to book a spot in the semis at the WTA Finals since Sandrine Testud (14) in 2001.Gauff will face world number one Aryna Sabalenka in a blockbuster semi-final, while Krejcikova will take on China's Olympic champion Zheng Qinwen .Earlier Swiatek had produced a ruthless performance to dismantle Daria Kasatkina 6-1 6-0, wasting little time in asserting herself as she raced to a 5-0 lead in the opening set which she wrapped up with an ace.Having replaced Jessica Pegula after the American withdrew due to a left knee injury, world number nine Kasatkina was demolished in the second set as Swiatek sealed the win in 51 minutes, making it the fastest match at the WTA Finals in eight years.Swiatek won 72% of her points on serve and thumped 15 winners as she extended her head-to-head advantage over the 27-year-old Russian to 6-1.Kasatkina is not the first player to be steam-rollered at the WTA Finals by Swiatek, who took her tally of 6-0 set wins at the tournament to five.The 23-year-old Pole equalled Serena Williams' total of 6-0 set wins at the event and is now only behind greats Martina Navratilova (12), Chris Evert and Steffi Graf (both seven).",Defending WTA Finals champion Iga Swiatek is eliminated from the season-ending championship.

No regrets, its not end of the world: Sindhu on Olympics

'Just wait for the magic to start'

NEW DELHI: Insisting that she still has a lot to offer and potential to win many more titles on the demanding BWF circuit, star Indian shuttler PV Sindhu on Friday said the 2028 Los Angeles Games remains on her radar.By the time the biggest sporting show on earth moves to the American shores, Sindhu will be 33. However, the two-time Olympic medallist says if she remains injury-free and in peak physical condition, she will aim for a third medal.A former world champion, Sindhu, who won silver at the 2016 Rio Olympics and bronze at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, returned empty-handed from the Paris Games after her unexpected exit in the pre-quarterfinals.""If I'm fit, if I'm able to do it, if I'm injury free, then definitely yes I will compete at LA. That's what I can tell you,"" the 29-year-old from Hyderabad told PTI.Sindhu had entered the Paris Games with high expectations under the mentorship of legendary Prakash Padukone but was knocked out early after losing to China's He Bing Jiao in the Round of 16.""It does happen at times. I had amazing two Olympics and in the third one, I couldn't get a medal. But I think I played well. I learn from my mistakes and come back stronger. It's not just over with it. I am looking one year at a time and now the next Olympics is again four years down the line.""So the main aim and goal is to stay fit and stay motivated and be injury free. And enjoy what I do.""Sindhu stressed that she has no regrets despite her early exit in Paris, saying, ""It's not the end of the world.""""I can see myself going there for at least the next couple of years now. I don't hate it or anything, it's fine, I need to come out of it. I don't have any regrets, it's not just over for me. I definitely would want to play a lot more and why not?""Sindhu believes she still has potential to win more titles and continue inspiring the next generation of Indian athletes.""There's always more to strive for. I want to win more titles, stand on more podiums and of course, ultimately leave a legacy that inspires the next generation of Indian athletes,"" said the Commonwealth Games champion.""I'm committed to pushing my limits and making the most of every opportunity in my career. I want to win a lot more and I have it in me.""Sindhu has made several changes to her coaching staff in her quest to regain her glory. After winning bronze at Tokyo with South Korean coach Park Tae Sang , she worked with SAI coach Vidhi Chaudhary and All England champion Muhammad Hafiz Hashim before joining the Padukone-Dravid Badminton Academy (PPBA) with coach Agus Dwi Santoso to prepare for the Paris Games.After her Paris exit, she brought in Anup Sridhar and former World No. 5 Lee Hyun-il for the rest of the season.""Sometimes, when you need a change, you need a change. I have had good coaches, good support system. I wanted some change after Park. Then I had a couple of them and I think right now it's Lee and Anup.""You need to do what is best for you.""Sindhu is now focussing on the next events in Japan and China.""I'm in good shape, physically and mentally I'm fit. We've been working on different aspects, on speed and defence. It's always good to learn new things from different coaches, which will help in your game.""So it's going on really well and I hope, you know, this time in Japan and China, I hope I do well with their guidance. So, just that you'll have to just wait for the magic to start.""In addition to her on-court commitments, Sindhu has also launched the 'PV Sindhu Centre for Badminton and Sports Excellence' in Visakhapatnam.""I bought this land before, the academy will take one and a half years to complete. The vision is to inspire and nurture the next generation of champions. We aim to create a world-class specialty for young athletes, regardless of their backgrounds.""","Two-time Olympic medallist says if she remains injury-free and in peak physical condition, she will aim for a third medal.

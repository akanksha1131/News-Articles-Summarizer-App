Poll Should India include both Nitish Kumar Reddy and Washington Sundar in the Edgbaston Test? Yes, they should both play. No, one should be dropped.

TimesofIndia.com in Birmingham: All-rounder duo of Nitish Kumar Reddy and Washington Sundar are likely to play the Edgbaston Test, starting from Wednesday.It could well mean India will drop a specialist batter and will go with three all-rounders at No 6, 7, 8.On Tuesday, Team India's assistant coach Ryan ten Doeschate hinted at inclusion of Reddy and Washington.""On Nitish is very close to getting a game. Obviously, he was fantastic in Australia. Coming into the team and playing the way he did,"" ten Doeschate said on Reddy.""We just felt on balance for the last game, we wanted to go with the bowling all-rounder, which we thought Shardul was slightly ahead on the bowling front.""We’re looking at ways of rejigging the puzzle so we can get a batting all-rounder in. And obviously, Nitish is our premium batting all-rounder at the moment. So I would say it’s a very good chance to play this Test,"" he added.Ten Doeschate, too had spoken about playing two spinners and having a batting depth in the lower-middle order, pointing towards Washington's ability to bat.""All three spinners are bowling very nicely, while Washi is batting very nicely.So it is just about what combination.""Do we go with an all-rounder spinner or a spinner? Then obviously you have to play the bowling all-rounder. So there’s so many different variables.""The wicket’s got 11mm grass on the pitch at the moment but it is quite dry underneath but there’s also rain forecast for Wednesday.So again, we are trying to weigh the two options attacking-wise. But I’m pretty sure two spinners will play in this Test match.""Meanwhile, on the eve of the second Test between India and England, Team India captain Shubman Gill made it clear that India will go with two spinners, citing the dry condition and hot weather in Birmingham.“In the previous match, if we had had an extra spinner in the fourth innings, the game could have been better,” Gill told reporters.“There were some patches in the wicket that could have been exploited. Whenever Jaddu (Ravindra Jadeja) bhai was bowling, chances were being created,"" he said.""I guess you would want batting depth till No. 7... and if your No. 8 can bat a little bit. If you are going till No. 9, it is difficult to take 20 wickets. If we are able to go with four or five premier bowlers and have our batting till No. 7 or 8, it would be a good combination,"" he added.","All-rounder duo of Nitish Kumar Reddy and Washington Sundar are likely to play the Edgbaston Test, starting from Wednesday.

When Shubman Gill and Gautam Gambhir looked at the pitch to decide India Playing XI

Poll Should India adopt a more defensive bowling strategy against England? Yes, definitely Maybe, depends on the match situation No, aggressive play is better

Late selection meeting between Gautam Gambhir, Shubman Gill and Ajit Agarkar near pitch?

Former India spinner Ravichandran Ashwin has delivered a bold and strategic message ahead of the second Test against England at Edgbaston: forget chasing wickets - pressure is the real weapon.“The whole point of 'going for the wickets', be it Test cricket or T20 cricket, is all a lie. Pressure gives you wickets,” Ashwin said, in a brutally honest assessment of India's bowling approach during the ongoing Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy. “When a bowler keeps a batter at one end for 10 balls and then delivers a good ball, that's what we call rhythm.”India lost the first Test in Leeds despite scoring five centuries - a historic anomaly. Only once before in Test cricket history has a team lost after notching four hundreds in a match - Australia against England in Melbourne, 1928.England's blistering 371-run chase, completed in just 82 overs, is now their second-highest fourth-innings pursuit. That aggressive brand of cricket, now globally dubbed “Bazball,” is likely to continue, but with one key exception - Jasprit Bumrah “It's not about how many overs Jasprit Bumrah will bowl.It's about how we keep the pressure on if Bumrah isn't bowling,” Ashwin told Wisden. “This game is very straightforward - ‘We will play Bumrah carefully and then Bazball everyone else'. That is pretty much what England will do.”Ashwin urged India's bowlers to take a more defensive and containment-focused approach to counter this.“As a bowling unit, we should make strategies to play some defensive, negative cricket. The kind of wickets England are making, we should play negative, defensive cricket and ask our bowlers to contain them more,” he said.",Former India spinner Ravichandran Ashwin has delivered a bold and strategic message ahead of the second Test against England at Edgbaston.

Late selection meeting between Gautam Gambhir, Shubman Gill and Ajit Agarkar near pitch?

Gonzalo Garcia’s clinical 54th-minute header proved decisive as Real Madrid edged Juventus 1-0 at the Hard Rock Stadium on Tuesday, sealing their place in the quarter-finals of the FIFA Club World Cup.The narrow win sets up a last-eight clash with the winner of Tuesday’s other match between Borussia Dortmund and Mexico’s Monterrey. It was a mature and disciplined performance from Xabi Alonso’s Madrid side, who showed both grit and flair in difficult conditions.Adding to the good news for the Spanish giants was the return of Kylian Mbappe . The star forward, sidelined with illness, made his first appearance of the tournament, coming on as a 68th-minute substitute to a rousing reception from the 62,000-strong Miami crowd.The first half saw Juventus, led by Igor Tudor, start with energy and purpose. Randal Kolo Muani had a golden opportunity early on but chipped over the bar after being played through by Kenan Yildiz. Real gradually grew into the game, with Jude Bellingham and Federico Valverde forcing sharp saves from Juve goalkeeper Michele Di Gregorio as Madrid finished the half the stronger side.The pressure continued after the break, and Madrid’s breakthrough came from a moment of precision.Trent Alexander-Arnold delivered a pinpoint cross from the right, which Garcia met with a powerful, well-timed header for his third goal in four games.“We had to be patient, we had to mature into the game,” said Alonso after the match. “This was a knockout tie — it’s about competing. You grit your teeth, and in the end, we had to hold on. I’m happy with that.”Juventus showed flashes of resilience, with Francisco Conceicao and Nicolas Gonzalez testing Thibaut Courtois, but their energy visibly faded as the game wore on. Tudor admitted fatigue played a major role. “There were ten players asking to be substituted — the tension, the heat, the humidity, and a long season took its toll,” he said.Mbappe’s return offered a promising glimpse ahead of the quarters. “Day by day, he will be better,” Alonso said. “I talk to him every day about how he's feeling. I think he will be much better for the next game.”",Real Madrid beat Juventus 1-0 to reach the quarter-finals of the FIFA Club World Cup.

Late selection meeting between Gautam Gambhir, Shubman Gill and Ajit Agarkar near pitch?

Brief Scores:

BRISTOL: Fighting half-centuries by Jemimah Rodrigues (63, 41b, 9x4, 1x6) and Player of the Match Amanjot Kaur (63 not out, 40b, 9x4, 1-28 in three overs) and their 93-run stand for the fourth wicket in just 55 balls helped the Indian women's team down England by 24 runs in the second match of the T20I series at the Seat Unique Stadium on Tuesday night.Continuing their fine show, the Indian Women’s team thus took a 2-0 lead in the five-match series. Having beaten the hosts in the first T20I by a record margin of 97 runs, India now have the chance to wrap up a rare T20I series win over England in England and make history when they play the hosts on Friday (July 4) in the third T20I at The Kia Oval in London in a night match.It was the first time that England lost a Women’s T20 International at Bristol.Asked to bat first by the hosts, the Indian Women's team out up a formidable score of 181 for four in 20 overs - the second highest WT20I total at Bristol - which looked highly unlikely when it slumped to 31 for three in the sixth over, as opener Shafali Verma (3), last match's centurion and in-form batter Smriti Mandhana (13) and skipper Harmanpreet Kaur (1), returning after missing the first match due to a head injury she suffered in the warm-up match, were out cheaply.Playing in her landmark 150th T20I, Mandhana stroked two boundaries in her first four deliveries, making her and Shafali the most successful pair in terms of most runs as an opening partnership in Women's T20Is history. However, the Indian vice-captain succumbed to a brilliant catch by Lauren Bell off Em Arlott.However, Rodrigues and Amanjot, who had only scored 92 runs in 13 T20Is with 41 not out being her highest score, completely changed the complexion of the match, thus bringing alive the sizeable number of Indian supporters in the nearly 15,000 crowd here.After Rodrigues, who stroked a 33-ball half-century, was out in the 15th over, explosive 'keeper-bat Richa Ghosh blasted a quickfire 32 not out (20b, 6x4), adding 57 in an unbeaten fifth wicket partnership in 34 balls, giving the perfect finishing touches to the innings as India plundered 117 in the final 10 overs even as they were 64 for three after 10 overs. During her cameo, Ghosh, playing her 64th T20I, crossed the 1000-run landmark in WT20Is. For England, pacer Lauren Bell was the standout with the ball, taking two for 17 in four overs.India then put in a spirited show with the ball to restrict the England women's team to 157 for seven in 20 overs. Like India, England too suffered a bad collapse at the start of their innings, as they slumped to 17 for three in the fourth over, with Sophia Dunkley (1), the out-of-form Danni Wyatt-Hodge and new skipper Nat Sciver-Brunt (13) all losing their wickets early in the piece. The key wicket of Sciver-Brunt was scalped by Amanjot Kaur, who had the England captain caught at mid-on by her counterpart Harmanpreet Kaur.Wyatt-Hodge ended her run of three successive ducks, but was out for just one when she was caught at mid-off off Deepti Sharma, second time in a row that she had succumbed to Deepti’s off-spin.Tammy Beaumont (54, 35b, 8x4, 1x6) and 'keeper-bat Amy Jones (32, 27b, 4x4) added 70 in just 49 balls for the fourth wicket to stage a fightback, but a fine piece of pick up and throw at point by Sneh Rana ended the dangerous-looking partnership. Towards the end, seasoned left-arm spinner Sophie Ecclestone (35, 23b, 4x4, 1x6) used the long handle, but India had the game in control.Left-arm spinner Shree Charani, who took four for 12 on her T20I debut in the first match, once again produced an outstanding show, returning figures of two for 28 in four overs.After the match, Harmanpreet Kaur and her team gladly posed for pictures with India's Mixed Disability team, which had earlier in the day played a match against its English counterparts at the same venue, losing by seven wickets.India 181-4 in 20 overs (Jemimah Rodrigues 63, Amanjot Kaur not out 63, Richa Ghosh 32 not out; Lauren Bell 2-17) beat England 157-7 in 20 overs (Tammy Beaumont 54, Sophie Ecclestone 35, Amy Jones 32; Shree Charani 2-28) by 24 runs.",India beat England by 24 runs to take 2-0 lead in five-match series.

India’s XI Puzzle Ahead of 2nd Test | Jaiswal Shifted, Kuldeep or Bumrah?

Poll Who should be the second spinner alongside Ravindra Jadeja? Kuldeep Yadav Washington Sundar Neither, stick with one spinner

An extra spinner in the XI to contain the opposition. Focus on the lower-order for useful contributions. And, finding the right balance between batting depth and picking 20 wickets. These points largely summed up the theme of Shubman Gill's press conference and India's strategy on the eve of the second Test against England which gets underway at the Edgbaston Cricket Ground in Birmingham on July 2.The conversation around Jasprit Bumrah remained where assistant coach Ryan ten Doeschate had left it on Monday, but the captain did add that the final call will be taken later that evening - unlike ""last minute"" as the Dutch coach had said.While Bumrah's unavailability could force a straight-swap in the fast-bowling lineup, which is likely to continue with Prasidh Krishna and Mohammed Siraj, and have Akash Deep as the replacement, but it's the support cast around them which has given a sneak peek into the team management's mindset.With Gill emphasising on the need for containing the opposition with the second spinner, the scales are heavily tilted in favour of Washington Sundar.“It is not usual to play two spinners here but we have not had typical weather here and there has not been enough rain. In the last match also, we felt that if we had an extra spinner in the 4th innings, the game could have been better. There were some patches in the wicket that we could have exploited. Whenever Jaddu Bhai was bowling, we felt that chances were being created. We felt that it is easier to contain the runs for spinners than for fast bowlers, especially when the ball is old. We feel that maybe a second spinner on these kinds of wickets will at least contain a run until the second new ball arrives, where there are more chances,"" said Gill in the presser.Gill and coach Gautam Gambhir need to finalise the two spinners out of the three in the squad. While Ravindra Jadeja looks locked, the big call needs to be taken between specialist Kuldeep Yadav and all-rounder Sundar. While batting and lower-order contributions are expected to be crucial factors, another aspect that will be taken into consideration will be the role on Day 1. Sundar is very comfortable bowling with the hard new ball and even Kuldeep was practicing with the shining Dukes this week.“They are difficult calls for sure. If you are going with an extra spinner, the only thing that you have to see is how do you manage him on Day 1 if you are bowling on Day 1. And ideally, if at all there is anything on these kinds of wickets, it is on Day 1 in the first session or first couple of sessions. So, taking a call on that and seeing how you manage your second spinner, especially on Day 1 is the main call that you have to take on these kinds of wickets,” explained Gill.The likely template for the second match is an extension of what we have seen in the past where India's obsession with batting depth has left them digging a hole for themselves. The side has lacked the stomach to field specialist bowlers and ever so often, matches have ended with a ""what could have been"" storyline. They find themselves in a similar position in Birmingham and that crucial call could well point towards the mindset this Test team, under Gill and coach Gautam Gambhir, is likely to have in the near future.There are good arguments both in favour and against Kuldeep and Sundar but if the coach and captain walk the 20 wickets talk, Kuldeep walks into the XI but if the likely obsession on depth continues, Sundar starts.","Captain Shubman Gill and coach Gautam Gambhir need to finalise the two spinners out of the three in the squad.

On the eve of the second Test against England at Edgbaston, India captain Shubman Gill, head coach Gautam Gambhir, and chief selector Ajit Agarkar were seen in an intense discussion, coupled with a pitch inspection, pointing to major selection decisions ahead of the match.As soon as the pre-match press conference ended, Gill headed straight to the centre, joined shortly by Gambhir and Agarkar. The three stood near the 22-yard strip for an extended period, closely studying the surface and having what looked like a serious discussion. The session hinted at the importance of the pitch conditions in finalising India’s playing XI for the crucial Test.While England have already named an unchanged XI following their win in Leeds, India are expected to make changes, more so if star pacer Jasprit Bumrah is rested as part of workload management. In such a scenario, the nature of the Edgbaston pitch could be the deciding factor in India’s team combination.India’s assistant coach Ryan ten Doeschate also hinted at changes. “I am very sure two spinners will play,” he told reporters on Monday. “Which ones, we are not sure yet. All three are bowling nicely. Washi (Washington Sundar) is batting really well too.”The visuals of Gill, Gambhir and Agarkar at the pitch showcased a leadership group deeply involved in tactical planning ahead of a must-win Test.India trail 0-1 in the five-match Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy series, and with conditions in Birmingham expected to assist both seamers and spinners, selection calls made on match eve could well define how the match and ultimately the series unfolds from here.","India captain Shubman Gill, head coach Gautam Gambhir, and chief selector Ajit Agarkar were seen in an intense discussion, coupled with a pitch inspection.

Shubman Gill press conference: Playing XI almost final, time of Jasprit Bumrah call and more

Poll Should Prasidh Krishna be given more chances in the Indian team? Yes, he has potential. No, he should be dropped for the 2nd Test

Veteran spinner Ravichandran Ashwin has come out in support of fast bowler Prasidh Krishna , urging the Indian team management to give him more matches despite a difficult outing in the opening Test against England at Headingley.Krishna, who struggled for consistency and returned with an economy of over six across both innings, came under scrutiny after England pulled off a record 371-run chase to win the first match of the Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy series. However, Ashwin feels the tall pacer still has a big role to play going forward.“I would give Prasidh Krishna games, because when he got it right, he delivered lethal wicket-taking deliveries. I think Prasidh is one for the future. If Bumrah is not going to be playing all matches, he can step up to play that role,” Ashwin said on his YouTube channel.With Jasprit Bumrah’s availability uncertain for the second Test at Edgbaston, India could be forced to rework their bowling attack. Ashwin believes Arshdeep Singh ’s left-arm variation could be valuable, while also acknowledging Akash Deep’s red-ball strength.“If we are playing a seamer in place of Bumrah, I would think of Arshdeep and bring a left-arm option.Nevertheless, let us not forget what Akash Deep has done; he can bowl well with the red ball, while Arshdeep is not a proven commodity yet,” he added.Ashwin also weighed in on India’s team balance and selection decisions, particularly around the fourth seamer and middle-order combinations. “Only debatable topic is Karun Nair–Sai Sudharsan/Nitish Kumar Reddy. How many overs will the fourth seamer give? How good is Reddy’s batting form? I know for a fact that the Indian team management rates Nitish Kumar Reddy very highly.”India's bowling looked sharp only in patches during the first Test, with Bumrah carrying the bulk of the workload. As workload management looms large for him across the long series, eyes will be on how India rotates its pace unit ahead of the Edgbaston Test.",Ravichandran Ashwin wants Prasidh Krishna to play in the 2nd Test.

With doubts over Jasprit Bumrah ’s availability for the second Test against England at Edgbaston, former India all-rounder Irfan Pathan has backed Akash Deep as a strong replacement.India may rest Bumrah to manage his workload over the five-match series. Pathan believes Akash Deep’s bowling style could suit English conditions well. “If Bumrah is not there, then who should come into the side in his place? Akash Deep, from what’s been seen in the nets, seems to be getting into his rhythm. I feel that he is the Shami mould type of bowler,” Pathan said on his YouTube channel.In the first Test at Headingley, India lost by five wickets. Despite hundreds from Rishabh Pant, Shubman Gill, and Yashasvi Jaiswal, England chased down a big target of 371 runs. Among bowlers, Bumrah was the only Indian bowler who looked in control and unsurprisingly claimed the joint-most wickets for the visitors in the first Test. His supporting cast, however, struggled to apply pressure on England’s batters.Pathan explained that Akash Deep could offer more control because of his focus on seam and swing.“His straight seam deliveries can trouble the England batters, especially when it comes to late movement.If you are going aggressive, this could be a problem. We will come to Arshdeep, but I think if Bumrah is not playing, then it should be Akash Deep who should come in his place,” he added.Meanwhile, assistant coach Ryan ten Doeschate said the team is confident of doing well even if Bumrah is rested. “It is, but we also feel we can go 1-1 or keep the score at 1-0 without Jasprit. Again, that’s putting the eggs in the back end of the series. We’re going to need him at some stage as well. You’ve got to decide when you’re going to play your strongest suit,” ten Doeschate said.A final decision on Bumrah's selection is expected to be made on the day of the match.",India may rest Jasprit Bumrah for the second Test against England at Edgbaston.

India fast bowler Arshdeep Singh recently responded strongly to a fan who questioned his focus during the ongoing Test series in England. The 26-year-old is part of the squad for the five-match Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy but hasn’t played yet.A fan messaged Arshdeep on social media platform Snapchat saying, “Ghumne se kuch ni hoga pajji, match jitwao” (Roaming around won’t help, win matches).

Speaking on his YouTube channel, the former cricketer praised Arshdeep’s control and swing, and said he could add variety to India’s bowling attack.With conditions in Birmingham likely to help fast bowlers, Arshdeep’s left-arm pace could be valuable.

Shubman Gill press conference: Playing XI almost final, time of Jasprit Bumrah call and more

TimesofIndia.com in Birmingham: On the eve of the second Test at Edgbaston, all eyes are on Jasprit Bumrah — not just for his fiery spells, but for whether he'll feature at all. India captain Shubman Gill confirmed that Bumrah is available for selection, but remained tight-lipped about the final XI, adding intrigue to an already pivotal encounter.“We will take the Jasprit Bumrah call this evening. We will decide which spinner plays after looking at the pitch,” Gill told reporters on Tuesday. “Jasprit Bumrah is available. We are trying to find the right combination which can pick 20 wickets and score runs as well.”India head into this Test with selection headaches following a frustrating loss in Leeds, where they let a strong position slip and failed to bowl England out in the fourth innings.With Bumrah’s workload management in focus, India could be forced to reshuffle their bowling attack, which Gill acknowledged won’t be easy.“It is difficult,” he said. “But we’ve picked the best players from India. It’s not an impossible task — other bowlers are good. We have a strong pool.”The Edgbaston pitch adds complexity to the decision-making. Though it appears green, a dry layer underneath suggests spinners could come into play later in the match.India are considering going in with two spinners, a move they hesitated on in Leeds and may now regret.“We felt in Leeds that an extra spinner would help contain the flow of runs, especially in the third or fourth innings,” Gill admitted.While India continue to weigh their selection options, England have opted for stability, announcing an unchanged XI for the second Test at Edgbaston.The hosts, buoyed by their dramatic victory in the series opener at Headingley, revealed their playing XI on Monday, sticking with the same lineup that delivered under pressure.Led by Ben Stokes, the side features Zak Crawley, Ben Duckett, Ollie Pope, Joe Root, and Harry Brook in the top order, with Jamie Smith retaining his place. The bowling attack remains the same as well, with Chris Woakes, Brydon Carse, Josh Tongue, and Shoaib Bashir forming a well-rounded unit tailored for English conditions.","Jasprit Bumrah is available for selection, says India captain Shubman Gill.

Manchester City's Club World Cup title defence ended in a stunning 4-3 extra-time defeat to Saudi Arabian side Al Hilal in Orlando on Monday, while Inter Milan were eliminated 2-0 by Brazilian team Fluminense in Charlotte, creating two major upsets in the tournament's last 16 round.Al Hilal, achieving one of Middle Eastern football's greatest results, will now face Fluminense in the quarter-finals in Orlando on Friday.Despite winning all three group matches including a victory over Juventus, City fell short against an Al Hilal team featuring several former European league players at the Camping World Stadium.City took an early lead through Bernardo Silva's close-range finish after nine minutes, but Marcos Leonardo equalised in the second half.Former Barcelona player Malcom put Al Hilal ahead after receiving a through ball from Joao Cancelo.Erling Haaland scored to level the match for City and nearly scored again with a shot cleared off the line before the game went to extra time.Kalidou Koulibaly scored from a corner in the 94th minute, followed by Phil Foden's equaliser ten minutes later.Leonardo sealed the victory for Al Hilal in the 112th minute, converting a rebound after Ederson saved Sergej Milinkovic-Savic's header.""We knew that it was a difficult game against one of the best teams in the world -- we wanted to show our ideas, our talents, our power,"" said Al Hilal's Kalidou Koulibaly.""Unfortunately we can't continue in the competition so we have to learn and keep moving forward,"" Guardiola said. ""Al Hilal don't just run, they have a lot of quality, we created a lot with wingers but they are a complete team... I have a big, big opinion of Al Hilal but I (also) think we had a good game to be honest.""In the other match, Fluminense secured their quarter-final spot with German Cano scoring an early header against Inter Milan.Substitute Hercules added a late goal for Fluminense, while Inter hit the woodwork twice through Lautaro Martinez and Federico Dimarco.Fluminense joined fellow Brazilian side Palmeiras in the quarter-finals, continuing Brazilian teams' success against European opposition in the tournament.""We knew they were not going to be easy opponents.

Obviously, more women refs (referees) now. So you have to pay a bit more respect. Do you know what I mean? You have to pay a bit more respect like help them park.Do you know what I mean? But, yeah. But, yeah, I’m getting a bit better,"" said the coach as he burst out laughing.White, who is also the founder of Dorking Wanderers, has played a pivotal role in the club’s rise through the English football pyramid.

Has attendance really been that low at the Club World Cup?

Extreme heat

Poll Are you excited about the upcoming 2026 FIFA World Cup? Absolutely! Not really Only if the issues are resolved

As the final eight of the 2025 Club World Cup takes shape with teams like Chelsea and Palmeiras booking their spots, the tournament has become the target of criticism from several top figures in the sport. While thrilling matchups such as Paris Saint-Germain vs Inter Miami and Real Madrid vs Juventus keep fans on edge, the build-up to the 2026 FIFA World Cup has exposed serious issues in the revamped 32-team Club World Cup.From matches being disrupted because of extreme heat to pitch concerns and an expanded format, players and coaches alike have raised concerns. Despite solid turnouts at some fixtures, the overall experience, both on and off the pitch, has left many questioning the planning behind the tournament.Chelsea may have comfortably defeated Benfica 4-1, but manager Enzo Maresca was far from being satisfied. The Italian coach vented his frustration after the match was delayed by nearly two hours due to lightning in Charlotte, North Carolina, stretching the game to five hours.“This is not the right place to do this competition,” Maresca said, noting it was already the sixth weather-related delay of the tournament.“If they are already suspending six, seven, eight games, probably there is something that is not working well.”Poor pitch quality has been another talking point of the competition. PSG boss Luis Enrique didn’t hold back, comparing the playing surface to a pothole-riddled basketball court after his side’s 2-0 win over Seattle Sounders.“I wouldn't imagine an NBA court full of holes,” said Enrique. “The ball bounces almost like if it were jumping around like a rabbit.”Real Madrid midfielder Jude Bellingham also mirrored his concerns after his side’s 3-1 win over Pachuca. “The pitches aren’t great at all. It holds up the ball, the ball barely bounces,” said the England star. “It’s tough on the knees as well. Hopefully there's someone who will look at that going into the World Cup next year,” the player told Sky Sports.Former Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp called out the tournament's expanded format, pointing to a packed football calendar and player fatigue.""It's all about the game and not the surrounding events – and that's why the Club World Cup is the worst idea ever implemented in football in this regard,"" Klopp told Welt am Sonntag. “There is insane money for participating, but it’s also not for every club... That means no real recovery for the players involved, neither physically nor mentally.”Despite reports of low crowd numbers at certain matches, some fixtures have seen heavy attendance. Eighteen group-stage games drew over 40,000 fans, and a record 80,619 showed up to watch PSG thrash Atletico Madrid 4-0 at the Rose Bowl, making it the highest attended game in Club World Cup history.However, weekday games saw poor turnout, with the worst being Ulsan HD vs Mamelodi Sundowns in Orlando, where only 3,412 fans attended a match delayed by storms. This wasn't the lowest in tournament history, but it reflected poor turnout in less-hyped fixtures. That being said, the opening match between Al Ahly and Inter Miami drew 60,927 fans to Hard Rock Stadium.Sweltering conditions have plagued several games, with temperatures soaring to 36°C during Bayern Munich vs Benfica in Charlotte. Chelsea coach Maresca described trying to train in Philadelphia’s “code red” heat warning zone as “impossible.”Games have featured mandatory cooling breaks, with players using ice towels and dousing themselves in water to survive the conditions. The threat of thunderstorms also looms large, with five games facing lengthy delays due to lightning within a 10-mile radius of stadiums.Even Bundesliga giants Borussia Dortmund resorted to keeping their substitutes in the dressing room during matches. Their coach Niko Kovac described the dugout atmosphere as of that to a “sauna”.As the Club World Cup moves closer to its conclusion, the football on display has had its moments, but the criticism surrounding schedule, climate, and player welfare are casting long shadows over FIFA’s revamped project.","The 2025 Club World Cup has become the target of criticism from several top figures in the sport.

Auckland City hold their ground in a historic result

Messi and Miami power through to the Round of 16

A 'heated' Club World Cup

Concerns for the upcoming World Cup?

'New' tournament, same old favourites

List of qualified teams for Round of 16

As the 21st edition of the FIFA Club World Cup moves towards the Round of 16, the competition's facelift has provided multiple storylines. From the number of teams participating to a newly designed trophy, more venues and even a referee cam, the competition in the United States has gone closer to its namesake - the quadrennial World Cup.The organisers have called it ""a celebration of hope, excellence and pride, embodying the journey of every club, player and fan united in their passion for the beautiful game."" With several new debutants and the tournament now being a month-long event, the competition has changed in stature.Now, teams from all six confederations - 12 teams from Europe, 6 from South America, 4 from Africa, 4 from Asia, 4 from North, Central America and Caribbean, 1 from Oceania, and 1 team from the host nation complete the 2025 line-up.With the group stage done and dusted and just 16 teams left in the running, it is fair to say that this edition of the Club World Cup has had its fair share of upsets, David vs Goliath matchups and some heated moments, literally and figuratively.Ranked 4,971st in the Opta Power Rankings, Auckland City went in as the lowest ranked side in the Club World Cup. They were grouped alongside Bayern Munich, Benfica and Boca Juniors.To put things into context, Auckland City are made up of amateurs, play in the Northern League in New Zealand, comprising just 12 teams.Auckland suffered a brutal 0-10 loss against Bayern Munich to start with - the biggest defeat in this year's tournament - which was followed by a 0-6 thumping from Benfica.Already eliminated and with nothing to lose, Auckland faced Argentinian giants Boca Juniors in their last game. In what can only be described as a David-Goliath matchup, the underdogs denied Boca a spot in the Round of 16, who were in need of a win to progress. A difference of 4,819 ranking points and Boca's historical success made the 1-1 draw all the more sweet for the amateurs.Grouped alongside giants Porto, Al Ahly and Palmeiras, Lionel Messi's Inter Miami were expected to be swept aside. Instead, the Argentine No 10, supported by Luis Suarez, Jordi Alba and Sergio Busquets, powered through to the Round of 16, after finishing second in Group A.While the Herons could only pick up one win, it was enough to qualify. After a stalemate against Al Ahly in the tournament opener, Miami were up against Portuguese giants Porto. In what seemed like a difficult task for Miami, Messi's timeless brilliance, exemplified by a stunning free kick, earned them a 2-1 win. Miami drew their final game 2-2 against Brazil's Palmeiras, and confirmed their berth in the last 16.Tensions boiled over on the final matchday in Group E, where River Plate needed a win to make it to the last 16. Inter, however, denied them that pleasure. At the full-time whistle, River's Marcos Acuna and Inter's Denzel Dumfries nearly came to blows, needing an entire team and support staff to intervene. The feud, which first began three years ago, saw Argentina's Acuna show Netherlands' Dumfries the 2022 World Cup trophy logo on his shin guard. At the tournament, Argentina had beaten Netherlands in a heated quarter-final which finished on penalties.Heated moments weren't restricted to the players, as heatwaves and extreme temperatures saw teams give their players ice baths and cold towels. Borussia Dortmund went a step further, making their substitutes watch the game against Mamelodi Sundowns from the locker room and not from the bench to protect them from the blistering heat. Their coach likened the playing conditions to that of a 'sauna'. Thunderstorms and lightning also resulted in at least five games being delayed.But it isn't just ice packs, but ICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement) who have been a presence at the tournament, making it the first to do so. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) will also be a part of the tournament's setup, with non-citizens needing proof of legal status to attend games.With less than a year to go for the 2026 FIFA World Cup , set to be co-hosted by the United States, Mexico and Canada, its precursor has revealed several issues. From pitch quality, to heat and weather in general, the tournament hasn't been a smooth one to say the least.Real Madrid star Jude Bellingham called out the poor pitch conditions, saying ""The pitches aren’t great here. The pitches aren’t great at all,"" said the 21-year-old after his side's match against Pachuca at the Bank of America Stadium in Charlotte.Besides the underdog stories, major upsets and more teams, the tournament still remains a hunting ground for Europe's best. Giants like Real Madrid and Manchester City still remain favourites to win the prize. Five teams from the eight groups - Seattle Sounders, Urawa Reds, Ulsan, Wydad AC and Pachuca - were eliminated without a single point.Group A: Palmeiras, Inter MiamiGroup B: Paris Saint-Germain, BotafogoGroup C: Bayern Munich, BenficaGroup D: Flamengo, ChelseaGroup E: Inter Milan, MonterreyGroup F: Borussia Dortmund, FluminenseGroup G: Manchester City, JuventusGroup H: Real Madrid, Al Hilal",The 21st edition of the FIFA Club World Cup has come to an end.

David Beckham (Instagram Screengab)

David Beckham is recovering in hospital after undergoing surgery for a long-standing wrist injury, with wife Victoria Beckham offering fans a glimpse into his recovery.On Friday, Victoria took to Instagram Stories to post a photo of the 50-year-old football icon lying in a hospital bed, dressed in a hospital gown with his arm resting in a blue sling.Captioning the photo “Get well soon daddy” with a heart emoji, the former Spice Girl and fashion designer showed support for her husband, who sustained the original injury back in 2003 during an England match.Though no further medical details were shared, the injury appears to be related to the same wrist issue that had lingered since his playing days. Despite the discomfort, Beckham appeared in good spirits, smiling gently for the camera as he recovered post-surgery.Victoria also posted another touching image of David holding a friendship bracelet bearing the message “Get well soon” spelled out in colorful beads -- likely a sweet gesture from one of their four children: Brooklyn, Romeo, Cruz, or Harper.The hospital update comes just weeks after it was announced that Beckham would receive a knighthood from King Charles, officially becoming “Sir David Beckham.” Victoria marked the news with pride on Instagram, writing, “You’ve always been my knight in shining armour, but now it’s official.”The couple recently celebrated Father’s Day as well, with Victoria sharing throwback clips and photos of David with their children, calling him “the best daddy there is.”Married since 1999, David and Victoria Beckham continue to show that family remains at the center of their lives—even during unexpected hospital stays.","David Beckham is recovering in hospital after undergoing surgery for a long- standing wrist injury.

Lazio have recalled Romano Floriani Mussolini to the club following his loan spell at Serie B side Juve Stabia. The 22-year-old right back is the great-grandson of Italian dictator Benito Mussolini and son of Alessandra Mussolini, a former European MP for Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia party.Mussolini initially joined Lazio in 2022 but did not make any appearances for the club. He spent the 2023-24 season on loan at Pescara, where he played 32 matches.At Juve Stabia, Mussolini established himself as a regular starter, making 37 appearances across all competitions.

Despite Juve Stabia's interest in signing him permanently, Lazio opted to bring him back.Fascist fan groups have been present across Italian football, with Lazio's hardcore supporters maintaining ties to the extreme right since the 1970s. The club's historic ultras group, the 'Irriducibili', maintained friendly relations with similarly right-wing supporters at Inter and Verona.Verona's fan base has been involved in several controversial incidents.Their supporters have directed racist chants at Mario Balotelli and Franck Kessie, displayed swastikas in the stadium, and once arranged cars at a fan gathering to form a Nazi symbol in 2014.Some 20 years ago, former Verona club president Giambattista Pastorello stated he wouldn't sign a black player due to potential fan reaction.Nine years prior to that statement, Verona fans wearing Ku Klux Klan hoods hung an effigy of black Dutch player Maickel Ferrier from the stands. This incident occurred in protest of his potential signing, which was subsequently cancelled.","Lazio have recalled Romano Floriani Mussolini from Serie B side Juve Stabia.

Oliver Rowland has multiple things to look forward to

Oliver Rowland is on the verge of winning the Formula E Season 11 World Championship. With four wins and three additional podiums in 12 rounds, Rowland leads this year’s Driver Standings by a massive margin. As the season nears its conclusion with the Berlin double-header and the London double-header remaining, the Nissan driver is almost certain to lift the championship trophy.Things began to look up for Oliver Rowland after he decided to switch from Mahindra Racing to Nissan last year. This season, he is all set to lift the Formula E World Championship trophy. Although he had a lackluster start in Sao Paulo, he bounced back with his first win of the year in Mexico. Soon after, he secured two podiums in Jeddah, including a win. He continued his strong form with double podiums in both the Monaco and Tokyo double-headers.After his last win in Tokyo, he brought his four-year-old daughter, Harper, to join him on the podium. Reflecting on the special moment after the Tokyo race, he said, ""I was already tired after qualifying. I was feeling pretty stressed with everything. There was a lot of pressure to go through.I was looking forward to the race being over, to be honest, and when it was over... when I saw her face, I just couldn't help but be super emotional. ”""[The atmosphere] was amazing. I didn't realise how many people were here until I stood on the podium, so it was a really special moment for me and the team. Honestly, sometimes I feel like I need to wake up from the dream that I'm living at the moment,"" he added.In the last three races, Rowland has slowed down slightly. He finished 10th in the most recent Round 12 race in Jakarta.The 32-year-old now inches closer to the championship at the Berlin E-Prix. Oliver Rowland previously won once in Berlin in 2020 and has claimed three other podiums at the venue in past seasons. After that, he will head to the London double-header for the season finale.

What sets the Berlin E-Prix apart

What’s challenging about the Tempelhof Circuit?

Past Berlin E-Prix winners

Season 11 of Formula E is now nearing its close, with four races remaining across two venues. Next up is the Berlin E-Prix, scheduled from July 11–13. Berlin is the only venue to have hosted a Formula E race every season since the championship's inception, making it one of the most special events on the calendar for multiple reasons. It has been held annually without a miss since 2015, and its scenic venue — the historic Tempelhof Airport — adds to its charm. Here are some interesting facts about Rounds 15 and 16 of the Formula E season in Berlin.One look at the Tempelhof circuit explains why the Berlin E-Prix is so special. With imposing aircrafts parked on one side of the barrier and a vast expanse of open space on the other, it’s arguably one of the most picturesque tracks in motorsport.Formula E cars are second only to airplanes when it comes to reaching top speeds — hitting 322 km/h in less than a minute. The most distinctive aspect of the Tempelhof Airport circuit is that it was originally designed for airplanes to take off and land, making it a unique surface for electric racing.The surface of the 2.343 km-long Tempelhof circuit is composed of layered concrete slabs designed for aircraft operations.While it supports Formula E racing, it presents challenges in energy management, tyre wear, and grip. The hot summer temperatures in Berlin can further test the drivers. Despite that, the wide layout, long corners, and even an indoor tunnel make the track exciting and full of overtaking opportunities.The Berlin E-Prix is a home race for DS Penske driver Maximilian Gunther. He won the event in 2020 and secured a third-place finish in 2023. The German driver recently expressed his excitement on Instagram. Reflecting on the Jakarta race, Gunther wrote, “Didn’t go our way this Saturday in Jakarta. Thanks for all the love, Indonesia. Now all eyes on Berlin – my home race.”However, it is TAG Heuer Porsche’s Antonio Felix da Costa who holds the record for the most Berlin E-Prix wins, having triumphed three times — twice in 2020 and once in 2024. Envision Racing’s Sebastien Buemi, Lola Yamaha ABT’s Lucas di Grassi, and TCS Jaguar Racing’s Nick Cassidy have each won the race twice.Also Read: Season 11 Berlin Rookie Test: Formula E teams announce nominations, eligibility rules explained However, this year’s race may see a new winner, as has been the case in several recent Formula E rounds.

Most wonderful shots from Jakarta E-Prix

It was a dusty yet thrilling Formula E race in Jakarta, with the championship returning to Indonesia after two years. Formula E has now shared some of the best videos from the Jakarta E-Prix for fans to relive the Indonesian race again and again. The real footage appears as eye-catching as scenes from a racing movie — complete with synchronized reactions from the audience and ground staff.The shots from the Jakarta E-Prix were shared by Formula E on Instagram with the caption: “Our race in Jakarta would have made a beautiful movie.” The first video is a still camera shot from a turn on the circuit, as the GEN3 Evo cars speed down the track. It is followed by a clip of a Lola Yamaha ABT driver getting into the car ahead of the race. There are also a few shots of the audience and ground staff moving their eyes from one direction to another as the cars race past.The post also includes a glimpse of Cupra Kiro driver Dan Ticktum celebrating his win by standing on his car amid loud cheers from his team members. There are additional shots from different corners of the circuit, each offering a unique visual experience. One clip features Jake Dennis, who, despite securing pole position, was hit by Nyck De Vries during the race — ruining his chances of winning or finishing on the podium.A comment from Mahindra Racing’s Instagram page read: “If Wes Anderson directed FE.” A fan agreed, saying, “Accidentally, the dust and pollution in Jakarta matched with Wes Anderson’s color palette.”One fan reacted to the post, “Love the still camera angle.” Another said, “Ha, it certainly would.” One more wrote, “Straight out of a movie scene!” Another comment read: “I hope this event will still be held in Jakarta next year.

Formula E drivers with the most front row starts

Does pole position — or a front row start — guarantee a win? Well, in most cases, it does. If not, it at least enables the driver to finish the race on the podium or earn some points to add to their score in the Driver Standings. This season, it’s Nissan’s Oliver Rowland who has clinched five front row starts and is leading the 2025 Formula E Driver Standings. He is far ahead of the competition and is almost certain to have secured the ABB FIA Formula E World Championship title this year.Oliver Rowland is far ahead of the competition at the top of the Formula E Driver Standings with 172 points. He has taken pole twice and started on the front row in three other races this year.There is hardly any scenario in which anyone can beat him in the remaining four races — except one. If Pascal Wehrlein, who is second in the Driver Standings, wins and Rowland fails to score any points, then only can Rowland’s top spot be challenged. However, that is highly unlikely, and Rowland will most probably lift the world championship trophy in London with ease.TAG Heuer Porsche driver Pascal Wehrlein has three front row starts, including two poles.This suggests that front row starts do play a major role in a driver’s chances of a podium finish.Pascal, however, is behind Taylor Barnard, who has delivered the most impressive performance on track this year. The NEOM McLaren driver recorded four front row starts, including two poles this season. He already has four podium finishes in what can be considered his first year as a full-time Formula E driver.Meanwhile, DS Penske driver Maximilian Gunther, TAG Heuer Porsche’s Antonio Felix da Costa, and Andretti’s Jake Dennis have two front row starts each this season. Among others who have grabbed pole position are Nissan’s Norman Nato, Mahindra Racing’s Nyck de Vries, Cupra Kiro’s Dan Ticktum, and Jaguar TCS Racing’s Nick Cassidy.Also Read: Oliver Rowland’s daughter Harper turns four, Nissan driver shares glimpse of her birthday celebrations There are four more races to go before the current Formula E season comes to an end.

Watch: Extrication practice in Formula E

Every motorsport involves risk, where a single crash can prove life-threatening. Formula E has maintained a strong safety record over its eleven seasons so far. However, as a precautionary measure, Formula E drivers undergo extrication practice once a year to ensure they are familiar with the emergency protocols in case of an incident. Recently, NEOM McLaren driver Sam Bird participated in one such practice session. A glimpse of the session was shared with fans on social media, offering insight into this important aspect of motorsport safety.The video shows Sam Bird acting as an injured driver while the FIA Formula E safety team carefully lifts him out of the car and places him on a stretcher. The procedure is designed to avoid further injury, particularly to the neck or any broken bones.McLaren FE shared the video on Instagram with the caption: “Earlier today, Sam completed his extrication practice with the @fiaformulae safety team. This is an exercise that happens at each race with a different team each time. This is for both the safety of the drivers and the extrication team should an incident occur where the driver would need assistance exiting the car. Each driver has to do this at least once a year to ensure their own safety.Some fans were momentarily alarmed upon seeing the video. One commented, “Goodness grief — not me watching the first few seconds of this without context.” Another said, “That scared me there for a second.”In general, fans appreciated the behind-the-scenes look at Formula E's extrication protocol. “Never seen the neck wrap/support before, very neat,” wrote one. Another added, “Much love to the safety teams, always prepared and always do an incredible job.” A third said, “Awesome to see, safety above all.” One fan even joked, “An FIA-mandated nap sounds quite nice.”Also Read: Who is Sam Bird’s girlfriend Jess Impiazzi?

Training local marshals at Formula E circuits

Safety and technical knowledge are paramount in Formula E, where the sport involves handling some of the world’s fastest electric cars. Now, the FIA has given fans a behind-the-scenes look at how local marshals in each host country are trained before every Formula E race to ensure that operations run swiftly, efficiently, and to the highest standards.A video shared on the FIA Official Instagram page features Benoit Dupont, Head of Circuit Operations at FIA Formula E, offering a glimpse into the marshal training process at the Jakarta E-Prix.Speaking about the preparation in Jakarta this year, Dupont explains, “Before each Formula E race, we make sure that marshals are trained to the correct level to understand how to efficiently remove and recover a car. It's very important to have precise and fast operations. We've been in Indonesia before, but it was two years ago, so the goal here is to bring everyone back up to speed.”He adds that Formula E cars require a specific method of being lifted, particularly using a strap in a defined way. As a result, every post is trained individually to ensure marshals are fully up to date.Dupont also highlights the crucial role of the clerk of the course, who acts as a bridge between FIA officials and local marshals.He says, “Leaving a legacy is an important part of what the FIA brings to these races. There are international procedures that might not be followed at local races, so we ensure they meet the latest standards. That’s why we conduct training sessions like this,” he says. “The clerk of the course connects with the marshals, all the trackside personnel, and the recovery team. Since they communicate in their local language, the clerk ensures the communication line remains as efficient as possible.”Commenting on the video, one Formula E fan wrote, “Well done on showcasing these wonderful men and women who keep races going and clear up the mess after an OOPS moment from the drivers.”Also Read: Dan Ticktum shares unfiltered pictures and a note after Jakarta win, mentions losing F1 chance: “It wasn’t down to my attitude” The Jakarta E-Prix was a single-header this year, unlike its double-header format in the 2023 season. With just four more races remaining, the 2024–25 Formula E season is nearing its conclusion. Next up is the Berlin double-header on July 11–12, followed by the season finale in London on July 26–27.","FIA gives fans a behind-the-scenes look at how local marshals in each host country are trained before every Formula E race.

The Tokyo E-Prix (Round 9) also broke records in Japan, registering the highest-ever Formula E TV audience in the country — a 20 percent rise over Season 10’s numbers on Fuji TV.Digital audiences have also shown notable growth. Data from Emplifi revealed a 13 percent increase in social video views and a 12 percent rise in engagement, underscoring the vibrant and interactive fan community that continues to grow around the sport.Commenting on the surge in popularity, Formula E CEO Jeff Dodds said, “The latest figures from our external providers are truly phenomenal and show the tremendous momentum behind the growth of our sport. They highlight that not only do we have world-leading technology and acceleration in the cars, but that it’s producing some of the best, most competitive racing that both old and new fans can’t get enough of.”“We’re building fan bases and loyalty in key and emerging markets, with Mexico and the US as prime examples of how our investment and long-term presence are paying off. As the world’s fastest-growing motorsport, we know we can’t stand still. We must continue delivering the best racing, the best rivalries, and the most inclusive events to maintain our steep growth trajectory and strengthen our community of electric super fans,” he added.Also Read: Dan Ticktum shares unfiltered pictures and a note after Jakarta win, mentions losing F1 chance: “It wasn’t down to my attitude” The current season of the ABB FIA Formula E World Championship began in Sao Paulo in December 2024 and will conclude in London at the end of July 2025.

Nyck De Vries pens a post after Jakarta race



Nyck De Vries of Mahindra Racing has finally spoken up after his controversial race at the Jakarta E-Prix, where he received a ten-second time penalty for hitting Andretti’s Jake Dennis just moments before the race ended. Both were aiming for the podium, but the collision ended their chances of gaining any points or a podium finish. In his latest post on Instagram, De Vries summed up the race day and also mentioned his teammate Edoardo Mortara for his much-awaited podium.Nyck De Vries shared a heartbreaking picture of himself sitting dejectedly with his back to the chicane. He wrote along with it, “Unfortunate end to a good day. P3 in qualifying, leading the race, 6 seconds gap, 7 laps to go, forced to retire the car. Overall a positive weekend, a great podium by @edomortara and good performance all round. Proud of our team. Terima kasih (thank you) Jakarta.”His fans, however, refused to leave his side and showed their support in the comments section. One fan wrote, “Terimakasih for trying your best Nyck. Rooting for you for the remainder of the season! We can’t change the past but we can come back stronger! See you in Berlin.” Another said, “You did great, Nyck! Keep your chin up.”One more fan commented, “Man..... I was rooting for you. Come back stronger next year.” A comment also read, “Nyck, you did super amazing and you will win 100% very soon.

Dan Ticktum bares his feelings after maiden Formula E win



Dan Ticktum’s fans hail him for his unfiltered note



Dan Ticktum shared several memorable pictures from race day and the victory celebration after winning his maiden Formula E race in Jakarta. He penned a long note on his breakthrough win and, true to his unapologetic self, the Cupra Kiro driver didn’t mince words while opening his heart to fans on Instagram, along with a bunch of pictures. He reflected on the time when he was taking baby steps in Formula 1 but had to quit the field amid controversies.Dan Ticktum’s note comes just days after his first-ever Formula E win, following his victory at the Jakarta E-Prix and the traditional champagne bath on the podium. Starting from the very beginning, he wrote, “So there it is, first win in @fiaformulae in the books. I am immensely proud of what this great team of people have achieved this year. As some of you know, I was very close to being in F1 several years ago, but due to some political s****, it wasn’t meant to be. (For those too ignorant — no, it wasn’t down to my attitude). I was ready to give up racing, as at the time, my dream — to me at least — was over.”Moving to his switch to Formula E, he added, “However, an opportunity arose to take part in this exciting, relatively new championship, full of the best drivers in the world.@alexhuigusto and @russellohagan were instrumental in giving me this opportunity, and they, along with the rest of the team, have stuck by me during three very tough years being the least funded team on the grid. This year, with our new investment, it has enabled us to embark on an exciting new chapter with @porsche.motorsport and @cupra_official. The support from them has been immense.”He further wrote, “Long story short — I’m glad I didn’t give up and kept trying to pursue big things in motorsport. The @fiaformulae championship, and @jeffformulae in particular, have given me an environment where I can be me (mostly), and I can finally say that this year I’m enjoying my job again. Thank you to everyone who has supported me to this point. I know it’s only one race win, but it conjured up a lot of emotions for me personally, along with my father and family, who sacrificed so much. Plenty more to come, I hope. Onto Berlin!”Posting pictures of himself showing middle fingers to the camera, he added at the end, “P.S. Last 2 slides are for all those who doubted me.”IndyCar racer Louis Foster reacted to his post, saying, “Mega mega mega mate.” There was also a congratulatory message from the FIA Formula E page. Social media star Juca Vipari wrote, “YESSSSS BROTHER! The first of many!!”A fan also told Ticktum in the comments section, “Enjoy 1 million beers.” Another said, “A fight-or-flight mode and you chose the harder option with an EXTREMELY high reward — and it paid off! Congrats Dan! The first of many.” One more added, “So deserved. Thinking from the end of last year to where you and the team are now — seriously amazing work.

There’s then a glimpse of the garage, which smells like “focused rubber and podium energy.” He even has his own name for media day, which he calls “Smile until your face hurts.”It’s also revealed that Da Costa sits with the engineers to understand the data – and he actually gets it. As he suits up in his race gear, it’s said to be “30 percent style and 70 percent sweat.” The video also offers a close look at his Porsche electric car, which he races in the Formula E Grand Prix this season.His fans loved the fun video and called it “awesome”.

Sergio Aguero takes on the race track in a GEN3 Evo



All about GEN3 Evo Sessions

Manchester City star Sergio Aguero is one of the few chosen ones to get a chance to drive a Formula E car on a race track. The footballer had his own GEN3 Evo session, guided by none other than TAG Heuer Porsche driver Pascal Wehrlein. And Aguero nailed it by driving the electric race car like a pro, although he missed his engineer’s message to slow down to cool the tyres.Sergio Aguero got the opportunity to drive the Porsche 99X Electric GEN3 Evo Formula E car during Miami’s Evo Sessions on March 5 and 6. The video from his Evo session is pure entertainment, as he takes lap after lap, clearly enjoying the thrill of driving a race car.Earlier, the official handle of FIA Formula E shared a video from Sergio’s Evo Session on Instagram. It showed how the footballer missed the messages to slow down and continued at high speed despite the need to cool the tyres. He later asked them to raise the volume and eventually slowed down. Pascal Wehrlein was seen doing a great job coaching him over the radio.The 37-year-old told Formulae.com about the opportunity, “This is absolutely crazy: from footballer to racing driver in one of the fastest racing cars in the world.Every child is familiar with Porsche. The brand represents an iconic heritage, particularly in motorsport. I am absolutely delighted and would like to thank everyone involved for this unique opportunity.”Aguero and other participants underwent detailed training, which included simulator sessions, physical conditioning, driver coaching, hardware customization, and engineering briefings. It not only gave them the thrill of driving a race car but also gave viewers insight into the intricate world of Formula E — how a driver is trained and how the car is driven during a race. A complete documentary will be released later this year, showcasing the entire Evo Sessions footage.Sharing his reaction when Formula E CEO Jeff Dodds first presented the idea, he said, “The initial reaction when I presented the concept of ‘Evo Sessions’ to our teams and partners was, ‘This is wild!’ — which is when I immediately knew we had to bring it to life. We wanted to do something that has never been done before in motorsport; something that would give audiences and our fan base a unique perspective into the world of a Formula E driver, through the eyes of some of their favourite online personalities. ”He added, “Formula E is the fastest-growing motorsport in the world, and we have a clear target to hit half a billion fans by 2030. Through collaborating with some of the biggest names in popular culture right now, we’re able to open up Formula E to a whole new fanbase.”Also Read: Pascal Wehrlein on second place in Shanghai: “First time I felt like we were very competitive in the wet” Even the trainers are among the best Formula E drivers in the world.

(AP)

Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel.

London: It’s the last Monday of June and the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club throws open the doors to its hallowed courts for the start of the 138th edition of the Wimbledon championships, the oldest tennis tournament in the world, at 8 am.Action starts at 11am sharp at all the outdoor courts (Centre court with defending champion Carlos Alcaraz and Fabio Fognini has a later 1.30pm start). Of interest here is that there is no Court 13! Attendance at the end of Day1 topped 40,000 people.And what an eventful day it turned out to be. The first championship without line judges saw AI-generated voices calling out the “out.” It took a few minutes to get used to an unseen human voice calling out the line calls with the right inflection. No more being thrown out of a tournament for accidentally hitting a line judge like Novak Djokovic at the US Open in 2020. No more screaming and swearing at them like vintage John McEnroe.And then, as it should, tennis took centre stage. Seeds fell – Daniil Medvedev (No 9 seed); the flamboyant Stefanos Tsitsipas retired and reigning champion, Carlos Alcaraz, just about survived a thrilling five-setter with Italian Fabio Fognini in temperatures that touched 33 degrees at one point.While everyone loves a good underdog story, nobody, not the spectators, nor the organisers would have wanted the current poster boy of tennis to exit in round 1.Watched by a packed royal box with David Beckham (Sir David after his recent knighthood) and his mum in the front row and actor Eddie Redmayne in the row behind, for Alcaraz it was not the procession most expected it to be.Four-and-half hours later, the match was a testimony to the crowd’s forever appreciation of the underdog; how to play your last match at Centre Court and how to summon your champion’s nous at just the right time to finally close out a match.Fognini, a contemporary of Federer, Murray and Djokovic, played brilliantly. His ground strokes silken smooth, his anticipation on Alcaraz’s serves, early and shot making of the highest order. Sixteen years older than his opponent he looked like he could barely move between the games but between points he was all over the court. Alcaraz, chasing a hat-rick at Wimbledon, seemed uncharacteristically nervous with his game peppered with double faults, poor first serves and plenty of unforced errors.When it was all over some four-and-half hours later, Fognini got a standing ovation he will remember forever and Alcaraz showed why he’s a hugely popular athlete. He stood on the court applauding Fognini and kept pointing towards him egging the crowd to acknowledge the brilliant match he had just played. Not that the crowd needed reminding.The packed centre court was dressed for an Indian summer – the unrelenting sun on those in seats facing the umpire meant that a spectator fainted leading the match to be paused for a short while.Flowing calf-length skirts were the dress of choice. While some men were brave enough to turn out in jackets and tie the overpowering heat meant shirt sleeves were the order of the day.As Wimbledon modernises and moves ahead with rapid technological changes some things stay the same. Press is not to applaud good play! One is censured if you are caught cheering or clapping in the press box. On the outside, open courts, there are just two rows of wooden benches on either side of the court. Of these, two are reserved for the players’ coaches and family. Which basically means you have to watch these matches mainly standing.

Poll Was Carlos Alcaraz's performance in his first-round match concerning? Yes, he struggled too much No, he still won

Carlos Alcaraz was forced into deep waters on Day 1 of Wimbledon 2025, battling past veteran Fabio Fognini in an epic five-setter to begin his title defence. The two-time defending champion looked far from his fluent best but still managed a 7-5, 6-7(5), 7-5, 2-6, 6-1 win after four-and-a-half hours of momentum swings on Centre Court.The 22-year-old Spaniard, fresh off his Roland-Garros triumph, committed 62 unforced errors and faced 21 break points in a match that tested his endurance and focus. “Vamos!” Alcaraz roared after breaking Fognini early in the final set — a set in which he finally regained control, sealing his 19th straight win in style.Aryna Sabalenka, meanwhile, made a confident start in the women’s draw. The top seed brushed aside Canadian qualifier Carson Branstine 6-1, 7-5. Sabalenka, who is seeking her first Wimbledon title after finishing runner-up at both the Australian and French Opens this year, credited recent practice sessions with Novak Djokovic and Jannik Sinner for helping her “understand and adjust better” to tough shots on grass. The Belarusian faces either Lulu Sun or Marie Bouzkova in the second round.In the biggest upset of the day, ninth seed Daniil Medvedev was sent packing by France’s Benjamin Bonzi in four sets.The 2023 semifinalist and former US Open champion is now out in the first round of back-to-back Slams, following a similar early exit at Roland-Garros. Despite his struggles, Medvedev brushed off concerns, saying he’s “not that worried… yet.”Elsewhere, Stefanos Tsitsipas retired hurt during his first-round match against French qualifier Valentin Royer, citing a back issue. The Greek star had won just 43% of his first serves and struggled with movement before calling time early in the second set.One of the day’s most exciting storylines came from Brazilian teenager Joao Fonseca. The 18-year-old, playing his first Wimbledon main draw match, impressed with a 6-4, 6-1, 7-6(5) win over local wildcard Jacob Fearnley to become the youngest player since Alcaraz in 2021 to reach Round 2 at SW19.Day 1 delivered drama, resilience, and a reminder that at Wimbledon, nothing comes easy—even for champions.","Carlos Alcaraz beat Fabio Fognini 7-5, 6-7(5), 7- 5, 2-6,6-1.

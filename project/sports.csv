IPL 2025: What went wrong for Lucknow Super Giants?

The Indian Premier League has finally entered its playoff stage - belatedly and dramatically. After 70 matches of explosive batting, tense finishes and unprecedented off-field events, four teams are left in contention for the crown.At the heart of the league stage were two polarising narratives: the astonishing rise of 14-year-old Rajasthan Royals’ prodigy Vaibhav Suryavanshi, who smashed the second-fastest IPL century of all time; and the steep fall of Lucknow Super Giants’ Rs 27 crore gamble, Rishabh Pant , who failed to inspire with the bat and leadership.Adding to the chaos, the season was suspended mid-way due to armed conflict near the India-Pakistan border, raising concerns about player safety. With such a volatile mix of brilliance, heartbreak and drama, IPL 2025 delivered an unforgettable league phase.IPL 2025’s league stage belonged as much to fearless youth as it did to flailing veterans. The undisputed star was Vaibhav Suryavanshi, a 14-year-old sensation from Rajasthan Royals who smashed a 35-ball century, finishing with 252 runs from seven games.Other breakout stars included Priyansh Arya, who hammered a century for Punjab Kings, and promising knocks from Ayush Mhatre (Chennai Super Kings) and Prabhsimran Singh (PBKS), adding youthful flair to the league.In contrast, Pant, the IPL’s costliest player at Rs 27 crore, failed to justify the price tag. With just 269 runs from 14 games and questions swirling around his captaincy, Pant’s campaign ended in disappointment. Meanwhile, MS Dhoni’s mid-season return to captaincy failed to revive a sinking ship as CSK finished last for the first time in IPL history.It was a season of extremes - blistering highs on the field, jarring interruptions off it. Sunrisers Hyderabad bookended their campaign with explosive totals: 286/6 against RR and 278/3 against Kolkata Knight Riders, with Heinrich Klaasen’s unbeaten 105 sealing their final league win. But inconsistency plagued their middle stretch, and underwhelming bowling efforts kept them from finishing higher.Even bigger than cricket was the border conflict, which halted the league after shelling was reported during a PBKS vs Delhi Capitals match in Dharamsala. Air raid sirens, overnight evacuations and trains shuttling players to safety forced a pause in play. The temporary suspension led to Mitchell Starc’s early exit, citing safety concerns, marking an unprecedented moment in IPL history. Mumbai Indians made the most thrilling charge of the season. After losing four of their first five, they won six on the bounce to storm into the playoffs. Hardik Pandya’s captaincy, Suryakumar Yadav’s consistency and Jasprit Bumrah’s 17 wickets in 10 matches made the difference.Gujarat Titans were less dramatic. Anchored by Sai Sudharsan’s 679 runs - earning him an India call-up - and Shubman Gill’s steady leadership, GT sealed their playoff spot without looking rattled.Royal Challengers Bengaluru created history, becoming the first team to win all seven away matches in an IPL season. With Jitesh Sharma captaining late in the season and smashing an unbeaten 85 in a record chase of 228 against LSG, RCB head into the playoffs with unmatched momentum.Based on their track record, PBKS were this year’s overachievers. Led by Shreyas Iyer and coached by Ricky Ponting, they showcased grit, defending the lowest total of the season (111 vs KKR) and punching above their weight. Their blend of youth and discipline pushed them into the playoffs as the table-toppers.CSK endured a forgettable season. The return of Dhoni as captain couldn’t mask issues: Ravindra Jadeja and R Ashwin underperformed, while overseas picks like Hasaranga failed to deliver. Young talents like Dewald Brevis and Mhatre offered late hope, but the campaign was too far gone.RR, stripped of stars like Jos Buttler, Yuzvendra Chahal and Trent Boult, struggled to stay afloat. Injuries and inconsistency plagued them, but Suryavanshi’s emergence gave their fans a glimmer of future glory.LSG began strong but faded fast. Despite occasional brilliance from Mitchell Marsh, Nicholas Pooran and Digvesh Rathi, the team lacked depth and clarity. Pant’s underwhelming leadership and their bowling unit’s failure to deliver under pressure left them out of the top-four.KKR, the defending champions, were a shadow of their 2024 selves. Ajinkya Rahane stood tall with gritty batting, but Venkatesh Iyer’s failure and strategic confusion saw KKR slump to five losses in their first eight games - never quite recovering.DC, too, saw a steep drop. Having led the table early, they lost five of their last eight. Mitchell Starc’s exit post-Dharamsala, a misfiring middle order and the lack of a match-winning spinner derailed a campaign that had promised much more.As the playoffs begin, the narrative shifts from resurrection to redemption. Can MI’s momentum, GT’s balance or RCB’s road dominance carry them all the way? Or will PBKS, underdogs-turned-warriors, script a fairytale finish?","The Indian Premier League has entered its playoff stage.

Poll Should cricket captains always back their bowlers in controversial run-out situations? Yes, it boosts team morale and unity No, sportsmanship should take precedence

RCB vs PBKS, IPL Qualifier 1: Quick Singles from Mullanpur | Indian Premier League

WHAT EXACTLY HAPPENED

IPL 2025: What went wrong for Delhi Capitals?

WHAT THE RULE SAYS

NEW DELHI: Former India spinner Ravichandran Ashwin, who has been under scrutiny himself since the controversial run-out of Jos Buttler in IPL 2019, stood firmly in support of Lucknow Super Giants bowler Digvesh Rathi on Wednesday. Speaking on his YouTube channel, Ashwin dissected the incident involving Rathi’s attempt to dismiss Royal Challengers Bengaluru’s stand-in captain Jitesh Sharma at the non-striker’s end during their IPL 2025 clash in Lucknow.""As an owner of LSG, I will be thinking that I need Jitesh Sharma's wicket. If he has stepped outside the crease, he is out. Now let me dive into the technicality of the incident. Is he justified in being out if he stepped outside the crease before Digvesh Rathi got into the delivery stride? Yes. Would it be bad for RCB? Yes, again, because they would not have liked Rathi or Pant if they did that. Now let's look into the real-case scenario. When Rathi landed his front foot, Jitesh was inside the crease. So, this was not out. After breaking the stumps, umpire Michael Gough asked him whether he was appealing, and not whether he was sure. He said, 'Yes, I'm appealing.' So the decision went to the third umpire, and the right decision was made,"" Ashwin explained.However, what happened after the decision left Ashwin furious. The cameras showed LSG skipper Rishabh Pant withdrawing the appeal and embracing Jitesh, an act the commentators hailed as a great display of sportsmanship. Ashwin strongly disagreed with that narrative.""Until now, everything was right. But after that, commentators started saying that Pant has withdrawn the appeal - what an amazing act of sportsmanship. Grow out of this. Pant is a fantastic cricketer. He scored a stunning century, and I know he will go on to do great things in cricket. I am already looking forward to the England series just to see how he will bat and help India win. I am a big fan of Pant. I'm clarifying it yet again before being targeted by people. But think, you are the father of Rathi, and his captain, in front of crores of people, criticised him. He actually went over the board. A captain's job is to back the bowler and not make himself feel small,"" Ashwin added.The incident took place in the 17th over of Rathi's spell. With Royal Challengers Bengaluru needing 29 runs off the final 19 balls, Rathi attempted to run Jitesh Sharma out at the non-striker's end.He paused before delivering the ball and removed the bails when he spotted Jitesh stepping out of his crease.Rathi went on to appeal for the dismissal. However, the third umpire, after reviewing the footage, ruled that the bowler had already completed his delivery stride and crossed the popping crease. The decision of 'not out' was flashed on the big screen. Simultaneously, LSG captain Pant also withdrew the appeal and hugged Jitesh, a moment that was widely praised as an act of sportsmanship. Nonetheless, Pant’s gesture had no bearing on the outcome, as the appeal was already invalid under the rules.According to MCC Law 38.3.1: ""At any time from the moment the ball comes into play until the instant when the bowler would normally have been expected to release the ball, the non-striker is liable to be run out...""Further clarity is provided in subsections 38.3.1.1 and 38.3.1.2, which state that the non-striker can be dismissed only until ""the moment the bowler's arm reaches the highest point of his/her normal bowling action in the delivery swing.""",Ravichandran Ashwin defends Digvesh Rathi after controversial run-out. Rathi attempted to run out Royal Challengers Bengaluru captain Jitesh Sharma. But third umpire ruled that Rathi had already completed his delivery stride. LSG skipper Rishabh Pant then withdrew the appeal and embraced Sharma. The move was hailed as an act of sportsmanship.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121467844,imgsize-44382,width-400,resizemode-4/121467844.jpg"

India Test squad vs England: Ajit Agarkar full press conference

The Indian income group is much higher compared to the average income group in the USA, so there's a spending capacity there Hemant Dua

New Delhi: Seattle Orcas CEO Hemant Dua believes USA's win over Pakistan in the 2024 T20 World Cup has played a pivotal role in helping cricket get its first foot in the door. The win helped USA cricket take a significant initial step towards achieving a goal, which, in the bigger picture, is to make the sport popular in a country where it is in unchartered territory.""Cricket has grown overall. It was always on the straps for very long here, but it was more at the amateur level in the USA. The cricket board has gone through a lot of challenges. I think off late, ICC started investing in it and seeing cricket in the USA as the frontier they want to conquer,"" Dua told TimesofIndia.com.""The 2024 World Cup came, it did really well and had a huge impact from an economic point of view. It helped cricket to a certain extent definitely because USA beating Pakistan was like a dream come true for the USA guys; it helped the growth of cricket,"" he said.Dua says with Major League Cricket (MLC) successfully entering its third season, the next goal is to get cricket into the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) so that the sport will be in the mainstream.""Largely, cricket is played by South Asians and a little bit of the Commonwealth population like the English, South Africans, and all those. It hasn't really gone into the mainstream as yet, and the challenge remains: how do you make it a growing mainstream sport, especially focused on youth and colleges,"" he said.""In the US, unlike other parts of the world, if you're not part of the college system, the sport really doesn't grow. You know, because college sport is the base of growth here for everything, right? So that's how all sports kind of grow in that direction. Once you become part of the NCAA, you grow automatically; that is how sports grow.""Ideally, this should be the next step, but it's a combination where everyone will have to come on the same platform. When I say everyone, I mean USA Cricket, MLC, Minor League Cricket, all have to come on the same platform, and one of the biggest challenges for becoming part of college sports is Title IX. Title IX means you've got to have equivalent or some form of women's cricket playing, right? Without women's sport, you don't get recognition.""In my region, which is the Pacific Northwest, there are girls playing regularly, so we're trying to grow. I mean, there are various leagues that have come up at U-19 and U-16 levels for boys and girls both. The boys' sport is growing, but it's small numbers,"" he said.With cricket finding a place at the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics, Dua is hopeful that most of the MLC franchises will have their own cricket stadium, and it will take cricket to the next level.""What will make a huge impact is now when all six teams will have their own stadium ready. It is part of the contract with MLC that each team will build their stadium by 2028. With the Olympics happening in 2028, there is going to be some noise where people will get to know about the sport more,"" he said.For the expansion of cricket in the USA, the franchises are also banking on targetting the Indian population.""If you look at the population, approximately 20 million South Asians live in the USA. It is a pretty significant number. Indians have the highest net worth individuals. The Indian income group is much higher compared to the average income group in the USA, so there's a spending capacity there. So can we tap into that, can we tap into that dream?"" he said.Dua, who has been part of the Delhi Daredevils (now Delhi Capitals) for ten years since the inception of the Indian Premier League (IPL) in 2008, admitted that all six franchises are currently making losses, but he strongly believes that the MLC as a product is sustainable in the larger scheme of things.""Everyone's making losses in the MLC now. Even in the IPL, for 10 years, everybody made losses until the 11th year broadcast contract came on the floor,"" he said.""I strongly believe that MLC is sustainable. As I said, everything depends largely on the media contracts. Right now, we are on Willow, which is a streaming platform, so we're opening up new markets. In each region, I have tied up with a regional sport network along with Willow. We've opened up with Root and Fox 13; we're going to relay our matches similarly in other regions.""These are obviously not going to help us make money, but the idea is to ensure that more people get to see the game. For the first time now, Amazon has also done a deal, so they'll broadcast the Sunday night games on Amazon. It's opening up, but I think the real test will come when the new broadcast contract comes in, and whoever takes it, whether it's Willow or whether it's another channel or whoever it is, takes up and depending on what value that generates, that will tell you in which direction we are actually moving.

Shubman Gill story: From a remote village near the border to India’s Test captain

Poll Should Priyank Panchal have been given a chance to represent Team India? Absolutely Maybe, but he had his chances No, he wasn't consistent enough

Gujarat batter Priyank Panchal 's decision to retire at 35 caught the cricket fraternity by surprise, including the state team's captain Chintan Gaja and other teammates. ""I got to know about Panchal's retirement after he revealed it on Instagram,"" said Gaja. Gujarat opener Aarya Desai similarly learnt about the decision on Instagram, admitting that the call left him surprised.""Nobody knew. We had no indication before he sent an email to the Gujarat Cricket Association (GCA) on the previous day in the evening. There was a sense of expectation that Panchal would play his 100th Ranji Trophy match in the upcoming season,"" said Gujarat Selection Committee chairman Kirat Damani during an exclusive interaction with TimesofIndia.com. Panchal took a leaf out of MS Dhoni's playbook, keeping his decision under wraps till the end with a quiet and unexpected announcement.The Gujarat batter bows out of the game with an impressive tally of 6,992 runs in 99 Ranji Trophy matches. Panchal finishes as the state's second-highest run-getter, scoring just 19 runs less than Parthiv Patel's tally of 7,011 runs. The 35-year-old accumulated 8,856 runs in 127 first-class matches, slamming 29 hundreds and 34 fifties, with an unbeaten 314 marking his highest score.However, even this mammoth tally of runs failed to earn Panchal a Team India debut, with the cricketer ending his career as an 'almost there' player.The batter smashed 1,310 runs during the 2016/17 Ranji Trophy season, helping Gujarat win the tournament. Panchal's performances resulted in his selection for India-A squads on multiple occasions, emerging as an impressive captain. The 35-year-old first got an opportunity with the Indian team after being picked for an away Test series against South Africa in 2021-22. Panchal was also selected for a Test series against Sri Lanka in February 2022. However, the batter didn't get a chance to feature in the lineup. It was in such tough situations that Panchal, who idolises Rahul Dravid and draws inspiration from Ricky Ponting, showcased his character.""An anecdote I recall showcasing his mentality was when Panchal missed out on a chance to replace Cheteshwar Pujara in an away series against England, due to an injury. I thought he'd be extremely gutted. Panchal said, ''I've worked very hard. If I was destined to get that chance, I would've got it'. His maturity and grit astonished me,"" said Damani.""The one thing that stood out very early was his ability to learn from seniors and eagerness to improve. Panchal would show up season after season with thorough professionalism without letting the disappointment of non-selection for the Indian team affect his mentality,"" added Damani.Panchal faced questions regarding his capabilities during the 2024/25 edition of the Ranji Trophy, which marked his last tournament. The cricketer was under pressure before the team's semi-final against Kerala, considering his lack of big runs. ""He was unable to convert starts. However, we were confident of his capabilities,"" said Gaja.Kerala scored 457 in their first innings, tiring out the Gujarat fielders by making them field for over two and a half days. Gujarat needed to cross Kerala's run tally in a game set to be decided based on the first-innings lead. Desai and Panchal stitched a 131-run partnership, putting the opposition under pressure. ""We were very tired after fielding for two and a half days. Priyank told me to keep attacking. He even cautioned me when he felt I was being too casual, urging me to not lose focus,"" said Desai.Panchal maintained the intensity following his fellow opener's dismissal, scoring with intent. The batter let out a roar after scoring a century, leaving teammates and friends stunned, considering his quiet nature. The Gujarat cricketer continued to fight despite an injury on his left index finger. ""The top hand plays a dominant role. Fingers on the left-hand are always vital for a right-handed batter,"" said Panchal.Ex-Gujarat cricketer Dhruv Raval said he's never seen his former teammate celebrate in such an aggressive manner. ""It was very unexpected. It is extremely unfortunate that one of India's best domestic players failed to represent the nation,"" he added. ""Priyank was very determined to help Gujarat reach the final. His celebration showed that there was a lot going on inside,"" stated Gaja.Panchal was eventually dismissed for 148, bowing out of the game on an astounding note. While the cricketer emerged as a solid run-scorer, he was also the ultimate teamman. ""Panchal guided me a lot with technical issues, motivating me during my initial matches. His discipline is top-notch. I will certainly remember him for that,"" said Gujarat all-rounder Jaymeet Patel.","Gujarat batter Priyank Panchal's decision to retire at 35 caught the cricket fraternity by surprise.

More Than a Team: The Rise of CSK & the Whistle Podu Army

The third edition of South Africa’s premier T20 franchise league, SA20, has delivered record-breaking numbers across attendance, broadcast and digital platforms, firmly establishing itself as one of the most followed live sporting events in the country.The 2025 season witnessed unprecedented crowd engagement, with over 400,000 fans attending matches across six venues. A 70% surge in sold-out fixtures, including a full house for the final for the third year running, marked SA20 Season 3 as the most attended edition to date. MI Cape Town's home ground, Newlands, etched history by selling out all five of its home games—a first in the League’s short but growing legacy.One of the season's standout moments came during the clash between Joburg Super Kings and Sunrisers Eastern Cape at the Wanderers, where the league celebrated selling its one millionth ticket.Fan satisfaction remained sky-high, with 93% of attendees rating their stadium experience as ""excellent"" and 90% expressing a keen interest in returning for Season 4.On the broadcast front, Nielsen Sports SA reported a 47% rise in viewership on SuperSport, with the opening match between Sunrisers Eastern Cape and MI Cape Town becoming the most-watched season opener in league history.The grand finale saw a 72% increase in local viewership compared to the previous season, as MI Cape Town clinched the title.The league’s international appeal also soared, with global viewership—spanning India, the UK, the US, and Pan-African regions—jumping by 37%. These numbers cement SA20’s status as one of the most prominent T20 franchise leagues outside India.SA20 also thrived in the digital arena. The league registered a 62% growth in social media followers, an 87% spike for franchise accounts, a 93% boost in video views, and a staggering 233% rise in website traffic from the previous season.This growing popularity translated into significant media traction. The league saw a 30% rise in media value in South Africa and a remarkable 96% increase in India. Print media coverage also surged by 231%.Reflecting on the season’s success, League Commissioner Graeme Smith said: “Season three of the SA20 has been an absolute game-changer. This is the third year running that we have seen unprecedented growth across broadcast, attendance and digital platforms. We have really made a mark as one of the leading sport and entertainment brands in the country. Globally, our numbers continue to increase and support our vision of being the biggest T20 cricket league outside of India.”Season 3 also underlined SA20’s commitment to youth development. Through its learnership programme, the league offered hands-on experience to 26 young professionals, including participants from the Laureus YES (Youth Employment in Sport) initiative and photography students.In its partnership with the Laureus Sport for Good Foundation, SA20 raised R630,000 to support programmes aimed at helping youth tackle societal challenges like poverty, homelessness, and substance abuse.The season also saw the successful launch of Schools SA20, a first-of-its-kind grassroots initiative featuring over 600 participating schools, including a debut girls’ competition. The final showdown at Cricket South Africa's High Performance Centre crowned Steyn City School (Johannesburg) and Bishops Diocesan College (Cape Town) as the inaugural girls’ and boys’ champions, respectively. In a boost to youth education and sport, two promising Grade 7 cricketers received full scholarships to the winning schools.“The positive impact off the field is equally important and rewarding for us as the League,” Smith added.“The Schools SA20 was an excellent platform for the next generation in its debut season and will no doubt continue to give hundreds of young cricketers around the country opportunities.”","The third edition of South Africa’s premier T20 franchise league, SA20, has delivered record-breaking numbers. Over 400,000 fans attended matches across six venues. A 70% surge in sold-out fixtures, including a full house for the final for the third year running, marked SA20 Season 3 as the most attended edition to date.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121468341,imgsize-18024,width-400,resizemode-4/121468341.jpg"

IPL 2025: What went wrong for Delhi Capitals?

Poll Who do you think was the standout performer for Delhi Capitals in IPL 2025? KL Rahul Faf du Plessis Karun Nair Tristan Stubbs

Delhi Capitals' season in the 2025 IPL did not go as planned. After an impressive start to the campaign, the Axar Patel-led side faltered towards the end of the league stage, and missed out on the playoffs. However, as the league stage comes to a close, DC mentor and former Delhi and Royal Challengers Bangalore player Kevin Pietersen 's tweet manages to salvage something from the Delhi-based franchise’s disappointing season.A recent tweet by the 44-year-old has been making rounds on social media, where he admits that something strange has happened to him. Recounting his journey with the team, Pietersen said that being part of DC's dressing room has 'ignited a flame' inside him.DC's batting line-up featured the likes of KL Rahul, Faf du Plessis, Karun Nair, Abhishek Porel and Tristan Stubbs, all who put up notable performances in the initial rounds. KL Rahul in particular, took center stage on several occasions, with his century against Gujarat Titans and three half-tons in the tournament. Despite his heroics, DC failed to breach the top four, and missed out on a playoff spot by one point as they ended the season in fifth.Pietersen's message on X is an allusion to the side's batting prowess, as he admits wanting to take up the bat again. ""Being inside the dressing room with Delhi this IPL, it has actually ignited a flame in me to bat again. A childhood feeling - really strange.""Pietersen, announced as DC mentor in February, was trusted with taking a promising DC side to the playoffs and possibly, the title. However, the fact that DC had one of the best starts to the season up until the defeat to Mumbai Indians which derailed their season, remains undismissable.The 44-year-old has 1001 runs from 36 IPL matches and has donned the jerseys of Delhi Daredevils, Royal Challengers Bengaluru, Sunrisers Hyderabad, and Pune Warriors India during his IPL career.","Delhi Capitals' season in the 2025 IPL did not go as planned.

Haider Ali. (Image: Special Arrangement)

Born in a small village in Pakistan where cricketing facilities were nonexistent and education was prioritised over sport, Haider Ali 's path to the UAE national team was anything but conventional. He never played age-group cricket, worked as a night-time waiter, sold fruits during the pandemic and even survived a near-fatal accident that almost ended his career.Yet, he never gave up. Today, at 30, the left-arm spinner stands tall as one of UAE cricket's most promising cricketers, having played a pivotal role in their historic T20I series win over Bangladesh and shining in franchise cricket with Dubai Capitals in ILT20.Haider Ali's journey to international cricket is the stuff of Bollywood dramas — minus the glamour. Born in a remote village (Kamalia Azmat Shah) in Pakistan, Haider was never meant to be a cricketer. There were no playgrounds, no nets and most importantly, no permission. His uncle, who raised him, made it clear: no cricket until you pass your Matric (Class 10) exams. That meant missing all formative cricket — school, under-14, under-16.""I came from a very small village which had no facilities.My uncle, who took care of me and my education, did not allow me to play,"" Haider told TimesofIndia.com. ""He used to say that first you have to clear the matric exam… after that I won't stop you.""Once he graduated, he left for Lahore — five hours away — on a one-way ticket to chase his dream. He found a cricketing home at Ludhiana Gymkhana Club, under the guidance of Akhtar Mumtaz. Days were for cricket. Nights were for survival.""I used to work as a waiter in the night time and during the day I played cricket and exercised in the gym. My family didn't know anything… they only knew that their son was playing cricket in Lahore,"" he said.Then came COVID. Marriage halls shut, jobs vanished and Haider became a fruit seller. Yet, cricket remained.""I worked (for) almost four years as a fruit seller, but I did not leave my cricket. I kept practicing my skills, because cricket is my passion and my father's dream.""But tragedy struck again — a life-threatening accident. He fell 30 feet from a bridge when an overloaded auto-rickshaw toppled while transporting fruits.""The auto fell down… I broke my shoulder, leg, nasal bone and others. But I am very lucky, God has given me a second life,"" he said.Most people told him it was over. ""A lot of big cricketers, including Test players, told me that 'your career is over.' But I didn't believe them. I had worked too hard and believed that God would give me my result.""Haider's belief pushed him to take the most painful step yet — leaving home and Pakistan. With just 10 Pakistani rupees in his pocket (barely 1 Dirham), he flew to the UAE, tears in his eyes, for a better future.""It's a very emotional topic for me,"" he said, his voice cracking. ""When I was leaving, my mom was crying… my dad too. I told my mom that I will return only after making you all proud.""He found initial support in the Seven Districts cricket team, especially from its owner Muhammad Haider and his father Amir Ali. ""We are not in touch now, but they gave me everything in the first two and a half years here,"" he acknowledged.Today, Haider represents Karwan Cricket Club — one of UAE's premier sides — and credits Babar Iqbal for his continued growth. Even in Dubai, the grind hasn't stopped. His routine reflects his obsession.""My day starts at 3:30 am. I go swimming, then practice. I sleep a bit, then wake up around 2-3 pm and train again — bowling and fielding drills in 45 degrees Celsius. Then I go to the gym. I don't care what others are doing. I work when no one is watching except for God.""On May 21, 2025, Haider Ali etched his name in UAE cricket folklore. Playing a pivotal role, the 30-year-old left-arm spinner took 3 for 7 in four overs, helping UAE clinch their first T20I series win over a Test-playing nation — Bangladesh — in Sharjah.It wasn't just a series win. It was validation.From being a waiter and fruit-seller in Lahore to taking key wickets against a full-member nation, Haider has proven everyone wrong — except himself.""I always believed that God would give me my time. As the Almighty always says: you do the hard work, and leave the result to me.""","Haider Ali is one of UAE's most promising cricketers. The left-arm spinner was born in a small village in Pakistan.

Shubman Gill story: From a remote village near the border to India’s Test captain

Poll Which player do you think is key for Gujarat Titans' success in IPL 2025? Shubman Gill Rashid Khan Sai Sudharsan Gerald Coetzee

Having played this IPL season for the Gujarat Titans under the captaincy of Shubman Gill , South Africa's pace bowling allrounder Gerald Coetzee has a fair idea of the 25-year-old's leadership style.Describing his experience of playing under Gill, who is now India's Test skipper, Coetzee said in an online interaction organized by GT on Tuesday, ""Under Shubman, it's just been excellent. He's cool. He's calm. But he also stands up for the players. He performs as a captain. So, those are all good qualities he has as a captain. He's reasonably young. So hopefully, you know, as he keeps playing for India, he's already a world-class player. If he becomes a world-class captain, I mean, that'll only be to the benefit of Indian cricket.""Coetzee admired the way Gill handled the bowlers, including himself, at GT. ""I think there's a good balance. I think he allows the bowler to express what he's thinking. And if he feels something different, there will be a very short discussion and then a decision would be made, which I think is a really good quality for a captain.You want the bowler who is bowling the ball to set his field. But the captain also is the main leader. So, he might have a tactical idea. And that's how there's a short conversation and a decision is made. So, the clarity has been good. I think he's excellent when it comes to that department.""For someone who was a part of the South African Under-19 team back in the 2018 Under-19 World Cup in New Zealand, Coetzee had a fair look at Gill's talent in that tournament. Gill scored 372 runs in six matcxhes at an average of 124.00, with three fifties and a hundred to play a stellar role in India's triumph on that occasion. ""Yes, I do remember Shubman. It's hard to forget that Indian Under-19 team. They were so good. I think Shubman had an average of 99 or 100 so it would have been impossible to look past him in that World Cup! Not much more. I think he did as well as you would expect in that World Cup. There's not really much more to say. I think when they won, there weren't really any surprises there,"" praised the 24-year-old.Coetzee was obviously pleased for his GT teammate Sai Sudharsan, who received his maiden India call-up for the upcoming five-Test tour of England. ""I've spoken to him, congratulated him, he definitely deserved it. I think he is going to be, he already is a world-class batter. And I think he's only going to get better. He is so good. So, very exciting for Indian cricket.""One factor which could worry GT is that their ace leg-spinner Rashid Khan hasn't delivered this year according to his massive reputation. In 14 matches in IPL 2025, Rashid has taken just nine wickets at 53.66, conceding 9.47 runs per over. Dismissing concerns around Rashid's poor form, Coetzee said, ""No, not really. We see the way he trains. Rashid's done what he's done for years. I don't know how many players in the world have more T20 games than him with the numbers and the stats he has. We have full confidence in someone of that class to find his strides. I think (that) he hasn't bowled badly. He has had some good performances (in) this tournament. It's all part of the game. He is one of the best in the world and no one doubts that.Going into the IPL-2025 playoffs, the South African feels that GT have the team to win the tournament. ""We have as good a chance as anyone. I think we've played really well. We've got a really good, consistent team. And I think if we just keep playing that same brand of cricket in the play-offs, on any given day, anything can happen. But we definitely have a team that should be able to win this tournament,"" Coetzee said.He didn't seem too concerned by GT suffering back-to-back defeats for the first time in IPL-2025, losing their last two league matches at home in Ahmedabad to Lucknow Super Giants and then Chennai Super Kings, asserting that his team had a ""blueprint to win games."" ""No, I don't think it'll be a challenge. I think we have our blueprint. We know what we have done to win games. I know we know what we did wrong when we didn't win these games, and we also have to give credit where other teams played well. We also have to look at where we made some mistakes, and you just take that into the next game. We have played against all these teams we are about to play against. We know what they're going to bring. I think our chances are very good of kicking on till the final, hopefully winning this tournament,"" Coetzee stressed.He was confident that with plenty of experienced campaigners in their side, the Gujarat Titans would be able to deliver under pressure in the knockout stage of the IPL this year. ""We are very confident. The reason we come to this tournament is to win. And I think most athletes enjoy playing under pressure. So, we've got World Cup winners in our team. We've got guys who have done well under pressure through their career. We're very excited for the opportunity. We understand the difficulty of what we want to achieve, but it's not daunting. We're excited for the opportunity,"" Coetzee said.He pointed out that the Gujarat Titans qualified for the play-offs as they are strong in all the departments. ""The strength is the players and the coaching staff. I think we just have been consistent. We have a well-balanced side. And we play well together as a team. I think everyone chips in. We obviously have had some great contributions. Whenever you have players in contention for purple cap, orange cap, I mean, that is gold. And then when you have other guys playing cameos, helping to win games, I think that's a great combination for a winning team,"" he concluded.",Gerald Coetzee played for Gujarat Titans under captain Shubman Gill. South African says Gill's leadership style has been excellent. Coetzees also praises Sai Sudharsan for his maiden India call-up. Says GT have a good chance of winning the IPL-20 playoffs.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121459526,imgsize-132044,width-400,resizemode-4/121459526.jpg"

Everything is special about Vaibhav Suryavanshi: Vikram Rathour

Mumbai: Former Australia captain Steve Waugh isn’t usually glued to the TV during the IPL , especially since matches air late at night in Australia. But the emergence of 14-year-old Vaibhav Suryavanshi was enough to make even the legendary Aussie batter sit up and take notice.“I don’t get to watch a lot of IPL games because it’s probably the wrong time of the day for us. But when someone like that comes along, you want to watch the game — he’s a fantastic attraction for the sport,” the 59-year-old said.Suryavanshi made headlines with a blistering 35-ball century (he eventually scored 101 off 38 balls) against Gujarat Titans, the fastest IPL hundred by an Indian.“I watched that century and I just couldn’t believe how well he struck the ball, how effortlessly he was hitting sixes, and how relaxed he looked. At 14, he had no concept of pressure… just played with complete freedom. It was great to watch. I guess the challenge for him now will be to keep it all under control,” Waugh said during a media interaction alongside Anil Kumble, Matthew Hayden, and Robin Uthappa at the launch of the ‘Australian Summer of Cricket 2025-26,’ organised by Cricket Australia and the Australian Government.In what was a sensational debut season for Suryavanshi with Rajasthan Royals , the aggressive left-handed opener racked up 252 runs in seven matches at a phenomenal strike rate of 206.56.“Can he continue to play with the same enthusiasm and freedom? That’ll be his challenge. He’s got the skills, he’s mentally tough, and he’s got a great backstory — you want someone like that to succeed. It’s a great story for cricket, even for someone like me watching from far away,” Waugh added, referring to the well-documented sacrifices made by Suryavanshi’s parents.However, Waugh cautioned against comparing the young phenom to Sachin Tendulkar , who debuted in Tests at age 16 in 1989.“I don’t think you can compare anyone to Sachin Tendulkar. I mean, a 16-year-old (actually 18) coming to Australia and scoring a century in Perth, on the hardest, most unique pitch in world cricket where most players struggle, was a freakish performance. It’s very rare that someone like Sachin comes along. But then again, I never expected a 14-year-old to score a century in the IPL. That was unthinkable,” Waugh said.One of the most successful Test captains in history, Waugh also commented on how Indian teams no longer seem “intimidated” when touring Australia.“They’re well-travelled, experienced, and used to different conditions. The intimidation factor isn’t what it was 10 or 20 years ago. India have won two Test series recently in Australia, and frankly, they often have more crowd support than Australia,” Waugh observed.",Vaibhav Suryavanshi made his IPL debut for Rajasthan Royals in May.

Chhetri’s return bad news for Indian football: Venkatesh,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/chhetris-return-bad-news-for-indian-football-venkatesh/articleshow/121448497.cms,"Venkatesh Shanmugam

CHENNAI: Back in 2005, as the India captain, Venkatesh Shanmugam had urged a fading senior to step aside so that an eager 20-year-old Sunil Chhetri could get his chance. It was a bold call then. And now, with Chhetri stepping back onto the international stage after ‘retirement’, Venkatesh voices a deep-seated disappointment. The man who once cleared the path for Chhetri is left wondering why Indian football isn’t doing the same for those waiting in the wings.“Two decades ago, I told a senior player to hang up his boots so a young Sunil Chhetri could rise,” Venkatesh, who is currently the technical director at FC Madras, told TOI. “But now, Chhetri breaking his retirement to come back is bad news for Indian football. It’s demotivating for all the young players. I’m not blaming Chhetri. He will play only one or two matches. But if you bring a youngster and back him now, he will give 10 years.“Indirectly, we are sending a message to everyone that we don’t have players. We are seeing that a lot of grassroots programme have come and there are a lot of tournaments. Still, we are depending on the 40-year-old striker?”Venkatesh, a former assistant coach of the India senior team, didn’t mince words on the chaos surrounding head coach Manolo Marquez, who had a dual role while coaching FC Goa and the national team.“We are going 20 years back,” the star midfield of his time bluntly said. “We have done this before. We failed when Armando Colaco was coach for both Dempo and the national team (in 2011). We have to bring a permanent coach. I respect all the coaches, including Manolo. But which coach will think about Indian football and take risks for it? That’s a big question.”Venkatesh, who holds an AFC Pro Licence, explained the differences between coaching a club and steering a national team and how each demands a separate mindset and level of commitment.“Thanks to the ISL (Indian Super League), they brought a lot of attention to football in India. But when you play in the ISL, the Indian players will play only against four foreigners. When we go for international games, you have to face eleven foreigners. The temperament is completely different. You can’t compare ISL and international football. Tomorrow, if you play against a team like Korea, you need solid preparation. It’s true Manolo has done well as an ISL coach and that’s why AIFF thought he knew Indian football well. But international football is something different,” said Venkatesh.So, what’s the way forward? For Venkatesh, it starts with looking beyond the obvious. “I feel this is high time that Indian football bosses think seriously about building a second layer. There has to be a Team ‘A’ and a Team ‘B’. Fill Team B with young players, give them time and space to grow. The only thing that separates a star from the rest is opportunity. And when there’s pressure for places in the first team, it naturally brings out the best in players,” the 46-year-old said.Venkatesh is optimistic about the current bunch of Indian players. “I can see that the current Indian players, in terms of technique and physicality, are very strong. If you see all the players, all the positions, you can see aggression. Indian football is more aggressive now,” said Venkatesh.Venkatesh also pointed out that there is a lack of a proper bridge between youth and senior levels. “I feel we should concentrate more on the under-21 category, then only you will get a strong core for the future. There’s a big gap post the under-19 level. Players are jumping straight into the senior team without proper progression. The under-21 level is the backbone of Indian football,” he said.",Venkatesh Shanmugam says Indian football needs to build a second layer. The former India captain is disappointed by the decision of Sunil Chhetri to return to the national team.

Shubman Gill story: From a remote village near the border to India’s Test captain

More Than a Team: The Rise of CSK & the Whistle Podu Army

Chelsea were once one of Europe's most well-run clubs under their former owner Roman Abramovich, with a focus on shrewd transfer dealings and value creation. There was specific emphasis on signing proven campaigners, which paid off handsomely, with the Blues winning two Champions League titles as well as five Premier League trophies. However, Abramovich was forced to sell the club to a consortium led by American billionaire Todd Boehly, turning things upside down. Financial wisdom went out the window, with players purchased at immensely extravagant sums. A recent UEFA report stated that Chelsea spent almost two billion euros in transfer fees from 2020 to 2024, terming the club's 2024 squad as ""the most expensive ever assembled.""Close to 39 transfers have been completed in just two years, resulting in fans and experts terming the decision-making ""madness."" Boehly's stint drew controversy early on following the decision to sack the club's 2021 Champions League-winning manager Thomas Tuchel. The billionaire picked ex-Brighton manager Graham Potter as a replacement, which failed miserably, as Chelsea finished 12th in the 2022/23 season after a third-place finish. Former Tottenham Hotspur manager Mauricio Pochettino also failed to transform fortunes, leading to yet another managerial vacancy.While pundits expected Boehly to re-appoint Tuchel, the billionaire took an unprecedented decision by handing over charge to ex-Leicester City manager Enzo Maresca at the start of the 2024/25 season. The decision seemed quite brazen, considering Maresca had no formal Premier League experience as a manager. While the transfer merry-go-round continued under Maresca, with 11 new players signed including Jadon Sancho, the Italian manager developed a robust system around young and hungry players.Maresca faced a tough start to his stint, as the Blues conceded easy goals in friendlies and suffered a loss in their opening PL match against Manchester City. However, the Italian took a leaf out of his former boss Pep Guardiola's playbook by retaining self-belief amid pressure. Moises Caicedo, Enzo Fernandez, Cole Palmer, and Levi Colwill formed the core of the setup, with Maresca placing trust in Nicolas Jackson despite the striker's inexperience. There was also heavy focus on versatility to catch the opposition unawares, with full-backs Marc Cucurella and Malo Gusto inverting into midfield.""Maresca picked the two best players for every position with emphasis on versatile players like Gusto who can play either as a right-back or a central midfielder,"" said Spanish football manager Mario Rivera.Chelsea dominated proceedings in the season's first half with fast, fluid, and explosive football, smashing goals for fun. While Palmer had already developed a reputation as a game-changer, emerging players like Noni Madueke also made their presence felt, as evident from the latter's 14-minute hat-trick against Wolves.""The main tactical change in the Chelsea setup is the numeric superiority in the central channel. While attacking, they operate in a 3-2-2-3 formation with four midfielders, offering greater control. The high-press system gives Chelsea a chance to play far off the goalpost with much more balance for transitions,"" stated Rivera.Chelsea were well in contention for the league title until December after jumping to the second spot, resulting in fans chanting, ""We have our Chelsea back."" However, injuries to crucial players like defender Wesley Fofana and Jackson, as well as Mykhailo Mudryk's long-term suspension, impacted results over a crucial two-month period, pushing Maresca into a spot of bother. While experts stated that opponents had figured out the Italian's gameplay, there were also question marks over the system's intensity, resulting in fatigue.Three wins in 12 matches between December 22 and February 22 pushed Chelsea to sixth place, resulting in heavy criticism over the quality of recruitment. However, Maresca's 'band of brothers' kept marching on, with Champions League qualification coming down to their final Premier League match against Nottingham Forest — who had been brilliant themselves. Colwill stepped up in this crucial encounter, vindicating the Italian manager's faith by scoring the winner.Maresca's brilliance enabled Chelsea to qualify for the Champions League for the first time since Boehly's takeover, recording the feat with the youngest average line-up in Premier League history — 24 years and 36 days. ""The doubt was from outside. Critics were saying that we were not able to win because we are too young and inexperienced. F**k off to all of them,"" said the Italian manager in a no-holds-barred retort after a league season which has revived Chelsea's flagging fortunes.","Chelsea were once one of Europe's most well-run clubs, with a focus on shrewd transfer dealings and value creation.

In Formula E, a double-header means double the thrill—and fans make sure they don’t miss a moment. Taking place over a weekend, these back-to-back races offer spectators twice the action, twice the drama, and twice the excitement.

Here’s a look at the elite few who have pulled off this rare feat:Nicolas Jean Prost, better known as Nico Prost, became the first-ever driver in Formula E to win both races of a double-header weekend.

Representing DS Techeetah, he clinched victories during the first of three double-headers in Berlin in 2020. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the final six races of the season were held in Berlin, making da Costa’s consistency even more remarkable.Jaguar TCS Racing’s Mitch Evans had a slow start to the 2022 season, scoring just one point from the first three races.

Stoffel Vandoorne shares their strategy for Tokyo race

It cannot be just a coincidence that Maserati MSG Racing driver Stoffel Vandoorne started from the 14th position on the grid and went on to win the Tokyo E-Prix Round 8. He even managed to beat Nissan’s Oliver Rowland, who had started from pole. Vandoorne shined while others struggled with poor visibility, a slippery track, and grip issues as it rained cats and dogs during the Tokyo race. Not only that, he also recovered from a spin on the wet track to cross the finish line first. The Tokyo winner says it’s all because of how their plan fell in place to perfection.Stoffel Vandoorne revealed that their winning strategy involved a calculated risk of taking the Pit Boost early in the race, which could have worked in their favor if there had been a race stoppage, allowing them to save time during the gap.""It was not an easy race, but a lot of opportunities with the rain and the management. We kind of gamble a little bit with our strategy but it was also calculated at the same time. The plan perfectly played in our hands, and the chances of this happening in Formula E are very, very slim,” Vandoorne told Formula E in an interview.""It was difficult because I had to manage so many things. I was on the radio with my engineer in between laps and he was giving me advice on the gap that I had to Oliver (Rowland) to make sure I was safe enough with my energy.I was struggling, and I was down to 10% at some point and I had to bring the car home so there was a lot of management to do,"" he added.Vandoorne moved to Maserati MSG Racing last season and is in love with his new team. Talking about the same, he said, ""I’m just happy for the team, for myself, it’s been a little while. They are such a good group of people, some familiar faces from the past as well, their vibe is super cool, their base is Monaco and that is my home as well.

I was looking forward to the race being over, to be honest, and when it was over... when I saw her face I just couldn't help but be super emotional.""[The atmosphere] was amazing.

I knew I was just going to get one chance, and I had to make it count. I think there was about a car's-width gap, and it closed as I was in it! I think I was touching the wall and him at some point.

eigning champion Carlos Alcaraz overcame a minor blip to reach the French Open third round on Wednesday as women's title rivals Iga Swiatek and Aryna Sabalenka made short work of their opponents.Second seed Alcaraz came through 6-1, 4-6, 6-1, 6-2 against Hungarian Fabian Marozsan to earn his 17th win in 18 matches on clay this season.""Second set, he started to play better and he didn't miss a lot so it was a little bit difficult to deal with his game,"" said Alcaraz.""I'm really happy I stayed strong and refreshed myself. In the third set, I started to play better and better which helped me have a really good last two sets.""Alcaraz, a four-time Grand Slam winner, goes on to face Bosnian journeyman Damir Dzumhur for a place in the last 16.In the women's draw, Swiatek continued her bid for a fourth straight Roland Garros crown as she outclassed fellow former US Open champion Emma Raducanu.The Pole beat Raducanu 6-1, 6-2 to make it five wins in as many meetings with the Briton. She racked up her 23rd consecutive victory at Roland Garros to improve her career record at the tournament to 37-2.Swiatek is bidding to become the first woman to win four consecutive French Open titles since Suzanne Lenglen 102 years ago.The 23-year-old arrived in Paris under a slight cloud, having not reached a WTA final since lifting the Coupe Suzanne Lenglen last year, but has made serene progress through the first two rounds.""Honestly, I just love playing here. This place inspires me and that makes me work harder,"" said Swiatek, who also captured the trophy as a teenager in 2020.The fifth seed will play Romania's Jaqueline Cristian for a place in the last 16.Swiatek's slide down the rankings has left her in the same half of the draw as world number one Sabalenka, last year's runner-up Jasmine Paolini and Olympic champion Zheng Qinwen.Sabalenka shook off a sluggish start to blow past Switzerland's Jil Teichmann.After dropping serve early in the first set, Sabalenka won 11 of the final 12 games to power to a 6-3, 6-1 win.""It doesn't matter what the scoreboard says, she really made me work for every point,"" said Sabalenka, who has conceded just five games through two rounds.The Belarusian has never reached the French Open final and is hoping to banish the memories of a painful quarter-final loss to Mirra Andreeva in 2024.Paolini moved into the third round as she brushed aside Ajla Tomljanovic 6-3, 6-3 to stretch her winning streak to eight matches following her triumph at the Italian Open.The fourth seed from Italy advances to play Ukraine's Yuliia Starodubtseva.Zheng punched her ticket to the last 32 with a 6-2, 6-3 win over Colombia's Emiliana Arango.The Chinese star faces another Grand Slam debutant in the next round, 18-year-old Victoria Mboko of Canada.Other seeds to progress included former Wimbledon champion Elena Rybakina, Elina Svitolina and Amanda Anisimova.Jelena Ostapenko, the 2017 French Open winner, rallied to win in three sets, but Russian 11th seed Diana Shnaider lost to Ukraine's Dayana Yastremska.Twice former French Open runner-up Casper Ruud was the biggest casualty on Wednesday, crashing out in four sets to Portugal's Nuno Borges.Seventh seed Ruud won the first set against world number 41 Borges but was hampered by a knee injury as he slumped to a 2-6, 6-4, 6-1, 6-0 defeat.""I actually felt it quite early in the first set,"" said Ruud, uncertain whether he would be fit for Wimbledon. ""It's hopefully nothing too serious.""There were no such problems for in-form Italian eighth seed Lorenzo Musetti, who raced past Colombian lucky loser Daniel Elahi Galan 6-4, 6-0, 6-4.Musetti has reached at least the semi-finals in all three Masters 1000 events on clay in 2025. He will next play Argentina's Mariano Navone.Stefanos Tsitsipas, the 20th seed, suffered his earliest French Open exit in seven years as the 2021 runner-up lost in four sets to Matteo Gigante.The Italian qualifier goes through to face Ben Shelton, who received a walkover as Hugo Gaston pulled out with an injury.Denmark's Holger Rune, the only man to beat Alcaraz on clay this year in the Barcelona final, beat American wild card Emilio Nava 6-3, 7-6 (7/5), 6-3 in the night match.",Second seed Carlos Alcaraz beats Fabian Marozsan to reach French Open third round.

In all sports, there are advantages to being at home. At the French Open tennis tournament, being a visitor playing against a French player can feel as though the whole world is against you.The crowds don't just cheer. They boo, they whistle, they make noise between serves, they hurl insults - and, at least once, even gum - at the locals' opponents. That sort of behaviour is why the tournament organisers banned alcohol from the stands last year, a policy still in place.Some of the non-French athletes who deal with that sort of negativity in Paris, such as 19-year-old Jakub Mensik of the Czech Republic, who eliminated Alexandre Muller in front of a rowdy crowd at Court 14 on Tuesday, compare the high-intensity atmosphere to that of a soccer game.Others choose stronger terms.One player says French Open fans can be 'disgusting' ""Disgusting. Worst experience of my life,"" was what Nicolas Jarry of Chile said this week when asked to think back to last year's rowdy loss at Court Simonne-Mathieu to France's Corentin Moutet, whose coach had implored the spectators to make life ""hell"" for Jarry after the two had a contentious meeting in Santiago earlier in the season.Jarry blamed that on Moutet, saying that everything was calmer during his loss Monday to another Frenchman, Arthur Fils, whom the Chilean called a ""good guy"" and a ""gentleman.""""It's a battle out there, you know. Sometimes, it's not just a battle with the player,"" said Novak Djokovic, who is scheduled to face the irrepressible Moutet in the second round Thursday.Expect an antagonistic atmosphere. Djokovic sure does. Roland-Garros spectators can be 'louder and more passionate' ""They're going to have the crowd on their side. It's nothing strange about it. It's expected,"" the 24-time Grand Slam champion said. ""But it is true that here in France and in Paris, comparing to other Slams, the people are louder and more passionate and just give more support, louder support, more energy to their player, which for some (opponents) can be annoying. It's not the kind of ideal environment you want to be playing in, but you have to be ready for it. ""So much for the supposed silence usually found in a tennis arena. It all raises questions about where the line between support and incivility lies.""We've stepped up security,"" tournament director Amelie Mauresmo, a former No. 1 player, said before this year's event, ""and given chair umpires greater power to intervene and report unacceptable behavior in the stands.""For Mensik on Tuesday, the jeers began every time he hit the ball during the warmup ahead of his 7-5, 6-7 (5), 7-5, 6-3 win over France's Muller. More arrived once play began, accompanying each of his 20 aces or just when he simply walked to check a ball mark - a routine part of clay-court tennis.After taking the third set, Mensik gave the boo birds a little bit back, waving his right index finger as if it were a baton conducting an orchestra, a move he learned from Djokovic.""Sometimes,"" Mensik said of the crowd, ""it is too far.""Still, there are those who shrug it all off.Some players say the rowdy crowds in Paris are just part of tennis ""That's part of tennis, especially here. My opponent had her fans here; I have mine in Belgium. It's normal,"" said Elise Mertens, the 24th-seeded Belgian who was a semifinalist at the 2018 Australian Open and lost Tuesday to Lois Boisson of France at Court 14. ""Fans were loud but not insulting. I didn't feel any particular hostility.""There are two sides to the loud backing French players receive.It ""makes you feel like you could reach for the stars,"" said the highest-ranked French woman, Varvara Gracheva, who acknowledged that support also can become a burden.She lost in the first round Tuesday.25 years since a Frenchwoman won the French Open, 42 since a man did It's been a quarter of a century since a woman representing the host nation won the singles title at the French Open ( Mary Pierce in 2000) and even longer since a man did ( Yannick Noah in 1983).""As French players, we're under pressure all the time when we play here"" said Moutet, currently ranked No. 73. ""When you lose, you 'suck.' When you win, you're 'King of the World.' So you have to try to ignore the pressure.""Nathan Fhima, an 18-year-old high school student from Paris, figured his compatriots needed his voice. So there he was this week at Roland-Garros, waving a blue-white-and-red French flag and screaming himself hoarse while skipping class to watch qualifying and first-round matches.""We have to push them, because not much will happen otherwise,"" he said after watching France's Diane Parry lose Monday. ""Maybe that noise will lift a homegrown champion to victory again. We have to believe.""","Crowds boo, whistle, hurl insults - and, at least once, even gum - at players.

Paris: Novak Djokovic – the 24-time major winner, three-time French Open champion, and most importantly Olympic gold medallist – walked out onto Court Philippe Chatrier on Tuesday to a swell of warm memories, an unforgettable triumph, a golden summer. “The emotions were really nice. Last time I was here playing was in the final of the Olympics,” he said. “Of course, I did relive those memories that were wonderful.”Paris ironically wore a different look on Tuesday, dark and dank, but the 38-year-old Serbian, who arrived on court in a long-sleeved undershirt, briefly battled the conditions more than his opponent American Mackenzie McDonald, before settling down to a score a 6-3, 6-3, 6-3 win in a shade under two hours.The former No.1, seeded six this year, appeared to be pressing for the roof to be closed.Djokovic called the conditions in Paris very different from Geneva, “with the wind, rain and everything that was happening.”“I was asking if and when they are going to make a decision to close the roof, and how long we will have to play (this way). It was pouring and affecting the court as well.The court was damp and there were a lot of bad bounces,” Djokovic said of his exchange with the chair umpire.“The first information I got was that they decided to wait. And so, I asked who is ‘they’ and where are ‘they’? The chair umpire said that it’s the supervisor and others,” he said, adding, “It was quite confusing, because on the radar they were seeing that it was going to stop, but it didn’t look like stopping.“At one point the supervisor told me, they’re playing everywhere on the outside courts in the same conditions. I said, yeah, but we are on the court with a roof. Why do you have the roof then?” Djokovic said.Djokovic, who claimed his 100th Tour-level title in Geneva on Saturday, joining Jimmy Connors and Roger Federer in an elite club, was back on court three days later, kicking off his campaign for what he hoped would result in a 25th Major title.","Novak Djokovic beats Mackenzie McDonald in first round of French Open. Serb wins 6-3, 6-2, 7-6 (7-4) in under two hours. Djkovic won his 100th Tour-level title in Geneva on Saturday.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121457242,imgsize-131888,width-400,resizemode-4/121457242.jpg"

Mirra Andreeva’s morning alarm may have gone off at 6.40 am, but it wasn’t until she was almost half-way through the first set of her French Open opening-round clash against Spain’s Cristina Bucsa that she responded to that shrill ringing.The 18-year-old, who listed the details of her morning schedule to Alex Corretja, the former world No. 2 turned courtside interviewer, also put down the time she had allotted for each task. It included 35 minutes to pack her bag and get ready, 25 minutes for breakfast and 11 minutes in the locker room, before she got 30-40 minutes on the court with a hitting partner. She didn’t particularly enjoy 11 am starts, Andreeva, the world No.6, later told Russian media.Andreeva, bright-eyed and irreverent, who won six of the final seven games of the first set to clinch a 6-4, 6-3 win in 82 minutes, plays 21-year-old American Ashlyn Krueger in the second round on Thursday.It wasn’t the best of days for Andreeva’s compatriot Daniil Medvedev, who like the teenager too doesn’t like early morning starts. Medvedev, 29, a former No.1, seeded 11 at Roland Garros this year, led 5-3 in the fifth set and was within three points of the match, but saw Briton Cameron Norrie claim four successive games and a 7-5, 6-3, 4-6, 1-6, 7-5 win on Court Simonne-Mathieu.On a day when the skies threatened and the mistral was playing to a particularly harsh note for a spring day in May, spectators layered up and players looked to control their game in conditions that called for patience and perseverance.It was not about playing to a plan, rather about the fight to pursue an end. Andreeva, who walked out onto the Court Suzanne Lenglen in a tea-length skirt, which she wore over her match gear, took her time striking rhythm.The world No. 6, who won two WTA 1000 titles this year in Dubai and Indian Wells before she blew out 18 candles on her birthday cake a month ago, wouldn’t classify herself as a player who is particularly sensitive to conditions, testing or otherwise.“I don’t really feel the difference. If it’s cold, I suffer a little bit more to warm up and be ready to run for every point. I don’t feel the difference when either it’s hot or it’s cold,” she said, adding, “Conchita (Martinez, her coach) tells me sometimes, ‘Now it’s cold, so you have to do this, you have to do that.’ I’m like, ‘Well, okay, it’s cold. I don’t really feel the difference.’”World No. 2 Coco Gauff, who walked on court with her kit bag sans her rackets, which were later ferried from the locker room after she rummaged through the bag, however, produced forceful tennis for a 6-2, 6-2 win over Aussie Olivia Gadecki.The 21-year-old American’s outfit scored with her play on a day when the double-fault count totalled to 13 (seven Gauff and six Gadecki). Gauff’s dress in muted greyish-blue tones matched the sky on the day, fitted bodice that flowed into a pleated hem that fluttered with the wind. Gauff paired the dress with a black leather jacket which was the mood of the day.“I knew the kit that I was wearing because we try it on. They gave me the leather jacket this week and I was like, ‘Oh, wow, that’s fire!’” she said. “I talked to them (New Balance) about how I always wanted to spice up my walk-on outfits. I was pleasantly surprised with it. I think it’s cool. I feel like it matches the Parisian vibe here, and it just makes me feel super powerful going onto the court.”","Russia's Mirra Andreeva beat Spain's Cristina Bucsa 6-4, 6-3 in the first round of the French Open on Tuesday.

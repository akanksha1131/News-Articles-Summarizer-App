Poll Which boxer’s performance impressed you the most at the World Boxing Championships? Jaismine Lamboria Nupur Pooja Rani Minakshi

NEW DELHI: Liverpool witnessed a landmark moment for Indian boxing on Saturday night as Jaismine Lamboria stormed to gold in the women’s 57kg category at the World Boxing Championships 2025, defeating Olympic silver medallist Julia Szeremeta of Poland in a gripping final. Adding to India’s glory, Nupur clinched silver in the women’s +80kg division, rounding off one of India’s finest campaigns on the world stage.Jaismine’s bout against Szeremeta began under intense pressure, with the Polish boxer — roared on by a large local contingent of supporters — taking the early initiative. However, the 24-year-old Indian regrouped brilliantly in the second round, using her superior reach and sharp counterpunching to wrest control of the contest. She never let go thereafter, sealing a 4-1 split decision victory and India’s first gold medal of the tournament.“This feeling can’t be expressed in words, I’m so happy to be a world champion,” an emotional Jaismine told Olympics.com. “After my early exit at Paris 2024, I worked hard on both my technique and mental strength. This medal is the reward for a year of relentless dedication.”While Jaismine’s triumph sparked celebrations, India’s medal tally grew further when heavyweight boxer Nupur battled valiantly but fell short in the women’s +80kg final against Poland’s Agata Kaczmarska.In a tightly fought contest, Kaczmarska, shorter but aggressive, neutralized Nupur’s height advantage by fighting at close quarters. The Polish boxer landed a decisive punch in the dying seconds to edge out Nupur 3-2 on split decision.Earlier in the day, Pooja Rani secured a podium finish, signing off with a bronze after a gritty semifinal battle against England’s Emily Asquith. India’s campaign was already historic, with three women boxers — Minakshi (48kg), Jaismine (57kg), and Nupur (80kg) — reaching the finals for the first time ever.","Jaismine Lamboria wins gold in women’s 57kg category at the World Boxing Championships 2025.

TimesofIndia.com in Dubai: India’s preparations for their high-voltage Asia Cup clash against Pakistan suffered a scare on Saturday when opener and vice-captain Shubman Gill was struck on the hand during training.The 26-year-old, who has been in fine touch, immediately winced in pain and dropped his bat as the ball thudded into his right hand. The team physio rushed to him and he soon walked off the pitch, still clutching the sore spot. Gill sat on the ice box with a worried look, holding his injured hand while the physio kept a close eye on him.Captain Suryakumar Yadav and head coach Gautam Gambhir checked on him, while close friend Abhishek Sharma stayed by his side throughout. Abhishek even helped him open a water bottle as Gill tried to ease the discomfort.The concern didn’t last long. Gill was back in the nets minutes later, showing no hesitation as he had a long hit against both pace and spin. By the end of the session, he even took time to meet Abhishek’s father, who was present at the ground, and walked back to the dressing room with a smile.With Gill back in rhythm at training, India will hope their vice-captain is fully ready when they take on Pakistan in Dubai on Sunday night. The stage is set for one of the biggest games of the Asia Cup, and Gill’s presence at the top could prove vital in shaping India’s fortunes.","India's vice-captain was struck on the hand during training.

NEW DELHI: Back in 2018, when Gukesh Dommaraju and Divya Deshmukh were barely 13, they shared more than just a chessboard.In a now-viral clip from those early days, Divya asks Gukesh, “How much Hindi do you know?” To which the boy wonder tosses a deadpan reply, “Zero!”Though Divya’s instant reaction is to roll her eyes in mock disbelief, she would soon slip into the role of a translator, turning Gukesh’s English analysis into Hindi for a chess platform's Hindi channel, and in the process win over millions on social media.Seven years on, the setting could not have been more different. Amid the architectural splendour of Samarkand in Uzbekistan, the two prodigies, now Grandmasters (GMs) in their late teens, met again on Friday - except they didn't speak a word between them for hours at end.But this time, at the FIDE Grand Swiss, Gukesh, rated 2767, was the reigning World Champion and Divya, rated 2478, the Women’s World Cup winner. It was their first-ever clash in a classical format and also a reminder of how far Indian chess had come, and how blurred the lines between “male” and “female” boards have begun to look.“The eighth-round game between Gukesh and Divya Deshmukh in the FIDE Grand Swiss ended in a hard-fought battle after 103 moves,” GM Pravin Thipsay told TimesofIndia.com while analysing the game.“Divya chose a very unusual continuation on her fourth move (4…Be7). Apparently, Gukesh didn’t know this line because he took 17 minutes for his fifth move.""Although he had lost a lot of time, the opening choice of Divya doesn’t really look very sound, and White does get some very good technical edge.It was very dangerous to play such a position against Gukesh. In fact, I would never have thought that. And by move 12 or 13, Gukesh was already with a good sound advantage by advancing the queenside pawn (12.a5).”Yet, the youngest-ever world champion, undergoing a poor run of form at Grand Swiss this time, let his chances slip.“Gukesh chose a completely different plan to play on the kingside, and with 15.Bxf4, he opened up the game on the other side. As a result, all his advantage was gone, and we had roughly equal position,” explained Thipsay.“Later, Divya's decision to exchange Queen on move 19th didn't seem to be very good, and again Gukesh had the upper hand. But on 23.Nd2, Gukesh somehow didn’t find the right square for the knight, and that reduced the advantage. The game was thereafter into a very complex situation when nothing much was happening.”“Gukesh’s placement of the knight and the rooks after 28 moves turned out to be really bad and unproductive. And Divya, for the first time, got an advantage by move 30. It was a slight tangible advantage in an endgame, probably not enough to win, but she was better,” the 66-year-old GM continued.“A repetition could have taken place by move 40, but Gukesh refrained from repeating the moves and sacrificed a pawn. The rest of the game became a dead position, with Gukesh trying to set traps. Divya gave up a knight for the last pawn and got into an obvious rook-and-knight versus rook position, which is a theoretical draw.”For Thipsay, Gukesh is having his ""worst phase"" after a poor run of results, including three defeats, in the Grand Swiss.“This entire year has been quite bad. Hardly any event has passed where he hasn’t lost rating. So one can say this is probably the worst phase in Gukesh’s life since 2021.”It is a sobering assessment for the youngest World Champion. Once hailed as unstoppable, Gukesh now sits outside the top 10 in the live ratings, his 2748.2 mark dropping him to 12th place.For Divya Deshmukh, however, the draw was more than just half a point.“Women players rarely get consistent chances against 2600+ opposition,” Thipsay opined. “For her, tournaments like these are about exposure, practice, and proving herself. She has played with great spirit, and this result will give her confidence.”Gukesh, on the other hand, was never playing for qualification. Already holding the World Championship crown, he had no Candidates’ slot to chase. “He's only playing for practice and to expose himself to the elite players,” said Thipsay.But practice or not, every half-point surrendered has its cost.As the players shook hands after six and a half hours of play, there was no winner, yet no shortage of drama. With three rounds left, the tournament can still swing either way, “bad to worse” for Gukesh, or “good to better” for Divya.For now, the headline writes itself: The World Champion is out of the top 10. And the hand that nudged him down belongs to an old friend who once teased him about Hindi.",Gukesh Dommaraju and Divya Deshmukh faced off in the classical chess format for the first time at the FIDE Grand Swiss.

Real Madrid secured a 2-1 victory against Real Sociedad in Saturday's Spanish league match, led by Kylian Mbappé who scored one goal and assisted another, despite playing with 10 men for nearly an hour. Meanwhile, Atletico Madrid earned its first season win before their Champions League clash with Liverpool, and Athletic Bilbao suffered a defeat ahead of hosting Arsenal.Mbappé demonstrated his scoring prowess in the 12th minute, capitalizing on a poor Sociedad pass to score his fourth goal of the season.

Mbappé's skillful dribbling near the byline created space to find Arda Guler, who converted the opportunity into Madrid's second goal.Sociedad narrowed the gap in the 56th minute when Oyarzabal scored from the penalty spot, awarded after the ball hit Dani Carvajal's arm in the area.""The red card changed the game a bit. We struggled a bit as a team, but we take home the three points,"" Mbappé said.""Our start to the season has been very good, as has mine.""Madrid maintained their perfect start to La Liga with four wins in four games. They now lead Barcelona by five points, with Barcelona set to face Valencia on Sunday.Coach Alonso mentioned that Huijsen, a summer signing from Bournemouth, was ""angry but relieved"" that his dismissal didn't cost the team points.In other matches, Atletico Madrid defeated Villarreal 2-0, with Nico González scoring on his debut after joining from Juventus on loan. Pablo Barrio opened the scoring in the ninth minute before González headed in Marcos Llorente's cross.""We weren't that bad before and now we aren't suddenly great, so let's stay calm, this has just started,"" said Atletico midfielder Koke Resurrección. ""Now we need to rest up for our very important match at Liverpool.""Julián Álvarez was substituted at halftime as a precautionary measure, according to the club's social media announcement.In a surprising turn of events, Alaves secured their first win at Athletic Bilbao in 20 years through an Álex Berenguer own goal, winning the Basque Country derby 1-0.Athletic Bilbao, playing without injured forward Nico Williams, suffered their first loss of the season after winning their opening three matches.Getafe continued their impressive form with a 2-0 victory over promoted Oviedo, with goals from Mario Martín and Borja Mayoral.

A subtle post from Irfan Pathan has sparked chatter ahead of the India vs Pakistan Asia Cup showdown. The former India all-rounder wrote on social media:To many, it seemed like a passing remark. But in the backdrop of Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha’s recent smirk at a press conference, it took on another meaning. Agha had gone viral when a journalist suggested Afghanistan were Asia’s second-best team. His raised eyebrows and knowing smile were seen as a sign that Pakistan deserved that spot.Pathan’s words, therefore, were quickly picked up as a veiled counter. The timing only added spice, coming just a day before the high-voltage India vs Pakistan clash in Dubai.Sri Lanka have indeed shown their credentials. Pathum Nissanka became the fastest Sri Lankan batter to 2,000 T20 runs during a commanding win over Bangladesh. His fluent 50 off 34 balls, supported by Kamil Mishara’s unbeaten 46, helped Sri Lanka chase down 140 with ease. Wanindu Hasaranga’s return and the new-ball brilliance of Nuwan Thushara and Dushmantha Chameera had earlier rocked Bangladesh, underlining why the islanders remain a force.For India, the focus is firmly on Sunday’s marquee contest. Suryakumar Yadav ’s team brushed aside the UAE in their opener, but the Pakistan challenge will be different.The defending T20 World Cup champions have a spin attack capable of troubling any batting line-up.Amid political tension and calls for boycott on social media, the players have little choice but to let their cricket do the talking. And into this atmosphere, Pathan’s post has added a touch of intrigue, setting the tone for what promises to be another unforgettable chapter in the India-Pakistan story.",Former India all-rounder Irfan Pathan made the comment on social media.

The build-up to India’s Asia Cup 2025 clash with Pakistan has been overshadowed by mounting calls for a boycott following the recent terror attack in Pahalgam that claimed the lives of Indian tourists.With emotions running high, voices from the political and sporting fraternity continue to weigh in on the debate.Former India cricketer and BJP leader Kedar Jadhav once again made his position clear, stressing that the fixture should not go ahead.“I don’t know what will happen, but I have already said that, according to me, this match should not be played,” Jadhav remarked, reflecting the strong public sentiment against sporting ties with Pakistan in the aftermath of the attack.While political leaders and ex-players have urged cancellation, the current Indian team has been cautious in its response.On Saturday, fielding coach Ryan ten Doeschate addressed the media on behalf of the team management. He acknowledged the sensitivity of the issue but emphasised that the players’ focus must remain on cricket.“The players are aware of the public sentiment, and we have spoken about it within the group. But our role is to play cricket and follow government and BCCI instructions,” ten Doeschate said.“Sport and politics should ideally stay apart. I do understand the emotions, but we are guided by what the authorities decide. That is the line we are following.”He also highlighted head coach Gautam Gambhir ’s message to the squad: “Control the controllables. Gauti’s advice has been to not get distracted by what’s outside our influence, and keep our attention firmly on cricket.”Interestingly, Gambhir himself had struck a stronger tone soon after the Pahalgam tragedy, declaring that India should suspend all sporting and cultural exchanges with Pakistan until cross-border terrorism ends.“No match, no film, nothing is more valuable than the lives of Indian soldiers and citizens,” he had said.","The build-up to India’s Asia Cup 2025 clash with Pakistan has been overshadowed by mounting calls for a boycott.

Poll How concerned were you about Shubman Gill's injury scare during training? Very concerned, he is crucial for the team. Not concerned at all, he recovered quickly.

On the eve of India’s high-voltage Asia Cup meeting with Pakistan, the training ground at Dubai International Stadium witnessed a heartwarming moment that eased some of the pre-match tension. Abhishek Sharma ’s father Raj Kumar Sharma paid a visit to a training session late on Saturday, waiting patiently outside the boundary rope with a wide smile as players wrapped up their session. Spotting him, Abhishek, Shubman Gill and Arshdeep Singh made their way over. The trio exchanged hugs with him before Gill, India’s vice-captain, bent down to touch the senior Sharma’s feet in a gesture of respect that drew warm smiles all around.The latter also greeted Gill as “kaptaan saab”. The 26-year-old is acting as the vice-captain in the Asia Cup, but led the side in the Test series against England earlier.The players were later seen sharing lighthearted jokes and conversation with Abhishek’s father, lifting spirits in what has otherwise been a tense buildup to Sunday’s clash.Earlier in the day, there had been a moment of concern when Gill was struck on the hand while batting in the nets.The physio rushed in to attend to him, and the batter walked off briefly in visible discomfort, even sitting on the ice box with teammates by his side.Captain Suryakumar Yadav and head coach Gautam Gambhir were spotted checking in on him, while Abhishek Sharma assisted him with opening a water bottle as the physio continued his assessment.Gill, however, returned to the nets within minutes, resuming training . His recovery eased fears of any serious injury, though the brief scare highlighted how crucial his presence is for India ahead of the much-anticipated contest.","Shubman Gill showed respect to Abhishek Sharma's father by touching his feet.

Poll What do you think is the most important factor in Amanjot Kaur's success? Support from her father Her natural talent Dedication and hard work

: When 24-year-old Amanjot Kaur’s name was announced in the Indian women’s squad for the ICC Women’s ODI World Cup starting September 30, there was no grand celebration in her Mohali home. Instead, there was pride in the eyes of a father who had relentlessly tried everything to see his daughter’s dream take flight.Her father, Bhupinder Singh , 54, a carpenter and contractor, still recalls the first time someone pointed out his daughter’s talent. “She used to play on the streets with boys older than her,” he said, adding, “One elderly man near our home watched her and told me, ‘You should enroll her in an academy.’ That’s when I realised she wasn’t just playing, she was special. I took it upon myself to not let her live the same life my father and I had lived as carpenters. ”The journey from that moment to today has been anything but easy. When Amanjot entered Class 11, her parents took her to Govt School, Sector 26, hoping to get her into their cricket program. The doors didn’t open there, but fate had another plan. They met coach Nagesh Gupta, who was training players in Sector 32. That chance meeting became the turning point in Amanjot’s life.From then on, Bhupinder’s days became a blur of endless kilometres. “Every day I would travel almost 120km, dropping her to school, rushing back to Mohali for work, then returning to pick her up. To manage, I had to reduce work and cut down expenses. If we bought a bat one month, we had to wait till the next month for shoes or gear. But she never complained,” he recalled.She was, in his words, a child who adjusted to everything. Even the rain couldn’t stop her. “If I told her not to go for practice because it was raining, she would say, ‘Papa, it’s not raining at the academy, I know.’ And she would go.”Her schoolteachers, too, saw something in her. While other teachers worried about her low marks, the sports faculty shielded her. “They would tell me, ‘Don’t worry about marks, she is brilliant in her own way.’ That faith kept me going.”For Bhupinder, one moment stands above the rest. “When she made her international debut in 2023, she called me at night. I couldn’t sleep after that call. My happiness knew no bounds.”But Amanjot’s story isn’t only about cricket, it’s also about courage. At just eight years old, while returning from a gurdwara with her grandmother and younger sister, she saw her sibling run into the path of a speeding vehicle. Without thinking twice, she pushed her sister to safety, taking the hit herself.Even in her career, adversity found her. A stress fracture in her back and a hand ligament injury sidelined her for more than six months in 2024. For many young athletes, that would have been the end. For Amanjot, it was a test.Her coach, Nagesh Gupta, still marvels at her resilience. “She has taught me a lot, even though I’m the coach,” he said. “If the practice would be at 6am, she would already be there at 5.30. That motivated me to try and reach before her, but somehow, she always beat me to it. During her injury, there were tough days, at first you hope for quick recovery, but as months pass, the hope fades. Yet, her willpower never wavered. She became more humble, more spiritual, and came back stronger. ”Even today, he laughs, she loves surprising him. “When I ask her when she’s coming, she says ‘day after tomorrow.’ But when I reach the academy, I find her there, already waiting to surprise me.”For Singh, who has never been able to watch his daughter’s matches live because he must care for his elderly parents, the joy is still complete. “Society is strange,” he said. “When they see a girl playing, they object. But the moment she achieves something, they fall silent. My job was simply to support her dream.”As Amanjot Kaur prepares to don the India jersey in front of the world, Mohali celebrates one of its own. For her father, the little girl who once played cricket in the streets has already won the biggest trophy of all, proving that faith, sacrifice, and courage can carry a dream all the way to the World Cup.","Amanjot Kaur, 24, is in the Indian women’s squad for the ICC Women's ODI World Cup starting September 30.

Gauti’s advice has been to not get distracted by what’s outside our influence, and keep our attention firmly on cricket.”Interestingly, Gambhir had taken a far stronger stance in the immediate aftermath of the Pahalgam attack, declaring at a public event that until cross-border terrorism stops, India should have no sporting or cultural exchanges with Pakistan.“No match, no film, nothing is more valuable than the lives of Indian soldiers and citizens,” he had said then.","India’s Asia Cup clash against Pakistan has been surrounded by strong calls for a boycott in the wake of the recent terror attack in Pahalgam. Fielding coach Ryan ten Doeschate, representing the team management, admitted the sensitivity of the matter. “Sport and politics should ideally stay apart,” he said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123871276,imgsize-164660,width-400,resizemode-4/india-pakistan-cricket.jpg"

Poll How concerned are you about Shubman Gill's injury ahead of the clash against Pakistan? Very concerned Somewhat concerned Not concerned, he will play

: India’s preparations for their high-voltage Asia Cup clash against Pakistan suffered a scare on Saturday when opener and vice-captain Shubman Gill was struck on the hand during training.Gill, who has been in fine touch, was seen in visible discomfort after the blow. The team physio immediately rushed to attend to him before he walked off the pitch. He later sat on the ice box, holding his injured hand.Captain Suryakumar Yadav and head coach Gautam Gambhir were spotted speaking with Gill after the incident, while teammate Abhishek Sharma stayed by his side and even helped him open a water bottle. The physio continued to monitor Gill as the session went on.Minutes later however, the 26-year-old was back in the nets and ready to face the next ball in training.The setback comes with less than 24 hours left before India face Pakistan in one of the most anticipated fixtures of the tournament at the Dubai International Stadium. Both teams head into the game with convincing wins in their opening matches. India demolished UAE by nine wickets, with Kuldeep Yadav (4/7) and Shivam Dube (3/4) running through the opposition before Gill and Abhishek wrapped up the chase in 4.3 overs.Pakistan too enjoyed a comfortable start, defeating Oman by 93 runs.The intensity around Sunday’s clash has already gone through the roof, with former Pakistan pacer Shoaib Akhtar predicting an aggressive approach from India.Speaking on Tapmad’s YouTube channel, Akhtar said: “What kind of cricket are they going to play against you? It’s pretty obvious they are going to dominate you, and then they’ll make sure to hammer you down. That’s as simple as it gets.”Gill’s condition will be closely watched as India brace for their biggest test yet in the Asia Cup.",Vice-captain Shubman Gill struck on hand in training ahead of India-Pakistan clash on Sunday.

Where will the match be played?



Barcelona return to La Liga action on Sunday against Valencia, but their first home fixture of the season will not be played at Camp Nou. The Catalan club is still waiting on permits to reopen its renovated stadium and will instead use the 6,000-capacity Estadi Johan Cruyff, normally reserved for the women’s and youth teams.Club president Joan Laporta addressed the situation earlier this week, saying: “We will be back to the Camp Nou as soon as possible.” Until then, Barcelona must adapt to life in a far smaller venue.Coach Hansi Flick also faces a selection headache. Frenkie de Jong, Alejandro Balde and Gavi remain unavailable through injury, with De Jong’s setback occurring while on international duty with the Netherlands. Goalkeeper Marc-André ter Stegen continues to be sidelined as well, reducing Flick’s options further.Furthermore, Lamine Yamal will also play no part in the game owing to injuries sustained while on duty for Spain.Despite the off-field and fitness concerns, Barcelona remain unbeaten and will look to maintain their strong start under Flick. Valencia, meanwhile, arrive in search of an upset that could shift early-season momentum.The fixture marks the first major test of how Barcelona manage both reduced squad depth and the unusual circumstances of playing without their iconic stadium.With young talents like Lamine Yamal stepping up in attack, the champions will aim to keep pace with early leaders Real Madrid and Athletic Bilbao.- The matchday 2 fixture will be streamed live on the FanCode app and website.- There will be no live broadcast in India for the 2025/26 La Liga season.The matchday 4 clash between Valencia and Barca will kick off on Sunday, September 14 (Monday, September 15 in India) at 9:00 PM Local time (12:30 AM IST).The match between Valencia and Barcelona will not be played at Camp Nou. Rather, the game will take place at the Estadi Johan Cruyff in Sant Joan Despi, Spain.","Barcelona face Valencia at the Estadi Johan Cruyff in Sant Joan Despi.

New Delhi: Naushad Moosa has taken a break. After the India U-23 coach failed to make the grade in the AFC U-23 Asian Cup 2026 Qualifiers, the former India international defender stayed back in Doha to spend a couple of days with friends.The Qatari capital was bombed on Tuesday, a day after India narrowly lost to the hosts. Was it safe for him to stay back? Moosa told TOI, “It created some panic that night but things settled down after that.”His team’s performance in the three Doha qualifiers made the people back home sit up and take notice. The social media was full of clips showing Muhammed Suhail's impressive solo effort for the opening strike.Naushad Moosa’s boys finished fifth among the eleven second-placed teams, just one spot behind the qualification places. They won against Bahrain (2-0), drubbed Brunei 6-0 and narrowly lost to hosts Qatar 2-1.“Agreed there is lot to cheer about the U-23 boys’ display, but what concerns me is, what next? Most of them will warm the bench when they go back to their clubs. They won’t get much game time. They end up playing developmental games,” pointed out Moosa.“This lack of continuity has been a major problem for us,” he continued, “These boys need to play consistently at the senior level now.They are good enough for senior India too.”Moosa said he has related this issue with the AIFF too and can only hope it can be addressed. Moosa’s strong message to the young players is to find clubs where they can get playing time.For now, Moosa will return to Guwahati to join NorthEast United, where he is part of the coaching staff. Praising his boys for their adventurous display, Moosa said that Suhail, the most talked about youngster currently, should remain focused.“These boys should concentrate on the game but for that they have to be kept engaged with competitive games.”","Naushad Moosa's boys finished fifth among the eleven second-placed teams.

Real Madrid’s defensive plans have taken a hit as centre-back Antonio Rudiger faces a lengthy spell on the sidelines following a muscle injury in his left leg. The German international, 32, suffered the setback during training on Friday, and early reports suggest he could be out for around two months.The club confirmed in a statement that scans revealed an injury to Rudiger’s rectus femoris muscle. While Real Madrid did not provide an exact recovery timeline, Spanish outlet AS described the injury as “serious.” The veteran defender has only featured once in La Liga this season, after managing 55 appearances for the club last year despite battling through injuries.Rudiger’s absence leaves Real with limited options at centre-back, though the club strengthened the position this summer by signing 20-year-old Dean Huijsen from Bournemouth. Reports also suggest that Real Madrid are keeping an eye on Liverpool’s France international Ibrahima Konaté, potentially as reinforcement at the end of the season.The Spanish champions face a busy schedule ahead, with a La Liga trip to Real Sociedad on Saturday followed by their Champions League opener against Marseille on Tuesday. Manager Carlo Ancelotti will be forced to reshuffle his defensive lineup in the absence of Rüdiger.Meanwhile, Jude Bellingham, who has been managing a shoulder injury, has opted for surgery following his Club World Cup commitments. The England midfielder has now begun rehabilitation, with Real Madrid hopeful of seeing him return later this season.With Rudiger sidelined and Bellingham recovering, Real Madrid will need to rely on squad depth as they juggle domestic and European challenges in the opening months of the campaign.",Antonio Rudiger faces a lengthy spell on the sidelines with a muscle injury.

Athletic Bilbao have confirmed the return of Spanish defender Aymeric Laporte after FIFA authorized his move from Al Nassr in the Saudi Pro League. The switch had stalled on deadline day due to administrative delays, but the world football governing body has now allowed the registration to be completed.Athletic Bilbao released an official statement confirming FIFA had granted Spain’s football federation (RFEF) the authority to secure the International Transfer Certificate from Saudi Arabia . This cleared the way for Laporte’s registration in La Liga.The transfer had initially collapsed on September 1, when Al Nassr reportedly failed to input key details into FIFA’s Transfer Matching System. That omission prevented the paperwork from being validated before the deadline. The RFEF appealed the decision, and FIFA has now ruled in favour of the Spanish side.FIFA’s decision to overturn its earlier refusal has provided clarity for both Laporte and Bilbao. The club regains a player who made over 160 La Liga appearances in his first spell, while Laporte secures a return to the team where his professional career began.The incident also underlined the challenges of coordinating moves between European clubs and the Saudi Pro League.Despite the league’s financial growth and international talent pool, the registration delays remain a recurring issue.During his two seasons with Al Nassr, Laporte played alongside global stars such as Cristiano Ronaldo , Sadio Mané, and Marcelo Brozović. While he was a consistent presence in defence, changes in the squad meant his long-term future was uncertain.Now, the Euro 2024 winner has returned to Athletic Bilbao with a wealth of experience. His time at Manchester City saw him win 13 trophies, including five Premier League titles and the UEFA Champions League Supporters at San Mamés are preparing a warm welcome and are hopeful that Laporte’s leadership and defensive skills can help push the club forward.",Athletic Bilbao have confirmed the return of Aymeric Laporte from Al Nassr.

Anthony Martial is set to join Monterrey as per several reports (Screengrab)

Poll Do you think Anthony Martial will be a success at Monterrey? Yes, definitely No, not at all

Anthony Martial is on the verge of a move to Liga MX side Monterrey, with reports suggesting the French forward has agreed terms and will undergo a medical in Mexico.The 29-year-old, released by Manchester United at the end of the 2023/24 season, had joined AEK Athens on a free transfer last summer. Despite being handed what was described as the biggest contract in the Greek club’s history, Martial struggled to make an impact, featuring in just 24 games across competitions. He has not been included in the squad for AEK’s last six fixtures.Transfer journalist Fabrizio Romano reported that Monterrey and Martial have reached an agreement, with the move pending medical clearance. Fellow Mexican side Pumas were also in the race but failed to finalise a deal after Martial declined to lower his wage demands.As per reports from journalist Cesar Luis Merlo, AEK were willing to loan him to Pumas free of charge (they should only pay his salary), but Martial earns a massive salary.Martial, who joined United from Monaco in 2015 for an initial £36m, went on to score 90 goals in 317 appearances for the Premier League club. His imminent switch to Monterrey comes just months after the Mexican side secured the signing of former Real Madrid defender Sergio Ramos.Should the move go through, Martial will link up with the 39-year-old veteran, who has already helped Monterrey climb to the top of the Liga MX standings with six wins from their opening seven matches.","Anthony Martial is on the verge of a move to Monterrey, according to reports.

Poll Should the identities of individuals involved in such cases be kept confidential until proven guilty? Yes, to protect their rights. No, transparency is important.

Former Premier League referee David Coote has pleaded not guilty to a charge of making an indecent video of a child. The 43-year-old, from Newark, appeared before Nottingham Magistrates’ Court on Thursday.Coote, who was dismissed by referees’ body PGMOL in 2024, faces an accusation of making one “category A” video of a child on January 2, 2020. Category A offences are considered the most serious, involving acts such as downloading, sharing or saving indecent material.Ben Payne, prosecuting, told the court that the matter came to light during an FA investigation into Coote, when mobile devices were examined by a third party. He also added that following a police investigation, Coote was arrested at his home, where two laptops were seized, as per AFP. A video involving a 15-year-old child was subsequently found.Payne said that that the “starting point for sentencing was a year in custody” and said the case was suitable for Magistrates’ Court. However, Coote used his right for a jury trial and requested the matter be sent to Crown Court. A pre-trial hearing at Nottingham Crown Court has been set for October 9.Earlier, defence solicitor Fraser Williamson applied to restrict publication of Coote’s home address, citing safety concerns following threats he had received during his officiating career. District Judge Gillian Young rejected the application.Coote remains on bail under conditions that prohibit him from having unsupervised contact with anyone under 18 or residing in a household with a minor without approval.","Former Premier League referee David Coote has pleaded not guilty to a charge of making an indecent video of a child.

What’s common between the three Formula E world champions

How the three World Champions fared in Formula E Season 11

Days after Oliver Rowland lifted his Formula E World Championship trophy in London this season, an interesting trend has come to the attention of Formula E and its fans. As a coincidence, all Formula E drivers who won the Mexico City E-Prix went on to win the Formula E World Championship that season, and this has been proved right for three consecutive years.Highlighting the same since 2023, a poster of three World Champions was shared on X by Formula E with the caption, “The trend continues. Each winner of the #MexicoCityEPrix from the past three seasons has gone on to become World Champion.”The special poster features 2023 Formula E World Champion Jake Dennis from Andretti, then TAG Heuer Porsche’s Pascal Wehrlein, who won in 2024, and the new World Champion, Nissan driver Oliver Rowland. All three of them won in the Mexico E-Prix and went on to lift the winner’s trophy in the Formula E World Championship that year.Oliver Rowland had strengthened his chances of winning the Formula E World Championship this year much earlier. He was leading the Formula E Driver Standings ever since he won Part 2 of the Jeddah E-Prix, which was his second win of the season after winning the Mexico E-Prix. In the last leg, the Nissan driver got nervous for a while as Pascal Wehrlein, who was following him in the number two position, closed the gap after grabbing quite a few podiums while Rowland had a dull period.Things became serious for Rowland when he failed to finish the Round 13 race in Berlin, while Wehrlein won second spot on the podium. But he eventually managed to confirm his championship in Berlin after four wins and three more podiums.Sharing about his bad race in Berlin, Rowland had said, “I was hoping before the weekend that the outcome could be [the World Championship], but after yesterday (Saturday) and this morning (Sunday), I was more worried that it might never come.”Also Read: Oliver Rowland reacts to daughter’s sweet radio message after Formula E Championship win: “It’s amazing” Things, however, changed for Wehrlein, who was pushed to third position after Nick Cassidy made a late entry in the Formula E Driver Standings by registering three consecutive wins.

Wehrlein registered one win and five more podiums this season.Meanwhile, Andretti driver Jake Dennis finished in seventh position in the Formula E Driver Standings.

Taylor Barnard on losing top three spot in Formula E World Championship

Fans hail Taylor Barnard for his fantastic rookie season

It was Taylor Barnard’s rookie season this year, and the NEOM McLaren driver put up a fantastic performance by temporarily making it to the top three in the Formula E Driver Standings by ousting the much more experienced Porsche driver Antonio Felix Da Costa.

Finishing P4 in the Drivers’ Championship and coming into the final weekend with a shot at runner-up is something to be proud of.”Also adding a note for teammate Sam Bird, as NEOM McLaren withdrew from Formula E after the end of the season, Barnard wrote, “@sambird_official it wasn’t the weekend you deserved either.You’ve been a huge part of my season both on and off the track, and I’m grateful for everything. You deserved more. To all the Papaya fans, thank you for the incredible support in our final race together. You always go above and beyond. ”Reacting to his post, a fan wrote, “An incredible debut season, huge congrats and excited to see where you go next!” Another said, “I know I said it the other day, but you’ve been incredible to watch this last year and a pleasure to support you in Papaya — there are many of us that can’t wait to support you in whatever you do next!” One more commented, “You were incredible all season around, Taylor.

We couldn’t have done it without you all — your trust and support have never been taken for granted,” he added.Praising the two McLaren drivers, he wrote, “Sam clinched McLaren’s first-ever fully electric win at the São Paulo E-Prix in Season 10, pulling off one of Formula E’s all-time great overtakes, before being waved across the line by none other than Emerson Fittipaldi – McLaren's first Formula 1 World Champion. While Taylor has been a rookie sensation in Season 11, securing five Formula E records, including the youngest driver to start a race, the youngest points scorer, the youngest driver to lead a lap, the youngest podium finisher, and the youngest polesitter. ”He ended the letter saying, “Some of us have been together since the day we first launched this team, while others have seamlessly fitted in along the way and flourished within the environment we have cultivated. For many, I am sure that we will cross paths again soon, but whatever the future holds for those here at Bicester, whatever path they choose to follow, I have no doubt that it will be bright.

How do Formula E and ABB work together?

What do ABB and Formula E say about the partnership?

After a successful Season 11, ABB and Formula E have announced that they will continue their partnership in the upcoming season. This gives ABB another opportunity to promote its new brand positioning via the ABB FIA Formula E World Championship, along with technologies that help industries take a cleaner route.Over a period of eight seasons, the partnership with Formula E has provided ABB a platform to showcase how technology can help industries outrun challenges, engage with customers around the world, and implement its own solutions into the series to improve reliability and efficiency. The partnership extension will provide a year-round opportunity for brand-building and activation, communicating ABB and its technology solutions to new global audiences, including Formula E’s international fanbase.ABB and Formula E will also join hands to engage a new generation of fans, collaborating with unexpected influencers and content creators to tell compelling stories that make advanced electrification and automation technologies tangible and exciting.The end of the mid-race car swap, a 150kW increase in power, top speeds that are 43 percent higher, and energy recovery increasing from 15 to 50 percent indicate how far Formula E technology has come to outperform on track.ABB has also built on its technical involvement in the series, supplying the race chargers from Season 9, and introducing its ABB Ability OPTIMAX® energy management software (Season 9) and Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) technology (Season 5) to the sport.ABB Head of Brand Paco Liebrand said, “We are pleased to be continuing our partnership with Formula E which, like ABB, is striving for a leaner and cleaner future. The synergy between the two organizations, combined with the global appeal of the Championship, makes it a great platform to promote our brand positioning.”He further said, “Formula E is increasingly working with content creators, influencers, and celebrities, with initiatives such as the Evo Sessions making an impact through digital channels beyond the racing itself, which is also an essential part of ABB’s new brand strategy. Going forward, we will be enhancing the way we harness the benefits of this collaboration, ensuring the focus is on delivering content and activations that reinforce our new messaging, build familiarity, and tell the ‘Engineered to Outrun’ story. ”Formula E Chief Revenue Officer Tiziana Di Gioia said, “Our renewed partnership with ABB is a testament to the commercial power and benefit of Formula E as a global platform that drives both brand and business growth. ABB, like our wider partnership portfolio, has and continues to see enormous value in collaborating with the fastest-growing motorsport on the planet, with viewership, commercial integration, and brand storytelling continuing to accelerate. Over eight seasons, ABB has moved from brand visibility to brand activation—integrating deeply into the fan experience, the sport’s ecosystem, and our innovation narrative.Also Read: Antonio Felix Da Costa shares happy memories as Porsche wins Formula E Teams and Manufacturers’ World Championships “This next chapter elevates the partnership even further. With ABB’s new positioning, we are co-creating opportunities across content, digital storytelling, and market engagement, transforming a title partnership into a year-round, value-generating relationship. It’s a model of how modern sponsorships should evolve, rooted in purpose and cultural alignment but measured by impact,” she added.Formula E Season 12 will begin with testing in Valencia in October.","ABB and Formula E have announced that they will continue their partnership in the upcoming season.

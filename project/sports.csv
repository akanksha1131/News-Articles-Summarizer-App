Jay Shah’s 2036 Olympic blueprint for India: '8 Medals won’t cut it'

Poll Do you agree with the decision to change the ISL format to a single leg home and away structure? Yes, it's a good change. No, I preferred the previous format. Undecided.





PANAJI: The sports ministry and the All India Football Federation (AIFF) turned the tables on top-tier clubs during a joint meeting in the Capital on Tuesday, leaving them with no choice but agree to take part in this edition of the Indian Super League (ISL).Sports minister Mansukh Mandaviya later announced that the ISL will kick off on Feb 14 with all 14 teams taking part. When clubs headed to the Capital at short notice — summoned individually through a phone call late on Monday night by AIFF deputy secretary general M Satyanarayan — they were expecting to hear the proposal, return home, study and then consult owners. Instead, they were told time was running out and they had to say “yes or no” on Tuesday itself.“We had no choice to decide whether the (short-term) proposal makes sense,” said one club official who had to hurriedly call the club owner and inform him of the latest developments.Consistent in their stand that they are taking part in the top league, whatever the format and financial implications, Jamshedpur FC were the first to provide an email confirmation, followed by the likes of Punjab FC, East Bengal, NorthEast United, Mohammedan Sporting and Inter Kashi.Later, Delhi SC, Bengaluru FC and Mohun Bagan Super Giant came on board. Five clubs — Kerala Blasters, Chennaiyin FC, Mumbai City, FC Goa and Odisha FC — needed time to speak with their owners and reluctantly agreed. ISL clubs were also taken aback with the change in format.While most were in favour of a single-leg centralised format, AIFF proposed a single leg home and away structure for the current season, estimated to cost Rs24.3 crore. AIFF said a single leg centralised format will cost Rs 38 crore, adding to the cost.The ISL will have a total of 91 matches with all 14 teams playing each other once. Clubs have to pay Rs 1 crore each as franchise fee. As per the constitution, the top league will have principles of promotion and relegation, but AIFF is likely to approach the Supreme Court for a one-year relaxation, given that it will be a truncated league. Talking to the media, sports minister Mansukh Mandaviya said: “Today the govt, football federation and 14 clubs had a meeting and we have decided that ISL will start Feb 14 on Saturday. All 14 clubs will participate.”“Similarly, the I-League will be held around the same time with all 11 clubs participating. The leagues will finally happen,” he added.Mandaviya was joined by the beleaguered AIFF president Kalyan Chaubey, who explained the financial and logistical aspects of both leagues. “A Rs 25 crore central pool has been made only for the conduct of the ISL. 10 percent of this fund will come from AIFF, 50% from clubs and 10% from legacy partners (clubs). Another 30% was to come from a commercial partner but since we don’t have one right now, the AIFF will pitch in with that contribution for this season,” Chaubey said.",The Indian Super League (ISL) will start on February 14. All 14 teams will take part. The ISL will have a total of 91 matches with all 14 teams playing each other once. Clubs have to pay Rs 1 crore each as franchise fee.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126386994,imgsize-52494,width-400,resizemode-4/indian-super-league-trophy.jpg"

India ODI squad review | Iyer returns, Pant gets the nod, Shami misses out again

Poll Will Shreyas Iyer's performance in the recent match positively impact his fitness for the New Zealand ODI series? Yes, definitely No, he still needs more time





JAIPUR: Shreyas Iyer more or less passed the fitness test for the forthcoming New Zealand ODI series cracking a fine 53-ball 82 against Himachal Pradesh at the Jaipuria Vidyalaya ground here on Tuesday.Named vice-captain for the three-match ODI series subject to fitness, Iyer wasted no time in announcing his comeback, coming out all guns blazing in a 33-over clash delayed due to dense fog, as star-studded Mumbai posted 299/9.Yet, chasing a daunting 300, Himachal managed to give their mighty rivals, with six India players in their ranks, a big scare, falling just seven short after being dismissed for 292 a couple of balls to spare.With this win, both Mumbai and Punjab (20 points each) have qualified for the knockouts from Elite Group C.Earlier, the newly-appointed Mumbai skipper, standing in for the injured Shardul Thakur, was fortunate after being dropped twice early — when on 2 and 4 — at first slip fielder by Innesh Mahajan off pacer Rohit Kumar. But he quickly shrugged that off and began playing fluently.Coming out to bat in the 17th over with Yashasvi Jaiswal (15) and Sarfaraz Khan (21) back in the pavilion, Iyer built the innings with Musheer Khan. His innings was laced with 10 boundaries and three sixes at a strike rate of 154.72. Iyer and Musheer Khan rapidly stitched together a partnership of 82 runs off 54 balls. After opener Musheer departed for a 51-ball 73, Iyer found Suryakumar Yadav (24: 18b, 1x4, 2x6) for a 65-run stand off 39 balls.In reply, with Himachal needing 25 in the last two overs, fell seven runs short.",Shreyas Iyer scores 82 as Mumbai beat Himachal Pradesh.

Bangladesh seek T20 WC match shift from India after Mustafizur Rahman's IPL exit





Former Bangladesh captain Mohammad Ashraful has said that Mustafizur Rahman remains unaffected by the circumstances surrounding his release from Kolkata Knight Riders in the Indian Premier League. The Bangladesh pacer was let go by KKR following a directive from the Board of Control for Cricket in India, issued amid heightened tensions between the two countries.Speaking in his role as assistant coach of Rangpur Riders in the ongoing Bangladesh Premier League, Ashraful revealed that Mustafizur has shown no signs of distraction and is fully committed to his current assignment.“He is completely chill. He is not worried at all about all the off-field talk – whether it’s BCB, India, BPL or ICC,” Ashraful told reporters after Rangpur Riders’ match against Chattogram Royals.Ashraful, who also serves as Bangladesh’s batting coach, said the left-arm pacer’s focus is firmly on performing for Rangpur before turning his attention to whatever lies ahead. “Right now he is focused on playing for Rangpur Riders, and after this, whatever assignment comes next, he will focus on that. He is a person of a different level,” he said.Assessing Mustafizur’s performances in the BPL so far, Ashraful acknowledged a slow start but highlighted his impact in Rangpur’s recent win over Dhaka. “If you talk about Mustafizur in the first two matches, his performances were a bit below par, but especially the way we won the last match against Dhaka was an outstanding victory.And the way Mustafizur bowled those last two overs – I think he is a world champion for this format, that’s how important he is,” he added.In the aftermath of the BCCI’s decision, the Bangladesh Cricket Board held an emergency meeting on Sunday and later confirmed that it had formally approached the International Cricket Council. The BCB has requested that all of Bangladesh’s matches in the 2026 ICC Men’s T20 World Cup be moved to venues outside India, citing safety and security concerns.India and Sri Lanka are slated to co-host the tournament from February 7 to March 8, with games scheduled across several venues in both countries. Bangladesh’s stance has the potential to complicate the tournament calendar, as they are currently scheduled to face the West Indies on February 7, Italy on February 9, and England on February 14 at Eden Gardens in Kolkata, before playing Nepal on February 17 at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai.",Bangladesh seek T20 WC match shift from India after Mustafizur Rahman's IPL exit.

India can survive without Virat and Rohit, not without Bumrah





New Zealand captain Michael Bracewell has played down any talk of India’s senior stars being on the wane, stressing that Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma remain forces to be reckoned with in ODI cricket. Ahead of the upcoming series, Bracewell said it would be “silly to underestimate” the experienced duo and expressed confidence that both will still be central figures at next year’s ODI World Cup.Kohli and Rohit, now active only in the ODI format for India, are set to return to action in the three-match series starting Sunday in Vadodara, followed by games in Rajkot on January 14 and Indore on January 18. With Mitchell Santner , Tom Latham and Rachin Ravindra unavailable, Bracewell will lead the New Zealand side on the tour.“I'd like to see them play in the World Cup. They're obviously still playing very good cricket so there's no reason to stop,” Bracewell said while speaking to the media on the sidelines of the New Zealand Cricket Golf Day at the Willingdon Sports Club.“They're both playing beautifully, so why not? Their records speak for themselves, both individually and as a team. They've been involved in some great Indian sides and led that side with the bat. You'd be silly to underestimate them, that's for sure,” Bracewell added.Addressing the absence of senior players such as Santner, Bracewell admitted the challenge of filling key roles. “Whenever you're missing players of say, Mitch Santner's calibre, you're always going to be struggling to replace them.You're never going to be able to replace a guy like that. But if everyone mucks in and does their bit, then hopefully we can all work together and achieve great things on this tour.”Despite the T20 World Cup being just over a month away, Bracewell stressed the relevance of the ODI series. “You have to be where your feet are and take care of what's in front of you. We've obviously got an important one-day series coming up against India,” Bracewell said, highlighting the value of extended time in Indian conditions.","Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma set to return to action in the three-match series.

"Runs, wickets, and World Cup: Kapil Dev turns 67 - the all-rounder Indian cricket never replaced",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/runs-wickets-and-world-cup-kapil-dev-turns-67-the-all-rounder-indian-cricket-never-replaced/articleshow/126376127.cms,"Kapil Dev.

January 6 holds a distinct place in cricket’s calendar. It was on this day that Steve Waugh played his final Test, at his home ground, the Sydney Cricket Ground. It was also the day when three Australian greats — Greg Chappell, Dennis Lillee and Rod Marsh — played their last Test in 1984, bowing out together at the end of the Sydney Test against Pakistan.From an Indian cricket perspective, however, January 6 carries a different weight. It was on this day in 1959 that Kapil Dev was born. More than six decades on, it remains difficult to argue against the idea that Indian cricket’s most complete cricketer arrived that day.On Kapil Dev’s birthday, it is hard not to recall a tweet posted by cricket writer Abhishek Mukherjee in 2020. It was not written in praise-heavy prose or sweeping claims. Instead, it listed what Indian cricket’s greats had achieved — and what each of them had not. World Cups, series wins, hat-tricks, five-wicket hauls, centuries in specific countries, records with bat or ball — every name, every achievement, had a missing piece. Until Kapil Dev. Mukherjee ended his list with a simple conclusion: only one Indian had done all of it. And more.Kapil Dev’s numbers still stand apart in Indian cricket. He remains the only player to score 4,000 runs and take 400 wickets in Test cricket.He finished his Test career with over 5,000 runs, including eight centuries, and 434 wickets — a world record at the time, achieved by overtaking Richard Hadlee. His career stretched across 131 Tests, a mark of durability in an era when fast bowlers rarely lasted that long. If not for being dropped for one Test against England in 1984-85 as a disciplinary measure, his career would have read 132 consecutive Tests.Kapil was not the fastest, nor did he possess the most unplayable delivery among his contemporaries. Playing at the same time as Imran Khan, Ian Botham and Hadlee, comparisons were inevitable. His strike rate — fewer than four wickets per Test — did not scream dominance. What did stand out was accuracy, stamina and movement, particularly his ability to swing the ball away from right-handers. He bowled long spells, returned for more, and did so across conditions without complaint.With the bat, Kapil was uncomplicated and direct. He did not wait for permission to attack. His Test record includes innings that continue to define moments in Indian cricket history. The 129 at Port Elizabeth against South Africa came when the rest of the Indian team managed only 86 runs combined. Against Pakistan in Madras in 1980, he struck a brisk 84 and took 11 wickets to seal the series. During the 1981-82 series against England, Kapil amassed 318 runs and claimed 22 wickets against an attack and batting line-up that included Botham, Graham Gooch, David Gower, Mike Gatting and Bob Willis.In Australia in 1991-92, well into his career, Kapil still took 25 wickets across the series. Against England, he averaged over 40 with the bat. Against Australia, he averaged 25 with the ball. These are not isolated spikes but sustained contributions across opponents and continents.Then there was the Lord’s Test of 1990. Facing England’s off-spinner Eddie Hemmings, Kapil struck four sixes in four balls when India needed 23 runs to avoid the follow-on. It made him the first player in Test cricket to hit four consecutive sixes in an over, a feat only three players have managed till date.In one-day internationals, Kapil again sits alone in Indian cricket history. He remains the only Indian with more than 2,500 runs and 250 wickets in the format, finishing with 3,783 runs and 253 wickets. These numbers came while he also captained India to its first World Cup title.The 1983 World Cup remains central to Kapil Dev’s legacy. India entered the tournament with little expectation, having won only one match — against East Africa — in the previous two editions. They had even lost to Sri Lanka, then not a Test-playing nation. Kapil, 24 at the time, had been made captain only four months earlier, after India lost a Test series to Pakistan and Sunil Gavaskar was removed.Questions surrounded Kapil’s leadership and temperament. It was his bat that first answered them. Against Zimbabwe at Tunbridge Wells, with India reduced to 9 for 4 and then 17 for 5, Kapil produced an unbeaten 175. It came on a pitch offering assistance to bowlers and against a team making its World Cup debut, but the context did not dilute the impact. His 175 came off 138 balls. He reached his hundred only in the 49th over, before scoring 75 runs in the next 11 overs. India recovered, won the match, and stayed alive in the tournament.That innings is now spoken of as a turning point. Not because it was against the strongest opposition, but because it held India together when collapse looked certain.Kapil Dev’s career does not rest on a single trophy or a single innings. It rests on accumulation — of runs, wickets, matches, moments and responsibilities. He captained India to a World Cup, held the world record for Test wickets, and remains unmatched in Indian cricket for all-round output across formats.On January 6, Indian cricket does not just mark a birthday. It marks the arrival of a player whose career still resists neat comparison and whose replacement in Indian cricket still has not been found.","Kapil Dev was born on January 6, 1959.

Mumbai pulled off a tense seven-run win over Himachal Pradesh in a rain-curtailed Vijay Hazare Trophy clash at the Jaipuria Vidyalaya Ground in Jaipur, with stand-in captain Shreyas Iyer and all-rounder Shivam Dube playing decisive roles.Leading the side in the absence of injured Shardul Thakur, Iyer produced a commanding 82 from 53 deliveries to rescue Mumbai from a tricky position. After early losses of Yashasvi Jaiswal and Sarfaraz Khan left Mumbai at 55 for 2, Iyer steadied the innings alongside Musheer Khan. The pair added 82 runs off just 54 balls, keeping the momentum alive in the shortened 33-over contest, which was delayed due to dense fog.Musheer’s fluent 73 off 51 balls laid a strong platform, following which Iyer combined with Suryakumar Yadav for a brisk 65-run stand off 39 balls. Iyer eventually fell in the 26th over, missing out on a century by 18 runs, having struck 10 fours and three sixes. Mumbai closed on a competitive 299 for 9.Himachal Pradesh began their chase aggressively but lost both openers for ducks, putting immediate pressure on the middle order. Pukhraj Mann counter-attacked with 64 off 41 balls, while wicketkeeper Ankush Bains added 53 from 39. Mayank Dagar’s 64 and Amanpreet Singh’s explosive 42 off 21 balls kept the contest alive, with Amit Kumar chipping in late.With 10 required from the final over, Shivam Dube held his nerve, removing the last two batters to finish with four wickets as Himachal were bowled out for 292 in 32.4 overs.Elsewhere, Hyderabad registered their first win of the season, crushing Bengal by 107 runs on the back of Aman Rao’s double hundred and Mohammed Siraj’s four-wicket haul, despite Shahbaz Ahmed’s fighting century.Punjab cruised past Goa in a chase of 212, with Harnoor Singh unbeaten on 94 and Naman Dhir contributing 68 in a decisive 131-run partnership. Karnataka dominated Rajasthan thanks to hundreds from Mayank Agarwal and Devdutt Padikkal, while Gujarat dismantled Odisha by 233 runs. Kerala impressed with a successful chase led by Vishnu Vinod ’s stunning 162, and Delhi sealed a comfortable win over Railways, powered by Priyansh Arya’s rapid 80.","Mumbai pull off tense seven-run win over Himachal Pradesh in Vijay Hazare Trophy clash.

Chelsea have confirmed Liam Rosenior as their new manager, signing the 41-year-old on a six-year contract until 2032 after he left French side Strasbourg on Tuesday. Rosenior, known for his attack-minded approach, becomes only the second Black manager in Chelsea’s history, following Ruud Gullit.Rosenior earned praise for transforming Strasbourg into a competitive Ligue 1 side, guiding them to a seventh-place finish last season and European qualification. “Liam has shown that he can build teams with a clear way of playing while setting the highest standards with players on and off the pitch. While there will continue to be a focus on player development, the club’s expectations and ambitions remain high,” Chelsea said in their announcement.Before Strasbourg, Rosenior had a stint as assistant coach at Derby under Wayne Rooney, who commended his “incredible” work ethic and attention to detail. Despite his success in France, Rosenior has never managed a Premier League side. He succeeds Enzo Maresca, who left after 18 months at the helm.Chelsea, currently fifth in the league and 17 points behind leaders Arsenal, offer Rosenior a higher-profile and more pressurised stage.Reflecting on the opportunity, Rosenior said: “I am excited to work with this extremely talented group of players and staff, to build strong connections on and off the pitch, and to create an environment where everyone feels united and driven by the same goal.”The move also carries personal significance. Rosenior added: “This opportunity for me is something I can’t turn down at this moment in my life… It means that I can go home and see my kids. I’m away from my children, I missed them. And I wanted to make the sacrifice of not seeing them worth it, with the success that we have here.”Son of former player and coach Leroy Rosenior, Liam had a 16-year professional playing career in England, representing Fulham, Reading, Hull, Brighton, and England Under-21s. He returned to Hull as his first head coach in 2022 before joining Strasbourg in 2024, leaving the French club with European football secured and a spot in the knockout phase of the UEFA Conference League.Rosenior defended his decision to move to Chelsea, stating: “I don’t think anyone can question how hard I’ve worked for the club, my integrity in the way I’ve worked for this club. I don’t think anyone can question the decision I’ve made to move on with my career.”This appointment marks a rare top-level opportunity for a Black British coach in the Premier League, and Chelsea will hope Rosenior can bring stability and consistency to a side that has seen five permanent managers since the BlueCo takeover in 2022.","Chelsea appoint Liam Rosenior as their new manager.

MANCHESTER: Ruben Amorim's sacking by Manchester United has exposed the dismal lack of progress since Jim Ratcliffe's arrival as co-owner promised a new dawn.Amorim was the latest manager unable to turn the tide at Old Trafford, which has witnessed more than a decade of decline since Alex Ferguson retired in 2013.The veteran Scot stood down after winning the club's 20th English league crown following two decades of domestic dominance gilded by European success.Since then United have not seriously competed to win the Premier League or Champions League despite a succession of big-name managers.Amorim, 40, is the first boss to be hired and axed since Ratcliffe took control of the club's football operations after acquiring a minority stake in the Red Devils.The British billionaire's arrival in February 2024 was greeted with glee by supporters desperate to see a new face at the helm after years of underachievement under the Glazer family, who still own a majority stake.Yet hopes that the boyhood United fan could make United competitive again at home and in Europe have so far been dashed.- No 'knee-jerk reactions' -Just a few months ago, Ratcliffe, 73, said Amorim had three years to prove himself despite a tough start at United, adding that the club would not be drawn into ""knee-jerk reactions"".But United have continued to drift, winning just one of their past five home games in the league.An apparent rift with the club's director of football Jason Wilcox over tactics and transfer targets appears to have increased the pressure on Amorim, who was dismissed on Monday after 14 months in charge.Wilcox moved into his current position in June last year, taking over the main role held by Dan Ashworth, who lasted just five months at the club in an early embarrassment for the new regime.Ratcliffe has so far done little to suggest he can deliver on his desire to restore a club he admitted ""has become mediocre"" to former glories.The club's ambition to win a 21st league title by the time of their 150th anniversary in 2028 looks less realistic with every passing season.United finished the 2024/25 campaign in 15th spot -- the club's lowest top-flight finish since they were relegated in 1974 -- and missed out on European football for only the second time in 35 years.Despite a marginal improvement this season, Amorim departed with his side 17 points adrift of leaders Arsenal after 20 games.The club are still within striking distance of the top four but cannot afford to lose further ground.- Transfer flops -Ratcliffe has been publicly scathing of some of United's transfer dealings prior to his arrival but the jury is still out on incomings on his watch.Joshua Zirkzee and Manuel Ugarte have largely been peripheral figures since being signed under the managerial regime of Erik ten Hag, Amorim's predecessor.Amorim was armed with an expensive new front three of Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo in the recent summer transfer window but they have scored just 12 Premier League goals between them so far.United's ability to spend their way out of their troubles is beginning to be squeezed by financial sustainability rules.The club's desperate need to return to the lucrative Champions League will have been a factor in their decision to axe Amorim, who arrived in November 2024 feted as one of the game's leading young managerial talents.To compound matters for United fans starved of success, Ratcliffe is asking them to pay more to attend games.At the same time, he has been criticised for swingeing job cuts as he tries to restore order to the club's finances.Last year United set out plans for a 100,000-seater stadium to replace their historic but creaking Old Trafford ground.Ratcliffe said the club planned to have the ""world's greatest football stadium"", with hopes it could be finished within five years, though there is major uncertainty over the timescale.Plans on and off the pitch are undoubtedly ambitious, but they are a long way from being realised.",Amorim is the first boss to be hired and axed since Jim Ratcliffe took control of the club's football operations. The British billionaire's arrival in February 2024 was greeted with glee by supporters desperate to see a new face at the helm after years of underachievement.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126358490,imgsize-79020,width-400,resizemode-4/mnh-49.jpg"

Manchester United on Monday sacked head coach Ruben Amorim, hours after the Portuguese spoke about tensions within the club following Sunday’s 1-1 draw against Leeds United. Amorim had said the club hierarchy needed to ""do their job"" and that he should be allowed to work without interference.The 1-1 draw at Elland Road was Amorim’s final match of his 14-month spell in charge. The result left Manchester United sixth in the Premier League after 20 matches.“With Manchester United sitting sixth in the Premier League, the club’s leadership has reluctantly made the decision that it is the right time to make a change,” United said in a statement. “This will give the team the best opportunity of the highest possible Premier League finish.”Former midfielder and current Under-18s coach Darren Fletcher is expected to take charge on an interim basis. His first match is likely to be away at Burnley on Wednesday night. The club is expected to make a permanent appointment in the summer.Reports had claimed that United’s head of recruitment, Christopher Vivell, asked Amorim to adapt his tactics after Fulham manager Marco Silva explained how his team planned to counter United’s system during their draw in August.Amorim changed his usual three-man defence for the win over Newcastle but returned to his preferred system in draws against Wolves and Leeds.Amorim was appointed in November 2024 after Erik ten Hag was sacked. The decision to remove him was taken by the club’s leadership, including chief executive Omar Berrada and director of football Jason Wilcox, following a breakdown in relations.Under the terms of his contract, which runs until 2027 with an option for a further year, United will have to pay the full amount, as there is no clause for a reduced exit.After the Leeds match, Amorim said, ""It’s going to be like this for 18 months or when the board decide to change. That was my point, I want to finish with that. I’m not going to quit. I will do my job until another guy is coming here to replace me.""Amorim had faced criticism for sticking to a 3-4-3 formation. Before the Leeds game, he spoke about differences over the system and difficulties in signing players suited to it. He again used the 3-4-3 against Leeds.",Manchester United sack head coach Ruben Amorim. The Portuguese had spoken about tensions within the club.

Gonzalo Garcia bagged a hat-trick for Real Madrid as they beat Real Betis 5-1 on Sunday to stay on La Liga leaders Barcelona's tail.

NEW DELHI: Bollywood actor and Northeast United FC co-owner John Abraham spoke about the situation in Indian football and called it a ""shame"".Sharing a recent video in which senior footballers appealed to FIFA to intervene as the Indian Super League (ISL) remains suspended, Abraham wrote, ""Shame on us… this is what we have come to. ""On Friday, India’s leading footballers, including Sunil Chhetri, along with several foreign players playing in the ISL, made a joint appeal to FIFA, asking the world governing body to step in as the country’s top-tier league continues to remain on hold.With the 2025-26 ISL season yet to begin, senior national team players such as Chhetri, Gurpreet Singh Sandhu and Sandesh Jhingan spoke about the uncertainty, warning that Indian football is moving towards what they described as ""permanent paralysis"".""It’s January and we should be on your screens as apart of a competitive football game in the Indian Super League,"" Gurpreet said in a joint video message shared on social media.""Instead, here we are driven by fear and desperation to say aloud something which we all know,"" Jhingan added.The players said the All India Football Federation (AIFF) is no longer able to fulfil its responsibilities and asked FIFA to intervene to protect the future of football in the country.""But more importantly, we are here to make a plea. Indian football governance is no longer able to fulfil its responsibilities.We are now staring at a permanent paralysis. This is the last-ditch effort to save what we can. So we are calling the FIFA to step in and do what it takes to save Indian football,"" other players said.They also stressed that the appeal was not political.""We hope this message gets to the power that are in Zurich. This call is not political, it is not driven by confrontation but by necessity. It might sound like a big word but the truth is that we are facing a humanitarian, sporting and economic crisis. And of course, we need rescuing at the earliest. We just want to play football, please help us do it,"" the players said.""Players, staff, owners and the fans deserve clarity, protection and more importantly, a future,"" Chhetri said.The 2025-26 ISL season was put on hold in July due to uncertainty over the renewal of the Master Rights Agreement (MRA) between the AIFF and the league’s former organisers, Football Sports Development Limited (FSDL).The agreement expired on December 8, leading to a contractual deadlock that required intervention from the Supreme Court. Under the supervision of a court-appointed committee, a tender was issued for the ISL’s commercial rights, but it did not attract any bidders.On Thursday, 13 of the 14 ISL clubs informed the AIFF that they ""may be ready and willing"" to participate in the delayed season if there is no participation fee and if the federation takes responsibility for organisational and operational costs of a shortened tournament.Meanwhile, the AIFF said on Saturday that the start date of the delayed ISL season will be announced next week after the Coordination Committee submitted its report.Following a meeting of its Emergency Committee, the AIFF said it will conduct the league, though clubs had raised concerns earlier.News agency PTI reported that that the AIFF may propose February 15 as the start date for the 2025-26 ISL season.""The AIFF Emergency Committee met today (January 3, 2025) to consider and acknowledge the report submitted by the AIFF-ISL Coordination Committee.

A looming cap hit pushes Baltimore toward a risky but necessary extension





Lamar Jackson’s future with the Baltimore Ravens has become one of the most pressing storylines of the upcoming NFL offseason. The former MVP still has two years left on his contract, yet the financial pressure tied to it is forcing difficult conversations within the organization.Baltimore is coming off a disappointing end to the 2025 season, missing the playoffs for the first time since 2021. According to Spotrac’s Michael Ginnitti, Jackson is projected to command a four-year, $250 million extension. That projection has raised eyebrows, especially since Jackson already has two seasons and $104 million remaining on his current five-year contract.The timing is the big issue here, as Jackson’s cap hit is scheduled to spike to a shocking $74.5 million, a figure that could swallow nearly a quarter of Baltimore’s salary cap in 2026. ESPN’s Jamison Hensley has described that number as nearly impossible to manage. The Ravens have immediate roster holes, particularly on the defensive side of the ball.Hensley explained, saying, “This cap wall makes Jackson’s extension not a reward but rather a financial necessity. The Ravens will be extremely limited with what they can do in free agency if they don’t lower Jackson’s cap figure. The team likely needs to sign him to a new contract.”This is not unfamiliar territory, as extension rumors surfaced last offseason as well.One reason, according to Hensley, is Jackson’s unique approach, as he represents himself and prefers to handle negotiations directly. Jackson himself has shown little interest in discussing his future right now. He said, “I’m not even thinking about that right now, to be honest with you, I’m still caught up in what just happened. That’s not my focus right now.”Baltimore’s season unfortunately ended with a heartbreaking 26-24 loss to Pittsburgh in Week 18, despite Jackson throwing three touchdowns. The loss ended a frustrating year and intensified questions about where the franchise goes next.Also read: Lamar Jackson’s blunt one-word response after Ravens’ upsetting playoff exit highlights officiating questions and a defining offseason ahead",Lamar Jackson has two seasons and $104 million remaining on his current contract.

Hudson’s visibility keeps fueling debate as Belichick’s future remains a talking point





Jordon Hudson has been constantly receiving flak from fans for his relationship with Bill Belichick. However, she has been unfazed and is now entering the new year by treating haters with the perfect response against hate comments. The 24-year-old sparked fresh conversation this week after reposting a viral GIF that humorously showed her sprinting past defenders on a football field.Hudson’s online activity comes after months of intense backlash tied to her relationship with Belichick. Some fans and donors have openly criticized her influence, arguing that her presence has distracted from football. Her caption was simple and playful, which showed support for the coach as well as answering back at haters with subtlety and class.Hudson captioned her post with a witty comment that read, ""Put me in, Coach."" Her relationship continues to be a topic of discussion among fans and even popular personalities. One email sent to the university read, “What a total embarrassment to UNC. I am withdrawing all my donations and future donations.” Others echoed similar concerns, including law and government professor Christopher McLaughlin, who questioned athletic leadership directly.In a scathing statement, McLaughlin said, “When you agreed to pay a king’s ransom to hire Bill Belichick, did you also know that you were hiring Jordon Hudson to serve as the primary face of UNC athletics?” He urged the school to remove what he called an “embarrassment” and end the “circus.”Despite the noise, Hudson has made it clear she has no intention of stepping back. She closed out 2025 with a direct message to critics on Instagram Stories. She famously wrote, ""Keep swinging, Keyboard Warriors. Your illusion of righteousness only fuels my authenticity."" Her new post shows that she has carried on that confident attitude into the new yearMeanwhile, Belichick continues to focus publicly on football. His commitment to UNC was reinforced by successfully recruiting quarterback Billy Edwards Jr. away from Wisconsin, a move that ended some speculation about his immediate departure. Following the Atlanta Falcons’ decision to fire Raheem Morris after a 16-18 record, reports resurfaced linking Belichick to the job.Also read: Jordon Hudson fires back at critics with New Year’s message amid romance with 73-year-old Bill Belichick","Jordon Hudson has been receiving flak from fans for her relationship with Bill Belichick.

What happened on the Fortnight set that led Josh Charles to criticize Travis Kelce publicly



Josh Charles Called Travis Kelce a D*ck on the Set of Taylor Swift’s Music Video | The Tonight Show





Josh Charles reveals why he called Travis Kelce a “d***” and the moment has since taken on a life far bigger than a playful on-set confession. What began as a candid remark rooted in football loyalty unfolded into an unexpectedly warm exchange that blended sports rivalry, pop culture, and personal honesty.For Charles, a lifelong Baltimore Ravens supporter, emotions were still raw when he crossed paths with the Kansas City Chiefs star during the filming of Taylor Swift’s Fortnight music video. The meeting happened long after a painful AFC Championship loss, and that memory lingered. Yet what followed was less about grudges and more about how perceptions can shift when competitive fire cools.The story surfaced when Charles appeared on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, where humor quickly set the tone. Recalling the encounter, he admitted, ""I’ve always liked Travis Kelce, I thought he was cool, but that year they beat us in the AFC championship game — they beat the Ravens — he was a real j**k that year."" Charles did not hold back, adding that when they finally met, he told Kelce directly, “You know I always liked you, and this year you were kind of a D-*-*-*. ”Instead of offense, the response surprised him. “He laughed, and he said, ‘You know what, you’re right,' ” Charles recalled, a moment that instantly dissolved the tension.The exchange happened against the surreal backdrop of Swift’s Fortnight set, where Charles and Ethan Hawke played lab scientists in a stylized scene inspired by Frankenstein. That creative environment sparked unexpected conversations. Charles later shared his admiration for Swift, writing on Instagram, ""I’ve admired Taylor for a long time, but meeting her in person took my fandom to a whole new level,” before praising her as “Genuine, kind, approachable, and just an all around stellar human being — Not to mention a kick a*s director to boot!""Kelce, it turned out, left an equally strong impression. Their talk moved quickly from the awkward confession to football strategy and mutual respect. Charles explained that Kelce admitted the Chiefs were “most worried about that game” and leaned into extra confidence for a reason. The swagger, once annoying, suddenly made sense.By the end of their conversation, Charles’ view had fully changed. “He’s such a good dude,” he later told Fallon. “I really like him.”Also Read: Matt Kalil breaks silence with lawsuit, targeting ex Haley Kalil over humiliating viral comments claims","Actor Josh Charles called Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce a ""d***"" on the set of Taylor Swift's Fortnight music video.

Golden Raye Mahomes captures hearts as Patrick Mahomes hints at comeback



Brittany Mahomes insta stories (Instagram)





Golden Raye Mahomes is growing up right before the eyes of NFL fans, and Brittany Mahomes is clearly savoring every fleeting moment. With her first birthday arriving on January 12, the youngest member of the Mahomes family is already stealing attention in ways only a one year old can. Brittany’s latest post did not feel staged or flashy. It felt personal. A quiet snapshot that showed how quickly baby curls, bright smiles, and personality arrive when no one is ready for them.That sense of time moving too fast has followed the Mahomes family through an unusual stretch. Golden has spent much of her first year around stadium lights, winter sidelines, and family routines shaped by football. Even as the Chiefs struggled and Patrick Mahomes suffered a season ending knee injury in Week 15, Golden remained a constant presence. Whether bundled up at games or matching outfits with Brittany and her siblings, she brought warmth to a difficult chapter.Brittany’s recent photo focused on one simple detail that parents know all too well. The long curl resting gently on Golden’s head. Her caption said it all: “The prettiest curl 🥹”. It was not about style or trends. It was about noticing growth in the smallest places. Those curls symbolize how far Golden has come since the offseason glimpses fans remember.Patrick Mahomes has also been more visible with his family as he recovers from surgery and faces his first playoff absence in nine seasons. He welcomed the new year alongside Brittany, Golden, Sterling, and Bronze, standing under fireworks with a brace still on his leg. Moments like that rarely make highlight reels, yet they matter just as much.That theme continued online when Patrick shared two contrasting Instagram photos. One showed him walking off the field with his head down. The next captured him airborne in the end zone, crowd roaring behind him. His caption was short and deliberate: “⏰,”. Fans immediately sensed meaning. Brittany did too. She responded with three red heart emojis and reposted the images, adding, “My guy,” over the carousel.Together, these moments tell a fuller story. A superstar athlete healing. A young family adjusting. And a baby girl approaching her first birthday, unaware of how many people are rooting for her next steps. With Golden’s milestone just days away, there is no doubt more memories are waiting to be shared.Also Read: “A broken back…”: Brittany Mahomes shares alarming health update amid Patrick Mahomes’ own rehab","Golden Raye Mahomes is growing up right before the eyes of NFL fans.

John Harbaugh fired by Ravens signals a franchise crossroads







John Harbaugh getting fired by Ravens marks the end of an era that shaped Baltimore football for nearly two decades. The decision came on Tuesday, stunning fans who had grown used to stability on the sideline. Harbaugh was not just a coach. He became the public face of a franchise that valued toughness, discipline, and consistency, even when results grew uneven.The timing added drama. His final game came against Pittsburgh, the Ravens’ fiercest rival, coached by Mike Tomlin, the only NFL head coach with a longer active tenure. A missed field goal sealed an 8-9 finish and closed the book on a season that began with Super Bowl hopes and ended in frustration.Harbaugh leaves Baltimore as the most successful coach the organization has ever known. From 2008 to 2025, he posted a 180-113 record, reached the playoffs 12 times, won six AFC North titles, and lifted the Lombardi Trophy after the 2012 season. That championship run, capped by a Super Bowl win over his brother Jim, remains one of the defining moments in league history.Yet football is a forward-looking business. As seasons passed, postseason breakthroughs became rare. Despite the brilliance of Lamar Jackson , a two-time MVP, January wins did not follow with the same regularity.Baltimore advanced past the Divisional Round only once after that Super Bowl triumph. Inside the organization, the sense grew that potential remained untapped.The 2025 season sharpened that feeling. Expectations soared. Results fell short. Ownership reportedly questioned whether the current structure could still push the team over the final hurdle. Harbaugh had signed an extension through 2028 just months earlier, which made the move even more jarring. Still, performance often outweighs loyalty in the NFL.Harbaugh handled the speculation with the same direct tone he used throughout his career. He said, ""I try to do the job, not try to keep the job,"" Harbaugh told reporters last month. ""My focus has been for the last 18 years here and the last 41 years in coaching is to try to do the best job I can today and fight as hard as I can so the guys have the best chance to be successful today. And anything after today, I'm not thinking about because it's not given for us to think about. ""Now, Baltimore turns to the future. The search will likely lean toward offensive minds who can elevate Jackson’s prime years. Names inside league circles include Todd Monken, Klint Kubiak, Mike LaFleur, and Kliff Kingsbury. Whoever steps in inherits a strong roster, a demanding fan base, and the shadow of a coach who made winning the norm.Replacing Harbaugh will not be easy. His legacy set a standard. The next chapter must prove it can reach higher.Also Read: Meet Lamar Jackson’s adorable daughter Milan and the quiet family life he protects away from NFL spotlight","Harbaugh leaves Baltimore as the most successful coach the organization has ever known.

Matt Kalil’s lawsuit details reveal claims of privacy invasion and unjust enrichment







Matt Kalil's lawsuit took a sharp turn this week as the former NFL star stepped out of the shadows to confront remarks he says crossed every personal boundary.After years of keeping his private life off-limits, Kalil is now at the center of a legal battle that blends celebrity, social media culture, and the high cost of viral fame. The 36-year-old former Carolina Panthers lineman has filed a lawsuit that signals frustration, not spectacle. At its core, the case argues that retirement did not end his right to privacy, especially when deeply personal claims become online entertainment.Kalil’s complaint, obtained by TMZ Sports, points to a single moment that changed everything. He says his quiet post-football life unraveled after his ex-wife, influencer and model Haley Kalil, appeared on Marlon Garcia’s popular “Mar-Athon” stream in November 2025. What followed, according to the filing, was not casual chatter but public exposure of intimate details he never agreed to share.In the lawsuit, Kalil alleges Haley “implied that the size of Plaintiff's genitalia was a primary factor in the parties' divorce and claimed that s-xual intercourse with Plaintiff would leave her ‘in tears.’” During the same stream, she described it as “two coke cans, maybe even a third” and suggested it pushed them toward divorce, which she filed for in 2022.Kalil argues those words did real damage. He says the viral clip triggered “unwanted attention and invasive commentary from the public,” turning his body and past marriage into open discussion. The filing adds that his family members “have been forced to endure the ongoing public circulation of these degrading and deeply personal statements,” a burden he says no private citizen should carry.The impact did not stop with him. Kalil claims his new wife became a target as well, receiving messages that grew “increasingly frequent, disturbing, and alarming in nature over time.” While his family faced the fallout, the lawsuit alleges Haley was able to “financially benefit from this surge in traffic” as engagement and viewership spiked.Legally, Kalil is pursuing claims of invasion of privacy for sharing “highly intimate and private facts regarding Plaintiff's physical person and s-xual life.” He also alleges unjust enrichment, stating Haley “received substantial financial benefit, increased viewership, increased engagement, and monetization through various social media platforms and media coverage.”Kalil is requesting a jury trial and damages “on all causes asserted in the complaint,” with the amount exceeding $75,000. For him, the lawsuit is less about headlines and more about drawing a line between public curiosity and personal dignity.Also Read: Cooper DeJean’s rumored link with Nikki Bella sparks age-gap debate while Eagles defender focuses on Super Bowl defense","Former NFL star Matt Kalil has filed a lawsuit against his ex-wife, Haley Kalil.

Why did the Cowboys fire Matt Eberflus? Jerry Jones calls it the first step toward higher expectations,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/why-did-the-cowboys-fire-matt-eberflus-jerry-jones-calls-it-the-first-step-toward-higher-expectations/articleshow/126384260.cms,"The Dallas Cowboys have fired defensive coordinator Matt Eberflus after a historically poor defensive season. The team's struggles, marked by a last-place ranking in scoring defense and a lack of takeaways, led to a necessary reset. With key offensive players on limited contracts, the urgency to fix the defense quickly is paramount for the team's Super Bowl window.

Jerry Jones explains why Dallas pulled the plug on Matt Eberflus





The Dallas Cowboys did not wait long to draw a line under a season that spiraled out of control. One year after reshaping the defensive staff with optimism, the franchise hit reset again, signaling impatience with results that fell far below expectations. The decision carried weight, not just because of the numbers, but because of what they revealed about a team drifting from its identity.The Dallas Cowboys finished the year with a defense that could not stop momentum or opponents. Losses piled up, frustration grew louder, and the pressure on leadership became unavoidable. By early January, the verdict was clear. Change was no longer a discussion point. It was a necessity.Matt Eberflus’ exit came after a historically poor defensive showing. The Cowboys allowed 511 points across the season, ranked last in scoring defense, and sat near the bottom in total yards and turnovers. Even late roster moves failed to stop the slide. A 34–17 loss to the New York Giants became the breaking point, exposing issues that had lingered all year.Jerry Jones addressed the move with honesty and restraint, balancing respect with accountability.""Having known Matt Eberflus for decades now,"" Jones said. ""We have tremendous respect and appreciation for him as a coach and a person.""After reviewing and discussing the results of our defensive performance this season, though, it was clear that change is needed. This is the first step in that process, and we will continue that review as it applies to reaching our much higher expectations.""Eberflus faced challenges from the start, including the preseason trade of Micah Parsons, which stripped the defense of its most disruptive force. Still, the collapse ran deeper than personnel. Coverage breakdowns, poor red-zone execution, and a lack of takeaways became weekly themes.Now, Dallas turns its attention forward. With Dak Prescott and CeeDee Lamb under contract for only two more seasons, urgency defines every decision. Names like Brian Flores have surfaced as potential solutions, but whoever steps in will inherit a simple mandate. Fix the defense fast, or the window closes just as quickly as it opened.Also Read: “I'll talk to my wife and…”: Aaron Rodgers’ wife Brittani plays a growing role in his uncertain Steelers future","Dallas Cowboys have fired defensive coordinator Matt Eberflus.

Cooper DeJean dating rumors spark buzz as Eagles playoff focus intensifies







Cooper DeJean is stepping into the loudest stretch of his young NFL career with far bigger stakes than internet chatter. The Philadelphia Eagles are in playoff mode, chasing a rare repeat Super Bowl run, and the rookie cornerback is expected to be a central piece of that push. Still, when a rising star is spotted in public with a global celebrity, attention shifts fast, whether he wants it or not.That shift came after DeJean was seen spending time with WWE icon Nikki Bella during an Eagles home game weekend. Photos, social posts, and a few well-timed sightings sparked nonstop talk, amplified by Bella proudly showing off DeJean jerseys and Eagles-themed outfits. What began as curiosity quickly turned into a full-blown dating debate, fueled by a notable age gap and two very public lives colliding.Reports since then have painted two very different pictures. The Daily Mail leaned hard into romance, claiming Bella is ""smitten."" TMZ, however, urged caution, noting that while the pair have gone on several dates, Bella, and likely DeJean as well, ""is still very single and enjoying life."" The contrast reflects how quickly speculation can outrun facts when athletes and entertainers cross paths.Context matters here. Bella’s personal life has been under intense scrutiny following her divorce from Artem Chigvintsev, finalized after a long and public split.The former couple share a five-year-old son, Matteo, and Bella did not file for divorce until 2024. DeJean, meanwhile, quietly exited a long-term relationship with his college sweetheart, Steph Wilfawn, after his profile exploded on football’s biggest stage.That stage arrived when DeJean delivered one of the most memorable plays in recent Super Bowl history, intercepting Patrick Mahomes and returning it for a touchdown in a shocking blowout win. Overnight, he went from promising rookie to Philadelphia folk hero. Fame followed, and with it, an unavoidable spotlight on his personal life.At the end of the day, two consenting adults spending time together is hardly scandalous. Bella’s visible support for the Eagles, including playful trash talk aimed at Detroit Lions fans, only adds fuel for fans who enjoy the crossover drama. But inside the Eagles locker room, priorities are far simpler.For DeJean, the real story is not who he sits next to at a bar. It is whether he can stay locked in, sharpen his coverage, and help deliver something once thought impossible: back-to-back Lombardi Trophies for Philadelphia.Also Read: Dak Prescott’s candid words after Giants loss reveal why this Cowboys season feels more frustrating than ever",Cooper DeJean was seen with WWE icon Nikki Bella during an Eagles home game weekend.

What promise did Chloe Kim make to Myles Garrett?

While the Browns missed the playoffs, the moment carried personal meaning. Girlfriend Chloe Kim celebrated the milestone on social media, praising Garrett and promising to bake him cinnamon rolls, a gesture fans found heartfelt and genuine.

Chloe Kim’s reaction adds a human layer to a historic record





Myles Garrett’s season ended without a playoff berth, but his final statement on the field carried historic weight. In a tight Week 18 win over the Bengals, the Browns star delivered a moment that cut through a difficult year and redefined individual excellence. One late rush, one clean finish, and a long-standing NFL mark finally fell.What followed was not just league-wide recognition, but something quieter and more personal. As Cleveland closed the book on a 5–12 season and organizational uncertainty loomed, Garrett’s achievement stood alone. It was not about standings or futures. It was about dominance, discipline, and a defender reaching a peak few ever touch.Garrett’s 23rd sack of the 2025 season did more than seal a win. It pushed him past Michael Strahan’s 22.5-sack record from 2001, a number that survived for nearly 25 years and even held firm when TJ Watt matched it in 2021. This time, there was no tie. Garrett owned it outright.Among the first to celebrate was his girlfriend, Olympic snowboarder Chloe Kim, who shared her pride with fans in a way that felt warm and real. Posting a photo of Garrett smiling while holding a roll of cinnamon, Kim wrote, ""Proud of you!!!"" She followed it with a promise that instantly went viral: ""Baking you all the cinnamon rolls your heart desires!!"" The message ended with a heart emoji, simple and sincere.Kim also reshared the Browns’ official graphic honoring the record, punctuating it with four exclamation points. No long captions. No speeches. Just joy.Their relationship, first spotted publicly in May 2025, has grown quietly alongside Garrett’s on-field brilliance. From award shows in Japan to sideline appearances in Cleveland, Kim has been present for key moments. This one mattered most.While the Browns now face a reset after parting ways with Kevin Stefanski, Garrett’s record stands as a reminder. Even in turbulent seasons, greatness can still rise. And sometimes, it is celebrated with cinnamon rolls and a proud smile.Also Read: “I tried to do things”: Myles Garrett’s girlfriend Chloe Kim reflects on mental health struggles and life with the NFL star","Myles Garrett recorded his 23rd sack of the season, breaking a record that stood for nearly 25 years.

Did Jaxson Dart spark a feud with Justin Herbert over Maddison Beer? The truth behind the viral posts,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/did-jaxson-dart-spark-a-feud-with-justin-herbert-over-maddison-beer-the-truth-behind-the-viral-posts/articleshow/126375098.cms,"Rookie quarterback Jaxson Dart's impactful NFL debut for the Giants was nearly overshadowed by a viral rumor. The fabricated story, originating from a parody account, falsely claimed Dart mocked Justin Herbert and pursued Madison Beer. The hoax quickly unraveled, revealing Dart's only connection was a past comment about Beer being his celebrity crush.

How a viral rumor spiraled and why it fell apart





Jaxson Dart’s first NFL moment arrived quietly on paper but loudly in impact. Back in September, 2025, the rookie quarterback guided the New York Giants to an unexpected 21–18 win over the Los Angeles Chargers, showing calm control rather than flashy numbers. That alone was enough to draw attention. What followed, however, was a reminder of how quickly online speculation can hijack a sports conversation and turn it into something it never was.As excitement around Dart’s debut spread, social media latched onto a rumor that had nothing to do with play calling or footwork. Instead, it pulled Justin Herbert and pop star Madison Beer into a storyline that felt dramatic, clickable, and completely detached from reality. For a brief stretch, the noise nearly overshadowed what should have been a clean football headline.The claim suggested Dart mocked Herbert by posting and deleting a photo of Madison Beer with the caption “Gameday tomorrow,” just before the Giants and Chargers faced off. The screenshot raced across X, pulling in millions of views within hours. After the Giants won, a second post claimed Beer had unfollowed Herbert and followed Dart instead, further pushing the idea of a personal feud.The most sensational piece came next. A clip circulated alleging Dart shared a mall video with the caption “@madisonbeer come fw me [kissing emoji].” That single post pushed the story into full viral mode.None of it held up. Every post traced back to a parody account built to look authentic. The account used a blue checkmark, a professional logo, and familiar formatting to mimic real sports news pages. Many fans and even some platforms shared the content without verification. Once flagged, the account was clearly labeled as parody, exposing the hoax.The truth was far simpler. Dart never posted, deleted, or hinted at anything involving Beer or Herbert. The only real connection dated back to a red carpet moment before his NFL debut, when Dart casually named Beer as his celebrity crush. That harmless comment later became the seed for a false narrative.With time and clarity, the story faded. Dart’s debut win remained real. The online feud did not. In hindsight, the episode stands as a case study in how fast manufactured drama can spread when facts take a back seat.Also Read: Tom Brady fuels nonstop dating rumors after being repeatedly linked to younger celebrities since his split from Gisele Bündchen","Jaxson Dart's NFL debut was nearly overshadowed by a viral rumor.

Lamar Jackson daughter Milan and his life away from the NFL





Lamar Jackson’s daughter Milan Jackson changed the rhythm of his life long before fans ever caught a glimpse of her. The Ravens quarterback has built a career on speed, poise, and control, and those same qualities shape how he approaches fatherhood. While Sundays often spotlight his highs and lows on the field, his quieter role as a dad reveals a steadier, more personal side that few get to see.Jackson entered fatherhood in January 2021, choosing privacy over publicity. In a league where personal milestones are often broadcast instantly, he kept this chapter close, letting time pass before sharing even the smallest hint. That choice set the tone. Milan would grow up protected, introduced to the world on his terms, not the internet’s.The public first learned about Milan months after her birth, when Jackson shared a Halloween photo that caught fans off guard. Dressed as Pebbles from The Flintstones, the baby instantly became a talking point. When a reporter later asked about her and mistakenly used the wrong name, Jackson calmly corrected him.“Her name is Milan,” he said. “I just call her Lani.”Asked about the costume, his pride was unmistakable. “Pebbles from The Flintstones.You liked it? She look good?” The smile behind those words said more than any stat line ever could. He even hinted she was nearby on game day, present but intentionally kept out of view.Milestones since then have been shared sparingly but warmly. On Milan’s first birthday, Jackson posted a joyful image of her laughing with food on her face, paired with a simple message that captured his affection. “🤣🤣Happy 1st Girl day Mami.” Another photo showed her bundled up in winter gear, prompting him to joke about her dislike for the cold. These moments felt unpolished and real, offering a rare window into his world.Family plays a strong role in how Jackson parents. Raised by his mother, Felicia Jones, after losing both his father and grandmother at a young age, he learned resilience early. That background informs his protective instincts today. Milan is surrounded by a close-knit family, including a doting grandmother, aunts, and an uncle who has long supported Jackson’s journey.Even after tough losses, like the recent setback against Detroit, Jackson’s identity off the field remains unchanged. Beyond the noise of the NFL, he is simply a father devoted to one little girl, choosing presence over exposure and meaning over headlines.Also Read: Dak Prescott’s candid words after Giants loss reveal why this Cowboys season feels more frustrating than ever","Lamar Jackson's daughter, Milan, was born in January 2021.

She admitted the news turned her world upside down, but later said the experience led to growth, acceptance, and a deep bond with Brady’s son, whom she calls her “bonus child.”

Gisele Bündchen on the shock that changed everything

Gisele Bündchen opens up about new chapter





Gisele Bündchen has never rushed to explain her private life, but a resurfaced passage from her memoir is again drawing attention for its honesty. Long before fame framed her marriage and eventual split from Tom Brady, the supermodel faced an emotional moment that tested her sense of stability early in their relationship. The revelation feels timely now, as Brady’s personal life once again fuels public speculation.The reflection comes from a period when Bündchen was still learning what it meant to share a future with someone whose past was not neatly closed. What followed was not just discomfort or jealousy, but a sudden shift in how she understood love, patience, and growth. It is a moment that helped shape the woman she would later become.Bündchen detailed the experience in her memoir Lessons: My Path to a Meaningful Life, recalling how she reacted after learning that Brady’s former partner, actress Bridget Moynahan , was pregnant with his child shortly after Bündchen and Brady began dating.“The very next day, the news was everywhere, and I felt my world had been turned upside down. Needless to say, that wasn't an easy time. But it was a time that brought so much growth,” she wrote.At the time, Brady had already moved forward emotionally, but the reality forced Bündchen to confront a situation she had not anticipated. Over time, her perspective shifted. When Brady and Moynahan’s son Jack was born, Bündchen said something inside her softened. Rather than resentment, she found unexpected love.She later described Jack as her “bonus child” and credited him with awakening her own desire to become a mother. What began as shock evolved into acceptance, then into a deeper understanding of family beyond traditional boundaries.The re-emergence of the memoir today is accompanied by new interest in the alleged relationships of Brady, such as that he is reported to have been involved with influencer Alix Earle. Although such assertions are yet to be verified, such words by Bundchen will provide an infrequent glimpse into how she used to maneuver her way through the emotional darkness with grace.The results of her thoughts are permanent. Growth can even establish itself even in situations that seem destabilizing. In the case of Bundchen, such an early heartbreak did not make her story, but it silently changed it.Also Read: “I’m grateful for…”: Gisele Bündchen opens up on motherhood, healing, and life beyond Tom Brady","Gisele Bündchen said she felt blindsided when she learned Tom Brady had fathered a child with an ex.

Brittany Mahomes shows strength after long recovery journey





As the NFL season winds down, recovery has become the new grind inside the Mahomes household. While Patrick Mahomes begins a long road back from a serious knee injury, his wife Brittany is quietly marking a personal comeback of her own. Nearly two years after suffering a fractured back following childbirth, Brittany’s latest update shows just how far patience and discipline can carry an athlete beyond the spotlight.Her career has not been hot or fast-tracked. It has been stable, deliberate and very physical. After finding herself set aside by pain and lack of movement, Brittany is now back in the gym regaining strength that was previously unattainable. The timing matters. As Kansas City heads into an off season of uncertainty, her progress provides a much needed bell of reprieve in an in-between of rehab schedules and health care timelines.Brittany Mahomes first opened up about her condition in early 2024, months after welcoming daughter Golden Raye. The injury forced her to pause a lifestyle built around fitness and movement. By mid 2024, she shared encouraging news while speaking to E! News.“I’m doing great,” Brittany Mahomes told E! News in 2024. “I’m living my best life. My back is no longer broken, so that’s good. I’m finally fully recovered and back to doing the things that I’ve always been able to do. I’m staying on top of my health.”This week, she reinforced that message through action. A video shared by her fitness instructor showed Brittany performing barbell back squats, a demanding movement that places direct strain on the spine. The post reflected on how far she has come.“a year and a half ago, rehabbing a broken back meant severe pain and limited movement. now, almost a year postpartum and progressively getting stronger every week. proof that the body is capable of incredible things when you meet it with patience and intentional training. so proud of you @brittanylynne 🤍”While Brittany rebuilds strength, Patrick Mahomes continues rehab after surgery on a torn ACL and MCL. Chiefs head coach Andy Reid recently said the quarterback is “doing great” early in recovery. Together, their parallel paths highlight resilience, consistency, and the quiet work that happens long after the final whistle.Also Read: Brittany Mahomes’ message to Patrick Mahomes' mom Randi catches attention during Chiefs downfall","Brittany Mahomes shared a health update nearly two years after fracturing her back following childbirth.

Kobe Bryant welcomes Stephen Curry to the league

Stephen Curry proved his “scout’s reports” incorrect







Every NBA legend has a ""Welcome to the League"" moment, but few are as cinematic as the one Stephen Curry experienced during his rookie year. Long before he was a four-time champion and the greatest shooter to ever live, Curry was just a skinny kid from Davidson trying to find his footing against the giants of the game. In his latest book and documentary project, Shot Ready, Curry recounts a specific encounter with the late, great Kobe Bryant that perfectly encapsulated the ""Mamba Mentality."" It wasn't a moment of mentorship or a friendly conversation, it was a raw, unfiltered reaction from a competitor who realized, perhaps for the first time, that the kid in front of him was built differently.Stephen Curry remembers his welcome to the NBA moment against Lakers when Kobe Bryant made sure to give the rookie a taste of the game. Curry was “switched on to him” and had to continuously bear the “infamous body bumps.”Curry shared another instance from his rookie year against the Lakers.“There was that moment in my rookie year when we were playing the Lakers, and I hit a shot off the glass… they zoomed in on Kobe, and he said a word I can’t repeat,” said Curry with a smile while watching the clip. While the exact words remain a mystery to the public, the sentiment was clear.The Mamba officially acknowledged your talent.The baby-faced assassin also recounted another Lakers vs Warriors moment from a preseason game in 2014, when Bryant had Curry on full-court defensive lockdown. Despite the continuous body contact and a minor slip, Curry shot a 3 over him, and what followed was a staredown. From Curry, it was a statement that “you can’t push me around,” and for Kobe Bryant, it was a moment where he knew the league was in good hands.Ultimately, this moment served as a bridge between two eras of basketball. Kobe Bryant didn't give out compliments easily, and he certainly didn't give them to rookies who hadn’t proved themselves. He not only acknowledged Curry’s talent but also his calmness and his presence that screams even without doing anything.For Curry, that interaction wasn't just about a made basket, it was the validation he needed to know he belonged on the same floor as his idols. It was also the moment to prove that the Scout’s report was wrong, which labelled him as “far below the NBA standard.” It reminds everyone that greatness recognizes greatness, often in the most unexpected and unfiltered moments. Years later, we see that Kobe was right, that kid with the bank shot was indeed a ""serious, serious problem"" for the rest of the NBA.Also read: “He controlled the market”: Rich Paul breaks downs how Michael Jordan built an empire without social media","Stephen Curry recalls Kobe Bryant's ""Welcome to the League"" moment in his new book, Shot Ready.

Stephen Curry has been in talks for being inducted into the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame. However, according to sources, that is not happening anytime before the year 2031. But it will definitely happen. Recently, former NBA legend Vince Carter surprised the athlete in Toronto for a short but extensive interview. Carter asked Curry about his dream presenters when he is inducted into the Hall of Fame. Curry instantly revealed the names that crossed his mind and it included Hall of Famer Carter.This is not the only thing that the duo talked about. Stephen had a long-lasting impression on the youth, influencing their interest in basketball. The same goes for Carter as well. Both Curry and Carter talked about how their game has influenced the young athletes and how they feel about bringing a wave of change within the sport, as well as the league.Vince Carter surprised the Golden State Warriors legend Stephen Curry during a recent interview. While the duo talked about a vast range of topics, a particular statement made the highlight of the interview. Carter asked Curry, “Hall of Famer, when your time comes, who will be sitting up there with you? Have you ever thought about that?” The question amused the NBA athlete as he proceeded to reveal the names.Curry replied, “I actually haven’t. ”Even though the Warriors legend had not given a thought about the names before, he did have a few names that instantly crossed his mind. “I mean you [Vince Carter], Steve Nash, Reggie Miller and Ray [Allen] are like the names to think off top my head. Those are my guys though. It's crazy to even say it out loud. I guess the only thing is being able to embrace the fact that there are less days ahead on the court than they were behind. ” Steph further added, “So I don’t run away from the fact of your basketball mortality. I know that I don’t have that many years left. The idea of just honing it on and now. Like there is a sense of urgency at the moment, because I still have lots to prove on the court. I won’t get too ahead of myself.” Stephen demonstrated his humble attitude through the reply. Even though fans do believe that the athlete is worthy of the Hall of Fame induction, Stephen rather tends to believe that he has so much more to do within the court.The Golden State Warriors legend, during the interview, was asked how he felt about changing the game since he joined the league. The follow-up question talked about if he had embraced it yet. Steph replied, “This is how I play the game. This is how I know I can be successful and my creativity kind of express that way.” The athlete talked about how he has seen progress in the game ever since he joined. More 3-pointers are being scored and that has even reached the grassroots level. Talking about his influence, he stated, “I love that kids are inspired. I want the kids to have fun while playing the game.”",Vince Carter surprised the Golden State Warriors legend Stephen Curry during a recent interview.

Rich Paul names Michael Jordan’s empire four most important pillars







When one talks about Michael Jordan, it usually revolves around the six rings, the ""Flu Game,"" or the sheer competitive fire that scorched anyone in his path. But recently, Klutch Sports founder Rich Paul literally brought a whiteboard to break down Michael Jordan’s undisputable dominance in the footwear industry through the Jordan brand. In a world before social media, where you couldn't just post a fit pic to millions of followers, Jordan didn’t just participate in the sports market. As Paul stated, “Michael Jordan didn’t share the market, he controlled the market.”Rich Paul’s breakdown highlights a perfect storm of corporate synergy and cultural timing that transformed a basketball player into a global deity. It wasn't just luck, it was a calculated takeover of the consumer’s subconscious.According to Paul’s whiteboard analysis, the Jordan brand was built on four distinct pillars: Nike, Gatorade, NBA, and an often overlooked ingredient, timing.Nike’s inspirational ""I believe I can fly"" motto, turned sneakers into a pair of magical shoes and had people jumping everywhere as if they were flying. It sold everyone’s childhood dream through the shoes. Gatorade hit it home with the fuel to win like Mike, while promoting the “like Mike, If i could be like Mike,” narrative.Through this association, the intention of the sports drink brand was to become synonymous with Michael Jordan’s never ending stamina and energy on court. Meanwhile, the NBA ensured that ""all eyes"" were on number 23, which helped it to promote itself through Jordan’s brilliance as a baseball player.But for Rick Paul, all these three factors were only that effective cause of the timing or as he stated “crack epidemic.” The Jordans didn’t just attract the hood but also the urban population and it became a symbol of status, power, and soaring success. And instead of social media posts, it followed a chain reaction that would resemble word-of-mouth marketing. The shoes wearers became the shoe promoters.Michael Jordan built an incontestable empireMichael Jordan’s brand wasn't built on likes or shares but on absolute word of mouth dominance. The modern athletes have more accessible tools to communicate with fans, but this easy way often pushes them to attract people’s divided attention.Jordan operated in a time when there was only one channel that mattered, and he was the only thing playing on it. By aligning elite performance with massive corporate backing and a unique cultural moment, he created a blueprint that no athlete has truly been able to replicate since. He didn't just win the game, he bought the stadium, the broadcast, and the shoes everyone wore to the arena.Also read: 5 Basketball anime every hoops fan must watch","Rich Paul names Michael Jordan’s empire four most important pillars.

Stubborn ankle sprain sidelines steady Keegan Murray as injury-hit Kings await three-week reassessment

Delayed start Murray battles stubborn thumb surgery as struggling Kings stumble at 8-28 in rough season





During a 115-98 loss to the Milwaukee Bucks on Sunday near the conclusion of the first quarter, forward Keegan Murray of the Sacramento Kings blocked a Bobby Portis shot off the glass and went coast to coast for a powerful, one-handed dunk. Murray is now labelled as a forward.This occurred following the injury he had during their January 4 loss to the Milwaukee Bucks. With 4:01 remaining in the third quarter, Murray drove to the rim, collided with Bucks centre Myles Turner, and landed awkwardly, leaving the game with a left ankle injury. Murray will be reassessed in three to four weeks, according to the Kings.He finished Sunday's game against the Bucks with 12 points and two blocks without making a comeback. Murray's ailment was identified via an MRI as a moderate left ankle sprain, which will be reassessed in three to four weeks, according to the team.While announcing the news, the official notice read:“Sacramento Kings forward Keegan Murray underwent an MRI after exiting the game with 4:01 remaining in the third quarter of Sunday night’s game versus the Milwaukee Bucks. Imaging revealed a moderate left ankle sprain. Murray will be listed as out and will be reevaluated in 3–4 weeks…”Murray has missed over half of the team's games this season due to a series of ailments.Murray had the most recent injury near the conclusion of the third quarter amid a series of setbacks that have marred his fourth NBA season. His team has had the third-worst record in the league this season due to injuries.The 25-year-old Iowa product has a moderate left ankle sprain, according to an MRI, and the 8-28 Kings said on Tuesday that he will be reevaluated in three to four weeks. Due to a ruptured thumb ligament, the fourth-year forward was out for the first fifteen games of the season. Murray has averaged 14.6 points, 6.1 rebounds, 1.2 steals, and 1.6 blocks in 19 games thus far in the 2025–26 regular season.This season, not much has gone as planned for the Sacramento Kings. They are tied for the fewest victories in the Western Conference with a current record of 8-28. With Keegan Murray, another starter, expected to lose time, injuries have undoubtedly played a role and are only becoming worse.The 2022 No. 4 overall pick made a comeback shortly before New Year's after missing two games due to a calf injury in late December. The Iowa forward, in his fourth year, has averaged 13.4 points and 5.6 rebounds on 44.9% of his field goals.Due to a ruptured UCL in his left thumb that needed surgery, Murray's 2025–26 season got off to a delayed start.

Ye bola tha maarunga. But pata nahi tha aise maarega

[Has it ever happened that you hit a six on the very first ball?] - this was the innocent, yet striking, question young Vaibhav Suryavanshi posed to a teammate just days before making his IPL debut . Who would have thought that a youngster would probe such a question. Maybe it was an insight into the mind of the 14-year-old?The match was against the Lucknow Super Giants. One of India's finest bowlers, Avesh Khan, had the ball in hand. Yashasvi Jaiswal took the strike, nudged a single, and handed over the stage to Suryavanshi. What followed was straight out of a dream — the 14-year-old launched the very first ball of his IPL career for a six, announcing his arrival with a bang.Did he manifest it? Maybe. Was it a fluke? Possibly. But let’s move to another telling moment.It’s 10 am on Monday, April 28th. Suryavanshi wakes up and makes his first call — to his childhood coach Manish Ojha. After a few exchanges about footwork and technique, Suryavanshi confidently tells him, """" (Sir, today I will smash the bowlers).[Hit (the ball), but don’t lose your wicket. Play calmly, keep talking to Yashasvi],"" the coach said.In the evening, Suryavanshi padded up, left the dugout, exchanged a fist bump with Yashasvi — and the rest, as they say, is history.The young boy’s manifestation once again came true.The 14-year-old prodigy from Samastipur, Bihar, blazed his way to a sensational 38-ball 101, becoming the youngest centurion in IPL history at just 14 years and 32 days.In a breathtaking assault at a packed Sawai Mansingh Stadium in Jaipur, Suryavanshi hammered 11 sixes and 7 fours, dismantling an attack featuring international stars like Ishant Sharma, Mohammed Siraj, Prasidh Krishna, Washington Sundar, Rashid Khan and Karim Janat.While the crowd grew hoarse from endless cheering, Suryavanshi showed no signs of slowing down, making a mockery of some of the world’s best bowlers.The left-hander brought up his century off just 35 balls against Gujarat Titans , prompting a heartwarming moment — an injured Rahul Dravid , India’s ex-coach, rose from his wheelchair, fists pumping in celebration. Dravid cheered with uncontained joy, savouring the historic moment crafted by the young opener.[He had said he would hit it. But I didn’t know he would hit it like that]. I had an instinct that something big was going to happen, but honestly, I didn’t expect it to be this big. He is a God-gifted cricketer. He’s just a kid — only 14 years old. God has blessed him with immense talent. I am really thankful to God that I could play some part in his career,"" coach Ojha said.""He always says that Rajasthan Royals have given him a huge platform, and he is determined to work hard, play well, and give his best. His ultimate dream is to play for India. He is just 14. The great Sachin Tendulkar made his ODI debut at 16, and I am sure Vaibhav is on the right path. With a legend like Rahul Dravid guiding him, he doesn’t have to worry about anything,"" the coach said.","The 14-year-old prodigy from Samastipur, Bihar, blazed his way to a sensational 38-ball 101, becoming the youngest centurion in IPL history at just 14 years and 32 days.

Axar Patel-led Delhi Capitals (DC) will be aiming for an improved batting effort in the middle overs when they face Ajinkya Rahane's Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) in their Indian Premier League (IPL) match at the Arun Jaitley Stadium on Tuesday.Delhi Capitals have struggled with their top-order performance and batting against spinners at their home ground. Despite Abishek Porel showing good timing in the previous match, he couldn't convert it into a substantial score, while Faf du Plessis's return from injury was rusty and Karun Nair failed to make an impact.KKR, meanwhile, have managed just seven points so far and are placed seventh in the standings, having failed to collect any points from their last three matches, including two losses and a no-result.Rahane will be desperate to arrest the slide and keep their playoff hopes alive, with another defeat making the task tougher. Their batting lacks a settled look, with Quinton de Kock and Rahmanullah Gurbaz being rotated in the opening slot alongside Narine, while the side has relied heavily on Rahane and youngster Angkrish Raghuvanshi to score runs. Bowling has been another area of concern, with KKR failing to break opening stands, allowing teams to post big totals - as seen in the last game where PBKS added 120 for the opening wicket.The pitch which was used for RCB's match was two-paced. It will be interesting to see what will be in store for this fixture.

Poll Will KKR's batting improve against DC after their recent struggles? No, the problems will persist Yes, they will bounce back

Shah Rukh Khan: The superstar who turned IPL into a blockbuster

After Delhi Capitals' loss to Royal Challengers Bengaluru on Sunday, mentor Kevin Pietersen said they had gone for a slow and low surface to counter their opponents' strength and held a similar strategy for the upcoming Kolkata Knight Riders on Tuesday.At the Arun Jaitley Stadium on Tuesday evening, the two teams will use the fifth pitch, which is in the centre, so there won't be a shorter side for the batters to target. And given how KKR have been batting this IPL season, they need a massive overhaul to make it count.KKR have scored the least amount of boundaries this IPL season (109) while their tally of sixes (61) is second worst. Only Chennai Super Kings have struck fewer maximums this season (49).They've scored 1245 runs this season - the lowest aggregate tally among the 10 franchises. Their average of 23.49 is the lowest. They've scored at 8.88 per over, the second worst. Again, CSK have fared poorer in comparison (8.06).Individually, there is a gulf between the top scorer Ajinkya Rahane (271 runs) and second-highest scorer Angkrish Raghuvanshi (197 runs) with Sunil Narine (151 runs) and Quinton de Kock (143 runs), Venkatesh Iyer (135 runs) all struggling to make a mark.The problems with the batting start right at the very top. Quinton de Kock and Sunil Narine have been the regular choice opening pair with exceptions made for Moeen Ali-De Kock once and twice for Narine-Rahmanullah Gurbaz, in the previous two matches.De Kock, who was missing from the KKR nets session on Monday, and Narine have only produced 109 runs in six matches this season. Their highest partnership has been a mere 46 runs, with runs coming at an average of 18.16 and run rate of 9.90.Only CSK (19.77) have a lower average at the top of the order this IPL season than KKR (19.87), and their upcoming opponents, DC (24.22).When probed about Andre Russell's under-utilisation about the franchise, Harshit Rana also mentioned the team's batting. ""This is cricket. It goes up and down. If you win two games in a row, If our batsmen [batters] perform well in two games, Then you will start saying that KKR's batting is long. So this keeps going on,"" he stated.KKR's attempts at helping their batting show will meet tough resistance from the opposite camp. On a sluggish pitch on Sunday, DC skipper Axar Patel picked up two wickets despite finding little support from others.Pacer Mitchell Starc, who went wicketless against RCB, will also be keen to make life difficult for his former team. Kuldeep Yadav will be a challenge to work around in the middle overs thanks to his deceptive googlies.Axar, Vipraj Nigam and Kuldeep could be the difference-makers for DC if KKR's track record this season is any indication. They've lost 21 wickets to spinners this season with the bowlers achieving a strike rate of 17.00 - best among the 10 teams.With batters not inspiring much confidence, the onus will be on the bowlers to push the team towards the finish line. Harshit Rana, Varun Chakaravarthy, Vaibhav Arora (11 wicket each) have been the pick of the bowlers while Narine has been a tidy customer with an economy rate of 7.75.With seven points so far in the season and 10 on offer in the remaining five matches, KKR still have a chance at qualifying for the playoffs. But after grabbing just one point in the last three matches, the Ajinkya Rahane-led franchise need to pull up their socks or prepare for an early exit. The road to that end begins against the Delhi Capitals.","KKR have scored the least amount of boundaries this IPL season (109) while their tally of sixes (61) is second worst. Only Chennai Super Kings have struck fewer maximums this season (49).They've scored 1245 runs this season - the lowest aggregate tally among the 10 franchises. Their average of 23.49 is the lowest.

NEW DELHI: Rajasthan Royals ’ 14-year-old sensation Vaibhav Suryavanshi etched his name into history on Monday, becoming the youngest player ever to score a T20 century and the fastest Indian to a hundred in IPL history.Opening against Gujarat Titans at the Sawai Mansingh Stadium in Jaipur, Suryavanshi raced to his maiden IPL century in just 35 balls — the second-fastest overall in the league, only behind Chris Gayle’s 30-ball blitz in 2013.At 14 years and 32 days, Suryavanshi shattered the previous youngest T20 century record, previously held by Vijay Zol (18 years, 118 days) in 2013.He reached the landmark with a six off Rashid Khan in the 11th over, sending the Jaipur crowd into a frenzy. Suryavanshi's whirlwind knock featured 11 sixes and seven fours before he eventually fell to Prasidh Krishna for 101 off 38 balls.The teenager was particularly brutal against Karim Janat and Ishant Sharma, hammering 30 and 28 runs off their respective overs. His assault helped Royals post 87/0 at the end of the powerplay, their highest in IPL history.Opening alongside Yashasvi Jaiswal, Suryavanshi stitched together a blistering 166-run stand in just 11.5 overs, putting Rajasthan in firm control of the 210-run chase.In addition to becoming the youngest to score an IPL fifty earlier in the innings, Suryavanshi also set the record for the fastest fifty by a Rajasthan Royals batter against Gujarat Titans. His audacious knock marks the arrival of a prodigious new star on the IPL stage.","Rajasthan Royals ’ 14-year-old sensation Vaibhav Suryavanshi etched his name into history on Monday.

Vaibhav Suryavanshi announced himself on the grandest stage of Indian T20 cricket, becoming the youngest-ever centurion in IPL history as Rajasthan Royals defeated Gujarat Titans by eight wickets in a high-scoring contest on Monday. The 14-year-old prodigy from Samastipur smashed an astonishing 101 off just 38 balls, laced with 11 towering sixes and seven fours.

Poll Do you believe the absence of Gautam Gambhir will affect KKR's performance this IPL season? Not sure No, they will manage Yes, definitely

Harshit Rana’s meteoric rise in Indian cricket is inseparable from his relationship with former Kolkata Knight Riders team mentor Gautam Gambhir. Rana’s breakthrough season at KKR came last year, when Gambhir played a pivotal role in harnessing his potential.IPL-2024 season saw Rana pick 19 wickets in 13 matches, emerging as a key architect of the team’s title-winning campaign. He didn’t look back, subsequently making his India debut across all three formats in the past six months. However, with Gambhir not there in the KKR backroom staff this IPL season, Rana is missing his presence.“The support staff is basically the same and even (Abhishek) Nayar bhai is back. But, there was a thrill factor (associated with Gambhir) that I miss a little – speaking just for myself, not anyone else,” Rana said on Monday. “I wasn’t talking about anything personal. But you also know that he (Gambhir) has an aura, the way he comes and takes the team along.I was just talking about that.” Rana has repeatedly acknowledged that Gambhir’s guidance went beyond technical advice. “If my outlook towards the game has changed, a lot of it has got to do with Gauti bhaiyya’s presence in the KKR dressing room and how he changed my mindset.At the elite level, you (do) require skills but more than skills, you require the heart to handle the pressure,” Rana had said. Although Rana has taken 11 wickets in nine matches for KKR this season so far, he has been expensive, going at 9.48 runs per over.“I’m not that happy with my performance. I’m not getting what I want. I hope that in the next five games, I’ll do better. I have to focus hard,” he said. On reverse swing, Rana said, “Reverse swing has become an important factor this season since we can use saliva now. It is definitely helping bowlers perform much better in the death overs.”","Harshit Rana's rise in Indian cricket is inseparable from his relationship with former Kolkata Knight Riders team mentor Gautam Gambhir.

Everything is special about Vaibhav Suryavanshi: Vikram Rathour

The Arun Jaitley Stadium is usually known for its batting-friendly conditions, but there has been a shift in dynamics this IPL season. While the pitch continues to favour batters, offering a hard surface and short boundaries conducive to high scores, spinners have found increasing assistance as a match progresses.The dry nature of the pitch has led to wear and tear, providing turn and grip for spinners in the latter stages of games. This dual nature of the Kotla pitch has forced teams to strategize meticulously, balancing aggressive batting lineups with effective spinners.With Delhi Capitals taking on defending champions Kolkata Knight Riders on Tuesday, the pitch is getting a lot of eyeballs, especially after Sunday’s DC-RCB saw both teams struggling to get to middling totals. Despite the loss to RCB, the Capitals, riding high on earlyseason dominance, are eager to reclaim their spot at the top.KKR, battered by inconsistency, are fighting to keep their playoff dreams alive. Marshalled by Axar Patel , DC began IPL-2025 like a juggernaut, with four straight victories. But three defeats in their last five outings have laid bare their middle-order frailties. KL Rahul ’s slow scoring in the last few games has been a topic of discussion. Despite his reputation as a prolific batsman have seen him adopt an ultra-cautious approach, leading to a lower strike-rate. Youngster Abishek Porel has batted with plenty of aggression at the top of the order, but hasn’t received support from the other end.Veteran Faf fu Plessis made a comeback in the last game after missing four games, but struggled to come to terms with the slow nature of the wicket. Karun Nair, too, hasn’t done anything of note after his quickfire 40-ball 89 against the Mumbai Indians two weeks ago.On the bowling front, Kuldeep Yadav has been the team’s trump card, particularly in the middle overs. He has received decent support from the other two spinners, Axar Patel and Vipraj Nigam. In the pace department, Mitchell Starc has mostly fought a lone battle.Likely XIIs: DC: Abishek Porel, Faf du Plessis, Karun Nair, KL Rahul (wk), Axar Patel (C), Tristan Stubbs, Ashutosh Sharma, Vipraj Nigam, Mitchell Starc, Kuldeep Yadav, Mukesh Kumar, Dushmantha Chameera.KKR: Quinton de Kock (wk), Sunil Narine, Ajinkya Rahane (c), Angkrish Raghuvanshi, Venkatesh Iyer , Rinku Singh, Andre Russell, Ramandeep Singh, Vaibhav Arora, Harshit Rana, Varun Chakaravarthy , Anrich Nortje/Spencer Johnson.","Delhi Capitals take on defending champions Kolkata Knight Riders on Tuesday.

We haven't played the perfect the match, but it's coming: Kevin Pietersen

New Delhi: Kevin Pietersen has always been a maverick, one who was perceived as going against the conventional ways of batting. Perhaps that streak led to him becoming the first player to play the switch-hit. Yet, he advocates buiding a strong foundation even as batters redefine stroke-making in T20 cricket .“I think a lot of these players are not going to play Test cricket,” Pietersen said when asked if unconventional shots in T20s are going to become the norm across formats. “I look at it and I just think, like, this is just crazy. Some of the shots that you see, and how quickly these guys play the shots.It looks like utter madness.” Pietersen explained what separates the best batters from the pure T20 hitters . “On wickets like we’re playing on this evening (Kotla pitch used for DC-RCB game on Sunday), you can’t play that way and you’ve got to be methodical, you’ve got to find rhythm like Virat and KL did today,” he said.“That’s where you see the true batter who can come out there and sort of monitor the situation. It looks effortless because they’ve built a technique for 20-30 years, whereas on absolute belters the next generation can come in and do all sorts of things.” T20 cricket is often perceived as a format which can be entertaining only through obscenely high scores.That’s what Pietersen believes should change. “Is it good for T20 cricket to have the occasional pitch like this (where shot-making becomes tougher)? I don’t think it’s a bad thing. Is it good to see the bowlers just bowling and just being served up into the stands every single ball like what happened a bit last year and how it started this year? “I don’t think every night people want to see (just) that. The question is if you want to see that every night, or just see a tight contest,” he said.",Kevin Pietersen believes unconventional shots in T20s are going to become the norm across formats.

Poll Which aspect of Suryavanshi's innings impressed you the most? His composure at a young age The number of sixes hit His strike rate

The way Vaibhav Suryavanshi batted, it was fantastic to watch: Sai Sudharsan

Jaipur: It was the sort of innings the IPL has been dreaming about for 17 years now. The cricketing world was left applauding in awe as a 14-yearold, batting against bowlers twice his age — some of them older — smashed the second fastest IPL century, a near-superhuman exhibition of phenomenal power hitting which blended the fearlessness of youth with the kind of raw ability that shapes legends.To top it all, he seemed to have all the luck as well. Vaibhav Suryavanshi , take a bow. At just 14 years and 32 days, Suryavanshi became the youngest centurion in men’s T20s. Rajasthan Royals may well have unearthed a gem for Indian cricket. On his IPL debut, he had tears in his eyes when he lost his wicket.On Monday, chasing a 210-run target against Gujarat Titans , Suryavanshi — who got to the three-figure mark off just 35 balls, ruining many a reputation along the way — had only a beaming smile when he reached the dugout after being dismissed for 101 (38 balls; 7x4, 11x6).Even the usually dour Rahul Dravid , head coach, couldn’t stop smiling as he stood up, clutches forgotten, to applaud what will go down as a marker for the future of T20 batting — Suryavanshi scored at a staggering strike rate of 265.78. His opening partnership of 166 runs in 11.5 overs with Yashasvi Jaiswal ensured the Royals, down on their luck this season, reached the target in just 15.5 overs to keep their slim hopes mathematically alive.Even Suryavanshi’s mishits seemed to sail over the ropes. Gujarat’s bowlers, reduced to spectators, rushed to congratulate the new phenomenon once Prasidh Krishna pushed one through his defences. “It was an incredible innings, one of the best I’ve seen,” Jaiswal would later say. “I just kept telling him to keep going.He has the game, the temperament and the mentality. He just played amazing shots.” Suryavanshi’s knock, and the stand with Jaiswal, put to shade the fine efforts of Gujarat’s top three batters earlier in the game. Gill, blending his classic approach with aggression, led from the front as he cruised to 84 off 50 balls with the help of five fours and four sixes.Buttler’s breezy, unbeaten 50 off 26 balls, in which he smacked three boundaries and four sixes, exposed the chinks in the Royals bowling attack. The Titans captain continued his prolific opening partnership with Sai Sudharsan (39 off 30 balls; 4x4, 1x6), and they would have come away hoping the total would have been enough. The incredible Suryavanshi had other ideas.","At just 14 years and 32 days, Suryavanshi became the youngest centurion in men’s T20s.

NEW DELHI: Vaibhav Suryavanshi smashed the fastest hundred by any Indian and became the youngest-ever centurion in IPL history as Rajasthan Royals defeated Gujarat Titans by eight wickets in their contest on Monday. The 14-year-old sensation from Samastipur hammered 101 off just 38 balls, including 11 sixes and seven fours, achieving the milestone at the age of 14 years and 32 days — the youngest ever to score a century in the tournament's history.Chasing a daunting target of 210 on a batting-friendly surface, Rajasthan Royals overhauled the total comfortably, reaching 212 for two in just 15.5 overs. Yashasvi Jaiswal provided solid support at the other end, scoring an unbeaten 70 off 40 balls to guide Rajasthan to victory.Suryavanshi, who dazzled with his fearless strokeplay, brought up his whirlwind century off just 35 balls, registering the second-fastest hundred in IPL history. He was eventually dismissed for 101 off 37 deliveries, also becoming the youngest player to score a century in men’s T20 cricket.The record for the fastest IPL century remains with former West Indies superstar Chris Gayle, who smashed a 30-ball ton for Royal Challengers Bengaluru against Pune Warriors in April 2013.With his heroics, Suryavanshi broke Yusuf Pathan ’s long-standing record for the fastest IPL century by an Indian. Pathan had scored a century in 37 balls for Rajasthan Royals against Mumbai Indians back in 2010.Following Suryavanshi’s remarkable feat, Pathan took to social media to congratulate the youngster.""Many congratulations to young #VaibhavSuryavanshi for breaking my record of the fastest @IPL hundred by an Indian! Even more special to see it happen while playing for @rajasthanroyals, just like I did. There’s truly something magical about this franchise for youngsters.

THE STRUGGLE

NEW DELHI: He came, he saw, he conquered — that’s exactly how 14-year-old Vaibhav Suryavanshi lit up the Sawai Mansingh Stadium, leaving fans in awe with his majestic strokeplay and whirlwind century. In return, the crowd roared in celebration, cheering loudly for the young sensation from Samastipur, Bihar.On Monday, Rajasthan Royals ' latest batting prodigy etched his name into IPL history by becoming the youngest-ever player to score a century in the tournament, achieving the feat at just 14 years and 32 days. Suryavanshi blazed his way to a blistering hundred off just 35 balls, hammering 11 sixes and seven fours — the second-fastest century in IPL history. He eventually departed after scoring a stunning 101 off 38 deliveries.His sensational knock came against IPL 2022 champions Gujarat Titans , who had posted a formidable target of 210. In reply, Rajasthan Royals cruised to victory, chasing down the total with ease, reaching 212 for two in just 15.5 overs.Suryavanshi’s innings not only marked the fastest IPL century by an Indian but also made him the youngest-ever to achieve a hundred in the league's history. Supporting him at the other end, Yashasvi Jaiswal anchored the chase with a composed unbeaten 70 off 40 balls.Earlier in the day, Gujarat Titans had ridden on captain Shubman Gill’s 84 and Jos Buttler’s unbeaten 50 to post 209 for four.The record for the fastest century in IPL history, however, still belongs to West Indies great Chris Gayle, who smashed a 30-ball ton for Royal Challengers Bengaluru against Pune Warriors in April 2013.At an age when most teenagers are busy indulging in their favourite meals, Suryavanshi has made notable sacrifices for his cricketing ambitions — giving up his two favourites, pizza and mutton. His discipline and focus are already reaping rich rewards.""Mutton nahi khana hai usko, instructions hain. Pizza hata diya hai uske diet chart mein se [Mutton is not allowed for him as per the instructions. Pizza has been removed from his diet chart]. He is just fond of chicken and mutton. He is a kid, so he used to love pizza a lot. But he doesn't eat it anymore. When we used to give him mutton, no matter how much we gave, he would finish all of it. That’s why he looks a bit chubby,"" coach Manish Ojha had told TimesofIndia.com in an exclusive interview.""He will go a long way. We’ve seen the way he started the innings, and I can promise you — he will score big in the coming matches.""""He’s a fearless batter. He has said time and again that he admires Brian Lara. But he’s a mix of Yuvraj Singh and Brian Lara. His aggression is just like Yuvraj’s,"" he added.Suryavanshi was born on March 27, 2011 — the same year India lifted the World Cup under MS Dhoni's leadership. Now, at just 14, he has already played five first-class matches for Bihar in the 2024-25 domestic season.His cricketing journey began early.He was only four years old when his father, Sanjeev Suryavanshi, a farmer, noticed him smashing a plastic ball around with great power and timing.After a long day in the fields, Sanjeev would throw underarm deliveries to his son and they would play together. Eventually, Sanjeev created a small practice area in their backyard, giving Vaibhav space to hone his skills.Impressed by his son's passion and commitment, Sanjeev took Vaibhav to Brajesh Jha, his first coach, at an academy in Samastipur. After training under Jha, they made another significant move — this time to Patna, where Manish Ojha helped further shape Vaibhav’s cricketing abilities.The 90 km journey from Samastipur to Patna was no easy task, but Sanjeev was determined. He bought a car and would drive his son to the academy. Vaibhav trained under Ojha on alternate days.By the time he was 14, Suryavanshi had already become a formidable force in various local tournaments across Bihar.Whether it was the Heman Trophy, Vinoo Mankad Trophy, the Challengers Trophy (U-19), or the ACC Under-19 Asia Cup, Vaibhav checked every box in style, steadily rising through the ranks to reach this significant level in his career.""He has been a dominant batter whenever he’s come to the crease. He was patient for his turn. He played in Rajasthan Royals' eighth game. Of course, no one wants to sit in the dugout and watch others play. He was also itching to get out in the middle, but I told him to be patient, keep learning, and wait for his chance. Now the chance came — and he has delivered,"" the coach said.","Vaibhav Suryavanshi is the youngest-ever player to score a century in the IPL.

Poll Do you think Liverpool can maintain their dominance in the league next season? It's too early to tell No, other teams will catch up Yes, they will continue to dominate

Liverpool secured their 20th English top-flight title with a stunning 5-1 victory over Tottenham Hotspur at an electrified Anfield on Sunday, sealing a record-equalling crown in emphatic style. The Reds, under manager Arne Slot, left no doubt as they turned an early deficit into a comprehensive win that saw them extend their lead to 15 points over second-placed Arsenal, making their title mathematically unassailable with just four games remaining.The match began with an air of anticipation, as Liverpool fans serenaded their team with the iconic ""You'll Never Walk Alone,"" and their team responded with attacking intent. However, Tottenham briefly threatened to spoil the party when Dominic Solanke powered home a header from a James Maddison corner in the 12th minute. The goal, which initially appeared to be offside, was awarded after VAR's intervention.The setback only seemed to galvanize Liverpool, who quickly leveled through Luis Diaz. The Colombian forward slotted home from close range following a fine cross from Dominik Szoboszlai. The home side then took the lead just minutes later, as Alexis Mac Allister rifled a thunderous shot past Spurs goalkeeper Guglielmo Vicario in the 24th minute.Liverpool were rampant, and after Tottenham's inability to clear their lines, Cody Gakpo seized the opportunity to make it 3-1, firing a low shot into the corner. Spurs, fielding a weakened side due to manager Ange Postecoglou's focus on the Europa League semi-finals, were now on the back foot.As the second half progressed, the Liverpool faithful were craving a goal from their star man, Mohamed Salah. Their wish was granted when Salah collected a pass from Szoboszlai, cut inside, and blasted the ball into the bottom corner, celebrating by taking a selfie with a fan in front of the Kop. The crowd erupted in joyous chants, and the atmosphere at Anfield reached fever pitch.The final goal came when Tottenham defender Destiny Udogie inadvertently turned the ball into his own net, sealing a 5-1 rout and sending the Liverpool fans into a frenzy. As the final whistle blew, Anfield reverberated with deafening cheers, and the celebrations began in full force.Liverpool's triumph marked their 20th league title, bringing them level with Manchester United at the top of the all-time list. It also represented a significant achievement for manager Arne Slot, who has steered the club to glory in his first season after replacing Jurgen Klopp last year.","Liverpool secured their 20th English top-flight title with a stunning 5-1 victory over Tottenham Hotspur at an electrified Anfield on Sunday.

In a controversial move, the All India Football Federation (AIFF) awarded the I-League trophy to Churchill Brothers on Sunday, just hours after the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) had stayed the decision and barred any formal felicitation. The defiant act could invite further scrutiny from global bodies like FIFA and CAS.Deputy secretary general M Satyanarayan handed the trophy to Churchill Brothers at a ceremony in Goa, claiming the AIFF only learned about the CAS order after the presentation. ""I was on a flight to Goa and the AIFF Secretariat was closed on Sunday. I came to know about the order only after giving away the trophy,"" Satyanarayan told PTI.The CAS stay came on an urgent application filed by Inter Kashi, who argued that a pending points dispute could alter the final standings. Inter Kashi president Prithiijit Das asserted, ""The CAS order came around 1:30 pm IST and the mail was marked to AIFF also,"" questioning the federation's explanation.CAS deputy president Elizabeth Steiner had clearly ruled that the AIFF must not declare a winner or hold any ceremony until the arbitration concludes. The respondents, including AIFF and Churchill Brothers, have until April 29 to respond.Defending its move, AIFF later issued a statement, emphasising that the presentation was based on previous Delhi High Court and Appeals Committee rulings and that the federation would comply with CAS' final verdict.Churchill Brothers had provisionally finished atop the I-League standings, but Inter Kashi's challenge over a disputed match result could yet overturn the title race.

Antonio Rudiger issued an apology as an Instagram Story.

Poll Which team do you think will win the next Clasico? It's too close to call Barcelona Real Madrid

Real Madrid came into the Copa del Rey final on the back of a horrid month. Defeats against Valencia and over both legs against Arsenal had thrown them out of Champions League and dented La Liga title hopes. Even in the Cup, they needed to claw from 1-3 down to beat Real Sociedad in the semi-final. On the field, it hasn't been smooth sailing by a long shot.Over the last two days, off-the-field antics took a massive hit as well. A club that prides itself on its class and gentlemanliness, showed neither in a haughty display which veered on petulance.At La Cartuja in Sevilla, Real Madrid were outplayed by a superior Barcelona side , losing 3-2 in extra time to lift the Cup for a record-extending 32nd time. It marked a third straight defeat for Real Madrid in Clasicos this season, scoring four and conceding 12. Two of those came in the finals - first in the Spanish Super Cup and now in the Copa. As far as warming up to the big job is concerned, Hansi Flick has done an incredible job. And the job is far from finished, Barcelona remain on course for a treble.Real Madrid, meanwhile, only have the league to play for. And that is hardly an easy passage. The Carlo Ancelotti-managed side are four points behind Barcelona with five matches to go. Winning the Clasico on May 11 is vital to the club's bid to avoid a trophy-less season. If it comes in a season where your arch-rivals win a treble, that is a recipe for disaster.Before all that, though, Real Madrid's conduct pre-and-post the Copa del Rey final has come under intense scrutiny. After the final whistle, Antonio Rudiger , Jude Bellingham and Lucas Vazquez were sent off for protesting amid ugly scenes.Both Bellingham and Rudiger were required to be restrained as they had a pop at the referee. The latter could even cop a lengthy ban for throwing an object at the referee from the sidelines. Questioning the referees had started at an institutional level . For months, Real Madrid TV attacked referees for their decisions and after taking umbrage with a decision in February, the club issued an official statement labelling officiating in the country as ""rigged"" and ""completely discredited"".Furthermore, the club has refused to make players available for pitch-side and mixed zone interactions during the league - a practice followed by every other club. Instead, Real Madrid players have kept their interactions limited to the club's official TV channel.Slamming of the referees and dissection of their decisions continued until it reached boiling point on Friday. In an emotional news conference before the Copa del Rey final, officials for the high-stakes encounter hit back.Referee Ricardo de Burgos Bengoetxea broke down in tears while explaining the impact Real Madrid's attacks have had on his family life and that of other referees.VAR referee Pablo Gonzalez Fuertes, seated alongside him, suggested officials will have to take ""much more serious measures"" while hinting at a possible strike.In response, Real Madrid didn't buckle down. Instead, they went into counter-attack. They pulled out of the scheduled open training session for the media, a press conference, president's traditional dinner and a photo-call.The game went ahead, with the same officials, despite suggestions in the Spanish media that Real Madrid were considering withdrawing. The focus, well and truly, was on the referees.For the most part, the referees did a good job of keeping the game flowing despite 34 fouls being committed by both teams and seven yellow cards being brandished out.Ironically, Barcelona were awarded a penalty in the sixth minute of stoppage time when Raphinha fell under pressure from Raul Asencio. As tension crept up, the cameras panned squarely on the officials, De Burgos Bengoetxea was called to assess the incident by the VAR official. Following a brief look, the decision was overturned.In a game that had 50-50 decisions galore, and players of both sides upset with the referee, Jules Kounde drilled in a low shot past Thibaut Courtois to seal the deal.As Real Madrid looked for yet another miracle, Kylian Mbappe was penalised for a foul, getting his hand in the face of a Barcelona player. That broke all the pent-up frustration for the Real Madrid players.Rudiger, already substituted by then, threw something at the referee and was sent off. It took several players and staff to contain him as a bag of ice burst in his hands - which may well have been his next projectile. After hours to cool down, the German defender has apologised for his behaviour.Bellingham, who had already vented to the officials in the tunnel before, was then sent off, too. As was Vazquez for coming onto the pitch to protest.Ancelotti admitted he had no idea about the last two red cards. A reflection of cluelessness that has plagued the Italian manager this season. The squad has struggled to find the right structure for the team. Since Toni Kroos, Nacho Fernandez and Joselu's departure in the summer, the club hasn't filled in the right replacements.Lamine Yamal's post-match message delivered the zinger. ""They can't handle us this year, we've proven it,"" said the teenager, wearing two pairs of sunglasses, the ice-cool antithesis to Madrid's red-hot rage.","Real Madrid lost 3-2 in extra time to Barcelona in the Copa del Rey final.

Madrid had issued furious statements about the refereeing team on Friday after they criticised the club's television channel for attacking Spanish officials this season, casting a shadow over the game.Controversy aside, the football was enthralling.Madrid started with top scorer Mbappe on the bench after an ankle injury and lost Ferland Mendy early on with a thigh issue.Barcelona dazzling winger Lamine Yamal, 17, dyed his hair blond for the game and led the assault on Thibaut Courtois' goal.The Catalans, who also won the first two Clasicos this season in La Liga and the Spanish Super Cup, scoring nine goals in the process, controlled the ball.They took the lead after 28 minutes, Pedri placing the ball into the top corner with precision and power from the edge of the box, a sensational goal set up by Yamal.Barcelona's opener brought Madrid out of their shell -- and also Mbappe off the bench to warm up.Bellingham netted but was offside. Vinicius Junior would have won a penalty when hacked down but had also strayed off in the build-up.Barcelona could have doubled their lead, with Dani Olmo's corner hitting the post and Cubarsi unable to turn home as Dani Ceballos held him back.The referee was lenient with some heated Madrid tackles, perhaps cowed by Friday's drama as the Spanish champions seethed at his pre-match comments.Madrid sent Mbappe on for Rodrygo Goes at half-time and soon he and Vinicius began to work Barcelona goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny.Mbappe pulled Madrid level almost on his own in the 70th minute, brought down after surging forward and firing home the free-kick off the post.Seven minutes later Madrid took the lead, Tchouameni heading in Arda Guler's corner.Barcelona responded when Yamal played a delicious pass over the top for Torres, which drew both Rudiger and Courtois, but the Spaniard beat both and rolled home.Controversy unsurprisingly reared its head before the match headed to extra-time.Barcelona clamoured for a penalty when Rudiger tripped Torres, and then were awarded one deep in stoppage time as Raphinha tumbled under pressure -- but the decision was overturned after a VAR review.In extra-time Barcelona were ascendent.They found their winner when Kounde intercepted an uncharacteristically loose Luka Modric pass and beat Courtois from range, sparking wild celebrations.The trio of dismissals and Madrid's pre-match histrionics regarding the officials will ensure the repercussions run on.The teams meet again in La Liga in May in a potential title decider.",Barcelona beat Real Madrid 3-2 in the Copa del Rey final in Seville.

What do Real Madrid want?

AS

Real Madrid 's bid to win the Copa del Rey for the 21st time, against arch-rivals Barcelona , took a massive twist on the eve of the clash at Sevilla's Estadio de La Cartuja.Instead of the Copa del Rey final focusing on Real Madrid's much-needed title bid after the embarrassing exit in the Champions League vs Arsenal, it has taken an unexpected turn towards off-field matters with La Liga chief Javier Tebas also getting involved.Ricardo de Burgos Bengoetxea , the referee appointed for the Copa del Rey final, addressed the media before the final. Referees holding a press conference is unconventional and raised quite a few eyebrows - not least at the Santiago Bernabeu and among the Real Madrid faithful.In the press conference, Bengoetxea became emotional while discussing the intense pressure he faces ahead of the match.He was questioned about a video released by Real Madrid's Club channel, Real Madrid TV, which highlighted his supposed mistakes in previous matches against them. This season RMTV have hit out at refereeing mistakes frequently and the club has refused to make its players available for mandatory media bytes with the official broadcaster for La Liga.When asked about the video, Bengoetxea could not hold back tears as he spoke about the impact on him and his family.""When your son comes back from school and other kids have said to him that his father is a thief, it's really hard,"" he said. ""They have no right to make us go through this, but it's not just something between professionals; a lot of families depend on this, and everyone should take some time to reflect on what they are doing.""Pablo Gonzalez Fuentes, who will serve as the VAR official for the Copa del Rey final, also criticised RMTV's actions. ""They have to understand the consequences of these videos,"" he said, explaining that they lead to online campaigns against officials.""We're seeing community managers on official social media platforms attacking the community for just one more like. We see actions by football players that suggest we're dishonest. When a journalist talks about 'theft,' fans take that frustration out on the child who's about to referee a youth team. We must address these types of situations and return to a healthier and cleaner style of football,"" he commented.""The consequences are that when you talk about theft and bad language, the frustration you generate in the fans is paid for by the little boy or girl who grabs a whistle and has to officiate a junior's game. It's the consequence of putting the target on a teammate's head,"" he added.After the press conference by the officials, Real Madrid, who had finished training in the Spanish capital and were to leave for Seville later, went into a huddle on a possible response.In retaliation, Real Madrid refused to hold their open training session at La Cartuja (scheduled for 8pm), a press conference with under-fire manager Carlo Ancelotti and a member of the squad. Additionally, Florentino Perez skipped the traditional presidents' dinner and the club missed the pre-match photo-call.In a statement on the club website, Real Madrid said the complaints by the referees were 'unacceptable'. ""These statements... made in a premeditated manner 24 hours before the final against one of the participants, demonstrate, once again, a clear and manifest animosity and hostility of these referees towards Real Madrid,"" said the Spanish league champions.Los Blancos took particular issue with the final's VAR referee Fuertes suggesting referees were ""united"" and looking to take collective action against the pressure they had received from Real Madrid TV.""Even more surprising statements, in a threatening tone... to announce supposed measures or actions that are far removed from the principles of fairness, objectivity and impartiality that should prevail just hours before (the final),"" continued Madrid's statement.""In view of the seriousness of what has happened, Real Madrid hopes that those in charge of the RFEF and the refereeing profession will act accordingly, adopting the relevant measures in defence of the prestige of the institutions they represent.""As per Spanish media, Real Madrid wanted the referees changed for the final and there were suggestions of the team pulling out of the competiiton and returning home.However at 10pm local time, Real Madrid rubbished those suggestions and claimed this option hadn't been considered.""In light of the rumours that have arisen in the last few hours, Real Madrid C.F. communicates that our team never considered refusing to play tomorrow's final.""Real Madrid understands that football's values must prevail, despite the hostility and animosity that has today once again been shown against our club, by the referees appointed for the final,"" said the statement.Madrid-based sports dailyreported later there was a conversation between Rafael Louzan, president of the Spanish FA , which oversees the Copa del Rey, and Real Madrid camp. It claims that RFEF acknowledged the inappropriateness of the comments made by the referees and made clear that Fuertes will not officiate Real Madrid matches for the rest of the season while leaving his role at the Technical Committee of Referees (CTA).","Real Madrid take on Barcelona in the Copa del Rey final on Saturday.

Police confirmed that Jackson Rodríguez 's family, who were abducted from their Guayaquil residence, have been safely rescued. The Ecuadorian footballer, aged 26, sought shelter beneath his bed whilst four armed assailants in hoods abducted his wife, 24, and son, 5, on Wednesday from their residence in Mucho Lote.Police commander Pablo Dávila confirmed that both mother and child were unharmed and received necessary medical care post-rescue. Despite the kidnappers' demand for USD 500,000, the family did not comply. Rodríguez currently plays as a left back for Emelec in the first division.The victims were discovered late Thursday in ""El Fortín"", a notoriously unsafe district in northwest Guayaquil where a March incident resulted in 22 fatalities.Guayaquil is situated 270 kilometres southwest of Quito.The incident occurred during a government-declared state of emergency spanning nine regions, including Guayas province where Guayaquil is located. This measure enables security forces to counter organised crime in these areas.Ecuador has experienced increased criminal activity over four years, with a surge in early 2023. Official records show 2,345 violent deaths between January and March, with 742 occurring in Guayaquil.The coastal city serves as a significant transit point for illegal drugs destined for Europe, Central America, and the United States, according to officials.Previously, other sportspersons have faced similar threats. In December, Liga de Quito player Pedro Perlaza was abducted in Esmeraldas, 182 kilometres northwest of Quito, before being rescued days later.","Jackson Rodríguez's family were abducted from their Guayaquil residence.

Poll Will Liverpool secure the Premier League title against Tottenham? No, they will not win Yes, they will win

Liverpool manager Arne Slot is preparing for a potential Premier League title celebration at Anfield on Sunday against Tottenham, needing just one point to secure the club's record-equalling 20th English championship. The achievement would come five years after their last title, which was celebrated in an empty stadium during the COVID-19 pandemic.Liverpool currently lead Arsenal by 12 points with five games remaining in their campaign, while Arsenal have only four matches left to play.""It's a big responsibility. We are aware that the last time this club won the league was during the Covid time. So everybody is looking forward to Sunday,"" Slot told reporters on Friday.""We know there's still a job to do. We need at least one point. Our fans know as well. When they come to the stadium they have to support us in the best possible way as they have done all season. It's a nice game to look forward to but also a responsibility we have for Sunday.""The title could have been decided earlier this week when Arsenal faced Crystal Palace. Liverpool's players and staff gathered to watch the match together, hoping to celebrate, but the game ended in a 2-2 draw.""It was different. Normally when you watch a game of football, you are either alone or with family or friends. But we watched it all together,"" Slot said. ""Before the game, I would have been surprised if the game ended in a draw. But during the game, I wasn't because Crystal Palace again showed what this league is all about.""The upcoming achievement would see Liverpool match Manchester United's record of 20 English titles. Slot, in his first season after replacing Jurgen Klopp, would become the first Dutch manager to win the Premier League.""No, I get these questions so it comes to your mind but it is the last thing you think of as a manager at this time. We saw last week how hard it was to get a win against a team that was nearly relegated at Leicester,"" Slot said. ""I am not getting carried away. We have faced Tottenham three times and I know how hard it is to beat them.""Liverpool's impressive season under Slot has seen them lose only twice in the league. The manager acknowledges the expectations that come with leading the club.""This club has to win trophies,"" Slot said. ""The good thing is most managers work here a long time so you have a few chances to win trophies. You are aware of that but that is not the first thing that you think about when you walk through this door.""Some have suggested Liverpool's success comes from Manchester City's decline and Arsenal's injury problems. Slot responded to these claims.""Everybody can have their own opinion. You might have a different opinion. That is the nice thing about the world we are living in. I am only here for a year so I can only tell you what I experienced,"" Slot said. ""It has never been as hard to end up in the top four or five. In my opinion it is a really difficult league.""If Liverpool fail to secure the title against Tottenham, their next opportunity would come at Chelsea in their following league fixture.","Liverpool manager Arne Slot preparing for potential Premier League title celebration.

Leicester City captain Jamie Vardy will part ways with the club at the end of the season, bringing the curtain down on a legendary spell that spanned over a decade.

Mahindra Racing is driving at an altogether different speed this season as the Formula E team has already surpassed their Season 10 points total in just five races. There are 11 more rounds to go, with the next in Monaco in May. And with such a wonderful performance this year, the Indian outfit is surely on the way to making history. Mahindra Racing drivers Edoardo Mortara and Nyck De Vries can rightfully take the credit for making the team reach a prominent place in the competition.Mahindra Racing’s achievement was highlighted by Formula E, which shared a post on Instagram to laud the team. The picture of team drivers Edoardo Mortara and Nyck De Vries was captioned: “What a turnaround from @MahindraRacing surpassing their Season 10 points total in the first 5 rounds,” along with clapping emojis.The team was struggling at just 47 points last season, but it has already made 51 points in 5 rounds out of 16 races.

De Vries slipped to 8th position in the second race in Mexico, whereas Mortara failed to leave an impression. The two bounced back strongly at Jeddah E-Prix Round 1, where De Vries climbed to an impressive 4th position and Mortara finished 7th. But they once again slipped to 10th and 13th positions in Round 2.At the Miami E-Prix this month, Mortara once again bounced back by clenching 5th position, but De Vries finished 11th in the race.

He wrote: “Difficult weekend in Imola with P10 in race. Still early process with our new team, we keep learning. As always after a difficult one, we gonna analyse and make progress to come back stronger for the next one in Spa @cadillacvseries @jota_sport.”Encouraging him, Cadillac’s official Instagram page commented: “Building and growing,” along with clapping emojis.

Rowland had a tough outing in Miami, finishing 10th and earning just one point. But his overall journey this season has been inspiring—starting the Sao Paulo E-Prix in December with zero points, he bounced back impressively. He clinched victory in the Mexico E-Prix (25 points), finished second in Jeddah Part 1 (18 points), and won Jeddah Part 2 (25 points). Thanks to this strong mid-season performance, his lacklustre Miami result hasn’t dented his lead.In second place is Tag Heuer Porsche’s Antonio Felix da Costa with 54 points. He finished runner-up in both the Sao Paulo and Mexico E-Prix races. While his performance dipped in the Jeddah double-header, he recovered well by finishing third in Miami and collecting 15 crucial points.Close behind is his teammate, Pascal Wehrlein, with 51 points. Wehrlein had a disappointing start in Sao Paulo but bounced back with a third-place finish in Mexico. Although his results in Jeddah were average, his win in Miami has significantly boosted his title hopes. A strong showing in Monaco could push him past Da Costa into second place.Also tied at 51 points is the youngest driver on the grid, Taylor Barnard. He impressed with a third-place finish in Sao Paulo and podiums in both Jeddah races—third in Part 1 and second in Part 2.

Formula E drivers Norman Nato and Nyck De Vries are currently in Italy for the second round of the 2025 FIA World Endurance Championship (WEC).

Nato finished 9th, while De Vries secured 5th place in the session.Norman Nato, who races for Nissan in the Formula E Championship, represents Cadillac Racing in collaboration with Hertz Team Jota in the Hypercar category of the Endurance Championship. Nyck De Vries, from Mahindra Racing’s Formula E team, finished 5th in the Imola qualifying. He competes for Toyota Gazoo Racing in the WEC, alongside teammate Ryo Hirakawa, who placed 4th in qualifying.Calling it his best effort on track, De Vries told Toyota Europe Newsroom: “As a team, I think we can be fairly satisfied with qualifying fourth and fifth here. We maximised our package, as you can see from the tiny gap between the two cars. I don’t think we could have done much better than that; we did a strong job to execute a clean qualifying. The gap to the front cars looks quite big over one lap, but we will do our best with race pace, tyre management, and strategy to challenge for the podium.”Both drivers are now set to compete in the final race of the 6 Hours of Imola on Sunday, scheduled from 1 PM to 7 PM local time.In their last Formula E outing at the Homestead-Miami Speedway, Nato faced heartbreak after losing what looked like a sure win due to post-race penalties. Although he clinched pole and crossed the line first at the Miami E-Prix, he was relegated to 6th place in the revised results.De Vries had qualified 5th in Miami but ultimately dropped to 11th in the final standings after penalties were applied.Following this, they’ll shift focus to Round 6 of the Formula E World Championship—the highly anticipated Monaco double-header on May 3 and 4.

His last podium came in Season 9, when he was part of Mahindra Racing.The 40-year-old shared his journey to the podium after the win. He said, “It’s very hard to start the project from zero so in the four races, I had four critical problems that pretty much didn’t allow me to finish the race. So I was like, it’s extremely (tough), you need to have a lot of discipline to be able to continue the work and continue to push when you have bad results.”“When you have good results, it’s very easy. But when you have bad results, to go back home, keep the focus, keep the head down and keep doing the work that you do that at one point it’s going to pay off. It’s hard because you work, it doesn’t. Then you work again, it doesn’t pay off again. And then you keep working until it pays off. And today was a day it paid off. So I am very happy.”It was also emotional to see Di Grassi’s wife, Bianca Diniz Caloi, and their young children standing alongside him on the podium as they popped the champagne.

Andretti driver Nico Mueller and his race engineer Bertrand Mermine have surged to the top of the ABB Engineered to Outrun leaderboard following a dramatic Miami Grand Prix, where post-race penalties reshuffled the final standings in Mueller’s favour. Though he originally crossed the line in 10th, Mueller was promoted to 4th, thanks to a well-timed strategy and a dash of late-race chaos. His calculated decision to split Attack Mode usage proved decisive, paying off when several drivers were hit with time penalties after the chequered flag.The Engineered to Outrun leaderboard celebrates the most dynamic driver-engineer duos in Formula E—tracking those who gain the most positions during a race, with emphasis on overtaking prowess, energy management, and overall race pace. The season concludes with an award for the top-ranked pairing.After Round 5 in Miami, the leaderboard has Maserati MSG Racing’s Stoffel Vandoorne and his race engineer Thibault Arnal on number 2. Mahindra Racing’s Nyck De Vries and race engineer Tom Bayles are in third position in the ABB Engineered to Outrun leaderboard.The FIA Formula E Instagram account also shared the update, posting:“@nico.mueller51 overtaking his way up the rankings! With a mega drive from P18 to P4, the @andrettife driver tops the @abbgroup Engineered to Outrun leaderboard after Round 5. #MiamiEPrix #FormulaE #Motorsport #Racing.”Nico Mueller’s rise was the result of strategy combined with fortunate timing. While many drivers delayed activating Attack Mode until later in the race, Mueller opted for a more aggressive strategy—using two four-minute activations, starting with the first on Lap 11 to position himself within points range.By Lap 20, Mueller was running in 10th when a red flag was brought out following a three-car collision. After the restart, as the majority of the grid scrambled to use their remaining Attack Mode activations, Mueller’s earlier strategy gave him an edge.Despite finishing 10th on the road, he was ultimately classified 4th after multiple post-race penalties were issued. Drivers including Norman Nato, Robin Frijns, Oliver Rowland, Sam Bird, and Taylor Barnard were penalized 10 seconds each for misuse of Attack Mode, while Nick Cassidy received a five-second penalty for exceeding track limits.Also Read: Formula E Miami E-Prix 2025: Jake Hughes crashes at chicane, here’s how the multi-car collision changed the outcome.

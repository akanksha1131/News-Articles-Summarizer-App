NEW DELHI: Ace drag-flicker Harmanpreet Singh , who captained the Indian men's hockey team to a bronze medal-finish at the Paris Olympics 2024, has been recommended for the country's highest sporting honour, the Major Dhyan Chand Khel Ratna award.Harmanpreet joins para athlete Praveen Kumar , who won gold in the men's high jump T64 class with an Asian record at the Paris Paralympics for the nomination, recommended by a 12-member selection committee, headed by retired Supreme Court judge, Justice V Ramasubramanian.Strangely, ace pistol shooter, the Paris Olympics double medallist, Manu Bhaker 's name is missing from the recommendation for India's highest sporting award. While officials in the sports ministry claimed that the shooter didn't apply for the award, sources close to Manu's family said that she had indeed sent in her application.Even if she hadn't applied for the award, the selection committee doesn't seem to have taken suo moto cognizance of her stupendous achievements as a shooter over the years.Last year, cricketer Mohammed Shami too hadn't applied for the Arjuna but was eventually given the award on the Indian cricket board's (BCCI) insistence, after which the National Sports Day awards committee took suo moto cognizance.Manu was honoured with the Arjuna in 2020. At the Paris Games this year, she created history after securing two back-to-back medals (bronze) -- the women's 10m air pistol and in the mixed team event with Sarabjot.However, soon after Paris, Manu faced flak on social media for allegedly asking for the Khel Ratna from the government. She had posted on X: ‘Tell me, Do I deserve the Major Dhyan Chand Khel Ratna award . Thanks'.Hockey captain Harmanpreet was rewarded for his show as one of the world's best penalty corner specialists in addition to his fine defending skills and overall leadership guided India to a creditable bronze finish in Paris and an Asian Games gold in Hangzhou last year.He was also part of the team's successful campaign in Birmingham CWG 2022 (silver), Tokyo Olympics 2020 (bronze) and Jakarta Asiad 2018 (bronze). The 28-year-old from Amritsar has won the ‘FIH Player of the Year' award thrice in his career, a record by itself.Similarly, Praveen's rise as the country's leading para high jumper cannot be ignored. In Paris, he cleared 2.08m in the final to clinch gold and his second successive Paralympics medal. The 21-year-old from Jewar in Greater Noida, had won silver in Tokyo 2020 with a clearance of 2.07m, an Asian record.The awards committee also recommended the names of a total 30 sportspersons for the Arjuna. These include 13 from able-bodied sports and 17 para-athletes. Men's 57kg freestyle wrestler Aman Sehrawat is one of the prominent names to be nominated for his bronze winning-campaign at Paris and Hangzhou Asiad.Shooters Swapnil Kusale, who won bronze in Paris in the men's 50m rifle three positions event, and Sarabjot, who secured bronze in the 10m air pistol mixed team event partnering Manu in Paris, have been recommended for the Arjuna. Sarabjot also won gold in the 10m air pistol team event in Hangzhou.The members of the men's hockey team, who weren't awarded with Arjuna on any of the previous occasions, too, have been recommended for the sporting honour. These include Jarmanpreet Singh, Sanjay Rana, Rajkumar Pal, Abhishek Nain and Sukhjeet Singh.India's first Paralympic gold medallist, para swimmer Muralikant Petkar, has been recommended for Arjuna in the lifetime achievement category. He won individual gold in the 1972 Heidelberg Paralympics in West Germany.The 17 para-sport recommendations, who won medals in Paris and have been nominated for Arjuna, include Navdeep Singh (para athletics), Dharambir (para athletics), Ajeet Singh (para athletics), Sachin Khilari (para athletics), Pranav Soorma (para athletics), Preeti Pal (para athletics), Simran (para athletics), Hokato Hotozhe Sema (para athletics), Deepthi Jeevanji (para athletics), Nitesh Kumar (para badminton), Manisha Ramdas (para badminton), Thulasimathi Murugesan (para badminton), Nithya Sivan (para badminton), Mona Aggarwal (para shooting), Rubina Francis (para shooting), Kapil Parmar (para judo) and Rakesh Kumar (para archery).Para shooting coach Subhash Rana has been recommended for the Dronacharya. Under his mentorship, India's para shooters landed four medals from the Paris Paralympics, including one gold and one silver and two bronze. Avani Lekhara secured gold in the women's 10m air rifle event, Manish Narwal won silver in the men's 10m air pistol and Rubina Francis and Mona Agarwal won bronze each in the women's 10m air rifle discipline.However, a few eyebrows have been raised on the nomination of four-time Paralympian and Arjuna awardee, wheelchair-bound para athlete Amit Kumar Saroha, for the Dronacharya award . According to sources, Saroha is an active para athlete who just participated in Paris and has been a Target Olympic Podium Scheme (TOPS) beneficiary for the last eight years.""He is an active athlete and TOPS beneficiary who has never worked as a coach with the para athletics team. Even the athletes whose affidavits have been submitted by Saroha don't even train together in the same ground,"" alleged a source.","Harmanpreet Singh, Praveen Kumar, Aman Sehrawat, Swapnil Kusale, Sarabjot, among 30 nominated for Arjuna award.

MELBOURNE: Before walking into the nets on the first day of Team India 's practice session at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG), Virat Kohli patiently applied tape on the bottom of his bat. The star batter ensured to have protection on his willow and few deliveries of his session were enough to understand why he did that.Unlike the surfaces which we generally see during Tests Down Under, the practice pitches at the MCG had lower bounce and absolutely nothing in it for the quicks. Except the deliveries where the bowlers used the shoulder, not many rose above waist height and were comfortably dealt with off the front-foot.It was clearly evident on the opening day and the trend continued on Sunday too. India's quicks Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammed Siraj and Akash Deep were operating with the new ball for most of the session but there was very little help for the trio. Bumrah did slip in a few gems but they were mostly because of his use of angles and the subtle wrist work.It was hard work for the bowlers under the harsh sun, which kept playing hide-and-seek with the clouds, and the nature of the surface was definitely not to the Indian camp's liking.Akash Deep did speak about it during his interaction with the media and felt it was on the flatter side, had variable bounce and was more suited for white-ball cricket. The variable bounce was on display as whenever side-armers put in the extra effort, some deliveries rose awkwardly from the good length spot and some kept a tad low.So it wasn't a surprise when the likes of KL Rahul, Yashasvi Jaiswal and Akash Deep took some blows to the body, and captain Rohit Sharma was in a lot of pain after one delivery hit the flap of his left pad and made a serious impact on his left knee.Rohit had the ice pack on for close to 30 minutes but looked comfortable as he made his way back to the change room. Even when he was batting, he kept checking the toe of his bat after not hearing the ideal sound from the connection. The captain batted but finally decided to change the willow towards the fag end of his lengthy hit in the nets.Australia are yet to get their training underway and will have their first session, an optional one, in the afternoon on Monday. The hosts, however, are highly unlikely to train on the same set of pitches as those were heavily watered after India's session got over this afternoon.There are more pitches in the training square which were covered throughout India's sessions and when the covers did come off briefly today, they looked spicier than the ones which were given to the visitors.The reveal of the other pitches will happen tomorrow (Monday) when Australia arrive at the MCG and it remains to be seen how the Indian camp reacts if they turn out to be as spicy as they looked.","Rohit Sharma hit on knee during nets session at MCG on Sunday.

R Ashwin announces retirement from Test cricket

Why R Ashwin retirement was a last minute surprise for Ravindra Jadeja

Stadium Walkthrough series: Inside The Gabba

NEW DELHI: Ravichandran Ashwin announced his retirement from international cricket earlier this week, bringing an end to his illustrious career following the Gabba Test against Australia. The 38-year-old spinner retires as India’s second-highest wicket-taker across all formats, trailing only the legendary Anil Kumble.Ashwin’s impact on Test cricket has been monumental. He claimed 11 Player of the Series awards, the most by any cricketer in men’s Test history, cementing his status as one of India’s greatest match-winners.Over the years, comparisons between Ashwin and fellow Indian spin legend Harbhajan Singh were frequent. Speculation about a rift between the two spinners has often surfaced, suggesting strained relations.However, Harbhajan recently dispelled such rumors following Ashwin’s retirement, asserting that there is no truth to the claims of discord between them.""I read social media only as much as I need to. If there is a standoff between me and Ashwin or if there was ever any fight, quarrel or disagreement, I would be the first person to go up to him and ask what the issue is,"" Harbhajan Singh said on his YouTube channel.""But it was never like this, and it will never be like this because whatever is in his destiny, he will get it, and I got whatever was in my destiny. He has been a phenomenal bowler for India. I am very happy for his achievement,"" he added.""If people twist things on Twitter and make it seem as if I have a problem with Ashwin, then it's their point of view. I am a little vocal about the fact that the pitches on which India play cricket are not good tracks, there is a lot of spin on these tracks and matches get over within two and a half days,"" said Harbhajan.""Because I am vocal about it, there is a lot of noise on social media, and people think I have a problem with one individual. I don't have a problem with any individual, I respect everyone because it is not easy to play for the country. They are all my colleagues. They are all my brothers, some elder, some younger,"" said Harbhajan.Ashwin picked 765 wickets in international cricket in 379 innings, while Harbhajan scalped 707 wickets in his illustrous career.","Ravichandran Ashwin retires as India's second-highest wicket-taker across all formats.

Rohit Sharma hit on knee during nets session at MCG

Akash Deep on his battle with Steve Smith, plans for Travis Head

MELBOURNE: Rohit Sharma had an injury scare in the India nets on Sunday, copping a painful hit on his left knee while facing throwdowns at the MCG nets. The captain was into his trademark pull shot when he missed, the ball sneaking through the flap of the pad and hitting him painfully on the knee.He kept batting for a while but then needed attention from the physio and chose to leave the nets, rest his leg on a chair and apply an ice pack for a good half hour.He subsequently got up and was seen walking around and mingling with teammates, pointing to his knee and smiling.Minutes later, pacer Akash Deep , who was himself hit on the hand while batting, brushed aside any major concerns for the team. “No concern, itni chotey to lagti rahti hai (it’s common to sometimes get hurt). The practice area was prepared for white-ball purposes, it seems. The ball was keeping a bit low.”Minor controversies have dogged India since arriving in Melbourne, with Virat Kohli first having a run-in with an Australian reporter and a cameraman at the airport over filming his children and then Ravindra Jadeja being criticized for not answering questions in English. Rohit is under pressure to come good in his new middleorder slot while Akash Deep, after his satisfying performance in Brisbane, is expected to play a crucial role in the Boxing Day Test.Wasn’t looking to avoid follow on, says Deep Akash Deep also clarified he and Jasprit Bumrah , the last-wicket pair which heroically avoided the follow-on in the previous Test in Brisbane, were simply looking to play out balls and survive.“Whenever we bat, scoring those 20-30 runs is vital. I didn’t think about saving the follow-on, I was just looking at not getting out. I’m happy that I was able to give the team some confidence from that situation. We’ll carry that momentum into the MCG Test,” he said.",Rohit Sharma hit on knee during nets session at MCG. Akash Deep brushed aside any major concerns for the team.

Stadium Walkthrough series: Inside The Gabba

VADODARA: Fired by some brilliant swing bowling under the lights by seamer Renuka Thakur (five for 25 in ten overs) and another fabulous knock by their vice-captain Smriti Mandhana (91 runs off 102 balls), India secured a massive 211-run win in the opening Women’s ODI against a highly disappointing West Indies on Sunday at the brand new Kotambi Stadium-staging its first-ever international match.India, who had earlier clinched the WT20I series against the Caribbeans 2-1, will now look to clinch the WODI series too in the second WODI of the three-match series at the same venue on Tuesday.Carrying her sizzling form in her kit bag from Perth to Navi Mumbai to international cricket’s newest venue-the Kotambi Stadium here, Mandhana led the charge while several other batters made useful contributions as the hosts, despite losing a cluster of wickets in the final overs, put up 314 for nine against West Indies in the first Women’s ODI on Sunday.Making the new ball talk at night, Renuka destroyed the West Indies top-order, prising out the wickets of captain Hayley Matthews (0), veteran allrounder Deandra Dottin (8), Aaliyah Allene (13) and Shabika Gajnabi (3). Badgered by Renuka’s early strikes, the visitors were left tottering at 34 for six in 13 overs.While the dangerous Matthews swished at a wide one and feathered it, Dottin was castled while trying a wild slog across the line. Alleyne fell to a stunner by Indian women’s team skipper Harmanpreet Kaur, who, returning to action after missing the last two T20Is due to a knee injury, leapt in the air and caught the ball out of nowhere at mid-on. Renuka had her fourth scalp when, given an extended opening spell, she castled Gajnabi with a trademark inswinger.Supporting Renuka well, Sadhu (1/24 in seven overs) cleaned up the stumps of Rashada Williams (3) with a beauty of an inswinger that rushed through the gap between the ball and the bat.The Caribbeans were off the worst-possible start when opener Qiana Joseph was run out off the first ball of the innings as she failed to sprint home in time after Matthews dabbed the ball for a single to covers, where an alert Jemima Rodrigues quickly threw the ball to ‘keeper Richa Ghosh.At the moment, Smriti Mandhana is to the Indian women’s team what the legendary Sachin Tendulkar was to the Indian men’s team in the 90s, and Virat Kohli was from 2012 to 2019-the Atlas who carries the entire bunch on his/her shoulders. The talisman of the team.Looking to round off a dream 2024, in which the classy opener has stroked four WODI centuries and three consecutive fifties in the three-match WT20 series at the DY Patil Stadium against West Indies, Mandhana narrowly missed out on scoring back-to-back hundreds in the 50-over format, but once again led her team’s batting charge to an impressive total.Suffering badly yet again on this tour due to another shoddy effort in the fielding, the visitors were only provided some cheer by 20-year-old left-arm spinner Zaida James, who took five for 45 in eight overs-her maiden fiver in WODIs, and West Indies’ best bowling figures against India in this format.After they lost the toss and were asked to take first strike, India were provided a perfect start by the classy left-hander and debutant Pratika Rawal (40 runs off 69 balls), who managed to impress in her first international outing, as the duo added 110 in 140 balls for the opening wicket. It was a subdued start initially as the pair played out 53 dots in the first 13 overs, with Rawal -lucky to survive a caught behind decision down the legside that West Indies missed out on reviewing and then a dropped chance at mid-off- particularly struggling to get the ball off the square.However, India increased the pace of the innings later, as Harleen Deol (44 runs off 50 balls) and a fit-again skipper Harmanpreet Kaur (34 runs off 23 balls), who missed the last two T20Is due to a knee injury, added 66 in just 52 balls for the third wicket.Thereafter, Jemimah Rodrigues (31 runs off 19 balls) and aggressive ‘keeper-bat Richa Ghosh (26 runs off 13 balls) kept up the momentum.India lost seven wickets in the last 10 overs, but plundered 89 runs as Harleen, Harman, Rodrigues and Ghosh all unleashed a few lusty blows.",India beat West Indies by 211 runs in the first Women's ODI at the Kotambi Stadium in Navi Mumbai. Vice-captain Smriti Mandhana top scored with 91 runs off 102 balls. India had earlier clinched the WT20I series against the Caribbeans 2-1.

NEW DELHI: Days after being dropped from Australia's Test squad for the remainder of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy , Nathan McSweeney roared back to form, firing a sizzling 78 in Brisbane Heat's thrilling last-ball win over Adelaide Strikers in the Big Bash League on Sunday.The 25-year-old struck an unbeaten 49-ball 78 as Heat chased down the 175-run target on the final ball of the game in Brisbane.After the game, Player of the Match McSweeney reflected on his time with the Australian Test team and shared advice he received.“It's always nice to bounce back. I loved my time on the Australian Cricket team. You know sharing the changing room with some of Australia's best players was awesome. And yeah hopefully I can continue to get better and learn from my experiences and get back there,"" he said after the match.“Marnus (Labuschagne) in particular, just said it's not where it starts, it's where it ends. I think a good story always has its ups and downs and hopefully mine can. When I finish and I'm all done, I can look back on this and it was a great learning curve,"" McSweeney said.McSweeney's removal from the Test side followed a series of low scores in the BGT against India.

Australian fast bowler Jhye Richardson is enthusiastic about his return to the Test team. He will be playing in the final two matches of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy against India.Richardson's inclusion in the squad comes after Josh Hazlewood 's calf injury ruled him out of the series. Australia needed an additional pace option.While Richardson admitted to being surprised by his selection for the Boxing Day Test , he expressed excitement about his international comeback.“Even a week ago, I was like, 'I'm not really thinking about that just yet',” Richardson said on Fox Cricket during the Scorchers' clash with the Hurricanes on Saturday.To prepare for his potential Test return, Richardson will miss the Perth Scorchers ' match against the Melbourne Renegades. He played for the Scorchers on Saturday in Hobart.He and young opener Sam Konstas are the new additions to Australia’s 15-player squad for the rest of the series.“I just wanted to stay on the park and play Big Bash cricket and make sure that the body was OK and keep ramping up (the workloads) and following the processes that we've got in place. But here we are, and if there's an opportunity, then it's obviously really exciting.”In the Scorchers' recent loss to the Hobart Hurricanes, Richardson didn't take any wickets. This contrasted with his Player of the Match performance in the BBL season opener, where he took 3-19 against the Melbourne Stars.Richardson's surprise at his selection was due to his gradual return to long-form cricket this season. Despite limited opportunities, he has consistently shown his talent as one of Australia's best bowlers when fit.Just a week prior, Richardson had stated that an international return was ""unrealistic."" His focus was on regaining consistent match fitness.He has played only one four-day game this season. However, he made an immediate impact by taking two wickets in his first over during Western Australia's pink-ball Shield match against South Australia last month.Richardson’s confidence grew after successfully returning to bowling after dislocating his shoulder while celebrating one of those wickets.While he has played two T20 matches for the Scorchers since his first-class appearance, Richardson believes the transition to Test cricket won't be difficult. His summer training has been geared towards the longer format.“I'd probably argue that I've had less white-ball practice leading into this Big Bash. Having played a couple of second XI games and a Shield game, we've really been prioritising trying to build (my bowling) loads to get my body right for four-day cricket,” Richardson said.“So I'll probably find it easier to go back to red-ball cricket just from a preparation point of view.”Richardson's return has been carefully managed due to a history of injuries. These include a side strain during last season's Big Bash and hamstring surgery nine months earlier.This summer, he has played four One-Day Cup matches for Western Australia, two second XI games, and one Shield match. He sat out their most recent Shield game, which WA lost to NSW.",Australian fast bowler Jhye Richardson is enthusiastic about his return to the Test team.

Former Indian cricketer Parthiv Patel recently commented on the Indian batting unit's collapses in recent matches, particularly during the ongoing Border-Gavaskar Trophy series against Australia, where India has struggled to post substantial scores.""There is no doubt that collapses have occurred, especially in home series. We have seen collapses on rank turner pitches against New Zealand. When we toured Australia, the collapses continued there,"" Patel remarked to Cricbuzz.Patel observed similar collapses during India's home series, particularly on challenging turning pitches against New Zealand. He noted that these collapses also persisted during India's tour of Australia.""I do not believe this has happened due to extreme aggression. If we respect the traditional style of Test cricket and bat with discipline, these are the same batters who have previously performed well. Indian batters need to apply themselves more because they have the ability. If they bat with discipline, they can succeed anywhere,"" he added.Patel attributed the issue not to excessive aggression but rather to a lack of discipline. He believes that the same batsmen, who have demonstrated strong performances in the past, need to adhere to traditional Test match batting principles. He emphasised the importance of application and discipline for success, regardless of the playing conditions.Ahead of the Boxing Day Test against Australia, several Indian players engaged in rigorous practice sessions. Batsmen Yashasvi Jaiswal , Shubman Gill, Virat Kohli Rohit Sharma , and Rishabh Pant spent considerable time in the nets. Meanwhile, bowlers Jasprit Bumrah , Mohammed Siraj, and other pacers practised with high intensity.The Indian team took a rest day on Monday, 24 December, to prepare for the fourth Test scheduled to begin in Melbourne on 26 December.The Border-Gavaskar Trophy, a five-match series, is currently tied at 1-1.India secured a commanding 295-run victory in the first Test in Perth.

Fans protest with banners

KOCHI: The usual fanfare surrounding a home fixture of the Kerala Blasters at the Jawaharlal Nehru International Stadium was missing as they took on Mohammedan SC here on Sunday night. There was an unprecedented silence at the stadium when the Blasters players took the field for the match, as the home fans held the Blasters’ management responsible for their poor run in ISL this season.However, by the end of 90 minutes, Blasters not only rediscovered their winning touch by blanking MSC 3-0 but also managed to turn that silence into cheer from a small turnout of 15,000 who came in for a holiday fixture.With this win, Blasters are now in tenth spot in the points table with 14 points from 13 matches, while MSC remain at the bottom of the heap with five points from 12 matches.Though the first half of the game was more about missed passes from both teams, the dynamics changed after MSC goalkeeper Bhaskar Roy’s goalkeeping blunder helped Blasters open their account in the 62nd minute,. MSC defender Joe Zoherliana conceded a corner, which was taken by Adrian Luna. Goalkeeper Bhaskar Roy tried to punch the ball away but his mistiming saw the ball falling into his own net, giving the hosts a 1-0 lead.After conceding the lead, MSC were forced to attack, but they were guilty of opening up space in their defence, which Blasters striker Noah Sadaoui exploited. In the 80th minute, MSC failed to clear the line as Korou Singh, after receiving a pass from Luna, found Sadaoui with a long cross from the right. With a brilliant header, Sadaoui doubled the lead for Blasters.In the 90th minute, Alexandre Coeff, who came on as a substitute replacing Sadaoui in the 86th minute, scored Blasters' third goal. Coeff received a pass from Luna and beat Bhaskar Roy to complete the tally for the hosts.On Sunday, Manjappada, the official fan group of Kerala Blasters, stayed away from their usual stadium activities, including chanting and singing the anthem.

Bournemouth dismantle Manchester United to reach fifth with a 3-0 win,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/epl/top-stories/bournemouth-dismantle-manchester-united-to-reach-fifth-with-a-3-0-win/articleshow/116571666.cms,"FC Bournemouth (Reuters Photo)

Bournemouth secured a resounding 3-0 victory against Manchester United at Old Trafford on a chilly Sunday, boosting their Premier League standing to fifth place. Goals from Dean Huijsen, Justin Kluivert, and Antoine Semenyo propelled the Cherries to victory.This win marks Bournemouth's fourth league victory in five matches, elevating their points tally to 28 after 17 games. Meanwhile, Manchester United sits in 13th place with 22 points, marking the first time in Premier League history they will spend Christmas in the bottom half of the table.In the 29th minute, Huijsen opened the scoring for Bournemouth, outjumping Joshua Zirkzee to head in Ryan Christie's free-kick. This highlighted Manchester United's ongoing struggles with set pieces, having conceded similar goals from corners against Arsenal and Nottingham Forest earlier this month.Despite Manchester United's barrage of shots towards the end of the first half, including three attempts by captain Bruno Fernandes, Bournemouth extended their lead with two quick goals early in the second half.In the 61st minute, Kluivert successfully converted a penalty, awarded after Noussair Mazraoui 's foul on the Dutch winger. Kluivert sent goalkeeper Andre Onana the wrong way, solidifying Bournemouth's advantage.Mere moments later, while Bournemouth fans were still celebrating, Dango Ouattara delivered a precise pass to Semenyo inside the box. Semenyo's powerful shot past Onana, met with minimal resistance from United defender Lisandro Martinez, sealed the 3-0 victory for Bournemouth.“It's an important win for us,” Bournemouth manager Andoni Iraola remarked.“We won 3-0 but it was more difficult than it looks when you see 3-0. I think we've been quite solid, it was a mature performance.”Bournemouth supporters, echoing their team's identical victory at Old Trafford last season, chanted ""Man United, it's happened again"" during the final minutes of the match.Manchester United appeared disjointed throughout the game, which followed their uplifting 2-1 derby win against Manchester City the previous week. Their performance lacked cohesion both offensively and defensively.“It's hard to push for two, three wins and we are trying,” United boss Ruben Amorim stated.“This game was hard on us. We suffered again on set-pieces and we were a bit nervous, I felt it in the stadium. The penalty and another goal are really hard here. We tried to score some goals but it was a tough match so let's move on.”“We have to focus on the job and not what you feel in the stadium. It's the only way I know how to focus my players. We have to suffer again but we will try to win. We will do it until the end.”Manchester United outshot Bournemouth 23 to 10, including a flurry of attempts just before halftime. Among these attempts, Fernandes unleashed a powerful shot from the edge of the box that narrowly missed the target. Moments later, Kobbie Mainoo skillfully bypassed three defenders before his shot also went wide.In the second half, Alejandro Garnacho missed a golden opportunity, outpacing two defenders but ultimately shooting directly at goalkeeper Kepa.Manager Ruben Amorim excluded forward Marcus Rashford from the squad for the third consecutive match, fueling speculation about the player's future at the club. Rashford, present at the stadium but not on the bench, seems to have fallen out of favor with the manager. In a recent interview, the 27-year-old expressed his readiness for a ""new challenge"" away from Manchester United.","Bournemouth secured a resounding 3-0 victory against Manchester United at Old Trafford.

CHENNAI: Touted as one of the brightest young players from India, 15-year-old Maaya Rajeshwaran Revathi has been called up to train at the prestigious Rafa Nadal Academy in Spain. Several top players have successfully graduated from the academy and made a mark in the sport.The Tamil Nadu teenager, who has signed a one-year contract, will begin her stint formally in January. Looking for training opportunities in Europe, Maaya chose the Rafa Nadal Academy.“We wanted her to train in Europe as it is one of the best places. The offer came directly from the Rafa Nadal Academy. They conducted a screening process for about a week or 10 days. After the screening, they offered her a contract for one year,” Manoj, Maaya’s personal coach and mentor for the past five years, told TOI on Friday.“Maaya has been assigned a dedicated coach. She will also have a coach who could travel with her for tournaments. Maaya had visited a couple of other academies and in the end, we (her coach and family) decided to take up the offer from Nadal’s academy,” Manoj added.The past few months have been pretty good for Maaya as she has defeated several top junior players in the ITF circuit . She went on to reach the final of the National Championships after getting through the qualifying stage. The stint at the academy could prove to be a game-changer and will be worth its weight in gold.“The next couple of years are very crucial for her. She needs to climb the ladder pretty quickly. I think that the focus should be more on doing well at the senior level. She needs to start doing reasonably well in the women’s circuit in another year or year-and-a-half. She has the potential to do well. On the women’s side, I think that she is the next bet forIndian tennis ,” said Manoj about Maaya, India No. 2 among juniors.While Maaya will be training in Spain, Manoj will continue to mentor her from India. “If she travels to or within Asia, maybe I could probably travel with her if that is a requirement,” Manoj said.Up next for the youngster is three ITF tournaments in India from December to January. “Maaya has opted not to play the junior Australian Open (if she gets into the qualifying draw). She has to get her visa to be in Spain for a year, so that will take a little bit of time.”","Maaya Rajeshwaran Revathi has been called up to train at the prestigious Rafa Nadal Academy in Spain.

Novak Djokovic will run out of energy: Andre Agassi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/novak-djokovic-will-run-out-of-energy-andre-agassi/articleshow/116235405.cms,"American legend

Andre Agassi

believes Djokovic will miss Federer & Nadal, the guys he came to the dance with

Excerpts:

Djokovic's longevity:

Andy Murray coaching Djokovic:

Carlos Alcaraz

and longevity…

American men haven't had results like the women:

Graf was the hardest victory I ever had: Agassi

BENGALURU: Andre Agassi wondered if the 24-time major winner Novak Djokovic would miss his greatest rivals -- the now-retired Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer -- in the last leg of a glittering career where the 37-year-old goes for more history.The eight-time Grand Slam champion, in the city for the TiE Global Summit, assessed Djokovic's run and the Serb's recent partnership with friend and rival Andy Murray in a candid chat with media.It's hard to say, Father Time always wins. He has already done so much for so long, it's hard to imagine longer. We said that about (Roger) Federer too. I think Novak will run out of energy more than capability. Cannot be easy, especially when the people you came to the dance with have left, that's a big thing.When Pete (Sampras) retired it was a blow to me, it set me back a little bit. It made me rediscover my inspirations on some level. Djokovic has lost the guys he made history with. It'll probably get tougher and tougher emotionally, but I would never bet against them. Bet against them at your peril.In any coach-student relationship you need trust and trust can take time, but it's nice when it starts with believing in somebody because you know that they know your experience. There's an asset to their history as competitors.Any success of a relationship is based on complete buy-in and that's always the part you have to wait and see. It's not what I know that changes your career, information doesn't lead to transformation, somebody has to counter that. That's the connector. I'm sure there's going to be a lot of trust immediately, we'll see how the results go.Alcaraz defends like Novak, has more power and spin like Nadal, hands and finesse like Federer but just because he has the best of all the three doesn't mean he can do what they did. There are so many parts to the game such as decision-making, injuries, luck. So how long can (Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner) do it (for)? They could do it for 20 years or not.The women's game hasn't had to deal with Roger Federer, Novak Djokovic, Rafael, Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz, but they have their version of it. Serena Williams is the Novak of the women's game and you got Coco as a potential, like Alcaraz has potential and Sinner has potential.How the game evolves is interesting. The women's game has gotten very powerful, just straight power. For lack of a better example, Lindsay Davenport was powerful, tall, precise through the court and now you have a lot of that. There's still room for somebody who can offset that kind of power, like an Ash Barty.The men's game has changed in the sense that guys have gotten bigger with longer levers, which means they're better athletes, they can move and they need more time, they start playing further back. Soon you're going to start seeing the net game start coming back, everything morphs in its own way. But the biggest issue for American (men) not winning is an unfortunate set of decades where the guys were very stingy and very greedy -- 66 Grand Slams in the same generation. There's not a lot left there (for others)!Andre Agassi - the second of five men to achieve a career Grand Slam in the Open Era and the first man to complete a career golden slam - has won it all, including a stirring love match.""She was the hardest victory I ever had,"" said Agassi of his wife German tennis legend Steffi Graf, a 22-time major winner.Agassi, who has won eight major titles and the Olympic gold, speaking during a session at the TiE Global Summit, said, ""We all live a hero's journey - first part of life is about performing and achieving. Then life hits us with broken relationships and dreams. I went through it all. Finally, in the last phase of the journey, it's about serving others.""The 54-year-old said, ""At 28 my (tennis) career started over. Without the struggles, I would've never gotten Steffi to say yes. I tried to get her for years.""On a lighter note, Agassi said he likes to keep his trophies out of the house. ""I don't bring my trophies home, because if I bring my trophies home, then she brings her trophies home - and that's bad math!""",Andre Agassi believes Novak Djokovic will run out of energy more than capability. The eight-time Grand Slam champion is in the city for the TiE Global Summit.

NEW DELHI: Legendary player Andre Agassi observed that Carlos Alcaraz embodies distinct qualities from Novak Djokovic Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal , while advising the tennis world against anticipating the young Spaniard to match the extraordinary achievements of these tennis legends.The collective Grand Slam victories of Federer, Nadal and Djokovic stand at 66, whilst Alcaraz, aged 21, has secured four major titles thus far.""I'm not a genius and I don't have a crystal ball. What I can tell you is Alcaraz defends like Novak, has power and spin like Nadal and has hands and finesse like Federer,"" said Agassi during a talk session in Bengaluru.The eight-time Grand Slam victor Agassi elaborated on why excessive expectations shouldn't burden Alcaraz.""Just because he has the best of all those three doesn't mean he can do what they did because there're so many other parts to the game, which mean decision-making, injuries, you know, luck,"" he said.With Djokovic at 37, approaching retirement, Agassi noted that the Serbian's competitive edge might diminish without Nadal and Federer in the arena.""He's already done so much, so long, and it's hard to imagine longer. I think he'll run out of the energy for it more than the capability of it, I would imagine.""It cannot be easy, especially when the people you came to the dance with have left.""The American provided additional context to his assessment.""When Pete (Sampras) retired, it was a blow to me. It set me back a little bit. It made me have to rediscover my inspirations on some level.""And he's (Djokovic) lost the guys that he's made history with. So, it's probably emotionally going to get tougher and tougher quickly, but I would never bet against him. Bet against him at your own peril,"" said Agassi.Regarding Djokovic's recent appointment of Andy Murray as coach to extend his career, Agassi expressed interest in their partnership's development.""They've been fierce rivals on court, and now Murray will be coaching Djokovic.

NEW DELHI: Tennis icon Andre Agassi on Tuesday highlighted how sports should remain integral to education, noting their role in teaching children to cope with defeat.At a Bengaluru event focussed on sports and education's role in fostering excellence, Agassi shared his insights.""Even when you have a failure, you have to get up and play again the next day. So, what sports is teaching you is that focusing on winning and losing is really a distraction from what we need to be thinking about. We need to be thinking about how to get better,"" he said.Since 2001, Agassi has invested in education for underprivileged children, establishing 130 schools serving approximately 80,000 students in the United States. He attributes this achievement to his persistent drive to overcome obstacles.His demanding tennis career shaped his ability to maintain focus and adapt when necessary.""Sports is all about problem-solving. Tennis taught me how to navigate a very intense environment and maintain my objectivity and problem-solving abilities. It forces me to be present, but also to understand the context of what I'm doing,"" Agassi said.Regarding his earlier defiant period, Agassi acknowledged it as a necessary phase in his journey.""Vulnerability is essential for growth, and I think vulnerability eventually leads to humility,"" he added.He recognised technology's crucial role in education, particularly in providing individualised learning opportunities for children. This belief influenced his investment in the Indian EdTech company, Square Panda .""I think technology can play an essential role, not just in scalability, but also in optimising personalised learning. That's why I got involved with Square Panda.

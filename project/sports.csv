South Africa secured a commanding 10-wicket victory against Sri Lanka in a rain-affected Women's World Cup match on Friday. The match was reduced to 20 overs per side after a rain delay of more than five hours. Laura Wolvaardt and Tazmin Brits, South Africa's opening pair, delivered outstanding unbeaten half-centuries. Wolvaardt scored 60 not out from 47 balls, while Brits contributed 55 not out from 42 balls.South Africa successfully chased down the target of 121 runs, set under the Duckworth-Lewis-Stern method, with 31 balls remaining. The team reached 125 without losing any wickets in 14.5 overs, with Brits finishing the match with a six over midwicket.Nonkululeko Mlaba, South Africa's left-arm spinner, took three wickets for 30 runs despite challenging conditions with a wet and slippery ball. Sri Lanka managed to score 105 for seven, with Vishmi Gunaratne contributing 34 runs from 33 balls.The revised target using the DLS method proved challenging for Sri Lanka's bowling unit against South Africa's strong batting lineup. The opening partnership between Wolvaardt and Brits maintained a quick scoring rate throughout the chase.Sri Lanka, choosing to bat first, struggled early and lost two wickets for 37 runs in 10 overs. Rain interrupted play with Sri Lanka at 46 for two in 12 overs, leading to a five-hour delay.The match resumed after groundsmen worked efficiently to prepare the field. Kavisha Dilhari immediately showed intent by hitting a six off Mlaba's first ball after the restart.South Africa responded strongly by taking two quick wickets. Gunaratne, who had earlier retired hurt after being struck on the knee, returned to score some important boundaries despite South Africa's difficulties with the wet ball.Before the rain delay, Masabata Klass gave South Africa an excellent start by dismissing Hasini Perera and captain Chamari Athapaththu early in the innings.Sri Lanka remain winless in the tournament, holding two points from five matches. These points came from rain-abandoned matches against Australia and New Zealand.South Africa have now won four consecutive matches, showing remarkable recovery after their tournament opener where England bowled them out for 69 runs.",South Africa secured a commanding 10-wicket victory against Sri Lanka.

Chief selector Ajit Agarkar has clarified that senior players Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma are not being evaluated on a trial basis for the upcoming ODI series against Australia.The three-match series will not determine their chances for the 2027 World Cup. Agarkar emphasised that their exceptional records make it unreasonable to judge their future prospects based on a single series.The first ODI between India and Australia is scheduled to take place in Perth on Sunday.Currently, both Kohli and Rohit exclusively play ODI cricket, resulting in their absence from international cricket for nearly six months leading up to the Australia series beginning Sunday.By the time of the 2027 World Cup in Southern Africa, Rohit would be over 40 and Kohli would be past 39. While some cricketers like Imran Khan have succeeded at similar ages, the physical demands of modern cricket have intensified significantly.""They are part of the squad for Australia,"" Agarkar told NDTV. ""They have been incredible players for a long time. It's not a forum to keep harping on individuals. You want to focus on the team and what the team wants to achieve. And in two years' time, we don't know what the situation is going to be.So, why just them two? It could be some other younger players.""""That'll be a bit silly, isn't it? When one averages over 50 (Kohli, 57.9) and one is close to 50 (Rohit, 48.8), you are not going to put them on trial for every game. 2027 is a long way away, they play only one format, are playing after the Champions Trophy final on the 9th of March. They are playing 19th of October… so once they start playing, then you assess as you go forward. They are not on trial. They have achieved all they had to achieve, not just in terms of trophies but runs.""It's not that if both of them don't get runs this series, that'll be the reason they won't be there, or if they get three hundreds, that'll be the reason they play 2027. It's still a long way away. We'll see how it all shapes up. We have some ideas, and as we go along, we'll have a better idea of how the team is progressing.""When questioned about whether legacy players could become a burden for the team, Agarkar emphasised the importance of maintaining a balance between experience and youth.""Not at all. You have legacy cricketers because they have built it for themselves with their performances. There's not one team in the world that won't want experience. It's always got to be a balance between some of our youth or newer players and the senior players to guide them. You'd rather have the experienced players playing well. When you have been around for a while, you take pride in your performances.""Like I said, they have created that legacy for themselves, and you treat them with that respect. Maybe some of the conversations you have with those players don't come out, but you treat them with nothing but respect. You want them around the team, every year so many players make debut for India, you want the senior guys to be around to guide them.""",Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma are not being evaluated on a trial basis for the upcoming ODI series against Australia.

Since joining the India squad for the Australia tour starting October 19, all eyes have been on Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma . The two former captains are playing only in ODIs this series, which makes each appearance on the field even more special for fans.That excitement was captured perfectly in a heartwarming moment in Perth, where the Indian team is currently training. A young fan managed to get Kohli ’s autograph and could barely contain his joy, running around in sheer delight after meeting his idol.Click here to watch the video. Kohli and Rohit wasted no time settling into the nets during the team’s first training session ahead of the three-match ODI series against Australia. Both spent close to 30 minutes batting, showcasing the form and intensity that have made them legends of the game. Rohit was also seen having a long conversation with head coach Gautam Gambhir after his time in the nets, reflecting the duo’s ongoing commitment to the team.The pair retired from Tests earlier this year and had stepped away from India’s T20 setup after winning the World Cup in Barbados last year. This series could very well be their final tour in Australia, and while their participation in the 2027 World Cup remains uncertain and dependent on form and fitness, new captain Shubman Gill has expressed confidence in their experience and leadership.For fans, though, moments like the young boy getting Kohli’s autograph serve as a reminder of the lasting impact these two superstars have, both on and off the field.",Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma are playing only in ODIs this series.

Australia heads into the upcoming ODI series against India facing a series of setbacks, with several key players unavailable for the opening matches. Pat Cummins has been ruled out of the white-ball series against India due to lower back issues, while all-rounder Cameron Green will miss the three ODIs scheduled for October 19, 23, and 25 because of side soreness. Green’s injury has been assessed as low grade, but Cricket Australia is taking a cautious approach given his importance for the Ashes campaign.Marnus Labuschagne has been called in as Green’s replacement. The batter returns to the ODI setup in excellent form, having scored four centuries for his domestic side this season, including two in the 50-over format. Labuschagne had initially been overlooked after disappointing scores of 1 and 1 in the home ODIs against South Africa in August.Australia has already made two other changes for the series opener. Josh Philippe will take the place of Josh Inglis , who remains sidelined with a calf strain, and Matthew Kuhnemann replaces Adam Zampa , who is unavailable for the first ODI due to family commitments. Alex Carey is also missing the first game for family reasons. Zampa, Inglis, and Carey are expected to return from the second ODI onwards.Despite the absences, Australia’s squad for the opening match includes captain Mitchell Marsh , Travis Head, Mitchell Starc, Josh Hazlewood, Marnus Labuschagne, Matthew Renshaw, Matthew Short, Cooper Connolly, Xavier Bartlett, Ben Dwarshuis, Nathan Ellis, Mitchell Owen, and Josh Philippe. From the second game onwards, the squad will be strengthened with Adam Zampa, Alex Carey, and Josh Inglis back in action.Australia will need to find rhythm quickly as they face a strong Indian side, with the missing leaders and key players a significant hurdle in their bid to start the series on a strong note.","Cameron Green and Pat Cummins ruled out of ODI series against India.

Pakistan-Afghanistan Clashes: Heavy Fighting Along Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Border, Taliban Posts Damaged

NEW DELHI: Afghanistan captain Rashid Khan lashed out at Pakistan following the killing of three local cricketers, describing the attack as “absolutely immoral and barbaric.” The comments came after Afghanistan announced their withdrawal from a tri-nation series with Pakistan and Sri Lanka next month, following the deaths of the players in an incident that has shocked the cricketing community.The Afghanistan Cricket Board (ACB) said the players had travelled from Urgun to Sharana in eastern Paktika province, near the Pakistan border, to participate in a friendly match. ""After returning home to Urgun, they were targeted during a gathering,"" the board stated, calling it ""a cowardly attack carried out by the Pakistani regime.""The three players killed were identified as ""Kabeer, Sibghatullah and Haroon,"" while five others also lost their lives in the attack. The ACB did not provide further details but said it ""considers this a great loss for Afghanistan's sports community, its athletes, and the cricketing family,"" extending its ""deepest condolences and solidarity to the bereaved families."" The board added that the decision to withdraw from next month’s tri-series was made ""as a gesture of respect to the victims. ""Rashid took to social media to express his grief: ""I am deeply saddened by the loss of civilian lives in the recent Pakistani aerial strikes on Afghanistan.A tragedy that claimed the lives of women, children, and aspiring young cricketers who dreamed of representing their nation on the world stage. It is absolutely immoral and barbaric to target civilian infrastructure. These unjust and unlawful actions represent a grave violation of human rights and must not go unnoticed. """"In light of the precious innocent souls lost, I welcome the ACB’s decision of withdrawing from upcoming fixtures against Pakistan. I stand with our people at this difficult time, our national dignity must come before all else,"" he added.Afghan international cricketer Fazalhaq Farooqi described the incident as ""a heinous, unforgivable crime,"" while Mohammad Nabi said: ""This incident is not only a tragedy for Paktika but for the entire Afghan cricket family and the nation as a whole.""The attack has sent shockwaves through Afghanistan’s cricket community, prompting widespread mourning and solidarity for the victims and their families.","Afghanistan captain Rashid Khan lashed out at Pakistan following the killing of three local cricketers.

Game two onwards:

India squad:

Australian all-rounder Cameron Green has been ruled out of the upcoming three-match ODI series against India due to a minor side soreness, with Marnus Labuschagne being called up as his replacement. The injury, diagnosed as ""low grade,"" has prompted Cricket Australia to take a precautionary approach, especially considering the upcoming Ashes series.Green experienced discomfort during training this week before the first ODI against India scheduled for Sunday. The 26-year-old is expected to return to cricket in Western Australia's next Sheffield Shield match on October 28.Cricket Australia provided an official statement on the situation: ""Green will complete a short period of rehabilitation and is tracking to return to play in round three of the Sheffield Shield to continue his preparation for the Ashes.""The timing of Green's setback raises concerns with the Ashes series opener against England approaching in five weeks. This comes as Australia already face uncertainty regarding captain Pat Cummins, who is recovering from lumbar back stress.Green had only recently returned to bowling in competitive cricket, taking 1-13 from four overs during Western Australia's Sheffield Shield match against NSW last week. This marked his first bowling spell since undergoing spinal surgery last October.The injury represents a new challenge in Green's careful return to full fitness following his back operation, where doctors fused his L4 vertebrae. The current side soreness is not related to his previous surgery.Labuschagne's inclusion comes after impressive recent performances, including four centuries in the domestic season for Queensland. His teammate Matthew Renshaw provided insight into Labuschagne's current form: ""He's just so on, peak Marnus. It's really good to see, and it's good that the work he's done in the off-season is working out for him now... he's (only) missed out once (this season).""The series against India has faced multiple changes to the Australian lineup. Josh Philippe will replace wicketkeeper Josh Inglis, who is recovering from a calf strain, while Matthew Kuhnemann will step in for Adam Zampa, who will miss the match for personal reasons.Labuschagne's recent form, including two centuries in the one-day format - 130 against Victoria and 105 against Tasmania - strengthens his case for immediate inclusion in the playing XI. His latest achievement includes scoring 159 at Adelaide Oval in the Sheffield Shield.Green's absence could create an opportunity for Matthew Renshaw to make his debut at No.4, a position where he has maintained an average of 50 with a strike rate exceeding 100 over the past four One-Day Cup seasons.The Australian team management continues to prioritise player fitness and recovery, particularly with the crucial Ashes series on the horizon. Other players currently managing injuries include Sean Abbott with a hand injury and Brendan Doggett with a hamstring issue.Jhye Richardson, recovering from shoulder surgery, showed positive signs by bowling a lengthy spell during the ODI squad's first training session in Perth on Thursday.Green had previously skipped the T20 tour of New Zealand to focus on Sheffield Shield cricket as part of his Ashes preparation.Mitchell Marsh (c), Xavier Bartlett, Cooper Connolly, Ben Dwarshuis, Nathan Ellis, Josh Hazlewood, Travis Head, Matthew Kuhnemann, Marnus Labuschagne, Mitchell Owen, Josh Philippe, Matthew Renshaw, Matthew Short, Mitchell Starc.Adam Zampa, Alex Carey, Josh InglisShubman Gill (c), Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, Shreyas Iyer, Axar Patel, KL Rahul, Nitish Kumar Reddy, Washington Sundar, Kuldeep Yadav, Harshit Rana, Mohammed Siraj, Arshdeep Singh, Prasidh Krishna, Dhruv Jurel, Yashasvi Jaiswal",Cameron Green ruled out of three-match ODI series against India.

Brief Scores:

Thiruvananthapuram: Under brooding grey clouds that hovered over the Greenfield Stadium, Kerala ’s batting unravelled in a heap of unfulfilled promise, dismissed for 219 in response to Maharashtra ’s 239.The visitors then raced to 51/0 in 9 overs, courtesy Prithvi Shaw ’s quickfire unbeaten 37, when bad light stopped proceedings an hour before the scheduled close on Friday.A 71-run deficit felt like a punch in the gut to the last season’s runner-up, especially after they won the toss on Day 1 and had Maharashtra on the ropes at 18/5.The innings began today with more hope than direction and soon spiralled into disarray, driven largely by the muddled state of Kerala’s top order.Opener Akshay Chandran scratched and fidgeted for 21 agonising deliveries before departing for a duck on Thursday.Baba Aparajith came and went for 6, while Rohan Kunnumal briefly flickered with a silken 27, before misjudging the moment and gifting his wicket away.When Sanju Samson strode in today, there was a buzz of anticipation. And for a while, he delivered — whipping, driving, and lofting with effortless flair.His 54 was a mix of poise and dazzle, but ended with a faint under-edge off Vicky Ostwal that nestled in the gloves of Saurabh Nawale.Captain Mohammed Azharuddeen looked composed during his 36, until he too edged Ostwal to Nawale.It was left to the ever-reliable Salman Nizar to steady the ship.Calm under fire, he farmed the strike smartly, shielded the tail, and inched Kerala toward parity with a valiant 49 — before getting caught in the deep backward point region by Jalaj Saxena off Mukesh Choudhary, finishing heartbreakingly short of his fifty and the lead.The pitch had its tricks, but this was a psychological collapse as much as a technical one, and Kerala blinked.While Kerala’s top order was lacklustre, their middle and lower order failed to convert their starts into something monumental.“We worked hard on our batting during the off-season camps,” admitted Kerala pacer MD Nidheesh.But none of it came through today.As Maharashtra left the field with a spring in their step and a lead in their kitty, Kerala were left staring into the overcast skies — searching for answers, and a way back into the contest.Maharashtra 239 and 51/0 (Prithvi Shaw 37 not out) lead Kerala 219 ( Sanju Samson 54, Salman Nizar 49, Jalaj Saxena 3/46) by 71 runs.","Kerala's batting unravelled in a heap of unfulfilled promise, dismissed for 219 in response to Maharashtra's 239.

INDORE: Making a strong case for a national recall and a berth in the middle order when the selectors meet to pick the Indian team for the two-Test home series against South Africa, Madhya Pradesh captain Rajat Patidar — recently appointed skipper across formats — scored his maiden first-class double hundred against Punjab in their Ranji Trophy 2025-26 match at the Emerald Heights International School Ground here on Friday.Interestingly, Patidar’s double hundred, which came off 328 balls and included 26 fours, and took Punjab to 519 for eight before rain stopped play, was witnessed by newly-appointed national selector RP Singh, the former India left-arm pacer. Patidar is now set to be picked for the two-Test series against South Africa A, beginning at the Centre of Excellence in Bengaluru from October 30.Patidar thus bettered his previous best first-class score of 196, which he had scored against Tamil Nadu in the 2018 Ranji season.The 32-year-old batter walked in to bat at No. 5 with his side reeling at 155 for four in response to Punjab’s first-innings total of 232.The seasoned middle-order batter then joined forces with Venkatesh Iyer (73) as the duo added 147 runs to steady the innings and help MP gain the crucial first-innings lead.The double ton marked another fine chapter in Patidar’s stellar run in 2025. In blazing form this season, the MP batter has notched up three hundreds and as many fifties in his last eight innings, amassing 663 runs in this phase.Earlier this year, he had led Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) to their maiden IPL title and then captained Central Zone to its first Duleep Trophy win in a decade. In the Duleep Trophy, he recorded four consecutive 50-plus scores, including two centuries in the quarterfinal and final (against South Zone).After a disappointing debut Test series against England in February 2024 — when he managed just 63 runs in three Tests at an average of 10.50 — Patidar bounced back strongly in the last Ranji Trophy season.He was MP’s top run-scorer with 529 runs at an average of 48.09, including one century and two fifties. He also led MP to the final of the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy while performing consistently with the bat.Overall, Patidar has scored 5,196 runs in 73 first-class matches at an average of 44.41, with 16 hundreds.

India's men's senior national football team has dropped to 136th place in the latest FIFA World Rankings, marking their lowest position since November 2016.The team's new ranking coincides with their elimination from both the 2026 FIFA World Cup and the 2027 AFC Asian Cup qualifications.India's football journey has seen significant changes in recent times. After achieving success in the 2023 Intercontinental Cup, SAFF Championship, and Tri-Nation Series, the team's performance has declined considerably.Their promising period, which had helped them reach the top 100 rankings, was followed by a disappointing AFC Asian Cup campaign in Qatar. The team failed to score any goals and suffered three consecutive defeats in the group stage.The national team's leadership has undergone multiple changes, with three different head coaches in less than two years. Igor Štimac was replaced by Manolo Márquez, who was later succeeded by Khalid Jamil.Under Jamil's leadership, the team showed some tactical improvements during the CAFA Nations Cup friendly tournament. However, their competitive match results have remained unsatisfactory.The team's most recent competitive victory was against Kuwait in November 2023, with a score of 1-0.In the global rankings, Spain maintains its position at the top, followed by Argentina and France in second and third places respectively. The top eight positions are completed by England, Portugal, the Netherlands, Brazil, and Belgium.Germany has moved up two positions to 10th place after winning their qualifying matches against Luxembourg and Northern Ireland. Croatia has moved down to 11th position following their draw with the Czech Republic.The rankings will play a crucial role in determining the seedings for the expanded 48-team 2026 World Cup draw scheduled for December 5. The United States, Canada, and Mexico, as co-hosts, will be placed in the top-seed pot along with the nine highest-ranked direct qualifiers, likely including Germany.","India's men's senior national football team has dropped to 136th place in the latest FIFA World Rankings.

Italy 'Bans' Israel From Participating In Milan Fair; 'Morally Not Right' | Watch

British officials are under mounting pressure to reverse a decision that prevents Maccabi Tel Aviv supporters from attending a European match at Aston Villa. The Israeli government has criticised this ban.Aston Villa announced that following police guidance, away fans would not be permitted at the UEFA Europa League match against the Israeli club in Birmingham on November 6 due to security concerns.""Shameful decision! I call on the UK authorities to reverse this coward decision,"" posted Israel's foreign minister Gideon Saar on X.UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer opposed the decision. He expressed his views on social media platform X.""We will not tolerate antisemitism on our streets. The role of the police is to ensure all football fans can enjoy the game, without fear of violence or intimidation,"" Starmer wrote on X.Britain's Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy plans to meet with interior ministry officials and stakeholders to discuss possible solutions to the ban.""The Prime Minister has said we will do everything we possibly can to resolve this issue,"" Ian Murray told UK media.Villa received instructions from the Safety Advisory Group, which oversees safety certificates for matches at Villa Park stadium.""The SAG have formally written to the club and UEFA to advise no away fans will be permitted to attend Villa Park for this fixture,"" stated Villa's announcement.The club explained that West Midlands Police expressed concerns about public safety outside the stadium and their ability to manage potential protests.Villa mentioned ongoing discussions with Maccabi Tel Aviv and local authorities, prioritising spectator and resident safety.Local police classified the match as high risk after a thorough assessment.""This decision is based on current intelligence and previous incidents, including violent clashes and hate crime offences that occurred during the 2024 UEFA Europa League match between Ajax and Maccabi Tel Aviv in Amsterdam,"" said a West Midlands police spokesperson.The Ajax versus Maccabi Tel Aviv match last November resulted in violent confrontations between pro-Palestinian protesters and Israeli fans.Israeli team supporters faced attacks in Amsterdam. The situation escalated with Maccabi fans engaging in anti-Arab chants and vandalism.Emily Damari, a British-Israeli previously held captive by Hamas, expressed disappointment at being unable to watch her supported team, Maccabi.""Football is a way of bringing people together irrespective of their faith, colour or religion, and this disgusting decision does the exact opposite,"" Damari stated.Maccabi Tel Aviv's chief executive Jack Angelides spoke about their experiences in other countries. He mentioned that despite less favourable sentiment toward Israeli teams, strong police presence prevented incidents.","British officials are under mounting pressure to reverse a decision that prevents Maccabi Tel Aviv supporters from attending a European match at Aston Villa.

Juergen Klinsmann enjoys a rare distinction of being part of Der Klassiker both as a player and a coach. He is one of the four managers to have played for Bayern Munich and coached the Bavarian elites. Croatian Niko Kovac, the current Borussia Dortmund coach plotting to disrupt Bayern Munich’s all-win record this season on Saturday, is also part of the unique club.Talking to TOI on Wednesday, an excited Klinsmann expressed his thoughts on the upcoming fixture, considered to be the biggest draw in the Bundesliga. With Dortmund’s Serhou Guirassy cleared to play, the German goal-scoring legend feels that his eyes will sway between the Guinean striker and Bayern’s in-form Harry Kane “Well, I think these are the games that, as a striker, you wait for the whole year. You badly want to score in these matchups. So, obviously it doesn’t need extra motivation for any of the players when these two teams clash because it’s a big deal in Germany and for all the Bundesliga fans around the world.”Klinsmann obviously loves talking about strikers. “Kane, Guirassy, (Michael) Olise, (Karim) Adeyemi, all, I’m sure, wait for such evenings.Days before, you kind of think through it and you wish you want to score. Immediately television and social media will showcase the moment around the world and that’s pretty cool.”Scoring seems to come as naturally as breathing for Harry Kane, the English captain in Bayern’s forward lineup. He has already scored 21 goals for club and country. Guirassy, too, has 10 to his credit across all competitions.“I think games like that, you want to have somebody to stand out. You want to have somebody to put the stamp on the match. And when you have players of this calibre, then all us football fans want to wait for these moments. We want to see them kind of prove a point,” said the German goal-scoring legend.Klinsmann couldn’t help referring to his playing days but not in a glorifying nostalgic way. Accepting the evolution of the game, he said, “The video analysts and the coaching staff dissect your game so thoroughly that they know where the weaknesses of the opponents are, how to break them down. During my days, things weren’t that sophisticated. We were not so deeply prepared by video analysts about the opponents.”(Watch Bundesliga 2025-26 Bayern Munich vs. Borussia Dortmund on 18th October 2025 from 10 PM IST live on Sony Sports Ten 2 SD & HD.)","Juergen Klinsmann is one of the four managers to have played for Bayern Munich and coached the Bavarian elites.

Poll Should XL bully dogs be banned in all countries? Yes, for public safety. No, responsible ownership is key. Maybe, with stricter regulations.

Algeria international and Saudi Pro League winger Said Benrahma has been fined £12,000 (Rs 14 lakh) for owning dangerously out-of-control dogs that attacked a golden retriever in 2023 while he was playing for West Ham.Benrahma admitted to two counts of owning dangerously out-of-control dogs during a court hearing via video link from Saudi Arabia, where he currently plays for Neom.The incident took place in east London when his two XL bullies escaped from his home and attacked a golden retriever named Bailey, injuring the dog and a man.The retriever required veterinary treatment, while its owner sustained grazes to the arms and legs.Benrahma defended himself by saying the dogs escaped through a side gate left open by someone working for him at the time. The dogs now live in France.District Judge Matt Jabbitt imposed fines of £5,000 for each attack and ordered Benrahma to pay £2,500 compensation to Bailey’s owner, plus £495 in kennel costs.The judge noted that Benrahma “expressed remorse when interviewed” and also remarked that it was his first time “sentencing someone in the Middle East.”The case took place months before the British government introduced a ban on owning XL bully dogs in England and Wales following a series of fatal attacks.Under the current law, it is a criminal offense to own such dogs without a certificate of exemption.Despite Benrahma's defense, the magistrate emphasized the severity of the attacks, which left both an animal and a person injured.The winger’s case has drawn attention not only because of his footballing profile but also due to the growing public scrutiny around XL bully dogs and the potential dangers posed when such animals are left unsupervised.","Said Benrahma has been fined £12,000 (around USD 16,000) for owning dangerously out-of-control dogs that attacked a golden retriever in 2023 while he was playing for West Ham.

Erin Campaneris breaks her silence after Mark Sanchez’s arrest

From NFL glory to criminal charges and family fallout





Former NFL quarterback Mark Sanchez is facing mounting personal and legal trouble, and now his ex-girlfriend and the mother of his 8-year-old son, Erin Campaneris, is trying to shield herself and her child from the fallout. Following Sanchez’s shocking felony arrest in Indianapolis, Campaneris, a 46-year-old UK-born model and daughter of baseball legend Bert Campaneris, has reportedly been staying at her parents’ home in Arizona.Sanchez, once celebrated as the New York Jets’ golden boy, was charged with felony battery after allegedly assaulting a 69-year-old truck driver during a violent confrontation in Indianapolis. Campaneris, who also goes by Bobby T, didn’t hold back in her reaction. “Sadly, none of this is surprising to me,” she wrote in an Instagram Story on Sunday, making her first public comment since the former quarterback’s arrest.The model later clarified her decision to speak out, explaining, “My foremost priority has always been, and remains, our eight-year-old son, Daniel. I chose to remain silent publicly to protect Daniel. I have always been concerned for [Daniel’s] safety and for what he is exposed to.”Campaneris was spotted days later outside her parents’ modest condo, walking with her son as media attention intensified. Her mother, Evelyn, told The New York Post that Erin isn’t living there permanently, but insiders say she’s “lying low” until the media chaos settles.The public drama surrounding Sanchez marks a sharp decline for the former quarterback-turned-analyst, who once graced both sports broadcasts and red carpets. His image as a family man took a hit after his marriage to actress Perry Mattfeld, who announced in February that she was expecting twins with him.Sanchez’s legal case stems from an alleged violent altercation with truck driver Perry Tole, who claims he was “beaten to a pulp” and has since filed a civil lawsuit citing “severe permanent disfigurement.” Sanchez faces a Level 5 felony and several misdemeanor charges.Also Read: Mark Sanchez’s career on the brink as stabbing scandal and felony charges threaten to end his NFL broadcast comeback As the court date looms, Erin Campaneris seems determined to keep her distance.

Focus returns to football as docuseries goes on hold

NFL legend turned college coach Bill Belichick has reportedly backed out of a much-anticipated Hulu docuseries, citing concerns that the project would spotlight his personal relationship with Jordon Hudson rather than his work with the University of North Carolina’s football program. According to exclusive sources, Belichick and Hudson both refused to sign appearance releases for what was tentatively titled “The Untitled Bill and Jordon Project.”The 73-year-old coaching icon, who took over UNC’s football program earlier this year, was initially “enthusiastic to give unprecedented access to the program.” However, a source close to the project told PEOPLE that the direction Hulu wanted to take was not what Belichick had envisioned.“Jordon, Bill and UNC all agreed that Hulu’s vision of the project was not in alignment with theirs,” the insider explained. “It’s too bad Hulu wanted to dive deep into his home life.”Hulu, on the other hand, reportedly wanted something more dramatic and entertainment-driven, described by another insider as “Keeping Up with the Belichicks.” That idea, however, “was never for sale.”The production hit a wall when both Belichick and Hudson declined to participate, forcing Hulu to shelve the project.“The potential future of the project has been put on the back burner,” said the source, adding that the coach is now “laser-focused on the football team.”For now, Belichick’s attention remains on improving UNC’s performance on the field. “It’ll show our commitment to winning, it’ll show our commitment to the team, and that’s our priority,” he previously told reporters when discussing the project’s initial goals.Industry insiders say the series could eventually find a new home, as discussions with other streaming platforms are reportedly underway.

The Chicago Bulls then signed Trentyn Flowers as part of a two-way contract, who played for the Adelaide 36ers in the NBL in Australia.The details of the contract with the Chicago Bulls have not been disclosed, but this is not McClung’s first time with the team. The player played for the Windy Bulls back as part of the 2021-2022 NBA G League season. The guard has played in six regular seasons since 2021. The last team McClung was signed with was the Orlando Magic in a two-way contract in 2024.In a surprise move, the Chicago Bulls have also decided to waive Yuki Kawamura. Trentyn Flowers joined the team following the waiver of the two players. The Chicago Bulls recently completed their preseason with a 126-120 win against the Minnesota Timberwolves. The team will start its regular season against the Detroit Pistons on October 22.Although he went undrafted in the 2021 NBA Draft, Mac McClung has played with several teams in the NBA and the G League. The player had previously played for the Windy Bulls for the 2021-2022 season in the G League. The 26-year-old showed a lot of promise, being among the two players to win the NBA Slam Dunk Contest three consecutive times.The player has also dominated the G League with several accolades to his name. He won the 2022-2023 NBA G League Rookie of the Year award and helped the Delaware Blue Coats become champions in the 2023 G League.While McClung is yet to become a full-time rotation player in the NBA, he has been a dominant force in the G League. Following the Chicago Bulls' waiver, the player’s fate is now up in the air. However, looking at his accomplishments, the player could bounce back stronger than ever.","Mac McClung was waived by the Chicago Bulls just three hours after signing a contract.

A Depth Test Ahead of the Regular Season

Thepreseason game on October 17, 2025, was heavily defined by injury concerns on both sides. As the teams wrapped up their exhibition schedules, several key players were ruled out, forcing both coaching staffs to rely on rotational depth and younger talent.The Charlotte Hornets entered their final preseason contest without multiple core contributors. LaMelo Ball was ruled out with a right knee contusion suffered in the previous matchup. While his absence was largely precautionary, it significantly impacted the Charlotte Hornets’ offensive rhythm and playmaking capabilities. Ball’s injury is expected to keep him sidelined until at least October 22.Rookie standout Brandon Miller also missed the game due to right wrist soreness, joining a growing list of unavailable players. Additional absentees included Josh Green (recovering from left shoulder surgery), Grant Williams (rehabbing from right knee surgery), and Tre Mann (dealing with right hip soreness). All three were ruled out for the preseason finale, leaving head coach Steve Clifford with limited rotation options and reduced star power.With so many sidelined players, Charlotte leaned on its bench unit and developmental prospects to close out the preseason.Despite the adversity, the Charlotte Hornets focused on experimenting with lineup combinations and emphasizing player development ahead of the regular season.The New York Knicks also entered the matchup with injury concerns, managing the health of several prominent players. Josh Hart, who sustained a lower back injury during the team’s preseason games in Abu Dhabi, remained unavailable and was considered unlikely to return before the regular season opener.Center Mitchell Robinson, who has a history of injury setbacks and limited availability last season, was also held out as a precaution. Additionally, newly acquired Karl-Anthony Towns sat out due to a quad issue, though he remains an integral part of the New York Knicks’ long-term plans. OG Anunoby continued to recover from an ankle injury and was listed as day-to-day.Head coach Mike Brown emphasized a cautious approach, choosing to prioritize health over preseason competition. His focus was on long-term player wellness and ensuring that his roster enters the regular season fully fit. Brown’s strategy also allowed other players to step into larger roles, offering valuable opportunities to showcase depth and versatility before the games begin to count.With LaMelo Ball , Brandon Miller, Josh Hart, and Karl-Anthony Towns all watching from the sidelines, the Charlotte Hornets vs New York Knicks preseason finale lacked some of its expected star appeal. However, the game provided a meaningful test of depth and chemistry for both squads.For Charlotte, the night served as a chance to evaluate backup guards and forwards in extended minutes, a valuable exercise given the injury uncertainty surrounding Ball and Miller. For New York, the focus was on fine-tuning bench rotations and building cohesion among secondary units, all while ensuring the main rotation remained healthy for the season’s start.Though missing marquee names, the game showcased resilience and adaptability. Both teams treated the matchup as a strategic opportunity rather than a high-stakes contest, emphasizing player evaluation and preparation for the upcoming campaign.The October 17, 2025, preseason clash between the Charlotte Hornets and New York Knicks was ultimately defined by its injury absences. The Charlotte Hornets were without LaMelo Ball and Brandon Miller, while the New York Knicks rested Josh Hart, Mitchell Robinson, Karl-Anthony Towns, and OG Anunoby.With so many regulars out, the game highlighted roster depth and the importance of cautious injury management. Both teams opted for long-term stability over short-term success, using the preseason finale as a platform to test readiness and resilience ahead of the 2025–26 NBA season.","The Charlotte Hornets were without LaMelo Ball and Brandon Miller.

Bob Myers takes on a new challenge that could redefine his legacy in global sports

Bob Myers bridges championship legacy with a bold new global sports mission

On Pattison

Bob Myers, the two-time NBA executive of the year and general manager of the Golden State Warriors, returned to sports management on Friday when he was named president of Harris Blitzer Sports & Entertainment. In order to become president of sports, the former general manager of the Golden State Warriors is resigning from his position as an ESPN basketball analyst. He will be able to work in several of the top leagues in the world as a result.With the objective of optimizing possibilities and strengthening procedures for a portfolio that includes the NHL Devils, NBA 76ers, Premier League Crystal Palace F.C., and an investment in Joe Gibbs Racing, Myers will now work full-time. Josh Harris, the Washington Commanders' managing partner, will also continue to receive assistance from Myers.He will collaborate with HBSE's co-founders and managing partners , Josh Harris and David Blitzer, ""to deliver championship-caliber teams to the communities they serve.”Harris is the managing partner of the NFL's Washington Commanders, and Myers had previously been advising him. He will also be associated with other assets that HBSE has some sort of affiliation with, such as the NBA's Philadelphia 76ers, NHL's New Jersey Devils, Premier League's Crystal Palace, and NASCAR's Joe Gibbs Racing.Announcing the news, he said:“I have been fortunate to know Josh and David for a long time, and I’ve always greatly admired them and respected how they’ve built such an impressive global sports portfolio... This role was intriguing because it provides the opportunity to work with some of the industry’s most talented leaders and executives across the world’s biggest sports leagues. … This is the type of challenge and opportunity I was looking for. ”Myers' main duty, according to HBSE, will be to optimize prospects and enhance procedures within its international sports portfolio. Although he won't change the current team reporting structures, he will collaborate closely with senior leadership and ownership. This implies that team ownership will continue to get reports from officials like Sixers president Daryl Morey.Stating the same, the company said in a statement:“Our goal has been to hire, grow, and retain the best and brightest executives in the world and we are a stronger, more dynamic organization with the addition of Bob Myers.""For the two-time NBA Executive of the Year, the move represents a return to sports management.Myers joined the Warriors in 2011 as assistant general manager and progressed through the ranks of the organization. After being elevated to general manager in 2012, he went on to become the president of basketball operations.Golden State became one of the most significant teams in the NBA and won four titles during his tenure. Prior to his resignation in 2023, Myers was named Executive of the Year in 2015 and 2017.Before joining the Warriors' front office in 2011, Myers worked as a sports agent for 14 years. He spent 12 seasons with Golden State, rising swiftly to the position of general manager before being named president.Myers now will continue to work throughout HBSE's global network from his California base, resuming his leadership role that links his championship history to a global future. He will be able to work remotely from California in this full-time position while still often visiting HBSE companies.On Friday morning, a source toldthat Myers is also reportedly collaborating with the entire ownership group. His responsibilities will cover every team in the portfolio, giving Myers a presence in a wide range of sports. He seemed very happy and content during the interviews.Also read: Stephen Curry celebrates New York Times bestseller milestone with new photo book","Bob Myers has been named president of Harris Blitzer Sports & Entertainment.

will take the court tonight as thewrap up their preseason schedule against the Sacramento Kings on October 17, 2025. The star guard, who had been sidelined earlier this month due to a leg contusion sustained during EuroBasket, has officially been cleared to play and is expected to lead the Lakers’ backcourt in their final tune-up before the regular season.After a cautious start to the preseason, Luka Doncic has returned to full-speed practices and will make his second appearance of the exhibition campaign. The Los Angeles Lakers’ coaching and medical teams have been managing his recovery carefully, ensuring his conditioning builds up steadily while avoiding unnecessary risk. His inclusion in tonight’s lineup signals confidence in his readiness, and the team views this game as an ideal opportunity to fine-tune their rotations.The Los Angeles Lakers will start Luka Doncic alongside Austin Reaves, Rui Hachimura, Jake LaRavia, and Deandre Ayton. This combination highlights head coach Darvin Ham’s intent to get Doncic integrated with key pieces of the starting unit before the season begins. Los Angeles enters the contest with a 1-4 preseason record, showing flashes of promise despite missing LeBron James, who continues to recover from a pinched nerve.For Luka Doncic , tonight represents an important milestone in his comeback.After showcasing impressive form overseas before his minor injury, he is expected to resume his dynamic playmaking and high-volume scoring that define his style. The Lakers’ staff have closely monitored his workload throughout training camp, emphasizing gradual conditioning as they prepare him for the rigors of an 82-game season.On the other side, the Sacramento Kings will be without star big man Domantas Sabonis, who is out due to a hamstring strain. His absence leaves a noticeable void in the frontcourt, but the Kings are set to debut Russell Westbrook, who will make his first appearance with the team. Westbrook’s veteran leadership and tempo are expected to offset the loss of Sabonis to some extent as the Kings continue to shape their new lineup.Tonight’s matchup carries added intrigue as both teams seek rhythm and chemistry heading into the regular season. For the Los Angeles Lakers, the focus will be on how Luka Doncic orchestrates the offense and adapts his play alongside his new teammates. With James unavailable, Doncic shoulders a heavier responsibility to lead the offense and maintain tempo against a Kings squad eager to test their restructured roster.The Los Angeles Lakers’ decision to bring Doncic back now underscores their long-term plan to make him a cornerstone player after an injury-plagued previous year.

Thewrap up their preseason journeys tonight, October 17, 2025, at Crypto.com Arena. While anticipation for the regular season builds, both squads head into this matchup with extensive injury lists that could significantly impact their early-season form. Here’s a complete look at who’s available, who isn’t, and how both sides are managing ahead of opening night.The Sacramento Kings enter the contest severely depleted, with several key contributors ruled out or limited. Star center Domantas Sabonis will not play after suffering a mild right hamstring strain during a recent scrimmage against the Clippers. Though categorized as a Grade 1 strain, his availability for the October 22 season opener remains uncertain, pending further evaluation and how his body responds to rest and rehabilitation.Meanwhile, DeMar DeRozan is listed as probable due to groin soreness, and Keegan Murray will be sidelined following left thumb UCL surgery, which is expected to keep him out for approximately four to six weeks. Malik Monk is also unavailable due to illness, depriving the Kings of one of their most dynamic bench scorers.Sabonis’ absence will be particularly noticeable. He averaged 19.1 points, 13.9 rebounds, and 6 assists last season, anchoring Sacramento’s offense through his elite passing and rebounding.Without him, head coach Doug Christie will likely rely on JaVale McGee, Harrison Barnes, and newcomer Russell Westbrook, who will face his former team for the first time in a Kings uniform. This makes for an intriguing subplot, as Westbrook looks to integrate into a rotation still searching for its identity without several of its core players.For the Los Angeles Lakers , the main storyline remains LeBron James and his ongoing recovery from sciatica. The 40-year-old superstar is sitting out tonight’s game as he prepares for what would be his 23rd NBA season. Team insiders have indicated that the Lakers are targeting a mid-November return, with a re-evaluation scheduled for October 30 to determine his progress.Los Angeles will also be without Jarred Vanderbilt (quad contusion) and Adou Thiero (knee), both of whom are expected to miss additional time. Bronny James and Austin Reaves are day-to-day, with Bronny recovering from an ankle issue and Reaves held out for rest. Deandre Ayton and Marcus Smart missed recent preseason outings for rest purposes, and their availability for tonight’s game remains uncertain.Under first-year head coach JJ Redick, the Lakers have endured a rocky preseason, entering tonight with a 1-4 record. However, Redick has used these games to experiment with rotations and build chemistry between Luka Doncic , Ayton, and Smart, hoping the trio can develop a cohesive two-way rhythm before the season begins.While the matchup won’t feature its usual star power, tonight’s game still holds importance for both franchises. For Sacramento, it’s an opportunity to test depth players such as Colby Jones and Nique Clifford, evaluating how they fit into the team’s long-term plans. The Los Angeles Lakers, on the other hand, will use this contest to fine-tune their core rotation, focusing on extended minutes for Doncic, Reaves, and Ayton as they gear up for their season opener against the Golden State Warriors.Given the number of absences - including Sabonis and LeBron - fans can expect a more experimental approach rather than a full-intensity contest. Still, for two Pacific Division rivals, even a preseason finale offers valuable insight into how their retooled rosters might perform once the regular season begins and everyone returns to full strength.Also read: Sacramento Kings vs Los Angeles Lakers preseasosn game preview, odds, prediction, best NBA prop bets, betting breakdown, and more (October 17, 2025) As the preseason curtain falls at Crypto.com Arena, both the Lakers and Kings will be more focused on recovery and readiness than results. With multiple stars sidelined and rotations still fluid, this final exhibition serves as a tune-up for the battles ahead.

Tennis star Jannik Sinner secured a commanding victory against Stefanos Tsitsipas in the quarter-final round of the Six Kings Slam exhibition tournament in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia , but the match witnessed a security incident when a fan breached protocol to approach the Italian.The defending champion needed only 76 minutes to defeat Tsitsipas, dropping just five games in a dominant performance that set up a semi-final clash with Novak Djokovic.The match itself proceeded smoothly until its conclusion when cameras captured an unauthorised spectator rushing onto the court to approach Sinner during his post-match interview.Sinner initially engaged with the individual, shaking hands and attempting conversation, before realising the person was not tournament staff but rather a fan who had managed to bypass security to request his jacket.The situation, while ultimately harmless, ended with security personnel physically removing the intruding fan from the court area.The incident has raised concerns about security standards at the high-profile exhibition event in Saudi Arabia, with tennis fans drawing parallels to the 1993 Monica Seles incident in Hamburg where she was stabbed by an attacker who breached court security.This marks the second recent security-related incident involving Sinner, following a similar occurrence at the US Open where a fan attempted to access his tennis bag while he was signing autographs.Sinner's performance on court demonstrated his continued strong form, showing no lingering effects from his recent withdrawal from the Shanghai Masters due to injury.","Jannik Sinner defeated Stefanos Tsitsipas in the quarter-final round of the Six Kings Slam exhibition tournament in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.

World No. 204 Valentin Vacherot from Monaco took the tennis world by storm on Saturday, defeating an ailing Novak Djokovic 6-3, 6-4 in the Shanghai Masters semi-finals. The 26-year-old qualifier overcame the 38-year-old Serbian, who struggled with vomiting, leg injuries, and fatigue under 31°C heat and 62 percent humidity, to book a spot in Sunday’s final against either his cousin Arthur Rinderknech or Daniil Medvedev.“I’m trying to pinch myself, is this real?” Vacherot said after his career-defining win. “To have Novak on the other side of the court was first of all an invaluable experience for me. I have a hundred feelings right now.”But who exactly is Valentin Vacherot? Tennis runs deep in his family. Born in 1998, he started playing at a young age and went on to play college tennis for Texas A&M University. Turning professional in 2022, he is coached by his half-brother Benjamin Balleret, who himself is the son of former players Bernard Balleret and Alexia Dechaume-Balleret. Tennis talent clearly runs in the family, as Vacherot’s cousin Arthur Rinderknech is also a former US Open pre-quarterfinalist.Vacherot first came into the spotlight by winning his maiden ATP Challenger title at the Nonthaburi Challenger in 2022. He made his Grand Slam debut last year at Roland Garros, becoming the first player from the Monegasque Tennis Federation to reach the main draw, though he lost in the first round to Alejandro Davidovich Fokina.Against Djokovic, Vacherot’s composure shone through. After Djokovic broke in the opening game, Vacherot immediately broke back. As Djokovic’s physical troubles worsened in the seventh game, requiring medical treatment and repeated stretches, Vacherot seized the moment, breaking again to take the first set with two aces. Despite a brief resistance from Djokovic in the second set, Vacherot held his nerve to serve out the match, denying Djokovic a chance at a fifth Shanghai Masters title.This remarkable victory cements Vacherot’s arrival on the big stage and marks a career-defining moment for the young Monegasque, whose journey from college tennis to shocking one of the sport’s greatest legends will be remembered for years to come.","Valentin Vacherot beats Novak Djokovic 6-3, 6-4 in the Shanghai Masters semi- finals.

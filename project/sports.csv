When Billie Jean King played - and beat - Bobby Riggs in the iconic Battle of the Sexes in 1973, women's tennis was struggling for relevance. The complexion of the sport is much different now. There is equal pay at all four majors. But back then it was different, with that win for Billie Jean King playing a crucial role in the formation of the Women's Tennis Association (WTA), the governing body for women's tennis. Unfortunately, the modern rendition of the Battle of the Sexes, between women's World No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka and men's World No. 671 Nick Kyrgios, was an own goal that hurt women's tennis and veered towards a circus act.Kyrgios, who has won just one competitive match since the end of 2022, triumphed 6-3, 6-3 against four-time grand slams winner Sabalenka with the likes of Ronaldo, Kaka, Peter Crouch and more celebrities watching on. Without getting into the men vs women biological debate, Kyrgios -- despite looking absolutely exhausted from the middle of the first set onward -- cantered to victory on the back of some nifty kick serves, lots of spin and more consistent groundstrokes.“It was a really tough match,” Kyrgios said in the on-court interview after. “She is a hell of a competitor. It could have gone either way.”From the very onset, the rules for the contest in Dubai were comical. In an attempt to level the playing field between Kyrgios, a former Wimbledon finalist, and Sabalenka, the Belarusian's side of the court was 9% smaller, and both players were limited to one serve per point.In practice, these rules looked bizarre. Sabalenka's shortened court, by 3.5 feet, meant she was standing well behind the baseline while serving, to make it resemble a regular court. Additionally, the court's proportions would have been challenging even for professional athletes, as was clear by Sabalenka's rising unforced error count.Sabalenka walked onto the court between the fans, with ""Eye of the Tiger"" playing in the background, wearing a silver sparkly jacket as if a WWE superstar entering the ring. Throughout the exhibition, she did entertain as one would expect of a WWE wrestler. She smiled, she laughed, and she did the Macarena during a time-out in the second set. On the tennis front, she looked uncomfortable against Kyrgios' choppy forehands, unconventional shotmaking and failed to capitalise on any momentum.This was suitable for those who have a passing interest in tennis and a couple of hours to waste. It won't be the 'Drive to Survive' moment for tennis. Even for an exhibition, this was a laughably poor idea from the beginning. Any attempts at converting the naysayers failed, despite what Kyrgios, Sabalenka and their management agency (both represented by Evolve) would like the rest of the world to believe.“This is a great stepping stone for the sport of tennis. Of course I was nervous. This was all the world was talking about for six months. Aryna was up for the challenge. I was under the pump there.”Sabalenka, despite the criticism that has come her way for weeks, insisted that she would like a rematch. “I felt great,” she said. “I feel I put on a great fight. He was struggling, he was getting really tired. I hit a lot of great shots. I really enjoyed the show. I feel like next time I play him, I know the tactics and his strengths and weaknesses.”Billie Jean King's high-stakes win against Riggs did more to help tennis than a regular match would have. It brought about equality, fairness and social justice for women's tennis. Fifty-two years later, Sabalenka's agreement to play this charade did more damage than good.""I was intrigued to see the battle of the sexes. It is a just an exhibition and pointless. Not sure this helps tennis. Kyrgios underarm serve, drop shot ,etc,"" posted former British No. 1 Greg Rusedski.Either way this contest went, it was destined to be a bad look for women's tennis. By manner of design, Sabalenka, and women's tennis by extension, were bound to be attacked by sexists and misogynists.""Women's tennis got EXPOSED in Dubai. Kyrgios (not even top 500 men) straight-sets Sabalenka 6-3 6-3, toyed with the ""World No.1"" like a child. Court rigged: his side smaller, one serve only, still demolished her.""Battle of the Sexes? More like a massacre. Reality doesn't lie,"" wrote one user on X.Another opined: ""What a crock. Kyrgios toying with Sabalenka on a heavily disadvantaged court to hit into, whilst he feeds her half-speed shots was an embarassment [sic]. What a horrible watch that was.""2025 was a stellar year for women's tennis. Sabalenka reached three of four major finals, winning one. Iga Swiatek, Coco Gauff, Amanda Anisimova, Elena Rybakina and Madison Keys all had great career arcs and women's tennis had many fascinating stories to tell. This attention-seeking, money-grabbing act shouldn't take away the sheen from that.",Nick Kyrgios beat Aryna Sabalenka in the Battle of the Sexes tennis match in Dubai. The match was an own goal that hurt women's tennis and veered towards a circus act. Billie Jean King's win against Bobby Riggs in 1973 helped form the WTA.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126219972,imgsize-30124,width-400,resizemode-4/aryna-sabalenka-bots-ap.jpg"

Smriti Mandhana opens up on 'love', World Cup win and more

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Indian openers Smriti Mandhana and Shafali Verma turned Thiruvananthapuram's Greenfield International Stadium into a spectacle on Sunday, blasting twin assaults before Richa Ghosh’s blistering 16-ball 40 provided the finishing flourish as India torpedoed to 221/2 — their highest WT20I total — after being asked to bat first.Yet the visitors refused to fold quietly. For the first time in the five-match series, Sri Lanka fought back, riding on Hasini Perera’s fearless 20-ball 33 and Chamari Athapaththu's authoritative 52 to put India under genuine pressure. The hosts were jolted out of their comfort zone, confronting resistance they hadn’t faced so far in the series.Despite the strong start, Sri Lanka found 222 beyond reach, falling short by 30 runs as India claimed a comprehensive 4-0 series lead.Imesha Dulani chipped in with 29 off 28, while Harshitha Samarawickrama began aggressively, slapping a six over midwicket off Shree Charani, before falling for 20. Kavisha Dilhari and Nilakshika Silva tried to stabilise, but India’s fielding lapses — four dropped catches and a missed stumping — meant Sri Lanka remained competitive for longer than expected.For India, the victory was orchestrated by their openers. On a night when Smriti’s bat finally found its familiar thunder, her return to form was briefly overshadowed by Shafali’s audacity.Chasing momentum rather than runs, India raced to 162 in 15.2 overs, courtesy an opening stand that was part power, part poetry. Shafali peppered the off side with crisp drives and cleared the infield at will, shellacking a 46-ball 79, underlining her fearless intent.Mandhana, after a lean run of 40 runs across three innings in the series, roared back with a 48-ball 80, timing the ball sweetly, finding gaps effortlessly, and punishing anything loose.Eleven fours and three towering sixes punctuated her measured, elegant innings, providing the melody to Shafali’s fireworks. By the time the openers walked off, India’s middle order, led by Richa and captain Harmanpreet Kaur, propelled the score past the 200 run-mark.The opening duo notched up the highest partnership in Indian women’s T20I history, eclipsing the 143-run stand against West Indies in 2019.“The conversation is simple,” Smriti said at the post-match presentation. “We just tell each other to watch the ball. We wanted to keep Shafali on strike, as she wanted to hit every ball for six.”",India beat Sri Lanka by 30 runs to take 4-0 series lead. Smriti Mandhana and Shafali Verma top score with 80 runs each.

NEW DELHI: Smriti Mandhana scored 80 and Shafali Verma made 79 as India posted their highest Women’s T20I total of 221 for two in the fourth match against Sri Lanka on Sunday.After batting second in each of the first three matches of the five-game series, India were asked to bat first this time. Mandhana and Shafali dominated the Sri Lanka bowlers at the Greenfield International Stadium and set the tone for a big total.Towards the end of the innings, Richa Ghosh hit an unbeaten 40 off 16 balls, while captain Harmanpreet Kaur scored 16 not out from nine deliveries to take India past 220.Mandhana and Shafali added 162 runs for the opening wicket in 15.2 overs. It is now the highest partnership for any wicket for India in women’s T20Is.This was also the fourth time the pair crossed the 100-run mark together. They went past their previous best stand of 143 against West Indies at Gros Islet in 2019.Mandhana also reached a major milestone, becoming only the fourth batter to complete 10,000 international runs across formats, after Mithali Raj, New Zealand’s Suzie Bates and England’s Charlotte Edwards.Shafali continued her strong run in the series, registering her third successive half-century.She missed out on her first T20I hundred and was dismissed in the 16th over, giving a return catch to Nimasha Meepage. Shafali scored 79 off 46 balls, hitting 12 fours and one six.Both openers relied on placement and timing rather than power, finding gaps regularly and scoring on both sides of the wicket.One of the notable moments came when Shafali stepped down the pitch to hit Kawya Kavindi over her head on the final ball of the fourth over. Earlier in the same over, Mandhana had struck two boundaries.Mandhana, who had a quiet series by her standards until this match, looked comfortable at the crease. Her innings included three sixes, all hit on the leg side, along with several drives.After the dismissals of Mandhana and Shafali, Richa Ghosh took charge. She hit four fours and three sixes and added 53 runs in an unbroken partnership for the third wicket with Harmanpreet Kaur as India crossed the 200-run mark.","Smriti Mandhana scored 80 and Shafali Verma made 79 as India posted 221 for two in the fourth match against Sri Lanka on Sunday.

Can Virat Kohli chase down Sachin Tendulkar's hundred hundreds?

Former India off-spinner R Ashwin praised Josh Tongue after the England pacer’s Player of the Match performance in the Melbourne Test, drawing from his own memories of playing county cricket alongside him.“I remember when I played county cricket in 2017 in Worcestershire, Josh Tongue had stress fracture issues,” Ashwin said on his YouTube channel. “He is able to produce those wicket-taking balls. Brydon Carse is a bit of an enforcer. If they are able to hold their lines for longer periods of time, they can create a good team. Also, the batting must have a bit of a thought. England can’t get themselves ahead and leave the game behind.”Ashwin also pointed out England’s recurring batting issues and the lack of control in key moments. “For instance, how Harry Brook bottled the game against India. In Perth, there was a small passage of play. They go for that brute force without any thought process. England have an upside if they can correct their bowling. They need to start producing a spinner from somewhere to hold an end up,” he added.Tongue backed up Ashwin’s assessment with a match-winning display at the MCG. He finished with seven wickets in the Test, including a five-wicket haul of 5/45 in the first innings and 2/44 in the second, earning him the Player of the Match award.Speaking after the game, Tongue described the moment as unforgettable. “It’s what dreams are made of. Obviously waking up on Boxing Day, a few nerves but yeah, to get a fifer and get my name on the honours board, it’s a very special feeling,” he said.Reflecting on his injury-hit journey, Tongue admitted how close he came to walking away from the game after rupturing his right pectoral muscle in 2023 and later suffering a hamstring injury. “100%. I was in a tough situation with my body and stuff. I was potentially retiring, but I’m glad that I put in the hard work to get myself back playing cricket and now playing for England, it’s all that I’ve always wanted to do,” he said.",Former India off-spinner R Ashwin praised Josh Tongue after the England pacer’s Player of the Match performance in the Melbourne Test.

Anrich Nortje press conference: 'Hopefully I get selected,' on T20 World Cup selection

Former Australia fast bowler Brett Lee said his focus from childhood was only on bowling at 160kmph, and personal records or big wickets did not matter to him as long as he reached that speed. Lee said he set this goal when he was nine years old and worked towards it throughout his career.Lee, now 49, has been inducted into Australian Cricket’s Hall of Fame. He said he devoted his life to this target and credited his mother, Helen, a former sprinter, for his genetics.""That (160kmph) means more to me than any wicket I've taken. Of course, the team comes first - to win the (2003) World Cup, the 16 straight Test wins, that's the pinnacle; that's why you play the game,"" Lee was quoted as saying by cricket.com.au.""But in terms of personal milestones, it wasn't wickets for me. Because I'd set my goal at such a young age to hit that 160(kph) barrier and to go past it … when you dream about something, you dedicate your life to achieving that dream, and it comes off, it's very special.""Lee finished his international career with 718 wickets across formats over two decades. He said his physical build and athletic ability helped him become a fast bowler.""For me, run-up was my most important asset. Then it was having a braced front leg. That's something you're either born with, or you're not, (and) that will allow you to get that speed through the crease. For me, that's something that came naturally - that part of my action took care of itself.""""And then you've got the front arm - the snap down of the left arm which created my pace; the quicker my left-arm came down, the quicker my right arm would follow,"" he added.Lee had earlier said that from the age of nine, his aim was to bowl fast. ""I got that enthusiasm and that really good vibe out of seeing the stumps either break or be knocked over.""Lee crossed the 160kmph mark twice in international cricket. The first instance came during the 2003 World Cup in South Africa, when he bowled a 160.1kmph delivery to dismiss Sri Lanka’s Marvan Atapattu in the semifinal.""At that stage we were under a bit of pressure (defending 212), and needed the best out of me. And that was to just steam in and bowl as quick as I could on a good length... looking up (at the scoreboard) and seeing I went past 160(kmph) was a pretty special moment,"" he recalled.His fastest recorded delivery was clocked at 160.8kmph during the fifth ODI against New Zealand in Napier on March 5, 2005.""It's quite ironic, I felt my fittest when I bowled my quickest ball (160.8kph) in Napier against the Kiwis, but that was a time when I ended up spending 18 months out of the Test team,"" he said.""That was when I felt like I probably should've been in, but if you look at the attack we had... there were a number of guys putting their hand up and taking wickets. Looking back, I felt like I was raring to go, but I couldn't get the nod.""Lee said that period was difficult, but he stayed focused.“That was hard to take, but I had to get on with it - I had to suck it up. And I knew I just had to keep bowling fast, keep taking wickets in one-day cricket, and the opportunity would present itself.""Lee described himself as someone who did not step back under pressure.""For me, there are two styles of people. There's one that, when the pressure's on, they'll run and hide. Or there's the other style where you think as an athlete: ‘This is what I'm built for’.""And I look to go the second option: ‘This is the moment that you want’. Now, whether or not you win, lose or draw, it doesn't matter. It's the moment that you want to be involved in,"" he said.","Former Australia fast bowler Brett Lee said his focus from childhood was only on bowling at 160kmph.

Knock, knock!AN OVAL CUPWho is gonna take away the World Cup? Your guess is as good as ours but we are willing to bet our bottom dollar on a certain Mr. Doland... sorry, Donald Trump. This is the closest an American will perhaps ever get to the trophy, and the recent renovation at the White House suggests there will be a new Oval Office to go with it. The Club World Cup may be already there. Winners Chelsea lifted a replica – Trump wanted to steal their celebration too but Cole & Co. were too clever to let him take the limelight. Replicas are as good as it gets – the original is safe at the FIFA HQ in Zurich.PARIS FINDS ITS MATCHOoh la la! PSG’s success story in 2025 is one to behold -- How Luis Enrique rebooted the continent’s nearly men into European champions with discipline, teamwork, tactics, belief while deleting the individualist approach.All for one and one for all, Luis’ musketeers reeled in trophy after trophy but there was one battle PSG lost, to former talisman Kylian Mbappe, in the boardroom and the courtroom. In this sabre fencing, Paris employed the slashing technique, cutting off the Frenchman’s salary that included a so-called ‘ethics bonus’. Mad in Madrid, Mbappe’s riposte was of the legal kind. After the back and forth, the court ruled that the former employers pay up unpaid wages of 60m euros. Back in Spain, Mbappe earned some Real love from the Bernabeu faithful, after scoring 59 goals in 59 games, equaling his ‘hero’ Cristiano Ronaldo’s record, the most in a calendar year. How did he celebrate it? Siuuuuu…NO FAN’S LANDThe Big Leagues’ global expansion was put on hold. La Liga president Javier Tebas’ plan to ‘host’ a league match between Barcelona and Villarreal in Miami 7,500-km away from the shores of Spain was cancelled. The league had also chartered planes to take around 2,000 to 3,000 Villarreal fans to the US of A. In Oct, there were league-wide protests, stopping active play to express displeasure. Ultimately, Tebas had to bow down as organisers pulled out. Last week, a high-profile plan to stage a Serie A match -- AC Milan vs. Como -- in Perth was scrapped.DIAMONDS ARE FOREVEROne of the most viral pics of 2025 was of Georgina Rodriguez’s oversized diamond engagement ring reported to be valued between $2 and 5m, the kind of flashy display that one can associate with her fiancé Cristiano Ronaldo. Off the pitch, he definitely glittered.On it, the Portuguese became the top scorer in the history of the World Cup qualifiers with 41 goals with a brace against Hungary.Hours later, in his current home Miami, Lionel Messi was not to be surpassed with his double assist for Argentina against Puerto Rico making him the supreme provider in internationals with 59, beating Neymar’s record.While their club lives in the Saudi Pro League and MLS are at the fringes of people’s interests, the legends are at the forefront of our consciousness. The kind of fanfare and chaos that followed Messi on his whirlwind India tour is proof of that. Please save the last dance for the World Cup finals.END OF DREAMS‘How many times did we say: Just bring Jota on’ was a striking tribute to the very likeable Diogo Jota at Liverpool’s Anfield ground, after a tragic car crash in Zamora stole the lives of the Portuguese and his brother Andre Silva. Manager Slot said he was looking for Jota on the bench when the scoreline was 2-2 against Bournemouth. Salah won it that day, and the tears flowed.Since then, fortunes have taken a different turn for both Liverpool and Mo. After promising and delivering a record-equalling 20th league title in April, ‘the Egyptian king’ found himself on the sidelines, and an outburst against club and gaffer, left him on the brink of an exit as he proceeded to AFCON duty with his legacy under threat and a question mark over his return.In Spain, close on the heels of a successful Euro campaign, Lamine Yamal finds himself ostracized -- from ‘wonderkid’ to ‘bad loser’, with his moves scrutinized in public by a damning jealous social media. His alleged infidelity, luxurious lifestyle, outspoken statements, athletic pubalgia have all been discussed at length.

Ryan Rickelton press conference: 'Been tough last couple of months mentally in India'

Florian Wirtz's first Liverpool goal fired the Reds into the Premier League 's top four despite an unconvincing 2-1 win over Wolves on a day both clubs paid tribute to Diogo Jota . Jota, who was killed in a car accident alongside his brother Andre Silva in July, won four trophies after joining Liverpool from Wolves in 2020.Two of his children led the teams out as mascots, while his wife Rute Cardoso watched on from the sidelines.Both sets of fans sang chants in Jota's name in the 18th and 20th minutes -- the shirt numbers he wore during his spells at Molineux and Anfield respectively.""After the tragedy happened until now, I have seen so many special moments -- where the fans remembered him or our players conducted themselves unbelievably in the circumstances,"" said Liverpool boss Arne Slot.""Not only our fans but the fans of away teams have shown the respect both Diogo and his brother deserved. It was special to see his children being the mascot and how emotional it was before the game and then in the 20th minute.""On the field, both clubs have suffered this season with Wolves staring down the barrel of relegation after taking just two points from their opening 18 league games.Liverpool's form has improved of late and Wirtz is beginning to show flashes of the brilliance that lured the English champions into paying Bayer Leverkusen £100 million ($135 million) for the German international.The 22-year-old registered his first Premier League assist last weekend for a goal that came at some cost to Liverpool as Alexander Isak suffered a broken leg in opening the scoring against Tottenham.Shorn of the most expensive player in English football history for the coming months, there is even more pressure on Wirtz to deliver on his hefty price tag.""He's been very important for us throughout the season. But in football it is about results, you are mainly judged on results or on goals and assists,"" added Slot.""I think today he showed much more than just the goal he scored; he was special for us in many parts of the game.""Wirtz finally opened his account in his 23rd Liverpool appearance by prodding home Hugo Ekitike's pass to double the home side's lead.Just 90 seconds earlier, Liverpool had made the breakthrough when Ryan Gravenberch slammed in Jeremie Frimpong's cross.Yet, even with a 2-0 half-time lead against a side on course to become the worst in Premier League history, Slot could not relax.Santiago Bueno exposed Liverpool's frailty from set-pieces to pull a goal back just six minutes into the second half.Slot's men have made a habit of late collapses at Leeds and Tottenham in recent weeks and needed a perfectly-timed tackle from Conor Bradley to deny Jhon Arias a late equaliser.","Liverpool beat Wolves 2-1 in Premier League.

This year, most scrambled to check the Google Maps to find Curacao when the smallest-ever nation, in terms of population and size, qualified for next year’s mammoth World Cup 2026. With 155,000 inhabitants, the Caribbean island was guided to the top tier by Dick Advocaat, the former Rangers and PSV boss who has also worked with eight national teams including his native Netherlands (1992-94).Sebastian Migne never set foot on Haiti, another Caribbean nation, because international flights do not land there. They played all their World Cup home qualifiers in Curacao, some 500 miles across the sea.These football stories are the brightest beacon of 2025. In contrast, the darkness around Indian football seems to have grown deeper, unfathomable, with no light at the end of the tunnel.The year gone by has seen All India Football Federation officials spend more time making rounds of the courts than the national team spent on the field.It might delight a research scholar to know that AIFF has presented itself to the Supreme Court 16 times and counting.The national team has played only 12 matches. None of it, though, will bring cheer to the fans.Never since Independence has Indian football slipped into such a deep abyss. For the first time since 1996, when the national league was begun by then-AIFF president Priya Ranjan Das Munshi, it has stalled.One can say with a heavy heart that the league is an orphan now.The sponsorship ran out. The new occupants of Football House, who took charge in 2022, were aware of the matter. But the negotiations just refused to yield any money, assurance, or hope.Since 2010, the AIFF received Rs 50 crore every year from Football Sports Development Limited (FSDL), a Reliance Industries subsidiary, as part of an agreement. The 15-year contract ran out on Dec 8.It was obvious to all, except those in Football House, that no one wants to waste money to keep Indian football – once called a sleeping giant by Sepp Blatter just over a decade and a half ago – alive and awake.Till reports last came in, the AIFF plans to start the elite league around Feb 7-8 after presenting a 20-year plan to the ISL clubs. In accordance with the constitution, the league will be owned and operated by the AIFF and will “implement the principles of promotion and relegation.”“I am convinced we can start the league and then work out a long-term solution,” said IFA secy Anirban Dutta, a member of the committee to resolve the ISL crisis.All year, the stakeholders went into hair-splitting debates and nuanced offerings but the outcome, sadly, has been zero. Even a few clubs had temporarily stopped paying salaries to the players. There has been a frustrating sense of ennui.Last heard, there was some warmth shown by the beleaguered clubs towards the AIFF’s proposals. The format for a truncated league is expected to be confirmed in the year’s final week.Add to it the dismal performance of the national team. Hours after India lost to Bangladesh in their last Asian Cup qualification engagement, Haiti’s ticket to the World Cup sent euphoric shock waves around the world. To watch India’s matches this year, under coaches Manolo Marquez and Khalid Jamil, was like visiting the dentist with a severe toothache.The Indian senior men’s team failed to qualify for the 2027 AFC Asian Cup, which means no competitive football until at least Nov 2027. That is nearly three years without meaningful matches. One wonders what will be Khalid Jamil’s work schedule now?One question keeps haunting, though. If Curacao are able to hire the services of a world-renowned coach like Advocaat, why could India, claimed to be the fourth-largest economy in the world, never reach beyond the Manolos and the Stimacs and the Koevermans? One can keep waiting for an answer but there will only be silence from the All India Football Federation.Following some creditable performances against Bahrain (2-0) and Brunei (6-0), U-23 coach Naushad Moosa got stuck in Doha. Not one to be easily perturbed, even by the sudden bombing of the Qatari capital, Moosa showered rousing praise on the boys. But his enthusiasm was laced with bleakness.“What’s next for the boys? They will go back to their clubs and warm the bench. They won’t be getting any minutes,” he had said in Sept. With the U-17s, Bibiano Fernandes also made headlines by helping the boys cross the Asian Cup qualification hurdles.Repeating himself, Moosa confirmed his apprehensions in Dec. “Nothing is happening. The players too are sadly cooling their heels.” And we couldn’t but recall the days not too long ago, when the AIFF had to put a cap of 45 matches on the national team players.One may point out that these are silver linings. If so, then why can’t Manolo or Jamil do without Sunil Chhetri , India’s weather-beaten warhorse who is past 40? The striker had to break his retirement vows and don the India shirt again, confirming that Indian football’s cupboard is starkly bare.The year 2025 will stay in memory as the lowest point in Indian football.LEAGUE UNCERTAINTY: It’s the end of December, half-time in most football seasons, a time when clubs redraw their strategies, depending on the progress they’ve made in the league. This year, nothing. Indian football has never seen anything like this. There’s no word on the top tier ISL or the I-League, because the AIFF has simply failed to find a commercial partner. Everything’s at a standstill: clubs have paused first team operations, players have stopped training and many foreigners plan to move elsewhere once the transfer window opens on Jan 1. One club has told players they will have to “forego salaries” for months and they’d be “happy to resume payments” only from the date of restart.CAMPS WITHOUT PLAYERS: National team camps often kicked off without half the players. Coach Khalid Jamil wanted more time with the boys, but clubs refused to release players outside the FIFA international windows. It was no different for U-23 assignments. The trust deficit between the two parties has grown so much that Mohun Bagan SG, who have the maximum players at national camps, even accused the federation of negligence over the handling of their captain Subhashish Bose.MONUMENTAL FAILURE: In the 15 months between May 2024 and August 2025, the national team had three coaches — Igor Stimac, Manolo Marquez, Khalid Jamil — none of whom could ensure that India makes it to the AFC Asian Cup, the country’s first failure since the tournament was expanded to accommodate 24 teams. In the final round of qualifiers, India were the highest-ranked side but finished at the bottom, unable to register a single win and in five matches, scoring just twice. The defeat to Bangladesh in Dhaka, the first in 22 years, rankled the most.THE BIG EXIT: The City Football Group’s exit from Mumbai City FC was probably the biggest reflection of the mess that is Indian football. CFG, the world’s leading private owner and operator of 13 clubs, including Manchester City, had joined hands with Mumbai City with much fanfare. Their decision to divest its shareholding in the club is a huge blow. The reason: “CFG made this decision following a comprehensive commercial review and in light of the ongoing uncertainty surrounding the future of the Indian Super League (ISL). ”BUT, A SILVER LINING: The women’s team provided joy in an otherwise grim state. The senior team defied the odds to defeat World Cuppers Thailand and qualify for the AFC Asian Cup. The U-17 and U-20 teams also left India with three continental competitions to play for in the opening months of 2026. At club level, East Bengal’s SAFF Club Championship triumph and a first group stage win in the AFC Women’s Champions League brought cheer.UNDER MANOLO MARQUEZUNDER KHALID JAMILIndia won Bronze Medal at CAFA Nations CupTOTAL MATCHES: 11India Won: 3India Lost: 5Drawn: 3Goals Scored: 8Goals Conceded: 12","Indian football has slipped into such a deep abyss.

Rayan Cherki steals the show as Manchester City edge Nottingham Forest to go top of the Premier League,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/rayan-cherki-steals-the-show-as-manchester-city-edge-nottingham-forest-to-go-top-of-the-premier-league/articleshow/126206283.cms,"Manchester City's Rayan Cherki celebrates with Erling Haaland (Barrington Coombs/PA via AP)

Rayan Cherki delivered another decisive statement of his growing influence at Manchester City as his late strike secured a 2-1 Premier League win over Nottingham Forest and lifted Pep Guardiola’s side to the top of the table on Saturday.The France international was at the heart of everything City did well at the City Ground. After setting up Tijjani Reijnders for the opening goal early in the second half, Cherki returned in the closing stages to fire home the winner, capping a standout display that underlined his importance to City’s title push.City had to weather sustained pressure from Forest, who matched Guardiola’s men for large spells and were level soon after falling behind. Omari Hutchinson, scoring his first goal for the club, punished a rare City mistake to bring the home side back into the contest and briefly threaten another memorable result against the champions.Guardiola’s team eventually found a way through, extending their winning run to eight matches in all competitions and six straight league victories. The result moved City one point clear of Arsenal, although the Gunners could reclaim top spot later in the day with a home win over Brighton.Before kick-off, Forest paid tribute to club legend John Robertson, who passed away on Christmas Day at the age of 72. The former Scotland winger was a central figure in Forest’s back-to-back European Cup triumphs in 1979 and 1980, and his flair and end product were fondly remembered by the City Ground crowd.Cherki, who joined City from Lyon in the summer, appears to share that same blend of creativity and cutting edge. At just 22, he has quickly become a key figure in Guardiola’s side and, should City edge Arsenal to the title, his contribution is likely to be pivotal.Guardiola had set a stern tone over the festive period, warning his players against excess and making it clear that fitness standards would not be compromised. He even cancelled a planned rest day after last weekend’s win over West Ham. When asked about his squad’s condition, Guardiola joked that he was the only one who had put on weight.Despite that discipline, City looked flat before the break and Forest had the better chances. Morgan Gibbs-White went close after meeting a Callum Hudson-Odoi cross, while City struggled to impose themselves. Erling Haaland, who has 19 league goals by Christmas, the joint-most at this stage in Premier League history, was largely kept quiet.The visitors finally found their rhythm just after the interval. Cherki drifted inside and slipped a clever pass to Reijnders, who finished calmly from 12 yards for City’s first shot on target. Cherki then tested goalkeeper John Victor with a fierce effort moments later.Forest responded swiftly. Reijnders lost possession near his own area, allowing Gibbs-White to release Igor Jesus, whose cross was drilled home by Hutchinson from close range. With City wobbling, Neco Williams forced Gianluigi Donnarumma into a save before Nicolo Savona blazed over from the rebound.The decisive moment arrived in the 83rd minute. A loose ball fell to Cherki just inside the box and the Frenchman lashed an unstoppable finish past Victor. He celebrated by mimicking Haaland’s trademark calm pose in front of the travelling supporters.It was a fitting end to a performance that highlighted why Cherki is fast becoming one of Guardiola’s most trusted match-winners as City continue their relentless pursuit of another Premier League crown.",Manchester City beat Nottingham Forest 2-1 at the City Ground.

The All India Football Federation (AIFF) on Friday proposed a new structure for the Indian Super League (ISL), under which the league would be owned and operated by the national body in accordance with its new constitution for the next 20 seasons.According to the new proposal the AIFF formulated after a meeting with the ISL clubs, the league will implement a promotion and relegation system from the upcoming season. Each season will be calculated from June 1 to May 31 of the next year.""We have sent the proposal to the clubs, we have to wait for their response in the next couple of days before finalising our plan,"" an AIFF source told PTI.""Let the clubs respond, we will try to find a solution after hearing them.""It is expected that the AIFF and the clubs will have two more rounds of meetings -- one on Sunday and the other on Monday.If all goes well, the ISL season may start in the first week of February, according to the source.According to the proposal, the ISL will have a predetermined 'Central Operational Budget' for every year that would come from yearly contributions from all 'revenue share holders' proportionate to their revenue share in the league.""This would be known as the 'League Membership Contribution'. Any operational expenses required for the league to be conducted and for clubs to comply with their applicable licensing criteria with the addition of prize money distribution would be capped and borne out of this budget,"" the proposal said.""Governance would be overseen by a Board that would be empowered by the AIFF general body with certain operational autonomy over commercial matters of the League. The jurisdiction of the board would be limited to the utilisation of unrestricted funds within the yearly operational budget earmarked for the same.""Each club, under the proposal, will pay the AIFF a 'standard participating fee' of Rs 1 crore a year at the beginning of the season. This would, however, be independent of any calculations of the 'Central Operating Expenditure'.""This amount would be fully reimbursable from the central revenue prior to distribution of 'Net Revenue'. The total participation fee for all clubs would be put at 20% of the 'central operational budget' of the League. In case the Board decides to raise the 'central operational budget' by 10% in the future, the 'standard participation fee' would proportionately increase.""Any profit, or savings from the operational budget, will be distributed equally amongst all revenue shareholders in proportion to the respective revenue shares.On December 20, a proposal from 10 ISL clubs for ""perpetual"" operational and commercial ownership of the country's top-tier competition failed to get the approval of the AIFF's General Body, which formed a committee to look into the matter.The AIFF panel was tasked with holding discussions with representatives of five clubs - Chennaiyin FC, Mumbai City FC, Delhi Sporting Club, NorthEast United FC and Mohun Bagan Super Giant from December 22 to 29.Under the AIFF's proposal, the total outlay of the first season of the ISL will be Rs 70 crore with the AIFF's revenue share pegged at 10 per cent (that is Rs 7 crore) in the first season, while 50 per cent (Rs 35 crore) will come from the clubs -- 14 as of now unless there is any pull out.But interestingly, a revenue share of 30 per cent has been reserved for a potential commercial partner. The AIFF is yet to get a commercial partner as it did not receive any bid after a tender was floated on the supervision of a Supreme Court-appointed committee under a retired SC judge.Though the AIFF has included a 30 per cent revenue share for a potential commercial partner in the proposal, it is learnt that since the number of matches this season could be less than earlier years, the ISL can be run with a 'central operating budget' of less than the proposed Rs 70 crore.",The All India Football Federation (AIFF) has proposed a new structure for the Indian Super League (ISL) The league would be owned and operated by the national body in accordance with its new constitution for the next 20 seasons.

RABAT: Organisers at the Africa Cup of Nations in Morocco are allowing supporters in for free after kick-off in matches where stadiums are not full, a Confederation of African Football source told AFP.The Group F game between Cameroon and Gabon on Wednesday in Agadir kicked off in front of almost empty stands but the ground filled up significantly over the course of the first half despite incessant rain.The official attendance was later announced as 35,200 inside a venue which can hold over 45,000.There have been similar scenes at numerous matches across the opening days of the competition, even leading to confusion over the attendance figures themselves.The crowd at Tuesday's Group D encounter between the Democratic Republic of Congo and Benin at Rabat's Al Medina Stadium -- which filled up considerably over the course of the game -- was initially announced as 6,703 before later being corrected to 13,073.The CAF source indicated that organisers, in agreement with African football's governing body, were opening stands around 20 minutes into games to allow fans gathered outside to enter without paying.Filling stadiums is an important issue for Cup of Nations organisers in Morocco, for which a successful hosting of the tournament is key as it builds towards the 2030 World Cup to be jointly held in the North African country, Spain and Portugal.CAF's official ticketing platform on Thursday showed seats available for almost all remaining group matches for prices starting at 100 dirhams ($10.96).The only matches shown as sell-outs were hosts Morocco's games against Mali on Friday and Zambia on Monday, as well as Algeria against Burkina Faso on Sunday and Algeria versus Equatorial Guinea next Wednesday.","Africa Cup of Nations organisers are allowing supporters in for free after kick- off in matches where stadiums are not full.

Where did it all go wrong for Indian football?

FC Goa players made a strong statement during their AFC Champions League 2 match against FC Istiklol by staging a silent protest before kick-off on Wednesday at the Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium.As the referee blew the whistle for kick-off, the FC Goa players staged the pre-planned protest and did not play for a few seconds.The protest was aimed at highlighting the “deepening uncertainty” that is affecting the Indian football ecosystem.Issues related to administration and commercial matters have caused major delays around top-tier domestic football competitions like the Indian Super League and the I-League.Players, coaches, and staff across clubs are feeling the impact of this situation.Soon after the incident, FC Goa released a statement on social media to explain their action.“This action was solely intended to draw attention to the broader challenges facing the domestic football ecosystem,” the club said in an official statement.FC Goa also made it clear that the protest was not against their opponents or the Asian Football Confederation.Instead, it was meant to show the frustration and concern felt by those involved in Indian football, who are unsure about the future of the game in the country.On the field, FC Goa started well despite the tense backdrop. The home team took the lead in the eighth minute when Dejan Drazic found space inside the box and scored with a fine curling shot into the top corner.In the second half, Istiklol made a strong comeback. A defensive mistake allowed Paul Komolafe to score the equaliser in the 53rd minute.Just three minutes later, another error led to a penalty, which Amirbek Juraboev converted to put the visitors ahead.FC Goa tried hard to score an equaliser, but their efforts did not succeed.Istiklol held on to win 2-1.

NEW DELHI: Indian football remained in a state of terminal decline after experiencing arguably its darkest phase in a year marked by severe administrative crisis, court hearings, financial issues, absence of domestic leagues, and a steep decline in performance of the senior men's team.As the year drew to a close, the high-profile Lionel Messi GOAT India Tour generated some interest and forced a conversation around the sport.The much-publicised event did what it was meant to, and was not supposed to serve as a catalyst for real improvement in Indian football.If its own problems were not enough, the chaos and absolute disorder at Salt Lake Stadium on the first day of the Messi tour added to the embarrassment.While the breakdown of law and order in the 'Mecca of Indian football' was not good advertisement, the remaining three legs in Hyderabad, Mumbai and Delhi were well organised.Of the many disappointments, one on-field moment that still stings came when little-known Bangladeshi midfielder Sheikh Morsalin darted into the box and slipped the ball between the legs of Gurpreet Singh Sandhu with a delicate touch, completing another round of humiliation.The 11th minute strike, in an inconsequential 2027 AFC Asian Cup qualifying match on a November evening in Dhaka, meant the Indian senior men's team suffered its first defeat to Bangladesh in 22 years, after having struggled through the last 12 months to produce a result of any significance.While several factors contribute to a country's overall football ecosystem, globally the senior team's performance is often the most visible metric, and India was found severely wanting on that front.Unlike in 2024, when the team drew a blank in international matches, the Indian senior men's side did manage to churn out a few wins occasionally this year, including a bronze medal finish at the CAFA Nations Cup in the central Asian countries of Tajikistan and Uzbekistan in September.But, in the matches that mattered the most, India failed to deliver and could not qualify for the Asian Cup for the first time since the 2011 edition, following which the team plummeted further in the FIFA rankings.Besides Bangladesh, the team also suffered defeats to other lower-ranked opponents such as Hong Kong and Singapore, a 1-2 loss to whom dashed its hopes of entering the Asian Cup following a disappointing campaign in the Qualifications.While the men's team struggled on the field, especially when it came to scoring goals, the administrators grappled with issues off it.The game remained in the middle of a crisis due to the All India Football Federation's failure to secure a new commercial partner for the Indian Super League after its previous contract with the Reliance-owned Football Sports Development Limited (FSDL) expired on December 8.On expected lines, the lack of a commercial partner has had a crippling effect on the game. The ISL, which would have been into its third month now under normal circumstances, remains on hold.The sponsors are pulling out, clubs have put their operations on hold, players are staring at an uncertain future, after having implored each and every stakeholder to resolve the issue, and serious doubts hover over the domestic leagues' future.The ongoing crisis has highlighted a systemic failure in the country's football ecosystem brought about by poor governance, lack of long-term vision and the absence of proper youth development programmes.The year was also marked by frequent hearings at the Supreme Court and intervention from the union sports ministry to resolve the crisis. Even President Droupadi Murmu asked the stakeholders of Indian football to work together for the upliftment of the game in the country, reflecting the severity of the situation.When the Supreme Court approved the draft Constitution of the AIFF, prepared by former apex court judge L Nageswara Rao, in September, it was believed that a solution amenable to all concerned parties would finally be arrived at.However, no such thing happened in the ensuing months.Amid the gloom surrounding the sport, the women's national teams and the junior squads have impressed with their performances, raising hopes of a better future. In Chiang Mai, Thailand in July, the women's team scripted history by qualifying directly for the AFC Women's Asian Cup 2026, a feat never achieved before.Up against regional heavyweights and hosts Thailand in the final, the Indian women rode on Sangita Basfore's brilliant brace to emerge winners and make a statement of sorts. The achievement reminded one of former AIFF president Praful Patel's old statement that chances of the Indian women's team playing in a FIFA World Cup before their male counterparts are higher.While the girls still have a long way to go, they are definitely moving in the right direction.In another milestone, Indian Women's League reigning champions East Bengal FC became the first team from the country to win a main-draw match in the AFC Women's Champions League, helping the side earn a direct spot in the league stages of the next edition.As far as the junior teams were concerned, the India squad lifted its seventh SAFF U-17 Championship title in Sri Lanka, edging out Bangladesh in a dramatic final that went to penalties after a 2-2 stalemate.Under the guidance of Bibiano Fernandes, India then shocked continental giants Iran 2-1 to qualify for their 10th U-17 Asian Cup finals, even as the struggle to monetise the sport continued without a solution in sight.",Indian football remained in a state of terminal decline after experiencing arguably its darkest phase in a year marked by severe administrative crisis. The game remained in the middle of a crisis due to the All India Football Federation's failure to secure a new commercial partner for the Indian Super League.

The return of war

A story that lives on

On Christmas morning in 1914, something happened that no military plan could have predicted and no weapon could have forced. In the middle of World War I , one of the bloodiest conflicts in human history, soldiers laid down their guns and stepped out of their trenches. And what did they do? They ended up playing football.For a few precious hours, war made way for humanity. This moment, now known as the Christmas Truce, remains one of the most powerful stories ever told about football and peace.Fought between the Allied Powers, backed by France, Britain, Russia, later joined by the US, Italy, and Japan, and the Central Powers, led by Germany, Austria-Hungary, the Ottoman Empire, and Bulgaria, World War I had erupted in the summer of 1914.Europe was torn apart as nations rushed into battle with confidence and somewhat misplaced optimism.Many soldiers believed the war would be short.“Home by Christmas,” they said.Instead, by December, the war had stalled into a brutal deadlock. Soldiers on both sides were trapped in muddy trenches across Belgium and northern France.Life there was unbearable. Freezing cold, constant shelling, disease, hunger, and fear became daily companions.Young men, many of whom were barely out of school, faced death every hour.Christmas was approaching, but joy felt impossible.On the night of December 24, something strange happened along parts of the Western Front. British soldiers heard singing coming from the German trenches.At first, they suspected a trick. But the tune was unmistakable. The Germans were singing Christmas carols.“Stille Nacht”, which translates to Silent Night in English, floated gently through the cold air. British troops replied with their own songs.Soon, laughter replaced gunfire. Shouts of “Merry Christmas!” crossed no man’s land, the deadly strip of ground that usually meant instant death.Against all logic, the blazing sounds of gunfire went silent.As dawn broke on Christmas Day, soldiers cautiously climbed out of their trenches. Hands raised. No weapons. No orders. No one fired.British and German soldiers met in the middle. They shook hands. They smiled awkwardly. They exchanged cigarettes, chocolate, buttons, badges, and even small gifts sent from home.Photographs of loved ones were shown. Stories were shared. For the first time, soldiers saw the faces of the men they had been told to hate. They discovered something shocking. The enemy looked just like them.Then came the football. In some places, it was a proper leather football. In others, it was a bundle of rags tied together. It didn’t matter. There were no goalposts, no referee, no rules. Hwever, soldiers marked goals with caps or coats. Their boots were heavy, and the ground was frozen and uneven. But they couldn't care less.British soldiers kicked the ball with German soldiers. Scores were kept loosely, if at all.Some accounts claim the Germans won one match 3–2. Others say the result didn’t matter, because the real victory was simply playing.Soldiers used the calm to recover bodies that had been lying in no man’s land for weeks. Joint burial services were held. Prayers were said together.Men who would soon be ordered to kill each other stood side by side in silence.Many later wrote letters home describing how surreal it felt.One British soldier wrote that it seemed “too wonderful to be real.” Another admitted he struggled afterwards to fire at men he had just shared laughter with.The Christmas Truce was never officially approved. High-ranking officers were furious when they learned what had happened. To them, the truce threatened discipline and the will to fight.Orders were quickly sent down the line. By December 26, the guns roared again. The war resumed its brutal course. Many of the men who played football that day would be killed in the months that followed.For years, the Christmas Truce was pushed aside. Military leaders feared it showed too much humanity in war. Some reports were censored. Others were ignored. But stories have a way of surviving.Letters were found in attics. Diaries were published. Veterans spoke quietly of that day when the war stopped making sense. Slowly, the truth emerged.Football already belonged to everyone in 1914. It was played in England, Germany, France, and beyond. It needed no shared language. No explanation. You just kicked the ball.That simplicity made football powerful. It reminded soldiers of home. Of weekends. Of joy. Of life before the trenches.Football did not end the war. But it proved that hatred was learned, and humanity was natural.Today, more than a century later, the Christmas Truce is remembered across the football world. Memorial matches are held. Statues stand near former battlefields. Clubs and fans share the story every December.Because on Christmas Day in 1914, football did something extraordinary. It reminded the world that before we are soldiers, enemies, or nations, we are human beings. And sometimes, a simple game is enough to make us remember that.","In the middle of World War I, soldiers laid down their guns and stepped out of their trenches.

Drake Maye leads Patriots resurgence with authority and style



Drake Maye’s wife Ann Michael (Insyagram)

Drake Maye has quickly become the heartbeat of a New England Patriots revival that suddenly feels familiar to longtime fans. The franchise is back atop the AFC East, powered by a young quarterback playing with rare calm and command. Saturday’s dominant win, paired with a Buffalo stumble, reshaped the division race and put Foxborough back in control. For a fan base craving signs of a new era, the message felt clear and confident.The surge is not only about wins. It is about how they are happening. Precision passes, fast decisions, and a rhythm that keeps defenses guessing.On December 28, 2025, at MetLife Stadium, Drake Maye delivered a performance that turned heads across the league. He completed 17 of 19 passes for 229 yards and four touchdowns before halftime, spreading the ball with ease. Austin Hooper, Rhamondre Stevenson, Stefon Diggs, and Hunter Henry all reached the end zone.That first-half explosion carried historic weight. It marked the first time a Patriots quarterback threw four touchdown passes before halftime since Tom Brady did it in 2014 against the Chicago Bears. Brady’s name still defines excellence in New England, and this milestone naturally invites comparison.Brady set the standard more than a decade ago. Maye is now carving his own path, one calm drive at a time.Drafted third overall in 2024 out of North Carolina, Maye has elevated his play in his second season. His accuracy and pocket awareness stand out, and league chatter now places him in early MVP discussions alongside established veterans. The Patriots remain in contention for the AFC’s top seed, needing a home win over Miami and help from Denver.Away from the huddle, Ann Michael Maye has become a fan favorite in her own right. Her baking videos, especially “Bakemas,” have drawn loyal followers, while her winter game-day looks continue to turn heads. Together, the couple reflects a franchise rediscovering confidence, balance, and belief. For New England, the future suddenly feels very present.Also Read: Patriots celebrate AFC East title return while Drake Maye’s breakout season draws Tom Brady comparisons","Drake Maye has quickly become the heartbeat of a New England Patriots revival.

What is Brock Purdy's net worth and contract details



Brock Purdy's endorsements and all you need to know



Brock Purdy did not arrive in the NFL with hype, headlines, or guarantees. He arrived with questions. Drafted last and labeled “Mr. Irrelevant,” he entered a league that rarely waits for late bloomers. Yet in San Francisco, opportunity met preparation. Purdy guided the 49ers with poise beyond his years. By his second season, he was no longer a stopgap but a centerpiece, steering a Super Bowl-caliber roster and reshaping how teams view draft pedigree. His rise has become one of the league’s most compelling modern success stories.Brock Purdy’s net worth reflects a career that accelerated fast but started modestly. His estimated net worth stands at $20 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth. That number trails elite quarterbacks who signed massive deals early, yet context matters. Purdy entered the league on a rookie contract that barely hinted at his eventual value.Everything changed in the 2025 offseason. Purdy signed a five-year contract worth $265 million with San Francisco, including $181 million guaranteed. The deal placed him among the highest-paid quarterbacks in football and signaled full organizational belief.His average annual salary of $53 million ranked seventh at the time, a remarkable leap for a player who once earned less than two percent of that amount annually.The contract also includes a full no-trade clause, a rare sign of security for any quarterback. It reflects not just production, but trust. While his numbers dipped slightly after his breakout season, the 49ers clearly see long-term stability in his leadership and decision-making.Off the field, Brock Purdy has quietly built a strong commercial profile. Hie is associated with major brands, including Toyota, Alaska Airlines, Buffalo Wild Wings, Ariat, Pioneer Seeds, and John Deere. Toyota’s partnership stood out, marking its first national NFL player endorsement in years.Purdy has also explored business interests. In 2023, he invested in a plant-based energy drink company and shared his enthusiasm publicly.“The best competitors analyze everything about their performance, including taking nutrition seriously. I’m excited pure plant-based energy is now available in an energy drink without sugar. Yerbae, it’s a Game Changer,” Purdy said in a press release.His philanthropy mirrors his grounded personality. During the 2023 season, he supported Child Advocates of Silicon Valley through a jersey-number-themed donation campaign that gained community backing. From sharing a house early in his career to purchasing a home in Nashville after marriage, Purdy’s lifestyle has evolved with intention.Also Read: Patriots celebrate AFC East title return while Drake Maye’s breakout season draws Tom Brady comparisons","Brock Purdy's net worth stands at $20 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth.

New England Patriots Drake Maye delivers a defining performance



New England Patriots' Drake Maye has become the heartbeat of a revival few saw coming, and his rise has reshaped the balance of power in the AFC East. What once looked like a long rebuild has turned into a season of belief, discipline, and sharp execution. New England did not just return to relevance. It announced itself with authority, reminding the league that tradition still matters when matched with the right leadership under center.Sunday’s outcome was more than a routine divisional win. The Patriots handled their business with precision, while events elsewhere quietly sealed the crown. Together, those moments lifted New England back atop the division, a place it knows well, but had not visited in years.Drake Maye has grown from promise into proof. Against the Jets, he played with calm control, carving up coverages and punishing mistakes without forcing the moment. Five touchdown passes told only part of the story. His command before the snap, his timing in the pocket, and his trust in his reads revealed a quarterback fully in charge.Maye’s efficiency was rare, completing nearly every throw while exiting early with the outcome decided.More impressive was how comfortable his teammates looked around him. Veterans and rookies alike fed off his rhythm, turning routine plays into momentum builders.Milestones followed naturally. Numbers once associated with franchise legends are now being revisited, not as nostalgia, but as benchmarks being met again. Maye did not chase history. He let it come to him by protecting the football and delivering when it mattered most.Maye becomes the first Pats quarterback since the seven-time Super Bowl champion to throw for at least 30 touchdowns in a season and at least 4,000 passing yards in a campaign, according to Evan Lazar of the team’s official website.As the regular season nears its close, the Patriots stand balanced and dangerous. The defense is disciplined. Special teams are reliable. The offense, led by a poised young quarterback, is fearless. The finale against Miami will bring its own challenges, but New England enters with clarity and confidence. This is no longer a surprise story. It is a team with direction, belief, and a quarterback ready for the moment ahead.Also Read: Eagles survive late scare in Buffalo as Josh Allen’s missed 2-point try seals dramatic 13-12 loss","Drake Maye has become the heartbeat of a revival few saw coming.

Eagles defense seals a dramatic escape in Buffalo

Eagles walked into Orchard Park knowing the margin for error would be thin, and they played exactly like a team aware of that reality. In brutal weather and under relentless pressure, Philadelphia leaned on grit rather than glamour. What unfolded was not a showcase of offensive fireworks, but a test of nerve, discipline, and defensive resolve that defined the afternoon. Every snap carried weight, every decision felt heavy, and the outcome stayed uncertain until the final seconds.Philadelphia built its advantage early, then spent the final stretch absorbing a storm from a desperate Buffalo side. The rain poured, the crowd roared, and momentum swung hard. Still, the visitors refused to blink. They bent, absorbed hits, and trusted their defense to do the talking when the moment demanded it most. “Wow. What a game.” That line barely captures the emotional swings packed into four quarters of tension.The Eagles defense wrote the closing chapter, and it did so with composure under fire. After allowing Buffalo back into the contest, Philadelphia stood firm when the game hung in the balance. Josh Allen powered in on a late tush push, shrinking the gap to a single point.Moments earlier, Dawson Knox had been ruled inches short after review, a call that shifted the emotional temperature inside the stadium.Buffalo chose aggression over patience. Sean McDermott rolled the dice instead of forcing overtime. Allen, facing pressure, released a pass that drifted just wide of Khalil Shakir in the end zone. Five seconds changed everything. The onside kick never found life, and Dallas Goedert secured it to end the threat. Josh Allen is the youngest player in NFL history to hit 300 career touchdowns. Allen is also the fastest player to ever reach 300 career TDs.Philadelphia’s earlier work mattered just as much. Dallas Goedert’s short touchdown and Jake Elliott’s two field goals built a cushion that proved vital. Jalyx Hunt delivered constant disruption, while Jalen Carter made his presence felt in his return, including a blocked extra point that loomed large by night’s end.The Eagles improved to 11-5 despite being blanked in the second half. Jalen Hurts managed the game, A.J. Brown provided timely catches, and the defense absorbed wave after wave of pressure. Winning in Buffalo is rare. Doing it in driving rain, against a quarterback playing for history, made it unforgettable.Also Read: Giants QB Jaxson Dart reportedly hard launches rumored girlfriend Marissa with cheek kiss before Raiders clash","Eagles defense seals a dramatic escape in Buffalo.

George Kittle injury forces adjustment as Claire steals the spotlight



George and Claire (Instagram)

George Kittle headlines the Sunday night conversation, even though he will not take the field when the San Francisco 49ers face the Chicago Bears in a season-defining clash. His absence looms large for a team chasing the No. 1 seed, yet the spotlight still found its way to the Kittle household in an unexpected way. While the tight end focused on recovery, his wife Claire delivered a game-day moment that fans could not ignore, turning a tough injury update into a lighter note around Levi’s Stadium.The timing could not be more critical. San Francisco enters the matchup at 11-4, tied with Chicago, with playoff positioning hanging in the balance. George Kittle suffered the ankle injury late in last week’s win over the Indianapolis Colts, moments after scoring his seventh touchdown of the season. He did not practice all week, and the team ruled him out well before kickoff. For the 49ers, this is not just about losing a pass-catching threat. It is about missing one of the league’s most complete tight ends in both blocking and leadership during a high-pressure stretch.Without George Kittle, the 49ers must rework parts of their offense. Jake Tonges is expected to handle most of the snaps, a role he has filled before when Kittle missed five games earlier this season with a hamstring issue. Tonges proved reliable then, but replacing Kittle’s physical presence and football IQ is never simple. The coaching staff will lean on balance, asking the run game and wide receivers to shoulder more responsibility against a Bears defense that thrives on discipline.Off the field, Claire Kittle once again showed why she has become a fan favorite. Known for bold fashion choices, she arrived in an eye-catching full-length fur coat paired with a baseball cap, adding to her growing list of memorable looks. From jean shorts moments to a laid-back hippie style at a Grateful Dead concert, she brings personality to every appearance. On a night when George could not suit up, she still delivered a win of her own.The hope inside the locker room is simple. Take care of business against Chicago, stay in control of the NFC path, and get George Kittle healthy in time for the season finale against the Seattle Seahawks. If that happens, Sunday night may be remembered not just for an injury, but for how the 49ers steadied themselves when it mattered most.Also Read: Giants QB Jaxson Dart reportedly hard launches rumored girlfriend Marissa with cheek kiss before Raiders clash","The San Francisco 49ers face the Chicago Bears in a season-defining clash.

Jaxson Dart’s girlfriend Marissa Ayers rumors turn into a social media moment



Jaxson Dart's rumored girlfriend Marissa Ayers has quietly become one of the most talked about off-field storylines surrounding the New York Giants rookie quarterback. At a time when the season has offered little on-field excitement, Dart’s personal life has stepped into the spotlight, drawing attention from fans, pop culture pages, and social media detectives alike. What started as light speculation has now evolved into something far harder to ignore.The buzz did not come from staged announcements or glossy interviews. It built naturally through public sightings, subtle social media clues, and familiar faces appearing in unexpected places. As Dart prepares for games that carry little playoff weight, the conversation around him has shifted, fueled by curiosity about the woman frequently seen in his orbit and what their growing visibility might mean.Marissa Ayers is no stranger to attention. A model, influencer, and boxing ring girl, she commands a massive online following and knows how quickly moments can travel across platforms. When she appeared alongside Dart’s mother, Kara, at a Giants road game, speculation surged. Fans viewed it as a clear sign that this was more than a casual connection. Add in sightings from dinners, a Giants T-shirt spotted in a private setting, and carefully shared posts, and the picture began to sharpen.The moment that pushed the rumors into near confirmation came via social media. According to pop culture account deuxmoi, Dart shared a Snapchat photo kissing Ayers on the cheek. While the original image is no longer publicly visible, the claim gained traction fast and fit seamlessly into the trail of hints already left behind. In the modern NFL, that kind of post is widely seen as a relationship hard launch.Ayers herself has spoken openly about what she values in a partner, offering insight into why this pairing feels intentional rather than impulsive. In a TikTok video, she said, “I’m just a very, very picky person. Like I have very high standards … I just feel like I haven’t met somebody that really matches my energy.” That comment now reads differently as fans connect the dots.Dart’s popularity has also invited false rumors, including a fabricated DM scandal involving Alix Earle. Earle shut it down quickly, writing, “What is this fake photoshopped dm u guys are posting? 1. That never happened. 2. That wouldn’t be on my story.” The incident served as a reminder of how quickly speculation can cross lines.For now, Dart and Ayers have not made formal statements. Still, their actions suggest comfort with the spotlight. As Giants fans look ahead to a hopeful reset, Dart’s relationship appears to be on firmer ground than the season itself.Also Read: Nikki Bella sparks fresh Cooper DeJean dating rumors by rocking his Eagles jersey during the Bills showdown","Jaxson Dart's rumored girlfriend Marissa Ayers has quietly become one of the most talked about off-field storylines.

Buffalo Bills surprise fans with a play named for Hollywood star Charlie Sheen,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/buffalo-bills-surprise-fans-with-a-play-named-for-hollywood-star-charlie-sheen/articleshow/126221957.cms,"The Buffalo Bills drew attention after it was revealed they run a play named after actor Charlie Sheen. The detail surfaced during a live broadcast when Tom Brady explained the play following a Josh Allen completion. The unusual name sparked curiosity and humor, highlighting how NFL teams often blend pop culture references into their playbooks.

Buffalo Bills and Charlie Sheen connection sparks curiosity during broadcast

Buffalo Bills and Charlie Sheen unexpectedly collided on an NFL Sunday, creating one of the more amusing moments of the Week 17 slate. What began as a routine first drive at Highmark Stadium quickly turned into a talking point that blended football strategy with pop culture nostalgia. A clean completion from Josh Allen to Dawson Knox moved the chains, but the real surprise came seconds later from the broadcast booth.As the fans were getting seated, the FOX analyst, Tom Brady, casually announced that the Bills still have a play whose name has Hollywood origins. What made the moment both memorable and noteworthy was only slightly due to the yardage obtained, but because it was the lifting of the curtain that surrounds how playbooks are usually outlined, a shared history, internal jokes that never get included in the stat sheet.Brady explained the play in detail while sharing its unusual nickname. “We used to call it ‘Charlie Sheen’ and I know Buffalo still calls it Charlie Sheen. Counter on protection, you pull the guards. Linebackers step up and then Knox crosses the field. You get that separation again,” Brady said of the play.The comment caught play by play announcer Kevin Burkhardt off guard. Trying to connect the dots, he joked, “Is that Charlie Sheen because he beat two and a half men on that route? Just trying to figure it out,” referencing Sheen’s former sitcom Two and a Half Men.Brady offered no clarification, leaving the origin story open to speculation. Some fans leaned into the sitcom reference. Others wondered if it was a nod to Sheen’s famous “winning” phase that once dominated headlines. The truth remains unclear, and that mystery only adds to the charm.What matters more is what the moment revealed about the Bills. This is a team comfortable blending creativity with execution. The play worked. The name stuck. And decades after Charlie Sheen dominated pop culture, his name still finds its way into unexpected places.","Buffalo Bills and Charlie Sheen connection sparks curiosity during broadcast.

Patrick Mahomes’ injury recovery takes powerful turn as teen fighting rare disease steps up to inspire him,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/patrick-mahomes-injury-recovery-takes-powerful-turn-as-teen-fighting-rare-disease-steps-up-to-inspire-him/articleshow/126215033.cms,"Patrick Mahomes received heartfelt encouragement during his ACL recovery from a 14 year old Kansas teen battling Pompe disease. After meeting through Make A Wish, the teen shared words of resilience drawn from his own rehabilitation journey. The exchange offered Mahomes motivation beyond football as he begins a long road back to the field.

Patrick Mahomes finds inspiration during ACL recovery

Patrick Mahomes entered unfamiliar territory this December, not just because of a serious knee injury, but because of the voices that rose around him far beyond the stadium. As the Chiefs quarterback begins a long recovery from ACL surgery, encouragement has come from an unexpected place. It arrived quietly, without hype, and carried more weight than most locker room speeches.The message came from Kansas, where a 14 year old named Grady has been fighting a battle of his own. Living with Pompe disease, a rare genetic condition that weakens muscles over time, Grady understands rehabilitation in ways most people never will. His words reached Mahomes during a difficult stretch and offered perspective that statistics and timelines cannot provide.Grady met Mahomes through the Make A Wish Foundation of Missouri and Kansas earlier this fall. In a video later shared by Children’s Mercy, the two were seen tossing a football together, a moment Grady had worked months to earn through physical therapy. Despite his condition, he pushed himself daily just to walk independently and take part in that brief exchange.ID@undefinedCaption not available.After Mahomes suffered his knee injury, Grady sent a message that quickly resonated.“Don’t doubt yourself! I had an injury kind of like yours, and I came back stronger than ever so you should too.” The words reflected lived experience, not optimism for show.Grady even joked about the pressure of the moment. “If I dropped that pass, I would never show my face again,” he said. The meeting nearly did not happen. The day before, Grady slipped and fell on his left hip, yet still showed up determined to meet his hero.Their conversation extended beyond football mechanics. “I asked Mahomes if he liked winning at home or away better,” Grady said. “He said he likes winning at home, obviously. When he’s away and scores a touchdown, the crowd gets silent. He said he feels like the villain but he doesn’t want to be the villain.”Mahomes underwent surgery on December 15 to repair a torn ACL and LCL and has since returned to Kansas City to begin rehabilitation. A nine month recovery window has been outlined, though the timeline remains flexible. As one young fan reminded him, recovery is not just about returning. It is about coming back stronger, in every sense.Also Read: Patrick and Brittany Mahomes’ family workout sparks brief worry after kids tumble on treadmill",Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes underwent knee surgery in December.

“Fake an injury and end the thing”: Travis Kelce faces mounting backlash as reckless podcast rant intensifies retirement pressure,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/fake-an-injury-and-end-the-thing-travis-kelce-faces-mounting-backlash-as-reckless-podcast-rant-intensifies-retirement-pressure/articleshow/126214941.cms,"Travis Kelce became the focus of controversy after a podcaster’s blunt remarks about his season and future went viral. The comments questioned his health, motivation, and whether he should keep playing amid a disappointing Chiefs campaign. As retirement rumors grow louder, the episode highlighted how quickly outside voices can amplify pressure on a star nearing a career crossroads.

Travis Kelce rumors swirl as podcast comment sparks debate

Travis Kelce became the center of online chatter once again. As the Kansas City Chiefs tight end faces growing questions about his future on the field, one speculative remark was enough to ignite a wave of discussion far beyond football circles.The moment came during a reaction to Kansas City’s loss to the Tennessee Titans. A conversation meant to critique performance suddenly veered into Kelce’s personal life, pulling Taylor Swift into the spotlight once again. With no confirmation or evidence, a casual assumption quickly turned into a viral talking point, fueled by timing, emotion, and the weight of Kelce’s possible retirement.Sports podcaster Bill Simmons framed his take around concern rather than gossip, but the phrasing did the damage. “It was officially a ‘Feel bad for Kelce,’” he said. “Guy’s a Hall of Famer, he’s getting married to Taylor Swift, having a kid with her, probably flies everywhere private, has private security everywhere he goes.” Within minutes, the comment spread online, stripped of context and amplified by speculation.Simmons continued by arguing that Kelce should protect his body during what has been a frustrating season. “And he’s just kind of running around this f***ing Titans game, trying not to get hurt,” he said.“Fake an injury. Just fake an injury and end the thing.” The blunt advice drew mixed reactions, with some agreeing on caution and others calling it reckless commentary.Neither Swift’s team nor Simmons offered clarification, leaving fans to fill the silence themselves. Social media reacted quickly, often with humor. “I love that he knows that she’s pregnant but isn’t sure if he flies private or not LOL,” one user wrote, capturing the disbelief many felt.The rumors arrive as Kelce openly reflects on his career. During the Chiefs’ emotional Christmas game, he acknowledged the weight of playing in front of a home crowd. “You know it's, you only get a few of those where you just get to stand there and appreciate 60-70,000 Chiefs fans screaming for you,” he said. “It's fun. Hopefully I got everybody fired up for it.”For now, nothing is confirmed except this. When Travis Kelce’s career crossroads meets celebrity fascination, even a passing comment can take on a life of its own.Also Read: Travis Kelce honors the Chiefs with a meaningful Christmas game-day outfit in emotional final home game","Travis Kelce became the center of controversy after a podcaster’s blunt remarks about his season and future went viral.

His daughter Vivian closely resembled her mother, Gisele Bündchen, reminding fans of the supermodel’s lasting presence in the family. The quiet holiday moment highlighted Brady’s close bond with his kids and how echoes of his past remain visible through them.

Tom Brady and Gisele Bündchen family moments take center stage

Tom Brady and Gisele Bündchen remain linked in the public eye, especially when moments involving their children surface. This Christmas, a quiet family snapshot from the Bahamas turned into a talking point, not because of glamour or headlines, but because of how unmistakably familiar one face looked to fans scrolling past.The image showed Brady spending the holiday with all three of his children on a boat under soft evening light. It felt relaxed and unfiltered. Yet attention quickly settled on his youngest daughter, Vivian. At 13, she appeared taller, more confident, and strikingly similar to her supermodel mother, right down to her long, flowing hair that framed her face as the family leaned into the holiday calm.Vivian sat close to her father, dressed casually and smiling with the ease of someone comfortable away from cameras. Her hair, worn loose and wavy, immediately reminded fans of Bündchen’s signature look from her modeling years.Bündchen and Vivian's resemblance felt natural rather than staged, making the moment resonate far beyond a simple holiday post.Brady’s sons completed the scene. Jack, now 18, looked relaxed and grown, while Benjamin stayed slightly behind, adding to the feeling of a family that knows how to enjoy time together without performance.The setting mattered too. A boat ride, warm weather, and golden light gave the moment a softness rarely seen in celebrity holiday coverage.Later, Brady shared a close-up of a gift that carried more emotional weight than luxury. It was a silver flask, simple in design, but engraved with a message that said, ""Merry Christmas to the best dad! We love you,"" followed by his own caption, ""Love my Angels,"". The words reflected a bond built away from stadiums and headlines.While Bündchen marked the season privately with her new chapter, this glimpse of the Brady children offered something quieter. The post showed growth, continuity, and the familiar echoes of two iconic parents reflected in the next generation.Also Read: “Being unfaithful…”: Tom Brady’s ex-wife Gisele Bündchen speaks out on unhealthy relationships, healing, and moving forward",Tom Brady and Gisele Bündchen family moments take center stage on social media.

Luka Doncic's Injury history leading into the Kings game (December 28, 2025)

Context of the December 28 Lakers vs Kings matchup

Luka Doncic’s on-court importance

Los Angeles Lakers vs Sacramento Kings Viewing details (December 28, 2025)

Luka Doncic’s status is the main question heading into the Los Angeles Lakers’ December 28, 2025 game against the Sacramento Kings. Ongoing lower-leg and finger injuries have followed him for weeks, and while he has not been officially ruled out, his availability remains uncertain as tipoff approaches.For the Lakers, already short-handed, his presence carries extra importance. With injuries affecting multiple rotation players, the team needs stability on offense. Fans at Crypto.com Arena are waiting to see whether Doncic can once again play through discomfort and lead a roster missing key pieces.Luka Doncic’s most recent setback came on December 20 against the Clippers, when a left leg contusion forced him to leave the game at halftime. The injury sidelined him briefly and raised concerns about how much he could handle down the stretch of the month.That issue followed a left finger sprain suffered in late October, which cost him roughly a week and kept him out of an earlier matchup with Sacramento. Even after returning, the finger has remained taped during games. Despite that limitation, he delivered one of his best performances of the season with a 49-point night against Minnesota.By late December, he has been back in the lineup regularly, including on Christmas Day against Houston, carrying a probable or available designation while continuing to log heavy minutes.The Los Angeles Lakers host the Kings looking to stop a rough run of results. Sacramento enters the game with an 8–23 record and is dealing with its own injury problems. Keegan Murray is out with a calf injury, and Domantas Sabonis is sidelined due to a knee issue, leaving the Kings short in the frontcourt.Los Angeles faces similar challenges. Several rotation players appear on the injury report, including Jaxson Hayes, forcing the Lakers to rely heavily on their remaining healthy contributors. The game shapes up as less about ideal matchups and more about which team can manage limited depth more effectively.When Luka Doncic plays, his impact against Sacramento is consistent. Even in past meetings affected by minor injuries during his time in Dallas, he has produced across the board, combining scoring, rebounding, and playmaking.With the Lakers, his role has expanded further. Entering the game, he is averaging 34.1 points per game on 45.8 percent shooting, serving as the team’s primary offensive option. With LeBron James missing time this season, Doncic has taken on more responsibility, helping steady the offense and creating opportunities for players like Austin Reaves.The game is scheduled to tip off around 9:30 PM ET at Crypto.com Arena and will air on ESPN, NBA TV, and Spectrum SportsNet. Streaming options include NBA League Pass and Fubo, with attention centered on whether Doncic is available and how his health factors into the matchup.","The Los Angeles Lakers host the Sacramento Kings on December 28, 2025.

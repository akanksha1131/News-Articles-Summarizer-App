Poll Do you support the Pakistan Amateur Athletics Federation's decision to impose a lifetime ban on Salman Iqbal? Yes, it's justified. No, it's too harsh.

The Pakistan Amateur Athletics Federation has imposed a lifetime ban on Salman Iqbal, the long-serving coach of top athlete Arshad Nadeem, for violating the constitution of the Punjab Athletics Association. The ban, announced on Sunday in Lahore, prevents Iqbal from participating in any athletics activities, coaching, or holding office at any level.The ban stems from violations related to elections held for the Punjab Athletics Association in August, where Iqbal serves as President. An inquiry committee formed in mid-September recommended the ban on October 10.The timing of the ban appears connected to Iqbal's recent response to the Pakistan Sports Board regarding Nadeem's performance at the World Athletics Championship in Tokyo. The PSB had sought explanations for Nadeem's poor showing and details about his training and travel expenses.Iqbal's response revealed that the Pakistan Amateur Athletics Federation had distanced itself from Nadeem's activities over the past year. He also disclosed that he had to seek financial assistance from a friend to fund Nadeem's training in South Africa and rehabilitation following a calf muscle injury.The inquiry committee's recommendation came just one day after Iqbal's reply to the PSB was made public.The federation's decision effectively ends Iqbal's involvement with Pakistan athletics at all levels.The ban impacts one of Pakistan's most experienced athletics coaches, who has been instrumental in mentoring Arshad Nadeem. The decision raises questions about the future of Nadeem's training and development program.The federation's action represents a significant development in Pakistan's athletics administration, affecting both the coaching structure and athlete support system.", Salman Iqbal has been banned for life by the Pakistan Amateur Athletics Federation.

Poll Which record do you think will be broken first? Aaron Finch's T20I score of 172 Rohit Sharma's ODI score of 264 Brian Lara's Test score of 400 None - they will stand for a while

Former Australia captain Aaron Finch has sparked a buzz on social media after commenting on which cricketing record could be broken first. Finch, who holds the highest-ever T20I score of 172 against Zimbabwe at Harare in 2018, weighed in on a fan question about how his record stacks up against other iconic innings, including Rohit Sharma ’s 264 in ODIs and Brian Lara’s 400* in Tests.When asked which of the three would fall first, Finch surprised many by quickly naming his own T20I record. “I’m pretty sure it’ll be broken at this T20 World Cup. There’ll be some really good batting wickets and the next generation’s power and skill are on another level,” Finch said on social media.The 38-year-old former batter is currently on commentary duty for the ICC Women's World Cup, and remains closely connected to the sport. His insight comes just ahead of India’s three-match ODI series against Australia, starting October 19, and the five-match T20I series beginning October 29, both in Australia.Speaking from Colombo during his commentary stint, Finch also offered his thoughts on the upcoming India tour. The series will feature Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli, who are now playing only limited-overs cricket. “It always is against India, and I think having Virat back in there brings out the best in him against Australia,” Finch said.Reflecting on the potential outcome, Finch predicted a close contest. “It is always a great battle when you look at it on paper as it is very evenly matched, but I would say Australia [win the series] 2-1. Not confidently though, as India are a great side and it will just be a great series to watch,” he added.Finch’s own record remains a benchmark in T20 cricket: 172 runs off 76 balls with 16 fours and 10 sixes at a strike rate of 226.31, achieved during Australia’s match against Zimbabwe on July 3, 2018. Finch’s prediction has already ignited speculation about the next era of batting in T20 cricket.Others also noticed how he did not even mention Rohit's record, even though the batter is uncertain for the next ODI world cup and was removed from ODI captaincy ahead of the series.With India’s star duo Rohit and Virat returning to Australia, fans will be watching closely not just for wins, but for potential record-breaking feats as well.",Aaron Finch holds the highest-ever T20I score of 172 against Zimbabwe. Rohit Sharma holds the record for the highest ODI score of 264. Brian Lara's 400* in Tests is the highest Test score ever.

'We got desperate': Rohit Sharma on what clicked at 2025 Champions Trophy

Poll Do you think Rohit Sharma will continue to play till the 2027 WC after losing the ODI captaincy? Yes, he has proven himself No, he will fade away

Former India captain Rohit Sharma made his first public appearance since being replaced as ODI skipper, attending the 27th CEAT Cricket Rating Awards in Mumbai last week.Looking noticeably leaner and fitter, Rohit drew attention for more than just his physical transformation. In particular, his thoughtful act during the ceremony has now gone viral.Seated beside ODI vice-captain Shreyas Iyer , Rohit appeared relaxed, chatting with his wife Ritika Sajdeh through the evening.Iyer had earlier gone on stage to collect the CEAT JioStar Award but, after returning to his seat, placed the memento on the floor beside him instead of holding it or setting it on a table.Moments later, Rohit noticed the trophy near Iyer’s feet. Without making a fuss, the 38-year-old quietly picked it up and placed it on a nearby table in a gesture that has since drawn wide praise on social media. Fans lauded Rohit for his respect toward awards and achievements, calling it a small but telling sign of his humility and leadership.The event also marked Rohit’s first public outing since Shubman Gill took over the ODI captaincy. Yet, the veteran opener looked far from a man stepping away from the spotlight. Having led India to back-to-back ICC titles, clinching the 2024 T20 World Cup and the 2025 Champions Trophy, Rohit’s renewed fitness and energy sent a strong message that he remains hungry for more.Speaking on the sidelines of the event, Rohit said his focus remains firmly on cricket, particularly the upcoming ODI series against Australia starting October 19. “I love playing against them. I love going to Australia. It's a very challenging country to play cricket. People there love the game as well,” he said.He added, “Australia is a different challenge every time they have played against us. Having been there now several times, I do understand what to expect. Hopefully we can go there and do what the Indian team is supposed to do and get the result in our favour.”Even without the captain’s badge, Rohit’s calm composure and instinctive respect at the event reflected why he remains one of Indian cricket’s most admired figures.","Former India captain Rohit Sharma made his first public appearance since being replaced as ODI skipper, attending the 27th CEAT Cricket Rating Awards in Mumbai last week.

IND vs WI 1st Test: Why West Indies' decision to bat first vs India backfired?

Poll Do you think Yashasvi Jaiswal can surpass Sachin Tendulkar's Test century record? Yes, he has the talent. No, Tendulkar's record is monumental.

NEW DELHI: Test cricket can be hard, brutal business if you lack penetration as a bowling unit. Coming into this game, the West Indies had the third worst win-loss ratio in Tests since 2020, having lost 23 of 41 matches, making them marginally better than Bangladesh and bottom-placed Ireland. That lack of aptitude and imagination showed at the Ferozeshah Kotla on Friday, in spite of periods of disciplined bowling, as the once-mighty Windies bowling unit seemed cannon fodder for a strong Indian top order on a dry, batting-friendly surface.For those who missed out in Ahmedabad, it was time to rack up the numbers — Yashasvi Jaiswal reminded the world of his penchant for daddy hundreds, becoming only the second Test opener after Graeme Smith to score seven Test tons before turning 24. Among Indians, he is now second only to the peerless Sachin Tendulkar , who had scored 11. Five of his hundreds are scores of 150 or more. Giving Jaiswal company for most of the day was the under-pressure Sai Sudharsan, who fell 13 runs short of the three-figure mark but played an important role in a 193-run second-wicket stand, the fourth-highest partnership ever by a lefthanded Indian pair in Tests.Jaiswal ended the day batting on 173 off 253 balls (22x4) and passed 3,000 runs across formats. India took stumps on Day One of the second Test at 318/2 after Shubman Gill won the first toss of his short captaincy career.It was all worthy pursuit for India — they are chasing the full WTC points at home and some have reputations at stake, so there were no half-hearted measures. For the West Indies, it was ceaseless toil, with only left-arm spinner Jomel Warrican coming away with some special moments, notably the dismissals of KL Rahul and Sudharsan, with some alarming turn offering a portent of what might be to come in this Test.West Indies had seemed despondent in the days leading up to the Test and must have been world weary by the end of Day One. None of that matters, of course, to Jaiswal, who played largely within himself, mindful of the need to take the game away from the opposition on the first day itself.Jaiswal scored only 10 off his first 36 deliveries, trying to increase the control percentage of the cut shots which have been both his boon and bane, as the West Indies seamers started off with controlled lengths and disciplined lines. A yard or two of extra pace would have gone a long way, though.Even before an hour was through, Jaiswal was heard on the stump mic telling his opening partner how nothing much was happening off the pitch, a typical Kotla phenomenon, and with little seam movement on offer, it was a matter of time before the bowlers’ lengths disintegrated and India’s batting found some fluency.There will be a lot of spin to be bowled yet, but the first wicket that fell to spinners in this game was a wonderful one — an unusually aggressive Rahul was left mystified, first beaten in the air and then off the pitch by one from Warrican which turned 84 degrees, having landed either on the seam or on a crack.The dismissal only strengthened the hungry Jaiswal’s resolve to leave his imprint on the game. He decided to adapt minimalism instead of expansive, ambitious strokeplay or bold footwork, playing crisp, clean cover drives, straight drives, threading open spaces behind square when available and rotating strike efficiently. By the second session, his trademark run-scoring square of the wicket was in full view as Jayden Seales started offering width.With no innovation or attempt to disrupt proceedings by Windies captain Roston Chase, all Jaiswal needed to do was exhibit restraint and then cash in on loose offerings. The Windies bowled no extras but Jaiswal reacted by not attempting any sixes throughout the day.Sure, the seamers could have bowled fuller, especially in the middle session, while the spinners could have made more effort to change the angles. The captain could have messed up the fields a bit more to plant doubts in the batters’ minds, but maybe Chase knew the Indian batters would just raise their game.Such is most of Test cricket these days, strangely lop-sided affairs which have largely alienated the cricket-loving masses. Not counting, of course, contests between the chosen top three or four teams, most of which have had robust first-class structures with strong financial backing in place for close to a century or more. For the others, there is perhaps little incentive remaining now to invest in building such infrastructure for the red-ball game.India’s expected dominance on Day One may further deflate the Windies, meaning there might be more to come from Jaiswal. Sudharsan, meanwhile, showed he deserved a longer rope at No. 3.","Yashasvi Jaiswal becomes only the second Test opener after Graeme Smith to score seven Test tons before turning 24.

IND vs WI 1st Test: Why West Indies' decision to bat first vs India backfired?

Poll Will Yashasvi Jaiswal score a triple century in his innings? Yes, he will achieve it! No, he won't reach that milestone.

NEW DELHI: India’s legendary spinner Anil Kumble lavished high praise on opener Yashasvi Jaiswal after the young left-hander’s unbeaten 173 lit up the opening day of the second Test against West Indies at the Arun Jaitley Stadium on Friday. The former India captain went a step further — tipping Jaiswal to turn his marathon innings into a historic triple hundred on Saturday.“Jaiswal is just getting better and better day by day,” Kumble said on JioHotstar’s Amul Cricket Live. “We’ve spoken about his hunger and his attitude toward building big innings, not just for himself but for the team. Even in the previous game, he got off to a good start but was dismissed early, so he’s certainly made up for that here.”The 23-year-old southpaw, who has already amassed almost 2500 runs in just 26 Tests with seven centuries and 12 fifties, batted through the entire first day. His 173 came off 253 balls, decorated with 22 fours, and put India in command at 318/2 at stumps.Kumble, who has seen several modern greats from close quarters, lauded Jaiswal’s temperament and ability to convert starts into monumental knocks. “Throughout his short career, he has shown that he doesn’t waste opportunities like these.Once he’s in, he makes it count — and that’s wonderful to see,” he said.The veteran also pointed out Jaiswal’s rare consistency in producing big hundreds — five of his seven centuries have been scores over 150. Only Graeme Smith and Don Bradman have comparable numbers before turning 24.With the pitch flattening out and West Indies’ bowlers already looking fatigued, Kumble urged the youngster to aim even higher. “He’s still out there, and he can go on to score big runs tomorrow… Jaiswal now has a great opportunity, not just for a double hundred, but maybe even a triple hundred,” Kumble added.If Jaiswal does convert his unbeaten 173 into a triple century, he would become only the third Indian in history to do so — joining Virender Sehwag and Karun Nair.",Yashasvi Jaiswal scored unbeaten 173 on opening day of second Test against West Indies.

Shubman Gill on ODI captaincy: Leading India with lessons from Rohit Sharma & Virat Kohli

WATCH:

Poll Do you think Jaiswal will convert his innings into a double century? Yes, definitely! Maybe, but it's uncertain

NEW DELHI: The opening day of the second India vs West Indies Test at Arun Jaitley Stadium on Friday belonged to Yashasvi Jaiswal , whose scintillating 173 not out anchored India to a commanding 318/2 at stumps. Alongside him, captain Shubman Gill remained unbeaten on 20, as the duo added 67 crucial runs for the third wicket, putting India firmly in control of the match.While Jaiswal’s batting brilliance stole the headlines, a light-hearted yet unusual incident captured the imagination of fans worldwide. Towards the end of the day, Gill suffered a nasty collision with West Indies wicketkeeper Tevin Imlach during a quick single in the 85th over. Both players looked visibly shaken, prompting medical staff to rush on for treatment.In a viral moment that has since taken social media by storm, Jaiswal was seen taking charge of Gill’s concussion check. The 23-year-old opener humorously asked the Indian captain how many fingers he was holding up, mimicking the standard concussion protocol while both players shared a laugh. Fans praised the playful gesture, showcasing Jaiswal’s awareness and camaraderie on the field.Jaiswal’s innings itself was historic. His 173 came off 253 balls and included 22 fours, marking his second instance of scoring 150+ runs on the first day of a Test in India, after a 179-run masterclass against England in Vizag in 2024. Only Virat Kohli has achieved a similar feat on the same venues. Out of his seven Test centuries, five have crossed the 150-run mark, placing him in elite company alongside Don Bradman , who had eight 150+ scores before turning 24.With India ending Day 1 on 318/2, the focus now shifts to whether Jaiswal can convert his dominance into a bigger score and help India seal a 2-0 series sweep.",Yashasvi Jaiswal scores 173 not out as India reach 318/2 on Day 1 of second Test.

Rohit Sharma removed as India ODI captain, a glorious era comes to an end

Poll Do you agree with Mohammad Kaif that Rohit Sharma will play a key role in the 2027 ODI World Cup despite losing captaincy? Yes, I completely agree No, I disagree

NEW DELHi: Former India cricketer Mohammad Kaif has made a bold statement about Rohit Sharma ’s future, asserting that the Mumbai batter will feature prominently in the 2027 ODI World Cup despite being relieved of his captaincy. Shubman Gill was recently appointed India’s new ODI captain ahead of the three-match series against Australia starting October 19, but Kaif believes Rohit’s leadership status will not affect his role as a key opener for India.“He will definitely play, boss. Look, the captaincy may have been taken away from him, but I believe that as an opener, Rohit Sharma will do his job,” Kaif said on his YouTube channel.The former cricketer highlighted the importance of experience in challenging conditions, particularly in South Africa, where the World Cup will be co-hosted alongside Zimbabwe and Namibia. “You need an experienced batter in the side. You can’t go to South Africa with an entirely young team. Sometimes in those seaming conditions, the ball moves a lot and the pitches are bouncy. If you take only new players there, they’ll get exposed.Kaif praised Rohit’s ability to handle pace and bounce, saying, “That’s why I feel you need a player who can handle the bounce, who can pull and cut the rising deliveries just like Rohit Sharma does. On those kinds of pitches, I believe Rohit Sharma will perform even better. His batting style as an opener suits such conditions perfectly. He plays the rising ball, the one that bounces from the front, extremely well. Among all the players you can name, Rohit Sharma is the only one who handles that rising delivery so effectively. ”He also emphasised the importance of combining youth with experience in crucial tournaments.“Just look at his numbers, his years of experience. On a big stage like the World Cup, you need players like Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma, players who have seen the world and experienced ups and downs. In a tournament like the World Cup, you’re going to lose a game or two in between, then you’ll need to make a comeback. You’ll face those do-or-die matches where you must win to reach the quarterfinals or top four.

Poll Which team's performance impressed you the most in their latest match? Germany Northern Ireland France Switzerland

Germany, four-time World Cup winners, returned to winning ways on Friday, thrashing 10-man Luxembourg 4-0 to reclaim top spot in Group A. Captain Joshua Kimmich was the star of the show, scoring a first-half penalty and tapping in a second goal shortly after the break. David Raum’s precise free-kick and Serge Gnabry’s early second-half strike sealed the emphatic win for Julian Nagelsmann’s side.Germany, who endured group-stage exits in both the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, showed a renewed poise and swagger missing from their earlier qualifiers. The victory moved them level on points with Slovakia and Northern Ireland, but ahead on goal difference. Luxembourg’s task became near-impossible after Dirk Carlson was sent off for a handball inside the box within the first 20 minutes, conceding the penalty that Kimmich converted.Northern Ireland kept alive hopes of a fourth World Cup appearance and a first since 1986, defeating Slovakia 2-0 at Windsor Park. An early own goal from Patrik Hrosovsky and a stunning late volley by Trai Hume secured the win. “It was a great night, good performance and the most important thing is the three points,” Hume said.In Paris, Kylian Mbappe continued his fine form at Parc des Princes, scoring just before halftime to mark his 10th goal in consecutive games for Real Madrid and France. Adrien Rabiot and the returning Florian Thauvin also scored as Didier Deschamps’ side eased past Azerbaijan 3-0, remaining unbeaten after three matches and leading Group D. Despite the win, Deschamps urged caution ahead of Monday’s clash in Iceland. “It’s three points more but perhaps not in the way we wanted… Monday will be another game, another context,” he said.Elsewhere, Switzerland maintained their perfect record in Group B, defeating Sweden 2-0, while Kosovo and Slovenia played out a goalless draw. Belgium, chasing a 13th World Cup appearance, were held 0-0 by North Macedonia, who currently top Group J after famously eliminating Germany from the 2022 World Cup qualifiers.With key wins and dominant performances from the likes of Germany, France, and Switzerland, the race for World Cup qualification in Europe is heating up, leaving fans eagerly anticipating Monday’s pivotal fixtures.","Germany thrash 10-man Luxembourg 4-0 to reclaim top spot in Group A.

Poll Do you believe the West Indies can maintain their resistance in the upcoming innings? Yes, they have the momentum No, India will overpower them It’s too close to call

NEW DELHI: Some things are immutable facts, like the laws of nature or the arrow of time. It may finally be time to add the soporific effect of the Feroz Shah Kotla pitch to the list. Never mind its black soil or any other component — no matter how it is treated or when it is prepared, if the square is not completely underprepared and cracking up, it will be low and slow, will stifle pace and spin alike and have a singular effect on the game for three or more days in a Test.This is what happened at the Kotla as India — probably in a hurry to finish off the game — underestimated the tepid nature of the surface. They decided to enforce the follow-on and not rest their bowlers after being in the field for 81.5 overs, 38.5 of those overs coming on the third morning in West Indies’ first innings.This time the pitch is a unique tale of two halves. From the North End, the bowler will stare down at a barren patch with all the wear and tear and promise of bagfuls of wickets. No doubt it is intended that all the attacking spinners should bowl from this end, like Kuldeep Yadav (5/82 in West Indies’ first innings) did for most of Sunday.From the South End, the likely quicker bowler or second spinner any captain will go to will see the opposite — a loose, rectangular patch of light green spanning the width of the pitch. Never mind the alterations, though. On the third day of the second Test, the pitch sank into its usual state of torpor and spurred that unlikeliest of happenings in modern cricket — a Windies batting resistance.It wasn’t for lack of trying from India’s quality bowling arsenal. The pitch simply decided to numb a tired India’s bowling plans into submission, paving the way for a resolute John Campbell and Shai Hope to pitch their tents out in the middle and stretch the game to another day when the West Indies batted a second time. At stumps, WI were 173/2 and the wickets had simply dried up for India.The two put on an unbroken 138 runs, the team’s highest partnership of the year. Campbell scored the side’s first half-century of the series and was batting on 87 at stumps. Hope was batting on 66. It is only the first time in six Tests and three series that the Windies have been able to stretch a game to the fourth day.The cricket wasn’t dull by any means as West Indies resumed at 140/4 with Shai Hope and Tevin Imlach at the crease in their first innings. The surface was low from the start and Bumrah was menacing, but it was Kuldeep who got the important breakthroughs. A magical delivery to Hope drifted away from the batter and went on with the angle as Hope mistakenly played for the turn and lost his wicket.Kuldeep picked up two wickets in two overs to get rid of both the overnight batters but the first important resistance from the Windies started here, as Khary Pierre and Anderson Phillip kept resolute vigil from the 57th to the 73rd over. That should have raised bells in India’s camp but it didn’t.When India then enforced the follow on, they also kept their two main attacking options — Kuldeep and Bumrah — in cold storage for when the ball got older, somewhat enabling the Windies resistance as Washington Sundar, Ravindra Jadeja and Mohammed Siraj toiled fruitlessly.Although the day ended as it began, with the prospect of an eventual India win not in much doubt, the Windies can now hope to force the Indian batters out again and bruise their egos a bit.","The Feroz Shah Kotla pitch is a unique tale of two halves.

VISAKHAPATNAM: Captain Alyssa Healy led from the front with a calculated assault as her 142 (107b, 21x4, 3x6) helped Australia chase down a record target of 331 with an over to spare in the women's World Cup at the ACA-VDCA stadium on Sunday.India's top-order finally found the range with openers Smriti Mandhana (80; 66b, 9x4, 3x6) and Pratika Rawal (75; 96b, 10x4, 1x6) guiding the hosts to 330 in 48.5 overs—nearly 30 runs short given their spectacular start—after being put in. However, India's lower-order collapsed, losing five wickets for 36 runs, with birthday girl Annabel Sutherland (5/40) doing the damage.Healy and Phoebe Litchfield (40 off 39b) got Australia off to a flier. Healy plundered Kranti Gaud for 19 runs in the eighth over with a six and three boundaries Litchfield joined the fun, smashing Amanjot for four boundaries in the 10th over to take their team to 81/0.Shree Charani dismissed Litchfield with Sneh Rana taking a blinder at point. But Healy and Ellyse Perry (47*) ensured there was no dip in the run-rate by hitting boundaries at will. Perry suffered cramps and retired but returned to put the finishing touches to the highest chase in a women's World Cup game.Deepti Sharma removed Beth Mooney cheaply while Charani castled Sutherland in successive overs to reduce Australia to 170/3 in the 28th over. Unfazed, Healy reached her century in 84 balls and hit Rana for 16 runs to bring down the required run-rate. Healy and Ashleigh Gardner added 97 runs for the fourth wicket before Healy's brilliant innings ended with Rana taking another screamer off Charani.Things got tight for the reigning champions with Deepti trapping McGrath (12) leg-before, Amanjot ousting Gardner (45; 46b, 3x4, 1x6) and Sophie Molineux in consecutive overs to reduce Australia to 303/7. With 26 required from 24 balls, Perry finished the match with a six off Rana straight down the ground.Earlier, Mandhana scored her fifth straight half-century against Australia and put on 155 runs for the opening wicket. Mandhana welcomed Molineux by hitting her for 16 runs with two boundaries and a six that took her past 1000 runs in the women's ODIs this year.Rawal also joined the party, hitting Gardner for a boundary and six in the next over as India reached 58/0 in the Powerplay. Mandhana reached her 33rd half-century in 46 balls while Pratika, dropped on 41 by Alana King off Tahlia McGrath, lofted Kim Garth straight over her head for a boundary to reach her seventh ODI fifty in 69 balls. Mandhana also became the quickest to 5,000 women's ODI runs when she hit Garth over long-off for a six.Left-arm spinner Molineux dismissed Mandhana, who failed to clear mid-wicket. Pratika, after adding 37 runs with Harleen Deol (38), holed out to deep fine-leg. Captain Harmanpreet Kaur (22) looked good during her 42-run stand with Deol but Schutt dismissed her and Deol was caught off Molineux.Richa Ghosh's 22-ball 32 (3x4, 2x6) and her 54-run stand with Jemimah (33; 21b, 5x4) helped India past 300 before the Sutherland polished off the Indian innings.",Alyssa Healy scores 142 as Australia beat India in women's World Cup match.

Poll Will India qualify for the semi-finals of the ICC Women’s ODI World Cup? Yes No

NEW DELHI: Hosts India suffered their second consecutive defeat in the ICC Women’s ODI World Cup on Sunday, going down to defending champions Australia by three wickets at ACA-VDCA Stadium in Visakhapatnam Chasing a daunting 331, Australia completed the highest successful run chase in women’s ODI history, winning with an over to spare. India had lost their previous match by three wickets to South Africa at the same venue, leaving the hosts with two wins and two losses from four games.Despite the setbacks, India remain third in the points table with four points, while the top four teams advance to the semi-finals. Australia lead with seven points from four games, followed by England with six points from three matches. South Africa, with four points and a game in hand, occupy fourth place due to an inferior net run rate.With Australia and England firm favourites for top two finish, the race for the semi-finals is expected to be a three-way contest for the remaining two spots between India, South Africa, and New Zealand.India’s upcoming games against England and New Zealand will be crucial.A win against England will bolster their chances, while a loss would leave them in a precarious position. Victory against Bangladesh is expected but may not be enough on its own.South Africa, having already beaten India and New Zealand, hold the upper hand and could book a semi-final spot before their final game against Australia. New Zealand, on the other hand, have lost two matches but still have games against Sri Lanka, Pakistan, and India. They could enter the clash with India already on six points, making it a high-stakes encounter for both sides.India will need at least two wins from their remaining three fixtures — ideally three wins — to realistically secure a semi-final berth. Achieving three wins would bring them to 10 points and strengthen their chances significantly, while two wins would put them on the edge, reliant on net run rate and other results.With Australia and England favourites for semi-final spots, India must navigate this challenging path with precision. While the situation is difficult, it is far from over. India still have the talent and opportunities to turn their campaign around and keep their semi-final dreams alive.","Hosts India suffered their second consecutive defeat in the ICC Women’s ODI World Cup on Sunday, going down to defending champions Australia by three wickets.

Poll Should Pat Cummins take risks to play in the Ashes despite his injury? Yes, it's a crucial series No, his long-term health is more important

Australia’s Test captain Pat Cummins has provided a candid update on his recovery from lumbar back stress, conceding that he is “less likely than likely” to feature in the first Ashes Test at Perth next month.Speaking at the Kayo Sports Summer of Cricket launch in Sydney, the 32-year-old said he was feeling better with each recovery session but admitted he was “a couple of weeks away” from bowling on turf. Cummins resumed running last week and plans to start bowling drills next week. “You’d want at least probably a month in the nets,” he explained. “If you play a Test match, you want to make sure you’re right to bowl 20 overs in a day and you don’t have to really think about it. So four weeks is pretty tight, but I think somewhere around that mark.”While coach Andrew McDonald called the outlook more optimistic in the past week, Cummins stressed the difficulty of transitioning from no bowling to competing in a five-Test series. “With these things, it’s pretty hard to go from not bowling or doing anything at all to suddenly playing five Tests,” he said. “First steps are trying to give [me] a shot at being right, and then we’ll work it out how much I play.”Cummins admitted he was willing to take calculated risks, given the Ashes’ significance in the next six to 12 months. “This is the big series in this next six to 12-month block. But you’ve got to weigh that up against taking stupid risks as well that might cost you in the long term.”The injury, which first caused discomfort during Australia’s 3-0 sweep of the West Indies in July, remains somewhat mysterious. “Maybe it was sometime throughout last summer, maybe it’s been brewing for a little while, we don’t exactly know but West Indies was the first time I felt it,” Cummins said.He also expressed confidence in Australia’s depth if he is unavailable. “Scotty [Boland], he’s coming off a hat-trick, so no doubt he’ll be in for a big summer,” Cummins said. “One of the things we’ve done really well is when someone’s missed out, someone else has stepped straight in and done a brilliant job.”","Australia's Test captain Pat Cummins has provided a candid update on his recovery from lumbar back stress.

NEW DELHI: The blockbuster ICC Women’s World Cup clash between India and Australia at Visakhapatnam on Sunday will be remembered as one of the most record-laden matches in tournament history.From individual brilliance to historic team feats, the match rewrote multiple record-books as Australia chased down a mammoth 331 to win by three wickets with an over to spare.Indian opener Smriti Mandhana once again showcased her extraordinary form, scoring 80 and reaching a monumental milestone of 5,000 WODI runs, becoming the youngest and fastest woman to achieve the feat. Mandhana also became the first-ever player to cross 1,000 runs in a calendar year, amassing 1,062 runs in 18 innings this year alone. Her recent dominance over Australia continued, with five consecutive 50+ scores against the defending champions, cementing her status as an “Aussie hunter” akin to Virat Kohli in men’s cricket.Mandhana’s opening partner Pratika Rawal complemented her perfectly. Their 155-run partnership was not only the highest opening stand against Australia in Women’s World Cups but also the second-most century stands by an Indian pair in ODIs this calendar year. Together, they have registered six century partnerships, second only to Mithali Raj and Punam Raut.For Australia, all-rounder Annabel Sutherland turned 24 in style, taking her first five-wicket haul (5/40) and reaching her 50th WODI wicket.She became the first woman to claim a five-wicket haul on her birthday and only the second cricketer overall to achieve this in ODI cricket.Posting 330, India set their highest-ever World Cup total, surpassing the 317/8 against West Indies in 2022.Australian skipper Alyssa Healy stole the show with a masterful 142 off 107 balls, including 21 fours and three sixes. Her innings set the highest-ever successful chase in women’s ODI history, eclipsing Sri Lanka’s 302-run chase against South Africa last year. Healy’s knock also tied her with Karen Rolton and Meg Lanning for the most centuries by an Australian in Women’s World Cups.The match was also a six-fest, with 13 sixes smashed — seven by India and six by Australia — the most sixes in a single Women’s World Cup match.","India beat Australia by three wickets in the ICC Women's World Cup.

Poll Do you think India's lower-order collapse was the main reason for their loss against Australia? Yes No

NEW DELHI: India captain Harmanpreet Kaur admitted that her team’s shocking lower-order collapse proved decisive as world champions Australia chased down a record 331 to claim a thrilling three-wicket victory in the Women’s World Cup on Sunday.India appeared set for a mammoth total at 294 for 4 in the 43rd over, but their innings unraveled dramatically, losing the last six wickets for just 36 runs in seven overs. Annabel Sutherland spearheaded Australia’s comeback, ripping through the Indian lower order to grab her maiden five-wicket haul (5/40).“The way we started, we could have added 30-40 more runs,” Harmanpreet said at the post-match presentation. “We missed runs in the last six overs and that cost us. It was a good batting wicket, but not batting well in the end made the difference.”Earlier, openers Smriti Mandhana (80) and Pratika Rawal (75) provided the perfect platform with a 155-run stand. But despite a strong foundation, India’s middle and lower order failed to capitalise once again — an area that has plagued the team in the last few matches.“Openers have been outstanding, because of them we’ve been scoring 300-plus,” Harmanpreet said.“But the last five overs hurt us. In the last three games, we haven’t finished well in the middle and death overs. These things happen — it’s important how we come back.”India’s five-bowler strategy, designed to strengthen their batting, also came under scrutiny after the bowlers struggled to contain the Aussies. Harmanpreet hinted that the team might revisit the combination.“We’ll sit and discuss. This combination has given us success, and two bad games are not going to change that,” she said.Among bowlers, only Shree Charani (3/41) impressed, while the rest proved expensive. “She has been outstanding — even against top batters like Healy, she kept things tight,” Harmanpreet praised.Alyssa Healy powered Australia’s chase with a blistering 142 off 107 balls, while Ellyse Perry’s unbeaten 47 guided them home with an over to spare — completing the highest successful chase in women’s ODI history.","India captain Harmanpreet Kaur admits her team's lower-order collapse proved decisive as world champions Australia chased down a record 331 to claim a thrilling three-wicket victory.

Former South African cricket captain Shaun Pollock made a notable error during commentary on Day 1 of the first Test match between Pakistan and South Africa at Lahore's Gaddafi Stadium, mistakenly referring to Pakistan's captain Shan Masood as ""captain of India"" while describing the crowd's reaction during the game on Sunday.The incident occurred during Pakistan's first innings as Shan Masood and Imam-ul-Haq were building a partnership following Abdullah Shafique's early dismissal. The pair went on to forge a 161-run stand for the second wicket.Pollock noticed the crowd's unusual behaviour of cheering whenever South African players made appeals for wickets. The spectators were eagerly awaiting the arrival of Babar Azam , who was making his return to international cricket after missing the Asia Cup 2025.Commenting on this peculiar crowd reaction, Pollock made his memorable gaffe on air: ""I can't believe they would want Shan Masood, the captain of India, to be out just to get Babar to the crease. Think we need to have a word with these supporters.""The commentary error quickly gained attention on social media, with fans sharing clips of the moment and responding with humorous comments about Pollock's confusion.Masood's innings came to an end when he was dismissed by Prenelan Subrayen in the 48th over, having scored 76 runs.His departure finally brought Babar Azam to the crease, accompanied by loud chants of 'Babar, Babar' throughout the stadium.Babar Azam, returning after a lengthy absence from the national team, managed to score 23 runs off 48 deliveries before being dismissed by Simon Harmer in the 60th over.The game marked a significant moment for Pakistan cricket, as it came after their recent campaign in the Asia Cup 2025, where they reached the final but ultimately lost to India.Babar Azam had been notably absent from Pakistan's T20I team during the Asia Cup 2025. The team had also played without Mohammad Rizwan during the tournament, as part of their strategy to field a more aggressive batting lineup.The match represented the first Test between Pakistan and South Africa at the Gaddafi Stadium, with both teams looking to establish dominance in the series.","Shaun Pollock made a notable error during commentary on Day 1 of the first Test match between Pakistan and South Africa at Lahore's Gaddafi Stadium.

Indian cricket team enforced a follow-on against West Indies on day three of their Test match at Delhi's Arun Jaitley Stadium, after bowling them out for 248 in their first innings.John Campbell and Shai Hope staged a strong fightback with unbeaten half-centuries, reducing the deficit to 97 runs after India had earlier declared their first innings at 518/5.West Indies ended the day at 173/2 in their second innings, with Campbell on 87 and Hope on 66 not out.India's assistant coach Ryan Ten Doeschate revealed there were discussions about batting again before enforcing the follow-on.""There was a discussion to bat. Those last two wickets took a little bit longer than we would have hoped for, and had probably started going towards the space where you do look to bat again. But we felt [270] was a good lead. We thought the wicket was going to keep deteriorating, we thought by the close of play it would be at its worst, but it just seems to have slowed down even more,"" said Doeschate.The assistant coach praised Kuldeep Yadav 's four-wicket performance, highlighting his unique bowling style.""The difference is Kuldeep is that he is a mystery spinner, and there is an element of danger associated with it compared to finger-spinners.He is very difficult to pick. Kuldeep bowled in the right areas and spun it both ways,"" Doeschate added.He also commended captain Shubman Gill and vice-captain Ravindra Jadeja's leadership abilities.""Shubman's captaincy is coming on nicely. He excelled on a difficult tour of England, and he continued to build on that, and he conveys the messages to players a lot more now. Jadeja's getting to an age where you start looking beyond him, but he is showing how valuable he is,"" he stated.West Indies all-rounder Khary Pierre expressed surprise at India's decision to enforce the follow-on.""I was surprised, but it's India, and you know they want to get the win, and probably didn't think they needed to go back and bat, but so be it. We have to bat properly in this innings and try and make a game of it,"" Pierre said.Pierre remained optimistic about his team's chances in the match.""I would say the Test match is still on. Once we apply ourselves with the bat, we have two set batters at the crease right now that will start over tomorrow, and once we bat properly, the game is still on. Once we get a lead, we all know, on the fourth and fifth day of a Test match, the bowlers will come and probably get some balls to spin and stuff and make a game of it,"" he said.Earlier in the day, West Indies resumed their first innings at 140/4. Kuldeep Yadav dismissed Hope for 36, breaking the fifth-wicket partnership at 49 runs.Pierre scored 23 and Anderson Phillip made 24 not out, but Kuldeep Yadav (5/82) and Ravindra Jadeja (3/46) helped dismiss West Indies for 248.On day one, India chose to bat after winning the toss. Yashasvi Jaiswal and KL Rahul (38) put on 58 runs before Jomel Warrican removed Rahul.Jaiswal then formed substantial partnerships with Sai Sudharsan (87) and Shubman Gill (129 not out), before being run out for 175.Gill continued his strong form, building partnerships with Nitish Reddy (43) and Dhruv Jurel (44 not out) as India declared at 518/5.Warrican was West Indies' most successful bowler with figures of 3/98.West Indies' first innings saw contributions from Tagenarine Chanderpaul (34) and Alick Athaneze (41) before they were reduced to 140/4 at the end of day two.",West Indies bowled out for 248 in their first innings.

West Indies spinner Khary Pierre expressed surprise at India's decision to enforce the follow-on during day three of the second and final Test at Arun Jaitley Stadium on Sunday, while praising his team's counterattacking response. After being bowled out for 248 in their first innings and trailing by 270 runs, West Indies showed resilience with opener John Campbell scoring an unbeaten 87 and Shai Hope reaching 66 not out in a 138-run partnership.The West Indies ended day three at 173/2, needing 97 more runs to make India bat again in their second innings.""Actually, it was a bit surprising that they went back to bowl, although I know the wicket was still a good one. For me personally, batting on the wicket for a lot of time, watching the wicket, and seeing what it's doing, I think the wicket is still a very good wicket, as I said before,"" Pierre told reporters.""I was surprised, but, it's India, and they wanted to get the winner, and probably they didn't think that they need to go back to bat. But, so be it, and I don't think we take a big challenge of going to bat, and we have to bat properly this innings, and try to make a game out of it,"" he added.Pierre credited the team's emphasis on application and praised the lower order's fight in the first innings, where he contributed 23 runs off 46 balls and shared a 46-run partnership for the ninth wicket with Anderson Philip.""It has been a challenge. If you watch the wicket, it's still a good one, but the odd ball is spinning. For me, personally, I think the wicket is challenging also. The Indian batsmen have also played well to their conditions; they have batted well. It has been tough for me personally, but I think it's a learning process for me. This is only my second test match, so you know, I'm taking it all into account,"" he added.""Application is what we preached in the dressing room, (Daren) Sammy (head coach) and the coaching staff and all, they preached in the dressing room, taking it one session at a time. This is the first time we have been able to win a session in the two Test matches so far.""Playing in just his second Test match, Pierre acknowledged the experience has been a significant learning opportunity.""I've learnt a lot. This is Test match cricket, it's going to be challenging and tough; the conditions are also challenging. But I've learnt that the things I need to do, coming into Test cricket, the variations, getting more purchase off the ball and stuff like that,"" he explained.Pierre expressed confidence in the platform established by Campbell and Hope heading into day four.""A lot of confidence, I think the two batsmen have laid a platform for us. This is Test match cricket, we're going to get this before they deteriorate more, so the more runs we can pile on, it can be a challenge for the Indian batsmen,"" he stated.""I think the wicket is still a good one, with the odd ball spinning a little bit somewhat. So, it's still a good wicket to bat, so, all in all, I think in the Test match, it's all about batting as low as possible to try and get that wear and tear, to even get more slow. So, it's still a good wicket, I would say, as of now, but once we continue to bat, going on to the last session in the fourth day, and into the fifth day, I think it's going to deteriorate a lot, and as I said, stay low and spin a little more. ""Pierre commended Campbell's performance, noting it was a deserved reward for his hard work despite an unfortunate dismissal in the first innings.""John has been batting well. He had some dismissals that didn't go his way, and as you see his dismissal in the first innings, that was a really tough one to swallow,"" Pierre commented.The spinner emphasized the team's batting strategy moving forward.""It's just about continuing, and the thing is, on these wickets, once you get a start, you have to score big, and that's the objective. That's what we're trying to preach... try and cash in for the team,"" Pierre concluded.","West Indies spinner Khary Pierre expresses surprise at India's decision to enforce the follow-on during day three of the second and final Test.

Poll Do you think Ghana can make a deeper run than their 2010 quarter-finals berth at the 2026 World Cup? Yes, they have a strong team. No, the competition is tougher.

Ghana sealed their spot at the 2026 FIFA World Cup after a hard-fought 1-0 win over Comoros in Accra on Sunday, becoming the fifth African nation to qualify alongside Algeria, Egypt, Morocco and Tunisia.Midfielder Mohammed Kudus was the hero for the Black Stars, scoring the only goal of the match just two minutes after half-time. A packed 40,000-strong home crowd roared as the Tottenham playmaker pounced on a loose ball in the six-yard box and tapped home following a goalmouth scramble.While Ghana dominated first-half possession, their slow and predictable approach meant Comoros goalkeeper Adel Anzimati-Aboudou was rarely tested. But Kudus’s early second-half strike settled the contest and erased memories of past heartbreaks — Comoros had stunned Ghana at the 2022 Africa Cup of Nations and again in the World Cup qualifiers two years ago.The victory saw Ghana top Group I with 25 points from 10 matches, ahead of Madagascar (19) and Mali (18). It marks Ghana’s fifth World Cup appearance, with their best showing coming in 2010 when they reached the quarter-finals in South Africa before losing to Uruguay on penalties.The result also vindicated Ghana’s decision to persist with coach Otto Addo, who was under pressure after the team’s disastrous 2025 AFCON qualifying campaign, where they finished last in their group without a win.Elsewhere, Egypt defeated Guinea-Bissau 1-0 in Cairo despite resting Mohamed Salah , while Niger shocked Zambia 1-0 to climb to third in the mini-league of second-placed teams.Four more automatic African qualifiers will be decided on Monday and Tuesday, with Benin, Cape Verde, Ivory Coast, and Senegal currently leading their respective groups as the race to the expanded 48-team World Cup heats up.",Ghana beat Comoros 1-0 to seal their place at the 2026 World Cup.

Erling Haaland continued his sensational form for Norway, scoring a hat-trick to surpass 50 international goals in record time as his team thrashed Israel 5-0 in Oslo on Saturday. The win edges Norway closer to their first World Cup finals since 1998.The match unfolded against the backdrop of political unrest, with hundreds of pro-Palestinian demonstrators chanting “Free Palestine” to protest Israel’s actions in Gaza. Norwegian police used tear gas to disperse the crowd and made several arrests. Inside Ullevaal Stadium, a small group of Israeli fans waved flags and held a banner reading “Let the Ball Talk!”Norway now top Group I with 18 points, six ahead of second-placed Italy, who defeated Estonia 3-1 in Tallinn. The result leaves the Norwegians firmly in control as they aim for qualification for the 2026 World Cup in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. Israel, meanwhile, will face Italy in Udine on Tuesday, needing a win to stay in contention.Haaland became the fastest player in men’s international football to reach 50 goals, now boasting 51 in just 46 games. His first penalty was saved by Israel goalkeeper Daniel Peretz, and even a retake was denied, but Norway surged ahead through an 18th-minute own goal by Anan Khalaili.Haaland added his first goal soon after, with Israel contributing another own goal through Idan Nachmias. He then completed the hat-trick with a header and a final nod-in, marking his sixth career international hat-trick. Cristiano Ronaldo had a penalty saved as Portugal narrowly beat the Republic of Ireland 1-0, with Ruben Neves scoring in injury time while honoring his late teammate Diogo Jota. Spain maintained a perfect qualifying record, defeating Georgia 2-0, while Turkey crushed Bulgaria 6-1. Albania claimed a historic 1-0 win at Serbia, keeping their World Cup hopes alive behind England in Group K.With the group stages heating up, Norway and Haaland appear unstoppable, but tense matchups, protests, and dramatic finishes across Europe ensure that the road to the 2026 World Cup will be anything but predictable.","Erling Haaland scores a hat-trick as Norway thrash Israel 5-0 in Oslo.

It's crazy to travel so far to play a match between two Italian teams in Australia,"" Rabiot stated.Serie A CEO Luigi De Siervo responded harshly to Rabiot's comments on Wednesday.""Rabiot forgets, like all players earning millions of euros, that they are paid to do something, and that is play football. He should have more respect for the money he earns and offer more support to his employer, Milan, who accepted and pushed for this match being played abroad,"" De Siervo said.The UNFP defended Rabiot's right to voice his concerns, stating that his views are shared by most players, while acknowledging not all footballers have media access to express themselves.""Freedom of expression for footballers is a fundamental principle that the UNFP will always defend, like FIFPRO, the world players' union,"" the UNFP declared.UEFA has approved both the Milan-Como match in Perth and a Spanish La Liga fixture between Barcelona and Villarreal in Miami, Florida, on December 20.European supporters' groups have criticised these decisions, calling them absurd, unaffordable, and environmentally irresponsible.The UNFP emphasised that players, as primary stakeholders in the game, have both the right and duty to make their voices heard on such matters.UEFA mentioned it had ""reluctantly"" approved the staging of these matches in distant locations.The San Siro stadium will be unavailable on February 8 as it is hosting the Winter Olympics opening ceremony on February 6.","AC Milan to play Serie A home match against Como in Perth, Australia, on February 8, 2026.

India are without a win at the halfway stage of the AFC Asian Cup 2027 final round qualifiers, but miraculously, they are not out of the race either.Reduced to ten men early in the second half after Sandesh Jhingan was sent off just after resumption, Khalid Jamil’s side was a minute away from a second consecutive loss, and almost out of contention. Singapore, however, blundered in the final minute of regulation time as Rahim Ali’s first international goal helped secure a 1-1 result in Singapore on Thursday.Singapore are still on top of the group with five points, three more than India’s two, but they will have a chance to make amends in the home clash next week. Hong Kong (four) and Bangladesh (one) have a game in hand.Only the group winners qualify for the Saudi Arabia edition.“I think it’s going to be difficult, we are just taking one game at a time,” Sunil Chhetri , who returned to the team after being left out for last month’s CAFA Nations Cup, said after the draw. “Going ten men and getting a result wasn’t easy. Just glad to be taking a point away.”Given the circumstances, India will be delighted with a point. When Ikhsan Fandi scored in first half stoppage time for Singapore and Jhingan was sent off for a second yellow, India were left with their backs against the wall.Chances were limited, and the hosts were in the ascendancy, only to blunder right at the end. Without a shot on goal till then and ineffective upfront, India could have only scored from a defensive lapse.India were thrown a lifeline in the 90th minute when Jordan Emaviwe casually played a ball back to goalkeeper Izwan Mahbud. Rahim pressed and the keeper’s clearance struck the feet of the India striker, who was left with an open goal to score his first international goal.For most part, Singapore were the better team, enjoying 63 % ball possession and plenty of looks at the India goal. The hosts had several chances, only to miss, twice from handshaking distance. Ilhan Fandi had two good chances in quick succession.At first, he shot wide, after being put under pressure by a sliding Rahul Bheke, while another attempt from a one-on-one situation with Gurpreet Singh Sandhu saw the keeper effect a good save.Even in the first half with everyone available, India never really posed a threat to the rival goal. Jamil chose to start with two men upfront – Chhetri, Farukh Choudhary – but without creativity in midfield, chances were in short supply.Then, with time running out, Jamil was forced into attacking changes: Udanta Singh, Sahal Abdul Samad and Rahim were all thrown into the mix, and India were ‘rewarded’ with a lucky goal to bring home a point.","Singapore draw 1-1 with India in AFC Asian Cup 2027 qualifier.

What’s common between the three Formula E world champions

How the three World Champions fared in Formula E Season 11

Days after Oliver Rowland lifted his Formula E World Championship trophy in London this season, an interesting trend has come to the attention of Formula E and its fans. As a coincidence, all Formula E drivers who won the Mexico City E-Prix went on to win the Formula E World Championship that season, and this has been proved right for three consecutive years.Highlighting the same since 2023, a poster of three World Champions was shared on X by Formula E with the caption, “The trend continues. Each winner of the #MexicoCityEPrix from the past three seasons has gone on to become World Champion.”The special poster features 2023 Formula E World Champion Jake Dennis from Andretti, then TAG Heuer Porsche’s Pascal Wehrlein, who won in 2024, and the new World Champion, Nissan driver Oliver Rowland. All three of them won in the Mexico E-Prix and went on to lift the winner’s trophy in the Formula E World Championship that year.Oliver Rowland had strengthened his chances of winning the Formula E World Championship this year much earlier. He was leading the Formula E Driver Standings ever since he won Part 2 of the Jeddah E-Prix, which was his second win of the season after winning the Mexico E-Prix. In the last leg, the Nissan driver got nervous for a while as Pascal Wehrlein, who was following him in the number two position, closed the gap after grabbing quite a few podiums while Rowland had a dull period.Things became serious for Rowland when he failed to finish the Round 13 race in Berlin, while Wehrlein won second spot on the podium. But he eventually managed to confirm his championship in Berlin after four wins and three more podiums.Sharing about his bad race in Berlin, Rowland had said, “I was hoping before the weekend that the outcome could be [the World Championship], but after yesterday (Saturday) and this morning (Sunday), I was more worried that it might never come.”Also Read: Oliver Rowland reacts to daughter’s sweet radio message after Formula E Championship win: “It’s amazing” Things, however, changed for Wehrlein, who was pushed to third position after Nick Cassidy made a late entry in the Formula E Driver Standings by registering three consecutive wins.

Wehrlein registered one win and five more podiums this season.Meanwhile, Andretti driver Jake Dennis finished in seventh position in the Formula E Driver Standings.

Taylor Barnard on losing top three spot in Formula E World Championship

Fans hail Taylor Barnard for his fantastic rookie season

It was Taylor Barnard’s rookie season this year, and the NEOM McLaren driver put up a fantastic performance by temporarily making it to the top three in the Formula E Driver Standings by ousting the much more experienced Porsche driver Antonio Felix Da Costa.

Barnard took to Instagram to share his feelings on losing out on the top three in his first-ever season and his claim to the championship.Taking to Instagram after the London E-Prix, Barnard wrote, “London wasn’t what we hoped for, easily being the toughest weekend of our season.

Finishing P4 in the Drivers’ Championship and coming into the final weekend with a shot at runner-up is something to be proud of.”Also adding a note for teammate Sam Bird, as NEOM McLaren withdrew from Formula E after the end of the season, Barnard wrote, “@sambird_official it wasn’t the weekend you deserved either.You’ve been a huge part of my season both on and off the track, and I’m grateful for everything.

We couldn’t have done it without you all — your trust and support have never been taken for granted,” he added.Praising the two McLaren drivers, he wrote, “Sam clinched McLaren’s first-ever fully electric win at the São Paulo E-Prix in Season 10, pulling off one of Formula E’s all-time great overtakes, before being waved across the line by none other than Emerson Fittipaldi – McLaren's first Formula 1 World Champion. While Taylor has been a rookie sensation in Season 11, securing five Formula E records, including the youngest driver to start a race, the youngest points scorer, the youngest driver to lead a lap, the youngest podium finisher, and the youngest polesitter. ”He ended the letter saying, “Some of us have been together since the day we first launched this team, while others have seamlessly fitted in along the way and flourished within the environment we have cultivated. For many, I am sure that we will cross paths again soon, but whatever the future holds for those here at Bicester, whatever path they choose to follow, I have no doubt that it will be bright.

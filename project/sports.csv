NEW DELHI: In a jaw-dropping finish at the Arun Jaitley Stadium on Sunday, Delhi Capitals imploded with three successive run-outs to hand Mumbai Indians a thrilling 12-run win in a high-octane IPL 2025 clash.Chasing 206, Delhi were well placed at 183/7 with 23 runs needed off the final 12 balls. But chaos unfolded when Ashutosh Sharma, who had reignited hope with two crisp boundaries off Jasprit Bumrah , was run out going for a risky second.Off the very next ball, confusion led to Kuldeep Yadav's dismissal at the non-striker’s end, and the final delivery of the 19th over saw Mohit Sharma run out for a duck — ending Delhi’s chase in unbelievable fashion.It marked Delhi’s first defeat of the season after four consecutive wins, while Mumbai Indians celebrated only their second win in six matches.Earlier, comeback man Karun Nair dazzled with a 40-ball 89 in his first IPL appearance since 2022, stitching a 119-run stand with Abishek Porel (33) that had put Delhi firmly in control. But leg-spinner Karn Sharma (3-36) turned the tide by dismissing Porel, Tristan Stubbs and KL Rahul in quick succession.Mumbai’s 205/5 was set up by Tilak Varma’s 59 and Suryakumar Yadav’s fluent 40. Ryan Rickelton (41) and Naman Dhir (38*) provided crucial support. Rohit Sharma’s struggles continued, managing just 18 and extending his poor run to 56 runs in five games.In the end, it was the mayhem of three run-outs that sealed Delhi’s fate in one of the most dramatic climaxes of IPL 2025.","Delhi Capitals imploded with three successive run-outs to hand Mumbai Indians a thrilling 12-run win in a high-octane IPL 2025 clash.

MS Dhoni returns as CSK Captain, confirms coach Stephen Fleming

Poll Should CSK consider more young talents like Mhatre in the future? Only if they perform well in trials. No, experience is more important. Absolutely, youth brings energy.

'Things can turn around quickly': Hussey after CSK's fifth straight defeat

Ayush Mhatre is likely to join the Chennai Super Kings camp for the remainder of the Indian Premier League (IPL). It has been reliably learnt by TimesofIndia.com that the 17-year-old opener will link up with the squad ahead of CSK 's fixture against Mumbai Indians on April 20. As reported by TOI on April 3, Mhatre had been called up by the franchise for mid-season trials in Chepauk . He had gone unsold during the mega auction in Jeddah last year.But with Ruturaj Gaikwad ruled out for the remainder of the season, Mhatre has thrown his candidature in the ring for the five-time champions.Gaikwad was ruled out of the rest of the IPL season with an elbow injury with MS Dhoni taking over the captaincy duties. CSK have had a disastrous season with one win from six matches and are sitting bottom of the points table.The injury to Gaikwad was confirmed by CSK head coach Stephen Fleming on the eve of their eventual loss to Kolkata Knight Riders. The 28-year-old picked up the injury during CSK's match against Rajasthan Royals in Guwahati on March 30. He was struck on his elbow when charging to a Tushar Deshpande delivery, but continued batting and scored 63 in that game.Gaikwad played two more matches after that, scoring 5 and 1 against Delhi Capitals and Punjab Kings, respectively.With the regular CSK captain out of contention, the Chennai management have seemingly shifted focus towards Mhatre as an injury replacement.Mhatre had earlier joined the CSK camp in Chennai from Rajkot, where he was part of BCCI's National Cricket Academy's zonal camp for Under-19 cricketers.“Yes, we’ve called him for trials. He has impressed our talent scouts,” CSK MD & CEO Kasi Viswanathan had told TOI.The youngster had a fine debut season for Mumbai in 2024-25, scoring 458 runs in seven matches @ 65.42, with two hundreds and one fifty in the Vijay Hazare Trophy, and 471 runs in eight matches @ 33.64 with two centuries and one fifty, with top score of 176 against Maharashtra in the Ranji Trophy.",Ayush Mhatre is likely to join the Chennai Super Kings camp for the remainder of the Indian Premier League (IPL) The 17-year-old opener will link up with the squad ahead of CSK's fixture against Mumbai Indians on April 20.

Rory McIlroy secured his first Masters victory and completed golf's career Grand Slam on Sunday at Augusta National , defeating Justin Rose in a sudden-death playoff with a four-foot birdie putt. The world number two from Northern Ireland overcame multiple setbacks during the final round, including squandering the solo lead three times, to join the elite group of players who have won all four major championships.McIlroy's historic triumph came after 17 attempts at the Masters, making him the sixth golfer alongside Jack Nicklaus, Tiger Woods, Gary Player, Gene Sarazen, and Ben Hogan to achieve the career Grand Slam.""It feels incredible. This is my 17th time here. I was wondering if it would ever be my time.

How I responded to setbacks, that's what I'll take from this week,"" McIlroy stated.In the playoff, Rose's approach landed 15 feet from the hole, while McIlroy placed his shot within four feet.

A moment like that makes all the years and all the close calls worth it,"" McIlroy shared.The 35-year-old's journey to victory included overcoming a double-bogey start that erased his initial two-shot lead, briefly falling behind Bryson DeChambeau before reclaiming the lead through two-shot swings on consecutive holes.""I would say it was 14 years in the making, from going out with a four-shot lead in 2011 and feeling I could have done something there,"" McIlroy recalled, referencing his previous Masters disappointment.McIlroy's final round of 73 included a double-bogey at the par-five 13th and a bogey at 14, but he responded with crucial birdies at the 15th and 17th holes.""It's the best day of my golfing life. I'm very proud of myself for never giving up and always fighting back,"" McIlroy declared.Rose mounted a strong challenge with a closing round of 66, including birdies on six of the last eight holes, but ultimately fell short in the playoff.The victory marked McIlroy's third title of the year, following wins at The Players Championship and the Pebble Beach Pro-Am, bringing his career US PGA Tour victories to 29.",Rory McIlroy won the Masters golf tournament for the first time on Sunday.

NEW DELHI: Delhi Capitals are set to host Mumbai Indians in their IPL 2025 clash at the Arun Jaitley Stadium on Sunday. The Hardik Pandya-led Mumbai Indians have already arrived in the capital and are currently training in the city.However, their preparations were affected as Delhi and surrounding NCR regions experienced a sudden dip in temperature on Friday, accompanied by dusty storms for the second consecutive day. The weather disrupted flight operations at the Delhi airport, leading to multiple delays and diversions — and even impacted Mumbai Indians’ practice session.In a video shared by the Mumbai Indians on their social media platforms, star batter Rohit Sharma is seen reacting humorously to the incoming storm. As strong winds hit the stadium, Rohit can be heard shouting “comeback” to his teammates. He then playfully tells the cameraman to focus on the storm instead of him.(Hey, why are you filming me? Shoot the storm instead),"" Rohit says in the clip.Meanwhile, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued a yellow alert for Delhi on April 11, with temperatures expected to range between 23°C and 38°C.While the storms caused disruption, the overcast skies and cooler winds brought a brief respite from the heatwave that had gripped the region over the past week.Delhi Capitals remain the only unbeaten side in the tournament so far with four wins from four matches.Mumbai Indians, on the other hand, are struggling at the bottom half of the table — placed eighth with just one win and four defeats in five games.","Delhi Capitals host Mumbai Indians in their IPL 2025 clash on Sunday.

So yeah, he will be a big miss,"" Dhoni said during the toss.""(On the importance of winning this game) It is important now, every game is important. We have lost too many matches and now it is important to do the basics right - have dot balls, take our catches. A couple of games we lost by big margins, but otherwise it was about the small things - about one over going for 20 runs. Our batters are more authentic as batters, they won't slog everything.

NEW DELHI: Spinner Karn Sharma starred with the ball, returning figures of 3 for 36, as Mumbai Indians pulled off a thrilling 12-run win over Delhi Capitals at the Arun Jaitley Stadium on Sunday, ending Delhi’s unbeaten run in the ongoing IPL 2025 season.Chasing a steep 206-run target, Delhi were cruising at 135 for 2 with Karun Nair anchoring the chase. But the game turned on its head after Nair’s dismissal for a sensational 89, triggering a late collapse that saw Delhi bowled out for 193. Mumbai, who had only one win from five games before this, secured a much-needed second win of the season.Needing 23 off the final 12 balls, Delhi found a glimmer of hope when Ashutosh Sharma cracked two boundaries off Jasprit Bumrah. However, the last three balls of the 19th over brought chaos as three run-outs derailed Delhi’s hopes and brought Mumbai roaring back into the contest.Nair, playing his first IPL match in three years, was a standout for Delhi. The 33-year-old came in as an impact substitute after Jake Fraser-McGurk fell to the first ball and lit up the Kotla with a 40-ball 89, including a 22-ball fifty – his first IPL half-century in seven years. His 119-run partnership with Abishek Porel (33) laid a strong foundation before Karn Sharma’s introduction changed the course of the match.Karn, also an impact substitute, broke the crucial stand by removing Porel and then dismissed Tristan Stubbs and KL Rahul in quick succession to tilt the momentum in Mumbai’s favour. Mitchell Santner also chipped in, bowling Nair to deliver a massive blow to Delhi’s chase.Earlier, Mumbai posted an imposing 205 for 5, thanks to a fluent 59 from Tilak Varma and a vital unbeaten 38 from Naman Dhir. The innings was built on a brisk start provided by Ryan Rickelton (41) and Rohit Sharma (18), though the latter once again failed to convert, falling lbw to Vipraj Nigam. Rohit now has just 56 runs from five matches.Suryakumar Yadav added a quick 40 off 28 and stitched a 60-run stand with Varma before Kuldeep Yadav struck twice, removing Rickelton and Suryakumar. Nigam then removed Hardik Pandya cheaply, but the Varma-Dhir stand ensured Mumbai crossed the 200-run mark.The win lifts Mumbai’s morale and keeps their playoff hopes alive, while Delhi remain second in the table with their first defeat of the season.","Mumbai Indians beat Delhi Capitals by 12 runs in IPL 2025.

An explosive knock by Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) opener Phil Salt and Virat Kohli 's signature unbeaten innings as 'chasemaster' deflated the Rajasthan Royals ' (RR) bowling attack, chasing a par target of 174 that the visitors achieved in 17.3 overs for a nine-wicket win in the Indian Premier League (IPL) match at the Sawai Mansingh Stadium in Jaipur on Sunday.'Player of the Match' Salt's 65 off just 33 balls included 5 fours and 6 sixes as he played the aggressor in the 92-run opening stand, until dismissed in the ninth over bowled by 'impact sub' Kumar Kartikeya. After that, Kohli bossed the proceedings with his unbeaten 62 off 45 balls, including 4 fours and 2 sixes, and an 83-run unbroken stand with Devdutt Padikkal (40* of 28 balls).The half-century is Kohli's 100th in T20s, making him the only Asian player to achieve the feat.The victory kept RCB unbeaten in away matches so far this season and pushed them up to No. 3 on the points table with eight points from four wins, while RR stayed at the seventh spot with four points from six matches.RCB's bowling-first strategy proved effective on a pitch with inconsistent bounce and low carry, despite Yashasvi Jaiswal's impressive 75 runs from 47 deliveries, contributing to Rajasthan's final score of 173/4.The batting conditions were challenging with a sluggish surface, yet Salt's aggressive response caught the home team off guard.Salt demonstrated his aggressive intentions immediately, scoring a six off Jofra Archer's first over via a top edge, while also surviving a close leg before wicket appeal.His strategic movement across the stumps to target the leg side helped him achieve his second half-century of the tournament in 28 deliveries, reducing the target to under 100 runs by the eighth over.He had some lucky moments during his innings. At 23 runs, his powerful shot narrowly escaped Sandeep Sharma's stretched hands during a difficult caught and bowled attempt.Subsequently, when he reached 40, Jaiswal failed to hold onto a difficult catch at cover, which also presented a run-out opportunity that wasn't capitalised upon. These missed chances proved costly for the Royals.Kohli adopted a supporting role initially, starting with a measured approach of seven runs from his first six deliveries.He too had a fortunate moment early on when Riyan Parag failed to hold onto a straightforward catch at mid-off from Sandeep's slower delivery. However, RCB's star batter quickly regained his composure.Together, they scored 65 runs during the powerplay phase.Following Salt's departure, RCB required 82 runs from 68 deliveries. Subsequently, Kohli took control, crafting his innings with 25 singles while selecting his boundary opportunities with precision.He achieved his remarkable 100th T20 half-century in spectacular fashion, advancing down the pitch to dispatch Wanindu Hasaranga for a six straight over the bowler's head. That particular over, the 15th of the innings, produced 14 runs, reducing the target to a manageable 28 runs from 30 balls, effectively securing the outcome.Earlier, the young Jaiswal, aged 23, demonstrated excellent technique on a challenging surface, striking 10 fours and 2 sixes while his teammates found scoring difficult.He completed his second half-century of the tournament in 35 deliveries and put together a brisk 56-run partnership with Riyan Parag (30 off 18).Parag showed promise with one six and three fours but failed to capitalise after being dropped by Dayal at point when on 13.His innings concluded when he mistimed Dayal's well-concealed slower delivery, offering a catch to Kohli positioned at short cover.Sanju Samson struggled during his brief innings of 13 from 16 deliveries, facing difficulty against accurate bowling. Although he escaped an early run-out opportunity, his innings ended when Krunal Pandya had him stumped.Jaiswal maintained momentum with creative shot selection, successfully executing lap shots and reverse sweeps.His aggressive intent was evident when he scooped Hazlewood for a six over fine leg, but the same bowler dismissed him shortly after when he attempted a sweep shot and was adjudged leg before wicket.During the death overs, Dhruv Jurel remained unbeaten on 35 from 23 balls, providing the final flourish.","Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) beat Rajasthan Royals (RR) by nine wickets in Indian Premier League (IPL) match at Sawai Mansingh Stadium in Jaipur on Sunday.

NEW DELHI: Fans flooded social media after Riyan Parag dropped a straightforward catch of Virat Kohli during the IPL 2025 clash between Rajasthan Royals and Royal Challengers Bengaluru at the Sawai Mansingh Stadium in Jaipur, missing a golden chance to dismiss the RCB stalwart.The moment unfolded in Sandeep Sharma’s over when Kohli, stepping down the track, attempted to loft a cross-seam slower delivery. The shot lacked timing and elevation, sending the ball straight up in the air.Parag, coming in from mid-on with his sunglasses on, got underneath it but couldn’t hold on.It was a regulation catch, but the RR fielder spilled it, visibly frustrated and exchanging words with Tushar Deshpande, who had also approached the ball before backing out.Sandeep, who has dismissed Kohli seven times in the IPL, nearly had his number for the eighth time. Instead, Kohli survived and picked up a couple of runs.Parag, who considers Kohli his idol, looked stunned after grassing the opportunity.Opener Yashasvi Jaiswal scored his second half-century of the season and shared two fruitful partnerships with skipper Sanju Samson and Young Riyan Parag as Rajasthan Royals scored 173 for 4.Jaiswal scored 75 off 47 deliveries, sharing an opening-wicket stand of 49 with Samson (15) and a 56-run partnership with young Parag (30) to lead RR's charge on home ground, where the ball remained low and came slow. He struck 10 fours and 2 sixes before getting out LBW to Australia pacer Josh Hazlewood.Dhruv Jurel then made 35 off 23 balls to guide RR to a decent total on this track.Earlier, RCB skipper Rajat Patidar won the toss and elected to bowl first.

Mohamed Salah ignited Liverpool’s charge in the 18th minute with a brilliant run from halfway, sliding a perfectly timed ball to Luis Diaz , who tapped in from close range.Though an unfortunate own goal from Andy Robertson — deflecting off Van Dijk — briefly pegged Liverpool back in the 86th minute, redemption followed swiftly. Van Dijk rose to meet Alexis Mac Allister’s corner just three minutes later, sealing a vital victory.“In the 18th minute, Mohamed Salah sprinted away on the halfway line, accelerating towards the West Ham area and caressing a perfectly weighted pass to Diaz, who had the simple task of slotting home from six yards,” the club noted.Liverpool could secure their 20th English league championship as early as April 20 if they defeat Leicester and Arsenal slip up at Ipswich.Elsewhere, Tottenham’s domestic woes deepened as Wolves cruised to victory at Molineux.

MUMBAI: A balmy Mumbai evening turned into a time capsule on Sunday a week back as Barcelona and Real Madrid legends rekindled one of football’s fiercest rivalries.While the scoreline read 2-0 in favour of the Real Madrid Leyendas, the night was much more than just goals. It was a celebration of football’s enduring legacy.Fans at the Mumbai Football Arena may not have filled every seat, but those in attendance were treated to a surreal experience.FIFA World Cup and UEFA Champions League winners graced the pitch. Xavi Hernandez , Rivaldo , Carles Puyol for Barcelona, and Luis Figo , Fernando Morientes, and Michael Owen for Madrid.Though older and past their competitive prime, the skill, footballing IQ, and passion were unmistakably intact.The match saw Morientes strike early with a trademark finish in the 15th minute, followed by David Barral doubling Madrid’s lead midway through the second half.Despite the deficit, Barça responded with composure and flair, orchestrated by Xavi and spearheaded by a lively Rivaldo.Phillip Cocu made his long-awaited return in a Blaugrana jersey, while Javier Saviola - who sported colours for both clubs in his playing days - added bursts of energy. Yet, the Catalans couldn’t find the finishing touch.On the Madrid side, the ball gravitated towards Figo, who looked sharp and determined, still very much the heart of Los Blancos.Every touch from the Portuguese legend was met with thunderous cheers or emphatic boos, depending on the fan allegiance, proof that the rivalry, though friendly in nature, still runs deep.What stood out beyond the game was the atmosphere in the stands. Indian fans, many of whom grew up idolising these players, sang, waved club banners, and relived memories from a golden era.Despite the rivalry, camaraderie was in abundance.Barca and Madrid fans shared stands, clicked pictures for each other, and engaged in healthy banter, a rare sight for a fixture historically defined by tension.While the match saw passionate attendance, the reach was limited: advertising, ticket pricing, and scheduling played a role.For such events to serve as a launchpad for football’s growth in India, there is a need for broader awareness, grassroots engagement, and structured interaction between legends and local players or coaches.Ultimately, Mumbai witnessed more than a match.It was a reminder of football’s power to inspire and unite. It was an evening where legends walked again and a generation of fans got a glimpse of their heroes not through screens, but in the flesh.","A week ago in Mumbai, football legends from Barcelona and Real Madrid reignited their rivalry in an exhibition match.

Kolkata: If winning is a habit, trust Mohun Bagan SG to make it a magical monotony at home this season.Let them face the biggest of challenges, let them have all sorts of odds stacked against them and let them be forced to trail with a title at stake. But invariably and unflinchingly, expect Jose Molina’s men to find a way out of the crisis and have the last laugh. Bengaluru FC learnt this in quite a compelling way at the Salt Lake Stadium. Gerard Zaragoza’s visitors were welcomed to the Bagan’s formidable fortress with a giant tifo from the home fans — “Champion’s home, entry prohibited.”Yet they silenced the thunderous crowd when Alberto Rodriguez was forced into conceding an own goal while dealing with Ryan Williams’ centre in the 49th minute.Jason Cummings’ penalty in the 72nd minute and Jamie Maclaren’s poacher’s goal six minutes into the first half of extra time were all Bagan required to script a turnaround in a 2-1 win here on Saturday and become the second team after Mumbai City FC to complete the Indian Super League double.A year ago, Bagan lost a similar opportunity to Mumbai City at the same place. But this season they seemed to be a different beast, assuming a juggernaut crushing one opponent after another at home to stretch their winning run to 14 matches. Two months after sealing their back-to-back Shield, they deservedly lifted the ISL Cup in front of 59,112 spectators.It’s quite a journey for Molina’s men. Nine months ago, BFC inflicted the heaviest defeat on them (0-3), putting Molina’s Bagan project under serious question mark. Now claiming the double at BFC’s expense should come as completion of a circle for the winners.Bagan began in a way culled straight from their playbook, setting the alarm bells ringing in the all-Indian rival defence with some trademark moves from the wings. Having somehow managed to weather that storm, BFC started to establish a more recognizable rhythm. BFC duly and deservedly went ahead soon after the restart. It started with another incisive run from Ryan Williams down the right and the Australian delivered an inviting cross. Rodriguez ended up miskicking it into his own.Molina sought intervention from the bench. The introduction of Ashique Kuruniyan and Sahal Abdul Samad brought pace and panache to the attack. When Cummings swivelled to take aim, it looked destined for a goal but Gurpreet denied him. But BFC caved in to Bagan’s constant pressure.As Maclaren tried to get past Chinglensana Singh following Cummings’ centre, the ball touched the BFC centre-back’s hands, forcing referee Senthil Nathan to point to the spot. Cummings made no mistake in beating Gurpreet.Maclaren then provided the coup de grace.",Mohun Bagan beat Bengaluru FC 2-1 to complete the ISL Shield and Cup double.

Barcelona secured a crucial 1-0 victory against Leganes through Jorge Saenz's own goal on Saturday at Butarque stadium, extending their lead to seven points at the top of La Liga . The win maintains their impressive 24-match unbeaten run in 2025 and keeps them on track for a potential quadruple this season.Second-placed Real Madrid face Alaves on Sunday, now under pressure to close the gap on the league leaders.Barcelona's performance lacked their usual attacking flair, but they managed to grind out the win following their midweek 4-0 Champions League victory over Borussia Dortmund.""The fight and the mentality the team showed today was great,"" said Barcelona manager Hansi Flick. ""(Madrid) have a match tomorrow but we're only looking at ourselves, three points is good and we had a great week.""""In the end what is important in these games are three points,"" Barcelona defender Eric Garcia told DAZN.

PANAJI: Two years after withdrawing a bid to host the AFC Asian Cup 2027, the All India Football Federation ( AIFF ) has now officially shown interest in hosting the 2031 edition of Asian football’s most prestigious national team tournament.With Praful Patel as president, India had launched an ambitious bid in 2020 to host the Asian Cup 2027. However, when the new executive committee took charge in 2022 with former India goalkeeper Kalyan Chaubey as president, the first major decision was to withdraw the bid, leaving Saudi Arabia as the only country left in the fray.Now, AIFF has officially notified the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) of its desire to organise the quadrennial event. Besides India, six others have expressed interest in hosting the continental showpiece. It includes Australia, Indonesia, South Korea, Kuwait, United Arab Emirates and a joint bid from Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan.While UAE, Australia, South Korea, Kuwait and Indonesia (jointly with three other countries in 2007) have all hosted the Asian Cup in the past, the Central Asian countries and India, if selected, will host the tournament for the first time.The decision is expected at the AFC Congress in 2026.",All India Football Federation (AIFF) has officially shown interest in hosting the 2031 edition of Asian football’s most prestigious national team tournament.

KOLKATA: Football , like life, moves in cycles. As Mohun Bagan SG and Bengaluru FC (BFC) prepare to bring down the curtain on the 2024-2025 season of Indian Super League (ISL) at the Salt Lake Stadium on Saturday, the two finalists will also relish the opportunity of completing a cycle of their journey in their own way.Mohun Bagan coach Jose Molina is someone who never lives in the past. But as he was sitting next to his Bengaluru counterpart Gerard Zaragoza during Friday’s news conference, it was tempting to take his mind to that September 28 evening when his team capitulated 0-3 at the Sree Kanteerava Stadium, their heaviest defeat of the league this term.Having lost the Durand Cup final earlier, the just-arrived Spanish coach was staring at uncertain times until his team turned things around in a record-breaking run and took the form of a juggernaut. Facing BFC again, the incentive is now greater for Molina and his League Shield winners at home -- a maiden ISL ‘double’ in the club’s history.Bagan missed a similar opportunity at home a year ago having lost the final to Mumbai City. At their formidable fortress where they are yet to taste defeat in the league, it would be a mammoth upset for them to be condemned to the periphery of a title-decider again.Zaragoza’s BFC, however, will enter the final with the battle-hardened look of a team, with hunger and determination to finish the season with a flourish. Not long ago BFC looked to be a team fearfully ambitious to give Bagan a run for their money but they lost the plot following a dreadful run in Janunary.Zaragoza, however, reflected on a brutal, wounding result that had happened further back to make sense of the occasion.“Last year, (it was) another April 11, we played Bagan at home and lost 0-4. Now we are here in the final and facing them. This is the difference for my team between then and now,” the BFC coach maintained on Friday.“Now we are in the final mood,” he added with a smile.Bagan will certainly have the edge with the support of their proverbial 12th man — the fans. It will be quite an audition for BFC at the Salt Lake Stadium. Yet, don’t expect it to be an uneven contest. Sunil Chhetri , even at the fag end of his illustrious career, is still showing hunger for goals and his stellar form, by Zaragoza’s own admission, is giving him a good headache whether to start him or use him as substitute.Bagan aim to take the centrestage this time. But Chhetri & Co. will be there, armed with some old tricks, to put a spanner in Bagan’s ambitions.",Mohun Bagan SG and Bengaluru FC will meet in the final of the 2024-2025 Indian Super League (ISL) The two finalists will also relish the opportunity of completing a cycle of their journey in their own way.

Churchill Brothers finished on top of the table with 40 points, one more than second-placed Inter Kashi (39). Ideally, they should have been crowned champions, but with Kashi scoring twice in stoppage time to edge past Rajasthan United 3-1, they are also in contention for a top spot, and consequently a place in next season’s Indian Super League (ISL).Kashi were awarded three points by the AIFF disciplinary committee after Namdhari FC were found to have fielded an ineligible player. The decision was challenged and later stayed by the appeals committee.Should the appeals committee decide against Namdhari, Kashi will move on top with 42 points.

Pascal Wehrlein’s journey to Formula E

Pascal Wehrlein may have clinched victory at the Miami E-Prix thanks to a dramatic turn of events, but make no mistake—his win was far from a fluke. The TAG Heuer Porsche driver is the reigning Formula E World Champion, having secured the title last season, and his latest triumph is yet another testament to his skill, timing, and tactical brilliance.Pascal Wehrlein’s win in Miami followed a chaotic three-car crash that temporarily threw the race into disarray. Amid the confusion, the German driver seized the opportunity to power through to the front in spectacular fashion.But this win wasn’t just about being in the right place at the right time. Wehrlein had already proven his pace earlier this season by registering the fastest lap in both the Sao Paulo and Mexico City E-Prix. Miami was less a lucky break and more a long-overdue reward for his consistency and form.Currently sitting third in the Drivers’ Championship standings, Wehrlein boasts of 1 win, 2 podiums, and 51 points this season. In total, his career stats now include 8 wins, 14 podium finishes, and 8 pole positions.The German-Mauritian driver started his racing career in karts in 2003 at the age of nine. He went on to enter the Formula 3 Euro Series in 2012 and then the DTM, before finally landing at Formula 1 . There he started as a reserve driver for Mercedes in 2014 and went on to make his F1 debut two years later with Manor Racing. He moved to Sauber in 2017 and even had a tiny stint at Ferrari before switching to Formula E.Since switching from Formula 1 to Formula E with Mahindra Racing in 2018, Wehrlein has steadily carved his path. After two seasons with Mahindra, he joined TAG Heuer Porsche in 2021. Though his first season with the team was winless, he quickly turned things around. With three E-Prix victories across the last two seasons, his Miami win only adds to a growing tally—one that seems set to climb even higher with many more races left on the calendar.More recently, Wehrlein has expanded into endurance racing , making his debut at the 2025 24 Hours of Daytona. He’s also set to compete in the prestigious 24 Hours of Le Mans.Off the track, Wehrlein has a stunning wife, Sibel and the couple are parents to their two-year-old daughter, Soleya.",Pascal Wehrlein is the reigning Formula E World Champion.

All about the race

The Qualifying race at the Miami E-Prix on Saturday was as unpredictable as it could be, especially for Nissan. The team’s Norman Nato took his first Formula E Julius Baer Pole Position for the 2025 Miami E-Prix as he competed with his former teammate Jake Dennis of Andretti for the top spot. Oliver Rowland, meanwhile, couldn’t do better than 16th position. Round 5 of the ABB FIA Formula E World Championship is being held at the picturesque Homestead-Miami Speedway .It was a narrow margin as Nissan’s Norman Nato completed the Qualifying session in 1:23.037, leaving Jake Dennis behind by just 0.129s and securing pole position. Dennis was also very close to António Félix Da Costa of TAG Heuer Porsche, who ended up in third place by a similarly slim margin. Robin Frijns of Envision Racing took fourth position, followed by Nyck de Vries in fifth.Qualifying on Saturday served up some of the biggest surprises as well. The most unexpected was Nissan’s in-form driver Oliver Rowland finishing 16th in Qualifying, as he had to abort his final lap due to an error at Turn 12. He has already won two of the four races this season.Sao Paulo E-Prix winner Mitch Evans of Jaguar TCS Racing also ended up in a less-than-impressive 14th position. Additionally, Jeddah E-Prix I winner Maximilian Günther of DS Penske came in last in Qualifying.Taylor Barnard of NEOM McLaren also faced disappointment.

The Miami E-Prix in Florida is set to bring the Homestead-Miami Speedway alive with the ultra fast electric race cars—combining high-octane entertainment with sustainability. As Formula E returns to this iconic circuit after a decade-long hiatus, race enthusiasts are eagerly anticipating high-speed action at the picturesque venue. Will Nissan’s Oliver Rowland and NEOM McLaren’s Taylor Barnard continue their season dominance at Miami, or will Jaguar TCS Racing’s Mitch Evans rise to the occasion with a win on U.S. soil? Only time will tell.The Miami E-Prix is one of only two single-header races remaining this season. The other is in Jakarta on June 21. Homestead-Miami Speedway is the fifth different venue in the USA to host a Formula E race—more than any other country.Saturday’s race will also mark the 137th race in Formula E history, and the 37th in the Gen3 Evo era. The new Gen3 Evo cars can hit 322 km/h and accelerate from 0 to 100 km/h in just 1.86 seconds—faster than a Formula 1 car.Interestingly, the winning margin in the final race of each weekend has been steadily increasing with 0.099s in Sao Paulo, 0.125s in Mexico and 0.286s and 0.439s in the Jeddah double header.Meanwhile, the polesitter has finished on the podium in the last three races, in stark contrast to the previous stretch where only 2 polesitters reached the podium in 12 races.When it comes to qualifying, Oliver Rowland and Maximilian Günther are the only drivers to have reached the duel stages in every round this season. In contrast, Nick Cassidy, David Beckmann, Nico Müller, Robin Frijns, Zane Maloney, Sébastien Buemi, and Lucas di Grassi have yet to reach the duels.NEOM McLaren is guaranteed a record no matter which of its drivers wins in Miami.

Formula E is now in its 11th season since its debut in 2014, and the electric motorsport has achieved impressive success, carving its own identity despite the dominance of Formula 1. One of the key indicators of this success is the growing grid of 11 teams and 22 drivers—one more than the 10 teams in F1. While drivers like Oliver Rowland and Pascal Wehrlein have previously tested their skills in F1, it seems they've found their true calling in the more sustainable and rapidly evolving Formula E.Oliver Rowland is currently leading the Formula E standings with 68 points, thanks to his victory at this season’s Mexico City E-Prix. Rowland had a brief stint with F1 team Williams in 2018 before transitioning to Formula E, where he raced for Mahindra Racing and then Nissan, ultimately making a name for himself with the Japanese team. Antonio Felix da Costa, driving for Porsche, is also a formidable force in the series. He currently sits in third place with 39 points this season, continuing to prove his prowess on the track.Maximilian Günther has made a strong impression after his move from Maserati MSG Racing to DS Penske. At the Jeddah E-Prix, Günther took pole position, posted the fastest lap, and ultimately clinched the victory. With this standout performance, he’s now eyeing an even higher position, currently sitting fourth in the driver standings.German driver Pascal Wehrlein, another former F1 racer, began his Formula E career with Mahindra Racing before joining Tag Heuer Porsche. After winning the Formula E World Championship last season, Wehrlein has maintained his strong form, registering the fastest lap in two races this season—at the São Paulo and Mexico City E-Prix. He’s currently in eighth place with 25 points but remains a serious contender with 7 career wins and 6 pole positions to his name.Mitch Evans, a consistent presence with Jaguar TCS Racing since 2016, continues to be among the best drivers in Formula E. He secured a win for Jaguar at the São Paulo E-Prix in December, propelling him to seventh in the standings with 25 points, keeping him in the mix for the championship.At just 20 years old, Taylor Barnard is quickly establishing himself as one of the brightest young talents in Formula E. Driving for McLaren, Barnard currently sits in second place with 51 points, proving that in just two years, he has more than earned his place among the series’ elite.",Formula E is now in its 11th season since its debut in 2014.

Who founded Formula E

All eyes are currently on Formula 1 , as the season kicked off last month in Australia. However, there's another motorsport series that deserves just as much attention—one that not only thrills but is also in tune with the global movement for sustainability. Enter Formula E, the FIA-recognized single-seater world championship. Like Formula 1, it showcases high-speed racing, but with a key distinction: it’s environmentally conscious. Formula E uses all-electric cars, offering a cleaner, greener alternative to traditional motorsports while also driving innovation in the electric vehicle sector.Formula E cars are smaller, lighter, and require far fewer tire changes over the course of the season, which helps minimize their environmental footprint. And if you’re wondering whether these electric racers can deliver the same level of excitement as Formula 1, consider this: the Generation 3 Formula E car can reach speeds exceeding 100 km/h, proving that sustainability and speed can indeed go hand in hand.The ABB FIA Formula E Championship is currently in its 11th season, with the next race—the Miami ePrix—set for April 12. The season will run until July 27, with many more thrilling races scheduled across the globe.Formula 1 has been around since 1950 and has only evolved into hybrid vehicles relying on fossil fuels like E10 fuel (a mix of 90% petrol and 10% renewable ethanol). In contrast, Formula E is the motorsport of the 21st century after coming into existence in 2014. These races feature all-electric cars that run on powertrains converting energy from a battery into motion.One of the most striking differences between the two sports is how the cars handle tire changes. In Formula 1, teams often swap tires multiple times during a single race due to varying track conditions. In Formula E, however, teams are only allowed to change tires twice throughout the entire championship. The tires used in Formula E are made from natural rubber and recycled fibers, and are specifically designed to perform well in all weather conditions.Despite this difference, Formula E is by no means inferior. While a Formula 1 car can reach speeds in excess of 350 km/h, the new Formula E Gen3 Evo can reach 322 km/h, but it can accelerate faster than a F1 car. It can go from 0-100 km/h in 1.86 seconds., faster than many Formula 1 cars.Although both series use the same chassis, battery, and tires, the real performance differences come from the powertrains provided by each team. There is one aspect where Formula 1 still holds an edge, primarily due to the electric car's battery limitations. As the battery depletes, an electric car loses speed, requiring a pit stop to recharge in a flash. A Formula 1 car, on the other hand, can maintain top speed even with a quarter tank of fuel.Additionally, Formula E cars must be kept light—around 284 kg for the battery, which accounts for one-third of the car's weight that’s fixed at 840 kg, including the driver.Despite the technical differences, Formula E has its own appeal. Even Red Bull driver Max Verstappen has acknowledged how difficult it can be to drive the RB21. In comparison, electric cars in Formula E are simpler, with single-speed transmission and no gear shifts necessary, unlike the multiple gears in a F1 car.Currently, Formula E features 11 teams, with 22 drivers. Unlike Formula 1, where the top speeds are often the focus, Formula E records are typically based on average race speeds. The fastest race in Formula E history took place in Cape Town in 2023, with an average speed of 132.2 km/h.Practice sessions are held on Friday and Saturday, lasting 30 minutes each, giving drivers a chance to fine-tune their performance.Qualifying: Drivers are split into two groups based on their championship standing. Each group has a 10-minute session to set the fastest lap at 300 kW. The top 4 from each group then advance to the ""duels"" stage, where drivers face off head-to-head at 350 kW in a series of quarter-finals, semi-finals, and a final. The winner of the final claims pole position.The top ten drivers receive points using the standard FIA system (25–18–15–12–10–8–6–4–2–1). The pole position winner earns an additional 3 points, while the driver setting the fastest lap (if they finish in the top ten) receives 1 point.Drivers can deploy a combined 8 minutes of Attack Mode during the race. It provides additional power, activated by driving through a designated area of the circuit off the racing line. All Attack Modes must be used before the end of the race.A new feature has been introduced this season. It requires all drivers to make a mandatory 30-second pit stop to recharge their car's batteries at 600 kW. This adds 3.85 kWh of energy (around 10% more) to be used for the remainder of the race.Formula E was founded by Spanish businessman Alejandro Agag, who serves as the company's Chairman, while Jeff Dodds is the Chief Executive Officer. Many may not realize that Warner Bros. Discovery is among its shareholders.","Formula E is the FIA-recognized single-seater world championship. Like Formula 1, it showcases high-speed racing, but with a key distinction: it’s environmentally conscious. Formula E uses all-electric cars, offering a cleaner, greener alternative to traditional motorsports.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-47529300,imgsize-110164,width-400,resizemode-4/47529300.jpg"

The current Formula E season is in full swing, fueling even more excitement for this electrifying motorsport, where cars now accelerate from 0-60 mph in a jaw-dropping 1.82 seconds. With 11 teams and 22 drivers battling it out across 16 races at 10 iconic global locations, the season will run through to July 27. Since its inception, the Nissan Formula E Team has led the charge, but a number of other teams are rapidly closing the gap in a sport that blends speed, innovation, and sustainability.All teams are currently using the Formula E Gen3 Evo cars fitted with Hankook tires. These cars can reach a top speed of 322 km/h—the fastest for any Formula E car—and accelerate even quicker than an F1 car. Needless to say, the Formula E fever is rapidly spreading among motorsport fans. Among the 11 teams, Nissan boasts 21 wins in 136 races, along with 50 podium finishes. Envision Racing, Jaguar TCS Racing , and Lola Yamaha ABT Formula E Team are also among the top contenders.Nissan recently added another victory to its impressive tally. Oliver Rowland steered the team to a win at Jeddah E-Prix II in February, marking their second victory of the season after the Mexico City E-Prix in January. Rowland is now joined by Norman Nato, who took a transfer from Andretti.Tag Heuer Porsche won the 2023–24 Formula E World Championship, thanks to Pascal Wehrlein. This year, he remains in top form, having recorded the fastest lap in two races. He has been joined by Antonio Felix da Costa, the Season 6 champion, who is also performing well, having won four out of five races last season. The team now has 12 wins and 25 podium finishes in 78 races.DS Penske is also having a strong season, with Maximilian Günther claiming a victory at the Jeddah E-Prix I after taking over as the lead driver. Günther dominated the weekend by securing pole position and recording the fastest lap. Jean-Éric Vergne, the other DS Penske driver, is expected to maintain his strong form this season.Jaguar TCS Racing started the season with a win. Mitch Evans led the team to victory at the São Paulo E-Prix in December. Both Evans and Nick Cassidy earned four wins last season, alongside multiple podium finishes and pole positions. The team now has 17 wins and 47 podium finishes in 115 races.Andretti Formula E Team has been around for a while, securing 11 wins and 37 podium finishes. Driver Jake Dennis continues to impress, and he is now joined by new addition Nico Mueller.Envision Racing is consistently among the top teams in Formula E, with 16 wins and 53 podiums in 136 races. Both drivers, Sébastien Buemi and Robin Frijns, are experienced and remain in top form.Neom McLaren has 8 wins and 29 podium finishes in 91 races. Taylor Barnard, who became the youngest driver in Formula E history at 19, is now a full-time driver for the team, alongside Sam Bird.Maserati MSG Racing has been taking a slower approach, with 10 wins and 28 podium finishes in 136 races. The team has added two new drivers: Jake Hughes and Stoffel Vandoorne.The team recently faced a setback when Nico Mueller moved to Andretti after contributing significantly to the team’s success. Lucas di Grassi, along with rookie Zane Maloney, is competing for the team this year. Lola Yamaha ABT has 14 wins and 47 podium finishes in 119 races.Mahindra Racing has yet to fully catch up with the competition, having secured only 5 wins and 24 podium finishes, despite competing alongside top teams like Nissan and Envision Racing. Nyck de Vries and Edo Mortara are driving for Mahindra Racing.Cupra Kiro is trailing behind in the competition, but there is hope for the team this season, as David Beckmann set the fastest lap at the São Paulo E-Prix. Dan Ticktum is the other driver for the team.","The current Formula E season is in full swing. 11 teams and 22 drivers are battling it out across 16 races at 10 locations.

Alcaraz had lost in the opening round on his only previous appearance at Monte Carlo in 2022 but returned stronger this year.“It’s been a really difficult week and a tough month for me, both on and off the court,” said Alcaraz. “I’m proud of how I dealt with everything.”Musetti, playing in his first Masters 1000 final, started brightly, rallying from an early break to take the opening set. However, the Italian began struggling with a leg issue early in the third set, requiring medical attention at 0-3. From that point, Alcaraz never looked back, sealing the decider without dropping a game.Despite the defeat, Musetti earned a rankings boost to World No. 11 and valuable experience ahead of the French Open . “It was probably one of my best tournaments so far,” he said. “I’m disappointed I couldn’t finish stronger, but I’ll come back for revenge.”Alcaraz will rise to World No. 2, overtaking Alexander Zverev, as the clay-court season intensifies. With Roland Garros on the horizon, his Monte Carlo triumph sets the tone for another strong title push.","Carlos Alcaraz wins first Monte Carlo Masters title.

Poll Who do you think will win the Monte Carlo Masters final? Lorenzo Musetti Carlos Alcaraz

Carlos Alcaraz secured his first Monte Carlo Masters final appearance by defeating fellow Spaniard Alejandro Davidovich Fokina 7-6 (7/2), 6-4 on Saturday. He will face 13th-seeded Italian Lorenzo Musetti , who overcame Australian eighth seed Alex de Minaur 1-6, 6-4, 7-6 (7/4) in the second semi-final.Four-time Grand Slam champion Alcaraz is seeking his first Masters title since his victory at Indian Wells last year. His only title this season came at the ATP 500 event in Rotterdam in February.""I knew how well Davidovich Fokina had played in Monte Carlo so I had to be ready to fight,"" said Alcaraz.""It's been a long time since I've had the chance to win a title on clay and I can't wait to try my luck again here,"" Alcaraz said, referencing his Olympic final loss to Novak Djokovic in August.""At the beginning of the week, the first tournament on clay, you have to get used to the conditions,"" he added. ""The ball comes different. You know, the play on clay is different... I'm just really happy to get the level that I wanted at the beginning of the week.""Alcaraz emerged as the tournament favourite following early exits by top seed Alexander Zverev and Novak Djokovic, while world number one Jannik Sinner remains suspended due to a doping ban.""The first question, you know, since Jannik was unable to play tournaments, a lot of people were asking me and talking about, how important (the) moment that I have ahead is to reach the number one (ranking) again or to win tournaments or whatever,"" Alcaraz said. ""I was thinking so much about it instead of playing my good tennis and enjoy the time that I have, stepping on the court and playing matches.""The 21-year-old Spaniard started strongly against world number 42 Davidovich Fokina, securing an early break. However, Davidovich Fokina fought back to level at 5-5 before losing the first-set tiebreak 7/2.Alcaraz broke early again in the second set and maintained his advantage despite Davidovich Fokina saving 13 break points and four match points.In the other semi-final, Musetti overcame a difficult start where he lost all four service games in the first set. The Italian regained his composure in the second set, breaking De Minaur in the ninth game.The decisive third set saw multiple service breaks before heading to a tiebreak, where Musetti prevailed on his first match point when De Minaur hit a forehand into the net.""It means so much. Honestly, it's unexpected,"" said Musetti, who will enter the world's top 10 if he wins the final. ""If I look back where we started, at the beginning of the week, I was of course dreaming to be in final and to have the chance to play for the top 10, for the title, for a lot of things.""The final will be a rematch between Alcaraz and Musetti, with the Spaniard winning their last three encounters. However, Musetti won their only previous final meeting in Hamburg in 2022.""For sure the key of that match was the mental part,"" added Musetti. ""So hopefully tomorrow I'll do the same.""The match represents a significant milestone for both players, with Alcaraz seeking his first clay court Masters title since Indian Wells and Musetti appearing in the biggest final of his career.","Carlos Alcaraz beats Alejandro Davidovich Fokina 7-6 (7/2), 6-4 in Monte Carlo Masters semi-final.

Sunrisers Hyderabad:

Mumbai Indians:

Riding on Will Jacks ' all-round performance, Mumbai Indians defeated Sunrisers Hyderabad by four wickets with 11 balls remaining in Match No. 33 of the Indian Premier League (IPL) at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai on Thursday.Jacks provided Mumbai Indians with crucial breakthroughs by removing the dangerous Travis Head and Ishan Kishan with his off-spin.""Pretty happy. Three lefties in the top, so knew I had a chance to bowl. Definitely some turn. Some grip for the seamers. Sunrisers saw us bowl, we'll do the same thing. We need to be smart and chase the score down. We had a clear plan,"" Jacks told broadcasters during the mid-innings break.""I was informed yesterday I would be bowling. The coach and the captain gave me the confidence. So, I kept going. I think we are happy with the target. We saw it was difficult at the top. Hopefully, we will see it off at the top, take it deep and chase it down.""This was Mumbai Indians' second consecutive victory. The home team dominated the match, finding much-needed momentum.Hardik Pandya's decision to bowl first on a slightly damp pitch proved effective. At the toss, Hardik Pandya said the decision was based on the possibility of dew playing a role later in the match.""Very excited, the way the last couple of days have gone,"" he said, adding that they are backing all their batters. ""Bumrah is fine, we don't have to worry about him. If he wasn't 100%, he wouldn't be here.""Mumbai Indians' pace attack immediately troubled Sunrisers Hyderabad's usually explosive openers. Despite an early dropped catch off Abhishek Sharma, he managed to find boundaries while Travis Head struggled for timing.The duo added 59 runs before Pandya dismissed Abhishek for a 28-ball 40, a dismissal that came at a cost as Pandya briefly injured his ankle. This injury scare followed Karn Sharma's earlier exit, who injured his bowling hand in the third over and did not return. Will Jacks then removed both Ishan Kishan and the struggling Travis Head, who scored a laborious 28 off 29 balls.Nitish Kumar Reddy's innings faltered, but Heinrich Klaasen 's late surge provided SRH with some much-needed impetus. Klaasen particularly targeted Deepak Chahar, whose initial spell was strong but faltered in his final over. Aniket Verma and Pat Cummins contributed crucial late runs, pushing Sunrisers Hyderabad's total to 162/5 in 20 overs.Interestingly, Sunrisers Hyderabad are the only team yet to register an away win in this year's edition.162/5 in 20 overs (Abhishek Sharma 40, Heinrich Klaasen 37; Will Jacks 2-14, Jasprit Bumrah 1-21)166/6 in 18.1 overs (Will Jacks 36, Ryan Rickelton 31, Rohit Sharma 26; Pat Cummins 3/26)",Mumbai Indians beat Sunrisers Hyderabad by four wickets in IPL T20 match.

Poll Should a warning be given to keepers for having their gloves in front of the stumps? No, it's not necessary Only in certain situations Definitely

Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) spinner Varun Chakravarthy has raised questions over a controversial ""no-ball"" call during the Mumbai Indians vs Sunrisers Hyderabad match at the Wankhede Stadium on Thursday.In the seventh over of the match, Mumbai Indians opener Ryan Rickelton was dismissed by leg-spinner Zeeshan Ansari, with Pat Cummins taking an easy catch at cover.However, the drama unfolded when the fourth umpire stopped Rickelton near the boundary rope, and the delivery was called a no-ball.The third umpire found that wicketkeeper Heinrich Klaasen had his gloves in front of the stumps when the ball made contact with the bat. Rickelton received a free-hit, but he failed to capitalize on it.The third umpire's decision was not appreciated by Varun Chakravarthy.""If the keeper's gloves come in front of the stumps, it should be a dead ball and a warning to the keeper so that he doesn't do that again!!! Not a no-ball and a free hit!! What did the bowler do? Thinking out loud!! What do you all think???"" he wrote on X.However, Rickelton was dismissed in the next over as Harshal Patel deceived him with a slower delivery. He scored 31 off 23 balls.Mumbai Indians defeated Sunrisers Hyderabad by six wickets with eleven balls to spare.Earlier, Sunrisers, who had successfully chased 246 in their previous match against Punjab Kings at home, failed to get going and ended up with a below-par score of 162/5.Sunrisers' next opponent will be Mumbai again on April 23 in Hyderabad.

Mitchell Starc's late heroics, including a crucial yorker and composed final over, forced the Super Over after Rajasthan faltered in their chase of 189.

Here's the updated IPL 2025 points table after the thriller in Delhi:

NEW DELHI: Delhi Capitals climbed back to the top of the Indian Premier League 2025 points table with a thrilling Super Over win against Rajasthan Royals at the Arun Jaitley Stadium on Wednesday. This marked DC's fifth win in six matches, taking them to 10 points — two clear of second-placed Gujarat Titans (8 from 6).Meanwhile, the loss deepened RR’s woes, as they languish at eighth with just two wins in seven games.In a high-octane contest, both teams fought tooth and nail, but it was Mitchell Starc ’s late brilliance that swung the match DC’s way. Rajasthan, chasing 189, were off to a flying start with Yashasvi Jaiswal and skipper Sanju Samson adding 61 runs in just 5.3 overs. However, Samson pulled up with a rib injury after smashing a four and a six, retiring hurt in visible pain.Despite the setback, Nitish Rana and Jaiswal kept the Royals in the hunt. But as DC’s spinners tightened the screws, the equation got steeper — 73 required off the last six overs. Starc returned to dismiss the well-set Rana with a peach of a yorker, and with just 9 needed in the final over, the Aussie held his nerve to force a Super Over.Rajasthan managed 11/2 in the Super Over but two quick run-outs derailed their momentum. DC, needing 12, saw KL Rahul and Tristan Stubbs finish the job with two balls to spare, sealing a memorable win and the top spot.Delhi Capitals currently sit atop the IPL 2025 points table after six games, securing five wins and one loss to accumulate 10 points and a net run rate (NRR) of +0.744.Trailing by two points are Gujarat Titans, boasting an impressive +1.081 NRR from four wins in six fixtures (W-W-W-W-L). Third place belongs to Royal Challengers Bengaluru, also on eight points but with a slightly lower NRR of +0.672 after a 4-2 record.Punjab Kings and Lucknow Super Giants share eight points as well, occupying fourth and fifth spots respectively. While Punjab’s NRR stands at +0.172, Lucknow’s is +0.086, reflecting tight contests in their seven matches. Both sides have displayed resilience with alternating wins and losses in recent games.In mid-table, Kolkata Knight Riders have six points (3-4) and a +0.547 NRR, whereas Mumbai Indians, Rajasthan Royals, Sunrisers Hyderabad, and Chennai Super Kings sit in the lower half with four points each. They will be keen to climb the standings as the tournament progresses.Next up, Delhi Capitals face a tough test against Gujarat Titans, while Chennai Super Kings look to bounce back against Mumbai Indians. As the race for playoffs intensifies, every match and NRR will matter.","Delhi Capitals secured a thrilling Super Over victory against Rajasthan Royals.

AXAR'S FIRST WICKET OF IPL 2025

NEW DELHI: In trouble? Call Mitchell Starc . That’s exactly what Axar Patel did when things got tense. With just 9 runs to defend in the final over, he turned to his strike bowler — and Starc delivered.Yorker after yorker, Starc kept the pressure high and the fans on edge. Dhruv Jurel and Shimron Hetmyer managed to survive the heat but couldn’t find the boundaries needed. The match ended in a thrilling tie, pushing the contest into the first Super Over of IPL 2025 .Starc returned for the Super Over, taking the ball once again with ice in his veins. Rajasthan Royals managed just 11 runs, setting Delhi Capitals a target of 12.Enter KL Rahul and Tristan Stubbs , with Sandeep Sharma bowling.Rahul started with a couple, followed it up with a crisp boundary, and handed over the strike after a single. Stubbs needed no second invitation — he launched Sandeep into the stands, sealing a dramatic win for Delhi Capitals.It was their first win at home this season, and it took them right back to the top of the table. As the players celebrated, the ‘Dilli re, Roar Macha!’ anthem echoed through the Kotla — a perfect end to a pulsating night of cricket.Tension was palpable in the Rajasthan Royals dugout. Sanju Samson wore a frustrated look behind the stumps as Sandeep Sharma — one of their most trusted bowlers at the death — lost his rhythm when it mattered the most. Tasked with bowling the final over, Sandeep’s six legal deliveries stretched into a chaotic 11-ball over: Wd 0 Wd Wd Wd N1 4 6 1 1 1 — a rare meltdown from the usually reliable pacer.Delhi Capitals finished their innings at 188/5, and the mood in their camp was upbeat. Smiles lit up their dugout, with players clearly satisfied with what looked like a competitive total.Opener Abishek Porel, who set the tone early with the bat, sounded confident in the mid-innings chat with the broadcasters.""The plan was to go hard in the powerplay which would make it easier later on. If you bowl slower, it is helpful on this wicket and hopefully our bowlers do well. A very good total on this wicket,"" he said.But Rajasthan Royals had other ideas.They came out all guns blazing, dismantling Delhi’s bowling attack from the outset. Yashasvi Jaiswal set the tone with a brisk 51, while Sanju Samson, before retiring hurt on 31, ensured the momentum stayed firmly in Rajasthan’s corner.And then came Nitish Rana, who played a stunning knock of 51 off 28 balls to give a big home but star pacer Starc pulled things back in Delhi's favour.When the match headed into a Super Over, Sandeep found himself in the spotlight once again — a chance at redemption after a forgettable final over.But pressure mounted, and history repeated itself.Sandeep struggled to hold his nerve, failing to apply any real pressure. Delhi Capitals chased down the target in just four deliveries, sealing a memorable win and leaving Sandeep with another tough outing to reflect on.""Bhaiya, plain t-shirt hai ya kissi player ke naam wali jersey?"" — a curious fan asked a t-shirt vendor stationed outside the Arun Jaitley Stadium, just an hour and a half before the Delhi Capitals vs Rajasthan Royals clash.The seller replied, ""Sirf KL Rahul ki hai."" One fan bought it. Then another. Soon, a line of eager customers formed, each asking for different sizes, as the buzz around KL Rahul gripped the scene outside the stadium.Interestingly, the jersey bore the Delhi Capitals colours, but had ""KL Rahul"" and the number 01 printed on the back — a curious sight, yet a clear sign of the mania surrounding the star batter.Inside the Kotla, it was a vibrant sea of blue and red.The atmosphere reached a crescendo when the stadium DJ dropped the ""Dilli re, Roar Macha!"" anthem — and right on cue, KL Rahul cleared his front leg to send a slot ball from Tushar Deshpande soaring over long-off. The crowd erupted.Rahul's knock was entertaining, albeit not blistering. He scored 38 runs off 32 deliveries before falling to Jofra Archer — notably, the first time Archer managed to dismiss Rahul in IPL history.And he showed his composure in the Super Over too, delivering under pressure and giving fans a treat to watch.""We perhaps got too casual in the middle phase,"" admitted Axar Patel after Delhi Capitals’ unbeaten run was halted by Mumbai Indians in their previous outing.Before the clash against Rajasthan Royals, a quick glance at Axar's IPL 2025 stats painted a worrying picture: 67 runs, 0 wickets in 5 matches — far from the impact expected from the captain and star allrounder.Trolled heavily for throwing his wicket away against Mumbai, Axar walked out to a mix of pressure and expectation. But amidst loud chants of ""Bapu! Bapu!"" echoing around the Kotla, he responded like a true leader — smashing a fiery 34 off just 14 balls, laced with four boundaries and two sixes.The crowd, however, erupted when he made an impact with the ball. Coming in just when his team needed a breakthrough, Axar cleaned up Riyan Parag for 8 — his first wicket of IPL 2025. The dismissal came at a crucial juncture, especially after Sanju Samson had to retire hurt on 31.Axar had finally delivered with both bat and ball — and the Kotla faithful made sure he knew it.","Delhi Capitals beat Rajasthan Royals in the first Super Over of IPL 2025.

WHAT ARE THE RULES ON BAT SIZES?

NEW DELHI: Rajasthan Royals’ Riyan Parag was at the center of a rare interruption during the IPL 2025 match against Delhi Capitals at the Arun Jaitley Stadium, as he was forced to change his bat moments before taking strike.Coming in to bat in place of the injured Sanju Samson, Parag was halted by the on-field umpire for a routine bat gauge check. The bat failed to meet the required specifications, leading to a brief but animated exchange between the batter and the official. Despite his protest, Parag had no option but to change his bat before resuming play.A video capturing the incident has gone viral on social media, showing the exact moment the bat was tested and Parag’s visible displeasure upon learning it didn’t pass.However, the change in equipment didn’t bring a change in fortune. Parag managed just 8 runs from 11 balls before being dismissed.This incident adds to a growing list of players flagged for bat regulation breaches this season. Earlier, KKR's Sunil Narine and Anrich Nortje were also made to replace their bats after similar checks by match officials.According to IPL 2025 regulations, bats must adhere to strict dimensions: a maximum width of 10.79 cm, blade thickness of up to 6.7 cm, edge thickness not exceeding 4 cm, and a total length capped at 96.4 cm.With enforcement tightening, players and franchises are being reminded that compliance with equipment standards is non-negotiable this season.The umpires are checking the bats as part of BCCI protocol which aims to prevent players from gaining unfair advantages in an era of aggressive powerhitting.The BCCI has authorised IPL match officials to inspect any bat they consider necessary during live games, marking a significant change from previous seasons where such checks were confined to dressing rooms.The ICC regulations stipulate specific bat dimensions. The bat face width must not exceed 4.25 inches (10.79 cm), while the middle of the bat thickness is limited to 2.64 inches (6.7 cm). The edge width cannot be more than 1.56 inches (4 cm), and the bat's total height from handle to base must not exceed 38 inches (96.4 cm).","Rajasthan Royals’ Riyan Parag forced to change his bat moments before taking strike.

NEW DELHI: In a dramatic moment during Kolkata Knight Riders ' (KKR) Indian Premier League 2025 clash against Punjab Kings (PBKS) in Mullanpur, Sunil Narine's bat failed the official gauge test — highlighting the BCCI's recent clampdown on oversized bats during live IPL matches.The incident occurred just before KKR began their unsuccessful chase of PBKS' modest 112-run target.Also See: DC vs RR Reserve umpire Saiyed Khalid conducted random checks outside the playing area, where Narine and fellow KKR batter Angkrish Raghuvanshi stood together. While Raghuvanshi's bat passed the standard test, the thickest part of Narine's bat couldn't slide through the house-shaped gauge, violating ICC's prescribed bat size limits.Despite the bat drama, Narine had a mixed outing — claiming 2 for 14 with the ball but managing just 5 runs with the bat. Raghuvanshi top-scored for KKR with 37 off 28, yet the team crumbled from 62 for 2 to 95 all out.A second bat-related interruption came in the 16th over when Anrich Nortje was stopped by on-field umpires Mohit Krishnadas and Saidharshan Kumar. Nortje's bat also failed the gauge test, prompting substitute Rahmanullah Gurbaz to rush in with a replacement. However, the match ended before he could face a ball, as Andre Russell was dismissed immediately.These live checks mark a shift in BCCI protocol, with bat dimensions now scrutinised mid-match to prevent players from gaining illegal advantages through oversized blades. While previously done in dressing rooms, this season has seen on-field checks involving several players, including Shimron Hetmyer, Phil Salt, and Hardik Pandya.The ICC allows a maximum bat face width of 10.79 cm, blade thickness of 6.7 cm, edge width of 4 cm, and overall length of 96.4 cm.","Kolkata Knight Riders' Sunil Narine's bat failed the official gauge test.

'I was under pressure': SRH's Abhishek Sharma after a record 141 against Punjab Kings

MUMBAI: This match, irrespective of which team wins, should be a treat for Mumbai’s fans. Abhishek Sharma is back at the Wankhede, the venue where he smashed that fabulous 54-ball 135 against a stunned England at the Wankhede Stadium in early Feb this year.What’s more, he is fresh off an equally murderous 55-ball 141 which helped the Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) chase down Punjab Kings’ 246 with ease in Uppal. Needless to say, hosts Mumbai Indians (MI) have a massive challenge on their hands when they face SRH on Thursday night.Perhaps burdened by the weight of huge expectations since that scintillating century against England, the 24-year-old was groping for runs at the start of the IPL, getting out for scores of 24, 6, 1, 2, and 18. Then he exploded against PBKS to register the highest-ever individual score by an Indian batter in the IPL.MI will look to control the damage from Abhishek and his equally destructive opening partner Travis Head by unleashing their ace seam bowling duo, Jasprit Bumrah and Trent Boult. Both Abhishek and Head like to pounce on the new ball, but attacking Boult, who has a habit of striking in the Powerplays, and Bumrah, won’t be straight forward.Abhishek, Head and South African ’keeper bat Heinrich Klaasen form the engine room of the SRH batting lineup. But MI will also have to deal with an insider. Ishan Kishan , who was an integral part of the franchise since 2018, and was let go by MI, will be having a point to prove. And he knows the Wankhede inside out.Ishan had a stunning debut for SRH, smashing a blazing 106 not out off just 47 balls against Rajasthan Royals, but since then his form has dipped. Conversely, MI have someone in their lineup who was on the SRH rolls once: Karn Sharma Playing his first match of the season, the experienced leggie took 3/36, including the crucial wickets of the in-form KL Rahul and Tristian Stubbs, to help Mumbai pull off a heist against DC in the last match. If Karn and Kiwi left-arm spinner Mitchell Santner, whose brilliant delivery castled a well-set Karun Nair and changed the course of the last match, combine well again, MI will be difficult to beat.Two SRH bowlers who will be marked men will be Uttar Pradesh’s impressive young leg-spinner Zeshan Ansari, who has taken four wickets in four matches at 35.25 (ER 9.40), and Sri Lankan seamer Eshan Malinga. Taking 2/45 on his debut in four overs in a high-scoring match, Eshan managed to impress Lasith Malinga.The Sri Lankan fastbowling great posted on X after watching him: “Well bowled, Malinga!” MI will no doubt be rejuvenated after their comefrom-behind win against the Delhi Capitals in their last match on Sunday.","Abhishek Sharma is back at the Wankhede, the venue where he smashed that fabulous 54-ball 135 against a stunned England in early Feb this year.

Rajat Patidar-led Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) will lock horns against Shreyas Iyer's Punjab Kings (PBKS) in Match No. 34 of the Indian Premier League (IPL) at the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bengaluru on Friday. RCB are currently placed at the third position, whereas Punjab are at fourth.As a team, Punjab will be high on confidence after their 16-run win over KKR in a recent low-scoring thriller. But they will be well aware that RCB, which has depth in batting and bowling, will be a harder opponent to overcome.Two former RCB players, Yuzvendra Chahal and Glenn Maxwell, will have noticed Bengaluru batters' struggle against slow bowlers R Sai Kishore, Kuldeep Yadav, and Vipraj Nigam in Bengaluru. RCB mentor Dinesh Karthik mentioned after their loss against Delhi Capitals that the Chinnaswamy pitch was surprisingly on the slower side, and both Chahal and Maxwell will be eager to exploit that.Chahal, fresh from his four-wicket haul against Kolkata Knight Riders, is a master of lengths rather than of ""magic balls."" The leg-spinner lures with offerings wide of off-stump, and the batters need to reach out to the ball for big hits, often resulting in catches in the deep.After RCB's consecutive losses, Dinesh Karthik hinted that the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium pitch has not delivered what the team management desires. “In the first two games, we have asked for good pitches. But it’s turned out in this way where it’s been challenging to bat on for sure. So we try and do the best with whatever we get,"" Karthik had said. “This is not a pitch that’s helping the batters too much. It’s a challenging pitch. That has been the case in both the games that we have played."" The Chinnaswamy Stadium pitch has historically been a batter's paradise, but in this year's IPL, it has been a bit tricky. When asked if the RCB team management will follow up with the curator, Karthik replied, “We will obviously have a chat with him, and we trust him to do his job.”Phil Salt, Virat Kohli, Devdutt Padikkal, Rajat Patidar (c), Liam Livingstone, Jitesh Sharma (wk), Tim David, Krunal Pandya, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Josh Hazlewood, Yash DayalSuyash SharmaPriyansh Arya, Prabhsimran Singh, Shreyas Iyer (c), Josh Inglis (wk), Nehal Wadhera, Glenn Maxwell, Shashank Singh, Marco Jansen, Xavier Bartlett, Arshdeep Singh, Yuzvendra ChahalYash Thakur331617The forecast for Friday indicates that the sky will be mostly clear.

Abhishek Sharma (40 off 28) gave them a strong start, while Heinrich Klaasen (37 off 28) anchored the innings in the middle.However, despite some late hitting from Aniket Verma (18 off 8), the total looked below par.

Poll Do you agree with the BCCI's decision to lift the ban on saliva as a ball-polishing agent? No, it should remain banned. Yes, it's a positive move for the game.

NEW DELHI: The Indian Premier League (IPL) has witnessed a significant development this season with the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) lifting the ban on using saliva as a ball-polishing agent.This decision was made after several captains expressed their support for the move, as it was previously prohibited during the COVID-19 pandemic as a precautionary measure.The reintroduction of saliva as a ball-polishing agent has reignited discussions around the art of reverse swing , a skill that has been largely forgotten in recent times.However, Bhuvneshwar Kumar , the fast bowler for Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB), has offered a different perspective on the matter.In a candid admission, Bhuvneshwar revealed that he had forgotten about the revised rules allowing the use of saliva until the team staff reminded him.""I forgot that I can use saliva. Yesterday when the (team) staff told me, I didn't know that I have to use it,"" he said. ""I am not sure if it will help or not, but now that I remember, definitely in tomorrow's match (vs PBKS), I will put some saliva and see if it helps or not.""While Bhuvneshwar remains uncertain about the potential benefits of using saliva, he acknowledged the importance of exploring its impact on the ball's behaviour.On the other hand, some of Bhuvneshwar's contemporaries have eagerly embraced the opportunity to revive the art of reverse swing. Mitchell Starc , the fast bowler for Delhi Capitals , showcased a glimpse of reverse swing during their match against Rajasthan Royals on Wednesday.His remarkable accuracy and the touch of reverse swing played a crucial role in Delhi Capitals' victory in the Super Over.Nitish Rana, a Rajasthan Royals player, acknowledged Starc's exceptional skill, stating that executing 11 yorkers out of 12 balls at a pace of 145 kmph while generating reverse swing deserves immense credit.""Reverse swing had completely gone away from cricket, whether it was red ball or white ball. Suddenly, if someone can execute 11 yorkers in 12 balls at a 145 (kmph) pace, then you have to give Starc the credit,"" Nitish added.Delhi's captain, Axar Patel, also praised Starc's ability to execute his plans under pressure, saying, ""Getting reverse swing is one thing, but executing it is very important. It was reversing, but at that time, under pressure, he (Starc) was executing it. I was just reminding him to be clear about the plans we made in the bowlers meeting. I was getting the same response: 'Don't worry, skip. I'll do it.'""",IPL has witnessed a significant development this season with the ban on using saliva as a ball-polishing agent lifted.

NEW DELHI: Fresh off one of the standout performances of IPL 2025 , Punjab Kings leg-spinner Yuzvendra Chahal showed his cheeky side on social media, taking a playful dig at teammate Nehal Wadhera by calling him a ""mistri spinner"", which was a humorous twist on the term mystery spinner.The nickname came after Wadhera attempted his version of spin bowling in a practice session, prompting Chahal to jokingly question his technique.The banter came just a day after Chahal delivered a match-winning spell against Kolkata Knight Riders , picking up 4/28 and helping PBKS pull off a stunning 16-run win while defending just 111 runs, one of the lowest totals defended in IPL history.With this performance, Chahal equalled Sunil Narine ’s record for the most four-wicket hauls in IPL (8) and became the bowler with the most four-fors against a single team, achieving his third such haul against KKR.His wickets included key scalps like Ajinkya Rahane, Rinku Singh, and Angkrish Raghuvanshi, causing KKR to collapse from a comfortable 62/2 to 95 all out.Chahal's milestone-rich evening didn’t end there.He also moved to 370 T20 wickets, surpassing Mohammad Nabi and Mohammad Amir to claim 11th spot on the all-time T20 wicket-takers list.

NEW DELHI: Arsenal secured a historic 2-1 victory against Real Madrid at the Santiago Bernabeu on Wednesday, advancing to the Champions League semifinals for the first time since 2009 with a 5-1 aggregate score.The match featured crucial VAR interventions in two penalty decisions, with Arsenal maintaining their impressive first-leg advantage of 3-0 from London.Arsenal will now face Paris Saint-Germain in the semifinals, while Inter Milan, who defeated Bayern Munich, will meet Barcelona in the other semifinal matchup.Real Madrid, the defending champion and 15-time European winner, failed to produce one of their trademark comebacks at the Bernabeu, falling short of the last four for the first time since 2020.""There was a lot of talk coming here about (Real Madrid) coming back, because they've done it so many times before, but we had so much belief and confidence from that first game to come here and win the game,"" said Arsenal's Declan Rice, who had scored twice in the first leg through free kicks. ""We knew we were going to suffer, but we knew we were going to win. We had it in our minds and now we've done it in real life.""The match's momentum shifted early when VAR overturned a penalty for Real Madrid following a hold on Kylian Mbappé, after a five-minute review with the score at 0-0.Arsenal had earlier missed their own VAR-awarded penalty when Bukayo Saka failed to convert from the spot.Saka later redeemed himself by scoring in the 65th minute after receiving a pass from Mikel Merino, though Madrid quickly equalized through Vinícius Júnior following a defensive error by William Saliba.Gabriel Martinelli sealed Arsenal's victory with a stoppage-time goal, assisted by Merino.""This is one of the best nights in my football career, for sure,"" Arsenal coach Mikel Arteta said. ""It's a really special one against a team that has been an inspiration for a lot of us in this competition.

""We tried but in the end we couldn't achieve our goal. We'll come back stronger. Madrid always does.""Real Madrid's task was challenging from the outset, facing an Arsenal team that hadn't lost by a three-goal margin in nearly three years. Only four teams in Champions League history had overcome a three-goal first-leg deficit at home.The match began with early drama as Madrid had a goal disallowed after two minutes when Mbappé was caught offside.Arsenal maintained their unbeaten record against Real Madrid, extending it to four matches, including their previous Champions League knockout stage victory in 2005-06.The game featured significant VAR involvement, with Arsenal's penalty awarded after review showed Raúl Asencio holding Mikel Merino during a corner kick.Another VAR review led to the reversal of Madrid's penalty claim after initially being awarded for a hold on Mbappé by Rice.The victory marks Arsenal's return to the Champions League semifinals after a 15-year absence, with their last appearance ending in elimination by Manchester United in 2008-09.",Arsenal defeat Real Madrid 2-1 in Champions League quarterfinals.

NEW DELHI: Diego Maradona 's daughter Dalma Maradona testified in court on Tuesday in San Isidro, Argentina, stating that her father's death in November 2020 could have been prevented if his medical team had provided proper care following his brain surgery. The seven-person medical team faces up to 25 years in prison for alleged negligence in the football legend's final days.Maradona passed away at age 60 while recovering at home from surgery to remove a blood clot in his brain. The cause of death was determined to be heart failure and acute pulmonary edema, a condition where fluid builds up in the lungs.""If they had done their job, this would have been avoided,"" Dalma Maradona, 38, told the court. ""They deceived us in the cruelest way.""The medical team, including physician Leopoldo Luque, is charged with ""homicide with possible intent"" for allegedly knowing their actions could lead to their patient's death.Dalma testified that Dr. Luque had insisted home hospitalization was ""the only option"" and promised 24-hour care with an ambulance on standby.""It never happened,"" she said. ""It was a house where, occasionally, a doctor would come to see him.""She described finding the house in deplorable conditions after her father's death, stating it was ""disgusting, and it smelled like urine.""Dalma also revealed she had attempted to visit her father days before his death but was denied entry by his lawyer and an assistant.Prosecutors allege Maradona endured a ""prolonged, agonizing period"" before his death, having battled cocaine and alcohol addiction for decades.The trial, which had faced delays, is expected to continue until July with nearly 120 witnesses scheduled to testify.The defendants are accused of abandoning their patient and pursuing a course of action despite knowing it could result in his death.","Dalma Maradona testified in court on Tuesday in San Isidro, Argentina, stating that her father's death in November 2020 could have been prevented if his medical team had provided proper care.

Kolkata: Is Jose Molina ’s Mohun Bagan Super Giant the best team in Indian Super League ’s 11-year-old history?Finishing the 2024-2025 season with a remarkable Shield-Cup double, with record-breaking 19 wins and 52 goals, Mohun Bagan have set a benchmark for other teams to emulate. It’s perhaps ideal for them to complete the double with a come-from-behind 2-1 win over Bengaluru FC at their boisterous fortress — the Salt Lake Stadium — which was brought to its feet in game after game in salute of a genuinely special team at play and its repertoire of promise and panache.History will remember Sergio Lobera ’s Mumbai City FC as the first team to do the ISL double when, backed by the financial and technical might of the City Football Group which owns Man City, they achieved the target in Goa in 2020-2021 at a time when the world was existing in a bubble.Molina’s Bagan, in a way, made the real noise. Like Mumbai City of five seasons ago, they too have had a strong financial backing from principal team owner Sanjiv Goenka. Like Lobera’s side, Molina’s team also has had the strongest squad in the league. Bagan’s ascent to a triumphant finish to the league, many believe, looked destined before the season started rolling.Of course, Lobera’s FC Goa in 2019-20 and Des Buckingham’s Mumbai City in 2022-2023 were special in their own rights, but there was also a lingering lament that both these teams failed to explore their full potentiality.True that football, just like life, doesn’t always follow scripts of one’s liking. Credit to Molina for turning his team into a winning machine running on the engine of consistency, character and never-say-die mentality.Take for example the Spaniard’s use of substitutions in the second half here on Saturday, bringing Ashique Kuruniyan and Sahal Abdul Samad in place of an off-colour Liston Colaco and an ineffective Anirudh Thapa.“Sahal and Ashique had their moment in the final. You need great players on the bench who can wait for their moment and change the game,” Molina said after the match. “But at the end of the day, there’s no secret to success. It’s all about hard work and belief,” the Bagan coach pointed out.","Mohun Bagan beat Bengaluru FC to complete the ISL Shield and Cup double. Jose Molina’s Bagan, in a way, made the real noise.

Liverpool moved within touching distance of the Premier League title after a dramatic 2-1 win over West Ham at Anfield on Sunday, thanks to a late header from captain Virgil van Dijk . The result, coupled with Tottenham 's 2-4 defeat to Wolves, widened Liverpool’s lead at the top to 13 points over second-placed Arsenal with just six matches remaining.The Reds rebounded from a stuttering run of form — including defeats to Fulham, Newcastle and Paris Saint-Germain — with a gritty performance. Mohamed Salah ignited Liverpool’s charge in the 18th minute with a brilliant run from halfway, sliding a perfectly timed ball to Luis Diaz , who tapped in from close range.Though an unfortunate own goal from Andy Robertson — deflecting off Van Dijk — briefly pegged Liverpool back in the 86th minute, redemption followed swiftly. Van Dijk rose to meet Alexis Mac Allister’s corner just three minutes later, sealing a vital victory.“In the 18th minute, Mohamed Salah sprinted away on the halfway line, accelerating towards the West Ham area and caressing a perfectly weighted pass to Diaz, who had the simple task of slotting home from six yards,” the club noted.Liverpool could secure their 20th English league championship as early as April 20 if they defeat Leicester and Arsenal slip up at Ipswich.Elsewhere, Tottenham’s domestic woes deepened as Wolves cruised to victory at Molineux.

(An El Clasico fan pens his experience of watching some of his favourite footballers in action)

MUMBAI: A balmy Mumbai evening turned into a time capsule on Sunday a week back as Barcelona and Real Madrid legends rekindled one of football’s fiercest rivalries.While the scoreline read 2-0 in favour of the Real Madrid Leyendas, the night was much more than just goals. It was a celebration of football’s enduring legacy.Fans at the DY Patil Stadium in Navi Mumbai may not have filled every seat, but those in attendance were treated to a surreal experience.FIFA World Cup and UEFA Champions League winners graced the pitch. Xavi Hernandez , Rivaldo , Carles Puyol for Barcelona, and Luis Figo , Fernando Morientes, and Michael Owen for Madrid.Though older and past their competitive prime, the skill, footballing IQ, and passion were unmistakably intact.The match saw Morientes strike early with a trademark finish in the 15th minute, followed by David Barral doubling Madrid’s lead midway through the second half.Despite the deficit, Barça responded with composure and flair, orchestrated by Xavi and spearheaded by a lively Rivaldo.Phillip Cocu made his long-awaited return in a Blaugrana jersey, while Javier Saviola - who sported colours for both clubs in his playing days - added bursts of energy. Yet, the Catalans couldn’t find the finishing touch.On the Madrid side, the ball gravitated towards Figo, who looked sharp and determined, still very much the heart of Los Blancos.Every touch from the Portuguese legend was met with thunderous cheers or emphatic boos, depending on the fan allegiance, proof that the rivalry, though friendly in nature, still runs deep.What stood out beyond the game was the atmosphere in the stands. Indian fans, many of whom grew up idolising these players, sang, waved club banners, and relived memories from a golden era.Despite the rivalry, camaraderie was in abundance.Barca and Madrid fans shared stands, clicked pictures for each other, and engaged in healthy banter, a rare sight for a fixture historically defined by tension.While the match saw passionate attendance, the reach was limited: advertising, ticket pricing, and scheduling played a role.For such events to serve as a launchpad for football’s growth in India, there is a need for broader awareness, grassroots engagement, and structured interaction between legends and local players or coaches.Ultimately, Mumbai witnessed more than a match.It was a reminder of football’s power to inspire and unite. It was an evening where legends walked again and a generation of fans got a glimpse of their heroes not through screens, but in the flesh.","A week ago in Mumbai, football legends from Barcelona and Real Madrid reignited their rivalry in an exhibition match.

Kolkata: If winning is a habit, trust Mohun Bagan SG to make it a magical monotony at home this season.Let them face the biggest of challenges, let them have all sorts of odds stacked against them and let them be forced to trail with a title at stake. But invariably and unflinchingly, expect Jose Molina’s men to find a way out of the crisis and have the last laugh. Bengaluru FC learnt this in quite a compelling way at the Salt Lake Stadium. Gerard Zaragoza’s visitors were welcomed to the Bagan’s formidable fortress with a giant tifo from the home fans — “Champion’s home, entry prohibited.”Yet they silenced the thunderous crowd when Alberto Rodriguez was forced into conceding an own goal while dealing with Ryan Williams’ centre in the 49th minute.Jason Cummings’ penalty in the 72nd minute and Jamie Maclaren’s poacher’s goal six minutes into the first half of extra time were all Bagan required to script a turnaround in a 2-1 win here on Saturday and become the second team after Mumbai City FC to complete the Indian Super League double.A year ago, Bagan lost a similar opportunity to Mumbai City at the same place. But this season they seemed to be a different beast, assuming a juggernaut crushing one opponent after another at home to stretch their winning run to 14 matches. Two months after sealing their back-to-back Shield, they deservedly lifted the ISL Cup in front of 59,112 spectators.It’s quite a journey for Molina’s men. Nine months ago, BFC inflicted the heaviest defeat on them (0-3), putting Molina’s Bagan project under serious question mark. Now claiming the double at BFC’s expense should come as completion of a circle for the winners.Bagan began in a way culled straight from their playbook, setting the alarm bells ringing in the all-Indian rival defence with some trademark moves from the wings. Having somehow managed to weather that storm, BFC started to establish a more recognizable rhythm. BFC duly and deservedly went ahead soon after the restart. It started with another incisive run from Ryan Williams down the right and the Australian delivered an inviting cross. Rodriguez ended up miskicking it into his own.Molina sought intervention from the bench. The introduction of Ashique Kuruniyan and Sahal Abdul Samad brought pace and panache to the attack. When Cummings swivelled to take aim, it looked destined for a goal but Gurpreet denied him. But BFC caved in to Bagan’s constant pressure.As Maclaren tried to get past Chinglensana Singh following Cummings’ centre, the ball touched the BFC centre-back’s hands, forcing referee Senthil Nathan to point to the spot. Cummings made no mistake in beating Gurpreet.Maclaren then provided the coup de grace.",Mohun Bagan beat Bengaluru FC 2-1 to complete the ISL Shield and Cup double.

He faced a penalty for misuse of the Attack Mode and was disqualified from the race, while Pascal Wehrlein of TAG Heuer Porsche was declared the winner. However, the decision was soon changed, with Nato being pushed back to sixth position, bringing a slight breather for the Nissan driver.Nato had been missing from the scene ever since the terrible fate he suffered at the iconic Homestead-Miami Speedway.

Formula E is now in its 11th season since its debut in 2014, and the electric motorsport has achieved impressive success, carving its own identity despite the dominance of Formula 1. One of the key indicators of this success is the growing grid of 11 teams and 22 drivers—one more than the 10 teams in F1. While drivers like Oliver Rowland and Pascal Wehrlein have previously tested their skills in F1, it seems they've found their true calling in the more sustainable and rapidly evolving Formula E.Oliver Rowland is currently leading the Formula E standings with 68 points, thanks to his victory at this season’s Mexico City E-Prix. Rowland had a brief stint with F1 team Williams in 2018 before transitioning to Formula E, where he raced for Mahindra Racing and then Nissan, ultimately making a name for himself with the Japanese team. Antonio Felix da Costa, driving for Porsche, is also a formidable force in the series. He currently sits in third place with 39 points this season, continuing to prove his prowess on the track.Maximilian Günther has made a strong impression after his move from Maserati MSG Racing to DS Penske. At the Jeddah E-Prix, Günther took pole position, posted the fastest lap, and ultimately clinched the victory. With this standout performance, he’s now eyeing an even higher position, currently sitting fourth in the driver standings.German driver Pascal Wehrlein, another former F1 racer, began his Formula E career with Mahindra Racing before joining Tag Heuer Porsche. After winning the Formula E World Championship last season, Wehrlein has maintained his strong form, registering the fastest lap in two races this season—at the São Paulo and Mexico City E-Prix. He’s currently in eighth place with 25 points but remains a serious contender with 7 career wins and 6 pole positions to his name.Mitch Evans, a consistent presence with Jaguar TCS Racing since 2016, continues to be among the best drivers in Formula E. He secured a win for Jaguar at the São Paulo E-Prix in December, propelling him to seventh in the standings with 25 points, keeping him in the mix for the championship.At just 20 years old, Taylor Barnard is quickly establishing himself as one of the brightest young talents in Formula E.

The current Formula E season is in full swing, fueling even more excitement for this electrifying motorsport, where cars now accelerate from 0-60 mph in a jaw-dropping 1.82 seconds. With 11 teams and 22 drivers battling it out across 16 races at 10 iconic global locations, the season will run through to July 27. Since its inception, the Nissan Formula E Team has led the charge, but a number of other teams are rapidly closing the gap in a sport that blends speed, innovation, and sustainability.All teams are currently using the Formula E Gen3 Evo cars fitted with Hankook tires. These cars can reach a top speed of 322 km/h—the fastest for any Formula E car—and accelerate even quicker than an F1 car. Needless to say, the Formula E fever is rapidly spreading among motorsport fans. Among the 11 teams, Nissan boasts 21 wins in 136 races, along with 50 podium finishes. Envision Racing, Jaguar TCS Racing , and Lola Yamaha ABT Formula E Team are also among the top contenders.Nissan recently added another victory to its impressive tally.

Who founded Formula E

All eyes are currently on Formula 1 , as the season kicked off last month in Australia. However, there's another motorsport series that deserves just as much attention—one that not only thrills but is also in tune with the global movement for sustainability. Enter Formula E, the FIA-recognized single-seater world championship. Like Formula 1, it showcases high-speed racing, but with a key distinction: it’s environmentally conscious. Formula E uses all-electric cars, offering a cleaner, greener alternative to traditional motorsports while also driving innovation in the electric vehicle sector.Formula E cars are smaller, lighter, and require far fewer tire changes over the course of the season, which helps minimize their environmental footprint. And if you’re wondering whether these electric racers can deliver the same level of excitement as Formula 1, consider this: the Generation 3 Formula E car can reach speeds exceeding 100 km/h, proving that sustainability and speed can indeed go hand in hand.The ABB FIA Formula E Championship is currently in its 11th season, with the next race—the Miami ePrix—set for April 12. The season will run until July 27, with many more thrilling races scheduled across the globe.Formula 1 has been around since 1950 and has only evolved into hybrid vehicles relying on fossil fuels like E10 fuel (a mix of 90% petrol and 10% renewable ethanol). In contrast, Formula E is the motorsport of the 21st century after coming into existence in 2014. These races feature all-electric cars that run on powertrains converting energy from a battery into motion.One of the most striking differences between the two sports is how the cars handle tire changes. In Formula 1, teams often swap tires multiple times during a single race due to varying track conditions. In Formula E, however, teams are only allowed to change tires twice throughout the entire championship. The tires used in Formula E are made from natural rubber and recycled fibers, and are specifically designed to perform well in all weather conditions.Despite this difference, Formula E is by no means inferior. While a Formula 1 car can reach speeds in excess of 350 km/h, the new Formula E Gen3 Evo can reach 322 km/h, but it can accelerate faster than a F1 car. It can go from 0-100 km/h in 1.86 seconds., faster than many Formula 1 cars.Although both series use the same chassis, battery, and tires, the real performance differences come from the powertrains provided by each team. There is one aspect where Formula 1 still holds an edge, primarily due to the electric car's battery limitations. As the battery depletes, an electric car loses speed, requiring a pit stop to recharge in a flash. A Formula 1 car, on the other hand, can maintain top speed even with a quarter tank of fuel.Additionally, Formula E cars must be kept light—around 284 kg for the battery, which accounts for one-third of the car's weight that’s fixed at 840 kg, including the driver.Despite the technical differences, Formula E has its own appeal. Even Red Bull driver Max Verstappen has acknowledged how difficult it can be to drive the RB21. In comparison, electric cars in Formula E are simpler, with single-speed transmission and no gear shifts necessary, unlike the multiple gears in a F1 car.Currently, Formula E features 11 teams, with 22 drivers. Unlike Formula 1, where the top speeds are often the focus, Formula E records are typically based on average race speeds. The fastest race in Formula E history took place in Cape Town in 2023, with an average speed of 132.2 km/h.Practice sessions are held on Friday and Saturday, lasting 30 minutes each, giving drivers a chance to fine-tune their performance.Qualifying: Drivers are split into two groups based on their championship standing. Each group has a 10-minute session to set the fastest lap at 300 kW. The top 4 from each group then advance to the ""duels"" stage, where drivers face off head-to-head at 350 kW in a series of quarter-finals, semi-finals, and a final. The winner of the final claims pole position.The top ten drivers receive points using the standard FIA system (25–18–15–12–10–8–6–4–2–1). The pole position winner earns an additional 3 points, while the driver setting the fastest lap (if they finish in the top ten) receives 1 point.Drivers can deploy a combined 8 minutes of Attack Mode during the race. It provides additional power, activated by driving through a designated area of the circuit off the racing line. All Attack Modes must be used before the end of the race.A new feature has been introduced this season. It requires all drivers to make a mandatory 30-second pit stop to recharge their car's batteries at 600 kW. This adds 3.85 kWh of energy (around 10% more) to be used for the remainder of the race.Formula E was founded by Spanish businessman Alejandro Agag, who serves as the company's Chairman, while Jeff Dodds is the Chief Executive Officer. Many may not realize that Warner Bros. Discovery is among its shareholders.","Formula E is the FIA-recognized single-seater world championship.

Tokyo:

Pune: For Indian women’s tennis team captain Vishaal Uppal , it was “mission accomplished” after his team secured their World Group Playoff berth in the Billie Jean King Cup .“At the start, I sent the team a message saying our mission is Project Playoff. And it’s mission accomplished,” Uppal said on Saturday after India beat South Korea 2-1 in their last round-robin match to finish in the top two in Asia-Oceania Group 1 .“We have just proven when we become ‘We’, what we can achieve. It’s truly amazing. I know I was tough on them this week. I pushed them. But we had Project Playoff. It was a team effort,” said the former Davis Cupper.Shrivalli Rashmikaa played a stellar role as she won all her five singles matches, but Uppal emphasised on the team bonding, which he said played a vital role in lifting the Hyderabad girl’s performance. “She beat a lot of higher ranked players this week,” he said.“We’re playing a team competition, and for her to come out and perform like that, I think the credit has to go to the entire team,” he said. “When Shrivalli beat (Hong Yi) Cody Wong (of Hong Kong) the other day and Ankita ran on to the court and hugged her. That says a lot.” Ankita Raina played her part in the team’s success, combining with fellow senior Prarthana Thombare , to clinch the decisive doubles rubber against Korea. “It was deja-vu for me. When it became one-all against Korea, I remembered the mindset I had in Dubai for doubles, and tried to keep that momentum,” she said, referring to the last time India advanced to the playoffs in 2020.“And we were aggressive because as we all know that in doubles, the momentum can change quickly,” she said, adding, “We really came together. We are traveling and playing by ourselves, but there’s this one week every year when we come together as a team.”Prarthana, Asian Games doubles bronze medallist with Sania Mirza in 2014, hit the winning shot — a sizzling forehand service return down the line. And she was modest about it all.“Sahaja (Yamalapalli) and Shrivalli were fighting their hearts out. And it gives us the confidence,” the 30-year-old from Barshi said. “As much as it is ours, it is each and every person who wants to play tennis. It’s their win as well.”Ena Shibahara and Shuko Aoyama defeated Kayla Cross and Rebecca Marino 6-3, 5-7, 6-2 in the decisive doubles match to secure Japan a spot in the Billie Jean King Cup Finals on Sunday.The BJK Cup Finals will be played in Shenzhen in September.","India beat South Korea 2-1 in their last round-robin match to finish in the top two in Asia-Oceania Group 1.

Alcaraz wins

Monte Carlo Masters

Carlos Alcaraz had an outstanding start to his clay-court season last week, clinching the Monte Carlo title on Sunday for the first time in his career.After missing this Masters 1000 event last year, he earned the full 1,000 ranking points when he beat Lorenzo Musetti in the final, elevating his total from 6,720 to 7,720 points.As a result, Alcaraz moves one place in the latest ATP rankings (April1 4), moving up from No. 3 to No. 2, surpassing Alexander Zverev, who lost his first match in Monte Carlo this year. Zverev’s ranking points drop from 7,645 to 7,595, causing him to fall one place.This marks Alcaraz's first return to the Top 2 since October 28 last year, when he was also ranked No. 2; he had spent 23 consecutive weeks at No. 3 since then. Overall, this is his 89th week in the Top 2, with 36 weeks at No. 1 and 53 weeks at No. 2.Alcaraz also narrows the gap between him and current No. 1 Jannik Sinner, who is suspended presently, from 3,610 points (10,330 to 6,720) to 2,210 points (9,930 to 7,720).Sinner missed Monte Carlo while defending semi-final points as he serves a three-month suspension for two failed dope tests last year. Although Alcaraz can’t overtake him before Sinner returns on the tour in Rome, winning both Barcelona and Madrid in the coming weeks could reduce that gap to just 720 points, putting the No. 1 ranking within reach in Italy.In addition to Alcaraz and Zverev's place swap, there was movement elsewhere in the ATP Top 10: Alex de Minaur made the biggest jump, climbing from No. 10 to No. 7 — just one spot shy of his career-high of No. 6 — after reaching the semifinals of his second Masters 1000 event.Andrey Rublev also rose from No. 9 back to No. 8, while Daniil Medvedev returned to the Top 10 after being outside for two weeks, moving from No. 11 to No. 9. This marked the 2021 US Open champion's first absence from the elite group in over two years, dating back to February 2023.Meanwhile, Musetti closed in on a Top 10 debut, climbing from No. 16 to No. 11 — surpassing his previous career - high of No. 15 — after reaching the finals of his first Masters 1000 event. He’s now just 15 points behind the No. 10-ranked Ruud, with scores of 3,215 to 3,200.""I'm just really happy to have won Monte Carlo for the first time,"" Alcaraz said. ""It's been a really difficult week with a lot of difficult situations. I'm really proud of myself, how I've dealt with everything. It's been a really difficult month for me on the court and outside. Coming here and seeing how the whole hard work has paid off, I'm really happy.""This victory represents Alcaraz's first clay court success since his French Open triumph last season, with his only other clay court appearance resulting in a silver medal at the Paris Olympics.Musetti, appearing in his first Masters 1000 final after defeating top 10 players Stefanos Tsitsipas and Alex de Minaur, started strongly but faced physical challenges as the match progressed.The Italian received medical treatment for his right leg when trailing 0-3 in the final set, though he continued to play despite the injury.""It is not the way I would have wanted to win a match,"" Alcaraz said. ""Lorenzo's been through a really tough week, long and intense matches. I feel sorry for him, one of the best results he has done. To end like this is not easy. Hopefully it's not serious and he's 100 percent soon.""""It was probably one of my best tournaments so far,"" Musetti said, who won bronze at last year's Olympics behind Alcaraz and gold medalist Novak Djokovic. ""I'm disappointed I couldn't finish the match in the best way, for the crowd. You deserve it so I will keep going and try and come back for revenge.""The match began with Musetti dropping his opening service game but immediately breaking back and taking the first set, capitalising on Alcaraz's six unforced errors.Alcaraz's game improved significantly in the second set, which he won convincingly before completing the victory with a dominant final set.Both players will continue their clay court preparations at the Barcelona Open next week as they build toward the French Open at the end of May.","Carlos Alcaraz won the Monte Carlo Masters for the first time in his career. He beat Lorenzo Musetti in the final, earning the full 1,000 ranking points. He moves up from No. 3 to No. 2, surpassing Alexander Zverev.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120268962,imgsize-60052,width-400,resizemode-4/Carlos-Alcaraz-Monte-Carlo-champion-Reuters.jpg"

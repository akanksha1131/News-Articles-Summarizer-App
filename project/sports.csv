Poll Who was the standout bowler for the West Indies on Day 1 of the third test? Shamar Joseph Justin Greaves Jayden Seales

The West Indies dominated Australia on day one of the day-night third test at Sabina Park in Kingston, Jamaica on Saturday. The hosts' pace attack, led by Shamar Joseph's four wickets, bowled out Australia for 225 before finishing at 16-1 at stumps after surviving a tense final hour against Mitchell Starc and Pat Cummins Shamar Joseph took 4-33, while Justin Greaves and Jayden Seales claimed three wickets each as the West Indies pacers capitalized on favorable seam and pitch conditions under lights.Sam Konstas, the 19-year-old Australian, continued his difficult tour as he fell lbw to Greaves for 17 off 53 balls in the opening session after Australia won the toss and chose to bat.Usman Khawaja struggled for 23 runs from 92 balls before being caught spectacularly by wicketkeeper Shai Hope off Shamar Joseph's bowling.Cameron Green and Steven Smith provided some resistance with a 61-run partnership, scoring 46 and 48 respectively, but both fell short of their half-centuries.Australia's middle order collapsed as Travis Head (20), Webster (1), and Alex Carey (21) were dismissed cheaply once the lights came on and the ball started moving significantly.Seales returned to dismiss Cummins for 24, who was caught in the deep attempting his third six of the over.Starc was dismissed for a duck in his 100th test match.Shamar Joseph completed his four-wicket haul by removing Josh Hazlewood, as Australia lost their final seven wickets for just 68 runs.""Every pitch has been tough,"" Green said after play. ""It was a real grind. Usman batted well and never looked in. Steve Smith looked like he batted on a different pitch again. We wanted to give them a tricky 45 minutes at the end and I thought they batted beautifully.""The West Indies faced a challenging period under lights with King and Anderson opening, as Mikyle Louis and John Campbell were unavailable after being injured while fielding.Starc, playing his 100th test match, claimed his 396th test wicket by bowling Anderson for 3, leaving him just four wickets short of 400 career wickets.Captain Chase and King survived several close calls to guide the hosts to stumps at 16-1, maintaining their advantage after day one.Australia made significant changes to their lineup, dropping spinner Nathan Lyon for the first time in 12 years and opting for an all-pace attack with Scott Boland joining Cummins, Starc, and Hazlewood.The West Indies recalled left-arm spinner Jomel Warrican in place of fast bowler Anderson Phillip, breaking up their all-pace attack from the previous test in Grenada.Opening batsman Kraigg Brathwaite was dropped after his 100th test following poor performances in the series, with scores of 4, 4, 0, and 7. Louis replaced him while Anderson made his debut at number three, taking Keacy Carty's spot.Mitchell Starc became the 16th Australian to reach the milestone of 100 test matches.Australia leads the series 2-0 after winning in Barbados by 159 runs and in Grenada by 133 runs, having already secured the Frank Worrell Trophy.","West Indies dominate Australia on day one of third test in Kingston.

KL Rahul press conference: On last over fight, Rishabh Pant run out and fired up Shubman Gill

Poll Do you believe India can win the match from this position? Yes, definitely No, it's unlikely It depends on the next innings

KL Rahul's gritty century helped India match England's first innings total of 387 on Day 3 of the third Test at Lord’s, marking only the ninth time in Test history that both teams have posted identical scores in their first innings. At 387 apiece, this also becomes the fifth-highest such total, and each of the four higher ones ended in a draw.The previous instances of higher identical totals include:In the ongoing match, India’s 387 came through attritional and disciplined batting. Rahul made a superb 100 off 177 balls, becoming only the second Indian after Dilip Vengsarkar to score multiple centuries at Lord’s. Rishabh Pant added 74, battling a painful finger injury, while Ravindra Jadeja contributed 72 in typically composed fashion.India’s lower order hung around but struggled to lift the scoring rate on a slow surface that is beginning to misbehave. With uneven bounce and some turn on offer, the challenge of batting last looms large.Tempers flared just before stumps when Zak Crawley delayed facing Jasprit Bumrah, prompting Shubman Gill and the Indian skipper to confront him, adding an edge to an already intense contest.With England leading by just two runs and two days remaining, the stage is set for a tense finish. Historically, teams involved in 390-plus identical totals have never lost. India will hope that pattern continues at a venue where Rahul has once again left his mark.","India match England's first innings total of 387 on Day 3 of the third Test at Lord's.

Poll Do you believe AI like ChatGPT can compete with top human players? Yes, they can compete No, humans have the edge

World No. 1 Chess grandmaster Magnus Carlsen shared couple of screenshots of him beating OpenAI 's ChatGPT with sheer dominance. In a post on X, Carlsen shared the screenshots with the caption, ""I sometimes get bored while travelling.""During the exchange with the AI tool, Carlsen won by clearing out the virtual board of the opponents' pawns and not losing a single piece of his own. The tool analysed further, ""That was methodical, clean and sharp. Well played!""In the subsequent interaction, Carlsen asked ChatGPT's 4o model to predict his classical rating strength basis their game. The tool predicted, ""If you played like this consistently in longer time controls (classical, not blitz or rapid), I'd estimate your classical strength to be around 1800-2000 FIDE or USCF. Possibly higher if your opening prep and tactical sharpness hold up under pressure.""Unfortunately, the openAI model was well of base. Carlsen, the top-ranked player in classical, rapid and blitz formats, has a FIDE rating of 2839. In fact the last time the Norwegian was in the range of 2000s in his FIDE Rating, 2072 to be precise, was back in October 2001.Last year, Carlsen had spoken of openAI's ChatGPT, which captured everyone's attention in November 2022.“AI was extremely exciting at first because it presented a little bit of a different way to play chess, in more of a hybrid human engine way. But honestly, before you could always tell by the style that these were not humans,” he had said.“Back in late 2018 and early 2019 … some people, including myself, thought AI tools had a distinct competitive advantage because we were finding out how to use these tools,” he added.“Over the years, these tools have become better and better, but now they're used by everybody.

Poll Who do you think has had a more impactful start to their career at Lord's? Shubman Gill Virat Kohli

Cricket has a way of connecting moments across time. On Friday at Lord’s, Shubman Gill was dismissed for 16, caught by the wicketkeeper. A soft edge off Chris Woakes did the trick. It was a clever setup from England, knowing Gill tends to bat outside his crease. The moment felt ordinary — until someone checked the archives.Exactly 13 years ago, on 11 September 2011, a young Virat Kohli played his first ODI at Lord’s. He too scored 16 runs, and was also dismissed caught by the keeper.The similarities are uncanny. Both knocks came on the 11th of the month. Both ended on 16. Both batters, at different stages in their careers, walked off to the same Lord’s applause. Kohli was just starting out in England. Gill, leading India in a Test for the first time at the venue, arrived already in red-hot form.Also Read: Shubman Gill mirrors Virat Kohli's career: From U-19 to Test captaincy records -coincidences aplenty The format may have been different — ODI for Kohli, Test for Gill — but the symmetry remains hard to ignore.Earlier in the day, Jasprit Bumrah earned a spot on the honours board with a five-wicket haul. His spell in the morning broke the back of England’s innings as they were bowled out for 387. Joe Root scored his eighth Test hundred at Lord’s, while Jamie Smith and Brydon Carse added useful runs down the order.In reply, India ended Day 2 on 145 for 3, with KL Rahul unbeaten on 58.

Iga Swiatek and Amanda Anisimova will face each other in the 2025 Wimbledon women's final on Saturday, ensuring an eighth consecutive first-time winner at the prestigious tournament. Both players have reached their first-ever Wimbledon final through unexpected paths, with no player managing to defend the title since Serena Williams claimed her seventh crown in 2016.Pre-tournament favourite Aryna Sabalenka, who had reached the previous three Grand Slam finals, was eliminated in a tense semi-final match by American 13th seed Anisimova.Poland's Swiatek, seeded eighth at Wimbledon, has shown improved form recently, climbing to fourth in the rankings after reaching the Bad Homburg grass-court tournament final.The 24-year-old Swiatek has quietly progressed through the tournament, losing just one set en route to the final while other top seeds faltered. She demonstrated her newfound grass-court prowess by defeating Olympic champion Belinda Bencic 6-2, 6-0 in the semi-finals.""Honestly, I never even dreamed that it's going to be possible for me to play in the final,"" Swiatek said. ""So I'm just super-excited and proud of myself and, I don't know, tennis keeps surprising me. I've been enjoying just this new feeling of being a bit more comfortable on grass.""Swiatek has an impressive record in Grand Slam finals, winning all five of her previous appearances, with four victories at Roland Garros and one at the 2022 US Open.Anisimova, 23, secured her final spot with a surprising 6-4, 4-6, 6-4 victory over Sabalenka. Her journey to the final is particularly remarkable following an eight-month mental health break in 2023 that saw her ranking drop outside the top 400.""If you told me I would be in the final of Wimbledon, I would not believe you. It's indescribable to be honest,"" Anisimova said.""I think it goes to show that it is possible. I think that's a really special message that I think I've been able to show because when I took my break, a lot of people told me that you would never make it to the top again if you take so much time away from the game.""The American, whose parents emigrated from Russia in the 1990s, has shown strong form this year, winning the Qatar Open and reaching the Queen's Club final. Her Wimbledon performance will guarantee her first-ever top 10 ranking when updated on Monday.While the finalists have never met on the professional circuit, they played once as juniors, with Swiatek emerging victorious.""I did lose that match against her, unfortunately,"" Anisimova recalled. ""I remember a lot of coaches were saying that she's going to be a big deal one day. Obviously they were right. I'm sure it will be an amazing match. Getting to compete against an unbelievable player again is going to be super special.""Semi-final: def. Belinda Bencic (Switzerland) 6-2, 6-0Quarter-final: def.

Poll How important do you think family support is for players during long tours? Very Important Somewhat Important Not Very Important Not Important at All

NEW DELHI: Former India cricketer Suresh Raina has strongly criticised the BCCI 's decision to bar players' families from accompanying them on overseas tours, calling it unfair and detrimental to players' mental well-being.Earlier this year, following India's Test series loss to Australia, the BCCI issued a revised 10-point guideline that included restrictions on family presence during foreign tours. While the policy was reportedly aimed at maintaining focus and discipline, it has drawn criticism from several quarters - with Raina being one of the most vocal.Speaking to YouTuber Ranveer Allahbadia, Raina said, ""It is very important to have family on tours. BCCI has taken a big decision that family is not allowed – I'm against this. You are sending them to a tour for two months… family should be allowed. It's not that they (family) are against the players, they (also) would want us to score runs and the country to win.""He stressed that having family around offers essential emotional support, especially during tough phases in a cricketer's career. ""You do have mental health issues.When you are going through a lean phase and there's an army gunning for your spot, then such issues crop up. You fear being dropped. When chips are down, you need someone to talk to. When you're happy, you seldom need anyone. But when you're down, you fear talking thinking this may end up reaching the coach or the captain,"" Raina explained.He added that players often hesitate to speak up about mental health struggles due to fear of repercussions. ""So out of hesitation, players don't speak out,"" he said.""Imagine Virat Kohli playing, his daughter clapping – it's such a proud moment. He will set the stage on fire,"" Raina concluded, underscoring how family presence can boost morale and performance.",Former India cricketer Suresh Raina has strongly criticised the BCCI's decision to bar players' families from accompanying them on overseas tours.

Joe Root press conference: On India's ball complaints, his stunning catch, Rishabh Pant and more

Poll Should players be allowed to check the ball as often as they want? Yes, it's part of the game. No, it disrupts the flow of the game.

The Dukes ball has come under heavy scrutiny from players and media alike throughout the Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy. The debate resurfaced during the third Test at Lord’s when Shubman Gill was repeatedly seen approaching the umpire to have the ball checked. The umpires were frequently seen putting the ball through the gauge—sometimes it was rejected, sometimes replaced. This process played out several times during the first session, largely due to the ball losing its shape.In fact, on Day 2 morning alone, the Dukes ball was changed twice. After a 10-over-old ball was replaced, the Indian players still expressed their dissatisfaction, prompting another change within minutes.Even before the Lord’s Test, captain Shubman Gill and wicketkeeper Rishabh Pant had voiced their concerns about the Dukes ball going soft and losing shape far too often.Amidst the controversy, England’s Joe Root appeared to take a subtle jab at India, saying that teams must learn to adapt to the challenge.""The summer has been hot, the squares are harder. No two balls are the same. You’ve got to adapt and take it as a challenge, not keep asking for a change,"" Root said after the day's play.Root, who followed up his century with a record-setting catch, played a key role alongside Jofra Archer—who made a successful return with a wicket—as England dominated Day 2.England posted 387 in their first innings, and in reply, India reached 145 for 3 at stumps, trailing by 242 runs.""I think it’s a good score. It’s already hot, dry, and very slow. We have crucial runs on the board. There’s always something to work with here… even if the ball goes soft,"" Root added.",The Dukes ball has come under heavy scrutiny from players and media alike throughout the Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy.

Why Shubman Gill, Jasprit Bumrah lost their cool in last five minutes of Day 3 vs England

Poll Who do you think will have the upper hand in the remaining days of the match? India England

A heated exchange erupted between England and India at Lord's cricket ground on Saturday when England opener Zak Crawley 's apparent time-wasting tactics prevented India from bowling their final over of the day. The incident occurred after India was dismissed for 387, matching England's first-innings total in the third Test match.The controversy began when Crawley repeatedly stepped away from his batting stance and called for medical attention after minimal contact with his glove, allowing only six deliveries from Jasprit Bumrah before stumps.The situation escalated when Indian captain Shubman Gill directed angry words at Crawley, which went viral on social media. ""Show some fu*g b**s,"" yelled Gill as the right-hander did all he could to deny India an over from the pavilion end, prompting Sky Sports to issue an on-air apology. Both players pointed fingers at each other, with England's Ben Duckett joining the confrontation.""I'm not sure what they were complaining about when Gill was lying down getting a massage in the middle of the day yesterday,"" said Tim Southee , England's bowling consultant, who pointed out similar delays from India's side, including Washington Sundar's apparent comfort break during batting.When questioned about Crawley's condition, Southee responded: ""He'll be assessed overnight. Hopefully he'll be alright to carry on tomorrow.""Indian opener KL Rahul , who achieved his tenth Test century and second at Lord's, expressed his understanding of the situation. ""Two overs is a no-brainer with six minutes to go,"" he said. ""But it was a bit of theatrics at the end. I know exactly what was going on; everyone knows exactly what was going on. But an opening batter will understand completely what happened in the last five minutes.""Former England captain Michael Vaughan, now a BBC pundit, commented on the incident: ""It's as good a piece of time-wasting as I've ever seen.

His knock was laced with 14 boundaries and two sixes and laid the foundation for India in his Youth Test debut.Mhatre shared a 173-run partnership for the second wicket with Vihaan Malhotra, who chipped in with a composed 67.Later, Abhigyan Kundu and Rahul Kumar put the England bowlers under further pressure with aggressive batting. Kundu smashed 90 off 95 balls with 10 fours and a six, while Kumar blazed his way to 85 off just 81 balls, hitting 14 boundaries and a six. Their 179-run stand for the fifth wicket came in only 27.4 overs, propelling India close to the 400-run mark.For England, Archie Vaughan—son of former captain Michael Vaughan—picked up two wickets, including that of Mhatre, with his off-breaks. However, Vaughan Jr. endured a tough day overall, as Indian batters attacked him relentlessly.It was a dominant batting display by India U-19, setting the tone early in the multi-day clash.","India U-19 captain Ayush Mhatre scores 102 in opening day of Youth Test against England.

Today, there was good energy from both sides.”India’s innings was highlighted by a classy 100 from KL Rahul and gritty contributions from Ravindra Jadeja (72) and Rishabh Pant (74), the latter dismissed in dramatic fashion by a direct hit from Ben Stokes.With England leading only by two runs and the series finely poised, the final two days promise gripping cricket – and possibly more fireworks.","Tensions flared late on Day 3 of the third Test between India and England at Lord's.

When it's India vs England, drama is never too far—and Day 3 of the third Test at Lord’s was no exception. After India were bowled out for 387, six minutes of play remained in the day. Looking to make early inroads, India aimed to squeeze in at least two overs. Jasprit Bumrah wasted no time and took the new ball to open the attack.Bumrah bowled the first two deliveries, but England opener Zak Crawley appeared to take extra time between balls. Bumrah didn’t look pleased, seemingly suspecting time-wasting tactics.Tensions escalated when, just as Bumrah began his run-up for the third delivery, Crawley pulled out at the last moment. The Indian players were visibly agitated. Shubman Gill , unable to contain his frustration, was heard shouting, ""Show some f**ing b**s.""But the drama didn’t end there.A few balls later, Bumrah struck Crawley on the gloves with a sharp delivery. Crawley showed discomfort and called for the physio. In response, the Indian players broke into sarcastic applause—a gesture that added to the already tense atmosphere.The day ended with England at 2 for no loss, replying to India’s first-innings total of 387 on a see-sawing Day 3. At stumps, Zak Crawley was unbeaten on 2, while Ben Duckett had yet to score.Earlier, KL Rahul’s stylish 100, along with valuable contributions from Rishabh Pant (74) and Ravindra Jadeja (72), helped India match England’s first-innings total. Rahul’s 177-ball effort made him only the second Indian batter after Dilip Vengsarkar to score multiple centuries at Lord’s.Pant and Rahul added 141 for the fourth wicket before Pant was run out by Ben Stokes at the stroke of lunch. Jadeja later combined with debutant Nitish Reddy (30) to add 72 runs for the sixth wicket, giving India a crucial edge in the contest.","India were bowled out for 387 on Day 3 of the third Test at Lord's.

NEW DELHI: A day after the Indian Super League (ISL) announced it was putting the 2025–26 season on hold due to uncertainty over the renewal of the Master Rights Agreement (MRA), the All India Football Federation (AIFF) on Saturday acknowledged the ISL’s importance in the country’s football ecosystem but stressed that it must also abide by the law of the land.The existing MRA between the AIFF and Football Sports Development Limited (FSDL), which runs the ISL, is set to expire on December 8 this year—by which time the league would be well into its third month.On Friday, FSDL stated that without a confirmed contractual framework beyond December, it was unable to ""effectively plan, organise, or commercialise the 2025-26 ISL season"" and had decided to put the season on hold.In response, the AIFF issued a statement saying it would make every effort to ensure the league’s continuity, in line with legal obligations.""The AIFF is conscious of the importance of the ISL not only to the football structure in the country, but also to all the clubs, players, support staff, officials and fans, and also recognises the challenges and difficulties posed due to its disruption. At the same time, AIFF respects the law of the land and the direction of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India,"" the federation said in a statement.Acting on a directive from the Supreme Court, the AIFF has been instructed not to finalise any new terms of the MRA with FSDL until the Court delivers its verdict in the case related to the AIFF’s draft constitution.The AIFF clarified that discussions with FSDL had begun in a timely manner and proposals had been exchanged, but further negotiations were paused following the Court’s order.""As per the Master Rights Agreement, the All India Football Federation had, in a timely manner, first initiated the process of requesting negotiations on the terms of a potential renewal with FSDL on November 21, 2024. Thereafter, senior representatives of the AIFF and FSDL convened meetings on February 5, 2025, in New Delhi and subsequently on March 5, 2025, in Mumbai, to discuss the terms of potential renewal of the Master Rights Agreement.""Following these deliberations, a proposal was submitted by FSDL on March 5, 2025, to which, AIFF responded with a counter-proposal on April 21, 2025. Soon after, the AIFF was advised by its legal counsel that during a hearing on April 26, 2025, the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India made an observation that the renewal of the Master Rights Agreement should not be done until its order.""""Consequently, based on legal advice, discussions between the AIFF and FSDL, renewal discussions have been in abeyance pending further directions from the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India.""Despite the current impasse, the AIFF assured all stakeholders that their interests would be safeguarded and Indian football would remain unaffected.""The AIFF and its stakeholders will take all possible steps, and do all things within their power, to ensure continuity of the ISL in the best interests of Indian football. We request the understanding of all stakeholders in the interim,"" the statement added.FSDL, AIFF’s commercial partner, had signed a 15-year MRA in 2010. Under this agreement, FSDL pays the AIFF Rs 50 crore annually in exchange for broadcasting, managing, and commercialising Indian football, including the national team.This funding has been vital to AIFF’s operational and developmental efforts.FSDL had earlier informed ISL club owners verbally that the next season would not begin until the MRA situation was resolved.According to previous PTI reports, FSDL is also considering the formation of a new holding company to manage the ISL, with ownership divided among participating clubs (60 per cent), FSDL (26 per cent), and AIFF (14 per cent).","The Indian Super League (ISL) announced it was putting the 2025–26 season on hold due to uncertainty over the renewal of the Master Rights Agreement.

A recherché region in India — where cricket has failed to stamp its authority, where it’s commonplace to find a Barcelona or Arsenal motif than one endorsing one of our cricketing stars and where people disregard altitude hindrances to spend the increasingly climate change-affected summers to indulge in the game of football — has finally found its representation on the national stage.The 134th edition of Durand Cup will see participation from the first club from the Himalayan region of Ladakh in 1 Ladakh FC.""It’s a massive opportunity, not just for 1 Ladakh FC but also for the UT of Ladakh to be playing at Durand Cup for the first time ever. A huge thanks to the organisers,"" 1 Ladakh FC co-founder and general secretary of Ladakh Football Association (LFA), Tsering Angmo, told TOI.""We are the team from topmost part of India and Durand Cup is an opportunity for us to bring Ladakh on the Indian football map and use this opportunity to spread the message of awareness on climate change.""""And you will see we will be very unique in how we play football and carry our message to the people of the country,"" she added.Its uniqueness, in fact, is what has made this club – a brainchild of Tsering and former Real Kashmir co-owner Shamim Meraj — a pop-culture phenomenon abroad intertwining Ladakh’s culture, the black-necked crane on the crest, traditional motifs on the jerseys, and Buddhist principles of compassion, with bold social action.Their eco-friendly jerseys, unveiled by the Dalai Lama, have already sold in thousands outside India, especially in Europe.But the opportunity to bring their football from an altitude of 11,500ft-high to the mainland national stage is one that the two-year-old club has cherished since its inception.""Our expectations are very grounded. We like to dream, too, but for now we just want to compete well and give a good show at Durand Cup and then hope for some magic and miracles!"" was how Tsering explained their upcoming sojourn.However, 1 Ladakh FC are not leaving stones unturned in their endeavour to compete with some of the best clubs in the country. The dearth of professionals from the region has led them to recruit 10 footballers from around the country to guide their challenge, along with the Ladakhi players.Former Chennaiyin FC assistant coach, Rajan Mani, will be at the helm of the club with his experience in youth setup, having been a youth coach at Bengaluru FC as well as the ex-head of youth development with the U16 Indian team.""Playing on the mainland, with the huge difference in weather conditions from Ladakh, can be a deterrent to the players’ performance. So, we are taking steps to nullify those effects,"" Tsering explained.Hence, the team will be travelling to Delhi on Friday and undergo a 10-day conditioning camp at IMT Ghaziabad. They will then avoid unnecessary air travel emissions and travel by train to Jamshedpur, the destination of their Group C clashes, and hold a five-day camp in collaboration with Jamshedpur FC , ahead of their Durand Cup opener against Foreign Services Team at JRD Tata Sports Complex on Aug 2.But the very existence of the club, touted ""the greenest club in South Asia"" with its mission to hit net-zero carbon in four years, challenges the status quo. Apart from their goal of eventually playing in the I-League and becoming the first club from Ladakh in India’s top-tiers, it’s their environmental message that makes them the club to watch out for at Durand Cup.""It’s the perfect opportunity for us to amplify our message, and some plans are being worked out on that,"" Tsering agreed.""We will be the team using minimum plastic and have a carbon footprint calculator to measure our carbon footprint. Then we will offset that with measures both back home in Ladakh as well as through our fans all over the country contributing towards offsetting our emissions.""In a world where performance and profits dictate a football club’s trajectory, 1 Ladakh FC is a testimony that sports and sustainability can merge in hopes of a cleaner future.",1 Ladakh FC are the first club from the Himalayan region of Ladakh. The two- year-old club will take part in the 134th edition of Durand Cup.

Jordan Henderson will leave Dutch club Ajax a year before his contract ends, the club announced on Thursday. The 35-year-old joined Ajax in January 2024, just six months after his move from Liverpool to Saudi club Al-Ettifaq, which drew criticism over gay rights concerns.An outspoken advocate for the LGBTQ+ community, Henderson was accused of prioritising money over principles. However, he soon turned the page on the controversy as Ajax named him club captain. He went on to make 57 appearances for the Amsterdam-based side, whose shirt has been worn by legends like Johan Cruyff and Dennis Bergkamp.Henderson played a pivotal role in Ajax’s revival following one of their worst seasons. Under his leadership, the team mounted a serious Eredivisie title challenge. However, despite holding a nine-point lead with five games remaining, Ajax surrendered the advantage and lost the title to rivals PSV Eindhoven.Ajax Technical Director Alex Kroes praised the veteran midfielder, saying, “Jordan was a true captain for us, both on and off the pitch. Through his mentality and leadership qualities, he made a significant contribution to our qualification for the UEFA Champions League.”Henderson’s performances also earned him a surprise recall to Thomas Tuchel’s first England squad in March. Reflecting on his stint in Amsterdam, Henderson said, “To play for this club was an honour in itself. To have the privilege of captaining it was even more so.”He added that he would not be making further comments due to the “tragic events of last week, and the devastating loss of my former teammate Diogo Jota and his brother Andre Silva,” as quoted by AFP.","Jordan Henderson will leave Dutch club Ajax in January 2024.

Under Marquez’s brief tenure, the team managed just one win in eight matches , with a solitary victory over the Maldives in March.In 2024 so far, India have played four matches: winning one, drawing one, and losing two.

""We are not the first ones to lose to them but we have a lot of different things to improve.""Former PSG star Kylian Mbappe, now with Real Madrid, struggled to make an impact in his first match against his former club since his departure last year.PSG managed the impressive victory despite missing suspended center-back Willian Pacho, with Lucas Beraldo effectively filling the defensive role.Real Madrid faced their own challenges, playing without suspended defender Dean Huijsen and missing Trent Alexander-Arnold.The match began with PSG goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois making two impressive saves in the first five minutes, denying both Ruiz and Nuno Mendes.PSG's opening goal came in the sixth minute when Dembele capitalized on poor defending by Raul Asencio, with Ruiz converting after Courtois saved the initial attempt.The second goal followed quickly as Antonio Rudiger miscontrolled a pass from Jude Bellingham, allowing Dembele to score with a low finish.PSG's third goal demonstrated their dominance, with Achraf Hakimi setting up Ruiz following a sequence of possession that started with a saved Mbappe shot.Real Madrid's attack, featuring Mbappe, Vinicius Junior, and Gonzalo Garcia, failed to threaten PSG's defense throughout the match.The Spanish side's struggles led to Alonso substituting both Bellingham and Vinicius just after the hour mark.Ramos completed the scoring in the 87th minute, controlling a pass from substitute Bradley Barcola before finding the net.The victory continues PSG's impressive run in the tournament, following their 5-0 win against Inter Milan in the European Cup final and a four-goal victory over Atletico Madrid earlier in the Club World Cup.PSG will now face Chelsea in the final on Sunday, with the opportunity to add another trophy to their remarkable season.The French champions displayed their attacking prowess throughout the match, with Dembele particularly impressive, adding to his impressive tally of 35 goals since August.The result positions PSG one game away from completing an unprecedented season of success, having already secured domestic and European honors.","Paris Saint-Germain beat Real Madrid 4-0 in their Club World Cup semi-final.

New signing Joao Pedro scored twice on his first start as Chelsea eased to a 2-0 win over Fluminense on Tuesday to seal a spot in the final of the Club World Cup.The Brazilian striker opened the scoring in lethal fashion in the 18th minute of the last-four clash at the MetLife Stadium and struck again shortly before the hour mark as Chelsea set up a showdown with either Real Madrid or Paris Saint-Germain in Sunday's final.Signed from Brighton and Hove Albion last week for a reported £60 million ($79 million), the 23-year-old cut short a holiday and made his debut off the bench in the quarter-final win over Palmeiras.He was then given his first Chelsea start up front here in place of the suspended Liam Delap.Joao Pedro refused to celebrate after either goal against the club with whom he started his career and made 36 top-team appearances before moving to England with Watford in 2020.The result ends Fluminense's impressive run at the tournament after the 2023 Copa Libertadores winners held Borussia Dortmund in the group stage, beat Inter Milan in the last 16 and knocked out Manchester City's conquerors Al-Hilal in the quarter-finals.With their exit go the prospects of a South American winner of the first 32-team Club World Cup, with Chelsea claiming back-to-back victories against Brazilian opposition to reach the final.As always seemed most likely, the trophy will be claimed by one of Europe's superpowers, with the final now guaranteed to be between two of the last five winners of the UEFA Champions League.""It is a great achievement.

We are so, so happy,"" Chelsea coach Enzo Maresca told broadcaster DAZN.""Now finally it is the last game of the season, we can say that, and hopefully we can win the tournament.""Fluminense coach Renato Portaluppi had described his team as the ""ugly duckling"" of the tournament due to the enormous difference between their budget and those of the other three remaining sides.This game ultimately proved to be a step too far for their team, captained by 40-year-old former Chelsea centre-back Thiago Silva.""This was a wonderful Club World Cup,"" said Portaluppi.""There is no crying over spilled milk now. We wanted to get to the final for our fans but we leave with our heads held high, and go back to our reality stronger now than we were before.""Chelsea were without the suspended Levi Colwill and Delap but Moises Caicedo returned after a ban.The Premier League side were simply too strong for their opponents in a game watched by 70,556 fans on a hot afternoon just outside New York City.They went ahead thanks to a wonderful strike by their new forward, who controlled the ball on the edge of the box after Silva had cleared a Pedro Neto cross.Joao Pedro took a touch and curled a shot beyond veteran goalkeeper Fabio into the far corner, before holding up his hands apologetically towards the Fluminense fans behind the goal.The team from Rio de Janeiro were an intermittent threat, and Hercules -- match-winner against Al-Hilal in the last eight -- almost equalised in the 25th minute.He played a one-two with German Cano and lifted the ball over goalkeeper Robert Sanchez, but Marc Cucurella cleared off the line.Fluminense were then awarded a penalty 10 minutes before the interval when a set-piece delivery by Rene struck the arm of Trevoh Chalobah in the box.However, French referee Francois Letexier overturned the decision following a VAR check.""Had we been awarded the penalty we would have scored and it would have been a different story,"" said Portaluppi.Chelsea got their second on 56 minutes, just after Fluminense had sacrificed one of their three centre-backs to send on an extra attacker.Enzo Fernandez released Joao Pedro on the break, and the forward produced another clinical finish in off the bar.There were chances for Chelsea to score further goals after that, but the new boy's double strike sufficed with the only potential black mark on the day the knock which forced Caicedo to limp off before full-time.",Chelsea beat Fluminense 2-0 in the FIFA Club World Cup semi-final in New Jersey.

WATCH:

Real Madrid held off a late Borussia Dortmund surge to clinch a 3-2 win and book their place in the semi-finals of the FIFA Club World Cup, where they will face European champions Paris Saint-Germain. The match, played under sweltering heat at the MetLife Stadium near New York City, saw Gonzalo Garcia and Kylian Mbappe steal the show for the Spanish giants.Gonzalo Garcia, 21, opened the scoring in the 10th minute, slotting home his fourth goal of the tournament after an inch-perfect cross from Arda Guler. Ten minutes later, full-back Fran Garcia doubled the lead, finishing off a flowing move that included a cutback from Trent Alexander-Arnold. Real Madrid dominated the opening stages, stifling Dortmund’s rhythm and forcing them to chase shadows.Coach Xabi Alonso praised his team’s display but acknowledged the chaotic finish: “Everything was going under control… but the last 10 minutes were kind of crazy. Overall, a good 80 minutes and the last 10 minutes to improve.”Indeed, Dortmund mounted a dramatic late comeback.Maximilian Beier fired in from a loose clearance in the 93rd minute to make it 2-1. But Real’s response was emphatic — Mbappe, who came off the bench in the second half, produced a sensational overhead kick to restore the two-goal cushion.Mbappe, still yet to start in the tournament due to recent illness, now has his first goal of the Club World Cup and 44th of the season. ""It will be a great challenge for us to face PSG, but let's take positives from today and move on for the next one,"" said Alonso ahead of the semi-final showdown.There was still more drama to come, as Dean Huijsen was sent off for bringing down Serhou Guirassy, who converted the resulting penalty to bring Dortmund back within a goal.Despite the scare, Real held on, much to the delight of the 76,611 fans in attendance — a repeat of the 2024 Champions League final, but with far more twists.Dortmund coach Niko Kovac reflected, “It is a deserved win for Real Madrid. We showed our qualities and it is not a failure if you go home after a defeat against them.”","Real Madrid beat Borussia Dortmund 3-2 to reach the FIFA Club World Cup semi- finals.

Work and commitment

A late own-goal by goalkeeper Weverton took Chelsea through to the Club World Cup semi-finals on Friday as the Premier League side edged Palmeiras of Brazil 2-1 in a last-eight tie that had been lit up by a moment of magic from young star Estevao Willian.The teenage Brazil forward, who will join Chelsea after the tournament, was eager to impress his future employers and his brilliant 53rd-minute finish cancelled out Cole Palmer's opener in Philadelphia.But a deflected Malo Gusto cross went in off Palmeiras 'keeper Weverton in the 83rd minute to take Chelsea through to a semi-final showdown with another Brazilian side in Fluminense.""In the first half we were in control of the game and could have scored more than one goal,"" said Chelsea coach Enzo Maresca, dismissing suggestions his team had been fortunate.""They started the second half better than us and the dynamic of the game changed, but then in the last 25 minutes we were in control again and I think we deserved to win without being lucky.""The scoreline was a repeat of Chelsea's victory when the teams met in the final of the Club World Cup under the tournament's old guise in 2022.""Overall Chelsea was better. They have better players and a better coach,"" admitted Palmeiras coach Abel Ferreira.""They were lucky with the way they scored the second goal but it can happen in football and we need to accept it and move on.""Chelsea will now be fancied to go on and reach the final, with Fluminense standing in their way in the last four at the MetLife Stadium in New Jersey on Tuesday.If not everyone has yet been won over by the tournament, the intensity levels on the pitch are rising as it reaches the business end and there was a big-game atmosphere in Philadelphia.Lincoln Financial Field was almost sold out, with 65,782 fans in attendance despite much of the city having emptied out for the July 4 holiday and long weekend.This game played out to a backdrop of Independence Day fireworks lighting up the sky over the nearby Delaware River, but there were fireworks on the pitch too.Chelsea lit the spark first, going ahead in the 16th minute thanks to a moment of class from England international Palmer.After drifting into a pocket of space just outside the Palmeiras box, Palmer controlled a Trevoh Chalobah pass on the half-turn, carried on into the area and dispatched a low shot past Weverton.It was the ideal start for Chelsea, who lost to Flamengo when they last faced Brazilian opposition in the same stadium during the group stage.Maresca added extra Brazilian flavour to the occasion by handing a first start to young midfielder Andrey Santos.With Moises Caicedo suspended, Santos occupied the holding midfield role for Chelsea while Pedro Neto lined up on the right wing, choosing to play despite having to come to terms with the tragic death of his Portugal teammate Diogo Jota on Thursday.Playing on the right wing for Palmeiras was Estevao, the 18-year-old Brazil prodigy set to join Chelsea in a big-money transfer agreed over a year ago.He knew this could be his last game for the Sao Paulo side, and Chelsea probably should have been two ahead before the interval only for Christopher Nkunku to blaze over after being teed up by Palmer.Instead Palmeiras equalised eight minutes into the second half, with Estevao the inevitable scorer.Positioned inside the Chelsea box to the right, Estevao controlled a pass by Richard Rios and took a touch to get in front of Levi Colwill, another to steady himself, and then surprised goalkeeper Robert Sanchez with an early shot that went in off the bar.Chelsea responded by sending on new signing Joao Pedro for his debut, the Brazilian becoming the 27th player used by Maresca during the tournament.The Blues pushed in search of a second goal but extra time was looking likely when the Premier League side grabbed a scrappy winner with seven minutes of the 90 to play.Following a corner played short, Enzo Fernandez found Malo Gusto and his attempted low centre from the left side of the box deflected off the toe of Agustin Giay to surprise Weverton, with the ball striking him on its way in.Substitute Hercules struck a 70th-minute winner as Brazil's Fluminense defeated Saudi Arabia's Al Hilal 2-1 on Friday to reach the semi-finals of the Club World Cup.A fine left-foot finish from Matheus Martinelli had put the Rio club ahead in the 40th minute but Al Hilal's Brazilian forward Marcos Leonardo levelled six minutes into the second half before Hercules stole the show to the delight of the vast majority of the 43,091 crowd.Al Hilal had pulled off the biggest upset of the tournament, beating Manchester City 4-3, to reach the last eight and Simone Inzaghi's side fought hard until the end to keep their adventure alive.They bow out of the tournament having been unbeaten through the group stage, including holding Real Madrid to a draw, and having truly made their mark on the world stage.There was a moment's silence before the kick-off in memory of Liverpool and Portugal forward Diogo Jota and his younger brother Andre Silva, who died in the early hours of Thursday after their car veered off a motorway in Spain and burst into flames.Al Hilal's line-up featured two of Jota's Portugal team-mates in Ruben Neves and Joao Cancelo.The first half was a tight and tactical affair with few chances until Martinelli opened the scoring when he picked the ball up from Gabriel Fuentes inside the box and span out to give himself space for a left-foot shot that rocketed past Yassine Bounou.Al Hilal went close to a quick response when Kalidou Koulibaly's header forced Fluminense's 44-year-old goalkeeper Fabio into a fine save.The Saudi side were awarded a penalty when Samuel Xavier was ruled to have brought down Marcos Leonardo in the box but Dutch referee Danny Makkelie was eventually sent to the monitor where he overturned his own decision after seeing there had been no contact between the two players.After going in at the break trailing by a goal, Al Hilal came out strongly for the second half and drew level when Koulibaly headed a Neves corner down to Marcos Leonardo who poked home.Al Hilal's Brazilian full back Renan Lodi had a let off when his poor backpass fell straight at the feet of German Cano but the Fluminense striker's attempt to round Bounou was denied by the smart work of the Moroccan keeper.But the outcome was settled with 20 minutes remaining when half-time sub Hercules saw a shot from distance blocked but from the loose ball Samuel headed the ball back to the forward who raced into the box and fired past Bounou to make it 2-1.Al Hilal produced a flurry of corners and some intense pressure in the final minutes as they desperately sought a way to keep their dream alive but the Brazilians were good value for their victory.""We didn’t have many chances but we made the most of them, the entire group worked and were committed,"" said Fluminense coach Renato Gaucho.""Our fans here in the USA and those in Brazil, they can be proud and I ask them to wear a jersey, in the mall, street, beach, wherever, wear that shirt – they should all be proud to wear that jersey,"" he said.The Fluminense coach was full of praise for the performance of his 40-year-old central defender Thiago Silva who ensured the Brazilians were able to withstand the second half pressure from Al Hilal.""Thiago Silva is huge for us, I worked with him 15 years ago, he is a coach on the pitch, very helpful and conveys calm and experience to the others. He is our captain and a leader and in hard matches like these against big clubs, its important to have people like him. He is key and fundamental,"" he said.Al Hilal coach Inzaghi said his side had been unfortunate to end on the losing side.""It has been a good World Cup for us but clearly we leave with a little bit of a bitter taste in our mouth because after what happened in that second half, we deserved much more,"" he said.""It was a tight match, decided by episodes, as happens in football.

There were tricky conditions, and I was managing some issues with the brakes towards the end of the race, which wasn’t easy. I was quite happy with a bit of a gap, but nonetheless, the car was competitive throughout the race and there were some good strategy calls from the team. My guys did so well. There’s always some work to do, but this is a nice reward for everyone back at Jaguar TCS Racing.”Evans had secured pole position in the qualifying session. The Duels were cancelled due to rain, so the grid was determined based on the results of the group stage.Formula E later announced that Evans is now tied for the most wins in the championship’s history. He and Sebastien Buemi both have 14 career victories.Reacting to the post, a fan wrote, “14 and counting!

How the technology works

Can the visually impaired also enjoy the fun and thrill of a Formula E race? Yes, it’s now possible — thanks to a new initiative by Formula E and Google Cloud: an AI-powered audio race report. This initiative promotes inclusivity and makes motorsport more accessible for blind and visually impaired fans. Google Cloud will work with the Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB) to conduct focus groups and user testing during upcoming race weekends in Berlin and London, with a full rollout planned for Formula E season 12.The project was unveiled by Formula E CEO Jeff Dodds at the Google Cloud Summit in London. It uses Google Cloud’s generative AI technology to create rich, descriptive audio summaries of every E-Prix race. These reports will offer fans a dynamic recap that captures the excitement and key moments of each race, available on demand shortly after the chequered flag.The initiative originated from a Google Cloud Hackathon held during the 2024 London E-Prix. It is being developed in close partnership with RNIB to ensure the final product meets the needs of visually impaired users.Sharing his enthusiasm about the collaboration, Formula E CEO Jeff Dodds said, “At Formula E, we believe the thrill of electric racing should be accessible to everyone. This innovative collaboration with Google Cloud is a fantastic example of how technology can be used for good—creating a brand-new way for blind and visually impaired fans to experience the drama and emotion of our sport. By working closely with the RNIB, we are ensuring this innovation is truly inclusive and fit for purpose, so that no fan is left behind. ”John Abel, Managing Director of Specialised Software at Google Cloud, added, “For too long, the visual nature of racing has been a barrier for fans who are blind or visually impaired. Google Cloud's AI technology will act as a digital storyteller, creating a vivid audio narrative that brings the speed, strategy, and excitement of Formula E to life. We are proud to work alongside a partner like Formula E that shares our passion for using innovation to break down barriers and connect people through shared experiences. ”Sonali Rai, RNIB’s Media, Culture and Immersive Technology Lead, also said, “Audio description transforms how blind and partially sighted motorsport fans can fully engage in enjoying the full racing spectacle—taking in the visceral sounds of cars on the track while feeling the passion of the crowd.”She continued, “RNIB has been working with Formula E and Google Cloud on this AI-powered podcast, which promises to give a full picture of the race in an accessible and engaging way for blind and partially sighted fans. Formula E’s commitment to working directly with the community to develop this technology is exactly the right approach. It sets a fantastic standard in inclusivity for other sports to follow and stay on track with new advances in innovation. ”The audio report is generated through a multi-stage process powered by Google Cloud's AI platform, Vertex AI. Google’s Chirp model accurately transcribes live race commentary. Google’s Gemini models analyze the transcribed commentary along with live timing data and other official race information. The AI identifies key events such as overtakes, incidents, and strategic pit stops and generates an engaging, fact-based race summary.Also Read: Berlin E-Prix: From Oliver Rowland’s World Championship win to Felipe Drugovich’s debut, there’s a lot to look forward to The text is then converted into natural, expressive speech using advanced text-to-speech technology, resulting in a polished audio report ready for distribution.

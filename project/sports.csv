Does India's middle order wear an uncertain look heading into the Champions Trophy? The dominance against England at home in the lead up to the ICC tournament notwithstanding, there appears to be some confusion regarding key middle-order slots. At the core of the debate are the decisions to play KL Rahul ahead of Rishabh Pant as the lead wicketkeeper and sending Axar Patel out to bat ahead of KL Rahul at No. 5.Selection committee chief Ajit Agarkar, while announcing the Champions Trophy squad, had claimed Pant was the first-choice wicketkeeper. As it turned out, Pant is the only player in the squad who didn't get a game in the three ODIs in the England series. Sources indicated that there had been heated debate in the selection meeting around retaining Shreyas Iyer in the team and over the second wicketkeeper's slot.Former India coach Ravi Shastri sparked off the debate when the camera panned on Pant in the dugout in the second ODI. Shastri, on air at the moment, emphatically announced that he was bewildered by the fact that a player of Pant's calibre was being kept out of the playing XI.Shastri himself would know a few things about going into a marquee tournament with an unsettled batting lineup. Devang Gandhi, a national selector during Shastri's tenure as India head coach, said, ""Gambhir must be given due credit for working with a team in transition. He has got India dominating in the ODI format, much like India were doing from 2016-2019. What the selectors and Gambhir need to be careful about is consistency in the middle order,"" Gandhi told TOI.The reference here is to India's batting collapses in the 2017 Champions Trophy final against Pakistan and in the 2019 World Cup semifinal against New Zealand.""The batting then was largely driven by the top three - Rohit, Shikhar Dhawan and Virat Kohli . What happened then was nobody else got time to settle down from No. 4 onwards. The rest of the batting wasn't sure of the role they had to play.""When the top order collapsed in those big matches, the rest of the batting looked clueless. Hopefully, it isn't the case this time. If they have identified Axar as a No. 5 batter then they must look to give him a run at that number. Axar has done well but the management has to decide if he is going to be a long-term option who can rebuild and dominate an innings till the 2027 World Cup in South Africa,"" Gandhi said.The team management has backed Axar's promotion up the order and explained the need to have a right-left batting combination in the middle overs. Former India wicketkeeper Deep Dasgupta, who was on air with Shastri when the point was raised, highlighted that a left-handed Pant would always be a bigger threat in the middle order than Axar Patel. ""If the argument is to have a left-handed batter in the middle, then Pant fits the bill perfectly. Why wait for a left-hander to come out at No. 5? Pant could bat at No. 4 followed by Shreyas Iyer, Axar Patel, Hardik Pandya and Ravindra Jadeja ,"" Dasgupta said.Dasgupta argued that Rahul batting at No. 6 serves little purpose, since he is not a natural power-hitter who can hit from the word go. ""I understand the team wants to back Rahul since he has been consistent in the absence of Pant. But he did it at No. 5, where he could still build an innings. If that's the case, then let Rahul bat at No. 4 and get Iyer at No. 6, because he has the game to finish the death overs strongly.""Rahul batting at No. 6 is not likely to help his cause,"" Dasgupta said.Iyer himself set the cat amongst pigeons when he revealed that he wasn't supposed to start in the XI in the first ODI. It was only due to Kohli's knee niggle that a vacancy opened up in the middle order. Iyer cashed in on the opportunity, logging two emphatic half-centuries and an innings of 44 which was cut short by a run out.""The idea to bench Iyer at the start of the series didn't make any sense, since Iyer has been exceptional in the 2023 ODI World Cup and India have played very few ODIs after the World Cup,"" Gandhi said.However, at the end of the series, Gambhir insisted that Iyer was always a first-choice pick and that the team management just wanted to check out Yashasvi Jaiswal at the top of the order in the first ODI. Eventually, Jaiswal became the fall guy when the selectors decided to rope in an X-factor in Varun Chakravarthy in the bowling department, which seems overloaded with five spinners now.If India can come up with a more settled plan for the middle overs, they might just be runway favourites in the Champions Trophy.",India have been dominant in the few ODIs they've played heading into the Champions Trophy. But there appears to be some confusion regarding key middle- order slots. At the core of the debate are the decisions to play KL Rahul ahead of Rishabh Pant as the lead wicketkeeper and sending Axar Patel out to bat.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118292456,imgsize-92152,width-400,resizemode-4/118292456.jpg"

Australian cricket star Steve Smith has expressed confidence that spinner Matt Kuhnemann will pass all tests on his bowling action, stating he was ""surprised"" when told the left-armer had been reported.Kuhnemann is set to undergo biomechanical testing within the next 10 days after match officials raised concerns about his action during the second Test against Sri Lanka. Despite this, Smith remains optimistic about the outcome.""It's come as a bit of a surprise to me,"" Smith said. ""He has been playing for eight years in professional cricket and nothing has been said in that amount of time. I am thinking of him, at present, he has to go through the process. We're confident he will pass. He will go through that process back home, we wish him all the best.""Australian officials have been reserved about the specifics of Kuhnemann’s assessment, but it is expected to take place in Brisbane. The 28-year-old will undergo hours of testing, with markers attached to his arm and cameras monitoring whether his elbow extension stays within the ICC’s permitted 15-degree limit.Despite the report, Kuhnemann is still eligible to play domestic cricket and is set to feature for Tasmania in the Sheffield Shield. However, ICC rules prohibit him from participating in international matches until he is cleared.The decision to flag Kuhnemann’s action has left Australian players and officials puzzled, given that he has played 124 professional matches since 2017 without any prior concerns. The left-arm spinner has previously represented Australia in ODIs against Sri Lanka in 2022 and in Tests against India in 2023, before starring with 16 wickets at 17.18 in the recent Test series win in Galle.Smith revealed that he only learned of Kuhnemann being cited after Australia’s series-clinching win in Galle and did not notice anything unusual in the spinner’s action.Sri Lankan players had reportedly raised concerns about Kuhnemann’s action during the series, prompting umpires to refer him to the ICC. However, Sri Lanka's spin bowling coach, Piyal Wijetunge, defended Kuhnemann, suggesting that the doubts arose due to his distinctive wrist action rather than any illegal movement.If Kuhnemann's action is deemed illegal, he will face a tight deadline to rectify it before Australia's three-Test series against the West Indies in June and July. His availability will also be crucial for Australia's 2027 tour of India, where his left-arm spin could play a key role alongside Nathan Lyon","Matt Kuhnemann set to undergo biomechanical testing within the next 10 days.

Real Madrid maintained their top position in La Liga despite a 1-1 stalemate at Osasuna on Saturday, a match marked by Jude Bellingham's dismissal, whilst Atletico Madrid also drew 1-1 against Celta Vigo.The league leaders scored first through Kylian Mbappe , but proceedings took a turn when Bellingham received a red card for dissent near the conclusion of the first period.Osasuna equalised via Ante Budimir's penalty conversion at the 58-minute mark, as the defending champions extended their winless league run to three matches.Despite playing with reduced numbers after Pablo Barrios' early dismissal in the seventh minute, Atletico Madrid stayed within a point of Los Blancos, whilst Barcelona could potentially match Real Madrid's points tally should they triumph over Rayo Vallecano on Monday.Bellingham defended his actions, stating he was merely expressing personal frustration. ""I think you can see clearly in the video, I remember the incident very well, it was an expression to myself,"" he told reporters. ""I'm not even directing myself towards the referee, but obviously there was a misunderstanding. He's believed that I've said (something insulting) to him... There was no intent to insult him, there was no insult.""Carlo Ancelotti, Real Madrid's manager, expressed satisfaction with his team's performance despite the result. ""In a footballing sense we started very well, and we finished well despite having one less player,"" said Ancelotti.The Italian tactician adjusted his lineup considering the upcoming Champions League fixture against Manchester City, resting Rodrygo whilst giving Brahim Diaz a start.Los Blancos dominated early proceedings with swift ball movement, and Mbappe soon converted Fede Valverde's cross, marking his seventh goal in five La Liga appearances.The match shifted when Bellingham received his red card at 39 minutes after an exchange with referee Jose Munuera Montero.Ancelotti defended his player: ""I think with Bellingham's red card (the referee) didn't understand the English well... I don't think it's something offensive. I think the red card came out because the referee was nervous... Bellingham did nothing today to have been sent off, absolutely nothing.""After previous complaints about Spanish officiating, Madrid's frustrations grew in the second half. Osasuna equalised through Budimir's penalty after Camavinga fouled him, bringing the striker's season tally to 13 goals.Mbappe had a final opportunity in stoppage time, but goalkeeper Sergio Herrera made a crucial save.Regarding Atletico's match, Diego Simeone praised his team's resilience: ""The team had gladiators again, playing 90 minutes with one fewer player is very tough,"" whilst acknowledging Barrios' dismissal as correct.Koke reflected on the challenge: ""When we were left with 10 men it's very difficult... the team tried everything. We defended well, we suffered when we had to. Obviously we're still in the fight for the title.""In another fixture, Valencia secured a 1-1 draw at Villarreal in their relegation battle.","Real Madrid held to 1-1 draw by Osasuna in La Liga.

Responding to Brighton's impressive 3-0 victory at the Amex Stadium on Friday, Chelsea manager Enzo Maresca acknowledged it as the ""worst performance"" under his leadership, with Japanese talent Kaoru Mitoma delivering a spectacular Premier League goal.The lacklustre Chelsea side failed to register any shots on target, marking their second loss within a week at the venue.Fresh from scoring the decisive goal in Brighton's 2-1 FA Cup triumph over Chelsea the previous weekend, Mitoma continued to shine. His remarkable first-half display of skill preceded Gambian winger Yankuba Minteh's double strike.Having arrived from Leicester, Maresca's inaugural season included recent statements about Chelsea's rightful place in the Champions League , aligning with the club's two-year qualification objective.The recent defeat, their third in four matches across all competitions, has dampened their top-four aspirations.""I constantly feel pressure, but today's performance stands out as the poorest since my arrival,"" Maresca stated. ""This result brings complete frustration. We deeply regret disappointing our travelling supporters.""The manager faces the crucial task of addressing Chelsea's defensive vulnerabilities if the fourth-placed team, currently leading Manchester City and Newcastle by two points, aims to achieve their seasonal objectives.Maresca elaborated: ""In our current position, with an opportunity to extend our lead over pursuing teams, tonight's performance highlights numerous areas requiring improvement. However, we maintain fourth position and remain competitive for a strong finish.""Brighton, who suffered a 7-0 defeat at Nottingham Forest in their last league encounter and had secured only two victories in their previous twelve top-flight matches, have regained momentum with consecutive wins against Chelsea.Cole Palmer's early-season prowess, yielding six goals in seven initial league appearances followed by eight more (including two penalties) in seventeen subsequent matches, has notably diminished.Chelsea's trajectory has shifted from potential title challengers to top-four contenders as Palmer's form cooled. His struggles continued with wayward attempts before Noni Madueke's injury-enforced departure compounded Chelsea's fitness concerns.Brighton's opening goal showcased Mitoma's brilliance, expertly controlling Bart Verbruggen's goal-kick before outmanoeuvring Trevoh Chalobah and finishing precisely.Despite Enzo Fernandez's disallowed header due to a clear push, Brighton extended their lead through Minteh, capitalising on Chelsea's defensive errors. The third goal arrived from Minteh's skilled finish following Danny Welbeck's contribution, despite Chelsea's protests about a possible foul on Levi Colwill.","Brighton beat Chelsea 3-0 at the Amex Stadium on Friday night.

There is no doubt about the motivation that we have, you saw it last week (Chennaiyin notched up a 3-0 ISL victory over East Bengal FC in Kolkata).“We want to show that we have good players and a good team. We have to fight till our last breath. There is a Super Cup to be played, so you want to get yourself in the best condition (leading into it),” said Coyle ahead of the ISL clash against Punjab FC, scheduled on Saturday at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium here.Coyle stressed that the team is determined to make a “strong finish” to the season. “We have three home games (in the ISL), we want to take one at a time. We want to win the home games; to do that, we have to be at our best. That is what we need to focus on. We have to get the boys back fit and healthy.

We have to be more consistent,” added the Scotsman.Must-win game for Punjab: Punjab, sitting ninth on the ISL table with 24 points off 19 games, will need a win against CFC to improve their playoff chances.

The committee continues to function as elections remain pending.""It's not surprising anymore as there are power struggles in Pakistan football with people promoting themselves and not caring about the game,"" Pakistan player Navid Rahman told The Associated Press.

Already trailing 2-0 - not for the first time at the Mumbai Football Arena this season - any faint hopes of a comeback against an FC Goa side oozing confidence were killed after a terrible blunder by centre half Mehtab Singh in the 64th minute.Goa winger Udanta Singh, who had already tormented Mumbai's lacklustre backline a fair bit by then, picked up a clearance by Islanders goalkeeper Phurba Lachenpa and sent in a cross. Seemingly unsure what to do with it, Mehtab ended up heading the ball perfectly into the path of the lurking Borja Herrera Gonzalez who calmly slotted past Lachenpa at the near post. 3-0, game as good as over!In a fixture where pre-match story lines revolved around players facing their past, Spanish striker Iker Guarrotxena , who had an unfortunate short-lived stint at the Islanders last season, returned to haunt his former team, scoring twice for Goa in the first half. An injury-time penalty put away by captain Lallianzuala Chhangte was all Mumbai could console themselves with in the end.For the visitors, the 3-1 result was an emphatic way to end a horrendous 13-match winless streak against Mumbai in the Indian Super League . It also helped Manolo Marquez 's side consolidate second place (39 pts) in the standings, and perhaps, keep alive their faint hopes of catching runaway leaders Mohun Bagan SG (46 pts) in the race for the League Winners Shield.For the hosts, who remain fifth (31 pts), it was another evening to forget at the Arena. They did go into the game having beaten Mohammedan SC 3-0 before playing out a goalless draw with East Bengal in their last two outings here. But whenever they have taken on teams above them in the table, it's often been a struggle, and sure enough, Petr Kratky's side sank to their fourth home defeat of the season.The absence of the injured Greek striker Nikolaos Karelis does seem to be weighing on the reigning ISL Cup holders as Kratky decided to give Jan signing Jorge Ortiz his first start.Barring one effort on target late in the first half and a couple of moments in the second, the Spanish forward wasn't quite able to inspire Mumbai against his old team. For that matter, neither could Brandon Fernandes, who switched to Mumbai after seven seasons with his hometown side last summer, and was loudly jeered by his old fans in the away stand every time he touched the ball.Guarrotxena, though, had the most enjoyable evening of the three men on the pitch who were taking on their former teams. After picking up an Udanta pass across the edge of the box and placing a right-footed finish through a crowd of blue shirts into the bottom right corner for his first (24th), he then neatly turned in the winger's cross on the half volley to double Goa's lead in the 41st minute.",Goa end 13-match winless streak against Mumbai with 3-1 win. Iker Guarrotxena scores twice for Goa. Borja Herrera Gonzalez and Lallianzuala Chhangte also on target for visitors.

Overall, it's a really great result,"" said Bayern coach Vincent Kompany , according to the BBC.After suffering their first home loss since December 2023, Celtic will have a difficult time trying to win the match in Germany on Tuesday. The winner will advance to play either Bayer Leverkusen or Atletico Madrid in the round of 16.""It's only a one goal difference. It's a big challenge, we know that but it's still a possibility,"" insisted Rodgers.Benfica defeated Monaco 1-0 on the road, with Vangelis Pavlidis scoring the lone goal. The home team had to play a large portion of the second half with just ten men.Just after halftime, a goal by Pavlidis gave Benfica the victory at the Stade Louis II. In November, Benfica had triumphed 3-2 at Monaco during the league phase.In his team's last five Champions League games, including a hat-trick in the thrilling 5-4 loss to Barcelona last month, the Greek international scored his sixth goal.Moatasem Al-Musrati, a recent Besiktas transfer, was sent off for Monaco in the 52nd minute when he gestured to the referee to request for a yellow card after his teammate Breel Embolo had been fouled. However, he received a second caution himself.Benfica will try to complete the match when they return the following week. The victors will play either Liverpool or Barcelona in the round of 16.Feyenoord defeated seven-time European champions AC Milan 1-0 in Rotterdam on Monday, overcoming the dismissal of coach Brian Priske and gaining the advantage to travel to San Siro for the return.Milan goalie Mike Maignan gave the Dutch a hand with a clanger as Igor Paixao's speculative third-minute shot bounced off his body and into the net.In a game played at De Kuip in pouring rain, that was the lone goal scored.""These evenings are why we do this,"" said Feyenoord captain Quinten Timber.""De Kuip was on it again. We were on it. On to next week,"" he added, with Inter Milan or Arsenal awaiting the winner in the next round.Earlier, a contentious stoppage-time penalty helped Club Brugge defeat Atalanta, the Europa League winners from the previous season, 2-1 in Belgium.Atalanta was penalized for careless play at the back when Ferran Jutgla gave the Belgian team the lead in the fifteenth minute. However, Mario Pasalic headed in an equalizer for the visitors just before halftime.That appeared to be the case until the hosts were given a penalty at the end when Atalanta defender Isak Hien's outstretched arm caught replacement Gustaf Nilsson in the face, causing him to go down.After examining the footage, the referee upheld his assessment that the touch was unintentional and not significant, and Swedish forward Nilsson scored the penalty.""I've only just seen the footage and I reckon that if you ask 100 people if that was a penalty all 100 would say no. It's very strange,"" complained Atalanta's Charles De Ketelaere.The winner of that match will next play either Lille or Aston Villa.","Bayern Munich defeat Celtic 2-1 in Champions League playoff.

NEW DELHI: World No. 1 Jannik Sinner has accepted a three-month suspension in a settlement with the World Anti-Doping Agency ( WADA ) after testing positive for Clostebol, a banned anabolic steroid.The suspension, which runs from February 9 to May 4, means the 23-year-old Italian will miss several key tournaments, including Indian Wells , Miami, Monte Carlo, and the Madrid Open.However, he is expected to return in time for the Italian Open in Rome (May 7–18), just weeks before the French Open (May 25–June 8).The case stems from two positive doping tests last March. The International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA) initially cleared Sinner, accepting his explanation that the substance entered his system through accidental contamination -- trace amounts were transferred from a trainer who had applied the substance to a cut on his finger.WADA, however, appealed the ruling to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) in Lausanne, seeking at least a one-year ban. The two sides reached a settlement, reducing the suspension to three months.Sinner’s absence is a significant blow to the ATP Tour , given his dominance in recent months.After winning his Grand Slam title at the Australian Open in January, he had been in top form and was seen as a major contender for upcoming clay-court events. Thanks to his triumph in Melbourne, he is now eligible to compete in the next Grand Slam.His absence from Indian Wells and Miami -- two prestigious Masters 1000 tournaments -- will impact the battle for the ATP No. 1 ranking.The Italian will now focus on preparing for his comeback at home in Rome, where he will aim to regain momentum ahead of Roland Garros .","World No. 1 Jannik Sinner has accepted a three-month suspension.

World number one tennis player Jannik Sinner has reached an agreement with the World Anti-Doping Agency, accepting a three-month suspension.The case originated when WADA challenged the International Tennis Integrity Agency's previous ruling from last year. The ITIA had decided not to suspend Sinner for what they determined was an unintentional contamination.The tennis star's defence was accepted when he explained that traces of Clostebol , a banned anabolic steroid, appeared in his March doping test due to a massage from a trainer who had used the substance after cutting his finger.The 23-year-old Italian, who clinched the Australian Open title in January, will be eligible to compete in the upcoming Grand Slam, with the French Open set to begin on May 25.""This case had been hanging over me now for nearly a year and the process still had a long time to run with a decision maybe only at the end of the year,"" Sinner said in a statement.""I have always accepted that I am responsible for my team and realize WADA's strict rules are an important protection for the sport I love. On that basis I have accepted WADA's offer to resolve these proceedings on the basis of a 3-month sanction.""Initially, WADA had appealed the ITIA's ruling to the Court of Arbitration for Sport in Lausanne, Switzerland, seeking a minimum one-year ban for Sinner.His suspension is effective from February 9 to May 4, allowing him to make a potential return at his home tournament, the Italian Open in Rome, starting May 7.Sinner's lawyer, Jamie Singer of Onside Law, commented: ""I am delighted that Jannik can finally put this harrowing experience behind him. WADA has confirmed the facts determined by the Independent Tribunal. It is clear that Jannik had no intent, no knowledge, and gained no competitive advantage. Regrettably, errors made by members of his team led to this situation.""",World number one tennis player Jannik Sinner has reached an agreement with the World Anti-Doping Agency.

When does the mixed doubles tournament start?

What did the USTA say about the format?

US Open has revamped the mixed doubles format for the 2025 edition.

What was/is Mixed Madness?

What has been the criticism?

What has the USTA said about the criticism?

The US Open organisers have made a big change to their scheduling and format for the mixed doubles tournament, but not without criticism. Two weeks ago, the USTA (United States Tennis Association) moved the main draw start to a Sunday - following in line with the Australian Open and the French Open - which are 15-day tournaments. The new dates for the fourth and final Slam of the year were confirmed to be August 24 to September 7.The bigger change was announced on Tuesday (February 11) with the mixed doubles tournament set to get a massive change. Not without its share of criticism, though.In a bid to have more singles players enter the mixed doubles competition, the USTA have introduced a bumper $1 million prize money and a revolutionised scoring format.The event size will remain the same as last year - 16 teams or 32 players - but what will change will be the scoring structure and the timelines. The matches are destined to be shorter with the competition to be played over two days.The objective, the tournament organisers say, is to attract the sport's biggest stars, many of whom have long passed on doubles to keep themselves fresh for singles.The scoring is arguably the biggest change introduced. Early round matches will be best-of-three sets played to four games, with a deciding point at deuce. Tiebreakers would be at 4-all—rather than 6-6 — and a 10-point match tiebreaker would be played if the teams split sets, rather than a third set.The final, however, will resemble a Grand Slam match, a best-of-three sets played to six games with no-ad scoring, tiebreakers at 6-all and a 10-point match tiebreaker if there is no winner after two sets.Eight teams will earn direct entry by virtue of their combined singles rankings, with eight other teams given wildcards into the field.All matches will be played on the Arthur Ashe Stadium and Louis Armstrong Stadium courts.As per the plan announced on Tuesday, mixed doubles is set to be contested on August 19 and 20, during the week when the qualifying rounds for men's and women's singles are held at Flushing Meadows. Main draw in singles gets underway on August 24.""What I would say is the reason behind this is to appeal to more fans and grow the fan base around the world,"" said Lew Sherr , executive director and CEO of the USTA. ""But the way to do that is to have the biggest names in the sport participating in doubles, and to showcase them teaming up and playing in a different format, we think is exciting. In fact, we know it's exciting.""Sherr added that USTA had discussed a format change in the past but it never got going until they witnessed the thrill and excitement generated by the "" Mixed Madness .""""We've known and we've had conversations over the years, like, why don't they participate and we understand the scheduling challenges,"" Sherr said.""I think last year's task with that mixed madness event really informed our thinking, that if could unlock that week and free up the top singles players to participate, because it didn't compromise their fitness or their health going into the singles, there was a huge opportunity to attract them and that's what we saw.""The ""Mixed Madness"" was a one-night only, four team competition played last year during the Fan Week which precedes the singles main draw.With prize money of $500,000, the competition featured Naomi Osaka and Nick Kyrgios, Amanda Anisimova and Taylor Fritz, Coco Gauff and Ben Shelton, and Paula Badosa and Stefanos Tsitsipas.Team Badosa & Tsitsipas took the trophy with a final score of 6-4 against Team Anisimova & Fritz.Paul McNamee, the Australian former doubles World No. 1, was among critics of the shake-up, saying it would devalue the US Open mixed doubles title.""Sets to four games in a Grand Slam? 16 teams with eight based on singles rankings and eight wildcards. I'm sorry, but the US Open now will not produce a bona fide mixed doubles winner,"" McNamee wrote on X, formerly Twitter.""Devalued from a Grand Slam title to an exo (exhibition). Let's just say I'm in shock.""Poland's Jan Zielinski, a winner of the mixed doubles at the Australian Open and Wimbledon last year, described the revamp as ""sad.""""No communication with the players, no thought behind what it means to some people's careers, no respect to the history and traditions,"" Zielinski wrote on X. ""Sad to see.""Last year's US Open mixed doubles winners, Sara Errani and Andrea Vavassori, lambasted the decision in a statement on social media, labeling it a ""profound injustice.""""Making decisions just following the logic of profit is profoundly wrong in some situations,"" the duo wrote.""In the last few weeks we received the news that the US Open mixed doubles tournament will be completely turned upside down, cancelled and replaced with a pseudo-exhibition focused only on entertainment and show.""We see it as a profound injustice that disrespects an entire category of players... we don't know at the moment if we'll have the chance to defend our title but we hope this remains an isolated case.""With the doubles specialists all but out of reckoning for the mixed doubles event, it will reduce the option to earn points and money for them.""Yes, there's some that will be disappointed that they won't have the opportunity to compete in this event,"" Sherr said. ""On the other side, we know that there's a huge opportunity to create more interest globally in doubles and there may be a cascading effect here, that the mixed creates a bigger spotlight on the men's and women's doubles when we get into that portion of the tournament.""We'll have to see how that plays out, but we do know that our mixed competition historically has been competing with the men's and women's singles, and so the fields have suffered and the attention has suffered. This is a chance to give it a massive spotlight over two nights.""",US Open has revamped the mixed doubles format for the 2025 edition.

Indian tennis

looks to a 15-year-old now

PUNE: A little over two years ago, Maaya Rajeshwaran Revathi lost in straight sets in the quarterfinals of a Grade 3 ITF junior event in Pune. ""I don't lose often. Maybe I will win it next year,"" Maaya, then just 13, had declared. Twelve months later, she did exactly that.Any lingering apprehensions were swept away at last week's Mumbai Open, a WTA 125 event. Unranked a week earlier, the 15-year-old Coimbatore girl now appears on the WTA charts at No. 646, putting her in the top-20 of highest ranking achieved on debut. The list includes Jennifer Capriati, Gabriela Sabatini, Monica Seles and the Williams sisters, among others.The teenager's arrival already spells hope for a beleaguered Indian tennis scene - starved of success, battered by apathy of the officialdom, and a court case against the national body.Imran Mirza, who once famously nurtured a prodigy, is very impressed. ""Her temperament is the most impressive part,"" Mirza, father-coach to Sania, told TOI, ""She seemed very level-headed. That's something one needs to go to the highest level.""We put a lot of pressure in India. With Sania, that was one thing we had to always control, the kind of external pressure there was,"" explained Mirza. ""There's already so much excitement with that one performance. She has a long way to go. We have to make sure she's not pressured into thinking that she's the only (one).""According to Imran, Maaya's parents - father Rajeshwaran who deals in procurement of construction raw materials, and mother Revathi, who co-owns a small business - are best placed to nurture her temperament. ""A child is bothered about what the parents think, not what the whole world thinks. Once the fear of losing comes in, it's very difficult to remove that,"" he said.Maaya's mentality reflects in her aggressive game. Even at 13, she wouldn't hesitate to put away a moonball.Manoj Kumar, coach since she was 10, said, ""We impressed upon her that to compete with the world's best juniors, she needed to be aggressive and at the same time become a bit more consistent.""Kumar underlined that Maaya was yet to complete her junior career. ""She hasn't yet transitioned into the women's circuit. She has done well in one tournament, she needs to do it regularly,"" he said.Transition to the pros has always proved the biggest hurdle in Indian tennis. Maaya seems to come well prepared. A little over five-feet-seven in her shoes, she has a good couple of more years to grow, putting on four kgs of muscle mass over the past year. ""I eat like a beast,"" she said recently.With the Rafa Nadal Academy offering her a one-year scholarship, the Indian is in a group of four players who are monitored by two head coaches and assistants. Last month, Miguel Fragoso accompanied her for junior events in India, but she can also summon the familiarity of Kumar in her corner.While the teenager will continue with schooling in Spain, Imran cautioned against too much tinkering with technique. ""In Europe, most of the training is more suited to the clay-court game,"" he said, ""There can be exceptions, (but) we seem to be more suited to hard courts because we have more skill in our hands, and in our joints than in the feet.""","Maaya Rajeshwaran Revathi, 15, is ranked No. 646 in the WTA rankings.

Jannik Sinner’s success has a lot to do with coach Cahill: Amritraj,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/jannik-sinners-success-has-a-lot-to-do-with-coach-cahill-amritraj/articleshow/118122407.cms,"Vijay Amritraj

CHENNAI: Italy’s Jannik Sinner appears to be by far the most in-form men’s tennis player on the world circuit. Despite facing doping allegations, the world No. 1 did not let that affect him as he asserted his authority by winning the US Open and Australian Open.Indian legend Vijay Amritraj credited coach Darren Cahill for Sinner’s success. “The one major factor in Sinner’s game has been Cahill. I always knew that Darren had a very strong mental approach, and his ability to impart that to you and help you reach a point where you believe in yourself, where there is no second place for me – only first – has been crucial. And when I see Sinner play, I see a lot of that in him,” Vijay, who introduced Cahill to television, said on the sidelines of the Chennai Open Challenger. Novak Djokovic ’s decision to join forces with coach Andy Murray took Vijay by surprise. Djokovic and his former rival Murray began their partnership at the Australian Open, and the 37-year-old had a decent start to the season, reaching the semifinals.“I am surprised by Andy’s decision because he has just finished his tennis career, and to jump into something like this... you know, he has a family and would probably want to stay home. But he loves the game so much. I think they are a good match, and Andy can rejuvenate Djokovic to perform better.“Also, Djokovic’s match against (Carlos) Alcaraz was unbelievable – one of the best matches we have seen in a long time. Alcaraz is marginally more inconsistent mentally. He has more to offer in terms of his game,” Vijay added.The former Davis Cup finalist was vocal about the US Open’s move to add an extra day to the competition. He also stressed that the ATP reducing the number of 250-level Tour events is not a good sign. “By adding a day, they have killed the ATP 250 tournament the week before. The Slams are very important but let us not forget that you need tournaments in every part of the world. To become a Djokovic, (Roger) Federer, or (Rafael) Nadal, you still need other players to beat, right? These five or six guys alone cannot go and play the Grand Slams.

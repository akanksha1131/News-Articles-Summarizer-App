It was a three-and-a-half-hour party at the R Premadasa Stadium in Colombo on Thursday. The match between Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe was a dead rubber, but fans didn't disappoint, nor did the 2026 T20 World Cup ""underdogs"" — Zimbabwe.There were around 30,000 Sri Lankans with drum bands in each of the stands cheering for the co-hosts. But there were also a handful of Zimbabwean fans clapping, shouting, dancing and making their presence felt whenever a Sri Lankan wicket fell or when Sikandar Raza tonked long sixes into the stands.Zimbabwe’s 24-year-old wicketkeeper-batter Tadiwanashe Marumani says he has never played in front of such a big crowd. “It was really loud and that was my first experience actually. It was really exciting and a bit nerve-racking,” he told reporters in the ICC mixed zone after his team’s thumping six-wicket win over Sri Lanka.The atmosphere must have been intimidating for Zimbabwe cricketers, but they crossed the finish line. There was hardly any celebration after Brian Bennett hit the winning runs.“I don't think anybody gave us a chance to be where we are. To win people’s hearts and earn their respect, it’s a wonderful position to be in,” Zimbabwe captain Sikandar Raza said at the post-match presentation.At the post-match presentation, Sikandar Raza told former Zimbabwe cricketer and commentator Pommie Mbangwa how everybody loves an underdog story.Zimbabwe had already defeated two previous champions, Australia and Sri Lanka, in the group stage. In the Super Eight, they will lock horns against two-time champions West Indies and India, and South Africa, the runners-up of the previous edition.Zimbabwe captain Raza calls his team underdogs, but by no means are they pushovers. They are gaining momentum and have a skipper who knows a thing or two about chasing against the odds.After humbling Sri Lanka, Raza vowed his side is not done; reaching the Super Eight is simply part of a larger goal to bring lasting recognition to cricket in his country.“If we can win two out of three games, who knows what can happen. Everyone loves an underdog story,” said Raza, oozing confidence after conquering Colombo.In a professional career spanning close to two decades, the 39-year-old Raza has seen more dark days than shiny ones Raza’s journey from Sialkot in Pakistan to Zimbabwe was far from straightforward. It took him through unexpected detours that included dreams of becoming a pilot and earning a degree in computing from a university in Glasgow, before cricket finally took centre stage after his family moved to Africa.After some sombre years in international cricket, followed by a life-threatening bone marrow infection in 2021, the all-rounder, now in the twilight of his career, has reinvented himself as a bonafide globetrotter across T20 leagues worldwide.For Marumani, Raza is an inspirational figure whom everyone looks up to. “A person like Raz in our changing room, who’s played all around the world, who’s played more franchise leagues and who’s been in different changing rooms, I think that experience and that inspiration coming from him has played a really big role for everyone in our changing room,” he said.Meanwhile, Zimbabwe assistant coach Dion Ebrahim suggests the squad and coaching staff are in the presence of brilliance with Raza around.“He is a global superstar. He is up there with the greats and he will go down as one of the greats. I’m personally pleased to be in the presence of brilliance,” he said.When coaxed on what Raza brings to the dressing room, the former player added: “He brings all those superlatives. You could say the inspiration, the motivation, the passion. But what he does consistently is lead through his actions. He’s vocal in the dressing room, but people follow him because of the brilliance he performs with and his level of intensity. He is meticulous in how he prepares and consistently tries to improve, and I think that’s what keeps him going at the level he’s operating at. ”In a week’s time, Zimbabwe will be up against favourites India at the MA Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai.“I think rankings and every other measurement will state us as the underdogs, which is perfectly fine. When we came into the World Cup this year, we were definitely the underdogs in the group, and it’s a place we like to operate in,” said Ebrahim.“The advantage of being underdogs is that we go into these games with very little pressure, while most of it sits with India, playing at home, in familiar conditions, in a format they have grown stronger in over time.“Our biggest challenge will be ensuring we are not overwhelmed by the occasion, the crowd or the atmosphere, especially when India inevitably gain momentum. The confidence from today’s win, where we wrestled back momentum multiple times in front of a strong Sri Lankan crowd, helps.“In terms of preparation and planning, we are comfortable that we have ticked the right boxes. T20 is a fickle format, often decided by a moment or two. We just need to keep performing at the level we know we are capable of, as we have over the last three games,” said the batting coach.After missing out on the previous T20 World Cup in the USA and the Caribbean, Zimbabwe were forced into sub-regional qualifiers against teams such as Mozambique, Rwanda, Seychelles and Gambia. Defeats to Namibia and Uganda at the African finals in 2023 meant the world’s 11th-ranked side became the only Test nation to miss the 2024 event, pushing them to restart their next qualification cycle from the bottom in Kenya.Australia, as joint hosts with New Zealand, are assured of a place at the 2028 T20 World Cup despite an early exit this year, their first group-stage elimination since 2009. Zimbabwe, in contrast, have already sealed qualification for 2028 by knocking Australia out and reaching the Super Eight, completing a remarkable turnaround after years of navigating the hard way through qualifiers.Zimbabwe’s history at major ICC tournaments has been a rollercoaster. It dates back to their maiden 50-over World Cup appearance in 1983, when they announced themselves on the global stage by stunning Australia by 13 runs in the nation’s first-ever ODI.More recently, Zimbabwe’s struggles at major tournaments have been stark. They failed to qualify for the 10-team ODI World Cup in England in 2019 for the first time in 36 years after losing to the UAE at a global qualifier hosted at home. The setbacks continued as they missed the 2021 T20 World Cup following an ICC suspension over government interference, and then fell short again in the qualifiers for the 2023 World Cup in India after home defeats to Sri Lanka and Scotland.There were brief highs. Zimbabwe reached the Super Eight stage of the 2022 T20 World Cup for the first time and stunned Pakistan by one run in Perth. But a shock five-wicket loss to Uganda in 2023 marked a new low. Sikandar Raza later said that humiliation triggered a shift in mindset, setting Zimbabwe on a new path that has now delivered their best showing at a major tournament since 1999, when they beat India and South Africa.“I remember when we were told that we had to play the sub-regional Qualifier B in Kenya,” Raza said after his side secured their spot in the Super Eight with a washout against Ireland on Tuesday.“I remember sitting down with the squad and saying either we feel sorry for ourselves and be ashamed or understand the reality. The reality was that it was because of us that we were in this mess and only we could get ourselves out of it. We got together and worked towards a singular goal, which was to win the qualifiers, get to the World Cup and then write our own history and story.“We all sat down and laid out a plan. Along the way, we knew we would have bad games and that a lot of criticism would come our way. But if we stayed true to our plan, kept trusting each other and created a better culture and environment for the team to thrive in, we would be fine. To see the results after almost two years is certainly very pleasing.”","Zimbabwe stunned Pakistan by one run in the 2022 T20 World Cup.

Why Pakistan don't trust Babar Azam any more | T20 World Cup 2026

The Pakistan Cricket Board has reportedly expressed its unhappiness with Shadab Khan following his pointed remarks about former players during the ongoing World Cup. According to a report, the board has cautioned the all-rounder to be more measured in his language after he responded sharply to criticism surrounding his selection.Shadab had answered his detractors after playing a key role in Pakistan ’s 102-run win over Namibia in Colombo on Wednesday, contributing a brisk 22-ball 36 and returning figures of 3-13. Addressing the criticism from ex-cricketers appearing on television panels, he said, ""Former cricketers have their own opinions. They (former players) were legends, but even they could not achieve what we have. We have beaten India in a World Cup.""As per Telecom Asia Sport, team manager Naveed Cheema relayed the PCB’s concerns to Shadab, informing him that his comments had crossed a line during the post-match press conference. ""Naveed Cheema has called to convey to Shadab that he was out of his limits in the press conference on Wednesday night. Shadab should know that all former players - including his father-in-law, Saqlain Mushtaq - are respectable and are greats of Pakistan. Shadab should respect them and should not use such language,"" the report stated.It further claimed that Cheema has been directed to remind other players to keep their public remarks confined to match matters, warning that disciplinary action could follow if boundaries are breached.Shadab’s father-in-law, Saqlain Mushtaq, also voiced his disappointment. ""Those were unwanted comments, and most of the players had played with me. In fact, I am also one of those who have not won an ICC event, but we won several big matches for Pakistan - Tests and ODIs,"" Saqlain told Telecom Asia Sport.Pakistan are scheduled to face New Zealand in their first Super Eight fixture in Colombo on Saturday.

How Suryakumar Yadav and Tilak Varma are hurting India | T20 World Cup

India have completed their T20 World Cup group-stage assignments and now brace for a far sterner examination in the Super 8s. The defending champions will face tougher opposition in the next phase, including 2024 runners-up South Africa, the West Indies and Zimbabwe. So far, India have underlined their status as title holders by sweeping aside every challenge in the opening round.Speaking on Ash ki Baat, Ravichandran Ashwin lauded the team’s consistency but admitted that the performance against the Netherlands was not flawless. He pointed out that Suryakumar Yadav anchored the innings with care, while Shivam Dube, Hardik Pandya and Rinku Singh were positioned to lift the scoring rate at the right moment. Ashwin emphasised that even when India are not at their sharpest, their overall strength makes them difficult to beat.""Surya played a very diligent knock. For the acceleration point, Dube, Hardik, and Rinku were there. They knew they could catch up on the scoring rate. But India weren't extremely good today (vs Netherlands) with the bat, not extremely efficient. But it is such a solid team that even on their ordinary day, they can put you away. They were below par, not at their best. But still, with Varun Chakaravarthy bowling so well, the Netherlands could not pick him.Jasprit Bumrah got swing in the Powerplay and bowled yorkers too,"" he said on Ash ki Baat.Ashwin also discussed Tilak Varma’s approach in the shortest format, especially as he works his way back after injury. He underlined that T20 success does not always depend on brute force and highlighted the value of timing and placement.""Tilak Varma is coming back after an injury. We talk about power and strength, but sweet spot and timing are the basic essence of batting. Tilak is not a big power hitter. For him, timing and finding the sweet spot are most important. Please remember, you can play like Vaibhav (Sooryavanshi), but you can also play like Tilak, who relies on timing and picks the gaps,"" Ashwin said.Elsewhere, Pakistan confirmed their Super Eights qualification with a win over Namibia, joining India from Group A. Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe progressed from Group B, the West Indies and England advanced from Group C, while South Africa and New Zealand moved ahead from Group D in the 20-team tournament.With Australia and New Zealand already assured of entry into the 2028 edition as co-hosts, all teams that have reached the Super Eights, including New Zealand alongside Australia, have now secured qualification for that event.","India have completed their T20 World Cup group-stage assignments and now brace for a far sterner examination in the Super 8s.

Lately, it’s been a case of feast or famine for Dewald Brevis.Ever since an unbeaten 125 and 53 in back-to-back matches against Australia in August 2025, Brevis had struggled for runs. Across nine T20I innings going into the fourth edition of the SA20, the Pretoria Capitals batter had produced just 151 runs at an average of 16.77. The highest score during this stretch of matches against England, Pakistan and India was a 17-ball 31 in Ahmedabad.As the season began, things didn’t get any better. The most expensive buy in SA20 history at R16.5 million (Rs 9.33 crore) started with a six and 12 against Joburg Super Kings and Sunrisers Eastern Cape, respectively. In the next six matches, there were only two explosive knocks, an unbeaten 13-ball 36 against MI Cape Town and a 19-ball 34 against the same opposition.In the first eight matches, the 22-year-old had mustered a grand total of 141 runs from 96 balls at an average of 20.14.The tide turned in the last three games, including the final. ‘Baby AB’ saved the best for last with scores of 53, 75* and 101* and took his tally for the season to 370 runs, emerging as the second-highest run-scorer in the fourth season of the SA20, only behind Quinton de Kock.The unbeaten century was the first century in an SA20 final. The unbeaten 75 came off just 38 balls and took the Pretoria Capitals to the final. But the most impressive, one can argue, was the 53, where he recovered the franchise from 7 for 5 in a successful chase against Joburg Super Kings.His Pretoria Capitals skipper, Keshav Maharaj, lauded his maturity and class.“The maturity shown in these last couple of games, no one would have expected Brevis to do that. We know him to be a hard-hitting, six-hitting player, but he just showed his composure and his class. He’s someone that we know, if he bats 50 balls, he’ll get a hundred,” said Maharaj after the SA20 final.With a wide range of shots at his disposal in the middle order, Ryan Rickelton labelled Brevis as South Africa’s “trump card”.“Our trump card is always going to be Brevis, just with the way he plays the game. He does some stuff and some things that a lot of us can’t do,” said Rickelton.And here he was, South Africa’s trump card finding form at an opportune moment.Not that the Johannesburg-born had any reason to prove his credentials. In 52 T20Is since 2025, going into the T20 World Cup in India and Sri Lanka, he had produced 1,537 runs from 52 innings at an average of 35.7 and a strike rate of 173. He had struck eight fifties and two centuries in this period while hitting 130 sixes.Even Brevis’ bat seemed to rain sixes in someone else’s hands, as de Kock found out after borrowing the right-hander’s willow at Centurion, where he slammed six fours and 10 sixes for his second T20I century.“His batting is uncomplicated. The base is very strong, allows the front foot to move away so the bat is not restricted at all. He’s also got confidence in what he’s capable of doing and is willing to strike irrespective of what happened on the previous delivery,” said former India player Aakash Chopra of Brevis.At the T20 World Cup so far, Brevis has not set the stage alight, but he has chipped in with some valuable cameos. Against Afghanistan, he scored a 19-ball 23, followed by a 17-ball 21 against New Zealand, and most recently a 25-ball 36 against the UAE, which included a four and three sixes.“Not at all. Every ball I hit and every moment I’ve been out there, I feel like my confidence is at a great place and I enjoy being out there,” said Brevis on his form at the Arun Jaitley Stadium.One of Brevis’ sixes was recorded at 87 metres and went several rows into the stands. Interestingly, the right-hander used to be weak against that ploy. Now, he claims to have “loved it when it’s short”.That is at the forefront of “Dewald’s journey”, as he put it.“I’ve grown as a player, I like who I’ve become. It’s totally Dewald’s journey. I really enjoy it and it’s been an amazing one. I know how it feels to be having ups and downs as well. But that’s all part of it and that’s how you figure out who you are as a player and who you are as a person. So I’ve really enjoyed every moment,” he said.With India next at South Africa’s team base in Ahmedabad, it is a clash of the previous edition’s finalists and comes not long after they met in a bilateral series on these shores.“Funnily enough, my dad said during that series, ‘whatever you do, that’s actually just preparing you for the T20 World Cup, when you guys are going to play them (India)’,” said Brevis.“So I went into that mindset. But it’s still going to be a new game, new conditions. It’s going to be a fresh start for both teams. We can just be the best on the day, look after the small things and enjoy the moment,” he added.Come Sunday, South Africa will be playing the defending champions India in Ahmedabad, and Brevis knows the stakes rise sharply. Fresh conditions, familiar opponents and momentum finally on his side make it the ideal stage. After a season that swung wildly between struggle and dominance, South Africa’s trump card now walks in believing this is his moment to cash in.",South Africa's Dewald Brevis has scored 370 runs in the fourth season of the SA20.

How Suryakumar Yadav and Tilak Varma are hurting India | T20 World Cup

Former India opener Virender Sehwag has voiced reservations about India’s bowling strength as the team prepares for the Super 8 stage of the T20 World Cup. Led by Suryakumar Yadav , the defending champions cruised through the group phase, winning all four matches to advance comfortably.India dominated Group A, which featured rivals Pakistan national cricket team among others, but Sehwag believes sterner examinations lie ahead. With an unbeaten South Africa national cricket team awaiting them in their opening Super 8 clash on Sunday, he pointed out that India’s bowling attack has not yet been fully tested.""I don't think India have been challenged yet. In the first match, India struggled a bit, but since then they have been playing consistent cricket. The real test will begin in the Super 8s. Today, India scored 193, but they also conceded 176. So India will have to look at their bowling. When we come up against a better batting side, how will this bowling unit respond and be used?"" Sehwag said during a discussion on Cricbuzz.India’s most recent outing saw them overcome the Netherlands national cricket team by 17 runs in Ahmedabad, after posting 193/6 and allowing the Dutch to reach 176/7 in reply.In the same conversation, former India pacer Mohit Sharma also weighed in on the debate surrounding India’s bowling composition, especially in the death overs.""There is still doubt over which combination India will go with in the Super 8s. If you have an all-rounder like Axar Patel at No. 8, then who bowls at the death? If a team like the Netherlands can ask questions in the death overs, then bigger challenges are coming. If Arshdeep is there, you can be a little flexible since he can bowl alongside Bumrah at the death,"" Mohit noted.India’s Super 8 campaign begins against South Africa on February 22 in Ahmedabad. They will then travel to Chennai to face Zimbabwe before wrapping up the phase in Kolkata against the West Indies.","Former India opener Virender Sehwag has voiced reservations about India’s bowling strength as the team prepares for the Super 8 stage of the T20 World Cup.

A number of prominent figures from the cricketing world — including Indian icons Kapil Dev and Sunil Gavaskar — have extended support to former Pakistan all-rounder Imran Khan, who has been incarcerated for more than two years. Reports suggest that Khan, Pakistan’s Prime Minister from 2018 to 2022, has nearly lost vision in one eye, allegedly due to medical negligence during his imprisonment. He was ousted from office following multiple corruption charges.The push for better treatment of Khan gathered momentum earlier this week when former Australia captain Greg Chappell initiated a petition urging authorities to ensure proper medical care for the jailed leader. The appeal has been endorsed by several former international captains.In a conversation with Australian journalists Gideon Haigh and Peter Lalor, Chappell explained what prompted him to take action.“And so, you know, I've been following and keeping in contact with him as much as possible, but since he's been in jail, it's been impossible. I'm in touch with one of his very best friends on a regular basis, and not even his family have been able to see him while he's in jail.So, this has been sort of troubling me for a while, but I thought, well... What difference does one voice make? And it was in conversation with my friend [name not clear], and he said, Well, why don't you talk to other captains, and see if you can get a group of captains that make a statement that that might carry a bit more weight. ”Given the long-standing political tensions between India and Pakistan, and Khan’s firm stance toward India during his tenure as Prime Minister, public backing from Indian cricket greats was far from certain. Although Khan had visited India multiple times as both a cricketer and political leader and had forged personal bonds there, many of his Indian acquaintances had stayed silent following his imprisonment.Chappell admitted he was struck by how swiftly Gavaskar and Kapil agreed to support the initiative. “Sunil Gavaskar and Kapil Dev probably had more pressure than the rest of us, but they both reacted instantly. You've probably seen Sunny's comments… They've been friends for a long time,” he said.Earlier, Gavaskar had spoken about his long association with Khan in remarks that drew attention on both sides of the border. “I have known Imran since he was 17 years old, when India was playing at Worcester… after the Test series win at The Oval. He was trying to qualify as an overseas player for Worcestershire then. Whatever the political differences there, we believe that he should be looked after in a humane manner and given proper medical care,” he told The Indian Express.Others who have signed the petition include Ian Chappell, Clive Lloyd, Allan Border, Michael Atherton, Nasser Hussain, Michael Brearley, David Gower, Steve Waugh, John Wright, Kim Hughes and Belinda Clark.",Kapil Dev and Sunil Gavaskar have extended support to Imran Khan.

Jay Shah’s 2036 Olympic blueprint for India: '8 Medals won’t cut it'

Pakistan hockey captain Ammad Shakeel Butt criticised Pakistan Hockey Federation after troubled Australia tour during which his side didn't just have to roam the streets for lack of accommodation but also ""wash dishes before going to play a match"".Speaking to reporters at Lahore Airport, early this morning that the Pakistan Hockey Federation had been telling them lies and ""enough was enough"".""We can't work with this current management of the federation. When players have to clean the kitchen and wash dishes before going to play a match what result do you expect from us?"" a livid Butt asked angrily.Butt said the players faced serious problems during the trip. He claimed the federation did not properly arrange accommodation for the team. According to him, the players had to wait 13 to 14 hours at Sydney Airport before flying to Canberra.When the team arrived at their hotel, they were told that no advance payment had been made, so there were no confirmed bookings. The players had to wait for hours and even walk around the streets before a place to stay was arranged. Pakistan lost 2-3 to Australia in their first FIH Pro League match and went on to lose all their matches during the Australia leg, including games against Australia and Germany.Butt said the situation was embarrassing and affected the team’s performance.""What was pathetic was that even the Airbnb accommodation was arranged for 10 days when we had to stay for 13 days. We had to move into a cheaper residence after 10-days,"" Butt said.The Pakistan Sports Board said it had given more than 10 million rupees to the federation for hotel arrangements. Its Director-General, Noor us Sabah, said a detailed report is being prepared for Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, who has ordered an inquiry into the matter.The Sharif is the patron-in-chief of the PHF.Butt also revealed that players were warned not to speak to the media.""I am speaking up because of what we have been through in Australia,"" he said.""We need a foreign coach if we have to move forward.

India

Netherlands

A dominant India will be hoping that Abhishek Sharma rediscovers his destructive form and that the rest of the batting lineup steps up against spin when they take on the Netherlands in their final T20 World Cup league match on Wednesday. Despite being one of the most dangerous batters over the past 18 months, Abhishek has yet to make a big impact in the ICC event at home.After a duck in the opener, a stomach infection kept him out against Namibia. He returned for the high-stakes clash with Pakistan but again failed to score.Thankfully, Ishan Kishan’s imperious form at the other end has kept India’s campaign on track. To his credit, Abhishek’s high-risk approach has delivered multiple wins for India, and it may only be a matter of time before he dismantles top bowlers again. Yet, four ducks in his last six innings indicate he might need to rethink his powerplay strategy.With India already through to the Super 8s, the Netherlands game offers the perfect chance to get back among the runs. On the bowling front, India could rest a few players ahead of the next stage, including pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah. After opting for Kuldeep Yadav over Arshdeep Singh in Colombo, the team is expected to revert to two specialist pacers.If Bumrah is rested, Mohammed Siraj and Arshdeep Singh are likely to open the attack.The India vs Netherlands match will be played on Wednesday, February 18.The match will be played at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad.The match will start at 7:00 PM IST, with the toss scheduled for 6:30 PM IST.The match will be televised live in India on the Star Sports Network.Live streaming will be available on the Jio Hotstar app and website.The match can be followed live on TimesofIndia.com.- Probable XI: Abhishek Sharma, Ishan Kishan, Tilak Varma, Suryakumar Yadav, Rinku Singh, Hardik Pandya, Shivam Dube, Axar Patel, Arshdeep Singh, Jasprit Bumrah, Varun Chakarvarthy- Probable XI: Michael Levitt, Max O'Dowd, Bas de Leede, Colin Ackermann, Scott Edwards, Zach Lion-Cachet, Roelof van der Merwe, Logan van Beek, Aryan Dutt, Paul van Meekeren, Fred Klaasen: Suryakumar Yadav (c), Abhishek Sharma, Tilak Varma, Sanju Samson, Shivam Dube, Ishan Kishan, Hardik Pandya, Arshdeep Singh, Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammed Siraj, Varun Chakaravarthy, Kuldeep Yadav, Axar Patel, Washington Sundar, Rinku Singh.: Scott Edwards (c), Colin Ackermann, Noah Croes, Bas de Leede, Aryan Dutt, Fred Klaassen, Kyle Klein, Michael Levitt, Zach Lion-Cachet, Max O'Dowd, Logan van Beek, Timm van der Gugten, Roelof van der Merwe, Paul van Meekeren, Saqib Zulfiqar.","India take on the Netherlands in their final T20 World Cup league match on Wednesday.

T20 World Cup | Shivam Dube press conference after India beat Netherlands

KOLKATA: West Indies quite expectedly finished their Group C engagements with an all-win record following a 42run victory over Italy at the Eden Gardens here on Thursday, but they will surely have a close look at the way they went about it. On a wicket that did not allow you to go hammer-and-tongs from the very first ball, a few deliveries had to be played with caution.However, Shai Hope (75; 46b, 6x4, 4x6) apart, very few of the West Indies batters were judicious in their shot selection. Perhaps the complacency of playing a dead rubber had crept in as they managed a below-par 165/6. Their bowlers, however, did well to stop Italy at 123 in 18 overs, with pacer Matthew Forde’s 3 for 19 being best of the lot.One thing that strikes you about Italy is their never-say-die attitude. It doesn’t matter who their opponents are, they will come at them hard. The West Indies were perhaps caught off-guard by Italy’s stubbornness on the field.Whether it was diving full stretch to save a boundary or sprinting backwards to attempt an impossible catch, the Italians were throwing themselves at everything.The minnows from Europe were going all out to tick that final box in their dream run in this mega international event: a big team’s scalp.A bunch of expatriates who had made Italy their home, were out to make their countrymates sit up and take notice.Besides Hopes’ innings, the West Indies did not have much to show in batting with the Italians making their job difficult with some tight bowling and brilliant fielding.Despite it being a batting wicket, a few deliveries were stopping a little, forcing the batters into two minds. The lofted drives were not always from the middle of the bat and runs were not coming easily.Hope was opening up on occasions but might have been bogged down by the lack of support at the other end.SCORES: West Indies 165/6 (Hope 75; Kalugamage 2-25, B Manenti 2-37) bt Italy 123 in 18 overs (B Manenti 26, Smuts 24; Forde 3-19, Joseph 4-30) by 43 runs.","West Indies beat Italy by 42 runs to finish Group C with an all-win record.

CHENNAI: A Super-8 entry was the minimum that Afghanistan would have hoped for if they planned to give coach Jonathan Trott a fitting farewell. It didn’t turn out that way, though, with the Afghans exiting in the group stage.But on Thursday, they ensured that their long-time English coach finished his Afghan assignment with a win. Opener Ibrahim Zadran (95*, 56 balls; 7x4, 5x6) put his skillful hitting on full display as he smashed a stellar knock, his second successive half-century, to power his team to an 82-run win over Canada.Zadran’s innings — measured at the start and menacing at the finish — combined with his crucial 95-run stand for the third wicket with Sediqullah Atal (44, 32 balls; 2x4, 2x6) took Afghanistan to an imposing 200-4, after being put to bat.The score proved more than sufficient as Canada struggled against Afghanistan’s formidable spin attack. Veteran spinner Mohammad Nabi , who probably is playing his last World Cup, accentuated Canada’s fall with 4-7 on a surface that aided the tweakers.Rashid Khan (2-19) and Mujeeb Ur Rahman (1-23) applied the choke through the middle overs and sealed a comprehensive victory.Earlier, Afghanistan lost opening enforcer Rahmanullah Gurbaz (30) and Gulbadin Naib in quick succession in the final over of the Powerplay.

Why Pakistan don't trust Babar Azam any more | T20 World Cup 2026

Since coming into existence in 2018, Uttarakhand have reached the quarterfinals of the Ranji Trophy on two occasions. They went one better this time as they made it to the semifinals of India’s premier domestic competition. However, they failed to take the final step towards the title clash as Karnataka got the better of them by virtue of their sizeable first-innings lead in the last-four clash.Though the team is disappointed with the outcome of the semifinal, Uttarakhand coach Manish Jha felt proud of his side’s performance.“As a team, it was a big challenge for us to break the quarterfinal barrier and reach the semifinals. We tried our best but things didn’t go our way in the match against Karnataka. Our aim now would be to enter the final next year and clinch the trophy for the first time. But overall, it was a very good journey for us,” said Jha.Jha believes Uttarakhand’s journey to the semifinal has been a huge learning curve.He admits that the lack of big-match experience let them down in the last-four clash. “We have played the quarterfinals before and we have treated it as just another game. We wanted to have the same approach in the semis.But we were very emotional in the dressing room after we managed to enter the semifinal. I think we got carried away with that in the semis. We couldn’t capitalise on the small advantages we managed to create in the semis and that let us down,” the coach admitted.Despite the semifinal exit, Jha feels the future is bright for Uttarakhand cricket.“Our left-arm spinner Mayank Mishra (59 wkts) is the highest wicket-taker in the Ranji Trophy this season. Kunal Chandela is in the top ten run-getters club. We have teenagers like Lakshya Raichandani and Aditya Rawat who have huge potential. These are the players who aspire to play for India. Players from our state don’t get too much exposure. But they are showing their mettle by holding their nerve and delivering when it matters.”","Since coming into existence in 2018, Uttarakhand have reached the quarterfinals of the Ranji Trophy on two occasions.

Why Pakistan don't trust Babar Azam any more | T20 World Cup 2026

In sport, a healthy dose of self-belief can make athletes perform extraordinary feats. Zimbabwe, buoyed by their 23-run win over the mighty Australians six nights ago, followed it up on Thursday with a stunning six-wicket win over co-hosts Sri Lanka in Colombo.Chasing 179 on a sluggish Premadasa wicket looked daunting, but the Zimbabweans never lost belief. The chase started steadily with a 69-run opening stand between openers Brian Bennett and Tadiwanashe Marumani (34 off 26b, 5x4, 1x6).It was captain Sikandar Raza , however, who defined the chase. Walking in at No.4, Raza struggled initially to find timing and rhythm but Zimbabwe hung on. After 14 overs, 65 runs were needed, and then Raza unleashed himself. In two overs, he tore into Sri Lanka's premier spinners, Dushan Hemantha and Maheesh Theekshana, blasting 32 runs and turning the game on its head.At the other end, Bennett anchored the innings with calm authority. He notched up another unbeaten half-century, a 48-ball 63 that was punctuated with eight boundaries. The 21-year-old steered Zimbabwe through the tense middle overs. They stuttered a bit after losing Raza, for a whirlwind 26-ball 45, and Tashinga Musekiwa in rapid succession the manic final overs, but Bennett calmly hit the winning runs to settle the issue.Bennett remains undefeated in this T20 World Cup and Zimbabwe remain undefeated as they registered their second-highest successful run chase in T20Is. They finish the league stage as Group B toppers. They have been so impressive that it seems almost implausible that they failed to qualify for the 2024 edition.Earlier, batting first, Sri Lanka’s innings was galvanized by their in-form opener Pathum Nissanka , who hit a 41-ball 62 (8x4) to lay the foundation for the side’s total of 178/7.But tonight's story was about Zimbabwe. Player-of-the-Match Raza summed it up at the post-match presentation, when he said: ""Everyone loves an underdog story.""Brief scores: Zimbabwe: 182/4 (Bennett 63*, Raza 45, Hemantha 2/36) bt Sri Lanka 178/7 (Nissanka 62, Rathnayake 44, Cremer 2/27) by six wickets.",Zimbabwe beat co-hosts Sri Lanka by six wickets in T20 World Cup.

Veteran spinner Mohammad Nabi, who probably is playing his last WC, accentuated Canada’s fall with a four-wicket haul (4-7) on a surface that aided the tweakers.Rashid Khan (2-19) and Mujeeb Ur Rahman (1-23) applied the choke through the middle overs and sealed a comprehensive victory.Earlier, Afghanistan lost opening enforcer Rahmanullah Gurbaz (30) and Gulbadin Naib in quick succession in the final over of the powerplay. Pacer Jaskarandeep Singh (3-52) struck twice in four balls, first having Gurbaz caught at deep backward point after the batter smashed back-to-back boundaries, then trapping Naib LBW.Afghanistan reached 49-2 at the end of the powerplay.Threading it all together from the other end, Zadran eloquently anchored the innings with temperament and timing. He began brightly, striking Dillon Heyliger for back-to-back boundaries in the fourth over, but when wickets fell, he smartly shifted gears and prioritised timing over power. Using his wrists effectively, he found the gaps with ease, often hitting boundaries with an almost straight bat to anything that was full and on the stumps.The opener, who was handed a lifeline on 54, was the main character for the big finish too. Jaskarandeep, pick of the Canadian bowlers, was punished by him with consecutive eye-pleasing boundaries off the final two balls of the last over. Afghanistan plundered 69 runs in the last five overs for just two wickets.Having endured a lean start to the tournament — scores of 10 Vs New Zealand and 12 Vs South Africa — Afghanistan would have hoped for this knock to arrive sooner. It however, helped the last edition’s semifinalist sign off on a high.",Afghanistan beat Canada by 82 runs to reach the Super-8 stage. Ibrahim Zadran hit 95 not out as Afghanistan reached 200-4 in their 50 overs. Afghanistan reached 49-2 at the end of the powerplay before losing two wickets.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128574669,imgsize-2047768,width-400,resizemode-4/afghan.jpg"

On the eve of NorthEast United FC ’s Indian Super League (ISL) opener against East Bengal FC, head coach Juan Pedro Benali struck a deeply emotional yet clear-headed note, calling on fans to rally behind their teams while keeping the bigger picture of Indian football in mind.“It’s easy to criticise on social media. Buy the tickets to watch your team, be it NorthEast United FC, East Bengal FC or Kerala Blasters FC, make people feel that football is important,” he said, before adding, “Rather than sitting at home and criticising, not watching the games, come to the stadiums.”The 56-year-old Spaniard emphasised that even small acts of support can make a meaningful difference, urging fans to go the extra mile for their clubs and the sport.“We know it is a difficult moment, but support your team. Just for that Rs 100, Rs 200 or Rs 50 (match ticket price), it’s money. The sacrifice that you make by travelling to watch the game, be it 10, 20, 50, or 80 km, is a sacrifice. But when you make that sacrifice, you earn the right to criticise, and you can say, I helped my club,” Benali added.While acknowledging the frustrations surrounding Indian football, Benali made it clear that fans are fully entitled to express their views — but insisted that criticism should be matched with action.“The national team is not doing well, because of this, that… I understand. It’s your right (to voice your opinion). Do it, but also help. Rs 200 for each game. Go to the FanCode, pay Rs 299 for the season pass. Buy the subscription to watch NorthEast United FC (Team Pass). That’s what we’re asking from the fans. That’s the support. That’s the help. This is where the clubs can feel that they have (supporting) hands, and not the fans who only talk,” he said.In a call for unity during what he described as a challenging phase, Benali urged supporters to stand by their teams regardless of results or circumstances.“It is not a moment to say NorthEast will not do well or go to the second division. No, it is a moment to be with everyone, regardless of the results. Be with your team, your players,” he added.He signed off with a broader appeal, urging the entire Indian football ecosystem to come together as one.“This is the real moment to be a family. This is the real moment to be an Indian football family, all together. The clubs, the players, the fans. This is the moment to show the world that even if 10 per cent of the Indian population loves football, that’s 150 million people. But let’s be together,” Benali said.Dream Sports-owned FanCode is the official broadcaster of the ISL , having come onboard after a bid of Rs 8.62 crore.

The military will use two types of equipment:

A semi-mobile system that creates a protected zone where no unauthorized drone can fly.

A portable system that a soldier can carry and point at a suspicious drone.

The Mexican military is getting ready to deal with unauthorized drones during this summer’s football World Cup.Mexico is hosting the tournament together with the United States and Canada from June 11 to July 19. On Tuesday, soldiers at a military base in Mexico City showed the anti-drone equipment they plan to use to protect stadiums.The move comes because drug cartels in Mexico have increasingly used drones bought online to attack rivals and sometimes civilians. This has become more common over the past five years.However, most of the cartel violence happens far from the three World Cup host cities: Mexico City, Guadalajara, and Monterrey. These cities will host 13 matches during the tournament.""(Drone prevention) is going to be focused in the stadiums and where there are crowds, which could be the 'Fan Fest' events, or any point where there are meetings of people,"" army Captain Jose Alfredo Lara, a communications and electronics engineer, told AFP.Once the military team locates a drone, it cuts off the pilot's communication with the apparatus. ""The device loses control and won't be able to come close,"" Lara explained.This causes the drone to lose control and prevents it from getting close. Depending on how it is set up, the drone may return to its operator, try to leave the blocked area, or crash.Several major criminal groups in Mexico, including the Sinaloa Cartel, Cartel Jalisco Nueva Generacion, and La Familia Michoacana, are known to use drones. Their activity is mostly reported in states like Michoacan, Chihuahua, and Guanajuato.Last October, drones carrying homemade explosives attacked state prosecutor offices in Tijuana, a city near the US border.The Mexican military says these new security measures are meant to reduce the risk of drone attacks during the World Cup and keep fans safe.",Mexico is hosting the tournament together with the United States and Canada from June 11 to July 19.

Kolkata: Some wobbles, some worries and in the end Mohun Bagan Super Giant got just what the doctor ordered — a 2-0 win over Kerala Blasters to start their defence of the ISL title here on Saturday.Jamie Maclaren put Sergio Lobera’s side in front in the 36th minute and Tom Aldred came off the bench to head home the second goal to polish the victory up deep into injury time.However, it was not the kind of rise-and-shine moment the 30,000-odd fans present at the stands would love to be thrilled with.The defending champions’ path to victory was strewn with some avoidable potholes here and there, something which one might be tempted to attribute to their opening match rustiness and ineptitude.It was Petratos who had a direct role in breaking the deadlock. The Bagan No. 9, receiving the ball inside the box from Apuia, laid it off quickly for fellow Australian Maclaren, who steered clear of Aiban Dohling’s challenge with a sharp turn to beat the goalkeeper Sachin Suresh with a left-footed low volley. Bagan thereafter had more possession and more territory, but they couldn’t control the opponents, who looked more ambitious in the second half, especially with the arrival of Kevin Yoke.Sensing the problem, Lobera introduced Aldred in the 81st minute, taking off Petratos. Defender Aldred calmed the nerves for his team, rising to the occasion to meet Anirush Thapa’s free-kick and beating the Blasters goalkeeper for the second time.

New signings Mehtab Singh, Robson Da Silva, and Amey Ranawade were the fresh faces in the whole match day squad. On the other hand, David Catala named a young lineup in his first ISL match, with foreign signings Oumar Ba and Victor Bertomeu making their debuts alongside midfielders Y Ebindas and Rowllin Borges, as per an ISL press release.The defending champions had the better possession in the first half, with Anirudh Thapa and Lalengmawia Ralte (Apuia) controlling the midfield, allowing Robson and Liston Colaco to find space to attack through the wings.Dimi Petratos returned to his preferred No. 10 role behind Jamie Maclaren, and the Australian almost gave his side an early lead. Liston Colaco found Petratos inside the box, but the forward snatched his shot, which went wide of the goal.The Mariners were dominating possession, but were finding it difficult to break down the stubborn defence of Kerala Blasters. They did manage to take the lead after the water break through Jamie Maclaren. He was found inside the box by Petratos, and the Aussie striker turned Aiban Dohling and found the net through a composed left-footed finish for the first goal of the ISL season. Mohun Bagan ended the first half with the one goal lead registering ten shots on goal with six on target at the end of the half.Catala made two changes in the start of the second half, bringing in Naocha Singh and Marlon Trujillo while Subhasish Bose was replaced by Amey Ranawade for Mohun Bagan. The second half also saw the Mariners being comfortable with the ball, maintaining possession for long periods to force the Blasters to defend deep in their own half.Kerala Blasters became stronger in the final quarter of the game, especially with the introduction of Kevin Yoke, who showed his pace and dribbling abilities down the wings, but could not muster any clear-cut chances to trouble Vishal Kaith in goal.

Myles Garrett shows rare vulnerability as touching poem for Chloe Kim leaves Olympic champion crying



Myles Garrett, Chloe Kim. (Getty Images)

Myles Garrett rarely lets the public see this side of him. Known for power and disruption on Sundays with the Cleveland Browns, he revealed something far quieter and far more personal. In a recent conversation, the NFL ’s reigning defensive player of the year shared words he once wrote for his girlfriend, Olympic snowboarder Chloe Kim. The moment felt intimate, almost private, yet honest enough to show how much she means to him.Their lives often unfold in stadiums and on mountains, under lights and pressure. Yet in between those high stakes moments, they have built something steady. It shows in small gestures. It shows in how they speak about each other. And sometimes, it shows in poetry.During an interview with Sports Illustrated, Garrett was asked to share fun facts about himself. One answer surprised many. He had written a poem for Kim and even read part of it aloud from her phone. ""You enrapture fools to kings, and exist without a peer,"" Garrett, 30, said. ""Put on this Earth for many things, but our love is why you're here.""Kim, standing nearby, could not hide her reaction. “It's sweet; it's so sweet, I cried,"" Kim, 25, said.Garrett’s response came with a grin. ""You cry easily,"" Garrett responded with a smile.Their affection has been easy to spot lately. After Kim claimed silver in the halfpipe at the Winter Olympics 2026 on Feb. 12, she posted a playful Valentine’s tribute on Instagram. One photo showed Garrett wearing a T shirt she had given him. ""I ❤︎⁠ my super hot beautiful girlfriend. So please stay away from me,"" the shirt read.Garrett had already made it clear he would be there for her. Speaking earlier to PEOPLE, he explained how they stay close despite demanding schedules. ""We're both just so supportive of one another,"" Garrett told PEOPLE. ""She's always texting, she's always calling to see how I'm doing during the year and I'm doing the same right now, checking on her, seeing how she's feeling, emotionally and physically.""He later traveled to Italy and was seen behind a camera, capturing her Olympic run with pride.Garrett dominates quarterbacks for a living. But with Kim, he chooses softer words. And somehow, those may carry even more weight.","Cleveland Browns star Myles Garrett shared a poem he wrote for his girlfriend, Chloe Kim.

Livvy Dunne turns heads in debut campaign as Tom Brady hails partnership as massive moment



Livvy Dunne NoBull partnership became official when Livvy Dunne shared a confident Instagram post that instantly drew attention across sports and business circles. The former LSU gymnast wrote, “sooo excited to join the nobull team alongside @tombrady as an athlete, investor, and partner. .. LFG!” It was more than a routine endorsement reveal. It was a signal that her influence now stretches deep into ownership and long term brand building.The response from Tom Brady came quickly and carried his familiar competitive energy. The seven time champion, now part owner of the Las Vegas Raiders and a broadcaster with Fox Sports, replied simply, “LFG,” followed by three raised hand emojis. Brady has been steadily expanding his presence with NoBull, and Dunne’s arrival shows how seriously the company is investing in modern athlete entrepreneurs.The Livvy Dunne NoBull partnership did not happen by accident. Tom Brady became one of the company’s biggest stakeholders after folding his TB12 and Brady Brand ventures into NoBull. Adding Dunne brings one of the most visible athlete influencers in the world into that circle, not just as a promoter but as an investor and partner.Her announcement photos reflected that confidence. Wearing NoBull’s athletic gear and trainers, she presented herself as both competitor and businesswoman.The company reinforced that message, stating she “built her brand on discipline and authenticity, the same principles that define the NoBull mentality.”For Dunne, this is another step in a carefully growing portfolio. Since stepping away from gymnastics competition, she has focused on sponsorships, investments, and real estate. She has shown a clear interest in equity opportunities that offer more than short term visibility.Away from business, she continues to support her boyfriend, Paul Skenes, one of baseball’s brightest pitching stars. Speaking earlier this year, she said, “I'll try to make all of his starts, that's my goal this year,” before adding, “I think really being present every time we're together. We both travel so much, it's so important to put your phone down and just be with one another and be there for each other.”That balance between personal life and expanding business ambitions defines where Dunne stands now. Brady built his career on preparation and timing. In Dunne, he may see a familiar mindset, just at a different stage and in a different arena.",Livvy Dunne and Tom Brady announce partnership with NoBull.

Brittany Mahomes Champion for Change Award recognizes her leadership and impact



Brittany Mahomes keeps finding new ways to leave her imprint on the game, and this time it reaches beyond the touchline. Brittany Mahomes will be honored this spring as the first recipient of the Champion for Change Award, a recognition that speaks as much to influence as it does to intent. The honor comes from United WE, a Kansas City nonprofit marking its 35th year of advocating for women’s economic leadership.The award will be presented on May 6 at CPKC Stadium, a venue that reflects Mahomes’ vision as co owner of the Kansas City Current. The stadium itself stands as proof of her investment in the women’s game. Built specifically for a professional women’s team, it represents a shift in how the sport is valued and experienced. That effort helped position her as a natural choice for an honor centered on meaningful change.The Brittany Mahomes Champion for Change Award arrives at a time when her reach continues to expand across sports, business, and culture. United WE President and CEO Wendy Doyle explained why Mahomes stood out, saying, “The spaces and systems we build determine not just who participates in our economy — but how strong it becomes.”Doyle added, “For 35 years, United WE has worked to advance women’s economic leadership, and Brittany Mahomes exemplifies that leadership in action.” Mahomes, who also is on the NWSL Advisory Board, is being honored for making an “economic and cultural impact” in Kansas City.Mahomes’ influence stretches far beyond ownership. She serves on the National Women’s Soccer League Advisory Board, helping shape decisions that affect the league’s future. Her roots as an athlete remain close as well. Earlier this year, she was inducted into the University of Texas at Tyler Athletics Hall of Fame, a reminder of where her journey began.Her work alongside her husband, Patrick Mahomes , has also made a difference off the field. Through their foundation, they have directed millions toward improving children’s health and creating opportunity in underserved communities. Those efforts often unfold quietly, away from cameras.Still, her public platform continues to grow. A recent appearance in Sports Illustrated Swimsuit brought a different kind of attention. Mahomes used that moment to speak to mothers, hoping to encourage confidence and ambition at a stage of life often overlooked.United WE leaders believe that kind of visibility matters. It challenges old assumptions and opens doors for others. The Champions for Change event itself will celebrate more than three decades of work, but this year carries added meaning. In honoring Mahomes, the organization is recognizing a figure who has helped redefine what leadership in sports can look like, and who gets to hold it.At the same time, Patrick’s contract adjustment quietly reshaped the Chiefs’ financial outlook. The team converted over $54 million of his future salary into a bonus, creating roughly $43.56 million in cap space. His 2026 cap number dropped significantly, giving the Chiefs flexibility to strengthen the roster while pushing larger cap hits into later years. The move reflected a structure designed from the beginning to keep the championship window open.","Brittany Mahomes will be honored this spring as the first recipient of the Champion for Change Award.

Fact check: Did Jay-Z shut out Travis Kelce’s fiancée Taylor Swift from the Super Bowl halftime show?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/fact-check-did-jay-z-shut-out-travis-kelces-fiance-taylor-swift-from-the-super-bowl-halftime-show/articleshow/128556877.cms,"A new report suggests Taylor Swift may not headline the Super Bowl halftime show despite strong fan demand and proven ratings power. Roc Nation, led by Jay-Z, is reportedly prioritizing bold, culture-shaping performances over guaranteed popularity. Swift’s scheduling concerns tied to Travis Kelce’s NFL future could also play a role, leaving her Super Bowl debut uncertain for now.

Jay-Z’s halftime vision could keep Taylor Swift off the Super Bowl stage

People have been talking about Taylor Swift being the main act at a future Super Bowl halftime show for years. This is because she is so popular and because her relationship with Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce has gotten so much attention from the NFL . Despite huge fan demand and record-breaking viewership for her appearances and projects, a new report says that the global pop star may not be stepping onto the sport's biggest stage anytime soon.The choice seems to be more about the artistic direction than the ratings. Roc Nation, the entertainment company run by Jay-Z that has been in charge of halftime shows since 2019, is said to be pushing the show toward bold cultural statements instead of sure crowd-pleasers. The change shows that the halftime stage has a bigger goal: to have an impact and start conversations instead of just making money.According to entertainment insider Rob Shuter, the philosophy guiding halftime selections has evolved. “Insiders say Jay-Z is thinking bigger, louder, and riskier,” he wrote, adding that the music mogul feels validated after backing a performance that initially drew skepticism. The strong reception to Bad Bunny’s recent halftime show, which attracted nearly 125 million viewers, reinforced that strategy.One executive source explained the distinction clearly: “Taylor equals ratings,” but “Jay isn’t chasing guaranteed anymore.He’s chasing impact.” The report suggests the halftime show is being treated as a cultural platform meant to spark conversation and define moments rather than simply deliver mass appeal.Swift’s global appeal is undeniable. Her worldwide tour drew millions of ticket buyers at premium prices, her concert film ranked among the most-streamed releases on Disney+, and television appearances have produced major audience spikes. Even so, the halftime selection process now appears to prioritize artistic risk and cultural influence over proven commercial dominance.Another practical factor may also be in play. If Travis Kelce continues his NFL career, sources close to Swift indicate she may avoid committing to a halftime performance in a year when he could be competing on the field. The possible conflict shows how personal and professional schedules can overlap at the highest levels of sports and entertainment.Swift is still one of the most popular halftime performers among fans right now. It may be less about her popularity and more about timing, cultural direction, and the changing vision behind one of the most watched live performances in the world that will determine if she ever takes the stage.","A new report suggests Taylor Swift may not headline the Super Bowl halftime show despite strong fan demand and proven ratings power.

Rashee Rice hit with massive $1 million lawsuit as ex girlfriend Dacoda Jones 's dispute turns serious

Rashee Rice is facing a lawsuit that brings serious personal allegations into public view, at a time when his football career still feels on the rise. The Rashee Rice, who helped power the Kansas City Chiefs to a Super Bowl title as a rookie, is now being sued by his ex partner, Dacoda Nichole Jones, for $1 million. The case, filed in district court, outlines accusations that stretch across nearly two years.Jones, the mother of his two children, claims the abuse was not isolated but repeated. Her lawsuit, first detailed in court records obtained by TMZ, describes a relationship marked by violence, fear, and lasting injury. The claims add to earlier public accusations she shared months ago, shifting the matter from social media to a legal fight with far greater consequences.The lawsuit paints a troubling timeline. Dacoda Jones alleges the abuse took place between December 2023 and July 2025, during a period when Rice’s professional life was accelerating. According to the report, “Rashee Rice’s longtime partner and mother of his children has filed an explosive lawsuit against the NFL star, accusing him of choking, strangling, scratching, hitting, and headbutting her over a nightmare 19 month period.Her filing goes further. It claims she endured “other violent and abusive behaviors,” including having objects thrown at her, witnessing walls punched, and furniture broken in anger. She also states the physical toll was severe, citing “bleeding, swelling, bruising, and other pain and physical injury to her neck, face, mouth, arms, legs, chest, and shoulder.” Some of these alleged incidents, she says, happened while she was pregnant.This is not the first time Jones has spoken publicly. In January 2026, she posted on Instagram about abuse throughout their eight year relationship, including claims she was locked outside in freezing temperatures. That post sparked widespread attention, and soon after, the Chiefs acknowledged the situation.“The club is aware of the allegations on social media and is in communication with the National Football League,” the Chiefs said. “We have no further comment at this time.”The National Football League confirmed it had been in contact with the team and was reviewing the matter. Now, with a formal lawsuit filed, the issue moves beyond statements and into a courtroom, where the claims and Rice’s response will be tested under oath.Rice’s football future once looked defined by records and championships. Now, it faces a different kind of scrutiny, one that does not unfold on a field.","Rashee Rice is being sued by his ex partner, Dacoda Nichole Jones, for $1 million.

While she aimed to inspire women and highlight unseen responsibilities, critics argued her comments seemed out of touch given her wealth and lifestyle. The debate underscores ongoing tensions between celebrity privilege, public perception, and the realities of living in the spotlight.

Brittany Mahomes faces backlash after calling NFL WAG life “incredibly hard”

Brittany Mahomes is not a newcomer in the world of publicity, yet her recent remarks concerning life as an NFL wife have created an online backlash. Wife to Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes , she seems to have a life that most fans dream of with friends who are very influential and could barely be spotted courtside.A recent interview however has uncovered a more complex truth, this one one that she attributes to having unseen forces and commitments behind the glamour.Brittany Mahomes' comments came at the time when viewers are growing more cynical of celebrity privilege. On the one hand, some fans admire her candidness, on the other, people claim that the grumbling about such a comfortable life is not relevant.The discussion soon transitioned into what she was actually trying to convey about wellness and empowerment to an even larger discussion surrounding thankfulness and visibility and what hardship actually really means in the limelight of the public eye.During a Sports Illustrated Swimsuit feature alongside other partners of professional athletes, Brittany emphasized her desire to inspire confidence and self-care. “I just hope that I’m inspiring women all around the world to still take care of themselves and focus on their health and wellness and still be confident in who they are,” she said.Another statement drew sharper reactions. “I think being the significant other to an NFL player is an incredibly hard role, and we take on a lot of important stuff behind the scenes that people don’t get to see,” she said.“But we also get to enjoy life and do things that we love, too.”Critics online were quick to push back. One commenter wrote, “Marrying a multimillionaire and not having to work sounds like my kind of hard,” while another added, “Being an NFL wife is hard because not only do you get all the benefits of fame/fortune without having to do any of the work yourself or suffering from any of the downsides of celebrity, but then on top of all that, if you get divorced you only get tens of millions of dollars in the settlement that you didn’t earn. Honestly hats off to these brave troopers. I don’t know how they do it.”The backlash highlights a familiar tension. At the same time, the perception of wealth and access can make empathy harder to earn.","Brittany Mahomes faces backlash after calling NFL WAG life “incredibly hard” Critics argued her comments seemed out of touch given her wealth and lifestyle.

Sources say they remain civil but distant, communicating mainly about parenting. With new relationships and different lifestyles, their bond has shifted, reflecting emotional distance while maintaining stability and mutual respect for their family.

Tom Brady and Gisele Bündchen ’s fragile co-parenting balance revealed by insiders

Life after divorce has settled into a quieter rhythm for Gisele Bündchen and Tom Brady, but peace did not arrive overnight. More than three years after ending their 13-year marriage, the former couple continues to redefine how they raise their two children while navigating new relationships and very different lifestyles. Their shared focus remains Benjamin and Vivian, even as their personal lives move in separate directions.Both have rebuilt their worlds. Bündchen remarried jiu-jitsu instructor Joaquim Valente and welcomed another child, while Brady has been linked to influencer Alix Earle following the New Year. These shifts have reshaped how the exes interact. What once was a tightly connected partnership is now a structured, respectful arrangement centered on parenting and stability.According to US Weekly, sources say communication between Tom Brady and Gisele Bündchen is purposeful rather than personal. “Tom and Gisele only communicate when it comes to the kids,” an insider revealed. “The dust has settled, but he tries not to meddle in her personal life. He hears things from the kids here and there, but tries to stay neutral. They have a good coparenting schedule.”The arrangement reflects a conscious effort to maintain consistency for their children while avoiding unnecessary tension.Another insider noted that their emotional distance reflects where they are in life today. “Tom and Gisele shared some mutual friends from the time they were married, but she doesn’t really socialize with them anymore. Her life has really changed,” the source said. “They share children and will always have that connection, but the divorce was not easy for either of them.”Bündchen has spoken openly about the realities of raising children across two households. ""Sometimes, I get pushback, especially because now they’re in two different homes, and there are two different ways,"" she explained. ""But I feel like I owe it to my kids because of what my mom taught me.” She has also acknowledged the emotional ebb and flow of co-parenting, admitting, ""I think there's easier days than others.""Those thoughts portray a contemporary co-parenting relationship based on respect, boundaries and shifting priorities. Although intimacy might be lost, there is still a working relationship.In the case of Bündchen and Brady, perfection is not the objective anymore. Stability, respecting each other, and having children that are secure in the changes surrounding them is what it is.","Tom Brady and Gisele Bündchen have settled into a structured co-parenting routine years after their divorce.

Donna Kelce’s candid wedding comment sparks debate over Taylor Swift–trsvis Kelce media control

Donna Kelce is keeping her cool as anticipation builds around one of the most talked-about celebrity weddings of the year. The mother of Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce recently offered a rare glimpse into her role in the upcoming ceremony between her son and global pop icon Taylor Swift. While details remain tightly guarded, her brief comments have only fueled curiosity about what the celebration might look like.Speaking to TMZ, Donna Kelce appeared both amused and thoughtful when asked about the traditional mother-son dance. “Oh, I’m sure it’ll be interesting, I’m sure,” she said, hinting that choosing the perfect song may take some reflection. The lighthearted remark reflects the balance she has struck throughout the whirlwind romance, staying supportive while letting the couple keep the spotlight.Donna also dismissed speculation that she was required to sign a confidentiality agreement. “Oh, no, no, they know I can keep a secret!” she joked, reinforcing the tight circle of trust surrounding the event. The question surfaced after broadcaster Graham Norton revealed he signed multiple NDAs after receiving an invitation, adding to the mystique around the ceremony.Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce, both 36, announced their engagement in August 2025 after two years of dating.Since then, wedding plans have been closely guarded. Reports suggest the couple intends to marry in Rhode Island in June 2026, though they have also explored a stylish venue in Tennessee. Initial accounts positioned the event as an intimate and casual affair, although, with changing plans, a more high-profile and celebrity-laden affair are an indication.The list of people alone has been making headlines. It has been speculated that Selena Gomez and Gigi Hadid will be bridesmaids; pre-nuptial benefits of Blake Lively attending have been mentioned in relation to the alleged distance in her friendship with Swift. Insiders suggest her presence could trigger intense media attention.For Donna Kelce, the moment remains deeply personal despite the global spotlight. She previously danced to “Love Shack” with her older son Jason at his wedding, and fans now wonder whether another memorable musical moment awaits.

Inside Total Chess World Championship Tour: Qualification, Format & New Rules Revealed

Fabiano Caruana and Carissa Yip have successfully defended their titles as US Chess Champions in 2025.Caruana secured his fifth overall championship, becoming the first player since Bobby Fischer to win the title four times in a row.Yip claimed her third straight title and fourth overall championship, noting that she had skipped the 2022 event after her 2021 win.Both champions entered the final day with a half-point advantage but pursued different strategies.Caruana opted for a forced draw against Levon Aronian, then waited to see if Wesley So could defeat Grigoriy Oparin and force a playoff.So generated minor pressure against Oparin's Sveshnikov opening but couldn't find the precise moves to maximise his position. The game concluded in a pawn-up endgame that Oparin managed to draw comfortably.Yip faced a more challenging situation with three competitors close behind, including Alice Lee and Anna Sarksyan playing against each other. A decisive result in the Lee-Sarksyan match or an Irina Krush victory over Anna Zatonskih would trigger a playoff if Yip drew.Choosing an aggressive approach, Yip pursued a win playing Black against Thalia Cervantes and succeeded.The Zatonskih-Krush match ended in a draw, while the Lee-Sarksyan game appeared headed toward the same outcome. However, Lee's earlier risky play caught up with her when she missed a tactical opportunity, allowing Sargsyan to secure clear second place in her US Women's Championship debut.Caruana earned $62,000 for his victory, while Yip collected $40,000 plus an additional $5,000 Finish Strong bonus prize for scoring 5½/6 in the final six rounds.The Saint Louis Chess Club will next host Clutch Chess: Champions Showdown from October 27-29.The event will feature Caruana competing against Hikaru Nakamura, Magnus Carlsen, and Gukesh Dommaraju.","Fabiano Caruana and Carissa Yip have successfully defended their titles as US Chess Champions in 2025.

ACB spokesperson condemns 'barbaric attack' that killed 3 Afghanistan cricketers

NEW DELHI: Shan Masood has announced that he will step down as Pakistan’s Test captain, following the team’s defeat in the second Test against South Africa in Rawalpindi. He is set to join the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) as a consultant for international cricket.The announcement was made by PCB chairman Mohsin Naqvi during a reception for the Pakistan and South African teams at Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif’s residence, according to a report on Friday.“We have appointed Masood as director of international cricket in PCB,” Naqvi said, surprising many as the decision came a week before the deadline for applications for the post.Since Masood plays only Tests, which are scheduled sporadically, he will combine his playing duties with the consultant role.If implemented, this would be the first time at the international level that a player simultaneously holds a position on the Board.However, his appointment raises questions over compliance with the PCB Constitution, which prohibits active players from holding board positions; such roles are officially reserved for retired cricketers.Masood succeeds Usman Wahla, the previous director of international cricket, who was suspended during the Asia Cup after delaying an email concerning a protest against match referee Andy Pycroft.Wahla had advised Pakistan captain Salman Agha not to shake hands with India’s Suryakumar Yadav. The PCB subsequently wrote to the International Cricket Council requesting Pycroft’s removal, which the ICC rejected, instead arranging a meeting between Pakistan team officials and Pycroft, who expressed regret.Wahla, who maintains strong political ties with the ruling Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz), was later reinstated.The PCB had advertised the director role with eligibility criteria requiring candidates to have played both Tests and ODIs for Pakistan.Masood, who has represented the country in 44 Tests, 9 ODIs, and 19 T20Is, meets these qualifications. Local media had suggested former captain Misbah-ul-Haq as a frontrunner for the post, though he declined to apply.",Shan Masood has announced that he will step down as Pakistan’s Test captain.

Rohit Sharma's record-breaking knock vs Virat Kohli’s duck | India vs Australia 2nd ODI

Kuldeep, the missing link

Aussie bowling brilliance

India didn’t see this one coming. Against an Australia batting lineup deep in transition and without a single familiar match-winner in the middle order, the consensus among fans was that it would be a walk in the park in the ODI series for Shubman Gill’s men.It turned out to be exactly the opposite. The young Aussie batters rode through choppy waters and with a two-wicket win at the Adelaide Oval on Thursday, the series is now wrapped up 2-0.The Indian fans, though, had something to cheer about as Rohit Sharma sprang back to life with a fighting 97-ball 73. But Virat Kohli’s second duck of the series was a serious dampener, and now the sell-out at Sydney Cricket Ground on Saturday will be all about the ‘Ro-Ko’ farewell — if not anything else, definitely in Australia.Even as the Aussies chose to leave out the likes of Cameron Green, Josh Inglis, and Marnus Labuschagne — probably allowing them preparation time for the Ashes — they went in with all their top-flight bowlers, barring an injured Pat Cummins.Josh Hazlewood, Mitchell Starc, and Adam Zampa are masters of these conditions, and with medium-pacer Xavier Bartlett too chipping in with the wickets of Shubman Gill (9), Virat Kohli (0), and Washington Sundar , the score ended up being a modest 264.There was a time when it used to be enough. Had Jasprit Bumrah and Kuldeep Yadav been playing, it might still have been, even on Thursday. The Indian bowlers kept chipping in with wickets, but there was no one to hit the knock-out punch when the Aussie rookies built those pockets of resistance.No. 3 Matt Short (74 off 78 balls) did make use of the two lives that he got, while No. 7 Mitchell Owen (36 off 23 balls) ensured that he would attract a lot of interest from IPL franchises. But Cooper Connolly, a 22-year-old southpaw who looked a mess against India during the course of a nine-ball duck as an opener in the Champions Trophy semifinal earlier in the year, was the hero of the day. Mixing caution with aggression, the No. 6 showed superb temperament during the course of his 61 not out off 53 balls to take the Aussies home, even as wickets kept falling around him.Kuldeep Yadav was seen obliging selfie hunters long after the game was over. The left-arm wrist spinner would have enjoyed the adulation even more if he had won the game for India.But then, he wasn’t given a chance, yet again. India chose to play with eight batters, with allrounder Nitish Reddy batting at No. 8. Reddy scored a 10-ball 8 and bowled three overs for 24 without a wicket, as Kuldeep sat in the dug-out.The Australian middle order, time and time again, showed their frailties against spin. Against the finger-spin of Washington Sundar and Axar Patel, the likes of Matt Renshaw and Alex Carey found ways to get out. But Kuldeep wasn’t there to deal the killer blow on inexperienced Connolly and Owen when they were running away with the game during the course of their 59-run sixth-wicket partnership.While India’s lack of teeth in bowling at the crunch became a point of discussion, it was the Aussie attack that stole the show in the first couple of hours.Hazlewood (0-29) probably bowled the best spell of his life where he didn’t get a wicket. Hitting the right length, which had the batsmen guessing whether to go forward or back, the paceman made life miserable for Rohit. With the runs completely drying up against Hazlewood, Gill had to take a chance against Bartlett, but he was caught superbly at mid-off by Mitchell Marsh. In the same over, the pacer removed Kohli with a little off-cutter, and India were 17-2 in the seventh over.There was a fightback, courtesy Rohit and Shreyas Iyer (61 off 77 balls), but then it was over to Adam Zampa (4-60). The leggie, with his subtle variations of pace and turn, removed Iyer, a top player of spin. Axar Patel and KL Rahul are equally good, and had any one of them been there till the end, India could easily have pushed for 300.",Australia beat India by two wickets in second ODI in Adelaide. Cooper Connolly scored 61 not out off 53 balls to take Aussies home. Virat Kohli's second duck of the series was a serious dampener.

SYDNEY: Record-breaking striker Sam Kerr has vowed to reclaim the captaincy of Australia, declaring she has ""so much more to give"" in the role.Kerr is poised to make her first Matildas appearance in almost two years when Australia meet Wales in Cardiff this weekend.The 32-year-old returned to club football for Chelsea in September after a long rehabilitation from a serious knee injury sustained in December 2023.During her absence she went through a high-profile court case in London, where she was found not guilty of racially aggravated harassment of a police officer during a drunken night out.However, the judge said her ""behaviour contributed significantly to the bringing of this allegation"".Kerr was appointed captain in 2019, with Arsenal defender Steph Catley typically skippering the side since her injury.""On being the captain, of course I still feel really passionate about that,"" she told Australian media from Wales.""I know I have so much more to give for this team in a leadership role, and this team here will make football decisions, and I feel like football-wise, I'm one of the best leaders in the team.""So I feel really passionate and proud that I've been in that position before, and hopefully continue forward.""Coach Joe Montemurro has yet to make a decision on who will wear the armband against Wales where Kerr -- Australia's all-time leading goalscorer -- is unlikely to play the full match.She has managed limited minutes for Chelsea since returning but expects to be back to full fitness soon with the women's Asian Cup in Australia next March a key motivation.""The Asian Cup is so important,"" she said.

NEW DELHI: India will look to avoid a clean sweep when they take on Australia in the third and final ODI at the Sydney Cricket Ground on Saturday. After losing the second ODI in Adelaide by two wickets, the visitors are trailing 0-2 in the three-match series and will be eager to end the tour on a high.With just a day’s break between games, India have little time to regroup and must find answers quickly to prevent their first ODI series whitewash since the 2022 tour of South Africa.Rohit Sharma’s fighting 73 and Shreyas Iyer’s composed 61 offered resistance in Adelaide, but the spotlight remains on Virat Kohli’s rare dip in form — having registered back-to-back ducks for the first time in his ODI career. Both senior batters, possibly featuring in their final ODI on Australian soil, will hope to finish the series on a high note.However, the biggest talking point ahead of the Sydney ODI is whether Kuldeep Yadav will finally get a game. The left-arm wrist spinner has been benched for the first two matches, even as Australia’s Adam Zampa spun his side to victory in Adelaide with four wickets and the Player-of-the-Match award.Former cricketer Aakash Chopra believes it’s time for India to bring Kuldeep into the XI, given Sydney’s reputation for assisting spin.“Kuldeep likely to play at Sydney. Perhaps, a slightly spin-friendly surface…could easily come in for a pacer. Given the batting performance in the first two ODIs, I’m not expecting the team to drop a batter for a bowler. Very unlikely,” Chopra wrote on X.India’s combination has looked slightly unbalanced without a seam-bowling all-rounder like Hardik Pandya. Players such as Yashasvi Jaiswal, Kuldeep Yadav, and Prasidh Krishna are waiting in the wings, and a few changes are expected for the final game.India, the top-ranked ODI side, have now lost two matches in a row after an eight-match winning streak. Stand-in captain Shubman Gill faces a key selection test — and giving Kuldeep a chance could be both a tactical and psychological boost.Australia, meanwhile, will be strengthened by the return of wicketkeeper Josh Inglis, while Marnus Labuschagne has exited the squad. Left-arm spinner Matthew Kuhnemann and all-rounder Jack Edwards have been added for the Sydney match. Zampa and pacer Xavier Bartlett — who dismissed Gill and Kohli in Adelaide — will again be crucial as Australia eye a 3-0 sweep at home.: Saturday, October 259:00 AM IST: Sydney Cricket Ground, SydneyStar Sports Network for live TV broadcast and JioHotstar for live streamingThe weather forecast for Saturday looks ideal for cricket in Sydney, according to Accuweather. Temperatures are expected to range from a comfortable 17°C in the morning to a pleasant 25°C during the day. With the pitch expected to improve under the lights, both teams are likely to prefer chasing, aiming for a result rather than a cautious approach.Travis Head, Mitch Marsh (c), Matt Short, Matt Renshaw, Alex Carey (wk), Cooper Connolly, Mitch Owen, Mitchell Starc/Jack Edwards, Xavier Bartlett, Adam Zampa, Josh HazlewoodRohit Sharma, Shubman Gill (c), Virat Kohli, Shreyas Iyer, Axar Patel, KL Rahul (wk), Nitish Kumar Reddy/Dhruv Jurel, Washington Sundar/Kuldeep Yadav, Harshit Rana/Prasidh Krishna, Mohammad Siraj, Arshdeep Singh: Shubman Gill (captain), Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, Shreyas Iyer, KL Rahul (wk), Axar Patel, Washington Sundar, Nitish Kumar Reddy, Mohammed Siraj, Harshit Rana, Arshdeep Singh, Dhruv Jurel (wk), Yashasvi Jaiswal, Kuldeep Yadav, and Prasidh Krishna.: Mitchell Marsh (captain), Xavier Bartlett, Alex Carey (wk), Cooper Connolly, Jack Edwards, Nathan Ellis, Josh Hazlewood, Travis Head, Josh Inglis (wk), Matthew Kuhnemann, Mitchell Owen, Josh Philippe, Matthew Renshaw, Matthew Short, Mitchell Starc, and Adam Zampa.","India will look to avoid a clean sweep when they take on Australia in the third and final ODI at the Sydney Cricket Ground on Saturday.

NEW DELHI: Amid the handshake controversy, the no-trophy celebration, alleged disrespect during India’s national anthem, India’s Asia Cup triumph, retaining India’s title-winning trophy in his possession, and sudden changes in Pakistan’s captaincy, one figure dominated the headlines — PCB chief Mohsin Naqvi.The Asia Cup final was a spectacle of chaos and controversy. India refused to accept the winning trophy from Naqvi, who then walked off with it, while Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha tossed the runners-up cheque. The dramatic events overshadowed the on-field action, leaving cricket fans stunned.Despite the turmoil, India secured their ninth Asia Cup title overall (ODIs + T20Is) and their second in the T20I format.In the aftermath, Naqvi made sweeping decisions in Pakistan cricket. He appointed Shaheen Shah Afridi as the new ODI captain, replacing Mohammad Rizwan. Soon after, Naqvi announced that Shan Masood, stepping down as Pakistan Test captain, would join the PCB as a consultant for international cricket.From trophy controversies to captaincy shake-ups, the Mohsin Naqvi-led PCB continues to make headlines for all the wrong reasons.Tensions flared from the start as India captain Suryakumar Yadav and Pakistan skipper Salman Ali Agha refused to shake hands. Naqvi was present but largely in the backdrop.After India’s win, players refused to accept the trophy from Mohsin Naqvi, who waited on stage for nearly 20 minutes as the ceremony stalled.The ceremony was delayed by over an hour when Naqvi walked off with the trophy, leaving the champions empty-handed.Indian fans reacted angrily, chanting “Bharat Mata Ki Jai” and repeatedly booing Naqvi.Organisers arranged for Khalid Al Zarooni, vice-chairman of the Emirates Cricket Board, to hand over the trophy instead.The Naqvi vs India episode became the defining controversy of the final, overshadowing even Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha’s antics.During the ACC meeting on September 30, various reports surfaced claiming that Naqvi had apologised to the BCCI for the chaos that unfolded after the Asia Cup final.Naqvi later claimed he never apologised to the BCCI for the trophy-lifting fiasco. In his outlandish statement, a defiant Naqvi set a bizarre condition: if India “truly” wanted the trophy, they could come to the ACC office to collect it from him.The Asia Cup trophy has been locked at the ACC’s Dubai headquarters with instructions that it should not be moved or handed over without the Chairman’s approval.In a major shake-up ahead of Pakistan’s three-match ODI series against South Africa from November 4–8 at Faisalabad’s Iqbal Stadium, pacer Shaheen Shah Afridi was appointed as ODI captain, replacing wicket-keeper batter Mohammad Rizwan. Naqvi faced criticism for frequent captaincy changes, having removed Shaheen earlier in 2024, reinstated Babar Azam, and then appointed Rizwan months ago.The BCCI and PCB are headed for a showdown at next month’s ICC meeting as Naqvi refuses to budge on personally handing over the Asia Cup trophy to India in his capacity as ACC head. In a reply to the BCCI and other ACC member nations, Naqvi insisted he is willing to organise a ceremony on November 10 in Dubai, where a BCCI representative and any available Indian player can collect the trophy.""The ACC trophy rightly belongs to the Indian cricket team and is being held in trust till such time that a BCCI office holder along with any available participating player can collect the same from the ACC President,"" Naqvi wrote.""Such collection would of course be accompanied with much fanfare and coverage as there should be no deviation from established practices and no precedent should be set which undermines the spirit of the game we all love.""Naqvi has offered to organise an event in Dubai on November 10, where the Asia Cup can be officially handed over to the Indian men’s cricket team. The proposal follows a series of exchanges between the ACC and BCCI.Shan Masood is set to step down as Pakistan Test captain, announcing his decision a day after losing the second match against South Africa in Rawalpindi. He will soon join the PCB as a consultant for international cricket. The announcement was made by Naqvi.","Mohsin Naqvi has been at the centre of a series of controversies.

Rohit Sharma's record-breaking knock vs Virat Kohli’s duck | India vs Australia 2nd ODI

NW DELHI: Former India cricketer Mohammad Kaif has urged the team management to include either Harshit Rana or Nitish Kumar Reddy in the playing XI, while criticising the decision to leave out Kuldeep Yadav from the first two ODIs against Australia. India suffered a two-wicket defeat in the second ODI, giving Australia an unassailable 2-0 lead in the three-match series, with the final game set to be played in Sydney on Saturday.Kaif shared his thoughts on his YouTube channel, expressing doubts about Harshit Rana’s bowling strengths and pointing out the lack of a standout delivery in his arsenal.""I'm following Harshit Rana a lot, but he does not have a strength delivery. It's not like he has a solid outswinger or an inswinger. When we speak about Siraj or Bumrah, they have their strengths, like their yorkers, pace, or slower ones. But I can't figure out what Harshit Rana's strength is. It's not like he bowls over 140. Play either one of Rana or Reddy, because both of them can't play together. Kuldeep Yadav sitting out for this is a clear injustice,"" Kaif stated.Kaif further explained that while Rana performs effectively when the required run rate is high, he struggles when batters adopt a more cautious approach.""When the required rate is 9 or 10 runs per over, there Harshit Rana is effective because his strength is change of pace.But when batters are playing like Test cricket when the required rate is around 5 or 6 runs per over, the bowler has to bring more skills to outfox the batter when he is playing in 3rd gear.""Citing Adam Zampa’s match-winning spell as an example, Kaif said Kuldeep’s exclusion cost India dearly. Zampa took four wickets and was named player of the match in Adelaide.""If Kuldeep was in the team, I guarantee you 100 percent that India would have won this game. When Zampa can come in and change the game by dismissing some big names, when there was grip and turn from the surface, then think what Kuldeep could have done against this inexperienced Australian middle order. This is a do-or-die match, you are not playing him, and Zampa, who was not even there in the last match, returned and took the man of the match. Kuldeep Yadav is a thousand times better bowler than Adam Zampa.""","Former India cricketer Mohammad Kaif has urged the team management to include either Harshit Rana or Nitish Kumar Reddy in the playing XI.

Rohit Sharma's record-breaking knock vs Virat Kohli’s duck | India vs Australia 2nd ODI

In their 1,068-match ODI history, India have suffered five whitewashes in bilateral series — 1983 vs West Indies (5-0), 1989 vs West Indies (5-0), 2006 vs South Africa (4-0), 2020 vs New Zealand (3-0), and 2022 vs South Africa (3-0). Saturday could be the sixth if head coach Gautam Gambhir and captain Shubman Gill do not get their act together at a venue where India have suffered 16 losses out of 19 against Australia — the Sydney Cricket Ground.Sydney was the venue where Virat Kohli last played for India in Tests. It was also the venue where Rohit Sharma dropped himself from the final Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy last year, only to never play for India again in whites. If the raised gloves, an act of silent acknowledgment of the appreciative Adelaide crowd during his walk back to the pavilion after registering his second successive duck, were any hint, then Sydney could be the last time the Aussies could see Kohli live in India colours.It was the same venue where he had infamously flipped the bird to an abusive section of fans during his first visit back in 2011.If we keep the BGT aside, Rohit Sharma will have some pleasant memories in Australia’s most buzzing city. He is the only player in the Indian set-up who was part of both the wins that India have had over the Aussies at the SCG. In the 2008 CB Tri-Series first final, he made an 87-ball 66 and shared a 123-run stand for the fourth wicket with Sachin Tendulkar (117*) to help India chase down 240.In 2016, as an established white-ball opener, Rohit scored a 108-ball 99 and added 97 with player-of-the-match Manish Pandey (104*) to help India avoid a whitewash and chase down 331 with two balls to spare.That match also marked the legendary Jasprit Bumrah’s international debut. He had been picked to play only the three-match T20I series that was to follow the ODIs, but an injury-plagued bowling attack meant Bumrah had to literally step out of the plane, strap his bowling boots on, and play. He made an instant impact with 2 for 40 from his 10 overs.Bumrah will be in town again, having landed with the T20 team on Friday. But expect no favours this time around. He will be there only for the T20Is.And truth be told, the combinations India have fielded in the two ODIs Down Under and the tactics they have employed, they deserve no favours. Bulking up the batting line-up by picking three all-rounders and going thin on the bowling resources, and making a match-winner like Kuldeep Yadav warm the bench, was a strategy that was bound to backfire on the firmer and truer surfaces of Australia.Harshit Rana may have made a buccaneering contribution with the bat in Adelaide and may have bowled incisively in his first spell in which he got Travis Head out, but the way his pace dropped after he came back for the second spell, with his execution of slower cutters all over the place, making him cannon fodder for Mitch Owen, suggests that he still does not have it in him to play for India across formats. Some more miles in the legs by playing in domestic cricket may be the way to go.India can try the option of using Prasidh Krishna, a tall, hit-the-deck operator, to replace Rana, and with the series already gone, they could be more uninhibited and try out Yashasvi Jaiswal at the top. The team management should also ponder whether they are making optimum use of KL Rahul at No. 6.Axar Patel is a fantastic multi-skilled cricketer, but he is no Brian Lara or Yuvraj Singh to consistently get a gig at No. 5 on surfaces that are helpful for bowlers. Maybe Rahul, who averages 56.47 in 31 innings at that spot and has a strike rate of 96.36 there, is a better option. India’s depth in white-ball cricket, thanks to the IPL, is often the envy of teams all over the world. In Adelaide, the Aussies showed off that the Big Bash isn’t far behind as a talent stable. Matt Short (Adelaide Strikers), Cooper Connolly (Perth Scorchers), and Mitch Owen (Hobart Hurricanes) silenced their IPL counterparts.India’s record in bilateral ODIs post the 2019 World Cup hasn’t been great. They have lost series to New Zealand (away), South Africa (away), Bangladesh (away), Sri Lanka (away), and Australia (twice — away and once at home).Time for the bragging to end. There is work to do.","Sydney was the venue where Virat Kohli last played for India in Tests.

Rohit Sharma's record-breaking knock vs Virat Kohli’s duck | India vs Australia 2nd ODI

Nitish Kumar Reddy was fast-tracked into the Indian team last year as a key piece to the puzzle of forming the perfect playing XI. Now, it appears the team management is unsure about the seambowling allrounder’s exact role. Can he actually be Hardik Pandya ’s like-for-like backup? For someone who scored a Test hundred in trying circumstances at the MCG last year and has an established IPL reputation batting up the order, Reddy is now relegated to No. 8 and seldom called on to bowl in key moments of the game.The team management under head coach Gautam Gambhir insisted Reddy needed more game time in international cricket, even as he bowled just four overs in the two Tests at home against West Indies this month. He was given an opportunity to bat at No. 5 in the second Test after Yashasvi Jaiswal and Shubman Gill had already put up a huge score on the board.On paper, his skills provide absolute balance to the team. But he gets to do too little on the park. That India went without an out-and-out strike spinner like Kuldeep Yadav in the first two ODIs in Australia played a major part in India losing the series in Adelaide before reaching Sydney for the third and final ODI on Saturday.The underutilization of Reddy is somewhat reminiscent of how Shardul Thakur played the two Test matches in England this summer. Gill, as a captain, makes his reluctance in a player very apparent with his tactics on the park.Thakur bowled just 27 out of the 339 overs India bowled in Leeds and Manchester. During the second Test against West Indies in Delhi, India’s assistant coach Ryan ten Doeschate conceded that the team management now wonders if Kuldeep could have been played instead in those two matches in England.This raises the question of whether the team management and captain are on the same page when it comes to picking the XI. Former India wicketkeeper Deep Dasgupta, who has been following the team closely as a broadcaster, said, “First, one has to check if Gill and Gambhir are on the same page. It could also stem from lack of conviction. Gill will get more clarity about what he exactly wants from his team. They are trying to give Reddy exposure, but that can’t happen by just standing in the field doing very little,” Dasgupta told TOI.Since Gambhir has assumed the head coach’s position, he has been very forthright about his vision of playing with a team that has batting depth, even if it results in sacrificing a strike bowler. “Modern-day white-ball cricket demands batting depth. India’s real problem is their usual No. 9, 10 and 11 are quintessential tailenders. Kuldeep can hold his own as a batter, but you can’t compare it to the tailenders of the SENA countries. Reddy is a batter who can bowl. The person who bats at No. 8 has to be the other way around. And without Bumrah, Kuldeep has to be the big strike bowler,” claimed Dasgupta.One can’t fault the team management for craving a genuine seambowling allrounder in the mould of Ben Stokes , Pandya and Cameron Green. Reddy, however, is far from the finished product. One may recall that when Pandya’s bowling took a backseat in 2021, the selectors were reluctant to play him as a batter until he recovered to bowl at full tilt. Reddy the bowler is not bankable enough for Gill.“I hope they don’t get stuck with finding Pandya’s like-for-like backup. They have to be flexible with the options they have. Even if they want to persist with Reddy, he needs to be looked at differently and thrown into the deeper end,” Dasgupta reckoned.Gill is very early into his captaincy career. He has found himself in situations when he is operating with less than 11 players on the park due to his lack of confidence in certain players. He got away with it in England, but it is most likely that he will be found out soon in international cricket.","Nitish Kumar Reddy was fast-tracked into the Indian team last year as a key piece to the puzzle of forming the perfect playing XI.

Poll Will Virat Kohli bounce back in the third ODI against Australia? Yes, he will score runs No, he will struggle again

Former Indian pacer Irfan Pathan has stressed the importance of strike rotation for Virat Kohli ahead of the third ODI against Australia at the Sydney Cricket Ground.The match will be Kohli ’s final game in the series, where he has struggled with the bat, having been dismissed for ducks in the first two ODIs.“Virat Kohli's form is important. He needs to rotate the strike and keep the scoreboard moving. Because once he starts doing that, it becomes very difficult for any opposition to stop him. I hope Virat starts rotating the strike quickly, gets some runs on the board, and once that happens, there's no looking back for him,” Pathan said.Kohli will be looking to end the series on a high and add valuable runs to India’s total.The SCG match also presents the chance for the star batter to demonstrate his class on Australian soil, a venue where he has previously produced match-winning performances.Former India cricketer Abhishek Nayar highlighted the role of India’s pacers in the final ODI.“With the kind of assistance they're getting on these Australian pitches, they need to make full use of the conditions and show that in their performances.I would like to see the Indian pacers, especially with the new ball, strike early and make that impact,” Nayar said.Fast bowlers Harshit Rana and Arshdeep Singh have shared six of India’s 11 wickets in the series so far, while Mohammed Siraj has picked up one. Arshdeep remains India’s leading pacer with three wickets at an average of 24.00, compared to Rana’s two wickets at 43.00 and Siraj’s solitary wicket at 70.Ex-India cricketer and commentator Aakash Chopra suggested that India might benefit from including spin in Sydney, where pitches tend to support spinners.“Three fast bowlers might not be needed in Sydney, because it is generally a spin-friendly pitch. Kuldeep Yadav enjoys bowling here; it is a big ground, and you can use that to your advantage in the middle overs. India should play Kuldeep and look to exploit the middle overs phase, creating wicket-taking opportunities and pressure through spin,” he said.Kuldeep has previously taken eight wickets at SCG across formats, including a five-wicket haul during the 2018/19 Border-Gavaskar Trophy.His inclusion could provide India with crucial breakthroughs in the middle overs.",Virat Kohli will play his final ODI Down Under on Saturday in Sydney.

Fans swarmed the Sydney airport on Friday as Team India arrived, eager to catch a glimpse of the 36-year-old maestro. Saturday’s atmosphere promises to be electric, as thousands of Indian supporters don the blue in what could be his last outing on Australian soil.Rohit Sharma, meanwhile, showed glimpses of his best in Adelaide, battling through challenging conditions for a gritty 73 off 97 balls. Both he and Kohli returned to international action after six months, and a win in Sydney would help India avoid a 3-0 whitewash and head into the T20I series with renewed confidence.Australia, who have already sealed the series, will look to complete a clean sweep. They will be strengthened by the return of wicketkeeper Josh Inglis, while spinner Matthew Kuhnemann and allrounder Jack Edwards have been added to the squad."," tickets for the third and final ODI between India and Australia at the Sydney Cricket Ground have officially sold out.

Rohit Sharma's record-breaking knock vs Virat Kohli’s duck | India vs Australia 2nd ODI

Poll Is Rohit Sharma deserving of a place in the top five greatest ODI cricketers? Yes, definitely. No, there are others better. Not sure.

NEW DELHi: Former India coach and 1983 World Cup winner Ravi Shastri has revealed his list of India’s five greatest ODI cricketers of all time, a star-studded lineup that includes Virat Kohli Sachin Tendulkar , MS Dhoni , Kapil Dev and Rohit Sharma .Speaking on FOX Cricket, Shastri placed Virat Kohli at the top, acknowledging his remarkable consistency and match-winning ability over more than a decade. Alongside Kohli, Shastri included three World Cup-winning players – Dhoni, Tendulkar and Kapil – forming the backbone of India’s golden era in one-day cricket.“I’ll go with Kohli, Tendulkar, Kapil Dev, MS Dhoni, and Rohit Sharma,” Shastri said. “And the only reason I’ve not put Bumrah there is because Bumrah has got another three or four years of cricket left. You know, these players, they’re more or less coming to the fag end of their careers. They’ve played over a decade, some over a decade and a half, so I would put… And it’s tough to pick. There are so many other good players when you look back. But these stand out for me.”Explaining his picks, Shastri highlighted the rare legacy of leadership and impact among the five icons. “They’ve been outstanding contributors. Two World Cup captains there, who won the World Cup as well.And barring Rohit Sharma, everyone in that list are World Cup winners. But you can’t take Rohit out of the mix with three double hundreds and over 11,000 runs. He’s number three in the list of run-getters. And all these on the given day are genuine match winners,” he added.Shastri’s chosen five collectively embody India’s ODI excellence across generations — Kapil Dev, the architect of the 1983 triumph; Tendulkar, the heartbeat of the 1990s and 2000s; Dhoni, the 2011 World Cup-winning captain; Kohli, the modern-era run machine; and Rohit Sharma, the record-breaking opener who led India to the 2023 World Cup final.","Former India coach and 1983 World Cup winner Ravi Shastri has revealed his list of India’s five greatest ODI cricketers of all time.

Rain once again disrupted proceedings at the ICC Women’s World Cup, as the group-stage match between Sri Lanka and Pakistan at the R Premadasa Stadium in Colombo was abandoned on Friday without a result.Persistent showers, which have plagued the tournament in the Sri Lankan capital, struck again after just 4.2 overs, with Pakistan on 18 without loss after being asked to bat first. Despite repeated efforts by ground staff to make the field playable, the unrelenting downpour returned, forcing officials to call off the match around 8:10 pm local time.The toss had already been delayed for more than three hours due to wet conditions and strong winds, marking yet another frustrating day for players and fans. This was the fifth washout in 11 matches at the Khettarama venue — a statistic that has raised serious questions over the tournament’s scheduling during the Northeast monsoon season, which typically brings heavy rain to the region in October.The outcome hurt Sri Lanka’s campaign, as the hosts ended their group stage fifth on the points table with five points (one win, three losses, and three no-results), effectively missing out on a semifinal berth.Pakistan, meanwhile, finished their disappointing run without a single win, collecting only three points from three washouts in seven matches.Amid the gloom, the abandoned fixture may also have marked the end of an era.For Sri Lanka skipper Chamari Athapaththu, who has led her side with distinction for over a decade, this was widely seen as her final ODI World Cup appearance.

Poll What do you think about Mohammad Kaif's praise of Rohit Sharma’s performance? He was spot on! I don't agree with his assessment It was exaggerated

Even without the captain’s armband, Rohit Sharma ’s influence on the field was immense during India’s second ODI against Australia in Adelaide. The hard fought match however, ended in the visitors eventually losing by two wickets.Rohit, who scored a composed 73 after a poor outing in the series opener, not only anchored India’s innings but also played an active role in guiding his teammates through key moments.His innings, along with Shreyas Iyer’s 61, helped India post 264 for 9. Despite their efforts, Australia chased down the target in 46.2 overs, with Adam Zampa earning the Player of the Match award for his four wickets.The moment that drew most attention came late in Australia’s innings when Rohit was seen stepping in to guide off-spinner Washington Sundar during a tense phase.With Shubman Gill officially leading the side, Rohit’s animated gestures and on-field advice reflected his continued involvement in India’s tactical play.Former India batter Mohammad Kaif praised Rohit’s performance and presence, calling him “a man who cannot bear to see India lose.” Kaif said, “Rohit Sharma has India running through his veins. The example was right there — the pitch was tough, the pressure was immense.Shubman Gill got out, Virat Kohli got out, but Rohit stood firm and scored runs when it mattered.”He further added, “What he did afterward with Shubman Gill on the ground showed what kind of person he is — a true professional. Even after being stripped of captaincy, he stayed involved. When the match got tense, Rohit was right there with Gill, guiding him and saying, ‘We have to win this; we cannot let India down.’”Kaif also highlighted Rohit’s approach after his batting stint, noting how he “went up to Arshdeep Singh, spoke to Gill, kept shouting instructions to the fielders, setting the field himself. He had already done his job with the bat, yet he kept fighting for the team.”While India fell short in Adelaide, Rohit’s determination and tactical awareness stood out. As Kaif summed up, “He’s someone who always wants India to win. Even though India lost the match, Rohit Sharma left no stone unturned in sharing his experience and leadership on the field.”","Rohit Sharma top scored for India with 73 from 97 balls.

LEEDS: Nuno Espirito Santo became the first West Ham coach since 2018 to go winless in his first four games as his struggling team showed the same defensive frailties that have plagued it all season in a 2-1 loss to Leeds in the Premier League on Friday.The Portuguese coach joined the Hammers a month ago after leading Nottingham Forest to a place in Europe but he has been unable to turn things around quickly in east London.He now has three losses and one draw since taking over, a record equal to that of Manuel Pellegrini when he took charge of the club in 2018.Off the field, supporters have expressed their discontent with the board, with thousands boycotting Monday night's loss at home to Brentford.The team has defended poorly all season - conceding nine goals from corners, three times more than any other side - leading to the sacking of Graham Potter. And it was 2-0 down after just 15 minutes at Leeds thanks once again to hesitant defending.Goalkeeper Alphonse Areola could not hold Noah Okafor's header after three minutes and US international Brenden Aaronson pounced to sidefoot home the loose ball as the West Ham defenders watched on.The back line was equally lackadaisical 12 minutes later when Joe Rodon headed home unchallenged from a corner kick.Mateus Fernandes' deft header in the final minute gave the Hammers a consolation goal but an equalizer never looked likely.The win lifts Leeds into 13th place on 11 points, while West Ham is 19th with four points and the league's worst goal difference.That points tally is its joint worst at this stage of the season.

Poll Do you believe placing Sheffield Wednesday into administration was the right decision? Yes, it was necessary. No, it was a mistake.

Struggling Championship side Sheffield Wednesday have entered administration, triggering an automatic 12-point deduction under English Football League (EFL) regulations.The decision leaves the club at the bottom of the table on minus six points, 15 adrift of safety.The club confirmed the move on Friday, announcing the appointment of an insolvency firm to oversee operations.The development follows months of financial uncertainty and repeated protests from supporters demanding the exit of owner Dejphon Chansiri, whose tenure has been marked by controversy and missed wage payments.Joint administrator Kris Wigfield explained the reasoning behind the decision, stating, “Like many football clubs, (Sheffield Wednesday) have been trading at a significant loss for several years, with those losses historically funded by the former owner Mr Chansiri.Due to increased financial pressure on the club, the owner has chosen to place the club and the stadium company into administration which will enable us to market the club and the stadium as a whole, which is great news for supporters of the club.”The EFL, while confirming the 12-point penalty, described the situation as an opportunity for “a successful sale and secure future under new ownership.”Fan discontent had reached a breaking point in recent weeks. Thousands of supporters boycotted the home fixture against Middlesbrough earlier this week, where Wednesday fell to a 1-0 defeat, intensifying calls for Chansiri to sell.The Sheffield Wednesday Supporters’ Trust called it “one of the most bittersweet days in our club’s proud 158-year history,” adding that administration was “the inevitable outcome of years of financial mismanagement, a lack of accountability and repeated failures to engage credible buyers.”Despite the uncertainty, the Trust expressed optimism, noting that there is “strong interest from prospective buyers” and that a fan-led takeover proposal is being prepared to safeguard the club’s future.Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy also weighed in, urging for a quick resolution, saying, “Everyone who loves the club will be hoping for a resolution as soon as possible.”","Sheffield Wednesday have entered administration, triggering an automatic 12-point deduction under English Football League regulations.

Real Madrid, currently leading La Liga by two points, will aim to overcome Barcelona's dominance from last season's four Clasico victories when they meet at the Santiago Bernabeu on Sunday, with in-form striker Kylian Mbappe leading their charge in the 2025-26 season.Barcelona, under Hansi Flick, secured a domestic treble last season, defeating Madrid twice in La Liga and winning both the Copa del Rey and Spanish Super Cup finals, which led to Carlo Ancelotti's departure.New Madrid coach Xabi Alonso has made a strong start, though questions remain about the team's performance in crucial matches following losses to PSG in the Club World Cup semi-finals and a 5-2 defeat to Atletico Madrid.A victory would extend Madrid's lead to five points over Barcelona, who haven't matched their previous season's form under Flick.Mbappe has emerged as Madrid's key player this season, scoring in 11 consecutive matches for club and country before Wednesday's Champions League victory over Juventus, where Jude Bellingham scored the winner.The French striker has contributed 10 of Madrid's 20 La Liga goals, leading the scoring charts in Spain, and has netted 15 times across all competitions, accounting for 54 percent of the team's goals.""We're not dependent on him,"" said Madrid coach Alonso last week. ""We are very happy with his performance, he's being decisive.""Mbappe's journey at Madrid hasn't always been smooth, particularly evident in his first Clasico a year ago, where Barcelona won 4-0 at the Bernabeu.In that match, Mbappe struggled against Barcelona's high defensive line, having one goal disallowed and being caught offside eight times, leading Spanish newspaper AS to describe him as ""shrunken and without venom.""""It's time to change my situation and show who I am as a player,"" Mbappe declared weeks later amid Madrid's difficulties.The French forward showed improvement in subsequent Clasicos, scoring in both the Spanish Super Cup final's 5-2 loss and the Copa del Rey final's 3-2 defeat.Mbappe's evolution continued with a hat-trick against Barcelona in May, though Madrid still lost 4-3 at the Olympic stadium.This season, Turkish midfielder Arda Guler has developed an effective partnership with Mbappe, consistently finding the striker's forward runs.""Arda gets between the lines and there he finds Mbappe well,"" Alonso explained.Real Madrid have won their last 10 home matches across all competitions, matching their best run in a decade.Barcelona have drawn 44 offsides this season in La Liga, the highest among Europe's top five leagues.In the historical head-to-head record, Real Madrid leads with 105 Clasico wins to Barcelona's 104, with 52 draws.Santiago Bernabeu Stadium in Madrid26 October, 20258:45pm IST (11:15am EDT/10:15am CDT/8:15am PDT/3:15pm GMT/3:15pm BST)ESPN2, ESPN2 Deportes (in the USA), Disney+FanCode (India), ESPN App (USA), Premier Sports (UK)","Real Madrid host Barcelona at the Santiago Bernabeu in the first Clasico of the La Liga season.

Real Madrid player Dani Carvajal implored La Liga chief Javier Tebas to not take a league game to Miami.

What does it mean?

What happens next?

La Liga's plan to move Barcelona's trip to face Villarreal in December to Miami in the United States collapsed this week under heavy pressure within Spain.La Liga have been trying to move a match to the US since 2018, when they planned to take Girona v Barcelona to Miami.This year's attempt was as close as they have got, after getting the green light from European football governing body UEFA and the Spanish football federation (RFEF).However with under six weeks to go until the scheduled kick-off, between Villarreal and Barcelona, La Liga were forced to abandon their plan.Their US-based promoter, Relevent Sports said they would cancel arranging the game because of ""uncertainty generated in Spain"" around the match, and a lack of time.It left La Liga licking their wounds, with president Javier Tebas ruing the loss of a ""historic opportunity"" to play the first ever overseas European league match.Tebas was hoping to follow the lead of the NFL and NBA in taking their product abroad, further breaking into the lucrative North American market and ""grow the competition's value"".La Liga players across Spain standing still for the first 15 seconds of their matches last weekend proved an impactful protest.It was organised by the Spanish footballers' association (AFE), who were upset at not being consulted about the plans and criticised a ""lack of transparency and collaboration"".They said that game being moved to the US breached the players' collective bargaining agreement, and further added to a high workload and travel-packed schedule.Spanish giants Real Madrid were particularly vociferous opponents to the scheme, insisting it would ""adulterate"" the competition, and twice writing to the country's Sports Council (CSD) demanding action be taken.Los Blancos captain Dani Carvajal said the Miami game would be a ""stain"" on La Liga, while coach Xabi Alonso also railed at it on multiple occasions.Madrid goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois criticised the players' protest not being shown on La Liga's broadcast of last weekend's action, saying the league hiding it was ""censorship and manipulation"".Even Barcelona coach Hansi Flick and midfielder Frenkie de Jong said they were against the match being played in Miami.De Jong admitted it was ""not fair in terms of competition"" because an away game would take place at a neutral ground.It's back to the drawing board for a frustrated La Liga, although in the long run they will be heartened by getting as close as they did this time. ""We will keep trying,"" insisted Tebas.However Villarreal were left seething at a ""lack of respect"" from the Spanish top flight, who announced the cancellation during their Champions League match against Manchester City on Tuesday.The Yellow Submarine also hammered La Liga's management of the event and said they might have pulled out later this week in any case, citing logistic hurdles which La Liga could not offer them answers to.Villarreal cast doubt on La Liga's competency to arrange a match abroad. Other teams watching on may be less keen on being a part of a future project as a result, with its credibility taking a knock.Clubs will also note the unhappiness of several fan groups about the match being moved, and also a discrepancy regarding payment.Barcelona president Joan Laporta said his team would cash in thanks to the game, while Villarreal said all gains should be going to their fans, in the form of flights to Miami or discounts on their season tickets if they did not decide to travel.La Liga and Tebas will keep pushing to make it happen, determined that taking the game abroad is the best way to grow.In the meantime the league is also attempting to sue the AFE, according to Spanish reports, because of the 15-second players standstill which they are labelling a strike.La Liga might be better off learning to foster better communication with other football bodies in the future to take their plan to fruition.The CSD pointed out that ""appropriate regulations"" for this kind of game do not currently exist, which is something FIFA is expected to look at creating in the coming months.Now Italy and their top flight, Serie A, may become the first European league to take a game abroad, with AC Milan v Como set for Perth, Australia in February.The cancellation of La Liga's Miami match could spark a knock-on effect in Italy, with fan body Football Supporters Europe already calling for Serie A to scrap their plans too.","La Liga have been trying to move a match to the US since 2018, when they planned to take Girona v Barcelona to Miami.

Justin Herbert leads the charge for the Los Angeles Chargers

“I thought the offensive line did a great job. We had a great protection plan,”

Madison Beer, the ‘curse’ talk and the win break-through

“I’m glad she was there because if she wasn’t, the haters would want her to stay home forever.”

“curse”

On Thursday night, October 23, 2025, at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, Calif., Justin Herbert gave a commanding performance for the Los Angeles Chargers, throwing three touchdown passes and logging 227 yards through the air as his team routed the Minnesota Vikings 37-10. With the win, the Chargers improved to 5-3 and moved solidly into second place in the AFC West. The game also marked a turning point in the so-called “curse” narrative tied to pop singer Madison Beer, who has been spotted supporting Herbert in the stands.Herbert was amazing from his first drive, throwing three touchdowns and finishing 18 of 25 passes for 227 yards. Adding 62 rushing yards to his stat line showed he could overcome the Vikings with his legs as well as his arm.Early on, the Chargers shot to a 14-0 lead and never looked back. Herbert found rookie wide receiver Ladd McConkey for an incredible 27-yard touchdown pass after connecting with rookie tight end Oronde Gadsden II on an 8-yard touchdown.Five sacks of Vikings quarterback Carson Wentz and holding Minnesota to only 164 total yards on the defensive side.

Social-media fans quickly flipped the script: one wrote,Others joked that the onlyMadison faced was being attached to a franchise with its share of misfortune. Beer's obvious support gave the primetime battle a human, lighthearted touch and assisted in shifting the attention back to Herbert's performance rather than superstition as the Chargers pulled ahead.Having gotten a well-timed rebound, the Chargers next concentrate on a Week 9 road game versus the Tennessee Titans. Under Herbert's direction and Beer in the stands, the story about the team might be altered, actually, this time.","The Los Angeles Chargers beat the Minnesota Vikings 37-10 on Thursday night.

Miami Heat drop 86 first-half points in Memphis setting franchise record

Bam Adebayo sets the tone with dominant first-quarter showing for Miami Heat

Miami Heat fans were treated to something special in Memphis as Bam Adebayo led a near-perfect first half. Simone Fontecchio’s sharpshooting off the bench added a jolt that the Grizzlies couldn’t handle, while the supporting players orchestrated seamless ball movement.It wasn’t just the points, it was the pace, the confidence, and the efficiency that stood out. For anyone watching, the message was clear: this Miami Heat squad isn’t just capable of wins, they can absolutely run teams off the floor when they’re clicking, and the league is on notice.Miami wasted no time in showing who’s boss. In the first quarter, the Heat lit up the scoreboard with 44 points, thanks to center Bam Adebayo, who tied his career high by hitting four three-pointers and scoring 18 points overall.Adebayo's impressive performance included a couple of catch-and-shoot threes off screens from Andrew Wiggins and a pull-up jumper from the elbow, capitalizing on mismatches against Jaren Jackson Jr. By the end of the quarter, Miami was leading 44-25, while the Grizzlies struggled with 8 turnovers and shot just 28.6%.The second quarter was merciless, as Miami piled on 42 points to achieve a remarkable halftime score of 86-47.Recently signed wing Simone Fontecchio fueled the momentum, scoring 14 points in just six minutes off the bench. His impressive run included three back-to-back threes, one being a corner shot from a handoff by Jaime Jaquez Jr.Fontecchio's impressive shooting opened things up, letting Adebayo and Jimmy Butler (in a theoretical lineup change. Miami Heat recorded a 57.7% shooting percentage from the field and 62.5% from three-point range in the half, based on the halftime stats aired on Bally Sports Sun.Sports radio host Will Manso shared a tweet from the arena capturing the moment, ""The Miami Heat with 86 points in the first half in Memphis. That’s a new franchise record for most points in any half. That’s in Heat history!! Unbelievable 24 minutes. Miami up 86-47 at the half."".The efficiency of the half was impressive: 32 out of 55 from the field, 10 out of 16 from three-point range, and 12 assists on 32 baskets made. By halftime, five players from the Heat hit double digits—Adebayo (18), Fontecchio (14), Jaquez Jr. (12), Wiggins (11), and Powell (10)—highlighting the depth that Spoelstra desires. The ball movement was sharp, resulting in 18 assists in total for the half, which opened up easy paths for drives and kick-outs.Bam Adebayo really took charge in the first quarter, setting the vibe for the game. The three-time All-Star, who averaged 19.3 points last season, seemed re-energized, mixing his typical inside game with a threat from the outside.Simone Fontecchio's explosive performance in the second quarter changed the game. The 6'7"" forward, who joined the team on a three-year contract in July 2025, excelled in Miami's dynamic offense. He scored 14 points on 5-of-6 shooting, hitting all 4 of his three-point attempts, which prompted the Grizzlies to make adjustments that opened up lanes for cutters.The supporting players really stood out as well. Jaime Jaquez Jr. handed out four assists in the half, and Norman Powell's movement without the ball created some easy scores. With Herro not making plays, the Heat relied on a fast-paced transition game (18 fast-break points) and teamwork, keeping Memphis to just 47 points on 18-of-45 shooting.The Miami Heat scoring 86 points in the first half against Memphis was not only impressive but also a bit terrifying for the rest of the league. Bam Adebayo seems to have transformed his game, effectively stretching the floor while also being a force inside, and Simone Fontecchio’s rapid adjustment indicates that Miami’s front office really got the fit right.Also Read: Shaquille O’Neal’s $180,000 custom Range Rover disappears in Georgia amid alleged shipping hack",Miami Heat scored 86 first-half points in Memphis setting franchise record for most points in any half.

Kevin Garnett shares his thoughts on Cooper Flagg’s debut performance

Joel Embiid started slow in the 2025-2026 NBA season. Hall of Famer Kevin Garnett criticized his slow momentum and offseason routine. The Philadelphia 76ers secured a close win over the Boston Celtics, with all thanks going to Tyrese Maxey and rookie player V.J. Edgecombe. Embiid could only rack up and add 4 points to the team’s total score. Garnett got critical about Embiid’s performance. He questioned Embiid’s off-season routine. Garnett believed that the 76ers' centre player might not have made the best use of the off-season time during the summer, which is affecting his game now.Kevin Garnett is known for his unapologetically unfiltered opinions and he did the same with Joel Embiid’s slow start to the season. As the NBA Hall of Famer analyzed the Philadelphia 76ers' performance on opening night against the Boston Celtics, Kevin expressed his disappointment with Embiid’s performance. Paul Pierce stepped in to defend the 76ers center player, but got countered by Garnett. Garnett stated, “What’d you do in the summer? Bro, they had enough time to recover and develop. ” he further continued, “If you get April to September that should be enough time… he supposed to be ready for season.”Garnett was not at all ready to hear any defence for Embiid’s disappointing performance. Pierce did try to give the player the benefit of the doubt. He believed that Embiid being away from the court for a long period of time due to a knee surgery might just be the reason affecting his game. But, Garnett was in no mood to listen to the excuse. He was of the opinion that the summer was enough for the player to recover and develop his game.In one of the segments, Kevin Garnett was asked about his thoughts on Cooper Flagg’s debut. The NBA Hall of Famer does not like the young talent at point guard. He believed that Copper would perform better as a small forward. His initial reaction to the player’s debut performance was nothing but praise. Garnett stated, “Cooper is cool, man… first off when you play better talent, it's another level. I thought he had his own. It’s a lot of expectations in the first game. I thought he kept his cool.”He further continued, “I don’t like him at point guard. I do not like this small forward playing point guard.” According to Garnett, the point guard position is a difficult one to play with all the decision-making and having to please all the scorers and the guys. Instead, the NBA Hall of Famer wants to see the rookie player hitting the wings, being a slasher and using all his athleticism in scoring points for the team.Also Read: NBA Commissioner Adam Silver breaks silence after Chauncey Billups and Terry Rozier arrested in NBA gambling probe","Philadelphia 76ers secured a close win over the Boston Celtics, with all thanks going to Tyrese Maxey and rookie player V.J.

What Fans Saw and What’s Next

Theface off on October 24, 2025, in their first regular-season meeting, but it wasn’t just the on-court action that caught fans’ attention. The pregame injury report played a major role in shaping expectations and ultimately influenced the balance of power at the Moda Center.Golden State Warriors enter the matchup on a strong note with a 2-0 record, but their roster isn’t completely healthy. Several rotation players are sidelined due to ongoing injuries. De’Anthony Melton (knee), Moses Moody (calf), and Alex Toohey (knee) all miss the contest, continuing their absences from the previous game against the Denver Nuggets. Veteran big man Al Horford is also listed as questionable for rest management, though he is expected to see limited minutes if cleared to play.Despite these setbacks, the Golden State Warriors ’ main core remain intact. Stephen Curry, Jimmy Butler, Draymond Green, and Jonathan Kuminga are all active, giving Golden State the leadership, defense, and offensive firepower they needed to stay competitive. Curry enters the matchup averaging 24 points through two games, while Butler looks to be in peak form following a 31-point showing in Denver.Their chemistry and experience ensur that the team’s rhythm stay intact even without key reserves.Portland Trail Blazers, on the other hand, deal with an even more challenging situation. The team continues to miss three of its most important players: Robert Williams III (knee), Scoot Henderson (concussion protocol), and Damian Lillard (Achilles recovery). All are ruled out ahead of the contest, forcing the Portland Trail Blazers to rely on their young supporting cast.Adding to the uncertainty, both Shaedon Sharpe (knee soreness) and Deni Avdija (thumb) are game-time decisions. Sharpe is set to takes the floor but is expected to play limited minutes, while Avdija’s availability remains restricted.While Portland’s defense showed flashes of promise with its size and switchability, the offensive rhythm suffered without Lillard or Henderson orchestrating the attack. The lack of consistent shot creation put extra pressure on Grant and Ayton to deliver against Golden State’s disciplined defense.The contrast between the two lineups is striking. Golden State arrive with veteran depth and offensive chemistry, while Portland enter shorthanded and searching for answers. The Curry-Butler partnership is ecpected to continue to anchor the Golden State Warriors’ scoring attack, providing both explosiveness and stability. The Portland Trail Blazers, meanwhile, rely heavily on energy, transition play, and defensive intensity to stay competitive.Historically, this matchup has favored the Warriors. Coming into the night, Golden State had won six straight against Portland, including all encounters in the previous season. Given the injury circumstances, the Golden State Warriors were heavily favored to extend their dominance, while the Blazers approached the game as a valuable learning experience for their younger players.Even with the imbalance in roster health, the game carries plenty of intrigue. Fans are eager to see how Jimmy Butler’s presence can continue to shape Golden State’s evolving identity early in the 2025–26 campaign. On the other side, Portland fans hope to see signs of progress from emerging talents.Ultimately, the October 24 meeting reflect two teams at very different stages of their journey. The Warriors, well-rounded and experienced under Steve Kerr’s system, will showcase their readiness to contend for another deep postseason run. The Portland Trail Blazers, hampered by injuries and transition, continue their process of development and rebuilding.Also read: Is Luka Doncic playing tonight vs Minnesota Timberwolves?

Revenge Game Against Minnesota

What to Expect Tonight

Thereceived a major boost ahead of their matchup with the Minnesota Timberwolves, as star guardhas been cleared and is available to play despite a recent groin concern. Doncic tweaked his right groin late in the Lakers’ season opener on October 22, 2025, against the Golden State Warriors. He was seen grabbing at the area several times during the closing minutes, sparking immediate concern among fans and analysts. However, the All-Star quickly reassured everyone after the game, calling the issue “probably nothing” and explaining that it stemmed from a sudden hip movement rather than a serious strain.Despite the discomfort, Luka Doncic’s performance in that opener was nothing short of extraordinary. He recorded 43 points, 12 rebounds, and nine assists, showcasing his dominance and ability to power through physical setbacks. His combination of scoring efficiency and playmaking control solidified why he’s viewed as the Los Angeles Lakers’ centerpiece for the 2025-26 season.Head coach JJ Redick confirmed that Luka Doncic fully participated in Thursday’s practice ahead of the game against Minnesota, noting that the superstar showed no signs of limitation or lingering soreness.Redick expressed full confidence in Doncic’s readiness and emphasized that the team’s medical staff had cleared him without restriction. Guard Austin Reaves, who sustained a minor ankle tweak during practice, was listed as a modified participant but is also expected to play. Meanwhile, the Los Angeles Lakers will be without LeBron James, who remains sidelined with sciatica; Maxi Kleber, who’s dealing with an oblique strain; and Adou Thiero, out due to a knee injury. Luka Doncic’s minor groin issue appears to be under control, with the player himself brushing it off as a temporary discomfort. His participation in a full practice session on Thursday reinforced confidence within the Lakers’ locker room that their star guard is in top form. JJ Redick’s statement that Doncic was unrestricted in practice removes any doubts about his game-night availability.LeBron James’ absence due to sciatica adds significant pressure on Doncic to lead the Lakers offensively and as a team leader. James is expected to be re-evaluated toward the end of October, leaving Doncic to shoulder much of the responsibility during a challenging early stretch of the season. With the Los Angeles Lakers missing multiple rotation players, the offense will likely flow heavily through Doncic, whose scoring and playmaking will be pivotal in keeping the team competitive.Tonight’s matchup carries added motivation for Doncic and the Lakers , as the Timberwolves were responsible for eliminating Los Angeles in the first round of the 2024-25 playoffs. Luka Doncic, who averaged over 30 points per game during that series, is eager to deliver a statement performance and avenge that playoff defeat. Facing a familiar opponent early in the season gives him the perfect stage to reassert himself as one of the league’s premier stars and solidify his standing as the Lakers’ new franchise cornerstone.With LeBron James unavailable and key contributors sidelined, all eyes will be on Luka Doncic to deliver another all-around masterclass. His performance against Minnesota will serve as a test of both his leadership and endurance as the Los Angeles Lakers aim to notch their first win of the season. Fans can expect a healthy, focused, and highly motivated Doncic, eager to build upon his brilliant season debut and lead the Lakers to redemption against a team that ended their playoff hopes just months ago.Also read: Los Angeles Lakers vs Minnesota Timberwolves injury report: Who's playing, who's out, and more (October 24, 2025) In short, the stage is set for Luka Doncic to shine once again.

Ex-NBA referee Tim Donaghy thinks there could be a 'bigger scandal' at hand

More on NBA's latest betting scandal

The NBA is under a lot of duress currently. Previously, it was the salary cap controversy surrounding the Los Angeles Clippers and their star player Kawhi Leonard. And now, the FBI has arrested multiple people from the league, active players included, in an ongoing betting scandal that has the whole league in turmoil. From Miami Heat star Terry Rozier to ex Portland Trailblazers head coach Chauncey Billups, quite a few names have been linked to the scandal, and ex referee Tim Donaghy says there could be more to this story that's yet to come.Tim Donaghy worked as a referee for the NBA until he was arrested on charges of fraud and match fixing in 2007. He was caught in a gambling scandal and pleaded guilty, after resigning from the league. Now, almost two decades since that, another gambling and betting scandal has reared its head to take a swipe at the league, and Donaghy thinks there is more to come on that front.“I think this is just the tip of the iceberg... You’re going to see maybe a more of a bigger scandal coming out of the college level, because you have these young athletes that aren’t going to make it to the next level, and somebody is going to offer them money to maybe fix a game and only win by 12 rather than 15 and they’re gonna take that money because they’re gonna need a way to support their families.”His statement came during his appearance on NewsNation’s “Cuomo” with Chris Cuomo. With such a large-scale investigation already happening, fans are assuming there's more that is yet to be revealed to the public. Given it's been going on for multiple years, and multiple arrests have already been made, we will hopefully get to learn more soon.The FBI recently arrested more than 30 people in an illegal gambling crackdown, including current player Terry Rozier, current coach Chauncey Billups, and former player Damon Jones. Billups has been sacked from his position as the head coach of the Portland Trailblazers since the news went public. As for Rozier, no official statements were made by his team - the Miami Heat, or his agent.An NBA released a statement after Rozier was named in the investigation, saying they ""have been cooperating with that investigation."" With so many people under scrutiny, both inside and outside of the league, especially with the involvement of mob families, it is turning into a bigger mess than anyone had believed.Also Read: Who is Scott Foster?

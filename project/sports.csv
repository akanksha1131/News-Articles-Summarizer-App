"'Out’ with the old: Wimbledon embraces Electronic Line Calling, retires line judges after 148 years",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/out-with-the-old-wimbledon-embraces-electronic-line-calling-retires-line-judges-after-148-years/articleshow/122150668.cms,"The iconic Wimbledon line judges will be permanently replaced by Electronic Line Calling.

New Delhi:

At Wimbledon 1993, Chris Bailey knocked over the net cord umpire off her chair. That iconic moment in Wimbledon history cannot be repeated because the folks who would place their finger on the net to feel the slightest vibration were phased out in 1996. Their place was taken by an automatic system that produced a beep instead. Soon, all majors would follow suit.When play resumes on Monday, June 30, at the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club, a familiar sight will be no more - the line judges. For the first time in Wimbledon's 148-year history, line judges, with their hunched backs and dapper clothing, will be replaced by electronic line calling (ELC). The animated ""fault"" and ""out"" will be replaced by monotone of a machine that would call ""out"" even when it's edge-of-the-seat fifth set tiebreak.There would be no more instances of John McEnroe getting enraged by a line call; Jeff Tarango walking off the court; Nick Kyrgios labelling a line judge as ""snitch"" or Fabio Fognini dropping to his knees in dramatic manner when a decision didn't go his way.In the process, Wimbledon would join Australian and US Opens to adopt ELC. The French Open, where shots leave a mark on the clay, will remain the only Grand Slam to use line judges.Wimbledon's usual pool of 300 judges has been reduced to 80 “match assistants,” two of whom will be assigned to each of Wimbledon's courts. They will aid the chair umpires in managing what happens on the court and will be on standby should ELC go down.“I think they — and I wouldn’t speak for them individually — probably recognise that with the evolution of the technology and the consistent change across many of the other tournaments that this is probably inevitable,” said Sally Bolton, the All England Lawn Tennis Club (AELTC) CEO, at a media briefing.“So I think for many of them they had expected this change to come along and for those that will be joining us for the Championships in the match assistant role obviously they’re delighted still to be part of delivering the Championships,” she added.Complete removal of line judges was inevitable as ELC is mandatory at all ATP, the men's tour, and mixed-tour level events. Wimbledon has been using ball tracking and line technology for more than 15 years. The grass court major embraced Hawk-Eye technology in 2007, allowing players on certain courts to challenge line calls.Introduction of the Hawk-Eye system brought with it an element of drama for players and spectators alike. As players challenged line calls, it was met by excitement and eventually rhythmic clapping as it was shown on the big screen.With the introduction of ELC across courts, there will be no need or possibility to make a challenge. The players can, however, ask for a replay of the decision on the screens.Over 450 cameras have been installed at Wimbledon and at the qualifying tournament in nearby Roehampton.“The time is right for us to move on,” Bolton said. “We absolutely value the commitment that those line umpires have provided to the Championships over many years. And we do have a significant number of them coming back in a new role as match assistants, so we’re really pleased to have many of them still involved with delivering the championships,” she added.For a tournament that prides in its history and tradition, this technological leap has been one that has taken years of consideration. It was tested last year and proved to be a success. Does the magic of SW19 evaporate with the absence of line judges? Tournament director Jamie Baker disagrees.""I think that's a massive positive move for us in terms of the actual look and feel of the court and the recognisable Wimbledon brand, which is green grass courts, players wearing white tennis clothes -- it's instantly recognisable,"" he said in an interview to news agency AFP.""So the more emphasis that's on that, the better. But also, just if you get back to the very nature of the sport itself, it's gladiatorial, it's one-on-one, everything that happens on the stage should be focused around that.""","Wimbledon line judges will be permanently replaced by Electronic Line Calling.

Bayern Munich advanced to the Club World Cup quarterfinals with a 4-2 victory over Flamengo at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens on Sunday, powered by Harry Kane 's two goals. The German champions bounced back from their only tournament loss against Benfica last week to set up a quarterfinal clash with Paris Saint-Germain in Atlanta.Bayern Munich took control early when Flamengo's Erick Pulgar headed the ball into his own net from Joshua Kimmich's corner in the sixth minute. Kane extended the lead with a deflected strike three minutes later.Flamengo showed signs of life when Gerson beat Manuel Neuer in the 32nd minute to reduce the deficit, but Leon Goretzka restored Bayern's two-goal advantage shortly after.The Brazilian club continued to press, with Luiz Araújo forcing a spectacular save from Neuer in their best chance of the first half. Kane later scored his second goal on an assist from Kimmich, beating goalkeeper Agustín Rossi.Jorginho converted a penalty in the 54th minute to bring Flamengo within one goal at 3-2, but Kane sealed the victory with his third tournament goal in the 73rd minute.The match drew a near-capacity crowd at the 65,000-seat Hard Rock Stadium, with many spectators wearing Flamengo's black and red colors.The victory ensures at least four European clubs will advance to the quarterfinals and sets up a rematch of the 2020 Champions League final, which Bayern won 1-0 against PSG.""I know a lot of my game is judged on goals and I've been doing it throughout my career, but what maybe some of the German fans and some of the Bayern fans are realizing is that I'll do anything for the team to help us win,"" Kane said.""We had our opportunities, but unfortunately they were the superior team in this fixture. The corner kick at the beginning of the match sort of took down our confidence a little bit,"" Flamengo coach Filipe Luis said through an interpreter.The match against PSG comes after the French champions defeated Lionel Messi and Inter Miami 4-0 in an earlier Sunday match.",Bayern Munich advanced to the Club World Cup quarterfinals with a 4-2 victory over Flamengo.

Paris Saint-Germain dominated Inter Miami with a commanding 4-0 victory in the Club World Cup last-16 match on Sunday in Atlanta, with Joao Neves scoring twice and additional goals from Achraf Hakimi and a Tomas Aviles own goal. Despite the presence of soccer legend Lionel Messi and his former Barcelona teammates Luis Suarez, Sergio Busquets, and Jordi Alba, the Major League Soccer side couldn't match the European champions' superior performance.PSG established their dominance early in the match when Neves scored the opening goal after just six minutes, heading in a free-kick from Vitinha at the back post.The French champions maintained control throughout the first half, pressing high and limiting Messi's involvement in the game.The floodgates opened late in the first half when PSG scored three goals in a 10-minute span. Neves netted his second after Busquets lost possession near his own box, followed by an Aviles own goal from Doue's cross.Hakimi added the fourth goal before halftime, scoring on the rebound after his initial shot hit the crossbar.""We had to play a serious game, the competition is really starting and I think we played well,"" said PSG winger Ousmane Dembele upon his return from injury.The match drew 66,000 spectators to the air-conditioned Mercedes-Benz Stadium, with most fans wearing Miami's pink colors or Argentina shirts in support of Messi.Despite trailing by four goals, Messi showed determination in the second half, creating a chance for Suarez with a brilliant chip pass and testing PSG goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma with a low shot.The 38-year-old Messi displayed frustration during the match, particularly in an incident where he directed his anger at Vitinha.""I think we were above the expectations people had for us (at the tournament), we were the best team in our group, obviously we were facing the best team in the world playing football right now, so it was difficult,"" said Alba.Alba added: ""Despite that in the first half we competed and above all we did in the second, we had more control of the game, more chances, and created more problems for PSG.""PSG's victory sets up a quarter-final clash against either Bayern Munich or Flamengo, scheduled for Saturday in Atlanta.The match featured some notable moments, including Kvaratskhelia setting up Barcola early in the game, only to be denied by Miami goalkeeper Oscar Ustari.Dembele made his tournament debut as a substitute but showed signs of rust following his hamstring injury.Messi had one final opportunity to score from a free-kick after Suarez was fouled by Lucas Beraldo, but his attempt struck the wall.Despite the heavy defeat, Miami's second-half performance showed improvement, and the scoreline was less severe than PSG's recent 5-0 victory over Inter Milan in the Champions League final.The European champions demonstrated their class throughout the match, with their high-pressing tactics and possession-based game proving too much for Miami to handle.Luis Enrique's PSG side maintained their impressive form in the tournament, showcasing why they are considered among the favorites to win the Club World Cup.Miami's journey in the tournament came to an end, but they had performed well enough to advance from their group before meeting the superior PSG team in the knockout stage.","Paris Saint-Germain beat Inter Miami 4-0 in Club World Cup last-16 match.

Rishabh Pant Gears Up at Edgbaston| Ready for 2nd Test vs England?

A year on since their historic triumph in Barbados in the T20 World Cup final against South Africa, India’s wicketkeeper-batter Rishabh Pant has recalled a heartfelt message about how life gave him a second chance.""Not many know what it feels like to be chosen twice — once by life, once by death,"" read one of Pant's Instagram stories.In his first tournament back in India colours after being out for nearly 14 months due to his injury setback from a road accident, Pant had failed to light up the final with the bat, bagging a duck.But Pant was instrumental in orchestrating a stoppage in play by signalling to his injured knee when South Africa needed 26 runs in four overs with six wickets in hand.Reflecting on the incident, Pant had previously told Star Sports: “I was actually thinking what to do because the momentum had suddenly shifted (in South Africa’s favour), they had scored plenty of runs in 2-3 overs, so I was thinking when that moment would come when we would win the World Cup final.“I was asking the physio to take time. When Rohit bhai asked if my knee was fine, I said, ‘Bhaiya, bas acting kar raha tha‘ (I was acting all this while).Sometimes you have to do these types of things in matches. I’m not saying it works every time, but it does work sometimes, and if it works at that kind of moment, then nothing like it,” he added.Meanwhile, India's title-winning captain Rohit Sharma thought that Pant was in pain.""I genuinely thought that something had happened to him.

Australian vice-captain Steve Smith has defended national batting coach Michael Di Venuto against criticism from former Test wicketkeeper Ian Healy, who claimed Australia's batting performance had regressed under Di Venuto's tenure since 2021.Smith, speaking to reporters in Bridgetown on Sunday, rejected Healy's assessment while providing updates on his own finger injury recovery and potential return for the second Test against West Indies in St Georges.Smith dismissed Healy's suggestion that Di Venuto should be under pressure for the team's recent batting performances.""(Di Venuto's) not the one out there actually doing the batting. Guys have to be able to figure it out themselves out in the middle sometimes. You can't have someone holding your hand out there,"" Smith said.Smith further defended Di Venuto's capabilities and contribution to the team. ""He works as hard as anyone. He knows batting inside out. He's seen cricket all around the world, and knows all the conditions. He's done a wonderful job for a long time now, and the boys really enjoyed working with him,"" Smith stated.The criticism from Healy came after Australia's top order struggled in the first Test against West Indies, with Cameron Green scoring 3 and 15, and Josh Inglis making 5 and 12.""Australian cricket's batting head coach and every state batting coach, should be under pressure because there's not enough runs being scored around the nation either,"" Healy told SEN.Quiz: Who's that IPL player? ""Michael Di Venuto, a friend of mine who is a good coach and a good man has held the job since mid-2021. In this time, our national team batting has regressed in performance at the Test level,"" Healy added.Statistics show a decline in the Test batting average of Australia's top three from 45.94 in 2022 to 27.04 in 2025. Smith missed the first Test due to a compound dislocation in his finger during the World Test Championship final against South Africa at Lord's.""I looked straight down and I was like, 'That doesn't look right. That looks pretty disgusting.' I wasn't sure of the extent of the damage,"" Smith recalled about his injury. During his recovery in New York, Smith maintained his practice in a unique way.""My mate actually told me about it. Underneath this bridge, there was a batting cage, and he was able to throw me a few balls there. It was nice to hit a few balls,"" Smith said.Smith expects to return for the second Test, though with modified fielding positions due to his injury. ""I don't feel any pain or anything. It's all feeling good, just getting used to the splint on and the slight, limited movement,"" Smith said.""It'll be just training as normal, and then probably fielding some balls in front of the wicket, which would probably be the strangest thing for me. I don't think I've ever done that in a Test match,"" he added.Smith also expressed support for struggling teammates Green and Sam Konstas. ""These guys are good players. We've got to give them an opportunity, it doesn't come around straight away. I think back to the start of my career, I think it took me 11 innings to score a hundred.

A fluent century from Sean Williams stood tall amid a faltering Zimbabwe batting effort, but South Africa maintained firm control at the end of Day 2 of the first Test at Queens Sports Club.Williams played a lone hand with an aggressive 137 off 163 deliveries—his seventh Test hundred—contributing more than half of Zimbabwe's total of 251. However, South Africa held a commanding first-innings lead of 167 runs, which they stretched to 216 by stumps, closing at 49/1 in their second innings.Zimbabwe’s troubles began early in the day as South Africa declared overnight at 418/9. Debutant Codi Yusuf struck twice in his opening spell to jolt the top order. Their woes deepened when in-form opener Brian Bennett, fresh from a century against England, was struck on the helmet by a short ball from Kwena Maphaka. He was forced to retire hurt on 19 and later ruled out with mild concussion.Captain Craig Ervine and Williams added 81 for the fourth wicket, the only substantial stand of the innings. Ervine’s dismissal—stumped off Keshav Maharaj for 36—handed the left-arm spinner his 200th Test wicket. Maharaj, captaining in place of the injured Temba Bavuma, ended with figures of 3/70.All-rounder Wiaan Mulder impressed with the ball, taking 4/50, while Yusuf returned 3/42 on debut.South Africa lost Matthew Breetzke early in their second innings to Tanaka Chivanga, who struck in his first over for the second time in the match.

In a shocking and heartbreaking incident, a local cricketer collapsed and died on the field moments after hitting a six during a match in Firozpur. The batter, identified as Harjeet Singh, suffered a fatal heart attack and passed away despite immediate efforts to revive him.A chilling video of the incident has surfaced online. It shows Harjeet striking the ball cleanly for a six and casually walking towards the middle of the pitch. Moments later, he suddenly goes down on his knees, visibly in pain.As he lost consciousness, teammates and players from both sides rushed to his aid. Several of them attempted CPR on the field, but it was too late. Harjeet was declared dead at the spot, reportedly due to cardiac arrest.The tragic visuals have left the cricketing community and social media in deep shock, raising concerns once again about the growing number of sudden cardiac incidents among seemingly healthy athletes.This is not an isolated case. In 2024, a similar tragedy occurred at the Garware Stadium in Pune when 35-year-old Imran Patel collapsed after complaining of chest pain during a cricket match. Despite being in good physical shape and actively playing as an all-rounder, Patel suffered a fatal heart attack while returning to the pavilion after voluntarily retiring due to discomfort.","A local cricketer collapsed and died on the field moments after hitting a six during a match in Firozpur.

Poll What is your opinion on Shubman Gill's captaincy after the recent Test match? He needs more experience He should be replaced as captain

India’s dramatic collapse on Day 5 of the first Test in Leeds has sparked serious debate around Shubman Gill ’s captaincy, with former England cricketers David Lloyd and Alastair Cook offering contrasting views. Despite dominating large parts of the match, India succumbed to a five-wicket loss against England, handing the hosts a 1-0 lead in the Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy series.Gill’s leadership, in his first major Test assignment as captain, came under scrutiny after India’s tactical errors and sloppy fielding proved costly on the final day. David Lloyd, speaking on Sky Sports’ ""Stick to Cricket podcast"", was critical of Gill’s approach.""The intrigue is with Shubman Gill, who’s a very inexperienced skipper. How’s he going to come back from that? He’s got Ravindra Jadeja and Karun Nair, who are in their 30s. So he’s got experience in his team. It’s great having a young team that he’s got. But tactically, he’s reactive rather than proactive in the stuff that he’s doing,"" Lloyd said.However, former England captain Alastair Cook urged patience, drawing parallels to Ben Stokes' early days as skipper.“When you take over a team, there will always be a phase when the team gets used to the new leader. This happened with (Ben) Stokes when he came in. It took a while (for England players) to get used to him when he came in and said, ‘We’re going to try and smash every ball,"" Cook replied.India’s defeat was particularly surprising given five centuries across both innings — from Rishabh Pant (twice), KL Rahul, Yashasvi Jaiswal, and Gill himself. Still, collapses from 430/3 to 471 and 333/4 to 364, along with dropped catches, allowed England to chase down 371 under clouds with relative ease.","India's dramatic collapse on Day 5 of the first Test in Leeds has sparked serious debate around Shubman Gill’s captaincy.

India’s star opener Smriti Mandhana has termed her maiden T20I century a “special” moment, admitting the format doesn’t come naturally to her, but vowing to keep working on her power-hitting game.Standing in as captain for the injured Harmanpreet Kaur , Mandhana led from the front with a sublime 112 in the opening T20I against England at Trent Bridge. Her century, which helped India to a 97-run win, marked her first in the format, having already achieved the milestone in both Tests and ODIs.""It's a nice feeling because this format is something where, as a batter, I need to keep pushing and improving,"" Mandhana said after the game.

MLC 2025: Unmukt Chand’s road to redemption in America

BIRMINGHAM: The International Cricket Council (ICC) is preparing to take decisive action against USA Cricket (USAC) as the end of its 12-month governance notice period approaches next month. Sources familiar with the matter say the ICC is considering suspending the national governing body unless significant leadership changes occur before the ICC’s Annual Conference in July.USAC was formally placed under notice in July 2024, when the ICC established a normalisation committee to oversee compliance and reforms. At the time, the ICC cited the board’s lack of a “fit for purpose” governance and administrative structure. Since then, little progress has been made, according to individuals with knowledge of recent discussions.An ICC delegation visited Los Angeles earlier this month for meetings with the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee (USOPC). Those discussions, which included members of the normalisation committee and senior USAC representatives, are understood to have reinforced concerns about ongoing dysfunction and internal disputes within USAC.One official with direct involvement described the situation as “unsustainable,” noting that despite repeated warnings and external oversight, “very little has changed.”“The ICC’s position is clear: effective governance is non-negotiable, especially ahead of cricket’s return to the Olympics at LA 2028,” the official said.During the visit, ICC representatives reportedly urged members of the current board, led by Chair Venu Pisike, to step down voluntarily. While some directors are said to be open to resigning, others remain resistant. A board member told TimesofIndia.com that no formal decisions have been made and that the group is awaiting documentation from the ICC before determining next steps.ICC officials pushed back on that characterisation, stating the Los Angeles discussions were informal and not subject to official minutes. “This is not a bureaucratic technicality,” said one person close to the talks. “This is about whether the US cricket community is governed competently and transparently.”A small number of directors remain defiant, according to sources. However, several resignations are expected in the coming weeks in an effort to preempt formal sanctions. Suspension by the ICC would effectively isolate USAC from global cricket structures, impacting its ability to receive funding, host international matches, or participate in development programs.The ICC has not made a public statement on the matter, but with the July deadline approaching, a resolution—voluntary or otherwise—appears imminent.","The International Cricket Council (ICC) is preparing to take decisive action against USA Cricket. Sources say the ICC is considering suspending the national governing body unless significant leadership changes occur before the ICC’s Annual Conference in July. Suspension by the ICC would effectively isolate USAC from global cricket structures, impacting its ability to receive funding, host international matches, or participate in development programs.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122144964,imgsize-19466,width-400,resizemode-4/122144964.jpg"

Poll Is Lhuan-dre Pretorius the next big star in South African cricket? Definitely Not really

Lhuan-dre Pretorius made history on Saturday as he became the youngest South African to score a Test century, reaching the milestone at just 19 years and 93 days, surpassing Graeme Pollock’s long-standing record from 1964.But his stunning debut knock of 153 against Zimbabwe in Bulawayo wasn’t without drama. With South Africa struggling at 24/3 and under serious pressure, Pretorius walked in and was soon at the centre of a key moment. Zimbabwe’s fielders went up in a loud appeal for a caught-behind. The umpire ruled him not out, and with no Snickometer technology available, the decision stood.Commentators noted,There’s no Snicko, so if there is contact, Pretorius has survivedOne Zimbabwe player even walked up to Pretorius, suggesting he should have walked, adding fuel to the moment. Several Zimbabwe players were also heard telling the batter to 'walk back' after the incident.Instead of letting the pressure affect him, Pretorius stayed calm. He built a match-turning 95-run partnership with Dewald Brevis, who smashed a 41-ball fifty of his own. The pair led South Africa’s recovery after a shaky start.Pretorius went on to score 153, an innings full of maturity, footwork, and clean stroke play. He struck 11 fours and 4 sixes, anchoring the Proteas innings and putting his name in the record books.From a tense appeal to a historic century, Pretorius’ debut had it all. Without 'Snicko' to settle the debate, all that remains is the scoreboard—and a place in South African cricket history.",Lhuan-dre Pretorius becomes youngest South African to score a Test century.

Former South Africa captain AB de Villiers has raised eyebrows over India's decision to reportedly restrict Jasprit Bumrah to just three Tests in the ongoing five-match series against England. Calling Test cricket the “ultimate form of the game,” de Villiers expressed surprise and suggested India might be mismanaging their premier fast bowler.Speaking on his YouTube channel, the 41-year-old Proteas legend made a strong case for Bumrah's full availability, comparing the situation to how South Africa handled the workload of Dale Steyn ""He is probably the top bowler in the world in all formats right now,"" de Villiers said. ""In my opinion, this Test series would've been the one to get him ready for all five matches. That's what we did with Dale - rest him in less important T20 and ODI series and have him fully ready for the big Test tours - Australia, England, India.""He questioned whether the decision was influenced by medical advice. ""Maybe the surgeon told him he can't play all five. If that's the case, you've got to respect it. But if it's about workload, then I'm not sure they've gone about it the right way,"" he added.De Villiers stressed that unless Bumrah is nursing a serious injury, he must feature in the remaining matches. ""It doesn't get bigger than a five-Test series against England - other than maybe the WTC final.If he's fit, he must play. If not, I understand the caution.""In a cheeky aside, ABD suggested that India might be bluffing to surprise England. ""Maybe it's part of the plan - say he'll miss some games and then play all five. Hopefully, that's the surprise with India 0-1 down.""He also backed India's bench strength: ""It's a big opportunity for someone like Arshdeep Singh or maybe Kuldeep Yadav to step up.""",Jasprit Bumrah has been restricted to just three Tests by India.

Dorking Wanderers manager Marc White has been handed a six-game touchline suspension by the Football Association (FA) following comments he made, according to a post made on the club's official X handle. The FA took action against White for remarks deemed inappropriate, which the club later clarified were meant to be humorous.The National League side issued a statement on social media acknowledging the ban. “Following (intended fun) comments made on a podcast regarding women drivers, First Team Manager Marc White has received a six-game touchline suspension to be served from the beginning of the league season,” the club posted on X.In the clip, which was circulated online, White made a remark referencing women referees and drivers. He said, ""Fantastic record last year. I think 12-stadium ban it was in total, which beat my previous best. Yeah. Beat my previous best.""“This year, I’ve gone easy, mate.

But, yeah, I’m getting a bit better,"" said the coach as he burst out laughing.White, who is also the founder of Dorking Wanderers, has played a pivotal role in the club’s rise through the English football pyramid.

Has attendance really been that low at the Club World Cup?

Extreme heat

Poll Are you excited about the upcoming 2026 FIFA World Cup? Absolutely! Not really Only if the issues are resolved

As the final eight of the 2025 Club World Cup takes shape with teams like Chelsea and Palmeiras booking their spots, the tournament has become the target of criticism from several top figures in the sport. While thrilling matchups such as Paris Saint-Germain vs Inter Miami and Real Madrid vs Juventus keep fans on edge, the build-up to the 2026 FIFA World Cup has exposed serious issues in the revamped 32-team Club World Cup.From matches being disrupted because of extreme heat to pitch concerns and an expanded format, players and coaches alike have raised concerns. Despite solid turnouts at some fixtures, the overall experience, both on and off the pitch, has left many questioning the planning behind the tournament.Chelsea may have comfortably defeated Benfica 4-1, but manager Enzo Maresca was far from being satisfied. The Italian coach vented his frustration after the match was delayed by nearly two hours due to lightning in Charlotte, North Carolina, stretching the game to five hours.“This is not the right place to do this competition,” Maresca said, noting it was already the sixth weather-related delay of the tournament.“If they are already suspending six, seven, eight games, probably there is something that is not working well.”Poor pitch quality has been another talking point of the competition. PSG boss Luis Enrique didn’t hold back, comparing the playing surface to a pothole-riddled basketball court after his side’s 2-0 win over Seattle Sounders.“I wouldn't imagine an NBA court full of holes,” said Enrique. “The ball bounces almost like if it were jumping around like a rabbit.”Real Madrid midfielder Jude Bellingham also mirrored his concerns after his side’s 3-1 win over Pachuca. “The pitches aren’t great at all. It holds up the ball, the ball barely bounces,” said the England star. “It’s tough on the knees as well. Hopefully there's someone who will look at that going into the World Cup next year,” the player told Sky Sports.Former Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp called out the tournament's expanded format, pointing to a packed football calendar and player fatigue.""It's all about the game and not the surrounding events – and that's why the Club World Cup is the worst idea ever implemented in football in this regard,"" Klopp told Welt am Sonntag. “There is insane money for participating, but it’s also not for every club... That means no real recovery for the players involved, neither physically nor mentally.”Despite reports of low crowd numbers at certain matches, some fixtures have seen heavy attendance. Eighteen group-stage games drew over 40,000 fans, and a record 80,619 showed up to watch PSG thrash Atletico Madrid 4-0 at the Rose Bowl, making it the highest attended game in Club World Cup history.However, weekday games saw poor turnout, with the worst being Ulsan HD vs Mamelodi Sundowns in Orlando, where only 3,412 fans attended a match delayed by storms. This wasn't the lowest in tournament history, but it reflected poor turnout in less-hyped fixtures. That being said, the opening match between Al Ahly and Inter Miami drew 60,927 fans to Hard Rock Stadium.Sweltering conditions have plagued several games, with temperatures soaring to 36°C during Bayern Munich vs Benfica in Charlotte. Chelsea coach Maresca described trying to train in Philadelphia’s “code red” heat warning zone as “impossible.”Games have featured mandatory cooling breaks, with players using ice towels and dousing themselves in water to survive the conditions. The threat of thunderstorms also looms large, with five games facing lengthy delays due to lightning within a 10-mile radius of stadiums.Even Bundesliga giants Borussia Dortmund resorted to keeping their substitutes in the dressing room during matches. Their coach Niko Kovac described the dugout atmosphere as of that to a “sauna”.As the Club World Cup moves closer to its conclusion, the football on display has had its moments, but the criticism surrounding schedule, climate, and player welfare are casting long shadows over FIFA’s revamped project.","The 2025 Club World Cup has become the target of criticism from several top figures in the sport.

Auckland City hold their ground in a historic result

Messi and Miami power through to the Round of 16

A 'heated' Club World Cup

Concerns for the upcoming World Cup?

'New' tournament, same old favourites

List of qualified teams for Round of 16

As the 21st edition of the FIFA Club World Cup moves towards the Round of 16, the competition's facelift has provided multiple storylines. From the number of teams participating to a newly designed trophy, more venues and even a referee cam, the competition in the United States has gone closer to its namesake - the quadrennial World Cup.The organisers have called it ""a celebration of hope, excellence and pride, embodying the journey of every club, player and fan united in their passion for the beautiful game."" With several new debutants and the tournament now being a month-long event, the competition has changed in stature.Now, teams from all six confederations - 12 teams from Europe, 6 from South America, 4 from Africa, 4 from Asia, 4 from North, Central America and Caribbean, 1 from Oceania, and 1 team from the host nation complete the 2025 line-up.With the group stage done and dusted and just 16 teams left in the running, it is fair to say that this edition of the Club World Cup has had its fair share of upsets, David vs Goliath matchups and some heated moments, literally and figuratively.Ranked 4,971st in the Opta Power Rankings, Auckland City went in as the lowest ranked side in the Club World Cup. They were grouped alongside Bayern Munich, Benfica and Boca Juniors.To put things into context, Auckland City are made up of amateurs, play in the Northern League in New Zealand, comprising just 12 teams.Auckland suffered a brutal 0-10 loss against Bayern Munich to start with - the biggest defeat in this year's tournament - which was followed by a 0-6 thumping from Benfica.Already eliminated and with nothing to lose, Auckland faced Argentinian giants Boca Juniors in their last game. In what can only be described as a David-Goliath matchup, the underdogs denied Boca a spot in the Round of 16, who were in need of a win to progress. A difference of 4,819 ranking points and Boca's historical success made the 1-1 draw all the more sweet for the amateurs.Grouped alongside giants Porto, Al Ahly and Palmeiras, Lionel Messi's Inter Miami were expected to be swept aside. Instead, the Argentine No 10, supported by Luis Suarez, Jordi Alba and Sergio Busquets, powered through to the Round of 16, after finishing second in Group A.While the Herons could only pick up one win, it was enough to qualify. After a stalemate against Al Ahly in the tournament opener, Miami were up against Portuguese giants Porto. In what seemed like a difficult task for Miami, Messi's timeless brilliance, exemplified by a stunning free kick, earned them a 2-1 win. Miami drew their final game 2-2 against Brazil's Palmeiras, and confirmed their berth in the last 16.Tensions boiled over on the final matchday in Group E, where River Plate needed a win to make it to the last 16. Inter, however, denied them that pleasure. At the full-time whistle, River's Marcos Acuna and Inter's Denzel Dumfries nearly came to blows, needing an entire team and support staff to intervene. The feud, which first began three years ago, saw Argentina's Acuna show Netherlands' Dumfries the 2022 World Cup trophy logo on his shin guard. At the tournament, Argentina had beaten Netherlands in a heated quarter-final which finished on penalties.Heated moments weren't restricted to the players, as heatwaves and extreme temperatures saw teams give their players ice baths and cold towels. Borussia Dortmund went a step further, making their substitutes watch the game against Mamelodi Sundowns from the locker room and not from the bench to protect them from the blistering heat. Their coach likened the playing conditions to that of a 'sauna'. Thunderstorms and lightning also resulted in at least five games being delayed.But it isn't just ice packs, but ICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement) who have been a presence at the tournament, making it the first to do so. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) will also be a part of the tournament's setup, with non-citizens needing proof of legal status to attend games.With less than a year to go for the 2026 FIFA World Cup , set to be co-hosted by the United States, Mexico and Canada, its precursor has revealed several issues. From pitch quality, to heat and weather in general, the tournament hasn't been a smooth one to say the least.Real Madrid star Jude Bellingham called out the poor pitch conditions, saying ""The pitches aren’t great here. The pitches aren’t great at all,"" said the 21-year-old after his side's match against Pachuca at the Bank of America Stadium in Charlotte.Besides the underdog stories, major upsets and more teams, the tournament still remains a hunting ground for Europe's best. Giants like Real Madrid and Manchester City still remain favourites to win the prize. Five teams from the eight groups - Seattle Sounders, Urawa Reds, Ulsan, Wydad AC and Pachuca - were eliminated without a single point.Group A: Palmeiras, Inter MiamiGroup B: Paris Saint-Germain, BotafogoGroup C: Bayern Munich, BenficaGroup D: Flamengo, ChelseaGroup E: Inter Milan, MonterreyGroup F: Borussia Dortmund, FluminenseGroup G: Manchester City, JuventusGroup H: Real Madrid, Al Hilal",The 21st edition of the FIFA Club World Cup has come to an end.

David Beckham (Instagram Screengab)

David Beckham is recovering in hospital after undergoing surgery for a long-standing wrist injury, with wife Victoria Beckham offering fans a glimpse into his recovery.On Friday, Victoria took to Instagram Stories to post a photo of the 50-year-old football icon lying in a hospital bed, dressed in a hospital gown with his arm resting in a blue sling.Captioning the photo “Get well soon daddy” with a heart emoji, the former Spice Girl and fashion designer showed support for her husband, who sustained the original injury back in 2003 during an England match.Though no further medical details were shared, the injury appears to be related to the same wrist issue that had lingered since his playing days. Despite the discomfort, Beckham appeared in good spirits, smiling gently for the camera as he recovered post-surgery.Victoria also posted another touching image of David holding a friendship bracelet bearing the message “Get well soon” spelled out in colorful beads -- likely a sweet gesture from one of their four children: Brooklyn, Romeo, Cruz, or Harper.The hospital update comes just weeks after it was announced that Beckham would receive a knighthood from King Charles, officially becoming “Sir David Beckham.” Victoria marked the news with pride on Instagram, writing, “You’ve always been my knight in shining armour, but now it’s official.”The couple recently celebrated Father’s Day as well, with Victoria sharing throwback clips and photos of David with their children, calling him “the best daddy there is.”Married since 1999, David and Victoria Beckham continue to show that family remains at the center of their lives—even during unexpected hospital stays.","David Beckham is recovering in hospital after undergoing surgery for a long- standing wrist injury.

Lazio have recalled Romano Floriani Mussolini to the club following his loan spell at Serie B side Juve Stabia. The 22-year-old right back is the great-grandson of Italian dictator Benito Mussolini and son of Alessandra Mussolini, a former European MP for Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia party.Mussolini initially joined Lazio in 2022 but did not make any appearances for the club. He spent the 2023-24 season on loan at Pescara, where he played 32 matches.At Juve Stabia, Mussolini established himself as a regular starter, making 37 appearances across all competitions. He contributed one goal and four assists during his time there. Despite Juve Stabia's interest in signing him permanently, Lazio opted to bring him back.Fascist fan groups have been present across Italian football, with Lazio's hardcore supporters maintaining ties to the extreme right since the 1970s. The club's historic ultras group, the 'Irriducibili', maintained friendly relations with similarly right-wing supporters at Inter and Verona.Verona's fan base has been involved in several controversial incidents.Their supporters have directed racist chants at Mario Balotelli and Franck Kessie, displayed swastikas in the stadium, and once arranged cars at a fan gathering to form a Nazi symbol in 2014.Some 20 years ago, former Verona club president Giambattista Pastorello stated he wouldn't sign a black player due to potential fan reaction.Nine years prior to that statement, Verona fans wearing Ku Klux Klan hoods hung an effigy of black Dutch player Maickel Ferrier from the stands. This incident occurred in protest of his potential signing, which was subsequently cancelled.","Lazio have recalled Romano Floriani Mussolini from Serie B side Juve Stabia.

Poll Do you think Kylian Mbappe's legal complaint against PSG is justified? Yes, absolutely No, it's unnecessary

What India are doing in Birmingham today, practice schedule, plan and more

France captain Kylian Mbappe has filed a legal complaint accusing former club Paris Saint-Germain of ""moral harassment"", according to the Paris prosecutor's office, which confirmed on Thursday that an investigation into the matter has been opened.The 26-year-old, who officially joined Real Madrid this summer after a prolific seven-year spell with PSG, is also in a legal tussle with the French champions over unpaid dues. Mbappe is seeking €55 million ($64.4 million) in unpaid wages and bonuses from the club.Mbappe’s latest grievance stems from how he was treated during the early stages of the 2023–24 season. According to the complaint, the striker was excluded from the first-team setup and made to train separately with players PSG were actively looking to offload — a move he believes was punitive after he declined to extend his contract with the club.The issue echoes broader concerns about contract-related coercion in football, a topic that has previously drawn attention from the French players' union, which lodged a formal complaint in a similar context last year.bappe was also omitted from PSG’s pre-season tour of Asia in 2023 and missed the opening match of the campaign. He was later reinstated to the first team following talks with the club’s hierarchy.The legal action adds another layer of tension to Mbappe’s departure from the French capital, where he scored 256 goals in 308 appearances and won numerous domestic titles. Notably, PSG lifted the UEFA Champions League for the first time in their history just weeks after his exit.The outcome of the investigation could have significant implications for both Mbappe’s claims and the club’s management practices, particularly in how high-profile players are treated during contract disputes.","Kylian Mbappe has filed a legal complaint accusing former club Paris Saint- Germain of ""moral harassment"", according to the Paris prosecutor's office.

Al Nassr has announced a two-year contract extension with Cristiano Ronaldo that will keep him at the Saudi Arabian club until 2027. The announcement came on Thursday after months of uncertainty about his future.The 40-year-old star confirmed his commitment in a video released by the team where he stated: ""Al Nassr forever.""Ronaldo's arrival in 2023 sparked a trend, leading many established players in the latter stages of their careers to move to Saudi Arabia.There was speculation about Ronaldo's future when he posted ""This chapter is over"" after Al Nassr finished third in the Saudi Pro League without winning any trophies.""Ronaldo's presence is a key factor in developing the Saudi league in the last two years and a half. He opens the door for elite and young players to come to Saudi Arabia,"" said a source from the Public Investment Fund (PIF) to AFP.The Saudi PIF, which manages the country's sovereign wealth fund, oversees several Pro League clubs including Al Nassr, Al Hilal, and Al Ahli.The news of Ronaldo's extension follows Brazilian star Neymar's departure from Al Hilal in January.Neymar's brief 18-month stint saw him play only seven matches while earning a reported $104 million annually.Despite being the league's top scorer with 25 goals, Ronaldo has yet to secure any Saudi or continental titles with Al Nassr. The team recently lost in the Asian Champions League semi-finals.The five-time Ballon d'Or winner had previously mentioned the possibility of ending his career with Al Nassr, a team popular among Saudi royals.Saudi Arabia has transformed its football landscape by investing heavily in European talent, beginning with Ronaldo's transfer in late 2022. The country is also set to host the 2034 World Cup.Saudi football enthusiasts have enjoyed watching prestigious players like Ronaldo and Karim Benzema, who collectively hold six Ballons d'Or, during regular league matches.Some observers have drawn parallels between the Saudi Pro League and the Chinese Super League, which previously attracted players with high salaries before facing financial difficulties.The Saudi Pro League's development aligns with the country's broader goals of becoming a tourism and business destination before global oil demand decreases.Ronaldo initially joined Al Nassr two years ago in a deal reportedly worth $250 million, marking a significant shift in his career path to Saudi Arabian football.","Cristiano Ronaldo has signed a two-year contract extension with Al Nassr.

Most wonderful shots from Jakarta E-Prix

It was a dusty yet thrilling Formula E race in Jakarta, with the championship returning to Indonesia after two years. Formula E has now shared some of the best videos from the Jakarta E-Prix for fans to relive the Indonesian race again and again. The real footage appears as eye-catching as scenes from a racing movie — complete with synchronized reactions from the audience and ground staff.The shots from the Jakarta E-Prix were shared by Formula E on Instagram with the caption: “Our race in Jakarta would have made a beautiful movie.” The first video is a still camera shot from a turn on the circuit, as the GEN3 Evo cars speed down the track. It is followed by a clip of a Lola Yamaha ABT driver getting into the car ahead of the race. There are also a few shots of the audience and ground staff moving their eyes from one direction to another as the cars race past.The post also includes a glimpse of Cupra Kiro driver Dan Ticktum celebrating his win by standing on his car amid loud cheers from his team members.

Formula E drivers with the most front row starts

Does pole position — or a front row start — guarantee a win? Well, in most cases, it does. If not, it at least enables the driver to finish the race on the podium or earn some points to add to their score in the Driver Standings. This season, it’s Nissan’s Oliver Rowland who has clinched five front row starts and is leading the 2025 Formula E Driver Standings. He is far ahead of the competition and is almost certain to have secured the ABB FIA Formula E World Championship title this year.Oliver Rowland is far ahead of the competition at the top of the Formula E Driver Standings with 172 points. He has taken pole twice and started on the front row in three other races this year.There is hardly any scenario in which anyone can beat him in the remaining four races — except one. If Pascal Wehrlein, who is second in the Driver Standings, wins and Rowland fails to score any points, then only can Rowland’s top spot be challenged. However, that is highly unlikely, and Rowland will most probably lift the world championship trophy in London with ease.TAG Heuer Porsche driver Pascal Wehrlein has three front row starts, including two poles.This suggests that front row starts do play a major role in a driver’s chances of a podium finish.Pascal, however, is behind Taylor Barnard, who has delivered the most impressive performance on track this year. The NEOM McLaren driver recorded four front row starts, including two poles this season. He already has four podium finishes in what can be considered his first year as a full-time Formula E driver.Meanwhile, DS Penske driver Maximilian Gunther, TAG Heuer Porsche’s Antonio Felix da Costa, and Andretti’s Jake Dennis have two front row starts each this season. Among others who have grabbed pole position are Nissan’s Norman Nato, Mahindra Racing’s Nyck de Vries, Cupra Kiro’s Dan Ticktum, and Jaguar TCS Racing’s Nick Cassidy.Also Read: Oliver Rowland’s daughter Harper turns four, Nissan driver shares glimpse of her birthday celebrations There are four more races to go before the current Formula E season comes to an end.

Watch: Extrication practice in Formula E

Every motorsport involves risk, where a single crash can prove life-threatening. Formula E has maintained a strong safety record over its eleven seasons so far. However, as a precautionary measure, Formula E drivers undergo extrication practice once a year to ensure they are familiar with the emergency protocols in case of an incident. Recently, NEOM McLaren driver Sam Bird participated in one such practice session. A glimpse of the session was shared with fans on social media, offering insight into this important aspect of motorsport safety.The video shows Sam Bird acting as an injured driver while the FIA Formula E safety team carefully lifts him out of the car and places him on a stretcher. The procedure is designed to avoid further injury, particularly to the neck or any broken bones.McLaren FE shared the video on Instagram with the caption: “Earlier today, Sam completed his extrication practice with the @fiaformulae safety team. This is an exercise that happens at each race with a different team each time. This is for both the safety of the drivers and the extrication team should an incident occur where the driver would need assistance exiting the car. Each driver has to do this at least once a year to ensure their own safety.Some fans were momentarily alarmed upon seeing the video. One commented, “Goodness grief — not me watching the first few seconds of this without context.” Another said, “That scared me there for a second.”In general, fans appreciated the behind-the-scenes look at Formula E's extrication protocol. “Never seen the neck wrap/support before, very neat,” wrote one. Another added, “Much love to the safety teams, always prepared and always do an incredible job.” A third said, “Awesome to see, safety above all.” One fan even joked, “An FIA-mandated nap sounds quite nice.”Also Read: Who is Sam Bird’s girlfriend Jess Impiazzi?

Training local marshals at Formula E circuits

Safety and technical knowledge are paramount in Formula E, where the sport involves handling some of the world’s fastest electric cars. Now, the FIA has given fans a behind-the-scenes look at how local marshals in each host country are trained before every Formula E race to ensure that operations run swiftly, efficiently, and to the highest standards.A video shared on the FIA Official Instagram page features Benoit Dupont, Head of Circuit Operations at FIA Formula E, offering a glimpse into the marshal training process at the Jakarta E-Prix.Speaking about the preparation in Jakarta this year, Dupont explains, “Before each Formula E race, we make sure that marshals are trained to the correct level to understand how to efficiently remove and recover a car. It's very important to have precise and fast operations. We've been in Indonesia before, but it was two years ago, so the goal here is to bring everyone back up to speed.”He adds that Formula E cars require a specific method of being lifted, particularly using a strap in a defined way. As a result, every post is trained individually to ensure marshals are fully up to date.Dupont also highlights the crucial role of the clerk of the course, who acts as a bridge between FIA officials and local marshals.He says, “Leaving a legacy is an important part of what the FIA brings to these races. There are international procedures that might not be followed at local races, so we ensure they meet the latest standards. That’s why we conduct training sessions like this,” he says. “The clerk of the course connects with the marshals, all the trackside personnel, and the recovery team. Since they communicate in their local language, the clerk ensures the communication line remains as efficient as possible.”Commenting on the video, one Formula E fan wrote, “Well done on showcasing these wonderful men and women who keep races going and clear up the mess after an OOPS moment from the drivers.”Also Read: Dan Ticktum shares unfiltered pictures and a note after Jakarta win, mentions losing F1 chance: “It wasn’t down to my attitude” The Jakarta E-Prix was a single-header this year, unlike its double-header format in the 2023 season. With just four more races remaining, the 2024–25 Formula E season is nearing its conclusion. Next up is the Berlin double-header on July 11–12, followed by the season finale in London on July 26–27.","FIA gives fans a behind-the-scenes look at how local marshals in each host country are trained before every Formula E race.

Nyck De Vries of Mahindra Racing has finally spoken up after his controversial race at the Jakarta E-Prix, where he received a ten-second time penalty for hitting Andretti’s Jake Dennis just moments before the race ended.

Dan Ticktum bares his feelings after maiden Formula E win



Dan Ticktum’s fans hail him for his unfiltered note



Dan Ticktum shared several memorable pictures from race day and the victory celebration after winning his maiden Formula E race in Jakarta. He penned a long note on his breakthrough win and, true to his unapologetic self, the Cupra Kiro driver didn’t mince words while opening his heart to fans on Instagram, along with a bunch of pictures.

Starting from the very beginning, he wrote, “So there it is, first win in @fiaformulae in the books. I am immensely proud of what this great team of people have achieved this year. As some of you know, I was very close to being in F1 several years ago, but due to some political s****, it wasn’t meant to be. (For those too ignorant — no, it wasn’t down to my attitude). I was ready to give up racing, as at the time, my dream — to me at least — was over.”Moving to his switch to Formula E, he added, “However, an opportunity arose to take part in this exciting, relatively new championship, full of the best drivers in the world.@alexhuigusto and @russellohagan were instrumental in giving me this opportunity, and they, along with the rest of the team, have stuck by me during three very tough years being the least funded team on the grid. This year, with our new investment, it has enabled us to embark on an exciting new chapter with @porsche.motorsport and @cupra_official. The support from them has been immense.”He further wrote, “Long story short — I’m glad I didn’t give up and kept trying to pursue big things in motorsport. The @fiaformulae championship, and @jeffformulae in particular, have given me an environment where I can be me (mostly), and I can finally say that this year I’m enjoying my job again. Thank you to everyone who has supported me to this point. I know it’s only one race win, but it conjured up a lot of emotions for me personally, along with my father and family, who sacrificed so much. Plenty more to come, I hope. Onto Berlin!”Posting pictures of himself showing middle fingers to the camera, he added at the end, “P.S. Last 2 slides are for all those who doubted me.”IndyCar racer Louis Foster reacted to his post, saying, “Mega mega mega mate.” There was also a congratulatory message from the FIA Formula E page. Social media star Juca Vipari wrote, “YESSSSS BROTHER! The first of many!!”A fan also told Ticktum in the comments section, “Enjoy 1 million beers.” Another said, “A fight-or-flight mode and you chose the harder option with an EXTREMELY high reward — and it paid off! Congrats Dan! The first of many.” One more added, “So deserved. Thinking from the end of last year to where you and the team are now — seriously amazing work.

There’s then a glimpse of the garage, which smells like “focused rubber and podium energy.” He even has his own name for media day, which he calls “Smile until your face hurts.”It’s also revealed that Da Costa sits with the engineers to understand the data – and he actually gets it. As he suits up in his race gear, it’s said to be “30 percent style and 70 percent sweat.” The video also offers a close look at his Porsche electric car, which he races in the Formula E Grand Prix this season.His fans loved the fun video and called it “awesome”.

Sergio Aguero takes on the race track in a GEN3 Evo



All about GEN3 Evo Sessions

Manchester City star Sergio Aguero is one of the few chosen ones to get a chance to drive a Formula E car on a race track. The footballer had his own GEN3 Evo session, guided by none other than TAG Heuer Porsche driver Pascal Wehrlein. And Aguero nailed it by driving the electric race car like a pro, although he missed his engineer’s message to slow down to cool the tyres.Sergio Aguero got the opportunity to drive the Porsche 99X Electric GEN3 Evo Formula E car during Miami’s Evo Sessions on March 5 and 6. The video from his Evo session is pure entertainment, as he takes lap after lap, clearly enjoying the thrill of driving a race car.Earlier, the official handle of FIA Formula E shared a video from Sergio’s Evo Session on Instagram. It showed how the footballer missed the messages to slow down and continued at high speed despite the need to cool the tyres. He later asked them to raise the volume and eventually slowed down. Pascal Wehrlein was seen doing a great job coaching him over the radio.The 37-year-old told Formulae.com about the opportunity, “This is absolutely crazy: from footballer to racing driver in one of the fastest racing cars in the world.Every child is familiar with Porsche. The brand represents an iconic heritage, particularly in motorsport. I am absolutely delighted and would like to thank everyone involved for this unique opportunity.”Aguero and other participants underwent detailed training, which included simulator sessions, physical conditioning, driver coaching, hardware customization, and engineering briefings. It not only gave them the thrill of driving a race car but also gave viewers insight into the intricate world of Formula E — how a driver is trained and how the car is driven during a race. A complete documentary will be released later this year, showcasing the entire Evo Sessions footage.Sharing his reaction when Formula E CEO Jeff Dodds first presented the idea, he said, “The initial reaction when I presented the concept of ‘Evo Sessions’ to our teams and partners was, ‘This is wild!’ — which is when I immediately knew we had to bring it to life. We wanted to do something that has never been done before in motorsport; something that would give audiences and our fan base a unique perspective into the world of a Formula E driver, through the eyes of some of their favourite online personalities. ”He added, “Formula E is the fastest-growing motorsport in the world, and we have a clear target to hit half a billion fans by 2030. Through collaborating with some of the biggest names in popular culture right now, we’re able to open up Formula E to a whole new fanbase.”Also Read: Pascal Wehrlein on second place in Shanghai: “First time I felt like we were very competitive in the wet” Even the trainers are among the best Formula E drivers in the world.

Edoardo Mortara on being part of Mahindra Racing



Formula E Season 11 has turned out well for most teams, with new podium winners emerging in each round. At the recently held Jakarta E-Prix, it was Mahindra Racing’s Edoardo Mortara who secured his first podium of the season and the team’s second. While he’s happy to have claimed second place in Jakarta, he feels they could have achieved even more. His teammate, Nyck De Vries, was handed a ten-second time penalty for colliding with Jake Dennis as they approached the finish line.Edoardo Mortara joined Mahindra Racing in 2023 and had been chasing a podium finish ever since. Speaking after securing second place at the Jakarta E-Prix, the 38-year-old said, “I’m feeling kind of disappointed for the team because I think that more was possible for us, but actually happy for me. It’s been a long time coming, this podium, and if I look back, there were several occasions where, with a bit more luck, we could have changed it. ”Mortara found his podium opportunity when both his teammate Nyck De Vries and Andretti’s Jake Dennis were removed from contention after their collision. “But nevertheless, super happy with today’s race. I think we managed the strategy pretty well, especially with the first Attack Mode.We got a little bit unlucky with the Safety Car and Full Course Yellow because I think I could have made good use of my Attack Mode and passed Dan [Ticktum]. I was in front of him before the second Attack Mode. Nevertheless, super happy with second place and already looking forward to the next one,” he said.However, Mortara regrets that Jakarta isn't a double-header this year, unlike its last edition in 2023. ""Right from the start of the year, we're showing more and more performance, and this weekend we were really, really good. It's a shame that we only have one race here. I would have hoped to have a second one,"" he told FormulaE.com in an interview.Now running high on confidence, Mortara aims to continue the momentum in the upcoming Berlin double-header. He has achieved multiple podiums in Berlin in previous years, including one win.Reflecting on Mahindra Racing’s significant improvement this season, Mortara said, ""This year has been crucial for us. We brought some big updates in terms of software that helped us close a bit of the gap with the front-runners. I feel that now we have a package that is capable — not always, but on certain race weekends — of challenging at the front, and we probably had the best package in the race. Nevertheless, this result (Jakarta) shows great promise for the final race weekends, especially Berlin, which has always been a good one for me.

More Than a Team: The Rise of CSK & the Whistle Podu Army

In one of the most dramatic finishes in Pakistan Super League history, Zimbabwe’s Sikandar Raza flew in from England and arrived at the Gaddafi Stadium just 10 minutes before the toss — only to hit the winning runs and crown Lahore Qalandars as PSL 2025 champions.The 39-year-old all-rounder was greeted by raucous cheers as he smashed an unbeaten 22 off 7 balls, sealing a six-wicket victory over Quetta Gladiators with a boundary off the penultimate delivery.Raza, who had played a Test match for Zimbabwe in Nottingham less than 24 hours earlier, made an unforgettable impact despite the whirlwind journey that included stops in Birmingham, Dubai, Abu Dhabi, and finally Lahore.""Had dinner in Birmingham, breakfast in Dubai, lunch in Abu Dhabi and dinner in Pakistan. I’m just blessed to live this life,"" said Raza after being carried off the field by his ecstatic teammates.Chasing 202 to win, Lahore Qalandars completed the highest successful chase in a PSL final, finishing on 204/4 in 19.5 overs. Sri Lankan batter Kusal Perera starred with a blistering 62* off 31 balls, while Mohammad Naeem (46) and Abdullah Shafique (41) set the foundation.Quetta had earlier posted 201/9, thanks largely to a brilliant 76 by young Hasan Nawaz and a late assault by Faheem Ashraf, who hammered 23 runs off the final over. However, Shaheen Afridi (3-24) and Haris Rauf (2-41) kept Quetta in check at the death.With this win, Lahore clinched their third PSL title — adding to their 2022 and 2023 triumphs — and joined Islamabad United as the most successful teams in PSL history.In a season already marked by a mid-tournament suspension due to political tensions, Raza’s last-minute arrival and heroics provided the perfect Hollywood-style finish.","Lahore Qalandars beat Quetta Gladiators by six wickets to win Pakistan Super League 2025.

PARIS: The sky was dark and the sun was a whimsical presence on Sunday, but when the roof over Court Philippe-Chatrier folded up and Rafael Nadal walked onto his ground, for the first time not as a competitor, it rained tears of love.Spectators, VIP guests and media were all handed tees, the colour of Nadal’s beloved red clay. In white were the words, ‘Merci, Rafa’ underlined with the date 25/05/2025.Nadal, who was welcomed onto the court by a full house that included family, friends and fellow competitors, including Carlos Alcaraz and Iga Swiatek, was in all black. The 14-time Roland Garros champion, who has played on this court in pinks, mauves and yellows, chose black for this ceremonial outing.The legendary Spaniard, in his emotional address, thanked his team, including his first coach Uncle Toni, family and fans, and had special words for this venue, his favourite hunting ground, which he called “the most important court of my career”. The 22-time Major winner, who stopped his address many times to clear his throat and wipe a tear, was greeted by three of his greatest rivals – Roger Federer Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray – on court.“After all these years fighting for everything it’s unbelievable how time changes the perspective.You don’t know Novak yet,” Nadal said. “Probably you know already Andy. With Roger we have talked about it a couple times. All of the nerves, pressure, strange feelings you feel when we see each other as rivals… It’s completely different when you finish your career.”“In the end, all of us achieved our dreams, we built amazing rivalries. We showed the world that we can fight as hard as possible but still be good colleagues and respect each other.”As a final act, Nadal’s footprint, marked out at courtside on Chatrier, was unveiled. There was not a dry eye on the ground, not in the stands, not those of his rivals and certainly not Nadal’s.",Rafael Nadal has announced his retirement from tennis.

IPL 2025: Daniel Vettori explains Shami’s struggles, Reddy’s limited role

Ajinkya Rahane reflects on KKR’s inconsistent IPL 2025, backs under-fire Venkatesh Iyer

Brief Scores:

NEW DELHI: Sunrisers Hyderabad started this IPL season by posting 286/4 against Rajasthan Royals. On Sunday evening, in front of a half-empty Feroz Shah Kotla, they ended their campaign with 278/3 against Kolkata Knight Riders in an inconsequential match. The team’s struggles between the two matches notwithstanding, SRH batting lived up to its reputation of being power-packed entertainers.The score was always going to be daunting for KKR to chase down as they folded timidly for just 168 in 18.4 overs and brought down the curtains on an ordinary season under Ajinkya Rahane When Heinrich Klaasen nonchalantly brought up his 100 off 37 balls in the final ball of the 19th over, he stood for the very essence of SRH’s batting prowess. They may have faltered for most part of the season, but Travis Head’s 76 off 40 and Abhishek Sharma’s 16-ball 32 that complemented Klaasen’s unbeaten 105 off 39, was all about the entertainment this batting unit had promised coming into the tournament. Defending the target, Jaydev Unadkat and Eshan Malinga returned figures of 3/24 and 3/31.For Sunrisers, their batters finishing the season strongly was important for their pride. They bowed out promising another big season next year.Perhaps, the SRH batters went into a game unencumbered for the first time in the tournament. The absolute hard and flat track played a catalyst against a visibly low-on-confidence KKR bowling attack. What Head and Klaasen did must have left the KKR bowlers scarred. The two batters hardly broke a sweat as they crunched 6 and 9 sixes.F or KKR, Varun Chakravarthy’s deliveries never lacked bite like it did on Sunday. This season, it became more evident that he is a pale shadow of himself on pitches that offered little assistance for his mystery spin. Klaasen went about smoking one effortless six after another down the ground as if Chakravarthy was giving him harmless throwdowns. KKR’s trump card eventually returned figures of 0/54 in three overs.On the whole, SRH’s batting has been a symbol of brute force for the last two seasons.Sunrisers Hyderabad: 278/3 in 20 overs (Heinrich Klaasen 105 not out, Travis Head 76; Sunil Narine 2/42) vs Kolkata Knight Riders: 168 all out in 18.4 overs (Manish Pandey 37, Harshit Rana 34; Jaydev Unadkat 3/24, Eshan Malinga 3/31, Harsh Dubey 3/34).Result: SRH won by 110 runs.",Sunrisers Hyderabad beat Kolkata Knight Riders by 110 runs.

AHMEDABAD: Chennai Super Kings (CSK) displayed remarkable batting prowess at the Narendra Modi Stadium on Sunday, with their mid-season acquisitions Ayush Mhatre, Urvil Patel, and Dewald Brevis leading the charge to post an impressive 230/5 against Gujarat Titans. The five-time IPL champions complemented their batting with excellent fielding and bowling to secure an 83-run victory.Despite this commanding win, CSK finished last in the ten-team standings with eight points. GT accumulated 18 points, but their recent defeats put their top-two position in doubt, pending other results.The triumph was initially built on Mhatre’s 34 (17b, 3x4, 3x6) in the powerplay, aggressive batting in the middle overs by Urvil (37 off 19b; 4x4, 2x6) and Shivam Dube (17 off 8b; 2x6), and Brevis’ (57 off 23b; 4x4, 5x6) scintillating hitting in the death overs.The fireworks started as early as the second over when Mhatre took a special liking to Arshad Khan hitting him for 28 runs. He slammed two sixes over long-on and mid-wicket. He followed it up with two fours on either side of the wicket. The 17-year-old then hooked the left-arm pacer for a maximum over long leg as CSK galloped to 34 in two overs.Prasidh Krishna (2/22) was introduced in the fourth over, and Mhatre who tried to keep going, skied one to mid-off where Mohammad Siraj took a good overhead catch.Urvil flicked Siraj over mid-wicket for a maximum to get going. He hit left-arm spinner R Sai Kishore over deep mid-wicket before falling to the left-arm spinner who had Patel lofting him to skipper Shubman Gill at extra cover.Dube smashed two maximums before being caught by Gerald Coetzee off Shahrukh Khan’s part-time offspin. Devon Conway (52 off 35b; 6x4, 2x6), at the other end, helped himself to a half-century before being castled by Rashid Khan, as CSK reached 156/4 in the 14th over.Thereafter, Brevis and Ravindra Jadeja (21* off 18b; 1x4, 1x6) added 74 off 39 balls for the fifth wicket. Brevis showed no mercy on any of the bowlers, depositing Rashid, Siraj (twice), Coetzee, and Prasidh into the stands.In pursuit, the Titans never got going, with Gill (13) edging to Urvil in slips off Anshul Kamboj. Soon, Buttler (5) and Rutherford (0) were sent back by Khaleel Ahmed and Kamboj (3/13), as the Titans slipped to 35/3 in the powerplay. B Sai Sudharsan (41) and Shahrukh (19) added 55 for the fourth wicket before Jadeja (2/17) had both the batters caught at backward point in the 11th over. The lower order tried, but it was too much to do as the Titans were bowled out for 147. Left-arm wrist spinner Noor Ahmad (3/21) leapfrogged Prasidh for the Purple Cap.","Chennai Super Kings beat Gujarat Titans by 83 runs. CSK finished last in the ten-team standings with eight points.

Indian cricket stepped into a new era on Saturday with the selectors picking Shubman Gill (25) as captain for the challenging England tour, overruling concerns that he’s still finding his feet at the international level, particularly in overseas conditions. With legends Virat Kohli Rohit Sharma and R Ashwin all having quit Tests, the selectors had several tricky decisions to make.As per medical advice, Bumrah will not play all 5 Tests and his bowling skills are too important for Indian cricket to risk another injury to him. KL Rahul could have been an interim option but selectors wanted a long-term captain. Gill has impressed the selectors and team management with his leadership potential and has also shown impressive growth as a skipper over two IPL seasons with Gujarat Titans.One of India’s best Test batters in the past 5 years. Can read the game as wicketkeeper and his experience will help Gill. Hasn’t been in great nick of late, but selectors are backing him to turn around his form.Sarfaraz began his Test career well in India but team management not confident about how he’ll fare abroad. Nair has had a golden run in domestic cricket and also has experience of playing in England, which will be valuable following the sudden vacuum created by the exits of Rohit and Virat.Arshdeep has county experience, and his swing bowling can be lethal in England. As a left-hander, he also brings a different angle. Rana made an impressive Test debut in Australia but didn’t fare too well after that and there’s a feeling he still needs to develop as a red-ball bowler.He last played a Test in June 2023. Since then he has played only 1 first-class match, in Nov 2024. With Bumrah already likely to miss 1-2 Tests, selectors were unwilling to gamble on the fitness of another senior bowler.",Shubman Gill named India's Test captain for England tour.

Disallowed goal in the Premier League sparks controversy

""big mistake""

Implications for Aston Villa's European ambitions

On the last day of the Premier League season, a questionable refereeing call killed off Aston Villa's dream of a Champions League place they coveted so long, in a 2-0 loss at Old Trafford to Manchester United. The game turned on the moment that Villa’s Morgan Rogers appeared to have scored, but his goal was disallowed for what appeared to be a foul on United’s goalkeeper, Altay Bayindir. That incident, together with other match facts, left Villa out of Europe's leading club competition.Rogers was the man to punish a loose ball from a headed Bayindir after the goalkeeper could not collect cleanly, slotting it into the net in the 55th minute with the scores still level. Yet referee Thomas Bramall had already whistled for a foul as Rogers challenged the keeper. This hyperactive whistle made the action non-reviewable by VAR, prompting outrage on the part of Villa players and supporters. Replays showed Bayindir did not have full control of the ball, with many left thinking the goal should have stood. Ex-referee Peter Walton agreed, saying it was a goal and should have stood.Villa boss Unai Emery voiced his displeasure at the decision, which he said was aBut Hibernian captain John McGinn was also left grumbling about the decision to hand an inexperienced referee such an important match with so much riding on it for the club.The goal that wasn’t a turning point. Shortly later, Manchester United went ahead from Amad Diallo, before a late Christian Eriksen penalty ensured Villa left with nothing from the encounter. The defeat, coupled with a win for Newcastle United, saw Villa end the league season in sixth place on the same number of points as Newcastle, but with an inferior goal difference. Newcastle, therefore, sealed the fourth and last Champions League place, causing Villa to drop into the subsequent year's Europa League.The financial implications are huge, with lost revenue in the Champions League of more than £100m believed to be at stake for Villa. The club is also said to be considering filing an official complaint against their man in the middle, in order to get an explanation and, potentially, some form of accountability.Also Read: Premier League: Chelsea, Aston Villa boost Champions League qualification hopes with wins over Man Utd, S Nonetheless, Villa's season had its bright moments, with an impressive campaign in European competition and an above-average league showing.

A season of unprecedented achievements for Mohammed Salah

On the final day of the 2024–25 Premier League season, Liverpool's Mohamed Salah won the Golden Boot, Playmaker of the Season, and Player of the Season awards. But it was his daughters who became the toast of his fans across the world while walking side by side with him on the field, holding his trophies and bathing in sweet victory.Salah's daughters were by his side following the post-match celebrations, after Liverpool had drawn 1-1 with Crystal Palace at Anfield to conclude their title-winning campaign. Clutching their father's Golden Boot and Playmaker awards, the little girls played up to the crowd. It was a deja vu moment for the Maghawris after Salah’s then four-year-old daughter Makka dribbled a ball outwitting defender Lucas Digne on the Anfield pitch in 2018 after Liverpool’s first game of the season, much to the delight of the home supporters.The tradition of celebrating such special moments with his children has become a tradition of Salah's post-season periods, emphasizing the close relationship he has with his kids and the happiness they provide to the footballing world. Supporters flooded social media with clips of the heartwarming scene while hailing Salah not just a phenomenon on the pitch, but a dedicated father.Mohamed Salah has been brilliant this season.That was enough to equate the record for most goal contributions in a Premier League season (29 goals, 18 assists), a record that was previously set by Alan Shearer and Andy Cole. He was instrumental in Liverpool’s victory in the club’s 20th top-flight title, equalling Manchester United’s record.As well as his on-field success, Salah was named Football Writers’ Association Footballer of the Year for a third time, becoming only the second player after Thierry Henry to achieve that feat. His never-ending quality, leadership, and humility have made him one of the all-time best in the Premier League.Also Read: Mohamed Salah's net worth: How rich is Liverpool's Egyptian king in 2025? While Salah continually smashes records and establishes new benchmarks, moments like these with his children remind us of the personal happiness to be had from professional success and will no doubt only endear him more to fans around the world. Their appearance was a poignant ending to a special season — a true family success.","Mohammed Salah's daughters steal the spotlight at Anfield.

Where will Alejandro Garnacho go next? 5 clubs that could sign the Man Utd winger,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/news/where-will-alejandro-garnacho-go-next-5-clubs-that-could-sign-the-man-utd-winger/articleshow/121397643.cms,"Image Source: Getty

Alejandro Garnacho as Manchester United’s rising star

Alejandro Garnacho's impact at Manchester United

Five clubs that could be Alejandro Garnacho’s next destination

Real Madrid – Going back to Spain may have its short-term appeal for Garnacho, while Los Blancos have their reputation for investing in young attacking players.

Atlético Madrid – Maybe a return to the old club, if they are indeed looking for a winger capable of dynamism and with La Liga experience.

Juventus – These Italian big guns have a history of nurturing young talents, claiming to provide them with a starring role.

Paris Saint-Germain – PSG looks to bolster its wings, and Garnacho's style would fit their attacking philosophy down to the T.

Bayern Munich – The Bundesliga champions have been on the trail of young wingers and could offer Garnacho Champions League football and development in a disciplined environment.



The summer transfer window is opening, and it seems to be providing a tantalising view on the future of Manchester United winger Alejandro Garnacho. The youngster from Argentina has charmed the crowd with his explosive speed, some good footwork, and increasing maturity in play. With several top European clubs reportedly interested in carving him out, the big question now is: where could Garnacho go next?Born in 2004 in Spain, Alejandro Garnacho started his youth career at Atlético Madrid and, later, in 2020, joined the Manchester United academy. In 2022, the 17-year-old Garnacho had the dangerous label installed and made his first appearance for the Liverpool senior team. Having eligibility for Spain and Ireland, he chose to accept Argentina instead, making his debut for the senior side in 2023.Since breaking into the senior team of Manchester United, Garnacho has made inroads into the domestic and continental arenas. Eyes were drawn on in the 2022-23 season for scoring the important goals, getting the important assists, one of them being a late finish against Fulham in the Premier League. Able to roam widely across attacking territory and stretch the defensive line, his wish to take the man on, main or substitute, renders him important.In his early 20s, Garnacho is still so young and has had invaluable experience in great competitions such as the FA Cup and the Europa League. With the renewed expectations under Rúben Amorim, the pressure on the young winger continued to build. While he grows mature on important occasions and pressure moments on the field, injuries are now casting doubts on whether he is ready to take on more responsibilities, or quite possibly move to a different club this coming transfer window.Also Read: Every Manchester United player up for sale: Here’s what each player is worth As the speculation around his future grows, a handful of the top clubs seem to have shown interest should Manchester United entertain the idea of selling or loaning him:Wherever he ends up, Garnacho’s future promises to be as exciting as his rise.","Argentine winger Alejandro Garnacho is Manchester United's rising star. The 20-year-old has been linked with a move away from Old Trafford. Real Madrid, Bayern Munich, Juventus and Paris Saint-Germain are among the clubs interested.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121397641,imgsize-1041372,width-400,resizemode-4/121397641.jpg"

Shubman Gill story: From a remote village near the border to India’s Test captain

India Test squad for England tour: Shubman Gill to lead, Rishabh Pant his deputy

Prolific yet controversial manager Antonio Conte and Napoli President Aurelio De Laurentiis joining hands can be described as anything but a match made in heaven. While Conte is very vocal when dissatisfied, going to the extent of resigning, De Laurentiis can be demanding and extremely eccentric. However, after trying out three managers in the 2023/24 season and eventually finishing 10th, it came down to an unlikely union between Conte and De Laurentiis.The ex-Chelsea manager openly expressed apprehensions over Napoli's squad balance, considering the 10th-placed finish just after winning the league. However, De Laurentiis opted to play hardball over the sale of striker Victor Osimhen, delaying potential signings.Conte had to wait until the last few days of the summer transfer window for the arrival of Romelu Lukaku, Scott McTominay, and Billy Gilmour, who had been largely written off by the masses. While Lukaku and McTominay had become the subject of ridicule, with the latter especially mocked at Manchester United , Chelsea had opted to let go of Gilmour. Fans termed the trio as Premier League rejects, raising questions over the squad's overall quality as well.However, Conte lived up to his reputation of being a miracle man once again, empowering the players by making them ""suffer."" “Sometimes people need to use their brains and say, ‘These guys are really scraping the bottom of the barrel and still out there fighting. Damn it, do you expect not to suffer?’"" said the Napoli manager. ""Conte demands a lot from every player. He can reprimand you too. Conte's training sessions are the toughest I've done,"" shared Neres.The hard work on the training ground certainly paid rich dividends, as the same team that ""melted like snow"" in Napoli's first match, as described by Conte, began dominating. While the team's momentum did suffer a jolt following the exit of star player Khvicha Kvaratskhelia in the winter window, the Italian manager ensured the ship remained afloat with shrewd tactical changes.""Conte changed his system from a back-three formation to a back-four line. While Conte is usually very organised with mid-level pressure and even a low zonal approach, Napoli are also very aggressive with the ball now. He almost burns out the players, but I don't see it as a negative. Conte is demanding because he has a vision,"" said European football coach Albin Sheqiri during an exclusive interaction with TimesofIndia.com.While Napoli's rapid rise certainly raised eyebrows, what especially grabbed the limelight was the manner in which McTominay and Lukaku stood out as absolute match-winners. Lukaku rediscovered his Midas touch, emerging as the team's top scorer in Serie A 2024/25 with 14 goals and 10 assists. ""Conte brought out the best from all these rejected players, infusing in them the importance of a great attitude to be competitive. Napoli emerged as a compact team capable of weathering the strongest of storms,"" reacted ex-East Bengal head coach Mario Rivera.McTominay, who rarely scored at Manchester United, emerged as a reliable campaigner with 12 goals in 34 appearances. The Scottish footballer's performances were so prolific that ex-Napoli striker Paolo Di Canio remarked that he'd arrest United's directors for selling the midfielder.""Conte used McTominay very well in a box-to-box position where he could support Lukaku, in comparison to playing between number six and eight at United. Lukaku is very good with his target play and also opens up space for other players, which was capitalised upon,"" said Sheqiri.While Napoli surged from triumph to triumph, they were evenly matched by rivals Inter Milan. The title race eventually came down to the last gameweek, where Napoli had to avoid defeat at all costs, with Inter hot on their heels. Conte had suffered heartbreak in such situations as a player, and anxiety would definitely have set in after Inter took an early lead against Verona. However, Napoli's talisman McTominay stepped up when it mattered most, scoring the opener with a scissor kick. Lukaku sealed the momentum with a second goal, wrapping up one of football's most inspirational league triumphs. ""It was my most unexpected, toughest, and most stimulating league triumph,"" reacted Conte.Napoli scripted Serie A history by pulling off a league triumph after finishing 10th in the previous season — a comeback no side has ever achieved — summing up a glorious campaign that will go down fondly in the annals of history.","Antonio Conte and Aurelio De Laurentiis joined hands at Napoli in 2023/24 season. Conte brought out the best from rejected players, including Scott McTominay and Romelu Lukaku. Lukaku emerged as top scorer in Serie A 2024/25 with 14 goals and 10 assists.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121396585,imgsize-163218,width-400,resizemode-4/121396585.jpg"

Kylian Mbappe adds star power to the grid

Courtois and Zidane bring football royalty to Monte Carlo

On track, the Monaco Grand Prix 2025 was no simple matter of thundering engines and razor-edge tactics. Off it, you could just as easily find your favourite footballing stars. The glitzy and tough streets of Monte Carlo played host to elite athletes and celebrities alike this weekend, with Kylian Mbappe , Thibaut Courtois, and Zinedine Zidane all turning heads as they watched on at the Formula 1.One of the most discussed guests at the race was Paris Saint-Germain forward Kylian Mbappé. The sight of him set fans, photographers, and media into a frenzy. Here he was waving the chequered flag to respect the end of the Grand Prix, an arguably prestigious activity reserved for celebrities on race day, such as Mbappé.His team restricted media access during the traditional pre-race grid walk, but Mbappé took his time and made his way through the media throng unflustered. The French striker, known for being one of the few humble superstars, was genuinely excited to see the race up close. His entry into F1 was a reminder — if one were needed — of how the series has remained able to draw high-class athletes from other sports, who want to be in on the action, and the show.Real Madrid shot-stopper Thibaut Courtois also attended the Grand Prix, rubbing elbows with fellow professionals and enjoying the friendly rivalry.Courtois has been a motorsport fan for many years and has attended past Formula 1 races, revealing his perspective on the sport's tactical elements.Former Real Madrid manager and arguably one of the greatest footballers ever, Zinedine Zidane, was also present at the event as brand ambassador of the Alpine F1 Team. And his continued involvement with the team speaks to the continuing crossover between top football and Formula 1. Both are now branches of sport defined by similar aspects of professionalism and performance, high levels of discipline, and focus.Also Read: Indian national anthem echoes at Monte Carlo as Kush Maini makes history with F2 Sprint win at Monaco GP Zidane did not just sit and watch; he mingled, spoke to fans and the team, and brought a combination of football knowledge and appreciation for the technical side of F1 to proceedings.The 2025 Monaco Grand Prix, however, demonstrated once again that this particular event has transcended 'sporting event' to become an international party. Still, with legends such as Mbappé, Courtois, and Zidane at the venue, it remains the ultimate playground for champions, on and off track.","Kylian Mbappe, Thibaut Courtois, and Zinedine Zidane all attended the Monaco Grand Prix 2025.

How much could Xabi Alonso earn compared to Carlo Ancelotti at Real Madrid?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/news/how-much-could-xabi-alonso-earn-compared-to-carlo-ancelotti-at-real-madrid/articleshow/121395643.cms,"Image Source: Getty

Carlo Ancelotti's tenure and remuneration at Real Madrid

Anticipated earnings for Xabi Alonso at Real Madrid

Real Madrid is about to enter a new managerial era as recent prospect Xabi Alonso is about to replace the club's most decorated coach, Carlo Ancelotti. With Alonso's hiring being a landmark moment, this begs the question of the financial side of things — namely, how much will Alonso be making compared to his predecessor?Carlo Ancelotti's second reign at Real Madrid between 2021 and 2025 was a highly successful period. During his time, Real Madrid won 15 major trophies, three of which were Champions League titles and two league titles, as well as other domestic and international trophies.Ancelotti was also handsomely rewarded financially, with a yearly salary of around €11 million (£8.3 million), making him one of the highest-paid managers in football. His contract, which was extended just last December to run through 2026, contained clauses guaranteeing him full pay in case of ‘early termination.’ However, following a season that fell short of expectations, Ancelotti and the club parted ways amicably, with the Italian manager taking charge of the Brazilian national team.After leading Bayer Leverkusen to an unbeaten domestic double, Xabi Alonso has returned to Real Madrid—this time as head coach. Though the terms of Alonso's deal were not finalized with Real, it is expected that Alonso's contract will be less than Ancelotti's, given that he has only recently embarked on a career as a top-level manager.Also Read: Real Madrid appoint Xabi Alonso as coach Although actual salary figures are not revealed yet, even by industry standards, Alonso's annual take could fall anywhere between €6 million to €8 million, with further performance-related bonuses and incentives being on the conservative end of the scale. This assessment comes close in line with Real Madrid's long-term strategy of providing attractive collective agreements that are nonetheless performance-based for all managers.The cost of confirming the Spaniard, who led his former Bundesliga club Bayer Leverkusen last season, is said to have been £10 million in compensation, something that shows just how much the club believes in the new man at the wheel.",Xabi Alonso is set to replace Carlo Ancelotti as Real Madrid coach.

Jake Hughes’s performance this season

Maserati MSG Racing driver Jake Hughes may not be having an ideal Formula E season, but the British racer has a lot to look forward to in Shanghai at the upcoming double header.

Sharing a slow-motion video of himself in a helmet days after the race, Hughes wrote on Instagram, “Japan was a rough one.

Stoffel Vandoorne shares their strategy for Tokyo race

It cannot be just a coincidence that Maserati MSG Racing driver Stoffel Vandoorne started from the 14th position on the grid and went on to win the Tokyo E-Prix Round 8. He even managed to beat Nissan’s Oliver Rowland, who had started from pole. Vandoorne shined while others struggled with poor visibility, a slippery track, and grip issues as it rained cats and dogs during the Tokyo race. Not only that, he also recovered from a spin on the wet track to cross the finish line first. The Tokyo winner says it’s all because of how their plan fell in place to perfection.Stoffel Vandoorne revealed that their winning strategy involved a calculated risk of taking the Pit Boost early in the race, which could have worked in their favor if there had been a race stoppage, allowing them to save time during the gap.""It was not an easy race, but a lot of opportunities with the rain and the management. We kind of gamble a little bit with our strategy but it was also calculated at the same time. The plan perfectly played in our hands, and the chances of this happening in Formula E are very, very slim,” Vandoorne told Formula E in an interview.""It was difficult because I had to manage so many things. I was on the radio with my engineer in between laps and he was giving me advice on the gap that I had to Oliver (Rowland) to make sure I was safe enough with my energy.I was struggling, and I was down to 10% at some point and I had to bring the car home so there was a lot of management to do,"" he added.Vandoorne moved to Maserati MSG Racing last season and is in love with his new team. Talking about the same, he said, ""I’m just happy for the team, for myself, it’s been a little while. They are such a good group of people, some familiar faces from the past as well, their vibe is super cool, their base is Monaco and that is my home as well. They are making my life easy.""Also Read: Tokyo E-Prix Round 8 results: Stoffel Vandoorne clinches long-awaited win in wet conditions; Oliver Rowland finishes second Stoffel Vandoorne’s much-awaited win came three years after his last victory in Monaco in 2022.

Reflecting on the moment, the Nissan driver told Formulae.com, ""I was already tired after qualifying. I was feeling pretty stressed with everything. There was a lot of pressure to go through. I was looking forward to the race being over, to be honest, and when it was over... when I saw her face I just couldn't help but be super emotional.""[The atmosphere] was amazing.

We didn’t really expect any racing this afternoon - the weather was really bad - so for it to dry off enough that we could race was really surprising, and to get another podium was incredible.

First ever podium finish for Dan Ticktum

Dan Ticktum couldn’t hide his emotions after securing the first podium finish of his Formula E career, coming home third at the Tokyo E-Prix Round 9 on Sunday. The race was won by Nissan’s Oliver Rowland, who took a significant step closer to clinching the world championship title. Ticktum, driving for Cupra Kiro, was visibly elated after the race and shared a heartfelt message with his team over the radio.“Very good, gentlemen. Great job. Well done, everyone. I am so happy for you guys, I really am. Everyone doubts me, but I’m going to start proving them wrong. That’s nice. Many drivers are giving me thumbs up—how lovely. Right, I want a beer,” he said over the team radio.Sharing his feelings after the podium win, Dan Ticktum said: “It feels pretty good! I’m already like ‘if we had done this or done that’ I could have won, but I’m very happy overall and it’s a big boost for the team. I just don’t feel like we’ve ever had a breakthrough this season and that’s it. We’re really competing consistently at the top now across all conditions and the team executed a pretty flawless weekend - so I’m happy.”Talking further about the Tokyo race, he added, “There’s not a huge amount I could have done, there was quite a long time when I was forced to lead which was obviously not ideal, and then when me and Pascal [Wehrlein] went to take Attack Mode, Oli [Rowland] got in between us. I don’t know what more we could have done from our side really, just different strategies and it didn’t quite work out for P1 or P2, but ‘Driver of the Day’, I’ll take that - I thought everyone hated me!

More Than a Team: The Rise of CSK & the Whistle Podu Army

PARIS: Roland Garros 2025 didn’t get off to the brightest of starts weather-wise. The sky was overcast and a persistent drizzle was a damper. The mistral, blowing across the grounds, was stiff and sharp, forcing fans to layer-up.The matches on Court Philippe Chatrier, the tiered show court of this sprawling venue, however, got off to a roar under the roof.World No.1 Aryna Sabalenka in a crisp peppermint onepiece, with strategic cut-off at the back, put the spark in the schedule with a rapid-fire performance against Russian Kamilla Rakhimova.The Belarussian, who claimed 12 of the 13 games played in the first-round match, in a major where she is yet to make it past the semifinals, picked clay as the surface that forced her to work the hardest. The 27-year-old didn’t sweat in the 60-minute workout in which she slammed 30 winners, using the chalked lines for target practice.China’s Qinwen Zheng, the eighth seed, who followed the world No.1 on court, shut out the tricky Russian Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova 6-4, 6-3 in 83 minutes. Sabalenka, whose USP is her supreme ability to blow out opposition, noted that power alone couldn’t win her the day on red clay.“Sometimes you have to build the point three or four times in one point, so you have to physically be ready, mentally be ready,” she said.“You have to have variety in the game to be able to compete on clay court. Physically and mentally, clay court makes me work really hard.”Sabalenka, who made the semi-finals here two years ago, then last year lost in the quarterfinals when she was laid low by a stomach bug, leans on Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu to build her core. “The Jiu-Jitsu (teaches you) to have control over your body,” she said. “We use a lot of exercises from JiuJitsu for the core when we do fitness, also for control over the body. My trainer brought a lot of stuff from Jiu-Jitsu to my training sessions. ”Sabalenka, who is coming into her second successive Grand Slam as the world No.1, said she enjoys the pressure of leading the pack.“I take it as a challenge if someone is chasing me or that there is a target on my back,” she said. “Every time I go out there, I feel let’s go. Let’s see who is ready for the pressure moments. It helps me stay in the moment and to fight, no matter what.”","Aryna Sabalenka beats Russia's Kamilla Rakhimova 6-4, 6-3.

Rafael Nadal stepped out into Court Philippe-Chatrier on Sunday to the sort of unending adulation, thunderous applause and chants of his nickname, “Rafa,” that greeted him for years as he accumulated a record 14 French Open championships, only this time he was being honored at a farewell ceremony.Thousands of spectators gave Nadal, who retired last year, a standing ovation as he strode through the doorway that leads from the locker room to the playing surface he ruled like no one ever has in the history of tennis. Instead of that familiar headband or the tape on his fingers or the capri pants he made famous early in his career, Nadal was wearing a dark suit and dark dress shirt.He smiled broadly and waved at the crowd, which seemed to occupy just about every seat in the 15,000-capacity venue.As a highlight video — showing those lefty bullwhip forehands, those pumped fists accompanying shouts of “Vamos!” and the relentless racing to every inch of the court — began playing on the screens, Nadal bit his lower lip and appeared on the verge of tears. Later, his voice cracked and he sniffled while delivering a speech of thanks in French, then English, and then his native Spanish.“This is tough,"" he began, in French.""Good evening, everyone. I don’t know where to start after playing on this court for the past 20 years. Winning, losing — but especially being moved every time I’ve had the chance to be here.”Mostly winning, of course: His career record at the French Open was 112-4. That's why a larger-than-life steel statue of Nadal was installed outside Chatrier while he was still an active player.That includes 14-0 in finals at the event, which always were held in Chatrier, which he called “without a doubt, the most important court of my tennis career.”Nadal, who turns 39 on June 3, thanked tournament organizers. His coaches. Other members of his entourage. His parents. His wife, who stood in the front row behind one of the baselines, holding their 2-year-old son. And his greatest rivals — Roger Federer Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray — who all walked out together to join Nadal on the court and hug him.Nadal's speech occasionally was interrupted by roars from those in attendance.They received T-shirts matching the rust color of the clay on the court below, with “MERCI RAFA” in white, capital letters and Sunday’s date stamped on the front.

World No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka began her French Open campaign with a dominant 6-1, 6-0 win over Russia’s Kamilla Rakhimova on Sunday. The Belarusian needed just an hour to book her place in the second round at Roland Garros.Sabalenka, who is aiming for her first title in Paris, struck 30 winners and broke her opponent five times. With defending champion Iga Swiatek struggling for form, Sabalenka has emerged as one of the favourites for the title.However, the 27-year-old admitted she was “confused” by the different line-calling systems being used in tennis.“Honestly, I’m so confused. I don’t know which I prefer anymore,” said Sabalenka, referring to her recent experiences with both traditional line judges and electronic calls. Roland Garros remains the only Grand Slam to still use line judges.She will face either Switzerland’s Jil Teichmann or Italian qualifier Lucrezia Stefanini in the next round.In other women’s singles matches, Ukraine’s Elina Svitolina breezed past Turkey’s Zeynep Sonmez 6-1, 6-1 in just over an hour. The 13th seed, a four-time quarter-finalist in Paris, was in complete control from start to finish.Quiz: Who's that IPL player? China’s Olympic gold medallist Zheng Qinwen also moved into the second round with a 6-4, 6-3 win over former finalist Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova.The eighth seed will face either Alexandra Eala of the Philippines or Colombia’s Emiliana Arango next.Meanwhile, Roland Garros is preparing for an emotional tribute to Rafael Nadal , who will be honoured in a special ceremony on Sunday. The 14-time French Open champion retired last year after the Davis Cup Finals in Malaga.Nadal, who holds a record 112-4 win-loss record at the tournament, will return to Court Philippe Chatrier one year after his final match in Paris.

Poll Do you believe Rafael Nadal's absence will change the outcome of the men's singles tournament? Yes, it opens up the competition. No, the favorites remain strong.

For many years, the French Open had a predictability attached to it. For better or for worse, Rafael Nadal in the men’s field and Iga Swiatek in the women’s field were the safe bets. Both had stellar records to justify that billing. Nadal won 14 titles at Roland Garros (2005-2008; 2010-2014; 2017-2020; 2022) while Swiatek triumphed four years in a row (2020, 2022, 2023 and 2024). The Spaniard has dominated the red clay more than any one in the history of the sport and a 112-4 record is a clear indication of it. Still not convinced? The 14 times he reached the final, he won them all.Swiatek’s reign in women's singles has been for a shorter time period and yet has been equally impressive with four titles in five years, including the last three. Among the active players, she has the best win percentage at Roland Garros (35-2; 94.6%) and she triumphed in 2020 without dropping a set.Now, as the French Open begins on Sunday, May 25, there are no crystal clear favourites as before. 38-year-old Nadal has retired and will be on Philippe Chatrier Court only for a farewell ceremony on Sunday. He bowed out last year with his injury-hampered body not co-operating to the grind of the sport anymore. His final French Open appearance was a defeat to Alexander Zverev and Roland Garros adieu came a few weeks later at the Paris Olympics, losing to Novak Djokovic in singles, followed by doubles alongside Carlos Alcaraz.“There’s ... 20 different people that you wouldn’t be surprised if they end up winning the tournament,” said USA’s Madison Keys, whose first major trophy came at the Australian Open in January. “Part of it is because we’ve kind of lost some of our legends, obviously. Like, there’s no longer Serena Williams in every draw, where you just assume she’s going to win.""Poland’s Swiatek took over that mantle from Serena, at least in Paris, for the past five years. That cannot be said this time around.Ever since clinching the title last year, she’s not reached a final let alone win a tournament. The fifth seed has had a less than flattering clay court swing in preparation. She lost in the quarterfinals of Stuttgart, was hammered with a double breadstick by Coco Gauff in Madrid and an equally dismal show against Danielle Collins in Rome.Off the court, Swiatek has had an equally trying time. In a doping case, Swiatek was essentially cleared but did serve an oddly timed suspension.That brings us to the ‘D’ word which has gripped the sport more than on-court tennis. Swiatek now down to World No. 5 - trailing Aryna Sabalenka, Gauff, Jessica Pegula and Jasmine Paolini - and men’s World No. 1 Jannik Sinner have both been punished in different and equally peculiar ways. The Italian served a three-month ban earlier this year despite being cleared of wrongdoing by the sport’s governing body.After winning the Australian Open, Sinner reached a deal with the World Anti-Doping Agency, which appealed against the 23-year-old’s exoneration. It meant he won his third major title in Melbourne, went into a three-month hiatus, only to return for the Italian Open in Rome where he finished runner-up to Carlos Alcaraz.Alcaraz was asked about the complexity of the doping world, taking Max Purcell’s ban as an example, which he said “sounded like Chinese”. But what doesn’t sound like a foreign language is the desire to win a fifth major and second in a row in Paris. His muscle issues in both legs seemed to have become a thing of the past if the Rome final was any indication. Yet, despite his similarities and wish to pick up the mantle from Nadal, he is not a lock-in like his idol.That brings us to other contenders such as three-time major finalist Alexander Zverev, including making the last-four at Roland Garros in the last four straight editions. The inconsistent German’s best showing in the tune-up events was the title in Munich.Speaking of titles, Novak Djokovic, seeking his 25th major once again, clinched his 100th ATP trophy in Geneva, joining a list that is led by Jimmy Connors and Roger Federer. His first title since winning the gold medal at the Paris Olympics last year only faintly masks his three-match losing streak before it.“Kind of [a] new reality for me, I have to say. You know, trying to win a match or two, not really thinking about getting far in the tournament. It’s a completely different feeling from what I had in 20-plus years of professional tennis, so it’s kind of a challenge for me, mentally, to really face these kinds of sensations on the court, going out early now, regularly,” Djokovic said after an opening exit in Madrid.“But that’s, I guess, the circle of life and the career. Eventually, it was going to happen. ... Grand Slams is where I really want to play the best tennis,” he added. “I’m not sure if I’ll be able to do that in Roland-Garros, but I’ll do my best.”On the women’s side, the field is open amid Swiatek’s unprecedented slump. The variety of tune-up champions tells the story - Jessica Pegula (Charleston), Jelena Ostapenko (Stuttgart), Aryna Sabalenka (Madrid) and Jasmine Paolini (Rome). Paolini became the eighth different player to reach a WTA 1000 final this season before pocketing her biggest career title.Sabalenka briefly dropped off from her best form after a surprise Australian Open final loss to Madison Keys before bouncing back with the Miami and Madrid Open titles.""I got really hungry and angry -- angry in a good way and I think at the end, the Australian Open final pushed me to work even harder,"" she told the WTA.""(It) kind of explained to me that you have to really work hard in finals and you have to earn your victories. It was a good push for me.""Coco Gauff's first final appearances in Madrid and Rome have helped her return to a career-high of World No. 2, giving her the second seeding for Paris. The 21-year-old, a former Roland Garros runner-up, is waiting for her first title since last year's WTA Finals.""Hopefully I can get to the final in Roland Garros and maybe the 'Third time lucky' thing is a real thing,"" Gauff said after losing to Paolini in Rome.There are multiple dark horses on the WTA Tour to clinch their maiden Grand Slam title, none more impressive than Mirra Andreeva.In February, she made history as the youngest-ever WTA 1000 champion in Dubai, then followed it up with an even more remarkable victory at Indian Wells.Now 18, Andreeva is a strong contender in Paris, aspiring to become the youngest Grand Slam singles champion since Maria Sharapova at Wimbledon in 2004. She showcased her credentials on clay by reaching the Roland Garros semi-finals last year and the quarter-finals in Madrid and Rome this season.Another one to be careful of is China’s 22-year-old Zheng Qinwen who will be hoping to replicate the form that took her to Olympic gold at Roland Garros last summer.",Rafael Nadal has retired from the men's singles at the French Open. The Spaniard won 14 titles at Roland Garros between 2005-2008 and 2010-2014. Iga Swiatek won the women's title four years in a row between 2020 and 2024.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121386107,imgsize-45308,width-400,resizemode-4/121386107.jpg"

Shubman Gill story: From a remote village near the border to India’s Test captain

“

India Test squad for England tour: Shubman Gill to lead, Rishabh Pant his deputy





Dubai: In the spring of 2021, an 18-year-old qualifier, flaunting muscular arms in a navy tank, sparked Rafael Nadal vibes at Roland Garros. Some four year later, for the first French Open after Nadal’s retirement from the sport, Carlos Alcaraz strides into the Avenue Gordon-Bennett venue as defending champion, also displaying some of the legendary Spaniard’s compulsive obsessiveness when arranging bottles around his courtside seat.There will be versions of Nadal – shoulder-length tresses, knickerbocker shorts, cut-off tees and fashion statement bandanas charging across this ochre-soaked landscape – in the years to come. But another Nadal? Like the one that burst onto tennis consciousness 20-years-ago in acid green cut-offs to claim the first of his 14 Coupe des Mousquetaires trophies on his tournament debut…. there is but one Eiffel Tower.Iga Swiatek, the four-time Roland Garros champion, who is on her shakiest run on the surface since she first triumphed here in 2020, comes into the second major of the year without a tournament win in the first five months of the season.The Pole, who strikes a Nadalesque forehand (using a western grip in contrast to Nadal's semi-western) is a huge admirer of. Swiatek was in the stands when Nadal rallied from a two-set deficit to claim his 21major title at the Australian Open three years ago.It was really inspiring,” Swiatek said then of the Melbourne Park final, where Daniil Medvedev had the veteran Nadal in wraps early in the match. “I thought it's going to be pretty hard for Rafa to get the score around. I was thinking during the match that if he's going to win it's going to be mind-blowing, he's going to show why he's Rafa, why he won so many Grand Slams.”Nadal’s nerve is perhaps what Swiatek will look to replicate as she kicks off her seventh French Open campaign, where on Sunday, the opening day of the clay court fortnight, a ceremony in honour of Nadal will play out on Court Philippe Chatrier.Quiz: Who's that IPL player? “I really want to watch it,” Swiatek said of the ceremony, “For sure I'm going to cry. We should all kind of get together and celebrate Rafa and what he did for our sport, what kind of inspiration he was and still is.”World No.1 Jannik Sinner reeled off Nadal’s strengths on the surface like a school boy reciting mathematical tables he had painstakingly drilled into his head – court coverage, court position, spin, physical shape…“He deserves an amazing ceremony, not only because of the player he is, but also how he behaved on court. Being humble and being a successful tennis player, he showed that this is possible,” the 23-year-old Italian said. “I was lucky to know him a little bit better. He's exactly how you guys see him. He's not faking anything. A role model for all of us.”British world No.5 Jack Draper, who like Nadal, plays tennis with his left hand, but writes with his right hand, has carved a solidity into his two-handed backhand, where the right hand steers the stroke.“Obviously (when) playing a righty, we're able to get it into their backhands more,” Draper said of the strategy Nadal employed against Roger Federer. “For me my biggest strength is probably the fact that I’m naturally right-handed. My backhand is a shot which I've always been really confident on. So when right-handers go to my backhand it feels like a great shot for me.”On these picturesque courts, there will be shades of Nadal in the next couple of weeks and beyond --- the spin, the technique, the forehand and the fire -- but that indefatigable spirit -- the 22-time major winner’s shot that made the impossible possible is his signature. Unalloyed steel.","Rafael Nadal will be honoured at the French Open on Sunday. The 22-time major winner retired from tennis at the end of last season. Nadal is a huge admirer of Iga Swiatek, who is on her shakiest run on the surface.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121389781,imgsize-14520,width-400,resizemode-4/121389781.jpg"

Former world number one Naomi Osaka is preparing for her French Open campaign at Roland Garros, expressing optimism about her tennis comeback after returning to the world's top 50. The four-time Grand Slam champion, who took a break in 2023 for the birth of her daughter, has shown promising signs of form in 2024, including a near-victory against eventual winner Iga Swiatek.Osaka secured her first tournament victory since the 2021 Australian Open at a second-tier Challenger event in Saint-Malo this month. She has also made significant progress in major competitions, advancing to the last 16 at both the Miami and Italian Opens.""I think I'm enjoying the time more. I'm enjoying seeing the newer players coming up. I don't know. Feels like the circle of life a little bit,"" Osaka said at Roland Garros on Saturday.""I think for me I know that I came back and I'm choosing to spend this time away from my daughter in order to attempt to achieve things, so I have to make the most out of that time. Coming here or playing any tournament without a positive mentality would just be pointless.""The Japanese star, who has been open about her struggles with depression and mental health, addressed her decision to compete in the Saint-Malo Challenger event.""I think the decision itself was kind of difficult, because in your mind, you do have a little bit of pride. There was a lot of pressure. I wouldn't really say it was to not lose, but it was more like I had in the back of my head, 'I wonder what people would say about me if I lost here'. Granted, I should never be thinking about that when I'm playing a tennis match... But I got over it.""Quiz: Who's that IPL player? Osaka's French Open preparations faced an early challenge with a 5:00 am anti-doping test on Saturday. She shared her experience with the unexpected wake-up call.""Today was kind of scary, because the last year I was here they also came at 5:00 am, and the lady couldn't find my veins at all. I had huge bruises on my arms for a while. Thankfully it wasn't the same lady. No shade to her.""The 27-year-old player will face Spanish 10th seed Paula Badosa in the first round. She has never progressed beyond the third round at the French Open.""It's kind of crazy that we have both been on tour but we haven't played each other yet. I think I'm going to be nervous because it is the first round, and I'm always nervous in the first round. Hopefully they'll put us on a really good court.""Osaka revealed her excitement about wearing flower-inspired outfits at Roland Garros, including cherry blossom-themed shoes.""I'm really excited about the kit, because I designed it. I don't know if you can see from all the way over here, but I did my nails and they're sakura-themed too.""The match against Badosa is scheduled for either Monday or Tuesday at Roland Garros.",Naomi Osaka is preparing for her French Open campaign at Roland Garros.

India Test squad for England tour: Shubman Gill to lead, Rishabh Pant his deputy

Shubman Gill story: From a remote village near the border to India’s Test captain

Paris: Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz, the two best male tennis players in the world, both born in the 2000s, have been shaping for a rivalry that pits great contrasts -- styles, mentalities and personalities -- across the net.The 23-year-old Italian’s steel versus the 22-year-old Spaniard’s staggering range, the world No.1’s sangfroid versus Alcaraz’s sense of adventure. The calm and storm of the sport, are the top-two seeds of the French Open , starting Sunday. They are the youngest top two seeds at a major since the 2006 US Open, when a 25-year-old Roger Federer and a 20-year-old Rafael Nadal bookended the men’s draw.On a windy Friday at Roland Garros, where the highs hovered around the late teens on the centigrade scale, Sinner and Alcaraz’ paths crossed on Court Philippe Chatrier where they both had practice sessions scheduled in the afternoon. The 22-year-old Spaniard was winding up when Sinner walked in behind his coach Aussie Darren Cahill. The top-seed went over to Alcaraz’ side and waited for him, who owns a Tour-leading 30 match wins in 2025, to finish an exchange, before throwing an arm around him.The rivalry, which kickstarted in the November of 2021with the world still reeling from the effects of Covid-19, seemed to have it all. Shades of Rafael Nadal-Roger Federer all over again, they were friendly but their matches were fierce, they were different yet united by a passion, but there may be more.A pair of personable young men, leaders of their sport, might be caught in a crossfire of the unspoken word.Alcaraz, who won the pairs’ last meeting in the final at Rome last weekend, bringing to an end Sinner’s 26-match win streak, leads the head-to-head 7-4, while tying with the world No.1 at 19 titles apiece.Sinner, who returned to competition after serving a three-month ban for returning positive tests for Clostebol, a banned anabolic steroid, held forth on the three months, saying that there had been players in the time, who he didn’t expect had reached out to him, while there were others, who he was expecting to hear from, who hadn’t reached out.Alcaraz was asked if he thought Sinner was referring to him.“I didn't call him in those three months, but it wasn't about if I agreed or not (with the ban),’ Alcaraz said. ‘I was playing, I was in my feelings.’Quiz: Who's that IPL player? The telephone call that wasn’t made aside, Sinner and Alcaraz agree they bring more to the court when they face each other.“When we play there is a little extra attention,” said Sinner. “While he is winning I feel that my practice sessions are getting more intense.”“I'm even more focused when I play against him,” the gifted four-time major winner said. “I feel a little bit different when I'm going to face him. Jannik has that aura. When you see him at the other side of the net, it's kind of different. I feel like it is a different energy when we face each other than when we face other players.”If the rivalry were to be renewed at Roland Garros, Sinner must survive a thorny path. The world No.1 opens against Frenchman Arthur Rinderknech and could play the 14-seeded Frenchman Arthur Fils or Andrey Rublev in the fourth round, Jack Draper or Alex de Minaur in the last eight and maybe Alexander Zverev or the 24-time major winner Novak Djokovic in the semis.Alcaraz starts against veteran Japanese Kei Nishikori and could run into giant Frenchman Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard in the third round, and Ben Shelton or Stefanos Tsitsipas in the fourth-round, possibly Casper Ruud in the quarterfinals and maybe Taylor Fritz, Lorenzo Musetti or Holger Rune in the semi-finals.The road to the final is long and the weather promises to be whimsical, but fans in the French capital will hope the final will be a rematch of last year’s semi-final, which the Spaniard won.“It’s great to have matchups that make (fans) excited. It was Borg-McEnroe, Rafa-Roger or Djokovic, the big three against each other,” the defending champion said of rivalries. “Right now people are excited every time I'm facing Jannik. Our matches are really high quality. People probably who don't like watching tennis, started to watch tennis (because of these matches).”For now, Roland Garros would like another, a 12career meeting of the two best Generation Z players, who are looking to make history.",Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner are the top-two seeds at the French Open. They are the youngest top two seeds at a major since the 2006 US Open. Sinner returned to competition after serving a three-month ban for returning positive tests for Clostebol.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121373546,imgsize-132838,width-400,resizemode-4/121373546.jpg"

Poll Do you think Coco Gauff will perform better at this year's French Open compared to her past finals? Yes, she has gained valuable experience. No, past disappointments may hinder her.

American tennis player Coco Gauff, 21, is looking to transform her recent runner-up disappointments in Madrid and Rome clay tournaments into motivation for the upcoming French Open in Paris, where she previously reached the finals in 2022 and won the doubles title last year.Gauff enters the French Open following consecutive finals losses to world number one Aryna Sabalenka and Italy's Jasmine Paolini in Roland Garros warm-up tournaments.The 2018 French Open junior champion will face 93rd-ranked Australian Olivia Gadecki in her opening match on the red clay surface.Reflecting on her 2022 French Open final loss to Iga Swiatek, Gauff said: ""I think immediately after it was a tough feeling for me. I just felt like maybe I could never overcome that. Then I just turned it into motivation. I knew that, I don't know, just had a deep-down gut (feeling) that I was going to be in a final position again. I was like, I'm not going to go out like that. If I go out, I'm going to leave with my head held high. So I was able to approach that US Open final differently. But I definitely think I needed that finals loss to reach this point, for sure.""Gauff went on to win the US Open title a year after her French Open final appearance.Speaking about her comfort level on clay courts, Gauff said: ""Honestly, I feel like when I was young, I just played on it. I feel like at that time I didn't gauge surfaces or anything. I felt like I should just be good at everything. I definitely think it's something that I'm comfortable on. I mainly credit it to me probably sliding a lot on a hard court so when I go on clay it just feels a lot easier.""Her recent clay court performances have boosted her confidence heading into Roland Garros.Regarding her clay season results, Gauff stated: ""It definitely gives me a lot of confidence, but I think I'm just putting those results in the past and focusing on the next two weeks here.""Last year, Gauff claimed the Roland Garros doubles title partnering with Katerina Siniakova, further cementing her credentials on the clay surface.","American tennis player Coco Gauff, 21, is looking to transform her recent runner-up disappointments in Madrid and Rome clay tournaments into motivation for the upcoming French Open in Paris.

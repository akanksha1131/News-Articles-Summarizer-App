After getting attention from the physios and ice packs, Pant had limped off the session.A day later, Pant got off the team bus comfortably and interacted with fans, signing autographs. He was, however, cautious during fielding drills, avoiding high catches and opting for shadow batting on the sidelines.","India bowling coach Morne Morkel is likely to leave from Dubai, if not already, due to a personal emergency back home.

Rishabh Pant faces injury scare as Team India begins Champions Trophy training

NEW DELHI: A social media controversy was triggered after a video of Karachi’s National Stadium surfaced, showing flags of participating nations playing in the upcoming ICC Champions Trophy 2025 , which is scheduled to be hosted by Pakistan and the UAE from February 19.The video shows that the Indian flag was seemingly 'missing' at the stadium, stirring up controversy and heated debate.

NEW DELHI: Mumbai Indians (MI) owner Nita Ambani recalled the remarkable journey of Hardik Pandya , from his early struggles to becoming the captain of the five-time IPL champions. Speaking about her first encounter with Hardik and his brother Krunal Pandya over a decade ago, she highlighted how MI’s scouting system identified and nurtured raw talent.""In the IPL, we all have a fixed budget, so every team can spend a set amount of money. We had to think about new ways of getting talent. So I remember scouting for talent, and I used to go to every Ranji Trophy match. My scouts and I would visit domestic cricket matches, and one day, our scouts took two young, lanky, thin boys to the camp,"" Nita Ambani said.She recalled a conversation with the Pandya brothers that revealed their financial hardships before making it big in cricket. ""I was talking to them, and they said that for three years, they had eaten nothing but Maggi noodles because they had no money. But in them, I saw the spirit, the passion, and the hunger to make it big. Those two brothers were Hardik Pandya and Krunal Pandya. In 2015, I bought Hardik Pandya for 10,000 US dollars in the auction, and today, he is the proud captain of Mumbai Indians.""Hardik made his MI debut in 2015, and the following year, he earned his India cap. Over the years, he became an integral part of the Indian cricket team, known for his explosive batting, all-round capabilities, and leadership skills.Nita Ambani also recalled MI’s discovery of Jasprit Bumrah , who has since become one of the world's premier fast bowlers. ""Our scouts found a young cricketer with an odd body language, and they said, 'watch him bowl.' We watched him, and he could just speak to the ball. That was our Bumrah, and the rest is history.""She further emphasised MI’s commitment to developing young talent, citing the rise of Tilak Varma , who recently broke into the Indian team. ""Recently, we launched Tilak Varma, and now he is a proud member of Team India,"" she added.Hardik Pandya’s journey exemplifies the Mumbai Indians’ ethos of identifying and backing young players with potential, turning them into world-class cricketers.","Mumbai Indians owner Nita Ambani recalls the remarkable journey of Hardik Pandya.

When you look at his previous records, you will see what he did for the country. I believe that he will be performing like the champion player he always has been.""During the recent ODI series against England, Virat participated in two matches.

The team is very strong.""Discussing Jasprit Bumrah 's absence from the tournament due to a back injury, coach Rajkumar indicated that India would feel the loss of his crucial early wickets and death over expertise.

Australian cricket star Steve Smith has expressed confidence that spinner Matt Kuhnemann will pass all tests on his bowling action, stating he was ""surprised"" when told the left-armer had been reported.Kuhnemann is set to undergo biomechanical testing within the next 10 days after match officials raised concerns about his action during the second Test against Sri Lanka. Despite this, Smith remains optimistic about the outcome.""It's come as a bit of a surprise to me,"" Smith said. ""He has been playing for eight years in professional cricket and nothing has been said in that amount of time. I am thinking of him, at present, he has to go through the process. We're confident he will pass. He will go through that process back home, we wish him all the best.""Australian officials have been reserved about the specifics of Kuhnemann’s assessment, but it is expected to take place in Brisbane. The 28-year-old will undergo hours of testing, with markers attached to his arm and cameras monitoring whether his elbow extension stays within the ICC’s permitted 15-degree limit.Despite the report, Kuhnemann is still eligible to play domestic cricket and is set to feature for Tasmania in the Sheffield Shield. However, ICC rules prohibit him from participating in international matches until he is cleared.The decision to flag Kuhnemann’s action has left Australian players and officials puzzled, given that he has played 124 professional matches since 2017 without any prior concerns. The left-arm spinner has previously represented Australia in ODIs against Sri Lanka in 2022 and in Tests against India in 2023, before starring with 16 wickets at 17.18 in the recent Test series win in Galle.Smith revealed that he only learned of Kuhnemann being cited after Australia’s series-clinching win in Galle and did not notice anything unusual in the spinner’s action.Sri Lankan players had reportedly raised concerns about Kuhnemann’s action during the series, prompting umpires to refer him to the ICC. However, Sri Lanka's spin bowling coach, Piyal Wijetunge, defended Kuhnemann, suggesting that the doubts arose due to his distinctive wrist action rather than any illegal movement.If Kuhnemann's action is deemed illegal, he will face a tight deadline to rectify it before Australia's three-Test series against the West Indies in June and July. His availability will also be crucial for Australia's 2027 tour of India, where his left-arm spin could play a key role alongside Nathan Lyon","Matt Kuhnemann set to undergo biomechanical testing within the next 10 days.

NEW DELHI: Former India spinner Harbhajan Singh has dismissed the hype around the much-anticipated India-Pakistan clash in the upcoming ICC Champions Trophy , calling it an ""overhyped game"" and predicting that India will dominate their arch-rivals in Dubai on February 23. India, placed in Group A, will face co-hosts Pakistan in their second match of the tournament, which begins on February 19.Harbhajan, speaking on his YouTube channel, pointed to India's superior squad strength and Pakistan’s recent inconsistency to support his claim that the game is unlikely to be competitive. ""This India-Pakistan game is an overhyped game because there is nothing in it. India is a very strong team. Pakistan recently lost against New Zealand while playing at home. Pakistan is a very inconsistent team, and if you look at their statistics and compare them with Indian batsmen and bowlers, you will get a clear picture,"" he stated.While acknowledging that past performances do not guarantee future results, Harbhajan reiterated his stance that India are far superior. ""When I look at both teams, the difference is very high. India's team looks too strong. Pakistan’s team appears weak apart from Babar [Azam] and [Mohammad] Rizwan. If we talk about Babar and Rizwan, then apart from them, no other batsman stands out. Their bowling unit is also not in form.""Harbhajan, however, identified Fakhar Zaman as a key player for Pakistan who could pose a threat to India. ""I have taken out some statistics. Their main batsman, Babar, has an average of 31 against India. A top batsman should have an average around 50. Rizwan has an average of 25 against India. Fakhar is the only opener who has a solid average of 46. He can take the game away from India. But beyond that, their batting does not inspire confidence. Faheem Ashraf’s average is 12.5, and Saud Shakeel’s is just six against India. When I look at that batting lineup, I do not feel confident that this team can fight against India.""The former cricketer also pointed out that most of India's key players are in strong form ahead of the tournament. ""India is very strong. Rohit [Sharma] has just scored runs, [Shubman] Gill has scored runs, Axar Patel is in form. [Virat] Kohli recently scored a fifty. Although he is not in the form we are used to seeing, I believe he will succeed because he always performs in big tournaments. KL Rahul’s form is also good.""Harbhajan further compared the teams’ recent performances, emphasising that India’s bowling attack is in good rhythm. ""If we look at our bowlers, their form is good. We recently defeated England in a home series, while Pakistan lost to New Zealand at home. New Zealand will play Pakistan in their opening match, and I think New Zealand will defeat them once again because they know how to bat first and set a strong total. Pakistan won an ODI series in Australia, which should have given them confidence, but they have not looked different since. Rizwan’s captaincy is good, his intent is good, but maybe the players they have are not strong enough. Babar has not scored runs, and although Rizwan and Salman Agha have hit centuries here and there, the team does not inspire confidence. Even in Pakistan, their former players say that India is far ahead.""He also touched on the high ticket prices for the match, suggesting that fans may not get the competitive encounter they expect. ""The prices of tickets have increased a lot, but I don't think the game will be as exciting as people are expecting. In this overhyped game on February 23, I think it will be a one-sided game.""Looking beyond the marquee clash, Harbhajan expressed his belief that India are strong contenders to win the tournament and also praised Afghanistan as a potential dark horse. ""India is far ahead in this match-up and is a very capable team that can win this Champions Trophy. The other team I think will play very well in this tournament is Afghanistan, as they will thrive in these conditions.""India will be aiming to capture their third Champions Trophy title, while Pakistan, the defending champions from the 2017 edition, will look to prove their critics wrong. However, according to Harbhajan Singh, the gap between the two teams is simply too large for an upset to happen.","Harbhajan Singh has dismissed the hype around the much-anticipated India- Pakistan clash in the upcoming ICC Champions Trophy.

Feel of the ball

Mission Champions Trophy gets underway as Team India lands in Dubai

Arshdeep's zen mode

About fifteen minutes before the team bus was parked outside the ICC Academy in Dubai, Virat Kohli went to the local manager and made some requests. The manager patiently heard the star batter and walked to the main entrance. When he returned, there was a big paper bag from a popular food joint which had few boxes of Kohli's post-session meal. While the others packed their kit bags after more than three hours of intense training, Kohli was refueling and even saved a box for the road.It was the Indian cricket team's first hit ahead of the Champions Trophy and the side hit the ground less than 12 hours after landing in Dubai on February 15. The session started with a unique drill where a tennis ball was hit way up into the air and a player, with the helmet on, had to rebound it off his head and one of the surrounding fielders were waiting to catch it to earn a point. Some points and lots of fun and games later, serious business got underway.Kohli was one of the first batters to scratch the popping crease and he had Rohit Sharma and Hardik Pandya for company in the adjacent nets. One had just throwdowns, the other featured quicks Arshdeep Singh and Mohammed Shami while the corner-most was the spin net with Ravindra Jadeja, Axar Patel and Kuldeep Yadav bowling. Pandya went bang-bang and Shreyas Iyer continued with similar approach as fireworks were underway when the two were batting. ""Watch the ball, watch it, ball incoming,"" the support staff kept screaming warnings for the security personnel and media near the ropes as the big hits didn't stop.The adjacent nets were quiet on that front as both Kohli and Rohit were happy to get a feel of the ball. There weren't many deliveries in that outside-off channel to Kohli as the right-hander was mostly fed the stump line. Some creaming flicks, on-drives and lofted drives later, he grew in confidence and even showcased his range off the back-foot. The crisp pulls and slashes square off the wicket were on display as he batted for close to an hour. Similarly, Rohit was happy to feel the middle of the blade and was even tested on a few occasions by Arshdeep Singh's incoming deliveries and the occasional yorker.Throughout the session, the intensity from both the batters and bowlers didn't drop an inch as Arshdeep and Shami bowled for close to an hour at full tilt, and the batters were at it even while taking turns on different surfaces. Head coach Gautam Gambhir was stationed right behind the nets as action unfolded and there was a moment of concern in the afternoon when Rishabh Pant was doing his wicketkeeping drills. Pandya slash hit Pant on the left knee and he was down on the ground the next moment.The physios and medical team rushed to give him immediate attention as he grimaced in pain. It was the same knee which received a lot of damage during the horrific accident few years back and immediate ice treatment was necessitated by the blow with Pant flat on the ground. Some time later, he was up on his feet and limped towards the rope before he was interrupted by Pandya who checked on him and gave a hug. After some more treatment, Pant had his knee heavily strapped.All this while, Pant continued to smile and to everyone's surprise started padding up for a hit. He limped to the nets but that didn't affect his big hitting. The left-hander batted without any visible discomfort but he was limped when he made his way back to the change room. The limping continued when he boarded the team bus as well but the smile never left his face. Pant as usual!Something unusual, however, happened towards the end of the session as Arshdeep, after a really long spell, switched to zen mode when he took a book out and started reading. Others around him continued to be chatty and noisy but the youngster was so engrossed in his book that he only left the chair when the manager signalled the players to start walking to the bus.On expected lines, a massive crowd had assembled to catch a glimpse of their favourite stars and Kohli had to momentarily ditch his food box to sign autographs for the waiting fans who created a buzzing atmosphere before the team could finally make their way back to the hotel.","Team India hit the ground less than 12 hours after landing in Dubai on February 15.

Balaji underlined the importance of a strong start with the new ball.""I think it's very important. If India has to do well, then Shami has to come good with the new ball. The kind of impact he can make in his first six overs with the new ball will play a crucial role for India. The old ball is anyway... it is a defensive game now. If he can make early inroads regularly, that will give a huge booster to India,"" he added.Concerns have been raised over Shami's rhythm following his ankle injury, but Balaji expressed confidence in his ability to regain his optimal bowling speed.""Since that (ankle) injury has happened, there was a little bit of slowness, maybe. It's natural. But there is nothing you can do about it. It's part of any sportsperson's career. He has the experience to get over it, and he will do it as he bowls more. It's just about accepting the (physical) condition and continuing his best practices,"" he said.Shami's role in the tournament will extend beyond taking wickets, as he will also have to mentor younger pacers like Arshdeep Singh and Harshit Rana . Balaji emphasised that Shami's extensive experience makes him an ideal leader.""Shami is the leader of the pack right now. I mean, he has been the leader of the pack for a long time now. If you see what Shami has done in 12 years of cricket and, especially, in Test cricket, it has been humongous. Now, if he starts striking with the new ball, the confidence it gives to other bowlers will be huge,"" he said.Dubai, where India will play their matches, has historically provided some assistance to pacers. Balaji feels this could work in Shami's favour.""He keeps attacking the stumps, a quality that is very critical in a place like Dubai, where batsmen may get a little bit more assistance,"" said Balaji.Elaborating on Shami's effectiveness with the new ball, Balaji pointed out the key strengths that make him a formidable bowler.""Shami has one of the best wrist positions in the game, helping him bring all of his variations. See, conditions in Dubai will more or less be similar to India, so he just needs to follow his methods there,"" he added.Balaji further explained Shami's ability to generate movement off the pitch, making him a constant threat to batters.""What Shami does is hit the seam and move the ball off the deck. It is dangerous as batsmen will not be able to guess easily which way the ball is going to move. It also brings into the equation the LBWs and clean bowled dismissals. The away movement ensures that the slip cordon too will be in the mix,"" said Balaji.""And he also bowls closer to the stumps, which allows him to explore those subtle angles. So, he will always be among the wickets,"" he added.India will begin their campaign against Bangladesh in Dubai on Thursday, with Shami expected to play a leading role in their quest for Champions Trophy glory.",Former India pacer Laxmipathy Balaji has backed Mohammed Shami to lead India's pace attack at the ICC Champions Trophy. Balaji believes Shami's experience and skill will be crucial to the team's success.

What’s the reason behind South African cricket's renaissance? SA20’s Graeme Smith answers

'Everyone played a part': Captain Rashid Khan as MI Cape Town clinch maiden SA20 title

SA20 showcasing perfect balance between bat and ball: Vernon Philander

NEW DELHI: Dinesh Karthik came in as Jos Buttler's replacement in the Paarl Royals squad ahead of the third season of the SA20 - South Africa's premier T20 competition. On January 11, he made his debut against two-time defending champions Sunrisers Eastern Cape in a milestone moment. 'DK', as he is commonly and popularly known, became the first Indian to feature in the SA20.Unlike the female players, Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ) has a strict rule on Indian players plying their trade in foreign T20 leagues. In order to retain exclusivity for the Indian Premier League (IPL), male players cannot play in T20 leagues abroad. The exception, however, is made when the player announces retirement from international cricket and the IPL.Karthik fit that bill after playing his last for Royal Challengers Bengaluru in IPL 2024. After 257 IPL matches in which he scored 4842 runs, DK decided to say goodbye for good. He decided to make a U-turn because of the competition and the lure of playing for the Royals.Now with the season wrapped up, where Paarl Royals bowed out after Qualifier 2, Karthik admits BCCI's stiff policy is for the betterment of Indian cricket and its players with enough happening at state levels as well to aid youngsters.""I'm a big believer that the IPL should be the crown jewel for BCCI. And it is, at the moment, the crown jewel in world cricket. And for that to maintain its status quo as No. 1, I believe that Indian cricketers shouldn't be allowed unless they're retired,"" he said in a conversation organised by SA20.""Because they can take the call if they feel they're done with the IPL and then move on to play other leagues. I completely stand with the BCCI on that front. I agree you can always argue saying 'Can youngsters be given an opportunity?' But I think there is enough in India in terms of competition and ways of being financially secure. And if you're good enough, IPL is a great platform. They have domestic cricket and all the state franchise leagues as well.""So I think there's a lot of cricket that's played in India. And I think cricketers from India should be allowed to play once they retire. And I believe that is the right way to go. And I think SA20, or any other league for that matter, will be more than happy to work with and to have a couple of the players who have retired from BCCI and from playing for India,"" he added.Karthik played 11 matches in the season for Paarl Royals and scored 130 runs at an average of 21.67 and strike rate of 121.50 in a season that saw scarcity of runs under tough pitches. Enough that Royals set a record of bowling their entire 20 overs against Pretoria Capitals with spinners - an aspect that brought out a chuckle from DK who compared the conditions at Boland Park to Tamil Nadu.He might not have set the scoring charts ablaze but did have a jolly time in South Africa with family in tow - especially at the 10,000 capacity Boland Park.""IPL (and SA20) had one thing in common - the fact that there were full houses for all games that I played. So Paarl is well supported, but you have to understand the numbers are very different. South Africa had packed houses, almost all the games that we played, which was very encouraging,"" he said.""Standard of cricket is very good. Obviously, with IPL, the challenges are very different. The quality in terms of how it is played over two months is very, very different to SA20.""Paarl Royals (and eventual champions MI Cape Town) went unbeaten in the league stage with five wins in five played. While MICT went all the way, Royals stumbled against the Sunrisers Eastern Cape. Yet, it was a memorable debut season for Karthik who shared the dressing room with England's Joe Root.""Playing with Joe Root was one of the highlights, I believe, for me personally, playing this tournament. I've never interacted much with him. Always seen him - said a hello, but to rub shoulders with him, be with him in the same dressing room, what a terrific personality. He's a legend of the game. Easily will go down as one of the greatest batters to have ever played this sport.""But the attitude that he brings, it's just very warm, welcoming, helps the youngsters so much. And always wants to have fun and a laugh. And wants the team to have a great time. Like we had this pushups contest after a match. And it was all started by him. It's just the energy that he brings, the genuinity that he brings towards the sport. It was wonderful playing with him. It was one of the best experiences, actually, playing with such a legend who has no hang-ups about himself. Very relaxed, very humble. It was a lot of fun,"" stated Karthik who acknowledged he would be keen on being part of the SA20 again in the future.",Dinesh Karthik is the first Indian to feature in South Africa's premier T20 competition. He played 11 matches in the season for Paarl Royals and scored 130 runs at an average of 21.67 and strike rate of 121.50.

Mission Champions Trophy gets underway as Team India lands in Dubai

Former Australian skipper Michael Clarke has backed India captain Rohit Sharma to be the leading run-scorer in the upcoming ICC Champions Trophy , which kicks off on February 19 in Karachi. India have been placed in Group A alongside Pakistan, New Zealand, and Bangladesh. The Men in Blue begin their campaign on February 20 against Bangladesh in Dubai.Rohit Sharma returned to top form during the recent three-match ODI series against England, notching up a century in the second ODI. The 37-year-old Indian captain faced significant scrutiny following a poor Test series against Australia but silenced critics with a commanding hundred.""Well, I am saying India is going to win (Champions Trophy). I am going to go with their captain, who's back in form. I am going to say Rohit Sharma — leading run scorer in the tournament,"" Clarke stated on the latest episode of Beyond23 Cricket Podcast.""It's good to see him making runs again. I think India need him for sure,"" he added.Clarke also predicted that England’s Jofra Archer would emerge as the tournament’s top wicket-taker, despite expecting England to underperform in the Champions Trophy. England are in Group B alongside Australia, South Africa, and Afghanistan.""I want to go with Jofra Archer — leading wicket-taker. I know England; I am not expecting them to do that well, but I think he's a superstar. I think Jofra is going to be really hard to play. So, I am going to have him as my leading wicket-taker,"" Clarke mentioned.The 2015 World Cup-winning captain further picked Australian opener Travis Head as the Player of the Tournament. While he expects Australia to reach the final, he does not see them lifting the trophy.""I am going to go with Travis Head (for Player of the Tournament). Travis Head has been in terrific form. His IPL form was phenomenal. Australian Test summer form was phenomenal. He has had a bit of a break in Sri Lanka. He is ready to go again. So, I am going to say Travis Head Player of the Tournament even though I think Australia might lose the final,"" Clarke concluded.","Michael Clarke has backed India captain Rohit Sharma to be the leading run- scorer in the upcoming ICC Champions Trophy.

Brief Scores

Vidarbha 308/5; 88 overs (Danish Malewar 79, Dhruv Shorey 74, Karun Nair 45; Shams Mulani 2/44, Shuvam Dube 2/35) vs Mumbai.

NEW DELHI: Danish Malewar ’s resilient 79 and Dhruv Shorey ’s stylish 74 anchored Vidarbha to 308/5 on the opening day of their Ranji Trophy semifinal against defending champions Mumbai in Nagpur on Monday.While Vidarbha’s innings lacked a massive partnership, a series of steady stands ensured they crossed the 300-run mark after facing 88 overs. Karun Nair (45) played a composed knock before falling to Shivam Dube, visibly frustrated with the caught-behind decision despite opting for DRS.Mumbai’s bowlers struggled to make inroads, conceding 13 no-balls in the day, with their frontline pacers failing to capitalise on the Jamtha track.Left-arm spinner Shams Mulani (2/44 in 18 overs) was the pick of the bowlers, extracting bounce and turn from the surface. Dube (2/35 in 9 overs) chipped in with two wickets, one courtesy of a stunning one-handed catch by Suryakumar Yadav in the slip cordon.However, Mumbai’s new-ball pair Shardul Thakur (0/57 in 14 overs) and Mohit Avasthi (0/61 in 14 overs) struggled for rhythm, failing to trouble the batters with both the new and second new ball.Vidarbha’s innings was set up by opener Dhruv Shorey, who capitalized on the erratic bowling of Avasthi and Thakur. Shorey punished half-volleys, hitting nine boundaries in his 74-run knock.His opening partner Atharva Taide (4) fell early, shouldering arms to a sharp delivery from Royston Dias. However, Shorey found a steady partner in Parth Rekhade (23), adding 54 runs for the second wicket before Dube struck just before lunch, with Suryakumar taking a sharp low catch at third slip.Malewar, Vidarbha’s breakout player of the season, took charge after lunch, dominating a 51-run stand with Shorey before the latter fell to Mulani, edging one to Ajinkya Rahane at slip.In-form Karun Nair played with confidence, using his feet well against Mulani and off-spinner Tanush Kotian. He stitched a 78-run fourth-wicket stand with Malewar, keeping Vidarbha in control.Nair’s innings, which included six boundaries, ended in controversy when Dube found the edge to keeper Akash Anand. While the on-field umpire took a moment before raising his finger, Nair reviewed the decision, only for DRS to uphold it, leaving the batter frustrated.Malewar’s 159-ball stay finally ended when he edged a forward defence to Mulani, giving keeper Anand his second catch.With Mumbai looking to restrict Vidarbha below 300, Yash Rathod (47) and skipper Akshay Wadkar (13)** played a crucial role in the final session. Their unbroken 47-run stand for the sixth wicket pushed Vidarbha past the milestone, ensuring they ended the day in a strong position.With a well-set Rathod at the crease, Vidarbha will aim to extend their total on Day 2, while Mumbai will look for early breakthroughs to claw back into the contest.","Vidarbha reach 308-5 on the opening day of their Ranji Trophy semifinal against defending champions Mumbai in Nagpur.

NEW DELHI: Veteran batter Sachin Baby stood tall for Kerala , guiding his team to 206/4 against a disciplined Gujarat bowling attack on the opening day of their Ranji Trophy semifinal in Ahmedabad on Monday.The 36-year-old southpaw anchored the innings with a patient, unbeaten 69 off 193 balls (8x4), occupying the crease for two full sessions to keep Kerala’s maiden final hopes alive.Baby found solid support in Mohammed Azharuddeen , who remained unbeaten on 30 off 66 balls (3x4) after surviving a last-ball LBW scare, with DRS overturning the decision that initially had him out off Chintan Gaja.Azharuddeen's successful DRS review denied Gujarat a crucial breakthrough before stumps, ensuring that their unbroken 49-run stand for the fifth wicket kept Kerala in the fight against a relentless seven-man Gujarat bowling attack.Despite Kerala’s resistance, Gujarat remained in the contest, restricting the scoring rate and striking at key moments. Arzan Nagwaswalla (16-4-39-1), Priyajitsing Jadeja (12-0-33-1), and leg-spinner Ravi Bishnoi (15-2-33-1) provided breakthroughs, while left-arm spinner Siddharth Desai exploited rough patches outside off-stump.Gujarat’s disciplined bowling kept Kerala’s run rate sluggish, as they took 86.3 overs to cross the 200-run mark, consuming over 470 dot balls throughout the day.With four wickets down, the first session on Day 2 will be crucial, as Gujarat looks to seize early control, while Kerala banks on Baby’s experience to push their total forward.Opting to bat first, Kerala began steadily, with Rohan Kunnummal and Akshay Chandran confidently negotiating the new ball spells of Chintan Gaja and Nagwaswalla. Their 60-run opening stand provided a solid foundation before a mix-up led to Chandran’s run-out for 30 (71 balls, 5x4).Just four overs later, Kunnummal fell LBW to Bishnoi for 30 (68 balls, 5x4) after an unsuccessful DRS review, leaving Kerala at 63/2.Varun Nayanar struggled to settle and was dismissed for 10, edging Jadeja behind, further reducing Kerala to 86/3.Baby then combined with Jalaj Saxena (35 off 91 balls, 5x4) in a cautious 71-run stand, frustrating Gujarat’s bowlers before Nagwaswalla broke through. Attempting a late cut, Saxena dragged the ball onto his stumps, departing at 157/4.Baby displayed exceptional discipline, carefully leaving deliveries in the fourth-stump channel and rarely taking risks. His patience and solid technique frustrated Gujarat, while Azharuddeen provided crucial support at the other end.Despite the second new ball being available, Gujarat opted to persist with spinners Desai and Bishnoi, surrounding the batters with close-in fielders in the final overs. They eventually took the new ball in the 86th over but failed to make inroads.With Kerala still in the game, Day 2 promises a battle of attrition as Gujarat aim for early breakthroughs while Baby looks to extend Kerala’s innings.","Sachin Baby scores unbeaten 69 as Kerala reach 206/4 on opening day of Ranji Trophy semifinal in Ahmedabad.

Special Mentions

NEW DELHI: The third season of the ILT20 concluded in thrilling fashion, with the Dubai Capitals emerging as champions after a gripping final against the Desert Vipers . While international superstars dominated the headlines, UAE’s homegrown talents made a lasting impact with standout performances throughout the tournament.A powerhouse with the bat, Muhammad Waseem once again proved his class, securing the Blue Belt (Best UAE Player) for the third straight season. Representing MI Emirates, he smashed 183 runs in 10 matches at an impressive strike rate of 132.60. Nearly half of his runs came from sixes, as he hammered 13 maximums. Adding to his all-round contribution, Waseem also showcased his sharp fielding skills, taking six catches during the tournament.One of the tournament’s standout bowlers, Muhammad Rohid Khan delivered with the ball for MI Emirates, claiming 10 wickets in just five matches. He registered two crucial three-wicket hauls, including a match-winning spell against the Desert Vipers and another vital performance in the Eliminator against Sharjah Warriorz. His ability to strike in key moments made him a pivotal figure in MI Emirates’ campaign.Despite Gulf Giants missing out on the playoffs, young all-rounder Aayan Afzal Khan emerged as one of the tournament’s most effective spinners. He bagged 10 wickets in seven innings, with a stunning four-wicket haul for just 16 runs against Abu Dhabi Knight Riders—the best bowling figures by a UAE player in ILT20 history. His economy rate of 6.17 was among the best, matched only by Sunil Narine (Abu Dhabi Knight Riders), while Wanindu Hasaranga (Desert Vipers) had a slightly better rate.A key player in Abu Dhabi Knight Riders’ middle order, Alishan Sharafu played with maturity and consistency. He finished as his team's third-highest run-scorer, amassing 220 runs in nine innings at an average of 31.42. He began the tournament with a solid 46 against Desert Vipers, but his most impactful innings was a 55 off 38 balls in a commanding 42-run win over MI Emirates.Despite sharing the Desert Vipers' bowling attack with international stars like Lockie Ferguson, Mohammad Amir, and Wanindu Hasaranga, Khuzaima Tanveer stood out with a match-winning four-wicket haul for 22 runs against Sharjah Warriorz. He also picked up two crucial wickets in Qualifier 2, proving his ability to deliver under pressure.Farhan Khan earned praise for his composure in crunch moments, especially when he defended 11 runs against Kieron Pollard in the season opener. Often entrusted with the new ball for Dubai Capitals, he cemented himself as a rising star. Zahoor Khan (MI Emirates) added depth to his team’s bowling attack, picking up five wickets and delivering key spells throughout the tournament.With UAE’s local talent continuing to rise, ILT20 Season 3 was another strong testament to their growing presence on the global T20 stage.","The third season of the ILT20 concluded in thrilling fashion, with the Dubai Capitals emerging as champions after a gripping final against the Desert Vipers.

NEW DELHI: Nearly three decades after the 1996 ICC World Cup graced Pakistani soil, the nation stands at the precipice of another historic moment. With the hands of the clock glued to the famous tower of Faisalabad ticking fast, the 2025 ICC Champions Trophy is all set to bring the roar of packed stadiums, the thrill of last-over finishes, and the hope of a nation longing for the much-awaited cricketing festival. Pakistan last hosted an ICC event 29 years back, when the ICC World Cup was co-hosted alongside India and Sri Lanka. The tournament saw Pakistan bowing out in the quarter-finals after a tough loss to their neighbours in blue. However, the grand finale in Lahore belonged to Sri Lanka, who claimed their maiden World Cup title with an awe-inspiring seven-wicket victory over the mighty Australians.Twenty-nine years later, cricket fever is set to sweep across Pakistan once again, despite the nation’s struggles with financial and political turmoil.With renovated stadiums and upgraded infrastructure -- the stage is eventually ready for a marriage of bat and ball, with the entire world keeping a close eye.“This is a huge thing for the entire country of Pakistan. After such a long time, such a big event is happening, and almost all the big teams that play cricket are coming to Pakistan. This is going to be a massive festival in Pakistan,” former Pakistan pacer Mohammad Amir told TimesofIndia.com in an exclusive interview. “Every single game is going to be a full house.”Pakistan, led by Mohammad Rizwan , enter the competition as the defending champions, having claimed the title in emphatic fashion in the 2017 edition in England.But the question remains: Can Rizwan inspire his team to a successful title defence, or will the burden of expectations prove too heavy?Pakistan have never been short of match-winners, and this edition is no different.The team boasts an explosive batting lineup capable of dismantling the best bowling attacks on their day. Fakhar Zaman , the hero of the 2017 final, is back in the ODI setup, and his ability to turn games around in a matter of overs makes him a key asset.Meanwhile, if Babar Azam , whose last ODI century came in a 151-run knock against Nepal in August 2023, rediscovers his golden touch, Pakistan’s chances of posting mammoth totals will skyrocket.The middle order, featuring skipper Mohammad Rizwan, Saud Shakeel, and Salman Ali Agha, has been in sublime form in recent times.Rizwan’s ability to anchor the innings while shifting gears when needed makes him a crucial cog in Pakistan’s batting wheel.Yet, Pakistan’s real strength lies in its pace attack.A well-oiled machine spearheaded by the lethal Shaheen Shah Afridi , the bowling unit also features Naseem Shah, Haris Rauf (subject to availability), and the ever-improving Mohammad Hasnain.On home pitches, where reverse swing and raw pace will play a significant role, this pace attack will be something worth monitoring.Despite the presence of star players, Pakistan have notable chinks in its armour. The opening combination remains a concern.With Saim Ayub sidelined due to an ankle fracture and Abdullah Shafique dropped for poor form, the responsibility falls on Fakhar Zaman and Babar Azam.However, this duo has struggled to fire consistently in recent times, leaving Pakistan vulnerable in the crucial powerplay overs.Another questionable selection decision has been Pakistan’s spin department.With only one specialist spinner in Abrar Ahmed -- who has had injury concerns -- the team appears to be walking a tightrope.The absence of a seasoned campaigner like Shadab Khan or even Sufiyan Muqeem raises doubts about Pakistan’s ability to contain opposition batsmen in the middle overs, especially on slower tracks.The lower order also lacks proven firepower.Tayyab Tahir, Faheem Ashraf, and Khushdil Shah haven’t delivered substantial performances at the international level, making the team heavily reliant on the top order.In crunch situations, the inability of the lower order to add quick runs could hurt Pakistan’s chances.Leadership in Pakistan cricket has often been a high-stakes drama, and Rizwan now finds himself at the centre of it.Since becoming the white-ball captain in October last year, he has shown the perfect temperament to guide Pakistan through the pressures of a home tournament.However, leading Pakistan in such a high-profile event is no small task, and he will need to ensure his team remains mentally strong amid the weight of expectations.Citing Pakistan’s triumphant away tours, Amir remains optimistic. “I have high hopes because Pakistan has recently won both away series. And I think this is a huge achievement for Pakistan, to win in Australia against Australia and then in South Africa against South Africa. Since the Champions Trophy is in Pakistan, it will be an advantage for Pakistan, so I think Pakistan can do really well.”Pakistan's Champions Trophy 2025 squad: Mohammad Rizwan (c), Babar Azam, Fakhar Zaman, Kamran Ghulam, Saud Shakeel, Tayyab Tahir, Faheem Ashraf, Khushdil Shah, Salman Ali Agha, Usman Khan , Abrar Ahmed, Haris Rauf, Mohammad Hasnain, Naseem Shah, Shaheen Shah Afridi.With a praiseworthy pace attack, an eye-catching batting lineup, coupled with the advantage of home conditions, Pakistan have all the ingredients to make a deep run in the tournament.However, cricket is a game of fine margins, and much will depend on the skipper's ability to rally his troops when it matters most.Will Mohammad Rizwan be the captain to lead Pakistan to the consecutive title, or will history repeat itself with a heartbreak on home soil? Now, the eyes turn towards Faisalabad's clock tower; it will tell the true story when the time comes.","Pakistan to host ICC Champions Trophy for first time in 29 years. Defending champions enter as the defending champions. Pakistan have never been short of match-winners, and this edition is no different. Fakhar Zaman, Babar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan will be key to Pakistan's success.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118331554,imgsize-30926,width-400,resizemode-4/118331554.jpg"

Tottenham Hotspur secured a narrow 1-0 victory against Manchester United on Sunday, dealing another disappointing result to Red Devils' manager Ruben Amorim. A solitary goal from James Maddison in the 13th minute propelled Spurs above United to 12th position, marking their third triumph over United this season.The win provided relief for Tottenham's manager Ange Postecoglou, who had faced criticism following recent eliminations from domestic cup competitions and poor league performance. United slipped to 15th position, though maintaining a comfortable 12-point gap from the relegation zone.""The place in the table is my worry, I am not worried about me,"" said Amorim, who has managed just four victories in 14 Premier League matches since his November appointment. ""I hate to lose. That feeling is the worst. The rest I am not thinking about. I understand my situation, my job, I am confident in my work and I just want to win games.""Tottenham's first home league victory since November occurred amidst supporter unrest. Fans expressed their dissatisfaction towards ENIC and chairman Daniel Levy through protests before and after the match. A prominent banner stated ""24 years, 16 managers, 1 trophy - Time for change"" as supporters demanded Levy's departure.Postecoglou's squad received a boost with several key players returning from injury. Goalkeeper Guglielmo Vicario made his first appearance since November, whilst Maddison returned to the starting eleven. Destiny Udogie, Brennan Johnson and Wilson Odobert were available as substitutes.""They are quality players. We've had it pretty tough the last two-and-a-half months,"" said Postecoglou. ""It was important for us to win and gain some traction. I certainly feel there is still a massive opportunity for us in this back half of the season and hopefully today is the start of that.""United faced their own injury challenges, with Amad Diallo joining Lisandro Martinez as long-term absentees and Kobbie Mainoo sidelined for a month. Amorim's bench included eight teenagers, whilst Rasmus Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee started upfront.The match saw several chances for both sides. Vicario denied attempts from Hojlund and Alejandro Garnacho, whilst Maddison capitalised on Andre Onana's parry to score. Garnacho missed a clear opportunity before halftime, and Zirkzee failed to convert a promising header later in the match.United's offensive struggles continued, with only the bottom three clubs and Everton scoring fewer than their 28 goals in 25 league matches. Despite Onana's save from Dejan Kulusevski's effort, Tottenham's defence held firm to secure victory, offering Postecoglou renewed optimism.","Tottenham Hotspur secured a narrow 1-0 victory against Manchester United on Sunday.

NEW DELHI: Liverpool on Sunday secured a 2-1 victory against Wolves at Anfield, extending their lead at the top of the Premier League to seven points.Luis Diaz ended his goal drought with his first goal in 2025, while Mohamed Salah continued his impressive form as Liverpool bounced back from a disappointing week.The Colombian forward scored his 13th goal of the season after going 10 games without finding the net.Salah's penalty conversion before halftime marked his 28th goal across all competitions this season.Wolves' Matheus Cunha scored in the second half, but Liverpool managed to hold on despite showing signs of fatigue in a tense finish.Liverpool's previous two matches resulted in an FA Cup fourth round defeat to Plymouth and a 2-2 draw with Everton.Arsenal's recent 2-0 victory at Leicester had put additional pressure on Liverpool's title pursuit.Liverpool's response moved them closer to potentially securing their 20th English title, which would equal the existing record.With upcoming matches against Aston Villa, Manchester City, and Newcastle in the next 10 days, Liverpool could strengthen their position in the title race.Manager Arne Slot was present despite facing charges for confronting referee Michael Oliver after the Merseyside derby.The incident stemmed from Slot's disagreement over James Tarkowski's stoppage-time equalizer, which he believed should have been disallowed due to a possible foul by Beto on Ibrahima Konate.Slot had urged Liverpool to use their 'anger' from the painful end to the Everton game as fuel to get back on track against Wolves.Diaz opened the scoring in the 15th minute with his first league goal at Anfield since September.The goal came after Diaz found Salah, whose return pass deflected off Toti Gomes. Diaz managed to chest the ball past Wolves goalkeeper Jose Sa.Dominik Szoboszlai nearly added to Liverpool's lead with a low shot that went wide.Jose Sa was forced to save Diogo Jota's attempt following Andy Robertson's cross.Liverpool extended their lead in the 37th minute through Salah's penalty, despite Wolves' protests about a possible push by Diaz on Emmanuel Agbadou.Salah's recent form has been exceptional, with seven goals in his last six appearances.Wolves' new signing Marshall Munetsi missed a clear opportunity early in the second half, with Alisson Becker making a crucial save.A penalty decision for Liverpool was overturned by VAR after replays showed Jota had dived following Agbadou's challenge.Cunha took advantage of Liverpool's declining momentum, scoring with a curling shot past Ryan Gravenberch in the 67th minute.Liverpool persevered through a challenging final period to claim their fourth victory in five league matches.","Liverpool beat Wolves 2-1 to extend their lead at the top of the Premier League to seven points.

Bagan show their might to Blasters,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/indian-super-league/top-stories/bagan-show-their-might-to-blasters/articleshow/118293743.cms,"KOCHI: On Saturday evening, Mohun Bagan Super Giant demonstrated to Kerala Blasters why they are on top of the ISL table. They also proved that superior ball possession and attacking prowess cannot compensate for defensive frailties.Despite Blasters controlling 67% of the possession, Bagan secured a commanding 3-0 victory over the home side at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium, Kochi, with Jamie MacLaren netting twice (28, 40) and Alberto Rodriguez (66) completing the tally for the visitors.The first 25 minutes of the game were all about Blasters. They mounted one attack after another on the Bagan goal but failed to convert any of their chances into goals. However, the Kolkata giants weathered the storm and scored against the run of play in the 28th minute. Once they found an opening, Bagan knew how to kill the game and did just that.The home side's best chance in the first half came in the 20th minute, but Jesus Jimenez squandered it. A poor backpass inside the box from Bagan's Lalengmawia Ralte was collected by Jimenez. Despite successfully beating the offside trap, the forward's shot sailed high over the crossbar.The architect of Bagan's first goal was Liston Colaco. With a clever move, he outmanoeuvred Luna and delivered the ball from the left to MacLaren inside the box. MacLaren's excellent first touch followed by a powerful left-footed strike thudded into Blasters' net.Bagan nearly doubled their advantage five minutes later as Colaco's curling attempt from the left narrowly missed the target.MacLaren made it 2-0 four minutes before half-time. The sequence began with Vishal Keith's long pass to MacLaren, who cleverly backheeled to Jason Cummings. The UK striker then chipped the ball towards MacLaren, who sprinted past the Blasters' defence and cleverly lobbed it over the advancing Sachin Suresh into the goal. Although MacLaren put the ball in the Blasters' net one more time during first-half stoppage time, the goal was disallowed for offside.Bagan extended the lead in the 66th minute through defender Alberto Rodriguez Martin's strike. Once again, the Blasters defence failed to clear their lines during a set piece. After the initial shot was blocked by the two-man wall, the ball fell before Rodriguez, whose powerful left-footer was enough to beat a diving Sachin Suresh.The defeat has hit Blasters' playoff qualification hopes. They are eighth in the points table with 24 points from 20 matches and trail sixth-placed Mumbai City by seven points. Bagan, having already secured their playoff spot, strengthened their position at the summit with 49 points from 21 matches.","Mohun Bagan beat Kerala Blasters 3-0 at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium, Kochi.

Real Madrid maintained their top position in La Liga despite a 1-1 stalemate at Osasuna on Saturday, a match marked by Jude Bellingham's dismissal, whilst Atletico Madrid also drew 1-1 against Celta Vigo.The league leaders scored first through Kylian Mbappe , but proceedings took a turn when Bellingham received a red card for dissent near the conclusion of the first period.Osasuna equalised via Ante Budimir's penalty conversion at the 58-minute mark, as the defending champions extended their winless league run to three matches.Despite playing with reduced numbers after Pablo Barrios' early dismissal in the seventh minute, Atletico Madrid stayed within a point of Los Blancos, whilst Barcelona could potentially match Real Madrid's points tally should they triumph over Rayo Vallecano on Monday.Bellingham defended his actions, stating he was merely expressing personal frustration. ""I think you can see clearly in the video, I remember the incident very well, it was an expression to myself,"" he told reporters. ""I'm not even directing myself towards the referee, but obviously there was a misunderstanding. He's believed that I've said (something insulting) to him... There was no intent to insult him, there was no insult.""Carlo Ancelotti, Real Madrid's manager, expressed satisfaction with his team's performance despite the result. ""In a footballing sense we started very well, and we finished well despite having one less player,"" said Ancelotti.The Italian tactician adjusted his lineup considering the upcoming Champions League fixture against Manchester City, resting Rodrygo whilst giving Brahim Diaz a start.Los Blancos dominated early proceedings with swift ball movement, and Mbappe soon converted Fede Valverde's cross, marking his seventh goal in five La Liga appearances.The match shifted when Bellingham received his red card at 39 minutes after an exchange with referee Jose Munuera Montero.Ancelotti defended his player: ""I think with Bellingham's red card (the referee) didn't understand the English well... I don't think it's something offensive. I think the red card came out because the referee was nervous... Bellingham did nothing today to have been sent off, absolutely nothing.""After previous complaints about Spanish officiating, Madrid's frustrations grew in the second half. Osasuna equalised through Budimir's penalty after Camavinga fouled him, bringing the striker's season tally to 13 goals.Mbappe had a final opportunity in stoppage time, but goalkeeper Sergio Herrera made a crucial save.Regarding Atletico's match, Diego Simeone praised his team's resilience: ""The team had gladiators again, playing 90 minutes with one fewer player is very tough,"" whilst acknowledging Barrios' dismissal as correct.Koke reflected on the challenge: ""When we were left with 10 men it's very difficult... the team tried everything. We defended well, we suffered when we had to. Obviously we're still in the fight for the title.""In another fixture, Valencia secured a 1-1 draw at Villarreal in their relegation battle.","Real Madrid held to 1-1 draw by Osasuna in La Liga.

Arsenal overcame their injury concerns to narrow the gap with Premier League leaders Liverpool as Mikel Merino led them to a 2-0 victory against Leicester, whilst Omar Marmoush's hat-trick powered Manchester City to a 4-0 triumph over Newcastle on Saturday.Arteta's team initially struggled to break through at the King Power Stadium, risking a missed opportunity to gain ground in the title race.With limited attacking options due to injuries, Arteta deployed Spanish midfielder Merino as an improvised forward in the final minutes.The tactical change proved successful as Merino scored twice in the final nine minutes, extending Arsenal's unbeaten league streak to 15 matches.In the 81st minute, Ethan Nwaneri delivered an accurate cross into Leicester's area, where Merino headed powerfully past Mads Hermansen from six yards.Seven minutes afterwards, Leandro Trossard sent a cross into the six-yard box, and Merino's perfectly-timed run beat the Leicester defence as he finished to bring second-placed Arsenal within four points of Liverpool.Arteta faced significant attacking limitations with Kai Havertz out for the season after sustaining a hamstring injury during training in Dubai.Gabriel Jesus, Bukayo Saka and Gabriel Martinelli were also unavailable due to injuries.The Gunners secured a crucial victory upon their return to action, following their 2-0 League Cup semi-final defeat at Newcastle and subsequent break due to their FA Cup elimination.""The first half, we struggled to get momentum because we did a lot of simple things wrong, but the second half was very different,"" Arteta said.

Responding to Brighton's impressive 3-0 victory at the Amex Stadium on Friday, Chelsea manager Enzo Maresca acknowledged it as the ""worst performance"" under his leadership, with Japanese talent Kaoru Mitoma delivering a spectacular Premier League goal.The lacklustre Chelsea side failed to register any shots on target, marking their second loss within a week at the venue.Fresh from scoring the decisive goal in Brighton's 2-1 FA Cup triumph over Chelsea the previous weekend, Mitoma continued to shine. His remarkable first-half display of skill preceded Gambian winger Yankuba Minteh's double strike.Having arrived from Leicester, Maresca's inaugural season included recent statements about Chelsea's rightful place in the Champions League , aligning with the club's two-year qualification objective.The recent defeat, their third in four matches across all competitions, has dampened their top-four aspirations.""I constantly feel pressure, but today's performance stands out as the poorest since my arrival,"" Maresca stated. ""This result brings complete frustration. We deeply regret disappointing our travelling supporters.""The manager faces the crucial task of addressing Chelsea's defensive vulnerabilities if the fourth-placed team, currently leading Manchester City and Newcastle by two points, aims to achieve their seasonal objectives.Maresca elaborated: ""In our current position, with an opportunity to extend our lead over pursuing teams, tonight's performance highlights numerous areas requiring improvement. However, we maintain fourth position and remain competitive for a strong finish.""Brighton, who suffered a 7-0 defeat at Nottingham Forest in their last league encounter and had secured only two victories in their previous twelve top-flight matches, have regained momentum with consecutive wins against Chelsea.Cole Palmer's early-season prowess, yielding six goals in seven initial league appearances followed by eight more (including two penalties) in seventeen subsequent matches, has notably diminished.Chelsea's trajectory has shifted from potential title challengers to top-four contenders as Palmer's form cooled. His struggles continued with wayward attempts before Noni Madueke's injury-enforced departure compounded Chelsea's fitness concerns.Brighton's opening goal showcased Mitoma's brilliance, expertly controlling Bart Verbruggen's goal-kick before outmanoeuvring Trevoh Chalobah and finishing precisely.Despite Enzo Fernandez's disallowed header due to a clear push, Brighton extended their lead through Minteh, capitalising on Chelsea's defensive errors. The third goal arrived from Minteh's skilled finish following Danny Welbeck's contribution, despite Chelsea's protests about a possible foul on Levi Colwill.","Brighton beat Chelsea 3-0 at the Amex Stadium on Friday night.

Anti-doping agency's inconsistencies lead to zero trust among fellow pros following Sinner 'resolution'

Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel.

DUBAI: Jessica Pegula threw her arms up in frustration trying to get a handle on the World Anti-Doping Agency 's (WADA) decision to enter into a 'case resolution agreement' with world No.1 Jannik Sinner, who tested positive for Clostebol last March.Pegula, ranked five, speaking on the sidelines of the Dubai Duty Free tennis, a WTA 1000 event, argued that no matter which side of the divide one fell, whether people thought Sinner was guilty or not, ""the process seemed not to be a process"".""Whatever factors they take into consideration they make up their own ruling, I don't really understand how that's fair for athletes, there's just so much inconsistency,"" Pegula said of the agency, which until last week appeared to be pulling for at least a year-long ban.WADA, who lodged an appeal at the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) in September, was initially looking at a period of ineligibility of between one and two years for the Italian. With the date for the appeal of the 'no fault or negligence' ruling of the International Tennis Integrity Agency set for mid-April, WADA tossed a curveball on Saturday, handing the 23-year-old a threemonth suspension that ends on May 4.Sinner, who has maintained he's innocent, saying the drug had entered his system when his physiotherapist, who had used the cream on himself, had subsequently massaged him. ""I have always accepted that I'm responsible for my team, on that basis I have accepted WADA's offer to resolve these proceedings on the basis of a three-month sanction,"" Sinner said in a statement.On the morning after, the bulk of the tennis community questioned WADA's decision, with the likes of the former British No.1 Tim Henman calling the length of the ban, which allows Sinner to return to the Tour in time for the Masters 1000 event in Rome, as convenient.""We get these emails explaining why this happened,"" Pegula, who is part of the WTA Players' Council, said. ""It's like I can give a reason and explain a million different ways to make it sound right. The process is broken, it needs to be seriously considered. They have so much power to ruin someone's career, something needs to be done about that because it seems unfair.""Pegula, whose parents Terry and Kim own the Buffalo Bills (NFL), Buffalo Sabres (NHL) and Buffalo Bandits (Lacrosse), is no stranger to the business of sport. The 30-yearold underlined that the number of players who had trust in the process was ""zero"".""It's a horrible look for the sport when there's so much inconsistency with player rulings,"" she said, ""I don't know what to think. The past couple years there seems to be no rhyme or reason for whatever they decide. So, I'm not really that shocked that there all of a sudden is a settlement.""Aryna Sabalenka, the world no.1 and top seed in Dubai, said the recent positive tests of Sinner and Iga Swiatek had made her wary. ""You start to be more careful,"" the 26-year-old Belarusian said, ""before I wouldn't care, I would leave a glass of water in a restaurant and go to the bathroom. Now I'm not going to drink (from) the same glass. These things get to your head, if someone uses a cream on you and you test positive, they're going to go for you. You become scared of the system.""""I don't see how I can trust the system,"" added Sabalenka.","Jessica Pegula questions World Anti-Doping Agency's decision on Jannik Sinner.

HERE'S WHO SAID WHAT:

Leading tennis player Jannik Sinner accepted a three-month doping ban in an agreement with the World Anti-Doping Agency ( WADA ) on Friday, which has followed a backlash from his fellow professional players.The agreement allows Sinner to resume playing from May 5, retain his No. 1 ranking, keep his Grand Slam opportunities intact and preserve his titles and prize money earned following his positive test for a prohibited anabolic steroid in March last year.""Fairness in tennis does not exist,"" Nick Kyrgios wrote on X, while three-time Grand Slam champion Stan Wawrinka also voiced his reaction on the same social media platform. ""I don't believe in a clean sport anymore ...,"" Wawrinka posted.""I hope everyone can discuss with WADA and defend themselves like Jannik Sinner from now on,"" Daniil Medvedev said while reacting to the development.""When I read the statement this morning, it just seems a little bit too convenient,"" Former British No. 1 Tim Henman said while talking to Sky Sport.""Obviously having just won the Australian Open, to miss three months of the tour and therefore to be eligible to play at Roland Garros, the timing couldn't have been any better for Sinner; but I still think it leaves a pretty sour taste for the sport.""The Professional Tennis Players Association, established by Novak Djokovic and Vasek Pospisil, expressed their views on X, issuing a statement condemning the ATP , WTA, Grand Slams, WADA and International Tennis Integrity Agency.""The system' is not a system. It's a club. Supposed case-by-case discretion is, in fact, merely cover for tailored deals, unfair treatment, and inconsistent rulings. It's not just the different results for different players. It's the lack of transparency. The lack of process. The lack of consistency. The lack of credibility in the alphabet soup of agencies charged with regulating our sports and athletes,"" the PTPA wrote.","Leading tennis player Jannik Sinner accepted a three-month doping ban in an agreement with the World Anti-Doping Agency ( WADA ) on Friday.

Which tournaments will Jannik Sinner miss after three-month ban in settlement of doping case?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/what-tournaments-will-jannik-sinner-miss-after-three-month-ban-in-settlement-of-doping-case/articleshow/118273837.cms,"Jannik Sinner (AP Photo)

NEW DELHI: World No. 1 Jannik Sinner has accepted a three-month suspension in a settlement with the World Anti-Doping Agency ( WADA ) after testing positive for Clostebol, a banned anabolic steroid.The suspension, which runs from February 9 to May 4, means the 23-year-old Italian will miss several key tournaments, including Indian Wells , Miami, Monte Carlo, and the Madrid Open.However, he is expected to return in time for the Italian Open in Rome (May 7–18), just weeks before the French Open (May 25–June 8).The case stems from two positive doping tests last March. The International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA) initially cleared Sinner, accepting his explanation that the substance entered his system through accidental contamination -- trace amounts were transferred from a trainer who had applied the substance to a cut on his finger.WADA, however, appealed the ruling to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) in Lausanne, seeking at least a one-year ban. The two sides reached a settlement, reducing the suspension to three months.Sinner’s absence is a significant blow to the ATP Tour , given his dominance in recent months.After winning his Grand Slam title at the Australian Open in January, he had been in top form and was seen as a major contender for upcoming clay-court events. Thanks to his triumph in Melbourne, he is now eligible to compete in the next Grand Slam.His absence from Indian Wells and Miami -- two prestigious Masters 1000 tournaments -- will impact the battle for the ATP No. 1 ranking.The Italian will now focus on preparing for his comeback at home in Rome, where he will aim to regain momentum ahead of Roland Garros .","World No. 1 Jannik Sinner has accepted a three-month suspension.

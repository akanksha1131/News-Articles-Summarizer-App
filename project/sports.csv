Poll Should the India vs Pakistan match in Asia Cup 2025 be reconsidered due to recent terror-related developments? Yes, it should be reconsidered. No, it should proceed as planned.

Former Indian cricketer Manoj Tiwary has voiced strong opposition to the scheduled India vs Pakistan match in the upcoming Asia Cup 2025, citing recent terror-related developments as the primary reason.The tournament, set to take place in the UAE from September 9 to 28, has already stirred political and public debate due to the high-voltage fixture scheduled for September 14.Speaking to ANI, Tiwary said, “I am against it. The India-Pakistan match should not be held, especially after the terrorist attack in Pahalgam, in which civilians have been killed. After that, Operation Sindoor has taken place.”His comments come just a day after the Asian Cricket Council (ACC) confirmed the schedule and venue of the tournament.India are placed in Group A alongside Pakistan, UAE, and Oman, while Group B consists of Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Afghanistan, and Hong Kong. India will open their campaign against UAE on September 10 before facing Pakistan on September 14 and Oman on September 19.Tiwary further emphasised that hosting the India-Pakistan game at such a time sends the wrong message.“The situation was so bad, how can we think of an India-Pakistan match? I feel it should be reconsidered,” he added.His remarks echo the national mood following Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s warning to Pakistan in Parliament earlier this week.PM Modi stated that any misadventure by Pakistan would be met with a ""befitting reply"" and confirmed that Operation Sindoor is only on pause.Tiwary questioned the scheduling of a cricket match with Pakistan while military operations are underway. “Our Prime Minister is saying Operation Sindoor is still going on... How can we play a match with Pakistan?” he asked.Meanwhile, former captain Sourav Ganguly offered a more measured perspective, saying, “Sport must go on,” while also condemning terrorism and calling for stronger action against it.",Former Indian cricketer Manoj Tiwary has voiced strong opposition to the scheduled India vs Pakistan match in the upcoming Asia Cup 2025.

Cricket fans witnessed one of the strangest moments in the sport’s recent history during Match 14 of the World Championship of Legends (WCL) 2025, as Australian bowler John Hastings delivered a bizarre 18-ball over against Pakistan Champions at Grace Road, Leicester, on Tuesday.Pakistan Champions, chasing just 75 for victory, were already cruising at 55/0 in the seventh over when Hastings was brought into the attack.What followed was one of the longest overs in recorded cricket history. Hastings started with five wide deliveries, all well outside the off-stump to right-hander Sohaib Maqsood.After a single changed the strike, Sharjeel Khan added a boundary, followed by a no-ball and yet another wide, this time outside leg stump. The extras kept piling up.Struggling with his line, Hastings switched to round the wicket but ended up bowling three more wides across Sharjeel.Desperation took over as he changed angles again, only to fire more deliveries far from the stumps. In total, the over included 12 wides and one no-ball, and was never even completed, as Pakistan reached the target before it ended.Watch:Earlier, Pakistan’s bowlers had dismantled Australia Champions for a meagre 74.Saeed Ajmal was the standout performer, taking 6 wickets for just 16 runs, supported by Imad Wasim’s tight spell. Australia lost eight wickets for 25 runs in a shocking collapse after being comfortably placed at 49/2.In reply, openers Sharjeel Khan (32 not out) and Sohaib Maqsood (28 not out) made light work of the chase, sealing a 10-wicket win in just 7.5 overs.Hastings's over will now go down in cricket folklore for all the wrong reasons, a surreal episode that had fans scratching their heads and laughing in disbelief.","Australian bowler John Hastings delivered a bizarre 18-ball over against Pakistan Champions at Grace Road, Leicester, on Tuesday.

Japan's Naomi Osaka, a four-time Grand Slam singles champion, will work with Polish coach Tomasz Wiktorowski on a trial basis after splitting with Patrick Mouratoglou after less than a year together.Osaka announced the parting with Frenchman Mouratoglou, the former coach of superstar Serena Williams, on social media on Monday before defeating Canadian qualifier Ariana Arseneault 6-4, 6-2 in 76 minutes in a first round match at the WTA Canadian Open in Montreal.Osaka, ranked 49th, began working in Canada with Wiktorowski, who coached Poland's Agnieszka Radwańska from 2011-2018, helping her reach the Wimbledon final and world number two ranking in July 2012.Wiktorowski also coached Poland's Iga Swiatek from late 2021 until last October, a run where she won four of her six career Grand Slam singles titles, before adding the most recent at Wimbledon earlier this month.Osaka, who improved to 11-1 in matches against players ranked outside the top 100, will next face 13th seed Liudmila Samsonova in the second round.

Poll What do you think is Rishabh Pant's greatest quality as a cricketer? Never giving up Skillful strokeplay

IND vs ENG: The Oval curator breaks silence on Gautam Gambhir's outburst ahead of 5th Test

In the world of superheroes, a “superpower” might mean flight, invisibility, or superhuman strength. But in cricket, Rishabh Pant has shown time and again that his truest superpower is none of these — it’s the unwavering refusal to give up.He’s dazzled with outrageous strokeplay — sweeping fast bowlers, hitting sixes while falling, and rewriting the script at some of cricket’s most daunting venues. But beyond the fireworks lies something far more enduring: grit.Pant’s 'never-say-die' spirit has shown up at the most crucial times — whether it was his heroic 97 in Sydney with an injured elbow, the fearless 91* at the Gabba that clinched a famous series win, or his dramatic return to cricket in 2024, just 15 months after a life-threatening car crash.But nothing captured this superpower more vividly than his decision to bat on July 24 during the fourth Test against England — with a fractured foot.Despite a broken fifth metatarsal, Pant resumed his innings at 37 and went on to score 54, visibly in pain, barely running, yet hitting boundaries. The decision stunned fans and critics alike. Many questioned the risk involved, but Pant made it clear — for him, playing for India wasn’t optional.It was instinct.His sister Sakshi summed it up best: “Zakhmi hoon, magar khel raha hoon, kyunki haar manna meri fitrat mei nahi hai.” (I am injured, but I am still playing, because accepting defeat is not in my nature.)Pant’s journey is full of such stories — from long bus rides from Roorkee to Delhi for trials, to playing an IPL match days after losing his father, to learning from the likes of MS Dhoni and Rishabh Pant himself.Sports psychologist Alisha Raut-Pimple, who worked with Pant early in his career, believes this mindset was forged through hardship and nurtured by experience. “He doesn’t view pressure or pain as obstacles — he sees them as challenges to grow through,” she said.Pant’s 54 at Old Trafford now joins cricket’s folklore of bravery — alongside Kumble bowling with a broken jaw, Laxman battling back spasms, or Graeme Smith walking in with a broken hand. But Pant wasn’t chasing headlines. He was just being who he is — a cricketer defined not by boundaries but by backbone.In the end, Pant’s greatest gift to Indian cricket might not be his sixes or centuries, but the lesson his body and spirit keep repeating: the true superpower is never giving up.",Rishabh Pant has shown time and again that his truest superpower is the unwavering refusal to give up.

Sitanshu Kotak press conference: Big revelation on Shubman Gill

Poll Should Jasprit Bumrah play in the fifth Test against England? Yes, he should play No, he should rest

India's batting coach Sitanshu Kotak indicated that pace bowler Jasprit Bumrah could potentially play in the decisive fifth Test against England, stating that he is currently fit based on his workload assessment, despite initial plans to limit him to three Tests on the tour.The possibility of Bumrah's participation gained traction after head coach Gautam Gambhir didn't rule it out following the dramatic draw at Manchester.Kotak addressed Bumrah's fitness status during a press conference two days before the match. ""Bumrah is fit now according to his load. He has bowled one inning in the last match. So that obviously head coach, our physio and captain they will have a discussion and decide. There has been no discussion,"" he said.Gambhir had also confirmed that all pacers, including Arshdeep Singh and Akash Deep, have recovered from their injuries.When questioned about Mohammed Siraj's workload, who has played all games in the series, Kotak provided a detailed explanation about bowler workload management.""So, I don't know what you guys think about the actual workload. So, if I tell you quickly, before the Test series, if a bowler puts in a certain amount of overs per week, that if he's preparing for T20 and putting in 20 overs, 25 overs, 6 overs every day, or putting in 6 overs for five days, that is good enough workload for T20,"" Kotak explained.He elaborated on the monitoring system in place. ""They have a GPS. It shows the record of how many overs the bowler has put in throughout the week. And they're in constant touch with the bowling coach. So, the build-up of the last 4-5 weeks, you need to determine if that there's no spike in it.""Kotak further clarified the concept of workload spikes. ""So, what's the spike? If a bowler is putting in 30 overs per week, and suddenly, in the first innings, he's put in 35 overs, then that's the spike in his load. So, the number of overs that Siraj is putting in every week, it's not necessary that it's due to practice.""He concluded by addressing Siraj's specific situation. ""That load is due to the match as well. So, then, another thing depends on whether Siraj himself, or the physios, or his body feels that, no, I'm tired. Then, they will think about the load. Otherwise, his bowling load is very high, is very good. So, there's no chance of a spike in it.""","India's batting coach Sitanshu Kotak indicated that pace bowler Jasprit Bumrah could potentially play in the decisive fifth Test against England.

Former England fast bowler Stuart Broad has defended Ben Stokes and Indian batters Ravindra Jadeja and Washington Sundar after what unfolded in the last 15 minutes on Day 5 of the fourth Test match at the Old Trafford.Jadeja and Washington were batting on 89 and 80 respectively before the start of the last hour of play when England skipper Ben Stokes, aware that a result was out of reach, offered to shake hands.However, with milestones around the corner, the Indian batters refused, which didn’t amuse Stokes, who then introduced Brook into the attack to bowl some deliberate full-tosses, allowing both to complete their well-deserved tons.Stuart Broad, speaking on the ""For The Love Of Cricket,"" said: ""Jadeja is on 89 not out Washington Sundar never scored a test match hundred is on 75 not out.""I think and the drinks break comes. So what happens in test match cricket if you get to the final hour? Whatever comes last 15 overs. The final hour starts and then you play and We've not had to talk about this for so long because there's been no draws under Ben Stokes.

NEW DELHI: An exciting finale to the five-match Test series between India and England is set to unfold at The Oval, with the fifth and final Test beginning on Thursday. All eyes will be on the toss—yes, it could be a crucial moment given the recent history at the venue.The last first-class match played at The Oval was a County Championship Division One game between Surrey and Durham in June, and it turned out to be a high-scoring spectacle.Surrey, led by Rory Burns, were put into bat by Durham and went on to post a mammoth 820/9 declared in their first innings. Opener Dom Sibley starred with a monumental 305 off 475 balls, while Sam Curran (108), Dan Lawrence (178), and Will Jacks (119) also smashed centuries to propel Surrey to that enormous total.In response, Durham were bowled out for 362 in their first innings, forced to follow on, and then ended their second innings at 262 without loss.The match eventually ended in a draw, with a staggering 1,444 runs scored in total.The run-fest featured one triple century and six individual hundreds across both teams.With that in mind, the big question is: Will India or England look at those numbers and opt to bat first if they win the toss?

The final Test of the ongoing India-England series just got a fiery prelude.

IND vs ENG: The Oval curator breaks silence on Gautam Gambhir's outburst ahead of 5th Test

Former England spinner Monty Panesar has slammed Ben Stokes for his on-field conduct during the fourth Test against India at Old Trafford, calling the England captain’s gesture ""classless"" after he tried to prematurely call a draw.The incident took place during the final session of the Test when Stokes approached Ravindra Jadeja for a handshake, indicating the match should end in a draw. However, Jadeja refused the offer and went on to complete his fifth Test century. His partner, Washington Sundar, also reached a significant milestone, scoring his maiden Test hundred.The two batters stitched together an unbeaten 203-run partnership, rescuing India from a precarious 222/4 just before lunch in their second innings and steering them toward safety.Reacting to Stokes’ mid-match move, Panesar strongly criticised the England captain’s behaviour and suggested it contributed to the negative perception of the England team.""Well, it lacked class. It was being, in England, we're being a bit pompous as well, so it didn't reflect good on them as well. They're good ambassadors of cricket, but I suppose you can see the reasons why people hate England because of the way they behave.That was a very classless gesture from Ben Stokes (on handshake controversy),"" Panesar told IANS on Tuesday.Following the contentious moment, both Jadeja and Sundar went on to complete their centuries and eventually agreed to a draw after a stunning fightback that also featured key contributions from KL Rahul (90) and captain Shubman Gill (103).Despite the draw, England still lead the five-match series 2-1. India will aim to level the series in the fifth and final Test, which begins at The Oval in London on Thursday.","Former England spinner Monty Panesar has slammed Ben Stokes for his on-field conduct during the fourth Test against India at Old Trafford.

MUMBAI: The Kolkata Knight Riders have parted ways with their head coach Chandrakant Pandit and bowling coach Bharat Arun , TOI has reliably learnt. Arun was also the bowling coach of the India team from 2014-2021, barring a year when Anil Kumble was the head coach of Team India.According to a source, Arun has been appointed as the bowling coach of the Chennai Super Kings . A top CSK official, though, denied this development.TOI tried to contact KKR CEO Venky Mysore, Pandit and Arun several times, but there was no response from all three.Confirming the development in a post on ‘X’, KKR stated: “Pandit has decided to explore new opportunities and will not continue as the head coach of Kolkata Knight Riders. We are thankful for his invaluable contributions-including leading KKR to the IPL Championship in 2024 and helping build a strong, resilient squad. His leadership and discipline have left a lasting impact on the team. We wish him all the best for the future. ”A seasoned domestic coach, Pandit had a three-year tenure with Shah Rukh Khan owned franchise.After taking over the reins of the team in 2023, Pandit, rated as the best and most experienced coach in domestic cricket, guided KKR to their third Indian Premier League title in 2024.However, captained by Ajinkya Rahane, KKR finished eighth in IPL-2025, winning just five of their 14 matches and losing seven.During Pandit's three-year stint with KKR, the franchise produced a few India players like Rinku Singh and Harshit Rana, even as mystery spinner Varun Chakravarthy made a successful comeback to international cricket last year.Pandit is currently the Madhya Pradesh head coach.Meanwhile, during IPL-2025, KKR has reappointed former India assistant coach Abhishek Nayar as their assistant coach.Nayar, who was recently named as the UP Warriorz head coach in the Women's Premier League, is set to continue in that role.",Kolkata Knight Riders have parted ways with their head coach Chandrakant Pandit and bowling coach Bharat Arun.

India's head coach Gautam Gambhir was involved in a verbal altercation with The Oval's pitch curator Lee Fortis during India's optional training session on Tuesday, ahead of the final Test match against England. The incident occurred when Indian bowlers were marking their run-up areas in the nets, leading to a public confrontation between the two.The situation escalated quickly before India's batting coach Sitanshu Kotak stepped in to diffuse the tension by pulling Fortis away, while Gambhir continued to express his displeasure from a distance.Team India batting coach Sitanshu Kotak revealed the reason behind the heated argument.""When we were looking at pitch, they asked us to stand 2.5m away.

It began at Lord’s, where Shubman Gill visibly expressed his displeasure at England openers Zak Crawley and Ben Duckett arriving nearly 90 seconds late for their second innings.The drama peaked in Manchester, where England, sensing an inevitable draw, offered to end play early. However, Ravindra Jadeja and Washington Sundar declined, both approaching personal milestones.

At first glance, 22-year-old Harshika Jain’s football ing roots don’t scream ‘history maker’. A girl from a business family in Mumbai’s plush Altamount Road, she was just another sports-loving kid who dabbled in everything from basketball to handball to hockey. But by the time she turned 11, football had kicked everything else aside.Two days ago, Harshika became the first Indian footballer to sign with a Romanian firstdivision club, joining Atletic Olimpia Gherla. No Indian has ever featured in Romania’s top two leagues before.Moving from India to play professional football at the European stage, Harshika is following in the footsteps of Bala Devi, Manisha Kalyan and Aditi Chauhan. Her signing isn’t just about international firsts; it’s also one of persistence, late-night training sessions, lockdown drills, and a young girl breaking into all-boys’ teams.Harshika’s football journey began at school, where she could always be found on the football ground. And she could be spotted quite easily, too, as she would be the only girl training with boys. It was the same in her locality, where she would always have to play with the other boys as no girls joined it.The move to Romania came through trial at Olimpia Gherla, where she impressed legendary coach Mirel Albon, the man behind Romania’s rise in women’s football.After 20 days of trial, the club offered her a contract.“It feels like family here,” Harshika told TOI. “And that’s important to me. I’m close to my family, and the club environment reflects that. They’ve welcomed me with open arms.” Despite going global, her dream remains rooted in national colours. “Wearing India’s jersey, that’s the dream. Always has been.”","Harshika Jain became the first Indian footballer to sign with a Romanian firstdivision club, joining Atletic Olimpia Gherla.

The league announced the suspension on Friday, enforcing its policy that requires selected players to participate in the All-Star game unless they have valid reasons for absence.The duo withdrew from the showcase event early Wednesday without revealing their reasons. The game was set to feature a combined MLS team against players from Mexico's Liga-MX as part of the league's All-Star break.MLS rules mandate that players chosen for the All-Star game must participate unless they have a valid excuse, such as an injury.""Per league rules, any player who does not participate in the All-Star Game without prior approval from the league is ineligible to compete in their club's next match,"" the league stated.MLS Commissioner Don Garber described it as a challenging decision to enforce the suspension.""I know Lionel Messi loves this league. I don't think there's a player -- or anyone -- who has done more for Major League Soccer than Messi.I fully understand, respect, and admire his commitment to Inter Miami, and I respect his decision. Unfortunately, we have a long-standing policy regarding participation in the All-Star Game, and we had to enforce it.

I'm committed to working with our players to determine how the rule should evolve.""The Commissioner acknowledged the demanding schedule Messi has faced, noting that the 38-year-old Argentine has played nine games in 35 days, including four FIFA Club World Cup matches.""Miami's had a schedule that is unlike any other team. Most of our teams had a 10-day break. Miami hasn't. So we have to manage through that as a league,"" Garber said.The situation had been anticipated when Miami coach Javier Mascherano expressed his preference for the players to rest instead of participating in the All-Star game.

The application was emailed to the AIFF,” national team director Subrata Paul told TOI earlier. However, the technical committee did not pursue his candidacy further due to the significant financial implications.Beyond Xavi, the federation received interest from a mix of coaches with some well-known in Indian circles and others with global pedigree. The list included former India coach Stephen Constantine, Slovakia’s Stefan Tarkovic, Liverpool legend Harry Kewell, ex-Blackburn boss Steve Kean, and familiar ISL faces such as Kibu Vicuna, Eelco Schattorie, and Khalid Jamil. Of those, Constantine, Tarkovic, and Jamil have been shortlisted, with Jamil being the lone Indian contender.Xavi’s CV speaks for itself. A product of Barcelona’s famed La Masia academy, he made over 700 appearances for the club, winning eight La Liga titles, four Champions League crowns, and playing a key role in Spain’s World Cup win in 2010 and Euro triumphs in 2008 and 2012.As a coach, he won league titles with both Al Sadd in Qatar and Barcelona, including the 2022–23 La Liga and 2023 Spanish Super Cup before stepping down in 2024.While the AIFF couldn’t afford him, Xavi’s application is seen as a sign of the growing international appeal of Indian football.

It wasn’t just Jaguar TCS Racing’s Nick Cassidy who held his top position in London. Mahindra Racing’s Nyck de Vries also secured back-to-back podiums by finishing second in both races at the London E-Prix. His strong performance at the ExCeL Arena helped Mahindra finish fourth in the Formula E Teams’ Championship and fifth in the Manufacturers’ Championship. He was joined on the podium on Sunday by Envision Racing’s Sébastien Buemi.Nyck de Vries’ double podium in London brought his season tally to three, having also finished second in Monaco. Reflecting on his second consecutive podium, de Vries said, “It was certainly a very challenging race. Obviously, Nick [Cassidy] didn’t want to get too low on energy compared to everyone behind, so he was making sure he stayed on the same energy level as us. That resulted in a bit of a concertina effect behind us. ”He added, “I’m very pleased to bring home another podium and secure P4 for our team, because they’ve done an incredible job. To think that last year we qualified last on merit, and now we’ve come such a long way to finish fourth in the championship — this is a great effort.I’m very proud of everyone at Mahindra.”Envision Racing’s Sebastien Buemi also earned his third podium of the season in London, finishing third behind Nick Cassidy and Nyck de Vries in Sunday’s Round 16. In a heartwarming moment, his three sons joined him on the podium. Buemi had previously won the Monaco E-Prix and taken a podium in Jakarta.Speaking about ending the season on a high while many others were caught in collisions, Buemi said, “In the end, it was important to not get caught up in those incidents. I think I was lucky enough to avoid them well. I saved quite a bit of energy at the beginning, and that basically allowed me to take Attack Mode properly. So, in the end, I’m very happy with that. It’s good for the Teams’ Championship, and it’s satisfying to finish strong and score good points after a tough qualifying. ”Also Read: Nick Cassidy bids Jaguar farewell, celebrates with girlfriend Nathalia Soliani at London E-Prix afterparty At the end, Nick de Vries stood in eighth and Sebastien Buemi in twelfth position in the Formula E Driver Standings.","Mahindra Racing’s Nyck de Vries secured back-to-back podiums by finishing second in both races at the London E-Prix.

Nick Cassidy takes third spot in Driver Standings

N ick Cassidy seems to have all the luck on his side as he went on to win his third race of the season, just days after announcing his exit from Jaguar TCS Racing at the end of this season. The New Zealander won the London E-Prix Round 15 race at the ExCeL Arena on Saturday. He himself called the win “unbelievable,” which was also witnessed by his grandmother at the circuit.

To win here at home for Jaguar and our team, in front of a lot of our friends, family, and partners who are here today, is incredible.”Talking about their strategy and the car, he said, “I wasn’t the happiest guy this morning, but that was for a reason, and I knew we had good potential in the car. In that race, I was able to show that, which is pretty cool.To be honest, it was a little bit fluid — a huge shoutout to my strategy team. I was really scared about not coming out of the pits after Pit Boost in the lead of that second group, and it was tight, but I was able to hang on there, and that’s what made the race.It meant that we could do the Attack Modes later, which was really powerful.”Nick Cassidy also shared a video montage of his podium celebration, where he sprayed champagne and celebrated with his team and family.

Kush Maini is a pro when it comes to cricket knowledge

Who is Kush Maini?

Mahindra Racing’s Indian Formula 2 champion Kush Maini is not just an impressive presence on the track but also well-versed in his country’s favourite sport — cricket. The racer from Bengaluru recently took a cricket quiz and nearly scored a perfect 10/10, answering almost every question with precision. He is the only Indian to have won a Formula 2 race in Monaco and recently delivered an impressive performance at the Berlin Rookie Test, finishing among the top three in both sessions.A video of Kush Maini’s cricket quiz shows him getting momentarily confused with the first question, though he gave the correct answer initially. When asked about the number of players in a cricket team, he initially said “eleven” but changed it to “twelve” after counting the number of openers and following players.After that brief hiccup, Maini breezed through the quiz like a pro. He correctly answered questions about the criteria for a four and a six, and explained terms like LBW, duck, and clean bowled. He also knew the number of overs bowled in T20, One-Day, and Test matches.When asked which team Virat Kohli represents in the IPL, Maini confidently replied, “RCB… that’s me, can’t get that wrong.” He also tackled a question about the British singer who joked about not understanding cricket despite coming from the country that invented it.Maini answered “Ed Sheeran” — and was pleasantly surprised to learn he was right. He also knew that David Beckham was the English footballer who once played a friendly match with Sachin Tendulkar.Watch Kush Maini’s candid video here Kush Maini moved to England at the age of 13–14 to pursue racing. Originally from Bengaluru, he now spends more time abroad than in India. He became the first Indian to win the prestigious Monaco Grand Prix in Formula 2 earlier this year.He recently showcased his racing talent during the Berlin Rookie Test, representing Mahindra Racing. He finished second in the morning session and third in the afternoon. Speaking after the test, he said, “In the morning, we focused on 350kW runs, and in the afternoon, more on race runs. Whatever the run, we were always in the top three and really fast, so a good step was made. Whenever I get into this car, I leave with a smile on my face. ”Also Read: Berlin Rookie Test standouts Gabriele Minì and Kush Maini share insights after impressive runs Maini continues to shine on the track and, following his impressive performance in Berlin, may even join Formula E one day.","Kush Maini is the only Indian to have won a Formula 2 race in Monaco.

FIA and Formula E comment on agreement extension



In good news for Formula E, a multi-year agreement extension has secured the rights to the FIA Formula E World Championship for an additional 10 years from 2038, when the current agreement ends. This ensures a long and thrilling future for the FIA Formula E World Championship. The long-term extension will enable Formula E to grow further, build strategic long-range partnerships, and drive greater fan engagement.At present, Formula E continues to focus on its phased development strategy for its racing cars — delivering faster top speeds, greater acceleration, enhanced aerodynamics, and improved tyre performance. These developments highlight the series' increased relevance to consumers and the wider EV market, with greater “race to road” technology transfer.With electric vehicle sales projected to rise to over 40% of global vehicle sales by 2030, and global lithium-ion battery production expected to triple by 2030, the relevance of Formula E and its technological advancements is more critical than ever. The Formula E GEN3 Evo already represents a step-change in performance: 0–60 mph in just 1.82 seconds (30% faster than a current Formula 1 car), a 200 mph top speed, and nearly 50% of the energy needed to complete a race regenerated during the event.It is designed with sustainability at its core and includes tyres made with 35% recycled materials and bodywork incorporating recycled carbon fibre and natural fibres.Formula E sees the participation of major automotive manufacturers including Porsche, Jaguar, Nissan, Maserati, Stellantis, Mahindra, and Lola-Yamaha. Since its first race in Beijing in 2014, Formula E has grown by 20% year-on-year, reaching around 400 million fans globally and attracting a television audience of approximately half a billion.The Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA), the global governing body for motorsport and mobility organisations, has announced a multi-year extension to its agreement with Formula E Holdings Limited (majority-owned by Liberty Global).Mohammed Ben Sulayem, President at the FIA, said, “The extension of the agreement governing the FIA Formula E World Championship is a fantastic outcome for the sport and a clear reflection of our ongoing strategy at the FIA to foster long-term stability, innovation, and growth across all areas of motorsport.”He further said, “This milestone reaffirms our commitment to innovation, sustainability, and technological progress, which are all central to the Championship’s unique identity and purpose. It also aligns with our broader goal of increasing global participation and driving more accessible motorsport for all. We are delighted to be continuing this journey with Formula E, and I look forward to seeing it grow even further, both on and off the track, in the years to come. ”FIA Chief Commercial Officer Craig Edmondson, said, “Formula E has not only demonstrated impressive growth since its inception, but has also led the way on sustainable innovation in our industry. This is a landmark agreement for the FIA and Formula E, and we are excited to be working with the Championship in the years to come.”Liberty Global CEO Mike Fries said, “We’ve believed in Formula E since day one, and this extension reaffirms our confidence in where it’s headed. This is the motorsport of the future - a championship that combines the very latest technology, close-combat racing, and a mission that really matters.“With the FIA’s continued backing, we can now take the next big steps - scaling the sport, growing its global fanbase, and continuing to push the boundaries of what electric racing can achieve. With this new agreement in place, Formula E is now positioned better than ever to define the future of motorsport - more innovative, more inclusive, more sustainable - and to inspire the next generation of fans, drivers, and partners around the world. ""Also Read: Formula E London E-Prix 2025: Pascal Wehrlein tops FP1, Jake Dennis finishes second Formula E CEO Jeff Dodds also added, “Formula E’s growth since its inception has been nothing short of extraordinary, with hundreds of millions of fans and world-class teams and drivers deciding to choose highly competitive electric racing. This long-term extension of the partnership enables us to continue building the brand, investing in the product and delivering some of the most captivating racing that has made us famous.

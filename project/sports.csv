In Indian cricket, sentimental retirements have often masked larger issues of selection & form. Superstars have usually extended playing careers and scripted their own exits. For India's captain, however, retirement talk is gathering steam ahead of the Sydney Test. For

, too, holding on to his spot looks increasingly difficult with each failure. Only one may be left standing after the final Test of this tour

Rohit Sharma press conference: On his batting, captaincy, future, Rishabh Pant’s shot and more

MELBOURNE: Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli aren't cut from the same cloth, but their careers are definitely fraying at the edges at the same time.With every predictable dismissal, the end is looming. It's not here yet. Maybe tomorrow. Or perhaps the day after. It must be an infuriating wait for these two declining stalwarts.Rumours are swirling as the caravan prepares to enter Sydney for the last stop on the Border-Gavaskar Trophy tour. Perhaps captain Rohit, the lesser of the two Test batsmen, will have his head on the chopping block first. If India don't make the World Test Championship final, Sydney, it is being presumed, could be Rohit's final port of call, a last chance to sign off with a hurrah.Kohli's may be a longer wait. A modern Test great, he still has time if he so chooses. Kohli still looks the part in patches, though the mind seems scrambled. It's getting easier and easier for opposition bowlers to plan his dismissals. Or, perhaps, there will be redemption round the corner, a Steve Smith-like turnaround, and a few more great knocks to add to the lore? The temptation to linger on is irresistible.Of course, a Rohit retirement now would be extremely convenient for the Ajit Agarkar-led selection committee. Celebrity worship and brand recognition is so deeply entrenched in Indian cricket's cloak-and-dagger management style that coaches and selectors struggle to make the tough calls.Even now, with the series on the line, the chatter - no doubt fuelled by whispers from within the machine - is always about 'retirement', never about performance. Indian cricket's super stars, apart from one or two exceptions, have never shared a healthy relationship with being dropped, or with the dreaded 'R' word.For selectors, too, 'retirement' makes it easier. The call appears to be voluntary. Just look at the way Ravichandran Ashwin bid goodbye in Brisbane.The talk should instead be about holding on to one's spot. Retirement, irrespective of age, is a personal thing and not the issue here. If a player doesn't perform, he cannot keep his place. Great players get a longer rope, but it still runs out at some point. What he subsequently decides to do with his playing career - retire or keep playing - is his own call to make. Whether to pick him or not is the call of the selectors and the coach, if he has a say in such matters.Unfortunately, that isn't how Indian cricket, or even its rabid fans, function. There are two ways to look at the Rohit problem which has dogged the team since the pink-ball Test in Adelaide. Going by performance benchmarks alone, his spot in the playing XI in Sydney shouldn't be a guarantee, even if he is the captain or it turns out to be his last Test with the Indian team. Ashwin, after all, didn't play in Brisbane.Rohit's problem isn't limited to Australian soil. He averages 24.76 from 26 innings in 2024. This includes two hundreds and two half-centuries. In India's last five defeats, he averages 11.20 from 10 innings. His last 11 Test innings have brought him returns of 2 and 52, 0 and 8, 18 and 11 (all vs New Zealand at home), 3, 6, 10, 3, 9 (all in Australia on this tour).Even as captain, his overseas record is middling. He has led in eight overseas Tests, losing four, winning two and drawing two. In these Tests, with the bat Rohit averages 29.92, which includes that magnificent 127 at the Oval. Before arriving here, India were whitewashed at home by New Zealand, an unthinkable blow. India have now lost five Tests under Rohit this season, equalling Sachin Tendulkar 's record from 1999-2000.Numbers, though, aren't everything when it comes to batsmen of pedigree. Rohit just hasn't looked like his old self out there in the middle. In Adelaide he took a blow for the team, shifting to the middle order from his regular opening slot since KL Rahul and Yashasvi Jasiwal had just engineered a Test win in Perth along with Jasprit Bumrah The move didn't work and at the MCG he batted better after returning as opener, though the runs still didn't come. In the first innings he was caught in two minds playing his favourite pull shot. In the second he stood firm with a Test to save, and some of that laidback swagger looked like returning when he perished trying to play an attacking shot.The other way is to treat it as an issue of form. While it's easy to gauge from the numbers - he has 164 runs in 15 innings this season, starting with the Tests against Bangladesh - that Rohit has had a horror run, it's been only four months or so, from September 19 (start of the Chennai Test against Bangladesh) till the end of the year. Some famous batters have been known to nurse poor form for far longer. So why talk of retirement and not form, even though Rohit is inching towards 38 years of age?Either way you look at it, Rohit's selection in Sydney shouldn't be an automatic choice. Kohli is in a similar bind but with a significant difference. With Kohli, the numbers make for equally dreary reading - he averages 24.52 this year - but he is at a superior level compared to Rohit as a Test batsman. The debate is different.Plus, he has a century in Perth on this tour, the one time he got to bat against the older Kookaburra ball. He has shown self-restraint. The first-innings 36 from 86 balls at the MCG was a small but significant knock which earned praise from the likes of Smith.Kohli's problem has been both technical - a tendency to reach out and drive at deliveries on the fifth or sixth stump line with askew footwork - and mental, motivated by the urgency to score some quick runs, since the runs aren't coming. The two are linked.Kohli too, has been in a long, gradual decline since the first Covid-enforced break. There could still be some gas left in the tank. Kohli may still have a prolific season or two in him. However, on current form, does he deserve to keep his place? Who can replace him at No. 4 in the present squad? These are questions the team management has to answer.As for Rohit, is this the end of the line? Sydney will provide.","Retirement talk is gathering steam ahead of the Sydney Test. For India's captain, too, holding on to his spot looks increasingly difficult. Rohit's problem isn't limited to Australian soil. He averages 24.76 from 26 innings in 2024.

Pat Cummins reveals Australia's XI for Boxing Day Test

NEW DELHI: Melbourne witnessed high-octane cricket and heated moments during the Boxing Day Test at the MCG, where Virat Kohli 's shoulder bump incident with Australian debutant Sam Konstas became a major talking point.Konstas, in his very first Test appearance, stunned the cricketing world with a fearless display against India's premier pacer Jasprit Bumrah . The young batter executed a daring ramp shot for six over wicketkeeper Rishabh Pant’s head, leaving the Indian team momentarily stunned.However, tensions boiled over at the end of the 10th over when Kohli brushed shoulders with Konstas. The heated exchange that followed saw Usman Khawaja step in to diffuse the situation.Former Australia captain Michael Clarke weighed in on the incident, suggesting Kohli’s reaction stemmed from frustration at the respect - or lack thereof - shown to Bumrah.""Virat is such a tough player. He will not take a backward step and never has throughout his whole career. I think Virat was getting frustrated with the lack of respect that Sam was showing as the best bowler in the world in Bumrah,"" Clarke remarked on the Beyond 23 Cricket Podcast.Despite the fiery exchange, Clarke defended Kohli's character, adding, ""I am sure he would have spoken to Sam after the game. Virat is a great guy. He is not a nasty person. I think it was Virat sticking up for his team.""Konstas went on to score an impressive 60 off 65 deliveries, including six fours and two sixes, before falling to Ravindra Jadeja. Australia secured a commanding 184-run victory, taking a 2-1 lead in the series.In the same game, another Indian star emerged - Nitish Kumar Reddy , whose maiden Test century came at a critical juncture for India. Clarke praised the 21-year-old all-rounder, calling him a ""genius"" and advocating for his promotion in the batting order. ""He has not feared any Australian bowler. He bats, bowls, and fields. This guy is a very good find for the Indian cricket team,"" Clarke added.","Virat Kohli's shoulder bump with Australian debutant Sam Konstas became a major talking point.

NEW DELHI: Indian captain Rohit Sharma 's clarification that Shubman Gill was not dropped for the Boxing Day Test against Australia did not sit well with legendary Sunil Gavaskar , who asserted that the decision could only be described as a drop.The decision to drop Gill and accommodate all-rounder Washington Sundar, aimed at strengthening the lower middle-order batting depth, drew criticism.However, Rohit clarified that the choice was not made solely by him.""Look, I had a chat with him. There's no way when you're leaving someone out, for whatever reason it is, you will have a chat. And the chat with him was clear that he was not dropped. We just wanted to have that extra bit of cushion in the bowling,"" Rohit said.""Hence, we opted for an all-rounder, which shouldn't weaken our batting line-up. Compromising a batter for a bowler was not something that I wanted to do.Gavaskar did mince his words when he was asked for his opinion during a discussion on Star Sports on Rohit's statement during the post-match press conference""How much bowling did you give to Washington Sundar? What cushion are you talking about? The requirement of the team is perfectly fine. You need to take decisions based on that, but you left him (Gill) out of the team, you can only call it dropped in whichever language you might speak,"" Gavaskar said.""You can say you omitted or dropped him, both are the same. Omit looks different, drop looks different, and left out looks different. I am talking about English but in the end, that guy was sitting in the dugout and was not on the ground,"" he added.Sundar bowled just 19 overs in the match, taking one wicket across two innings. With the bat, he contributed a responsible 50-run knock in India's first innings and remained unbeaten on five in the second.Chasing a target of 340 on the final day of the fourth Test, the Indian batters struggled once again, with only Yashasvi Jaiswal (84) standing out. The team fell short by 184 runs, resulting in a defeat and trailing 1-2 in the five-match series.",Shubman Gill was dropped by India for the fourth Test against Australia.

'ROHIT KNEW YASHASVI WAS INDIA’S FUTURE'

NEW DELHI: Disappointment and frustration were clearly visible on Yashasvi Jaiswal 's face as he fell victim to a controversial dismissal during the final session of day five in the Boxing Day Test at the MCG. The third umpire overturned the on-field not-out decision for a caught-behind, even though the Snickometer showed no edge.Yashasvi, who was anchoring the innings brilliantly and batting on 84, attempted to hook a bouncer from Australian skipper Pat Cummins . He missed the shot entirely, and wicketkeeper Alex Carey claimed the catch. While Carey and Cummins celebrated exuberantly, on-field umpire Joel Wilson initially ruled it not out. Cummins, however, immediately opted for a review.The Snickometer displayed a flat line as the ball passed the bat, regular replays showed a noticeable deflection. Third umpire Sharfuddoula ultimately declared Jaiswal out, to the batter’s disbelief.The decision sparked widespread debate among former cricketers and fans alike. However, Indian skipper Rohit Sharma addressed the controversy during the post-match press conference, seeking to put the matter to rest.""I don't know what to make of that because the technology didn't show anything, but with the naked eye it seemed like he did touch something,"" Rohit told reporters after the match.""I don't know how the umpires want to use the technology, but in all fairness, I think he did touch the ball,"" he said.Yashasvi's childhood coach, Jwala Singh, who was at the MCG to witness the high-stakes match, expressed his shock over the incident but said he found clarity after Rohit addressed the matter.""I was shocked, actually. The umpires took time to make that decision, and there was doubt. So, if there was doubt, the benefit of doubt should have been given to the batter. But if Rohit Sharma, the captain himself, said that there was a deflection or that the ball touched the bat or gloves, then Yashasvi is out. Because the captain knows better than anyone else. I will go with Rohit,"" Jwala told TimesofIndia.com in an exclusive interview.Jwala is well aware of Yashasvi's state of mind following the controversial dismissal but remains confident that Rohit, who has been a guiding figure throughout Yashasvi's career as a senior Mumbai teammate and now as India’s captain, will support the youngster through this challenging phase.""Rohit has given him a lot of opportunities and chances. Rohit has backed Yashasvi a lot. He has been his senior in the Mumbai team, and now he is the captain. Yashasvi has learned a lot from Rohit and continues to do so. Yashasvi was very disappointed, and any batter would be disappointed after such a decision. He needs to move on. Rohit will talk to him. Whenever Yashasvi is down or disappointed, Rohit is always there to motivate him and talk to him. He will ask him to move on. Not just Rohit, (Gautam) Gambhir also talks to him and motivates him. Rohit and Gambhir will help Yashasvi overcome this on-field disappointment,"" Jwala said.Yashasvi has been a standout performer in Tests in 2024, amassing 1,478 runs at an average of 54.74, including three centuries and nine fifties in 15 matches (including the MCG Test). His highest score this year was an unbeaten 214 against England.The youngster also surpassed Virender Sehwag’s 2008 tally of 1,462 runs to record the best calendar year for an Indian opener. He now ranks fourth on the all-time list for openers, topped by Graeme Smith’s 1,656 runs in 2008.Jwala recounted a story where Rohit had predicted Yashasvi's bright future for India.""I will share an incident when Yashasvi scored a double century in the Vijay Hazare Trophy some years back. Rohit was present there, and he appreciated Yashasvi and told everyone that this guy has got a bright future and will play for India. Yashasvi became emotional and worked really hard to reach this level. Rohit has always given Yashasvi a lot of support and helped him grow as an international cricketer,"" the coach said.""Yashasvi is a player to watch out for in the future. He was looking good, and I was confident he would take India to a draw or maybe even a win if he had good support from the other end. He was in good touch, but the controversial decision ended his innings. I am happy for him but also unhappy because he missed out on hundreds in both innings. He had a great opportunity to score centuries in both innings,"" he added.",Yashasvi Jaiswal was out for 84 on Day 5 of the Boxing Day Test at the MCG.

NEW DELHI: Former Indian cricketer Irfan Pathan has offered a blunt critique of Virat Kohli 's recent performances, particularly his persistent issues with shots outside the off-stump. Speaking on Star Sports after India's heavy 184-run defeat to Australia in the Boxing Day Test, Pathan highlighted Kohli's struggles as a key factor in India's underwhelming display.""Both the seniors (Rohit and Virat) did not meet expectations.They did not meet their own expectations at all. They are making mistakes,"" Pathan said, addressing the form of both Kohli and skipper Rohit Sharma Focusing on Kohli's long-standing tendency to chase deliveries outside the off-stump, Pathan expressed frustration over the lack of correction in the batter's technique.""The shot by Virat Kohli - this is neither the first nor the last time. He is not letting go of the temptation to drive outside the off-stump,"" Pathan remarked, adding that the issue has plagued Kohli for years.Pathan also questioned why Kohli, renowned for his off-field discipline and meticulous preparation, has struggled to bring the same focus to his batting.""We all talk about his discipline - why can't he bring that discipline onto the field?"" Pathan asked, highlighting a puzzling inconsistency in Kohli's approach.Kohli's scores of 36 and 5 in the first and second innings, respectively, were emblematic of India's broader batting failures as they fell to a 2-1 series deficit in the ongoing Border-Gavaskar Trophy .With just one Test remaining in Sydney, India face an uphill task to reclaim the series and maintain hopes of qualifying for the ICC World Test Championship Final.",Former Indian cricketer Irfan Pathan criticises Virat Kohli's recent performances.

Rohit Sharma: 'Virat Kohli is a modern day great. He will figure it out'

Rohit Sharma hit on knee during nets session at MCG

Melbourne: The number of runs Rohit Sharma has scored in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy (BGT) so far is one more than the number of wickets (30) Jasprit Bumrah has picked since landing in Australia last month. Three Tests, five innings, 31 runs. That's all Rohit has managed in the ongoing series, and barely has he managed to take his runs tally ahead of Bumrah's 30 wickets.While the statistic is good for the laughs and social media memes, on a serious note it is a sorry reflection of Rohit the batter. Not that he has come across as a tactically sound and proactive Test captain, but the extended lean patch has clearly and further deteriorated his decision-making.Rain saved India in Brisbane but proper five days of Test cricket at the MCG has served another stern reminder of why the Indian captain's time is up in the whites. While there are murmurs of conversations with BCCI top brass and selectors over retirement, it's understood that Rohit has already made up his mind.When and where the announcement happens is anybody's guess but it's highly unlikely that the Indian captain will continue after the BGT. Rohit would undoubtedly like to convince selectors to allow him to stay for the World Test Championship (WTC) final, should India pull off a miracle and make it there. However, if they don't, Sydney is destined to be Rohit's last dance.That bit is absolutely clear and selectors are already in the know of what's approaching. However, the bigger question at this stage is not about retirement but whether Rohit deserves to be in the Playing XI at all?The runs aren't coming. Even after a decent series vs England at home, the Test average in 2024 has been in the mid 20s and he has only scored two centuries and two half-centuries in the 14 Tests he has played.619 runs in 14 Tests would have pushed any batter out of the setup but Rohit, because of captaincy and reputation, has managed to hang on longer than he should have.Apart from the lack of runs, the experiments in Melbourne -- Rohit at top, KL Rahul at No. 3 and Shubman Gill on the bench -- did more harm than good and it's just delaying the transition and opportunities to the next generation of superstars.If you play Rohit in Sydney, the same batting order is likely to continue and it would mean Shubman Gill returns home after playing just three innings -- two of which had fluent starts. And KL Rahul continues to do something which he hasn't done often in his career -- bat at No.3.Australia have seen numerous Test retirements in the past but for India, more important than the retirement is the smooth transition. Many moons ago, MS Dhoni, a visionary leader, did just that when he retired midway through the series and handed over the reins to Virat Kohli.Will Rohit follow suit or wait for the ""why nots"" to get louder?",Rohit Sharma has scored 31 runs in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy (BGT) so far.

Getting physically fit and mentally ready for ILT20: MI Emirates skipper Nicholas Pooran

NEW DELHI: UAE off-spinning all-rounder Dhruv Parashar is aiming to present himself as a viable option to bowl in the powerplay overs for the Desert Vipers team in the upcoming ILT20 Season 3.With 12 out of his 18 senior international appearances involving bowling in the powerplays, Parashar has a credible case to make for this role.Parashar's approach to bowling in the powerplay is focused on bowling according to his field and forcing the batter to hit where he wants them to.He developed this method during his time as a net bowler with the Vipers in the previous season, where he had the opportunity to work with new balls and refine his skills.“I enjoy the challenge because there are not many spinners that bowl in the power play. My approach is that it is all about where I bowl the ball. I just make sure I bowl according to my field because we only (are allowed to) have two (fielders) outside the ring,"" Parashar told the Vipers Voices podcast.“No matter what I do, I just make sure I get the batter to hit me where I want him to hit me. That is my only goal. I keep it quite simple and it has been working, so I am just going to stick with that.”“I would take it back to a year ago when I started bowling with the new ball in the nets in ILT20 when I was there as a net bowler,” he added.“Because it is such a high-level tournament we got new balls for practice so I got the chance to work with them and the more I just bowled, I just developed a few things and worked stuff out that works for me. Then in the domestic games (afterwards) I kept bowling with the new ball, a couple of overs in the powerplay, and that is how it started for me (bowling at that stage of an innings).""Parashar's hard work paid off in the ICC Men's T20 World Cup Asia Qualifier B in Qatar, where he was the highest wicket-taker with an exceptional economy rate of 5.10 runs per over, helping the UAE clinch the title. This tournament boosted his confidence in bowling both in and out of the powerplay.“That tournament gave me a lot of confidence, not only in the power play, but also out of the power play too. And I was happy I was able to contribute. I think of it as my first proper achievement (at international level) in the grand scheme of things,” he explained.Rejoining the Vipers fold is a reward for Parashar's efforts, and he is excited to be back with the team he has a connection with. He credits the Vipers' bowling coach, Carl Crowe , for his guidance and support in his development as a spin bowler.“If I have any doubts, he (Carl) is the best person to seek help from about spin bowling . And he has helped me a lot,"" he continued.“It does not have to be major changes or anything like that. It is a lot of T20-specific stuff. There are skills, obviously, but there are the technical and tactical aspects of bowling and having someone like him around, who is really experienced, (is priceless) since he has been in all the leagues around in the world.“He has all the stats, he knows the mantra to success. So, I am really grateful that he has always been there the last few years and hopefully I continue to have a good relationship with him.”As a local player who grew up in the UAE, Parashar is a great fan of the ILT20 and believes it is having a transformative impact on cricket in the country.He sees it as a motivation for youngsters to break into one of the six franchises and hopes to inspire others through his participation.“I have been part of the tournament in some shape or form in all the three seasons now and it has really helped me personally, as a player, to grow,"" he opined.“And not only for me, but for all the youngsters in the UAE, it is a huge motivation (to break into one of the six franchises) because obviously, it is increasing awareness and popularity of cricket in the UAE because it is our own league, which is a proud thing for the country, and especially for UAE cricket and the Emirates Cricket Board .""Parashar is optimistic about the Desert Vipers' prospects for the upcoming season, aiming to win the trophy with their strong squad and management.“Obviously like any tournament and any team, we all need to go for winning the trophy. We want to become champions this time. And I think we have a very good squad and good management,” he concluded.","UAE off-spinning all-rounder Dhruv Parashar is aiming to bowl in the powerplay overs for the Desert Vipers team in the upcoming ILT20 Season 3. 12 out of his 18 senior international appearances involving bowling in thePowerplay have been for the UAE.

NEW DELHI: Nathan McSweeney remains optimistic about potentially succeeding Usman Khawaja in Australia's Test team, despite being dropped from the squad.McSweeney's initial Test experience came as an opener during the first three matches of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy against India. As Australia contemplates David Warner's replacement, they may soon need to address Khawaja's succession as well.With Khawaja, aged 38, suggesting the Ashes as his likely farewell series, McSweeney has expressed interest in stepping into the role.""I'd love to, there's no doubt about that. Ussie has been awesome, but when the opportunity comes - or if it does - I would love to do that. I haven't had heaps of time to think about it, to be honest, it all kind of happened fairly quickly, and then I was back here playing T20 cricket,"" McSweeney said, as quoted from The Sydney Morning Herald.""Those conversations will be had, and I've got to work out and speak with the selectors about where my opportunity may come and what I need to do to get back there. I'm flexible to bat wherever and wherever I see my role to, hopefully, one day again play Test cricket,"" he added.The 25-year-old's debut series proved challenging, scoring only 72 runs across six innings at an average of 14.40. Jasprit Bumrah particularly troubled McSweeney, dismissing him four times with an average of 3.75.Following these performances, selectors opted for Sam Konstas in the Boxing Day Test, resulting in McSweeney's exclusion from the squad.Despite this setback, McSweeney praised Konstas's performance against India's pace attack whilst maintaining confidence in his own abilities ahead of Australia's tour to Sri Lanka in January.""I think what I've done really well over the last couple of years is trusting my game and being able to bat long periods of time is where I've been able to make big runs. It's quite a unique game, and it's very individual at times,"" McSweeney said.""You've got your own way to go about it, and he [Konstas] obviously did it really well in that first innings. I think I've been able to play spin pretty well here in Australia over the last few years. It's a fair bit different over there ... [but] if I got the nod to go over there, I'd feel really confident in my game against spin,"" McSweeney added.","Nathan McSweeney remains optimistic about succeeding Usman Khawaja in Australia's Test team, despite being dropped from the squad.

NEW DELHI: Rohit Sharma faced wrath from fans and cricket pundits after he promoted himself to opening in the Boxing Day Test against Australia at MCG, a move that backfired miserably as the Indian captain's woeful run with the bat continued.Rohit has struggled, making only 31 runs from five innings, with scores of 3, 6, 10, 3, and 9, resulting in a dismal average of 6.20 - the lowest by a touring captain on Australian soil.Rohit's decision also led to KL Rahul being moved to number three, while Shubman Gill was dropped from the playing XI.Former India opener Aakash Chopra voiced his ire, highlighting that in the past, MS Dhoni and Virat Kohli made bold decisions to try Rohit as an opener in ODIs and Tests, respectively, in an effort to revive his career.""For the first time in his career, he has taken a call for himself. In the past, calls have been taken for him. MS Dhoni and Virat Kohli took calls for him to move him from middle-order to opener. Dhoni did in ODIs, Virat did in Tests because they wanted Rohit to fire,"" Aakash Chopra said on his YouTube show.Chopra emphasised that Rohit's call was totally in his own interests and not in the team's since dropping Gill and relegating Rahul to number three were not advantageous for India.""For the first time, captain Rohit took a call and it was totally in his interests. It was not in the team's interests. Let's be very honest. It can't be in the team's interests because Rahul was opening very well. Shubman Gill did well in 2023, he is the second-highest run-scorer. He has played in tough situations also. He was looking good in Adelaide too. But, he had to be dropped from the team,"" he added.""All this is because Rohit thought about himself, not in the best interests of the team. For the first time in his captaincy career. It didn't turn out fine.

Nitish Reddy reveals Virat Kohli’s special words for him after hundred at MCG

London: Liverpool moved a step closer to a record-equalling 20th English top-flight title as a 5-0 thrashing of West Ham opened up an eight-point lead at the top of the Premier League Luis Diaz , Cody Gakpo, Mohamed Salah , Trent Alexander-Arnold and Diogo Jota were on target for the rampant Reds in east London as they ended the year as huge favourites to deliver just a second league title in 35 years.Nottingham Forest are the surprise closest challengers in second, but Arsenal and Chelsea can close the gap when they are in action later in the week.Arne Slot has repeatedly stressed nothing can be won yet with Liverpool still one game shy of the halfway mark in the Premier League.But the Dutchman's succession of Jurgen Klopp continues to look flawless after a 23rd win in 27 matches in all competitions.""I enjoyed it a lot because it doesn't happen many times that I could just sit back and enjoy,"" said Slot.Diaz had been rested for the 3-1 win over Leicester on Boxing Day and it was the Colombian who opened the floodgates on 30 minutes at the London Stadium.His intended pass into Curtis Jones rebounded back into his path off a West Ham defender and he dispatched his shot low into the corner.Mohammed Kudus was inches away from an equaliser when his effort came back off the post.But another heavy home defeat puts Hammers boss Julen Lopetegui back under pressure after a four-game unbeaten run.""We are talking about the best team in the Premier League and around the world, but at home and in front of our fans, I am very sorry about this,"" said Lopetegui.Two goals in four minutes just before half-time killed the game as a contest.Salah's delightful turn helped tee up Gakpo to roll in his ninth goal in 14 games.The Egyptian then curled in at Alphonse Areola's near post, with some help from the West Ham goalkeeper, to hit the 20-goal mark for the eighth consecutive season since joining Liverpool in 2017.Speculation over Alexander-Arnold, Salah and Virgil van Dijk's futures has not derailed Liverpool's flying start under Slot.All three could discuss a move to a foreign club on a free transfer next season within days, but remain focused for the moment on winning a second Premier League title together.""The only thing in my mind is that I want Liverpool to win the league and I want to be part of it,"" said Salah.""That is the only thing I have focused on. I will do my best to win the trophy. We are in the right direction but there are other teams trying to catch up with us. We just need to stay humble and go again.""Rumours over Alexander-Arnold's potential move to Real Madrid have resurfaced again in the Spanish media over the past week and the England international showed why he is a man in demand with a thunderous strike that deflected in off Max Kilman.Jota's appearance as a substitute was further evidence of the extra firepower Liverpool enjoy over their title rivals.The Portuguese set the seal on a dominant win with the finish for the fifth goal, but had another sumptuous Salah assist to thank for it.Salah jinked his way beyond three West Ham defenders before laying the ball to Jota for his 13th Premier League assist of the season to go with 17 goals in 18 games.","Liverpool thrash West Ham 5-0 at the London Stadium. Luis Diaz, Cody Gakpo, Mohamed Salah, Trent Alexander-Arnold and Diogo Jota on target.

NEW DELHI: Pep Guardiola 's Manchester City secured a much-needed 2-0 victory over Leicester City on Sunday, ending a run of eight away games without a win.The victory provided some relief for the crisis-hit English champions , who have been struggling with a remarkable slump in form.The first half saw City take the lead through Savinho's strike, but Leicester squandered several chances to equalize, with Jamie Vardy and James Justin missing golden opportunities.After the break, Erling Haaland doubled City's lead with a powerful header, scoring his 19th goal of the season and ending his four-game goal drought.Despite the win, City's performance was still far from the standards they have set in recent years, having won an unprecedented four consecutive English top-flight titles.However, the celebrations after Haaland's goal showed that the three points were all that mattered for the visitors, temporarily halting their slump.The victory lifted City to fifth place in the Premier League table, but they remain 11 points behind leaders Liverpool , who have two games in hand. For Leicester, the defeat leaves them rooted in the bottom three, adding to their struggles this season.While City's performance was not at their usual level, the win provides a much-needed boost for Guardiola's side as they look to regain their form and mount a challenge for the title. However, with Liverpool's lead and games in hand, City face an uphill battle to defend their crown.","Manchester City beat Leicester City 2-0 on Sunday.

Lautaro back in the goals

Atalanta kept hold of top spot in Serie A on Saturday after escaping Lazio with a 1-1 draw which kept Inter Milan at bay but ended their club-record league winning streak at 11 matches.Marco Brescianini tapped home into an open goal with two minutes remaining to snatch a point from the Stadio Olimpico in Rome, where a passionate crowd thought a big win was coming their way.Instead Atalanta will end a historic year a point ahead of Inter, who have a game in hand, after the champions briefly drew level on points with a 3-0 win earlier at Cagliari .Europa League holders Atalanta will lead the league even if Napoli beat Venezia on Sunday and draw level on 41 points with Gian Piero Gasperini 's side who have a significantly better goal difference than the 2023 champions.Should two teams finish level at the top of Serie A come the end of the season they will face off in a single match to decide the destination of the Scudetto, which Atalanta have never won.""We struggled for long periods in the first half, but we were much better in the second,"" said Atalanta coach Gasperini.""This year has been the best year in Atalanta's history, let's hope we can make 2025 the same.""Atalanta showed great character to battle back from Fisayo Dele-Bashiru's 27th-minute goal which came in an intense opening period from Lazio.The away side were initially blitzed by Lazio, with Marco Carnesecchi making two sensational stops before Matteo Guendouzi curled a great strike off the post in the 11th minute.But as the match wore on, Atalanta, who were without injured star striker Mateo Retegui, grew into the game and deservedly drew level in front of a boisterous and hostile crowd in the Italian capital.Brescianini netted his third goal of the season thanks largely to Ademola Lookman, who made up for earlier missing from yards out by beating Lazio's offside trap, meeting Nicolo Zaniolo's hooked pass and rolling across to his teammate to salvage a precious point.Next up, Atalanta travel to play the Italian Super Cup in Saudi Arabia, where they will face Inter on Thursday.Lautaro Martinez ended an eight-match scoring drought at Cagliari, netting the second in an engaging contest in Sardinia which Inter won with second-half goals from the Argentina striker, Alessandro Bastoni and Hakan Calhanoglu.Inter have won their last five in Italy's top flight, scoring 19 and conceding just once, a burst in form which has re-established Inter as favourites to retain the Scudetto.The only thing missing for Inter were goals from captain Martinez, who hadn't scored since November 3 before he prodded home Nicolo Barella's cross in the 71st minute on Saturday.""The most important thing is that Inter win. If I get a goal too, then that's a bonus,"" said Martinez.""We work hard every day to win trophies and anyone who sets foot on the pitch will give their all for the team. We've just got to keep going and make 2025 like this year.""Inter could have won by an even more convincing margin had captain Martinez not wasted great chances in each half and Cagliari goalkeeper Simone Scuffet not pulled off superb saves to deny Marcus Thuram and Barella.But Martinez did net his seventh goal this season in all competitions and seven minutes later Calhanoglu made absolutely sure of the points from the penalty spot.Cagliari are just inside the relegation zone after a fourth consecutive defeat for Davide Nicola's side, a point behind Verona and Como who both play on Monday.",Atalanta draw 1-1 with Lazio at Stadio Olimpico in Rome.

NEW DELHI: 22-year-old Ivory Coast forward Amad Diallo has expressed his determination to ""make history"" with Manchester United despite the club's recent struggles under new manager Ruben Amorim .United have lost five out of Amorim's first 10 games in charge across all competitions, with recent defeats to Wolves, Bournemouth, and Tottenham increasing the pressure on the Portuguese manager ahead of Newcastle's visit to Old Trafford.Despite the team's dismal form, which has seen them languish in 14th place in the Premier League , just eight points above the relegation zone , Diallo has been one of United's few bright spots.He scored a late winner in the recent derby against Manchester City and has contributed two goals and six assists in the league this season.Diallo, along with other young players like Alejandro Garnacho, Kobbie Mainoo, Joshua Zirkzee, and Rasmus Hojlund, has set his sights on taking United back to the top.""We are part of the project, we have so many young players for this club, especially Garna (Alejandro Garnacho), Kobbie (Mainoo), Joshua (Zirkzee), Rasmus (Hojlund), me, we are young players who want to make history for this club,"" Diallo told MUTV.""We want to do our best every game. Sometimes it cannot work, but you can see in the pitch we are very focused to do our best for this club, because we want to bring back this club to the level it was before.""So, for the young lads, we just have to keep going, work hard and the most important thing is to listen to the old men, the old players, learn every day.""We have now a new manager, he likes to work with young players, and he brings a new system, so we just have to follow it and try to do our best every game.""""In football this can happen,"" he added.

NEW DELHI: Pep Guardiola has affirmed his commitment to Manchester City , dismissing speculation about his departure amidst the club's recent struggles.Guardiola recently extended his contract for two more years.Despite City's current poor form, Guardiola is determined to remain at the Etihad Stadium. The team has experienced a significant dip in performance, losing nine out of their last thirteen matches.The slump has led to questions about Guardiola's future with the club. Some have suggested he might leave if he can't reverse the team's fortunes.However, Guardiola, who has guided City to six Premier League titles in seven seasons, insisted he remains motivated to turn things around.""I will try, I will keep going. Sometimes you think the bad run will be ended earlier or it would be easier to fix it, but it takes more time,"" he said.""I will not give up. I want to be here. I want to do it and, with the situation that we have, we have to do it.""Of course I want it, everyone wants it. I don't want to disappoint my people in terms of the club, the fans, the people who love this club.""I think all of us in our job want to do it well and please the people. That is undeniable, not a question mark.""The biggest test is to come back again, but we have done that before.""Injuries have significantly hampered City's performance, contributing to their current seventh-place standing in the Premier League. Key players have been sidelined due to various injuries.Rodri, the Ballon d'Or winner, is recovering from a long-term knee injury. Other key players, including Ruben Dias, John Stones, Ederson, Kyle Walker, Jack Grealish, and Matheus Nunes, missed the recent draw against Everton.Even Erling Haaland, typically a prolific goal scorer, has struggled recently. He missed a penalty in the Everton match, extending his recent goal drought.Haaland has scored only once in his last seven games, but Guardiola refused to single him out for criticism. He emphasized his philosophy of not assigning blame to individual players.""I don't have it in my education to start complaining, to point at people. It's happened, it's life, it's football, so let's try it again,"" he said.""That's why we have had success, because always it is never enough, we will try it again and again and again. That's why we won a lot of titles.""Every three days it was a game and win, win, win for many, many months and years. Now we have to do the same when results are not good.""As City prepares to face Leicester City, several players are still recovering from injuries. Guardiola acknowledged the impact of injuries on the team's performance.""Sometimes you have injuries,"" Guardiola said. ""For how many years we were incredibly consistent but now, yes, we're a little bit down and the main reason is having so many important players injured.""But I saw the team spirit, how we trained this week, how focused they are, how they try to practise.""","Guardiola recently extended his contract for two more years.

It marked an unusual position for Germany, who often relied on deciding mixed doubles matches in last year’s tournament.""This is the first time we've ever been up 2-0,"" Zverev said.

Machac and Muchova capitalized, defeating Viktor Durasovic and Ulrikke Eikeri 6-4, 6-4 to secure the Czech Republic’s win.""You kind of hope that it won't be that tough, but what a way to start the new season,"" said Ruud, who banked 2024 tournament wins at Geneva and Barcelona.""If every match is going to be this tough, it's going to be a tough (season).""Ruud’s concern may grow as he faced nine break points during the match, despite his early control in the third set.","World number two Alexander Zverev and Laura Siegemund secure victory over Brazil.

Naomi Osaka , a four-time Grand Slam champion , has stated that she won't remain in professional tennis if her performance doesn't meet her expectations. The 27-year-old Japanese player is scheduled to compete in the ASB Classic in Auckland on Monday. This marks her return to competition since a back injury forced her out of the China Open in October.During a pre-tournament press conference in Auckland on Sunday, Osaka discussed her 2024 season. She described feeling ""humbled"" by her performance after returning to professional tennis following a nearly 15-month break for the birth of her child. She finished the year ranked 58th.“I don't think I'm the type of player that would hang around.”Osaka addressed her future in the sport. She expressed respect for her fellow players but indicated she wouldn't continue playing if she couldn't maintain a certain ranking.“I have a lot of respect for all the players on tour, but the point of my life that I'm at right now, if I'm not above a certain ranking, I don't see myself playing for a while.”She explained that she would prioritize spending time with her daughter if she couldn't achieve her desired level of performance.“I'd rather spend time with my daughter if I'm not where I think I should be and where I feel like I can be.”Osaka's 2024 season saw a 22-17 win-loss record in singles matches. She reached the quarterfinals in Doha and s-Hertogenbosch.“I think 2024 humbled me, but I also feel like I grew a lot.”Osaka reflected on the challenges and growth she experienced during the 2024 season. She acknowledged the difficulty of not achieving her desired results despite her increased efforts.“I worked way harder than I've ever worked before. So in that, I guess it was very painful to not get the results I wanted, but I feel like I'm growing and learning and I am really excited for this year (2025).”She highlighted some positive moments from the past year, including a memorable match against Iga Swiatek at the French Open , which she lost 7-6, 1-6, 7-5.“I played really good matches. People still talk to me about my Iga (Swiatek) match at the French Open (lost 7-6 1-6 7-5). So I'm glad that I was able to give people memories as well.”Osaka also expressed optimism about her performance before her injury in Beijing, her last tournament of 2024, where she was playing against Coco Gauff . She anticipates playing on hard courts again.“Even though I got injured in Beijing, which was my last tournament, I feel pretty optimistic about how that match would have turned out (against Coco Gauff) and I am excited to play on hardcourt again.”Osaka has won the Australian Open twice (2019 and 2021) and the US Open twice (2018 and 2020). She affirmed her continued passion for tennis despite recent setbacks due to injuries.“I've been playing tennis since I was three, and a huge part of that I owe to my parents, but I never really saw my life doing anything else.”Osaka spoke about her lifelong involvement with tennis, attributing much of it to her parents' influence. She realized her deep love for the sport after exploring other possibilities.“Then, when I sat there and had the opportunity to do other things, I realized that I'd rather be playing tennis.”This realization reinforced her commitment to tennis.“So it was kind of one of those realization moments where you feel like you thought you were forced to do something, but in actuality you very much truly loved it.”Osaka's first-round opponent at the ASB Classic will be Lina Glushko of Israel.",Naomi Osaka is scheduled to compete in the ASB Classic in Auckland on Monday.

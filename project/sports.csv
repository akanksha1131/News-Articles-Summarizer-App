Gautam Gambhir Press Conference: Team India head coach heaves fire after 2-1 ODI series win over SA

India's head coach Gautam Gambhir has strongly dismissed social media discussions about split coaching during a Saturday press conference. He expressed surprise at these theories and advised commentators to maintain their boundaries.The debate emerged following India's recent 0-2 Test series loss to South Africa. Several cricket personalities, including an IPL team owner, suggested to BCCI about having separate coaches for red-ball and white-ball formats.""Look, there were a lot of talks because the results didn't go in our favour. But the most surprising thing is that not once did any media or journalist wrote that our first Test match was played without the captain, who didn't bat in both innings,"" Gambhir said during the post-match press meet after India clinched the ODI series against SA 2-1.Gambhir emphasised that certain individuals were making comments unrelated to on-field cricket matters.""Some people also said things that have nothing to do with cricket. An IPL team owner also wrote about split coaching. So this is surprising. It's very important for people to stay in their domain. Because if we don't go into someone's domain, then they also don't have the right to come into our domain,"" Gambhir added.During the post-match conference in Guwahati, Gambhir addressed his achievements as the red-ball coach following the home series defeat.""I don't give excuses in press conferences. It doesn't mean that you don't show the facts in front of the world or the country. When you go through a transition and when you lose your captain, who is also your main batter in red-ball cricket against such a team.""""Then obviously the results are difficult because you don't have that much experience in red ball cricket. And the surprising thing is that no one even talked about it. All the discussions about wickets, I don't know what all things were said,"" he noted.He highlighted that captain Shubman Gill's absence due to a neck injury during both innings of the first Test in Kolkata was largely overlooked in media discussions.","Gautam Gambhir has strongly dismissed social media discussions about split coaching.

"“He knows not what he is doing”: Tammy, Russell Wilson’s mother, torches Trevone Boykin over ‘weird’ Thanksgiving story",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/he-knows-not-what-he-is-doing-tammy-russell-wilsons-mother-torches-trevone-boykin-over-weird-thanksgiving-story/articleshow/125806772.cms,"Tammy Wilson defends Russell Wilson after Trevone Boykin’s resurfaced Thanksgiving story draws new criticism. (Image via Getty Images)

Tammy Wilson calls out Trevone Boykin and clears up the Thanksgiving timeline

Russell Wilson’s rough Giants year, his family legacy, and why this clapback landed

Russell Wilson is having one of the toughest seasons of his career with the New York Giants, and somehow his Thanksgiving guest list ended up on the internet too. Former teammate Trevone Boykin recently went on a podcast and called a holiday dinner at Wilson’s house “weird” because the quarterback’s family was not there, which quickly turned into another round of think-pieces about Wilson’s personality and home life.This time, Wilson did not have to say anything. His mother, Tammy Wilson, logged on instead. In a string of viral comments on social media, she shut down Boykin’s version of events, defended her son, and reminded everyone that the Wilson family is not hurting for money or history.Boykin’s story has been making the rounds since late November. On his podcast appearance, he described a Thanksgiving at Wilson and Ciara’s home as the “weirdest feeling,” said the dinner was catered, and highlighted that none of Wilson’s family was there. He added that if he had Wilson’s money and airline connections, he would have flown everyone in.Once the clip hit social media, a familiar script followed. People questioned whether Wilson was close to his family and used a nine-year-old holiday to paint a picture of him as distant or out of touch.Tammy Wilson stepped into the comments and made it clear she was done watching strangers and former teammates dissect her son. In a comment captured by outlets like The Shade Room and others, she wrote:“I am his mom. It is none of your business. This is opportunistic I am so tired of you men cutting down my son.Jesus said, to all accusing the woman, ‘he who is without sin cast the 1st stone.’ Part of our family was in Fla at a tournament. I stayed planned to stay home bc I wanted to fast the 4 days before year end. Russ thought enough of you, who has a criminal history, to love you enough to invite you over. This why Russ keeps it moving. Folks not trustworthy. Russ though will forgive, but not again. I hope you felt relevant for a few minutes. Lord forgive him for he know not what he is doing.”Then she went back and added one more line that turned into a meme on its own: “and we got our own money.”Separate reporting has also clarified what Boykin left out. The Thanksgiving he was talking about was not from this season. The dinner was from 2016, when the Wilson family was in Florida supporting Anna Wilson and Stanford women’s basketball at a holiday tournament. Tammy’s explanation matches that timeline and helps explain why much of the family was not at the house that night.Boykin has his own off-field history, including past domestic assault allegations that ended his time with the Seattle Seahawks. Seattle released him in 2018.Tammy did not spell that out in a press conference. She did it in a comment box, directly under a post about her son, and made it clear that inviting him into their home was an act of grace that will not be repeated.All of this is happening while Russell Wilson is already under a microscope on the field. The Giants are 2-11 heading into their Week 14 bye, and Wilson has slid down the depth chart to QB3 behind starter Jaxson Dart and backup Jameis Winston. His future as a starting quarterback is already in question, and he has even dipped his toe into broadcasting with a guest spot on “The NFL Today” earlier this season.Off the field, he is in a different kind of headline. Wilson and Ciara just listed their Rancho Santa Fe estate in California for $54.9 million, a price that could set a residential record in San Diego County if they get anywhere near the ask. The couple bought the nine-acre property for $14.5 million in 2021 and turned it into “Amor Estate,” a 30,000-square-foot Mediterranean compound with a private football field, recording studio, full gym, and a long list of luxury amenities.That is the backdrop for Tammy’s final flex about having their “own money.” It is not a random brag. It ties back to a family that has stacked degrees, leadership roles, and real estate for decades. Her late husband, Harrison Wilson III, built his own path in law and sports. Russell’s grandfather, Dr. Harrison B. Wilson Jr., spent 22 years as president of Norfolk State University.So when Boykin implies that the absence of extended relatives at one catered Thanksgiving says something about Russell’s character or his relationship with his family, Tammy is not just defending a quarterback. She is defending a legacy and pushing back on a narrative that has followed her son for most of his career, where every story about him being “different” or “corny” becomes an easy punchline.The public reaction shows why her post hit so hard. Fans on social media quickly shifted from dissecting Wilson’s dinner menu to praising his mother for speaking plainly, quoting her lines back to each other, and calling out Boykin for talking about a private invite years after the fact.There is no scheme or film breakdown here. It is simple. Wilson opened his doors, Boykin went public with his opinion about the vibe, and Tammy Wilson decided that would be the last time someone tried to get clicks by dragging her son’s name into a holiday story.If there is a takeaway from this week, it is that Russell Wilson might be QB3 in New York right now, but his mother is still first-team when it comes to pass protection online.Furthermore, Tammy Wilson’s response highlighted the larger story behind Russell Wilson’s upbringing, shaped by parents who built their household on faith, education, and service. Wilson has often credited his late father, Harrison Wilson III, a Dartmouth graduate, former college athlete, and later a lawyer in Virginia, for that foundation, according to People. His mother, Tammy, has spent decades as a registered nurse focused on patient outreach and hospital care management, including critical work during the COVID-19 pandemic.Wilson has even explored his lineage publicly on Finding Your Roots with Henry Louis Gates Jr., where he learned that his family’s history stretches across Africa and includes ancestors who fought for freedom and voting rights in the 19th century. “To know where you’re going, you have to know where you came from,” Wilson said on the show.Russell Wilson has a real shot to flip the narrative this Sunday as he steps into the CBS Sports studio as a guest analyst. With the New York Giants on a bye week and his future in the league uncertain, the 37-year-old quarterback, benched for the first time in his 14-year career, has little to lose and everything to gain. Known for his overly polished image and often flat delivery, Wilson could use this opportunity to finally show a more authentic, insightful side. He’s played under three Super Bowl-winning coaches, bounced between four teams, and carries a decade of league experience. more than enough to offer meaningful commentary if he’s willing to speak candidly. If he delivers, he could land a post-retirement role in broadcasting and end his NFL chapter with something better than just a whimper.","Trevone Boykin said a Thanksgiving dinner at Russell Wilson's house was 'weird' because his family was not there. Wilson's mother, Tammy, responded in a string of viral comments on social media. She defended her son, and reminded everyone that the Wilson family is not hurting for money or history.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125806797,imgsize-100094,width-400,resizemode-4/tammy-wilson-defends-russell-wilson-trevone-boykin-thanksgiving-comments.jpg"

NEW DELHI: After India’s nine-wicket win over South Africa in Visakhapatnam sealed the ODI series 2-1, a light-hearted moment between Virat Kohli and Arshdeep Singh that quickly went viral.As players celebrated the comprehensive victory, Arshdeep jokingly told Kohli, “Few runs short, otherwise another century was confirmed for you.”Kohli instantly fired back, laughing, “It was good we won the toss, otherwise you would have also completed your century due to the dew!”The exchange reflected the relaxed aura around the Indian camp, especially with Kohli back at his dominant best.Kohli finished the series as the leading run-scorer with 302 runs, following hundreds in the first two games and an unbeaten 65 in the finale.More importantly for him, the innings symbolised a mental shift.“Honestly, playing the way I have in the series is the most satisfying thing for me.

Shimron Hetmyer interview: Opens up on hitting sixes, playing T20 leagues and ILT20 experience

NEW DELHI: Australia powered to an eight-wicket win in the day-night second Test against England on Sunday to take a 2-0 lead in the Ashes series. England resumed day four on 134-6, trailing by 43 runs, before Ben Stokes (50) and Will Jacks (41) helped set a target of 65. Australia completed the chase with Steve Smith hitting a six to finish the match ahead of the third Test in Adelaide on December 17.During Australia’s chase, there was an exchange of words between Steve Smith and England fast bowler Jofra Archer . The incident took place when Smith came out to bat in the eighth over after Gus Atkinson dismissed Marnus Labuschagne.Jofra Archer at the other end was bowling around 150 kph (93 mph) under the lights and it only fired up Smith.He came in to bowl the next over and started with a short-of-length delivery outside off. Smith went on the back foot and pulled through mid-wicket for four off the middle of the bat.Archer followed with a 149kph bouncer. Smith leaned back and attempted an upper cut with deep third in, but missed. Archer had a go at Smith and Smith responded. He missed and gestured that he should have got it to the third-man fence, then turned around to see Archer having a go. Smith said to Archer: ""You Bowl fast when there's nothing going on, Champion"".The third ball of the over brought more drama. Archer bowled at 149.4kph and Smith pulled off the back foot, getting a top-edge and possibly glove as it flew over keeper Jamie Smith for four.Archer had a few words for Smith, who did not respond this time.On the next ball, Archer bowled at 150.5kph. It was a short delivery down the leg. Smith got inside the line and pulled. The ball went wide of fine-leg and flew into the crowd for six. Archer gave a wry smile and turned back to his mark without more words. Smith made a gesture with his hand towards Archer.After the match, both shook hands. ""What was said stays on the field, good banter, He's (Archer) a good competitor, and he comes hard at you,"" Smith said after the match.","Australia beat England by eight wickets to take a 2-0 lead in the Ashes series.

Former India batting coach Sanjay Bangar said Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma should be viewed differently because of their record in ODI cricket, and their place in the team should not have been questioned. He said this while speaking to JioStar.There has been speculation that selectors and head coach Gautam Gambhir may be unsure about the senior players’ form and fitness till the 2027 World Cup. But Kohli and Rohit have scored three centuries — two by Kohli — and five half-centuries — three by Rohit — in their last six ODIs.""I don't think the place of Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma in the team should have been a question. Look at what they have done over so many years,"" Bangar said.Bangar said ODIs are played less often now, so established players may need a couple of matches to settle in, and Kohli and Rohit have earned that space because of their work for India.""They have retired from two formats, so it's obvious they might take just a couple of sessions to get back into action, because they have done it so often. They don't need to play as many matches as a younger player.""""Once they are there, once they are hungry and fit, you want players of that quality.You have to treat them differently and give them space,"" Bangar said.In the ODI series against South Africa, Rohit Sharma, 38, scored 57 and 75 in the first and third matches.

Their sheer presence changes the dressing room atmosphere.""Bangar, who has worked with Kohli at RCB and overseen his batting sessions, said the senior players likely spoke to the younger members after the Test series loss to South Africa.""After the humiliating loss in the Test series, they must have spoken to the boys.

Former Indian cricket opener Murali Vijay has praised former captain MS Dhoni's enduring legacy in cricket. He emphasised Dhoni's natural leadership qualities and instinctive decision-making, particularly highlighting the memorable 2007 T20 World Cup final over given to Joginder Sharma.MS Dhoni, who now exclusively plays in the Indian Premier League (IPL), will continue with Chennai Super Kings (CSK) for the 2026 season. Murali Vijay's connection with Dhoni spans eight IPL seasons at CSK under his leadership.Vijay shared his thoughts about Dhoni during an appearance on Taruwar Kohli's YouTube channel, where he discussed Dhoni's hitting acumen and mental fortitude.""Dhoni is natural and very unique. Those personalities you cannot replicate. Anybody cannot come and do what he is doing. The way he has dominated and taken the game, he was a very strong person. The way he launched those sixes, I don't think anyone else got that range as a right-hander,"" the former batter said.""He gave that last over to Joginder, and we won it. There may not have been logic as Harbhajan had an over as a senior. But it won us the cup as he did something out of the box. We all should be proud that he was born in our country.""Murali Vijay's international cricket journey began in 2008 when he stepped in for Gautam Gambhir in the final Test against Australia in Nagpur. His career encompassed 87 international matches across formats, including 61 Tests, 17 ODIs, and 9 T20Is.His final international appearance was against Australia in Perth in 2018.

Poll Do you think Crystal Palace will qualify for the Champions League this season? Yes No

Crystal Palace’s stunning Premier League surge continued on Sunday as they climbed into fourth place with a 2-1 win over Fulham, while Brighton struck in stoppage-time to deny West Ham a vital escape from the relegation zone in a 1-1 draw.At Craven Cottage, Marc Guehi was the hero for Palace, powering home an 87th-minute header that sealed their fourth win in six league outings. The late strike pushed Oliver Glasner’s side above Chelsea and Everton, strengthening what has now become a genuine bid for Champions League qualification.It marks yet another milestone in a remarkable period for the formerly unfancied south London club, who have already celebrated a shock FA Cup triumph over Manchester City last season and lifted the Community Shield against Liverpool earlier this term. They are also pushing through the UEFA Conference League group phase and could soon be preparing for a dream European upgrade.Palace struck first in the 20th minute when Adam Wharton’s smart through ball found Eddie Nketiah, who drilled home past Bernd Leno. Fulham levelled in the 38th minute through Harry Wilson’s stunning outside-of-the-boot finish. Emile Smith Rowe briefly thought he had completed the comeback, but his close-range effort was ruled out after VAR spotted a marginal offside by Samuel Chukwueze.Palace punished that reprieve with Guehi’s decisive finish from a corner.“It makes me proud because the team did not want to defend the draw, we wanted to win and that’s why we got it,” Glasner said, hailing his side’s belief and resilience.Meanwhile, at the Amex Stadium, West Ham were seconds from climbing out of the relegation zone after Jarrod Bowen fired them ahead in the 73rd minute. But Georginio Rutter’s scrappy stoppage-time effort rescued a point for seventh-placed Brighton, keeping them in the European chase while leaving West Ham in 18th place.Manager Nuno Espirito Santo was furious after VAR allowed the equaliser to stand. “It’s hard to take,” Nuno said. “Everybody saw it. We cannot understand how they gave the goal.” Despite the frustration, West Ham’s improved form — one defeat in six — continues to fuel hope for survival.",Crystal Palace moved into fourth place with a 2-1 win over Fulham.

Liverpool coach Arne Slot was still processing Liverpool’s latest setback at Leeds when Mohamed Salah criticised him and the club’s management in a post-match interaction, raising questions about whether his time at Anfield (home ground of Liverpool FC) is coming to an end.Liverpool, the Premier League champions, are dealing with a poor run of four wins in 15 matches across competitions and now face the possibility of a difficult split with one of their most successful players.Only Ian Rush and Roger Hunt have scored more goals for the club than Salah, who has 250. The forward contributed to two league titles, including last season, when he won multiple individual awards as Slot secured the league in his first year.Salah has now said his relationship with Slot has broken down after being kept on the bench for three straight matches.""I'm very, very disappointed to be fair. I have done so much for this club down the years and especially last season,"" Salah told media. ""Now I'm sitting on the bench and I don't know why. It seems like the club has thrown me under the bus. That is how I am feeling. I think it is very clear that someone wanted me to get all of the blame.""Slot had backed Salah through the season despite the 33-year-old struggling for form. Salah has scored five goals in 19 games and has been criticised by pundits for not contributing defensively.Salah and Liverpool were already preparing for a temporary break, with the player set to join Egypt for the Africa Cup of Nations after fixtures against Inter Milan and Brighton this week.Salah suggested the Brighton match could be his last at Anfield.""I’m going to enjoy that game because I don’t know what is going to happen now,"" he said.""I will be at Anfield to say goodbye to the fans and go to the Africa cup.

Ferran Torres netted a hat-trick, Lamine Yamal scored from the penalty spot, and Roony Bardghji impressed in a rare start as Barcelona stormed back to beat Real Betis 5-3 in La Liga on Saturday. The victory over fifth-placed Betis in Seville stretched Barcelona’s lead to four points over Real Madrid ahead of their home match against Celta Vigo on Sunday.Once a rotation option, Torres has evolved into Hansi Flick’s first-choice striker. The Spain forward now has more starts than Robert Lewandowski, whose playing time at 37 is being managed carefully. Torres leads Barcelona’s scoring charts with 13 goals — 11 in La Liga — trailing only Real Madrid’s Kylian Mbappé, who has 16 in the league.Bardghji made the most of his third start since joining from Copenhagen in the summer. The 20-year-old Sweden winger dazzled with sharp dribbling and provided the assist for Torres’ go-ahead goal before smashing home Barcelona’s third from just inside the box.Lewandowski and Raphinha stayed on the bench, leaving both fresh for Tuesday’s Champions League clash against Eintracht Frankfurt.Betis took the lead early through Anthony in the sixth minute, but Barcelona replied almost instantly.Torres slipped in behind the defence to tap in a pass from Jules Koundé, then added another just two minutes later with a spectacular volley from Bardghji’s cross. Bardghji’s strike in the 31st minute made it 3-1, before Torres completed his hat-trick 40 minutes in with a deflected effort.In a tactical shift, Yamal played centrally rather than in his usual right-wing role. The teenager linked well in midfield and helped create the first goal before calmly converting a penalty in the 59th minute after Marcus Rashford’s effort struck the outstretched arm of Marc Bartra.Betis pulled goals back late through Diego Llorente and a Cucho Hernández penalty after Koundé fouled Abde. Rashford nearly added a sixth for Barcelona on a solo break but dragged his shot wide.Manuel Pellegrini’s Betis entered the match in strong form after beating rivals Sevilla and going eight games unbeaten. They could drop a place if Espanyol secure at least a draw against Rayo Vallecano on Sunday.Barcelona midfielder Fermín López returned as a second-half substitute after missing two matches with a leg injury.Tajon Buchanan and Georges Mikautadze scored as Villarreal beat Getafe 2-0 to stay third, one point behind Madrid.In the Basque derby, Alavés stunned Real Sociedad with a 1-0 win.","Ferran Torres scored a hat-trick as Barcelona beat Real Betis 5-3 in La Liga.

Arsenal's Premier League title hopes suffered a setback as Aston Villa secured a 2-1 victory with Emiliano Buendia's stoppage-time winner on Saturday.

This turnaround came after a challenging start under Unai Emery, where they failed to win their first five games.""At the minute we're on a great run,"" said Matty Cash, who scored Villa's opener in the 36th. ""We know it's not even Christmas yet, so we have to keep being demanding, keep being consistent, and then we'll see where it takes us.""Arsenal's substitute Leandro Trossard equalized seven minutes into the second half.Buendia, who entered the game in the 87th minute, proved to be a game-changing substitution by scoring past Arsenal goalkeeper David Raya.""We fight until the last minute, the last second, it was a really incredible win,"" he said.This marked only Arsenal's second defeat of the season, their first since losing 1-0 to Liverpool in August.""We were 18 games unbeaten, and yet still the margin is so small,"" Arteta said.

Drawn with Uzbekistan, a qualifier and Colombia in Group K:""I think contenders is the right word. But I think the favorites are the teams that have won the World Cup before because there is a psychological aspect... I think we have to grow still, but we are full of hope and excitement.""The 1966 team of Eusebio is the reference point for us... We have won the European Championship and the Nations League and now I think it is very important that we should be able to fight for the dream we all have, to do something we have never done before.""On Cristiano Ronaldo's longevity: ""I think the secret he has is that he works every day as if it were the last day of his career... He never loses his hunger, he is an example for all of us. He is our captain, a reference for us, and very important for us.""Walid Regragui, coach of Morocco. Drawn with Brazil, Scotland and Haiti in Group C.""We're playing against one of the favorites (Brazil) right from the start, and they are playing one of the favorites right from the start,"" a confident Regragui said of Morocco's opening match against the five-time World Cup winners.""Whatever happens, Brazil remain Brazil. They are always potential winners. Having one of the potential winners in our group, and to play them in the first game, is never easy. They have picked up one of best coaches in the world (Carlo Ancelotti) with lots of experience -- he will give them serenity. We will try to be up to the task to make our fans proud.""Steve Clarke, coach of Scotland. Drawn with Brazil, Morocco and Haiti in Group C:""Brazil are an institution, if you like, they are one of the top teams. You always want to play against Brazil, so we have the chance to do that and I am pretty sure we will give them a good game.""It will be a tough game as always -- it will be (the) third game in the group. Hopefully we (will) have some points in the bag before we play them, but to get to a World Cup for a country like Scotland, it has taken us a long time to get back here -- 1998 was the last time, so we were determined to get there and do well... Every game in the World Cup is special –- we don't get there very often so every game is special for us.""Bubista, coach of first-time qualifiers Cape Verde. Drawn with Spain, Saudi Arabia and Uruguay in Group H:""We want to show people who we are (and) play with heart, a good attitude and a lot of humility. It is not a matter of being afraid of Spain. I am pleased to be playing against Spain because I played in Spain for (club side) Badajoz. It is just about enjoying the game, against a team we obviously need to be very wary of.""It means a lot for us, for our country –- everyone will be watching. Our country will be better known around the world... We won our qualifying group and we are very proud to be in our first World Cup.""Dick Advocaat, coach of Curacao, also making their World Cup debut. Drawn with Germany,Ivory Coast and Ecuador in Group E:""Three difficult teams for us but in principle every game is difficult. It is exciting to play there at the highest level and we will see what we can do.""One thing is that we have a team with a lot of fighters and I know from experience we are always difficult to beat, so every opponent we come up against will have to play very well. It is exciting for the island, the people are so proud.""","Defending champions Argentina and strong contenders Spain received favourable draws for the 2026 World Cup.

NEW DELHI: Defending champions Argentina and European powerhouse Spain received favourable group draws for the 2026 World Cup during a star-studded ceremony that also saw U.S. President Donald Trump awarded FIFA’s new peace prize.The draw, held at the Kennedy Center in Washington, marked the official countdown to the expanded 48-team tournament, now just six months away.Lionel Messi and Argentina will open their title defense against Algeria, with further group-stage fixtures against Austria and tournament debutants Jordan in Group J.Spain, among the leading contenders and current European champions, will begin their campaign against first-time qualifiers Cape Verde before facing Uruguay and Saudi Arabia in Group H.""All the praise will not weaken us, quite the opposite,"" insisted Spain coach Luis de la Fuente.""We want to do something big at this World Cup and that means making sure we do well in the group stage, then carrying on from there.""Thomas Tuchel's England, seeking to win the World Cup for the first time since 1966, will hope to win Group L that features beaten 2018 finalists Croatia as well as Ghana and Panama.Two-time winners France, meanwhile, face awkward tests against Senegal and Erling Haaland's Norway in Group I, which will be completed by an intercontinental play-off winner from either Iraq, Bolivia or Suriname.For the first time, the draw was done in such a way as to ensure the four highest-ranked nations were kept apart -- Spain, Argentina, France and England cannot meet before the semi-finals, if all four top their groups.However, the path to that stage -- with an extra knockout round now following the group phase -- looks perilous for some of the contenders.If the top seeds all finish first in their groups, England could, for example, find themselves playing co-hosts Mexico in Mexico City in the last 16 and then Brazil in the quarter-finals, before a last-four clash with Argentina.The tournament will be held across the United States, Mexico and Canada from June 11 to July 19, with 16 more teams added to the global showpiece, up from the 32 nations involved in 2022.That means a total of 104 matches, compared to 64 games last time.While the US will host the majority of matches including the final at the MetLife Stadium outside New York, three of the 16 venues will be in Mexico and two in Canada.The three hosts have experienced turbulent relations since Trump came to power but he brushed that aside.""We've worked closely with those two countries, and the coordination and friendship and relationship has been outstanding,"" Trump said after receiving his peace prize from FIFA president Gianni Infantino.""It is truly one of the great honors of my life. It is such an honor to be with Gianni. He has done such an incredible job,"" Trump added.Trump seized the limelight, even dancing when the Village People performed, but Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum were also in attendance.The event was co-hosted by supermodel Heidi Klum and American actor and comedian Kevin Hart. NFL legend Tom Brady, ice hockey icon Wayne Gretzky and former NBA superstar Shaquille O'Neal were among the stars who helped conduct the draw.Co-hosts Mexico will take on South Africa in Group A in the opening game of the tournament at the Estadio Azteca in Mexico City on June 11.Carlo Ancelotti's Brazil and surprise 2022 semi-finalists Morocco came out together in Group C, which also features Scotland and Haiti.Germany's opponents in Group E will be Ivory Coast, Ecuador and Caribbean minnows Curacao, while Cristiano Ronaldo's Portugal will face Uzbekistan, Colombia and a play-off winner.Co-hosts the United States got a manageable draw, with Paraguay, Australia and a European play-off winner in Group D.The top two teams in each group advance to the last 32, joined by the eight best third-placed teams.""It will be the greatest World Cup ever,"" Infantino claimed. ""This is like 104 Super Bowls in one month -- this is the magnitude of what we are organizing.""Because of the complexity, teams will only learn the full details of their match venues and kick-off times on Saturday.The 12 groups for the 2026 World Cup in the United States, Canada and Mexico from June 11 to July 19, 2026 following Friday's draw in Washington:Mexico, South Africa, South Korea, a qualifierCanada, a qualifier, Qatar, SwitzerlandBrazil, Morocco, Haiti, ScotlandUnited States, Paraguay, Australia, a qualifierGermany, Curacao, Ivory Coast, EcuadorNetherlands, Japan, a qualifier, TunisiaBelgium, Egypt, Iran, New ZealandSpain, Cape Verde, Saudi Arabia, UruguayFrance, Senegal, qualifier, NorwayArgentina, Algeria, Austria, JordanPortugal, a qualifier, Uzbekistan, ColombiaEngland, Croatia, Ghana, Panama","Defending champions Argentina and Spain receive favourable group draws for the 2026 World Cup.

NEW DELHI: Twelve Indian Super League (ISL) clubs have approached the All India Football Federation (AIFF) with urgent concerns about the domestic football crisis. The situation has become critical as the Marketing Rights Agreement between AIFF and Football Sports Development Limited expires on December 8.The affected clubs include FC Goa, Sporting Club Delhi, NorthEast United FC, Jamshedpur FC, Bengaluru FC, Mohun Bagan Super Giant, Chennauyin FC, Mumbai City FC, Kerala Blasters, Punjab FC, Odisha FC, and Mohammedan Sporting.Inter Kashi, a newly promoted team, have also joined the initiative.""While majority of the clubs have continued to honour salaries and contractual dues to players and staff in good faith, the current position is not merely challenging it is approaching commercial impossibility and risks rendering ongoing operations untenable,"" the clubs stated in their letter to AIFF president Kalyan Chaubey.""For nearly eleven years, ISL clubs have continued to invest substantially in football in India despite persistent losses on strength of a predictable league structure and, most critically, central revenue. This revenue stream has historically been the principal source of income that enabled clubs to manage salaries, infrastructure, and sporting operations.""With the expiry of the MRA and the consequent absence of a commercial rights holder, central revenue has ceased entirely.The uncertainty has also caused local sponsors to withdraw or pause commercial commitments, leaving clubs with no viable income whatsoever, despite ongoing obligations.""The clubs have recommended that AIFF collaborate with the government to address these issues. They suggest submitting proposed actions to sports minister Mansukh Mandaviya before December 8 to inform the Supreme Court about remedial measures.""... time is now of the essence. The viability of the clubs and indeed the future of the ISL and the Indian football ecosystem depends on immediate steps being placed before the Hon'ble Supreme Court. It is, therefore, imperative that the report of the Union of India and/or the AIFF on the actions proposed to be taken in respect of the issues highlighted herein be filed on or before 8 December 2025, so that the Court is apprised of the remedial pathway and commercial certainty can be restored without further delay,"" it added.The clubs expressed concern that any delay beyond the specified date could severely damage the football ecosystem developed over the past decade.AIFF responded by confirming they would forward the concerns to the Ministry of Sports and engage KPMG to develop solutions, including a possible re-tender.""The AIFF shall also put in all possible effort as per our AIFF Constitution to ensure ISL gets a long-term sustainable model for growth and development of Indian football. We are also forwarding this mail to KPMG to work on a suitable solution, including the possibility of issuing a re-tender keeping time constraints in mind,"" the letter read.The clubs have filed an Interim Application with the Supreme Court to address constitutional impediments affecting the tender process.""Should the Court process take time, we urge that the AIFF consider exercising this power with utmost urgency, in consultation with the Government where necessary, so that the sport is not imperilled by procedural delay.""The AIFF plans to hold its Annual General Body Meeting on December 20. A previous tender for selecting a new ISL commercial partner was unsuccessful.The clubs have suggested forming a consortium to operate the league if a new tender fails to attract suitable partners.""Such an approach is consistent with global best practices and reflective of the long-term commitment of the Clubs to Indian football,"" the clubs stated.""It must be conducted within a strict and non-extendable timeline, such that the process is completed well before the end of this month. Only a hard time-bound tender window of this nature provides any realistic opportunity to stabilise the commercial structure of the league and salvage the current season. Beyond the re-tender itself, we respectfully submit that a long-term solution must be formulated without delay. A temporary or stop-gap arrangement ... momentary relief but does not address the underlying structural issues.""","12 Indian Super League (ISL) clubs have approached the All India Football Federation (AIFF) with urgent concerns about the domestic football crisis.

Geno Smith injury update raises questions about Raiders' QB path



The Las Vegas Raiders walked into Week 14 looking for a spark, but they once again faced a flat offensive outing against the Denver Broncos. The opening drive offered a glimpse of hope, yet everything that followed showed how deeply the offense struggled with Geno Smith leading the unit. Each stalled series added to the frustration, and the injuries piling up on their veteran quarterback only made the situation worse.Smith has taken a heavy beating all year, and on Sunday it finally caught up with him. First, he injured his hand early in the game. He fought through it and kept playing, but the real setback came late when a shoulder injury forced him to exit for good. With the Raiders already out of playoff contention, the moment felt like another turning point in a season filled with disappointment.When Smith left after the third quarter, the energy shifted. Kenny Pickett stepped in and led an impressive touchdown drive, giving the Raiders a brief lift. It also sparked a conversation fans have been having for weeks. If the postseason is out of reach, should the team push forward with a hurt quarterback? Many believe this is the time to start evaluating the future and allow younger talent to develop.Still, before any decision is made, the Raiders need clarity on Smith’s condition.Head coach Pete Carroll addressed the issue after the game and offered a cautious early update. He said, “I didn’t see the play happen, but he got banged on his shoulder … it’s just kind of jammed up right now.” Carroll added, “The early indication is that it … didn’t show any damage. His shoulder is really locked up, so we’ll see what that means. ”Smith’s numbers reflected the difficult afternoon. He completed 13 of 21 passes for 116 yards and threw one touchdown. He also rushed once for four yards before leaving the game. Pickett finished the loss behind center as Las Vegas dropped its seventh straight contest on Dec. 7.Now the focus shifts to recovery, evaluation and a decision the Raiders can no longer avoid. With Smith hurt and the season slipping away, the team must choose the best path forward at quarterback.Also Read: Cardi B breaks silence on claims Offset confronted Stefon Diggs at Miami club during her late-night outing","Geno Smith suffered a shoulder injury in the Raiders' loss to the Denver Broncos.

Josh Allen and Joe Burrow stats: Bills star finally tops Bengals QB in a high-scoring Week 14 battle,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/josh-allen-and-joe-burrow-stats-bills-star-finally-tops-bengals-qb-in-a-high-scoring-week-14-battle/articleshow/125823930.cms,"Josh Allen achieved a career milestone, securing his first victory against Joe Burrow in a thrilling 39-34 win. Allen showcased his dual-threat prowess with impressive passing and rushing stats, while Burrow faced a second-half struggle with turnovers. This performance solidifies Allen's MVP contention and provides Buffalo with a crucial statement win.

A quarter-by-quarter breakdown highlights Josh Allen’s surge and Joe Burrow’s late-game chaos

For the first time in his career, Josh Allen walked off the field with a win over Joe Burrow , and it came in a way that showcased both quarterbacks at their best. Buffalo’s 39-34 victory over Cincinnati wasn’t just a thriller; it was a career checkpoint for Allen, who entered the matchup 0-2 against Burrow, including a postseason defeat that lingered in Bills fans’ memory for almost three years.Those losses left Allen outplayed statistically, overshadowed by Burrow’s poise and precision. But on Sunday, Allen answered in a complete performance that not only broke the streak but also reinforced why Buffalo’s offense still runs through his dynamic dual-threat style.Allen’s performance was a masterclass in controlled aggression. He completed 22 of 28 passes for 251 yards and three touchdowns, adding 78 rushing yards and another score on the ground.He built momentum steadily, hitting all nine pass attempts in the third quarter alone, while erupting in the fourth with a 56-yard rushing effort that sealed the tone of the game. His legs didn’t just extend drives; they changed the tempo, punishing Cincinnati’s defense every time they overcommitted to coverage.Burrow, who entered the game undefeated against Allen, was nearly perfect in the first half, finishing with two touchdowns on 130 passing yards before halftime.However, the Bills defense flipped the script after the break.Burrow completed zero passes in the third quarter, a stunning collapse for someone known for rhythm and resilience. He bounced back with 154 passing yards and two touchdowns in the fourth quarter, but two interceptions killed Cincinnati’s comeback push, proving costly in a game where every drive mattered.Both stars now sit at very different points in their 2025 campaigns. Allen continues to produce MVP-level numbers, with 2,832 passing yards, 19 touchdowns, and 11 rushing scores through 12 games. Burrow, playing in just his third game of the year, has four touchdowns and no rushing impact, still shaking off rust.Sunday’s duel offered no debate about who won. Allen finally got the Burrow-sized weight off his shoulders, and the Bills got a statement win when they needed it most.Also Read: Baby talk heats up for Josh Allen and Hailee Steinfeld after her confident answer about kids","Buffalo Bills beat Cincinnati Bengals 39-34.

The couple’s shared goals hint at a future family, even as careers remain the priority

Marriage hasn’t slowed down Josh Allen and Hailee Steinfeld , it has simply given both the clarity to support each other at full speed. In 2025, the NFL MVP quarterback and the Oscar-nominated actress are navigating two high-pressure careers while managing to keep their relationship grounded and intentional.The Buffalo Bills star is chasing another Super Bowl run, while Steinfeld is entering a new peak in her acting journey with upcoming film releases and creative ventures. Yet, amid their hectic schedules, the biggest topic fans want answers to isn’t about football or Hollywood accolades, it’s about family. And Steinfeld’s answer to that question was surprisingly direct and deeply personal.In a recent interview with Bustle, Hailee Steinfeld didn’t flinch when the subject of children came up. Asked if she was thinking about having kids with Allen, she answered instantly: “Of course.” At only 28, Steinfeld isn’t rushing motherhood, but her enthusiastic response shows family is part of the couple’s long-term vision.For now, she’s focused on new creative milestones, including her first leading role in Winter Games and her growing lifestyle project, the “Beau Society” newsletter. She credits Allen for providing emotional support even as her career expands, telling Bustle, “I literally thank God every day that I found my person… Life makes sense.”The feeling is mutual. Allen, fresh off winning the 2024 NFL MVP, has been vocal about how aligned they are with their goals. During a Bills preseason game, he shared, “To have someone that I share similar life interests with and wants in life, it’s an awesome feeling. I get to support somebody as much as she supports me.”The quarterback describes their marriage as being “always in the honeymoon phase,” and their matching ambition makes building a future together seem less like a sacrifice and more like a shared mission.As the Bills push for another dominant season and Hollywood eyes Steinfeld’s award potential, the couple appears to be writing their own playbook: love first, careers thriving, and a future family waiting patiently on the horizon.Also Read: “I lost my breath”: Hailee Steinfeld refused to follow outdated wedding rule, choosing Josh Allen over superstition","Josh Allen and Hailee Steinfeld are balancing demanding careers with a strong relationship.

Josh Simmons injury forces Chiefs to change plans against Houston Texans

Josh Simmons did not play for the Kansas City Chiefs on Sunday night, December 7, 2025, when the team faced the Houston Texans at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, Missouri. His absence stood out early in the game, especially with the spotlight of a prime-time matchup. The reason had nothing to do with a late decision. Josh Simmons was already ruled out because he is on injured reserve after suffering a serious wrist injury.Josh Simmons was hurt on November 28, 2025, during the Chiefs’ Thanksgiving Day game against the Dallas Cowboys in Arlington, Texas. The rookie left tackle injured his left wrist while blocking on a running play. Medical exams later confirmed a fracture and dislocation. After surgery, the team placed him on injured reserve, which officially kept him out for the Week 14 game against Houston.Josh Simmons’ injury happened late in the Thanksgiving game when quarterback Patrick Mahomes was under pressure from the Dallas Cowboys defense.During the play, Simmons’ arm absorbed the impact, and he was seen in pain before leaving the field. He did not return that day, and further testing in the following days showed surgery was needed.Head coach Andy Reid addressed the situation during a midweek press conference in Kansas City. “Josh had surgery on his wrist for a fracture and dislocation,” Reid said.“It went well, but now we have to give it time.” Because he was placed on injured reserve before Week 14, NFL rules made Josh Simmons ineligible to play against the Houston Texans.Patrick Mahomes also spoke about the loss of his left tackle before the game on December 7. He said the offense had to adjust quickly against a Texans defense known for heavy pressure. “It’s tough losing a starter,” Mahomes said. “But we trust the guys stepping in.”With Josh Simmons out, the Chiefs turned to depth options like Wanya Morris and Jaylon Moore to handle the tackle duties.Coaches also adjusted protection schemes and play timing to help slow down the Texans’ pass rush during the home game at Arrowhead Stadium.Josh Simmons remained around the team during the week but focused on recovery and rehab rather than game preparation. Team officials have not shared a clear return date yet.Being on injured reserve means he must miss several weeks, and his comeback will depend on how well his wrist heals following surgery.Also Read: Philadelphia Eagles Become Latest NFL Punchline As Strange Locker Room Positivity Rabbit Spreads Across Social Media","Josh Simmons was hurt on November 28, 2025, during the Chiefs’ Thanksgiving Day game against the Dallas Cowboys.

Sixers Enter With Their Own Uncertainty

The Los Angeles Lakers are bracing for another high-stakes Eastern Conference showdown as they continue their road stretch, but all eyes are on the availability of LeBron James. With the team coming off a 126-105 loss to the Boston Celtics, the uncertainty surrounding their 40-year-old leader heightens the tension ahead of their clash with the Philadelphia 76ers. For a Lakers squad sitting at an impressive 16-6, getting James back on the court could be critical to regaining momentum.The matchup itself comes layered with storylines, Philadelphia enters at 13-9 and pushing for a fourth straight victory, while the Lakers aim to show resilience despite a wave of injuries. The contest at Xfinity Mobile Arena promises playoff-level energy long before the postseason begins.has officially been upgraded to probable after managing right sciatica and left foot joint arthritis, conditions that already cost him 14 early-season games. The left foot issue resurfaced recently, keeping him out of the Celtics matchup and raising his season absences to 16. Initially listed as questionable, the shift to probable indicates encouraging signs from the Lakers’ medical staff as load management remains a priority in his 23rd NBA campaign.Though banged up, James has long thrived in adversity, and Lakers fans expect him to push through once again.Luka Doncic’s return after two missed games provides an immediate offensive lift, especially with his backcourt chemistry alongside Austin Reaves. Meanwhile, Smart remains sidelined, removing a key defensive anchorm, an absence that has statistically increased the Lakers’ points allowed. Should James be held out as a precaution, the expected lineup would include Doncic, Reaves, Rui Hachimura, Jake LaRavia, and DeAndre Ayton.Philadelphia’s injury report also carries significant weight. Both Joel Embiid and Paul George are questionable with knee issues, while Kelly Oubre Jr. and Trendon Watford remain out. If their stars sit, Tyrese Maxey will quarterback a youthful rotation supported by Quentin Grimes and rookie VJ Edgecombe. Historically, James has dominated the Sixers with 27.2 points per game and a 40-18 career record, yet the Lakers are winless in Philadelphia during his tenure (0-6), a stat that adds intrigue to the matchup.Also read: Is Luka Doncic playing tonight vs the Philadelphia 76ers?

76ers’ Injury Concerns Could Shift the Balance

What to Expect Tonight in the Los Angeles Lakers vs Philadelphia 76ers Game (December 7, 2025)

Two major storylines collide tonight in Philadelphia: a superstar’s family milestone and a high-stakes cross-conference showdown. As the Los Angeles Lakers continue to build momentum in the 2025–26 season, all eyes turn to Luka Doncic, who rejoins the lineup after briefly stepping away for one of the happiest reasons possible, the birth of his second daughter. His return elevates the buzz surrounding an already intriguing matchup against a Philadelphia 76ers squad dealing with its own injury uncertainties.With the Los Angeles Lakers sitting at an impressive 16-6, the presence of their MVP-caliber guard becomes even more crucial. Luka Doncic’s absence was felt in recent games, particularly during the loss to the Boston Celtics. Yet despite the setback, the team now gets a significant boost just in time for a pivotal road test at Wells Fargo Center.Luka Doncic is officially available to play tonight after missing two games for personal reasons tied to his growing family. No longer listed on the injury report, he rejoined the team in Philadelphia and is set to be in uniform for this marquee December 7 contest. The image of Doncic returning from family celebrations to potentially drop another triple-double only adds to the emotional weight of the evening.Through 16 games this season, Doncic has been nothing short of spectacular.Averaging 35.3 points, 8.9 rebounds, and 8.9 assists, he continues to serve as the engine of the Lakers’ offense. During his absence, Austin Reaves delivered a standout performance versus Boston, but the team undeniably benefits from Doncic’s signature step-backs, vision, and ability to dictate tempo.The Lakers enter the matchup with a blend of positive and concerning news. Luka is cleared, but LeBron James remains listed as questionable, though trending toward probable, due to right sciatica and arthritis in his left foot. LeBron has already missed the first 14 games of the season and the recent Celtics clash, but his upgraded status hints at a possible return to action. Marcus Smart, however, remains unavailable because of a left lumbar muscle strain.Philadelphia enters the showdown with significant uncertainty. Joel Embiid and Paul George are both questionable with left knee injuries, creating major question marks around their availability. Kelly Oubre Jr. (knee) and Trendon Watford (thigh) have already been ruled out, leaving the Sixers potentially shorthanded against a rejuvenated Lakers squad. If their stars cannot suit up, the matchup could tilt heavily toward Doncic’s control of the floor.With Luka Doncic back in action and the Lakers gaining potential reinforcement from LeBron, Los Angeles appears primed for a strong outing. The Sixers, battling injuries to their core players, may struggle to contain a Lakers team operating with renewed energy. Between the emotional momentum of Luka’s return and the high-profile names on both sides, fans can expect a night filled with highlight-worthy moments and playoff-level intensity.","Luka Doncic is officially available to play tonight after missing two games for personal reasons tied to his growing family.

Golden State will face Chicago as Stephen Curry prepares for a comeback

The Golden State Warriors are set to meet the Chicago Bulls tonight following a close 99-94 victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers. With Stephen Curry missing his fourth consecutive game, backup guard Pat Spencer emerged as the unexpected hero. He had 19 points and 7 assists, enabling the Warriors escape with a much-needed victory and some momentum for tonight's game.However, there's good news for the Warriors fans’. As per the official notice from the franchise, Curry is set to participate in segments of Wednesday's practice as he recovers from a left quad contusion and muscle strain. The team announced the same on December 7 on X. The notice further stated that his re-evaluation indicated that he is reportedly making good progress. Hence, the team took the decision.While the star player has been impressive in recent games, the Warriors desperately need their starting point guard, Stephen Curry, as they have seemingly underperformed without them at times. The former MVP is set to miss his fifth consecutive game tonight due to a quadriceps issue.Stephen Curry has been in and out of the Warriors' lineup this season, struggling with a variety of injuries, including this latest setback.He missed three games early in November due to illness, and his quadriceps issues appears to be troubling him much more recently.However, now, he is set to make a comeback. He is progressing well and has begun individual workouts, according to Brett Siegel of ClutchPoints.com.Additionally, as per the X post of Marc Stein of The Stein Line:“The Warriors say Stephen Curry is expected to participate in segments of Wednesday's practice as he recovers from a left quad contusion and muscle strain…”He further shared the official notice from the team. It read:“Golden State Warriors guard Stephen Curry, who suffered a left quadriceps contusion and muscle strain against the Houston Rockets on November 26 and has missed the last four (4) games, was recently re-evaluated…”It further continued:“The re-evaluation indicated that Curry is making good progress. He has started to do individual on-court workouts in the Bay Area and could participate in segments of the team's first practice back home on Wednesday..”Curry has only made 16 appearances this season, despite his impressive performance on the court. In those games, the franchise's cornerstone averaged 27.9 points, 3.7 rebounds, and 4.0 assists per game. As a result, he will be sorely missed tonight when the Golden State Warriors travel to Chicago.Meanwhile, without Curry, the Golden State Warriors will look for their second straight win when they travel to Chicago to face the Bulls on Sunday night. The game will be the second leg of a back-to-back after the Warriors defeated the Cavaliers in Cleveland on Saturday night.Steph Curry missed the game against the Cleveland because of a quad injury.

Angel Reese and Paige Bueckers share playful courtside moment while showing off WNBA dominance

With 10 wins and 34 defeats, the Chicago Sky and Dallas Wings tied for the league's poorest record, capping a disastrous season. Nevertheless, Wings star Paige Bueckers and Sky standout Angel Reese have a lengthy history of friendship, dating back to their time playing for various USA Basketball teams before college.They recently made an unexpected cameo at Madison Square Garden on Sunday during a regular-season game between the New York Knicks and the Orlando Magic. They also kept their fans entertained, particularly following the All-Star Game, when they uploaded some pictures on social media from the game.While the WNBA greats attended different institutions, both won national championships and transitioned effortlessly into the professional game. In reality, both Bueckers and Reese made it to the 2025 WNBA All-Star Game, where a TikTok post they created together became viral, with over 2.3 million likes on Reese's page.They are both great businesswomen as well who have used their on-court popularity and success through a number of profitable collaborations and possibilities. Earlier this week, it was announced that these two would be collaborating with Reese's and Oreos.Now, taking advantage of the WNBA offseason, both attended the New York Knicks' game against the Orlando Magic, just days after Reese's announced a collaboration with the Oreo cookie brand. To commemorate their collaboration, Reese and Bueckers were seated courtside at the December 7 game against the Orlando Magic.The WNBA stars were seen wearing Knicks gear while watching the game from courtside seats. The Sky celebrity was dressed in an orange faux fur coat, and the Wings star wore a blue and orange jumper.Reese's attendance at the Magic games is now surprising given her boyfriend, Wendell Carter Jr., is the team's starting center. In New York, the Chicago star aimed to expand her brand and collaborations, as Paige appears to have done.On the other hand, recently, the Bayou Barbie published various stories on her official Instagram account, including a partnership with Oreo and the Wings' number 5. The two danced and posed next to Reese's crackers while dressed in the brand's orange and light blue attire. Meanwhile, despite the Magic's 106-100 loss to the Knicks, the two of them stole the show.While Bueckers and Reese are enjoying basketball, cookies, and dancing, the Wings star is prepared to make her debut in Unrivalled. It is a 3-on-3 league co-founded in 2023 by Napheesa Collier and Breanna Stewart, in which Angel will not play.Meanwhile, while at the Knicks game, Reese recorded a TikTok live video in which she and Bueckers asked and answered each other's questions. At one point, Reese looked at the camera and asked the people:""Okay, how tall do y'all think Paige is? Everybody in that chat, be for real.”Bueckers responded:""Don't say anything in the fives. Like, I know five is our number,""Reese then asked:""Wait, are you not like 5'11""? 5'10""?""As Bueckers responded with a firm “no,” Reese said:""Okay, 5'11"". You not six feet yet.""Reese then asked Bueckers to stand up next to her to check how tall she was. Once both stood, Reese added:""You guys, look how short Paige is!""Bueckers responded:""Mind you, she has like six-inch heels on!""Both Angel and Paige are amazing WNBA players. Angel finished her second season with the Sky, averaging 14.7 points, 12.6 rebounds, 3.7 assists, and 1.5 steals per game.

Chicago Bulls’ Injury Picture vs the Golden State Warriors (December 7, 2025)

when the Golden State Warriors visit the Chicago Bulls on December 7, 2025, as he continues to recover from a left quadriceps contusion. The veteran guard did not travel with the team for its current road stretch, leaving Golden State without its offensive leader for a fifth straight contest. His absence extends a difficult early-season stretch for a roster already dealing with heavy injury setbacks.The Warriors entered this three-game trip bracing for the likelihood that Curry would miss its entirety, and that expectation has played out. With the team fighting to stay near .500, the focus has shifted toward keeping the 37-year-old healthy for the long haul rather than pushing him through discomfort on a taxing back-to-back slate.Team updates make it clear that Stephen Curry has been formally ruled out for the matchup at the United Center, continuing a recovery path that began after he suffered the quad injury in a late-November defeat to Houston. Coaches and medical personnel have prioritized rest to prevent the bruise from worsening, particularly since explosive movement could escalate it into a more serious soft-tissue problem. Reports also confirm he has not been with the team in Philadelphia, Cleveland, or Chicago, eliminating any chance of a last-second availability.His next realistic return window appears to be later in the week when Golden State hosts Minnesota, provided his symptoms continue to settle.Before going down, Stephen Curry had opened the 2025-26 campaign in elite form, averaging roughly 28 points per game with high efficiency and signature long-range production. The quad contusion, however, has lingered longer than initially anticipated, disrupting both his rhythm and the Golden State Warriors’ offensive structure. Coaches have repeatedly emphasized patience, calling this a precautionary but necessary stretch of multiple missed games to keep him fresh for the postseason push.Golden State Warriors arrive in Chicago missing more than just Stephen Curry. Draymond Green remains sidelined with a right midfoot sprain, Al Horford is out with sciatic nerve irritation, and young forward Alex Toohey continues to sit for knee management. The injuries remove critical playmaking, rim protection, and defensive leadership, leaving increased responsibility for depth pieces and two-way wings. The team may receive a boost with Jimmy Butler, who is listed as probable and expected to play, while Seth Curry has also been upgraded to probable.Chicago Bulls’s report is also crowded, though slightly more optimistic. Coby White is probable, Ayo Dosunmu is questionable, and several depth players carry doubtful tags, while Kevin Huerter and Noa Essengue are confirmed outs. With the Bulls riding a six-game home losing streak, this Curry-less Warriors squad presents a valuable opportunity to reset.Also read: Is Nikola Jokic playing tonight vs the Charlotte Hornets? Latest update on the Denver Nuggets star's injury report (December 7, 2025) Without their primary creator, the Warriors must lean on physicality, defensive intensity, and opportunistic shot-making to keep pace.

While fans will not get the full “Splash Show,” the matchup promises a gritty, unpredictable battle between two shorthanded teams searching for momentum.","Stephen Curry has been ruled out for the Golden State Warriors' game against the Chicago Bulls on December 7, 2025.

The Orlando Magic's roster took a significant hit when standout Franz Wagner suffered an apparent leg injury in the first quarter of their game against the New York Knicks on Sunday.

Wagner departed Sunday's game against the New York Knicks in the first quarter due to a lower-leg ailment. He was about to dunk on a lob feed from teammate Anthony Black when he was fouled hard by Knicks center Ariel Hukporti.Wagner seemed to land awkwardly on his left leg and quickly grasped the region below his knee before requiring assistance getting to the Magic locker room.Hukporti's foul was reviewed for egregious foul, but the call of common foul was upheld.The Magic ruled Wagner out for the rest of the game, saying in a statement that he will be re-evaluated when the team returns to Orlando.

The Denver Nuggets enter their matchup against the Charlotte Hornets on December 7, 2025, with momentum, star power, and a clear mission. Sitting third in the Western Conference at 16-6 and boasting a strong 10-2 road record, Denver continues to rely on its superstar centerpiece, Nikola Jokic, whose availability instantly shifts the balance of any contest. With Charlotte missing key contributors, the stage is set for a potential showcase from the two-time MVP.This meeting also carries implications for both teams’ current trajectories.

However, key rotational pieces remain sidelined, stretching the bench thin.Charlotte Hornets’ injury report is significantly heavier, headlined by LaMelo Ball’s absence due to a left ankle bone bruise suffered in Friday’s win over Toronto. The Hornets also miss multiple guards and wings, putting pressure on remaining playmakers and further weakening their rebounding and defensive structure.Miles Bridges leads Charlotte with 20.8 points per game, but without Ball’s 19.9 points and playmaking, the Hornets face an uphill climb.Also read: Is LaMelo Ball playing tonight vs the Denver Nuggets?

NEW DELHI: Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz have combined to win the last seven major titles — a streak that ranks fourth among the longest in the Open Era. And it is tough to find someone in the men's draw who can disrupt this spell at the US Open, which gets underway on Sunday.Their run, which started at 2024 Australian Open, is only behind Roger Federer-RafaelNadal (11), Nadal-Novak Djokovic (9) and Djokovic-Nadal (9). Victory for either in two weeks will not only extend that streak but ensure two consecutive years where the Spaniard or the Italian have lifted the trophy at a major.If Federer, Nadal and Djokovic were attributed to have wiped out an entire generation of players, we might be witnessing much of the same being repeated now. Large credit, then and now, to the players concerned, was due to their consistency on all three surfaces.Jannik Sinner has clinched the last three hard-court majors — the 2024 and 2025 Australian Opens and the 2024 US Open. Carlos Alcaraz, meanwhile, has ruled Wimbledon in 2023 and 2024, and lifted the French Open in both 2024 and 2025.Paris this year marked the first time the duopoly reached the grandest stage: a Slam final.In that thriller, Alcaraz saved three championship points before prevailing. It was one of four meetings between them in the last four months, all in finals. Should they meet again at Flushing Meadows, the stakes will be nothing less than the trophy and the world No. 1 ranking.The rivalry, nicknamed ‘Sincaraz’, has already produced 14 chapters. One of its finest came at the 2022 US Open, when Alcaraz edged Sinner in a 5hr 15min quarter-final that ended at 2:50am.The latest instalment, however, was more muted. In the Cincinnati Open final, Alcaraz stormed to a 5-0 lead before Sinner retired with a virus. That ended the Italian’s 26-match hard-court winning streak — his previous defeat also at the hands of Alcaraz.The Spaniard, meanwhile, has been in blistering form: a tour-leading six titles this season and 39 wins from his last 41 matches.Sinner, now back to full health, welcomed the rivalry on Media Day. “Me and Carlos, we’re sharing big trophies, but at the same time, things can change,” said the top-ranked Italian on Friday.Alcaraz was just as generous. “Thanks to him, I bring my best tennis in the match,” he said in Cincinnati. “I think for the people, too, it’s great watching our matches. As we’ve said many, many times, we raise our level to the top and bring really beautiful tennis in these matches.”Sinner is also chasing history of his own: to become the first man to defend the US Open title since Roger Federer’s five-in-a-row streak from 2004 to 2008.Between them, Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz have captured nine of the last 12 majors. The other three belong to Novak Djokovic. Yet even the Serb, with his 24 Grand Slam titles, finds himself cast as an outsider to the new duopoly.“I kind of empathise with the third guy, because I was in those shoes with Federer and Nadal,” Djokovic said with a smile. “I want to see a third guy coming in.”Could that “third guy” still be him? Djokovic, a four-time US Open champion, is chasing a record-extending 25th major. But since winning here in 2023, he has reached just one Grand Slam final.The 38-year-old admitted his motivation now centres exclusively on the Slams. That approach has been underscored by his absence from tour events since a semi-final defeat to Alcaraz at Wimbledon.With age and injuries catching up — a hamstring issue at the Australian Open and a thigh problem at Wimbledon — the extended break may prove timely.His campaign in New York begins against American youngster Learner Tien, who upset Daniil Medvedev in Melbourne earlier this year. The road ahead could feature tough hurdles in Frances Tiafoe, Taylor Fritz, Ben Shelton, and, inevitably, Alcaraz.“When it comes to individual sports like ours or boxing, Formula 1, golf, people love to see rivalries,” Novak Djokovic said about ‘Sincaraz’. “I think their rivalry is, without a doubt, the best one we have at the moment. And it looks like it's going to stay like that for some time.“And then you have obviously other young players that are definitely going to challenge them, and hopefully somebody can get in the mix. There are players that are able to have that joker spot, the third spot,” he added.Djokovic, of course, holds that ‘joker card’ himself. But there are others who could give Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz a run for their money. Chief among them is World No. 6 Ben Shelton.The 22-year-old American brings just what home fans crave — a booming serve, electric energy, breathtaking shot-making and plenty of flair. To cap it off, he celebrates with bicep curls and a mock ‘hang-up-the-phone’ routine after his wins.“I think I'm an entertainer at heart. I’m never going to be the guy who is able to robotically go about my business and not change expression or show any emotion. I think that I play better when I do show some emotion,"" he said on Friday.But the challenge at the US Open is immense. The last American man to win a major singles title was Andy Roddick at this very event in 2003. Taylor Fritz came closest last year, reaching the final before falling to Sinner — the first American man in 15 years to contest a Slam title match.Shelton’s road is no easier this time. He could run into Alcaraz in the quarterfinals and Sinner in the final. Against the two, his record in majors this year reads 0-3.“Frustrating,” Shelton admitted. “Two very different players and challenges,” he added of the ‘Sincaraz’ threat.Others lurking in the draw include three-time Grand Slam finalist Alexander Zverev, 2021 US Open champion Daniil Medvedev, and Fritz.World No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka has collected three titles on the WTA Tour this season, the joint-most. She lifted the Miami and Madrid Opens, while finishing runner-up at Indian Wells and Stuttgart. With 50 match wins, she leads the tour and also tops the Race to the WTA Finals.What eludes her is the one prize that matters most — a Grand Slam. Her bid for a Melbourne three-peat ended painfully against Madison Keys, followed by an early exit at the French Open and a semi-final defeat at Wimbledon.That has only steeled the Belarussian’s resolve to defend her US Open crown. Victory in New York would place her alongside greats. The last woman to win back-to-back US Opens was Serena Williams, who captured three in a row between 2012 and 2014.“My thought is to change that,” said the 27-year-old. “But, wow, that’s insane, you know, how unpredictable women’s tennis is, right? Should we change it? Should we try at least to change it?”After Wimbledon, Sabalenka skipped Montreal to rest. She returned in Cincinnati, but went down in straight sets to Elena Rybakina in the quarterfinals. Despite that, she insists the mood is upbeat.As the top seed, Sabalenka could run into USA’s Coco Gauff in the semi-finals — a repeat of last year’s final and their French Open clash earlier this season.But her biggest challenge may come from Poland’s Iga Swiatek, who enters New York brimming with confidence. The second seed followed up her maiden Wimbledon triumph with victory in Cincinnati and a run to the mixed doubles final here.Swiatek, who beat Sabalenka en route to her 2022 US Open crown, barely paused after Cincinnati. Hours later, she was in New York, shrugging off fatigue to partner Casper Ruud in the mixed doubles, where they finished runners-up to Sara Errani and Andrea Vavassori.On the eve of the US Open, Coco Gauff has made a bold move, bringing biomechanics expert Gavin MacMillan into her corner. MacMillan, who previously worked with Aryna Sabalenka on her serve, joins at a time when Gauff’s own delivery is under heavy scrutiny.The 21-year-old American leads the WTA Tour in double faults this season — 320, well ahead of Jelena Ostapenko’s 211. The numbers have been stark: 42 double faults across three matches in Montreal, including a staggering 23 in a single outing. In Cincinnati, she handed Jasmine Paolini 16 free points the same way.“Gavin became available. I just felt this was the best decision for my game at least and I had to go with what I was feeling,” Gauff said. Since winning the French Open, she has managed a modest 5-4 record.While the timing of the change — days before a Slam — raised eyebrows, Gauff insisted the call was about the bigger picture. On a rain-hit Wednesday, she was already grinding on her serve with her team.“A tournament is a tournament. I hate losing regardless of where I am,” she said. “I hope I can get it all together — I think I'll play either Monday or Tuesday — by then. If not, I have the rest of this year to work on it.“But I do know I needed to make a change, technical change to it, and I don't want to waste time continuing doing the wrong things.”Gauff's first test of her serve would come against a tricky opponent in Australia's Alja Tomljanovic, someone who has the experience of dealing with crowd favourites having sent Serena packing in her last-ever US Open appearance.","Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz have combined to win the last seven major titles — a streak that ranks fourth among the longest in the Open Era.

AB de Villiers answers why SA20 survived while other South Africa T20 leagues failed

Poll Would you have the courage to ask for a picture with your idol? Yes, definitely! Maybe, if I was feeling brave. No, I would feel too nervous.

South Africa’s young batting sensation Dewald Brevis has shared a heartwarming story of how he first met his idol AB de Villiers . Brevis admitted that he was so nervous at the time that he could barely muster the courage to ask for a picture, but eventually, the meeting changed the course of his cricket journey.Brevis, who made his international debut against Australia in August 2023 and has since represented his country in 14 matches across formats, has long been compared to de Villiers. His ability to play innovative strokes and his striking resemblance to the South African great have earned him the nickname ‘Baby AB’.Speaking to SuperSport, Brevis recalled spotting de Villiers at a restaurant while out with his family. “AB and his wife walked past us and I just froze. I wanted to ask for a picture but I couldn’t get the words out. Then his wife said, ‘AB, come for a picture,’ and that’s how I got my first photo with him,” Brevis said.A few days later, Brevis got another chance at a school event. “Someone told us AB was at the school and we rushed to see him. I was still star-struck and could hardly say anything. As he was about to leave, I suddenly asked, ‘AB, you can say no, but can I please have your number.’ He gave it to me, and later I sent him a message just to thank him,” Brevis revealed.That simple exchange turned into a lasting bond. With the world soon going into lockdown, Brevis and de Villiers stayed in touch, and what began as an idol-fan moment gradually evolved into a mentor-mentee relationship.","South Africa’s young batting sensation Dewald Brevis has shared a heartwarming story of how he first met his idol AB de Villiers.

Viktor Gyokeres marked his Arsenal debut with two goals as the Gunners secured a commanding 5-0 victory over Leeds at the Emirates Stadium. The win was overshadowed by injuries to Bukayo Saka and Martin Odegaard, just over a week before Arsenal's crucial match against Liverpool.Arsenal moved to the top of the Premier League table, ahead of Tottenham on goal difference. Both teams maintain perfect records after their opening two matches.Arsenal's management has invested £260 million on seven new players to strengthen their title aspirations, following three consecutive second-place finishes.The club's newest signing, Eberechi Eze, received a warm welcome from fans before the match. The £60 million recruit chose Arsenal over Tottenham, returning to his childhood club.Gyokeres, who joined from Sporting Lisbon, demonstrated his potential as Arsenal's new striker. The recent injuries highlighted the importance of squad depth.""We've learned the lesson from last season and the squad that you need right now,"" said Arteta. ""That is why we acted in the market the way that we have done because you have so many games, anything can happen. It happened to two of our most important players -- we already lost Kai -- so we are going to need everybody at his best and a lot of luck as well to not lose others.""Arsenal's opening goal came from a set-piece, similar to their 1-0 victory at Manchester United on the season's first weekend.Timber, who had previously scored only twice in 52 appearances, found the net from Rice's delivery after 34 minutes.Odegaard left the field following a shoulder injury from a fall. Saka then extended Arsenal's lead with a right-footed shot past goalkeeper Lucas Perri.Gyokeres, who previously attracted Leeds' interest during his time at Coventry, showed his worth despite questions about his Premier League potential. He scored after receiving Riccardo Calafiori's pass.Saka, who missed four months last season with a hamstring injury, was substituted in the 53rd minute while holding his left leg.Arsenal's fourth goal came when Timber converted from close range following another Rice corner that Leeds failed to clear.The match featured the Premier League debut of 15-year-old Max Dowman, who became the second-youngest player in English top-flight history after teammate Ethan Nwaneri.Dowman earned a penalty in stoppage time, which Gyokeres converted for his second goal.""That was special for sure,"" Arteta said about Dowman's performance. ""It is great to be able to change the energy in the stadium by bringing him in and he had an impact.""","Viktor Gyokeres scores two goals as Arsenal beat Leeds 5-0 at the Emirates Stadium.

EXCLUSIVE: India to boycott Pakistan in Asia Cup? Harbhajan Singh says, 'Khoon aur paani ek saath nahi beh sakte'

Poll Which team do you think will handle pressure better during the Asia Cup matches? India Pakistan

Legendary Pakistan fast bowler Wasim Akram has urged players and fans from both sides to keep emotions in check when India and Pakistan meet at the Asia Cup 2025 in the UAE next month.The two arch-rivals will lock horns on September 14 in Dubai, with the possibility of another clash in the Super Four on September 21 and even a third in the final.“I am sure these matches will be entertaining, just like all other India-Pakistan matches. But I hope both the players and the fans will remain disciplined and do not cross the line,” Akram told Telecom Asia Sport.Highlighting the attention these fixtures attract on a global level, the former captain said, “Games between India and Pakistan are watched by billions around the world,” calling the Asia Cup an ideal stage for fierce yet respectful competition.On the cricketing front, Akram admitted that India would start favourites given their recent form but stressed that handling pressure would decide the outcome. “If Indians are patriotic and want their team to win, the same goes for Pakistani fans. India has been in better form recently and will start as favourites, but the team that handles pressure best on the day will win,” he said.Pakistan’s youthful squad, Akram noted, has the drive to compete strongly, but he regretted the absence of one of their biggest names.“Personally, I wanted to see Babar Azam in the team, but since he’s not been selected, it’s up to those in the squad to step up,” he told Telecom Asia Sport.Looking ahead, Akram said the tournament could deliver multiple India-Pakistan contests, while expressing his long-standing wish for a return of bilateral Test cricket. “This Asia Cup will be a feast for fans worldwide. It’s my wish that India and Pakistan also resume playing a Test series. It’s been too long, and it would be a historic spectacle for fans on both sides,” he added.Reiterating his call for restraint, Akram stressed, “Fans must also show discipline,” underscoring that sportsmanship must accompany the passion of the rivalry.The Asia Cup 2025 is set to be hosted by the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in September 2025, and will be played in the T20 format. The tournament will feature 8 teams and a total of 19 matches, including the final scheduled for 28th September 2025.","Wasim Akram has urged players and fans from both sides to keep emotions in check when India and Pakistan meet at the Asia Cup 2025 in the UAE next month.

Barcelona secured a thrilling 3-2 victory at Levante in the Spanish league on Saturday, overcoming a two-goal deficit. The defending champions mounted their comeback through goals from Pedri González and Ferran Torres in the second half after newly promoted Levante had established a surprising lead at halftime.The winning goal came late in the match when Lamine Yamal's curling cross into the six-yard box resulted in an own goal by Levante's Unai Elgezabal.Levante had taken an early lead in the 15th minute through Iván Romero, capitalising on a counterattack following a ball lost by Yamal. They extended their advantage when José Luis Morales converted a penalty in first-half injury time, awarded after VAR identified a handball by Alejandro Balde.Pedri initiated Barcelona's recovery in the 49th minute, receiving a pass from Yamal outside the area before scoring with a powerful long-range shot into the corner of the net.Ferran, who had previously hit the woodwork in the first half, equalised in the 52nd minute by holding off his defender and volleying in Raphinha's corner kick.Barcelona's persistence paid off when Yamal's contribution led to the decisive goal just after the 90-minute mark.""The first goal we scored helped us a lot to get our confidence in the box, but until the end it was not easy for us to get the three points,"" said Barcelona coach Hansi Flick.The victory followed Barcelona's 3-0 win against nine-man Mallorca in their season opener.Marcus Rashford made his first league start for Barcelona since his loan move from Manchester United, playing as a left-side forward. He was substituted at halftime by Dani Olmo, after a first half dominated by Pedri's midfield passing and Yamal's right-wing attacks.""I think Marcus had some situations in the first half where he showed how good he is and how he can help us, and that is how we have to continue,"" Flick said. Robert Lewandowski made his season debut as a late substitute after recovering from a muscle injury.In other league action, Atletico Madrid struggled for the second consecutive match, drawing 1-1 with promoted Elche at home.Despite strengthening their squad during the summer transfer window, Diego Simeone's team has collected just one point from their opening matches.Alexander Sorloth gave Atletico an early lead in the eighth minute, converting David Hancko's pass with a well-executed looping strike.Elche responded quickly, with Rafa Mir equalising in the 15th minute following an assist from German Valera.""We are working hard to get the most out of our players,"" Simeone said. ""With patience and work, the results will come. We can't change course because we had two games that we deserved, at least, not to lose.""Elche, coming from southeastern Spain, had previously drawn 1-1 with Real Betis in their opening match.The day's action concluded with Mallorca and Celta Vigo sharing points in a 1-1 draw.",Barcelona beat Levante 3-2 in Spanish league.

After his state is unveiled at Wankhede Stadium, Legend says he is 'at a loss of words because I'm overwhelmed'

MUMBAI: It was an occasion which was bound to get to him. Soon after he and former ICC, BCCI and MCA president Sharad Pawar unveiled their statues at the entrance of the Sharad Pawar Cricket Museum, which was inaugurated in a glittering function at the Wankhede Stadium on Saturday, cricket legend Sunil Gavaskar revealed what memorabilia of his the former India captain gave to the museum and why.The MCA cricket museum has a special section on Gavaskar and all the other greats of Mumbai and Indian cricket. Soon after Mumbai Cricket Association president Ajinkya Naik revealed that Gavaskar had donated two of his caps, one he wore for Mumbai and the other for Dadar Union, for the museum, Gavaskar revealed that his gave his Dadar Union cap because it was his ""lucky cap"" which he wore when legendary allrounder Kapil Dev bowled India to a memorable 59-run win in the Melbourne Test back in Feb 1981 with a dream spell of five for 28 in 16.4 over despite being troubled by a bad knee injury. Kapil's deadly spell had helped India skittle out merely 83.Gavaskar explained that playing for the historic Dadar Union club also taught him that “the game is bigger than the individual, and that you don’t take it for granted.”""I think I need to tell you why (I gave) the Dadar Union cap apart from the fact that Dadar Union taught me so much about the fact that the game is bigger than the individual. That you do not take the game for granted.That you have to keep on giving back to the game. And so, the Dadar Union was that factor. But that cap was worn on the day we beat Australia in 1981 when Kapil came in at Melbourne.“When Kapil came in and took five wickets, he was unwell the previous day. And he took injections and then painkilling injections, and he came on to bowl. And it was a touch-and-go situation.“And I am superstitious, as you probably know from now. And so, therefore, I mean, I had my Dadar Union cap, which was lucky. And that is the reason I wore that cap that day, not the India cap, because it was... they had to score some 60-80 runs and then they had lost (just) three wickets (overnight). And that's why that cap. So, the importance of that cap is not just for Dadar Union. It was worn on the day India beat Australia in 1981 in Melbourne. ”Expressing his heart-felt gratitude at the MCA’s gesture of installing his statue at the Wankhede Stadium, Gavaskar said, “I am actually at a loss for words because I am overwhelmed. Overwhelmed by this unique gesture. It doesn't happen to everybody that there is a statue just outside the museum where there is going to be so much more footfall to see the museum. Every time you enter the museum, to be able to see the statue, so that is something totally, really unique, so I am overwhelmed. I can't thank the MCA for this wonderful gesture. It's a great honour.”Churning with emotions, the 76-year-old paid the ultimate tribute to the MCA, terming the association as his ""mother which held his hand from the beginning.""""The MCA, I've said in the past (too), is like my mother. (It) Held my hand when I was beginning with cricket at the schools' level, playing for the Mumbai schools, as it was called then and thereafter as well, for the Ranji Trophy etc. It's been absolutely just a privilege and an honour and a blessing to be able to play for Mumbai and I never ever dreamt that it would come to this. I'm just absolutely honored, privileged, blessed and overwhelmed by this,"" Gavaskar said.Talking about his impression of his statue, which has been inspired by the celebration of his landmark 10,000th run in Test cricket-Gavaskar was the first cricketer to score 10,000 runs in Test cricket-against Pakistan at Ahmedabad in 1987, Gavaskar said, ""Well, it just took me back to that particular time. when I got to the 10,000th (Test) run. So, yes, it brought back very good memories.""Having taken a tour of the MCA Cricket Museum along with Pawar, Gavaskar revealed that his favourite part in the place was some of the “India blazers” on display. “It was just a rush trip, but I think looking at some of the blazers, because the blazers have changed over time. There are crests that have changed over time. At the start, the three lions were on the crest (of the India blazer).“Now, there's the BCCI logo on the crest. So, to be able to see those things was something very, very touching,” he said.Earlier, speaking on the stage, Gavaskar thanked former India and Mumbai captain Ajit Wadekar for “nurturing him” in the early years of his cricketing career.""This is an honour not just for me, but all those who played with me at different levels including at the international level."" ""This is all because of them and so I believe that is an honour of everyone. It happens that you are scoring runs, wickets, you need luck and support and the MCA has always supported me. Ajit Wadekar nurtured me. After I made a comeback to Mumbai after two and half years, Ajit Wadekar encouraged me, and he was my captain.""When I was in the Indian team, Wadekar was my captain. If Ajit was here, it would have been great.

Jasprit Bumrah's diet sacrifice for success | Former India coach reveals the changes | BSE

NEW DELHI: Former India off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin has issued a strong warning to Gautam Gambhir ’s new support staff, urging continuity in training methods and cautioning against frequent changes in fitness regimes. His remarks come in the wake of reports that the management has introduced the Bronco test alongside the Yo-Yo test and the 2km time trial as new parameters to measure fitness.Strength and conditioning coach Adrian le Roux, who replaced Soham Desai, reportedly brought in the Bronco test after India’s fast bowlers struggled to sustain their workloads during the recent Anderson–Tendulkar Trophy against England.Speaking on his YouTube channel Ash Ki Baat, Ashwin explained why such abrupt shifts in testing can harm players. “When the trainers change, the testing mechanism changes. The trainer changes, the training schemes change. When this happens, players go through a lot of difficulty. As a player, if you keep changing training schemes, it is virtually very difficult for the players. In many cases, it could also lead to injuries,” he warned.Drawing from his own struggles, Ashwin added: “From 2017 to 2019, I was searching for my training scheme. I have endured this. Soham Desai knows all about this.”The Bronco test, widely used in rugby and football, requires players to run five sets of 20m, 40m and 60m shuttles, amounting to 1,200m. The time taken reflects aerobic endurance and recovery ability.But Ashwin stressed that introducing new systems should not come at the cost of player continuity. “I just want to raise some questions. As a player, the problem is one of continuity. I would really like some continuity. It is important to give that. Whenever a new trainer comes in, he should work with the outgoing trainer for six months to one year to give the handover.”He concluded with a blunt warning: “There is no need to change something that is working. If something is working, then it needs to be discussed and then changed.”",Ravichandran Ashwin has issued a strong warning to Gautam Gambhir ’s new support staff.

Reserves: Prasidh Krishna, Washington Sundar, Riyan Parag, Dhruv Jurel, Yashasvi Jaiswal.

NEW DELHI: South Africa legend AB de Villiers has weighed in on India’s Asia Cup 2025 squad, predicting that pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah will not feature in every game of the tournament due to workload management. The 31-year-old fast bowler, who has battled multiple injuries in recent years, was named in the 15-member squad announced last week for the continental showpiece starting September 9.Bumrah played only three out of five Tests on India’s recently concluded tour of England, sparking questions about his fitness and match availability. De Villiers, speaking on his YouTube channel, endorsed the selectors’ cautious approach.“Great to see him in the squad, fit and ready to go. I don’t think he will play all the games,” de Villiers said. “I saw reports saying he will be earmarked for the games that matter and I love that about the selectors being proactive. That’s how you should be managing your senior and most impactful players.”The former Proteas captain stressed the importance of protecting players over 30 from burnout. “It’s not like they are picking and choosing.There’s just so much cricket these days. For your older guys, their work has taken its toll over the years. Once you start managing these players, you will get the best out of them, and I love it that they’ve started doing that with Jasprit Bumrah,” he added.De Villiers also heaped praise on left-arm spinner Kuldeep Yadav, calling him “intelligent and very bold.” He described Kuldeep as a rare cricketer with both bowling skill and athleticism: “He’s got a very good brain and outsmarts the batters.”",South Africa legend AB de Villiers says Jasprit Bumrah will not feature in every game of the Asia Cup 2025.

India Asia Cup squad: Why Shreyas Iyer and Shubman Gill are biggest talking points

NEW DELHI: Former South Africa captain AB de Villiers has expressed his surprise over Shreyas Iyer's omission from India's squad for the upcoming Asia Cup in the UAE, calling the decision ""weird"" and insisting there is ""no cricketing reason"" behind it.Iyer, who piled up over 600 runs in the 2025 IPL season while leading Punjab Kings to the final, was widely expected to be part of India's 15-member squad. He also played a crucial role in India's Champions Trophy triumph earlier this year and was praised by captain Rohit Sharma for repeatedly rescuing the side in pressure situations. But the selectors, led by Ajit Agarkar, left him out altogether, not keeping him the reserves list either.De Villiers, speaking during a live chat on X, said he was baffled by the snub.""It is tough, guys. I was just going through the squad. I was thinking, where can we fit Shreyas in? I think Shreyas will be the most upset because he's played some really good cricket over the last few years. He's matured a lot, he's shown a lot of leadership qualities. But who knows what is going on behind closed doors? Not me. Not you guys. Maybe not even Shreyas knows.""The former Proteas skipper suggested that non-cricketing factors could have influenced the decision.""Sometimes, when it's a 50-50 call between two players, I would always lean towards the guy I feel offers more from a team perspective off the field. Does he add value in the team room? Does he uplift others, or does he drain energy? Maybe it's got something to do with that. I'm just honestly taking a complete guess.""Iyer has not featured in India's T20I squad since December 2023 and has struggled to find a place in Tests as well. De Villiers even speculated whether Iyer's strong leadership presence could have been seen as a potential clash within the squad.""Maybe there are too many leaders there, too many captains. I have no idea, but it's weird to me, a quality player like that, not making the squad, especially with the leadership qualities he's bringing.""De Villiers concluded by urging fans and experts to keep asking questions.""Maybe the truth will come out one day, and we'll know exactly why Shreyas is struggling to get into Team India.""","Shreyas Iyer snubbed from India's squad for the Asia Cup in the UAE.

His son Angad will celebrate his fourth birthday on September 4, just days before India begin their Asia Cup journey.Meanwhile, former India cricketer Mohammed Kaif has thrown his weight behind Bumrah, particularly in response to criticism after the Manchester Test. “Open your mouth carefully because you mentioned that whatever matches we played in England, we lost when he played.You better look at how many matches he has played and India won them, go and find out that as well, regardless of the format,” Kaif said.He added, “When he plays, how many times does he give match-winning performances? Go and find that stat as well. Bumrah is a promising diamond of India. You do not report him. There are no stains on him.”With the Asia Cup on the horizon, Bumrah’s time off with his son has taken the spotlight ahead of the tournament.","Jasprit Bumrah shared a picture with his son Angad on Instagram.

The wife of former cricketer Duncan Pauline has died unexpectedly while shopping at a supermarket in Surrey.Wiyada Pauline, 46, collapsed during a visit to a Waitrose store in Esher earlier this week. Emergency services were called to the supermarket around 6pm on Wednesday following reports of a “concern for safety. ” Despite efforts from medical teams, she was pronounced dead at the scene.The incident led to the closure of the high street and the supermarket while emergency responders attempted to revive her.Pauline, 64, who represented Surrey as an all-rounder for seven years, has been left devastated by the sudden loss of his wife. Speaking to The Sun, he recalled receiving the news. “She went out to Waitrose at about 5.15pm and then I got a call from one of her friends,” he said.“I went up there expecting she’d had a knock on the head but not that she was dead. When I got there the police told me she had passed away.”Wiyada, originally from Thailand, had been planning for retirement in her home country. Pauline described her as being excited about the future before the tragedy struck.""I went up there expecting she'd had a knock on the head but not that she was dead. When I got there the police told me she had passed away.""""She had a cloth over her head and she looked very peaceful when they pulled the cloth off her head. She was only 46, it's a shock that she could go so young. We've been married for 22 years and we were due to retire in a couple of years. She wanted to go back home to Thailand. We even bought a house in Thailand for our retirement - the sad thing is she won't get to do that now,"" he told The Sun.Local police confirmed they were called to the supermarket following reports of a medical emergency. No suspicious circumstances have been reported in connection with her death.Pauline, who played county cricket through the 1980s, is remembered for his all-round abilities and long stint with Surrey.

Bangladesh women’s cricket team’s build-up to the ICC Women’s ODI World Cup has been dented by consecutive defeats against the country’s Under-15 boys in the Challenge Cup.The preparatory tournament, organised by the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB), featured three sides - Women’s Red, Women’s Green and the U-15 boys. While the women’s squads were expected to use the competition to sharpen their game before travelling to India and Sri Lanka, the boys dominated both fixtures.In the first match at BKSP-3, the U-15 side outclassed Women’s Red by 87 runs. Batting first, they posted 181 for 8 in 50 overs, led by Bayzid Bostami (46) and Afzal Hossain (44). In reply, Red folded for just 94 in 38 overs. Alimul Islam Adib starred with the ball, taking 3 for 12, while Afridi Tariq and Abdul Aziz claimed two wickets each. For the women, opener Sarmin Sultana top-scored with 20 as only four batters reached double figures.In the following game, the U-15 team defeated Women’s Green by 41 runs, completing back-to-back wins over their seniors.The setbacks come at a time when Bangladesh have gone five months without international cricket. Their last match was against Pakistan during the World Cup Qualifier on April 19. Since then, the squad has mainly undergone fitness training before assembling for intra-squad matches in Sylhet.Captain Nigar Sultana, who leads the Red side in the Challenge Cup, admitted more international exposure would have been ideal in the lead-up to the tournament.","Bangladesh women’s cricket team have lost to Under-15 boys in Challenge Cup.

Defending champions NorthEast United FC produced a stunning display of attacking football to dismantle debutants Diamond Harbour FC 6-1 in the final of the 134th Durand Cup at the Vivekananda Yuba Bharati Krirangan on Saturday. With six different players on target and talisman Alaaeddine Ajaraie running the show with three assists and a late penalty, the Highlanders sealed back-to-back titles in emphatic fashion — the first team in 25 years to do so.Diamond Harbour’s lone reply came in the 68th minute when Jobby Justin’s header took a deflection off Luka Majcen. By then, though, the contest was long tilted in NorthEast’s favour.Coach Juan Pedro Benali’s side stuck to their trusted 4-3-3 formation, with Parthib Gogoi and Huidom Thoi Singh joining Ajaraie up front. Skipper Miguel Zabaco marshalled the backline, while Spaniards Andy Gaitan and Chema Nunez dictated the tempo in midfield.After a cautious start, NorthEast broke through on the half-hour mark when centre-back Asheer Akhtar pounced on a loose ball from a corner to score. Just before the break, Parthib Gogoi curled home a fine finish to double the lead, leaving Diamond Harbour chasing shadows.The second half saw the champions step on the accelerator. Ajaraie turned provider for Thoi Singh in the 50th minute before Majcen’s fortuitous strike briefly lifted the debutants’ hopes. But substitute Jairo’s thunderous effort in the 81st minute snuffed out any chance of a fightback. Andy and Ajaraie added two more goals late on to complete the rout — also equalling the joint-highest margin of victory in a Durand Cup final since 1896.Ajaraie’s heroics saw him walk away with both the Golden Boot (8 goals) and Golden Ball, while Gurmeet picked up the Golden Glove. NorthEast swept all individual awards, underlining their dominance.As the players lifted the trophy in front of a jubilant crowd, the night marked not just another triumph for the Highlanders, but also a statement that their reign in Indian football’s oldest competition remains unchallenged.","Defending champions NorthEast United FC produced a stunning display of attacking football to dismantle debutants Diamond Harbour FC 6-1 in the final of the 134th Durand Cup.

Poll Who was the standout player for Tottenham in their victory over Manchester City? Brennan Johnson Joao Palhinha Richarlison

Tottenham Hotspur continued their strong start to the Premier League season with a commanding 2-0 victory over Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium on Saturday. Goals from Brennan Johnson and Joao Palhinha sealed the win, giving new coach Thomas Frank another statement result.It was another disappointing afternoon for City against Spurs, who had beaten them 4-0 at the same venue last season. This time too, City were undone by defensive mistakes, with goalkeeper James Trafford enduring a difficult home debut.The first setback came midway through the opening half when Pape Matar Sarr’s clever flick sent Richarlison through on goal. The Brazilian’s low cross found Johnson, who finished with a blistering strike from close range. Although the flag initially went up for offside, a VAR review overturned the decision and the goal stood, sparking loud celebrations from the away fans.City’s problems deepened in first-half stoppage time. Trafford, signed from Burnley this summer for £27 million, tried to play a short pass inside his own box but lost possession under pressure. The loose ball eventually fell to Palhinha, who struck with power to double Spurs’ lead.Trafford had earlier been fortunate to stay on the pitch after a rash challenge on Mohammed Kudus, while his mistake for the second goal only added to scrutiny over his inclusion. First-choice goalkeeper Ederson remained on the bench following illness, with speculation about his future and City’s reported interest in PSG’s Gianluigi Donnarumma continuing in the backdrop.To make matters worse for Pep Guardiola’s side, defender Rayan Ait-Nouri was forced off injured in the first half, with Nathan Ake coming on in his place. From then on, City struggled to regain control and did not look like their usual self or threaten much to claw their way back into the game.For Spurs, the win meant that Frank’s new regime continued on a high, with his side now unbeaten and brimming with confidence early in the campaign.","Tottenham Hotspur beat Manchester City 2-0 at the Etihad Stadium on Saturday.

Will Vladimir Putin attend the World Cup?

US President Donald Trump announced on Friday that Washington's Kennedy Center will host the 2026 FIFA World Cup draw on December 5, during an Oval Office meeting with FIFA President Gianni Infantino where Trump playfully asked to keep the World Cup trophy and suggested Russian President Vladimir Putin might attend the tournament.The 48-team tournament's draw venue announcement comes after Trump recently installed himself as chairman of the Kennedy Center, claiming to combat ""woke"" culture at the venue.Infantino brought the World Cup trophy to the White House for the announcement, allowing Trump to hold it.""Only the FIFA president, presidents of countries, and then those who win can touch it, because it's for winners only. And since you are a winner, of course you can as well touch it,"" Infantino said.""Can I keep it? That's a beautiful piece of gold,"" Trump responded while holding the trophy, apparently in jest.The FIFA Club World Cup trophy, however, remains in the Oval Office more than a month after Chelsea's victory in New Jersey.There was a brief moment of concern when Trump appeared to fumble the World Cup trophy before placing it on his desk, with Infantino reaching out to steady it.Infantino presented Trump with a giant ticket for Row 1 Seat 1 for the World Cup final scheduled for July 19 at the MetLife stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey.Trump discussed Putin's potential attendance at the World Cup, showing a photo he said Putin sent after their recent Alaska summit. ""He wants to be there very badly,"" Trump said, adding that Putin ""may be coming and he may not"" depending on Ukraine peace efforts.The United States was named as joint host with Canada and Mexico during Trump's first term in 2018. After losing to Joe Biden in 2020, Trump won a second term last year.Despite Trump's strict immigration policies, he assured that obtaining visas would be ""very easy"" for most World Cup fans, though acknowledging it would be ""obviously a little bit more difficult"" for visitors from 12 banned nations including Afghanistan, Haiti, and Iran.The draw venue was reportedly changed from Las Vegas to Washington's Kennedy Center, which Trump recently took control of citing concerns about it becoming too ""woke.""The President highlighted a federal crime crackdown in Washington involving National Guard troops, stating this would ensure safety for football fans visiting during the tournament.Trump emphasised the significance of the event, saying ""It's the biggest, probably the biggest event in sports.""","US President Donald Trump announced that Washington's Kennedy Center will host the 2026 FIFA World Cup draw on December 5.

What’s common between the three Formula E world champions

How the three World Champions fared in Formula E Season 11

Days after Oliver Rowland lifted his Formula E World Championship trophy in London this season, an interesting trend has come to the attention of Formula E and its fans. As a coincidence, all Formula E drivers who won the Mexico City E-Prix went on to win the Formula E World Championship that season, and this has been proved right for three consecutive years.Highlighting the same since 2023, a poster of three World Champions was shared on X by Formula E with the caption, “The trend continues. Each winner of the #MexicoCityEPrix from the past three seasons has gone on to become World Champion.”The special poster features 2023 Formula E World Champion Jake Dennis from Andretti, then TAG Heuer Porsche’s Pascal Wehrlein, who won in 2024, and the new World Champion, Nissan driver Oliver Rowland. All three of them won in the Mexico E-Prix and went on to lift the winner’s trophy in the Formula E World Championship that year.Oliver Rowland had strengthened his chances of winning the Formula E World Championship this year much earlier. He was leading the Formula E Driver Standings ever since he won Part 2 of the Jeddah E-Prix, which was his second win of the season after winning the Mexico E-Prix. In the last leg, the Nissan driver got nervous for a while as Pascal Wehrlein, who was following him in the number two position, closed the gap after grabbing quite a few podiums while Rowland had a dull period.Things became serious for Rowland when he failed to finish the Round 13 race in Berlin, while Wehrlein won second spot on the podium. But he eventually managed to confirm his championship in Berlin after four wins and three more podiums.Sharing about his bad race in Berlin, Rowland had said, “I was hoping before the weekend that the outcome could be [the World Championship], but after yesterday (Saturday) and this morning (Sunday), I was more worried that it might never come.”Also Read: Oliver Rowland reacts to daughter’s sweet radio message after Formula E Championship win: “It’s amazing” Things, however, changed for Wehrlein, who was pushed to third position after Nick Cassidy made a late entry in the Formula E Driver Standings by registering three consecutive wins.

Wehrlein registered one win and five more podiums this season.Meanwhile, Andretti driver Jake Dennis finished in seventh position in the Formula E Driver Standings.

Taylor Barnard on losing top three spot in Formula E World Championship

Fans hail Taylor Barnard for his fantastic rookie season

It was Taylor Barnard’s rookie season this year, and the NEOM McLaren driver put up a fantastic performance by temporarily making it to the top three in the Formula E Driver Standings by ousting the much more experienced Porsche driver Antonio Felix Da Costa.

Barnard took to Instagram to share his feelings on losing out on the top three in his first-ever season and his claim to the championship.Taking to Instagram after the London E-Prix, Barnard wrote, “London wasn’t what we hoped for, easily being the toughest weekend of our season. Taking 0 points away as a team from a doubleheader hurts, but one weekend doesn’t define the year we’ve had.”He further wrote, “As the season closes, I want to say a massive thank you to the entire team, both trackside and behind the scenes, for everything this season. Finishing P4 in the Drivers’ Championship and coming into the final weekend with a shot at runner-up is something to be proud of.”Also adding a note for teammate Sam Bird, as NEOM McLaren withdrew from Formula E after the end of the season, Barnard wrote, “@sambird_official it wasn’t the weekend you deserved either.You’ve been a huge part of my season both on and off the track, and I’m grateful for everything.

We couldn’t have done it without you all — your trust and support have never been taken for granted,” he added.Praising the two McLaren drivers, he wrote, “Sam clinched McLaren’s first-ever fully electric win at the São Paulo E-Prix in Season 10, pulling off one of Formula E’s all-time great overtakes, before being waved across the line by none other than Emerson Fittipaldi – McLaren's first Formula 1 World Champion. While Taylor has been a rookie sensation in Season 11, securing five Formula E records, including the youngest driver to start a race, the youngest points scorer, the youngest driver to lead a lap, the youngest podium finisher, and the youngest polesitter. ”He ended the letter saying, “Some of us have been together since the day we first launched this team, while others have seamlessly fitted in along the way and flourished within the environment we have cultivated. For many, I am sure that we will cross paths again soon, but whatever the future holds for those here at Bicester, whatever path they choose to follow, I have no doubt that it will be bright.

How do Formula E and ABB work together?

What do ABB and Formula E say about the partnership?

After a successful Season 11, ABB and Formula E have announced that they will continue their partnership in the upcoming season. This gives ABB another opportunity to promote its new brand positioning via the ABB FIA Formula E World Championship, along with technologies that help industries take a cleaner route.Over a period of eight seasons, the partnership with Formula E has provided ABB a platform to showcase how technology can help industries outrun challenges, engage with customers around the world, and implement its own solutions into the series to improve reliability and efficiency. The partnership extension will provide a year-round opportunity for brand-building and activation, communicating ABB and its technology solutions to new global audiences, including Formula E’s international fanbase.ABB and Formula E will also join hands to engage a new generation of fans, collaborating with unexpected influencers and content creators to tell compelling stories that make advanced electrification and automation technologies tangible and exciting.The end of the mid-race car swap, a 150kW increase in power, top speeds that are 43 percent higher, and energy recovery increasing from 15 to 50 percent indicate how far Formula E technology has come to outperform on track.ABB has also built on its technical involvement in the series, supplying the race chargers from Season 9, and introducing its ABB Ability OPTIMAX® energy management software (Season 9) and Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) technology (Season 5) to the sport.ABB Head of Brand Paco Liebrand said, “We are pleased to be continuing our partnership with Formula E which, like ABB, is striving for a leaner and cleaner future. The synergy between the two organizations, combined with the global appeal of the Championship, makes it a great platform to promote our brand positioning.”He further said, “Formula E is increasingly working with content creators, influencers, and celebrities, with initiatives such as the Evo Sessions making an impact through digital channels beyond the racing itself, which is also an essential part of ABB’s new brand strategy. Going forward, we will be enhancing the way we harness the benefits of this collaboration, ensuring the focus is on delivering content and activations that reinforce our new messaging, build familiarity, and tell the ‘Engineered to Outrun’ story. ”Formula E Chief Revenue Officer Tiziana Di Gioia said, “Our renewed partnership with ABB is a testament to the commercial power and benefit of Formula E as a global platform that drives both brand and business growth. ABB, like our wider partnership portfolio, has and continues to see enormous value in collaborating with the fastest-growing motorsport on the planet, with viewership, commercial integration, and brand storytelling continuing to accelerate. Over eight seasons, ABB has moved from brand visibility to brand activation—integrating deeply into the fan experience, the sport’s ecosystem, and our innovation narrative.Also Read: Antonio Felix Da Costa shares happy memories as Porsche wins Formula E Teams and Manufacturers’ World Championships “This next chapter elevates the partnership even further. With ABB’s new positioning, we are co-creating opportunities across content, digital storytelling, and market engagement, transforming a title partnership into a year-round, value-generating relationship. It’s a model of how modern sponsorships should evolve, rooted in purpose and cultural alignment but measured by impact,” she added.Formula E Season 12 will begin with testing in Valencia in October.","ABB and Formula E have announced that they will continue their partnership in the upcoming season.

The US Open – the year’s final Grand Slam -- may just be the stage for a third force to rise.For two seasons now, the Jannik Sinner-Carlos Alcaraz duopoly has gripped men’s tennis, their epic summer showdowns defining the Tour’s style, skill and spirit. But is the sport teetering under the weight of too much of a good thing?After having never met in a major final - ATP Masters 1000 and above - until May, the World No. 1 and 2 have played each other four times in four months. They split Grand Slam honours with the 24-year-old Sinner triumphing at Wimbledon and the 22-year-old Alcaraz claiming the French Open for his fifth major title.The duo enter the US Open, starting in New York’s Queens borough on Sunday, as the men to beat with draws that, on paper at least, don’t pose too many hurdles.The Italian, still recovering from a virus that took him out of the Cincinnati final a week ago, could play Alexei Popyrin in the second round. A potential fourth-round clash looms against Alexander Bublik, the last man to beat him in a completed match. Alcaraz opens against the big-serving Reilly Opelka and might play the struggling Daniil Medvedev in the fourth round.Prior to Sinner and Alcaraz shared monopoly, for a couple of decades, tennis was dominated by a trimatrix, which was once a quartet. Fans were spoilt for choice. Roger Federer dazzled with staggering range, Rafael Nadal gagged opponents with wicked spin and Novak Djokovic brought a mental edge unlike anything the sport had seen before him.Andy Murray, a three-time major winner, who made eight other finals, provided the grit and guts angle.Djokovic hasn’t gone anywhere. Back-to-back Slam semi-finals that followed his quarter-final win over Alcaraz at Melbourne Park proved as much. Not even a casual observer would rule out the 38-year-old in New York despite not having played a match since Wimbledon.The 24-time major winner billed the possibility of a third factor that could lend a new dimension to the Sinner-Alcaraz reign as the ‘Djoker spot’.“I kind of empathise with the third guy, because I was in those shoes with Federer and Nadal. I want to see a third guy coming in,” said Djokovic, who is Federer’s junior by six years and a year younger than Nadal.The Serbian was 20 when he won his first major title in 2008 at the Australian Open, by which time Federer had racked up 12 majors and Nadal had won Roland Garros thrice.Does Ben Shelton, fresh off an ATP 1000 triumph in Toronto, a home hope in New York, and now ranked at a career-high world No.6, fit the bill of disruptor?The 22-year-old American is playing catch up with his European peers Sinner and Alcaraz particularly when it comes to experience on grass and clay.Shelton had never travelled outside the United States until January 2023 and is playing his 13th major this week. Alcaraz, the 2022 US Open champion, is seven months Shelton’s junior in age, and will contest his 19th major main draw. Sinner, a year older than the American, will play his 24th major main draw.Shelton, who opens against qualifier Ignacio Buse on Sunday, exudes laid back Gen Z swagger that contrasts the demeanour of his more conventional European rivals. A personality as bold as his booming serve. He’s hard to miss anywhere on the grounds with his large over-ear headphones and a hoodie pulled over his burly 6'4"" frame.Shelton’s style is full of dramatic flair that instantly marked him out as a star. His dialled-in post-match celebration became the talking point in 2023. He lifts his hand to his ear, like he’s answering a phone after a win, and then slams it down with a smirk.“I'm an entertainer at heart,” he said on Media Day. “I'm never going to be the guy who is able to robotically go about my business and not change expressions or show any emotion. I play better when I show some emotion.”Shelton, who began 2025 at No. 21 in the rankings, has been consistent in Grand Slams this year, falling to either Sinner or Alcaraz.The left-hander has served 513 aces this season, winning 87 percent of service games and saving 68 percent of break points. His numbers stack up favourably in comparison with the top-two. Sinner has saved 67 percent of break points and won 86 percent of service games, while Alcaraz, the world No.2, is at 64 for break points saved and 84 for service games won.“It seems like if you want to win a big title these days, that's who you've got to go through,” he said of playing Sinner and Alcaraz.Ashe’s blue carpet awaits, two weekends from now, when the loudest parties in tennis take the stage.","Jannik Sinner-Carlos Alcaraz duopoly has gripped men’s tennis for two seasons. World No. 1 and 2 have played each other four times in four months.

Other winners of the evening included Borussia Dortmund, last season's runners-up.Real Madrid tried to extend their winning streak against Liverpool to eight games at Anfield.Alexis MacAllister gave Arne Slot's Premier League leaders the lead early in the second half, but they were too powerful.After an hour, Kylian Mbappe wasted a chance to equalize for Madrid after his penalty was saved, capping a disappointing evening.On minute 76, Liverpool's second goal was headed in by substitute Cody Gakpo after Mohamed Salah missed from the penalty spot at the opposite end.They are the only team in this redesigned Champions League with five straight victories, and they are now assured of making it at least to the February knockout stage play-offs.""You know how special it is to play against a club that won this Champions League so many times, are the reigning champions and were a pain in the ass for Liverpool many times as well,"" said Slot.Real Madrid is now in 24th place, the final qualifying berth for the knockout stage, with six points after losing three of their last five games.Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti had words of comfort for their star French striker, saying: ""This is a difficult moment for Mbappe. We will support him and give him love.""With a 3-0 victory over Dinamo Zagreb in Croatia, Inter Milan is in second place with 13 points, ahead of Barcelona and Dortmund with 12 each.Dortmund took the lead thanks to a fantastic goal from English teenager Jamie Gittens in the first half. Ramy Bensebaini then headed in on minute 56, and Serhou Guirassy, a replacement, completed the victory in the closing minutes.Prior to meeting Juventus, Aston Villa had gone six games without a win across all competitions, after starting the Champions League with three straight wins.Morgan Rogers' goal in stoppage time was disallowed for a foul on goalkeeper Michele Di Gregorio, denying the English team a 0-0 victory.With three games left, Villa is one of seven teams on 10 points, narrowly outside the top eight spots that guarantee direct entrance to the round of 16.Monaco lost to Benfica 3-2 at home in a thrilling match, missing the opportunity to secure their top-eight position.Eliesse Monaco took the lead early thanks to Ben Seghir, but Vangelis Pavlidis scored just after halftime after taking advantage of a defensive blunder.When defender Wilfried Singo was sent off for a second yellow, Monaco was down to 10 men, but Soungoutou Magassa's goal gave them the lead again.But in the end, Benfica's numerical advantage won out when Zeki Amdouni grabbed the winner and Arthur Cabral headed home after 84 minutes.Lille defeated Bologna, who are still without a win, 2-1 in Italy, bringing them closer to guaranteeing at least a play-off spot.The French team's hero was Ngal'ayel Mukau, a midfielder of Belgian descent, who scored two goals, including the first just before halftime.Jhon Lucumi, a Colombian defender, gave Bologna an equalizer, but Mukau scored again at the 66-minute mark to give Lille their third victory in five games.After a 1-1 draw in Glasgow, Celtic and Club Brugge are still on track for the playoffs. The Scottish champions had lost to a ridiculous own goal from Cameron Carter-Vickers, but Daizen Maeda's incredible goal gave them a point.PSV Eindhoven pulled off the night's biggest comeback, defeating Shakhtar Donetsk 3-2 after falling behind 2-0.At the Philips Stadion, the Ukrainians led 2-0 at the half thanks to goals from Oleksandr Zubkov and Danylo Sikan.Pedro Henrique, a Brazilian full-back, was sent off after 69 minutes, but they collapsed in the closing minutes.Malik Tillman equalized in the 90th minute with an incredible long-range effort after the goalie dragged his free-kick across the line in the 87th minute.In the fifth extra minute, Ricardo Pepi, Tillman's fellow American, subsequently scored the winning goal.Red Star Belgrade defeated Stuttgart 5-1 in Serbia after rallying from behind to earn their first points.The Germans took an early lead thanks to Ermedin Demirovic, but Silas Katompa Mvumpa, who was on loan from Stuttgart, pulled even before goals from Rade Krunic and Mirko Ivanic and a brace from Nemanja Radonjic.After defeating Girona 1-0 thanks to a goal from Mika Biereth, Austrian champions Sturm Graz are likewise off the mark.","Liverpool beat Real Madrid 2-0 to become only team with a perfect record in Champions League.

'Bindaas khelne ka': How Suryakumar Yadav's pep talk helped Urvil Patel create history,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/ipl/top-stories/exclusive-bindaas-khelne-ka-how-suryakumar-yadavs-pep-talk-helped-urvil-patel-create-history/articleshow/115737416.cms,"Urvil Patel and Suryakumar Yadav

NEW DELHI: November 27 holds immense significance for Gujarat's young wicketkeeper-batter Urvil Patel . On this day in 2023, just a day after being released by the Gujarat Titans , Urvil smashed an unbeaten 41-ball 100 for Gujarat in a Vijay Hazare Trophy match against Arunachal Pradesh in Chandigarh. That century became the second-fastest by an Indian batter in List A cricket.Exactly a year later, Urvil achieved another remarkable feat, this time in the shortest format.Urvil on Wednesday blasted a 28-ball century in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy against Tripura in Indore. The whirlwind knock is now the second-fastest century in T20 cricket overall and the fastest by an Indian.The 26-year-old’s extraordinary effort -- 35-ball 113, featuring seven fours and 12 sixes -- comes a couple of days after going unsold in the IPL 2025 auction.Despite not being picked by any franchise, Urvil remains undeterred and is focused on his game.""I did expect an IPL deal, to be very honest. But I am happy that I am playing, performing, and taking my game forward. I was watching the auction, but I simply got up and immediately shifted my focus towards my game after not being picked by any franchise. I am not disappointed. This is something not in my hands,"" Urvil told TimesofIndia.com in an exclusive interview.""I just went normally and tried to play my natural game. When I saw some loose deliveries coming, I started hammering them. I got pumped up when the ball was coming right onto the bat. I was enjoying it, and then I went into brutal mode,"" added Urvil, who has represented Gujarat in six first-class and 14 List A matches.The record for the fastest T20 century still belongs to Estonia’s Sahil Chauhan, who achieved it off 27 balls against Cyprus in June 2024.Among Indians, Rishabh Pant held the previous record -- a 32-ball century for Delhi against Himachal Pradesh during the 2018 Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy.Hailing from Kahipur village in Mehsana in Gujarat, Urvil was part of Gujarat Titans in the IPL 2023 season.Bought for Rs 20 lakh, Urvil shared the dressing room with stalwarts like Hardik Pandya, Shubman Gill, David Miller, Kane Williamson and Matthew Wade. The experience at Titans helped him hone his power-hitting skills.Urvil draws inspiration from Suryakumar Yadav and tries to emulate the Indian T20I captain’s dynamic approach in white-ball cricket.""I met Surya bhai during the IPL. I went up to him and straight-up told him that I admire him. He was very happy. He put his hand around my shoulder and said, 'Chal, baat karte hain.' [Let's go and talk]. He gave me a lot of batting tips. He said, 'Bindaas khelne ka. Ball ko dekhna, but pehle bowler ko, uske action ko, uske hand aur finger movement ko. And be confident. Apne aap ko hamesha back karna' [Play fearlessly. Focus on the ball, but first observe the bowler—watch their action, their hand, and finger movements. And be confident. Always back yourself],"" Urvil shared, recalling his interaction with SKY.""I always recall his words whenever I go to the middle. We both bat with the same approach, and it doesn't matter who the bowler is,"" Urvil said.The Gujarat batter also credits Hardik for his guidance.""I have learned from Hardik bhai as well. He is very cool and down-to-earth. You can approach him at any point in time and ask him anything. He is always there to help. I like his aggressive approach. I am still in touch with him,"" Urvil concluded.",Gujarat's Urvil Patel hits second-fastest T20 century by an Indian. Urvil's 35-ball 113 comes a couple of days after going unsold in IPL 2025 auction.

Where will KL Rahul bat when Rohit Sharma returns to Playing XI for Adelaide Test

NEW DELHI: Former India batting icon Sunil Gavaskar drew a comparison between the period when tennis greats Roger Federer Rafael Nadal , and Novak Djokovic were without titles with Virat Kohli 's struggles before the former captain struck a magnificent hundred in the first Test in Perth in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy .""I said in commentary that Roger Federer, Novak Djokovic, and Rafa Nadal, they are title winners. If they lose in the semi-finals, people say, 'Oh, they're not in form.' Anybody else getting into the semi-finals, you would say, 'Oh, what a wonderful performance.'""Similarly, with Virat Kohli, because everybody is so used to him scoring so many hundreds quite regularly, when he doesn't score 100, even if he's getting 70-80 -- which a lot of guys will be very happy to get -- people say, 'Look, he's not scoring runs.' And that is the reason why there was that feeling.""But then again, Indian fans, they're greedy fans. They're not going to be happy with their idol scoring only 60-70s. They want their icons, their idols, to score hundreds, and that is the reason there was this little talk about, 'Oh, he hasn't got a hundred since July 2023.' July 2023 is just about a year ago,"" Gavaskar said on Star Sports.Kohli neutralized the Australian assault and regained his former form in the second innings of the Perth Test thanks to a minor change in batting stance, according to Gavaskar.Following a poor run of form in all formats in recent months, Kohli traveled to Australia. His inability to control spin on turning tracks cast doubt on his team position.But in the first Test at Perth, he hushed his critics by scoring his 30th Test ton. After the 121 he scored against the West Indies at Port of Spain in July 2023, this was his first century.""His body was completely relaxed when he came into bat in the second innings. In the first innings, because of the fact that India had lost two wickets early, he would have also been under pressure,"" Gavaskar added.""In that second innings, you could sense apart from changing that stance, I think he also got his legs, which were maybe just a little bit wider at the start. Just a little bit, maybe I'm thinking too much, but that little thing might have given him that height he wanted. Well, in Australia, on the bouncier pitches, you need that edge.""I liked that mid-wicket boundary that he hit off Hazlewood. That, to me, was not the easiest of shots. A straight drive is a little easier because your stance is like that, but just to open up a little bit and play that - that was all magic.""In the second essay, when Australian bowlers desperately tried the off-stump line, short ball tactic, and even attacking the line of stump to get the seasoned batter out after he was dismissed on five in the first innings, Kohli used all of his technical skills to deal with the whims of variable bounce.In his comments on Kohli 's stance changes in the second innings, former Australian cricketer Matthew Hayden said that Kohli was successful in being more upright on a ground with varying bounce.""It's a very good point because the reverse can be said also to someone touring to India and having to lower their stance. I know I certainly did that. But being able to be a little more upright means that your head position has to stay on top of the bounce so that it starts to work in your favour.""I said right from the start that I actually liked his move, batting in more line with the ball. I thought that was a good strategy. I think he loves to play like that, and we saw some classic cases where he just eased the ball through mid-wicket. But you can't do that from outside off stump, so getting into the line, I thought, was important.""""The other little adjustment that you mentioned, being a little more upright, so he could stay on top of the bounce, was also really important. If you're getting closer to the ball like he was -- another thing, I think, was probably playing the ball later.""When he's not in his best form, he goes quite hard, feeling for the ball. He wants to feel the ball on the bat, particularly on the front foot. But he just seemed to give himself a little more time and be a little softer.""",Sunil Gavaskar compares Virat Kohli's struggles with tennis greats Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic. Former India captain says Indian fans were not happy with Kohli scoring only 60-70s.

Yashasvi Jaiswal and Jasprit Bumrah stole the show in India's Perth win

NEW DELHI: Australian batter Travis Head has dismissed claims of a rift within the Test team following comments made by fast bowler Josh Hazlewood , which sparked speculation about a potential divide in the dressing room.Hazlewood addressed the media after day three of the match and was questioned about Australia's approach to day four, given their daunting position at 3-12, chasing an improbable target of 534. His remarks were interpreted by some as hinting at a split within the side, prompting rumours of discord.Responding to a query, Hazlewood stated that he's looking forward to the second Test rather than stressing about the current situation.“You probably have to ask one of the batters that question. I’m sort of relaxing and trying to get a bit of physio and a bit of treatment, and I’m probably looking mostly towards the next Test and what plans we can do against these batters,"" Hazlewood told mediapersons on Day 3.""That to me tells me there is potentially a divided change room. I don’t know if there is. I might be reading too much into that,"" reacted Adam Gilchrist on the situation.Former England captain Michael Vaughan said he was “staggered” by Hazlewood’s comments.""Publicly, I’ve never heard an Australian come out and divide the camp as batters and bowlers,” Vaughan told Fox Cricket.However, reacting to the matter, Head quashed such speculations, emphasising the unity and camaraderie within the Australian camp despite the challenging circumstances.""I think (people have) picked the bones out of a comment on the back of a poor week, which is fine. All the boys hung out together last night, nothing changed in the way we were as a group,"" Head told 7NEWS.""We stuck together, had some good conversations as we always would, win or draw. It’s a pretty level group. No doubt there was a lot of disappointment around the room but definitely no fractions,"" he added.After Hazlewood's comments, Australian skipper Pat Cummins has emphatically denied any split within the team's dressing room.""It’s a really tight unit. It’s probably one of the tightest teams I’ve ever played with. We really enjoy playing cricket together,"" Cummins said.","Travis Head has dismissed claims of a rift within the Australian Test team.

IPL's first indigenous player Robin Minz glad for chance 'to rise after a fall',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/ipl/top-stories/ipls-first-indigenous-player-robin-minz-glad-for-chance-to-rise-after-a-fall/articleshow/115751270.cms,"Robin Minz (ANI Photo)

Though India player Ishan Kishan remains the biggest grosser among the three Jharkhand cricketers sold at 2025 IPL mega auction in Jeddah, all eyes will be on two other young wicketkeeper-batters from the state – Robin Minz and Kumar Kushagra. Both got richer by Rs. 75 lakh each on Sunday evening, while Kishan moved to Sunrisers Hyderabad from Mumbai Indians with Rs. 11.25cr in his kitty.Getting sold for 'just' Rs. 75 lakh to Mumbai Indians during the 2025 IPL mega auction might look poor compared to what Minz attracted at the 2024 mini auction. The first Adivasi (indigenous) player in IPL history was bought by Gujarat Titans for a whooping Rs 3.6 cr a year ago.However, a freak bike accident ahead of the 2024 season ruled Minz out of any IPL action. As Minz gets ready to take his flamboyance in domestic cricket to the biggest stage in franchise cricket in the upcoming season, there is much more to the price tag.Currently, Minz is busy playing in Syed Muhstaq Ali Trophy with his Jharkhand teammates. So repeated calls to the 22-year-old went unanswered. But his father, Francis Xavier Minz's phone was busy talking to relatives and well-wishers since Sunday evening.Talking to TOI from the Ranchi airport, where the former Army man works as security guard, Xavier said, ""We are incredibly happy that Robin has again got the chance to prove himself at the biggest stage (IPL). Robin had called yesterday right after his deal, he was very happy, too. We are not at all bothered that he has been sold for Rs. 75 lakh this year. Even if he was sold for Rs. 20 or 30 lakh it was okay for us. It is always good to rise after a fall, that brings more happiness and satisfaction.""Pointing at his son's prospect of facing Jasprit Bumrah at the Mumbai Indians nets, Xavier further added, ""MI is a very big team, they have so many big players. Robin will get chance to play, practice alongside the likes of Rohit Sharma, Hardik Pandya and Jasprit Bumrah. I think, getting the chance to play Bumrah at the nets for 2-3 months will be the biggest learning experience for Robin this season. He's the best bowler in the world now, so there's lot to learn from him. We just hope Robin gets to play as many matches as possible.""A day after being bought by MI, Minz underscored his credentials as a big-hitting wicketkeeper-batter with a brisk, unbeaten 36 off 12 balls with five fours and two sixes in Jharkhand's 88-run win over Manipur in Mumbai on Monday.",Robin Minz and Kumar Kushagra both got richer by Rs. 75 lakh each on Sunday evening.

KOLKATA: Despite not having the best of batting or wicketkeeping techniques, Mahendra Singh Dhoni enjoyed great success as a player-captain in his long career thanks to his presence of mind and street smartness – good to discuss but difficult to learn and follow.Jharkhand youngster Kumar Kushagra , who has a similar playing role like his illustrious statemate, got a peep into that brilliant mind Dhoni possesses during a chat on the sidelines of an Indian Premier League ( IPL ) game last season.Bought by Gujarat Titans for Rs.75 lakh in the IPL mega auction last Sunday, the 20-year-old aims to execute the lessons he learned from that little talk with Dhoni with notable performances this season in the domestic tournaments and IPL.Sharing the importance of his conversation with Dhoni, Kushagra, who played for Delhi Capitals last season, said, “I haven’t met him in any Jharkhand game or camps or in Ranchi. I met him only once after an IPL match last season (after the Delhi-Chennai game, which Kushagra didn’t play). I asked him a few questions about improving my game, and he gave me some advice. I try to apply that in my captaincy (for Jharkhand) and wicketkeeping and that has helped me prepare better for different match situations. I feel my game reading has improved after that chat with Dhoni bhai.”Kushagra, who is currently playing in Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy with the Jharkhand team, believes he’s better prepared for IPL this time around.“Experience matters a lot, especially in the T20 format. Handling pressure comes with experience, and you can’t understand it until you’ve been through it. Last year, I was a bit inexperienced, but this year I’ve played many high-pressure tournaments like the Duleep Trophy,” he told TOI from Mumbai late on Tuesday.Despite many wicketkeeper-batters in the squads these days, Kushagra knows what he has to do. “Everyone’s role in the team is different – someone plays in the top-order, some in middle or as opener. If I ever play for India, nobody knows where I’ll play. I don’t see it as competition. In today’s cricket , you need to be a versatile player.“My focus is on improving my game and being ready for any opportunity by performing well in domestic tournaments like Mushtaq Ali and Vijay Hazare. From No. 3-5, whichever position I get to play I have to prove my worth. Now with the Impact Player rule (in IPL), you get a chance to come in and play at crucial moments, so you must be prepared for any kind of situation.”During the mini auction last year, Delhi Capitals had roped in Kushagra for a staggering Rs.7.2cr, but he failed to draw a similar price tag this time. Despite that the youngster is more than pleased to get a chance to play in IPL.“I’m happy because getting into IPL is a big deal, and being in a new team and environment is exciting. I’m not too concerned about the money because I’m still in my learning stage. My main focus is to make the most of the matches I get and to create opportunities to play for the Indian team in future,” he said.",Jharkhand youngster Kumar Kushagra got a peep into that brilliant mind Dhoni possesses during a chat on the sidelines of an IPL game last season.

Kolkata: In another dominant show Bengal crushed Mizoram by eight wickets to record a hat-trick of wins in a Group ‘A’ Syed Mushtaq Ali (T20) match in Rajkot on Wednesday. The victory helped the Sudip Gharami-led side tie with Rajasthan at 12 points but the latter with a better run-rate occupy the top spot now.Asked to bat first, Mizoram put up a decent total of 157 for four thanks to Mohit Jangra’s unbeaten 80. Pacer Mohammed Shami , who provided Bengal the winning momentum against Hyderabad in the last match with a three-wicket burst, had a bad day in office going for 46 runs in his four overs without a wicket. Jangra took the pacer, on a comeback trail from injury, to the cleaners hitting him for three sixes.Mizoram openers Jehu Anderson and Agni Chopra gave them a fluent start collecting 33 runs before Anderson was bowled by Kanishk Seth for 14 in the fifth over. Chopra departed soon after when Sayan Ghosh, playing his first match this season, had him caught by Seth.But Jangra prevented Bengal bowlers from making further inroads stitching together two important partnerships. First he was involved in a 55-run third-wicket stand with Muanzuala and then played an unbroken 57-run stand with Lalhriatrenga that helped Mizoram get a fighting total. Jangra’s 49-ball innings included seven boundaries and four sixes.Bengal openers Abhishek Porel and Karan Lal were in no mood to give their rivals any chance as they once again gave the side a flying start putting on 131 runs in 13 overs. Porel carried on his form from the last match against Hyderabad, hitting nine fours and four sixes while facing 45 deliveries to pick up the man-of-the-match award.By the time Lala departed in the 15th over for a well-made 67 off 40 balls with the help of seven fours and three sixes, Bengal had almost wrapped up things. Shakir Gandhi and Ritwik Roy Chowdhury completed the formalities in the next over.Brief scores: Mizoram 157/4 in 20 ovs (M Jangra 80*; Karan Lal 1-14, Sayan Ghosh 1-22). Bengal 158/2 in 15.3 ovs (Abhishek Porel 81, K Lal 67; K Vanrotlinga 2-35).

They did not have a flying start like the previous two matches as they lost both the openers Abhijeet Tomar (18: 14b, 1x4, 1x6) and Bharat Sharma (3) cheaply.Experienced campaigner Deepak Hooda and Kartik Sharma then repaired the early damage and consolidated their side from a precarious position of 26/2 with some bold batting display.The combination of Hooda and Kartik added 97 runs in quick time to give the innings an ideal momentum. Hooda departed for 46 off 30 balls which was laced with three boundaries and equal number of sixes. Kartik, who later adjudged as man-of-the-match, went on to complete his half-century but was dismissed for 58. His 27-ball knock consisted of four boundaries and five towering sixes. Zubair Ali (31: 20b, 1x4, 2x6) and Deepak Chahar (14: 11b) gave the innings a grand finish after captain Mahipal Lamror’s rare failure. Ravi Teja and Anikethreddy bagged two wickets each for Hyderabad.Tilak Varma-led Hyderabad got off to a cautious start while chasing a daunting target. Veteran pacer Aniket Choudhary emerged as the hero for Rajasthan as he sent back opener Rahul Singh (3) and Varma (13) in his second and third over, respectively. Tanmay Agarwal (33), Tanay Thyagarajan (32 not out) and Rahul Buddhi (29) tried hard to keep Hyderabad in contention, but Rajasthan bowlers bowled a good line and supported by sharp fielding, restricted their rivals to 163 for 8. Left-arm spinner Manav Suthar grabbed a couple of wickets, while Hooda, Deepak Chahar and Kamlesh Nagarkoti chipped in with a wicket apiece.With this third win on the trot, Rajasthan are now jointly leading Group A with 12 points along with Bengal. Rajasthan will take on Meghalaya in their next match.Rajasthan 187/8 in 20 overs (Kartik Sharma 58, Deepak Hooda 46, Zubair Ali 31, Abhijeet Tomar 18, Deepak Chahar 14; Ravi Teja 2-32, Anikethreddy 2-42) beat Hyderabad 163/8 in 20 overs (Tanmay Agarwal 33, Tanay Thyagarajan 32 not out, Rahul Buddhi 29, Prateek Reddy 23; Manav Suthar 2-10, Aniket Choudhary 2-23, Deepak Hooda 1-25, Deepak Chahar 1-35, Kamlesh Nagarkoti 1-45) by 24 runs.",Kartik Sharma scored 58 as Rajasthan beat Hyderabad by 24 runs in Rajkot.

Don't look at captaincy as a post but responsibility: Jasprit Bumrah

NEW DELHI: Australian all-rounder Glenn Maxwell has hailed Indian pacer Jasprit Bumrah as one of the toughest bowlers he has ever faced. Describing the challenge as 'incredibly difficult', Maxwell praised Bumrah's unique action, pace, and precision, which make him a nightmare for batters.Maxwell considers Bumrah as a potential candidate for the greatest fast bowler in cricket history, citing his distinctive bowling technique and exceptional delivery skills.The Perth Test match against Australia showcased Bumrah's exceptional leadership and bowling prowess. His outstanding performance, which included a five-wicket haul in the first innings and a total of eight wickets, was instrumental in India's decisive 295-run triumph.Maxwell said that Bumrah's impact on cricket transcends mere statistics when evaluating his status amongst the sport's legendary figures.""Bumrah is going to go down as potentially the best fast bowler of all time. It might not be about the number of wickets he takes across formats, but for the players who have faced him, it's incredibly difficult. He has such a unique action and an extraordinary ability with the ball. He's the complete package,"" said Maxwell on 'The Grade Cricketer podcast'.""He can move the ball both ways, rush you with pace, and beat you on the inside and outside edges. Plus, he has an effective slower ball,"" he added.Bumrah's outstanding performance secured him the 'Player of the Match' award, whilst simultaneously propelling him past Kagiso Rabada of South Africa and Josh Hazlewood of Australia to regain his position as the premier bowler in Test cricket rankings.Bumrah's match-winning effort also earned him the 'Player of the Match' award, and he surpassed South Africa's Kagiso Rabada and Australia's Josh Hazlewood to reclaim his place as the top-ranked bowler in Test cricket.In his 41-Test career till date, Bumrah has demonstrated exceptional bowling prowess, claiming 181 wickets while maintaining an outstanding average of 20.06.His finest bowling performance yielded figures of 6/27, and he has achieved five-wicket hauls on 11 occasions. His performances in Australian conditions have been particularly noteworthy, where he has secured 40 wickets at an excellent average of 18.80, including two five-wicket hauls with his best figures being 6/33.","Australian all-rounder Glenn Maxwell hails Indian pacer Jasprit Bumrah as one of the toughest bowlers he has ever faced.

KOLKATA: Dial ‘C’ when in trouble. And Bengaluru FC did just that to get past Mohammedan Sporting Club 2-1 in their ISL match at the Kishore Bharati Krirangan here on Wednesday.Down 0-1, Sunil Chhetri joined action in the 53rd minute and immediately made an impact by injecting momentum in the team’s attack. The former India international then made all the difference by scoring from the spot in the 82nd minute and finishing off things with a well-timed jump to head one that went in kissing Florent Ogier’s head in the added-on time. The victory saw BFC dethrone Mohun Bagan from the top of points table with 20 points, three more than Bagan playing a game less, from nine matches.Chhetri and records go hand-in-hand and on Wednesday the striker added one more by becoming the first player in ISL history to score against 15 different opponents.It was another heartbreak for Mohammedan who continued to wait for their maiden win at home once again suffering reverse late in a match.Contrary to the trend this season where Mohammedan have taken in four goals in the opening 15 minutes, it was the black-and-white brigade which drew first blood when an unmarked Cesar Manzoki headed in from a corner kick in the eighth minute of the match to put the hosts ahead.Stunned by the reverse, Bengaluru took time to settle down and started playing possession football to get a grip on proceedings. They came close to scoring when Argentina’s Pereyra Diaz back-heeled to Australian Dale Williams but the latter’s shot was timely blocked by Zuidika.Mohammedan too got their chance in the second half but Alexis Gomes, replacing Brazilian attacker Carlos Franca, hit back-to-back shots, which were negated by diving goalkeeper Gurpreet Singh before the second drinks break.Scorer Manzoki was guilty of grabbing Luis Pedro in a melee during a corner kick which forced referee Crystal John to award a penalty. Super-sub Chhetri equalised, placing the ball to the right of goalkeeper Bhaskar Roy. The 40-year-old showed glimpses of his vintage form when he anticipated a cross well and made a good connection that went in touching defender Ogier’s head silencing the home supporters.","Bengaluru FC dethrone Mohun Bagan from the top of points table with 20 points, three more than Bagan playing a game less.

Punjab did exactly that on Tuesday, winning 3-0 at the Mumbai Football Arena to move into fourth spot with a smart tactical game. Panagiotis Dilmperis's side have 15 points from eight games, while Mumbai City remain in 10th spot with 10 points.It was a well-earned victory as Punjab not only neutralised the threat that the ISL Cup champions pose with their passing game but also effectively found the opportunities to score on either side of the half-time break. Their third goal in the 84th minute put a stamp of authority on their victory.Norbert Ezequiel Vidal put the visitors ahead with a left foot placement in added-on time of the first half. Immediately after the break, Mumbai City substitute Franklin Nazareth fouled Filip Mrzjlak inside the box and Luka Majcen stepped up to score from the spot in the 53rd minute. Punjab's third goal came from the foot of Norwegian forward Mushaga Bakenga , who shot from inside the box even as Mumbai's defence was guilty of being too slow to react.Punjab cut down the space that Mumbai's pacy wingers Lallianzuala Chhangte and Bipin Singh thrive in. Punjab played great defence, thanks to some robust play, and plonked two central midfielders ahead of their four-man defence to blunt the threats posed by Jon Miquel Toral Harper and Jayesh Rane, as Brandon Fernandes started on the bench.After the initial skirmishes, it was the Islanders who showed some keenness with a few moves and openings that tested the Punjab defence. But the visitors rode it. At times they even managed to isolate the Mumbai defence and it was one such move that provided Vidal with the opportunity to shoot from outside the box.After conceding the second goal, Mumbai pushed up, and with a quarter of an hour left, they seemed to have scored from a corner. Without the aid of VAR, however, it would have been asking a lot from the officials to notice that the ball seemed to have crossed the goalline as TV replays showed. Then came the third Punjab goal, leaving Mumbai City coach Petr Kratky to reflect on his team's first home loss in nine matches.","Norbert Ezequiel Vidal put the visitors ahead with a left foot placement in added-on time of the first half.

(Reuters)

Pep Guardiola sustained cuts and scratches on his face during Manchester City’s 3-3 draw with Feyenoord in the UEFA Champions League , acknowledging that the fans had every right to boo the team following their dramatic collapse.City made history as the first team in Champions League history to lead by three goals as late as the 75th minute and still fail to win.After the match, Guardiola, sporting a cut on his nose and scratches on his forehead, explained that the injuries were self-inflicted, jokingly adding, “I want to harm myself,” before leaving the press conference.Josko Gvardiol was responsible for the first two goals conceded, but Guardiola quickly defended him. Despite this, the supporters expressed their frustration as City extended their winless streak to six games.“After the last game against Tottenham, where we lost 4-0, they were there supporting us, applauding. Of course, they’re disappointed. I’m not here to remind them of past successes; I’m here to see the team win and perform well. They support us consistently, and they’re right to express how they feel.”The draw marked the first time in Guardiola’s managerial career that one of his teams squandered a three-goal lead.Gvardiol, who had a poor performance against Spurs, was again at fault for the Dutch side’s first two goals. Guardiola emphasised Gvardiol's youth and potential, saying, “He is so young; he will learn. In the past, he was the best player on the pitch, but it would be wrong to blame him for our defeat. He is a fantastic player and needs support now more than ever.”Guardiola now faces the challenge of motivating his players ahead of their match against Premier League leaders Liverpool on Sunday, which will test their resilience.“There was no need to say anything to them; they know what happened,” he stated. “We had three opportunities to win, but it’s tough to accept.

INTER TAKE LEAD WITH NARROW WIN OVER LEIPZIG

(With inputs from agencies)

Manchester City ’s woes deepened in the Champions League on Tuesday as Pep Guardiola’s side squandered a 3-0 lead to draw 3-3 with Feyenoord at the Etihad Stadium.Meanwhile, Bayern Munich defeated Paris Saint-Germain, putting the French club on the brink of elimination. Elsewhere, Arsenal, Atletico Madrid, Atalanta, and Bayer Leverkusen claimed dominant wins, while Inter Milan climbed to the top of the standings after five matches.The most dramatic action unfolded in Manchester, where City seemed to be cruising after goals from Erling Haaland (two, including a penalty) and Ilkay Gundogan’s deflected strike gave them a 3-0 advantage by the 57th minute.However, Feyenoord’s comeback began in the 75th minute when Anis Hadj Moussa capitalized on defensive errors to score. Substitute Santiago Gimenez reduced the deficit further in the 82nd minute, and the equalizer came a minute from full-time.Igor Paixao set up David Hancko, who headed home to complete a remarkable turnaround.Lewandowski notched his 100th goal in the competition with an early penalty in Barcelona's 3-0 home win over French side Brest.Dani Olmo netted midway through the second half before Lewandowski sealed Barca's win at the death, his 101st goal in the Champions League -- only Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi have scored more.Inter lead the standings with 13 points, a point ahead of Barcelona and Liverpool, after a 1-0 win at home to RB Leipzig which means they are also still yet to concede a goal.Castello Lukeba's own goal made the difference at San Siro, and Leipzig are one of only three teams to have lost five games out of five.Arsenal romped to a 5-1 victory away to Sporting in Lisbon, as the Portuguese side adapt to life without coach Ruben Amorim, who has departed for Manchester United.Gabriel Martinelli, Kai Havertz and Gabriel Magalhaes all scored in the first half for Arsenal, before Goncalo Inacio pulled one back shortly after the restart.Bukayo Saka converted a penalty on 65 minutes after Martin Odegaard had been brought down, and Leandro Trossard headed in to seal Arsenal's win late on.Atalanta romped to a 6-1 win over rock-bottom Young Boys in Switzerland, with Mateo Retegui and Charles De Ketelaere both scoring braces.Sead Kolasinac and Lazar Samardzic also netted for the Italians, with Silvere Ganvoula getting the hosts' reply.Florian Wirtz struck twice, including a penalty, as Leverkusen crushed Red Bull Salzburg 5-0, with Alejandro Grimaldo scoring a superb free-kick and Patrik Schick and Aleix Garcia also netting.Julian Alvarez and substitute Angel Correa each scored twice and Marcos Llorente and Antoine Griezmann once as Atletico romped to a 6-0 win away to Sparta Prague.Christian Pulisic, Rafael Leao and Tammy Abraham were the scorers in AC Milan's 3-2 win at Slovan Bratislava, whose goals came from Tigran Barseghyan and Nino Marcelli.Marko Tolic saw red at the end for Slovan, who are without a point.Bukayo Saka scored one goal and set up another as Arsenal thrashed Portuguese side Sporting 5-1 in their Champions League clash at the Estadio Jose Alvalade on Tuesday, their biggest away win in the competition in 21 years.Gabriel Martinelli put Arsenal ahead early on before Kai Havertz and Brazilian defender Gabriel added two more goals before halftime as Arsenal overwhelmed their hosts.Goncalo Inacio pulled a goal back for Sporting early in the second period, but Saka restored Arsenal's three-goal advantage with a penalty and Leandro Trossard got a fifth for their biggest away win in the Champions League since victory by the same scoreline at Inter Milan in 2003.Arsenal moved above Sporting to seventh place in the 36-team table with 10 points from their five games. The Portuguese side have the same number of points but are one position back on goal-difference.Inter Milan took another step towards direct qualification for the last 16 of the Champions League with Tuesday's 1-0 win over Leipzig which moved the Italians top of the table.Castello Lukeba's own goal midway through the first half was enough for Inter, who are the only team yet to concede a goal, to win their fourth straight match in Europe's elite club competition.Italian champions Inter lead Barcelona and Liverpool, who host Real Madrid on Wednesday, by a point after a narrow win which should have finished with a more emphatic scoreline for the hosts.Simone Inzaghi's side return to their Serie A title defence at high-flying Fiorentina on Sunday after a routine win at a far from full San Siro which makes a top-eight finish extremely likely with three matches remaining.","Manchester City squandered a 3-0 lead to draw 3-3 with Feyenoord at the Etihad Stadium.

On reaching the right of the box, he put the ball into the path of an advancing Rahul KP, who slotted the ball into the net.

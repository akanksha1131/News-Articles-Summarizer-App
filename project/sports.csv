'Daring, Dynamic, Different': Ponting hails PBKS young guns despite final loss





NEW DELHI: Virat Kohli couldn’t hold back his emotions as Royal Challengers Bengaluru finally ended their 18-year wait for an IPL title. But in the moment of triumph, Kohli made sure two of RCB’s greatest stalwarts — AB de Villiers and Chris Gayle — were front and centre in the celebration.After RCB defeated Punjab Kings by six runs in a tense IPL 2025 final, Kohli dedicated the title to the two legendary former teammates who shaped the franchise’s identity alongside him.“I have spent my prime years with them. I know how much we tried to win this. We were so close a couple of times, and we were such a good team; we had the explosiveness, but we could never cross the line. We gave our prime years to this franchise,” Kohli said, visibly emotional in his post-match chat with broadcasters.De Villiers and Gayle were on the sidelines at Ahmedabad’s Narendra Modi Stadium, witnessing the final chapter of a dream they once relentlessly pursued with Kohli. The trio were instrumental in RCB’s rise as one of the IPL’s most-followed teams, with the 2016 season — where they narrowly missed the title — etched in memory.“I promise you this feels 10 times more special because these two are standing next to me. Honestly, it is as much theirs as it is mine,” Kohli added. “These guys have given everything to this team. When they come to Bengaluru, people go berserk. It is equally their trophy.”De Villiers scored 4,522 runs for RCB at a strike rate of 158.33, while Gayle amassed 3,163 runs with five centuries, including the iconic 175 not out. For Kohli, this win wasn’t just redemption — it was legacy fulfilled, and shared.",Royal Challengers Bengaluru beat Punjab Kings by six runs in the IPL 2025 final.

As Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) take on Punjab Kings (PBKS) in the IPL 2025 final at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad, former India opener Virender Sehwag has taken centre stage — not with a bat, but with his signature humour.In a conversation with Cricbuzz, Sehwag was asked to pick a winner between the two franchises, both of whom are yet to win an IPL trophy despite being part of the league since its 2008 inception.Sehwag's response? A classic jibe laced with superstition and self-awareness.""I think RCB will win,"" Sehwag said with a smile. ""I've gone back to my old form because the team I support usually loses. Be it Gujarat Titans vs Mumbai Indians or Punjab Kings vs RCB — every time I pick a side, they lose.""Also See: IPL Final Live Score, RCB vs PBKS Sehwag then cheekily revealed that he's trying to apply the same ‘reverse jinx' logic here. ""I supported MI in Qualifier 2 against PBKS, and they lost.

RCB, under the inspirational presence of Virat Kohli , are chasing redemption after three previous final losses.

NEW DELHI After 18 long years of near misses and heartbreaks, Virat Kohli finally led Royal Challengers Bengaluru to their first-ever Indian Premier League title, sealing a tense six-run victory over Punjab Kings in a pulsating final at the Narendra Modi Stadium on Tuesday night.As the last ball was bowled and victory was confirmed, Kohli’s emotions overflowed. Tears streamed down his face as he hugged his wife, Anushka Sharma , and placed a kiss on her forehead to mark his happiness.Speaking to broadcasters, Kohli also credited Anushka for the role she played in his IPL-winning moment that came after 18 years.""Watching us just miss out. What your life partner does for you to be able to play — the sacrifices, the commitment, and just backing you through thick and thin — is something you can’t explain in words,"" Kohli said.""Only when you play professionally do you understand the many things that go on behind the scenes and what they go through as well. What Anushka has gone through emotionally — watching me being down and out, coming to games, being so connected with Bangalore (she’s a Bangalore girl as well), and being connected to RCB — this is very, very special for her, and she’s going to be so, so proud. Thank you,"" he added.Kohli remains a firm advocate for Test cricket, once again expressing his opinion about youngsters playing the longest format after Royal Challengers Bengaluru ended their 18-year-long drought to win the IPL title.Kohli announced his retirement during the 2025 IPL season and will not be part of the side facing England for five Test matches over the next two months. His last appearance in the format came against Australia in the Border Gavaskar Trophy 2024/25.Kohli believes there is nothing more important than playing Test cricket and said that only after performing in the longest format will the world truly respect a player for his game.“You know, this moment is right up there with the best moments I've had in my career. But it still marks five levels under Test cricket. That's how much I value Test cricket. And that's how much I love Test cricket.""So I would just urge the youngsters coming through, to treat that format with respect. Because if you perform in Test cricket, you walk around anywhere in the world, people look you in the eye and shake your hand and say, 'Well done, you played the game really well'. So if you want to earn respect in world cricket all over, take up Test cricket, and give your heart and soul to it. And when you walk out with wonders on the other side, then you gain respect to the cricket world with legends like yourself melting our hearts on the field and off the field,"" Kohli said on Tuesday.Kohli bid adieu to his Test career with 9,230 runs in 123 matches at an impressive average of 46.85, including 30 centuries and 31 half-centuries. He wrapped up his Test career as the fourth-most successful Test captain overall with 40 wins, behind Graeme Smith (53 wins), Ricky Ponting (48 wins), and Steve Waugh (41 wins). He also holds the record for the most Test hundreds by an Indian captain, with 20 tons — far ahead of Sunil Gavaskar’s 11 centuries.",Royal Challengers Bengaluru end 18-year-long drought to win IPL title.

Jadon Sancho will leave Chelsea when his loan spell ends on June 30 after failing to agree on personal terms for a permanent transfer, despite having helped the club secure Champions League qualification with a fourth-place Premier League finish. The Englishman scoring in the UEFA Conference League final against Real Betis was not enough to hand him a permanent deal at Stamford Bridge.The 25-year-old winger joined Chelsea last summer from Manchester United on a temporary deal that included a £25million obligation to buy clause, subject to personal terms being agreed upon with the player.However, the club have opted against it and will now have to pay a fine of £5million to get out of the obligation. The Manchester United player, who still has a year left on his deal at Old Trafford is now exploring options both in England and across Europe for his next move.During his time at Chelsea, Sancho's numbers did not amount to anything significant, although he bagged five goals and ten assists in 42 appearances across all competitions.Speaking after the Conference League final, Maresca addressed Sancho's future, stating: ""From now on is when we sit down with the club and decide about next year.""The manager further praised Sancho's contribution, saying: ""Jadon Sancho, if we finished fourth, it's because of Jadon, if we won tonight it's because of Jadon. It's also because of Robert Sanchez — during the season, everyone is up and down a little bit, that's part of the game. ""While unable to strike a deal with the Blues, the 25-year-old is on the lookout for a new club, be it in the Premier League or elsewhere. While United prepares to negotiate with other clubs to offload the high-wage winger, who reportedly makes close to£300,000 a week, his current wage may prevent a permanent deal from materialising. Sancho has been linked with the likes of West Ham United and the Saudi Pro League.","Jadon Sancho will leave Chelsea when his loan spell ends on June 30.

Paris Saint-Germain - UEFA Champions League





Paris Saint-Germain winning the UEFA Champions League for the first time in its history puts an end to one of the longest searches for European glory. Established in 1970, the French side were yet to taste European success prior to the final at the Allianz Arena on Saturday. Luis Enrique and his men made easy work of Simone Inzaghi's Inter as they steamrolled the Italians 5-0 in the final. While PSG's victory tops off an exhilarating Champions League season, it wasn't just the Parisiens that put an end to their trophy drought.The 2024/25 season will be remembered as the year many teams across Europe put an end to their quest for silverware. With PSG being the latest addition to the list, teams like Tottenham Hotspur, Crystal Palace, Newcastle United and Bayern Munich's Harry Kane have all added trophies to their cabinets. Here's a closer look at how this year proved to be pivotal in the quest for silverware for several teams.Led by Ange Postecoglou from the dugout, Tottenham Hotspur were in the quest for a trophy to put an end to their excruciating 17-year search for silverware. Spurs, often mocked for their inability to claim trophies, further stacked the odds against their favour, when Postecoglou claimed that he 'usually wins trophies in his second season'.With an emphatic win over Premier League rivals Manchester United in the final, Spurs finally put an end to their search for a trophy. Brennan Johnson scored the winner in a narrow 1-0 win.The Eagles clinched a trophy for the first time in 120 years after a major upset in the FA Cup final. After losing twice in the final of the same competition, in 1990 and 2016, Palace beat Manchester City in the 2025 final 1-0 thanks to a goal from Eberechi Eze. The result meant that City went trophyless for the first time since 2016 and Palace claimed their first-ever FA Cup.Newcastle United claimed a major domestic trophy for the first time since 1955 as they beat Premier League champions Liverpool 2-1 in the final. Goals from Dan Burn and Alexander Isak ensured that the side managed by Eddie Howe put an end to the 70-year wait. The title triumph was Newcastle's first since the 1955 FA Cup win.In the same year Tottenham Hotspur won the UEFA Europa League, former club captain and current Bayern Munich striker Harry Kane also ended his search for a maiden career trophy. Despite joining the Bavarians last season, the Englishman ended his debut season in Germany without any trophy to show for it.However, after a dominant Bundesliga campaign in which he topped the goal scoring charts with 26 strikes, Bayern claimed back the German league title from Bayer Leverkusen, who ended Bayern's streak of 11 successive Bundesliga titles last season.Ever since the French side was taken over by the sovereign-wealth fund of Qatar in 2011, PSG has kept it a priority to get their hands on the UCL trophy. However, despite heavy spending and bringing in top talent from across Europe, the Parisiens kept falling short of the ultimate prize.Lionel Messi, Neymar Jr. and even Kylian Mbappe failed to bring European glory to the club. However, Luis Enrique's side, led by Ousmane Dembele in attack finally clinched the biggest club competition with a 5-0 win over Inter.","Paris Saint-Germain won the UEFA Champions League for the first time.

Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) fans recoiled in shock with a stunned silence after Barcelona pulled off a historic comeback in the second leg of their Champions League 2016/17 Round of 16 match. The Spanish giants became the first team in the European tournament's history to overturn a 4-0 deficit, defying odds of 200/1.""We lost everything in the closing minutes,"" said PSG manager Unai Emery. While Neymar delivered a performance for the ages, it was Barca manager Luis Enrique who maintained belief despite a scenario where the vast majority hardly gave the Spanish side a 1 percent chance of qualification. ""If they can score four goals, we can score six. Infinite things can happen,"" maintained Enrique, setting the stage for an extraordinary 6-1 comeback win.While Emery soon made his way out, the 'chokers tag' became ingrained in the club's identity. PSG never really managed to overcome the horrors of that night at Camp Nou, surrendering the momentum yet again in the 2018-19 edition of the Champions League. The French club pulled off a 2-0 win against Manchester United at Old Trafford in the first leg of their quarter-final.However, PSG again failed to get the job done in the second leg, losing 1-3 and crashing out. Even the presence of Neymar, who was signed from Barcelona for a record sum, as well as Kylian Mbappe, proved insufficient.While PSG's fortunes in the Champions League did improve over the years, reaching the tournament's final in the 2019-20 edition, inability to hold on under pressure stood out like a sore thumb. Mbappe and Neymar failed to convert chances as Bayern Munich pulled off a clinical win. While PSG owner Nasser Al-Khelaifi had made the club's desire to win the Champions League amply clear, fortune simply failed to swing in their favour despite the addition of Lionel Messi.PSG's tendency to commit harakiri remained constant in the 2021/22 edition, especially during their Round of 16 match against Real Madrid. The French club leaked three goals in 17 minutes, crashing out of the competition following a 2-3 loss on aggregate.As the managerial merry-go-round continued, Khelaifi took a drastic and controversial decision by appointing Enrique as the manager at the start of the 2023/24 season. The move was certainly unpopular among the PSG fans, considering the Spaniard's 'persona non grata' status after the pain he had subjected them to. Well, who can begrudge unwillingness to face your worst nightmare on a daily basis?Enrique stamped his philosophy from the first day itself, terming the situation at PSG ""chaotic"" and shocking. While managers had previously been quite cautious while dealing with Mbappe, the Spaniard openly highlighted his lack of desire to defend. ""A little bit more normalcy does no harm,” said Enrique.There was complete focus on work rate, with players dropped irrespective of their profile in case of any drop in standards. While players and agents earlier attempted to manipulate the manager through external pressure, none of that worked in this case, as Enrique strongly went about his philosophy. Young talents like Willian Pacho, Desire Doue, Bradley Barcola, and Vitinha made their way in as PSG shifted their focus from the biggest names to building a strong core.The Spaniard won over fans by giving Barcelona a taste of their own medicine in the 2023/24 quarter-finals. PSG overturned a 2-3 deficit by recording a comprehensive 4-1 win in the second leg, as the Parisians pulled off their own 'La Remontada'. However, there was more work in store for Enrique as he soon realised following a 2-0 loss on aggregate against Borussia Dortmund in the semi-finals. PSG hit the woodwork six times but failed to score a single goal.There was further an unexpected blow in store for Enrique as Mbappe forced a move to Real Madrid, depriving the Parisians of their top goal-scorer. While other managers would've been perturbed, the former Barcelona manager remained nonplussed. ""Our game does not consist in letting Mbappé do what he wants. That was the old philosophy which never won a major trophy. We are better in attack without him,"" he said.While such strong words could have made him a laughing stock, Enrique went about rebuilding with gusto, building a strong setup around attackers Ousmane Dembele, Goncalo Ramos and Doué. Dembele found his feet after being sidelined at Barcelona, scoring 33 goals in 45 matches this season.

Poll Should Inter Milan retain manager Simone Inzaghi after the Champions League final loss? Yes, he deserves more time No, it's time for a change





""We are meeting with the coach because this club is not used to letting a manager go into the final year of his contract. There is no revolution underway. We will meet to hear what he has to say, I repeat, on our part, we are very proud and honoured to continue with him,"" he said.Inter suffered a devastating loss at the hands of Paris Saint-Germain in the final of the UEFA Champions League on Saturday at the Allianz Arena in Munich. The Parisiens put five past the Italian giants in a heavily one-sided final, as the Nerazzurri looked helpless against a relentless PSG onslaught.Following the result, Italian media reported that Inzaghi could depart as early as this month, ahead of the Club World Cup in the United States, scheduled from June 14 to July 13. However, Inter Milan president Giuseppe Marotta has confirmed the club wants to retain the manager despite Saturday's result, with discussions set to begin this week. Inzaghi's contract with the club expires next year in June.PSG claimed their first-ever Champions League title with the largest winning margin ever seen in a final. On the other hand, Inzaghi's Inter fell in the final once again, with the score line far worse than the 1-0 loss to Pep Guardiola's Manchester City in Istanbul in 2023.""This defeat will not have an impact. Inzaghi has a contract for another year and we had already decided to meet with him this week,"" Marotta told reporters after the match in Munich. ""Almost all the credit for this positive cycle is due to his professionalism and abilities. If he wants to continue, we are happy.""Inter staged an inspirational run to the final of the Champions League, and were in the running for an iconic treble up until a little over a month ago. However, a late slip up in Serie A and loss to AC Milan in the semi-final of the Coppa Italia means that Inter will now end the season trophyless.""We are meeting with the coach because this club is not used to letting a manager go into the final year of his contract. There is no revolution underway. We will meet to hear what he has to say, I repeat, on our part, we are very proud and honoured to continue with him,"" he said.Looking to put the difficult result behind them, the president said, ""Let's quickly forget and look to the next one, with the new start of the Club World Cup. We will be representing Italy together with Juventus.""","Inter Milan president Giuseppe Marotta confirms the club wants to retain manager Simone Inzaghi.

IPL 2025 Winner Prediction: What Greenstone Lobo's Astrology says

Poll Should Inter Kashi continue their appeal at the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS)? Yes, they deserve another hearing. No, the decision should stand.





The I-League title race has taken another turn after the AIFF appeals committee adjudged that Inter Kashi fielded an ineligible player for multiple games in the second leg of the competition.The appeals committee heard an appeal from Churchill Brothers, Namdhari FC and Real Kashmir, and ruled that the re-registration of Mario Barco by Inter Kashi made him an ineligible player. “The rules do not provide for re-registration for anyone who has been ousted from the season due to a season ending injury/illness,” chairperson of appeals committee Rajesh Tandon said in the order on Saturday.The appeals committee had earlier rejected Kashi’s plea against Namdhari fielding an ineligible player to announce Churchill as champions. Kashi have challenged the decision at the Lausanne-based Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) where the matter is expected to be decided later this month.In the provisional standings, Churchill had 40 points, a point more than Kashi, while Real Kashmir were third with 37 points. The appeals committee order means Kashi’s games where Mario was fielded would result in forfeiture. Churchill will now get two additional points, taking their points tally to an unassailable 42, regardless of the pending appeal before CAS.“Churchill Brothers, with 42 points, are the undisputed champions,” Churchill said on Tuesday. “After this order, Churchill’s championship win has been affirmed. The I-League trophy will continue to be in Goa. Churchill Brothers are grateful to the judicial bodies as they have rightfully upheld our legitimate claims.”Kashi said they would appeal against the judgement at CAS, just like they have done with the previous order where three points allotted to them by the disciplinary committee were returned to Namdhari by the appeals committee.“While it is unfortunate that Inter Kashi has to approach CAS yet again for a truly free and fair hearing of the matter, it seems to be the new reality of Indian football. The club is flabbergasted that such simple rules and regulations can be twisted and misinterpreted in such a manner through which the club is now suffering without any fault of its own,” Kashi said in a statement.Records suggest that Mario was part of Kashi’s initial squad – which included six foreigners -- for the I-League but was later replaced by Matija Babovic due to what was seen as a season-ending injury. The Spanish striker, however, continued to remain contracted with the club and made a return to the team on Feb 26, 2025 since Julen Perez’s contract termination during the January transfer window left a vacant foreign spot.According to the order, the federation’s competitions department disallowed Kashi from re-registering Mario on Feb 2, insisting that the request did not comply with clause 6.5.7 of the I-League regulations which states that a foreign player can only be replaced by another foreign player in case an injury or illness prevents the player from continuing to play for the rest of the competition or after mutual termination of the contract.Kashi appealed the decision with the AIFF League Committee which said on Feb 15 that a majority of its members were in favour of approving the club's request to add back player Mario Barco.Kashi fielded Mario for their games starting Feb 26 against Rajasthan United.In its order, the appeals committee said there is no power of review available with the League Committee in I-League regulations. “A power not available in a statute cannot be exercised by a body which itself is a creature of the statute,” the order noted.“The unlawful inclusion of a foreign player provided Inter Kashi with an unfair advantage over other clubs adhering to the prescribed regulations,” stated the order. “Such a violation directly undermines the principles of fair play and the integrity of the I-League. Furthermore, not penalising such a violation would encourage resource-wealthy clubs to buy and rotate more foreign players in their squads. This would directly undermine the principles of equity and equal opportunities which has made the I-League one of the most renowned football leagues of this country till now. ”",Churchill Brothers will be allotted two additional points after Inter Kashi fielded ‘ineligible’ Mario Barco in their draw against the former champions at Raia Panaji.

Paris Saint-Germain secured their first UEFA Champions League title with a record-breaking 5-0 victory over Inter Milan in the final in Munich. The historic win featured a brace from Desire Doue along with goals from Achraf Hakimi, Khvicha Kvaratskhelia, and Senny Mayulu, marking the largest margin of victory in Champions League final history.The dominant performance by PSG surpassed previous records, with their five-goal victory exceeding the four-goal margins achieved by AC Milan, Bayern Munich, and Real Madrid in past finals.The triumph represented a successful shift in PSG's organisational approach, moving away from their previous strategy of acquiring established stars to focusing on developing talent from within.PSG's five goals placed them among an elite group of clubs to reach that scoring threshold in a Champions League final. Only Real Madrid's 7-3 win over Eintracht Frankfurt in 1959/60 and Benfica's 5-3 victory against Real Madrid in 1961/62 had previously seen a team score five or more goals in the final.In the historical context of Champions League finals, only ten matches have seen a team score four or more goals. Real Madrid achieved this feat multiple times, including their 4-1 victories over Juventus in 2016/17 and Atletico Madrid in 2013/14.AC Milan hold a notable presence in the record books with three instances of scoring four goals in finals. These include their 4-0 wins against Barcelona in 1993/94 and Steaua Bucuresti in 1988/89, plus a 4-1 victory over Ajax in 1968/69.The previous record for the largest margin of victory in a Champions League final was shared by multiple teams.

Pascal Wehrlein on winning in Shanghai

TAG Heuer Porsche gained big in Shanghai





TAG Heuer Porsche driver Pascal Wehrlein gained no points on Day 1 of the Shanghai E-Prix last weekend. However, the Formula E driver was able to turn the tables in a rainy race the next day and claim second place on the podium. After the race, he confirmed that the result made him realise they were actually competitive on a wet track.Pascal Wehrlein secured second place in the Round 11 race in Shanghai, with his teammate Antonio Felix Da Costa joining him on the podium in third. The two had started in the same positions on the grid but in reverse order. It was, nevertheless, a double gain for Porsche on Sunday.Talking about the Round 11 race, Wehrlein said, “Very tricky conditions especially in the beginning, I think it got a little bit better towards the end, but our pace was good. Not good enough for P1, but quite far ahead of the guys behind. Personally I’m very happy about the result today because today was the first time that I felt like we were very competitive in the wet, which wasn’t the case in Tokyo and Monaco. I think we’ve found a good way there and in the end a happy ending for us. ”The two also scored double podiums at the Mexico E-Prix and then again in Miami, where Wehrlein won. He earned another podium at the Tokyo E-Prix.With such a strong performance this year, Wehrlein currently holds second place in the Formula E Driver Standings with 103 points.“It was a very strong result today in very tricky and challenging wet conditions,” Porsche Formula E boss Florian Modlinger stated after the double podium in Round 11. The 34 points earned from the results, plus the fastest lap by Wehrlein, also promoted Porsche to the top of the Teams’ World Championship—by a single point ahead of Nissan.“We are really happy with these points and regaining the lead in the Teams’ Championship by a single point. It will be a very hard fight to the end of the year. Overall – with three Porsche in the top six with Nico Mueller – we can be very happy,” Modlinger added.Also Read: Nick Cassidy on winning Round 11 race at Shanghai E-Prix: “It feels like we’ve been waiting a long time” Wehrlein and Da Costa will now be eyeing more such wins, with five more races remaining before the Formula E season wraps up for the year.

Dan Ticktum responds to George Russell’s remark





Cupra Kiro driver Dan Ticktum has reacted to Formula 1 driver George Russell’s “one British driver in Formula E” mention when the latter was asked if he had ever seen a driver who did what F1 champion Max Verstappen did, that is, deliberately hitting another during a race. Ticktum responded to Russell’s remark by thanking him for “free publicity” and likening himself to none other than Verstappen, who is currently the reigning number 1 champion in Formula 1.Red Bull driver Max Verstappen was handed a 10-second penalty during the race and a three-point penalty on his licence for hitting George Russell’s Mercedes during the Spanish Grand Prix. One more mistake and he can face a one-race ban. When Russell was asked if he had seen any other driver do such a thing, he told the media, ""Not in Formula 1. Maybe in Formula E. Maybe one British driver in Formula E.”Dan Ticktum took note of Russell’s mention. Ticktum had received a two-year ban for deliberately hitting another driver during an MSA Formula (now British F4) race. He recently clinched his first podium of the season at the Tokyo E-Prix.Taking to Instagram to share a recorded response to Russell’s remark, Ticktum said, ""I have just had a very nice evening with the team and some of the guys from Porsche here in Shanghai.I’m just on the way back to the hotel. It has come to my attention via the Twittersphere that a certain driver in Formula 1 - not to name names but his name is George Russell - has made some rather choice comments about a certain Formula E driver. ”Thanking Russell for the mention, he further said, ""He hasn't named my name, but it's quite obviously pointed at me. We'd like to address those comments that he made I believe on the team radio. Number one, thank you for the free publicity. We'll take that any day of the week. And two, while what Max did today was a little bit sceptical, to be likened to him at any point in my career is a positive if you ask me.

He was “all smiles after Race 1” and shared proof of his happy pictures with the trophy on Instagram.Talking to Formula E about the race, Taylor Barnard said, “Honestly, my main emotion is that I’m a bit confused! I was sitting at the back for a very long time; I was quite good on energy but I didn’t understand how the race was playing out. The team did a great job with the strategy because I came out of the pit lane in sixth so I thought, ‘now I can fight!’, but I need to look at the race after to understand a little bit better what’s actually happened. I was really struggling with energy on the last couple of laps so I did my best in the last few corners. I’m super happy to get another podium, another 15 points in the bag.”On Sunday, Barnard finished tenth in the second race of the Shanghai double-header but was glad he finished it safely as he raced on a wet track in the rain.

Starting second and finishing third is not ideal – in the beginning I thought we had something, but then it was clear to me that I didn’t have the pace of the two cars in front, so it was all about bringing the podium home.”Antonio now stands third in the 2025 Formula E Driver Standings with 88 points.Taking to Instagram after the race, Antonio Felix Da Costa shared a picture of himself spraying champagne from the podium.

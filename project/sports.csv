Is India bothered about Test debacle?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/is-india-bothered-about-test-debacle/articleshow/125628309.cms,"Sai Sudharsan plays a shot during the fifth day of the second Test in Guwahati. (Image: PTI Photo/Shahbaz Khan)

The team’s hard-earned legacy in the five-day game is eroding fast, especially at home. But with all the focus being on chasing White-Ball glory, right from a cricketer’s junior years, an effective turnaround may require more effort than the stakeholders may be willing to make.

Coach Gautam Gambhir, chief selector Ajit Agarkar need to get their act right

Juniors disinterested?

No quality red-ball players?

GUWAHATI: It was right after Day Four of the second Test against South Africa in Guwahati. India were staring at one of their most humiliating series defeats in recent times, but the focus of the stakeholders of Indian cricket was on something else. A gala was being staged in Mumbai. The schedule of the T20 World Cup was being announced. India’s former all-format captain Rohit Sharma was there, as was current T20I leader Suryakumar Yadav, along with Indian cricket board (BCCCI) mandarins. There wasn’t a single discussion pertaining to the impending red-ball disaster. The stage was being prepared for the next six months of a T20 fest which was going to rule the heads and hearts of Indian cricket fans.India, after their 408-run loss — biggest in terms of runs in their 94-year Test history — have already hit the white-ball button. Coach Gautam Gambhir is with his entourage in Ranchi, so are ‘RoKo’ and the rest of the bandwagon for the ODI series that starts on Sunday.Everyone is hoping that the abject surrender in Guwahati — India’s fifth defeat in seven Test matches at home over the last 13 months — will be a mere speck on the horizon if the white-ball teams succeed.It’s Gambhir’s professional compulsion and he can’t be entirely faulted. “If we have to do well in Test cricket, then we’ll have to prioritize the format. It cannot happen that a week before a Test series against South Africa at home, we are playing a white-ball series in Australia,” Gambhir said after the team’s loss here.While that’s one part of the story, the performance of the Indian team in the South Africa series suggests that the current lot aren’t best equipped to play Test cricket at home. The fact that Simon Harmer, a 36-year-old journeyman off-spinner, claimed 17 wickets in the two Tests underlines India’s frailties in a sector where they were masters of the craft even a few years ago — playing spin.Ravichandran Ashwin, former Indian offie with 537 Test wickets, made a very pertinent point. “The problem of playing spin started a few years ago when the control of the pitches for Ranji Trophy games were taken away from local curators. The focus was on preparing good pitches with pace and bounce and neutral curators were appointed across the country. It allowed many of our new-age players to get better against fast bowling, but they lost their grasp over spin,” Ashwin said.India’s recent overseas record is a perfect indicator of Ashwin’s point. Against Australia Down Under, India lost 1-3, but they were very much in the game till the last session of the fifth Test. In England, the same team that got crushed against South Africa at home played out a creditable 2-2 draw, with the Indian top-order batters getting a bucketload of runs.Over the last four years, the Indian U-19 team has played only three four-day series — two against Australia and one against England. People who want to see India do well in Test cricket are not at all happy with this.The entire focus of the U-19 cycle is on white-ball cricket, with the U-19 50-over World Cup being the focus. It means the Cooch Behar Trophy — the national U-19 red-ball tournament — has lost its importance and sheen.Gambhir has been criticized for choosing bits and pieces allrounders ahead of specialists in the team, but sources in the know say that even selectors at the junior level are fixated about choosing such players.“The junior selectors are rated by what the Indian team does in the U-19 World Cup. So their focus is on trying to find cricketers who can do a bit of both. So right at the grass roots, the players’ technique and temperament are moulded by the requirements of white-ball cricket, because they know a good U-19 World Cup can give them a good IPL contract,” a former selector said, adding that if Chetesh war Pujara was playing U-19s, he would have played only four games a year.Former India wicketkeeper Deep Dasgupta, who does a lot of coaching, feels if India are to become a force again in Tests, they must identify red ball talent and insulate them from white-ball cricket.“It’s basic technique. To be successful in the white-ball, it is important that the bat comes down from the gully region so that it opens up scoring options. In red ball, it is important that the bat comes down straight, because defending is as big a part of the game as attacking.“If we have to produce good players in red-ball cricket, young players with good technique should get financial incentive, be allowed to learn the ropes and stay away from the lure of T20s,” Dasgupta added.Does India have enough good players for international red-ball cricket? With the likes of Sai Sudharsan and Nitish Reddy failing woefully and Shreyas Iyer opting out of red ball cricket, there are many holes to fill. It appears that the likes of Karun Nair and Abhimanyu Eashwaran, too, are unlikely to be considered.Though the next Test assignment is eight months away, one understands that the selectors may look at someone like Ruturaj Gaikwad, whose technique has impressed those who run the game in the country. Even though Ruturaj is a big hit in the IPL as CSK captain, he also has a healthy first-class average of 45.59 and is known to be one of the better players of spin bowling.With Sarfaraz Khan falling off the radar and unlikely to regain the trust of the team management, Rinku Singh is another player whose Ranji Trophy performances should be taken note of. The KKR left hander, a terrific player of spin who turns out for Uttar Pradesh in the Ranji Trophy, has a first-class batting average of 59.3. He bats at No. 5 and his 176 against Tamil Nadu in Coimbatore a few days ago in UP’s winning first-innings chase of 455 was a throwback to the old-school grind.Another player who has caught everybody’s attention of late is Smaran Ravichandran, a left-hand batter from Karnataka. “He has a first class average of 78.3 but the selectors need to see him more in the India ‘A’ set-up. He has played 13 games and the selectors need to see how good he is against the short-ball,” a source said. Among bowlers, young Punjab off spinner Anmoljeet Singh is an interesting prospect if groomed well. Those in the know say that the 18-year-old has the qualities of becoming a good off-spinner even at the senior level, but he needs to be handled carefully.Dasgupta says that it is important that the BCCI starts organizing more camps like they used to earlier. “Why not have camps that we used to have before a red-ball series? Former greats, too, can be called for such camps,” Dasgupta said.The next Test series is eight months away and it remains to be seen how BCCI reacts to the recent debacle and whether it takes corrective measures.","India's hard-earned legacy in the five-day game is eroding fast, especially at home.

Gautam Gambhir fiery press conference: On whitewash, Rishabh Pant shot, pitch and more

Poll Do you agree with Ashwin's criticism of Rishabh Pant's shot selection? Strongly Agree Agree Disagree

NEW DELHI: Former India spinner Ravichandran Ashwin has offered a sharp critique of Rishabh Pant’s batting approach following India’s crushing 408-run defeat to South Africa in the second Test, a loss that sealed a 0–2 home whitewash and marked one of the national team’s lowest moments in recent years.Speaking on his YouTube show Ash ki Baat, Ashwin praised Pant’s natural ability but said his reckless shot selection continues to let the team down at crucial moments.“My heartbeat used to go fast in the dressing room when Rishabh Pant batted. He has a superb game and defence, so I always wonder why he would get out to shots like these,” Ashwin said. “I will still say he is a very good player, and the day he takes responsibility, things can start changing. I don’t deny the X-factor he brings.”Ashwin compared Pant’s approach to former New Zealand batter Nathan Astle’s iconic double-hundred in Christchurch — an innings he said cannot be used to justify ultra-attacking play in every match. “Astle once smashed 200-odd runs, but he didn’t play the same way in every Test. Similarly, batters cannot play the same way every time. I have said it in the dressing room, but it cannot change until he realises it.”Pant, who captained in the absence of an injured Shubman Gill, endured a disappointing series with just 49 runs across four innings. Ashwin warned that leadership magnifies responsibility: “If you are a captain today, 10 others will follow in your footsteps. Responsibility is a must.”Ashwin also expressed deep disappointment with India’s overall performance, saying the defeat did not hurt as much as the lack of fight shown by the team. He felt the Guwahati pitch was “of Test quality” and said India should at least have taken the match into the final session.“I wasn’t sad about losing the Test, but there was no fight,” he said. “In the dressing room, everyone should raise their hands individually and take accountability.”He added that the current Test side remains “way behind in terms of experience” and will take time to evolve.",Former India spinner Ravichandran Ashwin criticises Rishabh Pant's shot selection.

NEW DELHI: Weeks after she was named player of the tournament in the Women’s World Cup, Deepti Sharma became the most expensive player in the Women’s Premier League 2025 mega auction when she was brought back by UP Warriorz for Rs 3.2 crore on Thursday.New Zealand allrounder Amelia Kerr went to Mumbai Indians for Rs 3 crore. There was comparatively more interest in Indian players, with pacer Shikha Pandey being bought by Warriorz for Rs 2.4 crore, and Shree Charani and Asha Sobhana breaching the Rs 1 crore mark.Smriti Mandhana, retained by RCB before the auction, holds the record for the highest price tag with a contract worth Rs 3.5 crore.

The biggest surprise of the day was Australia captain Alyssa Healy going unsold.Deepti Sharma, who was first bought by Warriorz in the inaugural auction in 2023 for Rs 2.6 crore, was released by the franchise ahead of the auction. Interestingly, she drew only one bid from Delhi Capitals at her base price of Rs 50 lakh.When Warriorz decided to exercise their right-to-match option, they set a price tag of Rs 3.2 crore for Capitals to pay. As Capitals refused to burn their purse, Deepti became the most expensive player of the day.New Zealand allrounder Amelia Kerr fell short of matching Deepti as she was also brought back by her franchise Mumbai Indians for Rs 3 crore.

Interestingly, with new head coach Abhishek Nayar coming on board, the franchise went into the auction with the highest purse of Rs 14.5 crore. They had retained just one uncapped player in Shweta Sehra wat for Rs 50 lakh.Capitals co-owner Parth Jindal said the Indian cricket board (BCCI) is thinking of adding a couple of teams to WPL. “There is definitely more interest in this WPL auction.

So I think its looking like a very good balanced team with Henry also coming in, as she can bowl with the new ball. One of the things we felt we lacked last season or in the last cycle was some explosiveness at the bottom order and she brings that. So with Sutherland, Kapp, Henry and then with Charani, Sneh and then you have Shafali, and Nikki - all who can come in with the ball. We'll have more than six bowling options and we have a very deep batting order. So it's looking good and we've reached three finals. It's time we go one step further and we have to - it's about time,"" elaborated Jindal.Jindal expressed his views on the WPL's growth since its establishment in 2023 and highlighted how the ODI World Cup victory has generated increased fan interest for the upcoming season.""Three years ago, all the owners took a leap of faith into the women's game, and we're so thrilled that we did that and for us when the bidding happened, we were very clear that this is a sport that is only going to go from strength to strength, and to see 446 million Indians watch the World Cup final - more people watched it than they watched the men's T20 World Cup final live, it shows how far the game has come.""""I wrote it in one of my tweets as well that the World Cup win in 2025 is the 1983 moment for women's cricket, and I think this season the interest in the WPL is going to be like it's never been before. The number of people who even came up to me and asked me in my office or whenever I go out, say that 'Hey, November 27 is the women's auction. Who you guys going to get, and are you retaining Lanning? Why didn't you retain Lanning? So many questions, which in the last three years never happened. So it just shows the kind of interest.""Jindal concluded by discussing his hopes for expanding the WPL with a new team and implementing a home-and-away format.""Yes, I think we would love to see the WPL in home and away format as well. This caravan format is okay, but it's not ideal and I hope that and I'm sure that the BCCI is working on it. I think the amount of time that they get is very short and that's why in order to fit the WPL within this window - this is the best and most ideal format. But I hope we get a bigger longer window for the WPL as well going forward. I think it is imminent that either one or two new teams will come in at some point and that's why I think this cycle is such a short cycle with only two WPLs over 14 months. So I'm pretty sure that the BCCI is planning on adding a team, and maybe with that addition, we move home in a way that would be ideal for the fans, for the game and for the growth of the WPL.""Jemimah Rodrigues, Shafali Verma, Annabel Sutherland, Marzianne Kapp, Niki Prasad, Laura Wolvaardt, Chinelle Henry, Shree Charani, Sneh Rana, Lizelle Lee, Deeya Yadav, Taniyaa Bhatia, Mamatha Madiwala, Nandni Sharma, Lucy Hamilton, Minnu Mani","Delhi Capitals co-owner Parth Jindal has confirmed the franchise's intention to appoint an Indian captain for the upcoming Women's Premier League season.

WPL Auction: Delhi Capitals co-owner Parth Jindal on women's cricket after India's World Cup win

The Women’s Premier League (WPL) auction in New Delhi on Thursday opened up with a crackle and quickly turned into a blaze as Asha Sobhana became the first Malayali cricketer to breach the Rs 1-crore mark. In a pulsating, seesawing bidding war, the UP Warriorz snapped up the 34-year-old leg-spinner from Thiruvananthapuram for a staggering Rs 1.1 crore, capping one of the most dramatic tussles of the evening.The action began innocuously, after the Delhi Capitals kicked things off at the base price of Rs 30 lakh. But the tempo surged swiftly as Delhi and UP Warriorz traded bids up to Rs 55 lakh.Delhi bowed out, only for the Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) — Asha’s former home franchise — to storm in at Rs 60 lakh, determined to reclaim the leggie who had helped power through their title charge in the 2024 season.But the Warriorz refused to blink. The bids climbed into uncharted territory, and when the hammer finally came down at Rs 1.1 crore, UP Warriorz had clinched one of the most compelling stories from Kerala at the auction.For Asha, the moment was surreal.“I was watching the auction at my home in Thiruvananthapuram, glued to the television,” she tells TOI. “I got nervous during the bidding war...very happy with the result.”The milestone is a natural culmination for the player built on persistence and doggedness.RCB had first signed Asha in the inaugural 2023 WPL season for just Rs 10 lakh — a modest sum for the bowler who went on to claim 12 wickets and finish joint second-highest wicket-taker. Her unforgettable five-wicket haul against the UP Warriorz remains one of the defining spells of that year. Incidentally, she is the only Indian to claim a five-for in the WPL.“It was against the Warriorz two seasons back that I bagged my first five-for in WPL, and now to play for them is incredible. Too many things happening at the moment,” she chuckles.The RCB contract came to her at the right time as she was toying with the idea of quitting the game because of the lack of recognition after toiling away in domestic cricket for over a decade.A die-hard fan of former Australian legspinner Stuart MacGill, Asha's WPL heroics earned her a long-awaited India call-up in April last year for the Bangladesh tour, followed by her T20I debut in May.In October, she ticked off another dream, when she made her ICC T20 World Cup debut in Dubai, and started in India’s opener against New Zealand.But the journey has hardly been linear. A knee injury forced her out of the last WPL season and sidelined her for nearly a year.Far from dimming her spark, the layoff seemed only to sharpen her resolve. On her return to domestic cricket for Kerala, she struck immediately, delivering a Player-of-the-Match performance in the Senior Women’s T20 Trophy game against Vidarbha last month.Her career has been as itinerant as it has been inspirational: stints with the Railways, Kerala, Pondicherry, and then back to Kerala, all while juggling her employment with the South Central Railways in Hyderabad.With the WPL beginning in January next year, Asha stands on the cusp of a luminous chapter — proof that perseverance, patience, and craft can script a heartwarming tale in Kerala cricket.",Asha Sobhana becomes first Malayali cricketer to breach the Rs 1-crore mark.

Poll What do you think is the most important aspect of Pelé's legacy? His records and achievements His cultural symbol for Brazil His influence off the pitch

The legacy of Brazilian football icon Pelé has taken a significant step toward renewed global visibility following the acquisition of his brand by NR Sports, the company owned by Neymar Santos Sr. The announcement was made on Tuesday at the Pelé Museum in Santos, the coastal city where the legendary forward built much of his career and global reputation.Neymar Sr. described the agreement as a milestone for both his company and Brazilian sport, emphasizing the cultural power attached to Pelé’s image.“It’s a very strong brand. We want to enhance its identity and bring it into the present,” he said. While the financial terms remain confidential under agreements with former rights-holder Sport 10, Brazilian media reports estimated the value around $18 million.Pelé—born Edson Arantes do Nascimento—remains one of football’s most celebrated figures in the sport, renowned for leading Brazil to World Cup triumphs in 1958, 1962, and 1970. He holds several records to date, with some of the most notable being the youngest to score in a FIFA World Cup final, and also the youngest to score a hat-trick in the competition.His influence extends far beyond the pitch, symbolising Brazilian creativity and excellence in global sport.Though he died in December 2022, his daughter Flavia attended the ceremony marking the transition.“There are no words to describe the emotion of bringing back a brand that embodies soul, humanity, and love,” she said, calling the moment both honouring and deeply personal.NR Sports characterised the acquisition as a “repatriation” of one of sport’s most important symbols, framing it as essential to preserving and expanding Pelé’s legacy for future generations.",Neymar Jr's family business has purchased Pele's brand rights.

Cristiano Ronaldo and Georgina Rodríguez have set the stage for what is expected to be one of the most high-profile weddings in recent years, with the couple reportedly choosing a venue that carries deep personal meaning for the Portugal captain. Instead of the grand international locations often associated with celebrity weddings, Ronaldo has opted to return to his roots in Madeira, selecting a site that reflects both history and identity.Portuguese outlets report that the ceremony is planned at Funchal Cathedral, widely recognised as the island’s oldest and most significant religious building. The structure, inaugurated in 1514 and built with local cedar wood, stands as a landmark of Madeira’s cultural heritage. It also sits just a short distance from the hospital where Ronaldo was born, adding a layer of symbolism to the decision.The connection between Ronaldo and his birthplace has remained evident throughout his career. Madeira’s international airport carries his name, and his museum — dedicated to his achievements — is located on the island. His early football steps with Nacional da Madeira unfolded not far from the cathedral selected for the ceremony.As per outlets in the country, the gathering is likely to be intimate in nature, though it will bring together guests linked to Ronaldo’s life in Portugal, Spain, Italy, Saudi Arabia and across the football world. Further details remain unconfirmed.It is also stated in a Jornal da Madeira report that Ronaldo and his fiancée will tie the knot in a Christian ceremony in the summer of 2026.Ronaldo and Georgina Rodríguez began their relationship in 2016 after meeting in Madrid, where she worked at a Gucci store during his time at Real Madrid. Over nine years, the couple have navigated different countries and stages of his career. They share two daughters, Alana and Bella, while raising Cristiano Jr, Mateo and Eva María together.As Ronaldo prepares for a demanding period with club and country — including a busy summer of international fixtures — Georgina continues to build her presence as an entrepreneur and media figure.For Madeira, the wedding marks another moment tied to one of its biggest icons. For Ronaldo, it reflects a return to the island that shaped his earliest years, setting the backdrop for a personal milestone that extends beyond football.","Cristiano Ronaldo and Georgina Rodríguez have reportedly chosen the venue for their wedding.

With 1/10th The Population Of Noida, Curacao Qualifies For FIFA World Cup

Here are the confirmed pots:

Pot 1: Canada, Mexico, United States, Spain, Argentina, France, England, Brazil, Portugal, Netherlands, Belgium, Germany

Pot 2: Croatia, Morocco, Colombia, Uruguay, Switzerland, Japan, Senegal, Iran, South Korea, Ecuador, Austria, Australia

Pot 4: Jordan, Cape Verde, Ghana, Curaçao, Haiti, New Zealand, European playoff winners A–D, Inter-confederation playoff winners 1–2

FIFA has unveiled the seeding pots and draw procedures for the 2026 World Cup — the first-ever 48-team edition — confirming a major structural change that will keep the world’s top four teams apart until the semi-finals. The announcement, made on Tuesday, sets the stage for a historic draw scheduled for December 5 in Washington DC.Under the new system, the four highest-ranked teams — Spain (No. 1), Argentina (No. 2), France (No. 3), and England (No. 4) — will be placed in two different halves of the knockout bracket, ensuring they cannot face each other before the last four if all win their groups. The move aims to maintain competitive balance and increase the chances of heavyweight clashes deep into the tournament.All four top-ranked teams have been placed in Pot 1, alongside co-hosts Canada, Mexico, and the United States, and other global giants including Brazil, Portugal, Netherlands, Belgium, and Germany, who narrowly held on to a seeded spot.FIFA confirmed that the draw will start with the 12 teams in Pot 1 before proceeding sequentially through Pots 2, 3, and 4.The expanded format means the tournament will feature 12 groups of four, with the top two from each group — plus the eight best third-placed teams — progressing to a new 32-team knockout stage.Six places remain unfilled, with 18 teams still battling in the March play-offs. Among them is four-time world champion Italy, currently in the playoffs and facing the possibility of landing in Pot 4 despite being ranked 12th in the world.The expanded draw also features several debutant nations. Uzbekistan headline Pot 3, while Jordan, Cape Verde, and Curaçao sit in Pot 4 along with potential playoff winners.With the biggest World Cup in history just over a year away, the December 5 draw promises the first real glimpse of football’s new global era.","FIFA has unveiled the seeding pots and draw procedures for the 2026 World Cup.

A night marked by wholesale rotations, defensive mistakes and a moment of teenage brilliance saw both Manchester City and Barcelona fall to damaging Champions League defeats on Tuesday. While 18-year-old Estevão lit up Stamford Bridge with a stunning solo effort, lapses at the back hurt both European heavyweights.Pep Guardiola’s 100th Champions League match in charge of City turned sour as Bayer Leverkusen punished a heavily changed side with a 2-0 win. Guardiola rested almost his entire starting XI from the weekend loss to Newcastle, including Erling Haaland, but the reshuffle backfired. Alejandro Grimaldo put Leverkusen ahead in the 23rd minute with a precise low finish, before Patrik Schick doubled the lead with a well-placed header in the 54th.“It feels wonderful and we gave everything till the last second,” Schick told DAZN.Barcelona’s night was even more chaotic. Chelsea cruised to a 3-0 victory at Stamford Bridge, helped by Jules Koundé steering the ball into his own net after a defensive mix-up in the 27th minute. Things worsened when Ronald Araújo collected a second yellow just before half-time for a reckless challenge on Marc Cucurella.Chelsea took full advantage. Estevão shrugged off two defenders to score a superb solo goal in the 55th, and Liam Delap added a third from close range in the 73rd.Barcelona have now lost four of their last 10 matches across competitions, leaving coach Hansi Flick under mounting scrutiny.The results left the top end of the table unchanged. A City win would have pushed them higher, but Wednesday’s fixtures featuring Bayern Munich, Arsenal and Inter Milan will now shape the standings. Borussia Dortmund climbed to fourth, Chelsea moved into fifth, and both clubs sit level with City on 10 points. Barcelona slid to 15th, while Juventus rose to 21 points as their revival continued.There was better news for José Mourinho, who finally secured his first Champions League victory with Benfica. Samuel Dahl smashed in a sixth-minute volley and Leandro Barreiro sealed a 2-0 win at Ajax, who remain winless after five games and have managed just one victory in their last 10 overall.Elsewhere, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang struck twice in four minutes to lead Marseille to a 2-1 comeback win over Newcastle. Dortmund snapped a three-game winless stretch with a commanding 4-0 victory over 10-man Villarreal, powered by a brace from Serhou Guirassy.Juventus edged Bodo/Glimt 3-2 in the Arctic Circle, needing a stoppage-time finish from Jonathan David after the hosts equalised late. Substitute Kenan Yildiz was involved in all three goals.Union Saint-Gilloise edged Galatasaray 1-0 through Promise David, with the Turkish side missing injured top scorer Victor Osimhen and ending the match with 10 men after youngster Arda Ünyay was dismissed.Scott McTominay continued his scoring run by netting the opener in Napoli’s 2-0 win over Qarabag. Qarabag’s Kevin Medina was briefly knocked unconscious after being struck by another McTominay effort but was later replaced. Napoli supporters also marked the fifth anniversary of Diego Maradona’s passing.Finally, Athletic Bilbao’s goalless draw with Slavia Prague kept both teams outside the qualification spots with five matches played.","Pep Guardiola's 100th Champions League match in charge of City turned sour as Bayer Leverkusen punished a heavily changed side with a 2-0 win.

CHENNAI: Indian football is at an all-time low. The top-tier leagues are yet to kick off for the season, and the players have no option but to plead to the national federation, at a time when they must be putting on a show on the pitch.In a period when much ink has been spilt on the country’s football ecosystem, Republic of Ireland head coach Heimir Hallgrimsson stressed that a structure must be built to reap rewards in the future. Hallgrimsson, who recently guided Ireland to the World Cup playoffs, has a fair idea of Indian football, considering his association with Sports For Life (SFL), a platform for grassroots sports development.“Football is not a new sport in India, but there is not much experience that one can tap into. Obviously, a football culture is not there. So, people in charge may not have been in the game or played the game at an elite level. We, as coaches, can only teach what we know. That is a weakness which needs to be assessed,” Hallgrimsson, the global ambassador and football mentor for the SFL, told TOI during a virtual interaction.While there is a feeling of doom and gloom in Indian football, Hallgrimsson remarked that it is not impossible for the country to create a superstar if a structure is put in place.“In India, football is growing really fast, like everywhere else in the world. If it (work) is done properly, the next big one can come from India. If there is a good structure, it is kind of unlikely that there will be no big football players from India. I do not know when, but it will happen at some point of time. If we start early, we may have a big name in the game in 10 to 12 years,” added Hallgrimsson, a former Iceland and Jamaica coach.Talking about his work at the SFL, Hallgrimsson said: “I like the project. I have a really broad spectrum of coaching; I have done a lot of seminars for coaches in Iceland. So, I am trying to help the SFL and ensure that they do not take the wrong step like many have done.”",Heimir Hallgrimsson says Indian football needs a structure to reap rewards in the future.

Lee Bowyer vs Kieron Dyer (Newcastle, 2005)

Ricardo Fuller vs Andy Griffin (Stoke City, 2008)

Everton midfielder Idrissa Gueye entered an unwanted chapter of Premier League history on Monday, becoming part of only the third incident in which a player has been sent off for an offence against his own teammate — with four players now shown red cards across these rare flashpoints. The bizarre moment unfolded during Everton’s 1–0 win over Manchester United at Old Trafford, overshadowing the result and sparking widespread debate across football circles.The flashpoint came in the 13th minute with the score at 0–0. Moments after Gueye lost possession inside his own box — leading to a Bruno Fernandes effort — the midfielder and defender Michael Keane got into a heated argument. As the two confronted each other face-to-face, Keane appeared to shove Gueye, prompting the Senegal international to retaliate with a left-handed slap to his teammate’s face.Referee Tony Harrington immediately issued a straight red card, a decision later confirmed by VAR, which deemed the action a “clear strike to the face.” Everton goalkeeper Jordan Pickford and teammate Iliman Ndiaye quickly stepped in to separate the players.Gueye’s dismissal puts him in rare company — only two other incidents in Premier League history have seen players sent off for striking their own teammate.In one of the Premier League’s most infamous meltdowns, Bowyer and Dyer fought each other during Newcastle’s 3–0 defeat to Aston Villa. Both players were sent off, with Dyer handed a three-match ban and Bowyer suspended for seven games.With Stoke leading West Ham 1–0, Fuller slapped captain Andy Griffin after blaming him for an equaliser. He was immediately dismissed, and the incident derailed Stoke’s momentum as West Ham went on to score a late winner.Gueye’s red card, though unprecedented in Everton’s modern history, now joins those notorious moments.",Everton midfielder Idrissa Gueye was sent off against Manchester United.

Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall's 29th-minute goal proved decisive, as the 10-man Everton team successfully defended their lead despite United's dominant second-half performance.The match took an unexpected turn in the 13th minute when Gueye, frustrated with Keane's apparent failure to receive his pass inside the Everton penalty box, confronted his teammate. After Bruno Fernandes missed a shot, Keane shoved Gueye, who responded by slapping Keane's face, resulting in referee Tony Harrington showing a red card for violent conduct.""The referee's call of red card to Gueye for violent conduct was checked and confirmed by VAR — with the action deemed to be a clear strike to the face of Keane,"" the league announced on social media.Gueye became the first Premier League player to be sent off for fighting with a teammate since Stoke City's Ricardo Fuller clashed with Andy Griffin in 2008.""I think it was just a moment of madness,"" Dewsbury-Hall said. ""It was avoidable but Idrissa has apologized to us all at full-time and said his piece. We move on from it. The reaction from the lads after that is unbelievable. We could easily have crumbled and lost the game comfortably and if anything it made us grow as a team.""Gueye later apologized on Instagram: ""What happened does not reflect who I am or the values I stand for. Emotions can run high, but nothing justifies such behavior. I'll make sure it never happens again.""""They were the better team, with 11 players or 10,"" United coach Ruben Amorim admitted. ""I felt from the first minute that we were not there with the same intensity so they deserve the win. If they have 10, let's push the opponent to the final third. We need to be near on the transition. We needed to be focused. We need to do more.""Despite being down to 10 men, Everton took the lead through Dewsbury-Hall's impressive 18-meter strike. Manchester United dominated the remainder of the match with 25 shots on goal compared to Everton's three.""I will sleep well tonight,"" Dewsbury-Hall said. ""I am so thankful we got the three points.""The victory marked David Moyes' first win as a visiting coach at Old Trafford in the Premier League after 18 unsuccessful attempts.""I'm incredibly proud of the players and the fans,"" Moyes said. ""We got over the line with 10 men. We started the ball brilliantly well, got the sending off, the game changed. But we showed resilience. Manchester United are in pretty good form at the moment, so it was never going to be an easy game. Good goalkeeping when we needed it. The boys were brave.""The result ended United's unbeaten run, marking their first defeat since a 3-1 loss to Brentford almost two months ago. It was also the first time in 47 Premier League games that a visiting team won at Old Trafford with 10 men.Jordan Pickford's outstanding performance in goal helped secure the historic victory for Everton.",Everton defeated Manchester United 1-0 at Old Trafford on Monday. Idrissa Gueye was shown a red card for striking teammate Michael Keane.

The campaign spotlight and how Myles Garrett’s fandom makes him the perfect cultural crossover

Cleveland Browns star Myles Garrett has never been just a football player, he’s crafted an identity that mixes elite athleticism with a deep appreciation for pop culture, fantasy worlds, and fandom culture. With a new collaboration between Gatorade and the beloved Netflix series Stranger Things, Garrett is stepping into a role that feels tailor-made for him.As the fifth and final season of the show released, Garrett is helping launch Gatorade’s “No Ordinary Athlete” campaign, a revival of its classic 1987 concept, through a fresh digital and social media rollout. For Garrett, this isn’t just a branding moment, but a celebration of who he genuinely is: a superstar defensive end who proudly embraces geek culture while dominating on Sundays.Garrett’s connection to Stranger Things isn’t for marketing optics, it’s rooted in authentic passion. “As a huge Stranger Things fan, being able to bring what I do on the field and apply it to the 'No Ordinary Athlete' campaign has been an incredible experience,” he said, adding that partnering with Gatorade “made it even better.”His enthusiasm for the show was already well publicized when, back in 2022, he arrived for a game dressed as Vecna.That wasn’t just a costume, it was a statement that even one of the most feared defenders in football can be a big-hearted fanboy.This alignment between athlete and character has boosted the campaign’s momentum. With a five-sack game still fresh in fans’ memories, Garrett enters the spotlight as not just a Defensive Player of the Year frontrunner, but as a cultural ambassador bringing sports and sci-fi communities together.The campaign will be amplified through digital truck displays at Browns tailgates, and eventually in iconic public ad hubs like Times Square and Sunset Boulevard. Adding to the nostalgia factor, Gatorade is briefly reviving its legendary Citrus Cooler flavor alongside themed throwback merchandise, including the “1987 Hawkins Capsule” and “Upside Down Capsule.”Garrett has always stood out, not just for terrorizing quarterbacks, but for unapologetically being himself. In an era where the line between sports and entertainment keeps blurring, his latest venture proves he is, truly, no ordinary athlete.Also Read: Who is Myles Garrett’s girlfriend Chloe Kim?

Kris Boyd health update: Jets cornerback’s hospital return deepens concern after midtown shooting,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/kris-boyd-health-update-jets-cornerbacks-hospital-return-deepens-concern-after-midtown-shooting/articleshow/125626622.cms,"Jets cornerback Kris Boyd faces a challenging recovery after a midtown shooting, returning to the hospital due to health issues following a preseason shoulder injury. Despite the physical and emotional trauma, Boyd is showing resilience, supported by his team and the league as he focuses on healing and rebuilding his strength.

What Happened To Kris Boyd? New York Jets Star 'Critical' In Hospital After Manhattan Shooting

What this means for Kris Boyd’s future with the Jets and the long road ahead





The New York Jets community continues to rally around cornerback Kris Boyd as the 29-year-old faces another medical setback following the shocking midtown shooting earlier this month. After initially being released from Bellevue Hospital and sharing encouraging signs of recovery, Boyd revealed in his Instagram stories that he “had to return to the hospital due to my health issues,” sparking renewed concern among fans and players.The situation goes beyond a routine health check, this is a young father, teammate, and professional athlete trying to navigate physical injury and emotional trauma simultaneously. While investigators continue searching for the shooter, Boyd’s focus remains on healing, supported by an outpouring of compassion across the league.Boyd arrived in New York on a one-year, $1.6 million deal, expected to add depth and leadership to special teams. But fate took an unexpected turn: a preseason shoulder injury led to a season-ending IR designation, taking him off the field long before the November 16 shooting.That night, Boyd was struck in the abdomen, the bullet reportedly lodging in his lung and requiring multiple medical procedures. His emotional message, ""I'm sorry, I have no words at the moment. Just grateful! I'm coming along, starting to breathe on my own now. Sincerely appreciate everyone!"", offered a window into his resilience.Head coach Aaron Glenn emphasized Boyd’s spirit, calling him “upbeat,” and noting that both his wife and newborn child were safe and well. Physically, Boyd now faces a layered recovery: breathing rehabilitation, tissue repair, and stamina rebuilding, all while processing the psychological impact of violent trauma. Socially, this incident has galvanized the Jets family; privately, the challenge ahead is deeply personal.Whether or not Boyd returns to NFL action in 2026 may depend less on contracts and statistics and more on healing, trust, and time. For now, fans, teammates, and coaches are united in the same wish: that Kris Boyd walks away from this not just “fine,” but whole.Also Read: New footage exposes the heartbreaking final chase of Marshawn Kneeland before his tragic death","The New York Jets community continues to rally around cornerback Kris Boyd as the 29-year-old faces another medical setback.

Taylor Swift’s Eras docuseries faces fan backlash as Travis Kelce’s presence takes center stage,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/taylor-swifts-eras-docuseries-faces-fan-backlash-as-travis-kelces-presence-takes-center-stage/articleshow/125626597.cms,"Taylor Swift's new Disney+ docuseries 'The End Of An Era' is creating buzz. The series focuses on the Eras Tour but includes significant attention on Swift's relationship with Travis Kelce. While some fans welcome this personal touch, others expected a greater focus on the tour's musical journey. The docuseries promises a deeply personal look at Swift's life and career.

Taylor Swift Reveals Favorite Track, Talks Travis Kelce And New Album “The Life Of A Showgirl”

The delicate balance between artistry and intimacy in ‘The End Of An Era’





The rollout of The End Of An Era, Taylor Swift ’s upcoming Disney+ docuseries, has already become a cultural moment of its own. While the six-episode series promises an intimate look at the final stretch of the groundbreaking Eras Tour, the surprise emphasis on Swift’s fiancé, Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce , has generated mixed reactions online.Many fans are curious to see Swift embrace a more personal narrative, especially as she calls her relationship with Kelce “the most meaningful relationship of her life.” But a vocal portion of the fandom didn’t anticipate a romantic subplot becoming a core component of what they expected to be strictly a celebration of her musical era-defining journey.What makes this docuseries different from Swift’s previous projects isn’t simply access, it’s proximity. Kelce isn’t merely a cameo in the crowd; he’s shown backstage, interacting with her family, watching rehearsals, and existing literally steps away from the machinery of a record-breaking tour.Swift has historically drawn a sharp line between her art and her romantic life, so this pivot toward openness feels like a deliberate choice, almost a statement about evolving boundaries and emotional transparency.However, some fans have expressed discomfort, articulating that concern in blunt terms: ""I was not prepared for this to be about Travis as much as it appears to be,"" one user wrote, while another added, ""I want a behind the scenes from the tour.Not a behind the scenes from their relationship."" These reactions don’t come from hostility toward Kelce, many fans actually like him but rather from a fear that the artistry of the Eras Tour might become secondary to the relationship narrative.Yet the controversy also reveals something deeper about Swift’s legacy. She is not just chronicling a tour, she’s preserving the emotional context around it. Viewers may ultimately see that Kelce’s presence isn’t a distraction, but part of the ecosystem of support, love, and stability that carried Swift through her most demanding creative chapter.Whether fans embrace the shift or grumble through it, The End Of An Era is undeniably shaping up to be the most personal creative artifact Swift has ever released.Also Read: Taylor Swift’s latest decision with Travis Kelce leaves Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds stunned","Taylor Swift's new Disney+ docuseries 'The End Of An Era' is creating buzz.

Brittany’s influencer impact is shaping modern NFL fan culture beyond the game itself

Brittany Mahomes may not play a snap on the field, but she continues to own her spotlight in the world of sports culture and NFL celebrity fandom. On the eve of Thanksgiving football, the 30-year-old entrepreneur, mother of three, and wife to Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes unveiled her new wardrobe collaboration with the Chiefs and Abercrombie & Fitch, instantly fueling both fan excitement and social media buzz.Her fashion moment arrives at a critical time for Kansas City, as the reigning four-time Super Bowl champions walk a fine line between slipping out of playoff contention or staging a resurgence. Yet Brittany’s confident public presence reinforces a theme that’s followed her throughout the season: where the Chiefs go, the Mahomes brand follows, with loyal fan admiration continuing alongside the pressure of NFL expectations.In the six-image set posted to Instagram, Mahomes modeled a sporty tank top, track pants, a casual sweater, and a red dress that struck the perfect balance of elegant and game-day bold. She paired the outfits with Chiefs-inspired Adidas Samba sneakers and knee-high boots, blending luxury style with athletic energy.The comments came fast and adoring, one wrote, “Gorgeous per usual,” while another echoed, “Love it all!!” and “How cute are you!!!” It’s not simply routine social media praise; it reflects how Brittany has organically become a lifestyle ambassador for the Chiefs brand.From game-day luxury boxes to family-friendly stadium snapshots, Brittany has helped transform Kansas City’s football fandom into a broader cultural aesthetic tied to young families, fitness-leaning fashion, and aspirational lifestyle branding.As a co-owner of the Kansas City Current in the NWSL, she’s not only visible, she’s influential.

Gisele Bündchen’s $14.5 million real estate power move signals new priorities as she steps into her post-Brady identity,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/gisele-bndchens-14-5-million-real-estate-power-move-signals-new-priorities-as-she-steps-into-her-post-brady-identity/articleshow/125612546.cms,"Supermodel Gisele Bündchen has purchased a $14.5 million waterfront home next to her current Surfside residence, fueling speculation of a sprawling family compound. This strategic acquisition, her fourth Miami property, signifies a long-term vision for a permanent South Florida lifestyle, potentially integrating her blended family and aligning with her post-divorce evolution.

Inside the vision: how four Miami properties could shape a legacy-style compound

Gisele Bündchen’s latest real estate move has the Miami luxury market buzzing and for good reason. The supermodel, 45, has quietly purchased a $14.5 million waterfront home right next door to her current Surfside residence, which she shares with jiu-jitsu partner Joaquim Valente and their newborn son.While celebrity home acquisitions often stir curiosity, this one hints at something more strategic: a physical merging of properties that could become a sprawling family compound. With three Miami properties already under her name, plus a ranch outside Fort Lauderdale, Gisele’s acquisitions paint a picture of permanence, long-term planning, and a lifestyle firmly rooted in South Florida’s elite circles.This fourth home isn’t just a cosmetic addition, it’s a move that aligns with Bündchen’s post-divorce evolution. After buying her original Surfside lot in 2022 with intentions to rebuild, her latest purchase provides contiguous land, which in real estate development is gold.Side-by-side ownership means bigger possibilities: extended yards, connecting walkways, integrated security, and the kind of privacy only wealth can engineer. It suggests Gisele is building not just a home, but an ecosystem where her blended family, including children Vivian Lake and Benjamin Rein, can exist fluidly across properties.Her network also illuminates the environment she’s curating. Tom Brady still resides across the water on Indian Creek Island, the “Billionaire Bunker,” alongside Jeff Bezos and Ivanka Trump. Gisele has been photographed training and socializing within this circle, often alongside Valente. Their world is intimate, insulated, and unmistakably affluent, a tight-knit Miami micro-community where family life intersects with legacy lifestyle.The new Surfside home, lined with palms and equipped with a private dock leading into Biscayne Bay, offers exactly the kind of oceanfront living that complements Gisele’s wellness-forward identity. The listing describing it as the “ultimate coastal lifestyle” isn’t just marketing, it’s a blueprint that matches the life she’s building.Whether this becomes Miami’s most enviable celebrity compound remains to be seen, but one thing is clear: Gisele Bündchen is building something much bigger than a real estate portfolio, she is constructing a future, a haven, and a foundation for the next era of her life.Also Read: Gisele Bündchen stuns with Joaquim Valente after welcoming baby, proudly embracing life away from Tom Brady","Gisele Bündchen has purchased a $14.5 million waterfront home next to her current Surfside residence, fueling speculation of a sprawling family compound.

Her global fame and public relationship necessitate extensive preparations beyond typical VIP protection. Concerns include potential infiltration, theft, and stalking, amplified by social media's reach and the immense value of her attire, making the event a prime target for criminals.

Taylor Swift’s security challenges intensify as high-profile wedding approaches

The looming wedding of Taylor Swift and NFL star Travis Kelce has quietly evolved from a celebrity celebration into a full-scale security operation. Swift’s global stardom, combined with her increasingly public presence and the intense media orbit surrounding her relationship with Kelce, has put her team into a phase of preparation that goes well beyond traditional VIP protection.What’s unfolding is not merely about guarding a private event, it’s about navigating the reality of a social environment where Swift’s movements are chronically documented, her appearances forecasted by paparazzi patterns, and her status makes her a desirable target for both opportunistic thieves and calculated criminal activity. For Swift, security isn’t a luxury, it’s survival planning.Behind the scenes, Swift’s team is reportedly coordinating with venue specialists, private security consultants, cybersecurity trackers, and logistical analysts to counter potential infiltration, theft, or stalking attempts. The concern isn’t rooted in paranoia, but in precedent.Swift has already dealt with threats, from digital harassment to real-world stalkers, including one who went missing after previous police tracking. Those who work in security emphasize that the risks escalate when a celebrity’s routine becomes predictable.This reality is summed up by one source who said, “It's not about whether she's careless… It's that her life is public property, her every move is charted.”The ubiquity of social media, fan livestreams, and open-source location tracking has fundamentally changed the nature of risk. Another insider noted, “Taylor is in love and living openly, but her security team is on edge. The value of what she wears could tempt professionals who plan months in advance. ”A former celebrity bodyguard added bluntly, “A wedding for someone like Taylor Swift is a dream scenario for thieves; high-profile guests, expensive gifts, staff turnover, and everyone distracted, plus the millions of dollars of jewelry she will be wearing.”Even Swift’s closest inner circle reportedly understands the stakes, not just for personal privacy, but for professional reputations. As her wedding date nears, the event is expected to be less of a public spectacle and more of a fortified celebration, protected by layers of unseen preparation designed to keep the world’s most photographed bride safe.Also Read: Taylor Swift’s Disney+ docuseries faces unexpected legal threat from Florida courtroom as Travis Kelce remains silent","Taylor Swift's upcoming wedding to Travis Kelce has transformed into a major security operation.

Thanksgiving Day took a worrying turn for Detroit Lions fans when Amon-Ra St. Brown limped off the field against the Green Bay Packers. The star wide receiver suffered an ankle injury, forcing him out of the game and leaving fans concerned about his availability for upcoming matchups. Here’s everything we know so far about his status and what it means for the Lions.St. Brown went down in the first quarter while blocking on a running play. An offensive lineman rolled up on his ankle from behind, causing the injury. He immediately limped off the field and headed to the locker room for evaluation, leaving the Lions’ offense without one of its most reliable weapons early in the game.Initially listed as “questionable to return,” St. Brown was officially ruled out for the remainder of the Thanksgiving clash. Before exiting, he had been targeted just once, finishing the game without a catch. The team has not yet disclosed the full extent of the ankle injury, but walking off under his own power is a small positive sign.Amon-Ra St. Brown has been a key part of Detroit’s offense in 2025, racking up 75 receptions, 884 receiving yards, and nine touchdowns before this game. Losing him, even temporarily, represents a significant blow to the passing game.With other injuries already affecting Detroit’s offense, St. Brown’s absence could force adjustments in play-calling, more reliance on other receivers or tight ends, and a greater focus on the run game.At this point, the exact severity of St. Brown’s ankle injury remains unclear. There is no official timeline for his return, and team updates over the coming days will determine whether he can play in the Lions’ next matchup. Fans and fantasy football players should monitor official reports closely before making any assumptions about his availability.Amon-Ra St. Brown’s ankle injury is a major storyline from Thanksgiving’s Lions-Packers clash. While he was able to walk off the field, his absence has immediate implications for Detroit’s offense and could impact upcoming games. Fans will be watching for updates closely, hoping their star receiver can recover quickly and get back to doing what he does best, making big plays and keeping the Lions competitive.Also read - Who is Jack White performing with Eminem at the Packers-Lions Thanksgiving halftime?","Amon-Ra St. Brown went down in the first quarter while blocking on a running play.

Taylor Swift opened up about how she could not inform Ed Sheeran about her engagement to Travis Kelce





Taylor Swift and Ed Sheeran have been good friends for years and were even spotted together at Selena Gomez’s wedding with Benny Blanco.But it seems, despite them looking happy together, Ed Sheeran reportedly does not like some of the things Taylor Swift has done and their friendship is now “strained”.A few weeks ago, as per the Daily Mail, a source revealed that Ed Sheeran reportedly has a problem with how Taylor Swift announced her new album just weeks prior and how it affected the ranking of his newly released album, Play.As per the Daily Mail, a source has revealed that, “Ed takes these things really seriously, and carefully plans his album releases. He announced his album with four months’ notice, but then Taylor announced hers for just two weeks after…”The source added, “This left his team scrabbling to get as much attention before hers dropped.

Devlin Carter’s 2,00,000 dollar season ticket investment fuels his public frustration

Zach LaVine ended up in a spotlight he likely didn’t ask for, and it wasn’t about his scoring. It was all about his defense, or rather the absence of it, during a time when the Suns kept striking the Kings from long range. He let six wide-open threes go by, and that was the last straw for courtside fan Devlin Carter.Carter got up, pointed at LaVine, and sent a clear message that tackled the issue directly. Play defense. That moment sparked a fiery exchange that quickly went viral, but the intensity just showed how preventable the whole thing was. Fans don’t react like that over a single mistake. They react when they notice ongoing issues from a player who has star-level expectations. Carter’s video the next day only reinforced that feeling, breaking down every missed rotation that resulted in Suns points. And if you pay attention, the discussion isn’t really about the fans. It’s about LaVine’s long-standing criticism coming back to the surface in real time.Sitting in the front row right behind the Kings' bench, Devlin Carter—a Sacramento local, content creator, and self-styled ""Kings superfan"" with more than 100,000 followers on social media—had reached his limit.Carter, who spends a significant amount on season tickets, which are said to cost over $200,000 each year, is well-known for his enthusiastic support of his team. However, on this particular night, his fervor took a sharp turn.During Christie's timeout huddle, Carter leaned over the bench and directed his frustration at LaVine. ""Yo, we don't pay to watch you not play defense,"" Carter yelled out, pointing to the Suns' many chances to shoot from long range. People who were there and the videos caught the scene, with Carter standing there, arms waving passionately at the court. His remark reflected a common feeling among Kings fans, who are getting tired of the team's 5-14 slump and LaVine's hit-or-miss performance on that side of the game.Carter later pointed out that his frustration came from six specific defensive mistakes made by LaVine during the first half, each one allowing the Suns to score easily. ""It wasn't personal; it was about the game,"" Carter shared in a video after his ejection on Instagram and TikTok. He stated that as a paying customer, fans like him have the right to expect accountability, particularly from a star who earns a high salary.For LaVine, this moment marks a pivotal point in his time with Sacramento. After being traded during the Bulls' chaos, he's getting used to a new system while carrying the weight of max-contract expectations. The upcoming games, including Saturday's home match against the Denver Nuggets, will reveal whether this sparks a turnaround or widens the gap.Also Read: Cade Cunningham moves into MVP top five as Detroit Pistons extend their 11-game win streak","Zach LaVine let six wide-open threes go by, and that was the last straw for courtside fan Devlin Carter.

Tyrese Haliburton makes impressive progress in Achilles recovery

Recently, NBA star Tyrese Haliburton and his partner Jade Jones made headlines. After injuring his Achilles tendon, the Indiana Pacers player is beginning to demonstrate his recovery. In Game 7 of the 2025 NBA Finals against the Oklahoma City Thunder, Haliburton sustained the terrible injury.As he is recovering, his fiancée, Jade Jones, posted a video of him demonstrating his ability to dunk the basketball on her Instagram stories. Shortly after that, she also posted a second video from their wedding, celebrating Thanksgiving . She shared some sweet glimpses of life with her fiancé to celebrate the cozy occasion.In July 2025, the couple announced their engagement in a lively Instagram post. Since then, they have been sharing romantic photos and dropping clues about their future together. Additionally, Jones recently posted a Thanksgiving video on Instagram. She captioned the photo:“Thankful more than ever..”In the video, the couple dressed formally poses for pictures in a variety of interior and outdoor settings. Jones is dressed in several white gowns, while the NBA player is dressed in a black suit.A downtown street with a vintage convertible, a large structure with traditional architectural features, and other striking interior settings could be seen throughout the video.Even though they haven't yet released a complete ""wedding video,"" the elegant pre-wedding pictures of the couple and their public declarations of love and appreciation already feel like a lovely preface to that chapter.Furthermore, Jones and Haliburton never shy away from showing appreciation towards each other on public platforms. Recently, on Instagram, Indiana's star player posted a video to show his recovery progress. Jones shared the post on the social media platform and wrote:""Day by day.""On the other hand, it is anticipated that Halliburton will not play for the Pacers this season. Before he returns to action, the squad wants him to take his time healing and be fully recovered. The All-Star guard can make a one-handed slam and has gradually become better.The Pacers are 2-14 in the Eastern Conference and have had a difficult season without the 6-foot-5 guard. Without their best player, Indiana appears to be a different squad. Five months have passed since Haliburton suffered a horrific injury in Game 7 of the NBA Finals.He is allegedly recovering more quickly than expected, which is good news for the Pacers. The positive update was provided by NBA reporter Scott Agness via X. Agness said:""Haliburton remains ahead of schedule.. This video encapsulates the Pacers’ season. Star player making progress as another looks on in a boot after surgery. More checkpoints to come.""Given that a torn Achilles tendon usually takes eight to ten months to heal, Haliburton is far ahead of schedule to be ready for the 2026–2027 season, especially because the 25-year-old can already tolerate the force of jumping into the air to dunk a basketball.Also read: “It's Happening:- Tyrese Haliburton’s fiancee Jade Jones provides update as NBA All-Star's fiancé sparks marriage rumors","Indiana Pacers star Tyrese Haliburton injured his Achilles tendon in Game 7 of the 2025 NBA Finals against the Oklahoma City Thunder.

Who Wins the Trade?

Theare once again exploring the trade market, and this time the focus is on Dallas Mavericks center Daniel Gafford. With the team’s center rotation struggling to provide consistent rim protection and rebounding, Gafford has quickly emerged as one of the most compelling solutions. The rumored three-team structure involving the Warriors, Mavericks, and Chicago Bulls aims to address major roster needs across all sides, making this more than just a simple talent swap.Early outlines of the proposal suggest that Golden State would land Gafford while Dallas receives guard help and Chicago adds a young wing player. This trade concept is positioned as a strategic reshaping for each franchise heading into the 2025-26 season. As the Ringer’s Bill Simmons noted, the structure draws heavily from “recent trade proposals, player performance data, and expert analysis of NBA trade strategies and player fit,” framing it as a scenario with realistic traction and multi-team benefits. (H/t: Sporting News)The rumored deal includes the Warriors, Mavericks, and Chicago Bulls. Golden State would receive Daniel Gafford and possibly an expiring contract.Dallas would land Coby White and draft compensation, while Chicago would take in Jonathan Kuminga as their centerpiece return.This structure attempts to satisfy three different roster objectives:• Warriors: A defensive, high-efficiency center who can anchor the paint.• Mavericks: A guard who can stabilize the backcourt next to rising rookie Cooper Flagg.• Bulls: A young, athletic wing with scoring upside as part of either a rebuild or competitive reset.• Immediate improvement in rim protection, rebounding, and interior physicality.• Gafford brings key skills the Warriors currently lack: vertical spacing, shot-blocking, and elite finishing.• More lineup flexibility behind Draymond Green, especially against bigger Western Conference teams.• Coby White strengthens their guard rotation and offers scoring and playmaking support.• Added draft assets improve long-term roster maneuverability.• Expiring contracts help maintain future cap flexibility.• Jonathan Kuminga fits their need for a young, athletic wing with real two-way potential.• Gives Chicago a player who can develop into a high-ceiling scorer.• Aligns with their mixed approach of retooling while trying to stay competitive.• Gafford’s efficiency and defense stand out. He shot 72.5 percent from the field in 2023-24 and ranks in the top 2 percent of rim defenders among big men.• Warriors reduce opponent scoring in the paint and add an athletic pick-and-roll partner.• Dallas receives a guard who fits their long-term core and gains draft capital.• Bulls acquire a versatile wing talent on a rookie scale contract.• Warriors sacrifice draft picks and one of their more promising young assets.• Mavericks lose a center who pairs well with Luka Dončić and has been reliable on both ends.• Bulls face chemistry hurdles as they incorporate new rotation pieces.• Gafford’s effectiveness may fluctuate depending on his adjustment to Golden State’s system.Gafford’s statistical profile highlights why Golden State has interest. He ranks near the top of the league in efficiency, rim deterrence, and shot-blocking, and his fit alongside the Warriors’ perimeter defenders is clear. White provides dynamic backcourt help for Dallas, and Kuminga’s athletic profile fits Chicago’s timeline and needs.Based on current team needs, the Warriors appear to gain the most. They address a major roster gap with a big man who complements their defensive style and provides efficient, reliable interior production. Dallas improves its guard depth and shapes its roster for the future, while Chicago adds a promising young player with upside.However, each team receives something meaningful:• Warriors get a defensive anchor.• Mavericks acquire guard help and future assets.• Bulls add a young scoring forward.If Gafford’s impact translates effectively into Golden State’s system, the Warriors emerge as the primary winners of this rumored trade. The deal also aligns with Dallas’ direction and Chicago’s long-term planning, creating a scenario where all three franchises find clear benefits.Also read: NBA trade rumors: Los Angeles Lakers expected to pursue $74 million Sacramento Kings superstar in major trade push This trade framework, built around roster balance and strategic fit, has the potential to influence the Western Conference landscape heading into the 2025-26 season.","The Golden State Warriors are once again exploring the trade market.

Miami Heat ends Milwaukee Bucks’ perfect NBA Cup run, as Erik Spoelstra hits historic milestone

Eric Spoelstra opened up about his historic 800th win

Erik Spoelstra, the coach of the Miami Heat, celebrated his 800th victory. This happened during the NBA Cup game on Wednesday night, when Tyler Herro scored 29 points, Bam Adebayo finished with 17 points and 11 rebounds, and the Miami Heat defeated the Milwaukee Bucks 106-103.After the Heat defeated the Bucks in an Emirates NBA Cup 2025 Group Play game, Miami coach Spoelstra was taken aback by the sight of water bottles being thrown at him from every direction in a happy locker room.Miami has moved to 3-1 in Cup games and 9-1 at home this season with two goals from Norman Powell, Andrew Wiggins, and Kel'el Ware. If Milwaukee defeats New York on Friday, Miami will win Group C. If the Knicks prevail, the Heat will require assistance to go to the quarterfinals.Milwaukee's Ryan Rollins scored 26 points, while Myles Turner scored 24 and Gary Trent Jr. scored 15. Giannis Antetokounmpo has missed the last four of the Bucks' six consecutive losses. Along with Jerry Sloan and Gregg Popovich, Spoelstra is the third coach in NBA history to reach 800 wins with just one team during the regular season.Spoelstra had no idea what was happening. He said Wednesday night:“I was very confused.. I was calculating that maybe we’ve qualified for the Cup. Then I’m looking around and nobody else is getting water dumped on them, and I’m like, ‘Wait a minute — what’s going on here?’”Spoelstra discovered the milestone at that point. He then said:“It hasn’t sunk in yet because I wasn’t aware of it. It’s fitting that it comes on the eve of Thanksgiving..I just feel incredible gratitude for this organization and all of these years. I’m having a hell of a time. I love what I do, I love coaching, I love this profession, I love working for this organization, I love working for — and with — amazing players and staff.”The Bucks were 10-0 in that round of games since the tournament. Milwaukee lost an NBA Cup group stage game for the first time. As of Wednesday, Bucks coach Doc Rivers has an 8-0 record in Cup games.However, the Heat haven't missed a day of work, and Spoelstra hasn't either. Heat guard Tyler Herro said:“It’s huge. I’m trying to think of how old I was when Spo probably got his first one and then to be where he is now — he’s got 800 of them — is insane.. It’s great to be a part of a great organization who’s historically been one of the top.”It turns out that Spoelstra was unaware of the achievement. He is currently 33 victories away from 16th place. On the other hand, Miami is currently in third position in the Eastern Conference standings after winning six straight games.Also read: Miami Heat vs Golden State Warriors (11-19-2025) game preview: When and where to watch, expected lineup, injury report, prediction, and more",Miami Heat defeated Milwaukee Bucks 106-103 in NBA Cup 2025 Group Play game.

Stephen Curry’s injury puts Golden State Warriors in a tough spot

Golden State Warriors is going to have a tough week without Stephen Curry

After injuring his right quadriceps, Stephen Curry hobbled off the bench late in Golden State's 104-100 loss to the Houston Rockets on Wednesday night. To ascertain his condition, an MRI of the issue will be performed. Curry will now be absent from the Warriors for the next week or so.According to sources cited by ESPN's Shams Charania and Anthony Slater on Thursday, Golden State anticipates Curry missing ""a week or a little more"" due to a quad contusion that he suffered. Additionally, fantasy managers should anticipate missing at least three games due to Curry's initial schedule.According to Charania and Slater, Steph Curry seems to have escaped a serious injury, which is fantastic news for the Warriors. Following Wednesday's game, Warriors coach Steve Kerr informed the media that Curry would have an MRI.Charania wrote on X:“The Golden State Warriors anticipate Stephen Curry will miss around a week or a little more with a quad contusion suffered Wednesday night, sources tell me and @anthonyVslater. He's believed to have avoided any serious issue. Return will depend on how quad responds to treatment…”Given that Curry may be sidelined for a while, the Warriors will need to reorganize. Coach Steve Kerr said:“It obviously changes everything, our rotations, how we’re playing, who we’re playing through, so we’ll see..When I heard it was a quad I was actually kind of relieved, better than an ankle or a knee, so hopefully he can recover quickly and be OK. But we’ve got to hold down the fort.”After the game, Kerr claimed to have seen Curry struggling. The two-time MVP finished with seven rebounds, five assists, 14 points on 4-for-13 shooting, and seven of the Warriors' 16 mistakes that resulted in 22 points for Houston.Rookie Will Richard said:“That’s a challenge, if Steph is out everybody else has to kind of improve their game a lot to fill that void.”Jimmy Butler pushed everyone to ""care more"" about the details, particularly if Curry isn't there. He said that ""it's just sad"" that the Warriors occasionally don't execute their game plan and do the small things.He continued:“What will change the most? I think we’re going to have to be damn near perfect. We ain’t going to have the ultimate bailout on our team, but even when he is on the floor we’re going to have to do our job because we make the game real difficult…”He further said:“As great as a basketball player as he is he has a really hard job every single day, he’s got to be the Batman of all Batmans and save us every night. That ain’t what he’s here to do.”On the other hand, Curry got hurt late in the fourth quarter of the game against the Rockets. Although he played despite the injury at first, he had to go to the locker room in the closing minutes of the defeat.If Curry misses exactly one week, he won't play in the Warriors' next three games. He might miss the Saturday at home against the New Orleans Pelicans, Tuesday, December 2, at home against the Oklahoma City Thunder, and Thursday, December 4, on the road against the Philadelphia 76ers.Also read: Is Stephen Curry out of NBA 2025- 26 season?

Dwight Howard mixes humor and kindness in viral Thanksgiving gesture that steals the spotlight

This isn't the only time Dwight Howard's philanthropic nature grabbed attention

Dwight Howard has always celebrated Thanksgiving with or without his family. Years ago, Howard and the Howard family got together to serve a special Thanksgiving meal to the youth of Southwest Atlanta. Harry The Hawk and the Hawks Cheerleaders also joined them during the special moment.This year was no exception. With a touching gesture, the NBA icon jump started Thanksgiving for two women by buying groceries for them. When Thanksgiving finally arrived, he went outside to share the joy and rejoice with others. He then posted a video on Instagram showing himself browsing the shopping aisles and lending helping hand to others.In the viral Instagram clip, which Howard shared, he could be seen approaching the lady with a smile. He then said:“I wanted to spread love to some people today and pay for their groceries. Yeah, so, you know, I don't know if you would mind that or not, you know…”Confused and possibly not being able to recognize the NBA legend, the woman, asked:“Sure. You on Instagram? YouTuber?”Dwight, keeping a perfectly straight face, replied:“Yeah, I used to be on OnlyFans but I gave up that life.”Surprised, she continued:“Okay. You didn’t play basketball ever? I thought about it.”Then, Dwight dismissed it with a laugh and paid her bill. Later, as he went down the aisle, he saw another customer. He then did the same and offered to pay for her groceries as well. She clapped joyfully, surprised and happy. The caption of the video read:“What are you grateful for this thanksgiving..”Additionally, he also celebrated the holiday along with his teammates. In 2022, despite missing time due to a knee injury, Howard celebrated Thanksgiving and bonded with his colleagues over karaoke. He performed the beloved song from the 1980s, ""We Are the World."" In the viral clips, he looked extremely satisfied.Helping others on Thanksgiving is not an isolated incident for Howard.

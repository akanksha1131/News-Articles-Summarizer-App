Poll How confident are you in India's ability to handle Usman Tariq's spin bowling? Very Confident Somewhat Confident Not Confident

NEW DELHI: India’s preparations for the high-voltage T20 World Cup clash against Pakistan have taken a clear tactical direction, with wicketkeeper-batter Ishan Kishan insisting that the team is already equipped to tackle the unique challenge posed by spinner Usman Tariq . Fresh off a commanding win over Namibia, Kishan revealed that facing Namibia skipper Gerhard Erasmus — who also bowls with a sidearm action — offered valuable rehearsal ahead of the much-anticipated showdown.Kishan’s explosive 24-ball 61 laid the foundation for India’s imposing 209/9, ensuring momentum even during a middle-overs slowdown. Speaking after the match, the left-hander emphasised that India’s batters have already completed their homework against Tariq’s unconventional action.“No, I think we have already done the preparation part, and now it is just time to watch the ball and play our natural game,” he said, underlining the team’s belief in sticking to basics despite the hype around the Pakistani spinner.According to Kishan, video analysis and on-field exposure to Erasmus’ bowling proved crucial. “At this level, we just watch a few videos, and we get an idea of what kind of bowling is going to happen. So we are just keeping it simple. Yeah, he [Erasmus] bowled pretty well today, and I think there was quite a bit of learning for us,” he added, suggesting that India’s approach will revolve around clarity rather than overthinking.Reflecting on the Namibia clash, Kishan explained that although the surface looked flat, the ball initially held up, forcing him and Sanju Samson to pick their moments carefully. The attacking opener’s knock, combined with Hardik Pandya ’s blazing fifty, powered India to a total that proved far beyond Namibia’s reach as spinners later dismantled the chase.Kishan also spoke candidly about his personal evolution after leading Jharkhand to a maiden Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy triumph. “I think I am a changed man now… earlier I used to joke around 24x7, but now it is just two-three hours. I am focusing more on batting and my wicket-keeping,” he admitted, highlighting a more disciplined mindset.Looking ahead to the Pakistan encounter, Kishan acknowledged the magnitude of the occasion but stressed that preparation remains process-driven. “Pakistan clash, obviously, it would be a special one for everyone… once we get there, we look at the wicket and just play accordingly,” he said.",Wicketkeeper-batter Ishan Kishan insists India are already equipped to tackle spinner Usman Tariq.

T20 World Cup: Namibia's Gerhard Erasmus upset after lack of night practice before India match

CHENNAI: The ongoing men’s T20 World Cup has been defined by one recurring plot: Associate nations refusing to roll over against the ‘big boys’.In the wake of these results, the Associate teams have begun pressing for regular fixtures against Full Member nations.On Thursday, USA batter Shayan Jahangir didn’t mince words while stating that the team has not received the kind of exposure and financial backing it needs from the ICC.It is to be noted that the ICC had taken over the welfare of USA players in the national set-up in Dec last year, including a key commitment to pro-vide financial support.Earlier, in Sept, the ICC had suspended USA Cricket (USAC) for serious breaches of the ICC Membership Criteria, with the board grappling with a severe governance and financial crisis. Things aren’t rosy on the field either. Two defeats on the bounce have pushed USA to the edge, and Friday’s clash against the Netherlands at the MA Chidambaram Stadium will decide their fate.A defeat will shut the door on their Super-8 hopes.“The exposure and the kind of funding that we also get from ICC are simply not enough. We’ve been given the tag of an Associate nation but we are nothing short of a great team. We gave India a good contest.We haven’t been nurtured properly,” said the Paki-stan-born Jahangir.“It’s all our players who are putting in the hard yards without financial resources, without infrastructure. I think if ICC pays more attention to all the Associates, you’ll see more big games,” he added.According to the ICC schedule, USA play only 12 matches a year.“I think it has a lot to do with the funding as well. If we have that funding from the ICC… it’s a request from us to really look into it. I’m telling you, there’s so much talent in Associate cricket. There are so many cricketers who are so good but not given the exposure. There’s this one guy from Nepal and he had scored a nine-ball half-century.”", Associate teams have begun pressing for regular fixtures against Full Member nations.

T20 World Cup: Namibia's Gerhard Erasmus upset after lack of night practice before India match

NEW DELHI: On paper, Friday’s T20 World Cup fixture at the Arun Jaitley Stadium pits the 17th-ranked T20I side against the 19th. In reality, UAE vs Canada is less about rankings and more about two teams trying to steady themselves after bruising starts and doing so with very different baggage.The UAE arrive as the more seasoned Associate outfit. Since the last T20 World Cup, they have played 11 matches against Full Members; Canada, by contrast, played none. Yet UAE’s preparations were rocked by a controversy that threatens to overshadow their campaign. Top-order batter Muhammad Zohaib was sent home on the eve of their opening encounter against New Zealand, officially for “disciplinary reasons” as stated by the Emirates Cricket Board, with the ICC citing “player mental well-being and team welfare issues”.Zohaib has reportedly claimed he was forced out. When a squad is built on consistency and clarity of roles, excluding a first-choice batter is no minor adjustment, it shakes the dressing-room balance.The immediate impact was visible in UAE’s opening fixture in Chennai. UAE post-ed a competitive total thanks to half-centuries from Muhammad Waseem and Alishan Sharafu, but the rest of the batting card eroded.Then their bowlers were unable to apply pressure as New Zealand chased down 174 in just 15.2 overs.Against Canada, the onus again will fall heavily on captain Waseem. His unbeaten 66 off 45 balls in the match against New Zealand showcased his command over tempo, clean hitting, and the ability to bat deep. UAE’s hopes of settling their campaign may well hinge on whether their skipper can again be both the anchor as well as the accelerator.Canada also faced a heavy defeat in their opening match against South Africa in Ahmedabad. They conceded too many and fell short with the bat, losing by 57 runs.Canada’s story, particularly in this tournament, carries a distinct subcontinental thread. The squad is shaped by players with Punjabi roots — from both sides of the India-Pakistan border — giving the team a cultural and cricketing blend that mirrors several diaspora leagues across the world. Dhaliwal embodies that identity. Born in Chandigarh, raised cricket-wise in Mohali, and now Canada’s senior statesman at 37, he remains their most elegant batter. His 64 against South Africa was a reminder of his range — late cuts, inside-out drives, deft flicks, and the patience of some-one who learned the game on Indian pitches before carrying it across continents.There is also a charming footnote to his cricket journey. As a youngster at the PCA Stadium in Mohali, he once threw balls to an eight-year-old Shubman Gill when Gill’s father brought him for practice.",UAE take on Canada in Friday's T20 World Cup clash in New Delhi.

T20 World Cup: Namibia's Gerhard Erasmus upset after lack of night practice before India match

Sri Lanka produced a dominant all-round performance to crush Oman by 105 runs in Pallekele. Sri Lanka posted 225/5, their second-highest total in T20 World Cup history, before bundling the chase out of contention long before the finish.After Kamil Mishara and Pathum Nissanka fell inside the Powerplay, Kusal Mendis took charge with a fluent 61 off 45 balls. He anchored the innings, threading seven boundaries and ensuring momentum never dipped.Sri Lanka’s real acceleration came in the middle overs. Pavan Rathnayake blazed 60 from 28 deliveries, peppering eight fours and a six. Captain Dasun Shanaka then delivered a sensational cameo, a 20-ball 50 (2x4, 5x6), the quickest T20I half-century by a Sri Lankan. By the time he departed in the 19th over, Oman’s bowlers were reeling.Kamindu Mendis applied the finishing gloss with an unbeaten 19 from seven as Sri Lanka surged past the 220-run mark. For Oman, left-arm quick Shah Faisal briefly impressed, conceding just 11 from his first three overs before an expensive final over distorted otherwise tidy figures.In response, Oman’s innings never gained momentum. Aamir Kaleem and captain Jatinder Singh fell inside the first over, and the innings struggled to recover from 12/2.Dushmantha Chameera’s (2/19) pace and Maheesh Theekshana’s guile – the spinner returning with figures of 2/11– ensured Oman remained pinned.Wasim Ali’s 27 offered fleeting resistance, but wickets fell in clusters. Mohammad Nadeem stood firm with an unbeaten 53 off 56 balls.Brief Scores: Sri Lanka 225/5 (Mendis 61, Rathnayake 60) beat Oman 120/9 (Nadeem 53*, Theekshana 2-11, Chameera 2-19) by 105 runs.","Sri Lanka posted 225/5, their second-highest total in T20 World Cup history.

T20 World Cup | Tilak Varma provides update on Abhishek's fitness, mindset during rehab

NEW DELHI: For a powerhouse team like India, matches against teams like Namibia are more about identifying chinks in their game. Namibia, a team made of mostly amateur cricketers, did expose some underlying concerns in the Indian team even as they spent most of the night at the Arun Jaitley Stadium being heavily outplayed.India did pile up 209/9 batting first and register a comprehensive 93-run win. The bowlers restored normalcy after Namibia got off to a flyer in the chase, scoring 67/1 in the first seven overs to bowl out the minnows for 116. The bowlers just did what was expected of them.But were they absolutely convincing with the bat against the so-called ‘whipping boys’ of this T20 World Cup? The answer won’t be a resounding yes. The Kotla pitch, having endured an unending cricket season since the last IPL, expectedly offered some grip and turn for the bowlers. Barring Ishan Kishan ’s 24-ball 61 and Hardik Pandya ’s 28-ball 52, the overwhelming dominance expected against Namibia was missing.This match was India’s final preparation before the high-pressure game against Pakistan in Colombo on Sunday. Coming into the tournament, India’s batting hinged largely on Abhishek Sharma’s consistent assault on the new ball at the top of the game. As he missed Thursday’s match due to weakness after a stomach illness, Sanju Samson wasted one more opportunity to reassure the team management in case Abhishek fails to gain fitness for the Pakistan game.Samson’s eight-ball 22 may appear as it fit the template of the India’s batting in the Powerplay. That he fell into the trap laid by the Namibians so easily will remain a concern.Samson put away the two short balls from Ben Shikongo in the second over deep into the stands at the square-leg boundary with consummate ease. Shikongo offered another short delivery with a little more effort only for Samson to miscue it to the hands of the deep mid-wicket fielder stationed particularly for that one shot.Ishan will need more support from the other end against a more seasoned Pakistan bowling on the evidently sluggish pitch at the Premadasa in Colombo. The Indian team management revealed they have altered their attack-at-all-times approach and handed the anchor role to Tilak Varma at No. 3 and Suryakumar Yadav at No. 4 to control the middle overs. It seemed the duo got overtly consumed by that idea.As the pitch started to hold a little, Tilak and Surya almost happily went into their shells. The team that built its brand around not caring about risks, suddenly showed symptoms of complete aversion to taking risks. Tilak’s scratchy 21-ball 25-run innings came to an end when his first attempt to go big resulted in miscuing Namibia captain Gerhard Erasmus’ slingy off-spin delivery to long-off. Surya too was flummoxed by left-arm spinner Bernard Scholtz as he tried to step out and got comprehensively stumped by wicketkeeper Zane Green for an unconvincing 13-ball 12.India scoring just 20 runs off Erasmus and losing two wickets in four overs may not be the ideal result keeping Pakistan’s unconventional off-spinner Umar Tarique in mind.It was Hardik’s burst clean and straight hitting burst that got India rolling again after suffering a mini collapse from 104/1 to 124/4. The big flourish never came beyond Hardik’s blade.It wasn’t an easy pitch to bat on by any stretch of imagination. But one expects a experienced batting lineup to counter it much better against a bowling attack which is still getting used to international cricket.

JAIPUR: The IPL 2026 season is now just over a month away and yet the fate of Rajasthan Royals’ traditional home at Sawai Mansingh (SMS) Stadium here hangs in the balance. Stadium authorities are facing an intense race against time to address the damning findings of a recent independent audit report commissioned by the franchise, which has exposed serious shortcomings in the venue’s ability to safely handle the crowds.The Royals got a comprehensive third-party assessment done by Tata Projects to address their longstanding concerns over public safety. The report has confirmed what the franchise officials had been suspecting for long: severe deficiencies in life safety, structural integrity and statutory compliance, highlighting SMS Stadium fails minimum safety standards across all parameters.: Pointing out several high-risk and critical safety issues detailed in the 700-page report, a source close to the matter says, “Among the most pressing concerns are severe fire and life-safety lapses, including the complete absence of dedicated fire escape routes in VIP areas, along with major sections of spectator stands exceeding their design life, inadequate exit provisions, poor earthing systems, and elevated risks of fire and electrocution.“These form just part of a lengthy catalogue of deficiencies uncovered by the independent audit commissioned by Royals and conducted by Tata Projects.”Incidentally, last year on June 2, barely two days before the unfortunate stampede occurred in Bangalore, Rajasthan Royals had written to the Rajasthan State Sports Council (RSSC) seeking permission to conduct an audit to evaluate current structural integrity and overall health of the stadium.“The letter had clearly mentioned that the franchise wished to engage a competent agency, and the test is expected to take three to four weeks,” the source adds.On September 12, the franchise followed up the request with another letter to the state sports council, formally initiating a comprehensive safety review and highlighted the urgency for it citing the RCB incident and underscoring proactive measures.“RSSC granted permission on Nov 28 and the audit was conducted from Dec 25-Jan 26. Tests were conducted according to the central government established and updated national regulatory codes like National Building Code, National Electric Code, Fire Code and Safety Code in Sports Ground,” say those in the know of developments.: In a strong show of support for the stadium, Rajasthan chief secretary V Srinivas has written directly to BCCI secretary Devajit Saikia, assuring top officials that spectator safety and security remain the state govt’s highest priority.“In reference to the upcoming IPL season, it has come to my notice that Rajasthan Royals, the home franchise of Rajasthan, has raised certain concerns regarding the safety and security of SMS Stadium. I wish to reiterate that the safety and security of spectators is paramount for the state government. I would like to categorically state that there is no issue concerning the safety, security, or structural integrity of the stadium infrastructure,” the letter reads.“The Government of Rajasthan constituted a very high-level committee to thoroughly examine all aspects related to the stadium’s safety and security. The committee comprised senior professors from MNIT, one of the reputed institutes of engineering and technology of Government of India, senior officials of the Government of Rajasthan, engineers from the Public Works Department (PWD), and other domain experts. The committee has submitted its report and has found the stadium to be fully safe and secure. The committee has, however, made certain suggestions for minor improvements, and the government is fully committed to completing all recommended works well in time before the commencement of the IPL season,” letter mentions.Defending the stadium amid safety concerns, RSSC chairman Neeraj K Pawan said authorities view the required fixes as manageable. “The issues identified are largely minor in nature and can be addressed promptly. This includes repairing and upgrading fire exits, strengthening structural safety in the South Block, further refining the evacuation plan, replacing outdated floodlights, fine-tuning seating arrangements, and improving alleys, walkways, and entry-exit points. We have ample time and resources to complete these works before the IPL season begins,” Pawan says.",The fate of Rajasthan Royals' traditional home at Sawai Mansingh (SMS) Stadium here hangs in the balance.

NEW DELHI: If we look down the points table of the so-called Group of Death of the ongoing ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2026, the story is already familiar. New Zealand and South Africa are battling for supremacy, with Afghanistan almost sidelined after two defeats.The two Associate nations, United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Canada, are anchored to the bottom, somewhat in search of their first taste of World Cup joy.For both teams, Friday’s clash appears to be the clearest opportunity to walk away from this tournament with something to celebrate.Canada shared the Arun Jaitley Stadium with champions India on Wednesday. The co-hosts conducted an optional training session on one side of the ground while the Canadians went through a marathon four-hour net session under lights.UAE, meanwhile, had a scheduled rest day.With the main venue occupied by the India vs Namibia match on Thursday, UAE had to shift their training base to the Palam A Stadium, about 18 km away from Arun Jaitley Stadium, to finish their preparations ahead of their game on Friday.Both sides have endured winless warm-up campaigns and defeats in their opening World Cup fixtures: Canada against South Africa and UAE against New Zealand.Yet, the Canadian camp has been open about what they took from the experience.“It was a good experience. We had two warm-up matches in Italy and one with South Africa. We were trying different combinations in the warm-up matches,” Saad Bin Zafar told TimesofIndia.com on the sidelines of their net session at the Arun Jaitley Stadium on Wednesday.“The game against South Africa was obviously the first game of the World Cup against such a big country. Top nation. So, there were some nerves as well. Now, we had a decent game. So, the nerves have settled down a bit.""For Canada, the UAE clash represents a genuine opening.“So, the UAE game is very important for us. Both are Associate countries. So, it’s an equal opportunity for both to achieve their first win in the World Cup. So, we are taking it very seriously and looking forward to it. Hopefully, we will win and open our points table scorecard,” added Bin Zafar, a 39-year-old all-rounder who wants to use his years of experience during the rest of the campaign.20-year-old Canadian all-rounder Ajayveer Hundal feels that the 57-run defeat to South Africa has only boosted their confidence.“I think the biggest thing for Associate teams, especially, is we’re not exposed to this level of competition all the time,” he said. “This is a pretty similar South African team to the one that went to the final, the previous edition… the biggest thing that people took away from this game was confidence. We faced it once. We know what to expect now. And we’re looking to capitalise on the next.”Ahead of the battle of two Associate nations, Bin Zafar, under whose captaincy Canada regained their ODI status in 2024, reinstates what the Associate nations lack: “The only difference is that we don’t get enough opportunities to play cricket against good countries regularly. We only get that opportunity at the World Cup stage.""We can compete with the Test-playing nations in a better way if we get more opportunities because there is not much difference in skill level.”",UAE take on Canada in Group of Death of ICC Men's T20 World Cup 2026.

England manager Thomas Tuchel signed a new contract on Thursday that will see him remain head coach of the team till the end of Euro 2028.The German was confirmed as the successor to Gareth Southgate in October 2024 and has overseen an unbeaten qualification run to this year's World Cup in North America, with England winning all eight group games.""I am very happy and proud to extend my time with England,"" said the 52-year-old former Chelsea manager in an FA statement.""It is no secret to anyone that I have loved every minute so far of working with my players and coaches, and I cannot wait to lead them to the World Cup.""It is an incredible opportunity and we are going to do our very best to make the country proud,"" added Tuchel, whose previous England deal ran only until the end of this year's global showpiece.The FA said that the new agreement with Tuchel would provide ""clarity and full focus"" amid speculation about his future after the World Cup.However, FA chief executive Mark Bullingham explained there are ""performance conditions"" in the deal.""We tend to want to know where we are, to remove that uncertainty when you're going into a tournament,"" added Bullingham. ""It gives everyone -- the support team and the players -- that certainty.""Tuchel had been touted as a candidate to be the next permanent Manchester United manager.But in signing a new England contract, Tuchel appears to have ruled himself out of a post-World Cup move to Old Trafford.The FA added that Tuchel's senior backroom team had all also agreed contract extensions through to the end of Euro 2028.""I have had so much support from Mark, all my colleagues at the FA and from fans wherever I go that I did not hesitate when asked to continue in this dream job,"" added Tuchel.- 'No better candidate' -Extending his contract ahead of this year's World Cup is a clear sign of the FA's confidence in Tuchel, who is aiming to guide the England men's team to their first major trophy in six decades.""He was the right person for the job when he joined us for the World Cup campaign, and has only strengthened his reputation across the qualifiers...There is simply no better candidate available in world football ,"" said Bullingham.Tuchel, due to attend the Nations League draw in Brussels on Thursday, said in his first interview after succeeding Southgate that he wanted to add a ""second star"" to the England shirt by winning the 2026 World Cup.The only major international tournament won by the England men's team was when they triumphed on home soil at the 1966 World Cup, defeating the then West Germany in a Wembley final.But they twice came close to ending that barren run under Southgate, losing in both the Euro 2020 and 2024 finals.Tuchel's England team eased through qualification, winning all eight matches in a group which also featured Albania, Serbia, Latvia and Andorra.They will face Croatia, Ghana and Panama in their World Cup group.But tougher tests could await in the knockout stages with co-hosts Mexico in line to face England on home ground in the last 16 should Tuchel's men top their group, with a possible quarter-final against five-time world champions Brazil to follow.",Thomas Tuchel signs new contract with England until end of Euro 2028.

'Unfair on both clubs': Bhutia

New Delhi: Churchill Brothers, who had provisionally finished top of the I-League standings last season and were slated to be promoted to the Indian Super League (ISL), will not be part of the top division in the 2025-26 season, the All India Football Federation (AIFF) ruled on Thursday.The decision was taken at the virtual Executive Committee meeting, just two days before the season begins. It was near-unanimously agreed that Churchill Brothers should not be part of the upcoming campaign, considering the preparations for the season were already underway.The Executive Committee meeting was initially set to take place on February 9 but was postponed after a quorum could not be reached.The decision also comes a day after majority of the ISL clubs had written to the AIFF and urged against including Churchill Brothers. They had argued, among multiple reasons, that the league's credibility would be questionable in that case.The situation arose after Churchill were declared provisional winners of the I-League. However, the title was taken away from them after second-placed Inter Kashi were awarded four points following a verdict by the Court of Arbitration of Sport (CAS).Inter Kashi were initially penalised by the AIFF Appeals Committee for fielding an ineligible player, a decision that was overturned after appeal to the sport's highest court.Subsequently, Inter Kashi were declared the I-League champions and promoted to the ISL. They will get their campaign underway away to FC Goa on February 14.Former India captain and current Executive Committee member Bhaichung Bhutia questioned the current 'inexperienced' administration for this mess. He also stated that with the courts deciding champions, it is not fair to either clubs.""Why have this meeting when the league is starting in five days time? That in itself shows the fault in the administration. And you're again having a meeting to decide whether they should be allowed or not! Secondly, why did the situation come here is created by the federation itself,"" said Bhutia, who is part of the 22-member Executive Committee.""They (Churchill Brothers) were completely right in appealing. They were declared winners and given the trophy. All said and done, it is unfair on both Inter Kashi and Churchill. Both the clubs were hard done by the federation and had to spend time, money and energy in going to court.""""When the league champion is decided by the court, either you decide both clubs should not play or you say that until the decision is finalised, we will not allow both to play. When it comes to allowing one and not the other, it becomes very unfair,"" he concluded.","Churchill Brothers will not be part of the Indian Super League in 2025-26.

Soham in action during a match.

Raised in a sports-loving family, Soham Bhagawati’s journey into football began at an early age. Born in Guwahati and raised in Dubai, he grew up surrounded by sporting influence: his father was a tennis player and his grandfather was a footballer. This unwavering family support helped turn a childhood passion into a serious career pursuit. Now based in Spain, the young footballer is steadily building his path towards a potential India debut.Soham moved to Spain about two and a half years ago to improve his football skills and gain exposure at a higher level. At the same time, he is continuing his studies and pursuing a degree in sports management, which helps him learn more about the sport both on and off the field.Soham was called up for trials with the India Under-19 team in 2020, a significant milestone in his career. He considers wearing the Indian jersey a major achievement and a moment of pride, further motivating him to push himself.The 22-year-old currently plays for Terrassa FC, representing the club’s B team in the second division of Catalonia, while the senior team competes in Spain’s fourth division.According to him, football in Spain has helped him grow both technically and mentally, and the competitive environment has been a valuable learning experience.Soham named Brazilian star Neymar as his early inspiration. However, with time and a deeper understanding of the game, he feels that every player brings something different to it. Today, rather than idolising one individual, Soham believes there is something to learn from everyone and focuses on improving by taking lessons from all players he watches and plays alongside.From Indian football, Soham calls Sunil Chhetri “the king” and draws inspiration from his achievements and leadership. He likes FC Barcelona and Argentina’s Boca Juniors, and he dreams of one day representing a club of similar stature through hard work and dedication.He hopes to represent his favourite ISL club, NorthEast United FC, one day. For now, however, his focus is on gaining experience and improving his game.According to Soham, the difference between players from India and Spain is not talent but exposure, which sets them apart. He, though, feels the level of young Indian footballers is steadily improving.""India has talented players and improving facilities, especially with ISL clubs now offering strong infrastructure. However, football does not receive the same level of investment and attention as other sports, which limits growth. Exposure to competitive environments is still the biggest gap,"" Soham told TimesofIndia.com in an exclusive interview.Soham emphasised how crucial the ISL is for Indian football. He said it not only provides young players with much-needed exposure and professional experience but also keeps fans connected to the sport.""The ISL is the main league people associate with football in India in recent years. Without it, the sport loses visibility and structure. Even though the format and wages have changed, it’s good that players are back on the field — playing matches is what matters most for footballers,"" he added.Soham’s short-term goal is to break into his club’s first team, while his long-term aim is to play at a higher professional level in Spain. Representing India at the senior level remains a clear dream — one he believes is achievable through consistent hard work, dedication and belief in his abilities.“Representing India at the senior level is everyone’s dream. For me, it could happen very soon if I keep working hard towards it. Let’s see — it takes effort, but if it happens, it will be a proud moment,” Soham added.Soham is optimistic about the future of Indian football. He believes that, with proper focus and commitment, India has the potential to qualify for the FIFA World Cup.“We already have top-quality players like Sandesh Jhingan, Lallianzuala Chhangte and many more. If we focus well and give everything to it, I believe we can achieve it in the next few years,” he said.Beyond football, Soham is deeply spiritual and credits his faith for keeping him grounded.“I always pray every day and look up to God because He is the one giving us opportunities. We’re truly blessed to have everything we have. There will be bad times, but they always pass. The key is to stay positive, focus on the right things, and always be happy and smile,” he said.",Soham Bhagawati was born in Guwahati and raised in Dubai.

Poll What do you think about FanCode's decision to partner with Sony Sports Network for ISL coverage? Excellent choice, strong market presence. Good, but could have considered other options. Disappointed, preferred a different network. No opinion.

Just over a week after FanCode, owned by Dream Sports, secured the broadcast rights for the truncated 2025–26 Indian Super League (ISL) season, it has sub-licensed the linear TV coverage to Culver Max Entertainment, also known as Sony Pictures Network India (SPNI).Sony Sports Network had attended the pre-bid conference but opted against making a final bid. FanCode eventually acquired the broadcast rights for Rs 8.62 crore.FanCode, which does not have a TV channel of its own, had entered into immediate conversations with multiple providers to showcase India's top division. Besides Sony Sports Network, Zee, DD Sports and regional providers in Kerala and Kolkata were the other considerations.However, the decision to go with Sony Sports was reached because they have an already established strong market base, while Zee is still finding its footing since re-entering the sports broadcast space last year. DD Sports was also probed as an option.While a verbal deal was reached between FanCode and Sony Sports Network, the paperwork and final agreement is in the closing stages at the time of writing.The contribution from Sony Sports will go to the All India Football Federation (AIFF), who are organising the league this season, and will be shared among the ISL clubs.Since acquiring the ISL broadcast rights, FanCode has announced separate structures for the fans to watch the ISL. There's a season pass for Rs 299, a team pass for Rs 149 and a match pass for Rs 25.With FanCode getting the media rights during the bidding process, KPS Studios will handle the world-feed production, acquired at a cost of Rs 5.22 crore.The 14-club league begins on February 14 with defending champions Mohun Bagan Super Giant taking on Kerala Blasters.","FanCode has sub-licensed the TV coverage of the 2025-26 ISL season to Sony Sports Network.

Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel.

It’s white and cold! Cole Palmer covered his ears with his black-gloved hands after his customary ‘brrr’ celebration. Stepping up in Chelsea’s allwhite gear, he had planted the opening penalty against Wolves in the right corner last Saturday before breaking into the familiar pose, and an unfamiliar one.Outside noise? It has been a season interrupted with injuries, and it’s easy for doubts to creep in. There are rumours of ‘homesickness’; for the Manchester boy, who had sharpened his skills at City, and now linked to childhood love United, there was that unsettled feeling too.“Just people talking rubbish,” Palmer told The Times Of India in an interaction facilitated by JioStar. “Honestly it doesn’t bother me.”Letting his boots do the talking, he became the first player in Premier League history to register three 1st-half trebles.His immediate Insta post after delivering the message at Molineux, was captioned “Just enjoy.” Perhaps, it was a note to himself, as he makes sense of a stop-start injury-hit campaign. His words are defiant, though. “No, it doesn’t shake me. Of course I want to perform well, but if things get tough, it doesn’t really affect my confidence too much.”Cole processes praise and criticism in much the same way: “The same people who talk bad about you one minute will call you the best thing after you score. It doesn’t bother me.”That emotional equilibrium has been there for a while. Still only 23, he seems like an old soul amidst the uncertainty of constant shuffle at the heart of Stamford Bridge. He traces that calmness back home. “I think it comes from my dad,” he said. “From a young age, he taught me not to get too high or too low, no matter what.”Despite stepping up to the big league from the City production line, he got his one-way ticket to West London in the autumn of 2023. “I always knew I had the ability. I just needed a platform to show it,” the boy from Wythenshawe chose Chelsea to further his pro-levels of football education.The no-fuss No. 10 has so far collected 51 goals at his present club. There are World Cup ambitions too. But for now, the England international with a grandfather from St Kitts, is dealing with the vagaries of a sporting career.As Liam Rosenior’s Chelsea, in fifth place, host Leeds United in the EPL tonight, Cole finds himself in the starting XI in less than half the games this season, scoring 8 goals in 17 games. “This is something new to me,” Palmer shared with his club website. “I’ve never been injured before. I’ve not played a game this season fully fit. I’ve been overthinking it too.”It’s about managing fitness and expectations. Scoring hat-tricks will certainly amp up the noise, though. Cole Palmer is “just a normal guy like everyone else,” he tells you. But then, he can’t lead a normal life.(CATCH ALL THE ACTION FROM THE PREMIER LEAGUE, LIVE & EXCLUSIVE ON STAR SPORTS NETWORK AND JIOHOTSTAR)",Cole Palmer is the first player in Premier League history to register three 1st- half trebles.

NEW DELHI: Mexican authorities have announced that robot dogs will be deployed to assist police operations during the 2026 FIFA World Cup, as part of enhanced security measures for the tournament.The four-legged robotic units are built to venture into high-risk zones and relay live video footage to law enforcement teams, allowing officers to assess situations remotely before moving in during World Cup-related operations.The month-long global event, scheduled to run from June 11 to July 19, will be jointly hosted by Mexico, the United States and Canada.The robot dogs were purchased by the Guadalupe city council — located in the Monterrey metropolitan region, one of the World Cup host areas — at a cost of 2.5 million pesos (approximately $145,000). Monterrey is set to stage matches at BBVA Stadium, which will be temporarily renamed Estadio Monterrey for the tournament.Footage released by local authorities shows one of the robots navigating an abandoned structure, walking up staircases with measured precision while transmitting real-time visuals back to police officers following at a distance.During the demonstration, the robotic canine confronts an armed individual and uses a built-in loudspeaker to instruct him to drop his weapon, showcasing its role in frontline assessment and de-escalation.Guadalupe mayor Hector Garcia said the robots are intended to assist officers during initial interventions, reducing direct exposure to potential threats. “The objective is to protect the physical integrity of our police,” he said, adding that the machines will be deployed whenever disturbances or confrontations arise.Estadio Monterrey is scheduled to host four World Cup matches during the tournament.","Mexican authorities have announced that robot dogs will be deployed to assist police during the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

New gender violence lawsuit casts fresh shadow over Shannon Sharpe’s ESPN hopes

Shannon Sharpe’s bid to rebuild his television career has hit another serious obstacle. Just days after publicly expressing confidence about returning to ESPN, the Hall of Fame tight end now faces a new lawsuit in New York that could reshape his future in sports media.The complaint was filed by former ESPN producer Michele Evans, who covered the Denver Broncos in the early 2000s. Her legal action comes months after Sharpe reached an out of court settlement in a separate case. At a moment when he appeared focused on clearing his name, this latest filing has placed him back under an intense and uncomfortable spotlight.Michele Evans has brought two claims against Sharpe, one for defamation and another under the New York City Gender Motivated Violence Act. According to court documents, she alleges that a romantic relationship between the two turned violent in September 2010 after she confronted him about alleged infidelity.Her account is graphic and direct. Evans claims Sharpe forcibly restrained her and committed non consensual acts. In the filing, she recounts a chilling line she says he repeated during the assault: ""I'm going to make sure no other man will want you.""By identifying herself publicly as a former colleague in sports media, Evans appears intent on strengthening the credibility of her claims and framing them as part of a broader pattern of behavior.Sharpe’s legal team has responded forcefully. They have labeled the lawsuit an ""opportunistic fabrication"" and argue that it is driven by financial motives rather than fact. His attorneys insist the complaint lacks merit and maintain that Sharpe intends to defend himself vigorously.Still, the timing is difficult to ignore. During Super Bowl weekend, Sharpe said of a potential return to ESPN, ""I am more than willing and more than capable."" Since news of the lawsuit broke, ESPN has declined public comment. The network’s silence speaks loudly in an industry that often moves quickly to protect its brand.For Sharpe, the legal battle now extends beyond the courtroom. It touches reputation, legacy, and the fragile bridge back to mainstream sports television.","Michele Evans has brought two claims against Sharpe, one for defamation and another under the New York City Gender Motivated Violence Act.

Chloe Kim’s Olympic bid falls short as Choi Ga-on ’s final run seals the upset



Chloe Kim stood on the halfpipe in Italy chasing history, aware of what a third straight Olympic gold would mean. No snowboarder had ever done it. For two runs, it felt close enough to touch. The air was crisp, the crowd loud, and her first score hinted at another coronation. Then, in a matter of seconds, the script flipped. A teenager from South Korea delivered the ride of her life, and Kim’s golden streak slipped away.High above the pipe, one familiar face tracked every move. Myles Garrett had crossed continents to be there. Days removed from winning the NFL ’s Defensive Player of the Year award after a record 23-sack season, he traded a football stage for a snowy one. He arrived too late for the awards night in San Francisco to celebrate with Kim, but in Italy, he made sure she would not compete alone.Kim entered the Milano Cortina Games as the reigning queen of women’s halfpipe. The Korean-American star from Torrance had already claimed gold in Pyeongchang at 17 and again in Beijing, becoming the first woman to win the event twice. A third title would have set her apart in Olympic history.Her opening run in Thursday’s final carried the polish of a champion. Clean landings. Confident amplitude. The kind of execution that usually forces the field to chase. Afterward, she found Garrett near the barricade. They hugged. They kissed. For a moment, it felt settled.Garrett, 6-foot-4 and unmistakable in a custom Winter Olympics jacket printed with Kim’s face, had already drawn attention during qualifying. He posed for photos, cheered from the sidelines, and looked every bit the proud partner. The image of him in full fan mode spread quickly online.But sport rarely honors sentiment.Seventeen-year-old Choi Ga-on attacked her final run with fearless precision. Her 90.25 edged Kim’s 88.0 after the American fell on her last attempt, trying to reclaim the top spot. The upset stunned the crowd. It also sparked predictable noise online, where some fans jokingly blamed Garrett and the Browns curse for the result.Kim’s resume remains unmatched. Two Olympic gold medals. A generation inspired. A presence that extends beyond medals, now including a public relationship that first surfaced at the Crunchyroll Anime Awards in Tokyo and later at an NFL game this season.On this night, history belonged to someone else. Kim skated off without the third gold, but not without perspective. Greatness does not disappear in a single run.

“Never underestimate the Swifties”: The Traitors producers reveal why contestants feared crossing Donna Kelce,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/never-underestimate-the-swifties-the-traitors-producers-reveal-why-contestants-feared-crossing-donna-kelce/articleshow/128279495.cms,"The Traitors producers admitted they misjudged the influence of Taylor Swift’s fanbase after casting Donna Kelce as the show’s first Secret Traitor. While the twist added fun and intrigue, contestants became wary of eliminating her, fearing Swifties’ reaction. Quotes from producers reveal how the fanbase subtly shifted gameplay. Donna’s short stint highlighted how celebrity connections can impact strategy inside competitive reality television.

The Traitors producers admit they underestimated Swifties’ impact on Donna Kelce twist

Donna Kelce’s brief stay inside the Scottish castle turned out to be far more influential than anyone behind the scenes predicted. When The Traitors cast the mother of Travis Kelce, producers knew Taylor Swift ’s fanbase would tune in out of curiosity. What they did not see coming was how that fanbase would quietly shape the psychology of the game itself.Season four, which premiered Jan. 8, introduced Donna as the show’s first-ever Secret Traitor. She lasted only three episodes before her elimination, but by then, the ripple effects were clear. Contestants were not just playing for prize money. They were weighing how millions of Swifties might react to every vote.Executive producer Rosie Franks revealed to Variety that Donna’s casting was rooted in strategy and tone, not spectacle. “She really did want to play,” Franks said. “She came with so much strategy.” The idea of placing Taylor Swift’s future mother-in-law in a red cloak added a playful edge to the series.“And then the idea of having Taylor Swift’s future mother-in-law wandering around the castle secretly in a red cloak, there’s nothing more camp than that,” Franks added. “So we felt like that really would lean into the tone of The Traitors.”The twist worked creatively. It also created unintended tension among players. Co-executive producer Sam Rees-Jones admitted, “We never thought the players would be scared of the Swiftes, but maybe we underestimated the Swifties.” Franks echoed the sentiment with a laugh, “Never underestimate the Swifties.”Inside the castle, that fear was not subtle. As Dorinda Medley joked during one episode, “No one’s gonna murder [Donna] — the Swifties will kill you.” It was said in humor, but the hesitation felt real. Voting out Donna carried more weight than a standard elimination.Donna embraced the moment while it lasted. At one point she quoted Swift’s Midnights track “Vigilante Shit,” saying, “Don’t get mad, get even.” Her run may have been short, yet it proved how pop culture can alter competitive instincts in unexpected ways.With her exit, the season moved on. But the lesson remains. Casting a figure tied to global fame does more than draw viewers. It changes how players think, vote, and survive.","The Traitors producers admitted they misjudged the influence of Taylor Swift’s fanbase after casting Donna Kelce.

“American culture will not be mocked or corrupted”: Super Bowl LX halftime show controversy grows as GOP targets NFL broadcast,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/american-culture-will-not-be-mocked-or-corrupted-super-bowl-lx-halftime-show-controversy-grows-as-gop-targets-nfl-broadcast/articleshow/128255574.cms,"Bad Bunny’s Super Bowl halftime performance has drawn sharp criticism from Republican lawmakers, including Rep. Andy Ogles and Rep. Mark Alford, who are calling for a congressional inquiry into the NFL and NBC. They labeled the show inappropriate for public broadcast. Former President Donald Trump also condemned the performance. Despite the backlash, the halftime show attracted over 128 million viewers, fueling debate over artistic expression and broadcast standards.

Why Republicans are calling for an inquiry into Bad Bunny’s Super Bowl halftime show

Bad Bunny’s Super Bowl halftime show was always going to spark conversation. What few expected was a political firestorm that would follow within days. The performance, watched by more than 128 million viewers, quickly shifted from a pop culture moment to a talking point inside Capitol Hill. Several Republican lawmakers have publicly criticized the set, arguing it crossed a line for network television during one of the most watched events of the year.The NFL and its broadcast partner NBC now find themselves pulled into that debate. While many fans praised the production value and star power, others focused on choreography and presentation. For some lawmakers, that focus has turned into formal action.Rep. Andy Ogles of Tennessee has formally requested a congressional inquiry into the NFL and NBC. In a letter to the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Ogles described the performance as “pure smut” and argued it included “overtly s*****lized movements, including widespread twerking, grinding, pelvic thrusts and other s**ually suggestive conduct.”He urged the Committee to examine whether the content was appropriate for public airwaves, adding that “American culture will not be mocked or corrupted without consequence.”Rep. Mark Alford echoed those concerns and compared the show to the 2004 Janet Jackson wardrobe malfunction, suggesting this year’s halftime display could be even more troubling. Alford also noted that he and colleagues have initiated an investigation into the broadcast.President Donald Trump also gave a comment, describing the show as being ""absolutely terrible, one of the worst, EVER!"" and “an affront to the Greatness of America."" His remarks increased a heated debate that was already burning online.Notwithstanding the backlash, the number of viewers speaks a different story. The halftime entertainment attracted a huge crowd and it serves as an indication of the size of the event and the popularity of Bad Bunny on the global stage. In the case of NFL, the incident highlights the fine line between entertainment and expectations of the people.Investigations now enter the committee arena where the larger issue is bound to be on standards, precedent and the presence of live entertainment as a component of prime time coverage.","Rep.

Insiders claim Brady was shaken, pointing to emotional social media posts that followed the news. While Bündchen moves ahead quietly, Brady’s reaction has sparked debate about whether he has truly accepted the end of their marriage.

Why Gisele Bündchen’s reported marriage and Tom Brady’s reaction reignited old questions

Tom Brady did not need a football to command attention on Super Bowl weekend. A short clip from a private party in San Francisco was enough. The seven time champion was seen dancing closely with influencer Alix Earle, and within hours the internet had drawn its own conclusions. The timing made it louder. Reports had just surfaced that Gisele Bündchen quietly married her jiu jitsu instructor Joaquim Valente, a development that clearly struck a nerve in Brady’s world.For years, Brady and Bündchen represented a rare mix of sports dominance and fashion royalty. Their 2022 divorce felt final, at least publicly. Yet the latest wave of headlines suggests the emotional residue never fully faded. As Bündchen moves forward with a new chapter, Brady’s reaction has become part of the story, and fans are reading every post, every appearance, for clues.RadarOnline.com reported that Brady was “shaken” when he learned of the ceremony. Soon after, he shared an Instagram story describing himself as “forever young,” paired with Logic’s 2017 track “1-800-273-8255.” The song’s heavy themes caught attention immediately.Friends close to the former quarterback reportedly found the choice unusual.One insider said, ""Tom swears he's totally accepted Gisele moving on, but his actions tell a very different story."" The concern deepened when Brady posted another somber track the following day.""It's pretty clear he's having a big reaction. The next day, he posted another sad song, so it's understandable that people close to him are worried,"" the insider added. Another remark stood out: ""He really thought this was just a phase. He genuinely thought she'd come back to him.""Bundchen, on her part has remained silent. She is a self-sufficient person who has constructed her life outside the NFL limelight, with family and personal development. Brady has also attempted to portray a cool-headed person, juggling between business and the world. However, the scenes like these help the fans to remember that even icons struggle with personal change.The headlines of super bowls are typically based on touchdowns and legacies. The more enduring theme this year might be closure, acceptance and the in-betweenness of openness and intimacy.","Tom Brady’s appearance with Alix Earle during Super Bowl weekend reignited speculation.

Sources say Swift feels exposed and frustrated, insisting she was only supporting a friend. The situation has also drawn attention to Travis Kelce, who has remained a steady presence as Swift navigates the fallout.

How and why Taylor Swift was pulled into Blake Lively’s lawsuit drama

Private conversations rarely stay private in today’s celebrity landscape. Taylor Swift learned that the hard way when court documents tied to Blake Lively ’s legal battle with Justin Baldoni made her personal texts public. What began as a dispute between Lively and her It Ends With Us director quickly spilled into Swift’s orbit, dragging her name into headlines she never sought. The development has also placed fresh attention on Travis Kelce , whose relationship with Swift continues to invite scrutiny from every corner of the internet.For Swift, the issue is less about publicity and more about principle. Friends say the exposure cut deeper than expected. The timing only heightened curiosity, with fans already dissecting her every public move alongside Kelce. Instead of music or football highlights, the conversation shifted to courtroom filings and private loyalty.The controversy stems from texts exchanged between Swift and Lively during the actress’s dispute with Baldoni. According to a source, “It’s honestly been really hard for Taylor. Having her texts out there made her feel exposed and kind of violated, like, something private suddenly wasn’t hers anymore. That doesn’t sit well with her.” Swift had reportedly been offering support to a close friend, not plotting strategy.In one message, Lively asked, “Can you do me a huge favor. I need help with him.” Swift replied that she would “do anything.” Another exchange captured Lively praising her: “You were so epically heroic today.” Swift answered, “I WON THE LOTTERY. You are the COOLEST PERSON IN THE WORLD and you like me!!”A second insider insisted Swift “wasn’t trying to get involved or make anything bigger, she was just supporting Blake as a friend, in what she thought was a private moment.” The same source added she is “obviously not happy” about being pulled into the dispute.Kelce has not commented publicly, but those close to the couple say he has remained steady as Swift manages the storm. His presence has offered quiet support while she balances music, public life and unexpected legal headlines.The episode underscores how quickly personal loyalty can become public record. Swift may be used to stadium lights, but this spotlight feels different.","Swift feels exposed and frustrated, insisting she was only supporting a friend.

to the lineup when theface the Dallas Mavericks tonight. The veteran forward missed the team’s last game but is no longer listed on the injury report, indicating he is available to play.The 41-year-old had been dealing with arthritis in his left foot. His absence earlier this week appeared to be a rest decision rather than a serious setback, and the latest update suggests the condition is being managed.LeBron James did not play in Tuesday’s 136-108 loss to the San Antonio Spurs. The Lakers were on the second night of a back-to-back and chose to sit him as a precaution.Following the game, the team removed him from the injury report. Unless something changes before tip-off, he is likely to return to his normal workload, which typically falls in the 30-35 minute range.The Los Angeles Lakers are expected to start Marcus Smart, Jake LaRavia, Rui Hachimura, LeBron James, and Deandre Ayton. Much of the offense runs through James, especially in late-game situations where his decision-making becomes central.James has played 35 games this season and is averaging about 21 points, 6 assists, 5.7 rebounds, and 1.1 steals per game.His presence usually brings structure to the offense, particularly in half-court possessions.• Guards: Marcus Smart, Austin Reaves, Luke Kennard, Bronny James, Nick Smith Jr., Chris Manon, Kobe Bufkin• Forwards: LeBron James, Rui Hachimura, Jake LaRavia, Dalton Knecht, Jarred Vanderbilt, Drew Timme, Adou Thiero• Centers: Deandre Ayton, Jaxson Hayes• Head Coach: JJ RedickThe roster has changed during the season and is now built around a core of LeBron, Luka Doncic, and Ayton, with players such as Smart, Reaves, and Hachimura filling key supporting roles.Dallas will be without Luka Doncic, who is expected to miss his fourth straight game because of a hamstring strain. Kyrie Irving also remains out after knee surgery.The projected starting lineup includes Max Christie, Tyus Jones, Naji Marshall, P.J. Washington, and Daniel Gafford. Without their top scorers, the Mavericks may rely more on defense and balanced scoring.With Doncic unavailable, the Lakers can focus more defensive attention on Washington and Gafford inside. On offense, James is expected to handle much of the playmaking, including pick-and-roll actions and early offense.Los Angeles leads the season series 2-0, winning 129-119 on November 28, 2025, and 116-110 on January 24, 2026.

How the injuries shape the game

Thewhen they face the Los Angeles Lakers tonight at Crypto.com Arena. The team confirmed that Flagg has a left midfoot sprain and will not play in the final game before the 2026 NBA All-Star break.Flagg left Tuesday’s game in Phoenix early, which led to further testing. An MRI later revealed the sprain, and Dallas quickly ruled him out rather than risk making the injury worse.Dallas Mavericks announced on Feb. 12 thatand the Castrol Rising Stars event during All-Star Weekend. The move keeps him off the court through the break as the team focuses on recovery.The Mavericks are targeting a return when the regular season resumes around Feb. 20. He is currently listed as out, not day-to-day, so there was never a real expectation that he would play against Los Angeles.Dallas Mavericks enter the matchup with a 19-34 record and is just outside the play-in race. The team has also lost eight straight games.Flagg has been their most productive player this season, averaging over 20 points along with more than six rebounds and four assists per game.At 19, he has taken on a leading role and is widely seen as the early favorite for Rookie of the Year.With Flagg unavailable, head coach Jason Kidd will rely more on Kyrie Irving to run the offense. Klay Thompson, P.J. Washington, and Naji Marshall are expected to take on larger scoring roles, while younger guards Miles Kelly and Ryan Nembhard could see more minutes.Dallas is listed as a road underdog, and Flagg’s absence is a major reason for the betting line.The Lakers are otherwise healthy. LeBron James, Austin Reaves, Marcus Smart, Rui Hachimura, Drew Timme, and Jarred Vanderbilt are all expected to play, giving Los Angeles most of its regular rotation.Both teams will be missing key players. Dallas loses its main ball handler and one of its best defenders, while the Lakers will be without an important playmaker.The Mavericks are likely to lean on Irving in pick-and-roll situations and depend on outside shooting from Thompson and Khris Middleton. The Lakers should look to attack inside with LeBron and Timme and push the pace when chances appear.Also read: Is Luka Doncic playing tonight vs the Dallas Mavericks?

Lakers Likely to Share the Offensive Load

Mavericks Also Dealing With Injuries

When is Luka Doncic likely to return for the Los Angeles Lakers?

when theface the Dallas Mavericks on Thursday, February 12, 2026. The team has ruled him out with a left hamstring strain, marking his fourth straight missed game.The contest is the final game for both teams before the eight-day All-Star break. Many expected Doncic to feature against his former team, but the Lakers have decided not to rush his recovery.Luka Doncic suffered the injury on February 6 during a game against the Philadelphia 76ers. He left in the second quarter after experiencing soreness in his left leg, and the issue was later confirmed as a hamstring strain.He has since missed multiple games, including a matchup against the San Antonio Spurs. The Lakers’ medical staff has opted for caution as the guard works his way back.The injury report also lists center Deandre Ayton as questionable with a separate issue, leaving the Lakers with some uncertainty in the frontcourt.Even without Luka Doncic, the result matters for both teams heading into the All-Star pause.Dallas enters the game with an 18-26 record, fourth in the Southwest Division, and has a chance to close the gap in the standings.The Lakers are 32-21 and lead the Pacific Division, so a win would help them maintain their position in the Western Conference playoff race.The Los Angeles Lakers are also trying to stop a short losing streak before the break.With their top scorer unavailable, the Lakers are expected to rely more on Austin Reaves and LeBron James to run the offense. The projected starters, Jake LaRavia, Rui Hachimura, Jaxson Hayes, Luke Kennard, and Kobe Bufkin, have already played together during Doncic’s absence.Reaves and James should handle most of the playmaking, while guards Bronny James, Nick Smith Jr., and Marcus Smart could see more minutes. Managing LeBron’s workload will be important as the 41-year-old continues to log heavy playing time.Dallas will be without Kyrie Irving, who has been ruled out because of a knee problem. Caleb Martin, Cooper Flagg, and Naji Marshall are listed as game-time decisions due to foot and ankle injuries.The Mavericks may lean on a younger backcourt that includes D’Angelo Russell, Jaden Hardy, and Ryan Nembhard. P.J. Washington is expected to play a key role in the frontcourt.With the Lakers missing their main playmaker, Dallas has a chance to pick up a road win before the break.The Los Angeles Lakers have described Doncic as day-to-day and have not given a firm return date. There is still hope he could appear during All-Star Weekend in Los Angeles.Doncic has dealt with several injuries this season, including hamstring, ankle, groin, and leg issues. The team appears focused on protecting his long-term health rather than pushing him back too soon.Also read: Dallas Mavericks vs Los Angeles Lakers injury report: Who's playing, injured and questionable players, head-to-head records, team stats, and more (February 12, 2026) For now, the situation is simple: Luka Doncic will not play against the Mavericks.","Luka Doncic will not play against the Dallas Mavericks on Thursday, February 12, 2026.

Kyle Kuzma and Ryan Rollins are listed as questionable.This is Giannis Antetokounmpo’s second calf strain of the season after a similar issue sidelined him for several weeks in December. Head coach Doc Rivers has said there is no set timetable beyond the four-to-six-week recovery window discussed after the January MRI.The Bucks appear to be using the All-Star break to allow more recovery time, with the aim of bringing him back for the final stretch without risking another injury.Also read: Is Shai Gilgeous-Alexander playing tonight vs the Milwaukee Bucks?

Oklahoma City Thunder vs Milwaukee Bucks Game outlook without both stars (February 12, 2026)

Oklahoma City Thunder vs Milwaukee Bucks Fantasy and betting impact (February 12, 2026)

Thewhen they take on the Milwaukee Bucks at Paycom Center on. The official NBA injury report lists the guard as out with an abdominal strain, extending his absence to five games.The team has already ruled him out through the All-Star break, so there is no chance of a late return for this matchup. Fans expecting to see the reigning MVP on the floor will have to wait until the Thunder resume play after the break.The afternoon report for the 7:30 p.m. ET game clearly marks Shai Gilgeous-Alexander as “Out” because of the abdominal injury. He will not take part in shootaround, warmups, or any game activity.Recent coverage of the Thunder also points to a recovery timeline that keeps him sidelined at least through All-Star weekend.Gilgeous-Alexander has been the center of Oklahoma City Thunder’s offense this season. He is averaging about 31-32 points, 6-7 assists, and just under five rebounds per game while shooting around 55 percent from the field and close to 40 percent from three.With him unavailable, more responsibility shifts to Cason Wallace, Isaiah Joe, and Ousmane Dieng.The Thunder will need steady ball movement and efficient half-court sets against a Milwaukee defense built around Myles Turner inside.The Bucks will also be missing Giannis Antetokounmpo, which removes a major presence from their lineup as well.Oklahoma City enters the night at 42-13 with a strong 22-5 home record. Milwaukee is 22-30 overall and 10-18 on the road. Even without Gilgeous-Alexander, the Thunder remain a clear favorite because of their depth and the Bucks’ injuries, including Giannis and Taurean Prince following neck surgery.Expect Oklahoma City to play at a quicker pace and rely on passing to create open shots. Wallace and Topic could handle more of the offense, while Joe and Dieng provide spacing. Milwaukee is likely to work through Turner and Portis in the paint and look for scoring from its perimeter players.Removing a player who regularly scores more than 30 points changes Oklahoma City’s scoring outlook. Teammates may see higher usage, but the offense is less predictable without its primary option.Oddsmakers still have the Thunder as a double-digit favorite. The projected total has dipped slightly compared to games in which both Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Giannis Antetokounmpo were healthy.Shai Gilgeous-Alexander is not playing against the Bucks tonight. He remains out with an abdominal strain and is expected to stay sidelined through the All-Star break.Also read: Milwaukee Bucks vs Oklahoma City Thunder injury report: Who's playing, injured and questionable players, head-to-head records, team stats, and more (February 12, 2026) The Thunder will again rely on their rotation to cover his production, making this game another test of the team’s depth.","The official NBA injury report lists the guard as out with an abdominal strain, extending his absence to five games.

Milwaukee Bucks vs Oklahoma City Thunder Betting outlook (February 12, 2026)

Theon, for a game shaped heavily by injuries. Both teams will be without their MVPs, forcing coaches to depend on supporting players and adjusted rotations.Oklahoma City enters as the defending champion and a strong favorite, while Milwaukee is trying to stay competitive in the Eastern Conference race. With several starters unavailable on both sides, this matchup is likely to be decided by execution rather than star performances.All statuses are based on the official NBA injury report released ahead of the 7:30 p.m. ET start.• Giannis Antetokounmpo (F) - Out: Right calf strain; not expected back before February 20. His absence removes the team’s main scorer and defensive presence.• Taurean Prince (F) - Out: Recovering from neck surgery and projected to remain out until at least February 20. Milwaukee loses an experienced wing.• Kyle Kuzma (F) - Questionable: Left foot soreness; game-time decision. If he cannot play, Bobby Portis and Myles Turner will likely handle more minutes.• Ryan Rollins (G) - Questionable: Right foot plantar fasciitis.As the team’s leading scorer, his availability will affect ball-handling and shot creation.• Alex Antetokounmpo (G/F, two-way) - Out: Assigned to the G League and not active.- Guards: Kevin Porter Jr., AJ Green- Wings: Jericho Sims (if available), Sam Merrill or other guards- Frontcourt: Bobby Portis, Myles Turner, with Sims or another big covering center minutes.• Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (G) - Out: Abdominal strain; expected back no earlier than February 20.• Isaiah Hartenstein (C) - Out: Right soleus injury. His absence should lead to more minutes for Chet Holmgren at center.• Ajay Mitchell (G) - Out: Abdominal strain and left ankle sprain reduce backcourt depth.• Jalen Williams (F) - Out: Right hamstring strain sidelines a key two-way player.• Branden Carlson (C/F) - Out: Low-back spasms affect the team’s interior rotation.• Thomas Sorber (C) - Out: Recovering from ACL surgery and not expected back this season.- Guards: Cason Wallace, Isaiah Joe, Alex Caruso- Wings: Luguentz Dort, Aaron Wiggins- Frontcourt: Chet Holmgren at center, with smaller lineups filling the rotation.The Thunder won the first meeting on January 21, beating the Bucks 122-102. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander scored 40 points, while Giannis Antetokounmpo finished with 19. Oklahoma City shot over 48% from the field, made 36% of its three-point attempts, outrebounded Milwaukee, and forced more turnovers.This is the second meeting of the season. Oklahoma City is looking for a sweep, while Milwaukee hopes to avoid a third straight loss to the Thunder dating back to last year’s playoffs.The Thunder lead the Western Conference, while the Bucks remain in the middle of the Eastern playoff race and are trying to avoid the play-in.Oklahoma City ranks among the league’s top scoring teams and continues to defend well by forcing turnovers and protecting the rim. Milwaukee shoots efficiently, especially from three-point range at 39.2%, but has allowed 115.6 points per game and struggled defensively in transition.Milwaukee may rely on Rollins if he plays, with Porter Jr. and Portis expected to contribute more offense. For Oklahoma City, Holmgren is likely to take on a larger scoring role, while Wallace, Joe, and Dort handle additional attempts.Turner provides rim protection and outside shooting from the center position. Holmgren’s size and mobility could create matchup problems if Milwaukee does not provide help defense.The Thunder lead the league in steals and convert turnovers into fast-break points. Milwaukee must limit mistakes to keep the game close.• Spread: Thunder favored by about -13• Moneyline: Milwaukee around +475• Total: Near 214.5Oklahoma City still has more depth despite missing several players. Milwaukee is without Giannis, Prince, and possibly Rollins and Kuzma, making consistency harder to maintain.The game will likely depend on Holmgren’s expanded role, Rollins’ availability, and Milwaukee’s ability to protect the ball. Even without the biggest names on the floor, the result could show how well each team handles adversity.","Oklahoma City enters as the defending champion and a strong favorite, while Milwaukee is trying to stay competitive in the Eastern Conference race.

With several starters unavailable on both sides, this matchup is likely to be decided by execution rather than star performances.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128278762,imgsize-312392,width-400,resizemode-4/bucks-vs-thunder-in-a-game.jpg"

Why Kylie still remembers it

No sign Dwyane Wade knows about it

Why the story caught attention

A small moment that lasted years

recently shared a story from her wedding day that has followed her for years. Even though what happened was brief and uneventful, she never forgot it. After talking about it on her podcast in early 2026, the moment quickly drew attention online.The story stood out because it centers on a small social interaction most people would expect to forget. Instead, Kylie remembered it for nearly eight years and now treats it as a long-running joke, one that the other person likely knows nothing about.On the Thursday, February 12, 2026 episode of her podcast Not Gonna Lie, Kylie said her issue with Dwyane Wade began just before she walked down the aisle in Philadelphia in 2018.She stepped into an elevator wearing her wedding dress and veil. Four bridesmaids and her wedding planner were with her. Wade entered the elevator as well, but no one spoke during the ride.“It’s a bride and her bridesmaids in the f***ing elevator with you,” she said. “You are in an enclosed space. And then he didn’t say a word.”Kylie said the silence caught her off guard. She expected at least a quick congratulations or some acknowledgment of the situation.Kylie admitted she has held onto the moment even though it was minor. She joked that she has a “long-standing beef with Dwyane Wade that he actually knows nothing about,” making it clear the feud is not real.Her bridesmaid Amber added that Wade was probably just waiting for the doors to close so he would not have to interact with a large wedding group. The comment helped turn the story into a widely shared clip, with many people finding the situation relatable while others saw the humor in holding a grudge over such a small moment.There is nothing to suggest Dwyane Wade has heard the story or remembers the elevator ride. The two have not been publicly linked since that day, and there are no known interactions between them or their spouses.Wade retired after the 2018–19 NBA season and has since focused on business, media work, and advocacy. He still appears at major events. In 2023, he posed for photos with Kylie’s brother-in-law Travis Kelce at the ESPYs, a detail that adds to the joke, since he seemed comfortable around the extended family without knowing about Kylie’s complaint.Stories like this travel quickly because they are easy to understand. It is about expectations of basic politeness and how small moments can stay with someone longer than expected.Kylie Kelce also approached the story with humor, openly admitting the grudge is hers alone. Known for speaking plainly about her life with Jason Kelce and their family, she presented the memory as something to laugh about rather than a serious issue.In the end, the story is simple. A bride expected a short “congrats,” did not get one, and never forgot it.Also read: “Best Birthday Ever”: Megan Thee Stallion’s surprise-filled weekend leaves Dallas Mavericks Klay Thompson on ‘Cloud East 99’ For Kylie, it became a private joke that she eventually shared with listeners.

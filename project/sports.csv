EXCLUSIVE: Nitish Kumar Reddy ruled out of England Test series

Former Pakistan captain Shahid Afridi has launched a scathing attack on Indian players for pulling out of the match a day before the World Championship of Legends (WCL) clash between the two countries.""We are here to play cricket, and I've always said that cricket should be kept away from politics — it should move forward. A player should be a good ambassador, not a source of embarrassment for their country,"" Afridi told reporters.The second edition of the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) tournament, which is co-owned by Bollywood star Ajay Devgn, started on June 18 at Edgbaston and is scheduled to conclude with the final on August 2.World Cup winner Yuvraj Singh is the captain of the India Champions, while the squad also features the likes of Dhawan, Harbhajan Singh, Yusuf Pathan, Irfan Pathan, Suresh Raina, Robin Uthappa, and Varun Aaron, among others.The Pakistan team has in its ranks captain Shahid Afridi, Younis Khan, Sohail Tanvir, Wahab Riaz, Kamran Akmal, among a host of yesteryear players.""We've come here to play cricket. If [India] didn’t want to play against Pakistan, they should’ve refused before coming here.But now you've arrived, even held practice sessions, and then suddenly changed everything in a single day,"" said Afridi.Former India opener Dhawan also shared a statement on X, announcing his stand not to participate in the match against Pakistan.""This is to formally reiterate and confirm that Mr. Shikhar Dhawan will not be participating in any matches against the Pakistan team in the upcoming WCL League. This decision was communicated earlier during our discussion on call and WhatsApp dated 11th May 2025,"" read his statement.Dhawan made it clear that he has taken the call in view of the current ""geopolitical"" situation between India and Pakistan in the aftermath of the Pahalgam terror attack and the ensuing Operation Sindoor carried out by the country.Afridi, without taking any names, lambasted one cricketer and called him a ""bad egg.""""Sports bring people closer, but if politics gets involved in everything, how will we move forward? Until we sit together and discuss issues, nothing will improve — lack of communication only makes things worse,"" he said.""We've come here to play cricket, to have one-on-one interactions and friendly conversations. But sometimes, there's one bad egg that spoils everything for everyone else.""""If I had known the match was being stopped because of me, I wouldn't have even gone to the ground. But cricket should go on. What is Shahid Afridi in front of cricket? Nothing,"" he said.""The game comes first. As a sport, cricket is the biggest thing. Bringing politics into it, or an Indian cricketer saying he won't play against Pakistan — then don't play, just sit out. But sport is bigger, cricket is bigger, and it's bigger than Shahid Afridi too,"" added Afridi.Off-spin legend Harbhajan, a sitting Rajya Sabha MP, Yusuf, who is also a Member of Parliament, and Irfan too have conveyed their decision to boycott the match against Pakistan, though they are yet to issue a statement in this regard.The players received a lot of flak on social media for agreeing to play against the Pakistan team.India had defeated Pakistan by five wickets to win the inaugural edition of the six-team legends tournament last year at Edgbaston.",Former Pakistan captain Shahid Afridi has launched a scathing attack on Indian players for pulling out of the match.

EXCLUSIVE: Nitish Kumar Reddy ruled out of England Test series

In a massive blow to the Indian cricket team, Nitish Kumar Reddy has been ruled out of the ongoing Test series vs England. It is understood that the all-rounder travelled with the team to Manchester but didn’t take part in the optional training session at Old Trafford on Sunday.The exact details of his injury are not known at the moment, but it is reliably learnt that he injured his knee and has sustained some damage to his ligaments.There is no word yet from the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) on the all-rounder, and the story will be updated once an official statement is released. The injury adds to India’s concerns ahead of the fourth Test in Manchester, as the side will have to find the right XI before the fixture, which starts on July 23.Akash Deep is unlikely, Arshdeep Singh has stitches on his bowling hand, and now Nitish is out of the series.While Anshul Kamboj has linked up with the squad in Manchester, India need to figure out the right balance, as they have Shardul Thakur, Prasidh Krishna, and Kuldeep Yadav as options to pick from.India’s preparation for the crucial fourth Test against England at Old Trafford got underway in Manchester on a rainy note, with overcast skies forcing the team indoors for a closed-door session.The first training session of the week was optional, and several key players, including Reddy, did not participate.As reported by TimesofIndia.com earlier, six players — India captain Shubman Gill, KL Rahul, Jasprit Bumrah, Rishabh Pant, Washington Sundar, and Reddy — skipped the indoor nets.Despite persistent rain, the rest of the squad arrived at Old Trafford around 1 PM local time. With media access restricted and no official visuals released, the session took place entirely behind closed doors.Before hitting the nets, the Indian team had a crossover of sorts as they met several Manchester United players at their training facility. Interestingly, Reddy wasn’t present for the meet and greet.","Nitish Kumar Reddy has been ruled out of the Test series against England.

Former India off-spinner Harbhajan Singh revealed an emotional conversation with the daughter of his former teammate S Sreesanth Harbhajan opened up about how he was left shattered after she told him that she didn't want to talk to him because he had hit her father during the 2008 edition of the IPL. Harbhajan, playing for Mumbai Indians , had slapped Kings XI Punjab’s (now Punjab Kings) Sreesanth at the end of a match.“One thing I’d want to change in my life is that incident with Sreesanth. I want to remove that incident from my career,” Harbhajan said while speaking on R Ashwin’s YouTube show Kutti Stories.“That is the incident I would change from my list. What transpired was wrong, and I shouldn’t have done what I did. I apologised 200 times.“What I felt so bad about was that even years after that incident, I have been apologising every opportunity or stage I get. It was a mistake. We all make mistakes, and we hope and try never to repeat such mistakes.“He was my teammate, and we were playing together. Yes, in that game we were opponents. But it shouldn’t have gone to the level where we behaved in such a manner.“So yeah, that was my fault, and the only fault of his was that he provoked me — but that’s okay, actually. However, what I did was not okay. I said, ‘Sorry’,” Harbhajan said.“What hurt me even more, years later, was when I met his daughter.I was talking to her with a lot of love, and she said, ‘I don’t want to talk to you. You hit my father.’ My heart was shattered, and I was on the verge of tears.“I kept asking myself — what kind of impression have I left on her? She must be thinking of me in a poor light, right? She sees me as the guy who hit her father.“I felt so bad. I still apologise to his daughter, knowing I can’t undo what happened. I keep telling her, ‘If there’s anything I can do to make you feel better, or make you think I’m not that kind of person, please tell me.’“I just hope that when she grows up, she doesn’t see me in the same light. I hope she sees that her uncle is someone who will always be there for her and support her in any way he can.

Vaibhav Suryavanshi, aged 14, has etched his name in cricket history by becoming the first player to score a half-century and take a wicket in the same Youth Test match before turning 15, during the ongoing series against England.Suryavanshi's remarkable achievement surpassed the previous record held by Bangladesh's Mehidy Hasan Miraz, who accomplished this feat at 15 years and 167 days against Sri Lanka in Mirpur in 2013. Former India cricketer Suresh Raina also achieved this milestone at 15 years and 242 days against England in Colombo in 2002.In the opening Youth Test, Suryavanshi displayed his all-round capabilities despite a modest start. He scored 14 runs in the first innings before being dismissed but made a strong comeback in the second innings with a quick-fire 56 runs off 44 deliveries. His left-arm spin bowling yielded two wickets in the first innings.The match saw India posting a substantial first-innings total of 540, with captain Ayush Mhatre scoring a century. Vihaan Malhotra, Abhigyan Kundu, Rahul Kumar, and RS Ambrish contributed with half-centuries.England's Alex Green and Ralphie Albert claimed three wickets each.England responded with 439 runs in their first innings, with Rocky Flintoff top-scoring at 93. India's Henil Patel picked up three wickets in the innings.In their second innings, India were bowled out for 248, with Malhotra leading the scoring with 63 runs. England's Archie Vaughan impressed with a six-wicket haul.Chasing 350 for victory, England managed to reach 270 for 7 when the match concluded in a draw. England's captain Hamza Shaikh scored a century during the chase.Suryavanshi's performance also saw him collect another distinction as the youngest player to score multiple half-centuries in international U-19 cricket in the Test format.The second Youth Test of the series is scheduled to begin on Sunday, July 20, at Chelmsford, where Suryavanshi will have another opportunity to showcase his talents.","Vaibhav Suryavanshi is the first player to score a half-century and take a wicket in the same Youth Test match before turning 15.

Poll What aspect of Shubman Gill's performance is most crucial for India's success in the fourth Test? Batting performance Captaincy and leadership Fielding and tactics

India may have lost the third Test at Lord’s in a tight finish, but the team remains hopeful ahead of the fourth match at Old Trafford, starting July 23. A key figure under focus is captain Shubman Gill , who has impressed with both the bat and his leadership.Despite a quiet outing at Lord’s, where he scored just 16 and 6, former India cricketer Sanjay Manjrekar feels Gill has what it takes to bounce back in Manchester.Looking back at Gill's display in the previous Test, Manjrekar said, ""His role is important, but India will also reflect on the fact that in the third Test match at Lord's, there was no contribution from Gill with the bat. Despite that, India's batting line-up still managed to challenge England. So, that's a good takeaway - we are not completely dependent on Gill.""Gill came into the Lord’s Test on the back of three centuries in the series, including a career-best 269. He has scored 607 runs so far, with two Tests left in the series.Manjrekar believes the break between matches will help Gill reset. ""I believe he has the ability to carry forward his form,he told JioHotstar.Referring to the captain’s mindset, Manjrekar added,During this break, perhaps with some introspection and conversations with his friends and father about the recent altercation. He just needs to focus on his captaincy, fielding, tactics, and batting. If he does that, I believe the run-making machine that was once in motion is well-oiled and will start running again at Old Trafford.""India trail the five-match series 2-1, making the fourth Test in Manchester a must-win to stay in contention.","Shubman Gill has impressed with both the bat and his leadership.

R Ashwin announces retirement from Test cricket

Poll Do you believe there was ever a genuine rift between Ashwin and Harbhajan? Yes, definitely No, it was all speculation Not sure

Former India off-spinners Ravichandran Ashwin and Harbhajan Singh confronted each other about their careers, rivalry, and the jealousy factor that reportedly created a rift between the duo.Over the years, comparisons between Ashwin and fellow Indian spin legend Harbhajan Singh were frequent. Speculation about a rift between the two spinners has often surfaced, suggesting strained relations.In the explosive teaser of Season 3 of Kutti Stories with Ash, India's two great spinners can be seen clearing the air about the speculated rift between them.""This whole jealousy bit. Before I allow you to answer that, let me clarify something. People look at everything from their perspective. For example, if they are passing a comment on me, they believe that others would see the world through their eyes. This comment that you are jealous of this person who is interviewing you today — what would that..."" Ashwin asked Harbhajan.Harbhajan replied, ""Do you think I am jealous of you? You are sitting with me today, and we have spoken at length. Do you think I am that kind of person?""Ashwin, in a very nonchalant way, replied, ""Even if you are jealous at one point, it is justified. That is my point. I would never take it the wrong way because we are all human.Naturally, it is bound to be like that.""Ashwin also cleared the air about his retirement.""Some people believe I retired because of Washington Sundar. He is in the thick of things now. All of this is the perspective of others,"" he said.Ashwin picked up 765 wickets in international cricket in 379 innings, while Harbhajan scalped 707 wickets in his illustrious career.After Ashwin's retirement from Test cricket, Harbhajan had already dispelled such rumours, asserting that there is no truth to claims of discord between them.""I read social media only as much as I need to. If there is a standoff between me and Ashwin, or if there was ever any fight, quarrel or disagreement, I would be the first person to go up to him and ask what the issue is,"" Harbhajan Singh said on his YouTube channel.""But it was never like this, and it will never be like this, because whatever is in his destiny, he will get it, and I got whatever was in my destiny. He has been a phenomenal bowler for India.

Shah (17) and Abbas Afridi (22) later added 33 runs for the seventh wicket to take Pakistan past the 100-run mark.Reflecting on the loss, skipper Salman Agha said: “It wasn’t enough on the board as we lost wickets at regular intervals, which we have to talk about before the second game.”Litton Das acknowledged the challenge of batting on a slow pitch: “It’s not an easy wicket to bat on, but the way we batted, it looked good.

India camp hit by more injuries, Playing XI TENSION before Manchester Test vs England

Heavy rain in Manchester

Persistent heavy rain threw India’s preparations for the crucial fourth Test against England into disarray as their first training session in Manchester was forced entirely indoors. The Old Trafford nets, which started as optional, saw several key players—including captain Shubman Gill KL Rahul , and Jasprit Bumrah—skip practice altogether. The rest of the squad reported to the ground amid downpours and gloomy skies, leaving the press and onlookers with no view of the team’s indoor activities.Manchester’s famously unpredictable weather is proving a real challenge. Over the past three days, the city has swung from brief sunshine to steady rain. The forecast for the Test’s opening day, July 23, predicts a 60% chance of morning showers and temperatures dropping to 17°C, raising concerns about start-time delays and tricky playing conditions.The uncooperative weather is just one of several headaches for the Indian camp. Fresh injury concerns have emerged in the fast-bowling ranks. Arshdeep Singh has a hand injury, and Akash Deep, who starred at Edgbaston, is now a doubtful starter with an ongoing back problem.In response, Haryana pacer Anshul Kamboj has been called up and could be on the cusp of a Test debut. Jasprit Bumrah , however, is expected to be fit and ready despite skipping the optional nets, providing a much-needed silver lining.With the rain narrowing preparation windows, tough calls loom. The management is considering dynamic changes and a possible reshuffle at number three in the batting order, assessing Karun Nair’s place, and debating whether to bring back Sai Sudarshan. Rishabh Pant ’s fitness is a topic of discussion, with the team weighing the option of deploying him solely as a batsman, perhaps handing wicketkeeping gloves to KL Rahul or giving Dhruv Jurel his chance.Selection dilemmas and weather uncertainty now dominate the narrative. As both teams chase the Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy, all eyes remain on the Old Trafford skies, knowing they could play as decisive a part in the Test outcome as any player on the field.","Heavy rain in Manchester threw India’s preparations for the crucial fourth Test against England into disarray as their first training session was forced entirely indoors.

T he International Cricket Council (ICC), at its annual conference, has kept USA Cricket (USAC) on notice and directed the board to undertake comprehensive governance reforms.

They are expected to take place in June, which aligns with England’s peak cricket season.The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) has previously hosted all three WTC finals — the 2021 final in Southampton (India vs New Zealand), the 2023 final at The Oval in London (India vs Australia), and the 2025 edition scheduled at Lord's (South Africa vs Australia)."".....the England and Wales Cricket Board have been awarded hosting rights for the next three World Test Championship Finals.

Poll Do you believe Arsenal will maintain their dominance in women's football with this signing? Definitely Maybe, but it's not guaranteed No, other teams are catching up

Arsenal have completed a historic £1 million transfer of Canadian forward Olivia Smith from Liverpool, marking the first seven-figure transfer in women's football. The 20-year-old's move to the European champions surpasses the previous record of £900,000 paid by Chelsea for American defender Naomi Girma from San Diego Wave in January.The milestone transfer comes 44 years after Trevor Francis became the first male player to command a million-pound fee when he moved from Birmingham City to Nottingham Forest in 1979. Arsenal secured Smith's services after successful negotiations with Liverpool, who initially were reluctant to let go of their player of the season.""It's my dream to compete for the biggest titles here in England and in Europe and I'm excited to get started and contribute to doing that here with Arsenal,"" Smith said in a statement.Smith demonstrated her value at Liverpool last season, scoring nine goals and earning the club's player of the season award despite the team's struggles. Her versatility allows her to play both as a forward and on the wing, making her an attractive signing for Arsenal.Arsenal's director of women's football, Clare Wheatley, expressed enthusiasm about the signing: ""We're thrilled to bring Olivia to Arsenal. She's one of the most talented young players in the game and has huge potential for further development here.""Smith's journey in football began with her becoming the youngest player to represent Canada at age 15. She then moved to Sporting Lisbon in 2023, where she scored 16 goals in 28 games before joining Liverpool.""It's a privilege and an honor to sign for Arsenal. The atmosphere the supporters create at Emirates Stadium is incredible and I can't wait to have that behind me now,"" Smith stated.The transfer represents Arsenal's ambition to strengthen their position in women's football, following their Champions League victory. The club, which holds the distinction of being the most decorated in English women's football, has also secured the services of winger Chloe Kelly, Taylor Hinds, and Anneke Borbe on free transfers for the upcoming season.Liverpool, who finished seventh last season, plan to use the transfer fee to reinforce their squad. The record-breaking transfer signifies Arsenal's intent to maintain their dominance in the league while setting a new benchmark for women's football transfers.The transfer marks a significant moment in the development of women's football, establishing a new financial milestone that reflects the growing investment and commercial value in the women's game.

PANAJI: Three months after the All India Football Federation (AIFF) declared Churchill Brothers FC as the I-League winners and hastily handed over the trophy during a ceremony in Goa, the federation announced Inter Kashi FC as the new champions on Friday.The announcement follows orders from the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), after the Switzerland-based tribunal set aside the AIFF appeals committee decision, which had adjudged that the re-registration of Mario Barco by the Varanasi-based club made him an ineligible player. Points were forfeited following a protest by three clubs – Churchill Brothers, Namdhari and Real Kashmir -- leaving them lower in the table.The CAS panel, an independent international body that settles disputes related to sport through arbitration, however set aside the appeals committee decision issued on May 31 and ordered AIFF to “adjust the points table of the I-League and declare Inter Kashi as champions.”The final points table leaves Kashi at the top with 42 points, two more than second-placed Churchill.Real Kashmir finished third with 37 points.“We won on the pitch, fair and square, but many could not accept that,” said club president Prithijit Das. “Our club is barely two years old, which played the I-League with heart and grit. Maybe because we weren’t part of the old order, false cases were filed, our integrity questioned, our name dragged. We didn’t give up. We went all the way to CAS, fought steadily, and won.”Significantly, this was the second win for Kashi at CAS in as many months after the Swiss body had previously overturned the appeals committee decision of taking away three points that were awarded by the disciplinary committee as Namdhari fielded an ineligible player (Cledson da Silva)“This win is not just ours. It’s a reminder of what sport should stand for; passion, fairness, and honesty, not politics,” said Das.AIFF was quick to readjust the league points table and officially declare Kashi as the new champions.“CAS has ruled that the AIFF shall declare Inter Kashi as winners of the I-League 2024-25. The AIFF congratulates Inter Kashi on being adjudged champions,” AIFF said in a statement.With the CAS order and AIFF’s statement, the I-League title race has now finally concluded, more than three months after the teams had played the last round of matches. On the final day, Churchill had their chances to settle the race on the ground itself but only ended up drawing 1-1 against Real Kashmir in Srinagar.Kashi, who were almost out of the race, turned the standings on its head after scoring twice in four stoppage-time minutes for a 3-1 win against Rajasthan United. The players celebrated at their home ground, believing they had come from behind not just for a win but also a memorable triumph.“It was a very difficult time for everyone at the club but in the end, victory is ours. We have won not just the I-League title, but our name and respect as well,” said Das.","Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) overturns AIFF decision to declare Churchill Brothers the I-League champions.

Why was the ban imposed in first place?

Poll What is your main concern regarding the return of away fans? Increased violence and incidents Allocation of police resources General public safety

Argentina's football federation has announced plans to gradually lift a 12-year ban on away fans in local leagues, which was originally implemented to curb stadium violence but proved ineffective.The first test of this new policy will occur during the Clausura tournament's second matchday when Lanús hosts Rosario Central.""It's a day that marks a before and after in our league,"" Argentine Football Association president Claudio Tapia said. ""It's the kind of football (with visitors) we all grew accustomed to since we were kids. We have to get back to that path. Clubs that are in a position to host visiting fans can do so.""The ban was initiated in 2013 following two tragic incidents: a Lanús fan's death during a police intervention in a clash with Estudiantes supporters, and the deaths of two Boca Juniors fans in a faction-related shootout.The restriction began in Buenos Aires province before expanding nationwide. However, violence persisted with continued deaths among ""barrabravas"" groups.Under the new protocol, 6,500 Rosario Central supporters will be permitted in the Lanús away section. The plan includes strict security measures and designated tickets for proper fan identification.""The idea isn't to go back to what we had before because the visitors were kicked out for a reason,"" Buenos Aires security minister Javier Alonso said. ""We have to eradicate the culture of violence. It's sad to see 10-year-olds singing about drugs or that someone needs to be killed. It has to be a family celebration, with flags and drums.""The initial implementation will be limited to Buenos Aires province, though other provinces have expressed interest in joining the initiative.The plan has faced opposition from some quarters in Buenos Aires. Critics argue that allocating police resources to protect visiting fans could compromise general public security amid rising crime concerns.The away fan restriction only applied to professional league matches and other divisions in Argentina, while international tournaments like Copa Libertadores and Copa Sudamericana continued to allow visiting supporters.""This is what football fans and society want. Many matches have been organised with two sets of fans, and that's why we decided to announce the start of the return of visiting fans,"" Tapia added.",Argentina's football federation has announced plans to gradually lift a 12-year ban on away fans in local leagues.

Other Formula E initiatives

Formula E has several initiatives running under its sustainability campaign. Among them is a youth education program called Driving Force, supported by PIF E360. It aims to teach children between the ages of 8 and 18 about science, technology, and sustainability. The goal is to reach over 50,000 students worldwide by the end of 2025.The Driving Force initiative comes at a time when there is expected to be a massive demand for 200,000 skilled workers in the UK for green jobs by 2030, according to PwC.Driving Force helps students learn about clean energy and the environment. It also introduces them to role models from the fields of science and technology, helping them gain the knowledge and confidence needed to consider careers in these areas. These workshops use fun and practical activities to show how what students learn in school can lead to exciting real-world careers in racing, clean energy, engineering, and more.On July 16, over 90 students participated in Formula E’s Driving Force workshop at Hammersmith Academy in London. The session was one of five workshops held at schools across London in July, near the London E-Prix race site in East London and Formula E’s headquarters in Hammersmith.Earlier this year, similar workshops were also held in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, and Miami, USA, during Formula E race weeks.Julia Pallé, VP of Sustainability at Formula E, said, ""A survey in 2024 of more than 7,000 UK secondary school students reveals a worrying downward trend in both their involvement in and their ambition to pursue STEM subjects — a stark wake-up call for educators and policymakers alike.""""Teachers are being asked to make stronger connections between subjects and careers, but they need support from employers to do that effectively. Driving Force, presented by PIF E360, is part of the solution to help the education system deliver what our students and our green economy both desperately need to succeed,” she added.Also Read: Taylor Barnard overtakes Antonio Felix Da Costa in Berlin to claim 3rd in Formula E Driver Standings Formula E’s broader social impact strategy includes several other initiatives such as FIA Girls on Track, the Better Futures Fund, and Inspiration Hour.

Lola Yamaha ABT’s performance at Berlin E-Prix

It’s not unusual for teams to introduce new designs for special Formula E races, be it for livery or driver suits. While Nissan’s cherry blossom livery at the Tokyo E-Prix was a hit and now NEOM McLaren will be racing in a striking white and blue livery, the Lola Yamaha ABT team did something absolutely unexpected at the Berlin E-Prix. Drivers Lucas Di Grassi and Zane Maloney literally wore Superman bodysuits for the race at the Tempelhof Airport Circuit. And just one glimpse of the same wouldn’t be enough.Ahead of the Berlin race, Lucas Di Grassi shared some interesting pictures to introduce his Superman bodysuit. He was seen jumping up in the air while sporting the bodysuit. He captioned it, “No CGI or AI involved. Driver was ok(ish) after the jumps.”A fan wrote, “Even the suit is made as Superman! Man, I love this season.” Another called it, “Sensacional!” A fan also praised “The verticality” in the picture.Lola Yamaha ABT had introduced him and Zane Maloney with the caption: “The beacons of hope. @zane.maloney and @lucasdigrassi are wearing bespoke race suits in a specially wrapped car this weekend, to celebrate our partnership with @warnerbrosde and the new Superman movie. Up, up and away!”The drivers posed enthusiastically on their Formula E Gen3 Evo cars and even jumped from them to get some perfect pictures to suit the Superman theme.However, Lola Yamaha ABT didn’t have a very good race at the Tempelhof Circuit. Lucas Di Grassi suffered a crash in FP3. Neither of the two drivers could bring in any points for the team. Di Grassi finished 18th and 12th in the Round 13 and Round 14 races, respectively. His teammate Zane Maloney finished 16th and 18th in the two races at the double-header.After the race, Di Grassi shared a post on Instagram in which he wrote, “We are one… team.

He had held third place in the Formula E Driver Standings for a long time but has now slipped to fourth. NEOM McLaren’s Taylor Barnard delivered a strong performance in Berlin and replaced Da Costa in the top three.

Those who support me through the good times, but mostly the bad… you guys who are tireless and show me how strong our Portuguese race is.”He further added, “The dream of the championship ended last week, I dreamed, I dreamed big and so did you. Apparently it was the year of “2nd places”. Seems like I'm in the wrong place at the wrong time too often. 3 wins lost in the last laps because of safety cars, a few mistakes my mixture, the season could have been so different, but that's what it is in sport, and the bad moments, if used well, are the best thing we have.

Oliver Rowland’s journey in Formula E was full of ups and downs

Oliver Rowland shares his happiness on Formula E championship win

Things weren’t always well-planned for Oliver Rowland, who has just clinched the Formula E World Championship. The 32-year-old Nissan driver took major risks throughout his career, including walking away from a team without another offer in hand. He describes that time as one of the toughest periods of his life. But Rowland eventually bounced back, joining a new team and going on to win the championship this season.Oliver Rowland made his one-race debut in Formula E with Mahindra Racing at the 2015 Punta del Este ePrix, replacing the injured Nick Heidfeld. He quickly disappeared from the scene afterward.Reflecting on that strange start in Formula E’s second season, Rowland told Formula E’s official website, “If you go back to Punta del Este, I remember having no idea about anything when I arrived and leaving thinking, ‘I'm not sure I want to do that again, because it was pretty tough.’”He eventually returned as a full-time Formula E driver with Nissan e.dams in 2018. After delivering notable performances over a few seasons, he switched to Mahindra Racing in 2021. However, midway through the 2023 season, Rowland made another bold move — quitting the team without a confirmed offer elsewhere. Nissan brought him back the following season, leading to two remarkable years that culminated in him winning the Season 11 championship.Speaking about his decision to leave Mahindra Racing in 2023 after two seasons, Rowland said, “I took a huge risk for my career and for my family because my contract is what keeps us all fed and watered, so walking away from that was a really, really tough period in my life. I remember not sleeping for like, two, three weeks at some point. To kind of write the story and come out on the other side with the team that I started in Formula E with is just perfect. ”He added, “As a racing driver, a lot of days are bad, and you have to keep believing in yourself — that you're capable of doing it. Going into this year, I was confident that we would have a good chance.”Now, Oliver Rowland has become the Formula E World Champion in just his second year back with Nissan. “The moment I arrived in the championship and looked at the caliber of drivers here and the previous World Champions, it's such a good achievement for me to become World Champion. To be part of that is incredible,” he said.Also Read: Oliver Rowland’s rise to champion: Rare childhood moments highlighted in touching video Rowland will now race in front of his home crowd in London, where he’ll lift the World Championship trophy.

How Taylor Barnard surpassed Antonio Felix Da Costa in Driver Standings

This is 21-year-old Taylor Barnard’s first full-fledged season as a rookie driver, and the NEOM McLaren racer has achieved what many of his peers couldn’t. At the recently held Berlin E-Prix, Barnard put up a strong performance on the track, managing to surpass Antonio Felix Da Costa and take the third spot in the standings. With two races remaining, Barnard still has a chance to overtake Pascal Wehrlein for the second place.Taylor Barnard outperformed TAG Heuer Porsche’s Antonio Felix Da Costa in Berlin. Da Costa, who had been comfortably sitting in third, has now slipped to fourth in the standings.Taking to Instagram to reflect on his Berlin performance, Barnard wrote, “Reflecting on Berlin. Definitely a weekend of what could have been, but we scored good points across both races, closing the gap to P2 in the standings. An unfortunately timed SC on Sunday cost us the chance of going for the win, but we will maximise our efforts to go into London as strong as possible.Taylor Barnard finished fourth in Round 13 and sixth in Round 14 race at the Berlin E-Prix, collecting a total of 20 points. In comparison, Da Costa finished 10th and 8th in the two races, scoring just 5 points — enabling Barnard to leap ahead of him in the standings.Currently, Oliver Rowland has sealed the Formula E Championship title with 184 points.Pascal Wehrlein holds second place with 125 points, while Barnard trails closely behind with 112. A strong performance in London could be enough for Barnard to overtake Wehrlein and claim second place in the championship.So far this season, Barnard has secured five podium finishes — one each in Sao Paulo, Tokyo, and Shanghai, and two in Jeddah — though he is yet to clinch his first Formula E race win.Barnard will now race on home soil in London alongside his McLaren teammate Sam Bird. The duo will sport a new blue-and-white livery and race suits. He recently shared pictures of him in his London-special race suit and captioned it on Instagram, “One city to go.”Also Read: Oliver Rowland’s rise to champion: Rare childhood moments highlighted in touching video The double-header marks the grand finale of Formula E Season 11, scheduled from July 25–27.","Taylor Barnard takes the number 3 spot in Formula E Driver Standings.

Oliver Rowland was worried after how Round 13 turned out in Berlin

Formula E Berlin Round 14 – 60‑Second Blitz!

Pascal Wehrlein’s Round 14 performance sealed Oliver Rowland’s championship win

Oliver Rowland looking forward to his home race now



Oliver Rowland’s fans kept their fingers crossed and waited with bated breath for the Nissan driver to seal his Formula E World Championship at the Round 13 race in Berlin on Saturday. But the day ended on a sad note for the driver as he failed to even finish the race, while his closest competitor, Pascal Wehrlein, clinched second spot on the podium, closing the gap between them in the Formula E Driver Standings. Rowland has confirmed that he did doubt his championship win when things didn’t play out well that day.There was reason to be worried for Nissan driver Oliver Rowland when TAG Heuer Porsche’s Pascal Wehrlein closed the gap between them in the Driver Standings to 50 points. He was second in the Formula E Driver Standings and could have changed the championship outcome with two more races remaining in the season.Sharing his fears in an interview with Formula E, he said, “I was hoping before the weekend that the outcome could be [the World Championship], but after yesterday (Saturday) and this morning (Sunday) I was more worried that it might never come.”Pascal Wehrlein ended 15th in the Round 14 race on Sunday despite starting from pole position.Rowland eventually bounced back to finally seal his championship win by finishing fourth in the race. He missed out on the podium, which had Jaguar TCS Racing’s Nick Cassidy as the winner, but his 12 points, along with his closest competitor Pascal Wehrlein’s disappointing performance, were enough for him to clinch the championship.“I wasn't aware of where Pascal was at all. My engineer came on, I think with four or five laps to go, and said ‘P4 is good,’ and I thought that's a bit weird. Then I looked at the TV screen, and I got to about eighth, and I thought, ‘Oh, he's not in the top eight then.’ The next time I came around looking again, I found him when I started from the bottom. I didn't know if he'd had a problem, so then I was aware that fourth would be enough if Wehrlein didn't score, so I knew that myself. I didn't want to ask, because I didn't want to jinx anything,” he said.Oliver Rowland took to Instagram on Wednesday to share a post to mark his Formula E Championship win. Sharing a few pictures of his celebrations with his team, the Nissan driver wrote: “2025 FIA FORMULA E WORLD CHAMPION! It still hasn’t quite sunk in what we have achieved this season. I couldn’t have imagined being in this position 2 years ago! Thank you to my incredible team @nismo & everyone that’s supported me!

World champion looks good on you!”Speaking after the race, Dennis reflected on his recent struggles, having finished 17th in consecutive races leading up to Berlin.“We had a really good race car and the strategy we took into the race was perfectly executed. I had every opportunity to win this race, and we got pretty close. I’m not too surprised to be up here — I’m just super happy for myself and for the team. We’ve been on a real bad luck streak recently, so to reward them with a P2 is the least I could do,” he said.Looking ahead to his home race in London, which also serves as the Season 11 Formula E finale, Dennis said, “I’m excited to have this little boost going into the final stretch, my home race in London. It’s needed. It’s more for morale. Oliver [Rowland] has already won the championship, so massive congratulations to him. I’m super happy for him, he’s a good friend of mine.”Also Read: Nick Cassidy on Berlin E-Prix win: “I don’t want to take the moment from Oliver Rowland” Jake Dennis currently sits tenth in the 2025 Formula E Drivers' Standings with 77 points.

Pascal Wehrlein clinches podium in Berlin Round 13

Pascal Wehrlein fights to secure his position in Formula E Driver Standings

It was a special day for German driver Pascal Wehrlein at his home race, the Berlin E-Prix, on Saturday.

He captioned it: “I promised you a trophy. P2 at our first home race of the season. Grateful to have family and friends here to share the moment.

Finishing second is a good result, but we had a small taste of the victory. I think pace-wise, we were the quickest, so I tried really hard and it was close in the end.

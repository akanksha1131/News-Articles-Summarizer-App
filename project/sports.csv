Poll Was Rishabh Pant's reaction justified given the match situation? Yes, he was frustrated No, he overreacted

During a tense moment in England's innings at Headingley, India's vice-captain Rishabh Pant faces potential ICC sanctions after displaying frustration over an umpire's decision regarding a ball change request. The incident unfolded after the penultimate delivery of the 61st over when Mohammed Siraj was hit for four by Harry Brook 's ramp shot over the slips, leading to Pant's animated protest and subsequent actions that could breach multiple ICC Code of Conduct articles.The situation escalated when Pant, dissatisfied with the ball's condition, approached umpire Paul Reiffel for inspection. Despite Reiffel's examination with a ball gauge indicating no issues, Pant persisted in his appeal for a ball change.Upon the umpire's rejection of his request, Pant reacted by throwing the ball back-handed onto the ground before leaving the scene, prompting boos from the Headingley crowd.Former India coach Ravi Shastri, commenting on the incident, stated: ""When you start wanting to change the ball every now and then, it's a clear indication that nothing's happening. We want something to happen. And that was frustration from Pant."" Mark Butcher , co-commentator, responded: ""I'm not sure there was any need for that. (We) know that he's a showman and part of that is probably in order to get a reaction from the crowd, but I'm not sure Paul Reiffel appreciated it very much.""Pant's actions could potentially violate two specific articles of the ICC Code of Conduct. Article 2.8 addresses dissent at an umpire's decision, which could be classified as either a Level 1 or Level 2 offense, particularly under clause (a) for showing excessive disappointment and clause (h) for engaging in prolonged discussion about the decision.The second possible violation falls under Article 2.9, which specifically prohibits ""throwing a ball at or near an umpire in an inappropriate manner."" This offense also carries potential Level 1 and Level 2 sanctions.Quiz: Who's that IPL player? The controversy continued to impact the game as the umpires conducted multiple ball checks in the following over. Team members Shubman Gill and Jasprit Bumrah were observed discussing the issue with officials.The match situation at the time showed England at 276-5 in response to India's first-innings total of 471, with Mohammed Siraj managing to dismiss Ben Stokes shortly after the incident.The incident highlights the growing tensions in the match and raises questions about player conduct and its consequences under ICC regulations. The governing body's response to Pant's actions remains to be seen as the match continues to unfold at Headingley.",India's vice-captain Rishabh Pant faces potential ICC sanctions after displaying frustration over an umpire's decision regarding a ball change request.

India‚Äôs first Test against England at Headingley is turning into an instant classic ‚Äî packed with big runs, sharp banter, and Jasprit Bumrah ‚Äôs record-breaking brilliance under cloudy skies.Day 2 saw India finish their imposing first innings at 471, anchored by Rishabh Pant ‚Äôs sparkling seventh Test century. But the momentum wobbled when the visitors lost their last seven wickets for just 41 runs.

BUMRAH‚ÄôS BRILLIANCE

KL RAHUL IMPRESSES

Sitanshu Kotak press conference: Big revelation on Shubman Gill

NEW DELHI: Despite a valiant effort from Jasprit Bumrah and a fluent start by KL Rahul, India endured another patchy day in the field as England posted 465 in their first innings to nearly wipe out India‚Äôs advantage on Day 3 of the first Test at Headingley on Sunday.India ended the day at 90/2, leading by 96 runs, with KL Rahul (47)* and Shubman Gill (6)* unbeaten at stumps.India were let down by poor fielding once again, dropping five catches in the innings. The most glaring was when Yashasvi Jaiswal dropped Harry Brook for the third time in the match ‚Äî on 82 ‚Äî off Bumrah‚Äôs bowling.Earlier, Brook was dropped by Rishabh Pant on 46, and also survived after being bowled off a Bumrah no-ball on Day 2. He eventually fell for 99, pulling a short ball from Prasidh Krishna to Shardul Thakur at fine leg.Resuming at 209/3, England rode on Harry Brook‚Äôs aggressive 99 and Chris Woakes‚Äô quickfire 38 to erase India‚Äôs lead. Brook was the standout with fearless strokeplay, launching even Bumrah for sixes over extra cover.England scored 138 runs in 23.4 overs in the extended afternoon session, regularly finding boundaries off an inconsistent Indian pace attack.Jasprit Bumrah was once again India‚Äôs saving grace. He claimed 5/83 in 24.4 overs, his 14th five-wicket haul in Tests and 10th in SENA countries, a milestone unmatched by any other Indian pacer.His spell ended England‚Äôs innings at 465, giving India a slender six-run first-innings lead.While Bumrah shone, the rest of India‚Äôs pace unit struggled. Prasidh Krishna picked up two wickets, including Brook and Jamie Smith, but conceded 128 runs in 20 overs, lacking variation and control.Shardul Thakur was barely used, and Ravindra Jadeja was curiously brought in late, despite extracting turn.Chasing quick runs before stumps, India lost Yashasvi Jaiswal (4) early to Brydon Carse, and Sai Sudharsan (30) again fell to Ben Stokes, who dismissed him twice in the match.But KL Rahul looked composed and elegant, striking seven boundaries, most through classic drives, as he remained unbeaten on 47 before rain stopped play.Throughout the innings, Indian players were visibly unhappy with the condition of the worn-out Dukes ball, and frequently appealed to the umpires for a change. After repeated refusals, the ball was eventually changed in the 75th over, just before the second new ball became available.India will hope for a solid batting effort on Day 4 to set up the match, while England will look to capitalise on any slip-ups. With conditions still favouring seam movement, the match is finely balanced heading into a potentially pivotal fourth day.","Jasprit Bumrah claimed 5/83 in 24.4 overs, his 14th five-wicket haul in Tests and 10th in SENA countries.

Ball in his right hand and sweater resting on his left, Jasprit Bumrah had his eyes locked on the giant screen, which was showing the replay of his fifth wicket. No bowler wants to miss the opportunity of seeing the ball crashing into the woodwork, and Bumrah admired the dismissal before acknowledging the standing ovation from a jam-packed Headingley. A gentle raise of the ball and the Indian spearhead walked into the dressing room after completing his 14th five-wicket haul in Tests.For 24.4 overs, Bumrah fought a lonely battle at Headingley. His fellow bowlers let him down, fielders let him down, but he kept picking himself up ball after ball, over after over. He would bury his face in his cap when a catch was dropped off his bowling and found it hard to even open his eyes after it happened again, but he maintained composure, stuck to the job, kept running in hard, and finished with a magnificent fifer.He would create pressure only to see a Prasidh Krishna or Mohammed Siraj bowl looseners from the other end. England kept ticking along because they knew there was only one Bumrah in the Indian XI, and he could only do so much. The state of current Indian bowling can draw parallels with Indian batting of the '90s ‚Äî a one-man show. If it was Sachin Tendulkar versus the opposition, it is Bumrah versus the opposition now.Krishna picked three and Siraj scalped two, but together they conceded 250 runs in 47 overs.More than the runs conceded, it was the way they sprayed the ball over the place during crucial junctures of the game. Yes, Siraj looked good when the ball lost its lacquer on Day 2 but looked completely clueless on Day 3.As far as Krishna is concerned, he stuck to the short-ball ploy with the oldish Dukes and got the rewards, but when he erred with his lines, he was dispatched with disdain.The Indian team management's confidence in Shardul Thakur looked low because the all-rounder bowled only six overs ‚Äî three on each day ‚Äî out of the 100.4 overs sent down by the Indian bowlers.The script has that familiar feeling because it played out on numerous occasions during the Border Gavaskar Trophy (BGT) in Australia. Both Siraj and Krishna have played and traveled with the side enough to do the job from the other end.Yes, England's approach and the Bazball jazz are there, but the erratic lines and lengths are unexplainable at this level. India were very ordinary with the second new ball and allowed the opposition's lower order to add 114 runs in 20.4 overs before Bumrah was summoned for an over before the break to do his magic again.He didn't disappoint and picked two wickets in quick succession, but it was the other two seamers (because they never went towards the third) who were unable to create an impact, even in conditions ‚Äî overcast and windy ‚Äî which were ideal for the quicks. Bumrah carried the load in the first outing of the Leeds Test, but he will not be there forever ‚Äî certainly not for more than three Tests of the series.Which ones are anybody's guess right now, but India need to start preparing for life without Bumrah, and prepare for it now. Handling of the new ball will be a serious concern, and it's important the experienced pro Siraj puts his hand up and steps up. Siraj is no stranger to bowling with the Dukes, and Krishna has had enough experience traveling with the team and playing with A sides.Bumrah continues to eat, sleep, pick wickets, and repeat, and it's about time others drill the same routine into their heads.","Bumrah carried the load in the first outing of the Leeds Test, but he will not be there forever ‚Äî certainly not for more than three Tests of the series.

NEW DELHI: Tensions flared at Headingley on Sunday, June 22, as Indian pacer Mohammed Siraj and England‚Äôs Harry Brook were involved in a heated on-field exchange during the first Test. The incident unfolded in the 84th over, after Brook smashed two consecutive boundaries off Siraj, prompting the Indian bowler to respond with a fiery spell ‚Äî and some sharp words.Brook, playing with intent against the second new ball, punished the Indian bowlers who were struggling to extract movement from the pitch. Siraj, in particular, bore the brunt of Brook‚Äôs aggressive strokeplay.In response, Siraj delivered a sharp inswinger that troubled Brook and followed it up with a long stare and some verbal aggression. Brook, unfazed, dismissed the confrontation with a wave of his hand and stayed focused on his attacking approach.The England batter had the final say ‚Äî at least temporarily ‚Äî when he tore into the next over, hammering 18 runs, including a towering six over long-on, as Siraj searched unsuccessfully for answers.Siraj‚Äôs overall outing with the ball has been underwhelming in this innings. His only wicket came in the 65th over, when he dismissed England skipper Ben Stokes. His first spell with the new ball on Day 2 lacked consistency, and Sunday‚Äôs incident added further frustration to his figures.This isn‚Äôt the first time Siraj has found himself in the middle of on-field altercations. During the 2024‚Äì25 Border-Gavaskar Trophy, he had similar confrontations with Marnus Labuschagne and Travis Head, incidents that drew fines from the ICC.As for Brook, he continued to dominate, marching into the nineties with a flurry of well-timed strokes. He moved to 99 with a couple off Prasidh Krishna in the 88th over. However, his bid for a home-ground century came to a heartbreaking end just three balls later. Attempting a pull shot, he mistimed it, and Shardul Thakur took a slightly awkward but successful catch at fine leg, denying Brook a ton at Leeds.England‚Äôs innings ended at 465, giving them a narrow six-run lead over India heading into the second innings of this gripping Test match.","Mohammed Siraj and Harry Brook involved in heated on-field exchange.

Sitanshu Kotak press conference: Big revelation on Shubman Gill

NEW DELHI: Legendary Indian cricketer Sunil Gavaskar has expressed strong reservations over the naming of the ongoing five-match Test series between India and England as the Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy. Gavaskar argued that Sachin Tendulkar ‚Äôs name should appear before James Anderson‚Äôs, citing Tendulkar‚Äôs seniority and vastly superior achievements in international cricket.Writing in his column for Mid-Day, Gavaskar dismissed the reasoning that names were ordered alphabetically and took particular aim at the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) for their decision.‚ÄúThe ECB is fully entitled to call the series by any name they choose but for most, if not all, Indian cricket lovers it is jarring to know that Anderson's name comes first. Not only is Sachin Tendulkar along with Kapil Dev the greatest Indian cricketer, but also senior to Anderson by more than a dozen years. He is numero uno as far as runs and centuries are concerned in Test cricket but also at the one-day level too he has more runs than anybody else,‚Äù Gavaskar wrote.The former India captain continued by underlining the disparity in accomplishments between the two cricketing icons.‚ÄúAnderson is third in the list of wicket takers in Test cricket and his record is nowhere as good as Tendulkar in one-day cricket. Tendulkar is also part of a World Cup winning team which Anderson has not been.Jimmy Anderson was a terrific bowler but mainly in English conditions and his record away is nowhere near as good as Tendulkar's is,‚Äù he added.Gavaskar also called upon Indian fans and the media to refer to the series as the Tendulkar-Anderson Trophy, flipping the current order to reflect what he believes is the more appropriate recognition.In the same column, Gavaskar offered suggestions regarding the Pataudi Medal of Excellence, which is currently awarded to the captain of the series-winning team. He questioned the logic behind that structure.‚ÄúWhy the captain and what if the series is drawn? That's why it would have been better to have had a Pataudi medal for the man of the match for every Test, culminating in the Pataudi Trophy for the player of the series. This way, the Pataudis will be remembered after every Test match played as well as after the series is finished in England,‚Äù Gavaskar remarked.","Former India captain Sunil Gavaskar has expressed strong reservations over the naming of the ongoing five-match Test series as the Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy.

Liverpool‚Äôs biggest-ever transfer!

Florian Wirtz has joined Liverpool from Bayer Leverkusen for a club-record fee, following the Reds' 20th English top-flight title victory under Arne Slot. Former Liverpool midfielder and Wirtz's ex-coach Xabi Alonso has already recognised him as one of the world's best players.British media has reported that Liverpool will pay up to ¬£116 million ($157 million) for the attacking midfielder. German sources suggest an even higher fee, beginning at 130 million euros (¬£111 million, $149 million) with potential add-ons reaching 150 million euros.A dispute arose between Cologne and Leverkusen five years ago when Leverkusen signed the teenage Wirtz at age 17. Cologne claimed a gentleman's agreement regarding youth players was broken, but Leverkusen maintained Wirtz was a first-team signing.Wirtz's progress was halted by a cruciate knee ligament injury in March 2022, keeping him sidelined for 10 months. Upon his return, he found Alonso as the new Leverkusen manager, leading to the club's most successful period.Under their partnership, Leverkusen ended Bayern Munich's Bundesliga dominance, securing both the league title and German Cup without losing a match in 2023/24. Wirtz celebrated the title-clinching match against Werder Bremen with his first career hat-trick, later earning the Bundesliga player of the year award.""Flo is one of the top players in the world, he's world class,"" said Real Madrid coach Alonso, who compared his prot√©g√© to Lionel Messi in terms of his understanding of the game.""Why is Messi so good? Because he knows how and when to play simple passes. Messi says: 'You're in a better position? Here, there you have the ball'. It's not always about making the most brilliant move, but the best and smartest. Florian can do that. That's why he's so good.""Both Wirtz and Alonso initially committed to staying at Leverkusen for another year. However, their Europa League final loss to Atalanta in 2023/24 marked a turning point.Bayern Munich regained control of German football the following season but failed to convince Wirtz to join them. Instead, he chose to move to the Premier League champions.""I'm really excited to have a new adventure in front of me. This was also a big point of my thoughts: that I want to have something completely new, to go out of the Bundesliga and to join the Premier League,"" said Wirtz. ""I spoke also with some players who played there and they told me that it's perfect for me and every pitch is perfect, you can enjoy every game. I'm really looking forward to playing my first game.""Despite his impressive record of 57 goals and 65 assists in 197 games for Leverkusen, Wirtz will start his Liverpool career alongside Mohamed Salah. Liverpool sees Wirtz's creative abilities as key to maintaining Salah's scoring record and supporting the team's attack.The club might sell their previous record signing, Darwin Nunez, who cost ¬£85 million but hasn't met expectations, to offset some of their recent spending.

Dutch soccer player Quincy Promes was being extradited Friday from Dubai to the Netherlands, where he faces a prison sentence for involvement in cocaine smuggling, the prosecutor's office told The Associated Press.The Dutch public prosecution service confirmed to the AP that Promes was en route to the Netherlands, in Dutch custody. Promes, who scored seven goals in 50 international matches for the Netherlands before legal issues derailed his international career, was convicted last year of complicity in cocaine smuggling and sentenced in his absence to six years in prison.Amsterdam District Court ruled that Promes was involved in the import and export of hundreds of kilograms (pounds) of cocaine in 2020. His lawyers told judges he denied the allegations. In 2023, Promes was found guilty of stabbing his cousin in the leg and was sentenced to 18 months in prison.Both of Promes' convictions are currently under appeal. Promes, a 33-year-old former player for Ajax and Sevilla, had been playing for Spartak Moscow and living in Russia from 2021 until last year, when he was reportedly arrested in Dubai around the time that Spartak was there for friendly games. More recently, he had been playing with United FC, a second-tier club in Dubai.","Quincy Promes was being extradited Friday from Dubai to the Netherlands.

Formula E is not only introducing the fastest electric car, the GEN3 Evo, at the Jakarta E-Prix this year but also making an impact off the track. Several Formula E members participated in a beach clean-up on Thursday at Pantai Beach in the Ancol resort, where the race will be held. They are also engaging in local partnerships, educational initiatives, and community outreach to help reduce the environmental impact in the city.On Thursday, June 19, Formula E, Waste4Change, and over 100 volunteers‚Äîincluding FE team members and drivers‚Äîjoined local community members for a large-scale beach clean-up. The initiative focused on conserving marine habitats and addressing waste management, a key issue in coastal Jakarta.Julia Pall√©, VP of Sustainability at Formula E, said about the drive: ‚ÄúPlastic pollution is a growing problem that affects everyone around the world and is a growing challenge here in Jakarta ‚Äî threatening both coastal habitats and the health of nearby communities. At every race, we are committed to engaging with local communities and aim to leave a place better than we found it. We are united as a championship with the community to clean the local area of plastic rubbish and ensure it is sustainably managed and not put back into landfill.To further minimize waste at the event, free hydration stations will provide water refills to reduce reliance on single-use plastic bottles. Visitors will also receive biodegradable eco-cups made from corn starch flour as an alternative to traditional plastic. Six dedicated waste stations will be set up for proper recycling and plastic waste management.Formula E has undertaken several more sustainability initiatives in Jakarta.

Jakarta E‚ÄëPrix Essentials: Everything You Need to Know | Formula E Season 11, Round 12

Season 11 of the ABB FIA Formula E World Championship is coming to a close, with five races remaining on the calendar. The Jakarta E-Prix is a crucial race, and it's hard to predict who may lift the trophy in Indonesia this year. The current season has already seen seven different race winners and fifteen drivers on the podium. Not only that, but every single team has achieved a podium finish so far ‚Äî a clear indication of how tight and unpredictable the competition is.Nissan's Oliver Rowland is far ahead of the competition so far, as he dominates the FIA Drivers' World Championship standings with 171 points ‚Äî significantly ahead of Pascal Wehrlein, who sits in second position with 103 points for TAG Heuer Porsche. Rowland has a total of four wins and three second-place finishes this season, and he may continue his winning streak in Jakarta as well.Maserati MSG Racing‚Äôs Maximilian Gunther is being counted among the hot favourites to bag a podium at the Jakarta E-Prix. He has two wins under his belt this year and will be trying his best to maintain his stronghold in the city and add more points to his tally.He had secured third place in the Part 1 race in 2023, having started from Julius Bar Pole Position ‚Äî a historic moment as Maserati's first single-seater motorsport pole since 1958.He again bagged the pole the next day of the double-header and went on to win his first race in the iconic blue livery of Maserati MSG Racing. It marked Maserati‚Äôs first single-seater championship podium since Juan Manuel Fangio's 1957 German Grand Prix victory, en route to that year‚Äôs Formula One title.Pascal Wehrlein won one of the two races at the Jakarta E-Prix‚Äôs last edition, and the TAG Heuer Porsche driver is very much in form at present, with a win in Miami and three more podium finishes in the Formula E 2025 World Championship so far. He is second in the 2025 Formula E Driver Standings with 103 points and will be aiming for a win to catch up with Rowland.Jaguar TCS Racing‚Äôs Mitch Evans has been away from the podium for a long time now after winning the first race of this season in Sao Paulo. But this could also indicate his growing hunger for a win ‚Äî or at least another podium ‚Äî possibly in Jakarta, before the season comes to a close. Evans had won the first edition of the Jakarta E-Prix in 2022, when three drivers crossed the line within a single second. The other two drivers were Jean-√âric Vergne and Edoardo Mortara, who took second and third positions in that Season 8 race.He also bagged the third spot on the podium in Race 2 of the Jakarta double-header in 2023. This makes him one of the strong contenders to make a comeback on the podium.Also Read: Jakarta E-Prix 2025: Schedule, how to watch Round 12 Formula E race, weather prediction Since Nick Cassidy and Sebastien Buemi have also ended their race droughts this year, one can expect a new winner in Jakarta as well. The E-Prix begins on Friday with the free practice session and will conclude on Saturday with the final race in the early evening. The heat is on ‚Äî but rain is likely, and that‚Äôs enough to add to the unpredictability factor.","Season 11 of the ABB FIA Formula E World Championship is coming to a close.

Gautam Gambhir horoscope | IND Coach Will Win At Least 1 ICC Trophy | StarPlay: Cricket & Astrology

India's head coach Gautam Gambhir 's pre-departure press conference set an aggressive tone for the Border Gavaskar Trophy , when he told former Australia captain Ricky Ponting to mind his own business and not question the form of Virat Kohli . In an expected retort, Ponting has said that he is not ""surprised"" about that reaction from a ""prickly character"".Gambhir threw his weight behind Kohli and skipper Rohit Sharma when quizzed about their poor run against Bangladesh and New Zealand in the home Test series before flying to Australia and also questioned Ponting for his comments.“What does Ponting have to do with Indian cricket?” Gambhir had said. ""He should think about Australian cricket. I don't have any concerns. They (Kohli and Rohit) are incredibly tough men; they've achieved a lot for Indian cricket and are going to achieve a lot in future as well.""In the three-Test series against New Zealand, which India lost 0-3, Rohit scored 91 runs and Kohli 93 in their respective six innings.Responding to Gambhir's comments, the 49-year-old Ponting told 7News: “I was surprised to read the reaction but knowing the coach, Gautam Gambhir ... he’s quite a prickly character, so I’m not surprised it was him who said something back.""Toning down his previous comment, the Australian added that his intentions were not to hit out at the former India captain.""In no way was it a dig at him (Kohli). I actually followed it up by saying he’s played well in Australia and he’ll be keen to bounce back over here...If you ask Virat, I'm sure he would be a little bit concerned that he hasn't been able to make the same amount of hundreds as he has in previous years,"" he said.""So it's amazing how little things can get cut up, but he's a class player and he's played well in Australia in the past.”Talking about Kohli's form in 2024, he has scored just 488 runs in 25 innings across formats in 19 international matches this year at an average of 20.33.Meanwhile, India had their first practice session at the WACA stadium in Perth on Tuesday and will open the series at the Optus Stadium in the same city on November 22.The five-Test series is crucial to India's chances of qualifying for the World Test Championship (WTC) after sliding to number two in the WTC points table.","Gautam Gambhir told Ricky Ponting to mind his own business and not question the form of Virat Kohli.

Premier India pacer to turn out for Bengal in Ranji game, reigniting talk of a possible late entry into India's Test squad in Australia

IND have what it takes to challenge this AUS team in upcoming #BGT | #beyondtheboundary

KOLKATA: India fast bowler Mohammed Shami is all set to play for Bengal in their next Ranji Trophy Elite Group 'C' game, putting to rest all speculation over his comeback plans after being left out of India's squad for the five-Test series for the Border-Gavaskar Trophy in Australia.Bengal will take on Madhya Pradesh in Indore from Wednesday.TOI has learnt that the 34-year-old pacer's movements will be closely monitored by physio Nitin Patel, who has travelled with the Uttar Pradesh-born cricketer and will be stationed in Indore over the next four days.Shami's fitness status was closely monitored ahead of India's BGT squad announcement but captain Rohit Sharma 's assertion that ""we don't want to take an undercooked Shami to Australia"" was indication the team management was not fully convinced about the fast bowler's Test-match recovery.Shami, however, was positive he could take the flight to Australia after playing a few Ranji matches. He can, however, play only one red-ball game to prove his fitness because the Ranji Trophy season will be played in two halves.In Shami's absence, India picked a largely inexperienced pace attack - including Akash Deep, Harshit Rana, Nitish Kumar Reddy and Prasidh Krishna - to back up Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Siraj. Mukesh Kumar, Navdeep Saini , and Khaleel Ahmed are in the reserves.The Bengal team management has said the Indian cricket board ( BCCI ) has not issued any guidelines or restrictions on Shami. ""We are happy to have him back,"" Bengal coach Laxmi Ratan Shukla told TOI from Indore. ""Shami was bowling at full throttle at the nets for some time and it will be good to see how he fares in a competitive match now.""Shami met his Bengal teammates in Bengaluru after the team's Ranji Trophy match against Karnataka last week. ""He was keen to make a comeback at that time, saying that he was feeling fine,"" Shukla stated.Shami has been sidelined for a year with an ankle injury. His name did not feature in the initial Bengal squad list but he made a late entry after getting the necessary clearance on Monday night from the National Cricket Academy (NCA), which had become almost his second home for the last six months as he rehabilitated from a surgery in February for an Achilles tendon injury which he carried into last year's ODI World Cup.In spite of not being at peak fitness, he ended up as the top wicket-taker in the World Cup with 24 scalps in seven matches.Shami had made steady progress and last month announced that he was ""100 per cent pain-free"" after bowling with full run-up at the Chinnaswamy Stadium following the conclusion of the first Test between India and New Zealand. He has always maintained that ""it's better that I play one or two domestic matches before going to Australia"".It was anticipated that Shami would be able to return in time for the red ball in Test cricket has been quite phenomenal,"" Ponting said.""You talk to all the players that face him as well, they talk about how hard and difficult he is. And then, when you think about where the first two Tests are (in Perth and Adelaide), he'd be perfectly suited to bowling in those conditions. So, I think that's the only real chink in India's armour,"" Ponting said.It remains to be seen if Shami will get on the flight to Australia if he performs well for Bengal.",Mohammed Shami set to play for Bengal in their next Ranji Trophy Elite Group 'C' game.

NEW DELHI: Former Australia pacer Brett Lee believes India underestimated New Zealand, leading to their 0-3 defeat in the home Test series. India's batters, struggling against New Zealand spinners Mitchell Santner and Ajaz Patel , were unable to find answers, resulting in repeated low scores in the series. Lee pointed out that India may have entered the series with overconfidence due to their strong home record.On his YouTube channel, Lee said, ""They went into the series thinking that we'll just whitewash the Kiwis, thinking that's going to be an easy series. And that's no disrespect to the Kiwis. It's just that India are so powerful, so strong on home soil. The Kiwis caught India off-guard.""The former fast bowler highlighted a concerning pattern in India's batting approach, which lacked patience. He suggested that India's aggressive mindset may have backfired as they forced their game against the disciplined Kiwi bowlers.With the Border-Gavaskar Trophy on the horizon, starting on November 22 in Perth, Lee remains confident that India can bounce back and prepare themselves for the crucial series against Australia.""This is a great learning curve for all out there. Probably not for Aussies because now they've got to understand that India will be much-better prepared. They are going to come in strong. They would have got a kick up the backside from their coach, Gautam Gambhir . This is atrocious, the way they played but they are still a team of champions. They have had a downfall over the last couple of weeks; it does happen in cricket,"" Lee added.Lee also weighed in on the poor form of Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli , both of whom have struggled with the bat this year. He advised the duo to take time off, refresh, and focus on refining their techniques ahead of the Australian series.""When you have a couple of bad runs back-to-back, that's when the pressure could set in. I guess the thing now is someone like Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma just have to go back to the drawing board. Work on that technique, freshen up, get away from cricket as much as they can and then hit the ground running when they go to Australia, because I can promise you - these Australian fast bowlers will attack Rohit Sharma with that brand new ball,"" Lee warned.With a spot in the World Test Championship final up for grabs, Lee believes India will come back stronger and well-prepared for the upcoming series against Australia.","Brett Lee believes India underestimated New Zealand, leading to their 0-3 defeat in the home Test series. Lee points out that India may have entered the series with overconfidence due to their strong home record.

NEW DELHI: Paul Adams, a former South African Test cricketer, believes Australian spinner Nathan Lyon is a more ""complete"" bowler than his Indian counterpart Ravichandran Ashwin . Adams made this statement on Tuesday while discussing the upcoming Border-Gavaskar Test series between India and Australia.Both Lyon and Ashwin are considered among the best spinners in contemporary cricket, with over 500 Test wickets each. However, Adams believes Lyon's ability to adapt to different conditions gives him an edge.""I still think Nathan Lyon has a more complete game in terms of competing in the subcontinent and in Australia or South Africa, those types of conditions, than Ashwin,"" Adams was quoted as saying by PTI.Adams, known for his unorthodox ""frog in a blender"" bowling action during his playing days, highlighted Lyon's ability to generate overspin as a key factor. He contrasted this with Ashwin, whose carrom ball brings a different dimension to his bowling.Adams also commented on the absence of Indian fast bowler Mohammed Shami from the upcoming series against Australia. He believes Shami's absence will be felt by the Indian team, particularly on Australian pitches.""I think he (Shami) will be a major miss for India, given the Australian conditions,"" said Adams.The former South African cricketer expects Indian all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja to play a significant role in Shami's absence, shouldering additional responsibility in the bowling department.","Former South African Test cricketer Paul Adams believes Nathan Lyon is a more ""complete"" bowler than Ravichandran Ashwin.

NEW DELHI: The big-ticket Border-Gavaskar Trophy has become one of cricket's most iconic Test rivalries, pitting India against Australia in a clash of contrasting styles.Named after two cricketing greats, Allan Border and Sunil Gavaskar, the series has seen incredible displays of skill, resilience, and determination.Over the years, the Border-Gavaskar Trophy has evolved into a platform where batsmen have risen to extraordinary challenges, fighting in the swing and seam-friendly pitches of Australia to spin-laden tracks in India.From iconic knocks in the heat of Chennai to match-winning innings in the cauldrons of Melbourne, the batsmanship at display in the series has been nothing short of marvelous.As the countdown to BGT 2024-25 tickles down, here's a look at the all-time the top 10 run-getters:Legendary Sachin Tendulkar sits right at the top pile 3262 runs in the India vs Australia BGT series. In the 34 matches that Sachin featured between 1996 and 2013 in the series, he had 9 tons and 16 half-centuries to name. The batting maestro had a stupendous average of 56.24 and had a highest score of 241 not out, which was also his highest Test total in an innings. Sachin was also dismissed for a duck four times in the series.Australian great Ricky Ponting is second behind Sachin on the list of most run-getters in the India vs Australia BGT series. In the 29 Tests that Ponting was part of in the rivalry, he scored 2555 runs at a stunning average of 54.36. Ponting notched up 8 centuries and 12 fifties while he too like Sachin was dismissed 4 times for a duck in the series. The former Australian captain had a highest score of 257 in the series.Batting maestro VVS Laxman had a special relation with Australia. Whenever the Aussies were against him, Laxman was at his absolute best. In the 29 Tests Laxman played against Australia between 1998-2012, he scored 2434 runs at an average of 49.67. Laxman's epic -- one of the greatest knocks in Test cricket's history -- knock of 281 in Kolkata came against the Aussies. Laxman had 6 centuries and 12 fifties to his name against Australia.'The Wall' Rahul Dravid was another Indian batter, who scored heavily against Australia. In the 32 matches between 1996-2012, Dravid amassed 2143 runs that came at an average of close to 40. He had a couple of hundreds and 13 fifties to his name and a highest score of 233 against the Aussies.Former captain Michael Clarke sits fifth on the list with 2049 runs in 22 Tests played between 2004-2014. With the highest score of 329 not out, Clarke is the lone triple centurion in India vs Australia Tests. The top-order batter had 6 tons and 7 fifties to his name against India and boasted an average of 53.92.Cheteshwar Pujara was the hero of India's 2018-19 Border-Gavaskar Trophy triumph Down Under where he smashed 521 runs in the single series. Overall, in 24 Tests that Pujara played against the Australians between 2010 and 2023, he scored 2033 runs at a stunning average of 50.82. He had 5 centuries and 11 fifties to his name and had the highest score of 204.Australia has been superstar Virat Kohli's favourite country where he has had tremendous success over the years. Since 2011, Kohli has been part of 24 Tests against Australia and has 1979 runs to his name at an average of 48.26. Kohli has scored 8 tins and 5 fifties against Australia in the longest format and has a top score of 186. Kohli currently sits at the 7th spot on the list of most run-getters in BGT and will look to climb further up the ladder in the upcoming tour.Former Australian opener Matthew Hayden looked at his absolute best when playing against India. In the 18 Tests Hayden featured between 2001 and 2008, he scored 1888 runs at a jaw-dropping average of 59. Hayden scored 6 tons and 8 fifties against India and was dismissed for a duck twice.Just like Virat Kohli, eyes will also be on Steve Smith in the upcoming Border-Gavaskar Trophy as he will also be looking to climb up the ladder of most run getters in the iconic rivalry. In the 18 Tests Smith has played so far between 2013-2023, the right-hander has 1887 runs to his name at a stunning average of 65.06. Smith has so far hit 8 tons and 5 fifties in Tests against India.Explosive former India opener Virender Sehwag sits 10th on the list with 1738 runs in 22 matches. Sehwag boasted an average of 41.38 and had 3 tons and 9 fifties to his name against the Aussies. Sehwag had the highest score of 195 and was also dismissed for a duck thrice against Australia.",The Border-Gavaskar Trophy has become one of cricket's most iconic Test rivalries.

Virat & Rohit’s Home Struggles: Left-Arm Spin & Lost Intent? | Beyond the Boundary Highlights

NEW DELHI: The year was 1996. Even though Feroz Shah Kotla Stadium in New Delhi, now called the Arun Jaitley Stadium, still referred to as 'Kotla' by the locals, had hosted 23 Tests, it wasn't a venue cricket enthusiasts had on their wishlists. Kotla was in urgent need of care despite being one of the venues of the ODI World Cup the same year. The players seeking a foray into international cricket or a farewell, didn't necessarily mind the setting.That would have been the case for Australia's Brad Hogg and India's David Johnson in October, who made their debuts. Meanwhile, Peter McIntyre played his last for Australia.India and Australia had played 12 series before this, starting in 1947/48, with the Aussies winning six and India just once - under the leadership of Sunil Gavaskar in 1979.This series, helmed by Mark Taylor and Sachin Tendulkar, had a different look and feel. Instead of the multi-match format, it was going to be a one-off Test. The fewest matches in a series played between these two were three, while the most were five.More importantly, the series had been branded as Border-Gavaskar Trophy named after legends from both countries - Allan Border and Sunil Gavaskar. In so doing, it had joined the likes of Anthony De Mello Trophy (between India and England), Frank Worrell Trophy (between Australia and West Indies), Wisden Trophy (between England and West Indies), Trans-Tasman Trophy (between Australia and New Zealand) and of course the iconic Ashes (between Australia and England) to get a name attached to itself.Fitting for the occasion, a gluttony of players were making their debut at First-Class level or featuring in a Test in India for the first time. Besides Johnson and Hogg, others that adorned this list included Ian Healy, Taylor, Mark Waugh, Paul Reiffel, Sourav Ganguly, Michael Slater, Glenn McGrath, Venkatesh Prasad, Michael Bevan, McIntyre, Ricky Ponting, Rahul Dravid, Vikram Rathour and Sunil Joshi.The one that stood out, though, was Nayan Mongia , playing his 14th Test for India. The wicketkeeper-batter had top-scored with 80 runs against West Indies by then. But he was more renowned for being a safe pair of hands behind the stumps. Having succeeded Kiran More, Mongia was believed to have entered a line of fine Indian wicketkeepers after Farokh Engineer and Syed Kirmani. He was steady with the gloves to both spin and pace.As a batter, he was known for being a tough character when the challenge presented itself. Against Australia, he was presented with such a daunting aspect. Having otherwise been a middle-order batter, he was lately elevated to the opening slot.""I was told well in advance that I'm going to open the innings. I knew how to play the new ball from junior cricket and Ranji Trophy so I had some idea. I was well prepared but not well prepared to get 100 or 150! But otherwise my job was to make sure the new ball gets old,"" recalled Mongia in an exclusive conversation with""To get 100 as an opener, you know, in a Test match it's always a pleasure. And getting a Man of the Match as a wicketkeeper that time (was rare). In a Test match, even if you took five-six catches, you don't get Man of the Match unless you score 100 or match-winning 50 or match-winning innings. So 100 was a big thing... 150 in fact. It was a big hundred,"" added Mongia.Mongia slogged it out for three days straight in the process. He started by keeping wickets as Australia batted first and scored 182 with Slater top-scoring as Anil Kumble took four wickets in the first innings, and collected nine wickets in total.Then 26 years old, Mongia would bat on for over eight hours for his 366-ball 152. ""Yeah, my fitness was always good. I used to do a lot of running, and do a lot of training. So that kept me going, from childhood - from under-15, under-19 age group I was doing a lot of training. (A) Keeper has to have good fitness - 90% (of the job) was doing keeping and then batting.""At Under-19 and Ranji Trophy, I used to open or bat at No. 3, so for that I need to have good fitness. If you have good fitness then only you will be able to do more concentration. Running was the main thing. I used to run for half-an-hour or 40 minutes every day,"" said Mongia who would retire after 44 Tests, rather prematurely many feel.Australia, still a key Test side back then, and a bigger player in money-churning quarters of cricket than India, chose to travel to the Asian sub-continent for just one contest as the series found a new name.Now, the tables have shifted. India are the bigger beast at the ICC and in producing money in the sport. So, for the first time since the 1991-92 season, India and Australia will indulge in a five-match Test series starting November 22. The BGT will go around Perth, Adelaide, Brisbane, Melbourne and Sydney.Did Mongia envision the series getting this big and becoming such a rivalry? ""Not really because the main rivalry was India-Pakistan that time still. Australia (rivalry) was just growing up. Slowly West Indies cricket team went low. Pakistan had some internal problems,"" said the former stumper.""Border-Gavaskar Trophy gave a platform to have such a huge rivalry. Both the teams are very highly competitive and (have) top-class players in both sides. It's great fun to play this kind of series. You try to give your best shot and you make (your) country proud. You make your name in cricket when you play against these two countries,"" he added.With India going for three away Border-Gavaskar Trophy wins in a row, they do so on the back of a dreadful show with the bat against New Zealand which resulted in a 0-3 humbling at home.""It is going to be 50-50 for me right now, looking at India's performance and Indian batsmen are struggling. Playing against Australia in Australia is not going to be easy. But we have top-class bowlers as well. We will miss Mohammed Shami, there is no doubt about it. But we have other good bowlers who can step up leading from the front. Mohammed Siraj is there. Other young bowlers are there. But if you want to win a Test match, you have to put runs on the board and the batsmen have to come good,"" he concluded.","Nayan Mongia scored his first, and only, century of Test career against Australia in 1996.

NEW DELHI: Team India's decision to cancel their practice match in Australia did not sit well with cricket legend Sunil Gavaskar , who called the move ""beyond belief.""The team's initial plan included a practice match against India A at the WACA ground ahead of their opening Test match , which begins on November 22 at Perth Stadium.""For Indian cricket's sake (I hope) whoever has taken the call to do away with the warm-up game and then reduce the match between the first and second Test against the Australian Prime Minister's XI to two days will be proven right,"" Gavaskar wrote in his column for Mid-Day.Gavaskar stated that the batters needed the practice game in Australia, especially given their struggles at home against New Zealand.""To be fair, the Indians did score over 400 in the second innings (of the first Test) in Bangalore, but after that, in four innings they looked utterly clueless against a spin attack that by no stretch of imagination was so dangerous that India couldn't chase 150 in the fourth innings. Yes, there was turn on offer, but again the pitches were not impossible to play on,"" he said.""That is why the cancellation of the team's warm-up game in Perth against the India 'A' team beggars belief. There is no better feeling for a batter to spend time out in the centre and feel the ball hit the middle of the bat. No amount of net practice is ever going to replace that feeling of flow and bat speed that one gets even after a short stay at the crease.""Gavaskar emphasized the importance of playing in real practice matches over just facing bowlers in net sessions. He acknowledges that some may argue that 'A' team bowlers might hold back against top players in practice games to avoid injuries, but he points out that in the nets, batters often face less prepared pitches and bowlers who sometimes bowl no-balls without penalty.""Yes, there's a possibility that the 'A' team new ball bowlers may not go flat out because of the worry of injuring a key batter, but that's more likely to happen in the nets where the pitches are usually not as well prepared as in a match and where the bowlers bowl no-balls without any repercussion. The batters know that in the nets they can be dismissed three or more times and yet continue to bat and then play with no tension or pressure at all. So temperamentally, it's never going to be the same as playing in a proper match,"" he said.""For the bowlers too, getting into a proper rhythm with run-up and get confident about not overstepping is crucial. What line and length to bowl is also something that one can learn in a proper game and not in the nets.""","Team India's decision to cancel their practice match in Australia did not sit well with cricket legend Sunil Gavaskar.

'I am not facing any heat': Coach Gautam Gambhir

'Transition or not, seniors are hungry to succeed'

MUMBAI: Despite their recent slump in form, India's head coach Gautam Gambhir is standing firmly behind veterans, skipper Rohit Sharma and star batter Virat Kohli , whose places in the team have come under scrutiny.As India prepared to leave for Australia for the much anticipated Border-Gavaskar Trophy-a five-Test series for the first time since 1991-92- Gambhir, in characteristic style, fired back at Australian legend Ricky Ponting for questioning Kohli's form and place in the Indian team, suggesting Ponting should focus on cricket in his country.Ponting had voiced concerns about Kohli's prolonged slump, noting that the great batter has scored only two Test centuries in the last five years. Nonetheless, Ponting also backed the former India captain to roar back to form against Australia in Australia, given that he loves playing against the Aussies, and has a great record in Australia.""What does Ponting have to do with Indian cricket?"" Gambhir questioned during a media interaction on Monday. ""I think he should think about Australian cricket. More importantly, I have got no concerns whatsoever for Virat and Rohit.""Kohli has averaged merely 22.72 in six matches in 2024, the lowest in his career. The 36-year-old has scored just one fifty this year - 70 against New Zealand in the second innings of the first Test at Bengaluru, while his last Test century came in July 2023 against the West Indies. Kohli scored 93, and Rohit 91 runs in the India's humiliating 0-3 Test series loss to New Zealand at home.When asked if the senior batters' poor form is a concern, Gambhir was quick to reply, ""Not at all."" ""They are incredibly tough men. They have achieved a lot for Indian cricket, and they will continue to achieve a lot in future as well. For me, the most important thing is that they still work really hard, and they are still passionate, they still want to achieve a lot more and that is something which is very important,"" he stressed.As a head coach, Gambhir is bound to have a sense of deja vu as he boards the flight to Australia. He was a part of a team full of veteran players, which crumbled and went through a complete transition after the high of the 2011 World Cup with a new coach Duncan Fletcher in charge.Asked if he was feeling the pressure like Fletcher, Gambhir replied: ""I am not thinking about transition but the five Tests. Transition or no transition, if that has to happen, will happen but I see some incredibly tough characters in that dressing room who are hungry to do well. The only thing in my mind is, we are going to Australia to play five Test matches.""Batting continuously for senior pros Rohit and Kohli , the former India opener said it was the media which was obsessed with the word ""transition"".""You guys can keep talking about the transition and all that stuff. For me, they are still very hungry. I am sure they have got a lot of fire to achieve a lot of success for the nation and you should never doubt their passion for the country,"" Gambhir said.Reflecting on his own career values, Gambhir said, ""I've told them to put the team above personal milestones."" When asked if he felt pressure following India's recent home defeat to New Zealand, Gambhir replied, ""What difference does it make? Tell me, social media, what difference does it make in my life and for that matter, anyone's life?Gambhir made it clear that when he accepted the job, he was aware that coaching India would not be an easy task.""When I took up this job, I always thought that it was going to be a highly difficult job and highly prestigious job as well. I don't think as if I am feeling the heat because my job is to be absolutely honest and there are some incredibly tough people in that dressing room who have achieved some great things for the country and will continue to achieve some great things for the country. It is an absolute honour to be coaching them and coaching India,"" he said.Gambhir admitted that he was open to the criticism following the New Zealand series loss, saying he's ""ready to accept it with both hands.""However, he expressed confidence in India's ability to tackle Australia's fast and bouncy tracks. ""We don't control what wickets they give. It is their wish, whatever they want to dish us with. We are absolutely ready to play in any kind of conditions and we have got all the bases (covered) out. What difference does it make whether they give us a turning track or bouncy tracks or green wickets?""",Head coach Gautam Gambhir says he is not facing any heat from media. Says he has 'no concerns whatsoever' for Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma. Says it was the media which was obsessed with the word 'transition',"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115198426,imgsize-85072,width-400,resizemode-4/115198426.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Former South African spinner Paul Adams has commended the Delhi Capitals for their strategic decision to retain South African batsman Tristan Stubbs for the IPL 2025 season.Amid significant roster changes, including the release of ex-captain Rishabh Pant , Stubbs's retention depicts the franchise's confidence in his abilities.""It was a calculated move from Delhi Capitals, indeed Stubbs is one of the few players who is young and will be in the long run for the franchise and he has proven his credentials. He has been batting beautifully not only in the limited format but also in the Test, we all saw what classy innings he played against Bangladesh, so having a young hard-hitting batter and a terrific fielder in your side will always benefit the franchise. He is the future of Delhi Capitals,"" Adams told IANS.The 22-year-old has impressed in previous seasons with his aggressive batting and efficient fielding, marking three half-centuries in his IPL career.For the 2025 season, alongside Stubbs, Delhi Capitals have also retained Axar Patel Kuldeep Yadav , and uncapped player Abishek Porel, aiming to solidify their core team. They will be looking to fill the remaining slots in the squad during the upcoming mega IPL auction on November 24 and 25.""With Axar, Kuldeep and Porel other in the retention list, DC actually has tried to retain their core strength, but with Rishabh going out it will be interesting to see who will lead the team,"" he added.Stubbs, who made his IPL debut in 2022, has scored 405 runs in 18 matches at an average of 36.82, including three fifties. Acquired for Rs 50 lakh in the 2024 IPL Auction, his performance showcases his potential as a long-term asset for the team.Adams also heaped praise on the emergence of young talent like Gerald Coetzee and praised the SA20 tournament for its positive impact on South African cricket , attributing part of its success to the involvement of IPL franchises.""Gerald Coetzee’s been around here, played from the under-19s system all the way through, always able to contribute as well with the bat. And his innings the other night was absolutely amazing. Coming in, taking that pressure immediately off Tristan Stubbs. So having a player like that down the order and also South Africa to be able to have the batting depth these days within the T20 setup is important,"" Adams added.""It allows batters to continue to keep going hard. And also you've got to understand that the game's never finished. Gone are the days of that. You've got to make sure that you've got length in your batting and be able to have batters down the order that can clear the ropes. And we had to see what Gerald is capable of.”",Tristan Stubbs has been retained by Delhi Capitals for the IPL 2025 season.

But this has now been put on a hold, informed an ICC insider.South Africa not being discussed as optionNotwithstanding the reports in some sections in media that South Africa could be an option to host the next Champions Trophy, this option was still not talked about in any serious manner within the ICC, an insider tracking the developments claimed.The schedule is not confirmed, ICC is still in discussions and dialogue with the host and participating nations. South Africa has not been discussed as yet, the insider said.The PCB on Sunday had confirmed that it received an email from the ICC that India declined to travel to the neighbouring country.India have not travelled to Pakistan since the 2008 Mumbai terror strikes.

Manchester United's wait is over as the Ruben Amorim era begins,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/manchester-uniteds-wait-is-over-as-the-ruben-amorim-era-begins/articleshow/115182192.cms,"Ruben Amorim (AP Photo)

A new era begins at Manchester United as Ruben Amorim becomes the latest coach to take on the challenge of reviving the storied English club.After more than a decade of on-field decline the 20-time English champion has turned to a 39-year-old Portuguese who has delivered trophies and a thrilling style of soccer to Sporting Lisbon , but takes over a club that has made a habit of wrecking even the biggest reputations.High-caliber managers have come and gone, more than $1 billion has been spent on player signings, yet United just can't seem to get it right.""If anybody knew the answer (for that), we wouldn't have had the last 10, 11 years,"" Andy George, a 40-year-old United fan from Worcestershire, told The Associated Press. ""I always back the manager ... but it needs to work now.""George said he had been a supporter for 30 years and traveled around 100 miles (160 kilometers) for last week's 2-0 win against PAOK in the Europa League.Proven winner Amorim - a former Portugal international - was Lisbon coach from 2020 and ended its 19-year wait for the Portuguese title in 2021. He won it again in 2024 and his achievements led to links with jobs at Liverpool , Manchester City and Barcelona before he was hired to replaceErik ten Hag at the start of the month.""I'm not naive, I know that it's going to be very different, very tough,"" Amorim said Sunday after his final game with Sporting. ""But I feel that I'm ready. I'm at peace now, I can focus on my new job.""He is United's sixth permanent coach since club great Alex Ferguson retired in 2013 after winning his 13th Premier League title. Ferguson won 28 major trophies, including two Champions Leagues, and his record has cast a shadow over all of his successors.David Moyes was the first to try to step into his shoes, lasted eight months and began what has been a cycle of hiring, firing and reboots in an attempt to return the club to its past glories.Since then United has gone through Champions League winners (Louis van Gaal and Jose Mourinho), an iconic former player (Ole Gunnar Solskjaer) and one of Europe's emerging coaching talents (Ten Hag), but has not been able to stop City from dominating English soccer, while Liverpool, Chelsea and even Leicester have lifted the title in that time.High expectations United hopes Amorim will be the man to finally break the cycle.""We cannot ignore how he has changed Sporting,"" United midfielder Casemiro said Sunday. ""We know that Sporting won many titles, changed the club with titles, with trophies. He has already proved that he is a coach that has won a lot.""Amorim made a spectacular statement even before officially taking up his new role when, while serving out his notice at Lisbon, his team routed City 4-1 in the Champions League last week.""I was like, 'Oh, my gosh!' I lost my mind,"" said Joshua Hanley, a United fan from Kansas City who had flown to England to watch the PAOK game. ""We were changing airplanes and I'm sitting there kind of watching the score on my phone.""It was a fantastic start.""Amorim joked that he would be considered the new Ferguson if he beat City.Hanley's expectations are more modest to begin with.""If we can make top six, it would be a fantastic end of the season,"" he said, adding that he wants Amorim to ""make football exciting again"".New structure Amorim is the first head coach hired since British billionaire Jim Ratcliffe became a minority owner of United in February, assumed control of soccer operations and installed a new leadership team as part of his overhaul.Chief exectuive Omar Berrada was lured from City and sporting director Dan Ashworth came from Newcastle. Dave Brailsford, who helped Britain become a global force in cycling, is a director on United's soccer board.While Ten Hag was given a contract extension following an end of season review in the summer, he was appointed under a former regime. United's woeful start to the campaign - losing four of its opening nine league games - ultimately cost him.Amorim has the benefit of being chosen by United's new hierarchy and the final piece of leadership team assembled by Ratcliffe, which should afford him time implement his plans.Ambition Not that he is likely to get a free pass this season. The timing of the decision to fire Ten Hag could be considered instructive in terms of United's ambition.There have only been 11 rounds of the league campaign and Amorim takes over a team that, although 13th in the standings, is only four points off third place. It also remains in three cup competitions.Champions League qualification remains very much in play and after United spent around $230 million on transfers in the offseason, Amorim will be expected to quickly deliver winning soccer to a club that has been playing catchup for too long.In the long term, the challenge is to return United to the summit of English and European soccer - a task that has proved beyond any of his last five predecessors.",Ruben Amorim becomes Manchester United's sixth permanent coach since Alex Ferguson retired in 2013.

The match witnessed an early goal from Hugo Boumous in the fourth minute, while Manvir Singh found the equaliser for the visitors in the 36th, keeping the spectators engaged throughout the 90 minutes.Mohun Bagan had the lion's share of possession (61%) and 11 corners to Odisha's nil, but they failed to convert those into goals as the Kalinga Warriors dug deep to soak in the pressure and charge on the counterattack. Couple of good attempts by former Bagan striker Roy Krishna and midfielder Lalthathanga Khawlhring, aka Puitea, for the hosts went abegging as the scoreline stayed level till the final whistle.The hosts, Odisha FC, drew first blood when their midfield maestro, Hugo Boumous, found the back of the net with a well-placed right-footed shot from close range. The goal came after a set-piece situation inside the box, with Ahmed Jahouh providing the assist with a fine touch. The ball took a deflection off a MBSG defender before nestling into the back of the net, leaving goalkeeper Vishal Kaith with no chance of making a save.Odisha FC's resolute defence, led by the towering presence of Mourtada Fall, stood tall against the fancied MBSG attack, which had scored 12 goals before this encounter. The young Odisha backline thwarted the visitors' attempts to find an equaliser, frustrating their potent attacking force.However, MBSG's persistent threat paid off when Manvir Singh restored parity for the Mariners. The winger's well-timed header from the centre of the box found the bottom-right corner, leaving Odisha goalkeeper Amrinder Singh helpless despite getting his hands to the ball. The assist came from the pivotal midfielder Dimitri Petratos, who delivered a precise cross following a corner kick. Saviour Gama, who had conceded the corner, was stationed on the goal line but could not prevent the header from crossing the line.The first half ended with the scores level at 1-1, setting the stage for an exciting second period. Both teams displayed resilience and determination, with Odisha backline standing firm against MBSG's relentless attacks, while the visitors' defence remained vigilant to thwart any potential threats from the hosts.In the end, the tie ended in a keenly-fought draw.While Odisha FC will be pleased with their defensive resilience after conceding 13 goals before this game, MBSG will rue their missed chances to secure all three points. With one point from their seventh game MBSG consolidated their second place on the league table with 14 points while Odisha remained on ninth spot with nine points after eight games.","Mohun Bagan Super Giant (MBSG) and Odisha FC (OFC) played out an enthralling 1-1 draw in Bhubaneswar on Sunday.

"From grassroots to elite, Mumbai's IOT FC for record-breaking journey",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/from-grassroots-to-elite-mumbais-iot-fc-for-record-breaking-journey/articleshow/115144417.cms,"Gaining three or more promotions in consecutive years in professional football is an exceptional achievement. Mumbai’s India On Track Football Club (IOT FC) has achieved this distinction in the last five years — rising from the lowest rung of the Mumbai Football League to the top at a breakneck speed. IOT FC is a grassroots football club founded in 2018, which has quickly become one of the most exciting teams in Mumbai football.In just four years, this senior men’s team has risen through the ranks of the Mumbai Football Association (MFA), achieving an unprecedented record: four consecutive league promotions in four seasons. In the 2024-25 season, this small club is going for a bigger record — winning the Mumbai Premier League, the top-tier football league and making it five in a row in the Mumbai Football Association’s Mumbai Football League, the second oldest football league in Asia after the Calcutta Football League Football leagues are usually organised in a pyramid system, so a club has to win the division or go through playoffs every year to achieve promotion to the higher division. Very few clubs around the world have managed to climb from the lowest to the top tier in a short period, clearing four divisions in four years. IOT FC is one of those that has achieved this feat. IOT FC’s story is one of grit, determination, and unparalleled consistency.They started their training sessions on Mumbai’s Juhu Beach, as there was no available ground for them to book. Yet, they rose through the ranks, achieving what only a few clubs, even on a global scale, can claim to have achieved. The club has been promoted four seasons in a row – a rare feat that only 15 other clubs in the world have managed to achieve joining the likes of Grazer AK (Austria), SV Rodinghausen and TV Herkenrath (Germany), SC Sagamihara and Iwaki FC (Japan), among others. What is remarkable is that IOT FC is one of the few clubs to do so in the last five years, further underscoring the magnitude of their achievement.What makes their achievements particularly noteworthy is that the club has made such progress without its own football ground, with the help of local talent, and without the financial clout enjoyed by other clubs in the top divisions of MFA. They have managed to keep their success graph despite the disruption caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.“We, as a club, have always been aligned to set winning processes. Although the intangibles of this process have been our values of commitment, honesty, sacrifice, and welfare of players and all people associated with the club. Hard work in training, opposition scouting, a clear tactical plan, game management, and the intangibles have made us successful so far,” says IOT FC head coach Yash Shah.After clinching four promotions in four years -- IOT has won one title and finished in the top two to gain automatic promotion in three others, the club will now be competing against the best football teams in Mumbai, showcasing the same drive, discipline and flair that have made them a formidable force in Mumbai football.What sets IOT FC apart is not just their impressive record but the values and vision that underpin the club. As a grassroots football organisation, the club was founded to nurture and develop local talent, and it continues to be a platform for aspiring footballers to grow and achieve their full potential. Their rapid rise through the MFA leagues is a testament not only to the talent and skill of the players but also to the dedication and strategic planning of the club’s management.IOT FC is more than just a football team; it is a symbol of ambition, resilience, and community. Their success has inspired countless young footballers across Mumbai, demonstrating what is possible when passion and hard work come together. As the team prepares to face Mumbai’s top clubs in the Premier League, they do so as a club that has earned the respect of both players and fans alike.“With India On Track FC, we set out to prove that grassroots football, when done right, when done with the values of discipline, integrity and a winning mindset, can achieve remarkable results. Our mission was to combine professional training with strong values, and I’m incredibly proud of how far we’ve come. Watching the team succeed season after season is a testament to that original vision, and we’re really looking forward to how IOT FC will grow, how its players will develop, and the opportunities we can give them for new beginnings, constant improvement, and a positive team environment,” says Gaurav Modwel, Chairman of IOT, who was previously the CEO of Pune City FC, a club that competed in the Indian Super League (ISL).At Pune City FC, he was instrumental in establishing the club’s presence and fostering a competitive football culture, and further influenced and impacted Indian sport, especially football, because of his deep focus on youth sports development. As IOT FC’s campaign in the Mumbai Premier League gathers pace, the focus is on maintaining the momentum that has carried them through four consecutive league titles. They are in Group B of the 18-team league and in the top half after three rounds and on course to achieving their ambition.The club’s ambition is not limited to just this season; they have their sights set on building a long-term legacy in Mumbai football and beyond. With a squad brimming with talent and a coaching team that has guided them to success year after year, IOT FC is well-positioned to continue their winning ways. This season, however, will be their toughest test yet. Competing against Mumbai’s elite, IOT FC will need to bring their very best to the pitch. But with the team’s track record, there is every reason to believe that they will rise to the challenge and continue to defy expectations.As the Mumbai Premier League gets underway, football fans across the city are eager to see whether IOT FC can make history by securing their fifth consecutive title. Whatever the outcome, one thing is certain: IOT FC is a club that has already made an indelible mark on Indian football, and their story is far from over.""It’s not just about winning titles – it’s about fostering a culture of excellence, discipline, and integrity. We want to give athletes the platform to realise their full potential and, in doing so, elevate Indian football, create team India’s next generation of players, and put India on the global stage,"" says Modwel.","India On Track Football Club (IOT FC) is a Mumbai-based grassroots football club.

ATP Finals: Jannik Sinner outshines Taylor Fritz at home; Daniil Medvedev finds form against Alex de Minaur,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/atp-finals-jannik-sinner-outshines-taylor-fritz-at-home-daniil-medvedev-finds-form-against-alex-de-minaur/articleshow/115236180.cms,"Italy's Jannik Sinner reacts during the singles tennis match of the ATP World Tour Finals against United States' Taylor Fritz (AP Photo)

The football-like “Ole” chants. The vast array of fans dressed in his theme colour of orange. The banners and signs — one of which declared, “Sinner for president.”Late in the second set of his victory over Taylor Fritz at the ATP Finals on Tuesday, Jannik Sinner used all the adulation in his home country to his advantage.When the top-ranked player produced a backhand passing shot up the line while on the run, he held his finger up to his ear to encourage the crowd to cheer louder.“I read a little bit where he was playing and I just tried to pass him somehow because if not, it would have been a very easy volley for him,” Sinner said. “The crowd is helping me a lot. This is a very special occasion for me.“I’ve always liked playing at home. If you like the fans and the people supporting you, it’s a big help,” Sinner added.Sinner made it two wins in two matches before his home fans at the finals, beating Fritz 6-4, 6-4 in a rematch of the U.S. Open final that the Italian also won in straight sets.Sinner turned up his intensity when it mattered most. He survived a marathon service game midway through the first set then broke his American opponent with a huge forehand up the line on his first set point.During and after the match, the crowd inside Inalpi arena chanted, “Ole, Ole, Ole; Sin-ner, Sin-ner.”Sinner saved the only break point that he faced and nearly matched Fritz with six aces to the American’s seven.But Fritz tested Sinner over two close sets and thought his performance was a step up from the U.S. Open final.“There’s a lot of positives I can take out of it,” Fritz said. “For all of the match, I didn’t feel overwhelmed. I felt like I was right there.”Sinner, who beat Alex de Minaur in his opening match at the season-ending event for the top eight players, improved to 23-1 in his last five tournaments.Earlier, Daniil Medvedev moved back into contention with a 6-2, 6-4 victory over De Minaur following a temper tantrum in his previous match.Medvedev didn’t face a single break point and was generally much sharper than in his straight-set loss to Fritz on Sunday — during which he smashed his racket and lost his cool twice.Sinner leads the group while Fritz and Medvedev are next with one win each.De Minaur, who is making his debut at finals, lost both of his opening matches.The top two finishers from each round-robin group advance to the semifinals.On Thursday, Medvedev faces Sinner and De Minaur plays Fritz in the final matches of the group.In the other group on Monday, Alexander Zverev and Casper Ruud beat Andrey Rublev and Carlos Alcaraz, respectively.Sinner is playing at home for the first time since it was announced before his U.S. Open title that he tested positive in two separate drug tests this year.A decision to clear Sinner of wrongdoing was appealed by the World Anti-Doping Agency in September. A final ruling in the case is expected early next year.Medvedev had to ‘block the noise’ after temper tantrumWhen his match was over, Medvedev closed his eyes and held his fingers to his ears. Then he wrote on a camera lens, “Block the noise.”“I went into this match also blocking the noise even from myself,” Medvedev said. “No like tantrums and stuff. Just block the noise. And I really didn’t care what was happening on the court. I just tried to play and it was a good feeling.""Medvedev won the finals in 2020 — the last edition held in London.“The more popular you become, the more fans you get, the more haters you get, the more attention you get. And sometimes even the good noise can make you off balance,” Medvedev said.“You know, you win everything and everyone thinks you’re a god. ...

NEW DELHI: India's Rohan Bopanna and his Australian doubles partner Matthew Ebden began their ATP Finals with a loss in Turin.The pair lost their opening match in straight sets. The Indo-Australian team was defeated by the Italian duo of Simone Bolelli and Andrea Vavassori 2-6, 3-6.Interestingly, Bopanna and Ebden had beaten the same Italian team in the Australian Open final earlier this year.Seeded fourth, the Italian pair of Bolelli and Vavassori dominated the match from the start. They broke their opponents' serve in the second game to take an early lead.The Bopanna-Ebden pair faced another setback in the eighth game when a double fault allowed the Italians to break their serve again. This effectively ended any chances of a comeback for the duo.The Italians, supported by the home crowd, continued their dominance in the second set. They secured a crucial break in the fourth game, which proved decisive.Bopanna, participating in the tournament for the fourth time and Ebden couldn't match the intensity of their Italian opponents. The Bopanna-Ebden pair struggled throughout the match, failing to secure even a single break point.Their serve was also a cause for concern, winning only 58% of points on their first serve and 47% on their second serve. The Italians, on the other hand, were far more clinical with their serves. They won an impressive 89% of points on their first serve and 83% on their second serve.Bopanna and Ebden also committed two double faults during the match, both of which resulted in breaks of serve. This proved costly for the Indo-Australian pair.The loss marked Bopanna and Ebden’s third consecutive defeat against the Italian pair this year.Bopanna and Ebden are currently placed fourth in the Bob Bryan Group. They will face the top-seeded pair of Marcelo Arevalo from El Salvador and Mate Pavic from Croatia in their next group match on Wednesday.Bopanna and Ebden had a good run in the last edition of the tournament, reaching the semifinals. They will be hoping to repeat that performance this year, despite the opening loss.","Rohan Bopanna and Matthew Ebden lose opening match of ATP Finals.

Jannik Sinner officially became the first Italian tennis player to achieve the year-end No. 1 ranking on Monday during the ATP Finals in Turin.Sinner had already secured the top spot before the tournament began. He defeated Alex de Minaur from Australia on Sunday in his opening match at the season-ending event.The Italian succeeds Novak Djokovic of Serbia, who has concluded eight seasons as the top-ranked player. Former player Boris Becker presented Sinner with the award.""It's very special occasion to share that here in Italy,"" he said.""I would like to thank you for the support around the world, to thank my team. Without the people who are close to me, who understand me as a person, who I am, it would be very difficult,"" Sinner added, calling himself ""very lucky"".“I just heard that my mom was crying, which is something very cute,” Sinner said. “Only they know from my early age and stages, when I was around 13, how many sacrifices we made as a family.“Now I’m standing here with one of the, maybe the most special trophy I have.”On 10 June, Sinner became the first man or woman from Italy to reach World No. 1 in singles since computerised rankings were introduced in 1973. He has not relinquished that spot since.The 23-year-old is the 19th player to clinch the year-end No. 1 honour and just the fourth active player to do so. Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal and Carlos Alcaraz are the others.“It’s a great competition between this and Grand Slams,” Sinner said. “This is a very consistent trophy. You have to play one year very consistent tennis, so this is for sure a very, very tough trophy to get.”Sinner's season has been dogged by controversy after he twice tested positive for traces of the steroid clostebol in March.He was initially cleared by the International Tennis Integrity Agency but at the end of September the World Anti-Doping Agency appealed, seeking a ban of up to two years.Sinner won his first match at ATP Finals on Sunday against Alex De Minaur.Becker, who spent 221 days at No. 1 in 1991 but never ended a year on top, attended the presentation.He said that while ""there are certainly Carlos Alcaraz and others, Jannik is going to be world No.1 for a long time.""","Jannik Sinner becomes the first Italian tennis player to achieve the year-end No. 1 ranking.

Alexander Zverev opened his campaign at the ATP Finals in Turin on Monday evening by dispatching Andrey Rublev 6-4, 6-4 in their round-robin opener.In the afternoon match, Casper Ruud romped through the opening set before fighting back from 5-2 behind in the second to beat an out-sorts Carlos Alcaraz 6-1, 7-5 Germany's Zverev had last faced Russian Rublev at the same stage of the finals in 2023 and won by the same score.Zverev, a two-time winner of this event in 2018 and 2021, moved to second in the John Newcombe group, behind Norway's Ruud.The 27-year-old Zverev, the recent winner of the Paris Masters 1000, has climbed back to No.2 in the world this season. After an injury-hit 2022 season he had briefly dropped out of the top 25 in 2023.""I was never sure I was going to get back to this level,"" Zverev said on the court in Turin. ""Second year in a row for me here. I still want to get better. I still want to improve on a few things. We'll see how next year goes.""Rublev held to love in his first three service games. He won a 13th straight point on serve to open the crucial seventh game, but Zverev then won the next four to break to 15.Zverev did not allow a break point against his serve all match and converted immediately both times he had the chance.""I thought it was a very solid match from my end,"" said Zverev.""Andrey is an incredible player, but everyone who plays here is an unbelievable player.""Against anyone here, you have to play your best to have a chance, you have to be solid, mentally strong. I feel like I did that today, I felt like I used my chances quite well and I'm obviously happy with this win.""Earlier Alcaraz, the world number three got off to a shaky start to his maiden ATP Finals, making 34 unforced errors in an uncharacteristically errant display.""I'm tired. I'm tired mentally,"" said Alcaraz, who won the French Open and Wimbledon titles earlier this year.""Obviously a lot of matches, really tight schedule, really demanding year with not too many days off, not too many periods for you could rest.""Some players deal with it better than others.""Alcaraz said he had struggled with sickness and adapting to the indoor surface.""A few days before coming here, I got sick at home,"" said the Spaniard.""I don't like to sound like I'm making excuses but today I didn't feel well on court.""It doesn't matter the times I beat Casper. I have no experience playing on indoor courts. I have to be better on this part of the year that we play on indoor courts.""It was Ruud's first victory over 21-year-old Alcaraz in their five career meetings.""I knew he was dealing with a bit of a cold. I saw him sniffling in the back area and with a tissue for his nose, so that's a sign that maybe physically he won't be necessarily at 100 percent. Of course, that is sad, and not good for him, but at the same time it is part of the game.""The Norwegian had suffered seven defeats in his eight matches coming into this tournament.""This part of the season has not been good for me but hopefully I've saved some wins for this week and I've started well,"" said Ruud, the 2022 finals runner-up.","Alexander Zverev beats Andrey Rublev at the ATP Finals in Turin.

Zheng appeared to have lost a bit of her speed and Gauff took full advantage of the situation.The American made it four games in a row to put herself in the position to serve for the second set but couldn't close, as Zheng saved a pair of set points to peg her opponent back and break.

No off days as captain Shubman Gill, coach Gautam Gambhir arrive in Kolkata for Test series

Poll Should Dhruv Jurel be included in India's Test XI against South Africa? Yes, he's in great form! No, stick with the existing lineup. Depends on the batting order.

NEW DELHI: Former India captain Sourav Ganguly has joined the debate surrounding Dhruv Jurel's red-hot form and his potential inclusion in India's playing XI for the upcoming Test series against South Africa, starting November 14 at the Eden Gardens in Kolkata.Ganguly, speaking at an event, praised the young wicketkeeper-batter's purple patch but admitted that breaking into India's settled Test line-up will be a challenge.“He's playing well, isn't he? Rishabh is back and I don't know what the selectors are thinking. Basically, the spots are taken — two openers, (Shubman) Gill at four, Pant at five, KL (Rahul), (Ravindra) Jadeja are there. Players have performed. How easy will it be to open up a slot for Dhruv Jurel at this stage, I wouldn't know,” Ganguly said.“But it depends on whom they want to send at No. 3 — whether they want to go with Sai Sudharsan, or bring in our in-form Dhruv in. We'll find out.”The 24-year-old Jurel has made headlines with back-to-back centuries against South Africa A in Bengaluru, making a compelling case for selection. His remarkable consistency in red-ball cricket — over 1,000 runs in nine matches at an average above 80 — has turned him into one of India's most promising batting talents.The former skipper also tipped India as overwhelming favourites at home, highlighting the team's formidable spin attack and recent form.“Because India's spin attack is very good. And this young team went to England three months ago and played exceptionally well. It was a fantastic series — exceptional performances by Gill, Yashasvi (Jaiswal), Rahul, Pant. India are a bundle of talent,” Ganguly said.The two-match Test series will conclude in Guwahati from November 22 to 26, followed by a three-match ODI series.With Rishabh Pant returning from injury and Jurel in scintillating touch, the Indian selectors now face a happy headache — a contest between stability and form.","Former India captain Sourav Ganguly has joined the debate surrounding Dhruv Jurel's red-hot form and his potential inclusion in India's playing XI for the upcoming Test series against South Africa.

'Zero tolerance — no one is above the law'

'Allegations must be verified, but truth will prevail'

The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) has pledged “zero tolerance” in response to the shocking sexual harassment allegations made by national cricketer Jahanara Alam against former team selector and manager Manjurul Alam. BCB president Aminul Islam on Sunday said no one — whether a director, coach, or staff member — will be spared if found guilty after the ongoing investigation.The controversy erupted after Jahanara, speaking in an interview with journalist Riasad Azim, accused Manjurul of sexually harassing her during the 2022 ICC Women's World Cup in New Zealand. She alleged that the former selector made indecent advances and asked lewd, intrusive questions, including about her menstrual cycle. The fast bowler, who has represented Bangladesh in 135 international matches, claimed that other female cricketers had similar experiences but were afraid to speak up due to fear of professional repercussions.Following the explosive interview, several other former players voiced their own experiences, prompting the BCB to launch an official inquiry.BCB chief Aminul Islam reaffirmed that the board will act firmly once the investigation concludes.“You've asked a question, and here's my reply — zero tolerance. Thank you,” Aminul said, adding that the committee should be given time to complete its work.He clarified that no position within the board would offer immunity. “Even the Prime Minister of this country isn't exempt from such rules. We're just ordinary directors. If I go and harass someone, and it's proven to be true, then I'm just an ordinary director — not above the law,” he said.The board has constituted a three-member inquiry panel headed by retired Justice Tariq ul Hakim, with Rubaba Dowla, a newly appointed BCB director, and Barrister Sarwat Siraj Shukla, a senior advocate of the Supreme Court, as members. The committee has been given 15 working days to submit its report.Meanwhile, as per a Cricbuzz report, the BCB has placed four officials linked to women's cricket — manager S.M. Golam Faiyaz, physio Suraiya Akter, coach Mahmud Emon, and coordinator Sarfaraz Babu — on special duty (OSD) pending the inquiry.BCB facilities committee director Shanian Taneem, who sat beside Aminul during the press briefing, supported the president's statement, saying, “Whether it's an employee or a director, the investigation will cover everyone involved. If the committee recommends action, it will be implemented immediately. There will be no special treatment for anyone.”While affirming the board's zero-tolerance stance, Aminul also emphasised the need for a fair process. “If the allegations are true, they will not be tolerated. But since such investigations touch upon personal lives, it can harm those falsely accused. So they should be given five to seven days to defend themselves,” he said.The BCB's official statement echoed the same sentiment: “The BCB is committed to ensuring a safe, respectful, and professional environment for all its players and personnel. The board takes such matters with utmost seriousness and will take appropriate action based on the findings.”Manjurul, however, has denied the allegations, calling them “baseless” and “fabricated.”The case has sparked widespread debate in Bangladesh's cricketing circles, with calls for systemic reform and greater accountability in women's cricket. For now, all eyes are on the inquiry committee, whose findings could reshape the culture and governance of Bangladesh's women's cricket setup.",BCB chief Aminul Islam reaffirmed that the board will act firmly once the investigation concludes.

The Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ) president, Mithun Manhas , congratulated Delhi & District Cricket Association (DDCA) chief Rohan Jaitley as the Arun Jaitley Stadium achieved a significant milestone of hosting more than 300 first-class matches.“I would like to congratulate Rohan Jaitley, who is the President of the DDCA, and his entire team. More than 300 first-class matches have been played at the Arun Jaitley Stadium — in fact, I believe today marks the 302nd match. This is a remarkable achievement, and in my opinion, truly commendable, especially considering the efforts he has made since the affiliation. Once again, I would like to thank him wholeheartedly for inviting me on this special occasion, and I extend my warmest congratulations to him once again,” Manhas told IANS in an exclusive interaction on Sunday.Jaitley was recently appointed as the chair of the BCCI’s infrastructure committee after the board concluded its 94th Annual General Meeting in September. It was when Manhas was appointed president, succeeding Roger Binny in the role.The Infrastructure Committee is now headed by Jaitley, with his team comprising Manhas, Shukla, Saikia, Prabhtej Bhatia, A. Raghuram Bhat, Anirudh Chaudhury, and Sana Sathish Babu.Former BCCI president Binny previously held the position.Jaitley is in-charge of overseeing the country’s cricket grounds, focusing on building new ones and upgrading existing facilities where needed. In December last year, Jaitley was re-elected as the DDCA president, securing 1,577 votes against 777 for former India cricketer Kirti Azad.Recently, Jaitley and Manhas also met with Chief Minister Omar Abdullah to outline a roadmap for developing world-class infrastructure and nurturing young talent in Jammu and Kashmir, as part of a major push to strengthen cricketing facilities in the region.The BCCI delegation assured full support for upgrading the region’s cricketing ecosystem — including the establishment of modern training centres, better pitches, and advanced amenities at key venues such as Jammu and Srinagar.Chief Minister Abdullah welcomed the initiative and stressed that sports development plays a vital role in youth engagement and social cohesion. He appreciated the BCCI’s commitment to empowering local players and expanding opportunities for aspiring cricketers from the Union Territory.","Arun Jaitley Stadium has hosted more than 300 first-class matches.

NEW DELHI: The Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) president Sourav Ganguly confirmed on Monday that the Indian team management has not requested a rank turner pitch for the upcoming Test match against South Africa at Eden Gardens starting Friday.India head coach Gautam Gambhir inspected the pitch on Monday morning after arriving with the team from Australia, while curator Sujan Mukherjee indicated it would be a sporting wicket offering help to both batters and bowlers.Ganguly inspected the pitch later in the evening before it was covered to protect from dew and potential showers.""Well, they haven't asked for it yet. So, I won't be able to answer the question. It looks a very good one,"" Ganguly said regarding any requests for a turning wicket.Eden Gardens has hosted two Ranji Trophy matches this season with slower pitches offering minimal help to fast bowlers. Even Bengal's pace attack struggled initially against Uttarakhand until Mohammed Shami's spell changed their fortunes.The pitch has not been watered since Saturday, though curator Mukherjee expressed satisfaction with the preparation. He noted that Gambhir was pleased with the wicket during his inspection.""It's going to be a good sporting wicket with help for both batters and bowlers. There will be assistance on offer for the spinners as well, and that can happen early as well,"" Mukherjee said, as quoted by news agency PTI.The curator mentioned that Gambhir had inquired about spin assistance, to which he indicated turn could be expected from the third day.South Africa, the reigning World Test Champions, brings a formidable spin attack led by Keshav Maharaj, supported by Simon Harmer and Senuran Muthusamy.

Pakistan are set to face Sri Lanka in a three-match ODI series beginning Tuesday at Rawalpindi, looking to maintain their winning momentum.Newly appointed ODI captain Shaheen Shah Afridi recently led Pakistan to a 2-1 victory over South Africa at home in Faisalabad.""Going into the Sri Lanka series, our focus is to carry that winning momentum forward,"" Afridi said at Pindi Cricket Stadium, which hosts all three ODIs this week. ""We want to build consistency in our performances and make sure that we keep improving as a team in every department.""Pakistan's ODI performance in 2025 has been disappointing, leading to Afridi replacing Mohammad Rizwan as captain before the South Africa series. They lost bilateral series against New Zealand and West Indies, were defeated in the tri-nation series final by New Zealand, and failed to reach the Champions Trophy semifinals on home soil.Pakistan struggled in ODIs during 2025, losing 10 out of 14 matches. Afridi emphasised the need for team responsibility in the 50-over format.""All the players should take responsibility,"" he said. ""It's not Shaheen, Fakhar (Zaman), Babar (Azam), or Saim's (Ayub) job, we all should do our best.We should even back those players who are not performing and always believe that we can perform as a team.""Young batsman Saim Ayub impressed against South Africa with two half-centuries, including a top score of 77 in the decisive third ODI chase of 144.

The Pakistan batting lineup saw contributions from Salman Ali Agha with two fifties and Rizwan's 55 against South Africa.""I was really proud of the way the players responded to different situations and played as a unit (against South Africa),"" Afridi said.

(With inputs from AFP)

Manchester City marked Pep Guardiola’s 1,000th game as a manager in style, cruising to a 3-0 victory over Liverpool to reignite their Premier League title charge on Sunday. At the other end of the table, Nottingham Forest boosted their survival hopes with a 3-1 win over Leeds.Erling Haaland missed an early penalty at the Etihad but made amends soon after, opening the scoring to set City on their way. Nico González doubled the lead before half-time, and Jeremy Doku — the standout performer — sealed the result with a third after the break.It was a fitting celebration for Guardiola, the former Barcelona and Bayern Munich boss, who has now racked up 716 wins in a glittering 17-year managerial career.With the win, second-placed City sit just four points adrift of leaders Arsenal, who dropped points after conceding a stoppage-time equaliser in their 2-2 draw at Sunderland on Saturday.It was a fitting celebration for Guardiola, the former Barcelona and Bayern Munich boss, who has now racked up 716 wins in a glittering 17-year managerial career.With the win, second-placed City sit just four points adrift of leaders Arsenal, who dropped points after conceding a stoppage-time equaliser in their 2-2 draw at Sunderland on Saturday.""My players gave me a good present with this performance against the champions. They all performed to the highest level,"" Guardiola said.""Proud to do it here in Manchester in front of my family, especially against Liverpool.

Real Madrid settled for a goalless draw against Rayo Vallecano on Sunday, maintaining their position at the top of La Liga. The result put them five points ahead of Villarreal and six points clear of Barcelona, who were scheduled to face Celta Vigo later.The derby match saw Rayo Vallecano put up a strong defensive display against the league leaders.

Poll Should more overseas-born players be allowed to represent India in football? Yes, it enriches the team No, focus on homegrown talent Only if they have Indian heritage

NEW DELHI: Indian football took another step into a new era on Sunday as Ryan Williams, the Australia-born forward who recently became an Indian citizen, officially joined the national team camp in Bengaluru ahead of the AFC Asian Cup qualifier against Bangladesh on November 18.The All India Football Federation (AIFF) confirmed his arrival, saying, “Forward Ryan Williams and defender Jay Gupta have joined the senior men’s national team camp in Bengaluru.” The camp, led by newly appointed head coach Khalid Jamil, began on Thursday and has already welcomed overseas-based players Abneet Bharti and now Williams, reflecting a fresh and ambitious direction for Indian football.Williams’ inclusion adds international quality to the squad. The 32-year-old, who plays for Bengaluru FC in the Indian Super League, is known for his pace and technical ability — assets India will hope to harness in the must-win qualifier in Dhaka.Though the former Australian international’s decision to relinquish his Australian passport made headlines last week, his participation in the national camp marks the first official step towards his potential debut in Indian colours.The citizenship handover ceremony was held at Bengaluru FC’s training facility, where Williams received his Indian passport from captain Sunil Chhetri , a symbolic moment that underscored his commitment to his new home.“Honoured to make official what’s long felt true… India, I’m one of your own,” Williams had written earlier on Instagram.Born in Perth to a Mumbai-born mother and English father, Williams has previously represented Australia at U-20 and U-23 levels, and made a senior appearance in a 2019 friendly against South Korea.Before moving to India, he played for Fulham and Portsmouth in England.

I saw a film today, oh boy. It was a day in the life of superstar Erling Haaland — how he loves his eggs sunny side up and his morning coffee laced with maple syrup, drunk from a mug titled ‘good vibes only’. He can barbecue a mean ‘tomahawk’ steak, with a little help from his girlfriend Isabel, who assists with a bearnaise sauce. Does Gordon Ramsay live next door?There’s a bit about LED red light therapy also, and ice baths, along with a section on his liking for raw milk which reportedly unleashed this whole new debate in England. “It’s all about maintaining high energy levels, staying motivated and doing what’s best for both my body and my mind so I’m prepared for whatever comes next,” Haaland told TOI in an exclusive interaction facilitated by JioHotstar.So far, the documentary uploaded on his YouTube channel has 6.7m views. You can see the big bear, but you don’t see the little one. “My life has changed a bit since my son was born, so there are some new routines and responsibilities compared to previous seasons,” he added.Being a father and unwinding at home has definitely helped the 25-year-old reach a new level of prolificacy — Liverpool, beware, he has already scored 13 goals in 10 EPL games — and this bundle of joy has added more lightness to his power-packed frame.“I’ve never felt better,” Haaland had alluded to this welcome change after scoring five goals in a Norwegian demolition of Moldova in Sept. “You need the balance between focusing and the opposite — not focusing at all. ”The defender’s nightmare has another dream record to add to his collection. A goal against his old club Dortmund midweek saw him become the first player to score in five consecutive Champions League games for three different clubs, Salzburg his first love in the striker’s marauding run.No wonder, City coach Pep Guardiola has started comparing him to the untouchables Messi and Ronaldo, in terms of influencing a team. “I should not think I am something just because I’m scoring goals. I’m just Erling and this will never change,” Haaland gave some classic quotes, downplaying Pep’s tall praise.The ‘boyhood blue’ who was born a month after his father Alf-Inge joined the City of Maine Road, however, did say he was the ‘same Erling but with more experience’. And more guidance from the master teacher, who will be in charge of his 1000th game as a manager, against Liverpool at home this Sunday. “Since joining City, Guardiola has significantly helped me refine my movements and put myself in positions where I can score,” Haaland told TOI. “He’s a genius, and his support has played a big role in my development as a goal scorer.”Will he score and help City keep up with Arsenal and put daylight between them and Liverpool? “I try not to focus too much on other people’s expectations. It’s important to keep my mind clear, not overthink. There’s always pressure, but I prefer to stay in my own zone, whether things go as planned or not.”“I keep reminding myself to keep perspective,” said ‘Just Erling’, the 6ft 4in ‘kid’ from agrarian Byrne. His local hop to a Cheshire farm, among other things, keeps him grounded.(WATCH MANCHESTER CITY VS LIVERPOOL IN THE PREMIER LEAGUE ON NOV 9, LIVE & EXCLUSIVE ON STAR SPORTS NETWORK AND JIOHOTSTAR)","Erling Haaland is the first player to score in five consecutive Champions League games for three different clubs.

Poll Do you think Antoine Griezmann should start more matches for Atletico Madrid? Yes, he deserves more playtime No, Alvarez and Sorloth up front is better

Antoine Griezmann came off the bench to score twice and steer Atletico Madrid to a 3-1 victory over Levante in La Liga on Saturday, keeping Diego Simeone’s men firmly in the top-four race.The French forward, who has started only one of Atletico’s last five matches, made an instant impact after being introduced just past the hour mark. He scored 28 seconds after coming on, which was incidetally the fastest goal by a substitute in La Liga in the past decade. He then went on to sealin the win late on.Atletico took the lead in the 12th minute when Pablo Barrios’ cross-shot was parried by goalkeeper Mathew Ryan onto defender Adrian de la Fuente and into the net for an own goal.Levante hit back quickly as Manu Sanchez headed in from a corner in the 21st minute, becoming the first player to score against Atletico in four league matches.Simeone turned to Griezmann midway through the second half, and the veteran forward responded immediately, finishing from close range after Marcos Llorente’s cutback to restore Atletico’s advantage.Levante came close to equalising through Goduine Koyalipou, but Jan Oblak produced a strong save to keep the hosts in front.Griezmann then grabbed his second of the night with 10 minutes left, pouncing on a rebound after Ryan had denied Julian Alvarez.Levante thought they had reduced the deficit in stoppage time through Carlos Alvarez, but the goal was ruled out for offside against Matias Moreno.“It’s hard for us to find solutions sometimes, but those of us who come on from the bench are always bringing a boost,” Griezmann told. “Teams that go far in all competitions do that because they have good depth, and we all have to be ready.”Reflecting on his limited starts, he added: “I prefer to play, in the end when you’re a player you want to play... but I accept it, I am a professional and I have to continue like this to support my team-mates.”The win provisionally lifted Atletico into third place ahead of Villarreal’s late fixture, while Levante remain hovering above the relegation zone.Afterwards, Villarreal took second spot in the standings, with Barcelona third and Atletico just behind, with 25 points in 12 games. Real Madrid lead the pack with 30 points in 11 league outings.","Atletico Madrid beat Levante 3-1 in La Liga on Saturday. Antoine Griezmann came off the bench to score twice for Diego Simeone's side.

Poll Should Arsenal be concerned after their first winless game in weeks? Yes, it's a worrying sign No, they will bounce back immediately

Arsenal’s 10-match winning streak came to a dramatic end as Brian Brobbey struck deep into stoppage time to earn Sunderland a 2-2 draw in the Premier League on Saturday, while Manchester United salvaged a last-minute equaliser in a 2-2 thriller at Tottenham.At the Stadium of Light, former Arsenal defender Dan Ballard gave Sunderland the lead in the 36th minute with a powerful finish, ending the Gunners’ run of eight consecutive clean sheets in all competitions.Bukayo Saka brought Arsenal level nine minutes into the second half with a calm finish, and Leandro Trossard’s strike from the edge of the area in the 74th minute seemed to have secured another victory for Mikel Arteta’s side.But in the fourth minute of added time, Brobbey pounced on Ballard’s header to snatch a point for the hosts.It was Arsenal’s first game without a win since their 1-1 draw with Manchester City in September, though they remain six points clear of second-placed Chelsea, who beat Wolves 3-0 earlier in the day.City could trim the gap to four points with a win over Liverpool on Sunday.“We conceded two similar goals, which is not good enough for ourselves,” said Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta.“But it’s true that we showed an incredible resilience and courage to come back. Even at the end after we conceded the goal we had a massive chance to win it.”At the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, Manchester United were forced to settle for a draw after a dramatic finish. Bryan Mbeumo opened the scoring for United in the 32nd minute, silencing the home crowd as frustration grew among Tottenham supporters.Spurred by late momentum, Tottenham levelled through Mathys Tel in the 84th minute before Richarlison’s deflection off a Wilson Odobert shot put them 2-1 ahead in stoppage time. But Matthijs de Ligt rescued United with a towering header in the 96th minute, extending their unbeaten run to five matches.“We have so much to grow as a team because today was our day to win,” United manager Ruben Amorim said. “If we have a little bit more bravery, we can kill this game.”Tottenham manager Thomas Frank admitted his side fell short defensively, saying, “A lot of things we could have done a bit better. The last goal is all about the urgency, maybe don’t give the cross away and defend better.”","Arsenal's 10-match winning streak came to a dramatic end as Brian Brobbey struck deep into stoppage time to earn Sunderland a 2-2 draw in the Premier League on Saturday.

The final hours of Dallas Cowboys defensive end Marshawn Kneeland paint a deeply tragic picture of a young life spiraling out of control. The 24-year-old athlete, once celebrated for his explosive power on the field, was found dead from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound early Thursday morning, November 6, near a crashed vehicle north of Dallas. His sudden death stunned teammates, fans, and the NFL community who just days earlier had watched him score his first career touchdown on Monday Night Football.According to The Dallas Morning News, Kneeland’s body was discovered in a portable restroom near the intersection of Network Boulevard and Gaylord Parkway in Frisco, Texas. The location was only minutes away from The Star, the Cowboys’ headquarters, and close to the site where his vehicle had crashed along the Dallas Parkway. Investigators said the tragedy unfolded after Kneeland led Texas Department of Public Safety troopers on a brief police chase when he refused to stop for a traffic violation in Addison. Moments later, he collided with a pickup truck near the Dallas Tollway’s access lanes before fleeing on foot. “The driver of the truck was not injured in the accident,” Texas DPS spokesperson Josue De La Cerda told the newspaper.As officers searched the area, authorities began receiving alarming reports suggesting that Marshawn Kneeland was in emotional distress.PEOPLE reported that Kneeland sent a “goodbye” text to his loved ones, prompting his girlfriend, Catalina, to contact police. She warned that he was armed and had a history of mental illness. At nearly the same time, a representative from the NFL called the Plano Police Department with similar information, confirming that multiple agencies were aware of his fragile mental state in the hours leading up to his death.Kneeland, a Michigan native and a second-round pick in the 2024 NFL Draft, was known for his quiet confidence and work ethic. His sudden passing triggered an outpouring of grief across the league. On Sunday, November 9, NFL teams across the country - including in Berlin, Germany, where the Indianapolis Colts faced the Atlanta Falcons - observed a moment of silence to honor his memory. His story now stands as a sobering reminder of the unseen struggles many athletes face behind their public glory.","Marshawn Kneeland, 24, was found dead from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound early Thursday morning, November 6, near a crashed vehicle north of Dallas.

Rob Gronkowski’s return to Foxborough isn’t about football glory or another Super Bowl ring. It’s about love, legacy, and fulfilling a heartfelt promise. The former New England Patriots star will officially retire as a Patriot after signing a one-day contract with the team — a symbolic gesture born out of his friendship with the late Susan Hurley, a beloved philanthropist who passed away from ovarian cancer on November 1.During this week’s Fox NFL Sunday broadcast, Gronkowski shared the emotional announcement: “I am signing a one-day contract with the Patriots this week coming up to retire as a Patriot and be a Patriot for life.” The Patriots confirmed the ceremony on social media, posting, “The greatest tight end in @NFL history is retiring a Patriot! Watch @RobGronkowski sign his one-day contract this Wednesday at 12:15 PM LIVE on Patriots digital & social. ”The idea for the one-day contract wasn’t a marketing move — it came from Hurley herself. As the founder of CharityTeams, she had long been involved with the Gronk Nation Youth Foundation and other local causes. At the ribbon-cutting for Gronk Playground in Boston last summer, Hurley turned to Patriots owner Robert Kraft and asked, “Can we just make it official and sign [Gronkowski] for a day so he can retire as a Patriot? What do you say?”Both Kraft and Gronkowski agreed on the spot. “The reason we’re really going to do that is because of Susan Hurley,” Gronkowski later said.“She wants to see that happen and has been dreaming about it happening for a while.”Patriots spokesperson Stacey James revealed that the team initially planned to honor Gronkowski with the ceremonial signing upon his Hall of Fame induction next year. But they expedited the event after learning of Hurley’s final wish. “We chose to expedite the honor when Susan Hurley, a former Patriots cheerleader and dear friend of Rob’s, made it her dying wish to see Rob retire a Patriot,” James said. “While she won’t be present, her presence will surely be felt. ”Following her death, Gronkowski posted a touching tribute on social media, remembering her as a beacon of strength and kindness. “She always had a smile on her face and the utmost positivity, staying an inspiration for runners and charities every single day, even while she was fighting cancer,” he wrote. “Without Susan, there would be no Gronk Playground.”For a player who defined an era in New England, this final act isn’t about stats or trophies. It’s a reminder that sometimes, the greatest victories happen off the field — in the heart.","Rob Gronkowski will officially retire as a Patriot after signing a one-day contract. The gesture was born out of his friendship with the late Susan Hurley.

Could Mecole Hardman’s late-season arrival be the turning point in Buffalo Bills’ Super Bowl chase?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/could-mecole-hardmans-late-season-arrival-be-the-turning-point-in-buffalo-bills-super-bowl-chase/articleshow/125237320.cms,"Bills’ surprise signing of Super Bowl champ Mecole Hardman could be the spark Josh Allen needed (Getty Images)

The Buffalo Bills are making moves to steady their ship after a rough 30-13 defeat against the Miami Dolphins. The loss exposed major issues in the passing game, prompting heavy criticism of general manager Brandon Beane for failing to equip Josh Allen with enough reliable targets. Head coach Sean McDermott’s visible frustration told the story of a team searching for answers. It appears the front office listened, as ESPN’s Jeremy Fowler reported that the Bills have added a familiar name - “Bills are signing wide receiver Mecole Hardman to the practice squad, per source.”At first glance, the signing might not feel like a game-changer, but it’s a calculated move meant to inject veteran depth and experience into Buffalo’s receiver unit.Mecole Hardman, a three-time Super Bowl champion and former Kansas City Chiefs standout, joins the Bills at a time when they need a spark. The 27-year-old receiver, known for his explosive speed and return-game skills, was drafted in the second round (No. 56 overall) by the Chiefs in 2019. During his rookie year, he earned a Pro Bowl selection and second-team All-Pro honors as a kick returner after tallying 538 yards and six touchdowns through the air.His journey since then has been eventful. Hardman spent three more seasons with Kansas City before a brief stint with the New York Jets in 2023, where limited opportunities led to a mid-season trade back to the Chiefs.Despite appearing in 18 total games last season, he managed only 26 receptions for 208 yards. Earlier this year, he joined the Green Bay Packers’ practice squad but never saw the field in 2025, until now.Buffalo’s decision to bring Hardman aboard speaks to a larger need for versatility and postseason experience. While he’s not expected to immediately crack the 53-man roster, his ability to stretch defenses and contribute in the return game gives the Bills flexibility. For a team trying to reclaim its dominance in the AFC East -- currently trailing the New England Patriots by two games -- every edge matters.Hardman’s signing might not send shockwaves through the league, but it could prove to be a smart, timely move. With Buffalo fighting to regain momentum, the veteran wideout’s championship experience and proven playmaking could be exactly what the team needs to turn things around.Is this conversation helpful so far?",Mecole Hardman is a three-time Super Bowl champion and former Kansas City Chiefs standout.

Antonio Brown’s legal team leans on self-defense narrative and Stand Your Ground law

More coverage on NFL:

Antonio Brown is no stranger to controversy, but this one is bigger, darker, and carries consequences that go far beyond social media shock value. The former Pittsburgh Steelers wide receiver is now fighting second-degree attempted murder charges tied to a shooting that took place outside a celebrity boxing event in Miami.Three days after being extradited back to the United States following months abroad in the Middle East, Brown stood before the court and formally pleaded not guilty. His attorneys insist this isn’t a celebrity meltdown, but an urgent case of self-defense. They argue he reacted only because he believed he was in imminent danger, making this one of the most explosive legal storylines of the 2025 NFL orbit.Antonio Brown’s attorney Mark Eiglarsh has doubled down on a singular message: Brown was not the aggressor. He stated, “The actions he was forced to take were solely in self-defense against the alleged victim’s violent behavior.”He added, “Brown was attacked that night and acted within his legal right to protect himself from an individual who had previously committed criminal acts against him. It's a privilege to represent him, and I am determined to ensure that justice is served.” The legal strategy signals a likely reliance on Florida’s Stand Your Ground rules, a law that has been central to some of the state’s most headline-drawing legal battles.Investigators allege Brown fired two shots, one grazing Zul-Qarnain Kwame Nantambu’s neck. Nantambu himself is not an unknown figure. He went viral earlier this year during Kendrick Lamar’s Super Bowl halftime performance after climbing onto a prop vehicle and waving Palestinian and Sudanese flags, leading to his own legal fallout.Meanwhile, Brown sits in a New Jersey jail awaiting transfer to Florida and his future remains completely up in the air. His supporters point to years of public instability, and Brown himself has publicly suggested chronic traumatic encephalopathy may be influencing his decision-making. But none of that changes what happens next and that part now rests inside a courtroom.","Antonio Brown pleaded not guilty to second-degree attempted murder in a shooting outside a Miami boxing event.

The New England Patriots are living a dream season, and the spark behind it is none other than quarterback Drake Maye. The 23-year-old has been a revelation, guiding the Patriots to an 8-2 record and a seven-game win streak that has reignited championship talk in New England. As Sports Illustrated insider Albert Breer put it, Maye is “arguably the NFL MVP through the first 10 weeks of the season,” as he continues to lead with poise, grit, and precision. Under new head coach Mike Vrabel, fans are already whispering about a new dynasty era - and not just because of what’s happening on the field.Off the gridiron, Maye’s wife, Ann Michael Maye, has unexpectedly become a star in her own right - all thanks to her TikTok cooking videos. Patriots fans can’t seem to get enough of her wholesome charm, flooding her comments section with adoration and humor.Ann’s videos are simple, sweet, and delightfully genuine - much like the couple themselves. When she recently shared a recipe for an apple cider donut loaf, her TikTok was soon swarmed by New England fans. One fan hilariously wrote, “You read recipes the way Drake reads defenses. Perfect couple.” The comment section, rather than turning chaotic as NFL fan spaces often do, has become a lighthearted community of support.Fall seems to have inspired Ann’s culinary streak, as her earlier post featured apple cinnamon oat crumble bars. She gave the treats her signature stamp of approval, writing, “These have no business being this good… everyone who tastes is obsessed.” Her videos, filmed in cozy lighting with soft background music, show an authentic slice of the Mayes’ everyday life - far from the glitz of fame.The couple’s story only adds to their charm. They first met in middle school at age 12, became high school and college sweethearts at UNC, and now, as a married pair, are beloved by Patriots Nation. Ann, 22, often shares her game-day looks and family moments, effortlessly blending fashion, food, and football.As Drake continues to rise as the NFL’s newest hero, his wife’s warmth and relatability have made them one of football’s most adored young couples - both winning hearts in their own ways.","Drake Maye and the New England Patriots are on fire - and so is Ann Maye ’s TikTok kitchen videos.

While some point to potential cosmetic procedures like rhinoplasty, others highlight her natural, makeup-free moments. Her story reflects how public figures' faces are reinterpreted amidst fame and the internet's conflicting reactions to perceived transformations.

Brittany Mahomes' younger photos remind fans how drastic the shift has become

More coverage on NFL:

Brittany Mahomes has never been shy about embracing beauty treatments and she’s also never been a stranger to criticism. Long before she became a fixture in NFL-adjacent pop culture, she was the athletic teenager standing beside Patrick Mahomes in throwback high school photos. Today, she is a polished, professionally glam-managed CEO-style WAG with a high-profile life, red carpet invites, magazine spreads, and a face that triggers passionate responses online.The ongoing conversation isn’t just about aesthetics, it’s about how fame accelerates evolution. When Brittany said she loves her lip fillers, calling them her favorite, it gave fans confirmation that she isn’t hiding her glow-up. But it also gave critics new ammunition.There is a complicated emotional duality here. Fans who have followed Brittany since the Whitehouse High School days insist she “was actually so cute then.” They romanticize those natural, horse-obsessed Texas teen years, pointing to old Valentine’s Day snaps where she hadn’t yet discovered injectables. Others praise her boldness. They see a woman with access, options, and independence and see nothing wrong with investing in face and confidence.Plastic surgeons have weighed in too. One doctor noted “the dorsum of her nose appears more thin and geometric in more recent photos which could represent great make-up contouring, or surgically speaking, a rhinoplasty (i.e. nose job) has been performed.” That professional observation pushed the price-tag speculation into five-figure territory, some estimates crossing $30K.Yet, the irony is, some of Brittany’s most viral photos aren’t from glossy events. They’re makeup-free selfies and casual Thanksgiving posts where she looked fresh, relaxed, and dare critics say it, more “herself.”Her story isn’t about fillers versus no fillers. It is about how public women get re-interpreted every time their face changes, or doesn’t. And how the same internet that praises “glow ups” also turns around and mourns the face they once loved.","Brittany Mahomes' evolving appearance sparks online debate, with fans divided between romanticizing her past and praising her current confidence.

Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce’s rumored wedding guest list chatter heats up as Kim Kardashian’s name stirs fresh tension

More coverage on NFL:

Celebrity weddings always come with unmatched curiosity, but when the couple is Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce , that curiosity turns into a global pop-culture event. As the world speculates about possible venues, themes, and dates, the conversation is now shifting toward something far more emotional: who will get a seat at the table, and who won’t.A new rumor suggests Swift wants the focus solely on joy, not history or baggage. That’s why whispers about Kim Kardashian allegedly being “blacklisted” have people talking. The reported reason isn’t shock value, it’s emotional self-preservation. Insiders claim Swift wants a ceremony free of past triggers, unresolved wounds, and headline-bait friction.There’s a crucial nuance here. This isn’t simply a catty celebrity snub, the way tabloids would love to oversimplify it. Sources insist the tension still traces back to her highly public feud linked to Kardashian’s ex-husband. One insider allegedly said the long-running conflict “really hurt her.” That line alone is enough to clarify Swift’s priorities. This isn’t about punishment. It’s about protecting peace.If true, Kardashian reportedly isn’t shocked, just disappointed. The narrative circulating is that she “hoped her tension with Swift would die down.”In polite circles, that’s an acknowledgment that even mega-stars sometimes want closure more than chaos.To make matters more layered, RadarOnline had previously claimed Swift was planning to “invite broadly”, meaning the reported exclusion carries even more weight. Swift supposedly knows her guest list will be dissected by fans, which is why strategic boundaries stand out more than the invites themselves.Blake Lively’s status even became a conversation point, further proof that the Swift universe is not operating casually or last-minute. Every inclusion, and every omission, tells a story. If anything, this rumor makes something very clear: Swift’s wedding isn’t just a celebrity celebration. It’s a trauma-free zone by design.","Insiders claim Swift prioritizes a joy-filled ceremony, free from past conflicts and emotional triggers, particularly those linked to Kardashian's ex-husband.

More NFL coverage

Fans know Michael Strahan as a powerhouse - a Super Bowl champion, a Hall of Famer, and a charismatic TV host. But beyond the spotlight, his most cherished role is being a father to his four children: Tanita, Michael Jr. , and twins Isabella and Sophia. Strahan has often credited his kids for keeping him grounded and focused. As he once said, “My kids give me strength. I love being with the kids. To me, it’s all about family, now more than anything.”Over the years, Strahan’s family has grown stronger despite living in different places and facing their share of challenges. His dedication as a dad even earned him the Father of the Year Award in 2017 - a recognition that meant the world to him. “I love being a father. It’s absolutely the most joy you’re going to have in your life. It’s also the most stress you’re going to have,” he admitted.Strahan’s journey as a father began in Germany with his first wife, Wanda Hutchins, when they welcomed their daughter Tanita Strahan in 1991. Grounded and artistic, Tanita grew up far from Hollywood fame. “I’ve never been the type of person to be starstruck,” she shared. Today, she’s a talented illustrator based in Los Angeles, working with diverse art forms like watercolor and photography.In 2024, Strahan joyfully revealed on Fox NFL Sunday that Tanita had made him a grandfather to a baby boy named Onyx.Her younger brother, Michael Strahan Jr., born in 1994, shares his father’s quiet determination. After spending his early years in Germany, he returned to Houston at 11. Strahan once said of co-parenting, “From day one, it was very important for me to be active, to be a part of their life.” Michael Jr. went on to study at the University of Texas at San Antonio and has since preferred a private life, occasionally appearing beside his father on Good Morning America.With his second wife, Jean Muggli, Strahan welcomed twin daughters Isabella and Sophia in 2004. The twins have grown up in the public eye but remain remarkably grounded. Isabella, who once shone on the Sherri Hill runway, faced a heartbreaking health battle in 2023 when she was diagnosed with medulloblastoma, a malignant brain tumor. After months of treatment, she was declared cancer-free in June 2024. Through it all, Strahan’s support never wavered. “I know she’s going through it, but I know that we’re never given more than we can handle and that she is going to crush this,” he said with pride and faith.Sophia, meanwhile, channels her energy into academics and sports. Now a student at Duke University, she shares her father’s determination and humility. “Kids need their own identity, their own space to grow,” Strahan once said, reflecting his belief in raising independent, confident young adults.Behind Michael Strahan’s success story stands his greatest accomplishment - his four children, who continue to inspire him both on and off the field. Through triumphs, challenges, and milestones, the Strahan family proves that love, unity, and resilience are what truly define legacy.","Michael Strahan has four children: Tanita, Michael Jr., Isabella, and Sophia.

Magic Johnson honors Lenny Wilkens’ astonishing basketball legacy



Los Angeles Lakers legend LeBron James mourns the demise of Lenny Wilkens as the basketball community was struck with grief following the passing of the NBA icon, who died at 88 in Seattle. Wilkens was synonymous with leadership and excellence. He built a career that transcended generations. His influence stretched from his early playing days in the 1960s to his legendary coaching career that redefined what it meant to lead with grace, intelligence, and integrity. Known as one of the greatest minds in basketball history, Wilkens’ name became synonymous with both consistency and innovation.Over the course of five decades, Wilkens made history as the first person to be inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame three times: as a player, a coach, and an assistant with the 1992 “Dream Team.” His passing marks the end of an era for the NBA, leaving behind a legacy deeply intertwined with the sport’s evolution.LeBron James joined thousands of fans, former players, and coaches in honoring Wilkens’ life and legacy. The Los Angeles Lakers superstar shared his condolences on social media, expressing heartfelt respect for the man whose career set the foundation for modern basketball greatness.“RIP LEGEND!!!!! 🕊️🕊️🕊️🤎.

Charlie Sheen Reveals How He & Dad Beat Michael Jordan

Charlie Sheen claimed that he slept with 47,000 women



In the long list of eccentric Hollywood personalities, few stories rival the one involving NBA legendand actor. The basketball icon has been the subject of admiration from fans around the world, but not many know that one of his biggest admirers came from Hollywood itself. During a recent appearance on the All The Smoke podcast, Sheen openly admitted that his friendship with Jordan once bordered on obsession.The 60-year-old actor, known for his unpredictable charm and troubled past, reflected on the surreal days when he used to fly across the country just to watch Jordan play. While the story starts as a tale of celebrity camaraderie, it quickly takes a wild turn, revealing Sheen’s strange habit of “stalking” the six-time NBA champion in the most unconventional way.During the interview, Charlie Sheen recalled meeting Michael Jordan while filming a short-lived reality show that matched celebrities against professional athletes. The project, titled War of the Stars, featured Sheen and his father taking on Jordan in a free-throw contest. To level the playing field, the Bulls superstar had to shoot with his eyes closed.To Sheen’s delight, he and his father managed to beat Jordan. “I got his number after that, and we stayed in touch,” Sheen said. “I would fly out to Bulls’ home games. So, but yeah, then we worked together on a commercial campaign, we did Hanes, we sold underwear together.That was pretty cool.”The actor recalled how Jordan refused to acknowledge that loss even years later. “The interviewer asked about the game and I’m like, ‘Well yeah, I’m not here to rub it in his face,’ and he’s like, ‘No you didn’t, no you didn’t, uh-uh, you did not,’” Sheen said. “I can appreciate that but it’s on video.”According to Sheen, their friendship became a strange benchmark for communication. “There was a time when I would text him and this dude would literally respond in like 15 or 20 seconds,” he said. “I would tell my friends like, ‘Dude, it’s been four hours, Michael Jordan responds in 20 seconds.’”Outside of his stories with Jordan, Sheen has never shied away from revealing the chaos that once defined his personal life. The Platoon actor recently opened up about his past with startling honesty. In both projects, he addresses his infamous claim of having slept with more than 47,000 women.“I’m not going to run from my past, or let it own me,” Sheen said in a recent People interview. He also discussed his experiences with men, calling the process of finally speaking about it “f---ing liberating.” At the height of his drug use, Sheen says, “That’s what started it… and then just finally being like, ‘So what? Some of it was weird. A lot of it was f---ing fun, and life goes on.’”Now, years after his turbulent public meltdowns and his HIV diagnosis, Sheen insists he’s found calm in living a quieter life. “My romantic life is as uneventful as it possibly could be, and it’s been that way for a long time,” he said, adding that he’s focused on his children and recovery.Also Read: Megan Thee Stallion receives heartfelt apology from boyfriend Klay Thompson after airport pickup mishap","Hollywood veteran Charlie Sheen admits to stalking NBA legend Michael Jordan.

Brandon Ingram faces hefty NBA fine after emotional outburst during Toronto Raptors’ loss

Brandon Ingram recently made the headlines, however, perhaps not for the right reasons. He recently had a complete breakdown after the Toronto Raptors' loss to the Philadelphia Sixers on November 8. After his water bottle almost hurt a team member late in the Raptors' 130-120 loss to the 76ers , he has some criticism coming his way.A team member was hit by the water bottle, which exploded all over them. It was later reported that Ingram should be preparing for a fine from the league since his angry outburst was Saturday's focal point. The officials did not respond right away. But nearly a day later, the league declared that Ingram had been fined $25,000.In the heat of anger, Toronto Raptors star Brandon Ingram slammed his water bottle to the floor on Saturday night and hit a staff member in the face. He also almost hit Scottie Barnes. After that, he did nothing except watch as the others cleaned it up.In the viral videos from the incident, people can see that he didn't move or apologies. He stood there sulking as his teammates cleaned the area around him. When a crew arrived to clean the damp areas, the game was put on hold.Sitting on the bench, Ingram observed the employees cleaning up the whole thing. It was unclear if Ingram expressed regret for the outburst.However, almost 24 hours after the incident, the NBA authorities announced on their official X account that Ingram has been fined. The statement read:“Toronto Raptors forward Brandon Ingram has been fined $25,000 for forcibly throwing his water bottle to the floor while on the bench, it was announced today by James Jones, Executive Vice President, Head of Basketball Operations…”It continued:“The incident, in which the bottle made contact with a game attendant and caused a game delay to dry the court, occurred with 6:25 remaining in the third quarter of the Raptors' 130-120 loss to the Philadelphia 76ers on Nov. 8 at Xfinity Mobile Arena..”Ingram didn't even play poorly. He finished with five assists, eight rebounds, and 21 points. By any measure, a solid night. Joel Embiid and Tyrese Maxey totally destroyed the Raptors, which is why they lost 130-120, but bad play wasn't the reason of the breakdown.Also read: Is Trae Young playing tonight Vs Toronto Raptors?

Phoenix Suns Injury Report vs New Orleans Pelicans (November 10, 2025)

Both Teams Forced to Adjust Strategies

Thesquared off on November 10, 2025, in a regular-season clash that carried more storylines off the court than on it. Both teams entered the matchup dealing with significant injuries that reshaped their rotations, strategies, and overall momentum heading into the contest. For the Pelicans, the absence of their top scorer and cornerstone forward Zion Williamson created a major void. Meanwhile, the Phoenix Suns faced their own setback, losing one of their most dynamic offensive weapons, Jalen Green, to another hamstring injury.This game, held at the Phoenix Suns’ home venue, the Mortgage Matchup Center, wasn’t just about who could score more - it was about which team could better adapt to adversity. The New Orleans Pelicans were trying to shake off their early-season slump, holding a 2-7 record and searching for their third win of the campaign. On the other hand, the Suns were looking to build on a two-game winning streak and extend their home success to four straight victories despite roster uncertainty caused by illness and injuries.The New Orleans Pelicans suffered a major blow as Zion Williamson missed his fourth consecutive game due to a left hamstring strain.The star forward, averaging 22.8 points per game this season, has been the heartbeat of New Orleans’ offense, and his absence left a noticeable gap in the team’s scoring options. Adding to the setback, Jordan Poole was ruled out with a left quad strain, while Dejounte Murray remained sidelined long-term following a right Achilles rupture.To make matters worse, the New Orleans Pelicans also listed Yves Missi as questionable due to illness. This depleted lineup forced head coach Willie Green to rely heavily on depth players and young talent to generate offensive rhythm and defensive consistency against a Suns team eager to maintain momentum.The Phoenix Suns, meanwhile, were hit with their own share of misfortune. Guard Jalen Green re-aggravated a right hamstring injury that originally occurred during training camp. Green had recently returned to action with an explosive 29-point performance, but this latest setback was expected to sideline him for four to six weeks.Head coach Jordan Ott expressed both disappointment and optimism, emphasizing the team’s “next man up” mindset as they navigate the challenges of an 82-game season. Beyond Green, the Suns’ injury report remained relatively clean, though several players were impacted by illness, including Royce O’Neale, and earlier in the week, Grayson Allen and Mark Williams.With both sides missing key contributors, the spotlight naturally shifted to other stars to step up. For Phoenix, the scoring load was expected to fall on Devin Booker and Dillon Brooks, who were tasked with maintaining offensive efficiency in Green’s absence. On the New Orleans Pelicans’ side, the team needed to find alternative scoring options to compensate for Williamson’s dominance inside the paint.Also read: Is Giannis Antetokounmpo playing tonight vs the Dallas Maverikcs?

Dallas Mavericks Injury Report vs Milwaukee Bucks (November 10, 2025)

The upcoming clash between theon November 10, 2025, is shaping up to be one of the most intriguing games of the early NBA season. Scheduled to tip off at 7:30 p.m. CT at the American Airlines Arena, this matchup carries plenty of drama as both teams deal with key injuries that could heavily influence the outcome. Despite the uncertainty surrounding several players, fans can expect a fiercely competitive game as both sides look to maintain their early-season momentum and strengthen their playoff positioning.With both rosters boasting superstar talent but navigating medical setbacks, the game becomes not just a test of skill but also of adaptability and resilience. While Milwaukee enters with a better health outlook and a 6-4 record, Dallas is struggling to stay afloat with multiple injuries to its core lineup. The result could hinge on which team’s stars can take the floor - and perform at full strength.The Milwaukee Bucks appear relatively stable heading into this matchup. Giannis Antetokounmpo, the face of the franchise and perennial MVP contender, is listed as probable due to left knee patellar tendinopathy.Despite some knee discomfort, Giannis has played in 9 of Milwaukee’s 10 games so far, showcasing his resilience and continued dominance on both ends of the court. His presence remains critical for Milwaukee’s offense and transition defense, and all signs point to him suiting up once again.The Bucks do have some concerns beyond Giannis. Kevin Porter Jr. is out indefinitely after undergoing right knee meniscus surgery, creating a gap in the backcourt rotation. Meanwhile, Taurean Prince continues to recover from a herniated disc in his neck, sidelining him for an extended period. Despite these absences, the Milwaukee Bucks retain a strong core with Damian Lillard, Brook Lopez, and Khris Middleton expected to play, ensuring that Milwaukee remains dangerous on both ends of the floor.The Dallas Mavericks, on the other hand, face more significant uncertainty. Anthony Davis is questionable with a left calf strain and could be a game-time decision. The Mavericks’ frontcourt depth is further challenged by Dereck Lively II, who is doubtful with a knee sprain, and Daniel Gafford, who is questionable due to an ankle sprain. These injuries could severely limit Dallas’s rebounding and rim protection against Giannis and Lopez.Adding to their woes, Dante Exum remains out with a knee injury, while Kyrie Irving continues his recovery from a knee procedure, potentially missing his third consecutive game. Without Irving’s scoring and playmaking, Dallas’s offensive rhythm could take a major hit, placing more pressure on their remaining healthy stars to step up.While Milwaukee enters the contest with a healthier roster and the probable availability of Giannis, Dallas’s lineup remains in flux. If Davis and Lively sit out, the Dallas Mavericks could struggle to contain Milwaukee’s size and interior scoring. However, the unpredictable nature of the NBA often leads to unexpected breakout performances, and Dallas will look to rely on its depth to stay competitive.","The Dallas Mavericks face the Milwaukee Bucks on November 10, 2025.

LaMelo Ball’s Absence Impacts Hornets’ Performance

Lakers Look to Capitalize Despite Their Own Setbacks

Theare heading into their November 10, 2025, matchup against the Los Angeles Lakers. The 24-year-old playmaker remains sidelined with a right ankle injury that has kept him out for four consecutive games. His absence continues to hinder Charlotte’s offensive rhythm and overall team chemistry, leaving the Hornets struggling to find their footing early in the season.LaMelo Ball’s ankle impingement, which first flared up during the team’s loss on November 1, has been a major concern for both the player and the organization. Despite treatment and rest, the issue has persisted, and the Hornets are choosing to take a cautious approach to avoid aggravating the injury further. Averaging 23.3 points, 7.8 rebounds, and 9.8 assists per game this season, Ball’s absence creates a massive void in the team’s offensive setup - one that has been difficult to fill so far.Charlotte’s injury situation looks grim ahead of this contest. Alongside LaMelo Ball, the Hornets will be missing key rotation players - Brandon Miller (shoulder), Josh Green (shoulder), and Grant Williams (knee) - all ruled out for tonight’s matchup.To make matters worse, Miles Bridges is listed as questionable due to back spasms, leaving the Hornets’ frontcourt depth in question.This injury pile-up has forced head coach Steve Clifford to shuffle lineups frequently, disrupting the team’s consistency on both ends of the floor. Without several core players, the Hornets will need to rely heavily on their bench and role players to step up against a Lakers team still adjusting but in a relatively stronger position.LaMelo Ball’s injury not only robs the Hornets of their top scorer and facilitator but also of their floor leader. His ability to dictate tempo and create scoring opportunities has been the cornerstone of Charlotte’s offense. Since his injury, the team has dropped two of the three games he has missed, showing clear signs of struggle in playmaking and offensive coordination.In Ball’s absence, Collin Sexton has been thrust into a larger role, shouldering the responsibility of driving the offense. However, while Sexton has shown flashes of brilliance, he has yet to replicate Ball’s all-around impact on the game. The Hornets’ scoring efficiency and assist rates have noticeably dipped without their star guard.The Los Angeles Lakers, meanwhile, are dealing with their own share of injury troubles, though not as severe as Charlotte’s. LeBron James continues to sit out due to a lingering sciatica issue, but there’s optimism surrounding Austin Reaves, who is listed as questionable and could return to action tonight.Despite LeBron’s absence, the Lakers remain confident as they look to bounce back from a recent loss. With Luka Doncic leading the charge, Los Angeles will aim to exploit Charlotte’s weakened lineup and maintain their early-season momentum.Also read: Is LeBron James playing tonight vs the Charlotte Hornets?

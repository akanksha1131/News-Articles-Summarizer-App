Poll Who do you think showed more sportsmanship during the Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy? Chris Woakes Rishabh Pant Both equally

NEW DELHI: In one of the more heartwarming exchanges to emerge from the fiercely contested five-match Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy, England pacer Chris Woakes revealed a friendly and touching chat with Indian star wicketkeeper-batter Rishabh Pant after both cricketers sustained injuries during the just concluded high-octane Test series.Woakes, who dislocated his shoulder while fielding on Day 1, was ruled out of the remainder of the fifth and final Test at The Oval. Despite his injury, the veteran pacer stunned fans and teammates alike by walking out to bat on Day 5 with his right arm in a sling, trying to help England pull off a miraculous win. India, however, held their nerve to win by six runs, levelling the series 2-2.Pant, who fractured his toe while playing a reverse sweep against Woakes during the fourth Test at Old Trafford in Manchester, was equally brave — scoring a vital half-century despite the pain, though he was eventually ruled out of the final match and couldn't don the gloves.Speaking to The Guardian, Woakes shared the story behind their exchange. “I saw Rishabh had put an image of me on Instagram with a salute emoji, so I replied thanking him: ‘Appreciate the love and hope the foot is OK,' etc,” Woakes recalled.“He then sent me a voice note saying: ‘I hope all is OK, good luck with the recovery and I hope we meet again out there some day.' I obviously said sorry for the broken foot.”The message from Pant underscored the mutual admiration and sportsmanship between the two, even after their gritty on-field battles.Woakes also backed Ben Stokes ' stance against the introduction of injury substitutes in Test cricket. “I'm with Stokesy, to be honest,” he said. “Having played for 18 years, the game is what it is: you lose a player and as a team you have to find a way. It makes you more resilient and the team stronger.”Although he acknowledged arguments for change — especially in the case of ""freak injuries"" like his — Woakes warned that such a rule would open ""too many grey areas or loopholes.""",England's Chris Woakes and India's Rishabh Pant exchanged messages after both sustained injuries during the Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy.

NEW DELHI: In a quiet corner of Bathinda , Punjab, the soft clack of chess pieces echoes every evening, not from the hands of a seasoned master, but from an eight-year-old girl with an unblinking gaze and a mind wired for strategy.Tanishka Garg, just 8 years and 4 months old, has officially become Punjab’s youngest female player to earn an international (FIDE) chess rating.At an age when most children are deciding between dance class or a new cartoon to obsess over, Tanishka is rewriting her state's chess history.The recognition, published on August 1 by the International Chess Federation (FIDE), follows the starlet's strong performance at the National Under-9 Championship held in Gurugram this June.However, the road that led here began with a spark that no one saw coming, until it became impossible to ignore.“My son used to play chess at home; he was only six years old. So he started playing at home, then he played some games in school and performed very well. I felt he needed a coach,” recalls Tanishka's mother, Meenu Garg.“I searched nearby, and a little far off in our state, there was Candidate Master (CM) Pankaj Sharma Sir.He gives coaching to kids and is also a friend of my husband. I talked to him and said, ‘Sir, I want to send Mukul (my son),’ and he agreed. He said, ‘I'm busy all day, but you can send him between 8 to 9 in the evening,’ and I agreed.”The story took an unexpected turn just days later, thanks to little Tanishka, who wanted to partake in on her brother’s new routine.“After two days of coaching Mukul, Tanishka said, ‘Mom, I also want to go with brother.’ So, as a mother, thinking practically: it was dinner time, and she was a small child, just 4.5 years old, I thought, ‘Let me send her too, it'll be easier for me,’” Meenu says with a chuckle.“I only started sending her to coaching classes because I had to make dinner, and it was easier without the children around.“Within a week, around ten days later, I asked Sir how Mukul was doing, and he replied, ‘Mukul is good, but your daughter is something else!’ I said, ‘Sir, please don’t joke with me.’ But he was serious — said she picked up everything, even how to move the pieces so quickly, that he started giving her online school resources too, and she began improving rapidly. He told me, ‘Ma’am, you should take this seriously.’ So I did. ”A month later, the 2017-born was scoring points in school tournaments. She was so underestimated that others tried helping her mid-game.“They thought she was just playing for fun. No one realised she was competing,” says Meenu.Since then, the medals haven’t stopped.To start, the third-grader has played five nationals and has three state titles under her belt.From scoring three points at an open tournament in Sangrur as a 5-year-old to becoming Under-7 Punjab state champion in 2024, Tanishka has collected multiple titles, including in school games and under-9 categories.“She’s played more tournaments than I can count,” says Meenu. “She’s also among the top students in her school, with beautiful handwriting in English, Hindi, and Punjabi. But what really sets her apart is her temperament. She never asks for food or water during matches and never leaves her things scattered. She’s extremely disciplined and soft-spoken.""Tanishka's father, Bhushan Garg, is a businessman. Meenu, a housewife with no background in sports, has thus found herself becoming a one-woman army, juggling school schedules, travel plans, and every detail of her daughter’s chess journey. But recently, she took her most daring step yet.On International Chess Day (July 20), she organised a one-day tournament in Bathinda with players from across India, including Sirsa, Ganganagar, Haridwar and Yamunanagar.“I organised it entirely for my daughter to gain experience. I expected 100 entries; after players turned up in huge numbers, and we had to close at 160,” Meenu says. “We had three halls booked, one for children, two for parents. Every child got a free lunch. It wasn’t profitable, but the learning was priceless.”""There was also a specially abled child who came to participate, so I had a special trophy made just for him. It was truly heartwarming to watch him play. We even held a session for parents, which was very well received. People are still calling me, saying, 'Ma'am, when will the next tournament be?'""To earn a FIDE rating, a player must compete in at least five rated games and perform at a minimum level of 1400. For Punjab Chess Association president Ankush Kathuria, Tanishka’s achievement is more than personal glory.“She’s the youngest FIDE-rated female from Punjab. Her success proves that results come when parents dedicate early, like in the South, where kids start at 3 or 4,” says Kathuria.He admits that Punjab still lacks top-tier coaching infrastructure.“We have only one International Master, and no Grandmaster. But we’ve already spoken to the All India Chess Federation (AICF) to conduct Grandmaster coaching camps. Her success gives us and other parents a reason to invest.”Tanishka, meanwhile, is undeterred by competition, whether it's boys, older players, or large crowds.“She never even asks who she’s playing against,” Meenu says. “She just plays. In Vrindavan, out of 350 kids, she was again awarded ‘Youngest Player from Punjab’. That’s her seventh such title.”Her training now continues under Saurabh Arora (offline) and Deepak Batra (online). Her path is being charted carefully: no back-to-back tournaments, no pressure. She skipped the Delhi GM tournament in July to prioritise the under-9 nationals.“My dream is for her to become an IM or WGM, maybe even GM,” her mother admits. “But I don’t pressure her. Many kids cry after losing; their parents shout. I’ve never done that. She plays happily, and that’s enough for me.”","Tanishka Garg, just 8 years and 4 months old, has officially become Punjab’s youngest female player to earn an international (FIDE) chess rating.

Poll Do you agree with Mitchell Marsh's decision to open the batting with Travis Head? Yes No

NEW DELHI: Australian white-ball skipper Mitchell Marsh has ended the guessing game over his batting position, confirming he will open the innings alongside Travis Head in T20Is “for the foreseeable future” as the team builds towards next year's T20 World Cup in India and Sri Lanka.Australia have trialled several opening combinations since David Warner's retirement, including Matt Short, Glenn Maxwell and Jake Fraser-McGurk. But Marsh believes consistency at the top is key.“It'll be myself and Heady up the top for the foreseeable future,” he said ahead of the three-match T20 series against South Africa starting Sunday in Darwin. “Obviously we've played a lot together, got a great relationship, so (we'll) start there.”The series comes on the back of Australia's 5-0 sweep over the West Indies, where the middle and lower order thrived. Tim David stole headlines with a blistering 37-ball century — the fastest by an Australian — prompting discussions about moving him higher in the order.“We've spoken about it … we saw that in the Caribbean, that he came in earlier than he would normally,” Marsh said. “The more balls he faces, hopefully the more games he wins us.”Sunday's clash will be the first international in Australia's tropical north in 17 years and is already a sell-out. South Africa, led by returning skipper Aiden Markram , bring a youthful squad spearheaded by Kagiso Rabada and featuring four spinners — Prenelan Subrayen, George Linde, Senuran Muthusamy and Nqaba Peter.Proteas coach Shukri Conrad expects a stern test. “Touring Australia is never easy.

Poll Who do you think is the key player for England in the Ashes? Joe Root Harry Brook Ben Stokes

The Ashes is still more than three months away, but pace legend Glenn McGrath has wasted no time in making his trademark prediction — a 5-0 sweep for Australia.Speaking on BBC Radio, the former fast bowler said England will find it “pretty tough” to overcome the hosts when the series begins in Perth on November 21, especially against a pace attack led by Pat Cummins , Mitchell Starc, Josh Hazlewood and spinner Nathan Lyon in home conditions.“It’s very rare for me to make a prediction, isn’t it? And I can’t make a different one — 5-0,” McGrath said. “Plus, that track record England have had, it’d be interesting to see if they can win a Test.”McGrath’s confidence is bolstered by England’s recent 2-2 draw against India in the Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy, a result he believes exposed weaknesses in their batting. He sees the series-defining battle as Australia’s attack versus England’s top and middle order, especially Joe Root and Harry Brook.“This series will be a big one for Root. He’s never really done that well in Australia — he’s not even got a 100 over there,” McGrath said. “Brook’s the one I’ve enjoyed watching… The Australians will need to get on him pretty early.”England have not won the Ashes since 2015 and have endured heavy defeats on nearly every tour Down Under since 2002-03.Australia won 4-0 in 2021-22 and have lost just two of their last 15 home Tests.While McGrath acknowledged Australia’s top-order form is an issue, he believes England’s bowling “needs to strengthen a little bit” to mount a challenge.“I love seeing sportspeople go out there and play without fear,” McGrath added, praising coach Brendon McCullum’s philosophy but urging “a bit more accountability and the mental side of the game.”",Glenn McGrath predicts 5-0 Ashes sweep for Australia.

Poll How do you feel about the final result of the series ending in a draw? It's a fair outcome Disappointing for England A great achievement for India I expected a clear winner

England all-rounder Chris Woakes has opened up about the shoulder injury he sustained during the fifth Test against India in the Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy, which ended in a 2-2 series draw at The Oval in London on Monday. The injury occurred while diving to save a run at the boundary during India's first innings.The incident took place in the 57th over when Woakes attempted to make a diving save at the boundary. He immediately showed signs of discomfort and had to receive attention from the team physio before leaving the field.""When you have an injury like that, you think your game is done. And then, the closer it goes, it's always never a matter of whether I was going to be out there or not. And it was just a matter of how I was going to approach it,"" Woakes said in a video shared by Sky Sports.""Emotions were running high. I was hoping that we could get over the line with Gus at the other end and I wouldn't have to face a ball, but not to be, unfortunately,"" he added.Despite his injury, Woakes returned to bat in the crucial final moments when England needed 17 runs to win. He partnered with Gus Atkinson but didn't face any deliveries, though he had to run between wickets while clearly in pain.The dramatic conclusion saw Mohammed Siraj dismiss Atkinson by hitting his off stump, securing a narrow six-run victory for India.The series ended with India defying predictions that had favored an England victory. The visitors managed to hold their nerve and clinch the victory in front of a packed crowd at The Oval.The final result meant the Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy concluded in a 2-2 draw, with India's remarkable win in the last Test preventing England from claiming the series.",England all-rounder Chris Woakes has opened up about a shoulder injury sustained during the fifth Test against India.

Poll Should Kuldeep Yadav have been included in the India lineup for the Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy? Yes, he could have made a difference No, the selected spinners performed well

Former Australian captain Michael Clarke expressed that India missed an opportunity by not including spinner Kuldeep Yadav in their lineup during the recent Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy against England, while also commending the performances of spinners Ravindra Jadeja and Washington Sundar in the series.Since making his Test debut in 2017, Kuldeep Yadav has featured in only 13 Tests, claiming 56 wickets at an average of 22.16 with four five-wicket hauls. His only appearance in England came in 2018, where he went wicketless, though he maintains a strong record against England with 21 wickets in six matches at an average of 22.28.""The talk around Kuldeep Yadav, I don't think, changes. He didn't play a part in the series. I think he could have helped India take 20 wickets in this series. But you can't take anything from these two (Sundar and Jadeja). With the bat, they've been exceptional, with the ball, they've been exceptional. So, I don't think anybody can criticise those two players, these two spinners. The part of the impact they had in this series deserved their spot, grabbed it with both hands,"" Clarke said on his YouTube channel Beyond23 Cricket Podcast.Ravindra Jadeja emerged as the fourth-highest run-scorer in the Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy, accumulating 516 runs in five matches at an average of 86.00, including five fifties and a hundred.He also contributed with the ball, taking seven wickets at an average of 72.42.Washington Sundar also made significant contributions, scoring 284 runs at an average of 47.33, including one fifty and one century.After being left out of the Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy, Kuldeep Yadav is set to return to action as the lead spinner for Central Zone in the upcoming Duleep Trophy.""But I do think Kuldeep will continue to be a talking point because I think he's that X-factor for all of India. He could've helped them throughout this series to take 20 wickets. And then the two spinners, their batting is underrated. Has always been underrated for someone like Jadeja. He scores so many important runs for India. And, Washington Sundar another fifty as well,"" Clarke added.",Kuldeep Yadav was left out of India's squad for the Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy.

A recent photo of the Indian batting superstar with former cricketer Shash Kiran in London has gone viral, sparking concern among fans. Kohli’s visibly greying beard grabbed all the attention, leaving fans stunned by his changed appearance. Social media was flooded with reactions, with some even speculating that Kohli might be on the verge of announcing his retirement from ODIs. He has already retired from T20Is and Test cricket.Amid the chatter, Kohli has begun training in London as he prepares for his return to one-day internationals. On Friday, he shared photos from an indoor session with Gujarat Titans’ assistant coach Naeem Amin.Kohli appeared in high spirits and good shape during the session, wearing a grey t-shirt and blue shorts as he worked on his batting skills ahead of his much-awaited comeback.""Thanks for helping out with the hit, brother. Always lovely to see you,"" Kohli wrote on his Instagram story, sharing a picture from the session.""Good to see you brother! See you soon,"" Naeem replied via Instagram.The star batter is expected to rejoin the Indian squad for the ODI series in Australia, scheduled from October 19 to 25.His comeback was initially planned for the August series against Bangladesh, which has since been postponed.Kohli last played competitive cricket in June during the IPL 2025 final, where he scored 43 runs to help Royal Challengers Bengaluru clinch their maiden IPL title against Punjab Kings in Ahmedabad.With 14,181 ODI runs and a record 51 centuries in the format, Kohli continues to be regarded as one of the greatest ever in one-day cricket.In the previous ODI World Cup, he set a new benchmark by scoring 765 runs, breaking Sachin Tendulkar’s long-standing record.","Virat Kohli has begun training in London as he prepares for his return to one- day internationals.

NEW DELHI: Australia’s pace legend Glenn McGrath didn’t hold back with his trademark bold prediction for the upcoming Ashes series, forecasting a 5-0 whitewash in Australia’s favour. Speaking on BBC Radio, the former fast bowler said England would find it “pretty tough” to overcome the hosts when the series kicks off in Perth on November 21 — especially against a formidable bowling attack featuring Pat Cummins, Mitchell Starc, Josh Hazlewood, and Nathan Lyon on home turf.“It’s very rare for me to make a prediction, isn’t it? And I can’t make a different one — 5-0,” McGrath said. “Plus, that track record England have had, it’d be interesting to see if they can win a Test.”McGrath’s comments quickly drew a reaction from former England pacer Stuart Broad , who took a playful jab at the Aussie great on social media.“It’s August!! At least let us land Glenn!,” Broad wrote.McGrath’s confidence stems partly from England’s recent 2-2 series draw in the Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy against India — a result he believes highlighted vulnerabilities in England’s batting lineup. He pointed to the clash between Australia’s pace unit and England’s top and middle order as the key contest of the series, with particular focus on Joe Root and Harry Brook.“This series will be a big one for Root. He’s never really done that well in Australia — he’s not even got a 100 over there,” McGrath said. “Brook’s the one I’ve enjoyed watching… The Australians will need to get on him pretty early.”England haven’t lifted the Ashes since 2015 and have struggled in Australia for over two decades. The last Ashes series Down Under ended 4-0 in Australia’s favour in 2021-22. Over the past 15 home Tests, Australia have lost just twice.",Glenn McGrath predicts a 5-0 Ashes whitewash in Australia's favour.

Poll How do you feel about the current state of the Indian Super League? Very concerned Somewhat concerned Not concerned at all

Eleven Indian Super League clubs have written to the All India Football Federation, urging them to bring the current uncertainty over ISL's future to the Supreme Court 's attention. The clubs warned they would seek independent judicial intervention if AIFF fails to act, following FSDL's decision to pause the 2025-26 season due to uncertainty over the Master Rights Agreement renewal. Mohun Bagan Super Giant and East Bengal were the only ISL clubs that did not sign the letter.The development occurred after AIFF proposed organizing the Super Cup in September to ensure clubs get sufficient competitive matches. This proposal came after ISL organizers FSDL put the league on hold due to uncertainty regarding the MRA renewal.The Supreme Court had previously directed AIFF not to negotiate new terms of the MRA with FSDL until a final judgment is delivered in the AIFF draft constitution case.""We respectfully urge the AIFF, in its capacity as the statutory regulator of football in India and the principal party to the proceedings, to urgently bring the current situation to the attention of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India ,"" the 11 ISL clubs stated in their joint letter to AIFF president Kalyan Chaubey.""This may be done by mentioning the matter for urgent listing and judgment and apprising the Hon'ble Court of the current situation to ensure that the ISL and associated competitions may proceed.We believe such a step is both legally permissible and in the interest of safeguarding Indian football, the AIFF's own regulatory mandate, and the welfare of all stakeholders involved.""The clubs expressed surprise that the matter hadn't already been brought to the Court's attention, given its significance for the sport.""During the last hearing before the Hon'ble Supreme Court, the Hon'ble Judges orally observed that no major decisions should be taken until final orders are passed, which has resulted in a de facto holding pattern for the Indian Super League and associated football activities. This legal uncertainty and administrative vacuum are now threatening to cause irreversible damage to the Indian football ecosystem. Clubs are unable to plan or invest, commercial contracts are on hold, and the livelihoods of thousands of players, staff, support personnel, and stakeholders are at immediate risk. Moreover, this situation could seriously derail the momentum of football development in the country.""The clubs offered to support AIFF legally while making their stance clear about approaching the Supreme Court independently if needed.""We would be happy to support the AIFF legally and work jointly towards this, in a manner that protects the interests of Indian football and all its constituents. It is in the best interest of all concerned that the AIFF, as the main party and regulator, takes immediate initiative in this regard. Based on legal advice, the ISL clubs are preparing to independently approach the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India for relief. However, given that the clubs are not formal parties to the current proceedings, this may not be the most efficient or effective route to resolve the situation.

LIVERPOOL: Liverpool manager Arne Slot refused to rule out an improved bid for Newcastle's Alexander Isak as the Premier League champions consider adding to their formidable firepower, with Darwin Nunez set to leave for Saudi Arabia. After a quiet first year in the transfer market under Slot the Reds have spent almost £300 million ($402 million) on forwards Florian Wirtz and Hugo Ekitike as well as full-backs Milos Kerkez and Jeremie Frimpong.Nunez is one of a number of significant exits that will help recoup much of that outlay as the Uruguayan closes in on a £46 million move to Al Hilal.Liverpool reportedly had a £110 million bid for Isak turned down by Newcastle, who are seeking a British transfer record fee.The Swedish striker has not been part of the Magpies' pre-season preparations and has been told to train on his own by Newcastle.""You never talk about players that are not yours,"" Slot said at his pre-match press conference ahead of Sunday's Community Shield against Crystal Palace at Wembley, the traditional curtain-raiser for the season.""I think we have a lot of attacking power in our team. When I think about Cody Gakpo, Federico Chiesa, Hugo Ekitike, Mo Salah, Jeremie Frimpong, who can play as a right-winger, Florian Wirtz, who can play as a left-winger, -- I already feel I have a lot of attacking options in my current squad.""But, as always as a club, we are always looking at the chances in the market.""Liverpool celebrated a record-equalling 20th English top-flight title but were devastated last month by the death of forward Diogo Jota.The Portuguese international was killed in a car accident alongside his brother in northern Spain as he began to make his way back to England for pre-season.A series of tributes have been paid to Jota at every Liverpool game since and will continue throughout the season.A ""Forever 20"" emblem, referencing Jota's now-retired shirt number, will be printed on Liverpool's shirts this season, while a permanent memorial will be installed at Anfield.""First of all, tragedy impacted us but it impacted far more his wife, children and parents,"" said Slot.""But it impacted us as well, definitely.

TOI

The All India Football Federation (AIFF) has assured all top-tier clubs in the country that they will have the same number of matches to compete like previous seasons with the Super Cup expected to take place in September and a top-tier league to follow.The next edition of the Indian Super League (ISL), India’s top-tier football league since 2019, was scheduled to start on Sept 14. But with uncertainty over the contract with its marketing partners beyond Dec 8 this year, when the 15-year Master Rights Agreement (MRA) concludes, the league has been paused.At least three clubs – Odisha FC, Bengaluru FC and Chennaiyin FC -- have suspended operations and put player salaries on hold. Six clubs have not yet started pre-season.“The Super Cup and (top-tier) league both will happen,” AIFF president Kalyan Chaubey told reporters after meeting representatives of clubs in the presence of FSDL, its marketing partners, on Thursday. “We will first have the Super Cup because the clubs have a (financial) commitment towards squads of 30-40 players. They have to plan the season as per the number of matches. We have told them that whatever matches they were supposed to play, it will take place.The Super Cup involves clubs from the top-tier ISL and second division I-League with the winners being offered a spot in AFC Champions League Two playoffs. The domestic tournament previously had a league-cum-knockout format, while last season only 15 teams took part in a knockout format.AIFF said they were willing to introduce a new format for the Super Cup to help clubs save time and costs, though not everyone in the room was convinced.“It makes no sense to play the Super Cup if there is no confirmation about the ISL,” a club CEO toldafter the meeting. “What is the point of assembling a squad only for the Super Cup? There is about Rs 30 crore investment at stake and no owner will be willing to take a risk. There was no assurance on ISL. Kalyan Chaubey and (AIFF vice president) NA Haris only said we will have a league to play.”Given the federation’s history with I-League, one senior club official asked if AIFF could organise a top league without any hitches, if Reliance-led FSDL was not on board.Behind closed doors in the Capital, representatives of clubs met Chaubey and senior AIFF officials which included Haris, treasurer Ajay Kipa, chairperson of the finance committee Menla Ethenpa and chairperson of the league committee Lalnghinglova Hmar.Mohun Bagan Super Giant, East Bengal and Odisha all joined the meeting virtually.According to those present at the meeting, clubs were in favour of AIFF and FSDL mutually agreeing a short-term extension to complete the season and then, if both parties agree, sign a long-term deal, depending on the Supreme Court’s order on the draft constitution. Chaubey said the federation didn’t have a problem with an extension, but there were doubts if any agreement would be a violation of the apex court’s oral order.“A short-term extension is the need of the hour. It provides time for everyone to find a permanent solution and save clubs from losing their investments. If there’s no immediate action, more clubs will be forced to suspend operations,” said another CEO.The clubs also wanted AIFF to approach the Supreme Court for an interim order but were told they’ll have to wait till legal opinion is sought.“We all want the judgment to come at the earliest. Nobody is thinking about a delay,” said Haris.At the meeting, clubs voiced their concerns related to the financial implications of a delayed season, or not having the league at all. “AIFF listened to us, sympathised. They also mentioned that the league will happen, but nothing has been resolved yet. The plan is to meet again in about seven to ten days,” said a senior club official, whose team is competing in the Durand Cup.Clubs yet to start pre-season, and with a question mark over their future, were left disappointed since the meeting did not show light for them at the end of what has seemed like a long and dark tunnel.“As of now, club owners will not think twice before taking drastic decisions,” said the official.After the meeting, FC Goa CEO Ravi Puskur, who was present for the press briefing, said the clubs need time to put their collective thoughts together on the way forward.“You cannot just press a button and then things fall into place. It takes a lot of coordination, a lot of logistical work that needs to happen. So, once we have some clarity on that, like the AIFF president said, we will come back collectively to discuss. We are all here because we want the game to continue,” said Puskur","The next edition of the Indian Super League (ISL), India’s top-tier football league, was scheduled to start on Sept 14.

The All India Football Federation proposed on Thursday to hold the Super Cup tournament from mid-September, aiming to provide Indian Super League clubs with sufficient competitive matches amid uncertainty over the ISL season's start date and format.

But we can do it with certain changes, may be in format or other things. But that will be decided later, no decision on those things yet,"" Chaubey added regarding the ISL uncertainty.The Super Cup, typically held at the season's end, is now likely to commence the season. The tournament is expected to conclude before India's AFC Asian Cup qualification matches against Singapore on October 9 and 14.The Indian Super League usually runs from September to April. The current Master Rights Agreement between Football Sports Development Limited, the ISL organizer, and AIFF is set to expire on December 8, 2025.The uncertainty has already impacted several clubs. Chennaiyin FC announced a temporary suspension of operations for their first-team players and staff on Wednesday, following similar moves by Bengaluru FC and Odisha FC.The decision about the Super Cup's timing comes as a response to the current situation surrounding the ISL's future. The federation and clubs are working to ensure competitive football continues despite the challenges with the league's organization.The rescheduling of the Super Cup represents a significant change in the Indian football calendar, as it moves from its traditional end-of-season slot to potentially becoming the season opener.The AIFF and club representatives are expected to meet again within 7-10 days to finalize the arrangements and make concrete decisions about both tournaments' formats and schedules.","The All India Football Federation proposed on Thursday to hold the Super Cup tournament from mid-September.

What’s common between the three Formula E world champions

How the three World Champions fared in Formula E Season 11

Days after Oliver Rowland lifted his Formula E World Championship trophy in London this season, an interesting trend has come to the attention of Formula E and its fans. As a coincidence, all Formula E drivers who won the Mexico City E-Prix went on to win the Formula E World Championship that season, and this has been proved right for three consecutive years.Highlighting the same since 2023, a poster of three World Champions was shared on X by Formula E with the caption, “The trend continues. Each winner of the #MexicoCityEPrix from the past three seasons has gone on to become World Champion.”The special poster features 2023 Formula E World Champion Jake Dennis from Andretti, then TAG Heuer Porsche’s Pascal Wehrlein, who won in 2024, and the new World Champion, Nissan driver Oliver Rowland. All three of them won in the Mexico E-Prix and went on to lift the winner’s trophy in the Formula E World Championship that year.Oliver Rowland had strengthened his chances of winning the Formula E World Championship this year much earlier. He was leading the Formula E Driver Standings ever since he won Part 2 of the Jeddah E-Prix, which was his second win of the season after winning the Mexico E-Prix. In the last leg, the Nissan driver got nervous for a while as Pascal Wehrlein, who was following him in the number two position, closed the gap after grabbing quite a few podiums while Rowland had a dull period.Things became serious for Rowland when he failed to finish the Round 13 race in Berlin, while Wehrlein won second spot on the podium. But he eventually managed to confirm his championship in Berlin after four wins and three more podiums.Sharing about his bad race in Berlin, Rowland had said, “I was hoping before the weekend that the outcome could be [the World Championship], but after yesterday (Saturday) and this morning (Sunday), I was more worried that it might never come.”Also Read: Oliver Rowland reacts to daughter’s sweet radio message after Formula E Championship win: “It’s amazing” Things, however, changed for Wehrlein, who was pushed to third position after Nick Cassidy made a late entry in the Formula E Driver Standings by registering three consecutive wins.

Wehrlein registered one win and five more podiums this season.Meanwhile, Andretti driver Jake Dennis finished in seventh position in the Formula E Driver Standings.

Taylor Barnard on losing top three spot in Formula E World Championship

Fans hail Taylor Barnard for his fantastic rookie season

It was Taylor Barnard’s rookie season this year, and the NEOM McLaren driver put up a fantastic performance by temporarily making it to the top three in the Formula E Driver Standings by ousting the much more experienced Porsche driver Antonio Felix Da Costa.

Barnard took to Instagram to share his feelings on losing out on the top three in his first-ever season and his claim to the championship.Taking to Instagram after the London E-Prix, Barnard wrote, “London wasn’t what we hoped for, easily being the toughest weekend of our season. Taking 0 points away as a team from a doubleheader hurts, but one weekend doesn’t define the year we’ve had.”He further wrote, “As the season closes, I want to say a massive thank you to the entire team, both trackside and behind the scenes, for everything this season. Finishing P4 in the Drivers’ Championship and coming into the final weekend with a shot at runner-up is something to be proud of.”Also adding a note for teammate Sam Bird, as NEOM McLaren withdrew from Formula E after the end of the season, Barnard wrote, “@sambird_official it wasn’t the weekend you deserved either.You’ve been a huge part of my season both on and off the track, and I’m grateful for everything. You deserved more. To all the Papaya fans, thank you for the incredible support in our final race together. You always go above and beyond. ”Reacting to his post, a fan wrote, “An incredible debut season, huge congrats and excited to see where you go next!” Another said, “I know I said it the other day, but you’ve been incredible to watch this last year and a pleasure to support you in Papaya — there are many of us that can’t wait to support you in whatever you do next!” One more commented, “You were incredible all season around, Taylor.

Through the early days, the good days, the bad days, and the great days, we have always felt an overwhelming amount of support from you all.”For the partners associated with the team, he wrote, “They say that ‘racing is a state of mind’, and since its inception, this team has had the privilege of working for organisations, with partners, and racing for fans who fully embrace this philosophy.This is certainly true of those at McLaren, whose passion for racing is second to none.”“My heartfelt thanks go out to everyone who has been involved: those at McLaren who backed us, the fans who supported us, and the partners who allowed us to go racing. We couldn’t have done it without you all — your trust and support have never been taken for granted,” he added.Praising the two McLaren drivers, he wrote, “Sam clinched McLaren’s first-ever fully electric win at the São Paulo E-Prix in Season 10, pulling off one of Formula E’s all-time great overtakes, before being waved across the line by none other than Emerson Fittipaldi – McLaren's first Formula 1 World Champion. While Taylor has been a rookie sensation in Season 11, securing five Formula E records, including the youngest driver to start a race, the youngest points scorer, the youngest driver to lead a lap, the youngest podium finisher, and the youngest polesitter. ”He ended the letter saying, “Some of us have been together since the day we first launched this team, while others have seamlessly fitted in along the way and flourished within the environment we have cultivated. For many, I am sure that we will cross paths again soon, but whatever the future holds for those here at Bicester, whatever path they choose to follow, I have no doubt that it will be bright. Their potential is limitless. ”Reacting to the open letter on Instagram, Taylor Barnard wrote, “It’s been an honour to wear Papaya and represent this team.” Sam Bird also dropped a heart emoji and a hands-joined-in-prayer emoji in the comments section.Also Read: Taylor Barnard looks back at rookie season at McLaren: “Every step has been unforgettable” Neither Taylor Barnard nor Sam Bird has revealed their future course of action in Formula E Season 12.

How do Formula E and ABB work together?

What do ABB and Formula E say about the partnership?

After a successful Season 11, ABB and Formula E have announced that they will continue their partnership in the upcoming season. This gives ABB another opportunity to promote its new brand positioning via the ABB FIA Formula E World Championship, along with technologies that help industries take a cleaner route.Over a period of eight seasons, the partnership with Formula E has provided ABB a platform to showcase how technology can help industries outrun challenges, engage with customers around the world, and implement its own solutions into the series to improve reliability and efficiency. The partnership extension will provide a year-round opportunity for brand-building and activation, communicating ABB and its technology solutions to new global audiences, including Formula E’s international fanbase.ABB and Formula E will also join hands to engage a new generation of fans, collaborating with unexpected influencers and content creators to tell compelling stories that make advanced electrification and automation technologies tangible and exciting.The end of the mid-race car swap, a 150kW increase in power, top speeds that are 43 percent higher, and energy recovery increasing from 15 to 50 percent indicate how far Formula E technology has come to outperform on track.ABB has also built on its technical involvement in the series, supplying the race chargers from Season 9, and introducing its ABB Ability OPTIMAX® energy management software (Season 9) and Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) technology (Season 5) to the sport.ABB Head of Brand Paco Liebrand said, “We are pleased to be continuing our partnership with Formula E which, like ABB, is striving for a leaner and cleaner future. The synergy between the two organizations, combined with the global appeal of the Championship, makes it a great platform to promote our brand positioning.”He further said, “Formula E is increasingly working with content creators, influencers, and celebrities, with initiatives such as the Evo Sessions making an impact through digital channels beyond the racing itself, which is also an essential part of ABB’s new brand strategy. Going forward, we will be enhancing the way we harness the benefits of this collaboration, ensuring the focus is on delivering content and activations that reinforce our new messaging, build familiarity, and tell the ‘Engineered to Outrun’ story. ”Formula E Chief Revenue Officer Tiziana Di Gioia said, “Our renewed partnership with ABB is a testament to the commercial power and benefit of Formula E as a global platform that drives both brand and business growth. ABB, like our wider partnership portfolio, has and continues to see enormous value in collaborating with the fastest-growing motorsport on the planet, with viewership, commercial integration, and brand storytelling continuing to accelerate. Over eight seasons, ABB has moved from brand visibility to brand activation—integrating deeply into the fan experience, the sport’s ecosystem, and our innovation narrative.Also Read: Antonio Felix Da Costa shares happy memories as Porsche wins Formula E Teams and Manufacturers’ World Championships “This next chapter elevates the partnership even further. With ABB’s new positioning, we are co-creating opportunities across content, digital storytelling, and market engagement, transforming a title partnership into a year-round, value-generating relationship. It’s a model of how modern sponsorships should evolve, rooted in purpose and cultural alignment but measured by impact,” she added.Formula E Season 12 will begin with testing in Valencia in October.","ABB and Formula E have announced that they will continue their partnership in the upcoming season.

Canadian teenager Victoria Mboko , ranked 85th in the world, defeated four-time Grand Slam champion Naomi Osaka 2-6, 6-4, 6-1 to win her first WTA title at the Canadian Open in Montreal on Thursday. The 18-year-old, who started the season outside the top 300, is now projected to rise to 34th in the world rankings after her remarkable victory over the 27-year-old Japanese star.Mboko's path to victory included impressive wins over multiple Grand Slam champions throughout the tournament. She eliminated former Australian Open champion Sofia Kenin in the second round, defeated reigning French Open champion Coco Gauff in the fourth, and overcame former Wimbledon winner Elena Rybakina in the semifinals after saving a match point.""It's been an incredible week here in Montreal,"" Mboko said at the trophy presentation.

Toronto:

Four-time Grand Slam champion Naomi Osaka and Canadian teen sensation Victoria Mboko booked a championship showdown with gritty semi-final wins on Wednesday in the WTA Canadian Open in Montreal.Japan's Osaka, chasing her first tour-level title since the 2021 Australian Open, saved a pair of set points in the second-set tiebreak to polish off a 6-2, 7-6 (9/7) victory over Denmark's Clara Tauson -- who was coming off victories over Wimbledon champion Iga Swiatek and Australian Open winner Madison Keys.Mboko saved a match point in a thrilling 1-6, 7-5, 7-6 (7/4) victory over former Wimbledon champion Elena Rybakina.The 18-year-old wild card fed off the energy of the crowd, crediting ecstatic supporters with carrying her through after a tumble left her with a sore right wrist in the third set of her first tour-level semi-final.Mboko, who ousted top-seeded French Open champion Coco Gauff in the fourth round, didn't let it stop her.After going down an early break in the third set she refused to go quietly, loading up on her forehand and fending off a match point as she broke Rybakina in the 10th game to level the set.A couple of untimely double faults helped ninth-seeded Rybakina break back for a 6-5 lead, but the ninth seed from Kazakhstan was broken to love in the next game, setting the stage for the tiebreak drama."" After I had that fall I wasn't in the greatest spirits, but I'm happy that I kept my composure and I was kind of patient in the right moments,"" said Mboko, who won the last three points of a decider she called ""stressful"".""Anything can happen,"" an exhausted Mboko beamed as the crowd's cheers rained down on her.""Unfortunately I fell, but I had everyone supporting me and pushing me.""Mboko started the season ranked outside the top 300 but had worked her way up to 85th coming into the week by grinding away in lower-level tournaments.She is assured of breaking into the top 40 no matter the result against Osaka, a former world number one who has struggled to find consistency since returning from maternity leave in 2024 after more than a year away.Osaka has looked re-energized this week after a coaching shakeup and rolled through the first set against Tauson.But Tauson twice regained a break in the second set as she pushed it to the tiebreaker where she had chances to level the match after taking a 6-4 lead.Unable to convert her set points, the Dane saved one match point to make it 7-7, but Osaka won the next two to seal the victory and reach her first final in a WTA 1000 level event since Miami in 2022.""Definitely really happy,"" said Osaka, who started the week ranked 49th in the world. ""(I'm) excited to play my first hard court final back.""Osaka, whose performance so far this week means she's assured of rising high enough in the rankings to be seeded at the US Open later this month, was bracing for a tough match against a player who said in a youthful interview that she idolised the Japanese star.""I watched her play today because they were the match in front of us. I thought it was really impressive how she stayed calm,"" said Osaka, adding that Mboko's rebound from match point down was ""really impressive for an 18-year-old.""Karen Khachanov rallied to defeat top seed Alexander Zverev and book an ATP Toronto Masters title clash with Ben Shelton, who beat second seeded Taylor Fritz on Wednesday.Khachanov fought back from 3-1 down in the final-set tiebreaker to beat Zverev 6-3, 4-6, 7-6 (7/4).Shelton, seeded fourth, hammered Fritz 6-4, 6-3 in the first All-American Masters 1000 semifinal in 15 years to book the fifth, and most important, ATP final of his career.Russia's Khachanov, seeded 11th, had lost two previous semi-finals in Canada. But he dug deep to advance, saving a match point as he levelled the deciding set at 6-6, with world number three Zverev hammering a backhand into the top tape of the net.The German committed 44 unforced errors in the nearly three-hour defeat while Khachanov had 29 winners and 34 uforced errors.""I had to work out this match, dig deep and try my best,"" Khachanov said. ""It was very demanding physically and mentally.""We've had a lot of matches and I'm happy to beat him after losing some easy ones,"" addd Khachanov, who fell to Zverev in the Tokyo Olympic singles final. ""Today was a tough one - I was match point down.""I'm just happy things went on my side at the end.""Khachanov said it got tense at the end.""When you reach the final tiebreak, you have to play your best. You can't waste time and energy with negative thoughts or you won't succeed. You never know what will happen but you have to give it a try.""Khachanov will be playing his first final of the season after semi-final defeats in Barcelona and Halle.Shelton and Fritz had to wait out a brief delay when a problem with the electronic line calling system emerged as they took the court.But that was barely a blip for 22-year-old Shelton, the world number seven, who had beaten Alex de Minaur in the quarter-finals and with the win over Fritz notched his first back-to-back victories over top 10 opponents.US Open finalist Fritz had to save four break points in the third game of the match and was broken in the ninth game to leave Shelton to serve for the set.Shelton seized a second break for a 3-2 lead in the second, landing a perfect lob over Fritz's head and held at love for a 5-3 lead.He closed out the masterclass in with another break, Fritz mangling his racquet over his knee after he double faulted on match point.""I'm happy with my level and how I executed,"" Shelton said. ""I've seen so many big improvements in my game this week. That's what I'm most happy about, how I'm executing, how little I'm hesitating, how I'm returning.""Beating two top 10 guys back-to-back is huge for me.""I felt I had the ball on a string,"" he added. ""I'm excited to play like this, hitting the ball and expecting it to go in.""","Four-time Grand Slam champion Naomi Osaka and Canadian teen sensation Victoria Mboko book a championship showdown.

Victoria Mboko, an 18-year-old American-born Canadian tennis player, became the WTA National Bank Open champion in Montreal after claiming upset victories over top seed Coco Gauff, Sofia Kenin, 2022 Wimbledon champion Elena Rybakina and four-time Grand Slam winner Naomi Osaka in the final.The teenager, who began 2025 ranked 333rd, is now set to move into the top-50 when rankings are updated next week after accumulating 53 wins and nine losses this year.Mboko is the first Canadian to win a WTA 1000 event since Bianca Andreescu's title run in 2019 and had earlier become the youngest woman to reach the semis since Belinda Bencic's 2015 win in Toronto.The youngest of four tennis-playing siblings from a Congolese immigrant family, Mboko made her WTA Tour main-draw debut at age 15 in the 2022 Canadian Open doubles draw. Her first professional singles title came at the ITF W25 tournament in Saskatoon in 2022, which she successfully defended in 2023.Her breakthrough 2025 season began with victories in two ITF W35 tournaments in the Caribbean. She received a Miami wild card, where she secured her first tour-level victory over Camila Osorio before pushing Paula Badosa to a deciding set.""Anyone who knew her in Canadian tennis would not be surprised.She has so much power to her game. I remember practising with her when she was 14 or 15 years old and she was smacking forehands and bowling me off the court, so we all knew she would be really good,"" said former Wimbledon finalist Genie Bouchard.""I'm very impressed with how cool, calm and collected she was on the court. She looked much more mature than her 18 years of age. You see her on the court and she's handling it like she's done it a hundred times,"" Bouchard added.After her loss to Mboko, Coco Gauff praised the rising star: ""She's very athletic. She's a great ball striker, and she seems pretty positive out there on the court, doesn't get really too negative. I think she has a great support system around her, and that's important when you're young and on tour.""Mboko's success stems from her family's support, particularly her siblings. Her sister Gracia, who played tennis for the University of Denver, and brother Kevin, a tennis coach in suburban Toronto, help keep her focused during tournaments.""There is so much happening even behind the scenes,"" Mboko said. ""I feel like my family has been doing a good job of keeping me, I guess, isolated from it all. I have just been enjoying the moment. I have been enjoying time with my sister and my brother. I don't have so many people around me, and it's kept me very calm and very comfortable.""The Mboko family moved from the Democratic Republic of Congo nearly three decades ago to escape the Congo Wars of the mid-1990s. After living in North Carolina, where Victoria was born, they settled in Toronto when she was an infant.Mboko's game features aggressive play combined with variety, including drop shots and slices. She can serve at 120 mph and grew up admiring Serena Williams. Her coach is former world No. 3 Nathalie Tauziat, known for her varied playing style.Her recent success includes qualifying for her first Grand Slam main draw at the French Open, reaching the third round before falling to Olympic gold medalist Zheng Qinwen. She also stunned 25th-seeded Magdalena Frech in the first round at Wimbledon.","Victoria Mboko is the WTA National Bank Open champion in Montreal. The 18-year- old beat Coco Gauff, Sofia Kenin, 2022 Wimbledon champion Elena Rybakina and four-time Grand Slam winner Naomi Osaka in the final. Mboko will rise to the top-50 of WTA Rankings next week after a big two weeks.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123156517,imgsize-103366,width-400,resizemode-4/123156517.jpg"

Montreal:

Zverev to meet Khachanov in ATP Toronto semi-finals

Toronto:

Elena Rybakina, the 2022 Wimbledon champion, and Canadian teen Victoria Mboko advanced to a WTA Canadian Open semi-final matchup with triumphs on Monday in the Montreal hard court event.World number 12 Rybakina of Kazakhstan led 6-1, 2-1 when Ukraine's Marta Kostyuk retired in the second set with a wrist injury.Mboko, the shocker of the event, dispatched Spain's Jessica Bouzas Maneiro 6-4, 6-2 by taking the final six games to reach her first WTA 1000 semi-final in pursuit of her first trip to a WTA final.""I'm so excited to be in the semi-final here,"" Mboko told the supportive home nation crowd. ""I want to thank everyone for your support once again. It has been unreal.""Rybakina won their only prior meeting 6-3, 7-5 last month in the second round at Washington.The top five seeds and seven of the top 10 seeds were ousted before the quarter-finals, opening the door for such upstarts as 18-year-old Mboko, who eliminated top seed Coco Gauff.World number 85 Mboko, who began the year raked 333rd in the world, has ensured herself a jump into the top 50 for the first time in her career next week.Mboko broke 51st-ranked Bouzas Maneiro for a 5-3 lead. The Spaniard broke back in the ninth game only to drop the first set after 43 minutes when Mboko broke again.Bouzas Maneiro broke to open the second set then held but Mboko never dropped a game from there, taking the match after 77 minutes when the Spaniard sent a backhand beyond the baseline.The crowd, which chanted ""it's not over"" in French after the match, has been the best part of the amazing run, Mboko said.""I train here (in Canada) and it's always a great opportunity to be here,"" Mboko said. ""My first time playing in Montreal has been an unreal experience and I couldn't be more grateful.""Rybakina, seeded ninth, seeks her third WTA title after Rome and Indian Wells in 2023. She has not reached a final since last year at Miami.Rybakina broke 24th-seeded Kostyuk to open the match and led 2-1 when Kostyuk received medical treatment on her right wrist and forearm.Kostyuk netted a backhand to surrender a break in the fifth game and Rybakina broke again to claim the first set in 37 minutes when Kostyuk sent a forehand long.In the second set, Rybakina held twice before Kostyuk retired after 54 minutes due to her wrist issues, walking off the court in tears.Tuesday's quarter-final matches send four-time Grand Slam champion Naomi Osaka of Japan against Ukraine's 10th-seeded Elina Svitolina and US sixth seed Madison Keys, this year's Australian Open champion, against Danish 16th seed Clara Tauson.Alexander Zverev reached his 21st Masters 1000 semi-final on Monday by ending the Canadian title defence of Alexei Popyrin 6-7 (8/10), 6-4, 6-3 at the ATP Toronto Masters.The final game, with Zverev serving at 5-3, was interrupted by shouts from an unruly fan who was tossed out by security.The distraction ended a run of 14 consecutive points on serve, with the seed double-faulting once he was able to continue serving.He finished off the evening with a sharp volley winner at the net on his first match point.Zverev completed his 40th win of the year in just over two and a half hours.The world number three won the tournament in 2017 but had not been past the quarter-finals in Canada since.""After losing the first set, I had to tell myself we were both playing well,"" the holder of seven Masters trophies said.""I had one or two mistakes at the end of the first, but it was a high-level match.""I felt that if I kept playing well, I would get my chances -- and I did. I can't complain about the second and third sets.""Zverev will bid for the oddly scheduled Thursday final against three-time semi-finalist Karen Khachanov, who dismissed young American Alex Michelsen 6-4, 7-6 (7/3).""It was a very close, competitive match,"" Khachanov said. ""I had to come back from some tough situations.""How you handle that mentally is important. I was glad to close it out in the second set.""I had to try and not give him the opportunity to step in and attack; that's what I did today.""Zverev has won five of the seven matches he has played against Khachanov.Popyrin and Zverev duelled throughout the evenly matched 71-minute opening set as it went into a tiebreaker.Zverev was unable to convert on two winning chances, but Popyrin came good on his own second opportunity with a net cord winner that caught his opponent stranded at the baseline.The German began to turn the tables in the second set, taking a 4-1 lead only to see the Aussie level at 4-all.Zverev pulled away to level the match at a set apiece, breaking for 6-4 as Popyrin sent a volley wide.The top seed began the final set with a 3-0 lead on his way into the tournament final four at the pre-US Open event.Popyrin remains winless against Zverev after losing all four of their matches.","Elena Rybakina and Victoria Mboko reach WTA Canadian Open semi-final. World number 12 Ryb Bakina wins 6-1, 2-1 after Marta Kostyuk retires with wrist injury. Mboko defeats Spain's Jessica Bouzas Maneiro 6-4, 6-2. Alexander Zverev reaches ATP Toronto Masters semi-finals.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123114523,imgsize-83580,width-400,resizemode-4/123114523.jpg"

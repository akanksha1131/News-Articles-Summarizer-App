‘Street smart’ Rachin key for CSK

CHENNAI: The floodlights at the MA Chidambaram Stadium hadn’t yet flickered on, but Virat Kohli was already at work, fine-tuning his strokes on Thursday. That, in a nutshell, would tell you how charged the champion batter is to make it count against a team that has bothered him through his illustrious IPL career. And even after that intense session, he wasn’t quite done.At the pre-match press talk, RCB mentor Dinesh Karthik , in awe of Kohli’s pursuit of perfection, said: “I spoke to him just now as I came out and he said that he wanted to work on one more shot. At this point of time, to work on one more shot tells you the hunger he has. He wants to just improve and keep raising the bar. He’s a special player. The way I see it, he’s batting as confidently and as well as he has ever done in IPL.”While the MA Chidambaram Stadium over the years hasn’t exactly been a happy hunting ground for Kohli in the IPL, his unbeaten 90 (off 52 balls) in Dubai in 2021 remains the highest individual score by an RCB batter against the five-time champions.Against CSK spinners at Chepauk, however, his highest is an unflattering 58 with a strike-rate of 113 — slightly below-par by his own lofty standards. Karthik, though, dismissed any doubts about Kohli’s ability to handle spin, pointing to his success in major tournaments.“Kohli scored some serious runs in the recent Champions Trophy. He has batted well against spinners in the recent past, especially in white-ball cricket. He was the second-highest run-getter in Dubai and that doesn’t come without playing spin. I believe right now he’s batting as well as he has ever done,” he said.While the spotlight remains on the seasoned stars, New Zealand’s young all-rounder Rachin Ravindra has shown glimpses of why he could be a key player for the Super Kings this season. His match-winning unbeaten 65 in their opener against Mumbai Indians underlined his growing stature, and against RCB, he could once again be the difference-maker.His ability to counter spin makes him a vital cog in the CSK batting lineup, a feature that head coach Stephen Fleming highlighted about his fellow Kiwi.“His game against spin has always been very good. His development over the last 12 months has been excellent. His last game against RCB (IPL 2024), was one of his best innings (61 off 37 balls). He’s contributed a number of runs for New Zealand. His knock against MI was superb in terms of controlling the tempo of the game. He’s got the power and he’s street-smart,” Fleming said.",Virat Kohli and Rachin Ravindra could be key for CSK against RCB. Kohli's unbeaten 90 in Dubai in 2021 remains the highest individual score by an RCB batter against the five-time champions. New Zealand’s young all-rounder RavindRA has shown glimpses of why he could be a key player for the Super Kings.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119628913,imgsize-48532,width-400,resizemode-4/119628913.jpg"

Vyshak Vijaykumar reveals how Shreyas Iyer and Arshdeep Singh backed his 'wide yorkers' plan

Bombay Sports Exchange Episode 1: Interview with Sanjog Gupta, CEO (Sports) at JioStar

NEW DELHI: First, it was Shardul Thakur who rattled Sunrisers Hyderabad with a sensational spell, grabbing four wickets, including the prized scalp of Ishan Kishan for a golden duck. Then, Nicholas Pooran unleashed his brute power, launching a relentless assault with the bat to propel Lucknow Super Giants to their first victory of the Indian Premier League 2025. Led by Rishabh Pant, LSG secured a commanding five-wicket win over Sunrisers Hyderabad at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium on Thursday.Opting to bowl first, LSG were off to a perfect start, thanks to the brilliance of Shardul. The experienced pacer wreaked havoc early, dismissing Abhishek Sharma and Kishan off consecutive deliveries in the third over.Kishan, SRH’s centurion from the previous game, was dismissed for a golden duck, putting the home side on the back foot.Despite an aggressive counterattack from Travis Head, who smashed a 28-ball 47, Thakur’s relentless bowling kept SRH in check. He later returned to dismiss Abhinav Manohar and Mohammed Shami, finishing with figures of 4/34 in his four overs.LSG’s young bowlers, Prince Yadav and Digvesh Rathi, also made valuable contributions, with Yadav removing the dangerous Head and Rathi dismissing the hard-hitting Aniket Verma.SRH skipper Pat Cummins provided some late fireworks with an 18-run cameo off four balls, but LSG’s bowlers ensured that SRH did not breach the 200-run mark.Chasing 191, LSG had a shaky start as Aiden Markram fell cheaply to Mohammed Shami.However, what followed was sheer carnage.Pooran came out all guns blazing, dismantling the SRH bowling attack with breathtaking stroke play. The left-hander unleashed a relentless assault, smashing seven fours and six towering sixes en route to a 26-ball 70.Mitchell Marsh (52 off 31) provided strong support, while Rishabh Pant (15 off 15) ensured LSG remained in control.Despite Cummins dismissing Pooran and Harshal Patel removing Pant, David Miller’s unbeaten 13 and Abdul Samad’s 22 sealed the win for the away side -- with 23 balls to spare.LSG will next face Punjab Kings on Tuesday at the Bharat Ratna Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee Ekana Cricket Stadium in Lucknow.","Lucknow Super Giants beat Sunrisers Hyderabad by five wickets.

Axar may be promoted, Varun, Abhishek & NKR set to get maiden BCCI contracts

'It was for all the supporters': Ishan Kishan on animated celebration after scoring hundred

Mumbai: In-form batter Shreyas Iyer is set to regain his BCCI central contract when the top brass of the Indian cricket board announces the full list of retained players for the 2024-25 season sometime this week.It's learnt that the BCCI secretary Devajit Saikia will meet India's head coach Gautam Gambhir, currently vacationing in France with his family after leading India to victory in the 2025 ICC Champions Trophy and chief selector Ajit Agarkar in Guwahati on March 29 for a discussion on the central contracts.Guwahati is set to host the IPL match between Rajasthan Royals and Chennai Super Kings on March 30, a day after these discussions.The BCCI announced the India women's cricketers' contracts three days ago.While Iyer is set to get back his BCCI central contract, things are not that certain for Ishan Kishan, who too had been excluded from the list of players with central contracts for the 2023-24 season last year, given that both players skipped domestic matches despite clear instructions from the apex Indian cricketing body.""Shreyas is set to regain his contract, and it will be in a top category. However, discussions are still ongoing on whether in Ishan's case,"" a source told TOI.Iyer was the highest run-getter for India in in India's victorious campaign in the 2025 Champions Trophy recently, scoring 243 runs in five matches at 48.60, with two fifties, and is an integral part of India's ODI side, while Kishan made a sensational debut for Sunrisers Hyderabad in IPL-2025 on March 23, smashing 106 not out off just 47 balls against Rajasthan Royals.The other big point of discussion has been whether India's ODI and Test captain Rohit Sharma, superstar batsman Virat Kohli and allrounder Ravindra Jadeja will be retained in the highest A+ category of central contracts, despite having retired from T20Is.However, a source in the BCCI informed that ""all three will be retained in the highest category, along with Jasprit Bumrah.""Rohit, of course, is slated to lead India on their five-Test tour of England this summer.Meanwhile, left-arm spinning allrounder Axar Patel, who has grown in stature over the last few years and is now the vice-captain of India's T20 side, is likely to be promoted from Grade B to Grade A. He played key roles in India's two ICC title wins in the last two years.Meanwhile, ""Mystery spinner"" Varun Chakravarthy, who made a successful return to the Indian team last October and played a stellar role in India winning the 2025 Champions Trophy with nine wickets to his name in just three matches, is set to bag his maiden BCCI contract.Also set to receive their first BCCI central contracts will be young allrounder Nitish Kumar Reddy, who was impressive in the 2024-25 Border-Gavaskar Trophy, where he played all five Tests in the series and cracked his maiden hundred in the Boxing Day Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, and young opener Abhishek Sharma, who smashed a phenomenal 135 off just 54 balls against England in the fifth and final T20I at the Wankhede Stadium on Feb 2 this year.The name of former off-spinning great Ravichandran Ashwin, who retired during India's tour of Australia last winter, will be naturally removed from the list of BCCI’s centrally-contracted players after he announced his international retirement last year during the Australia tour.Also see: SRH vs LSG Live Score",Shreyas Iyer is set to regain his BCCI central contract for 2024-25 season.

Bombay Sports Exchange Episode 1: Interview with Sanjog Gupta, CEO (Sports) at JioStar

NEW DELHI: The Indian Premier League (IPL) 2025 clash between Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) and Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) on Thursday saw an emerging talent make headlines.Prince Yadav , a relatively unknown name before the season, delivered a crucial breakthrough by dismissing the in-form Travis Head , who had been threatening to take the game away but eventually became Prince's maiden scalp in IPL.LSG found themselves in a high-pressure situation as Head looked dangerous at the crease, having already smashed 47 runs off just 28 balls. However, in the eighth over, Prince Yadav struck.Bowling a full delivery on middle and off, he completely outfoxed the Australian, who cleared his front leg for a heave but missed it entirely.The ball crashed into the stumps, silencing the Uppal crowd. The LSG dugout, including Zaheer Khan, erupted in applause as the 23-year-old seamer celebrated the massive wicket.Born on December 12, 2001, Prince Yadav is a right-arm fast bowler who rose through the ranks via the Delhi Premier League . His breakthrough came in the 2024 season when he played for Rishabh Pant’s Purani Delhi 6 franchise.His ability to mix up his pace with minimal change in action set him apart, as he finished the season with 13 wickets in 10 matches.His standout performances earned him a white-ball debut for Delhi, where he had already played two Ranji Trophy games.He made an immediate impact in the 2024-25 Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy (SMAT), taking two crucial wickets against Uttar Pradesh, dismissing both a well-set Nitish Rana and Sameer Rizvi.Prince Yadav’s impressive performances did not go unnoticed. Just a day after his SMAT debut, the IPL 2025 mega auction took place, and Lucknow Super Giants secured his services for Rs 30 lakh.He continued his stellar form, emerging as Delhi’s highest wicket-taker in SMAT 2024-25 with 11 wickets at an economy rate of 7.54, helping them reach the semi-finals.With his ability to deliver under pressure and take big wickets, he, being part of injury-laden LSG bowling line-up, is fast becoming a player to watch in IPL 2025.Also see: SRH vs LSG Live Score","Prince Yadav is a right-arm fast bowler who rose through the ranks via the Delhi Premier League.

NEW DELHI: Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) skipper Rishabh Pant ’s decision to bowl first after winning the toss against Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) in their IPL 2025 clash has left many puzzled.Given SRH’s explosive batting lineup, many expected LSG to set a target rather than chase one. However, Pant had a clear strategy in mind.Speaking at the toss, Pant stated that his team was confident in their ability to chase any total.""We will bowl first. I think we have to get them out early and look to chase the target. It depends on the team combination; that's why we want to bowl first. We have the batting to chase it down,” Pant explained.LSG made a tactical change, bringing back Avesh Khan in place of Shahbaz Ahmed to bolster their pace attack.Sunrisers Hyderabad, led by Pat Cummins , boast one of the most destructive batting lineups in the tournament.They made a statement in their opening match, smashing 286 runs against Rajasthan Royals.The likes of Ishan Kishan, Abhishek Sharma, Travis Head , and Heinrich Klaasen can decimate any bowling attack on their day.Pant’s gamble revolves around early breakthroughs. If LSG’s bowlers can disrupt SRH’s power-packed top order, they might prevent another massive total.However, if the bowlers fail, LSG could be staring at another massive chase.While LSG's batting is strong, their middle-order inconsistency cost them their last game against Delhi Capitals.Despite a strong start from Mitchell Marsh and a late flourish from Nicholas Pooran, they lost momentum in the middle overs. This time, Pant will hope his batters step up if they are set a daunting target.With a high-scoring tournament already underway, Pant’s decision is a bold one. Whether it pays off or backfires will be the big question in this blockbuster encounter.Also see: SRH vs LSG Live Score","Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) skipper Rishabh Pant asked Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) to bat first.

India win Champions Trophy title; Rohit Sharma confirms he's not retiring

Champions Return: Rohit, Hardik, Shreyas, Gambhir return after India's title triumph

Former cricketer Sunil Gavaskar has questioned whether current coach Gautam Gambhir will follow Rahul Dravid 's example of sharing prize money equally with support staff after India's Champions Trophy victory.The exact amount of prize money allocated to Gambhir and the support staff remains undisclosed.""After the ICC T20 World Cup win and the Board announcement of prize money, the then-coach Rahul Dravid, ever the team man, refused to accept more than his fellow members of the coaching staff and shared it equally with his colleagues,"" Gavaskar wrote in his column for""It's been a fortnight since the BCCI announced the Champions Trophy rewards, but we haven't heard anything from the current coach on whether he will also do a Dravid. Or is it that Dravid, in this instance, is not a good role model?"" Gavaskar asked.The Board of Control for Cricket in India had announced a reward of Rs 58 crore for the Champions Trophy-winning squad and support staff, following India's victory under Rohit Sharma's leadership.""Now, after our boys won the Champions Trophy, the BCCI announced a whopping Rs 58 crore for the squad and the support staff and selection committee. In July last year, after the stirring victory in the ICC T20 World Cup, the BCCI announced Rs 125 crore for the squad, support staff and selectors,"" Gavaskar wrote.""This is truly fantastic, as the Board, which is now awash with funds, is showing its appreciation for the efforts put in by everybody and rewarding them generously.

HYDERABAD: The talk ahead of the Sunrisers Hyderabad ’s (SRH) clash against Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) was about whether the hosts would scale Mount 300. The odds were stocked heavily against the visitors with their bowling unit in disarray. But when Rishabh Pant chose to bowl, it looked like he had plans in place for the hosts’ dangerous batting order. And his bowlers justified him.After being ignored at the death by captain Pant in his side’s one-wicket loss to Delhi Capitals in Visakhapatnam, 'Player of the Match' Shardul Thakur returned impressive figures of 4/34 to restrict Sunrisers Hyderabad to 190/9.The diminutive Nicholas Pooran then took charge. He showcased his big-hitting prowess with a 26-ball 70 (6x4, 6x6). He added 116 runs with Mitchell Marsh (52; 31b; 7x4, 2x6) that eventually sealed a five-wicket victory for LSG with 23 deliveries to spare.Though the visitors lost Aiden Markram (1) in Mohammed Shami’s first over, Pooran went berserk. He smashed Simarjeet Singh and Abhishek Sharma for two sixes, plundering 17 and 18 runs each. Marsh was not far behind as he smashed Shami for two sixes and the visitors raced to 77/1 in the first six overs.Pooran then hit Zampa for 19 runs with two sixes and a boundary in the seventh over to complete his halfcentury in 18 deliveries. The LSG No. 3 contributed 70 runs to the second-wicket partnership before he was trapped in front by Pat Cummins in the 9th over.Marsh reached his fifty in 29 balls (7x4, 2x6) but holed out to long-on off Cummins in the 11th over. But by then, the duo had reduced the target to 53 from 54 balls.Abdul Samad 22* (8b; 2x4, 2x6) and David Miller (13*) finished the game that was set up by the LSG bowlers.Thakur struck in his second over, dismissing Abhishek (6) and last-match centurion Kishan (0) off successive deliveries. Travis Head (47; 28b, 5x4, 3x6) hit the first six of the night in the fourth over off Avesh Khan and another over extra cover and a boundary for 18 runs as Avesh looked rusty in his first match since January.Head got two reprieves in Ravi Bishnoi’s first over. Pooran dropped a sitter at long-on with Head on 35. Two balls later, Bishnoi grassed a tough caught and bowled chance.","Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) beat Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) by five wickets.

GUWAHATI: With the current Indian Premier League (IPL) season witness to some high-scoring games in the opening week, Wednesday’s match at the ACA Stadium then looked like an aberration.The Barsapara track offered help for the tweakers as Kolkata Knight Riders spinners, Varun Chakravarthy and Moeen Ali , ran through hosts Rajasthan Royals’ middle order to choke the flow of runs to restrict them to 151.On the wicket, Ali said, “It was good one, had a bit of everything — swing, bit of seam, spun nicely but not massively, just enough spin. I played here in the England warmup games (ahead of 2023 ODI World Cup); it’s a very nice ground.”Ali added that it was good that the track offered something for the bowlers.“Some of the wickets are amazing. India is a great place to bat actually, and when the wickets are like this, you’re not going to get 300, you probably won’t even get 200. So it’s great to have these games in between those big ones,” said Ali.Ali combined well with Chakravarthy as the duo shared four wickets between them. The English allrounder had praise for his ‘mystery’ partner Chakravarthy.“I came on before him (seventh over), so my job was to bowl tight. I’m used to bowling with somebody who’s better and has more mystery. So I bowl as tight as I can and hopefully, that builds pressure for them to get wickets,” Ali said.“Varun’s a brilliant bowler who has improved so much over the last two-three years. It’s amazing to bowl with him.”",Kolkata Knight Riders restrict Rajasthan Royals to 151. Moeen Ali and Varun Chakravarthy take four wickets between them.

NEW DELHI: After losing their opening game to Royal Challengers Bengaluru, the defending champions finally gained momentum in their Indian Premier League title defense by defeating Rajasthan Royals by eight wickets at Guwahati’s ACA Stadium. While Kolkata Knight Riders skipper Ajinkya Rahane was denied favourable conditions at their home ground - Eden Gardens - in the opening match, the team thrived in Guwahati and secured their first win of the tournament. Quinton de Kock played a crucial role, scoring an unbeaten 97 runs to guide KKR to victory in style.Ahead of KKR's opening game against RCB at Eden Gardens, reports had suggested that pitch curator Sujan Mukherjee had denied skipper Rahane's request for a pitch that supported more spin.To this, Mukherjee had stated that the pitch would not change “as long as I’m here.”Former New Zealand cricketer and commentator Simon Doull suggested that KKR should consider “moving the franchise away somewhere else.”“If he’s (the curator) not taking heed of what the home team wants… I mean they are paying the stadium fees, they are paying for what’s going on in the IPL but if he’s still not paying heed of what the home team wants, then just move the franchise away to somewhere else. His job is not to pass an opinion on the game. That’s not what he’s paid for,” Doull said on Cricbuzz.Harsha Bhogle also supported Doull’s view, stating: “If they are playing at home, should get the tracks that they think are suited for their bowlers. I saw something what the KKR curator has said.""""If I’m in the KKR camp, I’m extremely unhappy of what he said because I’m not asking for a 120 surface. I’m just saying, give me a surface where my bowlers can win matches. To say, ‘sorry, we don’t prepare pitches like that…’ No. We are not asking you to make a 120 pitch, we are not asking you to make a 240 pitch. But I think home advantage in a tournament like IPL is absolutely legitimate. That will enhance the tournament because winning away becomes crucial then,” Bhogle said on the same show.","Kolkata Knight Riders beat Rajasthan Royals by eight wickets in Guwahati.

Bombay Sports Exchange Episode 1: Interview with Sanjog Gupta, CEO (Sports) at JioStar

NEW DELHI: Kolkata Knight Riders had a disappointing start to their IPL 2025 campaign against Royal Challengers Bengaluru on March 22 at Eden Gardens, but they bounced back in style on Wednesday. The defending champions put up a commanding performance to register their first win of the season, securing two valuable points in the standings. The star of the night was Quinton de Kock , whose stellar knock powered KKR to an emphatic eight-wicket victory over Rajasthan Royals . This win also marked KKR’s first triumph under Ajinkya Rahane ’s captaincy.De Kock’s brilliance ensured that KKR remained in control throughout the chase. His combination of clean ball-striking and sharp game awareness reaffirmed why he is regarded as one of the most dangerous openers in the IPL. His innings was a textbook display of counter-attacking cricket—starting with caution before seamlessly shifting gears to dismantle the opposition’s bowling attack with exquisite timing and brute power.With this dominant win, KKR not only got off the mark in IPL 2025 but also sent a strong statement to their rivals. Under Rahane’s leadership, the team has gained momentum, with de Kock leading the charge in spectacular fashion.Earlier in the match, Rahane won the toss and opted to field first, putting Rajasthan Royals on the back foot. Led by Riyan Parag, RR struggled to put up a competitive total as KKR’s disciplined bowling unit applied relentless pressure. Yashasvi Jaiswal (29 off 24) and Dhruv Jurel (33 off 28) were the only notable contributors as the Royals managed to post 151/9 in their 20 overs.KKR’s bowlers were clinical, with Varun Chakaravarthy (2/17) and Moeen Ali (2/23) stifling RR’s middle order, while Harshit Rana and Vaibhav Arora chipped in with crucial wickets to keep the total within reach.Chasing 152, KKR faced an early setback when opener Moeen Ali was run out for just 5. However, de Kock stepped up with an authoritative display, dismantling the RR bowling attack with a breathtaking array of strokes. Despite losing captain Rahane for 18, the South African wicketkeeper-batsman kept the chase on track with a flurry of boundaries and well-calculated big hits.De Kock’s explosive innings featured eight fours and six towering sixes, making light work of the Rajasthan bowling attack. His heroics ensured KKR cruised to victory with plenty of overs to spare.Next up, KKR will take on five-time champions Mumbai Indians at the Wankhede Stadium on Monday, looking to build on their newfound momentum.",Kolkata Knight Riders beat Rajasthan Royals by eight wickets in IPL 2025. Quinton de Kock was the star of the night with an impressive innings. The win was KKR's first under captain Ajinkya Rahane's captaincy.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119552064,imgsize-62794,width-400,resizemode-4/119552064.jpg"

NEW DELHI: In a thrilling IPL encounter, Shardul Thakur 's impressive four-wicket haul and Nicholas Pooran 's sensational display of power-hitting guided Lucknow Super Giants ( LSG ) to a five-wicket victory over Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) on Thursday.Thakur's dream comeback continued as he returned with figures of 4/34, helping LSG restrict the formidable SRH batting lineup to 190/9.Pooran then took center stage, showcasing his 360-degree hitting prowess with a blistering 70 off just 26 deliveries, including six fours and six maximums. His partnership with Mitchell Marsh (52 off 31) yielded a match-winning 116 runs for the second wicket, propelling LSG to chase down the target in just 16.1 overs.Despite losing Aiden Markram early in their chase, LSG surged ahead thanks to the effortless hitting from Marsh and Pooran. Pooran, in particular, was at his attacking best, dealing primarily in sixes and clobbering Simarjeet and Abhishek Sharma for massive hits, mostly towards the square boundary.SRH found it challenging to contain Pooran as he didn't even spare Cummins, hitting him for two fours in his first over to reach 77/1 in the powerplay. Pooran brought up the fastest fifty of the season in just 18 balls with another colossal six over square leg off Adam Zampa's bowling.Cummins eventually trapped Pooran in front of the wickets in the ninth over, but Marsh took the onus upon himself and brought up his half-century off just 29 balls. Although LSG skipper Rishabh Pant (15 off 15) couldn't contribute much, Abdul Samad played an entertaining cameo to guide his side home.Earlier, after opting to bowl first, Shardul (4/34) provided LSG with a fiery start, removing Abishek Sharma and the previous match's centurion, Ishan Kishan, in consecutive balls in the third over. While Shardul sent Sharma packing with a short delivery, he dismissed Kishan caught behind off an innocuous delivery down the leg side.Travis Head (47 off 28), however, looked in ominous form as he took the attack to the opposition, using his brute power to deal in boundaries and sixes. Head was particularly brutal against Avesh Khan, hitting him for two sixes and one four to pick up 18 runs in the fourth over.Head was fortunate to receive two reprieves, but his luck eventually ran out when fast bowler Prince Yadav disturbed his timbers to claim his first IPL wicket.Henrich Klaasen (26 off 17) was run out in a bizarre fashion by Yadav off his own bowling, while young Aniket Verma played a 13-ball 36-run cameo that included five sixes before falling to leg-spinner Disvesh Rathi.SRH skipper Pat Cummins (18 off 4) hit three sixes off his first three balls before departing in style, contributing to SRH's competitive total of 190/9.",Lucknow Super Giants ( LSG) beat Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) by five wickets. Shardul Thakur (4/34) and Nicholas Pooran (70) guided LSG to victory. LSG chased down the target of 190 in 16.1 overs.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119610693,imgsize-176716,width-400,resizemode-4/119610693.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Former England fast bowler Peter Lever has passed away at the age of 84. Lever played a pivotal role in helping England win the 1970-71 Ashes series in Australia, where he showcased his exceptional bowling skills.During his international career, Lever represented England in 17 Test matches , claiming 41 wickets. He also featured in 10 one-day internationals , including the historic inaugural match in the format against Australia in 1971.Lever's Test debut came during the 1970-71 tour to Australia, where he played under the captaincy of Raymond Illingworth. His impressive performances in Australia continued in 1975, when he recorded his career-best Test figures of six for 38 in Melbourne.However, Lever's career was not without controversy.In the pre-helmet era, he was involved in a serious incident during a 1975 Test in Auckland against New Zealand. Lever struck Ewen Chatfield on the head with a bouncer, and the tail-ender's life was saved only through emergency medical treatment after his heart briefly stopped.Reflecting on the incident, Lever expressed remorse, stating, ""I honestly thought I had killed him as I saw him lying there in convulsions. I felt sick and ashamed at what I had done, and all I could think when I got back to the pavilion was that I wanted to retire.""Chatfield later convinced Lever that he was not to blame for the accident.Alongside his international exploits, Lever enjoyed a successful domestic career with English county Lancashire.He played 301 First-Class matches for the county between 1960 and 1976, taking an impressive 796 wickets.Lancashire paid tribute to Lever on social media, expressing their sadness at his passing.The county wrote, ""We are deeply saddened by the news that Peter Lever has passed away, aged 84. Peter was inducted into our Hall of Fame last year after playing 301 First-Class matches between 1960 and 1976 -- taking 796 wickets. Our thoughts are with his family and friends.""Lever's contribution to English cricket, both at the international and domestic levels, will be remembered fondly.His achievements, particularly his role in the 1970-71 Ashes triumph and his impressive county career with Lancashire, have cemented his legacy as a formidable fast bowler of his era.","Former England fast bowler Peter Lever has passed away at the age of 84.

Madrid's compelling case

Follow Gerrard's lead?

Liverpool: Trent Alexander-Arnold 's proposed move from Liverpool to Real Madrid has split opinion on whether a local hero can leave Merseyside without a lasting stain on his legacy.Alexander-Arnold joined the Reds 20 years ago as a six-year-old and has gone on to win a clean sweep of Premier League, Champions League, FA Cup, League Cup, UEFA Super Cup and Club World Cup titles.His status is reflected in a mural that stands just metres from the club's Anfield stadium, emblazoned with the quote: ""I'm just a normal lad from Liverpool whose dream has just come true.""However, how he will be remembered for years to come in his home city will for many be dictated by the decision he takes in the coming weeks over his future.Alexander-Arnold's contract expires at the end of the season, meaning Madrid do not have to pay a transfer fee for a player who has smashed Premier League records when it comes to a creative output from a right-back.Here, AFP Sport looks at the key considerations facing the 26-year-old ahead of a career-defining call.Liverpool like to taunt their Premier League rivals with their six European Cups, making them by a distance the most successful English club in the competition's history.Madrid though are in a league of their own with 15 European Cup or Champions League triumphs, including six in the past 11 years.On top of the lifestyle benefits that a switch to the Spanish sunshine offers, Alexander-Arnold would be lining up each week alongside his close friend and England colleague Jude Bellingham , among a cast of stars also including Kylian Mbappe and Vinicius Junior.The spotlight at the state-of-the-art, newly refurbished Santiago Bernabeu could also offer Alexander-Arnold the chance to fulfil his dream of becoming the first full-back to win the Ballon d'Or.""I believe I can (win it),"" Alexander-Arnold told Sky Sports earlier this season. ""It's only the morning after you retire that you're able to look in the mirror and say, 'I gave it everything I got'.""It doesn't matter how many trophies you win, or how many medals you've got. It matters what you give to the game and if you reach your full potential.""By running his contract down, Alexander-Arnold is in a strong position to make millions from a signing-on bonus in lieu of Madrid having to pay a huge transfer fee.And he can argue there is little more to be gained by staying at Anfield.Liverpool are 12 points clear at the top of the Premier League, meaning by the time his current deal expires, Alexander-Arnold should be a two-time English champion to go with six other major trophies.""His legacy, I hope, is one of an outstanding homegrown footballer who's done incredibly well for this club,"" Steve McManaman, who himself made the move from Liverpool to Real Madrid on a free transfer back in 1999, told the BBC.McManaman won two Champions Leagues and two La Liga titles in his four years in the Spanish capital and yet is being used as the counter argument encouraging Alexander-Arnold to stay.""It's about his legacy at Liverpool and how he is seen. Do you want to be seen like (Steven) Gerrard or McManaman?"" former Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher, himself a one-club legend, said of Alexander-Arnold's choice.""He (McManaman) went to Real Madrid and won cups but he is not adored. If (Alexander-Arnold) stays, he will be remembered as one of the best to play for the club and not far behind Gerrard.""Alexander-Arnold is already the club's vice-captain and would be the natural heir to Virgil van Dijk.In contrast to the era of Gerrard, McManaman and Michael Owen, who swapped Liverpool for Madrid in 2004, he is part of a side regularly competing at the top of the Premier League and Champions League.Should he stay, Alexander-Arnold could be front and centre of trophy lifts in years to come as a local lad turned legend.But Liverpool are just the latest club to learn that the magnetism of Madrid is hard to resist.",Trent Alexander-Arnold's contract at Liverpool expires at the end of the season. The 26-year-old has been linked with a move to Spanish giants Real Madrid. Liverpool are 12 points clear at the top of the Premier League.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119593701,imgsize-117496,width-400,resizemode-4/119593701.jpg"

Shillong: Despite all the hype surrounding a Sunil Chhteri-Hamza Choudhury faceoff, all that the 14,952 fans gathered at JN Stadium here on Tuesday witnessed was a scrappy goalless draw.India head coach Manolo Marquez did not mince his words when he declared at the post-match press conference, “Maybe today (Tuesday) is the most difficult press conference in my career since I don’t want to say all the things that are in my head at this moment.”While the coach refused to give excuses for India’s dismal show in their opening home fixture of the AFC Asian Cup Qualifier , one could gauge all that might be running in the Spaniard’s head in a game that began with goalkeeper Vishal Kaith passing a regulation pass straight to the opposition winger and culminating in veteran Chhetri — called back from retirement by Marquez to aid India’s qualifying hopes — glancing a header wide and narrowly missing out.“I don’t want to talk too much, because I am very angry, disappointed with the performance of everyone, and it also must include that of the coach. I don’t have words to explain this poor, poor performance from everyone,” said Marquez. “This is not enough. But maybe this is the reality of Indian football.”The only bright spot for the hosts — apart from the intent shown by Liston Colaco, Boris Singh Thangjam and, occasionally, Farukh Choudhary — was that the other match in the group between Hong Kong and Singapore also ended in a stalemate, keeping all four teams level on one point each. So, in June when India travel to take on the 155th ranked Hong Kong, it would be a chance for a fresh start to their Saudi Arabia dream.While Marquez was not ready to give excuses, the end of the club season in April-end or the beginning of May, could give him and his wards the much-needed preparation and recovery time that they lacked in the lead-up to the Bangladesh first leg.“We can speak several hours about this one competition that you play Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday. And the players arrive at the national team with two days to go. Some may have played two days ago, another seven days ago and another five days ago. These may be called excuses, but the reality is that the physical condition is not the same if you played yesterday or one week ago,” said the coach, “But this is not the reason that we played a bad game today.”India were also lucky that Bangladesh failed to take advantage of the errors made in the Indian defence and the visiting coach rued the chance to change their recent stats against India and claim all three points.“Unfortunately, we missed clear chances, and we should have scored,” Javier Cabrera said at his post-match interaction. “But we must be positive. If we can get those chances away against India, the strongest team in the group, we can do better against the others. But it’s clear today that we are a contender to qualify for Asian Cup.“That is what we must believe in and then make it happen,” he added.Having represented U-21 England, where he was born, Hamza Choudhury made his first start for the country of his mother’s origin here on Tuesday, having officially made the switch at international level in December last year.“Oh, I was so proud when the national anthem began,” Choudhury, who has 50 caps for Leicester City in the Premier League, said after the match. “It gave me goosebumps.”It marks the first time ever a Premier League footballer played for Bangladesh.It could be Choudhury’s crowning achievement in an already promising career that included captaining his boyhood club Leicester and then becoming the first player of Bangladeshi origin to lift the FA Cup with the Premier League club in 2019.Choudhury used his platform to show solidarity for Palestine, just as he wishes to do in inspiring more South Asian representation in English football. And on Tuesday, although the 27-year-old focused on strengthening the Bangladesh backline, the motivation his teammates felt in his presence lifted the team’s game.“More than his qualities as a player, it’s his quality as a teammate that gives the team so much confidence,” coach Javier Cabrera said in the post-match interaction.His quality as a player was certainly evident in glimpses, especially while marking veteran Sunil Chhetri , but Choudhury — true to his personality — was quick to play down his influence upon the team.“We are actually strongest as a team. We are all looking out for one another,” he said. “I will do better for the team in the upcoming matches. I was just with the team for the last five days, which is a very short period,” further added Choudhury.","Hamza Choudhury made his first start for the country of his mother’s origin here on Tuesday, having officially made the switch at international level in December last year.

SHILLONG: The fans came out in large numbers, making their presence felt with some lusty cheering. But India, playing their second international match at the JN Stadium here, could not give them the joy they had hoped for as their opening AFC Asian Cup Qualifier against Bangladesh ended 0-0 on Tuesday.With the other match of Group C between Hong Kong and Singapore also ending in a 0-0 draw, all four in the group are level on one point each with five more games left to decide the toppers and eventual qualifiers for the tournament to be held Saudi Arabia in 2027.The match began on a frustrating note for India as they could have been two goals behind within the opening 20 minutes — due to silly mistakes by goalkeeper Vishal Kaith and Sandesh Jhingan. While Mojibor Jony failed to slot home a terrible clearance from Kaith in the opening minute, Shariyar Emon glanced wide a gorgeous cross from Mohammed Shakil Topu.India managed more possession in the first half but it was Hamza Choudhury’s game reading in midfield that kept Bangladesh in the hunt for a breakthrough. While Mohd Ridoy’s clearance of a Liston Colaco free-kick in the 23rd minute could have ended in an own goal, it was in the 31st minute that the best chance of the half came for India.Colaco sent a cross from the left flank to the right of the goal after combining from behind with Subhasish Bose. But Udanta’s diving header was saved by Bangladesh custodian Mitul Marma, who then went on to collect Farukh’s soft try from the ensuing rebound. The chance lifted India’s game with Colaco looking more dangerous and Sunil Chhetri lurking more often near the goal. However, the constant cheers from the stands could not inspire a breakthrough.India started the second half with more purpose. But with Hamza Choudhury marking Chhetri during set-pieces, the Indian legend failed to win his duels with the former Premier League veteran.Manolo Marquez’s ‘men in blue’ did come close in the 55th and 57th minutes.

Mohammed Ridoy attempted to capitalise with a left-footed shot, but Subhasish Bose made a vital clearance on the goal line.India's notable opportunity arrived in the 31st minute when Udanta Singh's header from Liston Colaco's left-wing cross was saved by Bangladesh keeper Mitul Marma.India's second-half dominance included Bose's ambitious long-range attempt in the 68th minute, which narrowly missed the left corner despite beating the goalkeeper.Five minutes afterwards, Farukh Choudhary's right-footed shot deflected off a Bangladeshi defender and went wide.In the 84th minute, Sunil Chhetri found space for a free header in the box, but his attempt lacked both accuracy and power.Bangladesh's Hamza Choudhury, on loan at Sheffield United from Leicester City, remained largely ineffective throughout the match.The teams will meet again on November 18 in Bangladesh.

Australia's Alex de Minaur put an end to Brazilian talent Joao Fonseca 's challenge at the Miami Open, outlasting the 18-year-old 5-7, 7-5, 6-3 in an enthralling contest.Attendance on stadium court had been sparse throughout Monday, but the Hard Rock Stadium turned into a mini-Maracana Stadium for Fonseca's match, complete with Brazilian flags and football-style chanting.Fonseca brought his energetic brand of ultra-attacking tennis, but De Minaur was up to the challenge, coping with both the blistering forehands and the partisan crowd.Such was the dominance of Fonseca's raucous support that the referee switched to Portuguese for his appeals for quiet.But de Minaur won six of the final seven games to move into the fourth round, keeping his cool even when the crowd, at times, disrupted his serve preparation.""Mentally I was ready for this match, I knew I was not only going to play an incredible talent like Joao, playing with immense confidence and nothing to lose, but also an incredible crowd that was on his side from the first point until the last,"" de Minaur said.""One of my biggest strengths is my mentality and that is what got me the win today,"" he added.Top seed Alexander Zverev recovered from a slow start to power into the fourth round of the Miami Open with a 7-5, 6-4 win against Australia's Jordan Thompson.The German was 4-1 down in the first set but then went on a roll, winning eight of the next nine games to progress.Zverev lost in the opening round at Indian Wells, but with Carlos Alcaraz already out in Miami he will fancy his chances of adding to his list of seven Masters 1000 titles.Third-seed Taylor Fritz also moved into the fourth round beating Denis Shapovalov of Canada 7-5, 6-3.The American let slip a 5-2 lead in the first set, but regained control with his serve proving too much for Shapovalov.In the women's draw, third-seed Coco Gauff 's bid ended with a 6-4 6-4 loss to Poland's Magda Linette .Top-seeded Aryna Sabalenka eased her way into the last eight with a 6-4, 6-4 win over last year's winner Danielle Collins of the USA.Next, Sabalenka will be up against ninth seeded Olympic gold medallist Zheng Qinwen who reached her second consecutive WTA 1000 quarter-final, with a straight-sets win over Ashlyn Krueger.""I'm super happy to get this win in straight sets and happy with the level I played today,"" said Sabalenka.""She's a tough opponent, and we had a lot of tough and tricky matches in the past. So was very happy to get through this one,"" she added.Italy's Jasmine Paolini enjoyed a 3-6, 6-4, 6-4 comeback win over Naomi Osaka in 2 hours and 15 minutes.Since her comeback from maternity leave 15 months ago, Osaka has been showing some signs of getting back towards her best but Paolini was the first top 10 player Osaka has faced this year.""I don't think that I can say that I've played a lot of matches against top players like this in a while,"" said Osaka.""The way she plays kind of catches me off guard, simply because of her height. I didn't know she could hit like that,"" she added.Emma Raducanu continued her impressive form in Miami, cruising to a 6-1, 6-3 victory in 69 minutes over American Amanda Anisimova, who had eliminated Indian Wells winner Mirra Andreeva on Sunday.It is the first time Raducanu has won four straight WTA Tour main draw matches in a row since her US Open triumph in 2021. She will face American Jessica Pegula next.Raducanu, who has brought in some old faces from the early days of her career for this tournament, said she was benefitting from their presence.""I'm really happy with how things are on and off the court right now and just so happy that's able to transfer on to the match court,"" she said.Alexandra Eala, the 19-year-old from the Philippines who upset Australian Open champion Madison Keys on Sunday, was handed a place in the quarter-finals after her fourth round opponent, Spain's Paula Badosa, pulled out with a lower back injury.In the last eight Eala will face second seed Iga Swiatek who battled past Ukraine's Elina Svitolina 7-6 (7/5) 6-3.","Alex de Minaur beats Joao Fonseca 5-7, 7-5, 6-3 in enthralling contest.

Alexandra Eala , a 19-year-old tennis player from the Philippines, achieved a historic victory at the Miami Open on Sunday by defeating Australian Open champion Madison Keys .This win marked a significant milestone as Eala became the first Filipino woman to defeat a top-10 ranked player since the ranking system's inception 50 years ago.The emotional victory saw Eala celebrating with her team, embracing them while fighting back tears.""It's a big thing to take in, and I feel it's important for me to take it in step by step. I'm so super proud of what I was able to accomplish, but it definitely fuels me more.""""I know and it's in my mind that I have a next match, but I need to stop, and I need to recognise that what I did today was really amazing. I think my reaction on court, you know, sums up pretty much how I feel about it.""At the age of 13, Eala's family made the decision to send her to Rafael Nadal's academy in Mallorca, Spain, recognizing her evident talent.The academy's exceptional coaching and facilities helped shape Eala into the 2022 US Open girls' singles champion and a competitive player on the WTA Tour .""The academy has been my home for the past seven years. Of course, my family should take credit for the foundation that they laid out before they sent me there.""""But of course, the academy was able to build on that foundation in such a way that I'm able to be where I am now. And I think the combination of everything that I've been through since I started tennis is what has led to this moment and what has led to me having all these opportunities.""The decision to move to Europe was made easier as her brother Miko also joined the academy.""It was definitely a big decision for me, for us. As soon as I heard that, I jumped at the opportunity because I knew that I had to get out of the country eventually to improve.""Eala's tennis journey began with her grandfather, a club player who coached her brother and cousins before focusing on her development.""I was kind of the next in line to do that and to spend time with him. It eventually blossomed into the career I have now.""Her victory came shortly after fellow Nadal Academy member Coleman Wong from Hong Kong defeated American 13th seed Ben Shelton in Miami.""I'm super happy for him and to see someone that I've known so long do so well is definitely an inspiration. Not just to me, but I feel in general a lot of people can take inspiration from him.""Despite her success, Eala maintains a humble perspective about being a role model for young players in the Philippines.""The young kids, the youth in the Philippines, they don't need to take inspiration from me. They can take inspiration from anyone they want. You know, they can take inspiration from other things, which is what I did growing up.""","Alexandra Eala became the first Filipino woman to defeat a top-10 ranked player since the ranking system's inception 50 years ago.

You didn't have anyone from where you're from to pave the way. Of course you had many people to look up to around the world, but I think -- I hope this takes Filipino tennis to the next step.""Keys acknowledged her performance was below par, following her recent defeat to Aryna Sabalenka at Indian Wells.""My serve was not really there today and I just kind of felt a little flat -- and when you are playing someone who makes a ton of balls back and absorbs really well, that's not really the keys to success.""Eleventh-seeded Andreeva faced physical challenges during her match against Miami resident Anisimova, requiring medical attention for an abdominal issue early in the first set.The match lasted 2 hours and 49 minutes, with Anisimova winning 7-6 (7/5), 2-6, 6-3.

British tennis star Jack Draper 's momentum from his Indian Wells victory was halted at the Miami Open on Saturday, suffering a defeat to Czech Republic's Jakub Mensik, ranked 54th in the world.Draper had achieved a career milestone by entering the top 10 rankings after defeating Holger Rune in the Indian Wells final last Sunday, following his victory over Carlos Alcaraz in the semifinals.The 19-year-old Mensik demonstrated exceptional skill, securing victory through two tie-breaks with scores of 7-6 (7/2), 7-6 (7/3).""It was tough, obviously I came up against someone today who was playing incredibly well. He served 10 out of 10, I couldn't get a read or a look on his serve at all.

In Indian Wells it was very different, so I hope I can continue playing this way and have a great week here.""The 27-year-old German completed his match against Fearnley in 74 minutes and utilized his early Indian Wells exit for additional practice.""Had two weeks time to practice and work on my game again and I did that - hopefully this is the first of many matches for me here.""In an unexpected turn, 13th-seeded American Ben Shelton was eliminated by Hong Kong wildcard Coleman Wong, ranked 128th globally.Wong secured a 7-6 (7/3), 2-6, 7-6 (7/5) victory, despite losing a 5-2 lead in the final set.""I always trust myself to play in these big stages… I had a tough time (during) the COVID times.

BENGALURU: Vedant Mohan -- India’s most promising sub-junior tennis player (under-14) – has kickstarted the next step of his junior career, transitioning to the International Tennis Federation’s junior Tour (under-18).The 14-year-old, who had been locked down at his training base in Javea, a coastal town in Spain since February, started by playing a couple of base-level ITFs in Sri Lanka these last weeks. He's scheduled for more J30s and J60s in May, most likely in Africa.Vedant, left-handed, also plays on the Spanish circuit and has gained immensely in the last few years competing in Tennis Europe events alongside some of the best under-14 talents in the world. Vedant’s highest ranking in the under-14 section of the Tennis Europe ratings was achieved on his 14th birthday this January, when he still had another 12 months left in the age-group.He was ranked No.13 and at the time, the only Asian in the top 25.While playing in Europe helped grow Vedant’s game, the 5-feet-8-inch Indian couldn’t play the full circuit. He didn’t qualify for the European Championships, the Summer or Winter Cups, all big-ticket competitions, and open only to Europeans as they are team events.That, along with the fact that he was cash-strapped, contributed to Vedant’s rather limited matchplay in comparison to his peers (2011-born) who were ranked higher than him.For instance, the TE No.1 (U-14) Mario Vukovic of France has played 176 singles matches and the No.2 Greece’s Rafael Pagonis played 192 while Vedant has played just 102.The 14-year-old will now play a mix of U-16 and U-18 tournaments in Spain, while targeting ITF under-18s. Vedant’s parents – father Dhruv and mother Anisha – moved to Spain five years ago when their son, then nine, received a tennis scholarship.Mohan, a commercial pilot, has for most part funded Vedant’s mushrooming career, while also leaning on Anisha’s and his family back home in India. He lives in Muscat, while Anisha and their two sons live in Javea, where Vedant trains under Javier Ferrer, brother of former top-5 pro David.Vedant, who idolises tennis legend Novak Djokovic because of his mentality, says his favourite surface is clay.“I love that I can rip the ball hard and heavy with topspin on clay. Also, I love to slide,” he told TOI. “My favourite shot is my inside-out forehand. I like to play aggressively, my game is all court. I like to volley and also play with variation.”Mohan, a collegiate-level tennis player in India, winning gold medals in singles and doubles, is hoping his son will be part of junior Grand Slam draws in the next 18-to-24 months.“The ultimate goal is the pros, the ATP Tour,” he said, adding, “At this stage we’re only looking to develop his game.”","Vedant Mohan is India’s most promising sub-junior tennis player (under-14) The 14-year-old will now play a mix of U-16 and U-18 tournaments in Spain.

Miami: Carlos Alcaraz , ranked world number three, experienced an unexpected early elimination from the Miami Open on Friday. Belgian veteran David Goffin secured a remarkable comeback victory with a score of 5-7, 6-4, 6-3 at Hard Rock Stadium .Goffin, aged 34 and currently ranked 55th, had previously defeated Alcaraz in Astana three years ago. Noticing Alcaraz's subpar performance in the opening set, Goffin adopted an aggressive approach.Goffin, who once achieved a career-high ranking of No.7 in 2017, delivered impressive winning shots while Alcaraz struggled with unforced errors. The Belgian player managed to secure a break advantage in all three sets, and despite losing his lead in the first set, he maintained composure to secure the victory.""When I came out earlier... just to warm up on the court, I felt 'I'm moving well. I'm feeling quite relaxed. I'm hitting the ball really well' and so I hoped it would be the same during the match.""""I started the match well. I had the break in the first and he started to play really well at the end of the first.""""It's that kind of night that I will remember for sure -- against Carlos and in a stadium like that. And the night that gave me a lot of confidence to continue.""Daniil Medvedev also faced an early exit following a 6-2, 6-3 loss to Spain's Jaume Munar, ranked 56th. Meanwhile, Novak Djokovic secured a straight-sets victory over Australian Rinky Hijikata.Medvedev, who won the Miami title in 2023, displayed frustration by throwing his racket multiple times. Munar, the 27-year-old from Mallorca, achieved his third career victory over a top 10 opponent.The Russian player committed 32 unforced errors and failed to convert two break points in the final game despite having an opportunity to mount a comeback.""Yeah, I was not 100% physically, but I tried my best to get into the match. Every day was better and better. I had some problems after Indian Wells. Can happen.""""He played well, so that's why (he won) I wouldn't go to the match if I would kind of definitely know I'm not ready to win.""Djokovic, who previously lost to a lucky loser at Indian Wells, defeated 86th-ranked Hijikata 6-0, 7-6 (7/1), ending his three-match losing streak. He has now matched Rafael Nadal's record of 410 match wins in Masters 1000 tournaments since their inception in 1990.Karen Khachanov halted Nick Kyrgios's comeback with a 7-6 (7/3), 6-0 victory. Kyrgios, returning from wrist surgery, had secured his first tour-level win since October 2022 against Mackenzie McDonald but couldn't overcome Khachanov, a semi-finalist in Miami last year.In the women's competition, world number two Iga Swiatek advanced to the third round by defeating France's Caroline Garcia 6-2, 7-5. The match proved more challenging than their recent encounter at Indian Wells.Swiatek faced a 3-1 deficit in the second set and saved a set point while serving at 5-4 down before winning the final three games.""My energy level got down really fast. So I tried to wake myself up, keep the intensity from the first set, follow through and go for it,"" Swiatek said.Emma Raducanu demonstrated determination in her victory over eighth-seeded American Emma Navarro.

CHENNAI: Sankar Muthusamy recorded the biggest win of his nascent career yet, defeating World No. 2 Anders Antonsen of Denmark 18-21, 21-12, 21-5 in the Swiss Open men’s singles pre-quarterfinals in Basel late on Thursday.What surprised many was the way in which the Indian dominated the deciding game. Despite losing the opener, the 21-year-old did not give up and pushed the match to the decider. He was helped by a flurry of unforced errors that Antonsen committed — the Dane hitting the shuttle wide and long on multiple occasions. Sankar made the most of the opportunity and succeeded.The Chennai lad entered the tournament as a qualifier and registered two wins to enter the main draw.“It feels good, and I have been doing well in this tournament. The first game (against Antonsen) lasted for close to 30 minutes and I feel that he became tired after that. I was able to score points from long rallies and capitalised on the situation. I was focusing on one point at a time and did not think much about the result,” Sankar, ranked 64th, told TOI from Basel.“In the deciding game, I was just expecting him to come back at me and was ready to handle the situation. My aim was to move him around the court and make him tired.”Sankar, who was a former junior World No. 1, lacked consistency in the 2024 season due to various reasons. However, he started the 2025 season on a bright note, reaching the quarterfinals of the Thailand Masters. He was later down with fever and could not give his best in the next few tournaments. However, Sankar recovered well ahead of the Swiss Open.The youngster, who is known for his defensive play, has improved his attacking skills and stroke-making.“My strokes have become sharper than usual, and I am able to finish off points from the rear court. My power is gradually increasing, and I am working on it. There is still a long way to go,” he said.Sankar’s long-time coach Aravindan Samiappan said that the win has come at the right time for his ward.“The moment has not sunk in properly. Sankar was an underdog and had nothing to lose. Our plan was to stay neck-to-neck on points and towards the end anything could have happened. But none would have expected such a scoreline in the decider. It was a bit shocking but that happens sometimes,” Aravindan said.The coach feels that opponents can no longer come prepared for Sankar, as he lends unpredictability into his game now.“Sankar can vary the pace of the match whenever required, and this was not the case one and a half years ago. Players could anticipate what he was going to do, as he played at a single pace. Now, you cannot predict him, and that is the major difference in his gameplay,” pointed out the coach.","Sankar Muthusamy defeated World No. 2 Anders Antonsen of Denmark 18-21, 21-12,. 21-5 in the Swiss Open men’s singles pre-quarterfinals in Basel late on Thursday.

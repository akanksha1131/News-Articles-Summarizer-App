Poll Should Virat Kohli consider returning to Test cricket? Yes, he should No, he should focus on ODI/T20 Depends on his fitness

Many prominent current and former cricketers assembled under one roof for the gala dinner hosted by Yuvraj Singh to raise funds for his YouWeCan Foundation. The entire Indian cricket team, including the support staff led by Gautam Gambhir , was in attendance and the star-studded gathering included the likes of Sachin Tendulkar, Chris Gayle, Kevin Pietersen, Brian Lara and Ashish Nehra.Team India stayed for a little over an hour and participated in some fun activities before leaving the plush hotel in the heart of the city. Just when everyone was well settled for the dinner, and waiting for the other activities to begin, the giant screen flashed a familiar face as former India Test captain Virat Kohli was seen chatting with his friend Kevin Pietersen while having a bite.Next up was a candid chat hosted by Gaurav Kapoor and it featured former India head coach Ravi Shastri , cricketers Yuvraj Singh, Kevin Pietersen, Chris Gayle and Darren Gough. The initial segment didn't feature Kohli on the stage but after insistence from Gaurav, he made his way up and joined the rest of the pack. A trademark meet-and-greet with Chris Gayle later, he gave a rare reaction on Test retirement when Gaurav said that everyone misses him on the field.""I just coloured my beard two days ago. You know it's time when you are colouring your beard every four days,"" says Kohli.He had his former coach Shastri by his side and the two lavished praise on each other for the support during their time together with the Indian cricket team.Kohli spoke at length about his bond with the former India cricketer and how it helped him become the Test cricketer he did, and achieve what he did for the country.""Honestly, if I wasn't working with him... what happened in Test cricket wouldn't have been possible. The clarity which we had together is very hard to find. It's everything for cricketers to grow in their careers. Even he hadn't backed me the way he did... those press conferences where he took the bullets from the front line. Things would have been different and I always have respect and regard for him, for being a massive part of my cricketing journey,"" says Kohli.As a youngster in the dressing room, Kohli spent a lot of time with Yuvraj and the two shared a very good bond - both on and off the field. The 36-year-old, who is in London for a lot of time these days, still remembers the first meeting between the two, his journey during the 2011 World Cup, the battle with cancer and that return to India colours.""We shared a very good bond both on and off the field. I met him for the first time during a North Zone tournament in Bangalore. When I started playing for India, him, bhajju pa and Zaheer Khan took me under their wings. Really helped me grow as a player, made me comfortable in the dressing room. Lot of fun times off the field and made me aware of the lifestyle of getting to the top. These are the bonds I would cherish for the rest of my life. Watching him in the World Cup was very special and what we got to know after that was a shock. Being so close to him... we had no idea. Then his battle with cancer and again the champion that he is. .. coming on top and making a comeback to the team when I was leading the team.Quiz: Who's that IPL player? ""I clearly remember we played a game against England in Cuttack. There was a 2017 series we played at home and top-order got out early and Yuvi pa got 150 I think and MS scored 110 or something. I still remember telling KL or someone that this is like childhood days watching on big tv... I have a lot of love and respect for him. It's a pleasure being here and I won't do it for any other person but him,"" says Kohli.The conversations continued, the drinks continued to be poured into glasses of different shapes and sizes and the money continued to be raised for the noble cause. Amid all the noise, Kohli quietly left the stage, met his friend Gaurav and made his way to the hotel lobby with very minimal security. The area was briefly cordoned off but the moment he was out of the building, normalcy resumed.","Virat Kohli attended a gala dinner hosted by Yuvraj Singh to raise funds for his YouWeCan Foundation.

“Let the legends keep the big scores.”

Poll Should Wiaan Mulder have gone for the 400 runs? Yes, he should have gone for it No, he made the right decision

Wiaan Mulder’s stunning 367* in the second Test against Zimbabwe was the stuff of dreams. But what happened next left the cricket world divided. Just 33 runs away from equalling Brian Lara ’s iconic 400*, Mulder chose to declare South Africa’s innings on 626 for 5, sparking fierce debate across the cricketing fraternity.One of the loudest voices of disapproval came from West Indies legend Chris Gayle . Speaking to talkSPORT, Gayle didn’t hold back. “If I had the chance to get 400, I would go for it,” he said. “That kind of opportunity doesn’t come often in Test cricket. He panicked. He blundered. He blew it big time.”Mulder, captaining South Africa for the first time, said he didn’t want to break a record held by a “legend” and revealed that head coach Shukri Conrad told him,But Gayle wasn’t convinced. “You don’t become a legend by stepping away from records. You become one by chasing them,” he added.Despite the missed milestone, Mulder made history in his own right. His 367* became the highest individual score by a South African in Tests and the highest ever made by a batter outside their home country.Still, Gayle’s words echoed the feelings of many fans. “It doesn’t matter if it’s Zimbabwe or Australia. A Test triple or quadruple century is a Test century. You take it. That’s cricket,” he said.South Africa went on to win by an innings and 236 runs, but the bigger story might just be the one that got away.","Wiaan Mulder's 367* in the second Test against Zimbabwe was the stuff of dreams.

How Jasprit Bumrah is preparing for Lord's Test - batting, bowling and lot of jokes!

Poll Should Kuldeep Yadav be included in India's Playing XI for the next Test? Yes, he adds valuable variation No, the current bowlers are sufficient

TimesofIndia.com in London: There has been a lot of chatter around Kuldeep Yadav 's absence from India's Playing XI ever since the side landed in England but it seems to have died down a bit after the historic win at the Edgbaston Cricket Ground. The move of depth over a proper wicket-taking bowler worked for Shubman Gill & Co. as Washington Sundar scored valuable runs lower down the order and did what the management expected out of him.Two days before the Lord's Test, Kuldeep resumed his preparations with two rounds of gentle jogs and was back doing what he enjoys the most - give the ball a rip. On the bench for the first two games, there has been no drop in the intensity with which he prepared for a fixture and Tuesday was no different. The series is locked at 1-1 before the two sides go head-to-head at the Home of Cricket and former England cricketer and current Delhi Capitals mentor Kevin Pietersen feels India need to play the chinaman.""They need to play him. India lost a Test match, won a Test match and I think they are missing some sort of variation. I think they are missing variation,"" Pietersen tells TimesofIndia.com on the sidelines of ""YOUWECAN CHARITY GALA"" in London.Pietersen reveals he had a lot of discussions with the left-armer regarding bowling in England during his time with Delhi Capitals but didn't divulge details.""I sat with him a couple of times when I was mentor with the Delhi Capitals, and I discussed bowling in England with him.I discussed tactics. I had a lot of chat on how to bowl and where to bowl. We spent a lot of time and it will just be nice to see him play. It would be lovely to see him play. He loves bowling, he loves taking wickets. And I want to see my buddy play.

Poll Which cricketer's alternate career do you relate to the most? Nasser Hussain - Teacher Mark Butcher - Musician Dinesh Karthik - Engineer Mel Jones - Travel Writer

What would some of cricket’s most recognisable voices be doing if they hadn’t picked up a bat or ball? The Sky Sports Cricket commentary team opened up recently about their alternate career paths, and the answers offer a fun and human look beyond the boundary. Nasser Hussain was the first to reflect. With his trademark honesty, he said, “I struggled to be a cricketer by the way, so what would I have been? I would like to be a teacher of some kind. I don’t know what subject I’d teach but maybe a PE teacher.” Mark Butcher , admitted his passion has always extended beyond cricket. “I probably would have ended up playing for a band or being a musician,” he said. “I still moonlight in it now, but that would have been the other option. Basically anything that didn’t involve doing real work.” Dinesh Karthik , India’s former wicketkeeper and now one of the most engaging analysts on air, had a more conventional backup in mind. “I’d have been a run-of-the-hill engineer,” he said with a laugh. “Probably working in an IT company.”Mel Jones, who brings an adventurous spirit to the commentary box, revealed a dream filled with passports and planes. “I’d love to be one of those travel people.Just travel the world and write about amazing places and amazing adventures,” she said.Quiz: Who's that IPL player? Each response brought out a lighter side to the familiar voices we hear during intense Test match days. The team now turns its focus back to serious business, with the third Test between India and England set to begin on Thursday, July 10 at Lord’s.With the series level at 1-1, both teams will be eyeing an edge in what promises to be a pivotal contest.

Poll Will Shubman Gill surpass Virat Kohli's records in the future? Yes, definitely No, Kohli's records are too high It’s too early to tell

In a sport that thrives on legacy and inspiration, Shubman Gill is quietly scripting a journey that mirrors the great Virat Kohli in more ways than one. The similarities between the two batters are not just striking, they are uncanny. From Under-19 World Cup heroics to commanding Test captaincy debuts, Gill seems to be walking a path once tread by Kohli himself.Both Gill and Kohli scored centuries in all three international formats, a feat few have achieved. Their first big moments came in the U19 World Cup where both notched up centuries and hinted at the greatness that lay ahead.At 23, both brought up their maiden Test hundreds, and both rose to become the No.1 ranked ODI batter in the ICC rankings. Their batting consistency in the 50-over format also saw them reach 1000 ODI runs while averaging above 50.Each won their first Man of the Match award against the West Indies, scored their first ODI fifties in their fourth game, and remarkably, lost their T20I captaincy debuts but bounced back to win the series.In the IPL , they are the only Indians to score over 800 runs in a season and also the only ones with multiple centuries in a single edition. Both won the Orange Cap and MVP award in the same year and even scored IPL hundreds at their home venues with nearly identical stats — 101 runs with 13 boundaries and just one six, all in 2023.In Tests, their brilliance continued. Both scored 250-plus as captain, both struck a century on Test captaincy debut, and both registered their first ICC hundred against Bangladesh while staying unbeaten.They also shared more quirky similarities — a 200-plus partnership with Rohit Sharma , maiden T20I tons as openers with strike rates over 200, identical innings tallies (139) to reach their 17th international century, and scoring patterns in ICC knockout stages. Both began their international journeys wielding MRF bats against Australia.In one of the more recent parallels, Gill matched Kohli by leading India to a Test win in England after declaring in the third innings — a rare strategic move. Like Kohli, he also won his first Test Man of the Match award as captain against England.These striking coincidences and stats were first compiled by @Shebas_10dulkar.Shubman Gill may have been inspired by Kohli, but he’s now carving out a legacy that might one day inspire the next generation of Indian cricketers in the same way.","Shubman Gill is quietly scripting a journey that mirrors the great Virat Kohli.

Poll Do you think South Africa will continue their winning streak in upcoming matches? Absolutely, they're on fire! Unlikely, they might face tougher opponents

South Africa, led by debutant captain Wiaan Mulder, secured a comprehensive victory over Zimbabwe in the second test match at Bulawayo, winning by an innings and 236 runs to complete a two-test series sweep. Mulder's outstanding performance included an unbeaten 367 runs, three wickets, and three catches, leading South Africa to their tenth consecutive test victory.Mulder's remarkable innings of 367 not out stands as the fifth-highest individual test score in history, falling just 33 runs short of Brian Lara 's world record. His contribution helped South Africa declare at 626-5.Zimbabwe struggled throughout the match, managing only 170 runs in their first innings and 220 in the second after being forced to follow on. Their combined total of 390 runs was merely 23 more than Mulder's individual score.""It was super special (to be captain). It's something I had dreamt of as a kid,"" Mulder told broadcaster SuperSport. ""To captain your country is one of the biggest honors you can get as a cricketer. So it was a super proud moment for me and my family and I am glad I could make the guys proud.""The third day began with Zimbabwe at 51-1, losing Sean Williams early when Mulder bowled him for 11.Nick Welch reached his third half-century but fell shortly after lunch for 55, caught by Mulder off Senuran Muthusamy's bowling.Zimbabwe's captain Craig Ervine showed resistance with a 95-ball innings of 49, but the team suffered a collapse losing seven wickets for 67 runs in 28 overs.The bowling honors were shared between Corbin Bosch (4-38), Codi Yusuf (2-38), and Muthusamy (3-77).Mulder took charge of the team in the absence of injured regulars Temba Bavuma and Keshav Maharaj , proving himself as a capable leader.The defeat extended Zimbabwe's winless streak in Bulawayo to 22 tests since 2001, with 17 of those being losses.This series marked South Africa's first test tour to Zimbabwe in 11 years, though the matches weren't counted in the World Test Championship as Zimbabwe isn't part of the WTC.The South African team will remain in Zimbabwe for an upcoming Twenty20 tri-series featuring New Zealand.","South Africa beat Zimbabwe by an innings and 236 runs to complete a two-test series sweep.

Former England captain Alastair Cook was one of the many who criticised Wiaan Mulder's promotion to No. 3 in the World Test Championship (WTC) final against South Africa. Mulder had scored 6 and 27 in the WTC final.The 27-year-old is currently leading South Africa in the absence of Temba Bavuma against Zimbabwe.Mulder is in the news for declaring South Africa's innings when he himself was batting on 367 in Bulawayo. His declaration came at lunch on the second day, when South Africa were 626/5. He was only 33 runs away from breaking Brian Lara's 400, the highest individual score in Test cricket.""I would have gone to 385, become the second highest, and then declared. Just one thing—I think when I was on that last Test match in the World Test Championship, I said he is not a number three (laughs). He is about to break the record. Fair play to him to say no,"" Cook said on the Stick To Cricket podcast.Former England captain Michael Vaughan too had echoed Cook's sentiment and said: ""I'd reckon I would have got to 395.""South Africa won the Test by an innings and 236 runs to win the series 2-0.""I think respecting the game is really important; letting someone like Lara keep his record,"" Mulder had said.""He's one of the greatest to ever have played the game, so he deserves that. And yeah, I think we're still in a great position to win the game, and that's all that matters.""Mulder was sad that he had knocked Amla and his 311 not out against England at The Oval in July 2012.""I've worked with Hash [now the Lions' batting coach] over the last couple of years, and he's obviously a hall-of-famer,"" he said.""So it's truly special to go past his record.

Sri Lanka secured a decisive 99-run victory against Bangladesh in the final ODI at Pallekele, winning the three-match series 2-1.Bangladesh, chasing 286, were dismissed for 186 in under 40 overs as Sri Lanka's bowling attack dominated the match.Sri Lanka's performance marks a significant improvement in ODI cricket following their disappointing ninth-place finish at the 2023 World Cup in India, which cost them qualification for this year's Champions Trophy.The team has since won seven out of nine ODI series, including victories over Australia and India.""This is probably one of our best games. We were under pressure and we wanted to win badly and Kusal Mendis was superb today. When we ended up scoring 285, we knew we had the runs on the board and the bowlers' job became easy,"" said Sri Lanka captain Charith Asalanka.Kusal Mendis played a crucial role in the series-deciding victory, scoring 124 runs from 114 balls for his sixth ODI century.Mendis, who faced criticism for his dismissal in the second ODI loss in Colombo, responded with a composed innings featuring 18 boundaries.He joined the action in the fourth over and formed a crucial 124-run partnership with captain Asalanka for the fourth wicket.""Very pleased with the knock today. Was disappointed with what happened in Colombo. I had got a start and couldn't finish. Here I was determined to bat through the innings and very satisfied,"" said Mendis, who won both man of the match and player of the series awards.Sri Lanka's initial momentum suggested a 300-plus total, but Bangladesh's effective death bowling limited them to 285 for seven.Bangladesh's chase struggled early as their top order collapsed quickly. Dushmantha Chameera, playing his first series in over a year due to injury, made an impact with his fast bowling.He dismissed Najmul Hossain Shanto for zero with a delivery that moved sharply to hit the off stump. Chameera later removed Towhid Hridoy, who had scored a half-century, with another inswinging delivery.He finished with three wickets for 51 runs, while Asitha Fernando also claimed three wickets. The teams will next compete in a three-match T20I series starting Thursday at Pallekele.""We started off well and we tried to bat positive, but the scoreboard pressure got to us. But we are rebuilding the team and (there are) a lot of young players... we have a lot of positives,"" said Bangladesh captain Mehidy Hasan Miraz.",Sri Lanka beat Bangladesh by 99 runs in the final ODI at Pallekele.

Shubman Gill, Gautam Gambhir shut critics with thumping win over England

Poll Do you think India's performance in the last two Tests increases their chances of winning at Lord's? Yes, definitely No, not really

TimesofIndia.com in London: India's nets after travel day didn't have 100% attendance as captain Shubman Gill Rishabh Pant , Washington Sundar, Mohammed Siraj , Akash Deep, KL Rahul and Yashasvi Jaiswal didn't attend the optional session at the Lord's Cricket Ground today (July 8). The team left from Birmingham via bus yesterday and most of the players took it easy after the travel day.Of the players expected to play the third Test from July 10, only Karun Nair, Jasprit Bumrah , Nitish Kumar Reddy and Ravindra Jadeja trained under the watchful eyes of head coach Gautam Gambhir and the remaining coaching staff. Shardul Thakur, Kuldeep Yadav and Arshdeep Singh continued with their preparations, and Prasidh Krishna, expected to make way for Bumrah, worked on his batting before undergoing a drill with bowling coach Morne Morkel.It was a light session as the players took it easy and was more about getting a feel of the venue and the setting before the next fixture. All eyes were again on Bumrah who went through his pre-bowling routine - a light job, some stretching, spot deliveries - before hitting full tilt. Like Birmingham, where he didn't play but trained, he spent a lot of time bowling to his teammates in the nets and then padded up for an extended hit.In between, there was a lot of banter with the ground staff where he compared pitches in previous two Tests to Kanpur and Nagpur, and remained very chatty with Arshdeep Singh. The rhythm looked good when he bowled long spells to the likes of Karun Nair and Sai Sudharsan, and worked on his batting too.For the rest, it was business as usual. Nitish bowled for a long duration, Kuldeep kept giving it a rip and Jadeja worked on his batting for an extended period before his usual long conversations with coach Gambhir. The team come into the third Test in good space - having won in Edgbaston and coming close at Headingley.The batters have been on song, bowlers gave a good account of their skills in Birmingham, where they registered India's first win in the format, and with Bumrah returning for Lord's, they will have another spring in their stride. Akash and Siraj were excellent with the new ball and presence of Bumrah will only add more control and bite to the attack.The turnaround time between the two Tests was less but India batting coach Sitanshu Kotak hinted that Siraj, who has played both games, should be good to go. Both Siraj and Bumrah have played a Test before at the Home of Cricket during the 2021 series and will have enough tips to pass on to the first-timers.","Only Karun Nair, Jasprit Bumrah, Nitish Kumar Reddy and Ravindra Jadeja trained under the watchful eyes of head coach Gautam Gambhir and the remaining coaching staff.

WATCH:

Real Madrid held off a late Borussia Dortmund surge to clinch a 3-2 win and book their place in the semi-finals of the FIFA Club World Cup, where they will face European champions Paris Saint-Germain. The match, played under sweltering heat at the MetLife Stadium near New York City, saw Gonzalo Garcia and Kylian Mbappe steal the show for the Spanish giants.Gonzalo Garcia, 21, opened the scoring in the 10th minute, slotting home his fourth goal of the tournament after an inch-perfect cross from Arda Guler. Ten minutes later, full-back Fran Garcia doubled the lead, finishing off a flowing move that included a cutback from Trent Alexander-Arnold. Real Madrid dominated the opening stages, stifling Dortmund’s rhythm and forcing them to chase shadows.Coach Xabi Alonso praised his team’s display but acknowledged the chaotic finish: “Everything was going under control… but the last 10 minutes were kind of crazy. Overall, a good 80 minutes and the last 10 minutes to improve.”Indeed, Dortmund mounted a dramatic late comeback.Maximilian Beier fired in from a loose clearance in the 93rd minute to make it 2-1. But Real’s response was emphatic — Mbappe, who came off the bench in the second half, produced a sensational overhead kick to restore the two-goal cushion.Mbappe, still yet to start in the tournament due to recent illness, now has his first goal of the Club World Cup and 44th of the season. ""It will be a great challenge for us to face PSG, but let's take positives from today and move on for the next one,"" said Alonso ahead of the semi-final showdown.There was still more drama to come, as Dean Huijsen was sent off for bringing down Serhou Guirassy, who converted the resulting penalty to bring Dortmund back within a goal.Despite the scare, Real held on, much to the delight of the 76,611 fans in attendance — a repeat of the 2024 Champions League final, but with far more twists.Dortmund coach Niko Kovac reflected, “It is a deserved win for Real Madrid. We showed our qualities and it is not a failure if you go home after a defeat against them.”","Real Madrid beat Borussia Dortmund 3-2 to reach the FIFA Club World Cup semi- finals.

Work and commitment

A late own-goal by goalkeeper Weverton took Chelsea through to the Club World Cup semi-finals on Friday as the Premier League side edged Palmeiras of Brazil 2-1 in a last-eight tie that had been lit up by a moment of magic from young star Estevao Willian.The teenage Brazil forward, who will join Chelsea after the tournament, was eager to impress his future employers and his brilliant 53rd-minute finish cancelled out Cole Palmer's opener in Philadelphia.But a deflected Malo Gusto cross went in off Palmeiras 'keeper Weverton in the 83rd minute to take Chelsea through to a semi-final showdown with another Brazilian side in Fluminense.""In the first half we were in control of the game and could have scored more than one goal,"" said Chelsea coach Enzo Maresca, dismissing suggestions his team had been fortunate.""They started the second half better than us and the dynamic of the game changed, but then in the last 25 minutes we were in control again and I think we deserved to win without being lucky.""The scoreline was a repeat of Chelsea's victory when the teams met in the final of the Club World Cup under the tournament's old guise in 2022.""Overall Chelsea was better. They have better players and a better coach,"" admitted Palmeiras coach Abel Ferreira.""They were lucky with the way they scored the second goal but it can happen in football and we need to accept it and move on.""Chelsea will now be fancied to go on and reach the final, with Fluminense standing in their way in the last four at the MetLife Stadium in New Jersey on Tuesday.If not everyone has yet been won over by the tournament, the intensity levels on the pitch are rising as it reaches the business end and there was a big-game atmosphere in Philadelphia.Lincoln Financial Field was almost sold out, with 65,782 fans in attendance despite much of the city having emptied out for the July 4 holiday and long weekend.This game played out to a backdrop of Independence Day fireworks lighting up the sky over the nearby Delaware River, but there were fireworks on the pitch too.Chelsea lit the spark first, going ahead in the 16th minute thanks to a moment of class from England international Palmer.After drifting into a pocket of space just outside the Palmeiras box, Palmer controlled a Trevoh Chalobah pass on the half-turn, carried on into the area and dispatched a low shot past Weverton.It was the ideal start for Chelsea, who lost to Flamengo when they last faced Brazilian opposition in the same stadium during the group stage.Maresca added extra Brazilian flavour to the occasion by handing a first start to young midfielder Andrey Santos.With Moises Caicedo suspended, Santos occupied the holding midfield role for Chelsea while Pedro Neto lined up on the right wing, choosing to play despite having to come to terms with the tragic death of his Portugal teammate Diogo Jota on Thursday.Playing on the right wing for Palmeiras was Estevao, the 18-year-old Brazil prodigy set to join Chelsea in a big-money transfer agreed over a year ago.He knew this could be his last game for the Sao Paulo side, and Chelsea probably should have been two ahead before the interval only for Christopher Nkunku to blaze over after being teed up by Palmer.Instead Palmeiras equalised eight minutes into the second half, with Estevao the inevitable scorer.Positioned inside the Chelsea box to the right, Estevao controlled a pass by Richard Rios and took a touch to get in front of Levi Colwill, another to steady himself, and then surprised goalkeeper Robert Sanchez with an early shot that went in off the bar.Chelsea responded by sending on new signing Joao Pedro for his debut, the Brazilian becoming the 27th player used by Maresca during the tournament.The Blues pushed in search of a second goal but extra time was looking likely when the Premier League side grabbed a scrappy winner with seven minutes of the 90 to play.Following a corner played short, Enzo Fernandez found Malo Gusto and his attempted low centre from the left side of the box deflected off the toe of Agustin Giay to surprise Weverton, with the ball striking him on its way in.Substitute Hercules struck a 70th-minute winner as Brazil's Fluminense defeated Saudi Arabia's Al Hilal 2-1 on Friday to reach the semi-finals of the Club World Cup.A fine left-foot finish from Matheus Martinelli had put the Rio club ahead in the 40th minute but Al Hilal's Brazilian forward Marcos Leonardo levelled six minutes into the second half before Hercules stole the show to the delight of the vast majority of the 43,091 crowd.Al Hilal had pulled off the biggest upset of the tournament, beating Manchester City 4-3, to reach the last eight and Simone Inzaghi's side fought hard until the end to keep their adventure alive.They bow out of the tournament having been unbeaten through the group stage, including holding Real Madrid to a draw, and having truly made their mark on the world stage.There was a moment's silence before the kick-off in memory of Liverpool and Portugal forward Diogo Jota and his younger brother Andre Silva, who died in the early hours of Thursday after their car veered off a motorway in Spain and burst into flames.Al Hilal's line-up featured two of Jota's Portugal team-mates in Ruben Neves and Joao Cancelo.The first half was a tight and tactical affair with few chances until Martinelli opened the scoring when he picked the ball up from Gabriel Fuentes inside the box and span out to give himself space for a left-foot shot that rocketed past Yassine Bounou.Al Hilal went close to a quick response when Kalidou Koulibaly's header forced Fluminense's 44-year-old goalkeeper Fabio into a fine save.The Saudi side were awarded a penalty when Samuel Xavier was ruled to have brought down Marcos Leonardo in the box but Dutch referee Danny Makkelie was eventually sent to the monitor where he overturned his own decision after seeing there had been no contact between the two players.After going in at the break trailing by a goal, Al Hilal came out strongly for the second half and drew level when Koulibaly headed a Neves corner down to Marcos Leonardo who poked home.Al Hilal's Brazilian full back Renan Lodi had a let off when his poor backpass fell straight at the feet of German Cano but the Fluminense striker's attempt to round Bounou was denied by the smart work of the Moroccan keeper.But the outcome was settled with 20 minutes remaining when half-time sub Hercules saw a shot from distance blocked but from the loose ball Samuel headed the ball back to the forward who raced into the box and fired past Bounou to make it 2-1.Al Hilal produced a flurry of corners and some intense pressure in the final minutes as they desperately sought a way to keep their dream alive but the Brazilians were good value for their victory.""We didn’t have many chances but we made the most of them, the entire group worked and were committed,"" said Fluminense coach Renato Gaucho.""Our fans here in the USA and those in Brazil, they can be proud and I ask them to wear a jersey, in the mall, street, beach, wherever, wear that shirt – they should all be proud to wear that jersey,"" he said.The Fluminense coach was full of praise for the performance of his 40-year-old central defender Thiago Silva who ensured the Brazilians were able to withstand the second half pressure from Al Hilal.""Thiago Silva is huge for us, I worked with him 15 years ago, he is a coach on the pitch, very helpful and conveys calm and experience to the others. He is our captain and a leader and in hard matches like these against big clubs, its important to have people like him. He is key and fundamental,"" he said.Al Hilal coach Inzaghi said his side had been unfortunate to end on the losing side.""It has been a good World Cup for us but clearly we leave with a little bit of a bitter taste in our mouth because after what happened in that second half, we deserved much more,"" he said.""It was a tight match, decided by episodes, as happens in football. Fluminense are very well organised team that are having an excellent tournament,"" he added.",Chelsea beat Palmeiras 2-1 to reach the Club World Cup semi-finals in Philadelphia.

BENGALURU: Former India coach Igor Stimac who was sacked by the All India Football Federation (AIFF) last year and replaced with Manolo Marquez, who stepped down on Wednesday, said he was not surprised to hear that the Spanish gaffer had to leave the job after being in charge of the national team for just eight games.“The AIFF is run badly, without any clear idea on what to and how to do it,” Stimac told TOI. Stimac, who lost his job after India crashed out of the World Cup qualifiers had won a compensation of $ four lakh as compensation as the AIFF sacked him with one year left on his contract.Presenting his arguments on India's downward spiral from a world rank of 102 in 2023 to 127 in 2025, the former Croatian international said Indian players are not improving their skills through tournaments like the Indian Super League “Players are not progressing their game in such leagues like ISL which is without enough game intensity and pressure of results. Also, there's no relega- tion and lack of quality games,” Stimac said.He also said the national team does not get enough time to prepare. “FIFA windows are not long enough for preparation time when facing strong opponents. So the AIFF needs to reschedule the ISL calendar in favour of the national team.”Stimac also said the Indian footballers should come out of their comfort zone. “Unrealistic players’ salaries in ISL are putting players in a comfort zone.

Liverpool forward Diogo Jota and his brother Andre Silva lost their lives in a car accident in Spain on Thursday. The incident occurred in the municipality of Cernadilla in northwestern Zamora province.The Civil Guard reported that the vehicle went off the motorway and caught fire after midnight. The accident happened due to a tire blowout during an overtaking attempt.""Everything points to the blowout of a tyre while it (the vehicle) was overtaking,"" the Civil Guard said in a statement. ""The car was burned out, and they died inside,"" Angel Blanco, the central government's representative in Zamora, told reporters.Local media showed images of the burned remains of Jota's Lamborghini. Scorched debris and burn marks were visible on the motorway verge.Jota had recently married Rute Cardoso on June 22 and posted their wedding video on Instagram hours before the accident. The couple had three children.According to Portuguese and UK media, Jota was traveling to Santander to take a ferry to England, avoiding air travel due to medical advice following a recent lung operation.As per Portuguese journalist Rui Laura, Jota was planning on continuing his journey to Liverpool by road after arriving in England via ferry. Fellow journalist Victor Pinto added that Jota occasionally avoided flying because of recurring but non-serious pulmonary discomfort.Cristiano Ronaldo expressed his grief on X platform about Jota's death, which occurred shortly after his marriage and their UEFA Nations League victory with Portugal.""We will all miss you,"" Ronaldo wrote.""We have lost two champions.

Sebastien Buemi wins third spot on the podium in Jakarta



Sebastien Buemi’s performance in 2025 Formula E season

Coming as major good news for Envision Racing driver Sebastien Buemi, the removal of a time penalty from the last Jakarta race has landed him on the podium. Buemi is now officially promoted to third place, while Nico Mueller, who had originally celebrated a podium alongside Dan Ticktum and Edoardo Mortara at the Jakarta E-Prix, has been moved to fourth.The five-second penalty initially handed to Sebastien Buemi at the Jakarta E-Prix for contact with Mahindra Racing’s Edoardo Mortara was recently overturned following a FIA hearing. Due to the penalty, Buemi had finished eighth in Round 12 of the Jakarta race in June. However, the reversal has now reshaped the podium — much to Mueller’s disappointment.According to FormulaE.com, additional footage from Envision Racing's roll hoop camera, which was not available at the time the penalty was applied, was reviewed in detail. Buemi had received the penalty for an on-track collision with Mortara.The FIA stated: “The driver of Car 16 (Buemi) argued that the new element shows his overtaking manoeuvre was legitimate, that he was always in control of his car, and that when the slight contact occurred, he was fully alongside Car 48 (Mortara).”They further added: “The driver of Car 48 agreed with the assessment and mentioned he barely felt the contact.Upon careful consideration of the circumstances, the Stewards find that no single party bears whole or predominant responsibility for the collision. Therefore, the Stewards decide to reverse Decision 12. As a result, the penalty (i.e., five-second time penalty and one penalty point) on Car 16 is removed, and no further action will be taken in relation to this collision. ”With this update, Buemi moved to 10th in the Formula E Driver Standings with 63 points. In addition to his newly awarded Jakarta podium, he also has one win this season, in the Monaco E-Prix during Round 7.Also Read: Nico Mueller happy with Jakarta podium but adds, “It could have been even better with Jake” Buemi will now head to Berlin for Rounds 13 and 14 of the Formula E season.

It’s a track I know well, having driven there in the Rookie Test last year. I also had the chance to drive the GEN3 Evo in the FP0 session in Jeddah, with the 350kW power mode, new tires, and all-wheel drive, so I will be aiming to put these two experiences together. My main goal is to keep learning and to help the team complete its program for the day, like we did in Jeddah, while also showing my pace.”Also Read: Season 11 Berlin Rookie Test: Formula E teams announce nominations, eligibility rules explained The Berlin Rookie Test will give rookies a chance to drive the GEN3 Evo cars.

This season, he is all set to lift the Formula E World Championship trophy. Although he had a lackluster start in Sao Paulo, he bounced back with his first win of the year in Mexico. Soon after, he secured two podiums in Jeddah, including a win. He continued his strong form with double podiums in both the Monaco and Tokyo double-headers.After his last win in Tokyo, he brought his four-year-old daughter, Harper, to join him on the podium.

There was a lot of pressure to go through.I was looking forward to the race being over, to be honest, and when it was over... when I saw her face, I just couldn't help but be super emotional. ”""[The atmosphere] was amazing. I didn't realise how many people were here until I stood on the podium, so it was a really special moment for me and the team. Honestly, sometimes I feel like I need to wake up from the dream that I'm living at the moment,"" he added.In the last three races, Rowland has slowed down slightly.

“They haven't seen the bad side of life in a way. Nothing against them, they're the two greatest players at the moment by far, by far,"" said Grigor Dimitrov on Saturday when asked about Jannik Sinner, his next opponent, and defending champion Carlos Alcaraz.“But if you look at it also a little bit from psychological points of view and the environment that they're in and everything, with all due respect, they were playing the final [in Paris] and neither one of them had ever lost the final of a Slam. It's kind of funny when you hear it. I was laughing. Actually, I was like, ‘yep, I get that’. Then why wouldn’t you be fearless?“But then with age, we all know that fear comes very differently. It creeps in. It's not even about being fearless. It's about exploring your opportunities. And they just go for those opportunities. But I think with time, let's see how everything else would unfold.”At Wimbledon 's Centre Court on Monday evening, things unfolded in the manner that no one had imagined. Dimitrov was leaving Sinner clueless, out of ideas and depth.The 34-year-old served big and hit even bigger from both wings. During the first set, Sinner struggled to navigate the 34-year-old's serve to his backhand, paving way for numerous one-two punches.The Bulgarian led 6-3, 7-5 and it was 2-2 in the third set with two hours and eight minutes played. The clock, the play and the intense shot-making would end right there.Instead of what could have been his first top-5 win since March last year and first-ever against a World No. 1, he clutched his chest with the left hand. He took a few steps, crouched and sat down on the grass. ""My pec,"" Dimitrov told Sinner, referring to his pectoral muscle, as the Italian made his way across the net.Dimitrov then made his way to the sidelines, sat in his chair, was checked on by a trainer and a doctor. After a few minutes, the 21st ranked player walked towards the locker room with the medics. Soon, he re-emerged, almost in tears, and said he couldn’t continue.For the fifth Slam running, the 34-year-old Dimitrov failed to complete a match. He also did it at the Australian Open in January and the French Open in May, plus last year's Wimbledon and US Open.His words to the coaching team at Flushing Meadows feel poignant once again: ""You gotta be kidding me... of course!""Incidentally, it was Dimitrov's physical prowess during his 20s that was the most crucial factor to him even if the big titles never came. The chiseled body and positive outlook stood out even if the tennis went missing for the three-time major semifinalist including at 2014 Wimbledon.And here he was, betrayed by his own body. Again.Even before he stepped on court, fate's cruelty was lurking in the shadows. ""I feel great. After three matches to be where I'm at physically, really gives me a good, positive and upbeat way to get out there and play my game,” the he had said after the third round.“That's all I want, is to put myself in those type of positions, to get out there and play against these guys right now. This is in a way the most important thing for me,” he added.How much of a role did closing of the roof after two sets, because of fading sunlight, make in the whole thing remains up for debate. But what cannot be challenged is the quality of tennis that Dimitrov produced.Top-seed Sinner had not dropped a set enroute the fourth round. He had conceded only 17 games through it all. The head-to-head, too, was in Sinner's favour (4-1).All that went out for a toss very quickly. Sinner took a tumble early on, was broken in his very first game and looked as if he was rushed into shots rather than dictating points.“I don't take this as a win, at all,” said Sinner who revealed he had injury concerns of his own. “This is just a very unfortunate moment to witness for all of us.”Once again, it is Dimitrov's philosophical words before the match that provide the most cruelty to his realty of almost causing the biggest upset this year.“This particular match for me, with all due respect, I don't rate it as ‘wow’ match. It's just another day for me to perform. It's been a difficult six, seven months for me. I put a lot of work. I've struggled a lot.“That match has meaning for myself more so than anything else. But do I want to put any bigger occasion to it? No. I think I'm very content with what it is.“The rest is having fun. This is important. We're in the second week of Wimbledon. Let's have fun.”Unfortunately, that fun lasted for two hours and eight minutes before being stopped short by an episode we had seen before.","Grigor Dimitrov retires injured from Wimbledon match against Jannik Sinner. Bulgarian had led 6-3, 7-5 and it was 2-2 in the third set with two hours and eight minutes played.

American Robert Galloway, who retired from the mixed doubles having fractured his fourth finger (left hand), took the court for the Wimbledon men’s doubles third-round match with his finger strapped. Galloway and India’s Yuki Bhambri put up a fight before going down to the fourth seeds, Spain’s Marcel Granollers and Argentina’s Horacio Zeballos 4-6, 6-3, 6-7 (4-10), in two hours and 12 minutes on Monday.Bhambri and Galloway fought back from 2-5 in the decider but were outplayed by the fancied Spanish-Argentinian pairing in the match tie-break, where they jumped to a 7-0 lead. The Indo-American duo couldn’t do much in the opening set but broke in the sixth game of the second and took a 4-2 lead.The American was broken in the fourth of the third set when a Bhambri volley went deeper than the Indian hoped it would go, and the 16th seeds fell back 1-3 and then 2-5. Bhambri and Galloway won the next three games to climb back into the match.With Bhambri’s exit the Indian challenge at SW19 comes to an end. Going forward, the 33-year-old Indian will partner Kiwi Michael Venus. Bhambri admitted the plan was long term when he signed up with Galloway in mid-April.They started together in Munich in mid-April and have played 10 tournaments together. After bowing out in the first round in their first three tournaments, they stepped down a level briefly to play a Challenger event, and made the final of the ATP 250 Series event in Mallorca coming into Wimbledon.“Mike was available, he is one of my closest friends on Tour,” Bhambri said, “At some point eventually we were always going to play together and this was an opportunity that we finally had. It just made sense.”The 37-year-old has known Bhambri since his teenage days. “When he (Venus) started playing doubles, I was sort of the initial partner,” said Bhambri, “We obviously had our first Grand Slam together, which has still been our best result to date in Australia, making the third round.”","Yuki Bhambri and Robert Galloway lose to fourth seeds Marcel Granollers and Horacio Zeballos in Wimbledon men's doubles third round match.

It’s not about how you start that’s important, but how well you finish. Novak Djokovic played out the aphorism to perfection on Wimbledon ’s Centre Court.After losing the first set in 30 minutes, winning just 14 points, the 38-year-old, who was seen clutching his stomach during changeovers, turned the fourth-round clash against the 11th seeded Aussie Alex de Minaur around. And just how. The Serb came up with a staggering counter in the fourth set, winning five straight games to score a 1-6, 6-4, 6-4, 6-4 win in three hours and 18 minutes to make his 16th quarterfinals at Church Road.Monday got off to a wet, windy start at SW19, making for challenging conditions. The sun was moody, and a cold wind swept across the grounds, spectators pulled on their winter cardigans. Centre Court was packed and the roof was open. The ever-stylish eight-time champion Roger Federer was in the house.De Minaur was forced to withdraw before the Wimbledon quarterfinal last year with a hip injury, allowing Djokovic a walkover into the semifinals. This time, the 11th seed put his best foot forward, much to the delight of the crowd, but when Djokovic increased the pace on his forehand, putting the ball out of De Minaur’s strike range, the Aussie was rocked on to the backfoot. The 26-year-old looked like he was out of options.The first three games of the second set went with breaks. The second game, which De Minaur won, saw nine deuces and six break-points, but the Serb restored order to the play by holding at love in the fourth game to take a 3-1 lead. De Minaur, who was cheered on by his fiance Katie Boulter, slipped up in the ninth game of the third set and Djokovic went on to take a two sets-one lead.When De Minaur powered ahead to a 4-1 lead in the fourth set, making Djokovic run corner to corner, the buzz around the grounds was that the 24-time Major winner’s fourth-round clash was going the distance. The geeks were counting already. Since 2010 Djokovic has only lost a match once after leading by two-sets-to-love, that was to Denis Istomin in 2017 at Melbourne Park. Djokovic, however, had different plans, he clearly wasn’t looking at a fifth set. He broke in the seventh game and levelled at 4-4 before shutting the door on the contest.The world No. 6 was quick to dismiss stomach issues, saying he only needed a breather after 30plus shot rallies. “Sometimes I wish I had a serve and volley and nice touch (like) the gentleman that’s standing there. That would help,” Djokovic said in his on court interview, acknowledging Federer. “It’s probably the first time he has watched me and I’ve won the match. The last couple I lost, it’s good to break the curse.”In the other fourth round match, the 22nd seed Italian Flavio Cobolli beat the 2017 Wimbledon finalist Croatia’s Marin Cilic 6-4, 6-4, 6-7 (4), 7-6 (3) to make the quarterfinal at the grass court Slam for the first time. In the last -eight clash the 23-year-old Italian faces his idol Djokovic for the second time in his career, having lost their lone meeting in Shanghai.Swiss Belinda Bencic, one of nine mothers in the draw, made her first quarterfinal here with a 7-6 (4), 6-4 win over the 18th seed Ekaterina Alexandrova.","Novak Djokovic beat Australia's Alex de Minaur 1-6, 6-4, 6 -4, 7-6 (4) The Serb won five straight games in the fourth set to win in three hours and 18 minutes. He will now face Italy's Flavio Cobolli in the quarterfinals.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122313172,imgsize-92332,width-400,resizemode-4/122313172.jpg"

Jannik Sinner progressed to the Wimbledon quarter-finals on Monday after a tearful Grigor Dimitrov pulled out injured while in total control of the match while Novak Djokovic survived a scare.World number one Sinner and seven-time champion Djokovic remain on course for a mouthwatering semi-final clash but the top seed's match on Centre Court was overshadowed by Dimitrov's heartbreak.The Italian was staring at the exit door trailing 3-6, 5-7, 2-2 before the Bulgarian 19th seed pulled up holding his right pectoral muscle and was unable to continue.Sinner rushed to his aid but his 34-year-old opponent was barely able to wave to acknowledge the crowd's warm ovation.""Honestly I don't know what to say,"" said Sinner. ""He is an incredible player, I think we all saw this today.""He's been so unlucky in the past couple of years. An incredible player, a good friend of mine also. We understand each other very well off the court too.""Seeing him in this position, honestly, if there would be a chance that he could play the next round, he would deserve it.""The injury-prone Dimitrov has now been forced to retire in each of his past five Grand Slam appearances.Sinner himself suffered a nasty fall in the opening game of the fourth-round clash and appeared to be suffering discomfort in his right elbow.The three-time Grand Slam champion had been in regal form in the first three rounds at the All England Club, dropping just 17 games.Sinner, who is due to face American 10th seed Ben Shelton in the quarter-finals, said he would be having an MRI scan on Tuesday to assess the extent of the damage to his elbow.Shelton beat Italy's Lorenzo Sonego in four sets.Earlier, sixth seed Djokovic endured a nightmare start to his match against Australian 11th seed Alex de Minaur but battled back to win 1-6, 6-4, 6-4, 6-4.Fresh from his 100th win at Wimbledon on Saturday, making him the third player to achieve that feat after Martina Navratilova and Roger Federer , Djokovic reached his 16th quarter-final at the tournament.Aged 38, the Serb is aiming to win a record 25th major title, breaking a tie with the long-retired Margaret Court, and to equal Federer's record of eight men's crowns at the All England Club.That would make him the oldest Grand Slam singles champion in the Open era.Djokovic's 101st victory at Wimbledon came under the gaze of the Swiss great, who was sitting in the front row of the royal box alongside his wife Mirka.""It's probably the first time he's watching me and I've won the match,"" he said. ""The last couple I lost, so good to break the curse.""No, it's great, obviously, great to have Roger, a huge champion and someone that I admired and respected a lot.""We shared the stage for so many years, and it's great to have him back.""In the last eight, Djokovic faces Italian 22nd seed Flavio Cobolli, who beat former Wimbledon runner-up Marin Cilic 6-4, 6-4, 6-7 (4/7), 7-6 (7/3).In the women's draw, Iga Swiatek continued her serene progress with a 6-4, 6-1 rout of Danish 23rd seed Clara Tauson.Swiatek, fourth in the rankings, is a five-time Grand Slam winner but has never made a Wimbledon semi-final.The 24-year-old is in a strong position in the second week of the tournament after the exit of so many of the top seeds.""Honestly it's pretty amazing. It's the first time I really enjoyed London, sorry guys,"" Swiatek said, referring to her previous Wimbledon woes.""We are tennis players, so we feel well off the court when we feel well on the court.""The Polish player next faces Russian 19th seed Liudmila Samsonova, who beat Spain's Jessica Bouzas Maneiro 7-5, 7-5.Russian seventh seed Mirra Andreeva, 18, reached the Wimbledon quarter-finals for the first time with a 6-2, 6-3 win against American 10th seed Emma Navarro, who ended Barbora Krejcikova's reign as champion on Saturday.Andreeva next plays Swiss former Olympic champion Belinda Bencic, who beat Russian world number 17 Ekaterina Alexandrova 7-6 (7/4), 6-4.","World number one Jannik Sinner progresses to the Wimbledon quarter-finals after Grigor Dimitrov pulls out injured. Sinner will be having an MRI scan on Tuesday to assess the extent of the damage to his right elbow. Novak Djokovic survived a scare to beat Australian 11th seed Alex de Minaur 1-6, 6-4, 6,4,6-4.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122309657,imgsize-148262,width-400,resizemode-4/122309657.jpg"

Jay Shah’s 2036 Olympic blueprint for India: '8 Medals won’t cut it'

MELBOURNE: Relentless top seed Aryna Sabalenka muscled past American teenager Iva Jovic and into the Australian Open semi-finals Tuesday to accelerate her bid for a third Melbourne title.The Belarusian powered home 6-3, 6-0 in blazing heat to set up a clash with either third seed Coco Gauff or 12th seed Elina Svitolina.It booked the 27-year-old a 14th career Grand Slam semi-final and fourth in a row at the season-opening major.Sabalenka has won twice in Melbourne, in 2023 and 2024, and seemed destined for another crown last year but was upset in the final by Madison Keys.Keys' title defence is over, beaten in the fourth round by Jessica Pegula.""These teenagers have been testing me in the last couple of rounds,"" said Sabalenka, who is on a 10-match win streak after victory at the lead-up Brisbane International.""It was a tough match. Don't look at the score, it wasn't easy at all. She played incredible tennis. Pushed me to one step better level. And I'm super happy with the win.""The match was played under an open roof on Rod Laver Arena with the tournament Heat Stress Scale yet to reach the level where it could be closed.Temperatures are forecast to hit a blistering 45C with a peak of 38C reached during the match.Defeat brought an end to a breakthrough tournament for 18-year-old Jovic, the youngest player in the women's top 100 and seeded 29.She stunned seventh seed and two-time Slam finalist Jasmine Paolini and blitzed past experienced Yulia Putintseva for the loss of just one game to announce herself to the world.But Sabalenka was a bridge too far.The world number one safely held serve to lay down a marker, blasting an ace to set up game point and an unreturnable serve to win it.Jovic made some early errors and sent the ball long on break point to surrender her serve and fall 2-0 behind.Sabalenka held to pile on the pressure before Jovic fended off a break point on her next serve to get on the scoreboard.But despite some long rallies as she got into the match and three break points as Sabalenka served for the set, the top seed's brute force proved too much.Sabalenka then broke her immediately to assert control of set two and Jovic was spent, with another break for 3-0 then a double fault to slump 5-0 down, signalling the end.","Aryna Sabalenka beats Iva Jovic 6-3, 6-0 to reach Australian Open semi-finals. Belarusian will play either third seed Coco Gauff or 12th seed Elina Svitolina. Top seed has won twice in Melbourne, in 2023 and 2024, and seemed destined for another crown last year.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127590068,imgsize-51812,width-400,resizemode-4/aryna-sabalenka.jpg"
"IND vs NZ: Wrists working, runs flowing — how Suryakumar Yadav found form again",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/india-vs-new-zealand/ind-vs-nz-wrists-working-runs-flowing-how-suryakumar-yadav-found-form-again/articleshow/127544137.cms,"India's captain Suryakumar Yadav plays a shot during the third T20 cricket match between India and New Zealand in Guwahati, India, Sunday, January 25, 2026. (AP)

Suryakumar Yadav press conference: On India T20I Playing XI, personal form and more

Moments after India completed a 10-over chase of 154 in Guwahati, New Zealand batter Daryl Mitchell walked up to Suryakumar Yadav and examined his bat, smiling as he did so.Suryakumar had just struck 57 off 26 balls, following up his 37-ball 82 in Raipur in the previous match. It was his second fifty in as many games in the series.Two matches, two fifties, and suddenly the questions that had followed him for months were quieter. Perhaps Mitchell wanted to know what kind of willow could do that. Or perhaps it was simply recognition of a batter who, when timing and intent align, can make the field feel too small.For the Indian team management, however, the feeling was less about admiration and more about reassurance. With the T20 World Cup less than a month away, the return of form of the captain is a key development.Until January 23, the picture had been different. Suryakumar had gone 23 innings without a fifty, with his last half-century coming on October 12, 2024. In that period, he managed only one score in excess of 40 and one above 30.There was also a pattern that raised concern. During that stretch, he was dismissed by fast bowlers 15 times within the first 10 balls of his innings.The second T20I at Raipur proved to be a turning point, aided by an unexpected match situation. The early dismissals of Abhishek Sharma and Sanju Samson, both back in the pavilion within 1.1 overs, forced Suryakumar into a role that required patience rather than instant acceleration.With the openers gone early, there was no demand on him to match a fast start. He had the chance to steady the innings and assess conditions.He began cautiously, scoring 10 runs from his first 10 balls. That strike-rate of 100 was unusual for him, but it allowed him to read the pitch and bowlers.Once settled, Suryakumar shifted gears. He scored 72 runs off his next 27 deliveries, targeting the fast bowlers who had troubled him in recent months.Zak Foulkes conceded 41 runs from 12 balls. Matt Henry went for 14 off six, while Jacob Duffy was taken for 16 off 11. Foulkes, in particular, bore the brunt, with boundaries behind fine leg, over long-on, through point and deep third man, and straight down the ground.It marked the return of the 360-degree strokeplay that defines Suryakumar’s batting.Former India captain Sunil Gavaskar highlighted the importance of that innings during the broadcast.""The knock gave him exactly the confidence he needed. He hasn’t been short of form; he’s been short of runs. He has been batting very well in the nets. He’s not struggling there, he’s hitting the ball cleanly and all around the ground.""It just wasn’t working for him in matches. Sometimes, all it takes is a bit of luck to get going. This time, he didn't even need luck. That innings was exactly what he needed. His confidence is back,"" Gavaskar said.The impact of that confidence was visible in the third T20I at the Baraspara Stadium on Sunday.This time, Suryakumar walked in under different circumstances. India were 53 for two in 3.2 overs while chasing 154. With more than 100 runs required and plenty of overs left, there was time to build an innings.He again started cautiously, scoring eight runs from his first eight balls, while Abhishek Sharma continued scoring freely at the other end.Suryakumar did not try to match his younger partner’s pace, even as Abhishek scored at a strike-rate of 345. Instead, the 35-year-old chose his match-ups carefully, focusing on the spinners.Glenn Phillips went for 15 runs off five balls. Ish Sodhi conceded 14 from eight, while Mitchell Santner was taken for 18 off eight. Many of the runs came through the sweep and slog-sweep.The innings underlined that Suryakumar has settled into his role at No. 4, giving India a safety net if the openers fail.Former India opener Aakash Chopra shared a similar view during a chat show.""He seemed to have realised that he needs to spend some time (in the middle). You have to accept that you need runs. Therefore a lot of strokes (to be played) along the ground, and not taking too many chances.""More importantly, he never allowed his ego to come in when Ishan Kishan was going hammer and tongs at one end. These are important things as you are not thinking only about this bilateral series, as this is a preparation for the World Cup,"" Chopra said.","Suryakumar Yadav has scored two fifties in as many games in the series. The 35-year-old had gone 23 innings without a fifty, with his last half-century coming on October 12, 2024. He was dismissed by fast bowlers 15 times within the first 10 balls of his innings.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127544541,imgsize-41552,width-400,resizemode-4/mj-85.jpg"

Ravi Bishnoi press conference: on reading conditions, bowling plans & staying focussed

Rahul, Prasidh return

BENGALURU: Karnataka rang in sweeping changes to their Ranji Trophy squad on Monday, naming Test batter Devdutt Padikkal as captain in place Mayank Agarwal Padikkal, who was the standout performer in Karnataka’s white-ball campaign — particularly in the Vijay Hazare Trophy where the team reached the semifinals — will lead the side for the first time. The 25-year-old southpaw will begin his captaincy stint in a crunch away fixture against Punjab starting Thursday. The final league engagement is a must-win contest for Karnataka to stay in contention for the knockouts.It will be a baptism by fire for Padikkal, with the team coming off a heavy defeat to Madhya Pradesh at home on Sunday.Explaining the leadership change at a critical stage of the season, selection committee chairman Amit Verma said the decision was taken with Mayank’s batting in mind. “Given how intense Mayank is as a player, we felt the captaincy was, in some way, affecting his batting, especially since he also opens the innings. We want him to bat freely. We had a conversation with him and he was in sync with the decision,” Verma told TOI.Verma clarified that the move was not a stop-gap arrangement. “It is time we groom youngsters for leadership roles, and Padikkal is the perfect fit. Against Punjab, apart from Mayank, he will also have KL Rahul to help him ease into the new role.”On Mayank’s role in the team, Verma added, “He brings with him valuable experience, hence he will continue to mentor the youngsters in the side.”The Punjab match will also mark the return of senior batter KL Rahul and pacer Prasidh Krishna, both expected to provide much-needed stability to the batting and bowling units.Karnataka, however, have been forced into multiple changes owing to injuries. Karun Nair has been ruled out after suffering a split webbing on his left hand during the MP game, while medium-pacer Vyshak Vijaykumar misses out with a hamstring injury.There was some positive news with the return of in-form batter R Smaran, who had missed the previous match due to a shoulder niggle that also sidelined him from the Vijay Hazare Trophy semifinals. Smaran replaces Karun, while Vyshak has been replaced by M Venkatesh.Paras Gurbax Arya has made way for in-form spinner Mohsin Khan, who picked up a match haul of 12 wickets in Karnataka’s Col CK Nayudu Trophy U-23 fixture against Chandigarh that concluded on Monday.Big-hitter Abhinav Manohar, who scored 231 runs in five matches, has been dropped to accommodate youngster Dhruv Prabhakar, an all-round option who can also contribute with off-spin. With Rahul’s return, Nikin Jose has also been left out of the squad.Team: Mayank Agarwal, KL Rahul, Aneesh KV, Devdutt Padikkal (capt), R Smaran, Shreyas Gopal, Kruthik Krishna, Venkatesh M, Vidhyadhar Patil, Vidwath Kaverappa, Prasidh Krishna, Mohsin Khan, Shikhar Shetty, KL Shrijith and Dhruv Prabhakar.","Karnataka name Test batter Devdutt Padikkal as captain in place of Mayank Agarwal.

Beyond Numbers: Influence and Legacy

On January 26, 2016, Hardik Pandya ran in to bowl his first over for India in Adelaide against the mighty Australians in the first T20 international of the series. He went for 19 runs. By the end of the night, he had two wickets. It was a beginning that captured much of what would follow over the next decade — impact, volatility, scrutiny, and resilience.Ten years on, Pandya has become one of the most consequential white-ball allrounders India have produced. His career has unfolded across formats, franchises and phases — from explosive beginnings to physical breakdowns, from leadership rise to public backlash, and back again to relevance at the highest level.Brisk seam bowling and powerful ball-striking have defined Pandya’s game from the start. He has never been a volume accumulator. His value has rested on timing, leverage, and the ability to change games quickly.That was evident even before his India debut. In IPL 2015, playing for Mumbai Indians, Pandya announced himself with an unbeaten 61 off 31 balls against Kolkata Knight Riders. The innings marked the start of a long association with Mumbai, where he won four IPL titles and grew into one of the league’s most reliable and destructive finishers.Across T20 cricket, Pandya has scored more than 5,800 runs at a strike rate above 143, while also taking over 200 wickets. In international T20s alone, he has crossed 2,000 runs and taken 100 wickets.Pandya’s international career began on India’s limited-overs tour of Australia in 2016. Soon after, he impressed on seamer-friendly pitches in the Asia Cup in Bangladesh, strengthening the belief that India had finally found a genuine seam-bowling allrounder.That belief carried into the 2016 T20 World Cup. Pandya did not bat often, but his influence was felt. Against Bangladesh, he defended two runs off the last three balls to seal a one-run win. A week later came heartbreak — a no-ball to Lendl Simmons in the semi-final, which India lost, after which West Indies went on to win the tournament.The moments were extremes, but they accelerated his learning curve.Pandya quickly became central to India’s white-ball balance. In ODIs, he has scored over 1,900 runs at an average close to 33 while taking more than 90 wickets. His batting strike rate has stayed above 110, reflecting his role as a momentum shifter rather than an anchor.In Tests, he played only 11 matches; he doesn't play them at all now due to injury, but still left markers — including a century in Galle in 2017.The ascent was interrupted by a serious back injury in 2018, the impact of which has followed him through his career. At various points, Pandya has been restricted from bowling, forcing India to manage his workload carefully.In early 2019, he was also embroiled in controversy over remarks made on a television show, leading to action from the BCCI and a period away from the game. It was a reminder that his career, like his cricket, unfolded under constant attention.The 2020s marked a shift. Pandya grew into a senior role and was increasingly trusted for his clarity.That evolution was most visible in IPL 2022, when he was appointed captain of the newly formed Gujarat Titans despite having no prior leadership experience. He led an unfancied squad to the title in their debut season, scoring 487 runs — the highest for the franchise — and contributing with the ball.In 2023, Titans reached the final again. Across those two seasons, Pandya delivered both as an allrounder and a captain, reshaping how he was viewed within Indian cricket . By the end of the 2022 T20 World Cup, he was being spoken of as a future India captain.The most testing phase came in IPL 2024.Pandya was traded back to Mumbai Indians and named captain, replacing Rohit Sharma. The decision triggered strong reactions. At multiple venues, including Mumbai, he was booed by sections of the crowd. The team struggled, finishing last, and the atmosphere around the side remained tense through the season.Pandya did not publicly engage with the backlash. In 2025, Mumbai recovered to qualify for the playoffs, but the previous year left a visible imprint on his journey.In 2024 came a moment that reframed the conversation.In the T20 World Cup final, Pandya delivered under pressure with the ball, controlling critical phases as India went on to win the title. In a team built around specialists, his ability to influence both disciplines stood out.It was not a comeback story in the traditional sense, but it reaffirmed his place when stakes were highest.Pandya’s career statistics underline the kind of cricketer he has been. Across formats, he has scored more than 4,400 international runs and taken over 200 wickets. In IPL cricket, he has scored 2,749 runs at a strike rate close to 147 and taken 78 wickets.His best IPL season as an allrounder came in 2019, when he scored 402 runs at a strike rate above 190 and took 14 wickets in a title-winning campaign for Mumbai.The numbers do not tell a story of dominance, but of sustained relevance.Numbers matter — and Hardik has plenty of them — but his influence is also felt in the way India build their white‑ball plans. His ability to clear boundaries with ease changes how opponents bowl in the final overs. With the ball, his mix of cutters, pace and aggression unsettles even experienced batters.His role in India’s strategy has risk, reward and volume built into it. In the modern era, that kind of flexibility is prized — and Hardik delivers it.Hardik Pandya’s ten years in Indian cricket have been defined by movement — across roles, perceptions and expectations. He has been celebrated, questioned, booed and trusted again, often within short spans.From a costly first over in Adelaide to delivering in a World Cup final, Hardik Pandya's career arc has not been smooth, but it has endured.","Hardik Pandya has become one of the most consequential white-ball allrounders India have produced.

Bihar’s Ranji journey has been turbulent, with the side briefly breaking into the Elite Group in the 2022-23 season before slipping back to the Plate Group in 2024-25.Now back in the top tier, Bihar are pushing ahead with a rebuilding phase under skipper Sakibul Gani, bolstered by the promise of teenage batting prodigy Vaibhav Suryavanshi.On Monday, Bihar set Manipur a daunting target of 764 after Raghuvendra Pratap Singh fell agonisingly short of a century, dismissed for his overnight score of 90, prompting the declaration of the second innings at 505 for 6.After posting 522 in the first innings and dismissing Manipur for 264, Bihar wrapped up the match by bowling out their opponents for 195 in the second essay, with spinners Suraj Kumar Kashyap (3/32) and Himanshu Singh (3/49) picking up three wickets apiece on the fifth and final day.Skipper Gani (108) and Bipin Saurabh (143), who both struck fine centuries in the first innings, laid the foundation for the emphatic victory, before Piyush Singh followed it up with an unbeaten 216 off 322 balls in the second innings as Bihar piled on the runs against a hapless Manipur.Bihar declared after just nine balls on the final day, with Raghuvendra unable to add to the team’s overnight total of 505, prompting Gani to call an early declaration and give his side a full day to dismantle Manipur.The bowlers then left Manipur reeling at 50 for 5 inside 14 overs, a collapse that deepened to 70 for 7 by the 23rd, before a gritty 102-ball 74 from teenager Pheiroijam Jotin briefly held up Bihar’s charge.The 19-year-old Jotin later added 83 runs for the eighth wicket with L. Kishan Singha, who made 30 off 76 balls, as the pair momentarily threatened to deny Bihar an outright victory.However, once pacer Akash Raj removed Kishan Singha in the 44th over, the outcome became inevitable. Jotin fell a few overs later, bringing an end to the last resistance in Manipur’s batting.Earlier this month, Bihar had also earned promotion to the Elite League in the Vijay Hazare Trophy, defeating Manipur by six wickets in the final.Brief Scores:Bihar 522 and 505 for 6 decl (Piyush Singh 216, Raghuvendra Pratap Singh 90; Pheiroijam Jotin 3/85).Manipur 264 and 195 in 56.1 overs (Pheiroijam Jotin 74; Prashant Singh 2/51, S Kashyap 3/32, H Singh 3/49).",Bihar beat Manipur by 568 runs in the Plate final of the Ranji Trophy. Piyush Singh scored a superb double century in Bihar's second innings. Suraj Kashyap and Himanshu Singh took three wickets each for Bihar.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127552244,imgsize-36280,width-400,resizemode-4/sakibulgani-2601-pti.jpg"

Why Tilak Varma will miss T20Is vs New Zealand | Comeback date revealed | T20 World Cup

India opener Abhishek Sharma’s brief pre-batting routine has again drawn attention, after he produced a record-setting knock against New Zealand in the third T20I in Guwahati on Sunday.Just before walking out to bat, Sharma was seen knocking the ball with his bat and then flicking it between his hands, keeping his eyes fixed on it. The sequence, repeated before recent innings, went viral again on social media after his latest performance.Sharma then entered the record books by scoring the second-fastest T20I half-century by an Indian. He reached his fifty in 14 balls. Only Yuvraj Singh has scored a faster T20I fifty for India, reaching the mark in 12 balls against England during the 2007 T20 World Cup.With this innings, Sharma also went past India captain Suryakumar Yadav for the most T20I fifties by an Indian in 25 balls or fewer. Sharma now has nine such fifties, while Yadav has eight.Sharma also completed 1,200 T20I runs during the knock. He reached the milestone in 36 innings. He scored 68 off 20 balls, hitting seven fours and five sixes, striking at 340.His innings, along with Suryakumar Yadav’s 57 off 26 balls, helped India chase down 154 in 10 overs for an eight-wicket win.India also sealed the five-match T20I series, winning the first three games.Sharma’s output at the top of the order has stood out for both volume and scoring rate. Within a year and a half of his T20I debut, he has climbed to the top of the T20I batting rankings.As the runs continue to come, Sharma’s short routine before batting has become a point of discussion again, linking preparation with performance at the highest level.","India beat New Zealand by eight wickets in the third T20I in Guwahati.

Clock ticking for Sanju Samson: Can he fix his batting issues before T20 World Cup?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/india-vs-new-zealand/clock-ticking-for-sanju-samson-can-he-fix-his-batting-issues-before-t20-world-cup/articleshow/127545617.cms,"Sanju Samson (PTI Photo)

Rachin Ravindra press conference: on adapting in India & momentum swings

For more than a decade, Sanju Samson has remained one of Indian cricket’s most intriguing contradictions — a batter blessed with rare elegance and undeniable talent, yet one whose T20I career has been marked by baffling inconsistency. His recent poor run — scores of 10, 6 and 0 in the first three games against New Zealand — only underlines the concern.The contrast becomes sharper when viewed alongside nearest competitor Ishan Kishan , whose midas touch has impressed fans and experts alike.There is often confusion between statistics and data. While statistics offer a linear snapshot, data attempts to identify trends by digging deeper.Across 55 T20Is in 11 years, Samson has scored 1048 runs at a strike-rate of 147-plus (average slightly irrelevant in modern T20I metrics), with three fifties and three hundreds — two of which came in South Africa in late 2024.His strike-rate against Australia stands at 131, drops to 118 versus England, and further dips to 113 against New Zealand.Since opening from 2025, certain patterns have emerged. England found a method early last year, bowling fast and short into his body across five consecutive games, forcing hurried pull shots devoid of power or timing.In 2026, Matt Henry (twice) and Kyle Jamieson, both operating in the mid-130s, have largely bowled straight or on leg-middle lines, preventing him from freeing his arms on the off-side.To understand the issues affecting Samson’s batting, PTI spoke to former India opener WV Raman — regarded as one of the country’s most authoritative voices on batting technique — and Rajasthan Royals High Performance Director Zubin Bharucha, who has worked closely with Samson.""Sanju has a bit of problem both on technical and mindset front. The bat-speed on his downswing is the same for bowlers with different speeds. It will fetch him success against bowlers in the 130 kmph mark.""But anything above or less than 130 kmph mark with variations in pace either way, will create issue. The solution is to adjust his bat-speed on the downswing according to the pace of the ball. Once he does that, he should be alright,"" Raman said when asked about whether problem is of technical nature or it is the mindset.""On the mental front, he knows that there is a lot of competition for the wicketkeeper-batter's slot in white ball cricket. That's all probably putting pressure on him because he still has enough talent to work this out. He is capable player and can deliver for India,"" Raman said.Raman, however, does not believe that moving Samson in the middle order has necessarily disrupted his rhythm, pointing out that players of this generation pride themselves on flexibility.""In the T20Is, he is suited for top three and he shouldn't have any issues on that front because that is where he can perform at his best. These days, these boys talk about adaptation and being able to bat anywhere.""There shouldn't be a problem unless you are sent extremely down the order,"" Raman said.Samson is widely known as a confidence player. A few years ago, he recounted in a podcast how, after being dismissed cheaply in a match, he quietly slipped out of the stadium and sulked along Marine Drive.For Bharucha, who has worked with several Rajasthan Royals youngsters including Samson, Yashasvi Jaiswal and Dhruv Jurel, the issue lies largely in the mental space.""There is nothing technical at all. It's all in the mind for him. He oscillates from mercurial to average because of lack of clarity but it happens with everyone.""Every player that's played the game goes through this, he is no exception - Surya (Suryakumar Yadav) just recently. It's just a matter of learning to manage it better,"" feels Bharucha, who has conducted extensive research into batting mechanics.Ravichandran Ashwin recently highlighted how New Zealand attacked Samson with straighter lines, while England opted for short and fast bowling.""In such situation, it's just about hitting a few more balls in areas you feel might be weaker than your strength. He has been scoring a lot more runs on the off-side than on-side, deliberately,"" Bharucha said.""This is what all batters do, making the bowler bowl an off stump line but get into positions to score from that line. Now this immediately prompts the bowler to compensate and come inside (middle and leg) and from that position it should be easier and less risky to hit into the on-side.""Sometimes when you overly set-up to open up the off-side, you can be a little out of position for the leg-side. Just requires a little more awareness around it because Samson already has the on-side shots.""Asked about possible solutions, Bharucha added: ""Hit a few more balls in that area during practice. Ideally, constantly get the throwdown expert to move from the off stump line to the leg stump line.""",Sanju Samson has scored 1048 runs at a strike-rate of 147-plus in 55 T20Is in 11 years. Former India opener WV Raman says Samson needs to adjust his bat-speed on the downswing according to the pace of the ball. Raman does not believe that moving Samson in the middle order has necessarily disrupted his rhythm.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127545754,imgsize-57760,width-400,resizemode-4/sanju-samson-2601-pti.jpg"

Jay Shah’s 2036 Olympic blueprint for India: '8 Medals won’t cut it'

VILA-REAL: Kylian Mbappe netted twice to earn Real Madrid a 2-0 win at Villarreal on Saturday and take his side to the top of La Liga.Alvaro Arbeloa's team moved two points clear of arch-rivals Barcelona, who host bottom-of-the-table Real Oviedo on Sunday.La Liga's top scorer Mbappe reached 21 goals for the season in the competition to help Madrid see off a spirited Villarreal side, who are now fourth.Arbeloa's side have won three consecutive matches across all competitions and victory at Villarreal could be a vital step in the revival of their season.After the shock Copa del Rey defeat at second-tier Albacete in Arbeloa's first match at the helm just 10 days ago after replacing Xabi Alonso, his Madrid have started to take shape.The coach has made clear how important his star players are and none has been more crucial this season than French superstar Mbappe, who has netted 34 times across all competitions.Mbappe and Vinicius Junior ""are the best players in the world, they are players who can really unbalance teams, we try to get the ball to them as much as possible,"" Arbeloa told Real Madrid TV.""They're two players who... I'm really happy to have in this state of form and above all, because of the great work they are doing.""They are really committed to the team, they are the first who are pressing... they're giving this effort and solidarity that we need from them, so I'm very happy that their reward comes in the form of goals.""It was a lively but imprecise start at Villarreal's Estadio de la Ceramica, as the game glowed but neither side was able to seriously threaten.Georges Mikautadze lashed a volley narrowly wide after veteran forward Gerard Moreno found him with a floating cross.At the other end, Madrid midfielder Arda Guler fired straight at Villarreal stopper Luiz Junior after some tidy footwork, and then shot high over the bar at the end of a swift break.Villarreal's Juan Foyth limped off hurt in a blow for the hosts, who created a good chance for Pape Gueye just before the break.The Senegal midfielder, a champion at the Africa Cup of Nations last weekend, powered narrowly wide of the post.Vinicius, who excelled in Madrid's 6-1 Champions League rout of Monaco in midweek, also came close with a rasping effort that sailed across Luiz Junior's goal and wide.The 25-year-old Brazil forward went a 13th straight La Liga match without scoring, but was involved as Mbappe found the net two minutes into the second half.- 'Nightmare for defences' -Vinicius came into the box from the left flank and his low cross was blocked but Mbappe was on hand to squeeze home his 20th league goal of the campaign from close range.""They are a nightmare for defences,"" said Madrid goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois. ""I hope they can keep bringing joy.""Villarreal had the better of the second half as they worked hard to pull level, but Moreno spurned their best chance by firing inches over when well-placed.In stoppage time, Mbappe was felled clumsily by Alfonso Pedraza in the box and the French forward cheekily dinked home the resulting penalty to seal Madrid's victory.Mbappe's team-mate Brahim Diaz, who missed a similar attempted Panenka penalty for Morocco in the Africa Cup of Nations final, was on the pitch to see it as he returned to action for his club.""For you,"" Mbappe appeared to say to Diaz during the celebration, indicating it was a gesture of support.""For me, the most important thing is that (the players) are united, we saw it last Wednesday with Vinicius's goal (against Monaco) and we saw it again today, with Brahim,"" Arbeloa told reporters.The Yellow Submarine are now 10 points behind leaders Madrid, having played one fewer match than Arbeloa's side.""We have to be a bit more accurate in attack against these kinds of teams,"" admitted Villarreal midfielder Alberto Moleiro.Elsewhere, fifth-placed Espanyol fell to a 3-2 defeat at Valencia that left them seven points behind Villarreal.",Kylian Mbappe scores twice as Real Madrid beat Villarreal 2-0 in La Liga.

Having made a blockbuster €140 million move from Bayer Leverkusen to Anfield, Florian Wirtz has had a tricky start to life at Anfield and in the Premier League . Widely regarded as one of Europe’s most gifted creative attackers, the 22-year-old Germany international arrived at Liverpool on the back of a standout spell in Bundesliga, where his freedom, intelligence and ability to control games marked him out as a generational talent.In the 29 games he's played at Liverpool across competitions, he's scored four goals and provided seven assists.Before the eventual move to the Merseyside, there was interest also from Bayern Munich. But Wirtz’s decision to embrace the Premier League underlines both his ambition and belief in Liverpool’s long-term vision.In this wide-ranging exclusive conversation with TimesofIndia.com, facilitated by JioStar, Wirtz reflects on the pull of Liverpool’s history, the challenge of meeting sky-high expectations, and the clarity provided by the manager’s plans for the team.Liverpool's immense stature as a club first and foremost. The team that clinched the Premier League last year. Above all, the manager's vision convinced me.Tactics aren't much different from the Bundesliga or Germany duty.In-game, it's the physicality I need to adapt to most.They've had many great midfielders. I just focus on giving my best on the pitch. I don't know what sets me apart—whether I do better or they did. I simply want to play my game and achieve success with the club.Probably the first Newcastle game. It was wildly intense — the early red card, endless long balls, two-footed tackles, everything. The crowd went berserk. That moment made me think, 'This league is different from the Bundesliga.’I don't measure success in specific terms. I focus on delivering my best performance wherever I am — at Liverpool or with the national team—to be vital for the squad and drive achievements.

Route 66

Trump Booed Loudly As Miami Stadium Erupts During College Football Playoff

AI to help with planning itineraries

BENGALURU: For those who are preparing to pack their bags to watch the likes of Lionel Messi, Kylian Mbappe, and Lamine Yamal in any of the 11 American cities that will host the World Cup 2026 matches, the Americans are determined to make it football’s best ever showpiece event. Awaiting the fans are fast-tracked visas and curated experiences, including road trips to explore the heart of the US, Route 66 being the most famous of them.The US joins Mexico and Canada to host the FIFA World Cup, the games in the US will begin with the hosts taking on Paraguay in a Group D match in Los Angeles on June 12, day after the tournament kicks off in Mexico City. That will set football (soccer for Americans) rolling across 11 cities for the next one month. The Americans, who put American football, baseball and basketball, above the world’s most popular sport are keen to make it the biggest ever spectacle for the millions of fans offering them an unbelievable time.“From New York to Miami to LA and Seattle, it’s quite a diverse list of host cities. I think each of the host cities are excited to put on a great show, and really engage their communities because it is very much about the communities that are hosting as well.The fan fests are going to be a great way to go beyond the stadium into the community. Local food, culture, music, and engaging with local communities as well. It’s hard to describe how exciting it’s going to be. I think it's going to be beyond any of our expectations,” Fred Dixon, president and CEO of Brand USA, told TOI in an exclusive interview.Speaking on the sidelines of the Brand USA Travel Week India held here, Dixon said the authorities also plan to make it easy for the spectators to get the US visa. “If you decide to buy tickets to the World Cup and you don’t have your visa yet, there actually is a way to facilitate that process to identify yourself as a ticket holder, and then the State Department will work to facilitate the visa processing faster for those travelers,” Dixon said.Dixon was particularly excited to welcome the Indians travelling for the World Cup. “In places like New Jersey and New York, places like Atlanta and Dallas, Texas, those are obviously big communities. The communities will come to life through the fan fests and so there will be the official fan fest events for every host city. So you'll be in the communities with the locals or with your friends and the people you're traveling with. With more than 5 million Indians living in the US, seeking out and traveling with or spending time with family and friends will be a big component of that,” Dixon said.On whether there will be any relaxation for the fans from Haiti and Iran, Dixon didn’t have an answer. “You’d have to check with the State Department,” he said.For those millions who get entry into the US and the special ones who get lucky through the draw, FIFA said there were 500 million requests for tickets to watch the matches, the US wanted to wow them. On top of the list are the road trips including the iconic Route 66.“It’s a unique moment as well because it’s the 250th anniversary of America. So you have America, 250 activities happening all across the country as well. The other anniversary that’s happening this year is Route 66. It's the 100th anniversary of the famous highway (opened on Nov 11, 1926) that connects California and Chicago -- from Chicago to Santa Monica. It winds through small, interesting towns all across the west of the US. And so you’re going to see a lot of themes around road trips, that freedom of the open road in America. So I think there will be a lot of curated experiences around road trips,” said Dixon.“In the host cities themselves, you’re going to have lots of curated experiences, whether it relates to museums, art, exhibitions. The travelers are going to benefit from the focus on a lot of Americana, both historical, but also what American brands, I think, have meant to the world. The Fleet Week, which is one of the big celebrations in New York every year in the harbour, has been moved from what is normally in late May. It’s now moving to July 4th. So just imagine the Statue of Liberty with fireworks and all the Navy fleets, you know. It’s expected to have the largest gathering of tall ships in the world for America 250, which will travel up the east coast of the US. So there is an unlimited amount of curated experiences to have,” Dixon added.“At americathebeautiful.com , we actually have AI integration to help with trip inspiration, particularly when you are dealing with an event that is multi-city, multi-date. We know what the group schedule will be, but as teams advance beyond the group, who’s going to the quarterfinals, who’s going to the semifinals, how would you route yourself? The itineraries may be dynamic if you’re following a particular team. And so our new website has an AI component built into it to help with itinerary suggestions and plannings and ideas.“You also can integrate what your passion points are. So if it’s culture, if it’s history and food, it will help give you highlights and ideas for how you can route yourself. It’s not a booking platform, but it's an inspiration platform. We’ve used AI in a way to help tap into really what is the best of America, and then to inspire travelers to travel, you know, far and to travel deep when they're in the US to explore the World cup, specifically,” Dixon signed off.","The US joins Mexico and Canada to host the FIFA World Cup. The games in the US will begin with the hosts taking on Paraguay in a Group D match in Los Angeles on June 12, day after the tournament kicks off in Mexico City.

He is survived by his wife, two daughters, and two sons.The All India Football Federation (AIFF) condoled the death of Pasha, who was one of the best footballers to have come out of Karnataka.A committed and soft-spoken footballer, Pasha carved out a distinguished career in an area of the field that demanded resilience and composure - defence.Primarily operating as a right wing-back, he was renowned for his impeccable sense of timing, calm demeanour, and ability to read the game astutely.Rarely flustered under pressure, Pasha's disciplined positioning and well-judged tackles ensured that opposing left wingers found little joy on his flank, while goalkeepers behind him operated with added confidence.At the international level, Pasha made his senior India debut on January 27, 1987, against Bulgaria in the Nehru Cup at Kozhikode.He went on to earn eight international caps, featuring in two editions of the Nehru Cup (1987 and 1991), the 1991 SAF Games, and the 1992 Asian Cup qualifiers.Pasha began his football journey with Vinayaka Football Club, Vyalikaval, in north Bengaluru, where he also resided.His consistent performances soon earned him a move to Indian Telephone Industries in the mid-1980s, a period that marked his emergence at the national level.From 1987 onwards, he became a regular feature for Karnataka in the Santosh Trophy , representing the state at the tournaments held in Kolkata in 1987, Quilon (now Kollam) in 1988, and Guwahati in 1989.His performance in Guwahati stood out, as Karnataka narrowly missed out on a final berth. He also won two Santosh Trophy titles with Bengal in 1993 and 1995.On the back of his domestic exploits, Pasha was signed by Mohammedan Sporting, where he continued to enhance his reputation, winning the Sait Nagjee Trophy and the Nizam Gold Cup in 1989.He later joined East Bengal, a move that ushered in the most defining phase of his club career. Representing the iconic red and gold from the early 1990s through the end of the decade, Pasha became an integral part of one of the club's most successful eras.He captained East Bengal during the 1993-94 season and was a trusted figure under the late coach Subhas Bhowmick.With the Red and Gold Brigade, he won the Calcutta Football League on five occasions (1991, 1993, 1995, 1996 and 1998), the IFA Shield five times (1990, 1991, 1994, 1995 and 1997), and the Durand Cup four times (1990, 1991, 1993 and 1995).His trophy cabinet also included two Rovers Cups (1990, 1994), the Federation Cup (1996), the historic Wai Wai Cup in Kathmandu (1993), Airlines Trophy titles in 1990, 1992, 1995 and 1997, the Bordoloi Trophy (1992), ATPA Shield (1992), Kalinga Cup (1993), McDowell Trophy (1995, 1997), and the Super Cup in the 1996-97 season.He was also a member of East Bengal's celebrated triple crown-winning side in 1990 and captained the team to its first international title at the Wai Wai Cup in 1993.He also wore the captain's armband when East Bengal registered a sensational 6-2 victory over Iraq's Al Zawraa SC in the 1993-94 Asian Cup Winners' Cup.He got a special Lifetime Achievement Award from East Bengal in 2012.The AIFF said it has joined the Indian football fraternity in mourning the loss of Pasha, a defender of rare composure and consistency, to honour his lasting contributions to the game.In Kolkata, the East Bengal flag was kept at half-mast on the day, while the club's Under-16 team observed a minute's silence before training.Former East Bengal skipper Falguni Dutta, who played alongside Pasha for two years, remembered him fondly. ""I came to know early in the morning. I was shocked.""When I came to the club in 1997, I was a raw talent and he was there to guide me as a mentor. He played in the same position as me, but I never saw any jealousy in him. He was like an elder brother -- a guide and a coach. He inspired us,"" Dutta said.East Bengal Club bid a final farewell to Pasha at his Bengaluru residence.Working committee member Dipten Bose paid his respects, while former players Saravanan, Thomas and Feroz were also present.","Former India and East Bengal defender Ilyas Pasha dies at 61.

From Rs 275 crore to bare bones: AIFF faces a tough test to sell ISL broadcast rights,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/news/from-rs-275-crore-to-bare-bones-aiff-faces-a-tough-test-to-sell-isl-broadcast-rights/articleshow/127128213.cms,"With no takers for its first tender, the AIFF is scrambling to find a broadcaster for ISL 2025–26.

AIFF have no bargaining power

Time for recalibration

What does the current RFP say?

Poll What is your opinion on the AIFF's decision to issue a second Request for Proposal for ISL broadcast rights? It's a necessary step for improvement It shows a lack of planning It's too late to make a difference I have no opinion on this

Last week, the All India Football Federation (AIFF) floated a Request for Proposal (RFP) tender looking for a broadcast partner for the 2025-26 Indian Super League (ISL) season. This was the second time in six months that the AIFF had issued such a document as the first version, released in October 2025, demanded an annual minimum guarantee of Rs 37.5 crore. For a variety of reasons, that didn't find any takers.Ever since, Indian football is in a free fall.AIFF's deal with Football Sports Development Limited (FSDL), which had started the ISL in 2014, expired on December 8, 2025. Between AIFF Constitutional changes, court visits, lack of commercial partners and eventual intervention by the Sports Ministry, ISL has taken a massive hit to its credibility, even if it now has a start date in February 14.The fixtures for ISL 2025-26, which have been tucked away in the draft folder for days due to home venues being in shambles, add to the challenge for any prospective broadcast bidder(s).With 91 matches to be played in the upcoming truncated season in a single leg home-and-away format, this race against time only gets trickier with each passing day. The fact that AIFF have not officially appointed an agency to oversee the broadcast bids process doesn't bode well either.In 2021, the BCCI brought in audit, tax and financial advisory consultants KPMG to advise them on the media rights sale for the IPL. The objective was clear: earn 'top dollar.' It resulted in media rights for the IPL going at Rs 48,390.32 crore over five years - a 100 percent jump in value per match.AIFF, which has hardly showcased its competence in the past few months, is alone in this regard. Before FSDL stepped away, the ISL had a broadcast deal worth Rs 550 crore over two seasons with games showcased on linear TV and OTT. At first, ISL matches were broadcast on the Star Sports Network before moving to the Viacom18-owned Sports18/JioCinema.The Rs 275 crore-a-year deal was reportedly a 37.5 percent increase on what Star India, who had a majority stake in the ISL, had been paying in the first 10 years of the competition.This Rs 275 crore funded things such as match production, league marketing, revenue for the clubs and fixed payments to the federation. Despite this, FSDL posted losses of Rs 14.34 crore in FY23, Rs 46.3 crore in FY22, Rs 13.7 crore in FY21 and Rs 27 crore in FY20. The league only turned profitable when operations were scaled down, posting a net profit of Rs 45.2 crore in FY24.Now, in this post-FSDL era, AIFF and, by extension, the ISL clubs have little room to negotiate with any potential bidders. With the ISL set to be played in multiple cities, it adds to the costs involved with only Rs 9.77 crore budgeted for Production and Transmission. In the past, it hovered around Rs 70 crores.It means the quality output of the broadcast will be lower. Instead of multi-camera setups in different parts of the ground, one can expect 3-4 cameras, similar to the I-League coverage where equipment is placed at a high vantage point, behind the goal and near the half-way line.An ISL club official, who spoke to TimesofIndia.com on the condition of anonymity, said that organising the league in multiple cities could dissuade potential bidders. He also reminded that options are limited anyway, as February-March is also the period for the T20 World Cup in India and Sri Lanka, which JioStar will broadcast.The logic is simple: higher viewership means higher sponsorship for clubs and with an inferior product, that Rs 5-6 crore piece of the puzzle is going to take a hit. All clubs are braced for another year of red in their balance sheet. Even though many will cut costs operationally and have reduced player wages, the losses are expected to be three times the normal in the absence of commercial revenue.Like other aspects of the ISL including franchise fees and player salaries, the broadcast rights value also needs to be recalibrated for a healthier future. While this upcoming season can largely be logged as a stop-gap solution-finding exercise, the exercise towards an economically viable product needs to begin now. As ICC and BCCI have found out, mindless pricing of broadcast deals will drive away smaller players in the streaming space. And unlike sports like cricket and kabaddi - whose audience still consumes coverage on linear TV - football's young viewership exists on OTT.Subsequently, if players stay away due to pricing, it will further dwindle AIFF's options. Among the major broadcast players - on linear TV and digital - there are few options outside of JioStar and Sony Sports Network.AIFF's RFP for media rights of the ISL is a 39-page document that lays down the detailed eligibility framework for prospective bidders and specifies the timelines for bids to be submitted, examined and assessed.As per the schedule, the AIFF has fixed January 23 for a pre-bid meeting with interested parties, while any written queries or requests for clarification may be addressed by up to January 27.Bids must be submitted no later than 5:00 pm IST on February 1, with each submission accompanied by a security deposit of Rs. 5 lakh.Eligibility conditions require bidders to be broadcasters or internet operators with a minimum of three years’ operational experience.In addition, bidders must have recorded a net worth of at least Rs. 10 crore in the most recent financial year (2024–25) and an average annual revenue of no less than Rs. 10 crore across the last three completed financial years — 2022–23, 2023–24 and 2024–25.In the case of consortium bids, a maximum of three entities may come together under a special purpose vehicle (SPV). One member must be designated as the ‘Lead member’ and hold at least a 51 percent equity stake in the SPV’s paid-up and subscribed share capital.Each bid will be evaluated in two components — Technical and Financial — carrying weightages of 70 percent and 30 percent respectively. The bidder securing the highest overall score will be awarded the rights for the forthcoming season.","The All India Football Federation (AIFF) floated a Request for Proposal (RFP) tender looking for a broadcast partner for the 2025-26 Indian Super League (ISL) season.

Mike McCarthy's connection could shape Garrett Nussmeier’s NFL future as the Steelers eye quarterback options.,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/mike-mccarthys-connection-could-shape-garrett-nussmeiers-nfl-future-as-the-steelers-eye-quarterback-options-/articleshow/127591123.cms,"Mike McCarthy's's connection could shape Garrett Nussmeier’s NFL future as Steelers eye quarterback option(Image via Getty)

Why Mike McCarthy’s history with the Garett Nussmeier family stands out





Garrett Nussmeier’s NFL future may not depend only on arm talent or college tape. His path could run through a coaching relationship that started years before draft boards took shape. As the Steelers study quarterback options for the 2026 NFL Draft, Mike McCarthy’s link to the Nussmeier family gives Pittsburgh rare insight into the LSU passer.That link matters because Pittsburgh is still searching for a reliable quarterback. The franchise has rotated starters since Ben Roethlisberger retired after the 2021 season. If the Steelers want a young QB they can develop, McCarthy’s history with the position puts him at the center of that decision.Mike McCarthy built his fame by developing quarterbacks, most notably Aaron Rodgers in Green Bay from 2006 to 2018. NFL insiders still view him as a detail-driven coach who focuses on footwork, timing, and decision-making. When he took the Big D. job in Jan. 2020, he made his philosophy clear. “I’m a builder. I’m a teacher,” McCarthy said during his introductory press conference on January 8, 2020, in Frisco, Texas.That mindset shapes how he views young passersDoug Nussmeier, Garrett’s father, worked on several NFL staffs and served as quarterbacks coach with the Cowboys from 2020 to 2022. That role put him in McCarthy’s offensive meeting rooms daily. Coaches talk football beyond the playbook in those settings. They talk about habits, preparation, and how young quarterbacks grow. Through that overlap, McCarthy gained early insight into Garrett’s development at LSU, his approach to film study, and his handling of coaching.The young QB has the caliber to fit a structured system. He throws with anticipation and shows comfort working through pocket progressions. He still needs to limit risky throws and protect the ball when pressure closes in. Those are coachable issues, especially in an offense that values timing and discipline.The Pittsburgh Steelers hold valuable draft capital in 2026 and face a clear question at quarterback. If McCarthy believes Nussmeier’s strengths match his system and trusts the background he knows, that link could push the Steelers to act. That decision would not just fill a roster spot. It could shape the next era of Steelers football.","Garrett Nussmeier’s NFL future may not depend only on arm talent or college tape.

Jaxson Dart mixes offseason training and fun, landing massive tuna on boat with Marissa Ayers



Jaxson Dart is making the most of his first NFL offseason, and it looks like he’s doing it in style. The New York Giants’ young quarterback traded playbooks for fishing rods, heading off the coast of Mexico for a deep-sea adventure. With his girlfriend, model Marissa Ayers, by his side, Dart reeled in a massive yellowfin tuna, a catch that might have been the freshest either of them had ever tasted.After a rookie season full of highs and challenges, Dart deserves this break. He threw for 2,272 yards with 15 touchdowns and five interceptions, and also added 487 rushing yards and nine scores over 14 games. Doing so without star wide receiver Malik Nabers for most of the year highlights just how much potential the young quarterback has. While the Giants finished 4-13, Dart’s individual performance suggested a bright future in New York.Dart isn’t just relaxing; he’s setting an example for how a franchise quarterback balances hard work with recovery. “Sunshine, bikinis, being out in the water are key right now,” experts note. Dart and Ayers’ fishing trip isn’t just fun—it’s part of the essential rest and recovery phase that fuels peak performance.The young quarterback knows that staying fresh and avoiding unnecessary hits during games will help him remain effective and healthy for the long haul.With John Harbaugh taking over as head coach, the Giants are ready to translate talent into results. Dart’s rookie campaign proved he has toughness, poise, and the instincts to lead a team. Offseason activities like fishing and soaking up the sun may seem leisurely, but they play a critical role in preparing for the long, grueling NFL season ahead. Enjoying these moments now allows Dart to return to New York ready to work, focused, and ready to push the franchise toward success.","New York Giants quarterback Jaxson Dart is making the most of his first NFL offseason.

Matthew Stafford could continue his MVP-caliber journey



Retirement or family: Matthew Stafford’s tough decision



Matthew Stafford’s name dominated headlines this season, and following the Los Angeles Rams’ narrow 31-27 loss to the Seattle Seahawks in the NFC Championship, all eyes are now on the quarterback’s next move. At nearly 38 years old, Stafford’s future in the NFL is under scrutiny. While his contract runs through 2026, the question isn’t just about football- it's about what matters most to him beyond the game.The end of the season brought heartbreak on the field, but Stafford’s quiet act at home captured hearts. In a video shared by his wife, Kelly, Stafford is seen tucking his children into bed at 2:30 a.m., after a grueling loss. Kelly wrote, “After leaving everything out on that field and coming up short, at 230 am, this was Matthew.” It’s a glimpse of the private life Stafford may prioritize in the months ahead, revealing the balancing act between elite performance and family life.Despite the late-night family moments, Stafford’s play on the field was nothing short of remarkable. He threw for 4,707 yards with 46 touchdowns and only eight interceptions, earning First-Team All-Pro honors and cementing himself as a top MVP candidate.Rams coach Sean McVay didn’t shy away from praising Stafford’s level of play.“I mean, he's the MVP of the league and if he's not ... I got respect for everybody else, but this guy played at a level that's just different,” McVay said. Stafford could easily return in 2026 and maintain his status as one of the NFL’s elite quarterbacks.When asked about retirement, Stafford offered no definitive answer, reflecting the complexity of the choice. “I can't generalize six months of my life 10 minutes after a loss,” he said.""So I appreciate the guys in this locker room a whole hell of a lot. Everybody that helped me and helped our team be the success that we were this year. And that's all I'll answer for you.""The veteran has completed 17 seasons, and while football is his life, the offseason may bring new priorities. The video of him at home shows a side of Stafford that fans rarely see-a father deeply engaged with his children, possibly hinting that family might outweigh football in the near future.For now, Rams fans wait and watch. Whether Stafford suits up in 2026 or decides to step away, one thing is certain: he remains an MVP in every sense, both on the field and at home.","The Los Angeles Rams lost 31-27 to the Seattle Seahawks in the NFC Championship.

Browns’ Shedeur Sanders earns shockingly low Pro Bowl payout after replacing Patriots star Drake Maye,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/browns-shedeur-sanders-earns-shockingly-low-pro-bowl-payout-after-replacing-patriots-star-drake-maye/articleshow/127586057.cms,"Shedeur Sanders is being added to the Pro Bowl Games roster (Getty Images)

Shedeur Sanders and a Pro Bowl nod that defies logic



Shedeur Sanders walked into the NFL with a spotlight he did not ask for and a draft position few expected. Now, the Cleveland Browns rookie quarterback has done something that feels unreal. On Monday, he was named to the AFC Pro Bowl roster. The news spread fast, partly because of how rare it is and partly because of how unexpected it feels in a league obsessed with numbers.The announcement came at a strange moment in the season. Cleveland finished with a losing record. The coaching staff turned over. The quarterback room remained unsettled. Yet in the middle of that chaos, Sanders found himself elevated to a stage reserved for the league’s elite. It is the kind of story that makes fans stop scrolling and ask how this even happened.Sanders became a Pro Bowler after a chain of unusual circumstances opened the door. Josh Allen is the AFC starter, with Justin Herbert already slotted as a reserve. Drake Maye was also selected, but with the Patriots heading to Super Bowl LX, the league needed a replacement. Injuries ruled out other high profile names, and suddenly Sanders was next in line.The path to this moment has been anything but smooth. Cleveland drafted Sanders in the fifth round with the 144th overall pick in the 2025 NFL draft, despite many analysts projecting him as a first round talent. He began the season buried on the depth chart behind Joe Flacco and fellow rookie Dillon Gabriel. Gabriel stepped in early, and Sanders did not take over until Week 12.In seven starts, Sanders posted numbers that rarely earn Pro Bowl praise. He completed 56.6 percent of his passes for 1,400 yards, threw seven touchdowns, and finished with 10 interceptions. His passer rating and QBR ranked near the bottom of the league. Even supporters admit the stats do not tell a Pro Bowl story.Still, history now includes his name. Sanders is the first rookie fifth round pick to make the Pro Bowl since Puka Nacua in 2023. He also carries the weight and legacy of his father, Deion Sanders, an eight time Pro Bowler who built a career on confidence and edge.Beyond the shock value, the Pro Bowl nod also comes with a modest financial perk. Sanders does not have any performance bonuses tied to Pro Bowl selections in his four-year, $4.6 million rookie deal. Still, simply showing up pays. Players on the winning side earn $92,000, while those on the losing team take home $46,000. For a fifth-round rookie, it is not life-changing money, but it is a meaningful bump and a symbolic reward for a season that defied logic.There is no guarantee Sanders will be Cleveland’s starter next season. Yet he will suit up for the Pro Bowl, collect a solid bonus, and take part in an experience few rookies ever reach. In a league built on expectations, this moment proves that the NFL still finds ways to surprise everyone.","Shedeur Sanders is the first rookie fifth round pick to make the Pro Bowl since Puka Nacua in 2023.

Patriots reach Super Bowl and Skip Bayless sparks firestorm involving Tom Brady

The New England Patriots are back on the sport’s biggest stage, and the moment feels both familiar and strange. For nearly two decades, Super Bowl trips in Foxborough carried one constant presence. This time, the quarterback under center is not a legend nearing the end of a dynasty, but a young face leading a reborn franchise with confidence and calm.That contrast is what has ignited debate. As the Patriots prepare for another Super Bowl appearance, the conversation has drifted beyond the field. It has landed squarely on legacy, pride, and whether greatness can feel threatened when success returns without you.According to Skip Bayless, the situation may be more complicated for Tom Brady than many fans would expect. Bayless took to social media and offered a provocative take on how the seven time Super Bowl champion might view the Patriots’ return to prominence under Drake Maye.""I don't think Tom Brady loves this. I don't think Brady's going to love it for his legacy that some second-year starter as he was, flipped the switch right back and got the Patriots right back to the Super Bowl.I think it'll in Tom's eyes diminish his legacy a little bit.""The claim quickly divided people. Brady is the face of the Patriots brand. He won six Super Bowls while he was with the team and changed the way people measure quarterback greatness. A lot of people think it's hard to believe that a young successor could ruin his legacy.But Maye's quick rise has changed the way people talk. He led the Patriots to a tense AFC Championship win over the Denver Broncos in just his second season. He showed calmness that belied his lack of experience. The team has looked disciplined and strong under head coach Mike Vrabel, which are traits that have been linked to the Brady era for a long time.The Patriots now turn their attention to Super Bowl LX, where they will face the Seattle Seahawks led by Sam Darnold. One win would cement Maye’s breakout season and deepen the ongoing debate about eras, evolution, and whether a dynasty ever truly belongs to just one man.For now, the spotlight remains shared. History is watching, and so are the arguments.",The New England Patriots are back in the Super Bowl with a young quarterback at the helm. Skip Bayless said he doesn't think Tom Brady will be happy about the Patriots' return to prominence under Drake Maye.

Dave Portnoy and the NFL ban that shaped a media rivalry



Dave Portnoy has never been subtle about where he stands with the NFL , and now, after nearly a decade of tension, the standoff appears to be fading. The Barstool Sports founder revealed that the league’s long-running ban on his presence at NFL events may finally be over, just as his beloved New England Patriots surge back onto the sport’s biggest stage. Timing, as always with Portnoy, feels poetic.The moment carries weight beyond one man’s access badge. It hints at a quiet thaw between a disruptive media empire and a league that once wanted nothing to do with it. Portnoy broke the news himself, framing it with trademark flair and restraint at once. “I’m hearing that the NFL ban on Barstool Sports has been lifted,” he wrote. “This hasn’t been 100% confirmed but the Cold War may be over.” For a feud born in chaos, the possible ending feels oddly calm.The roots of the conflict stretch back to 2015, when the Deflategate scandal engulfed Tom Brady and the Patriots. Portnoy, never shy about defending his team, took his protest straight to the NFL’s front door. Alongside three Barstool colleagues, he staged a sit-in at league headquarters in New York, handcuffing themselves to the lobby floor. Arrests followed, and so did consequences.The NFL later made its position clear, citing the incident as grounds to deny credentials to anyone “involved in such antics. ”That decision effectively shut Barstool out of marquee events. Super Bowl week credentials vanished. Radio Row appearances disappeared. Even when the Patriots won it all in 2019, Portnoy found himself escorted out after trying to blend in with a disguise. The message was unmistakable.Now, years later, Portnoy believes the temperature has dropped. He expects to be inside Levi’s Stadium for Super Bowl LX, watching New England chase another title under head coach Mike Vrabel and quarterback Drake Maye. The Patriots earned that right with a gritty 10-7 win over the Denver Broncos, punching their ticket to Santa Clara to face Sam Darnold and the Seattle Seahawks.Still, Portnoy is keeping his edge sharp. He insists there will be no problem unless the league creates one. “I promise you this -- if they try to drag me out of the Super Bowl, I have perfected the dead fish and it will be quite a viral moment because I will never walk willingly out of a Super Bowl when I am a paid customer.”For a rivalry built on defiance, that line feels like the perfect closing note. Or the perfect setup for one last scene.",Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy says his NFL ban has been lifted. The ban was imposed after he staged a sit-in at the NFL's New York headquarters in 2015. The NFL later cited the incident as grounds to deny credentials to anyone “involved in such antics. ”,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127584712,imgsize-58966,width-400,resizemode-4/dave-portnoy39s-nfl-ban-has-been-lifted.jpg"

Kayla Nicole has entered 2026 with clarity and zero patience for emotional chaos. While casually sharing her skincare routine on Instagram , the media personality delivered a sharp and intentional message about the kind of relationship she wants next. It was not performative or dramatic. It was firm, funny, and deeply relatable for anyone who has outgrown confusion in dating.Nicole didn't focus on romance itself; instead, she focused on character. Her message got through because it was about feelings, not celebrity gossip. In a digital world full of mixed messages and fake love, she chose to be honest and respect herself. A lot of people, especially women who see limits as a chance to grow instead of a chance to be angry, connected with the moment.During her Instagram Story, Nicole made her expectations unmistakably clear, saying, ""Things I absolutely do not have time for in 2026. Men. Men who lie. Men who lie terribly. Inconsistent energy. Mixed signals. Audacity with no resume. Emotional babysitting. Explaining basic respect and especially dry conversations, or dry skin,"" keeping the tone light with a skincare joke that still carried weight.Nicole’s words were not aimed at any one person. They reflected experience.

Nicole's call for emotional babysitting and basic respect was in line with a larger cultural shift toward intentional relationships.

Cooper Kupp redemption arc defines Seahawks Super Bowl push



Anna Kupp shares an emotional note after Cooper Kupp won the NFC Championship with the Seahawks (Instagram)

Cooper Kupp just wrote one of the most emotional chapters of the NFL postseason on Sunday night, and it unfolded in the place that shaped him. Back in the Pacific Northwest, with family close and purpose restored, the veteran wide receiver delivered when it mattered most. The NFC Championship Game did not just send the Seattle Seahawks to the Super Bowl . It offered Kupp a moment of personal vindication after a year defined by doubt, distance, and difficult choices.The storyline carried weight because it felt human. A former Super Bowl MVP, now 32, Kupp no longer carries an offense on his back. Yet football has a way of honoring resolve. His performance against the Los Angeles Rams, the team that once defined his career, carried the quiet power of someone who never stopped believing he belonged on this stage.Kupp’s return home to Washington came with modest expectations. Seattle’s offense now runs through Jaxon Smith-Njigba, the explosive 23-year-old who represents the franchise’s future. Kupp accepted a different role. He blocked, he mentored, and when the moment arrived, he made the tough catches that tilt playoff games. The Seahawks’ 31-27 win over the Rams reflected that balance, youth driving energy while experience steadied the chaos.The scene after the final whistle captured the meaning behind the result. Kupp stood with his wife, Anna Marie Kupp, and their three sons, Cooper Jameson, Cypress Stellar, and Solas Reign. It was a family victory as much as a professional one. Former teammate Matthew Stafford summed it up best when he told him, ""Go win your damn Super Bowl, kid.""Anna’s words after the game added emotional depth to the night. Her message blended faith, resilience, and honesty. She wrote, ""watching my husband be disrespected by so many people we thought were in our corner, learning, releasing, forgiving, but not forgetting, because that takes away from the gravity and weight of how we had to trust a good GOD and how he CARRIED ME."" The message revealed scars that never fully healed, even as forgiveness took root.According to reporting from The Athletic’s Michael Silver, the separation between Kupp and the Rams had been long and painful. The relationship reportedly included suggestions he retire, questions about his value, and silence from team leadership after eight seasons. Those moments linger.Now, one game remains. A Super Bowl win would not erase the past, but it would finish the story exactly how Kupp imagined it.","Cooper Kupp's return home to Washington came with modest expectations.

She explained that going public happened naturally and has not changed their relationship. Garrett plans to attend the Games in Italy, returning the support Kim showed him during the NFL season.

Chloe Kim and Myles Garrett keep love simple amid spotlight

Public moments have a way of changing private relationships, especially when two elite athletes cross worlds. For Chloe Kim, a single sideline kiss quietly confirmed what fans had been speculating for weeks. It was not planned, not staged, and not designed for headlines. Yet it became one of the most talked-about snapshots of the NFL season.As cameras rolled and curiosity followed, Kim stayed grounded. Her approach to love mirrors her approach to competition. Calm, honest, and free of unnecessary noise. While fame magnifies everything, she made it clear that the relationship itself remains unchanged behind the scenes.Kim acknowledged that stepping into a public relationship felt unfamiliar at first. “I’ve never really been in a public relationship. So I think I've always been a little scared of it.” She explained that the moment unfolded naturally, without intention or strategy. “But I did not know that that was going to happen. I think it was a really sweet thing. No one's mad about it. Which is a good start.”Her relationship with Myles Garrett has grown quietly, without forcing privacy or chasing attention.“I don't think we were trying super hard to keep it private. But it wasn't something we wanted to blast publicly.” Kim emphasized that visibility has not altered the core of what they share. “We just did our thing. We didn't really think too much about it, but now that it's out, it's whatever. Nothing is going to change. We're very happy. We're just going to keep supporting each other.”That support became visible when Kim flew overnight to Cleveland to surprise Garrett at a game. “He was so surprised. That was my first time successfully surprising him.” The visit deepened her connection to football and the city itself. “I wasn't necessarily a football fan before, but now I'm all about it. And, man, the fans in Cleveland are so wonderful.”Garrett plans to return the favor by traveling to Italy for the Olympics. Kim summed it up simply and warmly. “Now it's his turn to support me.” In a world driven by spectacle, their relationship stands out for its steadiness. Two stars. One shared rhythm. No rush.","Chloe Kim and Myles Garrett's kiss was one of the most talked-about moments of the NFL season. Kim said that going public happened naturally and has not changed their relationship.

Fans turn on Cardi B after viral clip shows her cursing a young girl

What started as a happy time quickly turned into a public backlash that wouldn't go away. People were very upset with Cardi B after she said something during a live celebration that went viral on social media. Fans who used to laugh at her blunt jokes were suddenly drawing a line.A young child made a football prediction that sparked a debate about responsibility, tone, and boundaries that went viral. What should have been a fun sports moment turned into a serious argument. As the clip spread, people became more vocal and divided, putting Cardi in another uncomfortable spotlight.Ahead of the matchup between the New England Patriots and the Houston Texans, a four-year-old girl named Reese appeared in a playful video predicting the Patriots would lose. When the Patriots later won, Cardi went live to celebrate her partner Stefon Diggs bringing home the trophy.During that livestream, Cardi exclaimed, “That little white girl said we weren’t going to win, fck that b***h ! I told yall.”The reaction was immediate. Reese’s father stepped in to clarify the intent behind the video, saying, “That's my daughter... She's 4 years old. This is a lighthearted, family-friendly video where she randomly picks football helmets. Please don't direct profanity toward a child.”Online criticism followed swiftly. One user wrote, “Been telling yall Cardi and her fans are a disgrace to society.”Another added, “Miss Cardi was worth saving but she's too far gone now.”Still, not everyone turned against the rapper.

Her simple social media post, shared during championship weekend, reflected resilience and acceptance as Kansas City missed the playoffs for the first time in years and shifted focus from title runs to recovery and family.

Brittany Mahomes embraces reset as Chiefs era pauses

January has rarely looked this quiet for the Mahomes household. For years, this stretch of the NFL calendar meant pressure, playoff noise, and championship stakes. This time, the spotlight landed somewhere unexpected. While the AFC Championship unfolded without Kansas City, Brittany Mahomes made it clear she was already living in the offseason.Instead of a stadium suite or sideline celebration, Brittany chose a gym mirror and a message that spoke louder than words. Her social post, shared during the height of championship weekend, reflected both acceptance and resolve. It was a subtle signal that the chapter had turned, even if the hunger to return has not faded.Brittany Mahomes posted a workout selfie during the AFC Championship game with a caption that caught fans’ attention. “Vibing to this song every day for forever,” she wrote, pairing it with Ella Langley’s “Choosin' Texas.” The song choice nodded to shared roots with her husband, Patrick Mahomes , and hinted at grounding rather than disappointment.For seven straight seasons, the Kansas City Chiefs owned a place in the AFC Championship conversation.That run ended abruptly this year after Mahomes suffered a torn ACL and LCL in Week 15 against the Los Angeles Chargers. The injury reshaped everything. Kansas City missed the playoffs, and January became about recovery instead of rivalry.While Brittany focused on fitness and routine, the New England Patriots edged past Denver to reach Super Bowl LX. It was a stark contrast to last postseason, when Brittany celebrated wins alongside global stars and postseason confetti filled the air.Now, the Mahomes family rhythm looks different. Patrick has leaned into rehab while spending time with Brittany and their children, including celebrating daughter Golden’s first birthday. The pause has not dulled ambition. It has sharpened it.Brittany’s post was not about absence. It was about resilience. The Chiefs are out this January, but the message from their most visible supporter was unmistakable. The reset is real, and the return is already on their minds.","Brittany Mahomes posted a workout selfie during the AFC Championship game with a caption that caught fans’ attention. “Vibing to this song every day for forever,” she wrote, pairing it with Ella Langley’s “Choosin' Texas” The Chiefs are out this January, but the message from their most visible supporter was unmistakable.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127547490,imgsize-39182,width-400,resizemode-4/127547490.jpg"

While neither has addressed the rumors, recent public sightings have fueled speculation and divided fans online. Many are questioning the timing of the buzz as Earle balances public attention, personal change, and a rapidly evolving spotlight.

Alix Earle keeps things light as Tom Brady rumors grow

Alix Earle entered 2026 with a clear mindset and zero rush to define her next chapter. After closing the door on a long-term relationship late last year, the social media star has been embracing freedom, travel, and a lighter emotional pace. That openness has now placed her in the middle of unexpected dating chatter tied to one of the most famous names in football.The speculation intensified after Earle was spotted at a New Year’s Eve celebration in St. Barth’s alongside Tom Brady. Neither has spoken publicly, but repeated sightings and overlapping appearances have fueled conversation. Sources say the moment was casual, unplanned, and very much in line with Earle’s current phase of enjoying life without labels.According to Us Weekly, Earle later crossed paths with Brady again at the national championship game in Miami. She was there cheering for her alma mater, the Miami Hurricanes, while Brady attended in a professional capacity linked to the Las Vegas Raiders. The source stressed that the meeting was not planned, yet it added to the growing buzz.“She’s having fun right now,” the source adds. “She’s into Tom but it’s still nothing serious,"" a source told Us Weekly.That tone fits where Earle is emotionally. She confirmed her breakup from Braxton Berrios in December, ending a two-year relationship that had been tested by distance and changing schedules. Since then, she has focused on reconnecting with Miami, a city she has openly said still feels like home. “Damn I love miami,"" Earle said.Beyond romance rumors, Earle is stepping into a new professional phase. She recently revealed plans to star in a Netflix reality series centered on her family, offering fans a closer look at her life beyond social media.For now, sources suggest she is content staying present, having fun, and letting curiosity guide her next moves. Whether the Brady chatter fades or grows, Earle appears comfortable keeping things simple and on her own terms.","Alix Earle was spotted with Tom Brady at a New Year's Eve celebration in St. Barth's.

While staying publicly silent, Swift has leaned on Kelce’s guidance to protect her peace, set boundaries, and address personal tensions directly, even as wedding plans remain on pause.

Travis Kelce steps up as Taylor Swift quietly resets her strained friendship

When fame collides with friendship, even silence can become loud. Taylor Swift has spent years mastering how to protect her private life, yet recent legal ripples surrounding someone close to her forced a rare emotional reckoning. While Swift has stayed publicly removed from the courtroom drama, the strain behind the scenes has been real and deeply personal.At the center of it all stands Travis Kelce , whose role has quietly shifted from supportive partner to steady shield. As Swift navigates unwanted proximity to a legal dispute she never signed up for, Kelce has taken a more active position. Not by issuing statements or stirring headlines, but by making sure Swift feels seen, heard, and protected when dynamics start to feel wrong.Swift’s long-time friendship with Blake Lively has reportedly grown complicated amid Lively’s legal battle with Justin Baldoni. Although Swift has no involvement in the case, her name appearing in court documents brought unexpected pressure. What followed was not anger, but distance.According to reports, Swift finally voiced what she had been holding back, telling Lively, “You said the word ‘we’ like 18 times,” before adding, “I just kinda miss my funny, dark, normal speaking friend who talks to me as herself, not like.A plural unit… When it’s a group I’m hearing from, I feel distanced from you even more than we are geographically.”She continued with a plea that revealed emotional fatigue rather than conflict. “And you don’t need to apologize. Just come back please.”That moment did not happen in isolation. Kelce, sources say, had noticed the shift long before Swift spoke up. His concern was not rooted in dislike, but in fairness. His encouragement helped Swift trust her instincts and address the situation directly instead of shrinking from it.For Swift, the decision marked a return to emotional honesty. For Kelce, it reinforced his role as more than a partner. He became an advocate. As legal timelines move toward a March 2026 trial, Swift remains publicly silent, but privately grounded. Sometimes protection does not look like defense. Sometimes it looks like telling someone they deserve better and standing by them while they say it out loud.","Travis Kelce has become a steady source of support for Taylor Swift as she navigates emotional strain linked to ongoing legal troubles around her inner circle.

Luka Doncic's scoring milestone rewrites Lakers history



Luka Doncic and Lakers fans react to historic pace



Fresh out of being named Player of the Week, Luka Doncic has added another insane feat to his resume. He scored 2,000 points in 65 games to become the quickest Lakers to hit the milestone. Doncic keeps finding new ways to bend expectations in Los Angeles.Los Angeles entered the matchup against Chicago riding momentum, having won three of its previous four games. Consistency has been a work in progress, but recent performances have shown growth on both ends of the floor. The Doncic-led Lakers secured the stunning 129-118 victory over the Bulls as he logged 38 minutes to score 46 points, 7 rebounds, and 11 assists.The numbers behind Luka Doncic’s scoring milestone underline how dominant his recent stretch has been. Over the past week, he delivered elite performances against top competition. He poured in 38 points with 13 rebounds and 10 assists against Denver. Two nights later, he followed with 32 points, 11 rebounds, and eight assists versus the Clippers. The run continued against Dallas, where he posted 33 points, 11 assists, and eight rebounds in a hard-fought win.Now, his 2000 points in 65 games proved that he is here to make a statement.That level of production secured another Player of the Week award, the second of the season and the 16th of his career. For the year, Doncic is averaging 33.4 points, 7.8 rebounds, and 8.7 assists per game. He leads the league in scoring average and free throws made while ranking near the top in assists and steals. Reaching 2,000 points in 65 games placed him ahead of LeBron James’ pace from his first Lakers season, a comparison that adds weight inside a franchise built on scoring legends.The reaction to Luka Doncic’s scoring milestone was immediate and loud across social media. One fan captured the disbelief perfectly, writing, ""That's absolutely wild! Luka hitting 2,000 points as a Laker in just 65 games is straight-up insane pace🤯 —faster than even LeBron's 67-game mark when he first joined in 2018.🏀""Another fan focused on what it means for the league, saying, ""To reach 2,000 points in 65 games is legitimately terrifying for the rest of the league."" Praise continued to pour in as long-term potential entered the conversation. ""Luka has GOAT potential,"" one supporter commented, while another added, ""Damn even faster than Lebron.""Others highlighted how natural he looks in Los Angeles colors. "" Luka Dončić hits 2000 points as a Laker already—insane pace! The Slovenian superstar is cooking in purple & gold,"" one fan wrote. Another kept it simple, posting, ""Luka Doncic just built different 💥.""

Like, I've had stuff going on -- quads and whatnot -- but it was something that I hadn't felt before, so I definitely took advantage of the day off to get right, but hopefully that continues.”Golden State’s injury list extended beyond Curry and Green. Jimmy Butler, Jonathan Kuminga, Al Horford, and De’Anthony Melton were also unavailable, leaving the Warriors without much of their usual rotation. Despite the absences, Golden State entered the game seeking a second straight road win after a dominant performance the night before.",Minnesota's Anthony Edwards was ruled out with a foot injury shortly before tipoff.

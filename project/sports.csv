A Father's Pride: How RR, Dravid & Vikram Shaped Vaibhav Suryavanshi

NEW DELHI: Mumbai Indians continued their red-hot form in IPL 2025 with a commanding 100-run win over Rajasthan Royals at the Sawai Mansingh Stadium in Jaipur on Thursday.Central to MI's sixth straight win were opener Ryan Rickelton ’s authoritative 61 and Karn Sharma ’s clinical bowling performance, which helped dismantle RR’s fragile batting lineup.Sent to bat first, MI openers Rohit Sharma and Ryan Rickelton laid a powerful foundation. Rickelton, in particular, was relentless against the Rajasthan pacers, unleashing his full range of strokes.His 38-ball 61 was a display of fearless cricket, highlighted by a majestic flick off Fazalhaq Farooqi that soared over the ropes.He was especially effective against the quicker bowlers, handling express pace with composure and punishing any width offered.With the scoreboard ticking freely, MI posted 58/0 in the powerplay, and Rickelton reached his half-century in style with a towering six off a half-tracker from Kartikeya.While Rickelton and Rohit stitched a 116-run stand, it was the bowling unit that backed up the batters superbly -- particularly veteran leg-spinner Karn Sharma, who turned the game firmly in MI's favour after coming in as an impact substitute during the chase.With Royals reeling from the early loss of teenager Vaibhav Suryavanshi and Yashasvi Jaiswal, Karn struck thrice, removing Dhruv Jurel, Maheesh Theekshana and Kumar Kartikeya to notch up a figure of 3/23 with an economy of 5.80.His disciplined lines and clever variations choked the middle order and exposing RR’s lack of depth.With Trent Boult, Jasprit Bumrah and Deepak Chahar providing pace and bounce up front, Karn’s control in the middle overs ensured that RR never recovered.Rajasthan folded for just 117 in 16.1 overs, unable to cope with the scoreboard pressure or MI's all-round execution.With this comprehensive win, Mumbai Indians not only ended Rajasthan's playoff chances but also sent a strong message to the rest of the league: they’re peaking at the perfect time.",Mumbai Indians beat Rajasthan Royals by 100 runs in IPL 2025. Ryan Rickelton top scored for MI with 61 from 38 balls. Karn Sharma took three wickets for 3/23 with an economy of 5.80. MI have now won six consecutive matches in the IPL.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120801695,imgsize-206712,width-400,resizemode-4/Jaipur-Mumbai-Indians-Ryan-Rickelton-gets-clean-bowled-during-the-Indian-Premi-.jpg"

At that stage, PBKS were 116/2 after 13 overs, needing 75 from 42 balls. Shreyas Iyer tried to finish things in style but was bowled by a full delivery from Pathirana for a sublime 72 off 41 balls.Punjab's captain also received high praise from Preity Zinta.""Captain’s knock, openers’ fifty, an amazing hattrick & stunning catches!

Fresh from their thumping nine-wicket win over Gujarat Titans, Rajasthan Royals will lock horns against high-flying Mumbai Indians (MI) in match no 50 of the ongoing Indian Premier League (IPL) at the Sawai Mansingh in Jaipur on Thursday.With 14-year-old Vaibhav Suryavanshi potentially playing the knock of the tournament on Monday, the Royals have found a ray of hope in what has been an IPL campaign of missed opportunities. The hosts still have a mathematical chance of making the play-offs but deep down the management has accepted its fate.For Hardik Pandya-led Mumbai Indians, the return of Jasprit Bumrah has coincided with their ascent to the top of the table. The perennial slow starters have now collected five wins on the bounce and look unstoppable.Historically, chasing has been easier at Sai Mansingh, often due to dew setting in later in the evening, which can make the pitch flatter and harder for bowlers to grip the ball. Expect a match where batsmen can score freely, and chasing might be the preferred strategy. However, bowlers will need to be smart with their variations and lengths to contain the run flow.Yashasvi Jaiswal, Vaibhav Suryavanshi, Riyan Parag (c), Nitish Rana, Dhruv Jurel (wk), Shimron Hetmyer, Shubham Dubey, Wanindu Hasaranga, Jofra Archer, Maheesh Theekshana, Sandeep SharmaTushar Deshpande and Kumar Kartikeya,Rohit Sharma, Ryan Rickelton, Will Jacks, Suryakumar Yadav, Tilak Varma, Hardik Pandya, Naman Dhir, Deepak Chahar, Mitchell Santner, Jasprit Bumrah, Trent BoultVignesh Puthur and Karn SharmaHead-to-head301415Temperature is likely to hover in range of 28°C to 39°C during the day and evening match hours.

Brief Scores:

NEW DELHI: Yuzvendra Chahal delivered a spell for the ages, taking a stunning hat-trick to derail Chennai Super Kings ' (CSK) innings, while skipper Shreyas Iyer's knock guided Punjab Kings (PBKS) to a thrilling four-wicket win and ended Chennai's hopes for this year's playoffs at Chepauk on Wednesday in IPL 2025.Sent to bat first, CSK looked well set for a massive total after a blazing 88 off 47 balls by Sam Curran.The left-hander smashed nine fours and four sixes, steadying the innings after early wickets. Dewald Brevis chipped in with 32, and MS Dhoni’s brief cameo (11 off 4) added late fireworks. At 177/5 in the 18th over, CSK were eyeing 200+.But then came Chahal.Bowling the 19th over, Chahal turned the game on its head.First, he dismissed Dhoni, who had just hit him for a six, caught at long-off. Two balls later, Deepak Hooda edged to the keeper.On the very next delivery, Anshul Kamboj was bowled for a golden duck. He completed the hat-trick by dismissing Noor Ahmad on the final ball. From 184/5, CSK crumbled to 190 all out in 19.2 overs.Chahal finished with 4/32 in three overs, recording his second IPL hat-trick and ninth 4-wicket haul—the most in league history.In reply, PBKS chased down the target with two balls to spare. Prabhsimran Singh (54 off 36) gave them a flying start, while skipper Shreyas Iyer anchored the innings with a composed 71 off 41 balls. Despite a few hiccups in the end, PBKS crossed the line at 194/6 in 19.4 overs.Khaleel Ahmed and Matheesha Pathirana tried to stage a late fightback with two wickets each, but CSK’s total proved insufficient after Chahal’s damage-limiting spell.PBKS now move to second on the table with 13 points, while CSK remain stuck at the bottom, struggling with just two wins in 11 games.CSK: 190 (Curran 88, Chahal 4/32), PBKS: 194/6 (Iyer 71, Prabhsimran 54), PBKS won by 4 wickets","Yuzvendra Chahal takes hat-trick to derail Chennai Super Kings innings.

Jaipur: When Vaibhav Suryavanshi announced his arrival with a jaw-dropping 38-ball 101, a chuffed Rahul Dravid forgot about his injured leg and stood up beaming to applaud the 14-year-old. On Wednesday, putting Vaibhav’s knock in perspective, Dravid said that the 14-year-old’s ability to remain unfazed by the occasion was what stood out.“You don’t get to see (knocks like that) with people who are so young. The range of shots he showed, he is only going to develop and get better. Nobody is saying he is a finished article. He will have to keep working hard. No one should be in a rush to proclaim him as something he is not. He is what he is, an exceptionally talented young player,” Dravid said during the Star Sports Press Room show.The former India captain and coach said that the Royals coaching staff had given Vaibhav the freedom to express himself. “He is going to have his share of ups and downs. The nature of the T20 format is such that he is going to have some days where things won’t work out. From our side, we encourage him to play the game he enjoys. It’s important that we allow him to express himself and as he goes on, there will be lessons he will learn and mistakes he will make. He will refine himself and mould himself as time goes on. But as of now, from our side it’s all about letting him go out and have some fun and soak in everything,” the head coach said.Now that Vaibhav is the talk of the town, how does one protect him from the intense public glare? “He can’t completely avoid experiencing what’s going on around him. A lot of things will be beyond his and our control. We can’t control how much people are going to talk about him. It’s about recognising that this is what happens and helping him navigate all of this attention and still allowing him that space to be a youngster. But I think that is part of being a cricketer in this country,” Dravid said.","Rahul Dravid says Vaibhav Suryavanshi's ability to remain unfazed by the occasion was what stood out.

Yuzvendra Chahal strength of a warrior sir.”The comment, shared on Instagram, quickly gained attention — not only for the praise it heaped on Chahal, but also because of ongoing dating rumours linking the RJ and the star spinner.The post added fuel to fan curiosity while celebrating one of the greatest bowling displays of IPL 2025 so far.Playing for Punjab Kings, Chahal turned the tide in the 19th over of the CSK innings at Chepauk.With CSK cruising at 177 for 5 and looking to finish strong, the leg-spinner struck gold, removing MS Dhoni , Deepak Hooda, Anshul Kamboj, and Noor Ahmad in the space of just six balls.He finished with incredible figures of 4 for 32 in just three overs.Dhoni, who had just hit Chahal for a six, was caught trying to clear long-off.Hooda and Kamboj followed in quick succession, both falling cheaply.Chahal sealed his hat-trick with the wicket of Noor Ahmad, joining an elite list of bowlers to take four wickets in a single IPL over.This was Chahal’s second IPL hat-trick and a record-breaking ninth instance of him claiming four or more wickets in an innings, the most in league history.The performance stunned CSK and tilted the momentum completely in Punjab’s favour.","Punjab Kings spinner Yuzvendra Chahal took a hat-trick against Chennai Super Kings.

New Delhi: The Board of Control for Cricket in India ’s ( BCCI ) move to name its AI-driven robot dog ‘ Champak ’ has led to it being dragged to court over alleged trademark infringement issues by a renowned children’s magazine of the same name.The Delhi High Court heard the suit on Wednesday and sought the stand of the cricketing body, even as it declined to issue any interim stay. Justice Saurabh Banerjee observed that “Champak was an existing brand name since eternity” while asking the BCCI to file its written statement in response to the plea within four weeks.Further hearing will be on July 9 on the plea filed by Delhi Press Patra Prakashan Pvt Ltd , which has been publishing ‘Champak’ magazine since 1968.The publisher claimed that the commercial usage of the name amounts to dilution of the publication’s registered trademark and has tarnished its image. However, the court remarked that the publication failed to show the existence of a commercial gain in using the name, as it was adopted after an online poll.During the hearing, the judge also pointed out that even cricketer Virat Kohli’s nickname is ‘Chiku’, which is also one of the popular characters in Champak magazine.Senior advocate J Sai Deepak, who appeared for BCCI, opposed the plea, saying Champak was the name of a flower and people associated the robotic dog with a character of a TV series.",The Delhi High Court heard the suit on Wednesday and sought the stand of the cricketing body.

Young cricketer Suyash Sharma , speaking on RCB Bold Diaries, shared his journey to IPL , including his recovery from a major surgery supported by Royal Challengers Bengaluru, his debut experiences, and his aspirations for the upcoming match against Chennai Super Kings on May 1. The 21-year-old detailed his path from playing under-25 cricket to making it to the IPL, highlighting RCB's role in his medical treatment in London.Sharma expressed gratitude for RCB's support during his recovery from hernia surgery in London, where he received care from team physiotherapist James Pipey.""RCB sent me to London for my surgery. There I met James Pipey (RCB Team Physio). He and his family treated me like family. I had three hernias. To be honest, I didn't expect to play the first match. I was told I would play three or four matches later because it was a big surgery. But Pipey and his family took care of me. I'm very thankful that I'm in this franchise. I'm fit now. I had been suffering from pain for the past two years. I was used to playing in pain. The problem is that if you're playing for India or a franchise, then you can manage. When I wasn't playing, I had this injury, but I didn't even know it. I went to a physiotherapist but it was very difficult. RCB showed me a lot of faith. They invested in me. I'm very happy with my surgery. The path I'm on now, I wasn't on before. Whatever happens, happens for the best.""The young spinner recalled his journey to the IPL, highlighting his persistence through multiple trials and eventual selection.""I had never played in a proper tournament before the IPL. I had only played Under-25. I spent six or seven years in trials but was never picked. Every time I visited my parents, they would ask when I'd get a chance in the IPL. But my mum and dad never doubted me. They could see how hard I was working. After the Under-25s, I went for IPL trials. At that time, my googly was very sharp. I think I took eight wickets out of ten in one match, it was a KKR ( Kolkata Knight Riders ) practice match, and even the wicket-keeper was getting beat. That's when I was picked. My father was in hospital then. He cried when he heard. No one expected me to play IPL so soon.""Sharma shared his experience of making his IPL debut against RCB.Quiz: Who's that IPL player? ""My debut was against RCB. There was a lot of pressure. I had never even been to watch a match before. I'd never seen so many people in a crowd. The atmosphere was crazy. I went straight into the game. Until you actually bowl in a match, you don't know what it's like. I can't describe what I was feeling. My mind was blank. But I tried to do what I had always done. After the first over, everything settled down. I could see the crowd, feel the moment. I always knew I'd play in the IPL, 101 per cent. But I didn't think it would happen this soon. I was 19. I thought I'd debut at 24 or 26. I always believed in myself. When you work hard, God helps you.""He detailed his mental preparation during his recovery period and his approach to bowling.""Before the IPL, I was on bed rest for three months. I only started bowling two weeks before the tournament. But during those three months, I visualised everything. I kept thinking about my bowling all day. I would run affirmations in my head. I'd plan each ball: first I'll bowl like this, then like that. I think all of that really helped. I worked on my run-up too. My run-up is my bowling. If you keep something in your mind long enough, when the time comes to do it, you feel prepared. You just think, 'I've done this before. I'll do it again.' I just had to recreate it in the match.""Sharma acknowledged his family's support, particularly after losing his father to cancer.""My mum was my teacher. My dad had a factory. Two years back, I lost my father. He was suffering from cancer. He passed away in hospital while I was just starting to get noticed. My family has always supported me, whether I played for the state or not. They've been my backbone throughout. They never doubted me, because they saw my hard work every day.""The young cricketer expressed his singular goal for the season: ""I have only one goal that we win this year and lift the cup. This is my only goal right now.""",Suyash Sharma made his IPL debut against Royal Challengers Bengaluru.

The Football Association announced Thursday that transgender women will be banned from playing in women's football teams in England, following a recent UK Supreme Court ruling that defined women as those born biologically female. This decision changes the previous rules that allowed transgender athletes to participate in women's football if they maintained reduced testosterone levels.The Scottish Football Association implemented a similar ban last week, marking a significant shift in UK football policies.The Supreme Court ruling, issued two weeks ago, has broader implications beyond sports. The Equality and Human Rights Commission stated that transgender women would be excluded from women's toilets, hospital wards, and sports teams.The decision has generated mixed reactions, with support from feminist groups and opposition from trans-rights advocates who warn of negative impacts on daily life.""We understand that this will be difficult for people who simply want to play the game they love in the gender by which they identify, and we are contacting the registered transgender women currently playing to explain the changes and how they can continue to stay involved in the game,"" the FA stated.The FA explained that while their policy aimed to make football accessible to everyone, they would make changes based on developments in law, science, or grassroots football operations.Quiz: Who's that IPL player? The new policy will take effect on June 1, though the exact number of players affected remains unclear.The ban comes after England's governing body reviewed its previous policy that allowed transgender women to participate in women's football teams if they demonstrated reduced testosterone levels.","The Football Association announced Thursday that transgender women will be banned from playing in women's football teams in England.

Poll Who was the standout player in the Barcelona vs Inter Milan match? Ferran Torres Denzel Dumfries Marcus Thuram Lamine Yamal

Barcelona and Inter Milan played out an exhilarating 3-3 draw in their Champions League semi-final first leg at Olympic stadium on Wednesday, with 16-year-old Lamine Yamal delivering a standout performance. The match featured six goals, including the fastest-ever Champions League semi-final goal scored by Marcus Thuram after just 30 seconds.Inter Milan took an early lead through Thuram's clever back-heel finish after Inigo Martinez slipped at a crucial moment, allowing the French striker to convert Denzel Dumfries' low cross.Dumfries extended Inter's lead with an acrobatic finish from Francesco Acerbi's headed corner, putting the 2023 runners-up in a commanding position.Yamal, making his 100th appearance for Barcelona, responded with a brilliant solo goal, becoming the youngest player to score in a Champions League semi-final. He dribbled past multiple defenders before placing a perfect shot off the left post.Ferran Torres equalised for Barcelona after 38 minutes, converting Raphinha's header across goal from Pedri's delivery into the area.The second half saw both teams continue their attacking prowess. Dumfries restored Inter's lead with a header that deflected in off Dani Olmo.Barcelona quickly leveled again when Raphinha's powerful shot hit the crossbar and went in off goalkeeper Yann Sommer's head for an own goal.""Letting in that many goals is unacceptable, but we also have to give Inter credit, they did very well. The important thing is we leave with a result where everything can happen,"" said Raphinha.""After three defeats in a row we saw the real Inter tonight, we played with heart and I'm proud,"" Dumfries told Amazon Prime Video.""Yamal is a phenomenon of the kind born every 50 years,"" said impressed Inter coach Simone Inzaghi.Both teams suffered injury setbacks during the match. Barcelona's Jules Kounde left before halftime, while Inter captain Lautaro Martinez also departed due to injury, with Inzaghi expressing doubts about his availability for the return leg.Inter's Henrikh Mkhitaryan had a goal disallowed for a tight offside decision, later saying he would think about it ""maybe for the rest of my life."" Yamal hit the woodwork again as both teams pushed for a winner.""We will have our chance in Milan. This is our goal, we will fight for it,"" said Barcelona coach Hansi Flick.The second leg is scheduled for next Tuesday in Milan, with the winner advancing to face either Paris Saint-Germain or Arsenal in the final at Munich on May 31.","Barcelona and Inter Milan played out an exhilarating 3-3 draw in their Champions League semi-final first leg at Olympic stadium on Wednesday. 16-year-old Lamine Yamal delivered a standout performance.

In a major step to deepen its engagement with Indian fans and support the growth of football across the country, the English Premier League announced the opening of its new office in Mumbai on Wednesday. This marks the latest expansion of the League’s global footprint and its enduring association with India’s burgeoning football community.The Mumbai office aims to bolster the Premier League's efforts to grow the sport at both grassroots and elite levels, while also enhancing connections with fans and stakeholders in the region. The office will serve as a hub for collaboration with local authorities, the Indian Super League (ISL), and governing bodies, helping to further integrate the Premier League’s programs and initiatives within India’s footballing ecosystem.Premier League Chief Executive Richard Masters underscored the importance of this move. “We and our clubs have a fantastic and knowledgeable fanbase in India, and we know football continues to grow in popularity. We are proud of our longstanding commitment to India, having worked to deliver community football programmes for 18 years and, more recently, our partnership with the Indian Super League,” he said. “Opening this office marks a significant milestone for the Premier League. It will allow us to operate more effectively locally as we build on our existing work to establish more ways to strengthen our relationship with fans, JioStar and other partners.”The Premier League’s connection with India began in 2007 through the Premier Skills initiative, in partnership with the British Council. Over the past 18 years, the program has trained more than 7,300 coaches and referees across 18 Indian states, positively impacting over 124,000 young people. At the elite level, the League’s alliance with the ISL since 2014 has resulted in meaningful collaboration in areas such as youth development, coaching standards, and referee training.Additionally, the Next Gen Cup — an elite youth tournament co-hosted with the ISL and Reliance Foundation — continues to foster top-level talent. The sixth edition of the event is set to take place in Mumbai in May 2025, featuring U19 teams from both Premier League clubs and ISL academies.This marks the fourth international office for the Premier League, after successful launches in Singapore (2019), New York (2023), and Beijing (2024), as the League continues to globalise its fan engagement and development initiatives.","The EPL has opened a new office in Mumbai.

Poll Which team do you think has the best chance of reaching the Kalinga Super Cup finals? Mumbai City FC Jamshedpur FC Mohun Bagan Super Giants FC Goa

: Two games won, two more to go.That’s the scenario for Kalinga Super Cup semifinalists, barring Mohun Bagan Super Giants who needed just one win to join the last four, as they look to book a place in the summit clash with another win here on Wednesday.“All four teams have the same target. And we are all in that moment of the competition where every game is very difficult,” India and FC Goa head coach Manolo Marquez said at the pre-match press conference at Kalinga Stadium on Tuesday.Marquez’s Goa will be vying it out with ISL Shield and Cup winners Mohun Bagan in an afternoon fixture and Jamshedpur FC are set to lock horns with Mumbai City FC in the game scheduled for the evening.While the absence of the star foreigners in the ISL champions’ squad makes FC Goa – who dominated Gokulam Kerala in a 3-0 win before edging a valiant Punjab FC 2-1 in the quarterfinal – the favourites in their last-four clash, their Spanish head coach is not ready to pay heed to the statistics.“Mohun Bagan are here with half of the main team squad and the other half were champions of the Reliance Foundation Development League two weeks ago. The game will be very difficult because they have nothing to lose. That is the reality. They have already won two trophies and the slot for the Asian competition,” he added.Led by assistant coach Bastab Roy in absence of Jose Molina, Bagan were devastating in their quarterfinal against Kerala Blasters, with Kerala boys Ashique Kuruniyan and Sahal Abdul Samad combining well while 21-year-old playmaker Salahudheen Adnan K stole the show with his Player of the Match performance.Roy, meanwhile, took the game in the team’s stride and admitted that they have a tough job against Marquez’s Goa.“FC Goa are, without a doubt, a better and a stronger team than Kerala Blasters. So my job is not easy. But my players are focussed and ready. It’s an exposure trip for the young boys and some seniors as well. It's a semifinal and I’ve told my boys to enjoy the game,” was Roy’s comments on Tuesday.Goa, however, have a silver lining even in a semis defeat as AIFF earlier announced they would get the 2025-26 AFC Champions League 2 spot if Bagan go on to clinch the trophy on Saturday.That’s not the case for the other semifinalists with Mumbai City and Jamshedpur both eager to make up for their ISL playoffs disappointments and leave the memories of exiting the Super Cup last time in the last-four stage behind and end this season on a high.“We never think like this (about the previous tournaments). If this is a new challenge, you must think positively and try to get good positive results. We’re playing in the semifinal. It’s an important game. We are playing against a good team and must work hard to get a positive result,” Khalid Jamil said at the pre-match interaction.Jamshedpur, who will hope to be third-time lucky after being ousted twice in the last-four stage, will have the psychological edge having beaten Mumbai City in both legs of the ISL.However, the Red Miners’ defence — led by the in-form Stephen Eze — will have to deal with the Lallianzuala Chhangte threat with the opposition skipper being the standout performer so far with three goals and an assist, including the winner against Inter Kashi in the last eight.But only Wednesday will tell who gets the chance to vie for the trophy on Saturday.",Mohun Bagan Super Giant and FC Goa will go head-to-head in the semifinal of the Kalinga Super Cup on Wednesday.

Liverpool secured their 20th English top-flight title with a stunning 5-1 victory over Tottenham Hotspur at an electrified Anfield on Sunday, sealing a record-equalling crown in emphatic style. The Reds, under manager Arne Slot, left no doubt as they turned an early deficit into a comprehensive win that saw them extend their lead to 15 points over second-placed Arsenal, making their title mathematically unassailable with just four games remaining.The match began with an air of anticipation, as Liverpool fans serenaded their team with the iconic ""You'll Never Walk Alone,"" and their team responded with attacking intent. However, Tottenham briefly threatened to spoil the party when Dominic Solanke powered home a header from a James Maddison corner in the 12th minute. The goal, which initially appeared to be offside, was awarded after VAR's intervention.The setback only seemed to galvanize Liverpool, who quickly leveled through Luis Diaz. The Colombian forward slotted home from close range following a fine cross from Dominik Szoboszlai. The home side then took the lead just minutes later, as Alexis Mac Allister rifled a thunderous shot past Spurs goalkeeper Guglielmo Vicario in the 24th minute.Liverpool were rampant, and after Tottenham's inability to clear their lines, Cody Gakpo seized the opportunity to make it 3-1, firing a low shot into the corner. Spurs, fielding a weakened side due to manager Ange Postecoglou's focus on the Europa League semi-finals, were now on the back foot.As the second half progressed, the Liverpool faithful were craving a goal from their star man, Mohamed Salah. Their wish was granted when Salah collected a pass from Szoboszlai, cut inside, and blasted the ball into the bottom corner, celebrating by taking a selfie with a fan in front of the Kop. The crowd erupted in joyous chants, and the atmosphere at Anfield reached fever pitch.The final goal came when Tottenham defender Destiny Udogie inadvertently turned the ball into his own net, sealing a 5-1 rout and sending the Liverpool fans into a frenzy. As the final whistle blew, Anfield reverberated with deafening cheers, and the celebrations began in full force.Liverpool's triumph marked their 20th league title, bringing them level with Manchester United at the top of the all-time list. It also represented a significant achievement for manager Arne Slot, who has steered the club to glory in his first season after replacing Jurgen Klopp last year.","Liverpool secured their 20th English top-flight title with a stunning 5-1 victory over Tottenham Hotspur at an electrified Anfield on Sunday.

Poll How should AIFF handle the situation moving forward? Consult FIFA for further guidance. Stand by their decision and await CAS verdict. Revoke the trophy award until CAS concludes.

In a controversial move, the All India Football Federation (AIFF) awarded the I-League trophy to Churchill Brothers on Sunday, just hours after the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) had stayed the decision and barred any formal felicitation. The defiant act could invite further scrutiny from global bodies like FIFA and CAS.Deputy secretary general M Satyanarayan handed the trophy to Churchill Brothers at a ceremony in Goa, claiming the AIFF only learned about the CAS order after the presentation. ""I was on a flight to Goa and the AIFF Secretariat was closed on Sunday. I came to know about the order only after giving away the trophy,"" Satyanarayan told PTI.The CAS stay came on an urgent application filed by Inter Kashi, who argued that a pending points dispute could alter the final standings. Inter Kashi president Prithiijit Das asserted, ""The CAS order came around 1:30 pm IST and the mail was marked to AIFF also,"" questioning the federation's explanation.CAS deputy president Elizabeth Steiner had clearly ruled that the AIFF must not declare a winner or hold any ceremony until the arbitration concludes. The respondents, including AIFF and Churchill Brothers, have until April 29 to respond.Defending its move, AIFF later issued a statement, emphasising that the presentation was based on previous Delhi High Court and Appeals Committee rulings and that the federation would comply with CAS' final verdict.Churchill Brothers had provisionally finished atop the I-League standings, but Inter Kashi's challenge over a disputed match result could yet overturn the title race. With the CAS involved, how FIFA and the world body react remains to be seen, especially since sports federations are bound to respect CAS directives.The controversy has cast a shadow over Indian football's governance yet again.","The All India Football Federation (AIFF) awarded the I-League trophy to Churchill Brothers on Sunday, just hours after the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) had stayed the decision.

Poll Which team do you think will win the next Clasico? It's too close to call Barcelona Real Madrid

Real Madrid came into the Copa del Rey final on the back of a horrid month. Defeats against Valencia and over both legs against Arsenal had thrown them out of Champions League and dented La Liga title hopes. Even in the Cup, they needed to claw from 1-3 down to beat Real Sociedad in the semi-final. On the field, it hasn't been smooth sailing by a long shot.Over the last two days, off-the-field antics took a massive hit as well. A club that prides itself on its class and gentlemanliness, showed neither in a haughty display which veered on petulance.At La Cartuja in Sevilla, Real Madrid were outplayed by a superior Barcelona side , losing 3-2 in extra time to lift the Cup for a record-extending 32nd time. It marked a third straight defeat for Real Madrid in Clasicos this season, scoring four and conceding 12. Two of those came in the finals - first in the Spanish Super Cup and now in the Copa. As far as warming up to the big job is concerned, Hansi Flick has done an incredible job. And the job is far from finished, Barcelona remain on course for a treble.Real Madrid, meanwhile, only have the league to play for. And that is hardly an easy passage. The Carlo Ancelotti-managed side are four points behind Barcelona with five matches to go. Winning the Clasico on May 11 is vital to the club's bid to avoid a trophy-less season. If it comes in a season where your arch-rivals win a treble, that is a recipe for disaster.Before all that, though, Real Madrid's conduct pre-and-post the Copa del Rey final has come under intense scrutiny. After the final whistle, Antonio Rudiger , Jude Bellingham and Lucas Vazquez were sent off for protesting amid ugly scenes.Both Bellingham and Rudiger were required to be restrained as they had a pop at the referee. The latter could even cop a lengthy ban for throwing an object at the referee from the sidelines. Questioning the referees had started at an institutional level . For months, Real Madrid TV attacked referees for their decisions and after taking umbrage with a decision in February, the club issued an official statement labelling officiating in the country as ""rigged"" and ""completely discredited"".Furthermore, the club has refused to make players available for pitch-side and mixed zone interactions during the league - a practice followed by every other club. Instead, Real Madrid players have kept their interactions limited to the club's official TV channel.Slamming of the referees and dissection of their decisions continued until it reached boiling point on Friday. In an emotional news conference before the Copa del Rey final, officials for the high-stakes encounter hit back.Referee Ricardo de Burgos Bengoetxea broke down in tears while explaining the impact Real Madrid's attacks have had on his family life and that of other referees.VAR referee Pablo Gonzalez Fuertes, seated alongside him, suggested officials will have to take ""much more serious measures"" while hinting at a possible strike.In response, Real Madrid didn't buckle down. Instead, they went into counter-attack. They pulled out of the scheduled open training session for the media, a press conference, president's traditional dinner and a photo-call.The game went ahead, with the same officials, despite suggestions in the Spanish media that Real Madrid were considering withdrawing. The focus, well and truly, was on the referees.For the most part, the referees did a good job of keeping the game flowing despite 34 fouls being committed by both teams and seven yellow cards being brandished out.Ironically, Barcelona were awarded a penalty in the sixth minute of stoppage time when Raphinha fell under pressure from Raul Asencio. As tension crept up, the cameras panned squarely on the officials, De Burgos Bengoetxea was called to assess the incident by the VAR official. Following a brief look, the decision was overturned.In a game that had 50-50 decisions galore, and players of both sides upset with the referee, Jules Kounde drilled in a low shot past Thibaut Courtois to seal the deal.As Real Madrid looked for yet another miracle, Kylian Mbappe was penalised for a foul, getting his hand in the face of a Barcelona player. That broke all the pent-up frustration for the Real Madrid players.Rudiger, already substituted by then, threw something at the referee and was sent off. It took several players and staff to contain him as a bag of ice burst in his hands - which may well have been his next projectile. After hours to cool down, the German defender has apologised for his behaviour.Bellingham, who had already vented to the officials in the tunnel before, was then sent off, too. As was Vazquez for coming onto the pitch to protest.Ancelotti admitted he had no idea about the last two red cards. A reflection of cluelessness that has plagued the Italian manager this season. The squad has struggled to find the right structure for the team. Since Toni Kroos, Nacho Fernandez and Joselu's departure in the summer, the club hasn't filled in the right replacements.Lamine Yamal's post-match message delivered the zinger. ""They can't handle us this year, we've proven it,"" said the teenager, wearing two pairs of sunglasses, the ice-cool antithesis to Madrid's red-hot rage.","Real Madrid lost 3-2 in extra time to Barcelona in the Copa del Rey final.

Earlier Monaco E-Prix Winners

The stage is set for the Monaco E-Prix, and among the favourites are Mitch Evans , Oliver Rowland, António Félix Da Costa , and Nick Cassidy. With Monaco hosting a double-header for the first time, there are even more opportunities for new names—or different combinations—to climb the podium this weekend. But before that, let’s take a look at the six winners of the Monaco E-Prix so far.Interestingly, since the Monaco E-Prix adopted the full 3.337 km layout at the Circuit de Monaco, no pole-sitter has gone on to win the race.2022: Jaguar’s Mitch Evans started from pole but finished second. Stoffel Vandoorne of Mercedes claimed the win.2023: McLaren’s Jake Hughes took pole but didn’t make the podium. Nick Cassidy of Envision Racing won, followed by Evans in second and Andretti’s Jake Dennis in third.2024: Pascal Wehrlein secured pole for Porsche but also failed to finish on the podium. Jaguar dominated the race, with Evans taking the win and teammate Cassidy finishing second. Stoffel Vandoorne, now with DS Penske, completed the podium in third.The 2021 race was an exception to the recent trend. It was the first time Formula E used the full Monaco layout, and the pole-sitter went on to win the race. That year, António Félix da Costa achieved the double for Techeetah-DS. His recent third-place finish at the Miami E-Prix shows he’s still in strong form with Tag Heuer Porsche. Robin Frijns (Virgin-Audi) finished second in 2021, while Mitch Evans took third that year.Meanwhile, Sébastien Buemi of e.dams Renault remains the only driver to have won the Monaco E-Prix twice—and in consecutive editions. He triumphed in 2015 and 2017, during a period when the race was held biennially. On both occasions, Lucas Di Grassi (ABT Sportsline) finished second. Di Grassi is currently showing strong form again, having secured second place for Lola Yamaha ABT in the recent Miami race. In 2019, it was Jean-Éric Vergne of Techeetah-DS who claimed victory.The official Formula E Instagram handle recently shared a poster featuring the six different winners of the Monaco E-Prix, accompanied by the caption: “Will anybody join the exclusive list of #MonacoEPrix winners?”Also Read: Monaco E-Prix 2025: Formula E set for yet another double-header, here’s all about the most loved race of the year Predicting this weekend’s results, one fan wrote: “Oliver Rowland first, Jake Dennis second, and Pascal Wehrlein in third.” Rowland received plenty of support in the comments, with even the Formula E page noting: “A lot of love for @oliverrowland1 here.”","Mitch Evans, Oliver Rowland, António Félix Da Costa and Nick Cassidy are among the favourites to win this weekend's Monaco E-Prix.

Mahindra Racing is driving at an altogether different speed this season as the Formula E team has already surpassed their Season 10 points total in just five races. There are 11 more rounds to go, with the next in Monaco in May. And with such a wonderful performance this year, the Indian outfit is surely on the way to making history. Mahindra Racing drivers Edoardo Mortara and Nyck De Vries can rightfully take the credit for making the team reach a prominent place in the competition.Mahindra Racing’s achievement was highlighted by Formula E, which shared a post on Instagram to laud the team. The picture of team drivers Edoardo Mortara and Nyck De Vries was captioned: “What a turnaround from @MahindraRacing surpassing their Season 10 points total in the first 5 rounds,” along with clapping emojis.The team was struggling at just 47 points last season, but it has already made 51 points in 5 rounds out of 16 races. As a result, it’s in fifth position in the Teams' Standings this year. While Mortara stands at 8th position in the Drivers' Standings with 27 points, De Vries is at 11th position with 24 points.In its run so far in Formula E’s inaugural season, Mahindra Racing has participated in 136 races, out of which it has won just 5 and clinched 24 podiums. They are yet to win a pole position or a podium this season so far, but it's great going and good results are sure to follow.The current season has seen a lot of ups and downs already. It started on a strong note for the team as Mortara and De Vries managed to take 5th and 6th positions in the season opener Sao Paulo E-Prix, respectively. De Vries slipped to 8th position in the second race in Mexico, whereas Mortara failed to leave an impression. The two bounced back strongly at Jeddah E-Prix Round 1, where De Vries climbed to an impressive 4th position and Mortara finished 7th. But they once again slipped to 10th and 13th positions in Round 2.At the Miami E-Prix this month, Mortara once again bounced back by clenching 5th position, but De Vries finished 11th in the race. Team principal Frederic Bertrand is always seen encouraging the drivers and had written after the impressive Miami E-Prix, “We keep pushing, fighting, improving! Great job @mahindraracing this week-end in Miami!

He also shared a series of candid pictures from the track, including some behind-the-scenes moments — one of which resembled a recent post by F1 driver Alex Albon.Taking to Instagram, Norman Nato posted a few pictures from Italy and wrote a caption summarizing his experience at the 6 Hours of Imola. He wrote: “Difficult weekend in Imola with P10 in race. Still early process with our new team, we keep learning. As always after a difficult one, we gonna analyse and make progress to come back stronger for the next one in Spa @cadillacvseries @jota_sport.”Encouraging him, Cadillac’s official Instagram page commented: “Building and growing,” along with clapping emojis.

With five rounds now complete in the 2024–25 Formula E World Championship, there are still 11 races to go before the season concludes in July. In Miami, it was Tag Heuer Porsche’s Pascal Wehrlein who took the top podium spot. However, despite the win, the German-Mauritian driver currently sits third in the overall drivers' standings.Current driver standings for this seasonLeading the championship is Nissan’s Oliver Rowland with 69 points. Rowland had a tough outing in Miami, finishing 10th and earning just one point. But his overall journey this season has been inspiring—starting the Sao Paulo E-Prix in December with zero points, he bounced back impressively. He clinched victory in the Mexico E-Prix (25 points), finished second in Jeddah Part 1 (18 points), and won Jeddah Part 2 (25 points). Thanks to this strong mid-season performance, his lacklustre Miami result hasn’t dented his lead.In second place is Tag Heuer Porsche’s Antonio Felix da Costa with 54 points. He finished runner-up in both the Sao Paulo and Mexico E-Prix races. While his performance dipped in the Jeddah double-header, he recovered well by finishing third in Miami and collecting 15 crucial points.Close behind is his teammate, Pascal Wehrlein, with 51 points. Wehrlein had a disappointing start in Sao Paulo but bounced back with a third-place finish in Mexico. Although his results in Jeddah were average, his win in Miami has significantly boosted his title hopes. A strong showing in Monaco could push him past Da Costa into second place.Also tied at 51 points is the youngest driver on the grid, Taylor Barnard. He impressed with a third-place finish in Sao Paulo and podiums in both Jeddah races—third in Part 1 and second in Part 2. While he struggled in Mexico and finished among the last in Miami, he remains a strong contender. Just one or two solid races could easily propel him past his more experienced rivals.Also Read: Formula E drivers to watch this season: From Oliver Rowland to Maximilian Günther Further back is Maximilian Günther in fifth place with 37 points, despite winning Jeddah Part 1. Mitch Evans, who kicked off the season with a win in Sao Paulo, currently sits 10th in the standings.

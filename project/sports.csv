Jay Shah’s 2036 Olympic blueprint for India: '8 Medals won’t cut it'

Ace Indian shuttler PV Sindhu ’s impressive run came to a halt on Saturday after she suffered a straight-game defeat to China’s Wang Zhiyi in the women’s singles semifinals of the season-opening Malaysia Open Super 1000.The two-time Olympic medallist struggled to maintain consistency against the world No. 2, committing a series of unforced errors in a 16-21, 15-21 loss. Playing her first tournament since recovering from a foot injury that had sidelined her since October last year, Sindhu also surrendered an 11-6 lead in the second game.The defeat brought an end to India’s campaign in the prestigious tournament.Sindhu started on an aggressive note, taking the fight to her higher-ranked opponent by hitting hard and using her reach to good effect. She unleashed her trademark cross-court smashes to surge to a 5-2 lead before Wang responded with deft touches to draw level through a string of points.A few errors from the Chinese shuttler allowed Sindhu to edge ahead 9-7, but Wang once again clawed back to take a narrow one-point advantage at the mid-game interval as Sindhu faltered at the net.Both players struggled to find length after the restart, with the scores locked at 13-13 and several points squandered at the backcourt.From 15-14, Wang stepped up the pressure with a barrage of attacking shots that cramped Sindhu, mixing them with well-judged lifts that floated just beyond reach.Wang surged to 18-14, dropped a point in a fierce rally, then earned four game points before closing out the opener as Sindhu pushed wide.The second game began with Sindhu falling behind 1-3 after committing two unforced errors, but she quickly regrouped, constructing rallies with authority to move ahead 6-3. Wang narrowed the gap briefly, yet Sindhu dominated the mid-phase by stretching her opponent to the corners with sharp angles, opening up an 11-6 lead at the interval.Wang returned from the break with renewed intent, engaging in brisk rallies, but Sindhu countered with precise net play to stay in front at 13-9. However, Wang mounted another comeback as Sindhu sprayed shots wide and into the net, levelling the score at 13-13 before taking control.A deft exchange at the net gave Wang a 16-13 cushion. Sindhu then missed the backline twice, and a backhand net error handed the Chinese shuttler five match points. The contest ended when Sindhu pushed another shot wide, sealing Wang Zhiyi’s place in the final.","PV Sindhu beaten 16-21, 15-21 by China's Wang Zhiyi in semifinals of Malaysia Open Super 1000.

NEW DELHI: RCB all-rounder Nadine de Klerk on Friday said it would take a few days for the dramatic three-wicket win over defending champions Mumbai Indians in the Women’s Premier League opener to sink in, adding that backing her strengths helped her play a decisive role in the thrilling contest.The South African returned impressive figures of 4/26 to restrict Mumbai Indians to 154 for six and then held her nerve with the bat, scoring an unbeaten 63 off 44 balls under pressure to claim the player-of-the-match award in the last-ball victory.""It is probably going to take a couple of days.

Just sticking to my strengths... sometimes it goes your way, sometimes it does not. On these grounds, on these batting wickets, you just need to cash in.""Speaking about her approach while batting, de Klerk said she wanted to maximise her impact by staying on strike.""Towards the back end, I was thinking of taking a bulk of the strike. Couple of important partnerships.Arundhati (Reddy, 20 runs) batted beautifully. A couple of boundaries (by Prema Rawat - 8 not out) were also very important.""RCB skipper Smriti Mandhana said her side was known for dramatic finishes.""It was a thriller.

Nadine did all the work for us in the batting and bowling department,"" Mandhana said.Mumbai Indians captain Harmanpreet Kaur admitted her bowlers fell short on the day.""We just did not bowl one good ball. This happens. We gave her (de Klerk) chances and sometimes, batters come with strong mindset. We missed those chances.""In WPL, we always get matches like that.

Bangladesh seek T20 WC match shift from India after Mustafizur Rahman's IPL exit

Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel.

Our sports advisor gives a statement that Bangladesh should not go to India. Think about it. This is a World Cup event. This is not the IPL. IPL is a domestic tournament. This is an international World Cup event. You cannot come out with rash statements like this. Syed Ashraful Haque | Ex- BCB & ACC aministrator

You cannot compare India-Pakistan relations with India-Bangladesh. It’s very different. India and Bangladesh are like brothers. It’s very old. India came to play Test matches in Bangladesh. BCCI played a big role in helping us getting the Test status. Syed Ashraful Haque | Ex-BCB & ACC administrator

We have a sports advisor who has never held a cricket bat. He is a teacher and a revolutionary. What does he care about cricket? He is after publicity and he is there only for the next two months Syed Ashraful Haque | Ex-BCB & ACC administrator

Poll Do you agree that political interference in cricket administration is detrimental to the sport? Strongly Agree Somewhat Agree Somewhat Disagree Strongly Disagree

Former Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) general secretary and ex-Asian Cricket Council (ACC) CEO Syed Ashraful Haque has launched a scathing critique of political interference in cricket administration, calling the ongoing controversy involving Mustafizur Rahman and Bangladesh’s participation in the T20 World Cup “ridiculous” and “a parody”.Speaking at length on the debate surrounding Bangladesh’s matches in India and the demand for a hybrid model, Haque said the sport across the subcontinent has been “hijacked by politicians” who neither understand cricket nor its wider implications.“The whole cricket ecosystem in India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, everywhere has been hijacked by politicians. Just think about it. Would this ever have happened if people like Mr Jagmohan Dalmia, Mr IS Bindra, Mr Madhavrao Scindia, Mr NKP Salve or even Mr N Srinivasan were in charge? This would never have happened because they were mature people. They understood the game and they understood the implications,"" Haque tells TimesofIndia.com from Kuala Lumpur.“Now it has been hijacked completely. You have people who have never held a bat. In your case, you have Jay Shah, who has never even held a cricket bat in a competitive match.”He didn't hesitate from questioning the leadership in his country as well.“We have the same thing here. The government is run by people who are not politicians, nor are they experienced in sports.Our sports advisor gives a statement that Bangladesh should not go to India. Think about it. This is a World Cup event. This is not the IPL. IPL is a domestic tournament. This is an international World Cup event. You cannot come out with rash statements like this.”""Instead of Mustafizur, had it been Litton Das or Soumya Sarkar , would they have done the same thing? They wouldn’t.”Calling the controversy politically motivated, Haque said, “It is all cheap religious sentiment that politicians are playing.”Haque argued that solutions have existed in the past.“This is a world event. You want all the countries in the world to play. It has happened in the past as well. Earlier, points were forfeited. Here, the tricky thing is Bangladesh is playing all matches in India. If they were playing half the matches in Sri Lanka or somewhere else, that would have sufficed.”“We could give walkovers in two matches and play the others, like England did, like West Indies did. A lot of teams did that. But now the whole hybrid thing has been done because of security reasons.”Haque described the current scenario as farcical. “If India threatens that Mustafizur is in the team, then he will be there. But our team is captained by Litton Das. Isn’t this a parody?”The veteran administrator blamed election-driven politics for the impasse.“It’s what happens when immature politicians take over. You have elections in West Bengal and Assam, so you play this political card to get votes. And you put an international event of World Cup stature into difficulty.”Haque said shifting matches to Sri Lanka would solve the issue.“If they can move it to Sri Lanka, it’s a win-win situation for everybody. If they can’t, I doubt whether Bangladesh will come to India to play this.”Asked about the financial implications for Bangladesh, if the ICC doesn't listen to BCB's demand and Bangladesh government refuses to send the team to India.“Maybe it will cost us financially. But national pride is much bigger than financial losses.”Drawing a comparison with past crises, Haque recalled the aftermath of the 2008 Mumbai attacks, when he was at helm of ACC.“You cannot compare India-Pakistan relations with India-Bangladesh. It’s very different. India and Bangladesh are like brothers. It’s very old. India came to play Test matches in Bangladesh. BCCI played a big role in helping us getting the Test status.”He added, “The 2008 was much more delicate than this, and we got out of it. We got out of it because we had good, sane people as administrators of all three bodies.”“Now we don’t have that. We have a sports advisor who has never held a cricket bat.

NEW DELHI: The BCCI on Friday said it was not its place to comment on Bangladesh’s participation in the T20 World Cup, stating that the matter falls under the International Cricket Council’s jurisdiction. The clarification came after a review meeting of the board’s Centre of Excellence (CoE) in Bengaluru.Bangladesh have asked the ICC to move their T20 World Cup matches out of India after the BCCI instructed IPL franchise Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) to release Mustafizur Rahman , ""due to the recent developments"".""The meeting was about CoE and other cricketing matters.

The CoE became fully operational in April last year, but several key technical posts remain vacant, including head of education and head of sports science. The meeting was attended by BCCI president Mithun Manhas, vice-president Rajeev Shukla and head of cricket at the CoE, VVS Laxman.""We assessed the vacancies at CoE and decided to go ahead with the recruitment process soon.There is acute shortage of technical personnel worldwide but we are trying to fill the positions at the earliest,"" Saikia was quoted as saying by PTI.Explaining the review, Saikia added: ""We thought it was an appropriate time to review the preparations and activities of CoE.

It's tough to pinpoint the exact reason why a team goes on to win a long tournament like the World Cup. It will almost always be a culmination of many small things working well together for the team to be successful at that level.To win a Cricket World Cup, all your elements — batting, bowling and fielding — need to collectively work well. Consistency in team efforts, along with a few individuals’ standout performances, makes a team the World Champion.But sometimes a decision, technical or tactical, during the buildup to such a mega event turns out to be a trump card for the team, leading them to massive success. One such tactical decision was made by the Sri Lankan side in the lead-up to the 1996 ODI World Cup, co-hosted by India, Pakistan and the island nation.Little did they, or the cricketing world at large, know back then that the decision to promote wicketkeeper-batter Romesh Shantha Kaluwitharana as an opener in the final series before the mega-event would change their fortune in such a quick time.On This Day, thirty years ago — January 9, 1996 — Kaluwitharana batted as an opener against Australia in Melbourne for the first time in his over five-year ODI career. He had a clear mandate — to blast from the get-go — and he did the same in style.Australia had posted 213 for 5 in their 50 overs after electing to bat first at the MCG, with Ricky Ponting top-scoring with 123 off 138 balls. Ponting added a record 159 runs for the fifth wicket with Michael Bevan, who contributed 65 not out off 87 balls.Sri Lanka lost two early wickets and were at 39/2, but Kaluwitharana kept the scoreboard ticking with captain Aravinda de Silva (35) and added 88 runs for the third wicket. Kaluwitharana was the next wicket to fall, scoring a 75-ball 77 laced with 12 fours. Sri Lanka then lost three more wickets quickly, but Roshan Mahanama (51) and Kumar Dharmasena (28) guided the visitors to victory in the day-night encounter by three wickets with 15 balls to spare in the Benson & Hedges World Series, which included West Indies as the third team.Kaluwitharana had a decent run in the series as an opener as he stitched together a string of good scores. Even though he ended the series with a duck in Sydney, his scores read — 77 (75), 20 (27), 50 (54), 74 (68), 13 (9) & 0 (2).That one tactical move on January 9 inadvertently started a pinch-hitting plan for the Lankans. And within ten weeks from that fateful day, despite Kaluwitharana's below-par contributions individually, the impact of attacking from the word go played a big part in bringing the World Cup home for Sri Lanka.Opening with Sanath Jayasuriya, who won the Man of the Series at the World Cup, Kaluwitharana was a menace for new-ball bowlers in that tournament. He started the World Cup with a duck against Zimbabwe in Colombo, but the co-hosts persisted with the opening pinch-hitter in Kaluwitharana.His 1996 World Cup record reads — 20 (16) vs India in Delhi, 33 (18) vs Kenya in Kandy, 8 (3) vs England in Faisalabad, 0 (1) vs India in Kolkata and 6 (13) vs Australia in Lahore. He scored just 73, but it came at a 140.38 strike rate, well before the concept of T20 cricket came into being, and along with Jayasuriya's 221 at a 131.54 strike rate, new-ball bowlers were hit hard by the Lankans.In fact, Sri Lankan batters were trendsetters in that tournament, with De Silva (448 at a 107.69 strike rate) and Arjuna Ranatunga (241 at 114.76 SR) making bowlers search for cover.At a time when a 100 strike rate was a rare commodity, four of Sri Lanka’s top batters were cruising well above it thirty years ago, setting a template widely followed these days even in T20 cricket, especially with powerplay field restrictions.The outcome of the tactical decision was an inadvertent one, but it was a happy move for Sri Lanka and world cricket.","Romesh Shantha Kaluwitharana was promoted as an opener in the final series before the 1996 ODI World Cup.

The incident happened when she was just eight years old, long before she became a World Cup hero for India.Jemimah recalled that she was at a church programme with her cousins. The kids were playing outside an auditorium while the adults were busy inside. Like most children, they were full of energy and mischief.They started playing a game where they threw chappals and crocs at each other for fun.While speaking on Breakfast With Champions, Jemimah explained how things suddenly went wrong.“We were in an auditorium where we had a church program.

""I feel very chaotic on the eye, just spontaneous and can do anything at any moment.""City manager Pep Guardiola has showed a willingness to play more on the counterattack this season in a switch of style and the club's director of football, Hugo Viana, said Semenyo was an ""ideal"" signing.""We are constantly watching players all over the world.

Poll What do you think of Kazuyoshi Miura's decision to play professional football at 58? Inspiring Questionable Unusual but brave

Kazuyoshi Miura is not ready to fade away. At 58, the former Japan international striker has vowed to show he still belongs on the football pitch as he prepares for an extraordinary 41st professional season, extending a career that began nearly four decades ago.Popularly known as “King Kazu,” Miura has joined third-division side Fukushima United on a six-month loan ahead of the new Japanese season, which kicks off in early February. The move brings him back into the J. League structure for the first time in five years and underlines his refusal to let age dictate the end of his playing days.Speaking at his official unveiling in Tokyo on Friday, Miura said he was determined to repay the faith shown in him by his new club. “Strikers can score goals in bunches or they can go through dry spells, and you have to have an image in your mind of scoring goals,” he told reporters. “It’s difficult to put a number on it but I definitely want to score and assist.”Still brimming with ambition, Miura added that he wants to contribute in multiple ways. “I’d like to dribble down the left wing and whip in crosses,” he said, offering a glimpse of the attacking intent that has defined his long career.Miura made his professional debut in 1986 with Brazilian giants Santos and has since played across the globe, turning out for clubs in Italy, Croatia, Australia and Portugal. He was a central figure in popularising football in Japan, particularly after the launch of the professional J. League in 1993.Last season, Miura featured for fourth-tier Atletico Suzuka, making eight appearances without scoring as the club was relegated after finishing second from bottom and losing a playoff. Despite the setback, he remains undeterred.Miura, who earned 89 caps and scored 55 goals for Japan but was famously omitted from their 1998 World Cup squad, summed up his motivation simply: “I just want to be on the pitch, even for just one minute or one second longer.”","Kazuyoshi Miura has joined third-division side Fukushima United on a six-month loan ahead of the new Japanese season, which kicks off in early February.

Arsenal winger Gabriel Martinelli has issued a public apology to Liverpool defender Conor Bradley after a controversial late incident marred the goalless Premier League draw at the Emirates, drawing fierce criticism from pundits and rival players alike.The flashpoint occurred deep into stoppage time when Bradley went down near the touchline after landing awkwardly while making a clearance. As the Liverpool defender lay in visible pain, Martinelli attempted to hurry the restart by dropping the ball on him and then shoving him off the pitch. Bradley eventually left the stadium on crutches with his knee strapped, raising fears of a serious injury.The Brazilian winger was shown a yellow card, but some former players felt the punishment was lenient. On Sky Sports, Roy Keane branded Martinelli's conduct “a disgrace,” while Gary Neville described it as “absolutely disgraceful,” reflecting the widespread backlash that followed the final whistle.Responding to the criticism, Martinelli took to Instagram to offer a heartfelt apology, revealing he had already contacted Bradley directly.“Conor and I have messaged and I've already apologised to him,” Martinelli wrote. “I really didn't understand he was seriously injured in the heat of the moment. I want to say I'm deeply sorry for reacting. Sending Conor all my best again for a quick recovery.”Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta came out in defence of his player, insisting there was no malicious intent. “Knowing Gabi, there's zero intention,” Arteta said. “Probably he doesn't know [Bradley is injured]. He's an incredible, lovely guy and would never do that if he knew the situation.”Liverpool boss Arne Slot echoed that view while expressing concern over Bradley's condition. “Let's hope for the best, but I fear the worst for Conor Bradley,” Slot said. “You cannot expect Martinelli to think so clearly in the 94th minute. I'm 100 percent sure that if he knew what the injury might be, he would never do that.”However, Slot also admitted his discomfort at seeing an injured player being moved. “I didn't like to see one of my players being moved out of the pitch if he might have such a big injury,” he added.The match itself ended 0-0, marking Arsenal's first home blank of the season but still extending their lead at the top of the table to six points over Manchester City.","Gabriel Martinelli has issued a public apology to Liverpool defender Conor Bradley after a controversial late incident.

New Delhi: Bengaluru FC owner Parth Jindal on Wednesday called on the players to ""make sacrifices"" in view of the ""financial burden"" the club will shoulder to participate in the delayed Indian Super League (ISL) next month, saying without their support, the club may have to ""shut shop for good"".All India Football Federation's (AIFF) bid to rope in a new commercial partner did not find any takers after the Master Rights Agreement (MRA) with the ISL organisers, the Reliance-owned FSDL, ended on December 8 last year.Though Sports Minister Mansukh Mandaviya on Tuesday announced that the delayed and truncated 2025-26 ISL season will begin on February 14 with all the 14 clubs participating in it, the franchises will struggle financially if the top-tier tournament does not get a commercial partner soon.The AIFF is expected to float another tender soon for a commercial partner.Jindal did not specifically explain the kind of sacrifice the footballers will be expected to make, but it could well be a reduced salary for this season. The club features, among others, former India captain Sunil Chhetri and star goalkeeper Gurpreet Singh Sandhu.The ISL clubs are required to share 60 per cent of the financial cost (around Rs one crore per club) for the league to start after a nearly six months long pause.The total cost for the upcoming season has been pegged at Rs 25 crore by the AIFF.""Tremendous sacrifice from all clubs is being asked for to play the ISL in its current format. Repercussions if we don't have a league are very worrying,"" Jindal wrote on 'X'.""Truly hope the players understand the additional financial burden on the clubs and agree to also sacrifice as we are all in this together. We are in this for the love of football and to see our country play the beautiful game and be good at it.""He admitted that Bengaluru FC has been a loss-making franchise since joining the ISL and said the club may have to wind up its operations if players do not cooperate.""@bengalurufc football has been a loss making proposition for all since I can remember - this year's numbers without the players helping out will force many to shut shop for good,"" he said in the tweet which was reposted by FC Goa CEO Ravi Puskur.Jindal also thanked Mandaviya ""for his intervention and his proposal"", which led to the ending of a crisis that paralysed Indian football.Earlier on Friday, leading names such as Sunil Chhetri, along with several foreign recruits of the ISL, had called for world governing body FIFA's intervention to rescue the ISL.Chhetri, Gurpreet Singh Sandhu and Sandhesh Jhingan voiced concern over the prolonged uncertainty, warning that Indian football would be slipping into a state of ""permanent paralysis"".On Tuesday, Mandaviya announced that the ISL will have 91 matches on home and away basis, the logistics of which are still being worked out.AIFF President Kalyan Chaubey, who took over the explaining part after the Minister's announcement, said a Rs 25 crore central pool has been made for only the conduct of the ISL.""Ten percent of this fund will come from AIFF, 30 percent was to come from a commercial partner but since we don't have one right now, the AIFF will pitch in with that contribution,"" Chaubey had said.""In all, the AIFF will give Rs 14 crore for ISL and about Rs 3.2 crore for I League till we find a commercial partner.

Poll Do you agree with the decision to change the ISL format to a single leg home and away structure? Yes, it's a good change. No, I preferred the previous format. Undecided.

PANAJI: The sports ministry and the All India Football Federation (AIFF) turned the tables on top-tier clubs during a joint meeting in the Capital on Tuesday, leaving them with no choice but agree to take part in this edition of the Indian Super League (ISL).Sports minister Mansukh Mandaviya later announced that the ISL will kick off on Feb 14 with all 14 teams taking part. When clubs headed to the Capital at short notice — summoned individually through a phone call late on Monday night by AIFF deputy secretary general M Satyanarayan — they were expecting to hear the proposal, return home, study and then consult owners. Instead, they were told time was running out and they had to say “yes or no” on Tuesday itself.“We had no choice to decide whether the (short-term) proposal makes sense,” said one club official who had to hurriedly call the club owner and inform him of the latest developments.Consistent in their stand that they are taking part in the top league, whatever the format and financial implications, Jamshedpur FC were the first to provide an email confirmation, followed by the likes of Punjab FC, East Bengal, NorthEast United, Mohammedan Sporting and Inter Kashi.Later, Delhi SC, Bengaluru FC and Mohun Bagan Super Giant came on board. Five clubs — Kerala Blasters, Chennaiyin FC, Mumbai City, FC Goa and Odisha FC — needed time to speak with their owners and reluctantly agreed. ISL clubs were also taken aback with the change in format.While most were in favour of a single-leg centralised format, AIFF proposed a single leg home and away structure for the current season, estimated to cost Rs24.3 crore. AIFF said a single leg centralised format will cost Rs 38 crore, adding to the cost.The ISL will have a total of 91 matches with all 14 teams playing each other once. Clubs have to pay Rs 1 crore each as franchise fee. As per the constitution, the top league will have principles of promotion and relegation, but AIFF is likely to approach the Supreme Court for a one-year relaxation, given that it will be a truncated league. Talking to the media, sports minister Mansukh Mandaviya said: “Today the govt, football federation and 14 clubs had a meeting and we have decided that ISL will start Feb 14 on Saturday. All 14 clubs will participate.”“Similarly, the I-League will be held around the same time with all 11 clubs participating. The leagues will finally happen,” he added.Mandaviya was joined by the beleaguered AIFF president Kalyan Chaubey, who explained the financial and logistical aspects of both leagues. “A Rs 25 crore central pool has been made only for the conduct of the ISL. 10 percent of this fund will come from AIFF, 50% from clubs and 10% from legacy partners (clubs). Another 30% was to come from a commercial partner but since we don’t have one right now, the AIFF will pitch in with that contribution for this season,” Chaubey said.","Sports minister Mansukh Mandaviya announced that the ISL will kick off on Feb 14 with all 14 teams taking part.

Usman Khawaja's retirement speech: 'I want the journey for the next Usman Khawaja to be easier'

- Full-time job? -

LONDON: Manchester United interim boss Darren Fletcher said Tuesday that leading the club was beyond his ""wildest dreams"" but insisted he has not considered replacing the sacked Ruben Amorim. The Portuguese manager was axed on Monday after a turbulent 14 months at Old Trafford, with former United midfielder Fletcher put in temporary charge.The under-18s coach faced the press for the first time on the eve of his team's match at Burnley.""It's surreal,"" said Fletcher, who made 342 appearances for the Red Devils and has worked in a variety of different roles for them since 2020, including as technical director.""It's an amazing honour to be able to lead a Manchester United team,"" he said. ""I don't even think it was in my wildest dreams that that was something that could potentially happen, even thinking about playing for the club and stuff like that.""But to lead out the team is an amazing honour and something I am really proud to do.""It's not (happened) in the circumstances that I expected it to happen so that obviously is something that doesn't sit quite easy with me, but I just have to think I've got a job to do and I've got to lead the team tomorrow and think of the great honour and pride in doing that.""The former Scotland international is expected to remain in place until the club appoints a caretaker boss, with United planning to name Amorim's permanent successor at the end of the season.The BBC reported that the club had held preliminary talks with Fletcher, Michael Carrick and former boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, all ex-United players, about the position of caretaker.But Fletcher, 41, said at his pre-match press conference that conversations with United's hierarchy had focused on Wednesday's game and they would talk again after the match.Fletcher was asked whether he wanted to try to earn the manager's job on a full-time basis.""Honestly it's not something I've thought about,"" he said. ""I'm focusing on Burnley. I think that discussion is for after the game.""There has been that much going on and it has all happened so quickly that all my concentration, efforts and thoughts have gone into Burnley.""Fletcher won five Premier League titles under the management of Alex Ferguson but the club have not been English champions since 2013.""Everyone expects Manchester United to be on the top and winning, that's the standard, that's what we all have to try and achieve,"" said a bullish Fletcher.He was asked what his United team would look like.""Hopefully it looks like a Manchester United team that represents a bit of me, I think in terms of what I know is Manchester United,"" he said.""So I hope it resembles a Manchester United team that fans can be proud of, that I can be proud of, and I'm sure they will because I believe in the players.""I think we've got good players and I think we've got players who care and I think we've got a lot of quality in that team and I hope to give them a platform to go out there to express themselves.""Fletcher said he hoped to welcome back captain Bruno Fernandes and Mason Mount into a squad badly depleted by injuries and international commitments.He joked that he refused to disclose sensitive information when asked whether his twin sons, Jack and Tyler, would be given full debuts against Burnley.United are sixth in the Premier League table, three points behind fourth-placed Liverpool.","Darren Fletcher says leading Manchester United is beyond his ""wildest dreams"" Fletcher says he has not considered replacing the sacked Ruben Amorim.

Chelsea have confirmed Liam Rosenior as their new manager, signing the 41-year-old on a six-year contract until 2032 after he left French side Strasbourg on Tuesday. Rosenior, known for his attack-minded approach, becomes only the second Black manager in Chelsea’s history, following Ruud Gullit.Rosenior earned praise for transforming Strasbourg into a competitive Ligue 1 side, guiding them to a seventh-place finish last season and European qualification. “Liam has shown that he can build teams with a clear way of playing while setting the highest standards with players on and off the pitch. While there will continue to be a focus on player development, the club’s expectations and ambitions remain high,” Chelsea said in their announcement.Before Strasbourg, Rosenior had a stint as assistant coach at Derby under Wayne Rooney, who commended his “incredible” work ethic and attention to detail. Despite his success in France, Rosenior has never managed a Premier League side. He succeeds Enzo Maresca, who left after 18 months at the helm.Chelsea, currently fifth in the league and 17 points behind leaders Arsenal, offer Rosenior a higher-profile and more pressurised stage.Reflecting on the opportunity, Rosenior said: “I am excited to work with this extremely talented group of players and staff, to build strong connections on and off the pitch, and to create an environment where everyone feels united and driven by the same goal.”The move also carries personal significance. Rosenior added: “This opportunity for me is something I can’t turn down at this moment in my life… It means that I can go home and see my kids. I’m away from my children, I missed them. And I wanted to make the sacrifice of not seeing them worth it, with the success that we have here.”Son of former player and coach Leroy Rosenior, Liam had a 16-year professional playing career in England, representing Fulham, Reading, Hull, Brighton, and England Under-21s. He returned to Hull as his first head coach in 2022 before joining Strasbourg in 2024, leaving the French club with European football secured and a spot in the knockout phase of the UEFA Conference League.Rosenior defended his decision to move to Chelsea, stating: “I don’t think anyone can question how hard I’ve worked for the club, my integrity in the way I’ve worked for this club. I don’t think anyone can question the decision I’ve made to move on with my career.”This appointment marks a rare top-level opportunity for a Black British coach in the Premier League, and Chelsea will hope Rosenior can bring stability and consistency to a side that has seen five permanent managers since the BlueCo takeover in 2022.","Chelsea confirm Liam Rosenior as their new manager. The 41-year-old has signed a six-year contract. Rosenior succeeds Enzo Maresca, who left after 18 months at the helm.

Andy Reid breaks silence on 2026 exit rumors as Chiefs brace for major coaching turnover,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/andy-reid-breaks-silence-on-2026-exit-rumors-as-chiefs-brace-for-major-coaching-turnover/articleshow/126446584.cms,"Andy Reid breaks silence on 2026 exit rumors as Chiefs brace for major coaching turnover(Getty Image)

Andy Reid explains why the Chiefs must change despite winning close games

Speculation around Andy Reid’s future followed the Kansas City Chiefs through the final weeks of the season. Another year defined by close games and late pressure sparked questions about how long the veteran coach plans to stay on the sideline. By early January 2026, talk of a possible exit before the 2026 season had spread across the league.Andy Reid addressed those rumors directly. Speaking during his end-of-season media availability at the Chiefs’ practice facility in Kansas City, Reid made his stance clear. He is not leaving. But he also made it clear that the Chiefs cannot rely on narrow wins moving forward.Andy Reid said the 2025 season came down to fine margins that cannot be ignored. During his January 9 press conference, he pointed out that Kansas City played ten games decided by seven points or fewer. While the team won most of them, Reid said that approach is not sustainable.“We had ten or so games that were determined by seven points or less,” Reid said during his season-ending press conference on January 9. “You’ve got to go back and look at penalties and turnovers in crucial situations.”The star-HC said those mistakes showed up in dropped passes, stalled drives, and missed chances late in games.He stressed that accountability applies to everyone, including quarterback Patrick Mahomes. According to Reid, understanding why those moments happened matters more than celebrating survival wins.At the same time, Reid confirmed that change around him is expected. Offensive coordinator Matt Nagy has drawn interest from multiple teams, including the Tennessee Titans, Baltimore Ravens, and Arizona Cardinals. Defensive coordinator Steve Spagnuolo is also being considered for head coaching roles, with Tennessee viewed as a serious option.Kansas City has already started adjusting its staff. As of January 2026, wide receivers coach Connor Embree, defensive line coach Alex Whittingham, and defensive quality control coach Louie Addazio are no longer with the organization.Andy Reid’s future in Kansas City is settled, but the road ahead is not static. The coach is staying, the expectations remain high, and the margins are shrinking. For the Chiefs, fixing the details may decide whether another Super Bowl run stays alive or slips away.Also Read: Why the Chiefs fear losing Travis Kelce for reasons that have nothing to do with football","Andy Reid said the 2025 season came down to fine margins that cannot be ignored.

Patrick Mahomes’ recovery and return timeline



Patrick Mahomes’ Kansas City Chiefs No. 15 jersey sales have taken a surprising hit, reflecting a challenging season for the three-time Super Bowl champion. Once sitting at No. 2 in 2024, just behind Saquon Barkley, Mahomes has now fallen to No. 22 in 2025, according to NFL Shop’s latest rankings. This drop highlights how on-field performance and public perception can directly influence a star athlete’s merchandise popularity. Fans have taken notice of a season that didn’t go as planned for the Chiefs and their star quarterback.The decline comes after a string of setbacks for Mahomes. In February, he and the Chiefs were soundly defeated by Barkley and the Eagles in the 2025 Super Bowl. Hoping to bounce back the following season, Mahomes faced another blow: the Chiefs missed the playoffs due to an uneven record, and in a critical final game, he suffered a torn ACL. The injury required immediate surgery, leaving fans anxious about his return. Mahomes shared a mix of emotions on Instagram, posting a photo walking off the field with his helmet down, followed by another of him celebrating a touchdown in the end zone, hinting at both his struggles and determination.Despite the injury, optimism surrounds Mahomes’ comeback. Chiefs vice president of sports medicine and performance Rick Burkholder told reporters that Mahomes’ recovery “ballpark” is roughly nine months, potentially allowing him to return for Week 1 of the 2026 NFL season. Burkholder emphasized, ""Every player is different. Every sport is different. Every position is different,"" adding that Mahomes “is so in tune to what he does, he does it a little quicker. ”In the meantime, NFL fans have shifted their attention to other stars. Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen has climbed to the No. 1 jersey spot, while Patriots’ Drake Maye now sits at No. 2. Other top sellers include Fred Warner, Jaxon Smith-Njigba, and CeeDee Lamb. Mahomes’ slide serves as a reminder that even elite athletes are not immune to fluctuations in popularity, particularly when injuries and team struggles dominate headlines. Yet with rehab underway, all eyes are on the quarterback’s potential triumphant return next season.Also Read: Why Travis Kelce couldn’t comfort Taylor Swift as panic erupted during the shocking Chiefs Super Bowl parade shooting","Patrick Mahomes' No. 15 jersey sales have taken a surprising hit, reflecting a challenging season.

Drake Maye faces defining playoff moment against Justin Herbert as Patriots welcome Chargers



Drake Maye's playoff debut has arrived faster than anyone in New England expected, and it has changed the tone of January football in Foxborough. One year removed from a rebuilding season, the Patriots are back on the postseason stage, led by a 23 year old quarterback who plays with calm purpose. Sunday night brings a charged matchup, not just between teams, but between belief and proof, as New England hosts the Los Angeles Chargers with everything at stake.The rise has been steep, but the approach has stayed steady. Maye enters the playoffs as an MVP candidate without carrying the weight of the moment on his shoulders. The record says 14 wins. The setting says prime time. Yet the quarterback’s focus remains narrow and personal, rooted in execution rather than expectation.“I’ve got to play well for us to win,” Maye said. “I know that’s the nature of this league and the nature of the position. I wouldn’t want to have it any other way.”Those around Maye sense no hesitation. Stefon Diggs, a veteran who has seen playoff pressure from every angle, expects more of the same. “I expect to see the same player, if not him doing more,” Diggs said. “Whatever duty calls, or whatever the job calls for, he’s been consistent.I’m excited for Drake, though. Another stage for him to shine.”History also sits quietly in the background. New England has not won a home playoff game since the 2018 run that ended with a Super Bowl title, a journey that opened with a win over the Chargers. First year coach Mike Vrabel has no interest in nostalgia. “We’re not here just to get here,” he said. “We have to be able to host games and compete for championships. There’s not going to be any consolation prize for anybody. We understand what we have to do. ”Across the field, urgency defines Los Angeles. Justin Herbert is chasing his first postseason win while managing a recently repaired left hand. Rest helped, but results will matter more. “Experience is a good thing,” Herbert said. “I think you learn from what you did right, what you did wrong.”The chess match will unfold deep downfield, where strength meets resistance. Maye thrives on explosive throws, while the Chargers allow fewer air yards than any playoff team. Patriots coordinator Josh McDaniels expects complexity. “There’s a few plays where they’re going to be as complicated as you’ve seen all year,” he said.Maye remains unfazed. “I think from an attacking standpoint, if there’s any coverage, there’s always a void,” he said.New England’s perfect road record and strong home scoring margin suggest balance, not comfort. As Vrabel put it, “It’s just got to be a tough place to play in January.”Also Read: Giants QB Jaxson Dart and Marissa Ayers go Instagram official with viral three-word post",Drake Maye faces defining playoff moment against Justin Herbert as Patriots welcome Chargers to Foxborough.

Turning Point USA Super Bowl halftime show takes shape behind closed doors



Turning Point USA own Super Bowl halftime show (X / @TPUSA)

Turning Point USA Super Bowl halftime show plans are moving forward, even as the organization chooses secrecy over spectacle for now. As the NFL prepares for its biggest night, the conservative nonprofit is quietly building an alternative stage that promises surprise, scale, and a distinctly different cultural tone.The idea surfaced months ago, but interest has sharpened as details remain scarce. While the official Super Bowl LX halftime show is locked in with Bad Bunny as the headliner, Turning Point USA is betting that mystery itself can generate momentum. The group is positioning its event as a parallel experience, one designed to speak directly to its base while inviting curious viewers to tune in live.Aubrey Laitsch, the organization’s public relations manager, confirmed that the project is not symbolic or tentative. She told TMZ, ""The All American Halftime Show"" is 100 percent on -- though fans will have to tune in live on Sunday, Feb. 8 to find out who’s taking the stage. According to Laitsch, multiple performers are already confirmed, but she declined to offer hints about names, genres, or even the location. She also would not say whether the show will be broadcast live, adding another layer of intrigue.Turning Point USA, co founded by Charlie Kirk , first announced the concept in October after conservative voices criticized the NFL’s choice of Bad Bunny.At the time, the group teased, ""Performers and event details coming soon"", a promise that has stretched longer than expected. Even now, its website keeps the conversation open ended, asking supporters, “What music genres would you like to see featured?” Options range from country and rock to hip hop and “anything in English. ”That open call reflects both caution and ambition. The group appears to be testing audience appetite while holding its cards close. Recent history suggests the guest list could surprise skeptics. Just last month, Nicki Minaj shared a stage with Erika Kirk at a Turning Point USA event, a reminder that the organization can draw high profile names when it chooses.The broader backdrop adds fuel to the moment. Bad Bunny, a global star from Puerto Rico, has said he will not tour in the U.S. for fear his concerts will be targeted by federal immigration authorities amid the president’s widespread deportation efforts. Against that tension, Turning Point USA is framing its halftime show as more than counterprogramming.Also Read: Giants QB Jaxson Dart and Marissa Ayers go Instagram official with viral three-word post","Conservative nonprofit Turning Point USA is planning its own Super Bowl halftime show.

Jaxson Dart's girlfriend Marissa Ayers steps into the spotlight



Jaxson Dart's girlfriend news no longer lives in the rumor mill. It has stepped into the open with a quiet confidence that matches the Giants quarterback’s steady rise in the NFL. After weeks of subtle clues and fan speculation, the moment arrived the way modern relationships often do. It came through a simple Instagram post that spoke louder than any press release.For a player still carving his identity in New York, the timing felt natural. Dart just wrapped a demanding rookie season, while the attention around his personal life had grown louder by the week. When the confirmation finally landed, it did not feel forced or flashy. It felt earned, much like his place under center.The confirmation came from Marissa Ayers herself, a model, influencer, and University of Alabama graduate who has been orbiting the NFL world for months. Her Instagram post ended the guessing game with three carefully chosen words. “rumor has it… @jaxsondart.” The caption nodded to the online chatter while confirming what many already suspected.Ayers is far from new to the public eye. She recently worked as a ring girl during the Jake Paul vs. Anthony Joshua fight in Miami Gardens, adding to a growing résumé that blends sports, fashion, and digital influence. Her following, nearing two million across platforms, reflects a presence built on lifestyle content and behind the scenes moments rather than controversy.The signs had been there long before the post. Ayers appeared at multiple Giants games, including a December matchup in Foxborough, where she posed for photos alongside Dart’s mother. Fans noticed her oversized Giants shirt in a New York City vlog, a small detail that fueled bigger conversations. The pair were also seen together at a Halloween party and later at the Fiesta Bowl, supporting Dart’s Ole Miss roots.Dart’s focus, meanwhile, never wavered. The rookie quarterback threw for 2,275 yards with 15 touchdowns, added nine scores on the ground, and showed toughness behind an injury hit roster. While the Giants’ season fell short in the standings, Dart’s performance gave the franchise optimism.Making the relationship public did not shift that narrative. Instead, it humanized it. In a league defined by pressure and scrutiny, Dart and Ayers chose simplicity over spectacle. Sometimes, that is all it takes to make news feel real.Also Read: Drake Maye’s wife goes from TikTok baker to NBC Sports spotlight after viral “Bakemas” success","Giants quarterback Jaxson Dart's girlfriend Marissa Ayers confirmed their relationship on Instagram.

Calvin Johnson confirms Travis Kelce ’s NFL marijuana claim

Calvin Johnson: 2025 Lions Recap, Why Matt Stafford is MVP and His Record That'll Never Be Broken

The conversation around cannabis use in the NFL is no longer whispered in locker rooms. It is being spoken out loud by some of the league’s most respected voices. When players with Hall of Fame credibility speak openly, it forces fans, teams, and the league itself to listen differently.That shift became louder after a former Detroit Lions legend added weight to comments previously made by a Kansas City Chiefs star. What once sounded controversial now feels closer to confirmation, revealing how pain, pressure, and performance often collide on Sundays.Calvin Johnson, widely known as one of the most dominant receivers in league history, recently offered a rare window into the physical toll of professional football. Appearing on the St. Brown Podcast, the Pro Football Hall of Famer did not glamorize his admission. Instead, he framed it as survival. Johnson acknowledged using marijuana late in his career while navigating injuries that made simply lining up feel overwhelming.Johnson explained that his choice came from desperation, not recreation. “Yeah. You can only be so faded, though,” he admitted. He later clarified the timing of those moments, saying, “I didn't do it until towards the end of my career because I was at this point where I was like, 'Man, I don't know how the hell I'm going to get through this game today.'”Before kickoff, he recalled a quiet internal struggle. “Lord, help me guide my feet.” Then came the decision point. “You know what? F*ck it, I'm going to spark this thing up.”Johnson emphasized that it was rare, but memorable. “I probably did it a handful of times throughout my career. The funny thing is, more times than not, I had a good game too. I never had a bad game.”His words echo comments made earlier by Travis Kelce, who estimated that between 50 percent and 80 percent of NFL players use marijuana. At the time of Johnson’s career, the league enforced strict penalties. Today, the NFL’s stance has softened as research around pain management and recovery grows.Johnson’s admission does not glorify cannabis. It highlights reality.

Her blunt reaction sparked a heated online debate over modern tipping culture, with fans split between support and criticism. The moment highlighted growing frustration over digital gratuity requests beyond traditional service settings.

Randi Mahomes’ fast-food tipping frustration turns into internet firestorm

The Mahomes name usually trends for touchdowns and trophies, not touch screens and tipping screens. Yet one ordinary fast-food stop pulled Randi Mahomes into a national conversation that had nothing to do with football. The moment struck a nerve because it felt familiar, awkward, and quietly frustrating in a way many Americans instantly recognized.What made the post resonate was its simplicity. No agenda. No branding. Just a parent, a child, and a question that seemed to sum up modern consumer confusion. In an era where every screen asks for something extra, her reaction felt refreshingly unfiltered.Randi’s post came during a casual outing with her daughter Mia, the younger half-sister of Patrick Mahomes . While ordering food at a self-service kiosk, she was prompted to select a tip percentage. The request caught her off guard, and she shared that disbelief online.""Mia [daughter] and I ordered fast food from a kiosk and it asked what percentage I wanted to tip... seriously??""The comment spread quickly, drawing both agreement and debate. Many users echoed her frustration, questioning where tips go when no direct service interaction exists. Others argued that tipping culture has shifted and that digital prompts are now standard, even if uncomfortable.The timing added context. Randi was in a transitional phase, stepping away from her long career at Hollytree Country Club in Tyler, Texas, and focusing on personal ventures. Just days earlier, she had launched her GameDay Couture fashion collaboration, calling it a long-held dream. She was also expanding The Sports Parent Academy, a platform designed to support families raising young athletes.Despite those milestones, it was the kiosk moment that traveled furthest. Perhaps because it cut through celebrity distance. Randi Mahomes was not speaking as the mother of a Super Bowl star, but as a customer puzzled by a screen.As Kansas City Chiefs prepared for another stretch of football, her post offered a throwback reminder. Even families used to the spotlight still stumble over the same everyday moments. Sometimes, the most viral stories come not from stadiums, but from checkout screens asking one question too many.Also Read: Brittany Mahomes’ message to Patrick Mahomes' mom Randi catches attention during Chiefs downfall",Randi Mahomes went viral after questioning a tipping prompt at a fast-food self- service kiosk while dining with her daughter.

The decision sparked online backlash, superstition-driven outrage, and heated debate as Allen prepares for a career-defining road test against the Jacksonville Jaguars.

Hailee Steinfeld ’s Hollywood spotlight collides with Josh Allen’s playoff moment

January pressure arrives fast in Buffalo, and this one feels heavier than most. A road playoff game. Old ghosts. A quarterback chasing a breakthrough that has eluded both him and the franchise for decades. As the Buffalo Bills prepare for a win or go home showdown in Jacksonville, the spotlight is fixed firmly on Josh Allen and what Sunday might finally represent.Away from the field, another moment is unfolding just as publicly. While Allen locks in on football, his wife Hailee Steinfeld is stepping onto one of Hollywood’s biggest stages. The timing has sparked conversation, emotion, and debate, blending sports tension with awards season glare.The Golden Globes confirmed Steinfeld as a presenter this year, placing her in Los Angeles on the same day Allen faces the Jacksonville Jaguars. Fans reacted instantly. Some joked. Others worried. One comment read, “This Sunday? So she won’t be….?”Another added, “lying in from Jacksonville? With Josh after we clobber the jags ?” A more anxious supporter wrote, “She’s deciding to present at Golden Globes over watching her husband compete in the playoffs.This feels like a bad omen.”Steinfeld’s absence from the stands is not about priorities. Presenters rehearse days in advance. The commitment was locked in long before playoff paths became clear. Her career moment arrives as Allen’s does, just in a different city.The balance between football and film has long defined their relationship. Allen has never hidden his pride in Steinfeld’s work, especially her recent film Sinners. During an appearance on HBO’s Hard Knocks, his admiration was unmistakable.“Because it combines a lot of different aspects of life,” Allen said. “My wife absolutely kills it, and hopefully, award season coming around, people make the right decision.”He later admitted the movie hit him emotionally. “I was just so proud of her,” Allen explained. “I get emotional thinking about it, but it was a pretty cool experience.”Sunday brings separation by distance, not by support. Allen chases history in Jacksonville. Steinfeld represents her film on a global stage. Different spotlights. Same pressure. Same belief.Also Read: “Baby ….”: Hailee Steinfeld quietly hints at her and Josh Allen’s baby name while celebrating the New Year","Buffalo Bills fans slammed Hailee Steinfeld after she committed to presenting at the Golden Globes instead of attending Josh Allen's crucial playoff game.

What Sean McVay’s net worth is estimated to be in 2025

Sean McVay’s Rams contract and salary explained

Coaches’ private assets, investments, and other sources of income are not publicly disclosed.







Estimates often rely on publicly available salary information and reported contracts.







Year-to-year changes in bonuses, salary, and other earnings can affect total net worth.







Sean McVay has become one of the most recognized coaches in the NFL, and his financial success has grown alongside his on-field achievements. As of 2025, multiple sources estimate McVay’s net worth to be around $40 million, making him one of the league’s wealthiest coaches. While these figures are not officially confirmed, they are based on public information, including salary reports and contract details.Financial and sports publications consistently place McVay’s net worth near $40 million. Some sources list slightly lower figures, around $30 million, but the consensus is that his earnings from coaching, bonuses, and other ventures have built a substantial fortune. These estimates reflect McVay’s success with the Los Angeles Rams and his status as one of the NFL’s highest-paid coaches.It’s important to note that net worth figures are estimates, and actual amounts can vary depending on taxes, investments, and private financial holdings.The bulk of McVay’s wealth comes from his NFL salary and contract with the Rams. Beyond his coaching salary, performance bonuses tied to team success and other potential media or endorsement deals contribute to his earnings. While endorsements are not widely reported, any additional income would be secondary to his coaching contracts.McVay’s current contract with the Rams reportedly pays him around $15 million per year, making him one of the top-paid coaches in the league. His multi-year extension through the 2026 season ensures that he continues to earn at this level, with bonuses possible for playoff success and team achievements.For context, this salary is comparable to other elite NFL head coaches, reflecting both his accomplishments and the Rams’ commitment to keeping him long-term.Net worth estimates for NFL coaches can differ due to several factors:Because of these variables, any figure should be treated as a reasonable approximation, not an exact total.Sean McVay’s reported net worth highlights his position as one of the NFL’s highest-earning and most influential coaches.

J.J. Watt reveals the two teams that nearly pulled him out of retirement for one last NFL run,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/j-j-watt-reveals-the-two-teams-that-nearly-pulled-him-out-of-retirement-for-one-last-nfl-run/articleshow/126439377.cms,"J.J. Watt (Getty Images)

J.J. Watt says he seriously considered returning to the NFL, but only for these two teams

J.J. Watt comeback rumors refuse to fade, even two years after he last walked off an NFL field. The future Hall of Famer did not chase attention or headlines, but his recent comments revealed just how close the idea came to becoming real. Retirement, for Watt, was never about shutting the door completely. It was about timing, trust, and purpose.For fans, the thought alone carries weight. Watt is not just a former star; he is a standard bearer for toughness and leadership. His words hint at a mindset that still burns quietly, waiting for the right spark rather than constant spotlight. That restraint says as much about his legacy as his sack totals.In a conversation with Jonathan M. Alexander of the Houston Chronicle, Watt admitted he would have answered the call under rare conditions. “It would have had to have been the perfect situation, but I definitely would have,” Watt said of coming out of retirement in 2024. He went further, explaining the narrow window that might have pulled him back. “It would have to have been, people went down — a Phillip Rivers type.. . Like we need you or we can't participate. It had to be them or Pittsburgh with my brother. Those were the only spots I would have done it for.”This was never about chasing one more season or padding a résumé.Watt’s stance shows a veteran who values relationships and responsibility over ego. Houston represented unfinished emotional business. Pittsburgh offered family. Anything else was noise.His last NFL chapter in Arizona showed he still had something left. At 33, Watt stayed healthy and productive, finishing with 12.5 sacks and proving that preparation can offset age. A 35-year-old version in 2024 may have looked different, but usefulness does not always mean dominance. It often means timing and presence.The bond with Texans coach DeMeco Ryans added another layer. Watt even reached out, making it clear he would step in if the situation demanded it. That call never came. Injuries did not force a crisis. The door stayed closed.Today, Watt thrives in a new role with CBS, offering sharp insight rather than pass rush pressure. Houston keeps winning when he calls their games, a quiet reminder that his influence never really left. A return now feels unlikely. Not impossible, but distant. And perhaps that is fitting. Legends do not always need one last act to stay relevant.Also Read: What was JJ Watt's net worth in 2025: Exploring his endorsements, investments, car collection and more",J.J.

Stefon Diggs and Cardi B are becoming a growing headache for the Patriots as the couple stirs nonstop controversy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/stefon-diggs-and-cardi-b-are-becoming-a-growing-headache-for-the-patriots-as-the-couple-stirs-nonstop-controversy/articleshow/126435719.cms,"The New England Patriots are gaining momentum on the field behind Drake Maye, but off-field distractions persist. Stefon Diggs and Cardi B continue to generate controversy, creating unwanted noise that challenges Mike Vrabel’s push for focus, discipline, and stability during a crucial rebuild phase.

Patriots’ rebuild faces unwanted spotlight as Stefon Diggs and Cardi B dominate headlines

The New England Patriots finally feel like a team moving forward again. Wins are no longer theoretical. Belief has returned to the building, and the early signs of a long-term plan are visible every Sunday. Yet just as momentum builds, the spotlight keeps drifting away from the field and toward headlines that make football feel secondary.That tension defines this moment in Foxborough. Progress inside the facility clashes with noise outside it. The Patriots are trying to establish a new identity, but weekly distractions continue to test how much control still matters in a franchise built on it.Everything begins with Drake Maye. The young quarterback has become the face of the rebuild and the clearest reason optimism feels real. His growth has been steady, his command sharper by the week. Head coach Mike Vrabel has tripled down on structure, accountability and focus and has created a locker room that reflects his approach.Away from football, the contrast could not be sharper. Maye’s personal life has drawn lighthearted attention, the kind that reinforces stability. On the opposite end stands Stefon Diggs, whose relationship with Cardi B continues to generate celebrity-driven headlines that follow the team week after week.For New England, the dilemma is simple but uncomfortable. Diggs is not replaceable. He is the offense’s only true game-breaking receiver and the key to unlocking Maye’s next leap. Without him, spacing tightens, defenses relax, and progress slows.That value buys patience. If Diggs were a complementary piece, the tolerance would be lower. Star production changes the equation, even when the attention becomes exhausting. Recent flare-ups involving Cardi B only reinforced how quickly private moments can spill into public view, including milestones that should have remained personal.Vrabel’s challenge is keeping the locker room insulated. His message relies on clarity and repetition. Each distraction chips away at that focus, even if the core remains steady. The Patriots believe their window is opening. Whether outside noise narrows it will depend on how firmly football stays first.Also Read: Cardi B says she hates men, calls them predators and threatens to ‘rob’ them again amid Stefon Diggs’ ongoing assault charges","Patriots' rebuild faces unwanted spotlight as Stefon Diggs and Cardi B dominate headlines.

Tom Brady’s suicide hotline reference fuels worries about his mental state after Gisele Bündchen split and Alix Earle dating rumors,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/tom-bradys-suicide-hotline-reference-fuels-worries-about-his-mental-state-after-gisele-bndchen-split-and-alix-earle-dating-rumors/articleshow/126435634.cms,"Tom Brady has sparked concern after a podcaster claimed he remains emotionally broken following his divorce from Gisele Bündchen. Attention intensified after Brady shared Instagram posts featuring emotional music, including a song titled with a suicide hotline number. Amid dating rumors with Alix Earle, fans and commentators are questioning his mental well-being during this post-divorce chapter.

Tom Brady sparks mental health concern as personal life faces scrutiny

✨316: Alix Earle & Tom Brady in St. Barths, End of an Era Eps 3 & 4 + RHOSLC✨

Public curiosity around Tom Brady has shifted again, not because of football, but because of what appears to be a restless personal chapter. A brief New Year’s moment in St. Barths reignited dating rumors, yet the conversation quickly moved beyond romance. It turned inward, toward emotional aftermath and unresolved pain that still lingers years after his marriage ended.For many observers, the contrast is striking. While Brady is spotted dancing and smiling, voices close to pop culture circles suggest a different reality beneath the surface. The discussion is less about who he is seen with and more about how deeply the past continues to shape his present.A recent episode of the Pop Culture podcast offered a blunt take on Brady’s state of mind following his divorce from Gisele Bündchen, who married Joaquim Valente in December and recently welcomed a child. One podcaster did not sugarcoat the situation.""I think he’ll hook up with really anyone hot, but it still took me by surprise because she is quite a bit younger than him,"" the podcaster said. ""Meanwhile, Gisele is basically posting with Joaquim, who she’s now married to, and their new baby, and she seems so in love and so happy. Imagine if the roles were reversed and Tom had married the yoga instructor and Gisele was in St.Barths hooking up with some young guy—we would be like, ‘Get it, girl. ’""I do think that there might be a part of him that is pretty broken, honestly. I don’t think that’s even like a misuse. I think we know. I mean, he posts some pretty emotional Instagram stories, like he’ll post a sunset with a Fleetwood Mac song. ""He posted a selfie, but then it was with a Logic song where the title of the song was a suicide hotline number. It really doesn’t take that much reading in between the lines.""Those observations add context to why Brady’s social media presence keeps drawing attention. Subtle music choices and reflective posts have fueled speculation that public appearances with influencer Alix Earle may not tell the full story. Brady and Bündchen were married for 13 years and share two children, a bond that does not simply dissolve with paperwork.Whenever Brady is going through life after football and marriage, each moment is exaggerated. It is not clear whether this stage is healing or avoidance. This is what is apparent even after the light has moved past icons still have an emotional weight.Also Read: Tom Brady struggles to move on from Gisele Bündchen as trust issues surface with Alix Earle amid rumored romance","Tom Brady sparked concern after a podcaster claimed he remains emotionally broken following his divorce from Gisele Bündchen.

Trae Young addresses new Wizards teammates

Trae Young reflects on Atlanta exit as fans respond



Trae Young is now a Wizard. He arrived with the weight of seven seasons in Atlanta and the responsibility of guiding one of the league’s youngest rosters. At his first public moment with the Wizards, Young spoke about his future in theroster and his excitement.NBA fans quickly went to celebrate the NBA veteran’s response. Reactions across social platforms reflected respect for how Young framed his transition. Washington supporters welcomed the message. Neutral fans noticed the shift. But for Young, he appears to be more excited than ever.At his introductory press conference, Trae Young focused on connection and responsibility. He spoke about his role with the roster, many of whom are still early in their careers. “Just being able to have an impact on my teammates... being able to be a vet with these young guys here... I'm just super excited,” Trae Young shared in a recent press conference as a Wizard.That message aligned with why Washington pursued him. The Wizards moved CJ McCollum and Corey Kispert to create flexibility and bring in a proven offensive leader. The organization views Young as a central figure who can raise standards while helping young players grow within a demanding league environment.Fans went on to shower praise on his latest comments. “Man is humble. Welcome to the fold mate 🫵,” one fan wrote.“Wizards gonna be wizarding with Trae,” another shared.“Appreciate his positivity,” one fan shared.One fan hailed his future leadership, “love seeing you lead the team.”January 7, 2026, marked Young’s final game as a Hawk, though injury kept him on the bench. A right quad contusion denied him a final moment on the court, closing his Atlanta chapter quietly. However, Young is looking to jump into his next chapter.Young did not avoid the emotions tied to leaving the franchise that drafted him in 2018. In his farewell message, he explained why change became necessary. “The last few years weren’t how I wanted them to be,” Young said. “Expectations that we created for ourselves, reaching heights that Atlanta has never reached before.“Bringing a championship to Atlanta was always my goal. However, between the injuries, the setbacks, and situations that didn’t make sense, we never truly got to see our full potential.”He addressed the decision with honesty rather than blame. “The pain of staying the same eventually outweighed the uncertainty of change. Change is often met with fear, but I see it as another opportunity.”In Washington, Young now reunites with Travis Schlenk, the executive who drafted him.Also Read: ""We never truly got to see our full potential"": Trae Young bids Atlanta Hawks a bittersweet farewell with an emotional post","Trae Young is now a Wizard after seven seasons with the Atlanta Hawks.

Who Gains More

The Boston Celtics are again at the center of trade discussions, with league chatter linking them to Milwaukee Bucks center Myles Turner. The idea has gained traction as Boston looks for a stable presence in the middle and Milwaukee continues to assess a roster that has not settled into rhythm.Turner’s name stands out because of what Boston lacks. The Celtics have relied on patchwork solutions in the frontcourt, often juggling injuries and limited rebounding. Adding a dependable center with playoff experience would address a clear gap, especially as the team tries to maximize the prime years of Jayson Tatum.Myles Turner has built his career on rim protection and floor spacing. He is a two-time league blocks leader and a consistent three-point shooter for his position. Boston Celtics have struggled on the defensive glass, ranking 20th in defensive rebounding percentage at 70.2 percent, and Turner’s presence could help stabilize that area.At 29, Turner also fits Boston’s timeline. He would align with the current core for a three- to four-year window, offering continuity rather than a short-term stopgap.One widely discussed framework would send Anfernee Simons, Josh Minott, a 2026 second-round pick (via Detroit, Milwaukee, or Orlando), and a top-three protected 2031 first-round pick to Milwaukee.In return, Boston would acquire Turner.Myles Turner is owed more than $25 million per season through 2028–29. That figure lines up with Simons’ expiring contract, giving Milwaukee financial flexibility. For Bucks general manager Jon Horst, the deal brings scoring help on the wing and future draft assets if the team chooses to retool around Giannis Antetokounmpo.Boston Celtics would gain a reliable interior defender who can also stretch the floor. That combination has been missing, especially when injuries disrupt their rotation. Turner would likely see cleaner offensive looks in Boston’s system than he did in Milwaukee, where spacing has often been tight.Milwaukee moves on from a Turner experiment that never fully clicked defensively. In return, they add Simons’ scoring and picks that can be used in future moves.Also read: NBA trade rumors: Houston Rockets potentially eyeing $231 million Cleveland Cavaliers superstar to form deadly duo with Kevin Durant Boston takes on long-term salary and gives up a distant first-round pick, but the on-court fit is clear. Milwaukee sacrifices size in the short term but gains flexibility and assets. On balance, the move favors Boston, which would be adding a proven center to a roster built to compete now.","The Boston Celtics are again at the center of trade discussions, with league chatter linking them to Milwaukee Bucks center Myles Turner.

What LeBron James Brings Back

Why This Game Matters

when the Los Angeles Lakers host the Milwaukee Bucks on January 9, 2026. The Lakers listed him as probable on the latest injury report after he missed one game while dealing with left foot joint arthritis and right-sided sciatica.His possible return comes at an important time. The Lakers are coming off their first loss of the year and are short on bodies. With Milwaukee in town and Giannis Antetokounmpo leading the Bucks, LeBron’s availability could have a real impact on how this game plays out.LeBron James sat out Wednesday’s 107-91 loss to the San Antonio Spurs. That game dropped the Lakers to 23-12 and third in the Western Conference. The decision to rest him was precautionary, not the result of a new injury.Earlier in the day, LeBron was listed as questionable. Later injury reports at 3:45 PM and 4:30 PM ET upgraded him to probable. That change suggests the team is comfortable with how he responded after taking one night off.Even if LeBron James plays, the Los Angeles Lakers will still be missing key rotation players. Rui Hachimura remains out with a right calf strain and will miss his fifth straight game after briefly being listed as questionable earlier in the week.Austin Reaves is also out with a left calf strain. Adou Thiero will miss the game as well due to a right MCL sprain. With those absences, the Lakers’ depth will be tested against a physical Bucks team.The game will be played at Crypto.com Arena. Tipoff is set for 7:30 PM PT, which is 10:30 AM IST on Saturday. The Lakers are trying to avoid back-to-back losses as a tough January stretch continues, with a matchup against the Sacramento Kings coming up next.Before sitting out, LeBron averaged 25.6 points and 6.3 assists over his previous 12 games. His presence helps stabilize the offense, especially with several teammates unavailable. If he plays his usual minutes, the Lakers will rely on him to control the pace and create shots.Also read: Is Luka Doncic playing tonight vs the Milwaukee Bucks?

Luka Doncic's Recent Form and Matchup Outlook

The Los Angeles Lakers will host the Milwaukee Bucks on January 9, 2026, at Crypto.com Arena. Luka Doncic is expected to play and is not listed on the injury report. Both teams are coming off losses, which adds importance to this game as the season moves on.This will be the second meeting between the two teams this season. The focus will again be on Doncic and Giannis Antetokounmpo, with both teams depending heavily on their star players.The Los Angeles Lakers come into the game with a 23-12 record. The Bucks are 16-21 and have struggled to find consistency. Los Angeles has leaned on Doncic as its main scorer and playmaker, especially with LeBron James missing recent games and still uncertain to return.Milwaukee has had similar issues. Giannis continues to lead the team, but the Bucks have not been able to put together steady performances, particularly away from home.Luka Doncic has no current injury concerns. Earlier ankle issues are no longer mentioned in recent reports. He is expected to start alongside Marcus Smart, Deandre Ayton, Bronny James, and Jarred Vanderbilt.If James remains out, Doncic will again carry most of the offensive responsibility, handling the ball and setting the pace.Luka Doncic has been productive in recent games, including a 36-point outing against the Pelicans. He has taken on a larger scoring role while also creating chances for teammates.Giannis is expected to play despite managing a calf issue. The Bucks are also dealing with limited depth, with Taurean Prince out following neck surgery. That puts more pressure on Giannis to deliver against a Lakers team built around Doncic.Also read: Milwaukee Bucks vs Los Angeles Lakers injury report (January 9, 2026): Injured and questionable players, where to watch, team stats, and more The game is set for a 10:30 p.m. ET tip-off and will air on SportsNet LA and NBA TV.","The Los Angeles Lakers host the Milwaukee Bucks on January 9, 2026, at Crypto.com Arena.

The Milwaukee Bucks play the Los Angeles Lakers on January 9, 2026, at Crypto.com Arena. The game tips off at 10:30 p.m. ET and comes at a time when both teams are dealing with injuries that have changed how they play and who they rely on.The focus is on the stars, but this game may be decided by who fills the gaps better. Giannis Antetokounmpo anchors Milwaukee, while the Lakers depend on their home record and shot creation. Los Angeles is favored by 3.5 points, with the total set at 230.5, suggesting a high-scoring night if rotations hold together.The Los Angeles Lakers are missing several regulars. Austin Reaves is out with a left calf issue. Adou Thiero is sidelined for at least four weeks due to a right MCL sprain. Rui Hachimura remains out with a right calf strain. LeBron James is listed as questionable because of foot arthritis and right sciatica, though some updates suggest he could play.Milwaukee Bucks’ list is shorter but still limiting. Taurean Prince is out following neck surgery and is not close to returning. Alex Antetokounmpo is unavailable due to a G League assignment. Pete Nance is also out on a two-way deal. With fewer options, players like Kevin Porter Jr.are expected to carry more of the offense.The game will air nationally on TNT. Local broadcasts include Spectrum SportsNet for Lakers viewers and FDS Wisconsin for Bucks fans. Streaming options include NBA League Pass, the TNT app, and Max. Radio coverage is available on ESPN LA 710 and FOX Sports 990.The Los Angeles Lakers are 23-12 and are led by Luka Dončić, who averages 28.1 points, 6.5 rebounds, and 7.3 assists. The offense leans heavily on his control of the game, with limited scoring coming from outside shooters like Jake LaRavia.Milwaukee Bucks enter at 16-20 overall and 7-11 on the road. Giannis remains the main option, while Kevin Porter Jr. adds 16.1 points and 7.0 assists. The Bucks have won three straight road games despite their overall away record.Giannis versus Luka is the clear centerpiece. If LeBron does not play, both stars will have even more control over the game. Ryan Rollins gives Milwaukee another scoring option against a thin Lakers wing group, while Porter Jr. is expected to pressure the Lakers’ bench.Milwaukee has a path to a close win if Giannis controls the paint late. A 118-114 Bucks victory is realistic. If LeBron plays, the Lakers’ chances improve, and the game could swing their way in a tight finish.","The Milwaukee Bucks play the Los Angeles Lakers on January 9, 2026, at Crypto.com Arena.

Golden State Warriors vs Sacramento Kings - Game Prediction

After playing each other in the first round of the 2023 playoffs, the Sacramento Kings and Golden State Warriors were perceived as a developing rivalry. However, this season, the two clubs are once again at opposite ends of the spectrum.The Warriors are 20-18 through 38 games, which looks fantastic compared to Sacramento's terrible 8-29 record, even though they haven't had the best season. Friday night's game between the two teams is scheduled to take place in San Francisco. In addition to the Warriors' apparent superiority over the Kings, Sacramento is coping with a number of serious ailments.On Friday, January 9 at 10:00 PM ET, the Golden State Warriors will host the Sacramento Kings at Chase Centre.

Weighing the Outcome

The Houston Rockets are being linked to another major move as trade chatter around the league continues. This time, the focus is on Cleveland Cavaliers point guard Darius Garland and the possibility of pairing him with Kevin Durant in Houston.Garland’s name is not new in Durant-related discussions. Before Durant ended up with the Rockets, Cleveland reportedly explored packages that included Garland. With Houston now pushing toward contention, league insiders believe the Rockets could revisit that idea to address their need for a true lead guard.Kevin Durant is still one of the league’s most reliable scorers, but his teams have often lacked consistent playmaking around him. Darius Garland would fill that gap immediately. He can run an offense, create shots for others, and score without dominating the ball.At 25, Garland also fits better with Houston’s timeline than some of the guards currently on the roster. A Garland–Durant pairing would give the Rockets a steady ball handler who can keep defenses honest while Durant focuses on scoring.One proposed framework would send Garland to Houston along with salary pieces such as De’Andre Hunter and a future first-round pick from Cleveland.In return, the Cavaliers would receive Jalen Green, Dillon Brooks, and the No. 10 pick in the 2025 NBA Draft.This setup helps Cleveland reduce second-apron pressure while adding depth and future assets. For Houston, it brings in a proven point guard without completely dismantling the roster.Cleveland’s playoff loss to the Pacers, despite finishing first in the East, raised questions about the backcourt fit alongside Donovan Mitchell. Moving Garland allows the Cavaliers to rebalance the roster around Mitchell and Evan Mobley.Green offers scoring upside, Brooks adds perimeter defense, and the draft pick gives Cleveland flexibility moving forward.For Houston, the upside is clear. Garland gives the team structure and playmaking, something Durant-led teams have often needed. The concern is Garland’s injury history and the loss of Green’s long-term potential.Also read: NBA trade rumors: Los Angeles Lakers possibly parting ways with $33 million star guard to bolster perimeter defense and increase title odds Cleveland gains depth, cap relief, and future assets but gives up its most natural point guard. Unless Green takes a major step forward, the deal favors Houston, especially with Durant still playing at an elite level.","The Houston Rockets are being linked to another major move as trade chatter around the league continues.

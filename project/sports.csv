But I do know he's the man of the hour.""Brooks, 28, was recently linked to tennis player Jannik Sinner after being spotted at the US Open.

I am looking for someone. It can be difficult as a tennis player to meet the right person because you are travelling all the time.""He also emphasized the importance of family support: ""To them I am not a big tennis star, just a normal guy."" Carlos mentioned enjoying time at home with his family after tournaments, regardless of results.The tennis star currently lives with his parents and three brothers in Spain, maintaining strong family ties despite his professional success.Brooks has not personally confirmed the relationship.

NEW DELHI: Kuldeep Yadav ’s wizardry with the ball proved far too much for a hapless UAE batting lineup as India romped to a commanding nine-wicket win in their Asia Cup 2025 opener in Dubai on Wednesday. The left-arm wrist spinner, who spent most of the UK tour on the bench, showed no signs of rust as he ran through the hosts with a devastating spell.Bowling with precision and guile, Kuldeep returned stunning figures of 4 for 7 in just 2.1 overs, dismantling UAE for a mere 57 runs in 13.1 overs. India then made light work of the chase, cruising to the target in only 4.3 overs to kick off their campaign in emphatic style.The performance earned Kuldeep the Player of the Match award — his first in T20 internationals after a long gap of seven years. His previous POTM award came way back in 2018, when he picked up three wickets in India’s victory over West Indies at Eden Gardens.“Thanks to Adrian, the trainer. I was working on my bowling and fitness, and everything is going perfectly. It’s about hitting the right length, reading the batters, and reacting to their plans. Even today, I just tried to anticipate what they’d do next,” Kuldeep said at the presentation ceremony.India’s batting effort resembled a highlight reel, with openers treating the modest chase like a glorified net session. UAE bowlers, rattled by India’s intent, struggled to land the ball in the right areas.Captain Suryakumar Yadav praised the team’s sharpness and energy: “It was a clinical performance from the boys. We wanted good attitude and energy on the field, and that’s what we got. The wicket looked good but was slightly on the slower side, so spinners had a role here.”With this resounding win, defending champions India now turn their focus to a high-voltage clash against arch-rivals Pakistan in Dubai on Sunday.","India beat UAE by nine wickets in Asia Cup 2025 opener in Dubai.

Poll What is more important for selection in the national team? Physical fitness tests Mental commitment and passion

NEW DELHI: Former Indian cricket captain Sunil Gavaskar has advised the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) against using the new Bronco fitness test as a criterion for national selection, stressing that players’ bodies differ and require role-specific considerations.The Bronco test, which is similar to the YoYo test but more demanding due to the lack of recovery intervals, has not yet been implemented. Recent fitness evaluations for men’s cricketers ahead of the 2025 Asia Cup still relied on the YoYo test, though the Bronco test is expected to be gradually introduced.""While it is fine to have these tests to get a general idea of where a player needs to strengthen their body, having them decide selection to the national team is a tad too much. Every person's body is different, so having one standard for everybody in the squad is well-nigh impossible. There has to be consideration given to the player's speciality and allowances made for that,"" Gavaskar wrote in his Sportstar column.He highlighted the differing fitness requirements across player roles.""For example, a wicketkeeper, who is constantly on the move the whole day, requires a different fitness level than the others.The fast bowlers will be different from the spinners, though the spinners will invariably bowl as many, if not more, overs in the day than them. The batters will need a different kind of fitness. As you can see, there is no such thing as a 'one-size-fits-all' approach. As long as this is taken into account and the strict parameters of the new test are not followed rigidly, then it is fine,"" he said.Gavaskar also stressed that mental commitment and passion for Indian cricket should take precedence over physical fitness tests.""The most important test for playing at the highest level for your country cannot be measured, as it's between the two ears. And the clincher for me is when the heart is opened, it should have only two words, 'Indian cricket', and nothing else,"" he stated.","Former Indian cricket captain Sunil Gavaskar has advised the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) against using the new Bronco fitness test as a criterion for national selection.

NEW DELHI: Afghanistan captain Rashid Khan admitted that managing his team’s rich spin resources can be a tricky task, but said the depth also makes his job easier after their commanding 94-run win over Hong Kong in the Asia Cup opener on Tuesday. Opting to bat, Afghanistan put up 188/6, before using seven different bowlers to restrict Hong Kong to 94/9.""That is a very tough task, (selecting) the playing eleven (as well). To keep Mujeeb out is a tough decision, then Noor as well (was left out) in some games. I forgot to bowl my two overs (tonight at first),"" Rashid said at the post-match presentation.""You have to see who is more successful against a particular batter (and then see). Good thing is that I have options and that makes the job easier.""Afghanistan were reduced to 26/2 before Azmatullah Omarzai’s late assault lifted them to a competitive total. Rashid, however, noted the team’s recurring weakness at the top.""It was a great game. Good to put the total on the board. But losing wickets early on is the key for us. We had the same issue in the last series (against Pakistan). That's one area we have to look into. Upcoming games are very important and that is an area if we can make it better… Batting in the death overs was a great effort, especially Omarzai. Overall, it was a great performance.""On the decision to bat first, Rashid explained:""We have good spinners. It puts pressure on the opposition. If you have runs on the board… with batters trying to take risks, that is where you are more effective (as spinners), and that is why we are defending better than chasing.But in T20, we have to chase also, so the mentality has to be to chase as well and have a good record.""Player of the Match Omarzai smashed 53 off 21 balls with five sixes and two fours, before contributing with the ball as well.""Very tough batting in the lower order. It is all about belief. The captain and coach have belief in me. Was trying to hit it straight. We lost early wickets. I was speaking to Atal that we will go for boundaries after the 16th over,"" said Omarzai.""When I get the ball, I feel I am a proper bowler. When I get to bat, I feel I am a proper batter.""Hong Kong skipper Yasim Murtaza admitted Omarzai’s knock turned the match.""Just feels like a dream come true (on playing the Asia Cup). It is one of the biggest tournaments in Asia. To be honest, we weren't expecting that kind of total. I was expecting 150. Credit to Omarzai, he changed the game. Babar Hayat with the bat and the spinners were positive from the game.""",Afghanistan beat Hong Kong by 94 runs in the Asia Cup opener on Tuesday.

India XI by Ashwin:

Former India off-spinner R Ashwin has excluded Sanju Samson from his predicted playing XI for India's Asia Cup 2025 opening match against UAE in Dubai, instead backing Shubman Gill for the opening slot. Ashwin revealed his preferred lineup on his YouTube channel, where he also predicted Gill to emerge as the tournament's leading run-scorer.Ashwin's decision to leave out his former Rajasthan Royals teammate Samson stems from the consideration that the 30-year-old Kerala wicketkeeper hasn't played as a finisher in the side. He suggests that India should instead opt for Jitesh Sharma at the number 5 position.Ashwin expressed confidence in the opening combination of Gill and Abhishek Sharma, suggesting their partnership could be intimidating for opponents. ""Shubman Gil and Abhishek Sharma. Folks get scared with that opening combination. Shubman Gill knows he needs to make runs, and he will want to make runs. He is a run machine. He can make big runs at a lower strike rate,"" Ashwin stated.The former off-spinner emphasized Gill's versatility in T20 cricket, highlighting his ability to adapt to different batting approaches. ""Abhishek Sharma will tee off at one end. Shubman Gill could be the glue around which the team is built up.In today's times, there is not a lot of need to become the glue in T20 cricket. But Shubman has it in him to play conventional cricket and still make a 100 off 55 balls,"" Ashwin explained.The selection debate between Samson and other players continues to be a topic of discussion as India prepare for their opening match. Ashwin's analysis suggests that team composition and role clarity are crucial factors in the selection process.Shubman Gill, Abhishek Sharma, Suryakumar Yadav, Tilak Varma, Jitesh Sharma, Hardik Pandya, Axar Patel, Varun Chakravarthy, Kuldeep Yadav, Arshdeep Singh, and Jasprit Bumrah.","Former India off-spinner R Ashwin has excluded Sanju Samson from his predicted playing XI for India's Asia Cup 2025 opening match against UAE.

Poll Do you think Shreyas Iyer will make a strong comeback after his injury? Yes, he has the resilience to bounce back No, the injury may impact his performance

NEW DELHI: Indian cricketer Shreyas Iyer has revealed the extent of the back injury that nearly ended his career, disclosing that he suffered paralysis in one leg before making a successful return to the sport. The setback also cost him a place in the BCCI’s central contract list.Two years ago, Iyer was hospitalised in England as his condition worsened, surviving on painkillers and cortisol injections while his spine and hip deteriorated.“No one can understand the pain I went through. I was totally paralysed in one leg. With spine surgery, you can place a rod in the back and still manage. But a snapped nerve, which is what I had, is really, really dangerous,” Iyer told GQ India.The batsman recalled how the pain shot “all the way down to my tiny toe,” calling the experience “horrendous and scary.”After surgery, Iyer needed a full year to recover, during which he slipped out of the central contract list.“People see athletes as robots who must perform every game. They don’t know what’s happening behind the scenes,” he said.Recently, Iyer’s omission from India’s Asia Cup squad raised eyebrows, especially after he emerged as Punjab Kings’ top scorer in IPL 2025.“I can only control the controllable. I’ll keep working on my skills and strength, and when the opportunity arises, I’ll grab it with both hands,” he added.His journey highlights not just the physical toll of elite sport, but also the resilience required to fight back.",Indian cricketer Shreyas Iyer reveals extent of the back injury that nearly ended his career.

Poll How do you feel about the political tensions overshadowing the Asia Cup? It's concerning and affects sports. I believe sports should remain separate from politics.

The festive build-up to the 2025 Asia Cup has been clouded by political tensions between India and Pakistan in the aftermath of the Pahalgam terror attack and subsequent cross-border firing. The controversy deepened at Tuesday’s pre-tournament press conference in Dubai, when attention shifted to a handshake between India captain Suryakumar Yadav and Pakistan’s Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi.Early on, social media was abuzz with claims that Surya and Pakistan skipper Salman Ali Agha had refused to shake hands.However, video footage later disproved the rumours, showing Surya exchanging pleasantries instead with Naqvi, who also serves as PCB chairman and ACC chief, in addition to his political post.Clips of the handshake quickly went viral, fuelling backlash among Indian fans.Naqvi, known for his anti-India rhetoric in media, greeted all captains at the event. But his dual role as a political figure and cricket administrator has made the optics especially controversial.""Pakistan sponsored terrorists killed two of our bravehearts today and the bcci captain has all the smiles on his face while meeting Mohsin Naqvi , PCB Chairman who wanted a nuclear attack on Bharat Mata. If this is sports diplomacy than of course this a Charlie diplomacy,"" Major Pawan Kumar, Shaurya Chakra (Retd) wrote.One outraged user wrote: “Captain Suryakumar Yadav handshake with Pakistan’s Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi, who recently threatened India after Operation Sindoor.

What does the horoscope of struggling Prithvi Shaw say?

A Mumbai sessions court on Tuesday imposed a Rs 100 token cost fine on cricketer Prithvi Shaw for failing to submit his reply in a molestation case filed by social media influencer Sapna Gill. The court granted Shaw one more opportunity to respond to Gill's criminal revision petition, which challenges a magistrate court's earlier decision to not register an FIR against the cricketer.The sessions court had previously issued multiple requests for Shaw to respond to Gill's petition. Despite a final warning during the last hearing, Shaw did not file his reply by Tuesday's hearing.""Still, one more chance is granted for a cost of Rs 100,"" the judge stated before scheduling the next hearing for December 16.Gill's attorney, Advocate Ali Kaashif Khan, expressed concerns about Shaw's conduct in court, stating: ""This has been his regular way of handling the case despite being summoned many times.""The case originates from an incident at an Andheri pub in Mumbai on February 15, 2023. Police reports indicate that Gill's friend, Shobit Thakur, repeatedly requested selfies with Shaw around 1 am, leading to an argument after Shaw declined further photo requests.The situation escalated when Shaw was leaving the venue with his friend Ashish Surendra Yadav. According to police accounts, Thakur was allegedly attacked with a baseball bat, while Shaw escaped unharmed.A group of six individuals, including Thakur and Gill, allegedly chased Yadav and demanded Rs 50,000.Police subsequently registered a case against the group, leading to Gill's detention on February 17, 2023. She was released on bail three days later.Gill's version of events differs significantly from the police account. She alleges that Shaw and Yadav had invited her and Thakur to join them at their VIP table for drinks. According to her complaint, when Thakur requested selfies, Shaw and Yadav assaulted him.Gill claims that when she attempted to intervene, Shaw physically and sexually assaulted her. She filed a counter-complaint against the cricketer, accusing him of assault, molestation, and outraging her modesty.The magistrate court initially declined to register an FIR based on Gill's complaint, instead ordering a police inquiry into the matter. Dissatisfied with this decision, Gill approached the sessions court with a criminal revision petition in April 2024.The case remains ongoing, with Shaw now required to pay the token fine and submit his response before the next hearing scheduled for December 16.","Sapna Gill had filed a complaint against Prithvi Shaw in 2023 at the Airport police station, after she was arrested and granted bail in the case.

NEW DELHI: India kick off their Asia Cup 2025 campaign on Wednesday against hosts United Arab Emirates at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium. With eight Asia Cup titles, the most by any team, the defending champions will aim for a record-extending ninth crown under skipper Suryakumar Yadav and head coach Gautam Gambhir.India arrive in the UAE as favourites, carrying an outstanding record of 24 wins and only three losses since last year’s global tournament.At the pre-match press conference, Suryakumar highlighted both the challenge of facing UAE and the luxury of having part-time bowling options in the squad.“They (UAE) play an exciting brand of cricket. Recently they came very, very close against strong teams. We are really excited to play them,” he said.On India’s depth, he added: “We don’t want to rely too much on part-timers, but when a top or middle-order batter gives you an extra over, it’s always good for the captain. On slow pitches, that flexibility can be crucial.”In red-hot form after the Anderson–Tendulkar Trophy in England, Gill has already scored 578 runs in 21 T20Is, including a blazing 126 and four half-centuries*.India’s strike bowler was brilliant in the 2024 T20 World Cup, taking 15 wickets in 8 matches at 8.27 apiece.Across 70 T20Is, he has 89 wickets with a miserly economy of 6.27.The teams have met just once in T20Is — the 2016 Asia Cup, where UAE were restricted to 81/9 before India chased the target inside 11 overs.: September 10, Wednesday: 8:00 PM IST / 6:30 PM local: Dubai International Cricket StadiumSony Sports Network, SonyLIV: Suryakumar Yadav (C), Shubman Gill (VC), Abhishek Sharma, Tilak Varma, Hardik Pandya, Shivam Dube, Axar Patel, Jitesh Sharma (WK), Jasprit Bumrah, Arshdeep Singh, Varun Chakaravarthy, Kuldeep Yadav, Sanju Samson (WK), Harshit Rana, Rinku Singh.Reserves: Prasidh Krishna, Washington Sundar, Riyan Parag, Dhruv Jurel, Yashasvi Jaiswal.: Muhammad Waseem (C), Alishan Sharafu, Aryansh Sharma, Asif Khan, Dhruv Parashar, Ethan D’Souza, Haider Ali, Harshit Kaushik, Junaid Siddique, Matiullah Khan, Muhammad Farooq, Muhammad Jawadullah, Muhammad Zohaib, Rahul Chopra, Rohid Khan, Simranjeet Singh, Saghir Khan.","India kick off their Asia Cup 2025 campaign against hosts United Arab Emirates in Dubai on Wednesday.

NEW DELHI: Marco Jansen and Corbin Bosch shared four wickets as South Africa claimed a 14-run victory over England under the Duckworth-Lewis-Stern (DLS) method in a rain-shortened first T20I at Cardiff on Wednesday.Persistent showers at Sophia Gardens reduced what should have been a 40-over contest to just 12.5 overs in total. England were left chasing a stiff revised target of 69 in five overs but faltered to 54 for 5, unable to keep pace with a daunting run rate of nearly 14 an over against South Africa’s disciplined attack.Jansen (2 for 18) and Bosch (2 for 20) did most of the damage, while Jos Buttler (25) was the only England batter to reach 20.Earlier, South Africa were put in to bat after England captain Harry Brook won the toss. The visitors raced to 97 for 5 in 7.5 overs thanks to a series of quickfire contributions. Skipper Aiden Markram top-scored with 28 off 14 balls, including two fours and two sixes, though he enjoyed a slice of luck when Phil Salt dropped him in the deep. Donovan Ferreira was named player of the match for his unbeaten 25 off just 11 balls, featuring three sixes, while Dewald Brevis chipped in with 23.England opted to rest Jofra Archer, who had starred with four wickets in the third ODI at Southampton, with Luke Wood taking his place. Wood impressed in the damp conditions, removing opener Ryan Rickelton for a golden duck en route to figures of 2 for 22.Reflecting on the chaotic contest, Markram said at the presentation: “It feels like madness, but you can think about things. It was swinging with the new ball, but you need one or two guys to make a cameo and you can reach a good score.”England’s chase unraveled quickly. Salt holed out to Kagiso Rabada off the very first ball, while captain Brook followed for a duck. Jacob Bethell, fresh from his maiden professional century at Southampton, made just seven before skying Jansen to cover.Buttler briefly kept the hosts alive before he too fell, edging Jansen behind. That left England needing 26 from the final over, but Bosch struck with his first ball to remove Tom Banton, ending any hopes of a late charge.South Africa now lead the three-match series 1-0, with the second T20I scheduled for Friday at Old Trafford.","South Africa beat England under the Duckworth-Lewis-Stern method in first T20I.

Shivam Dube press conference: India's record win over UAE, comparison with Hardik Pandya, and more

Shivam Dube is slowly carving his space as a genuine all-rounder for India, and his performance in the Asia Cup opener against the UAE underlined just how far he has come. Picking up three wickets for just four runs in two overs, Dube played a crucial role in India’s nine-wicket demolition of the hosts, showing that his bowling can be just as effective as his power-hitting.Dube credited a lot of his improvement to bowling coach Morne Morkel, who has been working closely with him since his return to the Indian team during the England series. “Morne has been working with me since I came back into the Indian team for the England series. He has given me certain specific advice and I worked on them,” Dube said. He revealed how Morkel helped him fine-tune his line, develop a slower delivery, and adjust his run-up. “The head coach and the skipper had told me that my bowling will have a role to play,” he added.The India all-rounder has also spent the last two months focusing on his fitness and batting skills. “For the last two months, I have worked a great deal on my fitness. As far as my batting is concerned, I know I have a role to play in the middle overs. Over the years, bowlers targeted me with short balls, and I have worked on increasing my range of shots,” Dube explained.He also spoke about adapting to conditions, noting that “as the tournament progresses, wicket will get slower and I know my slower ball will be effective, and I also know how to bat in middle overs. ”On comparisons with Hardik Pandya , Dube was clear that there is no rivalry. “Hardik is like a brother from whom I tend to learn a lot as he has way more experience both in IPL and international cricket compared to me. Comparison, I never thought of, as my only endeavour is to learn as much as I can from his vast experience,” he said.Looking ahead to the India-Pakistan clash, Dube stayed grounded. “Whether I am playing against UAE or Pakistan, I try to follow what my coach Gauti bhai (Gambhir) tells me. When you play for India, you have got a chance to do some great things for the country,” he said.Dube’s emergence as a reliable seam-bowling all-rounder gives India flexibility in their lineup, particularly as they look to balance batting depth and bowling firepower in the Asia Cup.",Shivam Dube picked up three wickets for just four runs in two overs in India's nine-wicket demolition of the hosts.

Poll Should the Supreme Court cancel the India-Pakistan T20 Asia Cup clash? Yes, for national dignity No, it's just a game Only if it affects security

NEW DELHI: A public interest litigation (PIL) has been filed before the Supreme Court of India seeking cancellation of the upcoming India–Pakistan T20 Asia Cup clash, scheduled for September 14 in Dubai.The petition, filed by four law students led by Urvashi Jain through advocates Sneha Rani, Abhishek Verma and Md. Anas Chaudhary, argues that holding the match so soon after the Pahalgam terror attack and Operation Sindoor undermines national dignity and disregards the sacrifices of Indian soldiers and civilians.“Cricket cannot be placed above national interest, the lives of citizens, or the sacrifices of armed personnel,” the plea stated, urging the apex court to intervene. The petitioners have also sought directions for the swift impalementation of the National Sports Governance Act, 2025, to regulate such decisions in the future.The high-profile fixture, often billed as the biggest contest in world cricket, remains the centerpiece of the Asia Cup. However, with the PIL raising national security and sentiment concerns, the match now hangs under a cloud of uncertainty. The Supreme Court is expected to hear the matter before the scheduled date.Meanwhile, India signaled their intent on the field with a ruthless start to their title defense . In their opening match, they crushed hosts United Arab Emirates by nine wickets at the Dubai International Stadium on Wednesday. Left-arm wrist-spinner Kuldeep Yadav produced a magical spell of 4/7, while all-rounder Shivam Dube picked up 3/4 as UAE were bundled out for just 57 in 13.1 overs.India’s chase was swift and brutal — Abhishek Sharma blazed away with 30 off 16 balls, Shubman Gill chipped in with 20* off nine deliveries, and skipper Suryakumar Yadav finished unbeaten on seven as the defending champions wrapped up victory in just 4.3 overs, their fastest-ever T20I win.","A public interest litigation (PIL) has been filed before the Supreme Court of India seeking cancellation of the upcoming India–Pakistan T20 Asia Cup clash.

Poll Who impressed you the most in the match against UAE? Kuldeep Yadav Suryakumar Yadav Abhishek Sharma Shivam Dube

India’s Asia Cup 2025 opener turned into a one-sided affair as Suryakumar Yadav ’s side brushed aside the United Arab Emirates with a nine-wicket victory in Dubai. The match barely stretched into the evening, with UAE bowled out for just 57 before India chased down the target in 4.3 overs.Suryakumar chose to field first and his decision was justified as India’s bowlers made full use of a slow surface. The skipper was all praise for the group after the emphatic win. “It was a clinical performance from the boys,” SKY said after the match. “We wanted good energy and attitude in the field, and that carried into the batting as well. The pitch looked on the slower side, so I expected spinners to dominate, but it was great to see the support shown by Hardik, Bumrah and Dube. ”He also reserved special words for Abhishek Sharma , who cracked a quickfire 30 at the top. “He is a phenomenal batter and that is the reason he is the world number one right now. He always puts the team first, irrespective of the score, and that is unbelievable from him.”The day, however, belonged to Kuldeep Yadav. The left-arm wrist-spinner ripped through the UAE lineup with figures of 4 for 7 in just 2.1 overs, his first spell in months after sitting out the England Tests. “It was tough not playing recently,” Kuldeep admitted. “I was working hard on my bowling and fitness, and tonight everything clicked. In this format, the length matters most. You have to read the batters and react quickly to what they are trying to do. ”With Pakistan up next, SKY admitted the anticipation is building in the camp. “We all are excited, everyone wants to play a good game and we are really looking forward to it,” he said with a smile.","India beat the United Arab Emirates by nine wickets in their Asia Cup opener.

As it happened:

Kuldeep Yadav’s triple-wicket over

Shivam Dube’s breakthrough spell

UAE bowled out for just 57

Abhishek gives India a flying start

NEW DELHI: Kuldeep Yadav’s artistry was far too much for a hapless United Arab Emirates side to comprehend as India stormed to a thumping nine-wicket victory in their Asia Cup 2025 opener at the Dubai International Stadium on Wednesday.The defending champions hardly broke a sweat, skittling UAE for a mere 57 runs in 13.1 overs before chasing the target down in just 4.3 overs — their fastest-ever T20I win.Abhishek Sharma blazed away with a 16-ball 30, while his opening partner and best friend Shubman Gill marked his return to T20 cricket with an unbeaten 20 off nine balls. Captain Suryakumar Yadav chipped in with a quick seven not out as India cruised to 60/1.But the foundation of the emphatic result came from India’s bowlers, led by Kuldeep’s magical spell of 4/7 and Shivam Dube’s career-best 3/4. From Bumrah’s toe-crusher to Kuldeep’s wizardry, UAE never recovered once early momentum slipped away.The decisive moment came when Kuldeep Yadav turned the game into a personal highlight reel. Introduced after Bumrah’s opening burst, the left-arm wrist-spinner dismantled UAE’s middle order in one sensational over, striking thrice.Rahul Chopra holed out at long-on, Harshit Kaushik was beaten all ends up by a googly, and skipper Muhammad Waseem fell lbw attempting a sweep. Kuldeep finished with 4/7, reminding everyone why he remains India’s most potent weapon in T20s.Often picked for his power-hitting, Shivam Dube showcased his growing bowling credentials by cleaning up the UAE tail. Bowling at the high 120s with clever changes of length, he returned remarkable figures of 3/4 in just two overs — his best in T20Is. With the T20 World Cup on the horizon, Dube’s seam-up spells add valuable balance to India’s line-up and will please head coach Gautam Gambhir Once Sharafu (22 off 17) and captain Muhammad Waseem (19 off 22) — their only two batters to reach double digits — fell, UAE had no answers. The spinners hunted in a pack, with Varun Chakravarthy (1/4) and Axar Patel (1/13) joining the party. Incredibly, UAE’s batters failed to score off 52 of the 81 legal deliveries bowled, collapsing for 57, their lowest total against India.Chasing a modest target, Abhishek Sharma ensured India wasted no time. The left-hander cracked two fours and three sixes in a 16-ball 30, taking the pressure off Gill, who calmly flicked Simranjeet Singh for the winning four. India’s chase resembled a highlights package, sealing an utterly one-sided contest and setting the tone for their title defense.","India beat United Arab Emirates by nine wickets in Asia Cup opener.

Fastest chase by India in Men's T20I ( by overs)

4.3 overs v U.A.E, Today

6.3 overs v SCO, Dubai 2021

9.2 overs v BAN, Hangzhou 2023

India made a thunderous start to their Asia Cup 2025 campaign in Dubai, rewriting history books with the fastest-ever chase in men’s T20I cricket The defending T20 World Cup champions needed just 4.3 overs to wipe out the modest target of 58 set by hosts United Arab Emirates, cruising to a nine-wicket victory that doubled up as a statement of intent.The evening belonged first to India’s bowlers, who completely dismantled the UAE line-up.Kuldeep Yadav was unplayable, finishing with a magical spell of 4 for 7, while all-rounder Shivam Dube chipped in with 3 for 4.Jasprit Bumrah, Axar Patel and Varun Chakravarthy took one wicket apiece as UAE were bundled out for just 57 in 13.1 overs.

Openers Abhishek Sharma and Shubman Gill wasted no time in setting the tone.Abhishek launched the innings with a towering six over long-off, then followed it up with a flurry of boundaries that left the UAE bowlers rattled. His 30 off just 13 balls included three sixes and two fours before he fell trying to clear the field once again.Gill, making a return to the T20I side after more than a year, anchored calmly at the other end, finishing unbeaten on 20.Captain Suryakumar Yadav joined the fun with a trademark flicked six over fine leg and ensured there was no hiccup as India romped home in record time.The win surpassed India’s previous quickest chase of 6.3 overs against Scotland at the 2021 T20 World Cup, ironically also in Dubai, and underlined the gulf between the two sides.For UAE, it was a night to forget; for India, it was the perfect beginning, capped by a massive net run rate boost and the aura of champions stamping authority from the very first game.",India beat United Arab Emirates by nine wickets in first Asia Cup match.

Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel.

India’s opening game of the Asia Cup 2025 in Dubai was filled with drama, even in a contest that proved one-sided. While the bowlers ripped through the UAE batting order to bowl them out for just 57, a quirky incident featuring Sanju Samson briefly stole the spotlight and evoked memories of Jonny Bairstow’s infamous dismissal in the 2023 Ashes.The moment arrived in the 13th over of the innings. Shivam Dube steamed in to bowl to Junaid Siddique, but as he delivered the short ball, a towel slipped from his waist.Siddique backed away and missed his pull, then pointed immediately to the towel.Distracted, he failed to return to the crease. Sanju Samson, alert behind the stumps, gathered the ball and fired an underarm direct hit. The replay showed Siddique short of his ground, and flashed on the big screen.However, the appeal was soon withdrawn by skipper Suryakumar Yadav, who acknowledged that the batter had been put off by the towel distraction.The episode drew comparisons with the Lord’s Test of July 2023, when Australian wicketkeeper Alex Carey stumped Jonny Bairstow after the Englishman left his crease believing the ball was dead.That dismissal sparked days of heated debate and polarized opinions across cricketing circles.Samson’s effort was sharp, but the context was different. There was no question of gamesmanship here, only presence of mind followed by a sporting gesture.In the end, the “not quite Bairstow moment” added a touch of lightness to a match otherwise dominated by India’s bowlers.Kuldeep Yadav was the star, taking 4 for 7 in a spell of wizardry, while Dube backed up his batting all-rounder credentials with 3 for 4.Jasprit Bumrah, Axar Patel and Varun Chakravarthy chipped in with one wicket apiece.

Poll What did you think about Suryakumar Yadav's decision to withdraw the appeal? It was a sportsmanlike gesture It was unnecessary I have mixed feelings about it

For the first time in 16 internationals across formats, India finally won a toss, and skipper Suryakumar Yadav had no hesitation in opting to field against the United Arab Emirates in Dubai. What followed was a ruthless display of bowling that left the hosts bundled out for just 57 runs in 13.1 overs.Right from the start, India’s attack showed no mercy. Jasprit Bumrah struck early with pace and precision, before the spin duo of Kuldeep Yadav and Axar Patel tightened the screws. Kuldeep was the standout, weaving his magic to claim four wickets. Varun Chakaravarthy chipped in with one, while Dube, using his variations as a medium pacer, cleaned up the lower order with three crucial strikes.The innings also saw a bizarre incident involving Junaid Siddique . Facing Dube, he backed away mid-delivery to complain about a towel slipping from the bowler’s waist. Distracted, he stepped out of his crease, and Sanju Samson , ever alert behind the stumps, underarmed a direct hit.Watch the video The third umpire ruled Siddique out, but in an admirable gesture, Suryakumar Yadav withdrew the appeal, recognising the unusual circumstances.

The Blue Colts, already having beaten Bahrain 2-0 and narrowly losing to hosts Qatar 1-2, finished their campaign with six points, leaving qualification hopes dependent on other results.Midfielder Vibin Mohanan was the star of the show, scoring a rapid-fire hat-trick in the 5th, 7th, and 62nd minutes. Ayush Chhetri (41’) and Mohammed Aimen (87’, 90+7’) added three more for a comprehensive victory.India wasted no time asserting dominance, with Muhammed Suhail’s cutback setting up Vibin for the opener in the fifth minute, followed by a looping second goal that left Brunei goalkeeper helpless. A fine one-two between Chhetri and Sreekuttan MS set up India’s third, before Vibin completed his hat-trick with a curling free-kick in the second half. Aimen’s long-range strikes sealed the emphatic 6-0 win.However, the celebrations in Doha were overshadowed by security concerns.Several explosions were reported across the Qatari capital, with smoke rising over the Katara district. Israeli media cited senior officials, reporting that the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and Israeli Security Agency (ISA) targeted senior Hamas leaders allegedly responsible for orchestrating attacks against Israel, including the October 7 strikes.The IDF stated that “precise munitions” were used with additional intelligence to minimise civilian casualties. Israeli Prime Minister confirmed full responsibility, while US President Donald Trump reportedly approved the operation, according to Israeli Channel 12.Despite the tense backdrop, India’s youngsters remained focused on the pitch, dominating Brunei with clinical finishing and controlled possession. The Blue Colts now await the Bahrain-Qatar result at the Abdullah bin Khalifa Stadium, which could see India finishing top of the group depending on the scoreline. Should Qatar hold or win, India would need a UAE victory by four or more goals over Iran to advance as one of the best runners-up.Coach Moosa and his squad will hope to carry this momentum forward, even as the international community monitors the unfolding security situation in Doha.","India beat Brunei Darussalam 6-0 at the Suheim Bin Hamad Stadium in Doha.

Sandro Tonali's last-gasp winner edged Italy to a 5-4 victory over Israel in 2026 World Cup qualifying on Monday, while Kosovo beat Sweden despite Alexander Isak making his first appearance of the season.After collapsing from leading 4-2 in the final two minutes to drawing 4-4, Tonali's 91st-minute strike in the Hungarian city of Debrecen sent Italy above Israel and into the play-off spot in Group I.New coach Gennaro Gattuso's side trail leaders Norway by three points and still have a chance of taking first place and the group's sole direct qualifying spot as they seek to avoid missing out on a third-consecutive World Cup finals appearance.""We'll take the win which was crucial for us, but we're completely nuts, nuts because we conceded some absurd goals,"" said Gattuso.""We need to work on that because we're too fragile, we concede goals too easily.

NEW DELHI: India etched their name in Central Asian football history on Monday, by securing a bronze medal in their maiden appearance at the CAFA Nations Cup. The Blue Tigers defeated higher-ranked Oman 3-2 on penalties after the third-place playoff ended 1-1 at the Hisor Central Stadium in Hisor, Tajikistan.The evening saw plenty of drama as Udanta Singh Kumam’s 80th-minute header cancelled out Jameel Al Yahmadi’s opener in the 55th minute, taking the contest into extra time. Oman were reduced to ten men when Ali Al Busaidi was sent off in the 96th minute, but despite India’s late dominance, the match went to a penalty shootout.In the shootout, Lallianzuala Chhangte, Rahul Bheke, and Jithin MS held their nerves to score for India, while Anwar Ali’s effort was saved and Udanta fired wide. For Oman, only Thani Al Rushaidi and Muhsen Al Ghassani converted, with Harib Al Saadi and Ahmed Al Kaabi missing the target. The decisive moment came when Indian skipper Gurpreet Singh Sandhu dived full stretch to save Al Yahmadi’s final kick, sparking wild celebrations as India sealed a historic podium finish.The match itself was an end-to-end affair. India began brightly, with Vikram Partap Singh and Chhangte troubling the Omani defence on the flanks.An early chance fell to defender Anwar Ali, whose powerful header was superbly saved by goalkeeper Ibrahim Al Mukhaini. Oman, however, responded through Issam Al Sabhi and Nasser Al Rawahi, testing Sandhu, who kept India in the contest with crucial saves.Oman struck first after the restart, when Abdullah Fawaz’s deft flick released Al Yahmadi to score at the far post. But head coach Khalid Jamil’s substitutions paid dividends, as Danish Farooq’s flick-on from Rahul Bheke’s long throw allowed Udanta to equalize with a brave header, confirmed after a lengthy VAR check.With Busaidi’s red card tilting the balance, India pressed for a winner in extra time but failed to break through.

NEW DELHI: Mikel Merino scored a hat-trick as a majestic Spain thumped Turkey 6-0 away in World Cup qualifying on Sunday, while a brilliant Florian Wirtz free-kick helped Germany beat Northern Ireland 3-1 to get their bid up and running. European champions Spain were in unstoppable form in the central Turkish city of Konya, claiming their second biggest-ever away win in World Cup qualifying as Arsenal midfielder Merino scored his first professional hat-trick.Barcelona playmaker Pedri Gonzalez opened the scoring inside six minutes and later completed the scoring, with Ferran Torres netting the visitors' other goal.The quality of Merino's strikes was remarkable, with his first coming at the end of a superb team move and his second a controlled finish from a Pedri assist. He completed his triple with a curling shot into the top corner.The one blemish on the night's work for Spain was the withdrawal of Nico Williams due to an apparent thigh injury, but Luis de la Fuente's team are already clear at the top of qualifying Group E with six points from two games.""I'm very happy for winning, to pick up six points, for doing it in this way, and for scoring three goals, which is not normal -- the first hat-trick of my career,"" said Merino.The group winners will qualify directly for the finals, with the runners-up progressing to a play-off phase.Georgia and Turkey come next on three points each, with the former beating Bulgaria 3-0 in Tbilisi thanks to goals by captain Khvicha Kvaratskhelia, Nika Gagnidze and Georges Mikautadze.Germany were under pressure after losing their opening qualifier 2-0 in Slovakia on Thursday, and it took them until the final quarter of their home meeting with Northern Ireland in Cologne before they could secure the victory.Serge Gnabry gave the hosts an early lead only for Isaac Price of West Bromwich Albion to equalise before half-time.The home fans were unhappy with Julian Nagelsmann's team, but they eventually retook the lead on 69 minutes when substitute Nadiem Amiri turned in David Raum's cross.Liverpool star Wirtz, playing in his home city, then took centre stage by converting a free-kick in style to seal Germany's first win in Group A.""We knew it was a catastrophe (in the) last game and we wanted to do things better,"" Wirtz told Germany's RTL network.""It was a good performance (which) we can definitely build on.""They and Northern Ireland both have three points, while Slovakia lead the way on six points after Tomas Rigo's late goal clinched a 1-0 victory in Luxembourg.Memphis Depay became the Netherlands' all-time top goalscorer with a brace in their 3-2 win in Lithuania in Group G.Depay, who now plays in Brazil for Corinthians, scored his 51st and 52nd international goals to move clear of Robin van Persie, with whom he had been tied in first place on half a century of strikes for the Oranje.The 31-year-old turned in Cody Gakpo's cutback for the opener before Quinten Timber netted the second goal for the Netherlands in Kaunas.They appeared to be on easy street, but Torino midfielder Gvidas Gineitis pulled one back and Edvinas Girdvainis headed in the equaliser before the break for the team ranked 143rd in the world.Depay, though, rescued the Netherlands by heading in a Denzel Dumfries cross just after the hour mark.Ronald Koeman's side have 10 points after four matches and are ahead of Poland on goal difference with a game in hand.Poland won 3-1 at home to Finland in Chorzow with Matty Cash, captain Robert Lewandowski and Jakub Kaminski netting before Benjamin Kaellman pulled one back for Finland, who are three points behind the leading duo in third.Belgium recorded a second 6-0 win in as many matches in Group J as they swept aside Kazakhstan at Anderlecht's stadium in Brussels. Kevin De Bruyne scored twice and is now his country's second-top goal-scorer of all time behind Romelu Lukaku.Jeremy Doku of Manchester City also bagged a brace, with Nicolas Raskin and Thomas Meunier netting the other goals.North Macedonia beat Liechtenstein 5-0 in the same group and they are top with 11 points from five matches, one ahead of Belgium -- who have a game in hand -- and Wales.",Mikel Merino scores a hat-trick as a majestic Spain thumped Turkey 6-0 away in World Cup qualifying.

As a coincidence, all Formula E drivers who won the Mexico City E-Prix went on to win the Formula E World Championship that season, and this has been proved right for three consecutive years.Highlighting the same since 2023, a poster of three World Champions was shared on X by Formula E with the caption, “The trend continues. Each winner of the #MexicoCityEPrix from the past three seasons has gone on to become World Champion.”The special poster features 2023 Formula E World Champion Jake Dennis from Andretti, then TAG Heuer Porsche’s Pascal Wehrlein, who won in 2024, and the new World Champion, Nissan driver Oliver Rowland. All three of them won in the Mexico E-Prix and went on to lift the winner’s trophy in the Formula E World Championship that year.Oliver Rowland had strengthened his chances of winning the Formula E World Championship this year much earlier. He was leading the Formula E Driver Standings ever since he won Part 2 of the Jeddah E-Prix, which was his second win of the season after winning the Mexico E-Prix. In the last leg, the Nissan driver got nervous for a while as Pascal Wehrlein, who was following him in the number two position, closed the gap after grabbing quite a few podiums while Rowland had a dull period.Things became serious for Rowland when he failed to finish the Round 13 race in Berlin, while Wehrlein won second spot on the podium. But he eventually managed to confirm his championship in Berlin after four wins and three more podiums.Sharing about his bad race in Berlin, Rowland had said, “I was hoping before the weekend that the outcome could be [the World Championship], but after yesterday (Saturday) and this morning (Sunday), I was more worried that it might never come.”Also Read: Oliver Rowland reacts to daughter’s sweet radio message after Formula E Championship win: “It’s amazing” Things, however, changed for Wehrlein, who was pushed to third position after Nick Cassidy made a late entry in the Formula E Driver Standings by registering three consecutive wins. He was pushed from second place to third, with Cassidy in second. Wehrlein registered one win and five more podiums this season.Meanwhile, Andretti driver Jake Dennis finished in seventh position in the Formula E Driver Standings. He won two podium spots this season.","All three Formula E drivers who won the Mexico City E-Prix went on to win the Formula E World Championship that season.

Taylor Barnard on losing top three spot in Formula E World Championship

Fans hail Taylor Barnard for his fantastic rookie season

It was Taylor Barnard’s rookie season this year, and the NEOM McLaren driver put up a fantastic performance by temporarily making it to the top three in the Formula E Driver Standings by ousting the much more experienced Porsche driver Antonio Felix Da Costa.

Barnard took to Instagram to share his feelings on losing out on the top three in his first-ever season and his claim to the championship.Taking to Instagram after the London E-Prix, Barnard wrote, “London wasn’t what we hoped for, easily being the toughest weekend of our season. Taking 0 points away as a team from a doubleheader hurts, but one weekend doesn’t define the year we’ve had.”He further wrote, “As the season closes, I want to say a massive thank you to the entire team, both trackside and behind the scenes, for everything this season. Finishing P4 in the Drivers’ Championship and coming into the final weekend with a shot at runner-up is something to be proud of.”Also adding a note for teammate Sam Bird, as NEOM McLaren withdrew from Formula E after the end of the season, Barnard wrote, “@sambird_official it wasn’t the weekend you deserved either.You’ve been a huge part of my season both on and off the track, and I’m grateful for everything. You deserved more. To all the Papaya fans, thank you for the incredible support in our final race together. You always go above and beyond. ”Reacting to his post, a fan wrote, “An incredible debut season, huge congrats and excited to see where you go next!” Another said, “I know I said it the other day, but you’ve been incredible to watch this last year and a pleasure to support you in Papaya — there are many of us that can’t wait to support you in whatever you do next!” One more commented, “You were incredible all season around, Taylor. Massive congratulations. You are the future of this sport.”Recalling Barnard’s maiden pole, a fan also wrote, “Fantastic season, Taylor, we'll never forget that Monaco pole.”Also Read: Taylor Barnard looks back at rookie season at McLaren: “Every step has been unforgettable” Barnard claimed five podiums in his first full season in Formula E.

Through the early days, the good days, the bad days, and the great days, we have always felt an overwhelming amount of support from you all.”For the partners associated with the team, he wrote, “They say that ‘racing is a state of mind’, and since its inception, this team has had the privilege of working for organisations, with partners, and racing for fans who fully embrace this philosophy.This is certainly true of those at McLaren, whose passion for racing is second to none.”“My heartfelt thanks go out to everyone who has been involved: those at McLaren who backed us, the fans who supported us, and the partners who allowed us to go racing. We couldn’t have done it without you all — your trust and support have never been taken for granted,” he added.Praising the two McLaren drivers, he wrote, “Sam clinched McLaren’s first-ever fully electric win at the São Paulo E-Prix in Season 10, pulling off one of Formula E’s all-time great overtakes, before being waved across the line by none other than Emerson Fittipaldi – McLaren's first Formula 1 World Champion. While Taylor has been a rookie sensation in Season 11, securing five Formula E records, including the youngest driver to start a race, the youngest points scorer, the youngest driver to lead a lap, the youngest podium finisher, and the youngest polesitter. ”He ended the letter saying, “Some of us have been together since the day we first launched this team, while others have seamlessly fitted in along the way and flourished within the environment we have cultivated. For many, I am sure that we will cross paths again soon, but whatever the future holds for those here at Bicester, whatever path they choose to follow, I have no doubt that it will be bright. Their potential is limitless. ”Reacting to the open letter on Instagram, Taylor Barnard wrote, “It’s been an honour to wear Papaya and represent this team.” Sam Bird also dropped a heart emoji and a hands-joined-in-prayer emoji in the comments section.Also Read: Taylor Barnard looks back at rookie season at McLaren: “Every step has been unforgettable” Neither Taylor Barnard nor Sam Bird has revealed their future course of action in Formula E Season 12.

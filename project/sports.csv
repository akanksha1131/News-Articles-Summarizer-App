Bold prediction! Astrologer Greenstone Lobo picks winner of Australia vs South Africa WTC Final 2025





NEW DELHI: India batter Shreyas Iyer 's uncanny knack for taking his teams to finals continues to script a love story unlike any other in Indian cricket . On Tuesday, the in-form batter and captain steered SoBo Mumbai Falcons into the T20 Mumbai League 2025 final, adding yet another chapter to his golden run as skipper across formats and competitions.It marks Iyer’s fourth final as captain in just over a year, starting with Kolkata Knight Riders’ IPL triumph in May 2024. Since then, he’s led Mumbai to a Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy title, Punjab Kings to an IPL final, and now SoBo Falcons to the summit clash of the city-based league.""There’s always pressure with captaincy, but I love leading,"" Iyer said on the sidelines of the T20 Mumbai League. ""I’ve done it since I was 22, and I enjoy embracing the challenge and the responsibility that comes with it.""In the semifinal, SoBo Mumbai Falcons outclassed Bandra Blasters by five wickets. Chasing a modest 131, Ishan Mulchandani anchored the reply with an unbeaten 52, supported by a brisk 32 from Akash Parkar and 27 from Angkrish Raghuvanshi. Earlier, Parkar starred with the ball too, grabbing three wickets to restrict Bandra.The final against Maratha Royals is scheduled for June 12 at Wankhede Stadium, with Iyer aiming for another title as captain.This remarkable run began with KKR’s IPL title in May 2024 — their first in a decade — where Iyer scored 351 runs and led with poise. He followed it up by leading Mumbai to their second Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy win in December, amassing 345 runs at a blistering strike rate of 188.52.Then came a defining Champions Trophy campaign in March 2025, although not as skipper, where Iyer’s consistent middle-order knocks helped India clinch their second ICC title in two years. Scores of 56, 79, and 48 were pivotal in India's title charge.In the recently concluded IPL 2025 season, he carried a resurgent Punjab Kings side to their first final in 11 years. Despite finishing runners-up to Royal Challengers Bengaluru, Iyer ended as PBKS’ top scorer with 604 runs at a staggering 175.07 strike rate.Iyer’s captaincy reign has become synonymous with finals. Win or lose on June 12, the love story between Shreyas Iyer and the big stage is far from over — it’s only getting deeper.","Shreyas Iyer leads SoBo Mumbai Falcons to T20 Mumbai League 2025 final.

Bold prediction! Astrologer Greenstone Lobo picks winner of Australia vs South Africa WTC Final 2025





South Africa captain Temba Bavuma has pinpointed Australia's makeshift opening pair as a key vulnerability his side intends to exploit when the ICC World Test Championship Final begins at Lord’s on Wednesday.Australia surprised many by promoting Marnus Labuschagne — traditionally a No.3 — to open alongside Usman Khawaja, bypassing teenage option Sam Konstas. Labuschagne has never opened in Tests, and the Proteas believe this unfamiliarity could tilt the early advantage their way.“I think there is an opportunity there,” Bavuma said on the eve of the ‘Ultimate Test.’ “The conditions bring us into the game a lot. With the swinging ball — very different from Australian conditions and even South African conditions — that definitely gives us an opportunity.”Both teams named bold XIs ahead of the one-off clash. South Africa opted for the returning Lungi Ngidi over Dane Paterson and retained Wiaan Mulder at No.3, while Australia’s decision to reshuffle their top-order is viewed as a gamble.“I think both teams have formidable bowling attacks.The real opportunity lies in the batting line-ups and how they respond to these conditions and pressure,” Bavuma added.Key to South Africa’s attack will be Kagiso Rabada . Rabada returns to Lord’s, a venue where he claimed a five-wicket haul in 2022, and enters the final in top form following his IPL stint with Gujarat Titans.“I think he's in the best shape that he's ever been,” Bavuma said. “He loves playing against the Australians, and that will be extra motivation for him. I think he's in a very good space.”With the stakes high and conditions promising assistance to bowlers, South Africa are banking on early breakthroughs to shake Australia’s foundations.",South Africa face Australia in the ICC World Test Championship Final at Lord's on Wednesday.

RCB Victory Parade: At least 8 Dead, Several Injured In Stampede Outside Bengaluru Stadium





BENGALURU: Amid rising concerns over Karnataka State Cricket Association’s (KSCA) administrative stability in the aftermath of Wednesday’s stampede at M Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bengaluru, hosting of cricket in the city has taken a huge hit. The first casualty is the three-match one-day series between India ‘A’ and South Africa ‘A’ scheduled to be held here from November 13 to 19, 2025.Without specifying any reason, Indian cricket board ( BCCI ) issued a press release, stating Bengaluru matches have been shifted to Rajkot (Gujarat). The KSCA president did not dwell on the reasons but maintained that the stampede and change of venues were not related. Sources said the decision was taken on Thursday and communicated to KSCA.Before the limited-overs series, the two teams will play two multi-day red-ball matches and those will be held as per schedule at BCCI’s Centre of Excellence (CoE) — a dedicated centre near the airport on the outskirts of the city.This could probably be the beginning of problems for KSCA as a host association. According to sources, BCCI and the International Cricket Council (ICC) are now weighing the feasibility of ICC Women’s WC matches that are to be held in Bengaluru between Sept and Nov.Chinnaswamy Stadium is one of the five venues in India set to host the premier tournament with the Bengaluru facility earmarked for the opening contest involving India (on Sept 30), one semifinal (Oct 30) and the final (Nov 2) if Pakistan does not qualify, in which case it will be moved to Colombo.Speaking to TOI, former India captain Shantha Rangaswamy said, “I’m yet to come to terms with the tragedy at the stadium, which has brought joy and happiness to fans for 50 years. If the women’s World Cup matches are shifted out of Bengaluru, it will be a huge blow to cricket in the state. As for women’s cricket, we haven’t seen much growth in the past two-and-a-half years, and it will set us back further.”According to sources, it is unlikely KSCA will host a major cricket match for some time. To begin with, the stadium needs to be renovated, with the fan frenzy on Wednesday resulting in significant damage to the structure, including compound walls, railings, the staircase, and sanitation.","The three-match one-day series between India ‘A’ and South Africa. scheduled to be held here from November 13 to 19, 2025.

NEW DELHI: AAnshul Kamboj starred on the final day with a maiden First-Class fifty and two wickets as India A’s second unofficial Test against England Lions ended in a draw on Monday. Chasing an improbable 439-run target in the final session of the four-day match, the Lions stumbled to 32 for 3 before both captains agreed to shake hands.India A will now head to Beckenham to join the senior squad for a four-day intra-squad match scheduled from June 13-16 at the Kent County Cricket Ground.The first unofficial Test between the two sides in Canterbury had also ended in a draw.Here’s a look at the standout performers for India A across the two matches, ahead of the five-match Test series against England:It was a productive return for Test opener KL Rahul. After missing the first unofficial Test, he made an immediate impact in the second, scoring a composed 116 off 168 deliveries (15 fours, 1 six) in the first innings. He followed it up with a solid 51 in the second innings, taking his match tally to 167 runs at an average of 83.50 and a strike rate of 71.98. With his experience and form, Rahul is expected to strengthen India’s top order in the opening Test at Leeds.Set to return to the Indian Test side after more than eight years, Karun Nair made the most of his opportunity.The middle-order batter, who became only the second Indian to score a triple century in Tests (after Virender Sehwag), last played in 2017. In his comeback series, Nair was impressive, notching up a double century in the first unofficial Test. He followed it with scores of 40 and 15 in the second game. On current form, Nair appears to be a strong contender for the playing XI in the Leeds Test.Despite being left out of the main Test squad for the England series, Sarfaraz Khan made a strong statement with the bat. He struck a fluent 92 in the first innings of the opening unofficial Test, laced with 13 boundaries. The innings was a timely reminder of his quality, especially in testing English conditions, and sent a clear message to the selectors that he's ready if called upon.Captain Abhimanyu Easwaran had a mixed series. After a disappointing start with just 8 runs in the first innings of the opening game, he bounced back with a brisk 68 off 87 balls in the second innings. In the second unofficial Test, he was dismissed for 11 in the first innings but recovered with a gritty 80 in the second.

Bombay Sport Exchange Ep. 6: Harish Thawani on cricket's TV market and the watershed moments





Canada doesn't typically attract the focus of international football, but when it hosts its first World Cup match next year, global fans will encounter a country where the sport is thriving.Kick-off in Canada's inaugural World Cup match is set for June 12, 2026 in Toronto, a city consistently listed as one of the world's most diverse, where immigration has propelled football's rise. Data ranks football - more commonly known in Canada as soccer - as the most popular sport among Canadian youth and, while the country retains its love for ice hockey, families increasingly struggle to take part in the cherished sport, often due to cost.Majied Ali runs Toronto's Islamic Soccer League, which serves Muslim youth in Toronto's eastern Scarborough neighborhood, a historic immigrant landing spot. ""I established this league in 1996 with 34 kids,"" said Ali, who immigrated to Canada from Trinidad in 1986. ""We started with (a fee) of just $20 dollars a player,"" he told AFP, noting the current seasonal fee is a modest CAN$100 ($74).Ali said the league now counts some 1,500 players, with a waitlist, growth he ties to waves of immigration among Muslim communities.He recalled the arrival of refugees from Somalia and Kosovo in the 1990s, followed by those who fled conflicts in Afghanistan and Syria. ""Over the years, we've seen an explosion of diversity,"" said Ali.A 2024 report from the Jumpstart foundation which tracks youth sport participation across Canada found ""soccer is consistently the most popular sport played."" The finding applied to all demographic groups, excluding youth with disabilities.Overall, 62 percent of Canada's youth reported playing football more than once over the past three years, with swimming second at 44 percent. While football has established broad popularity, the Jumpstart report makes clear there remains a racial and ethnic component to participation in the sport.In a breakdown of preference by race and ethnicity, Jumpstart found 76 percent of Arab youth in Canada listed football as their top choice, followed by South Asians (69 percent), with white people coming sixth on the list at 58 percent.The rise of football has also coincided with declines in youth hockey participation. ""Soccer is cheaper than hockey with less equipment,"" said Dave Cooper, an associate professor (emeritus) of physical education at the University of Toronto.The Jumpstart report listed hockey fifth among participation rates with data indicating the rate of young Canadians who play hockey has declined 33 percent over the last 15 years.Erik Wexler runs the youth sports program at Woodgreen, a Toronto social services organization. The program caters to low income families, especially new immigrants, and has focused on football and basketball because, he said, that is ""what people are asking for.""""We're not just arbitrarily selecting a sport,"" he said. ""We know where the energy is."" Wexler told AFP football has proven to be an ideal avenue to offer immigrants a sense of community in their new home.He regularly encounters parents working multiple jobs and living in apartments packed with more than one family - people who may not have the capacity to organize extra-curricular sports for their children.They pounce at the opportunity to put their kids in a familiar sport, Wexler said. ""I've never seen more appreciative people in my life.""Despite being a year away, Wexler said the youth he encounters know the World Cup is coming and the tournament, which it is co-hosting with the United States and Mexico, offers a chance to take the momentum of football in Canada ""to the next level.""Canadian interest in the World Cup has risen in recent years, with people supporting teams for which they have a family connection - or in 2022, Canada directly, after the national side and its star player Alphonso Davies qualified for the Qatar tournament following a 36-year World Cup absence.But next summer will mark an unprecedented moment for Canada, Cooper said. ""We haven't hosted anything like this before."" Apart from in Toronto, World Cup matches will also be played in Vancouver.",2026 FIFA World Cup in Canada has generated a change in popularity in the sport. 62 percent of Canada's youth reported playing football more than once over the past three years.

""We don't believe sport can solve all the issues in the world,"" US Soccer chief Sunil Gulati told an audience at a Manhattan skyscraper.""But ... we believe this is a hugely positive signal and symbol of what we can do together in unifying people, especially in our three countries.""Fast forward eight years, and the soaring optimism that accompanied the bid's launch in 2017 has run into some stiff geopolitical headwinds, the re-election of President Donald Trump casting a pall of uncertainty over preparations for the event in ways that few could have imagined.While Trump has been a staunch backer of the World Cup from the outset, the US leader has nevertheless taken a combative stance to co-hosts Mexico and Canada since returning to the White House, from trade wars to border crackdowns, while simultaneously calling for Canada to become the ""cherished 51st state"" of the US.That in turn has led to Canada's Prime Minister Mark Carney vowing to pivot away from the US, declaring in March that ""the old relationship we had with the United States - based on deepening integration of our economies and tight security and military cooperation - is over.""Trump, who enjoys a close friendship with Gianni Infantino, the president of world football's governing body FIFA, the organisers of the World Cup, has laughed off suggestions that trade turmoil could impact the tournament.""Tension's a good thing, I think it makes it much more exciting,"" Trump said in March when asked how his administration's tariffs against Canada and Mexico might affect the World Cup. Trump's policies, though, already appear to be hurting US tourism, with hotel search site Trivago last month reporting double-digit percentage declines in bookings to the US from visitors from Japan, Canada and Mexico.Figures from the US government's National Travel and Tourism Office released in April found an 11.6% decline in visits to the US from overseas in March compared to a year earlier.Andrew Zimbalist, an economics professor at Smith College in Northampton, Massachussetts whose books include ""Circus Maximus: The Economic Gamble Behind Hosting the Olympics and the World Cup"", believes Trump's economic policies could reduce the number of international fans travelling to the World Cup.But, Zimbalist added, ""in terms of the actual playing of the games, the tariffs don't affect athletes."" ""So unless the political situation internationally deteriorates further and people decide to boycott the games in large numbers, I wouldn't anticipate a very large impact,"" he told AFP.Other commentators have questioned whether World Cup fans will be deterred by the Trump administration's hardline border crackdown, which has seen visitors from countries including France, Germany, Australia and Canada either turned away at the border or subjected to harsh interrogation and detention.""Will soccer fans really want to crisscross our borders right now - and be squinted at by guards simply because they speak a Romance language or risk being held on a cold floor in a detention cage?,"" Washington Post columnist Sally Jenkins asked recently.The Trump administration's 2026 World Cup Task Force last month insisted all fans would be welcome, saying football supporters could look forward to a ""seamless experience"" when visiting the US.Vice President JD Vance though cautioned that foreign visitors would have to leave at the end of the tournament. ""We'll have visitors, probably from close to 100 countries,"" said Vance, the vice-chair of the World Cup task force. ""We want them to come. We want them to celebrate. But when the time is up, they'll have to go home.""John Zerafa, a Britain-based sports communications strategist, believes the Trump administration may need to ""short circuit"" current visa processing wait times in order to facilitate large numbers of foreign fans at the World Cup. ""I think the US and the Trump administration will go out of their way to try and make that process as smooth as possible,"" Zerafa told AFP.""But there's also the other part of how that stacks with the MAGA agenda and closing borders. There's a real dichotomy there for Trump and the MAGA base - you're letting the world in but at the same time you're trying to shut the world out,"" Zerafa added.""Those two things are very difficult to co-exist, and which one is going to win the day? I can certainly envisage examples of fans applying for tickets, but not being granted visas. And you only need a couple of those stories to emerge in the runup to the World Cup to start painting a difficult backdrop for FIFA and the US.","The United States, Mexico and Canada launched their joint bid for the 2026 World Cup in the shadow of the Statue of Liberty.

Bombay Sport Exchange Ep. 6: Harish Thawani on cricket's TV market and the watershed moments





The largest and most complex World Cup in history kicks off in just over a year's time, with the United States, Canada and Mexico co-hosting the football extravaganza against a backdrop of political tension triggered by Donald Trump.Forty-eight teams and millions of fans are set to descend on North America for the first ever World Cup shared by three nations, with the tournament getting under way on June 11 next year. In theory, the 23rd edition of the most popular sporting spectacle on the planet has all the makings of a successful tournament.An array of venues ranging from Mexico's iconic Estadio Azteca to the glittering $5 billion SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles will play host to 104 games spread over nearly six weeks. The United States will host the bulk of those fixtures - 78 - with Canada and Mexico staging 13 each.All games from the quarter-finals onwards will be held in the United States, with the tournament culminating in the final at New Jersey's 82,500-seater MetLife Stadium on July 19, 2026.American officials believe the return of the World Cup to the country - 32 years after the United States hosted the 1994 finals -- could represent a watershed moment for football in the country.""The World Cup is going to raise the attention of the sport in ways that nobody ever dreamed of,"" said Don Garber, the commissioner of Major League Soccer. FIFA's President Gianni Infantino meanwhile has been hyping next year's finals as the equivalent of ""104 Super Bowls"", contrasting the World Cup's estimated six billion viewers to the 120 million or so who tune in for the climax of the NFL season.There are historical precedents which suggest the hype might be justified. The 1994 World Cup in the United States remains the best attended World Cup in history, with an average of 68,600 fans flocking to each game. Yet while organisers eagerly anticipate a commercial success, with one FIFA estimate suggesting it could generate a mammoth $11 billion in revenues, questions over other aspects of the tournament remain.The 48 teams - up from 32 in 2022 - will be spread into 12 groups of four, with the top two teams in each group advancing to the knockout rounds, and the eight best third-placed teams joining them to make up a last 32.That expansion is likely to reduce the sense of jeopardy in the first round, a problem seen in other major championships which have increased in size in recent years.There is also the question of how the polarising policies of US President Trump may impact the tournament.Since taking office, Trump has launched a global trade war, repeatedly threatened to annex World Cup co-host Canada and launched an immigration crackdown at US borders which has seen overseas visitors from countries like France, Britain, Germany and Australia either detained or denied entry in recent months.Trump this week signed a travel ban on 12 countries including Iran, who have qualified for the World Cup, but the ban will not apply to players taking part in the tournament. Trump, who is chairman of a White House task force overseeing preparations for the World Cup, says overseas fans travelling to the tournament have nothing to fear.""Every part of the US government will be working to ensure that these events are safe and successful, and those traveling to America to watch the competition have a seamless experience during every part of their visit,"" Trump said last month. FIFA chief Infantino, who has forged a close relationship with Trump, echoed that point, insisting that America was ready to ""welcome the world.""""Everyone who wants to come here to enjoy, to have fun, to celebrate the game will be able to do that,"" Infantino said. With one year to go however, it is by no means clear that Infantino's pledge will hold up.US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said last month that some embassy staff may be required to work double-shifts to expedite visa processing, citing the example of Colombia, where US visa wait times are currently 15 months. ""If you haven't applied for a visa from Colombia already, you probably won't get here in time for the World Cup unless we go to double shifts,"" Rubio told lawmakers on Capitol Hill.Those fans who do make the trip to North America may also find themselves having to fork out a small fortune due to FIFA's reported decision to use dynamic pricing to determine ticket prices. That system, where prices on ticketing websites fluctuate according to demand, may well force fans to shell out thousands of dollars to obtain tickets for the highest profile games.""Dynamic pricing does not belong in football because it is an exploitation of fans' loyalty,"" Ronan Evain, the executive director of the Football Supporters Europe fan group told The Times. ""It would be a fiasco for FIFA to use it for the World Cup.""","The 2026 FIFA World Cup kicks off on a year from now, on June 11.

Bombay Sport Exchange Ep. 6: Harish Thawani on cricket's TV market and the watershed moments





Decades after hosting victories by Pele's Brazil and Diego Maradona's Argentina, Mexico City's legendary Azteca Stadium is undergoing a major revamp as it prepares to feature in an unprecedented third World Cup.Mexico's previous World Cups are widely regarded as two of the best ever, evoking the magic of Pele and the 1970 Brazil team and the genius of Maradona in the 1986 tournament won by Argentina. But the Azteca's glory has since faded, leaving the six-decade-old stadium in need of an overhaul before the 2026 World Cup, which Mexico will co-host with the United States and Canada.Construction has progressed ""considerably,"" according to officials at the stadium, which will be the venue for five World Cup matches including the opening clash on June 11. With much of the renovation kept under wraps, even the man who oversaw the original construction of what he calls ""an icon of Mexican architecture and engineering"" is unsure what to expect.""I have no idea what it's going to look like, but I hope it turns out very well,"" architect Luis Martinez del Campo told AFP.For the 2026 World Cup, FIFA required more comfortable seating, Wi-Fi for spectators, and hybrid turf made from a combination of natural grass and synthetic fibers.The capacity will increase from 83,264 to 90,000. A major improvement will be a new players' tunnel.""The stadium only has one flaw that we knew about since we were designing it,"" said Martinez del Campo, now 90. Due to the location of a water drain, players previously arrived from the locker rooms through a tunnel behind the goal. Next year, they will burst into view at the side of the pitch.In February, the stadium's owner, Grupo Ollamani, revealed that investment in remodelling the venue had reached nearly $80 million. The next month, Ollamani said that it had agreed to rename the stadium after the Banorte bank in return for more than $100 million to continue the renovation.T he sponsorship deal means the venue will be called Banorte Stadium for 12 years, to the dismay of fans.Martinez del Campo believes that while the Azteca Stadium name is ""timeless,"" anyone who invests a lot of money in the venue ""deserves to have their name on it.""Since FIFA does not allow commercial names on stadiums during championships, it will be called Mexico City Stadium during the World Cup.Controversy also surrounds the luxury boxes and seats that people bought to finance the stadium's construction, giving them the right to attend all the events there for 99 years after its inauguration in 1966.During the 1970 and 1986 World Cups, box and seat owners were allowed to attend matches, but FIFA wants to have access to all the seats by 2026. An association of box and seat owners is negotiating with stadium officials to defend its rights.The Azteca Stadium has hosted a record 19 World Cup matches, which will increase to 24 next year, including a third opening match. In the northern city of Monterrey, the remodeling continues at the BBVA Stadium, which will host four matches. The revamp required three major improvements, Alberto Molina, director of operations for local team C.F. Monterrey, told AFP.The pitch will also have a hybrid turf that workers aim to lay by next month, Molina said. The overhaul, which also includes remodeling the VIP boxes and expanding the press area, is on track to be completed this year, Molina said.At the Akron Stadium in Guadalajara, which will also host four matches, a revamp involves new lighting and sound systems, high-speed Wi-Fi and hybrid turf.The city, located in one of Mexico's most crime-plagued states, will deploy several thousand police officers to provide security during the World Cup.","Mexico City's iconic Azteca Stadium is undergoing a major revamp for the 2026 World Cup.

Jobe Bellingham, the 19-year-old midfielder and younger brother of Real Madrid star Jude Bellingham, has signed a five-year contract with Borussia Dortmund on Tuesday. He joins the German club from Sunderland, following his brother's path who developed into one of the world's top midfielders at Dortmund before moving to Real Madrid in 2023.The young midfielder chose Dortmund over an offer from Eintracht Frankfurt, making his move shortly after helping Sunderland secure promotion to the Premier League through the playoff final.""Jobe is an extremely talented footballer with an impressive level of maturity and intelligence on the pitch for someone so young.

Is the FIFA World Cup becoming too “commercialised”? Fans believe so and are furious about it

The FIFA World Cup Final is all set to become bigger and more entertaining as Doja Cat, Tems and J Balvin are all scheduled to hit the stage on 13th July at the MetLife Stadium in New Jersey for the halftime show. FIFA and Global Citizen made this special announcement on Monday and while fans are excited to watch the three artists perform, the announcement has sparked outrage among a few fans.As soon as the announcement was made on Monday, many fans felt that the FIFA World Cup was losing its “authenticity”.A fan took to X and wrote, “The Americanization and full blown commercialization of football. This is the beginning of the end of football as we knew it, while another fan wrote, “Nah man , why always ruin sporting events with this bs?”A third fan commented, “Wanna be America so bad”, while another user posted, “Half time show in a football match, especially a WC final ? Utter woke nonsense”.A fifth fan noted, “Now why did the FIFA president think it’s a good idea to introduce half time shows in football? Like wtf smh 🤦🏽‍♂️”At this point in time, neither the three artists nor FIFA and Global Citizen have addressed the criticism the announcement has received.The FIFA World Cup Final Halftime Show will be curated by Chris Martin and has a pretty noble aim - the FIFA Global Citizen Education Fund.

American World Cup host city officials assured Monday that overseas fans would be welcome at next year's tournament in the United States, Canada and Mexico despite ""uncertainty"" amid ongoing concerns over visas, border controls and social unrest.In a briefing in New York that came just over a year from the opening game of the tournament on June 11, 2026, officials said President Donald Trump's administration remained ""extremely supportive"" of the World Cup.Since returning to power, Trump has started a global trade war, threatened to annex Canada and launched a border crackdown that has led to harsh treatment of foreign visitors attempting to enter the United States. Trump's immigration offensive has in turn led to civil unrest, with clashes in Los Angeles over the weekend triggered by large-scale raids last week.Eleven American cities will host the bulk of the games at next year's World Cup, which is being co-hosted by three nations for the first time and has been expanded to include 48 teams. Executives from the local organising committees for the 11 US World Cup venues gathered in New York on Monday to brief on logistical aspects of the tournament, including transportation, stadium access, fan zones as well as general access to the United States.""For each of our cities, we want to be prepared to make any person that is coming and makes the decision to come to the United States or come to this World Cup feel that they are welcome,"" said Meg Kane, head of the Philadelphia organising committee.Kane said while officials were planning ""within uncertainty"" due to matters taking place at national and international level, the Trump administration was firmly behind the tournament.""We do not play a role necessarily in what is happening in terms of the decisions that are made,"" Kane said. ""What we can say is that the current administration - while there are certain situations that we are monitoring closely - has been extremely supportive of FIFA World Cup .""Alex Lasry, the chief executive of the New York/New Jersey World Cup committee said officials were bracing for ""millions"" of fans inside and outside the stadiums irrespective of the political climate. ""I think sports transcends geopolitics,"" Lasry told AFP. ""I think we've seen that for Olympics. We've seen it for other World Cups, in Qatar or Russia.""People want to come to these mega sporting events, and they're going to travel to ensure that they're able to cheer on and see their team play.

Lucas Di Grassi on taking part in Formula E races in Tokyo and Shanghai



Lucas Di Grassi on his performance this season and his future plans





Lola Yamaha ABT driver Lucas Di Grassi has finally shared his experience of racing in Tokyo and Shanghai. He stood fifth in the Round 9 race in Tokyo, which was his best performance in the four races held in the two cities. Sharing a video on Instagram, Di Grassi has now spoken about taking part in the two double headers and how he scored 30 points this season while his teammate Zane Maloney is still evolving as a Formula E driver.Talking about the two double headers and the Round 8 race, in which he finished 17th, Lucas Di Grassi said in the video, “Tokyo, the most congested circuit of the year, and Shanghai, the track that everyone knows from Formula 1, with a shortcut, a short version, but a high-speed track. And two interesting results. Tokyo, the first race was in the rain, they canceled qualifying, we ended up washing up at the back, because they used the result of Free Practice 2, anyway, they canceled qualifying, so we started at the back and stayed at the back, the way it was, you can't even see a meter in front. It was a very difficult thing.”Di Grassi also talked in detail about the Round 9 race in Tokyo in which he gained 5th position.He said, “In race 2, we were very fast in the dry. In qualifying, I was the fastest in the group, even with the Lola Yamaha car that is still under development. So it was the best qualifying of the year in terms of results, P1 in the group, ahead of Nato, ahead of a group that has a well-developed car, so it was very good. In the race, we ended up fighting for the top 10 and ended up finishing in fifth place, getting 10 points in Tokyo.“It was very important at Yamaha's home, with the Yamaha guys there. Yamaha is increasingly involved in the championship, increasingly involved in our team, putting a lot of resources, especially for the 4th generation, which is next year and the year after. So, it was a very important race,” he added.Lucas Di Grassi called the Shanghai race the opposite of Tokyo. He finished 18th in Round 10 and 9th in the Round 11 race in Shanghai.Lucas Di Grassi is currently in the 16th position in the 2025 Formula E Driver Standings. He summed up his Formula E season with Lola Yamaha ABT so far and said, “So we've already accumulated 30 points this year with the team. I scored all of the points. Zane Maloney is still learning and evolving. It's very fast, but it still needs to evolve in terms of Formula E experience. So, we have 30 points, six times, seven times more than I had last year with Mahindra. So, the team is evolving. Even though it's the first year, we're moving forward.”Di Grassi is all pepped up for the next five races. Talking about the Jakarta E-Prix and the following races in Berlin and London, he said, “I have to say that we have been working hard. Next week there will be a test. The week after that, we will travel to Jakarta. So, we will go full force in these last five stages of the championship, trying to get another podium or at least score points, get a lot of points in these next stages.

I'm not going to become conservative, because I've seen many sports over the years, and how pressure, thinking about these things or trying to engineer them too much can actually be a downfall.I'm going to go out there and race just as I have been from the beginning of the season, and hopefully we can keep the results up. My current goal is to extend to the point where it makes things quite easy at the end [of the season].""Also Read: Shanghai E-Prix 2025: DS celebrates double victory as Maximilian Gunther takes first, Jean-Eric Vergne second in Round 10, Taylor Barnard claims third On the personal front, Rowland is now going to be a father for the second time.

Norman Nato had shared pictures with F1 friends







Norman Nato currently competes for Nissan in Formula E. He was earlier a part of Andretti before joining Nissan last year. This season has been dull for the Formula E driver, as even after he won a race, the results underwent an overhaul to implement penalties, which ended up costing him his position. Before he gets back on the track, here’s a throwback from one of his eventful days with some Formula 1 drivers.Two years back, Norman Nato joined Formula 1 champions Max Verstappen and Charles Leclerc for a game of padel, and pictures from the day prove he even won a trophy for his performance in the game.Nato had shared a few pictures from their game of padel on Instagram in October of 2023 and wrote in the caption: “Great fun playing in the very first @alltime.mc padel tournament together with athletes from all different sports and backgrounds. A lot of fun and just a little bit of competition… #padel.”The pictures show Ferrari driver Charles Leclerc, Red Bull driver Max Verstappen, and Nissan driver Norman Nato posing with racquets during a game of padel. A picture also shows Verstappen and Nato posing with their trophies.Fans of the three racing drivers were surprised to see them together. A fan had commented on the pictures, “Max using that Head Extreme One racket as a beginner is wild...Even the number 1 player of the world (Arturo Coello) avoids that racket.” Another had written, “no competition here.” One more said, “Personally, I think we need more video evidence of this happening.”Leclerc and Nato are close friends. Once, Norman Nato accompanied Charles Leclerc and his family to Ibiza for a group holiday. They all had a lot of fun in the picturesque location and had Nato posing shirtless under the Ibiza sun in several pictures from the location on Instagram.Also Read: Tokyo E-Prix 2025: Norman Nato tops First Free Practice, Taylor Barnard suffers a crash At present, Nato will be prepping for the upcoming Jakarta E-Prix, scheduled from June 19–21.

Pascal Wehrlein on winning in Shanghai

TAG Heuer Porsche gained big in Shanghai





TAG Heuer Porsche driver Pascal Wehrlein gained no points on Day 1 of the Shanghai E-Prix last weekend. However, the Formula E driver was able to turn the tables in a rainy race the next day and claim second place on the podium. After the race, he confirmed that the result made him realise they were actually competitive on a wet track.Pascal Wehrlein secured second place in the Round 11 race in Shanghai, with his teammate Antonio Felix Da Costa joining him on the podium in third. The two had started in the same positions on the grid but in reverse order. It was, nevertheless, a double gain for Porsche on Sunday.Talking about the Round 11 race, Wehrlein said, “Very tricky conditions especially in the beginning, I think it got a little bit better towards the end, but our pace was good. Not good enough for P1, but quite far ahead of the guys behind. Personally I’m very happy about the result today because today was the first time that I felt like we were very competitive in the wet, which wasn’t the case in Tokyo and Monaco. I think we’ve found a good way there and in the end a happy ending for us. ”The two also scored double podiums at the Mexico E-Prix and then again in Miami, where Wehrlein won. He earned another podium at the Tokyo E-Prix.With such a strong performance this year, Wehrlein currently holds second place in the Formula E Driver Standings with 103 points.“It was a very strong result today in very tricky and challenging wet conditions,” Porsche Formula E boss Florian Modlinger stated after the double podium in Round 11. The 34 points earned from the results, plus the fastest lap by Wehrlein, also promoted Porsche to the top of the Teams’ World Championship—by a single point ahead of Nissan.“We are really happy with these points and regaining the lead in the Teams’ Championship by a single point. It will be a very hard fight to the end of the year. Overall – with three Porsche in the top six with Nico Mueller – we can be very happy,” Modlinger added.Also Read: Nick Cassidy on winning Round 11 race at Shanghai E-Prix: “It feels like we’ve been waiting a long time” Wehrlein and Da Costa will now be eyeing more such wins, with five more races remaining before the Formula E season wraps up for the year.

George Russell hinted at Dan Ticktum while commenting on Spanish Grand Prix incident

Dan Ticktum responds to George Russell’s remark





Cupra Kiro driver Dan Ticktum has reacted to Formula 1 driver George Russell’s “one British driver in Formula E” mention when the latter was asked if he had ever seen a driver who did what F1 champion Max Verstappen did, that is, deliberately hitting another during a race. Ticktum responded to Russell’s remark by thanking him for “free publicity” and likening himself to none other than Verstappen, who is currently the reigning number 1 champion in Formula 1.Red Bull driver Max Verstappen was handed a 10-second penalty during the race and a three-point penalty on his licence for hitting George Russell’s Mercedes during the Spanish Grand Prix. One more mistake and he can face a one-race ban. When Russell was asked if he had seen any other driver do such a thing, he told the media, ""Not in Formula 1. Maybe in Formula E. Maybe one British driver in Formula E.”Dan Ticktum took note of Russell’s mention. Ticktum had received a two-year ban for deliberately hitting another driver during an MSA Formula (now British F4) race. He recently clinched his first podium of the season at the Tokyo E-Prix.Taking to Instagram to share a recorded response to Russell’s remark, Ticktum said, ""I have just had a very nice evening with the team and some of the guys from Porsche here in Shanghai.I’m just on the way back to the hotel. It has come to my attention via the Twittersphere that a certain driver in Formula 1 - not to name names but his name is George Russell - has made some rather choice comments about a certain Formula E driver. ”Thanking Russell for the mention, he further said, ""He hasn't named my name, but it's quite obviously pointed at me. We'd like to address those comments that he made I believe on the team radio. Number one, thank you for the free publicity. We'll take that any day of the week. And two, while what Max did today was a little bit sceptical, to be likened to him at any point in my career is a positive if you ask me.

Former US Open champion Emma Raducanu stole the spotlight as women's tennis made a historic return to Queen's Club for the first time in 52 years on Monday.With the dust barely settled from the thrilling French Open titles won by Carlos Alcaraz and Coco Gauff last weekend, Queen's marks the transition to grass courts and this year's event is a milestone moment in the tennis calendar.Since 1973, Queen's has been solely an ATP event.But a ground-breaking deal was struck last year to play a WTA 500 tournament in Barons Court before the men compete from June 16.Reigning Wimbledon champion Barbora Krejcikova, Australian Open holder Madison Keys, 2022 Wimbledon winner Elena Rybakina and world number five Zheng Qinwen are among the female stars set to feature at Queen's this week.But Raducanu, who famously won the US Open as an 18-year-old qualifier in 2021, was the headline act on opening day.Fans queued for an hour to see the British star partnered with Katie Boulter in their 6-4, 6-2 first round doubles win over Jiang Xinyu and Wu Feng-Hsien.Raducanu, who faces Cristina Bucsa in the singles first round on Tuesday, enjoyed the experience on the intimate Court One, bantering with Boulter and even laughing with spectators.""I love playing on those smaller courts where you really feel the support and crowd gets into it,"" she said.""I was filling my bottle up and I was literally having a chat in the stands because that's how close it is. It puts a really nice feel to it.""Raducanu, who has struggled with poor form and back spasms this year, looked reinvigorated alongside Boulter.It was an especially memorable afternoon for Raducanu after her visits to Queen's as a child.""When I came with my dad, I was more hunting the (chocolate) brownies around the grounds and not so interested in the tennis! To be back now and competing in it feels amazing,"" the world number 37 said.Fittingly, Queen's centre court was officially renamed the Andy Murray Arena on Monday in tribute to the retired Scot's five titles in the men's event.Former world number one Murray has been an vocal advocate of women's tennis and was coached as a boy by Russian Olga Morozova, who was the last female Queen's champion in 1973.""Having women's tennis back at Queen's for the first time in over 50 years is brilliant,"" the two-time Wimbledon winner said.""I just met the last winner here, Olga Morozova, who actually coached me when I was 12, 13 years old.""It's a great chance for women to showcase themselves out there.""When Morozova triumphed over half a century ago, the tournament was much different.Players arrived on the London underground, rain forced matches to be moved indoors on to a wooden court and the champion received just £1,000 ($1,353) in prize money.Sunday's final winner will bank a cheque for £120,000, but the total prize money fund for the women's tournament is only £1.043 million, while the men's event has a £2.122 million pot.Responding to criticism of that disparity, the Lawn Tennis Association pledged to have equal prize money at Queen's by 2029.Despite the awkward prize money optics, the mood at Queen's was resolutely upbeat.""It's a seminal moment, given it's the first time we've had a women's tournament in London for more than 50 years,"" LTA managing director Chris Pollard said.""In many respects it's long overdue.""Over 80 percent of the tickets for the week have been sold, with fans treated to a dramatic first round loss for former Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova.Kvitova, who became a mother for the first time last year, was beaten 2-6, 6-4, 6-4 by Brazil's Beatriz Haddad Maia.The 35-year-old Czech has lost six of her seven matches since returning from maternity leave in February.""It's a privilege to be here,"" Haddad Maia said.""This club is very special and it means a lot to be on this stadium in front of everyone who loves tennis.""","Women's tennis returns to Queen's Club for the first time in 52 years. Former US Open champion Emma Raducanu is headline act on opening day. Wimbledon champion Barbora Krejcikova, Madison Keys and Elena Rybakina also playing.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121744196,imgsize-59682,width-400,resizemode-4/121744196.jpg"

Carlos Alcaraz’s win over Jannik Sinner in the French Open final is the 24th time in men’s tennis that the eventual winner bounced back from two sets down to lift a Major trophy. It’s only the eighth such instance in the Open era, 1968 onward, and six of them have now come on the famous ‘terre battue’ of Paris. A look at five such epic Grand Slam finals…Returning from surgery, Nadal had no business playing at Melbourne Park, let alone reaching the final. With Federer semi-retired and Novak Djokovic deported after disobeying Covid protocols, Nadal had a chance to move ahead of Federer on Major title count. He employed his full repertoire of shots to bamboozle Medvedev.World No. 1 McEnroe came into the final on a 42-match winning streak. Lendl had lost to McEnroe in their last four clashes and had lost all his four Major finals until then. McEnroe took the first two sets with authority but in the third game of the third set, noise from a cameraman’s earpiece set him off and in his fury, he dropped his serve.Momentum shifted in Lendl’s favour, who held his nerve.Agassi had lost two finals here, to Andres Gomez in 1990 and Jim Courier in 1991. Medvedev was ranked 100 but had a strong clay-court game and had beaten Pete Sampras and Gustav Kuerten on way to the final. He even won the first two sets, winning 100% of his first serve points. Then came the rain. When play resumed, Agassi found his rhythm and became the first man to win four Slams on three different surfaces.Down two sets to nil, Novak took a lengthy toilet break. He says he heard two voices in his head: one told him it was over, the other he could still pull it off. He returned, produced sublime tennis in the following three sets for his 2nd French title, second career Slam.Played during the pandemic to empty galleries, the win from two sets, 3-5 down made Thiem the second Austrian after Thomas Muster (1995 French Open) to become a Major winner. Federer was injured, Nadal had opted out, Djokovic defaulted in Rd 4 and Thiem and Zverev both failed to serve it out for the title in the deciding set. It was the first US Open men’s singles final to be decided by a fifth-set tiebreak.",Carlos Alcaraz’s win over Jannik Sinner in the French Open final is the 24th time in men's tennis that the eventual winner bounced back from two sets down to lift a Major trophy.

Bombay Sport Exchange Ep. 6: Harish Thawani on cricket's TV market and the watershed moments





There was talk from Day 1, but Sunday night was the perfect catalyst for the tennis world to go into a tizzy. At 22, Rafael Nadal had won five Grand Slam titles and when Carlos Alcaraz did the same by outlasting Jannik Sinner at Rafa's ‘home' Roland Garros, the comparison calls became louder.""It is a stat that I am going to keep for me forever, winning the fifth Grand Slam at the same time as Rafa – my idol, my inspiration. It's a huge honour,"" Alcaraz said after the five-and-a-half-hour epic.Both are Spaniards, both share a never-say-die attitude, both are die-hard Real Madrid fans. The surface similarities between the two are many. So much so that the Rafa loyalist over a decade and a half feels Alcaraz is a natural heir to his throne of the heart.But is it that simple? Are Nadal and Alcaraz cut out of the same cloth? The answer is probably ‘no'.Nadal came at a time when the world was in awe of the jaw-dropping beauty of Roger Federer . The victories were becoming routine when this Spanish matador rocked the citadel of tennis with incredible ability to endure. Federer, who had grown up on Swiss clay and believed till 2005 that it was a matter of time before he won the French, suddenly didn't know how to get past his young nemesis on the red clay of Paris.It was a riddle that Federer never solved — he beat Rafa on other surfaces, but never at Roland Garros.Nadal won 14 French Open titles — a record that is unlikely to be broken — and it had a lot to do with the different facets of his game that he went on adding to his basic repertoire of being an unbelievable retriever. But to start off, the myth of Rafa began as a counterpoint to the elegance of Federer.That's a fundamental difference between Alcaraz and Nadal. The Murica boy appeared on the big stage almost as a saviour in early 2022 when Federer was all but gone, Nadal was in a decline and Novak Djokovic was the untouchable master. Tennis was getting slightly unidimensional, and it needed the gold dust of artistry to keep it enticing for the consumer pampered by the Swiss-Spanish royalty for close to two decades.""The basic difference between Nadal and Alcaraz is that the latter is as good on any surface as he is on clay. His first Slam came on the hard courts of the US Open. He conquered grass when nobody expected him to do so, and now he is a two-time French Open champion. On the other hand, Rafa's first four Grand Slam titles were all at Roland Garros, till the 2008 Wimbledon final happened,"" Indian legend Ramesh Krishnan told TOI.While Nadal became an extremely reliable volleyer and kept on adding new shots and facets to his game, the 22-Slam winner's core strength was his ability to defend on slightly slower surfaces. Alcaraz, on the other hand, even as a teenager, was a combination of attack and defence – his ability to play outrageous winners has been the cornerstone of some of his best moments so far. Be it his drop shot down 0-30 serving for the match against Novak Djokovic in 2023 Wimbledon final or his ability to pull winners out of his bag in the final set tiebreak on Sunday, Alcaraz was more Federer than Nadal for the tennis tragic.The biggest compliment for Alcaraz probably came from the other master Djokovic, who feels that he hasn't ""played a player like him"" after the 2023 Wimbledon final loss. ""Roger and Rafa had their own strengths and weaknesses, but Carlos is an amazing player. I would say his game has the best of all three of us.""That probably sums up Alcaraz's game. And when John McEnroe said on Sunday that ""these guys (Alcaraz and Sinner) would beat Roger and Rafa in their prime"", you're left with the dilemma: ""Who would you pay to watch? Nadal or Alcaraz?Krishnan smiled at the query. ""I will probably pay to watch both.""","Carlos Alcaraz beat Jannik Sinner to win the French Open at Roland Garros.

Juan Carlos Ferrero walked the edge with Carlos Alcaraz in the French Open final. After three hours and 43 minutes of play, facing three match points, the 45-year-old felt the moment as did the full house on Court Philippe Chatrier.At 3-5, 0-40 in the fourth set a veil of silence descended on the arena as Alcaraz was getting ready to serve. The 22-year-old looked at Ferrero, his long-time coach. “It was like he was saying, I’m still here,” Ferrero said, “I’m not saying that I believed he would recover from 3-5, love-40, but with Carlos everything is possible.”The word Ferrero was looking for was ‘attitude’, which when translated to body language spelt ‘vamos’.Not long after Ferrero had exited the media room, the world No. 2 — who had scripted that awe-inspiring 4-6, 6-7 (4), 6-4, 7-6 (3), 7-6 (10-2) win over the world No. 1 Jannik Sinner to claim his fifth Grand Slam title — was asked if he believed he was in the match when staring down the barrel.“Absolutely,” Alcaraz said. “The match was not finished, it’s one point from losing the match. A lot of times people come back from match point down in the final of Grand Slams.I wanted to be one of those players, who saved match points in a Grand Slam final and ended up winning.”Some of Alcaraz’s winners in the business end of the fifth set as he attempted to put the finishing touches to one of the greatest fightbacks in the sport were electric, it charged the crowd, and defined the exchange. The Spaniard had 70 in the match.The first Grand Slam men’s championship match between two players born in the 2000s made history, turning into the longest Roland Garros final on record at five hours and 29 minutes, the second longest of Major finals after the 2012 Australian Open that lasted five-hours and 53-minutes.Alcaraz had the spectators — nearly 15,000-strong on Chatrier, including celebrities from the entertainment industry and the world of sport, young fans and seasoned spectators — gasping, thumping their palms and jumping up on their feet and screaming ‘Carlitos, Carlitos, Carlitos’. The chant is fast becoming a crowd favourite wherever he plays.The Spaniard, who won his first Major crown at the 2022 US Open as a 19-year-old, has now won at least one Slam in four consecutive seasons.The world No. 2, who was propelled into the contest by the energy of the crowd in the early part of the match when Sinner looked to be running away with it, thanked fans by playing his best tennis on the home stretch, the 12th game of the fifth set and the match tie-break. He pulled off winners from impossible positions, finding angles where most players would only see lines.“I had to go for it no matter what, no matter if I was down, no matter if it was the super tiebreak,” Alcaraz said of his decision to accelerate, which was exactly what the Italian failed to do when he had the match points. “I thought it was time to go for it, not be afraid of mistakes. That’s why I (played) my best tennis in crucial moments, at 6-5 in the fifth. I still don’t know how I did it. I still don’t know how I saved that game. ”At 22 years and 34 days old, Alcaraz became the third-youngest man to win five Grand Slam titles in history. He trails Bjorn Borg (22 years, 5 days) and Rafael Nadal (22 years, 33 days).“The coincidence of winning my fifth Grand Slam in the same age as Rafa Nadal, I’m going to say that’s destiny,” Alcaraz said. “It is a stat I’m going to keep with me forever, winning the fifth Grand Slam at the same time as Rafa, my idol, my inspiration is a huge honour.”Alcaraz, who became the ninth man in the Open Era to come from two sets down in a Major final, has rallied twice before from difficult situations in Grand Slam finals.“I prefer to win in three sets,” the champion said smiling. “But when the situation is against you, you have to keep fighting. It is a Grand Slam final, it’s no time to be tired, it’s no time to give up. The real champions are made in those situations when you deal with that pressure.”Alcaraz should know.",Carlos Alcaraz beat world No. 1 Jannik Sinner in five sets to win the French Open. The Spaniard saved three match points in the final set. The match was the longest Roland Garros final on record at five hours and 29 minutes.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121742453,imgsize-26714,width-400,resizemode-4/121742453.jpg"

: Carlos Alcaraz fell on his back where he lay, looking up at Paris’ early evening sky. He had taken all of five-hours and 29-minutes to defend his French Open title, collecting his second Coupe des Mousquetaires trophy.The Spaniard – a whole new vibe for the sport, muscular frame and expressive play - battled back from the brink, saving three match points in the fourth set, then overcame a wobble in the fifth to claim his fifth Major title, he remained unbeaten in Major finals. The world No.2 scored a 4-6, 6-7 (4), 6-4, 7-6 (3), 7-6 (10-2) win over No.1 Jannik Sinner.The first Grand Slam men’s championship match between two players born in 2000s – 21 months apart, and polar opposites in play and personality, the ice and spice of the sport – was one for the ages.It was to those notes that the French Open final teed off too on a cold, windy afternoon, with the first game of the match lasting all of 12 minutes. Sinner warded off three breakpoints in the game as the afternoon was poised to stretch into a long evening.Alcaraz, who appeared to have some trouble with his eyes in the first set, perhaps some specks of clay had got in the way, had the trainer attend to it. When play resumed Sinner closed out the set.Sinner, who looked more settled in the second set, opened up his arms, striking the ball freely, took a 3-0 lead. The Spaniard, who was entertaining the crowd with his tennis, even overruled a call on Sinner’s serve, giving the Italian the point.In the tie-break, Sinner jumped ahead 6-2, but the crowd, near 15,000 and almost all of it for the Spaniard, egged Alcaraz, who responded with the brilliance only he is capable of crafting, mixing powerful play with caressing drop shots, to narrow the lead, but Sinner dug deep.The Italian struck right back. While the 23-year-old Italian doesn’t give much away by way of expression, the glances he throws at his box, at the end of virtually every point is hard to miss. Where his team is seated, is his lighthouse. It is where he turns for support and direction.In the third set, Sinner broke in the opening game, but Alcaraz won the next four to take a 4-1 lead much to the delight of the full house, who screamed themselves hoarse with calls of, come on Carlos, erupting in a wildfire of cheer.","Carlos Alcaraz beat Jannik Sinner 4-6, 6-7 (4), 6-4, 7-6 (3), 7- 6 (10-2) in the French Open final at Roland Garros.

Poll Who do you think deserved to win the French Open final? Aryna Sabalenka Coco Gauff

Gauff disagrees

Gauff





World No.1 Aryna Sabalenka, devastated at losing the French Open final, refused to give credit to the champion Coco Gauff in her post-match press conference, looking at it as a final she lost rather than one the world No.2 won. The champion, unsurprisingly, disagreed.: Today sometimes it felt like she was hitting the ball from the frame. Somehow magically the ball lands in the court and (you) are on the backfoot. It felt like a joke, somebody above was laughing, like, ‘Let’s see if you can handle this.’: If Iga (Swiatek) would win (over) me the other day, she would go out today and get the win.: I was making unforced errors. I think she won the match not because she played incredible, (but) just because I made all of those mistakes from easy balls.: I already have a flight booked to Mykonos and alcohol, sugar. I’m just trying to be very polite now, but there is no other word that could describe what just happened today on the court. Tequila, gummy bears, and I don’t know, swimming, being like the tourist for a couple of days.: I don’t agree with that… Last time I played - no shade to Iga or anything - I won in straight sets. I don’t think that’s a fair thing to say. The way Aryna was playing the last few weeks, she was the favourite to win. I think she was the best person that I could have played in the final. I got the hardest matchup if you go on stats alone. Obviously, Iga being a champion here, it was going to be a tough match either way. But, yeah, I think regardless of who I played, I had a good shot to win, and I definitely had that belief. You know how it played out.","Aryna Sabalenka lost in straight sets to Coco Gauff in the French Open final. The world No.1 refused to give credit to the champion in her post-match press conference.

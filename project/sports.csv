T20 World Cup: Suryakumar Yadav press conference ahead of India vs Pakistan

‘SKY’ emulates Tariq action

Practice session cut short by rain

THE TIMES OF INDIA, COLOMBO: Thirty years ago — Feb 13, 1996 to be precise — an India-Pakistan combined XI played the Sri Lankan team at the Premadasa in solidarity with the war-torn island nation ahead of the World Cup.In perhaps the only-ever actual India-Pak XI to take a cricket field, the match was an attempt to showcase that Lanka held no threat and was indeed safe to play in.Three decades later today, in this changed world of no-handshakes, that’s probably an irrelevant anecdote. Or is it?After an incredible amount of backroom negotiations, this T20 World Cup version of the India-Pakistan rivalry will finally take place in Colombo, signalling a sense of subcontinental ceasefire. The cricket bosses of all five Test-playing nations of the subcontinent, including absentee Bangladesh, are likely to be present at the Premadasa on Sunday.Even the captains of the two teams seem to have backed off from their shrill dislike of each other. Pakistan skipper Salman Ali Agha had a word or two of praise for India counterpart Suryakumar Yadav, who returned the compliment by saying, “They are a good team and are playing good cricket in this tournament.”With fans trooping in from different parts of India, the 35,000-strong ground will have a predominantly home ground feel for India.Pakistan, however, have the advantage of being in Colombo for a while, having played a couple of matches at SSC, and with an extra practice session under their belt. The fact is that the playing arena is bigger than most grounds in India and the pitch for the game is significantly slower than what SKY’s boys have played on of late at home.Both captains tried to water down the advantage factor for Pakistan. While Agha said it all came down to the performance on the day, Suryakumar said they have played in Sri Lanka many times to know what to expect. “Pakistan may have a slight advantage but we have the experience of so many tours. And we know how to play in these conditions and adjust as per the situation,” the India skipper said.Spinners and bowlers taking pace off could be key and Pakistan have played the spin quartet of mystery spinners Usman Tariq and Abrar Ahmed, left-arm finger Mohammed Nawaz and leggie Shadab Khan. It’s likely that Pakistan may drop either Shadab or Nawaz to try and fit in one pacer in Salman Mirza or Naseem Shah.The talking point, though, is spinner Usman Tariq and ‘SKY’ accepted that the mystery slinger is “out of syllabus”. “But in an exam, you can’t leave a question like that, can you,” he joked, adding that India are taking preparations to counter the 31-year-old. In fact, once the India nets started, it was Surya who emulated with Tariq’s stop-start action to Abhishek Sharma, who has recuperated well from his illness and is ready to play.Surya, incidentally, bowled a couple of match-winning spells for India when they played in Sri Lanka at the same ground in a bilateral T20 series in 2024. It remains to be seen if he turns his arm over in match-situation on Sunday.All these equations, though, can go for a toss if it rains on Sunday or if a truncated game is played. As India reached the second half of their practice session on Saturday, they were interrupted by an evening drizzle and the groundsmen immediately covered the entire ground. The forecast isn’t great for Sunday.","India take on Pakistan in the T20 World Cup in Colombo on Sunday. The match will be the first time an India-Pakistan combined XI has played in Sri Lanka.

I think they love each other's company. They're great mates. He learned an awful lot from Kieran Pollard John Wright

Hardik Pandya and partner Mahieka Sharma.

In Egyptian mythology, Atum is the primordial creator deity who arose from chaotic waters, bringing himself into existence before creating the rest of the world. In simpler terms, Atum created himself. This isn't a mythological story in the wrong section. It is about the rise, grind and survival of India's premier all-rounder, the MVP of white-ball cricket: Hardik Pandya Chaos and Hardik Pandya go hand-in-hand yet the cricketer has managed to fight the odds, shut out the outside noise and battle continuous against perception.The quirky hairdos, numerous tattoos, a unique dressing style, flashy cars and the meanest collection of exotic watches. They love him for cricket, question his choices, and troll him for his personal life. Yet, that one glance leaves a lasting impression and a warmth that instantly makes you feel at home. Hate him, troll him but you can't ignore him. Pandya is the heartbeat of India's white-ball set-up and the crucial piece that has kept the scales in balance since 2016.However, 2016 is not the key year in the Pandya story. It was the 2013-14 season of the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy and John Wright was watching one of Baroda's games from the stands.The then Mumbai Indians head coach was scouting local talent for the franchise and it was that first glance of Pandya that left a lasting impression on the New Zealander. It happened over a decade ago but the 71-year-old remembers the details as if they occurred yesterday.""I watched him for a week in the various games at BKC. He didn't get a lot of runs, but he had an attitude. He kept trying to hit it over the boundary and attack. We tried to sign him that year only as we had a gap in our squad. I think Jalaj Saxena got injured and we could have replaced him, but Hardik picked up a back injury, so we couldn't. He came to nets at Wankhede and bowled and batted. And then he got injured, so we couldn't get hold of him that year.""We got him the next year. I was lucky, you know, because I played against Kiran (More) and Kiran and I have been mates for years. And he knew a bit about him, but I loved his attitude. Yeah. I'll never forget that clip of his hip - like Virender Sehwag, which, you know, sometimes it's just a shot that you see. That was 2014, he played for us from 2015 and started winning titles with us,"" Wright tells TimesofIndia.com from New Zealand.Pandya's entry into the MI setup meant he shared the dressing room with absolute legends of the game. In that dugout, he found mentors and coaches and formed bonds that remain strong. Kieron Pollard 's entry into his life remains a defining moment of Pandya's career.In the West Indian all-rounder, Pandya found someone he could relate with, speak to and learn from. While those lessons went beyond cricket, the classes didn't start instantly but the early confidence was something which stayed with Pollard for many years.""My first thought of him, again, someone who's excited, someone who had that youthful sort of exuberance coming into sort of the unknown world, but still just being himself. And again, I think that is what took me aback because normally when guys come in into a setup like a MI, they're normally shy. But he wasn't shy. He was confident. And I think that was what, you know, took me,"" says Pollard in an exclusive chat.While the first impression was very good, Pollard took it easy with the young all-rounder. He wasn't looking too far ahead but the moment he saw Pandya navigate through the lows of his career, he made a decision. The West Indian was convinced that Pandya has the ""true mettle"" to excel at the big stage and ""made for the big times.""""I think it took a couple of years for me to actually make that determination in terms of 'he's cut out for it' because he had highs and then he had some lows. And that's where you can actually see the true mettle of an individual because it tends to happen. You have a one good season and then that's it for some guys. But the manner in which he went through his highs and lows, is sort of proof to myself that he has what it takes. And again, for us, we spent a lot of time together.""He spent a lot of time chatting about cricket, about life, you know, brains and stuff like that. And so all of these things as well, after it has been taken in and then you see the expressiveness on the field, again, that's when you really realise, okay, this guy, he's made for the big times,"" explains Pollard.During his early days in the MI set-up, Wright noticed the growing closeness between Pandya and Pollard, and saw the friendship blossom into a special bond. It rubbed off on the cricket too as the veteran coach still feels that the ""best coaching comes from your co-players"".""I think one of the things that stands out is that they were great mates. They seemed to get on really well. And obviously, playing together that relationship helped. The best coaching comes quite often from your co-players. From the mates in the team. You can be a coach, but the best coaching comes from your teammates. It's an old-fashioned way of learning. But it's probably the best and strongest.""For instance, when in the Indian team, Anil Kumble's influence on our spin bowlers was huge. Rahul Dravid, Sourav Ganguly, Sachin Tendulkar and VVS Laxman's influence on other batters was massive. I think as a coach, you need to create that environment so that the players are learning off each other. And I think that has happened with Polly. But I think they love each other's company. They're great mates. He learned an awful lot from Kieran Pollard,"" says Wright.In his numerous interactions, Pandya has always called Pollard as the brother from another mother. The bond between the two remains special, and Pandya maintains that his Caribbean outlook on life continually draws him to Pollard. When Hardik's brother Krunal entered the MI set-up, the trio instantly clicked and together became the franchise's heartbeat for many years - helping them win titles and dominate the IPL. In Pollard's words, they were the ""real engine room"" of the setup. Regarding the Caribbean outlook, Pollard doesn't restrict it to music and style.""We tend to associate that with Caribbean and West Indian music and style. But we also have that pride and that passion as well for performance. As soon as you don't perform, people look at what you're doing. That's exactly from a Hardik perspective. That's exactly what has happened to him. He dresses nicely, he's there, he likes himself, he likes to look nice. He has that flair. People tend to try to use that against him. Because they don't have that confidence. That's what happened. So that is certain things that can resonate with myself,"" says Pollard.Pollard and Pandya spent numerous late nights and early mornings in the hotel corridors, and it wasn't just fun and games. It was about life, cricket and everything that happens in between. During his active playing days, Pollard was always known to shut out the outside noise and speak his mind. It's an art that takes years to master but with Pollard's words of wisdom, Pandya had an early bootcamp that prepared him for the numerous battles life, and cricket, had in store for him.""I think it was just one of the conversations and one of understanding who can have an impact on you and who you allow to have an impact on you. If you know that you're doing everything that you need to perform on a cricket field, and it's not happening, it's ok because it's a game, it's a sport, you feel a lot, right?. But if you allow people who can't even pick up a bat or a ball or who only have an opinion because they're watching data to affect you, that's where the problem is.""My cricket will speak for me. And if my cricket doesn't speak for me today, it's over. I'll get it to speak for me tomorrow. And that is the mentality I've had and that is the mentality that we sort of drill the conversations. Because people tend to say things but we can control what we can control. We don't live it. But when you start to live it mentally, you get stronger,"" Pollard reveals the conversations he had with Pandya to mentally prepare him for the battles.Over the years, Pandya has been labelled as fragile and injury-prone, with very little appreciation for the relentless grind of a premier all-rounder. He isn't just a bits-and-pieces cricketer; he's a freak who can break into any XI purely on the basis of his batting or bowling. Career threatening injuries and surgeries later, Pandya continues to go strong and has already played 131 T20Is and 94 ODIs for the country. And he is not done yet!""He would have been told a lot of things. He wouldn't be able to bowl again. His body's not strong. Who are you to say something like that? If you're not the expert. So when you realise that those are just words and people are using words to maybe create an agenda. Just channel your energy to say, okay. If you tell me I can't, I will show you I can. That's exactly, you know, what he did over the years. As I said, it has not been easy for him. And a person like that. And living in India. The media is going to use that as a target.""So that's the consequence that comes with the overall of that lifestyle. But you have to be able to be strong enough to overcome it. I believe he has been strong enough to overcome it. Who says they're not going to have more? Because life is like, life is a life thing. But he has the, he has now the template to overcome it. That's it,"" says Pollard.Flashy wraps on the car, expensive watches and an envious lifestyle. While Pollard wouldn't buy most of the things - exhuberantely priced watches in particular - which Pandya does but he is an incredidbly proud ""brother from another mother"" to see the story unfold from close quarters. Pollard understands that feeling of winning a World Cup for the country, giving more than 100% in matches and during preparations but hopes Pandya is remembered for ""what he has done on the field""""I just hope and pray one day that we continue to remember Hardik Pandya for what he has actually done on the cricket field. Rather than the expensive watches and the cars and all that, because that tends to come first. As cricket tends to come second in the media world. For what he has done from a cricketing perspective and whiteball cricket, Doing what he did especially after where he came from, the support he had from family - we must not forget that. The journey has been phenomenal and long it may continue,"" says Pollard.Before disconnecting the call, Pollard remembered to laud his red-ball outings for India too. The current perception is that Pandya doesn't want to play Test cricket for India anymore but just like Atum, he is determined to rise from chaotic waters.",Pandya is the heartbeat of India's white-ball set-up and the crucial piece that has kept the scales in balance since 2016. John Wright was scouting local talent for the franchise and it was that first glance of Pandya that left a lasting impression on the New Zealander.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128370823,imgsize-25024,width-400,resizemode-4/hardik-pandya.jpg"

T20 World Cup: Suryakumar Yadav press conference ahead of India vs Pakistan

NEW DELHI: Indian captain Suryakumar Yadav recently copied Pakistan spinner Usman Tariq ’s unusual bowling style during practice ahead of the big India vs Pakistan match in the T20 World Cup 2026 on Sunday.A video of Suryakumar mimicking Tariq’s action, including his signature pause before releasing the ball, went viral on social media.Watch:On Friday, the practice session was partly affected by light rain, so the Indian team had to train indoors in Colombo.Tariq has become a big talking point because of his rare bowling style, which uses a sidearm action and a delayed release that makes it hard for batters to judge the ball.He has played only four T20 matches for Pakistan but has attracted attention since being selected for the World Cup.Although his action was reported twice in the past, the ICC later cleared him. Because of physical issues with his elbows, he cannot bowl with a fully straight arm like normal spinners.Speaking before the match, Suryakumar compared Tariq to a tricky exam question, saying, “See, sometimes there is a question in the exam as well which is out of syllabus. So, we can't leave that question.”He added that India won’t give up and will prepare their own way to handle him: “To tackle that, you have to adopt your own way. Yes, he is a different character when he comes to bowl. But at the same time, we can't just surrender. We practise with similar types of bowlers and similar actions. We will try to execute what we are practising in the net sessions.”",Suryakumar Yadav mimics Pakistan spinner Usman Tariq’s bowling action.

5) Shivam Dube vs Abrar Ahmed, Shadab Ahmed

In the T20 format, teams rely on data to plan match-ups, making individual contests a key part of preparation. For India head coach Gautam Gambhir and Pakistan coach Mike Hesson, identifying the right combinations will be important ahead of the India-Pakistan game. However, with limited recent meetings between the two sides, the available data set is not extensive.Here are five match-ups that could shape the contest, weather permitting.The last time they faced each other in a T20I, Sahibzada Farhan hit Jasprit Bumrah for two sixes in a single game, becoming one of the few international batters to do so. Farhan later featured in an advertorial documentary about those shots in Dubai.Against Namibia, Bumrah did not bowl in the Powerplay. It remains to be seen how India use him against Pakistan. In three matches, Farhan has faced 34 balls from Bumrah and scored 51 runs without being dismissed.Kuldeep Yadav has not bowled to Babar Azam in a T20I. In ODIs, however, Kuldeep has dismissed Babar twice in three games, with Babar scoring 28 runs from 52 balls in those matches.Kuldeep has also done well against Pakistan in Asia Cup T20 matches, taking eight wickets in three games, including four in the final, even though Babar did not play in those fixtures.For this contest to take place, India would need to include Kuldeep in the playing XI.Hardik Pandya could be a key batter against Usman Tariq. If Tariq bowls during the middle overs, from 7 to 16, this battle could unfold.Tariq’s pause at the crease can disrupt a batter’s timing. Pandya, however, relies on his back-lift and balance to generate bat speed, even if he picks up the ball late. He does not have a pronounced trigger movement and usually reacts after the ball is released.Ishan Kishan has been among the runs and could look to attack Shaheen Shah Afridi, especially if the left-arm pacer angles the ball away from the left-hander. It will be important to see whether Shaheen uses the short ball against Kishan and how the batter responds.Shivam Dube has strong numbers against spin, including wrist spin. In 2025 T20 matches, he has scored at a strike rate of over 193 against slow bowlers. Against right-arm leg-spinners, he has scored freely, including against Ish Sodhi in a recent T20I series.Pakistan’s wrist spinners Abrar Ahmed and Shadab Khan could therefore be tested if Dube settles in.Both India and Pakistan have won their first two matches of the tournament.","Sahibzada Farhan hit Jasprit Bumrah for two sixes in a single game.

Poll Do you think Abhishek Sharma will be fit to play against Pakistan? Yes, he will be fit No, he won't be ready

NEW DELHI: India’s preparations for the high-voltage T20 World Cup clash against Pakistan have been dominated by one burning question — will Abhishek Sharma be fit in time? Conflicting updates from teammates and captain have only added to the intrigue ahead of Sunday’s marquee encounter.Spinner Varun Chakravarthy struck an optimistic note after India’s win over Namibia, revealing that the explosive opener could be on track for a comeback. “As far as I have spoken to him he looks good, he did some practice today also. He told me he is on the way,” Varun said, hinting at a possible return.However, skipper Suryakumar Yadav painted a more cautious picture. Abhishek, who was hospitalised earlier this week with a stomach infection, is still regaining strength after being discharged. “Abhishek isn’t fine still, might take one or two games,” Surya admitted, suggesting the team would prioritise his full recovery.The attacking left-hander missed the Namibia clash, where Sanju Samson partnered Ishan Kishan at the top of the order. Even as the team trained at the Arun Jaitley Stadium, Abhishek did not join full sessions, with reports indicating weakness and slight weight loss following the illness.Team management is expected to make a final call after monitoring his workload during training in Colombo. Traditionally, Abhishek spends long hours batting in nets and that endurance test could determine whether he is ready for the pressure of an India-Pakistan showdown.For now, India appear caught between hope and caution: Varun’s upbeat “he is on the way” versus Suryakumar’s realistic “might take one or two games” assessment.",India face Pakistan in their opening T20 World Cup match on Sunday.

T20 World Cup | Sahibzada Farhan on India vs Pakistan matches: 'Not one-sided'

NEW DELHI: Former India captain Rohit Sharma has warned Team India not to take their high-profile T20 World Cup 2026 clash against Pakistan lightly, even though they are favourites on paper.India face Pakistan on February 15 at the R. Premadasa Stadium in Colombo, and Rohit believes past records or rankings won’t matter once the match starts.India have dominated Pakistan in T20 World Cups and recent T20Is, but Rohit stressed that cricket can be unpredictable and every team can win on its day.Speaking at an event in Dubai, he said, “Firstly I never believed in this word called favourites. It’s such a funny game, and we’ve seen it now there’s so much that has happened in this last 10 years of international cricket. All these teams have so much exposure now playing T20 cricket.""You can’t just go and think that it’s a two-point victory for us. You just have to play good cricket on that particular day to achieve those points otherwise you might end up going home without anything.”He added that current form, reputation or history won’t guarantee success.According to Rohit, the key is performing on the day of the match, because any team can beat another in T20 cricket.“So it’s not about what you’ve done in the past, what is your team like, players are in form or not form. You just have to play well on that particular day because every team is capable of beating any team on that particular day,” he said.India have lost only once to Pakistan in World Cups, in the 2021 T20 World Cup, and have beaten them in their last five T20I meetings.",Former India captain Rohit Sharma warns Team India not to take Pakistan lightly.

Poll How confident are you in India's ability to handle Usman Tariq's spin bowling? Very Confident Somewhat Confident Not Confident

NEW DELHI: India’s preparations for the high-voltage T20 World Cup clash against Pakistan have taken a clear tactical direction, with wicketkeeper-batter Ishan Kishan insisting that the team is already equipped to tackle the unique challenge posed by spinner Usman Tariq . Fresh off a commanding win over Namibia, Kishan revealed that facing Namibia skipper Gerhard Erasmus — who also bowls with a sidearm action — offered valuable rehearsal ahead of the much-anticipated showdown.Kishan’s explosive 24-ball 61 laid the foundation for India’s imposing 209/9, ensuring momentum even during a middle-overs slowdown. Speaking after the match, the left-hander emphasised that India’s batters have already completed their homework against Tariq’s unconventional action.“No, I think we have already done the preparation part, and now it is just time to watch the ball and play our natural game,” he said, underlining the team’s belief in sticking to basics despite the hype around the Pakistani spinner.According to Kishan, video analysis and on-field exposure to Erasmus’ bowling proved crucial. “At this level, we just watch a few videos, and we get an idea of what kind of bowling is going to happen. So we are just keeping it simple. Yeah, he [Erasmus] bowled pretty well today, and I think there was quite a bit of learning for us,” he added, suggesting that India’s approach will revolve around clarity rather than overthinking.Reflecting on the Namibia clash, Kishan explained that although the surface looked flat, the ball initially held up, forcing him and Sanju Samson to pick their moments carefully. The attacking opener’s knock, combined with Hardik Pandya ’s blazing fifty, powered India to a total that proved far beyond Namibia’s reach as spinners later dismantled the chase.Kishan also spoke candidly about his personal evolution after leading Jharkhand to a maiden Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy triumph. “I think I am a changed man now… earlier I used to joke around 24x7, but now it is just two-three hours. I am focusing more on batting and my wicket-keeping,” he admitted, highlighting a more disciplined mindset.Looking ahead to the Pakistan encounter, Kishan acknowledged the magnitude of the occasion but stressed that preparation remains process-driven. “Pakistan clash, obviously, it would be a special one for everyone… once we get there, we look at the wicket and just play accordingly,” he said.",Wicketkeeper-batter Ishan Kishan insists India are already equipped to tackle spinner Usman Tariq.

T20 World Cup | Jonathan Trott press conference after loss vs South Africa

Poll Do you think Afghanistan can learn from this Super Over defeat? Absolutely! Maybe, but it will take time No, it's too demoralizing Not sure

There are some defeats that can crush you. For Afghanistan, it was one such afternoon in Ahmedabad on Wednesday.The double Super Over loss to South Africa, that has all but ended the team’s T20 World Cup campaign, may seem the end of the world for now. But Afghanistan should take heart from the fact that it was their famed fighting spirit, so intrinsic to their cricket, that kept them in the game against all odds.It’s not that Afghanistan haven’t endured heartbreaking losses before. The 2023 ODI World Cup defeat to Australia following Glenn Maxwell’s superheroics at the Wankhede probably cost them a place in the semifinals. The 2024 T20 World Cup semifinal defeat to South Africa was more sobering, but in this defeat, there was hardly anything that the Afghans could have done differently. Maybe just one thing — their choice of bowler in at least one of the Super Overs. Rashid Khan, their talisman for years and still considered one of the best in T20 cricket, chose to intriguingly keep himself away from the action.Rashid is somebody who used to bowl in the Powerplay for fun. However, in both losses in this World Cup, the superstar didn’t bowl in the first six overs. His decision to avoid the pressure cooker of a Super Over was slightly baffling, more so since South Africa opted for Keshav Maharaj in the second Super Over.Rashid, who has presented Afghanistan with many memorable moments, wasn’t asked why he kept himself away. Nor was coach Jonathan Trott made to face the question, but it remains to be asked, is Rashid still the bowler he used to be?The question is pertinent because the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad is a ground that the bowler knows like the back of his palm. Rashid plays for Gujarat Titans in the IPL and has immense experience of Indian conditions. He took 2-28 during the South African chase and was Afghanistan’s most economical bowler during the 20 overs. And most importantly, no other bowler in his team generates the fear factor that he does.Yet Azmatullah Omarzai was asked to bowl the second Super Over and the 24 the medium-pacer conceded really made the task immensely difficult. But one player who still made a fight out of it was Rahmanullah Gurbaz.The three sixes that Gurbaz hit off Maharaj showed his strength of character as it followed his 42-ball 84 during Afghanistan’s chase.The 24-year-old has been the lynchpin of the Afghan batting lineup for a while now.Coach Trott felt that the kind of talent Gurbaz has, he should come up with more such performances.“It’s probably the best innings I’ve seen him play and it’s unfortunate he couldn’t get us over the line. With the amount of talent, physique, sporting ability and natural hand-eye coordination that he has, it’s about going forward for him now.“He wears his heart on his sleeve and over the years, I have just tried to get him to be a little more consistent in everything that he does,” Trott said.With time, it will be interesting to see if Gurbaz gets more responsibility, taking the baton from Rashid and turning Afghanistan into a team that deals with the crunch moments a little bit better.","Afghanistan lost to South Africa in the T20 World Cup quarter-final in Ahmedabad.

45/1 to 77/6 against the USA. 205/4 to 209/9 against Namibia.India won their first two T20 World Cup contests rather convincingly but two batting collapses, occurring at different junctures of the game, should serve as a wake-up call for the batters ahead of the game against Pakistan on February 15 in Colombo.In both matches, the word from the Indian camp remained constant. They expected the wicket to be flatter and behave a certain way but the sluggishness in Mumbai and the odd low bounce in Delhi caught them off guard. Colombo is expected to be no different and will require a lot of adaptation and unlearning for a destructive batting unit which has feasted on batting paradises in the bilateral fixtures which preceded the multi-nation tournament.The sample size isn't that big but both Shadley van Schalkwyk and Gerhard Erasmus have provided a blueprint to the remaining teams. If you must stop this marauding Indian unit, be tactically smart: mix up your approach and have different plans ready.This Indian XI boasts of as many as five, even six when Abhishek Sharma played the first game, left-handers in the top-eight but they are all different. What works for Ishan Kishan may not work for Abhishek and a similar plan will not get the job done for the likes of Tilak Varma, Shivam Dube, Rinku Singh and Axar Patel.From their approach to hitting arcs to technicalities, there is very little similarity, which makes it all the more important to have clear and precise plans for each one.Schalkwyk mixed up his bumpers based on advice from his USA teammates and Erasmus was very smart in using angles, different release points and the crease. The delivery which got Tilak Varma took forever to reach the India batter because the bowler released it from far behind the crease. Even the step-out didn't achieve the desired connection. Namibia coach Craig Williams praised his skipper, lauding his ability to deliver the toughest overs of an innings.""He trains incredibly hard at all these variations, and I think - he plays cricket around the world in some leagues and bowls all the difficult overs, he bowls some really tough overs. And, he's continuously working on his game and trying to see how he can be more effective against batters. And I think tonight, again, against a world-class cricket team, he showed the world again what he's got and his execution was just really good tonight.""I think his first three overs went for 16 or something and then to bowl that 19th over as all under pressure - first ball going for six and then pulling it back, I think it was just really fantastic so I'm really happy for him he trains hard and he works hard at these variations in his game,"" said Williams at the post-match press conference.Erasmus certainly came prepared. While the occasional sling in the action can disrupt a batter's concentration, Ishan felt it only takes a couple of balls to get used to it and clear it from one's mind. Does it affect the plans to go big? Not really!""It might play in your head for a couple of balls, but I think at this level you need to have trust on your own strength as well. Even if he is trying to do something, we can go for sixes or boundaries at the same time. So important thing is how we are thinking at that point of time when the bowler is trying to do something different. But if we are just looking for boundaries and sixes and we are believing in our own strength I think that helps the batters more so we are just doing trying to keep it simple yeah some batters might score on, some batters won't but it's part of game and you keep on learning game by game,"" said Kishan.India were set for another big total vs Namibia but ran out of steam in the last two overs, losing five wickets and added just four runs off the ten deliveries they faced. The set pair of Hardik Pandya and Shivam Dube departed off consecutive balls, Axar Patel didn't score, and the ending starkly contrasted the explosive start Ishan and Sanju Samson provided.Ishan echoed the team's sentiment on the pitch but felt the unit fared well with the bat and appreciated the opposition for executing their plans under pressure. The wicketkeeper-batter expects his side to take learnings from this fixture into the remaining games of the tournament.""I think they batted pretty well. In both the wickets, I feel it was a bit different from what we expected to happen. And today, looking at the death overs, when we were not able to regularly hit big sixes, I think we need to also give credit to Namibia bowlers because they were bang on with their yorkers, they were bang on with their slow ones.""So yeah it was a good learning maybe if some other team is doing the same thing maybe we can use the crease more or we can do something different which can irritate the bowler. So it was a good learning in this game and especially I think It was not about our batters not able to hit sixes, but it was more of them bowling very well in the death overs,"" explained Ishan.The USA had India on the mat, Namibia had their moments and an immediate course correction with the bat is needed to cover all bases against a spin-heavy Pakistan, who have already experienced the Colombo strip.The Suryakumar Yadav-led unit has bludgeoned attacks in the build-up to the World Cup but what worked yesterday may not work today and tomorrow is always a dive into the unknown. The muscle memory of tonking bowlers on flat pitches will need a quick unlearn as Colombo, and remainder of the tournament, may not follow the script everyone is so used to seeing played on loop.India's remaining opponents would surely have noted the cracks that both the USA and Namibia exposed.","India won their first two T20 World Cup contests rather convincingly.

T20 World Cup: Suryakumar Yadav press conference ahead of India vs Pakistan

Kalyani: The J&K team has created a stir this time by making their maiden Ranji Trophy semifinal, in which they will play Bengal at the Bengal Cricket Academy ground in Kalyani from Sunday.They have already established their credentials by defeating former champions Rajasthan, Delhi, Hyderabad in group stage and Madhya Pradesh in the quarters.Led by veteran Paras Dogra, J&K will look to lift their first domestic title while Bengal will be in hot pursuit of their third crown after ending up as runners-up twice in the last five seasons.Both the unbeaten sides look well balanced and in good rhythm. “There’s little difference between the sides which make this stage (semis),” Bengal coach Laxmi Ratan Shukla stated.On a lively Kalyani track, the teams are expected to bank on their speed guns. While Bengal possess arguably the country’s best pace attack in Mohammed Shami , Mukesh Kumar, Akash Deep and Suraj Sindhu Jaiswal, all eyes will be on J&K’s Auqib Nabi who played a leading role in dismantling MP with a match haul of 12 for 110.The in-form pacer from Baramulla, who has the ability to move the ball both ways, has already taken 46 wickets in this Ranji taking his tally to 97 first-class wickets since the start of the 2024-25 Ranji season. “I feel if there are good bowlers on either side, then it’s the team which bats better holds the edge,” Bengal skipper Abhimanyu Easwaran said.","J&K will play Bengal in their maiden Ranji Trophy semifinal.

Abhishek Sharma is back and India to unravel a mystery slinger

Kolkata: England navigated choppy waters to register a five-wicket win over Scotland. Barring an unlikely, heavy defeat to Italy on Monday, England now look set to secure a place in the Super 8s.While the result was no surprise, England lived through a few anxious moments along the way. Their bowlers did well to restrict Scotland to 152 in 19.4 overs but the early dismissals of Phil Salt and Jos Buttler caused brief concern in the English camp. Eventually, England chased down the target, with 155/5 in 18.2 overs.Chasing a modest target requiring just over seven-anda-half runs per over, Jacob Bethell and Tom Banton had the luxury of rebuilding the innings after England slipped to 13/1. A cautious Powerplay, which yielded 43 runs, posed little concern as long as the pair remained at the crease.After the Powerplay, both batters showed their ability to accelerate at will, shifting through the gears with ease before Bethell (32 off 28b) fell trying to clear the ropes once too often. That, however, is the nature of T20 cricket and with 82/3 on the board at the halfway mark, England were still in a strong position.Banton continued with calculated aggression, anchoring the chase with his fourth T20I half-century — 63* (41 balls; 4x4, 3x6).Earlier, England’s bowlers exploited helpful conditions to keep Scotland’s total within reach. Jofra Archer had figures of 2/24. His early blows rocked Scotland and forced them onto the back foot from the outset. A quickfire 49 (off 32b; 5x4, 2x6) from captain Richie Berrington and his 71run partnership with Tom Bruce lifted Scotland beyond 150.Brief scores: England 155/5 (Banton 63*, Bethell 32, Davidson 1-12) beat Scotland 152 (Berrington 49, Rashid 3-36, Archer 2-24) by 5 wickets.","England beat Scotland by five wickets in their T20 World Cup match.

T20 World Cup: Salman Ali Agha press conference ahead of India vs Pakistan

India skipper Suryakumar Yadav admitted that the team’s batting has looked a little shaky in the first two matches of the T20 World Cup but expressed confidence in handling Pakistan’s tricky spinner Usman Tariq , describing him as “an out of syllabus question” in an exam.“See, sometimes there is a question in the exam as well which is out of syllabus. So, we can't leave that question. To tackle that, you have to adopt your own way. Yes, he is a different character when he comes to bowl,"" Surya said at the pre-match press conference.He added, “But at the same time, we can't just surrender. We practise with similar types of bowlers and similar actions. We will try to execute what we are practising in the net sessions.” India’s earlier matches exposed some vulnerabilities, with the team reduced to 77 for six against the USA and then losing five wickets for just four runs in the death overs against Namibia.Looking ahead to Sunday’s clash on the slow Premadasa wicket, Surya acknowledged the challenge posed by Tariq’s unusual bowling action, which has sparked debates about legality. “We had a scratchy start. You can't run away from the fact that it was not a proper T20 wicket.But I said earlier too that you can't actually brush everything under the carpet. There is no excuse,” he said.He remained positive about the team’s recovery, noting, “But we came back strongly. So, that's the beauty of T20 cricket. One or two batters I think taking that responsibility makes us cross the line.”Surya also highlighted the mental challenge of facing Pakistan, saying the key is handling pressure and big moments. “Yes, there will be pressure. There will be nerves, butterflies in the stomach when we start the game tomorrow. But yeah, at the same time, if there's no pressure, no nerves, then there's no fun to play cricket. And yeah, it's a big occasion. But yeah, I mean, every time I say the same thing, at the end of the day, it's just another game. You have to pack your skills, play some good cricket, focus on what you want to do better, and we'll see what happens.”Despite Pakistan being in Sri Lanka for the past fortnight, Surya remained confident. “They might have some edge. But as I said, we have come here before, we have played in these conditions, we know how the pitch plays, similar conditions to India. It's like the same situation for both the teams. See, it's definitely challenging when you come to Sri Lanka. But then at the end of the day, you have to challenge yourself, somehow find a solution and come out good,” he said.",Suryakumar Yadav says Pakistan's Usman Tariq is 'out of syllabus question' in an exam.

T20 World Cup: Salman Ali Agha press conference ahead of India vs Pakistan

The Ranji Trophy semifinals this season carry a refreshing mix of pedigree and possibility. While Bengal take on Jammu & Kashmir in one clash, eight-time champions Karnataka will square off against semifinal debutants Uttarakhand at the Ekana Stadium from Sunday. It is a classic matchup — decorated, seasoned campaigners versus fearless newcomers.Among the four sides left standing, Karnataka boast the most formidable roster on paper. With five Test players in their ranks, including the experienced KL Rahul , they possess the experience and depth that traditionally define title contenders. Yet, the question lingers: can they convert their star aura into silverware?Karnataka’s campaign has been anything but smooth. A crushing home defeat to Madhya Pradesh had pushed them to the brink of elimination during the league stage. It took a captain’s knock from newly appointed skipper Devdutt Padikkal — an unbeaten 120 off just 85 balls in their last league fixture against Punjab — to revive their season and propel them into the knockouts.The quarterfinals further underlined their pedigree. Facing 42-time champions Mumbai in their own backyard, Karnataka pulled off a stunning 325-run chase, taming one of the most successful teams in domestic cricket history.However, Uttarakhand arrive with momentum and nothing to lose. Their maiden semifinal appearance has been built on consistency and collective effort rather than star power. They won four of their seven league matches and delivered a commanding innings-and-six-run victory over Jharkhand in the quarterfinals to script history. For them, every step forward is a milestone.Karnataka’s strength lies in their experienced batting core. Rahul and Karun Nair — architects of the 2014–15 title triumph — bring big-match temperament. Mayank Agarwal adds solidity at the top, while Padikkal’s current form makes him a key figure. Youngster R Smaran (688 runs) has also contributed meaningfully, ensuring depth in the lineup.The bowling unit, too, offers variety and balance. India pacer Prasidh Krishna spearheads the attack, supported by the reliable Vidhyadhar Patil, who has claimed 15 wickets in four matches while chipping in with valuable lower-order runs. Leg-spinner Shreyas Gopal has been outstanding, leading the side with 41 wickets and contributing 442 runs — often in pressure situations.Uttarakhand’s campaign has revolved around their spin strength. Captain Kunal Chandela has led from the front with 709 runs, while Bhupen Lalwani has provided solid backing. But it is left-arm spinner Mayank Mishra who has been their standout performer, claiming 52 wickets this season. J. Suchith, a former Karnataka player, has added another layer to their spin arsenal with 25 wickets and 414 runs, making him a vital all-round presence.History, however, looms over Karnataka. Since lifting the trophy 11 years ago, they have faltered in the semifinals on four occasions. Head coach Yere Goud dismissed any psychological burden, insisting the team is focused solely on execution.“Definitely not looking at that. If you start doing that, it tends to play on your mind. We are focusing on doing the good things that have taken us this far and want to continue,” he said.With experience clashing against ambition, the semifinal promises a battle of temperament and skill.","Eight-time champions Karnataka take on debutants Uttarakhand in semifinal.

KOLKATA: Defending champions Mohun Bagan Super Giant started Indian Super League 2025-26 with a comfortable 2-0 victory over Kerala Blasters FC in the season opener here at the Vivekananda Yuba Bharathi Krirangan (VYBK).A first-half strike from Jamie Maclaren (36') and a second-half injury-time goal from Tom Aldred (90+6') secured three points for the Mariners.Mohun Bagan SG head coach Sergio Lobera named a very strong lineup with all the familiar faces including Dimi Petratos, Jamie Maclaren and Alberto Rodriguez, taking the field for the Spaniard's first match in charge of the Mariners. New signings Mehtab Singh, Robson Da Silva, and Amey Ranawade were the fresh faces in the whole match day squad. On the other hand, David Catala named a young lineup in his first ISL match, with foreign signings Oumar Ba and Victor Bertomeu making their debuts alongside midfielders Y Ebindas and Rowllin Borges, as per an ISL press release.The defending champions had the better possession in the first half, with Anirudh Thapa and Lalengmawia Ralte (Apuia) controlling the midfield, allowing Robson and Liston Colaco to find space to attack through the wings.Dimi Petratos returned to his preferred No. 10 role behind Jamie Maclaren, and the Australian almost gave his side an early lead. Liston Colaco found Petratos inside the box, but the forward snatched his shot, which went wide of the goal.The Mariners were dominating possession, but were finding it difficult to break down the stubborn defence of Kerala Blasters. They did manage to take the lead after the water break through Jamie Maclaren. He was found inside the box by Petratos, and the Aussie striker turned Aiban Dohling and found the net through a composed left-footed finish for the first goal of the ISL season. Mohun Bagan ended the first half with the one goal lead registering ten shots on goal with six on target at the end of the half.Catala made two changes in the start of the second half, bringing in Naocha Singh and Marlon Trujillo while Subhasish Bose was replaced by Amey Ranawade for Mohun Bagan. The second half also saw the Mariners being comfortable with the ball, maintaining possession for long periods to force the Blasters to defend deep in their own half.Kerala Blasters became stronger in the final quarter of the game, especially with the introduction of Kevin Yoke, who showed his pace and dribbling abilities down the wings, but could not muster any clear-cut chances to trouble Vishal Kaith in goal. Mohun Bagan put the game beyond the reach of the opposition in injury-time of the second half with substitute Tom Aldred finding the goal with a powerful header past Sachin Suresh from the free-kick of Anirudh Thapa.Jamie Maclaren was named Player of the Match.",Defending champions Mohun Bagan Super Giant started Indian Super League 2025-26 with a comfortable 2-0 victory over Kerala Blasters FC.

Hours before the truncated Indian Super League (ISL) season gets underway on Saturday, it became official that FanCode had sub-licensed the linear TV rights to Sony Pictures Network India (SPNI). Under the agreement, as reported by TimesofIndia.com , Sony Sports Network will hold exclusive TV broadcast rights for India and non-exclusive rights for Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Maldives, Nepal, and Sri Lanka. The position on international broadcast, however, is still in the works.All 91-matches will be telecast on Sony Ten 2 and pushed to other channels too if there is a double header at the same time.This is not the first time Sony Sports Network and FanCode will work together. Both platforms carried tennis' French Open in 2025 with Sony retaining the primary broadcast and sub-licensing the streaming aspect of all courts to Dream Sports-owned FanCode.Last year, a similar ploy was employed between Sony Sports and JioHotstar for cricket's India tour of England. Under those terms, Sony kept the television broadcast rights while JioHotstar was responsible for the digital streaming.""The macro observation on this is (that) there's so much opportunity (in the sports industry). (It) is so large that honestly there's just so much to be done in the industry that collaboration is probably more apt at this moment than competition because there's so much opportunity,"" explained FanCode co-founder Yannick Colaco of the sub-licensing strategy""And the way we look at it is very clear. We are a digital-first platform. So the two things that are unique about Fancode is (that) we are digital first and we are sports only.""Our product, our approach has always been focused on technology, focused on experience, focused on how we are available across 11 operating systems, focused on innovation on the digital side. And we neither have, nor (a) desire, to have any focus on building a linear TV business.""So when you look at those two unique pieces, there is tremendous opportunity to collaborate with other large media companies, which have a much bigger mandate and ambit. Very politely, we are a much smaller player in this overall media landscape.""And I think that's the way we look at it in the sense that while younger audiences are all digital first, and even some of the older audiences are migrating to digital, there is still a large audience which consumes sports content on linear television.""So when we're working with partners like the AIFF (All India Football Federation) and the ISL, we're very conscious of the fact that to help the sport grow, help the event be successful, give it maximum amount of distribution, we need to be collaborating with partners who have the linear TV presence so that we are able to reach out and basically able to reach out to all sports fans and all ISL fans across the country,"" he continued.Less than two weeks ago, FanCode acquired the broadcast rights -- linear TV and digital -- for the ISL at Rs 8.62 crore. Even though the company has presence only in digital streaming space, it consciously bid for both aspects knowing there were few, if any, players interested in just the linear TV rights.During conversations between FanCode, AIFF and the ISL interim committee, the provider made it clear they wanted to help ensure the top-division football was showcased to as many viewers as possible.After officially bagging the rights, the company entered into conversations with multiple national providers and even some regional ones.""We immediately started speaking to a bunch of people about this, including regional broadcasters, and we took a bunch of proposals that we got, we put them all together. We shared them with the AIFF and the interim committee. We got on a call with them. I shared the pros and cons of each one with them. And on that basis, a decision was made to accept Sony's proposal,"" said Colaco.While that was happening, FanCode also spoke to ISL club representatives to understand their expectations on how to improve the product. It was at this stage that the concept of each club's 'superfan' recording visuals behind the scenes came into being.ISL will have commentary in English, Hindi, Malayalam, Bengali and Tamil (only for Chennaiyin matches).Doing all this, why give away market share to a competitor like Sony Sports?""I'm making it easier for people who prefer to watch the game on linear television to watch it. And yes, (if it comes) at the cost of us also, that's okay. I think it's important to think consumer first. So I believe that eventually our product is what will give users the choice and deliver a great experience. And if it's good enough, which I hope it is, and I believe it is, consumers will come,"" reasoned Colaco.""I don't think it should be forced and that's always what we (have) believed. And I also think that you know a partner like Sony will help in raising the promotion levels and contribute (to the) marketing. (As the saying goes) A rising tide lifts all boats,"" he added.On their part, Sony Sports Network, who had attended the pre-bid conference for the broadcast rights but chose not to make a final bid, sees this as an opportunity to add to their football portfolio which is largely led by European competitions.""While we were keen to add ISL to our sports portfolio, back then, we needed more time to evaluate the property before putting in our financial offer,"" said Rajesh Kaul, Chief Revenue Officer and Business Head - Sports and International, SPNI,Yet this won't be their first foray into Indian football having previously showcased the I-League and Durand Cup.""Our aim is to cater to football fans and expand the football ecosystem in India. Sony Pictures Networks India is the Home of Football in India and we have a diverse and expansive portfolio of both International and Indian football properties that includes UEFA EURO 2028, the UEFA Champions League, UEFA Europa League, UEFA Nations League, Bundesliga, FA Cup along with India’s very own legacy tournament Durand Cup. Last year, we were also the official broadcasters of I-League which is also homegrown football league,"" he stated.","FanCode sub-licensed the linear TV rights to Sony Pictures Network India. Sony Sports Network will hold exclusive TV broadcast rights for India and non- exclusive rights for Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Maldives, Nepal, and Sri Lanka. All 91-matches will be telecast on Sony Ten 2 and pushed to other channels too if there is a double header.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128338674,imgsize-56580,width-400,resizemode-4/fancode-sony.jpg"

Jay Shah’s 2036 Olympic blueprint for India: '8 Medals won’t cut it'

Kolkata: The wait is over. The Indian football season is finally here but not, perhaps, at a time ideal enough to fall head over heels with it, especially after the way the game has been left gasping in search of clarity, continuity and identity. As Mohun Bagan SG begin their title defence of an abridged version of the Indian Super League against Kerala Blasters here on Saturday, Indian football is facing a strange transition.True, every transition has its own turbulence, but this season seems to be more about unshackling a state of sterility than setting in motion a long haul.Change, though, remains the popular catchword — both as a contradictory and complementary force. For the first time since the league’s inception in 2014, it’s now in the hands of the national federation.But in this change of guard, issues remain and unintended consequences threaten to emerge with the end of the Master Rights Agreement between the AIFF and Reliance-owned Football Sports Development Limited.How the entire ISL ecosystem has bled in this period of uncertainty is there for everyone to see, and shudder.Holders Mohun Bagan are beginning a new life replacing last season’s ISL Shield and Cup-winning coach Jose Molina with another successful and veteran Spaniard Sergio Lobera.“Pressure? Yes, there’s pressure. I think if you don’t feel pressure, it means you don’t need to fight for big targets. I know I am in a winning team, in a champion’s team. I know what is my responsibility and I am very excited about this responsibility,” Lobera remarked during his match-eve media interaction on Friday.Lobera has reasons to be optimistic as the might of Mohun Bagan looks too formidable to be rooted out easily. Because even in this period of chaos and uncertainty, they have the luxury of assembling the players and training for the past couple of months.Kerala Blasters, on the other hand, represent everything about the detrimental effect of this confusing and trying time. They had to part company with their entire force of foreigners including the veterans like Noah Sadoui, Jesus Jimenez and Adrian Luna and new coach David Catala has a job on his hands with the arrival of a new quintet of overseas players with no experience of playing in Indian conditions.‘We have come here with just 14 days of preparation and it’s not enough,” Catala said.“We’re up against a team which has been training all this time when we didn’t know what would happen to us. It is true that we are going to be the underdog team, but in football anything can happen,” the Blasters coach added.Constrained by financial instability, the state of play has seen several clubs go the Blasters’ way, with FC Goa’s David Timor, Iker Guarrotxena and Borja Herrera, Mumbai City FC’s Tiri and Bengaluru FC’s Edgar Mendez being some familiar faces bidding forced goodbyes to Indian football while Durand Cup champions North-East United FC have loaned out Alaeddine Ajaraie — the best player of the ISL’s 2024-2025 season — to Persija Jakarta in the Indonesian league.","Mohun Bagan SG begin their title defence of an abridged version of the Indian Super League against Kerala Blasters here on Saturday.

“Why don’t you write something positive?” said an irate Indian football official to this reporter. It was the plea of a frustrated representative who had done plenty at the grassroots level but was trying to please multiple stakeholders in the administrative chaos that is Indian football.Picture this. Only two days before the Indian Super League , the country’s top football division, was set to get underway on February 14, members of the All India Football Federation (AIFF) Executive Committee were voting on whether to keep it a 14-team league or expand it to 15 by including Churchill Brothers.That plea from Churchill Brothers was unanimously rejected, keeping Inter Kashi in the top division after a legal quagmire that remains unresolved. The league will therefore remain a 14-team competition with a single round-robin format, featuring 91 matches across the 2025–26 season.Yes, the 2025–26 season is finally getting underway in February 2026, five months later than originally planned. The February 14 start date was reached only after the intervention of the Sports Ministry, which wanted the delay to not affect the country’s ambitious bid to host the 2036 Olympics.All this transpired because Football Sports Development Limited (FSDL), the Reliance-backed company that launched and ran the ISL since 2014, saw its Master Rights Agreement (MRA) with the AIFF end in December 2025.The AIFF, stalled by court visits and constitutional updates, neither contemplated its options leading up to this deadline nor moved to renew the association.In the interim, uncertainty prevailed over if, or when, the season would get underway. While administrators twiddled their thumbs, foreign players departed to keep their careers going. Clubs were forced to let them go to recover some costs and to respect the players’ wishes.When the season finally received a start date, organisers struggled to get stadiums in playable condition. Odisha FC will only begin training for the new season on February 17 and, with no home venue confirmed, their opening fixture against Punjab FC on February 16 has been postponed. Kerala Blasters, who at one point considered shutting shop, had no clarity on which city they could feasibly play in.After extensive back-and-forth, the AIFF readied an interim fixture list, which was officially announced just a week before the league’s start. With FanCode on board as the digital broadcaster, the linear television announcement with Sony Sports Network will only take place on the day the season begins.Now for the positives amid the gloom. All stakeholders, including clubs, players, fans, sponsors and even the AIFF, deserve credit for ensuring the season was not lost. They showed maturity for the greater good.Most players have agreed to take pay cuts to keep the ball rolling, quite literally. The same applies to club owners and CEOs who have agreed to invest in a truncated season, aware that revenues will not match previous years, but have returned for the greater good.Even the AIFF, which has faced heavy criticism and could serve as a case study in administrative mismanagement, can argue that its hands were tied by legal disputes and warring factions. The fact that it eventually managed, through multiple mediators, to get everyone moving in the same direction is commendable.Unsurprisingly, the drama and court visits may not be over. As the AIFF circulated the League Rules on the eve of the season’s start, it made clear that relegation will be implemented as per the latest Constitution.This comes barely two weeks after clubs wrote to the Sports Ministry seeking Force Majeure for the season, effectively requesting a pause on relegation.Subsequently, the club that goes down could take the legal route later if the issue is not addressed for now.FC Goa, Mohun Bagan Super Giant, Odisha FC, East Bengal, Jamshedpur FC, SC Delhi, Punjab FC, Mumbai City FC, Bengaluru FC, Kerala Blasters, Inter Kashi, Mohammedan SC, NorthEast United, Chennaiyin FCMohun Bagan Super Giant vs Kerala Blasters on February 14 at 5 pmFC Goa vs Inter Kashi on February 14 at 7:30 pmRs 1.25 croreRs 75 lakhRs 2 croreFanCodeSony Sports Network","The ISL 2025-26 season will start on Saturday.

Chelsea F.C. progressed to the fifth round of the FA Cup after a 4-0 victory over Hull City A.F.C. at the MKM Stadium. Pedro Neto scored three goals, while Estevao Willian scored one.This was a return to Hull for Chelsea manager Liam Rosenior, who has played for and managed the club before.

He made seven changes to the team for this match. Cole Palmer, Enzo Fernandez and Joao Pedro were not included.""Pedro Neto has been outstanding, he works so hard and has so much quality. I'm delighted to see him get the goals,"" Rosenior said.""The most pleasing aspect was the mentality. It was a really strong performance in terms of the mental application you need to be successful. Everyone worked really hard for each other.""Chelsea dominated possession in the first half and scored in the 40th minute. Liam Delap assisted Neto, who scored from outside the box.Andrey Santos had a header saved by Dillon Phillips in the early minutes of the second half. From the resulting corner, Neto’s cross was scored at the near post to make it 2-0 in the 51st minute.Chelsea had tied 2-2 with Leeds in their earlier match in the week when they were leading by two goals, but this time they maintained dominance. Estevao scored in the 59th minute from close range.Neto finished his hat-trick in the 71st minute after being assisted by Delap.In the other fourth-round match, Wrexham A.F.C. won 1-0 against Ipswich Town F.C.

FC Goa vs Inter Kashi

The long wait is finally over. After months of uncertainty, administrative reshuffle and endless speculation, the Indian Super League is back in a leaner, shorter format and with everything to play for from day one.The new edition, delayed by nearly four months, will be held in a truncated format featuring 14 teams.With limited time remaining in the football calendar, the All India Football Federation has opted for a single round-robin format, scrapping the second leg and the traditional playoff stage.Each team will play 13 matches across a three-month league, and the side finishing on top of the table will be crowned champion.Defending champions and Kolkata giants Mohun Bagan Super Giant will kick off the season at home, hosting Kerala Blasters FC in the opening clash at 5pm at the Salt Lake Stadium on Saturday.The fixture pits two of the largest fan bases in Indian football against each other and promises a high-voltage start to a season unlike any other.In the evening, newly-promoted Inter Kashi will be tested when they face Super Cup champions FC Goa in an away clash beginning 7.30pm.There will be no second chances, no knockouts but just 91 high-stakes matches where consistency alone will decide the champion.The season's launch comes as a major relief for participating clubs after months of uncertainty.The League itself had been hanging in the balance over the past few months after Football Sports Development Limited -- the Reliance-backed company that launched and ran the ISL since 2014 -- exited after its Master Rights Agreement with the AIFF ended.There was no immediate clarity on who would take charge, raising serious doubts about whether the season would even take place.Months of uncertainty finally eased only after the Union Sports Ministry intervened, helping the AIFF put a new arrangement in place and ensuring that the country's top-tier football competition could go ahead.However everything is not fully settled and there are several unanswered questions as several teams are still finalising their squads, and a few are expected to begin the season without foreign players.There has already been disruption before kickoff --the February 16 fixture between Odisha FC and Punjab FC has been put on hold as Odisha are yet to confirm their home venue.There was also confusion around the broadcast plans until late in the build-up.It has now been confirmed that all matches will be streamed on FanCode and telecast on Sony Sports Ten 2, according to an AIFF release.On the field, Mohun Bagan enter as favourites.The core of last season’s title-winning squad remains intact, and playing in front of their passionate supporters gives them an early edge.Head coach Sergio Lobera made it clear that excuses will not be entertained.""It will be a difficult season for everyone, but finally, this is the moment to try and find solutions and not find excuses,” he said.Forward Dimi Petratos struck a confident note: “We have the best squad in the country and we have trained well and we have come here to win.”The Blasters, however, have strengthened key areas with new foreign signings and believe they can spoil the party. Head coach David Català acknowledged the challenge but remained optimistic.“They are defending champions and best team in the country but in football everything is possible and one never knows what's going to happen. We are focused on tomorrow's game and we will try to get all three points,” he said.Goa, who have had competitive exposure this season, will look to use that rhythm to their advantage.Head coach Manolo Márquez expects a tight contest against the debutants.“My expectations are that it will be a difficult and a very equal game for both the teams,” he said.Inter Kashi, promoted after winning the I-League, arrive with ambition and belief.Head coach Antonio Habas emphasised the importance of making a strong first impression in their maiden ISL campaign.“It’s very important to create your first impression. We have to do really good in our first ISL season,” he said.",Mohun Bagan host Kerala Blasters in the opening match of the new Indian Super League season.

New Rubi Rose photos with Rashee Rice trigger intense debate over timing and public perception



Rashee Rice With Rubi Rose (Instagram/rubirose)

Rashee Rice did not need to say a word. One Valentine’s Day post was enough to set the internet racing. The Kansas City Chiefs wide receiver appeared alongside rapper and model Rubi Rose in photos shared to his Instagram story, and within minutes, fans began drawing their own conclusions. The images showed the two stepping out together, relaxed and close, the kind of moment that rarely stays private when both names carry weight.Neither Rice nor Rose offered captions to explain the moment. They did not confirm anything. They did not deny it either. That silence only added fuel. For many watching, the public appearance felt intentional, or at least meaningful. It came weeks after the pair were first spotted at the same gym in January, a coincidence that did not feel like one to those paying attention.The timing matters. Rice, 25, has spent the past year balancing football and fallout. His legal situation remains part of his public identity after he pleaded guilty to felony charges tied to a 2024 multi vehicle crash in Dallas. The result included probation, a short jail sentence arrangement, and a six game suspension under the NFL personal conduct policy. He returned to the field, but attention never fully left him.Off the field, another layer of controversy surfaced in January. Dacoda Nichole Jones, the mother of his two children, posted photos showing bruises and injuries while alleging years of abuse. She did not name Rice directly, but described the accused as her children’s father. The post was later deleted. No police report followed, and both the Chiefs and the NFL acknowledged awareness without further comment.Against that backdrop, the Valentine’s Day photos carried extra weight. Fair or not, public perception rarely separates personal life from past headlines. Every appearance becomes part of a larger story.Rose understands that reality well. Her personal life has drawn attention before, including a widely discussed link to comedian Druski. She later addressed the speculation herself, a reminder that online narratives often move faster than truth.For now, what exists between Rice and Rose lives in that uncertain space between private and public. A photo can suggest something. It can hint. But it cannot explain everything.","The Kansas City Chiefs wide receiver appeared alongside rapper and model Rubi Rose in photos shared to his Instagram story.

Jaguars’ shocking Travis Hunter usage twist sparks massive questions about his two-way future and franchise vision,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/jaguars-shocking-travis-hunter-usage-twist-sparks-massive-questions-about-his-two-way-future-and-franchise-vision/articleshow/128367492.cms,"Travis Hunter (Getty Images)

Jaguars plan Travis Hunter’s return with stronger focus at cornerback



Travis Hunter’s return cannot come soon enough for a Jacksonville Jaguars team that saw both his promise and his absence in the same breath. The prized rookie, taken second overall after a costly draft trade, brought rare versatility from college to the NFL. For seven games, he lived up to that billing, lining up wherever Jacksonville needed him. Then, a torn LCL in his right knee abruptly cut short a season that was only beginning to show its shape.His recovery is progressing well, and the Jaguars are already looking ahead with clarity. This time, the plan is not just about getting him back on the field. It is about redefining where he fits best. After experimenting with him on both sides of the ball, Jacksonville appears ready to lean into a role that reflects both roster reality and Hunter’s natural defensive instincts.The shift in Travis Hunter’s role is rooted in both timing and necessity. As he works toward a full return, expected in time for offseason practices in May, the Jaguars are preparing to use him primarily at cornerback while still giving him select snaps at receiver. It is a notable adjustment for a player drafted with the vision of becoming a full time two way presence.That vision has not disappeared entirely. Head coach Liam Coen made that clear when discussing Hunter’s rare stamina.“I think he’s absolutely going to be able to [play both ways]. I do. ... He has the craziest conditioning of any athlete I’ve ever been around. He doesn’t get tired, he doesn’t sweat. It’s kind of crazy.”Still, Jacksonville’s roster has evolved. The offense found its rhythm late in the season, helped by the arrival and extension of Jakobi Meyers and the emergence of Parker Washington. With Brian Thomas Jr. already established, the receiving group suddenly looks crowded.The secondary, on the other hand, faces uncertainty. Greg Newsome and Montaric Brown are headed toward free agency, leaving potential gaps. General manager James Gladstone acknowledged that reality. “Obviously you can take a peak at expiring contracts on our roster and see which side of the ball has more,” Gladstone said. “At this point walking into the offseason, corner is a position that we have a few guys who are on expiring contracts. By default, you can expect there to be a higher emphasis on his placement [at corner].”Hunter’s rookie numbers reflect how much he was needed everywhere. He logged 324 snaps at receiver and 162 at cornerback. That balance is expected to flip when he returns.Jacksonville still thrived despite losing him, finishing 13 and 4 and claiming the AFC South before a playoff loss to Buffalo. Yet his absence was felt. His return now carries a different meaning. Not just as a playmaker, but as a solution to a defense preparing for change.There is patience in how the Jaguars are approaching this. They invested heavily in Hunter because he offers options. Now, they are choosing the one they believe helps them most.","Jaguars plan Travis Hunter’s return with stronger focus at cornerback.

Chloe Kim sends flirty Valentine’s Day jab at Myles Garrett (Getty Images and Instagram)

Chloe Kim and Myles Garrett did not need gold to make headlines in Italy. Their quiet moments, shared smiles, and one playful post said enough. Kim arrived at the Milano Cortina 2026 Winter Olympics chasing history. She left with silver, pride, and her boyfriend close by. In a week filled with pressure, she found balance in competition and companionship.Kim’s pursuit of a third straight Olympic halfpipe title fell just short. Seventeen year old Choi Ga-on delivered a stunning 90.25 to claim gold. Kim, gracious as ever, embraced the moment. Silver still placed her in rare company as the first American woman snowboarder to medal in three straight Olympic halfpipe events. And through it all, Garrett watched from the stands, living every run with her.Chloe Kim Myles Garrett became one of the quieter but warmer stories of these Games because of when and how Garrett showed up. Fresh off his honors with the NFL Honors and a dominant season with the Cleveland Browns, he flew across the world. He later admitted watching her compete was “exciting but terrifying,” a line that captured the emotional stake he had in her performance.Kim returned that affection in her own voice. On Valentine’s Day, she shared a photo of Garrett smiling at her inside a Lamborghini and wrote, ""update: still havent been asked but I think we r each others Valentines maybe"". It was teasing, casual, and deeply personal. Their bond, still new to the public since appearing together at the Crunchyroll Anime Awards in May 2025, has grown in plain sight.Later, Kim offered a more heartfelt glimpse during an interview with Access Hollywood. “He’s my best friend, truly,” Kim said. “He’s the best. I’m just so grateful for him for so many reasons. Despite his busy life, he always shows up for me, and I try to do the same for him. It’s funny when you find someone you have so much in common with — especially when I didn’t think we would. We spend our downtime the same way. We love just chilling, watching anime, playing the same games, eating the same foods. It’s such a funny thing, and I’m so grateful and fortunate to have met him.”Those words carried the same honesty she showed on the podium. Gold was the goal. Silver became the reality. But the week offered something else. Support, perspective, and proof that even at the height of Olympic pressure, joy can still find its way in.","Chloe Kim and Myles Garrett have been together since May 2025.

While some fans praised the move, others argued the ring Travis Kelce gave Swift should have remained one of a kind. Critics accused the designer of profiting, sparking debate over exclusivity and fandom loyalty.

Swifties spark online firestorm over Taylor Swift’s engagement ring resale decision

When Taylor Swift announced her engagement to Travis Kelce , fans erupted with joy and scrutiny in equal measure. Within hours, attention shifted from wedding predictions to the striking engagement ring sparkling on her hand. Designed by 30-year-old jeweler Kindred Lubeck of Artifex Fine Jewelry, the piece reportedly carries a value that could reach $5 million. For many, it symbolized not just romance but a fairytale moment years in the making.Then came the twist. Lubeck revealed in an Instagram reel that “the ring that captured 170,000 hearts is available now” through Sotheby’s. What seemed like a natural expansion of her signature design quickly stirred backlash online. A portion of Swift’s fanbase felt the ring should remain sacred, reserved for the singer alone.The comments section filled fast. “I wish you weren’t doing this. TS deserves to have the only one,” one fan wrote bluntly. Another echoed the sentiment, saying, “That should have stayed a one of a kind ring.” A third critic accused Lubeck of “getting that bag,” implying she was cashing in on Swift’s global spotlight.Yet support poured in as well. “Love seeing you shine!! We are enchanted to meet you as well!!” one follower commented, referencing Swift’s lyrics.Another added, “That was the best Swiftie welcome I’ve ever received,” praising Lubeck’s earlier nod to the song “Enchanted” when she thanked fans and said, “And to those of you who are new, I’m enchanted to meet you.”The divide reveals a curious contradiction. When replicas surfaced on resale platforms, many fans rushed to buy lookalikes. Few raised concerns about exclusivity then. The frustration intensified only when the original designer offered her own version for sale.Experts often point to parasocial relationships to explain such reactions. The term, first introduced by psychologists Donald Horton and R. Richard Wohl in 1956, describes one sided emotional bonds with public figures. Fans can feel protective, even possessive, over milestones in a celebrity’s life.Still, a ring design entering the market does not diminish the original’s meaning. Swift’s engagement ring will always be hers. Lubeck, meanwhile, is doing what successful designers do. She is building a brand, one sparkling moment at a time.","Swifties are divided after the jeweler behind Taylor Swift's engagement ring revealed that the design is now available for purchase through Sotheby's.

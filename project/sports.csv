After 10-year wait, India skipper's first Ranji outing lasts a mere 19 balls

MUMBAI: Things seem to be going from bad to worse for Rohit Sharma , whose poor form must be of serious concern to the Ajit-Agarkar-headed national selection committee, which has named him India's captain for the home ODI series against England and the Champions Trophy next month.Rohit's return to the Ranji Trophy after nearly a decade lasted barely for half an hour as he was dismissed after mistiming a pull off Jammu & Kashmir pacer Umar Nazir at the Mumbai Cricket Association 's Sharad Pawar Academy in BKC, after managing to score only three runs off 19 balls on the morning of Day One.It was another poor outing for the out-of-form 37-year-old whose desperate search to rediscover his form must now await the second innings.After scratching around, during which the impressive Nazir repeatedly beat him and even struck him on the glove once on a pitch where the ball was moving around, India's ODI & Test captain perished to a horrible shot in the sixth over.Attempting a pull off a harmless, slightly short ball pitched outside the off-stump, he only managed a leading edge that J&K captain Paras Dogra easily caught at mid-off.This is third time this season that Rohit has been dismissed in this fashion. New Zealand fast bowler Matt Henry (at the Wankhede in Mumbai) and Pat Cummins (at the MCG in Melbourne) have dismissed the ageing star in a similar fashion.To accommodate Rohit and the other India stars for this match, Mumbai had to drop their season's success story, opener Ayush Mhatre (408 runs in 5 matches, with two centuries in his debut Ranji season).Rohit has been in the midst of a horror run with the bat, spread across the home Test series against New Zealand, and the Border-Gavaskar Trophy in Australia.","After 10-year wait, India skipper's first Ranji outing lasts a mere 19 balls.

Not very long ago, mystery spinner felt he may not be able to play for India again

IND vs ENG: Coach and captain gave complete freedom, says Abhishek Sharma

CHENNAI: Ravichandran Ashwin said a few days ago on his YouTube channel that the ongoing T20I series would be a ""crucial battle between England and Varun Chakravarthy "".""The result will be based on how England tackle Varun. If they struggle while facing Varun and Ravi Bishnoi, the game is done. If they encounter Varun well, the series will be tight,"" Ashwin opined. The veteran spinner's assessment, spot on for the time being considering the way the first fixture in Kolkata panned out, reflects how Varun's T20 stocks have risen.After a superb series in South Africa, Varun once again was in the thick of things, with a match-winning 3-23 at Eden Gardens. As the England batters failed to pick him time and time again, the conversation started whether India had missed a trick by not including him in the Champions Trophy squad. Many felt that he could have come in place of one of the three finger-spinners in the 15. With his wicket-taking ability, Varun, in tandem with Kuldeep Yadav, would be an asset in Dubai.Former national selector Devang Gandhi, though, feels that Varun still has some way to go before he finds a place in the Indian ODI set-up. ""Varun has to keep working hard if he aspires to play 50-over cricket. I am sure that he has the quality to get there, but having said that, the selectors have picked the best possible 15. In the long run, if he keeps doing well, he can be an asset for the team,"" Gandhi told TOI. While there is no questioning his talent with the ball, fielding could be an area of concern for Varun and in 50-over cricket, it can become a factor on bigger grounds.But the story is different in T20 cricket. For someone who returned to the India T20I fold only three months ago - after a near three-year absence - the 33-year-old has quickly turned himself into a nailed-on starter and made people take notice despite being surrounded by multiple game-changers. The journey to become the enviable spin force he is today began a few years ago, when Varun asked his personal coach AC Prathiban : ""Do you think that I can play for India again?""""After the 2021 T20 WC, I analysed my bowling. What I found was that I was bowling more side-spin. I was not able to beat the batters through side-spin. I worked out that I have to beat the batters only through bounce, so I worked on my over-spin. That has been working till now,"" Varun said in Kolkata on Wednesday.While the slow bowler has made key technical adjustments before coming back as 'Varun 2.0', he has also been consciously working on tactics and the mental side of things with Prathiban.""The rise of Varun has happened because of his calmness. Earlier, he used to think a lot on what had to be done. He had a lot on his mind. I tried to calm him down, he can be calmer when he is at the top of his run-up. He has many variations which he can bowl really well. So during a process, we minimised the types of balls he bowls. That has given him a lot of clarity and confidence,"" Prathiban, a former Tamil Nadu off-spinner, told TOI.""Before series or tournaments, we look at different batters and work out how Varun should bowl against them… what lengths he should bowl against each one of them and what is the sequence of balls. We try to eliminate extra pressure as we do not know what the batters are going to do. We just work on the controllables,"" added Prathiban.Varun's accuracy, consistency and wicket-taking ability are seen as his biggest strengths. ""He is pretty accurate with his lines, so different modes of dismissal come into the equation. When he is attacking the stumps, a batter can be bowled, stumped or dismissed LBW,"" said TN bowling coach Guru Kedarnath recently.""When you can bowl both off-spin and leg-spin, you need to have good control. Varun has it. Besides that, he has the knack of picking up wickets. He is a genuine wicket-taker and can win games outright for his team,"" said Prathiban.Up next is a 'home game' for Varun at the MA Chidambaram Stadium on Saturday and the fans would love another match-winning performance from the Chennai man, on a pitch which should assist him.","Varun Chakravarthy returned to the India T20I fold only three months ago.

If Lance Klusener 's side wins every game with a bonus point, they may now achieve a maximum of 23 points.With 20 points already, the Royals are very close to being the first team to earn a spot in the Season 3 playoffs.Mujeeb-ur-Rahman of the Royals and Noor Ahmad of the Super Giants faced off in a battle of the Afghanistan mystery spinners.Mujeeb produced another masterpiece of 2/23 to restrict the Super Giants to 142/7.Given that DSG dominated right out of the gate thanks to a 62-run opening partnership between Matthew Breetzke (25) and Quinton de Kock (43), it was an incredible effort.De Kock's move to the top of the order undoubtedly paid off, but he lost to Mujeeb in deep long-off just when it appeared that he was getting into his rhythm.As the Royals strengthened their grip in the middle overs, Mujeeb also dismissed Heinrich Klaasen for two.All-rounders Jon-Jon Smuts (32) and Wiaan Mulder (24) tried to turn things around, but the Royals now had the upper hand.With another quick 25 off 13 balls (4x4) from Lhuan-dre Pretorius, they were even able to overcome Joe Root's early loss.The Super Giants looked on Noor Ahmad to carry on the valiant actions of his countryman Mujeeb.With a brilliant 44 off just 22 balls (4x4, 3x6) to lead the run chase, Rubin Hermann was once again proving to be the Royals' gem of the match.To clean bowl the well-set Hermann, however, Noor produced what may have been the ball of the match.Ahmad only had one success that evening, which was unfortunate for the Super Giants.The Royals came very close to winning when Mitchell van Buuren put down the anchor with a composed 44.The Super Giants will need to get back together fast before they travel to Newlands to play MI Cape Town , while the Royals can now confidently look forward to their matchup against the Pretoria Capitals on Saturday.","Paarl Royals beat Durban Super Giants by five wickets at Kingsmead.

Adjustment pangs

Conditions enable hosts to push for outright wins

'Neutral' curators under scanner

NEW DELHI: The red ball continues to haunt India's top Test players. Following a torrid Test season, Rohit Sharma Shubman Gill and Rishabh Pant managed to score a combined 12 runs and lasted a total of just 45 balls for their respective state teams on the first day of the Ranji Trophy 's second leg on Thursday. Ravindra Jadeja was the only one who had a good day, taking 5/66 and scoring a quickfire 38 off 36 balls for Saurashtra against Delhi in Rajkot.Concerns about batting form were flagged after India lost the Sydney Test in the first week of the year, prompting these international stars to take the field in domestic cricket inside three weeks after a hectic 10-Test season. While Yashashvi Jaiswal and Rishabh Pant scored four and one for Mumbai and Delhi respectively, the national selectors will be particularly worried about Rohit and Gill's ordeals against the new ball.Rohit could manage just three off 19 balls before he fell tamely to J&K's Umar Nazir in Mumbai. Gill scored four while opening for Punjab against Karnataka in Bengaluru.The Indian cricket board (BCCI) has identified international cricketers' reluctance to play domestic cricket as one of the factors behind the Test team's decline over the last four months. Captain Rohit's place in the team has come under the scanner and so has Gill's ability to tackle top-quality Test bowling.More than Jaiswal and Pant - who have been India's leading scorers in the season - alarm bells will be ringing for Rohit and Gill.How the selectors perceive the performances will be interesting. Way back in 2015, India's current head coach Gautam Gambhir had told TOI about the difficulties of playing at the domestic level after having played international cricket for a long time.""It is difficult in certain ways. You face medium pacers for so much of the time after facing bowlers hurling at 140 kmph in IPL or international level. It is down to mental strength,"" Gambhir had said.Former India selector Devang Gandhi reckons the selectors will be more focused on how Rohit and Gill fare. ""International players usually play domestic cricket to find their touch or stay in form. The way Rohit got out playing a half-hearted shot could be a bit worrying. Even Gill needs runs to get his confidence back. I wouldn't worry much about Jaiswal and Pant because they have scored most runs for India of late,"" Gandhi told TOI.""Before pouncing on these players, one must also remember they are coming off an extensive Test season. It takes a lot out of you both physically and mentally. More than this Ranji match, the Duleep Trophy was an ideal preparation at the start of the season,"" Gandhi added.If one browses through the scoresheets of the Ranji matches in this round, most of the venues witnessed collapses and teams were bowled out two-thirds through the day's play. Multiple matches have seen 14 or more wickets falling on the day. This is the penultimate league round of the Ranji Trophy and history suggests home associations opt for bowler-friendly pitches to enforce outright results in order to push for a quarterfinal berth.""It has been a tradition in Ranji cricket at this point of the competition. Host associations either prepare heavily seamer-friendly pitches or rank turners. Jadeja had a good day because he was bowling on a raging turner. Even Cheteshwar Pujara got out to part-time offie Ayush Badoni. Other centres too have overtly helped either seamers or spinners. It doesn't help Indian cricket anyway,"" Gandhi said.BCCI appoints neutral curators to counter such situations. However, the move has not yet yielded results. Host associations don't face any serious sanctions while the neutral curator is hauled up in case the pitch is of poor quality.""It's tough to stick to your guns at the state associations with influential administrators. The pressure is unreal on neutral curators, who may be at the venue for a week. If the pitch is reported as poor, the curator will be answerable. BCCI has to start docking points too,"" a BCCI official said.","Rohit Sharma, Shubman Gill and Rishabh Pant score a combined 12 runs.

James Vince , the captain of the Gulf Giants, was asked to bat first and immediately tried to attack. Obed McCoy, however, handed the Dubai Capitals their first wicket at the opposite end when he hit Ibrahim Zadran for three. Jordan Cox joined Vince, who hit four boundaries in his twenty-four, and kept the Gulf Giants' scoreboard going.Vince was removed just before the powerplay ended, and Zahir Khan removed Tom Alsop for two early in the seventh over. With Gerhard Erasmus's strong backing, Cox assumed leadership from that point on.Cox and Erasmus recovered and put on a 69-run partnership to give the Giants some momentum in the last part of the innings, despite the Dubai Capitals keeping things close. However, Erasmus left for 29, and soon after, Cox reached his half-century, with Shimron Hetmyer joining him.The Dubai Capitals' bowling held Hetmyer and Cox solidly in check as they attempted to score immediately. The Gulf Giants scored a respectable 153/5 in 20 overs after Cox was run out for a solid 70 in the last over of the innings. On 17, Hetmyer was still undefeated.Ben Dunk and Shai Hope responded by getting out to a steady start and trying to lay the groundwork for the Dubai Capitals' pursuit. However, Dunk was unable to bat for very long and fell for ten, and Khalid Shah contributed ten more. Both players fell as they attempted to go long, giving the Gulf Giants a brief advantage.Following that, Gulbadin Naib joined Hope, and the two of them filled in the holes effectively, gaining a number of significant boundaries when the Dubai Capitals retaliated. Aayan Khan took his second wicket, but Gulbadin was the next to leave for 17. Captain Sikandar Raza and Hope were taken to the middle when Najibullah Zadran was unable to stay for too long and returned to the hut for seven.Together, Raza and Hope scored 33 runs, which helped to steady the ship. Together with Raza, Hope was able to lay the groundwork for the massive launch in the last overs, which was just what the Dubai Capitals needed. Dasun Shanaka began in fifth gear, and Blessing Muzarabani took Hope out for 47 before giving up 18 runs in the over.Shanaka finished the match with two sixes, a boundary, and a single in the 19th over, continuing his assault on the Gulf Giants bowling all the way through.

Poll What Do You Think is Affecting Virat Kohli's Performance the Most? BCCI's New Family Guidelines Off-Field Issues

Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel.

Former Australian bowler Brad Hogg suggested that Virat Kohli 's recent decline in performance might be attributed to off-field issues rather than on-field matters, adding that BCCI 's revised guidelines regarding family accompanying players during international tours could potentially add more pressure.During the recently-concluded Border Gavaskar Trophy, Virat's performance was subpar, managing only 190 runs across 10 innings. His underwhelming display contributed to the scrutiny he faced following India's 1-3 series defeat against Australia.""He (Kohli) has got a family now. He has other commitments off the field that he did not have when he was really dominating all three formats around the globe. So it is not just about the cricket , it is what's happening off the field as well,"" said Hogg on his YouTube channel.""I think it is more the drama off-field than on-field for Virat. I just think he has just got too much on his plate that has probably caused him to not perform as well at this moment.""The year 2024 proved challenging for Virat, who accumulated just 655 runs in international cricket from 23 matches and 32 innings. His batting average stood at 21.83, with one century and two half-centuries, his highest score being 100 not out.In response to the team's overall disappointing performance in Australia, BCCI implemented new regulations covering various aspects including baggage allowance, family travelling with players during tours and participation in domestic cricket.Commenting on that, Hogg said, ""With the new rules that the BCCI has brought in, in regards to families, that's gonna put even more stress on Virat...because you gotta have that balance. I think players should be able to have their families on tour as much as possible, especially with the amount of cricket and the amount of travel that India has at the present moment.""Since early 2020, Kohli's performance in Tests has shown a significant downturn. In 39 Test matches from 2020 onwards, he has score 2,028 runs at an average of 30.72, including three centuries and nine fifties, with his highest score being 186.",Former Australian bowler Brad Hogg suggests that Virat Kohli's recent decline in performance might be attributed to off-field issues rather than on-field matters.

NEW DELHI: India spinner Varun Chakravarthy was still eager to get better even after he played a game-winning effort against England in the first Twenty20 International.After being left out of India's Champions Trophy squad, Chakravarthy, the local hero of Kolkata, came back to Eden Gardens to reveal his enigmatic variants against England.By cheaply dismissing the opening combination of Ben Duckett and Phil Salt in the first innings, Arshdeep Singh created the ideal environment for Chakravarthy to express himself.He had plenty of time to con the hard-hitting English middle-order by using techniques from his mystery box. Chakravarthy quickly realized that bounce, not turn, was the key to success on a surface where he has bowled numerous times.""I am used to seeing such pitches in the IPL. I know that it is for the seamers, but I know there are certain lengths which are helpful for me. What I realised was I can't beat batsmen with a side-spin. The only way I can beat the batsmen is through bounce,"" Chakravarthy said after winning the Player of the Match award.His effectiveness was also attributed to keeping the ball away from the hitting arc in addition to removing bounce from the surface. Along with Harry Brook and Liam Livingstone, Chakravarthy caught the big fish during his successful outing: England captain Jos Buttler Chakravarthy performed a counterpunch flawlessly when England threatened with a partnership between Buttler and Brook that looked promising.Livingstone followed young sensation Brook in the dressing room with a two-ball duck in the same over after Brook was initially dismissed for 17.Also See: ICC Champions Trophy Dates 2025 Only how long Buttler could stay on the crease would determine England's chances of reaching the 150-run milestone.

Following the captain's dismissal, India easily overtook England, who had crawled up to 132.Chakravarthy returned with astounding figures of 3/23 from his four-over performance, with Buttler's wicket being his last wicket of the game. Despite his game-changing performance that helped India win by seven wickets, he believes more work needs to be done.""I am trying to keep it away from their arc, it was holding a bit. Every over, bowling in Eden is challenging. To bowl to batsmen like Jos and other guys is definitely challenging. The last over was very tricky and challenging, but by God's grace, I was successful.

The veteran batsman said that every player goes through ups and downs, and revealed that Rohit had a few good sessions in the Mumbai nets in the build-up to the match.""As a player, every player goes through that phase (and) that is part and parcel of any sportsman's career. What is important is (that) he is hungry, he is determined to do well. I am sure, once he gets in, he will get a big one. A player has to be confident and I feel Rohit is really confident.

""We're delighted to have Yashasvi back as well. He's been performing exceptionally well at the international level.

This season has been challenging. After five league games, we shifted to white-ball formats for the Syed Mushtaq Ali and Vijay Hazare Trophies. Now we're returning to red-ball cricket, so adapting quickly as a team is crucial,"" Rahane concluded.","India's Test and ODI captain Rohit Sharma is set to turn out in his first Ranji Trophy match in almost a decade.

Why Mohammed Shami didn't play in 1st T20I against England,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/england-tour-of-india-2025/why-mohammed-shami-didnt-play-in-1st-t20i-against-england/articleshow/117471580.cms,"Poll Should Mohammed Shami Have Played in the 1st T20I Against England? No, The Team Management Made the Right Decision Yes, He Should Have Been Included

NEW DELHI: Mohammed Shami 's eagerly awaited return was further postponed as the Indian bowler was left out of India's starting eleven for the opening Twenty20 International match against England because the team management didn't think he would fit in with the lineup given the Eden Gardens track's characteristics.After 14 months, everyone was expecting Shami to return to the national team, but when captain Suryakumar Yadav revealed at the toss that he would not be playing, it stoked rumors that the national selectors were not confident in his fitness. Abhishek Sharma explained after the game that the veteran bowler was benched due to the circumstances and the combinations that the team management deemed suitable.""I feel it's the decision of the team management and they thought it's a better option keeping in mind of these conditions,"" Abhishek said at the post-match press conference in Kolkata.Also See: ICC Champions Trophy 2025 The fresh look of India The T20 team is entirely Gautam Gambhir 's creation, and it has performed remarkably up to this point by concentrating on role-specific conditions rather than celebrity culture conformity.'GamBall' against 'Bazball' was the result of not choosing a bowler of Shami 's caliber, assessing the track, and selecting three specialized spinners and one frontline pacer. It's safe to assume which philosophy won.T20Is haven't been his finest suit, as evidenced by his 11-year international career, in which he played 23 of them with 24 wickets and an economy rate of almost nine runs per over.Gambhir didn't want to put a veteran who had just returned from a 14-month forced international break in a situation where Jos Buttler and company could have considered his length to be cannon fodder.Ironically, the 34-year-old pacer, who appeared to be fully recovered, bowled for about 30 minutes at the side nets, aiming for stumps, while Indian captain Suryakumar Yadav chose to bowl at the toss and declared the playing XI without him.Also See: Champions Trophy 2025 Full Schedule Shami had bowled full throttle at the India nets in every session, despite having a hefty strapping on his left knee.Although Abhishek, one of the younger players in the national team, discussed combination, it is still unclear if the senior pacer is still having issues with a swollen left knee following each demanding practice.Given that captain Suryakumar had voiced confidence in Shami's inclusion during the pre-match media conference, there didn't appear to be any serious concerns regarding his fitness.""It's always good to have an experienced bowler in your side, and he is making a comeback after over a year. I am really excited to see him. I have witnessed his journey-what he did at the NCA, how he focused on his bowling and recovery. It's great to see him fit and back in the side,"" Suryakumar said on Tuesday.Shami himself expressed his desire to make a comeback, highlighting the effort he made to demonstrate his fitness by representing Bengal in all three domestic formats, first with the Ranji Trophy , then the Syed Mushtaq Ali T20s, and ending with the Vijay Hazare Trophy.""The hunger to play for the country should never end. If you love it, you will always fight back, no matter how many injuries you face,"" Shami said at a Cricket Association of Bengal event.""No matter how many matches I play, it always feels like less. Once I leave cricket, I may never get this chance again,"" he added during CAB's felicitation ceremony for the victorious Under-15 women's cricketers at Eden Gardens on Monday.Since Sunday, when the camp started, Shami has also been bowling at full throttle after a demanding three-phase exercise that lasted more than an hour.He returned to bowling full force on the eve of the game on Tuesday without experiencing any discernible discomfort.Even though his left knee was always strapped, neither the strength and conditioning coach nor the physiotherapist needed to attend to him.There was only a faint trace of discomfort as he made his way back to the dressing room, taking slow, deliberate movements and appearing to be aware of his left leg.With star pacer Jasprit Bumrah facing a fitness cloud after suffering a back niggle during the fifth Test in Sydney, Shami's return has garnered a lot of attention in the run-up to the Champions Trophy. Ajit Agarkar , the chairman of selectors, also emphasized Shami's importance during last week's Champions Trophy selection announcement in Mumbai.""I don't think his fitness issues were related to white-ball cricket. We were trying to get him to Australia. Unfortunately, his knee didn't allow him to play four-day or five-day cricket.""With white-ball cricket, he has played most of the Syed Mushtaq Ali games and some of the Vijay Hazare games. With uncertainty around Jassi (Bumrah), if Shami is fit and playing regularly, his quality and experience are invaluable,"" Agarkar said.As India look to strike the correct balance before the Champions Trophy, Shami's next chance to demonstrate his preparedness is probably going to come later in the series.","Mohammed Shami was left out of India's starting eleven for the opening Twenty20 International match against England. The team management didn't think he would fit in with the lineup given the Eden Gardens track's characteristics.

RAJKOT: The presence of Rishabh Pant in Delhi's Ranji Trophy side will garner all the attention as the Ayush Badoni-led side takes on two-time winners Saurashtra in a must-win Group D game here from Thursday onwards.Saurashtra too boast some star power of their own in Pant's India teammate Ravindra Jadeja , and the discarded India No. 3 batter Cheteshwar Pujara Delhi and Saurashtra are placed fourth and fifth respectively and have a lot of ground to cover. Only the top two teams from each of the four groups will advance to the quarterfinals.There has been increased scrutiny of India's poor batting performance in Australia recently. With head coach Gautam Gambhir expressing a desire to see India players appear in the Ranji Trophy, Pant and Ravindra Jadeja are among a host of stars - including India's Test and ODI captain Rohit Sharma and Yashasvi Jaiswal - who will again experience the grind of multi-day cricket.Also See: 2025 Champions Trophy The clash between Delhi and Saurashtra at the Niranjan Shah Stadium Ground C will also see former India pacers Jaidev Unadkat and Navdeep Saini.

The bowling duties will be shouldered by Unadkat, Hiten Kanbi, Jadeja and Dharmendrasinh Jadeja. Saurashtra will be eager for a performance similar to on e they produced against Chandigarh in the clash before the break.Delhi's batting will revolve around the hard-hitting Pant, captain Ayush Badoni, Yash Dhull and opener Anuj Rawat.

NEW DELHI: In a gruelling 72-move battle, the longest game of Round 5 in the Masters section , D Gukesh had the last laugh as he got back to winning ways in the Tata Steel Chess Tournament 2025 in Wijk aan Zee on Wednesday.Playing against Vincent Keymer, a member of the team he assembled during his preparation for the World Chess Championship , Gukesh, donning the familiar grey hoddie, reflected glitter of a true world champion on Dutch soil.Playing with white pieces, the Chennai-born grandmaster made a couple of errors here and there, giving the German GM a chance to make a comeback. However, Keymer's persistence eventually gave way under Gukesh's superior game-reading skills.Under time pressure, Keymer finally resigned, giving Gukesh his second win of the tournament and his first after three consecutive draws. With this win, the 18-year-old also became the new India no. 1 in the live ratings.Rameshbabu Praggnanandhaa continued his solid run, securing a draw against Max Warmerdam. Their encounter began with the French Defence, with both players castling early on the 7th move. The game seemed evenly balanced from the start.Praggnanandhaa, wielding the black pieces, pressed aggressively, testing Warmerdam’s defensive skills.Despite the pressure, the Dutch GM held firm, and the game ended in a draw after 39 moves when neither side could find a breakthrough.For Praggnanandhaa, it was his second draw of the tournamentALSO READ: India to host FIDE Chess World Cup 2025; Arjuna Awardee 'surprised' at the move A stalemate also marked the faceoff between Arjun Erigaisi and Leon Luke Mendonca — two players struggling to find their best form in the tournament.Last year’s Challengers winner, Mendonca gained an early edge in the Blumenfeld Countergambit with the Spielmann Variation, but a critical misstep on the 18th move cost him a chance to press for a win.His best chance, Nxd4, which captured Arjun's black knight for his white knight, was a pivotal moment in the match. But Arjun navigated the situation cleverly to force a threefold repetition, ending the match within 30 moves. Both players were left ruing missed opportunities but added half a point to their tally.Pentala Harikrishna and Wei Yi also shared points in a brief encounter. Playing a French Defence (Steinitz Variation), the defending Masters champion Wei tried to gain an early edge but couldn’t break through Harikrishna’s solid play. But the game concluded in a draw after just 22 moves.Vladimir Fedoseev secured a dominant win over Fabiano Caruana , who has been dropped to third place in the live world ratings.

MUMBAI: Jammu & Kashmir's (J&K) spirited team is in a mood to reopen the wounds of 42-time Ranji Trophy champions Mumbai. The Northern side had shocked the domestic giants by four wickets at the Wankhede Stadium in the 2014-15 season.On an eventful day when their India stars failed to deliver on their return to the Ranji Trophy and 17 wickets fell, Mumbai, who desperately need to win this match to stay in hunt for a berth in the Ranji knockouts were hanging in the game purely due to their bowlers' fightback.Fired by their tall, well-built pacers Umar Nazir (4-41 in 11 overs) and Yudhvir Singh (4-31 in 8.2 overs) in conditions where the ball was moving around and aiding good bounce, J&K shot out a star-studded, but woeful Mumbai for just 120 in 33.2 overs just after lunch on Day One of their key Group A clash at the MCA's Sharad Pawar Academy in BKC.Making a bold move to bat first and playing as many as three spinners on a pitch where seamers profited, Mumbai endured a horrible morning, as, breathing fire, Nazir ran through the defending champions' top-order, accounting for India's Test & ODI captain Rohit Sharma (3), Hardik Tamore (7), Mumbai skipper Ajinkya Rahane (12) and Shivam Dube (0).It was Auqib Nabi who drew first blood in the third over when he trapped Yashasvi Jaiswal (4) lbw with a ball that came in sharply. Rohit mistimed a pull off Nazir, while Rahane, after stroking a couple of delightful fours, was bowled through the gate by a ball that swung in. Tamore perished while trying to play across, while Dube fell caught behind.In a mood to take the attack back to the opposition, Shreyas Iyer smashed the first ball that he faced down the ground for a huge six, and then hit a four, but soon paid for his risky approach as he was dismissed for just 11, caught by Nazir off Yudhvir at mid-on after playing a poor shot.Left tottering at that point at 47-7, Mumbai's plight would've been worse but for a brilliant counterattacking 63-run partnership for the eighth wicket off just 66 balls between their allrounders Shardul Thakur (51, 57b, 5x4, 2x6) and Tanush Kotian (26, 36b, 5x4).By the close, J&K managed to eke out a 54-run lead, finishing at 174 for seven, with experienced opener Shubham Khajuria (51, 75b, 4x4, 3x6) providing solidity and Abid Mushtaq (44, 37b, 6x4, 2x6) the impetus to the innings.Coming back from an injury which forced him to miss quite a bit of the season Mohit Avasthi took 3-34, while left-arm spinner Shams Mulani, who was dropped from Mumbai's white ball teams, took 2-61 in 10 overs, even as he came in for some stick.","Hosts bundled out for 120, trail by 54 runs on Day One of Group A clash.

Spinner Siddharth Desai recorded a historic feat on Thursday during the first innings of Gujarat's Ranji Trophy match against Uttarakhand, following his spell of 9/36. The match, being played at Ahmedabad's Gujarat College Ground, witnessed Siddharth register the best bowling figures in an innings by a Gujarat cricketer in first-class cricket. However, Siddharth, as well as his teammates, were eager to record a 10th wicket in the spell, which eventually didn't transpire.""10 wickets in an innings is a really big feat. After I picked my ninth wicket, the bowler at the other end tried his level best to ensure that I had the best chance possible by constantly bowling outside off-stump. Unfortunately, the last batter made a mistake. Everyone was left a little shocked as they wanted me to pick the 10th wicket. However, they later came and congratulated me,"" said Siddharth in an exclusive interaction.""Every member of the team kept pushing me to pick as many wickets as possible during the spell. They didn't let me relax at any point. Our team's captain Chintan Gaja kept saying, 'It's not over', in an attempt to motivate me,"" he added.Siddharth maintained focus on ensuring calmness under pressure just like Ravichandran Ashwin and Axar Patel who he idolises.""I wanted to bowl stump-to-stump and ensure patience. The objective was to ensure I didn't get carried away after three wickets. I started feeling that ten wickets could very well be up for grabs following my seventh wicket. However, picking nine wickets is also a great feeling and just like a dream. It's a big moment for me and my family. I just want to do everything possible to represent India in Tests which is my late father's dream,"" he stated.Siddharth didn't pick a wicket in the opening two overs of his spell, but enjoyed immense success in the fifth over of the Uttarakhand innings, which marked the third over of his spell. The spinner picked three wickets in four balls, handing Gujarat the momentum. Uttarakhand were eventually bowled out for 111 in 30 overs.""Siddharth hadn't recorded a five-wicket haul for a long time before this innings. So, my message to him was to simply follow the process rather than getting enamoured by the moment following his third wicket,"" shared Gaja.""His first dismissal made me feel like there could be something special in store for us as there was a sharp turn. It was a classic left-arm spinner's dismissal. The speed at which Siddharth bowls makes it difficult for batters to face him.

All-rounder Shardul Thakur came up with another resilient performance that helped Mumbai put up a fight on day one of their Ranji Trophy match against Jammu and Kashmir on Wednesday and expressed a hint of disappointment at being overlooked for the Indian team lately.Coming to the crease with Mumbai reeling at 47 for 7, the 33-year-old displayed his batting skills with a quickfire 51, featuring five boundaries and two sixes, from 57 deliveries. It helped Mumbai reach 120.Talking to reporters after the day's play, Thakur said that selection should be based on ""quality"".""What can I talk about my quality? Others should talk about it. They should see that if someone has quality, he should be given more chances,"" Thakur said, without taking any names.Thakur's batting show on Thursday echoed his remarkable maiden first-class century from the previous season's Ranji Trophy semi-final when, batting at number 9, he revived his side with a knock of 109 off 105 balls, including 13 fours and 4 sixes.""I like batting in difficult situations. In easy situations, everyone does well, but how you put up the show in adverse situations matters. I see tough situations as a challenge and always think about how to overcome that challenge,"" he said.He also remained unsold in the IPL auction last November, as none of the 10 franchise owners showed interest in his all-round skills.Thakur said it's important to move on from setbacks.""You have to forget whatever has happened in the past; it is not going to change.

PACE PUNCH

BENGALURU: A nicely watered wicket, cold air, disciplined bowling and callous shot selection collided to ensure Punjab crashed to a lowly 55 at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium here on Thursday. Their opposition Karnataka, on the brink of an early exit, had more than one positive on the first day of their Ranji Trophy fixture here.R Smaran, then stood tall, figuratively and literally, to drive home the advantage as Karnataka reached 199/4 in the 50 overs they faced at stumps, a healthy 144-run lead. The cornerstone of that innings was Smaran’s unbeaten 100-ball 83 (12x4; 1x6).The 21-year-old, who had an underwhelming start to his Ranji Trophy career, found his bearings during the recent Vijay Hazare Trophy triumph. Fresh from the century in the final of the white-ball competition, the southpaw was a picture of intent, elegance and assured footwork.A lot has been spoken about the former state U-23 captain being an India prospect. While he has miles to go, he appears well on his way. A confident youngster, whose stroke-making finesse is complemented by his flair for the big hits, Smaran didn’t take long to settle. His first boundary was off the sixth delivery he faced.He was initially cautious but once he got his eye in, he switched gears like a well-greased machine. That he was in his element was apparent when, in the 30th over, when he went after Gurnoor Brar, entertaining the few watchers with cover drives. He smacked three boundaries in four deliveries.That approach was bound to give the opposition opportunities, but the close calls were few and far between and he continued in the same vein largely untroubled. It was a courageous innings since Karnataka had wobbled slightly after a good start from openers KV Aneesh (33) and Mayank Agarwal (20). The two fell in quick succession and another wicket at that point could have reduced the good work from the bowlers to nought.Aneesh gifted his wicket to Aradhya Shukla with a mistimed pull, while Agarwal failed to negotiate a Sanvir Singh delivery which kept low and was rapped right in front on the pads. Devdutt Padikkal (27) and KL Shrijith (26) too squandered promising starts.Agarwal had called right at the toss. Shubman Gill , who led Punjab, has plenty at stake after a low-key tour of Australia. Abhilash Shetty (3/19), making his second Ranji Trophy appearance for Karnataka, struggled at first and Gill struck him for a boundary to get off the mark.But Shetty quickly figured out Gill’s love for the drive and soon had the Punjab skipper picking the wrong line. The inside-edge flew straight to wicketkeeper Shrijith. The 28-year-old Shrijith had a busy day with the big gloves as he collected six catches.Karnataka’s pace attack, led by the ever-dependable V Koushik (4/16), rarely strayed as they made the most of the conducive morning conditions. Along with Prasidh Krishna (2/11) they tied down Punjab’s batting line-up. After Shetty removed the openers, Koushik laid bare Punjab’s middle-order, removing Pukhraj Mann (1) and Anmolpreet Singh (0) off consecutive deliveries. Prabhsimran Singh too left early, leaving Punjab staring down the barrel at 14/4. They never recovered.At one point, it appeared they would be bowled out for the lowest-ever Ranji Trophy score at this venue – 44 by Mumbai in 2015 — but were saved by the 11 extras which the hosts conceded.","Karnataka reach 199/4 in the 50 overs they faced at stumps, a healthy 144-run lead.

MUMBAI: Umar Nazir, the six-feet-four-inches tall Jammu & Kashmir fast bowler, whose deadly haul of 4 for 41, along with Yudhvir Singh's 4 for 31, helped his team skittle out Mumbai for just 120 in 33.2 overs in their Ranji Trophy match at the MCA ground in BKC, revealed after the first day's play why he didn’t even celebrate with his teammates after dismissing India captain Rohit Sharma for just three in the morning.The man, like many, is a big fan of the ‘Hitman.’“The first thought in my mind was…I am a big fan of Rohit and that is why I didn’t celebrate after taking his wicket today.

NEW DELHI: Rishi Kapoor , the first Delhi footballer to win a national football league title, passed away in a city hospital on Monday. He was 49 and had reportedly been suffering from liver-related issues.Primarily a left-footed midfielder with fine passing ability and a thunderous shot, Kapoor spearheaded Hindustan FC ’s rise in Delhi’s football of the late 1990s and early 2000s, his ability and time on the ball was good enough to catch the attention of the big clubs in the then National Football League and later, the I-League .At a time when the Capital’s footballers were mostly semi-professional and rare on the national clubs’ scene, Rishi left to join ITI in Bangalore in 2000 with ambitions to play in the NFL. Already employed with Delhi Audit , and with ITI. He was one of the first players to be signed on contract by the Bangalore outfit as it rejigged its rules to allow for two outstation players, or ‘guest players’ as they were officially labelled.It was here that a tweak was made to his positional nature that would immediately further his prospects as a footballer. Partly due to a crowded midfield at ITI, and largely due to his left-footed passing and fondness for playing from the deep, Rishi was converted into a defender at left-back. It may have stifled a bit of his creativity, but his game-reading lent solidity to the defence. His performances at ITI led to Mohun Bagan taking notice.“We’ve lost a very good player today. This is no time to go,” Debjit Ghosh, teammate when Bagan won the title in 2002, told TOI from Kolkata. “When we first saw him at ITI, he was playing as left-back and he really impressed our coach, Subrata Bhattacharya. Much later after we signed him, we realized that he was a natural playmaker, but we needed him in defence. He and I struck up a very fine understanding on the field,” said the ex-India player.Former India international Renedy Singh too recalled their days together at Bagan. “Back then, it was normal that the clubs would never pay us on time. We would seldom have money, but we loved the local kebabs. I remember Rishi, Lolendra (Singh) and me literally scrounging money from here and there just to go Eliot Road and have kebabs,” said Renedy, “He was a very forthright person, probably that may have rubbed some people the wrong way but I remember him very, very fondly.”Despite a national title and the promise of further professional exposure, Rishi left Bagan to return to Delhi’s Hindustan. “He stayed just a few seasons with us. He wanted to return to keep his job,” remembered Ghosh. It was perhaps this mindset – of saving the job -- that probably cost the Delhi footballer an India call-up. Stephen Constantine, the then India coach, was impressed by Kapoor’s versatility on the left channel, but chose to ignore him because he rightly felt that Delhi’s football didn’t offer a high level of intensity and competitiveness.With his job safe, Kapoor enjoyed brief stints with Salgaocar and Sesa in Goa but always returned to establish himself as an Ambedkar Stadium fixture. A decade later, after his first move, as Delhi football would change character, moving away from the Walled City into the suburbs, Rishi Kapoor would be the symbol of change. Playing for newly-formed Delhi United, he would toy with much-younger footballers, effortlessly doing it even at 35.","Rishi Kapoor, the first Delhi footballer to win a national football league title, passed away in a city hospital on Monday.

Griezmann blows penalty

Barcelona were held to a 1-1 draw by Getafe in La Liga on Saturday, failing to make up ground on the top two teams in the Spanish title race.Jules Kounde gave Barcelona an early lead, but Mauro Arambarri equalised for Getafe in the first half, and the Catalans were unable to break down Jose Bordalas' well-organised team.The draw leaves Barcelona in third place, five points behind league leaders Atletico Madrid, who suffered a 1-0 defeat at Leganes earlier in the day.Despite winning the Spanish Super Cup last week and thrashing Real Betis in the Copa del Rey, suggesting a return to form after a slump in late 2024, Barcelona dropped two points on the road in their first league match of 2025 against 16th-placed Getafe.""It's not done yet, we still have some matches to play and as I said before, we will fight until the end,"" Flick told reporters.""Today it's one point more, not two points less. We missed (out on) two points, but we have to look forwards and make it better next time.""Flick fielded his strongest side in recent weeks, hoping to secure a result at Getafe, where Barcelona had failed to score in their previous four away visits.The Blaugrana ended that streak in the ninth minute when Kounde, who also scored in the midweek Copa del Rey win against Real Betis, was cleverly set up by Pedri and scored on the rebound after David Soria saved his initial effort.However, Barcelona faced the same difficulties they have often encountered at the Coliseum, with Getafe digging in and denying top scorer Robert Lewandowski any space.Getafe equalized in the 34th minute when Coba's shot was parried by Barcelona goalkeeper Inaki Pena, and Arambarri pounced to score.The hosts maintained their tight defensive setup in the second half, making life difficult for Barcelona.Raphinha missed a golden opportunity to win the game for Barca in the closing minutes, hitting the side netting from close range after being found by Lamine Yamal's cross.""It was a shame, the match, we had control of the game and with one chance they scored one goal against us, it's a shame,"" Kounde told Movistar.After the match, Barcelona defender Alejandro Balde reported being subjected to racist abuse from some home supporters during the first half.On Sunday, Spanish and European champions Real Madrid, currently second in La Liga, host Las Palmas with the aim of moving to the top of the table.In another surprise result, league leaders Atletico Madrid suffered a shock defeat at Leganes, ending their club record run of 15 consecutive victories.Matija Nastasic headed Leganes in front early in the second half, and Antoine Griezmann missed a late penalty, dragging his effort wide, as Atletico fell to their second league defeat of the season.""I thought we were low on energy, it wasn't enough from us,"" Atletico goalkeeper Jan Oblak told DAZN.""We'll keep our head up after (winning) 15 games, we lost this one and we have to keep going forwards... unfortunately the streak is over.""Leganes, 15th in the table, defended well to keep Atletico at bay in the first half, with Julian Alvarez and Griezmann hitting the woodwork.Nastasic's header from a corner put Leganes ahead early in the second half, and they protected their lead without much trouble until controversially conceding a penalty for a debatable handball by Sergio Gonzalez.Griezmann took responsibility from the spot but rolled his 90th-minute effort wide of the goal.Atletico must now regroup in the Champions League, where they aim to reach the knockout rounds, as they face Bayer Leverkusen on Tuesday.""They were 15 extraordinary games, I feel enormously proud at having set the (consecutive) winning record in Atletico's history,"" Atletico coach Diego Simeone told DAZN.""We have to accept that defeat is part of the game and prepare ourselves for Tuesday.""","Barcelona held to a 1-1 draw by Getafe in La Liga on Saturday. Jules Kounde gave Barcelona an early lead, but Mauro Arambarri equalised. Barcelona in third place, five points behind league leaders Atletico Madrid. Atletico lost 1-0 at Leganes, ending their club record run of 15 consecutive victories.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117365968,imgsize-154732,width-400,resizemode-4/117365968.jpg"

The Times of India in Melbourne:

Keys unlocks Swiatek

There was a moment early in the second set of the Australian Open semi-finals when Paula Badosa appeared to roll over her right leg, going down in a heap on the court. World No.1 Aryna Sabalenka , who was on a run, stopped and looked across the net before advancing in that direction. An uncomfortable hush descended on Rod Laver Arena .Badosa's injury timeline is well documented, her determined fight and gutsy comeback is a part of tennis folklore. But just when it looked like trouble, Badosa signalled to her friend with a thumbs up. Sabalenka couldn't help the smile, it spelt relief and affection.That was the first and only time in the match that the duo, who call themselves 'soulmates', shared shades of their friendship on the court.After Badosa got back on her feet, it was business as usual. Some 25-minutes later the 26-year-old Belarusian closed out a 6-4, 6-2 win which put the two-time defending champion at Melbourne Park within one match of completing a rare three-peat here.On Saturday, Sabalenka bidding to become the first woman to win three Australian Open titles in a row since Martina Hingis (1997 to 1999) will play another heavy striker of the ball Madison Keys , who is back in a major final nearly eight years after making her first final at her home Slam in new York.When the two players entered the mighty Arena for the first of the women's semi-finals on a cold, windy evening, the roof half-closed, there was barely any eye-contact between. The Spaniard was engaged in shadow drills, the Belarusian jumped lightly, shifting from side-to-side before the coin toss and when they posed for the customary pre-match photo, there wasn't even a hint of recognition.They might shop together, go out together and make dance reels together, but they also compete as hard as ever, standing across the net.It was the Spaniard who shot ahead quickly -- 2-0, 40-0, but the World No.1 whose grunt is loud, and follows the trajectory of the ball, turned it around, winning six of the next eight games to power ahead.Sabalenka, who by her own admission, 'played an incredible match', clocked 32 winners.""She wants it badly, we both want it badly. It's our dream, but here we are opponents,"" Sabalenka said. ""No matter what happens on the court, we'll be friends after our matches. It's tough to do, but we agreed on that.""After the two players left Rod Laver Arena, Sabalenka found Badosa seated on the floor in the player area and she crouched down beside her.The 27-year-old Spaniard said: ""She told me she played three semi-finals before she won a title. She was very proud of my improvement, especially with all I've been through. Look, if I have to lose against somebody, of course I want to lose against the World No. 1, against Aryna.""The 29-year-old Keys took the cracker of a second semi-final against World No.2 Iga Swiatek , fighting off a match point to clinch the roller-coaster affair 5-7, 6-1, 7-6 (8) in 2-hours and 35 minutes.After trading serves for the first two sets, Swiatek and Keys held on to their serves for the first nine games of the deciding set.With the 23-year-old Swiatek serving to stay in the match in the tenth game, Keys, the 19th seed, was in all-out attack mode, but the Pole levelled scores and in the following game shot ahead to 0-40. She then converted on her third breakpoint, drilling a winner. Keys swung hard, coming out strong when the Pole had match point and Swiatek finally double faulted at breakpoint.In the match tie-break, Swiatek was ahead for the better part, but Keys was never out of the contest and raised her level to cross the line.""I'm in the final woo hoo!"" Keys said. ""The match was such a high level, Even though I lost the first set I had momentum going into the second, the third set was up-and-down and we had a 10-point match tie-break to make it extra dramatic. We were pushing each other -- who can get the final point and who can be better, I'm happy it's me.""","Aryna Sabalenka beats Paula Badosa 6-4, 6-2 to reach Australian Open final. Belarusian bidding to become first woman to win three Australian Open titles in a row since Martina Hingis (1997 to 1999) World No.2 Madison Keys fights off a match point to beat Iga Swiatek.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117491670,imgsize-68076,width-400,resizemode-4/117491670.jpg"

The Times of India in Melbourne:

Ben Shelton uses his words almost as well as he times his serves, nailing it effortlessly.The 22-year-old, ranked 20, has scored with his serve at Melbourne Park. The 6 ft 4' left-hander is tied with Frenchman Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard for the fastest serve of the tournament (so far), clocked at 232 kmph; in his 92 service games Shelton has been broken just six times.Shelton -- whose unruly mop of curls is harnessed by a headband, which gives him a bohemian edge -- is the surprise Australian Open semifinalist. The youngest of the four men and the only one ranked outside the top-10. Shelton will take on the World No.1 Jannik Sinner in the second match on Rod Laver Arena on Friday after the second seed Alexander Zverev opens the semifinal Friday against the seventh-seed, the 24-time Grand Slam champion Novak Djokovic Like the 27-year-old Zverev, younger by a decade to his opponent, and trails the head-to-head against Djokovic 4-8, Shelton has beaten Sinner just once in five meetings. Meanwhile Djokovic who appeared to injure his left hamstring and struggled for a stretch in the second set against Carlos Alcaraz in the quarterfinals, before pulling away for a gutsy win, will need to be at his best physically against the German. He didn't practice at Melbourne Park on Thursday.Shelton, who took two online classes with the University of Florida in entrepreneurship and international business in 2023, is a sharpshooter off the court.After his quarterfinal win on Wednesday, Shelton called out the interviewers, doing the on-court, post-match interviews, saying they were 'negative'.Shelton said, ""Today on the court (it was), 'hey, Ben, how does it feel that no matter who you play in your next match, no-one is going to be cheering for you?'.""It may be true, but I just don't think the comment is respectful from a guy I've never met before in my life,"" Shelton said. ""The broadcasters should be helping us grow our sport . I feel like there's just been a lot of negativity, that's something that needs to change.""Earlier, the 10-time Australian Open champion Djokovic protested against Aussie sports commentator Tony Jones' disparaging remarks on him and his countrymen, and Shelton, at the end of a media conference on Wednesday, told journalists he wanted to address an issue, saying the Djokovic incident wasn't an isolated case.Shelton, in his second Grand Slam semi-final, after making the last four at the US Open in 2023, took time to appreciate his journey, the distance he has travelled.""I'm not sure this is what I expected when my career started,"" Shelton said. ""As a kid, once I stopped playing football, I was always a little bit heavy. Not fat, but just, like, heavy, carrying a lot of weight. I always struggled physically.""""I saw a stat, I'm 24 and 9 in Grand Slams, for me it's really special to be playing at these big tournaments and playing my best tennis at the big tournaments,"" the American said.Against Sinner, Shelton will have to play his A Game.""I've been, in terms of my baseline play, a bit more conservative this tournament, going deep in rallies. I probably have to step that up a little bit in the semifinals,"" Shelton said. ""You have to choose your moments, still be confident in the things that you trust. I think that I'm figuring out ways to make guys uncomfortable without just playing at my upper limits and slapping.""Sinner, who struggled with the heat in the fourth-round against Holger Rune, going off court and having the doctor look at him, showed he was back at his best against Alex de Minaur in the quarterfinals.The 23-year-old enjoys playing in the evening when it's cooler, in conditions he is used to.""One of the biggest serves we have on Tour,"" Sinner said of Shelton. ""He's a very aggressive player, an all-around player, he can go to the net, stay back.""Not quite the serve versus the return contest, more all-court play from both sides of the net.","Ben Shelton is the youngest of the four men and the only one ranked outside the top-10.

NEW DELHI: Aryna Sabalenka , the defending champion and world number one , advanced to her third consecutive Australian Open final on Wednesday by defeating her close friend Paula Badosa in straight sets, 6-4, 6-2.The match took place at the Rod Laver Arena , where Sabalenka has enjoyed tremendous success, winning 20 consecutive matches at the Australian Open.Sabalenka's victory puts her on the brink of achieving a remarkable feat -– winning three consecutive Australian Open titles, something that hasn't been accomplished in the 21st century.The last player to achieve this was Martina Hingis in 1999, and only four other women have managed to win three consecutive Australian Open titles: Margaret Court, Evonne Goolagong, Steffi Graf, and Monica Seles.Despite their close friendship, with Sabalenka previously describing Badosa as her ""best friend"" and ""soulmate,"" the match was a highly competitive affair.Badosa, seeded 11th, had stunned world number three Coco Gauff in the previous round to reach her maiden Grand Slam semi-final at the age of 27.The first set was closely contested, with Badosa taking an early lead before Sabalenka found her rhythm and rallied to claim the set 6-4. In the second set, Sabalenka's powerful baseline game proved too much for Badosa, and the Belarusian secured a 6-2 victory.Sabalenka's win keeps her in contention to retain her world number one ranking, which would have been taken over by Iga Swiatek had she lost. The final will determine the new world number one, with Sabalenka facing either Swiatek or Madison Keys.For Badosa, despite the loss, her run to the semi-finals caps a remarkable comeback after a brutal back injury in 2023 that nearly led her to consider retirement. Her performance in Melbourne will see her return to the top 10 for the first time since October 2022.",Aryna Sabalenka beats Paula Badosa to reach third consecutive Australian Open final.

The Times of India in Melbourne:

Alex de Minaur had produced his best tennis to make the Australian Open quarterfinal, but on Rod Laver Arena on Wednesday, playing before an adoring full-house that called out to him, cheering him on, ‘let’s go Demon, let’s go’, the world No. 8 threw up his arms in frustration, he shook his head and gestured at his box, but there was no respite, the barrage coming at him from across the net was relentless.World No. 1 Jannik Sinner may not have silenced the voluble crowd, who were firmly behind the home hope, but he owned the last-eight clash, taking it by the scruff, to score a 6-3, 6-2, 6-1 win in one-hour and 48-minutes.Sinner won 32 of 38 points on his first serve and 17 of 21 on his second, against one of the better returns in the game, so complete was the Italian’s dominance that he clocked 27 winners.The world no.8, who recorded his best Australian Open result, by reaching the quarterfinals this year, said of his opponent, “He was bl#$dy good tonight.”The defending champion, who struggled against Holger Rune in the fourth round, taking a 11-plus minute medical timeout and getting treated by the doctor, revealed that he hadn’t woken up feeling his best on Monday.The 23-year-old had refused to go into the details, only going so far as to say the hot, humid conditions were not ideal for him.On Wednesday there was talk around the grounds that Sinner might withdraw from the tournament as he wasn’t on the practice schedule, but as it turned out, the top-seed enjoyed an indoor session warming-up for the late-evening match.Sinner said he was able to recover with sleep and a light 30-minute hit with his coaches Darren Cahill and Simone Vagnozzi.The Italian, who watched the entire Carlos Alcaraz-Novak Djokovic quarterfinal on Tuesday, woke up this morning and typed out a message to his team saying, ‘I’m ready for today’.“I feel like today I was feeling everything,” Sinner said. “When you break so early in each set it's a bit easier. But he's a tough competitor, an amazing player. So many people came here for him tonight, it was an amazing atmosphere. Thank you, guys for being so fair.”Sinner, who enjoyed a 9-0 record against De Minaur coming into the last-eight clash, said, “We know each other quite well. We played so many times, we know each other's game so we try to prepare in the best possible way. These matches can go quickly, but things can change fast.""Sinner’s form is sizzling -- he has only lost one match from mid-August and none since October, in that period he has won two masters 1000s, the ATP Finals , US Open and Davis Cup, the only match he has lost in the time was to Carlos Alcaraz in the final in Beijing.In Friday’s second semifinal Sinner will play the charismatic American Ben Shelton , who put out Italian Lorenzo Sonego 6-4, 7-5, 4-6, 7-6 (4) earlier on Wednesday.",World No. 1 Jannik Sinner beats Alex de Minaur in straight sets.

NEW DELHI: Defending champion Jannik Sinner dashed home hopes on Wednesday with a commanding straight-set victory over Alex de Minaur to secure a spot in the Australian Open semi-finals against Ben Shelton .The Italian world number one showed no signs of the illness that troubled him in his previous match, storming past the eighth seed 6-3, 6-2, 6-1 on Rod Laver Arena in Melbourne.Sinner’s emphatic win keeps his title defense alive as he eyes a place in Sunday’s final against either 10-time champion Novak Djokovic or second seed Alexander Zverev.Shelton, the 21st seed, earned his semi-final berth by overcoming Italy’s unseeded Lorenzo Sonego in a hard-fought battle, winning 6-4, 7-5, 4-6, 7-6 (7/4). The American, making his first Australian Open last-four appearance, now faces Sinner for a chance at the title.The outcome seemed inevitable for De Minaur, who had lost all nine of his previous encounters with Sinner. The Italian also boasts an impeccable record against Australian players, with 20 consecutive wins.There were doubts about Sinner’s fitness after he struggled with illness in his last-16 match, where he admitted feeling dizzy in the sweltering heat. However, the cooler conditions of the quarter-final saw him in peak form, moving effortlessly and showing no signs of discomfort.Roared on by a partisan home crowd, De Minaur initially held his own, but Sinner seized control with a decisive break for a 3-1 lead after an intense 24-shot rally. From there, Sinner’s powerful baseline game and precise ball-striking left the Australian scrambling. De Minaur managed just four winners in the opening set as Sinner dictated play.The second set followed a similar script, with Sinner immediately breaking serve and dominating the exchanges. A stunning forehand winner earned him another break as he raced through the set in just 40 minutes, leaving De Minaur visibly frustrated.Despite his best efforts, De Minaur had no answers in the third set. A string of unforced errors saw him broken twice, with Sinner cruising to a 3-0 lead before wrapping up the match.Sinner, who defeated Daniil Medvedev in last year’s final, is aiming to become the first Italian man to win three Grand Slam titles. He also claimed the US Open crown in 2023 and is now bidding to defend a major title for the first time.Awaiting Sinner in Friday’s semi-final is 22-year-old Shelton, who has rapidly established himself as a rising star. The American reached his first Grand Slam semi-final at the US Open in 2023, where he was stopped by Djokovic.Against Sonego, Shelton relied on his booming serve, including a 232kph (144mph) ace—the fastest of the tournament. After taking the first two sets, Shelton endured a wobble in the third but regrouped to win a tense fourth-set tiebreak.Reflecting on his win, Shelton was unfazed about his next opponent. ""If it’s the home favorite Alex de Minaur, you can boo me, throw stuff at me. I get it,"" Shelton joked with the crowd. ""If it’s the world number one, probably the same thing. But I’ve got a few fans here too.""Shelton, visibly relieved, also praised Sonego’s performance. “Shout out to Lorenzo Sonego—that was some ridiculous tennis,” he said with a smile.",Jannik Sinner beats Alex de Minaur in straight sets to reach Australian Open semi-finals.

""He accepted to work with me, he's giving all his support to me, to the whole team, and trying to make it work.""""This was a huge win for all of us, Andy and myself, for the relationship.

The Times of India in Melbourne:

Iga Swiatek is where she should be in late January, in the semi-finals of the Australian Open . The World No.2, who has dropped just 14 games in the tournament so far, is as crisp as a minted banknote.Swiatek, aiming to go further than her best showing in Melbourne Park, when she made the semi-final in 2022, is up against American Madison Keys , who is in her third semi-final here and hoping to make it third time lucky. Thursday's first semi final pits best friends on the Tour Paula Badosa against world No.1 Aryna Sabalenka .Keys, ranked 19, came through her quarterfinal encounter with a 3-6, 6-3, 6-4 victory over the No.28th seed Elina Svitolina . Keys’ 49 winners unlocked the contest after the American fell behind early in the match.Swiatek, who was on court for 89 minutes on Wednesday, eased past the No.8 seed Emma Navarro 6-1, 6-2 using her solid all-round game to outplay the American.Keys trails Swiatek 1-4 in head-to-head clashes.“Iga is tough to beat because she plays with a lot of spin on both sides, she’s a good server, returner and moves incredibly well,” the 29-year-old American said. “The biggest thing that makes her so difficult to beat is, if you miss your spot even slightly, she has enough time to recover, and then the point goes back to neutral.”Swiatek, who likes to keep her opponents on the move, makes it difficult for players to get into a dominant position against her on the court.“Most of us are not really going to try to out-defend Iga,” the American said. “So then there's a balance of being aggressive and trying to get her to move, but not pressing too hard and not going for anything too quickly. She does such a good job of making people start going for too much too quickly.”Swiatek the hardest player in the women’s draw to put away, courtesy her solidity, could be tested by Keys’ aggressive play.“She likes to play intensely and pretty fast,” Swiatek said of the 29-year-old. “She uses her power, especially on a faster hard court. I need to be ready and be proactive.”Swiatek, 23, who has three bagels and an equal number of breadsticks so far in the tournament, is scrooge-like in the way she competes.“On the tennis court, you kind of need to be ruthless,” she said, adding, “Maybe it looks ruthless, but it's not my goal to do that. I just want to win more and more games.”“I think for me focusing on myself and having the same kind of attitude no matter what the score is important. This is what I base my consistency on, the way I just continue to do the good things on the court,” the Pole said.Swiatek, who worships at the altar of consistency and routine, believes those traits have got her to where she is in the tournament.“Sometimes it's the draw, sometimes how tired I am, sometimes the stress level. It's always a different story and a different journey,” said Swiatek of her struggle in previous years in the season’s opening Grand Slam .“These tournaments are long. Even if you start amazing, something can happen during the two weeks,” she said. “I wouldn't say something feels super different (this time). Probably, I'm just relaxed and just focused on the right things. I don't have anything that is disturbing me.”","Iga Swiatek will face Madison Keys in the Australian Open semi-finals.

Australian Open: Emma Navarro urges rule change after double-bounce furore in Melbourne,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/australian-open-emma-navarro-urges-rule-change-after-double-bounce-furore-in-melbourne/articleshow/117451851.cms,"Iga Swiatek and Emma Navarro (AP Photo)

NEW DELHI: Iga Swiatek 's dominant run at the Australian Open has been impressive, but a controversial moment occurred during her quarterfinal match against Emma Navarro .In a crucial point, Swiatek appeared to fail to reach a ball before it bounced twice, but the chair umpire did not call a fault, allowing play to continue.This incident reignited the debate over the use of video reviews in tennis . Navarro expressed frustration over the lack of video review, believing that players should be allowed to review such instances even if they continue playing the point.She argued that in the heat of the moment, it's difficult to determine whether a double bounce occurred, and video review could provide clarity.""It happened so fast,"" Navarro said. ""You hit the shot, and she hits it back, and you're just, like, 'Oh, I guess I'm playing'. In the back of your head you're like, 'Okay, maybe I can still win the point even though it wasn't called. It's going to be a downer if I stop the point and it turns out it wasn't a double bounce'. It's tough. I think we should be able to see it afterwards and make that call.""Swiatek, on the other hand, admitted that she was unsure whether the ball had bounced twice or if she had hit it with her frame.""I wasn't sure if it was a double bounce or I hit it with my frame (of the racquet). It was hard to say because I was full sprinting,"" said the five-time Grand Slam champion. ""I don't remember even seeing the contact point. I don't know. Sometimes you don't really look when you hit the ball. I thought this is like the umpire's kind of job to call it. I was also waiting for the VAR, but I didn't see it, so I just kind of proceeded.""","Iga Swiatek and Emma Navarro clashed during quarterfinal match at Australian Open.

Poll Should Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli retire from ODIs after the series in Australia? Yes, it's time for them to step down. No, they should continue for the World Cup. Only if they are not performing well.

Greenstone Lobo predicts Virat Kohli & Rohit Sharma's ODI future

CHENNAI: Virat Kohli fans across the world breathed a sigh of relief when the ODI master posted a picture of himself on social media taking throwdowns in the nets in London. Around the same time, Rohit Sharma was also pictured returning to India, probably with the intent of preparing for a season of cricket ahead.Over the last couple of months, as the new Team India, under Shubman Gill , went from strength to strength, snatching a famous 2-2 draw in the Test series in England, a narrative started gaining traction. Is this the end of Kohli and Rohit? Should Gill be made the captain of the ODI team as well? Questions were being asked in different forums.The fact that neither Rohit nor Virat, who announced their T20 retirements in 2024 and hung up their boots in Test cricket earlier this year, were playing any cricket of late added fuel to the speculations. But for now, it seems Rohit and Virat may give it a final shot to the format that they made absolutely their own in the last decade and a half.While power hitters have taken over T20s and the extreme interrogation of red-ball cricket seems to be taking a toll on these two giants, they are still comfortable playing ODIs. In the Champions Trophy earlier this year, which India won, Kohli scored 218 runs from five games while Rohit managed a respectable 180.There was some talk that the duo might call it quits after that, but no announcement was forthcoming.The next ODI World Cup is in South Africa, Zimbabwe, and Namibia in OctNov 2027, and it is still more than two years away. India, starting from Oct this year, have 27 scheduled ODIs before the World Cup, in addition to the Asia Cup in 2027, which is in the 50-over format. It is a long way off, and there’s some speculation about the BCCI giving Rohit and Virat a farewell three-match series in Australia in Oct.Former India captain and BCCI president Sourav Ganguly played it safe in a programme in Kolkata when asked about it. “I am not aware of it… Whoever does well will play. If they do well, they should continue. Kohli’s One-day record is phenomenal, even Rohit’s. Both are phenomenal in white-ball cricket,” he stressed.The big problem, though, is that both Rohit and Virat haven’t played much cricket since the Champions Trophy, and the game tends to move very fast. Middlesex and Surrey, two London-based sides, apparently showed interest in signing Virat up for the Royal London One Day Cup, but the deal didn’t go through.If Virat and Rohit want to extend their ODI careers beyond Oct, they may have to play domestic One-day tournaments like the Vijay Hazare Trophy in Dec and before that the A series against both Australia and South Africa, in addition to international cricket. At this stage of their careers, there seems to be a bit of a question mark over whether these two legends will be keen to go through the rigours of domestic One-day cricket all over again in obscure centres.Former India opener and national selector Devang Gandhi has a clear take on the issue. He feels that the younger crop has proved beyond doubt that they are ready for every challenge in the recently-concluded Test series. “How will you make players like Yashasvi Jaiswal , Rishabh Pant, Sai Sudharshan, among others, sit out when they have shown how well they can adapt? The bigger transition is from T20s to Tests. Once a player has done well in Test cricket and has the power game, ODIs should come easier to them. It is very important that the selectors and the team management sit together and take a call,” Gandhi told TOI.According to him, game-time is absolutely vital, and the selectors should take an honest call on whether they are convinced that Virat and Rohit will be at the top of their games in two years’ time. “If, say, in a year’s time, we come to a situation where one of them is not firing and we need a replacement, the team management may not have enough time to prepare a player for the job,” Gandhi said.The captaincy issue, too, is vital, and the selectors need to take a call. Gill, quite clearly, has shown he is ready for the job in Tests. Meanwhile, on current form, Gill is arguably India’s best batsman in the ODI format, with an average of 59.04 and a strike rate of 99.56. With his performances, he commands the respect of the team, and ODI captaincy should come easy to him.“There’s absolutely no doubt about the contribution of Rohit and Virat. But time doesn’t wait for anybody,” Gandhi stressed.","Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma could be playing their last ODI series Down Under in October. The next ODI World Cup is in South Africa, Zimbabwe, and Namibia in OctNov 2027, and it is still more than two years away. India, starting from Oct this year, have 27 scheduled ODIs before the World Cup.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123227129,imgsize-89496,width-400,resizemode-4/123227129.jpg"

Poll What do you think about Babar Azam's performance in the second ODI against West Indies? He needs to improve his shot selection He should be dropped from the team He will bounce back in the next match It's just a phase, every player goes through it

Former Pakistan captain Babar Azam’s woeful run of form continued as he was clean bowled for a duck in the second ODI against the West Indies at Tarouba.Babar had scored a scratchy 47 in the first ODI but registered a three-ball duck in the second match, falling to Jayden Seales.Babar was left visibly stunned, gesturing in disbelief at the brilliance of the delivery. While it was indeed a fine ball, his shot selection raised questions — attempting a flick with only the half-face of the bat against a moving delivery proved costly, as it shattered his stumps. His dismissal deepened Pakistan’s woes, with the team reeling at 139/6 in 33.5 overs at the time of writing.Babar walked in at 37/1 after Pakistan lost Saim Ayub in the ninth over, having opted to bat first. Seales, already in rhythm after dismissing Ayub, delivered two dot balls to start. His third delivery was fuller, seaming away just enough to beat Babar’s flick. Off-balance, Babar missed completely, and the ball snuck between bat and pad to crash into the stumps.The dismissal added to Babar’s ongoing struggles in ODIs this year, where he is averaging just over 30 at a sluggish strike rate of 80. His poor form has already cost him a place in Pakistan’s T20I squad, having been dropped due to slow scoring.Roston Chase and Justin Greaves led the West Indies to a five-wicket victory over Pakistan with 10 balls to spare in the rain-reduced second one-day international on Sunday, leveling the three-match series at 1-1.Chase’s 49 not out off 47 balls included two sixes and the winning boundary as the West Indies scored 184-5 in 33.2 overs.The hosts were chasing a revised target of 181 in 35 overs under the DLS method after multiple rain interruptions saw Pakistan’s innings end at 171-7 in 37 overs. Right-arm fast bowler Jayden Seales took 3-23 in seven overs.The West Indies stumbled from 101-3 after 18 overs at the Brian Lara Stadium in Tarouba, Trinidad and Tobago, to 111-5 off 24 overs, including the wicket of Sherfane Rutherford, who hit a 33-ball 45 with three sixes and four fours.Chase and Greaves (26 off 31) then shared an unbroken 77-run partnership for the sixth wicket.",Babar Azam bowled for a duck by Jayden Seales in second ODI. West Indies won by five wickets to level three-match series at 1-1. Roston Chase hit 49 not out as West Indies reached 184-5 in 33.2 overs.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123227649,imgsize-17712,width-400,resizemode-4/123227649.jpg"

Poll Do you think wicketkeepers have an advantage in playing against wrist spinners? Yes, definitely No, not really

NEW DELHI: Former India wicket-keeper batter Dinesh Karthik has offered a masterclass on how to handle the modern generation of wrist spinners — with Afghanistan’s Rashid Khan at the forefront — and explained why wicketkeepers often have an edge in reading them.Speaking on Sky Sports, Karthik said wicketkeepers’ familiarity with wrist spin gives them a subconscious advantage. “I would say if you read it better, the one shot most keepers play really well is the sweep shot. Sometimes they don’t have any other shot other than that, but that they do nicely, and hence playing spin comes slightly more easily. Also, you gotta understand when you do keeping, you do so much of it to wrist spinners. Subconsciously, it’s embedded in your mind as to what you want to pick,” Karthik explained.He also highlighted the physical aspect of keeping: “We’re slightly ahead of the normal batter in playing wrist spin at times. And the fact that we have a lot of lower body strength, so we stay slightly crouched at our crease, so we pick up cues much better than a lot of others.”Taking Rashid Khan as an example, Karthik pointed out an interesting statistic — only one wicketkeeper-batter appears in the list of top five players who have performed well against the Afghan star: “If you see that stat, he’s [Sanju Samson] the only wicketkeeping batsman who’s on that, which tells you that batters have gotten really good as well.”As for a key technical takeaway, Karthik said the slog sweep — played with a flat-batted swing — remains one of the most effective tools. “Flat batted swing always negates how much spin there is on the pitch. And that is a very useful tool to have when you play some of these wrist spinners,” he concluded.",Former India wicket-keeper batter Dinesh Karthik has offered a masterclass on how to handle the modern generation of wrist spinners.

Poll Do you believe that watching great performances can inspire young athletes? Yes, absolutely No, it's overrated

NEW DELHI: India wicketkeeper-batter Sanju Samson has revealed that Sachin Tendulkar ’s legendary “Desert Storm” innings in Sharjah in 1998 was the moment that convinced him he could one day play for India.The knock — 143 off 131 balls against Australia — is remembered as one of Tendulkar’s most iconic efforts. Although India lost that match, Sachin’s brilliance ensured qualification for the finals. For a young Samson, it was a turning point.“I was watching a game sitting in Delhi police quarters or police colony room on a small TV. Sachin sir was batting in that game, the Sharjah storm innings, he was just smashing the bowlers. So, that moment it actually struck me that ‘Sanju, you can also do that’. That actually inspired me the most,” Samson said in a conversation with R Ashwin.The Rajasthan Royals skipper, who joined the franchise in 2013, recalled how his early career was shaped by opportunities created by senior players. Before RR, Samson had a stint with Kolkata Knight Riders but did not break into the playing XI. His breakthrough came after impressing former Kerala teammate S Sreesanth , who later introduced him to Rahul Dravid during RR trials.“Rahul sir used to just practice, practice, practice, and that is how I saw him when I was a 14-year-old kid. The second time was when Sreesanth bhai took me to the RR trials at the age of 17. He used to take 5-7 players from Kerala every year for trials. We used to play Ranji together, and one game he did not see me in the team. So, he called up the secretary and asked why is Sanju not in the team. Next day I flew to play against Andhra, and I scored a 100 in front of him,” Samson said.Samson played for RR from 2013 to 2015, returned in 2018 after a stint with Delhi Daredevils, and has since become the face of the franchise — but it all started with that one stormy day in Sharjah.","India wicketkeeper-batter Sanju Samson has revealed that Sachin Tendulkar ’s legendary ‘Desert Storm’ innings in Sharjah in 1998 was the moment that convinced him he could one day play for India.

Poll Do you believe Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma should continue playing ODIs until the 2027 World Cup? Yes, they should play. No, it's time to retire. Only if they are performing well.

The Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ) is in no rush to make decisions about the ODI futures of cricket stars Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma , despite ongoing speculation. The matter has gained attention as India's next ODI series against Australia approaches in October, with questions arising about whether the duo, who have collectively scored 83 ODI hundreds and over 25,000 runs, can continue playing until the 2027 ODI World Cup.India's scheduled ODI series against Bangladesh in August has been canceled, making the Australia series from October 19-25 their next one-day international commitment.The age factor has become a significant talking point, as Kohli and Rohit would be 39 and 40 years old respectively by the 2027 ODI World Cup.""Obviously, if they (Rohit and Kohli) have something in mind, they would tell the BCCI brass like they did before the England Test tour.

Poll Do you believe Australia's T20 team can extend their winning streak to 12 matches? Yes No

Australia secured a 17-run victory over South Africa in the first T20 match in Darwin on Sunday, marking international cricket's return to the city after 17 years. Tim David's explosive 83-run innings, featuring eight sixes, propelled Australia to 178 all out, while South Africa managed 161-9 despite Ryan Rickelton's 71-run effort.It was the ninth straight win in T20Is for the Australian team, but interestingly, Afghanistan and India are still ahead in the list of most consecutive victories in T20Is by a full member nation. Both India and Afghanistan have won 12 T20Is in a row.The longest winning streak in T20I history belongs to Uganda, who racked up 17 consecutive victories. Previously, Pakistan and New Zealand had each managed nine wins on the trot, while England’s best run in the format stands at eight straight matches.Meanwhile, David's aggressive knock came off 52 balls and proved crucial after Australia lost five key batsmen within the first seven overs. His powerful hitting included several sixes that landed on the stadium roof.The match also saw 19-year-old Kwena Maphaka become the youngest bowler among full ICC member countries to claim a four-wicket haul, finishing with figures of 4-20. However, his achievement was overshadowed by David's remarkable batting display.Australian captain Mitchell Marsh began the three-match series with a six off the first ball from Lungi Ngidi. The hosts then faced a collapse as Kagiso Rabada claimed both openers, and Maphaka made further inroads into the middle order.Travis Head departed for just 2 runs after being caught by Maphaka at short third man. Marsh followed soon after when Maphaka took a well-judged running catch at square leg.Cameron Green contributed a quickfire 35 off 13 balls before being caught by wicketkeeper Rickelton. Josh Inglis fell to George Linde's first delivery, failing to clear the point fielder.David’s innings received a lifeline when Tristan Stubbs dropped a straightforward catch in the outfield after the batsman had reached his fifty. He went on to form a 59-run partnership with Ben Dwarshuis, who scored 17.South Africa's chase began poorly, losing three wickets during the powerplay and slumping to 48-3. Captain Aiden Markram, back after resting during the Zimbabwe triangular series, briefly showed promise before being caught in the covers.Rickelton and Stubbs revived South Africa's hopes with a 72-run partnership. However, Josh Hazlewood's double strike in the 15th over shifted the momentum back to Australia.The visitors lost four wickets for just three runs as their chase faltered. Adam Zampa, despite struggling with a wet ball earlier, finished with figures of 2-33, dismissing Corbin Bosch and Senuran Muthusamy off the final two balls of his spell.Hazlewood ended with impressive figures of 3-27, while Dwarshuis matched him with 3-26. The victory extended Australia's winning streak in T20 internationals to nine matches.The match concluded dramatically when Nathan Ellis was run out off the final ball, marking the first time South Africa had bowled out Australia in a T20 match. Glenn Maxwell's spectacular catch to dismiss Rickelton in the final over sealed the home team's victory.","Australia secured a 17-run victory over South Africa in the first T20 match in Darwin on Sunday.

More Than a Team: The Rise of CSK & the Whistle Podu Army

WATCH

NEW DELHI: Ahead of the next edition of the Indian Premier League in 2026, the speculations over MS Dhoni's future with the Chennai Super Kings refuses to die down. After a bottom-of-the-table finish in IPL 2025, the big question is whether the five-time champions' long-time talisman will return for one more season.The 44-year-old, who has been battling persistent knee issues, made a public appearance recently where he was quizzed about his plans for IPL 2026.“I don't know whether I'll play or not. I have time to decide. I have some time until December, so I'll take another couple of months, and then finally, I can make my decision,” Dhoni told the host.From the crowd, a fan passionately urged, “You have to play, sir.” Dhoni, known for his sharp wit, instantly drew laughter with his response: “Arre, ghutne me jo dard hota hai uska take care kaun karega? (The pain I have in my knees, who will take care of that?)”The video of the interaction has since went viral on social media,Dhoni's knee has been a talking point for the past few seasons. Right after leading CSK to a dramatic title in IPL 2023 by defeating Gujarat Titans, he underwent surgery in Mumbai. The veteran wicketkeeper-batter had played that season through discomfort, delaying the operation until after the campaign to allow a proper rehabilitation period before IPL 2024.In the last two editions, Dhoni has batted lower down the order, largely to manage his knee issue.Whether he dons the yellow jersey again in 2026 remains uncertain, but one thing is clear: with every witty one-liner, Dhoni is keeping fans guessing — and the conversation alive.","CSK finished bottom-of-the-table in IPL 2025.

Jayden Seales was the pick of the West Indies bowlers, claiming 3-23 in seven overs. Hasan Nawaz once again top-scored for the visitors with an unbeaten 36 off 30 balls, following up his 63 not out in the series opener. His late flourish included three sixes, two coming in what proved to be the final over before rain intervened. Hussain Talat made 31, but skipper Mohammad Rizwan struggled for momentum, falling lbw to Gudakesh Motie for 16 off 38 balls.The West Indies’ reply wobbled at 107/5 in the 22nd over after Sherfane Rutherford’s entertaining 45 from 33 balls, which featured three sixes and four fours, ended. However, Chase and Greaves calmly guided the side home to set up a winner-takes-all clash.“We had to come in and level the series, so very pleased,” Chase said afterwards.The decisive third ODI will be played at the same venue on Tuesday.

Poll What did you think of the fan's one-handed catch during the match? Incredible skill! Just lucky, I don't think it was that amazing.

A fan in the stands stole the spotlight during the Australia vs South Africa T20I at Marrara Cricket Ground, Darwin, on Sunday, pulling off what fans are calling the “catch of the year. ”The moment came in Australia’s innings when Tim David smashed a delivery from Corbin Bosch over the fence. Bosch could only watch in frustration as the ball sailed into the crowd. But instead of landing in the seats, it was caught one-handed by a spectator who also had two cans clutched in his other hand. Cameras quickly zoomed in to capture the brilliant piece of skill and composure, sparking cheers across the ground.Earlier, South Africa had won the toss and opted to bowl first. Australia got off to a shaky start, losing Mitchell Marsh to make it 30/3. Tim David then came to the rescue, smashing an 83 off 52 balls to drag his side back from trouble.He was the only batter to truly find rhythm amid the collapse, farming the strike and denying singles to protect the tail.Despite his heroics, Australia were bowled out for 178 in 20 overs. Dwarshuis and Ellis chipped in with handy contributions, while Kagiso Rabada impressed with the new ball, Maphaka’s skiddy pace forced mishits, and Muthusamy was outstanding in the middle overs.The innings was a mix of bold hitting and untimely dismissals. Travis Head tried to pierce the off-side against Rabada but fell early. Marsh played one shot too many, Inglis swung without a sighter, Cam Green looked dangerous until undone by a slower ball from Ngidi, and Mitch Owen lost his stumps to a wild swing. Maxwell too fell trying to hit out, leaving Australia reeling at 75/6 before David’s counterattack.Australia’s 13 sixes equalled their joint-most in a T20I against South Africa, matching their effort in Durban in 2023. Yet, for many, the standout moment was not a boundary or a milestone, but rather, the calm, one-handed grab by a fan who refused to spill a drop.","A fan in the stands took a catch during the Australia vs South Africa T20I at Marrara Cricket Ground, Darwin, on Sunday.

Poll Do you believe Crystal Palace can continue to build on their recent success? Yes, they are on the rise! No, it was just a lucky win.

Crystal Palace secured their first-ever Community Shield victory by defeating Premier League champions Liverpool 3-2 on penalties after a 2-2 draw at Wembley Stadium on Sunday. The match was played against the backdrop of tragedy following the death of Liverpool forward Diogo Jota in a car accident alongside his brother Andre Silva.Liverpool's new signings Hugo Ekitike and Jeremie Frimpong scored for their side, while Palace responded through Jean-Philippe Mateta and Ismaila Sarr to force the game into penalties. Palace goalkeeper Dean Henderson proved decisive in the shootout, saving attempts from Alexis Mac Allister and Harvey Elliott, while Mohamed Salah missed his spot-kick.The pre-match ceremony saw Liverpool legend Ian Rush and Palace chairman Steve Parish laying wreaths on the pitch in memory of Jota. The Liverpool end displayed numerous banners and flags paying tribute to the Portuguese international, though a minute's silence was cut short due to crowd disturbances.Liverpool fielded all four of their new summer signings, worth a combined £260 million, including Ekitike, Florian Wirtz, Frimpong, and Milos Kerkez.The club's record-equalling 20th league title last season prompted this significant investment in new talent.Ekitike, who joined from Eintracht Frankfurt for £69 million, made an immediate impact by scoring just four minutes into the match from Wirtz's assist. His performance came amid speculation about Liverpool's pursuit of Newcastle striker Alexander Isak.Palace, making their debut appearance in the Community Shield, demonstrated their ability to compete with Premier League elite. After Mateta missed a one-on-one opportunity against Alisson Becker, Sarr won a penalty after being fouled by Virgil van Dijk . Mateta converted the spot-kick to level the score.Liverpool's players wore a ""Forever 20"" emblem, commemorating Jota's retired shirt number, which they will display throughout the season. The team regained the lead when Frimpong's cross unexpectedly found the far corner of the net.Despite creating opportunities, including a missed chance by Ekitike from another Wirtz pass, Liverpool showed defensive vulnerabilities. Palace capitalized on this weakness when Sarr scored his fourth goal in seven matches against Liverpool, connecting with Adam Wharton's through ball.The match saw additional drama with a VAR review for a potential handball by Mac Allister before proceeding directly to penalties. In the shootout, Palace's Justin Devenny emerged as the unlikely hero, scoring the decisive penalty to secure the trophy.The victory builds on Palace's recent success, following their first major trophy win against Manchester City in May's FA Cup final. The result suggests Palace's growing stature in English football while highlighting potential defensive concerns for Liverpool's new-look squad under manager Slot.The match served as both the traditional season opener and a poignant tribute to Jota, whose tragic loss cast a shadow over Liverpool's pre-season preparations and summer transfer activities.","Crystal Palace defeated Premier League champions Liverpool 3-2 on penalties.

Fortuna Düsseldorf chairman Klaus Allofs has defended the German club’s decision to withdraw from signing Israeli striker Shon Weissman following opposition from sections of the fanbase over the player’s social media activity relating to the Gaza conflict.The second-division side had been in advanced talks to bring Weissman from Spanish club Granada but announced on Tuesday that the move would not go ahead. While the club did not specify the reason at the time, a later statement explained that Weissman’s past online statements and how they were handled did not align with Fortuna’s values.Fans had raised objections to the 29-year-old’s posts expressing support for Israel’s actions in Gaza after the events of October 7, 2023. Weissman has since set his Instagram account to private.Speaking ahead of Düsseldorf’s match against Hannover on Saturday, Allofs rejected claims the club’s stance was antisemitic. “It’s absurd, to put it bluntly,” he said. “We tried to sign a player, which is legitimate. It's also part of our values, that we don't limit ourselves with prejudices and rule things out from the start.”Allofs added that the decision was reached after consultation with Jewish community members in Düsseldorf, noting that while the process could have been quicker, the club wanted to consider the matter carefully.Weissman, who joined Granada in 2022, had previously faced security concerns related to his social media activity. Shortly after the October 2023 events, he missed a La Liga match against Osasuna amid worries about the atmosphere from some home fans.The controversy has put Fortuna Düsseldorf in the middle of a broader debate over whether clubs should weigh political or social positions when considering signings.

Egyptian football star Mohamed Salah has publicly challenged UEFA after the death of celebrated Palestinian footballer Suleiman al-Obeid, known as the “Palestinian Pelé,” in southern Gaza.On Wednesday, the Palestine Football Association (PFA) said al-Obeid, 41, was killed when Israeli forces struck a crowd waiting for humanitarian aid. The former national team striker was one of Palestine’s most gifted players, scoring more than 100 career goals and inspiring young footballers across the region.UEFA posted on X (formerly Twitter): “Farewell to Suleiman al-Obeid, the ‘Palestinian Pelé’. A talent who gave hope to countless children, even in the darkest of times.” Salah reposted the tribute with a pointed question: “Can you tell us how he died, where, and why?”Born in Gaza on March 24, 1984, al-Obeid began his career with Khadamat al-Shati before spells with Markaz Shabab al-Am’ari in the West Bank and Gaza Sport.

Vitesse, the second-oldest professional football club in the Netherlands, has lost its professional license after a Utrecht court upheld the KNVB's decision to revoke it. The 133-year-old Arnhem club - which had seen the likes of Mason Mount, Martin Odegaard, Phillip Cocu come through the ranks - was found to have repeatedly violated licensing regulations, leading to its removal from professional football despite last-minute efforts by local investors to save the team.The Royal Dutch Football Association (KNVB) took action against Vitesse for consistently undermining the licensing system.

Despite new Arnhem-based investors, known as De Sterkhouders, acquiring all shares from current owners, this wasn't enough to save the club's professional status.The judge acknowledged the unfortunate nature of the situation but stood firm on the decision. ""The societal interests put forward cannot, given the severity and duration of Vitesse's violations of the licensing system, justify overturning the decision of the KNVB appeals committee,"" the judge stated.The immediate impact of this ruling was clear - Vitesse's scheduled match against Almere City on Saturday afternoon was cancelled.

Days after Oliver Rowland lifted his Formula E World Championship trophy in London this season, an interesting trend has come to the attention of Formula E and its fans. As a coincidence, all Formula E drivers who won the Mexico City E-Prix went on to win the Formula E World Championship that season, and this has been proved right for three consecutive years.Highlighting the same since 2023, a poster of three World Champions was shared on X by Formula E with the caption, “The trend continues. Each winner of the #MexicoCityEPrix from the past three seasons has gone on to become World Champion.”The special poster features 2023 Formula E World Champion Jake Dennis from Andretti, then TAG Heuer Porsche’s Pascal Wehrlein, who won in 2024, and the new World Champion, Nissan driver Oliver Rowland. All three of them won in the Mexico E-Prix and went on to lift the winner’s trophy in the Formula E World Championship that year.Oliver Rowland had strengthened his chances of winning the Formula E World Championship this year much earlier. He was leading the Formula E Driver Standings ever since he won Part 2 of the Jeddah E-Prix, which was his second win of the season after winning the Mexico E-Prix. In the last leg, the Nissan driver got nervous for a while as Pascal Wehrlein, who was following him in the number two position, closed the gap after grabbing quite a few podiums while Rowland had a dull period.Things became serious for Rowland when he failed to finish the Round 13 race in Berlin, while Wehrlein won second spot on the podium. But he eventually managed to confirm his championship in Berlin after four wins and three more podiums.Sharing about his bad race in Berlin, Rowland had said, “I was hoping before the weekend that the outcome could be [the World Championship], but after yesterday (Saturday) and this morning (Sunday), I was more worried that it might never come.”Also Read: Oliver Rowland reacts to daughter’s sweet radio message after Formula E Championship win: “It’s amazing” Things, however, changed for Wehrlein, who was pushed to third position after Nick Cassidy made a late entry in the Formula E Driver Standings by registering three consecutive wins.

Fans hail Taylor Barnard for his fantastic rookie season

It was Taylor Barnard’s rookie season this year, and the NEOM McLaren driver put up a fantastic performance by temporarily making it to the top three in the Formula E Driver Standings by ousting the much more experienced Porsche driver Antonio Felix Da Costa.

Through the early days, the good days, the bad days, and the great days, we have always felt an overwhelming amount of support from you all.”For the partners associated with the team, he wrote, “They say that ‘racing is a state of mind’, and since its inception, this team has had the privilege of working for organisations, with partners, and racing for fans who fully embrace this philosophy.This is certainly true of those at McLaren, whose passion for racing is second to none.”“My heartfelt thanks go out to everyone who has been involved: those at McLaren who backed us, the fans who supported us, and the partners who allowed us to go racing. We couldn’t have done it without you all — your trust and support have never been taken for granted,” he added.Praising the two McLaren drivers, he wrote, “Sam clinched McLaren’s first-ever fully electric win at the São Paulo E-Prix in Season 10, pulling off one of Formula E’s all-time great overtakes, before being waved across the line by none other than Emerson Fittipaldi – McLaren's first Formula 1 World Champion. While Taylor has been a rookie sensation in Season 11, securing five Formula E records, including the youngest driver to start a race, the youngest points scorer, the youngest driver to lead a lap, the youngest podium finisher, and the youngest polesitter. ”He ended the letter saying, “Some of us have been together since the day we first launched this team, while others have seamlessly fitted in along the way and flourished within the environment we have cultivated. For many, I am sure that we will cross paths again soon, but whatever the future holds for those here at Bicester, whatever path they choose to follow, I have no doubt that it will be bright. Their potential is limitless. ”Reacting to the open letter on Instagram, Taylor Barnard wrote, “It’s been an honour to wear Papaya and represent this team.” Sam Bird also dropped a heart emoji and a hands-joined-in-prayer emoji in the comments section.Also Read: Taylor Barnard looks back at rookie season at McLaren: “Every step has been unforgettable” Neither Taylor Barnard nor Sam Bird has revealed their future course of action in Formula E Season 12.

IPL 2025: The second coming of captain Ajinkya Rahane,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/ipl/top-stories/ipl-2025-the-second-coming-of-captain-ajinkya-rahane/articleshow/119237374.cms,"Kolkata Knight Riders' captain Ajinkya Rahane, left, and Venkatesh Iyer (Photo Credit: @KKRiders on X)

KOLKATA: From being almost unsold to assuming the defending champions’ captaincy, Ajinkya Rahane ’s leap has been of more than just faith. Even though Kolkata Knight Riders would have felt they hit a jackpot when Rahane ended up as the best player in the Syed Mushtaq Ali T20 (SMAT) tournament, the veteran might have been more relieved than happy.One of the few players who have remained in the IPL since its inception, he almost missed the bus this time. If the IPL auction provided him a lifeline, SMAT gave him a new lease of life. Having accumulated 432 runs at a strike rate of almost 170, the batter who had gathered the red-ball tag like moss on decaying wood, had once again established his T20 credentials.Less than a month prior to that, KKR had pouched Rahane for his base price of Rs 1.5 crore, that too on a second calling. With Shreyas Iyer gone to Punjab Kings, KKR were perhaps hunting for a captain when the unsold Rahane was brought back under the hammer.The 36-year-old Rahane will also be expected to groom Venkatesh Iyer, six years younger and Rs 22.25 crore costlier, for his shoes. So far, Rahane and Iyer have shared the spotlight almost equally.“Have nothing to prove” and “Living in the moment” have been Rahane’s take since he accepted the KKR captaincy, but that cannot take away the hurt he would have endured when Rajasthan Royals removed him from the post middway in 2019. Rahane exuded confidence at a KKR event on Wednesday, when the team was introduced to the fans in a grand manner.“Great to be back, an honour to lead,” the skipper said, typically in a few words. “We have prepared well, and I am happy that everyone (in the team) is on the same page.”Head coach Chandrakant Pandit echoed Rahane’s sentiment. “It was a special moment to win the trophy (last year),” he said.Having been overshadowed by Gautam Gambhir last year, the coach is looking ahead to a new season, with some help from mentor Dwyane Bravo. The West Indian in his inimitable way, endorsed Rahane, saying that KKR is ready for another campaign.“KKR know how to win a championship, now the idea is to defend one,” said Bravo.Rahane has led 25 times in IPL, 23 of them being with the Royals, although his captaincy record in this tournament is not too flattering, having won only nine games. But the big question remains. Is batter Rahane’s place in the playing XI guaranteed? The issue is up in the air, but as long as he lets his bat do the talking, Rahane will be there. If not, Iyer is always there.","Kolkata Knight Riders captain Ajinkya Rahane won Syed Mushtaq Ali T20 tournament. The 36-year-old was almost unsold at the IPL auction.

He believes that this move will aid bowlers in finding reverse swing, even in conditions that are not conducive to it.""It's very good for bowlers. It's excellent news for us bowlers because when the ball is not doing anything, applying saliva on the ball will increase the chances of finding some reverse swing,"" Siraj told PTI.""It sometimes aids reverse swing because scrubbing the ball against the shirt will not help (to get reverse swing). But using saliva on the ball will help in maintaining (the shine on one side), and it is important.""Siraj, who has joined the Gujarat Titans for the upcoming season, is excited to play under the captaincy of Shubman Gill , whom he considers a ""bowler's captain.""""It's a good feeling to join Gujarat ahead of the new season. Yeah, it was a bit emotional for me to leave RCB because Virat bhai had supported me a lot in tough times, but we have a fantastic team here under Gill. If you talk about Gill, then he is a bowler's captain. He never tries to stop you from trying something new or hinder your plans. We have made our Test debut together (vs Australia in 2020) and we share a very good personal rapport too,"" he said.The Gujarat Titans boast a formidable bowling lineup, including Kagiso Rabada , Rashid Khan, Ishant Sharma, and Gerald Coetzee. Siraj views this as a positive factor, as it fosters healthy competition and eases the burden on individual bowlers.""It is actually a great thing because it is such an experienced line-up and will foster some healthy competition, which is good for the team. These bowlers do not require much guidance and they know their plans. So in that sense, it's a blessing to have such bowlers in a competition like IPL because we have all kinds of bowlers, who have ticked all the right areas,"" he noted.Despite missing out on recent international assignments, Siraj remains focused on his performance in the IPL and is not overly concerned about selection for the national team.""Look, selection is not in my hands. I have only a cricket ball in my hands and I wanted to do as much as I can with that. I don't want to put pressure on myself thinking about selection, as I want to focus on my performance. Yeah aș a player, it remains in the back of your mind that there is a tour of England and the Asia Cup but I don't really seriously think about it, as my focus is on IPL and doing well for Gujarat Titans and helping them win another IPL title,"" he remarked.Siraj is looking forward to working with Ashish Nehra , the Gujarat Titans' coach, and learning from his vast experience as a fast bowler.""As a fast bowler, Ashu bhai has done a lot for Indian cricket, he was a genuine match winner for the country.

3. Kieron Pollard vs Mitchell Starc (2014)

4. MS Dhoni’s Pitch Invasion (2019)

5. Rahul Dravid vs His Cap (2014)

NEW DELHI: As the countdown to 2025 edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL) begins, the buzz is all about fresh rivalries, big hits, and title dreams. But beneath the glitz and glam, the IPL has also served up some heated moments that reminded everyone.Here, TimesofIndia.com takes a look at five unforgettable instances when IPL players let the pressure -- or passion -- get the better of them:The most infamous moment in IPL history came in its very first season. After a match between Mumbai Indians and Kings XI Punjab, Harbhajan Singh allegedly slapped Sreesanth during the post-match handshake.The visuals of a teary-eyed Sreesanth went viral, and Bhajji was handed a season-long suspension. It set the tone, with the incident getting labelled as the infamous ""Slapgate"".Two intense competitors, one heated rivalry. In 2013, a fiery on-field exchange between Kohli and Gambhir during an RCB vs KKR clash nearly came to blows.A decade later in IPL 2023, they clashed again -- this time when Gambhir (mentor of LSG at that time) and Kohli exchanged heated words post-match. Cooler heads had to intervene both times, but the fire between these two continues to smoulder.In a charged face-off between MI and RCB, Starc bowled a bouncer and exchanged words with Pollard. What followed was pure chaos -- Starc ran in aggressively again, and Pollard pulled away last second, only to fling his bat in Starc’s direction in anger.It was a rare moment of Pollard losing composure, and both players were fined heavily.Cool. Calm. Composed. That’s MS Dhoni, right? Well, almost always. But in a 2019 game against Rajasthan Royals, even Dhoni reached boiling point.Unhappy with a no-ball call reversal during CSK's tense chase, he stormed onto the field mid-over to confront the umpires — a rare and shocking outburst from Captain Cool that stunned fans and pundits alike.In one of the most dramatic finishes in IPL history, Mumbai Indians faced Rajasthan Royals in a virtual knockout in 2014, needing to chase down a daunting 190 in just 14.3 overs to qualify for the playoffs. What followed was pure chaos -- MI pulled off the near-impossible thanks to an Aditya Tare six off the final ball that sealed their qualification on net run rate.But beyond the math and madness, it was the sight of the ever-composed Rahul Dravid -- sitting in the RR dugout -- furiously hurling his cap to the ground that captured the emotional toll of the moment. For fans, it was a rare glimpse of The Wall cracking under pressure.These incidents, though controversial, are a reminder that the IPL is more than just big sixes and colourful jerseys. With reputations on the line, national teammates turning into franchise rivals, and every run, wicket, and decision scrutinised -- tempers can and do flare.","The countdown to 2025 edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL) begins.

NEW DELHI: India all-rounder Nitish Kumar Reddy shared how a light-hearted dressing room banter with Virat Kohli led to him receiving a special gift from the former India captain— a pair of shoes that he later wore while scoring his maiden Test century against Australia at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG).“Back in the locker room, he (Kohli) once asked Sarfaraz (Khan), ‘Sarfu, tera size kya hai?’ (Sarfaraz, what’s your shoe size?), and he said, ‘Nine.’ Then he turned to me, and I thought, ‘Oh my god, I have to guess this correctly,’ because even if they weren’t my size, I really wanted his shoes. I said, ‘10,’ and he gave them to me. In the next match, I wore those shoes and scored a hundred!"" Reddy recalled during a podcast on PUMA’s YouTube channel on Thursday.After reaching his first Test hundred in 171 balls at the MCG, Nitish revealed that his eyes were searching for his father, Mutyalu, who was in the stands alongside his mother, sister, and uncle, among the 80,000-odd spectators.“Everyone in the dressing room came up and congratulated me, but I was just looking for one guy—hoping he’d come and talk to me.“When Virat bhai (Kohli) finally walked up and told me I had played a wonderful game, that moment itself was special for me. I was also scanning the stands for my father but couldn’t find him. Later, I saw on the screen that he was crying.”Nitish also shared a fun moment from the Test series in Australia when his Sunrisers Hyderabad teammate Travis Head tried to distract him with some playful sledging.“Travis came up to me and said, ‘Nitish, where are you going to party tonight?’—knowing fully well that I wouldn’t.“Then he went on, ‘Australia is such a great place. Melbourne is an amazing city, you have to go out and chill.’ He was just trying to distract me. I just told him, ‘Okay, Travis, one day we’ll both go and party!’ During another match, he was fielding at short leg and warned me, ‘Nitish, if you hit me, I’ll hit you when you bowl!’” he said.Nitish will next play for Sunrisers Hyderabad in IPL 2025 and spoke about how difficult it was to turn down other franchises in order to stay with a team he considers home.“To be honest, I got some offers. But SRH is one team which I can really connect with. Like, it’s a home team for me. It feels like you’re representing your home team and want to make a wonderful impact in that team.“I just want to perform well and bring that cup back to SRH, and they have shown absolute faith in me. I felt that it’s my time when I have to show faith and regive trust in me to them. Some conversations were going on to get me in the auction from other franchises. My answer was that I always wanted to play for SRH, but it was not an easy no to say to everyone.“When I play for the team, whenever someone comes to talk to me in Telugu, they take me as kind of their own brother. Like, someone known to them is playing for their home team. Obviously, Orange Army, that thing is huge and they support really well. The number of people who come and support us in the stadium, it's massive. When those orange flags came in the Orange stadium, we really love that energy,” he concluded.",India all-rounder Nitish Kumar Reddy shared how a light-hearted dressing room banter with Virat Kohli led to him receiving a special gift from the former India captain.

And at TimesofIndia.com today, we take a deep dive into those defining moments.The IPL couldn’t have asked for a better opening act in its inaugural season. Brendon McCullum, donning the golden-and-black Kolkata Knight Riders jersey, launched the league in style with a jaw-dropping 158 not out off 73 balls at the Chinnaswamy Stadium against Royal Challengers Bengaluru (formerly Royal Challengers Bangalore).RCB were stunned, fans were hooked, and the world sat up and took notice. That innings wasn’t just a knock; it was a statement that IPL had arrived.Led by the ever-calculating Shane Warne, an underdog Rajasthan Royals side stunned everyone by lifting the inaugural IPL trophy. With emerging stars like Yusuf Pathan and Swapnil Asnodkar shining bright, RR’s triumph was the ultimate “moneyball” story.Their win over CSK in the final was a reminder that heart and hustle could beat star power.If McCullum’s knock lit the fuse, Chris Gayle ’s 175 not out off 66 balls against Pune Warriors six years later was a full-blown explosion.Playing for Royal Challengers Bangalore then, Gayle unleashed the most brutal innings in T20 history, smashing 17 sixes in a whirlwind knock that still stands as the highest individual score in IPL. Bowlers watched, fans roared, and Twitter exploded.The darker side of IPL drama unfolded when Harbhajan Singh allegedly slapped Sreesanth post-match, leading to Bhajji’s suspension.While it sparked headlines and debates, it also showcased how high tensions could run in this high-stakes league. It was raw, controversial, and undeniably part of IPL’s wild early DNA.In a high-octane final between two modern IPL giants in season 8, Mumbai Indians scripted a dramatic turnaround after a poor start to the season.Under Rohit Sharma’s cool leadership, MI thumped CSK in the final to win their second IPL title. More than the result, it was the narrative arc — from bottom-dwellers to champions — that made this season unforgettable.Some moments are just too good to leave out. Virat Kohli’s record-shattering 973-run season in 2016 wasn’t just dominance. It was a batting masterclass that may never be matched. Kieron Pollard’s gravity-defying one-handed catch in 2014 reminded fans that in the IPL, even the laws of physics take a backseat.And who could forget Adam Gilchrist’s delightful cameo in 2013. donning the keeper’s gloves and rolling his arm over for a rare bowling spell in what turned out to be his farewell match. These moments may not have cracked the top five of the first part, but they’ve carved out a special place in IPL folklore.","The IPL has been a goldmine of drama, thrills, and unforgettable moments.

Indian pacer Mohammed Siraj emerged as a fan favourite at Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) after joining the franchise in 2018, developing a strong bond with Virat Kohli . While Siraj faced his fair share of challenges early on, he made a strong comeback under Kohli's guidance. However, Siraj's seven-year stint at RCB recently came to an end after he was signed by Gujarat Titans (GT) for Rs 12.25 crore in the IPL 2025 player auction.""I felt emotional after leaving RCB. Virat bhai has played a major role in my career. He backed and supported me a lot when I was in a tough situation in 2018-19, choosing to retain me. After that, my performances improved, and my career graph went up. GT will face RCB on April 2, and I am looking forward to it,"" Siraj said in a pre-season press conference. The Indian pacer picked up 83 wickets in 87 matches for RCB, finishing as the franchise's third-highest wicket-taker.Siraj was also asked about his opinion on the Impact Player rule in the IPL, which has received mixed reactions from the cricketing fraternity. ""As a bowler, I feel the rule is unfair. Earlier, taking an early wicket or two used to shift the momentum in favor of the bowling side. Now, even after an early breakthrough, batters continue to hit fours and sixes. The wickets are flat, and the dew factor also comes into play, making it very difficult for bowlers,"" he stated.The GT pacer was recently in the spotlight after Team India captain Rohit Sharma pointed out his reduced effectiveness as the ball older. Siraj was also left out of India's squad for the Champions Trophy 2025 .""I have taken the most wickets with the old ball in the past year among the world's ten fastest bowlers. My economy rate is also low. The numbers speak for themselves—I have performed well with both the new and old ball,"" he said.","Mohammed Siraj joined Gujarat Titans in the IPL 2025 player auction.

SALIVA BAN LIFTED

IPL: How will GT, LSG, DC, PBKS, RR fare? Greenstone Lobo predicts

NEW DELHI: The Indian Premier League (IPL) has introduced several new rules over the years, including strategic timeouts and the Impact Player rule. Now, the tournament is set to implement another innovation in IPL 2025 – the ‘Second Ball’ rule.The ‘Second Ball’ rule has been introduced to counter the impact of dew in night matches. Dew makes it difficult for bowlers to grip the ball, giving batters a significant advantage, especially during run chases. To address this issue, the IPL has introduced a provision allowing the use of a second ball in night games.Under this rule, on-field umpires will assess the condition of the ball after the 11th over of the second innings. If excessive dew is detected, the bowling team will be permitted to use a new ball.This rule aims to provide bowlers with a fairer playing field in dewy conditions.The ‘Second Ball’ rule will not be applicable in afternoon matches.The BCCI also lifted the ban on use of saliva on the ball in the upcoming Indian Premier League after a majority of captains agreed to its proposal, making it the first major cricket competition to do away with the restriction that was a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic.The decision was taken at the captains' meeting in Mumbai ahead of the league starting on Saturday.""The saliva ban has been lifted. Majority of captains were in favour of the move. Some had reservations about the re-introduction, some sat on the fence but majority of them supported the move,"" a top BCCI official told PTI.The International Cricket Council (ICC) had banned the age-old practice of applying saliva to shine the ball as a precautionary measure during the COVID-19 pandemic, during which health practitioners advocated strict hygiene protocols and physical distancing.In 2022, the world body made the ban permanent.The IPL too included the ICC ban in its playing conditions in the aftermath of the pandemic but its guidelines are outside the purview of the sport's governing body.With the development on Thursday, the IPL became the first major cricketing event to re-introduce saliva's use after the pandemic.","The Indian Premier League (IPL) has introduced several new rules over the years, including strategic timeouts and the Impact Player rule.

SHILLONG: Sunil Chhetri justified being coaxed out of his international retirement by a beleaguered India coach Manolo Marquez with a performance on his return to the national fold, which seemed like he had never left at all. That, and a fine glancing header for his 95th career goal helped give India its first international win in over a year — after 489 days — a 3-0 scoreline against Maldives here on Wednesday.Chhetri who started the game and stayed in the thick of things till he was substituted in the 82nd minute, helped himself to a goal in the 76th. Before that, Rahul Bheke (34) and Liston Colaco (66) had done enough to put the issue beyond Maldives’s reach.Marquez got his first win as India head coach and India got their first victory after over a year. They were winless in their last five international games with two of those being losses.For the first half hour, however, both sides looked to be playing a friendly game without fire as the play lacked any quality moves at both ends of the pitch. Once Bheke scored the opener with a header from Brandon Fernandes corner from left, the complexion of the match changed for the better for the home side.Despite the pre-game craze, the official attendance for India’s first ever international game in Shillong was a modest 6,798. On the lukewarm response, the Meghalaya Football Association (MFA) said it being a weekday as well as a friendly could be they reason for low turnout.They were optimistic it would be a full house when Bangladesh come calling Tuesday. Still, there was enough support for Chhetri, the crowd screaming his name, and he didn’t disappoint.The first half ended with India keeping their nose ahead with the sole lead. Five minutes after the change of ends, India found themselves with a brilliant chance to double their lead, only to be denied off the goalline by the Maldives defence.In the 66th minute, Maldives goalkeeper Hussain Shareef forced an excellent save with his leg, but the resultant corner produced the goal India were looking for. This time Naorem Mahesh Singh curled his corner from left towards the second post where an unmarked Colaco rose to the occasion to double the advantage and broke into a Cristiano Ronaldo-like celebration near the corner flag.But the stand erupted in joy only when Chhetri brought in his 95th strike towards the end on his international return as he flicked a header following Colaco’s assist.Maldives barely entered the Indian territory throughout the match.",India beat Maldives 3-0 in their first international game in over a year.

NEW DELHI: Sunil Chhetri made a remarkable comeback to the national team after retiring from international football in May last year. In a friendly match against Maldives on Wednesday, Chhetri's presence proved to be the catalyst for India's commanding 3-0 victory, helping the team snap their 12-match winless streak that had persisted since November 2023.The match unfolded with Rahul Bheke giving India the lead in the 35th minute, followed by Liston Colaco extending the advantage to 2-0 in the 66th minute.The 40-year-old Chhetri, who had returned to the national team, etched his name in the scoresheet with a glancing header in the 77th minute, marking his 95th international goal .Chhetri's impact was evident as he narrowly missed a scoring opportunity in the 47th minute, denied by the Maldives goalkeeper. He was eventually substituted in the 82nd minute, having made a memorable contribution to the team's victory.This triumph held significance as it marked India's first win in 16 months and the first under the guidance of Manolo Marquez , who was appointed as the head coach in July last year. India's previous victory came against Kuwait (1-0) in their 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifying round match in Kuwait City on November 16, 2023.The friendly match served as a dress rehearsal for India's crucial AFC Asian Cup qualifier against Bangladesh, scheduled for March 25 at the same venue. Chhetri's return to the national team was specifically aimed at aiding the team's successful navigation through the qualifiers.With Maldives ranked 162nd in the world, 36 places below India (126th), the match provided an opportunity for the Indian team to regain their winning momentum and prepare for the upcoming challenges in the AFC Asian Cup qualifiers .",India beat Maldives 3-0 in a friendly match on Wednesday.

SHILLONG: India’s friendly international against Maldives here has gathered more firsts than it promised. When the schedule for India’s matches in this FIFA international window was announced, Wednesday’s friendly was marked as the first time that the senior national team will play in Meghalaya’s capital, ahead of their more important 2027 AFC Asian Cup Qualifier against Bangladesh next week.More than the match being the first of its kind in Shillong, however, is Sunil Chhetri ’s comeback in national colours. As the 40-year-old is ready to play his 152th international game, after being coaxed out of retirement by the India head coach Manolo Marquez earlier this month, all focus and talk around the game has been around Chhetri.On Tuesday, Marquez confirmed that India’s all-time leading scorer, who has been training with the team here since Saturday, will have a part to play against Maldives.“For sure, he will play some minutes. I don’t know whether as a starter or from the bench. We can use six substitutions, so 17 players can play, Sunil will be one of them,” said Marquez. “Sunil is the Indian player with the most goals this season. It doesn’t matter if a player is 20, 40, or my grandfather at 87. If they are in better shape, they will be here,” the Spaniard asserted.“The national team is not about developing players. Developed players have to arrive here. The main team needs to win games. And if we need to win games, we need to call players who are in better shape.”With his first competitive game since becoming India coach in July last year just a week away, Marquez is banking on the Maldives friendly as an opportunity to take stock and assess his combination before the March 25 Asian Cup qualifier.“It’s a friendly game to prepare for the Asian Cup qualifier. We knew that the target during the previous FIFA windows was to arrive in the best possible condition against Bangladesh next Tuesday. I don’t think we will play with the same team against Bangladesh that will play tomorrow. Obviously, you can’t change all 11. Some will repeat. It has to be a good game and a good preparation for Bangladesh,” said the coach.Maldives, who had reportedly requested to shift this match out of Shillong due to logistical issues earlier, will be using the friendly to prepare for their Asian Cup qualifier against Philippines next Tuesday.",India face Maldives in a friendly international in Shillong on Wednesday.

Argentina’s footballing maestro Lionel Messi will not feature in the national team’s upcoming World Cup qualifying matches against Uruguay and Brazil, as announced by coach Lionel Scaloni on Monday. The 37-year-old was absent from the 25-man squad, raising questions among fans and media alike.Despite speculation, the Argentine Football Association (AFA) did not provide an official reason for Messi’s exclusion. However, Argentine media reports suggest that the star forward suffered a sore left thigh during Inter Miami ’s 2-1 victory over Atlanta United in Major League Soccer (MLS) on Sunday. Messi played the full 90 minutes, scoring the opening goal in his return to the starting lineup after missing three consecutive matches due to ""load management.""Inter Miami manager Javier Mascherano , who has been cautious with Messi’s fitness throughout the MLS season, addressed the issue following the match against Atlanta United.""We tried to take away from the overload Messi had, so that it wouldn't go further than that. We tried to handle it in the best way. Luckily, we were able to control it and that it didn't turn into an injury or much more... There's no secret in this,"" Mascherano stated.He further explained that Inter Miami has maintained close communication with Argentina’s medical staff regarding Messi’s condition.""Obviously the Argentinian national team doctors are in contact with the doctors here, and they are the ones who specifically talk about that,"" he added.Messi was initially named in Argentina’s 33-man provisional squad but did not make the final cut, leaving fans disappointed ahead of two crucial qualifiers. Argentina, who currently lead the South American standings with 25 points from 12 matches, will face second-placed Uruguay on Friday before hosting fifth-placed Brazil at the Monumental Stadium in Buenos Aires four days later.The absence of the seven-time Ballon d’Or winner is not the only blow for Argentina, as Paulo Dybala , Gonzalo Montiel, and Giovani Lo Celso are also set to miss the doubleheader.","Lionel Messi will not feature in Argentina's upcoming World Cup qualifying matches against Uruguay and Brazil.

Newcastle stun Liverpool in League Cup final to end 56-year trophy drought,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/newcastle-stun-liverpool-in-league-cup-final-to-end-56-year-trophy-drought/articleshow/119099737.cms,"Newcastle players celebrate after winning the League Cup against Liverpool at Wembley Stadium in London. (AP)

History for Newcastle

Newcastle ended their 56-year trophy drought in stunning style as Dan Burn and Alexander Isak sealed a 2-1 win against Liverpool in the League Cup final on Sunday.Eddie Howe 's side made history at Wembley with a superb display that left the runaway Premier League leaders shell-shocked.Burn put Newcastle ahead late in the first half and Isak's 27th goal in all competitions doubled their lead after the interval.Federico Chiesa got one back in the closing seconds, but Newcastle held on for their first major silverware since the 1969 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup.That success in the predecessor to the Europa League is a relic of a bygone era, but this long-awaited triumph will be forever etched in the memories of the Newcastle fans who turned one half of Wembley into a roiling sea of black and white with their ecstatic celebrations.It was also Newcastle's first major domestic prize dating back 70 years to the 1955 FA Cup.Since the Magpies lifted the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, 30 different English teams had won silverware, while Liverpool had clinched 38 major trophies in that time.But after losing the 2023 League Cup final against Manchester United, Howe's team returned to Wembley and set the record straight at last.""We were well aware of the history and we wanted to do the club proud. We wanted to score, we wanted to perform and we wanted to win,"" Howe said.""We are breaking new ground. I thought we were magnificent today.""Newcastle had endured five relegations to the second tier since their last trophy, with club legends like Alan Shearer, Paul Gascoigne and Malcolm MacDonald failing to win silverware in their time on Tyneside.Aside from a brief period when Kevin Keegan's self-styled ""entertainers"" challenged for the title in the 1990s, Newcastle have endured decades of underachievement and self-inflicted wounds that rendered them a laughing stock for long periods.All that changed in 2021 when a Saudi-backed consortium completed a takeover from unpopular owner Mike Ashley and quickly hired Howe as their manager.Thanks to Howe's astute leadership and the Saudi financial backing, Newcastle have been transformed from relegation candidates to silverware winners.The defeat was another painful blow for Liverpool just days after their Champions League last 16 exit on penalties against Paris Saint-Germain.But despite failing to win their first trophy under boss Arne Slot, Liverpool still sit 12 points clear at the top of the Premier League, within touching distance of a record-equalling 20th English title.""It's a very disappointing result. The game went the way Newcastle wanted it. They deserved to win. We were out-played in their style. They won more aerial duels than us,"" Slot said.Liverpool are 23 points ahead of sixth-placed Newcastle in the league and hadn't lost to them for 17 games dating back to 2015.But Howe's men were in no mood to be cowed by past failuresNewcastle fans unveiled a banner before kick-off urging their team to ""write your name in the history books"".They rose to the challenge in spectacular fashion, snapping into tackles and counter-attacking with purpose, while Liverpool were sluggish and sloppy in possession.Newcastle's desire and drive was clear to see when Joelinton tracked back from midfield to stop Jarell Quansah in his tracks and celebrated with a fist-pumping roar.Despite nearly being caught out by Burn's aerial prowess earlier in the game, Liverpool failed to heed the warning as the towering centre-back put Newcastle ahead in the 45th minute.Bizarrely left unmarked, with only the diminutive Alex Mac Allister anywhere near him, Burn was allowed to rise unchallenged to meet Kieran Tripper's corner as he thumped a powerful header into far corner from 12 yards.Burn's goal -- Newcastle's first in a cup final since 1976 -- capped an incredible week for the journeyman centre-back, who received his first England call-up on Friday.With Liverpool talisman Mohamed Salah completely anonymous, the lethargic Reds had no answer as Isak put Newcastle into dreamland after 52 minutes.Newcastle dominated in the air again as Jacob Murphy met Tino Livramento's cross with a header that found Isak, who drilled a superb first-time finish past Caoimhin Kelleher from 10 yards.Chiesa's stoppage-time strike set up an anxious finale, but good things comes to those who wait.And all across Wembley, Newcastle players and fans celebrated with abandon as a party over half a century in the making got into full swing.",Newcastle beat Liverpool 2-1 in the League Cup final at Wembley Stadium.

Barcelona secured a dramatic 4-2 victory against Atletico Madrid after coming back from a two-goal deficit in Sunday's crucial Spanish league match .Lamine Yamal and Ferran Torres scored in stoppage time, helping Barcelona reclaim the top spot in the standings after Real Madrid had temporarily moved ahead following their win against Villarreal on Saturday.Barcelona and Real Madrid are now level on 60 points, with Barcelona holding a game in hand. Atletico Madrid sits four points behind the leaders following their home defeat against Hansi Flick's team, completing a disappointing week after their Champions League exit.""How we play, the confidence we have, it's really good to see. We will try everything to win trophies, the match today gives us more confidence,"" said Flick.Barcelona, who had previously suffered late setbacks against Atletico this season, turned the tables this time, extending their unbeaten run to 18 matches across all competitions.The match saw Julian Alvarez and Alexander Sorloth put Atletico ahead before Robert Lewandowski and Torres equalised for Barcelona, who ultimately secured victory in added time.""I think that after the anger, the feeling of impotence, not being comfortable in the game, we put our best foot forward and gave the best that we have. It was a very important game to win in the end, beating Atletico was a statement win, we put ourselves back as leaders having played a game fewer and we're very happy,"" Yamal told DAZN.Flick had earlier cautioned his players about maintaining focus, following a December incident where they conceded a 96th-minute goal to Atletico, losing their league lead in a 2-1 home defeat.Barcelona's first significant opportunity came near halftime when Pedri set up Lewandowski, whose powerful shot hit the crossbar.Atletico immediately capitalised on the subsequent goal kick, with Antoine Griezmann providing a brilliant pass to Giuliano Simeone, leading to Alvarez's opener.The goal provided some consolation for Alvarez, who had experienced disappointment earlier in the week when his penalty against Real Madrid was controversially disallowed during their Champions League elimination.Diego Simeone refreshed his team with substitutes following their Champions League exit, bringing on Sorloth and Conor Gallagher, who combined for Atletico's second goal.Griezmann played a crucial role in another well-executed team move, with Gallagher assisting Sorloth for his 11th league goal of the season.Barcelona quickly responded despite their protests about a Rodrigo De Paul handball being dismissed. Martinez launched an attack and found Lewandowski, who controlled well and scored.Torres then equalised after receiving a cross from Raphinha, before Yamal's deflected long-range effort put Barcelona ahead in stoppage time.""We have to congratulate our opponent, they had a good game and in the end were very effective with their chances. They had that bit of luck which you have to have, in the deflection for Yamal's goal for 3-2,"" said Simeone.Torres sealed the victory with his second goal in the closing moments.""It was a strange game because we did well in the first half, we had them under control and scored two goals... it's true the 120 minutes in the Champions League weighed on us, and in the end the team fell apart. We will fight to the end (for La Liga ), we have seen many times how things change, you have a good month and someone else has a bad one, and you turn it all around,"" said Atletico's Llorente.",Barcelona come from two goals down to beat Atletico Madrid 4-2 in La Liga.

Miami:

Australian Nick Kyrgios won his first match since 2022 as he fought back from a set down to beat American Mackenzie McDonald 3-6, 6-3, 6-4 at the Miami Open on Wednesday.Kyrgios's career has been blighted by injuries in the last two years and he had to retire from his first round match at Indian Wells earlier this month.The flamboyant 29-year-old had suffered pain in his surgically reconstructed right wrist - a procedure that left him on the sidelines for 18 months.""It has been a long journey, even to just get to the start line of matches and be scared to just finish them,"" Kyrgios said.""To come off and get a win and feel like I belong again was special,"" added after the one-hour, 43-minute victory.Kyrgios, the 2022 Wimbledon finalist, has been plagued by injuries in his career but it was the wrist which caused him the most serious issues and he said he was deeply pessimistic about his chances of a comeback.""I never thought I would play tennis again to be brutally honest with you. I was having conversations with my camp and my team, and I said 'I don't know how long I can keep doing this for',"" he said.""This (win) puts some petrol in the tank but I need to be realistic and see how my wrist feels tomorrow because it is a grind out here,"" he added.There was a first round win for 38-year-old Frenchman Gael Monfils who became the second oldest man, after Jimmy Connors, to win at the Miami Open.Monfils beat last year's quarter-finalist, Hungary's Fabian Marozsan, 6-3, 3-6, 6-4.In the women's draw, Emma Raducanu claimed her first win, defeating 19-year-old wild card Sayaka Ishii of Japan 6-2, 6-1 in just 65 minutes.The 2021 US Open champion will face eighth-seeded American Emma Navarro in the second round, her first meeting with a top 10 player since losing to Iga Swiatek in the Australian Open third round.""It's going to be an extremely challenging match,"" Raducanu said in her on-court interview.

I felt like I was in control. I knew what I needed to do. I just went for it and played to win.""In his first Masters 1000 final, Draper established control early, taking a 4-0 lead.

The set concluded with Draper's ace, followed by Rune's backhand error.""I think today was very clear that I didn't play well enough. He was serving amazing, for sure.

BENGALURU: The first two months of the 2025 tennis season has been all uphill for Sumit Nagal , starting in Melbourne in January and then on clay in Rosario and Buenos Aires, laid low by a flu.The 27-year-old will make a return to tournament play in the ATP Challenger in Murcia next week after staying away from the Tour for about a month.Nagal, whose ranking is down to 132, was thrown a curveball by what he suspects was a bout of Covid-19 in January. The Indian, who chose the rigour of the South American swing over the four-week ATP Challenger series in India in February, was caught unawares in Argentina.“If I knew I was (so) unwell I would never have gone to South America,” Nagal told TOI during a telephone interview. “You’re going so far away, not feeling your best, that makes no sense.”Nagal, who has spent the last few weeks at his training base in Germany, is gradually working his way back.“I never really felt good since Australia, it was maybe Covid-19 over there, I wasn’t sure,” the India No.1 said. “When I was in Argentina I was practicing a bit and then I wasn’t really practicing. It wasn’t a great few weeks for me. I was struggling so much with my health, I was fatigued, I was barely practicing. And when I practiced or played I would feel super tired.”“It has been good in the last two weeks. I have been practicing quite a bit, pushing a bit,” said Nagal, who marked his fitness at eight on a scale of 1 to 10.Nagal, who climbed to a career-high No.68 in the ranking last July, is now chasing a main draw berth at Roland Garros.

Sabalenka trounces Keys in Australian Open re-match

Russian teenager Mirra Andreeva ended the defending champion Iga Swiatek 's quest for a historic third Indian Wells title, defeating the world number two 7-6 (1), 1-6, 6-3 on Friday to advance to the final.At just 17, Andreeva snapped Swiatek's 10-match winning streak at Indian Wells, marking her second victory over the Polish star in three weeks—having previously triumphed in Dubai's quarter-finals en route to becoming the youngest WTA 1000 champion ever.On Sunday, Andreeva will face Aryna Sabalenka , who dominated Australian Open champion Madison Keys . The American veteran Keys had denied Sabalenka a third consecutive title in Melbourne, where she claimed her first major in January.Andreeva is the youngest finalist at Indian Wells since Kim Clijsters, who was 17 in 2001.In the match against Swiatek, Andreeva showcased her skills in the first set tiebreaker and managed to regroup after a challenging second set.Although Swiatek started confidently, dropping only one point in her first three service games, Andreeva seized a 5-4 lead with a crucial break, benefiting from a double fault by Swiatek. The match proceeded to a tiebreaker where Andreeva dominated.""I felt like I'm gonna go and play the tiebreak like it's the last tiebreak of my life,"" she said. ""So I just went for all my shots. My serve was great. I just felt super comfortable and confident,"" she said.""I saw my mom's nervous face in the big screen,"" Andreeva told the crowd. ""I tried not to look there.""Despite Swiatek rebounding in the second set with three breaks, the momentum shifted back to Andreeva in the third. She ultimately secured victory with her third break of the set.""I just decided to kind of still play the same but maybe go for my shots more, trying to play a little bit more aggressive,"" she said.""I feel also that I was dealing with the nerves and the pressure pretty good, so I just feel proud of myself.""World number one Aryna Sabalenka dispatched Madison Keys 6-0, 6-1 to reach the Indian Wells final, avenging her loss to the fifth-ranked American in the Australian Open final.In just 51 minutes, Sabalenka set up a title match against Andreeva.The Belarusian, seeking revenge after her January defeat to Keys, was sharp from the start, completing the first set in just 23 minutes.""I was hungry,"" said Sabalenka, who had made no bones about wanting revenge. ""That Australian Open match was really heartbroken for me, and I really needed some time to recover after that.""And if I would lose today again, it would get in my head and I didn't want that to happen. I was really focused -- I was just really hungry to get this win against Madison.""Keys, who had a 16-match winning streak culminating in her Australian Open victory, struggled to make an impact.""I think tactically I played really great tennis,"" said Sabalenka, adding her strategy was to ""just keep her out of the rhythm"".Despite overcoming the cold, swirling winds on Stadium Court and winning the first 11 games, Sabalenka's dominance was clear. Keys managed to hold serve for the first time at 5-1 in the second set, but Sabalenka quickly closed out the match.This marks Sabalenka's second appearance in the Indian Wells final; she was the runner-up to Elena Rybakina in 2023.","Russian teenager Mirra Andreeva beat defending champion Iga Swiatek 7-6 (1), 1-6, 6-3. At 17, she is the youngest finalist at Indian Wells since Kim Clijsters in 2001. She will face Aryna Sabalenka, who beat Australian Open champion Madison Keys.

Madison Keys powered into the Indian Wells semifinals on Thursday, dismantling wild-card Belinda Bencic 6-1, 6-1 in just 65 minutes to notch her 16th straight victory. The fifth-seeded American, who claimed the Australian Open title earlier this year, now sets up a highly anticipated rematch with world No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka . The two last met at Melbourne Park in January, where Keys defeated Sabalenka in a three-set battle, halting the Belarusian’s bid for a third straight title.Despite upsetting No. 4 seed Coco Gauff in the previous round, Bencic — a 28-year-old from Switzerland — had no answers for Keys’ relentless play.Elsewhere in the women’s draw, defending champion Iga Swiatek continued her dominant run in the California desert, advancing to her fourth straight semifinal at Indian Wells with a 6-3, 6-3 win over eighth-seeded Qinwen Zheng. Swiatek, the No. 2 seed and a five-time Grand Slam winner, is aiming to become the first woman to win the event three times. She’s riding a 10-match win streak at Indian Wells, having also lifted the trophy in 2022.Zheng, who had ended Swiatek’s 25-match winning streak at the Paris Olympics last year, couldn’t replicate that magic. Though she broke Swiatek twice and won six games — equaling the total games Swiatek had lost all tournament — the Polish star converted all five of her break points to seal the match.In the men’s draw, two-time defending champion Carlos Alcaraz fought off determined challenger Francisco Cerundolo 6-3, 7-6 (7/4) to reach the semi-finals.On another cold, blustery night in the California desert, Alcaraz battled back from 1-4 down in the second set, coming up with a break and two love service holds to force the tiebreaker as he kept his bid to join Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic as the only men to win three straight Indian Wells titles on track.Alcaraz had to save break points in each of his first three service games. But after an emphatic hold for 4-3 he gained the first break of the contest with a deft volley and just like that he was serving for the first set.After sliding to pop a drop volley winner over the net for set point Alcaraz drilled a deep forehand that Cerundolo could barely get a racquet on.But it was Cerundolo who broke first in the second, finally converting his ninth break point of the match then holding for 4-1.But he couldn't hold off the world number three, who raced to a 5-2 lead in the tiebreaker on the way to victory.""It was really difficult for me to start the match,"" said Alcaraz, who looked less comfortable in the windy weather than he did just a day before.""He got a lot of chances in the first set,"" Alcaraz said. ""I'm just pleased about saving all of them and taking the only one that I had.""I didn't hit the ball as clear as yesterday, but I just did what I had to and that's what it's about.""Alcaraz next faces Britain's Jack Draper, who reached his first Masters 1000 semi-final with a 6-4, 7-5 victory over American Ben Shelton.Draper took the opening set with one break of serve then rallied from 0-3 down in a second-set slug-fest.Shelton's 32 unforced errors included five double-faults -- including one to hand Draper a break for 6-5 in the second.Russian Daniil Medvedev , runner-up to Alcaraz each of the past two years, rallied from a break down in a wild, wind-blown final set to beat Arthur Fils 6-4, 2-6, 7-6 (9/7).The world number six booked a semi-final meeting with Denmark's Holger Rune , a 5-7, 6-0, 6-3 winner over Tallon Griekspoor.Medvedev, a six-time Grand Slam finalist, trailed 20-year-old Fils 2-4 in the third set of a compelling clash that was momentarily paused as gusting winds sent towels and trash cans flying on Stadium Court.France's Fils had shown admirable maturity in the face of Medvedev's formidable defensive skills.He cut down on the unforced errors that marred his first set to win the second with ease and maintained his poise as he erased an early break in the third to seize the lead.But Medvedev wouldn't be denied and after forcing the tiebreaker prevailed on his third match point when Fils pushed a backhand volley long.Medvedev, who had won just one of his past nine third-set tiebreakers, gave a leap of sheer joy after securing the win in 2 hours and 25 minutes to keep alive his bid for a first title since 2023 -- when he won five.""I lost a lot of tight matches this year where I could have won, should have won maybe,"" Medvedev said. ""I have lost a lot of tight matches where it goes a little bit 50-50 and the more it goes like that, the more you can lose confidence in the tight moments.""I was happy I was able to get over the line as he saved some match points and had a break lead in the third. I am just happy to win.""Medvedev faces another young gun in Rune, who burst onto the scene in 2022 with a win over Novak Djokovic in the Paris Masters final.Rune has struggled often since, but after dropping the first set he dominated Griekspoor, the 43rd-ranked Dutchman who had ousted top-seeded Alexander Zverev in the second round.","Madison Keys crushes wild-card Belinda Bencic 6-1,6-1 in just 65 minutes to notch her 16th straight victory.

NEW DELHI: Mirra Andreeva ’s stunning rise in the WTA rankings has been so rapid that even the 17-year-old Russian admits she can’t quite keep up with it. Just last month in Dubai, she made history as the youngest-ever WTA 1000 champion , defeating both Grand Slam winners Iga Swiatek and Elena Rybakina on her way to the title — a win that catapulted her into the top 10 for the first time, landing at No. 9.Now at Indian Wells , Andreeva entered the tournament ranked 11th, but wins over Rybakina once again in the fourth round and Elina Svitolina in the quarter-finals are expected to lift her back into the top 10. Not that she’s been checking too closely.""Before, I was always checking live rankings because before I was playing for a dog,"" Andreeva said with a smile. ""So after every match I play I would check the live rankings to see if I did it.""That milestone — breaking into the top 20 — came after she defeated Magda Linette in Beijing last October. The reward? A promise of a dog. But even now, the pet hasn’t arrived yet, as she’s still narrowing down her choice.""I'm thinking to get an ultra mini labradoodle ,"" she revealed. ""It's going to be a labrador mixed with poodle and it's ultra min, so going to be even smaller than a mini version. It's going to take time until the dog that I want will be born.""While rankings may not be her primary focus anymore, Andreeva is channeling her energy into what’s right in front of her — like an upcoming semi-final clash at Indian Wells against defending champion Swiatek. Despite her recent win over the Pole in Dubai, she’s not expecting it to give her any advantage.""It doesn't give me any benefit to our match (on Friday),"" she admitted.Tennis has become increasingly serious for the teenager, but she's not letting that take the fun out of the game completely. The young star, who draws inspiration from athletes like Roger Federer and LeBron James, is trying to balance focus with enjoyment.""When I was a bit younger it would all be about having fun,"" Andreeva said. ""But now I start to understand that it's pretty serious what I do out here. I feel like when I have fun on the court I play great tennis, so I still try to not be super, super serious but also to have fun a little bit.""So while a top-10 return and a potential title shot are on the horizon, Andreeva remains grounded — eyes on the next match, and perhaps more importantly, on the tiny dog she’s patiently waiting for.","Mirra Andreeva's rise in the WTA rankings has been so rapid that even the 17-year-old Russian admits she can’t keep up with it.

NEW DELHI: Carlos Alcaraz , the two-time defending champion, showcased his dominance at the ATP Indian Wells Masters on Wednesday. The world number three from Spain overcame the challenging windy conditions on Stadium Court to deliver a commanding performance against Grigor Dimitrov , defeating him 6-1, 6-1.Alcaraz's victory denied Dimitrov's bid to join Canadian Felix Auger-Aliassime as the only players to beat the Spaniard in three consecutive meetings. The Bulgarian had previously won their last two encounters, including the quarter-finals at the Miami Open last year.With his 50th ATP Masters 1000 match win, Alcaraz kept his hopes alive of joining Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic as the only men to win three consecutive Indian Wells titles.Having reached the fourth round without dropping a set, Alcaraz produced his most impressive performance of the tournament. Despite the swirling winds that caused ball kids to scramble after blowing trash, Alcaraz appeared supremely untroubled.He broke Dimitrov's serve to open the match and secured the first set with another break. Alcaraz didn't face a break point until the fifth game of the second set, but he overcame that challenge with an ace on Dimitrov's third break chance. Alcaraz then broke the Bulgarian's serve to take a 5-1 lead.Alcaraz sealed the victory in style, earning a match point with his sixth ace of the match and clinching the win with a forehand winner. He will next face Argentina's Francisco Cerundolo , who defeated Australian Alex de Minaur 7-5, 6-3, for a place in the semi-finals.","Carlos Alcaraz defeated Grigor Dimitrov 6-1, 6- 1 in the fourth round of the ATP Indian Wells Masters.

NEW DELHI: Belinda Bencic produced a stunning comeback to upset world number three Coco Gauff on Wednesday, booking her place in the Indian Wells quarter-finals where she will face Australian Open champion Madison Keys .The Swiss star, who gave birth to her daughter Bella last April, triumphed 3-6, 6-3, 6-4 to reach her first WTA 1000 quarter-final since becoming a mother. Unranked when she returned to the tour in October, Bencic has steadily climbed back, capturing her ninth career title in Abu Dhabi last month and rising to 58th in the world this week.“I just kept on working also on the physical side,” Bencic said. “In the last matches in tournaments, I was able to play back-to-back, some three-set matches, and am fresher every time. The body is holding up much better, almost like it was before.”Bencic showed remarkable poise against Gauff, recovering from a first-set loss and keeping the American under constant pressure. Gauff, who had beaten Bencic at the Australian Open earlier this year, struggled with her forehand and gave away the crucial break with a loose return at 4-4 in the deciding set.Keys also had to fight back in her match, defeating Croatia’s Donna Vekic 4-6, 7-6 (9/7), 6-3. After failing to convert a set point in the second set and trailing 3-5 in the tiebreak, the American dug deep and eventually powered through, breaking twice in the third set to seal victory with a fierce backhand return.In the men’s draw, Ben Shelton downed Brandon Nakashima 7-6 (8/6), 6-1 to reach his third ATP Masters 1000 quarter-final.

A day after dethroning reigning champion Jonatan Christie , Lakshya Sen faltered against Li Shi Feng of China 10-21, 16-21 in the men’s singles quarterfinals of the All England Championships in Birmingham on Friday.Soon after, the Indian challenge ended as the women’s doubles pair of Treesa Jolly and Gayatri Gopichand lost to Chinese second seeds Liu Sheng Shu and Tan Ning 14-21, 10-21.Given his 7-4 win-loss record and having won the last two matches against Li last year, Lakshya was expected to fare well in the quarterfinals. But the Indian was a pale shadow of the shuttler on show against Christie.From 4-4, Li widened the gap. He scored eight points on the trot and Lakshya was out of the first game even before he had warmed up.Emboldened by the easy victory in the first game, Li started on an aggressive note while Lakshya crawled his way back. With good netplay and by pushing the shuttle to the corners with good effect, Lakshya secured a crucial three-point lead (11-8) at the halfway stage. However, Li toned down his aggression and scored the next four points by engaging the Indian in long rallies, mostly close to the net. It was anybody’s game till 15-15.Thereafter, Li came up with two smash winners and a lucky net drop to widen the gap to 19-15.

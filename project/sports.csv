NEW DELHI: Spinner Varun Chakravarthy made a memorable ICC Champions Trophy debut on Sunday, producing a sensational five-wicket haul as India defeated New Zealand by 44 runs in their final group-stage match at Dubai International Cricket Stadium. His performance helped India secure a semi-final clash against Australia after topping Group A with an unbeaten record.Varun returned figures of 5 for 42, marking the best-ever bowling figures by an Indian in his Champions Trophy debut. He surpassed teammate Mohammed Shami’s 5 for 53 against Bangladesh in India’s tournament opener at the same venue. Overall, it was the second-best bowling performance by an Indian in Champions Trophy history, only behind Ravindra Jadeja ’s 5 for 36 against West Indies in the 2013 edition at The Oval.Adding another milestone, Varun became the fastest Indian bowler to claim a five-wicket haul in ODIs, achieving the feat in just his second match. The previous record was held by Stuart Binny, who picked up 6 for 4 against Bangladesh in Mirpur in his third ODI in 2014.The match also made history as the first instance of two five-wicket hauls in a single Champions Trophy game. New Zealand pacer Matt Henry returned identical figures of 5 for 42 during India’s innings, setting the stage for a thrilling contest.After receiving the 'Player of the Match' award, Varun expressed his emotions: ""First of all, I did feel nervous in the initial stages. I have not played many matches for India in the ODI format, but as the game went on, I felt better. Virat, Rohit, Shreyas and Hardik were talking to me, and that helped. (On when he knew he was playing) I found out last night. I was definitely expecting to play for the country, but on the other hand, I was nervous. It was not a rank turner, but if you bowled in the right places, it offered assistance. The way Kuldeep, Jaddu, and Axar bowled, even the pace bowlers, it was a total team effort.""Skipper Rohit Sharma explained the decision to include Varun in the playing XI, stating, ""He has something different about him, so we wanted to try and see what he can offer. We haven’t thought much about the next game yet, but it’s a good headache to have.""With this commanding victory, India now shift focus to the semi-final against Australia, where Varun’s mystery spin could play a key role in India’s title pursuit.","Varun returned figures of 5 for 42, marking the best-ever bowling figures by an Indian in his Champions Trophy debut.

'India will be worried vs New Zealand': Former NZ Cricket CEO David White

NEW DELHI: Indian cricket superstar Virat Kohli is well known for his on-field antics, which often entertain fans just as much as his batting heroics. From urging the crowd to cheer louder to mimicking his teammates, Kohli’s exuberance is always on display.During India’s final group-stage clash against New Zealand in the ongoing ICC Champions Trophy in Dubai, another such moment went viral, leaving fans in splits.In a lighthearted and spontaneous gesture, Kohli playfully touched the feet of spinner Axar Patel after the latter dismissed New Zealand’s top-scorer Kane Williamson . The incident took place at the end of the 41st over of New Zealand’s run chase when Axar provided India with a crucial breakthrough.Williamson, who had scored a well-compiled 81 off 120 balls, attempted an aggressive stroke off Axar’s delivery but was completely beaten, allowing wicketkeeper KL Rahul to complete a simple stumping. As Axar celebrated the prized scalp, Kohli approached him and humorously bowed down to touch his feet in a gesture of respect, acknowledging the vital wicket. Axar, taken aback, attempted to evade the moment, leading to a brief, playful exchange between the two before they resumed their fielding positions.The wicket proved to be a turning point in the match. With Williamson’s dismissal, New Zealand’s chase faltered despite a brief cameo from Mitchell Santner (28 off 31 balls). The rest of the batting lineup failed to withstand India’s spin attack as Varun Chakaravarthy (5/42) and Kuldeep Yadav (2/56) wrapped up the tail efficiently, securing a 44-run victory for India. Axar finished with impressive figures of 1 for 32 in his 10 overs.With this win, India topped Group A and set up a semi-final clash against Australia on Tuesday. However, it was Kohli’s lighthearted gesture that became one of the highlights of the match, once again showcasing his fun-loving and animated presence on the field.",Virat Kohli touched the feet of spinner Axar Patel after the latter dismissed New Zealand’s top-scorer Kane Williamson.

Barcelona secured a dominant 4-0 victory over Real Sociedad on Sunday, reclaiming the top spot in La Liga after a commanding performance at the Spotify Camp Nou. An early red card for Sociedad’s Aritz Elustondo gave Hansi Flick ’s side a significant advantage, allowing Gerard Martin, Marc Casado, Ronald Araujo and Robert Lewandowski to find the net in a comfortable win.Atletico Madrid had temporarily knocked the Catalans off their perch with a win over Athletic Bilbao on Saturday, while Real Madrid lost further ground in the title race with a defeat at Real Betis. Flick made several rotations ahead of Barcelona’s Champions League last-16 trip to Benfica on Wednesday but still managed to move one point ahead of Atletico.Real Sociedad, sitting ninth, started brightly but fell victim to Barcelona’s offside trap, with Sergio Gomez’s goal ruled out early on. Barcelona playmaker Pedri Gonzalez nearly capitalized on a mistake from Sociedad goalkeeper Alex Remiro, but his deflection landed just over the net. The game’s defining moment came in the 17th minute when Elustondo was sent off for pulling down Dani Olmo , who was racing through on goal.Barcelona took advantage quickly, opening the scoring eight minutes later when Olmo floated a cross to Martin, who fired home his first-ever senior goal. Four minutes later, Olmo was involved again—his wayward shot deflecting off Casado and into the net for Barcelona’s second. The young Lamine Yamal continued to impress, setting up Pedri, whose shot from the edge of the box was saved. Pedri came even closer after halftime, rattling the crossbar from distance.Shortly after, Araujo made it 3-0, reacting quickest after Remiro parried Lewandowski’s header from a corner. Lewandowski then wrapped up the scoring with a clever finish, diverting Araujo’s low drive past the goalkeeper. The 36-year-old now leads the La Liga scoring charts with 21 goals in 25 appearances.Barcelona controlled the final 30 minutes without much trouble, though substitute Ferran Torres came close to adding a fifth goal twice. Real Sociedad defender Javi Lopez admitted the red card changed the course of the game.Elsewhere, Valencia salvaged a 3-3 draw at Osasuna, thanks to a stunning backheel volley from Umar Sadiq in the 87th minute. The Nigerian striker scored twice to earn his side a valuable point in the relegation battle. Valencia, now 18th, sit one point above Alaves, who drew 1-1 at Mallorca earlier in the day. In another crucial result, Leganes (16th) edged Getafe 1-0, moving three points clear of the drop zone.Barcelona now shift focus to their Champions League last-16 first leg against Benfica on Wednesday, as they look to continue their pursuit of silverware across all competitions.","Barcelona beat Real Sociedad 4-0 to reclaim top spot in La Liga.

Champions Trophy: Morne Morkel back as Team India practices at ICC Academy in Dubai

The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has stressed that they're taking stricter security protocols at all ICC Champions Trophy 2025 venues following consecutive pitch invasions in Rawalpindi and Lahore.The first security breach happened at the Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium during the Group A match between New Zealand and Bangladesh. A spectator ran onto the field to hug New Zealand batter Rachin Ravindra. Security staff quickly apprehended the intruder, who was subsequently arrested and received a ban from all cricket stadiums.A second incident occurred at the Gaddafi stadium in Lahore when a pitch invader disrupted Afghanistan's victory celebrations upon beating England on Wednesday night. While the festive atmosphere continued, this breach highlighted existing security vulnerabilities.These back-to-back pitch invasions during the marquee tournament have placed significant pressure on the PCB. The board has now committed to enhanced security measures to protect players, officials and spectators for the remainder of the ICC tournament.During the incident involving Ravindra, the individual, reportedly carrying a photograph of Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan leader Saad Rizvi, managed to evade security at the Rawalpindi Cricket Ground, before being apprehended.“The PCB has taken serious note of the security breach that occurred yesterday when a spectator entered the field of play. Ensuring the safety of players and officials remains our top priority. As a responsible organisation, we have engaged with local security agencies, who have committed to increasing security personnel around the field of play at all venues and strengthening access control measures,” PCB said in a statement after the incident.“The individual involved was arrested and presented before a court of law today (Tuesday). In addition, he has been permanently banned from entering all cricket venues in Pakistan,” the statement added.“To prevent such incidents in the future, the PCB is working closely with security agencies and venue authorities to review and reinforce security protocols,” it continued.The security breach has created concerns for the PCB, with Pakistan serving as host nation for a major ICC event for the first time since the 1996 World Cup.","The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has stressed that they're taking stricter security protocols at all ICC Champions Trophy 2025 venues.

Ignored by state two years ago, batter's ton gives Vidarbha 286-run lead

Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel.

Brief scores: Vidarbha 379 & 249/4 (K Nair batting 132, D Malewar 73; A Sarvate 1-55) lead Kerala 342 by 286 runs.

NAGPUR: The Kerala camp will spend a sleepless Saturday night regretting over Karun Nair . Over dropping a catch of the batter on Day Four. Over not responding to his offer a couple of seasons ago. Nair, having hit a purple zone this season, made most of a reprieve to take Vidarbha to a dominating position in the Ranji Trophy final . If Nair has his way on the final day, Kerala will feel the agony on Sunday and much beyond.Having fallen out of Karnataka selectors' favour two seasons ago, Nair wanted to shift to Kerala. The southern state, though, did not respond to Nair's SOS. Eventually, sensing that time was running out, the batter shifted base to Vidarbha. On Saturday, Nair made Kerala pay for both the reprieve and the cold shoulder.Inside three overs on Saturday, Vidarbha were staring down the barrel at seven for two. Nair, along with first innings hero Danish Malewar , began steading the ship.His rescue act was all but derailed in the 19th over by Eden Apple Tom. The medium pacer induced an edge off Nair, batting on 31. Akshay Chandran, standing in the slip cordon, though, suffered a ‘you just dropped the cup, mate' moment. Chandran grassed a regulation catch, and Kerala suffered for most of the day.Enjoying the form of his life, Nair scripted a Vidarbha comeback with an unbeaten knock of 132 (280b;10x4;2x6). Guiding young Malewar (73;162b;5x4), like he has done throughout this season, Nair took Vidarbha to position of strength at 249 for four in 90 overs.The pair stitched together a 182-run third wicket partnership to put Vidarbha in driver's seat -- with an overall lead of 286, and six wickets in hand, Vidarbha would hope to bat Kerala out of the title clash on Sunday.The start of Day Four saw Vidarbha reeling from early double blows by offie Jalaj Saxena and pacer MD Nidheesh. Playing their first Ranji final, Kerala pushed Vidarbha into a corner but failed to deliver the knockout punch.The lack of big stage experience showed. Apart from the dropped catch, Kerala also shied from placing an attacking field after having the rivals down and almost out. With no one placed in the slip area, two edges induced by Saxena went abegging, and Nair and Malewar made most of Kerala's shortcomings.The Nair-Malewar pair has so far produced 700-plus runs together for Vidarbha.In the first innings, Nair had missed out on a century through a run out. He made amends on Saturday. “I was very disappointed to get run out in the first innings. I felt I had missed out. So, I was determined to make it count today but batting in second innings is never easy with the wicket deteriorating,” Nair said after posting his ninth century of this domestic season.",Karun Nair scores 132 as Vidarbha take 286-run lead in Ranji Trophy final.

Can India overcome New Zealand in the ICC Champions Trophy?

Champions Trophy: Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli sweat it out in training session

South Africa 's poor record in the knockout rounds of the International Cricket Council (ICC) tournaments will once again be at the back of their minds as they entered the semifinals of the Champions Trophy on Saturday.South Africa hammered England by seven wickets in Karachi to finish on top of Group B and now wait to know whether they face India or New Zealand, who meet on Sunday to decide number one and two in Group A, in the semis.Australia finished second with four points to book the other last-four spot from Group B.Pacer Marco Jansen played a key role with the ball for SA on Saturday, taking 3 for 39 besides pouching three catches as they bowled out England for just 179.Rassie van der Dussen's 72 and Heinrich Klaasen's 64 led South Africa's chase, which they completed in just 29.1 overs.Jansen was named 'Man of the Match' for his effort and believes that his team can maintain the focus and winning momentum in the semifinals despite its poor record in knockout games.""I wouldn't say the mindset changes; it's just the occasion that's probably a bit more hyped up I guess,"" said Jansen.""You try your processes. It's a fancy term, but for me it's just (that) you have your steps or your guides that you go into every match (with) and then basically in the semifinals you just try and do that extraordinarily well.""South Africa's only success in an ICC tournament came way back in 1998 when they won the ICC Knockout Tournament. Talking about their recent slip-ups in ICC events, they lost to Australia in the 2023 ODI World Cup semis and then lost to India in last year's T20 World Cup final.Despite this history, Jansen believes South Africa don’t need to make significant changes for the knockout stage.""For me, it's just depending on where you play, on what lengths to hit and then as the game develops, try and figure out what works and what doesn't work,"" Jansen said.Talking about the possibility of facing India, who play all their matches in Dubai as part of a hybrid arrangement, Jansen noted that India will have the advantage of familiarity with the conditions by playing the entire tournament at the same stadium.""If we play in Dubai and it's against India, obviously they've had training and that kind of stuff, so they will be more used to the conditions. But we've also played in Dubai, so it's not something new. We play spin really, really well. So I don't think it's that much or that too much of an advantage,"" the pace reckoned.""I just think it all comes down to, on the day who plays better.""",South Africa beat England by seven wickets to finish top of Group B.

BENGALURU: Delhi Capitals became the first team to qualify for the WPL playoffs this year after they hammered home team Royal Challengers Bengaluru by nine wickets here on Saturday.Chasing 148, opener Shafali Verma and Jess Jonassen put on 146 runs for the second-wicket partnership as DC romped home with 4.3 overs remaining. Shafali remained unbeaten on 80 off 43 balls while Jonassen hit an unbeaten 61 off 38. Shafali hit four sixes and eight boundaries in her knock.Entering the match on the back of a hat-trick of losses, Ellyse Perry did her best to cheer up the home crowd as RCB managed to post 147/5 .Asked to bat, RCB lost their skipper Smriti Mandhana for eight. But as Ellyse (60 n.o, 3x4, 3x6) walked in, the crowd welcomed her with a raucous roar.The in-form Ellyse and opener Danni Wyatt-Hodge (21, 2x4, 1x6) quickly put behind the early setback as the hosts cruised to 45/1 at the end of powerplay. While the English top-order batter found her first boundary of the evening with a four over midwicket off Marizanne Kapp, Ellyse effortlessly dispatched Shikha in the next over.The pair then took on Jess Jonassen, smashing a couple of sixes in the penultimate over of the powerplay. Ellyse’s lofted straight shot saw the Australian become the leading run-scorer in the tournament’s history. But a strategic timeout by DC at the end of the seventh over, broke the rhythm as Marizanne Kapp once again handed Capitals the breakthrough with the well-set Wyatt-Hodge nicking it to ‘keeper Sarah Bryce.Sree Charani picked up two quick wickets in the 17th over.

Can India overcome New Zealand in the ICC Champions Trophy?

DUBAI: It could be a coincidence, but something that cannot be overlooked. Could New Zealand actually be doing well in ICC tournaments because they have a smaller pool of players to choose from? Batter Glenn Phillips , for one, seems to think so.""We are fortunate in New Zealand, where we do have a lot fewer players than India has to choose from, which means we can afford to give guys slightly longer runs before moving to potentially the next group of players.""And that does, obviously, give a lot of confidence. The intense competition is slightly different from what maybe the competition in India is from a pure numbers perspective,"" Phillips said.Phillips explained that in New Zealand, players prioritize playing for the team rather than for individual places. ""We've got guys waiting in the wings that are definitely ready to be here and to perform. So for us, we try not to think about that because we're all in it together.""There's a wider squad that is all involved, we're all New Zealand cricket as a whole in this team environment. That culture allows us to go out there and play for each other, as opposed to playing for ourselves individually for other spots, which I do think gives us a little bit of an advantage, say, over India who, you know, if you don't perform one day, you very well may not play the next two or three years,"" Phillips said.Since the time they've landed here, the Black Caps have sought to play down the controversy surrounding India getting to play all their Champions Trophy matches in Dubai. Phillips asserted that the Kiwis have a ""no-excuse mindset."" ""For us, there's no focus on anything like that. Obviously, the tournament draw is what it is. We have a no-excuses mindset to be able to come out to a tournament. You've dealt the hand that you've dealt, and India has been dealt a hand. We're never going to complain about what we get,"" he said.Phillips gave the Champions Trophy one of its best moments when he flew to his left at backward point to pouch a blinder to dismiss Pakistan captain Mohammad Rizwan.

NEW DELHI: A visibly dejected Jos Buttler was at a loss for words after his team collapsed to a seven-wicket defeat against South Africa on Saturday. Describing their underwhelming batting as ""the story of our side,"" Buttler's remarks underscored England’s winless exit from the Champions Trophy The match marked a disappointing end to his ODI captaincy, with England bowing out at 179 all out—the lowest total of this edition—after he chose to bat. South Africa comfortably chased down the target in just 29.1 overs.""A really disappointing performance. We were so far short of the mark there today. It was a decent surface - pretty slow but a bit two-paced. We're not going on and making those big, telling contributions which has been a story of this side for some time now with the bat,"" Buttler said at the post-match press conference.Asked about the lack of form of his batters, Buttler replied, ""I don't know, to be honest. As a whole group, we're not getting the results and that takes away some confidence. Time for everyone to go away, have a change of scene, work hard.""There's now a huge opportunity for everyone in the dressing room and those outside to put their hand up and say they want to be part of these white-ball teams,"" said Buttler who has already announced that Saturday's match will be his last as white-ball captain.""There's no doubt that the talent is there.

To be a World Cup-winning captain is an incredibly proud moment. That was the best day in a captaincy shirt.""Praising former skipper Joe Root , Buttler added: ""Joe's been a shining light and a great example for English cricket throughout.

Champions Trophy: How good is Virat Kohli in football? | Rishabh Pant recovers from viral

Fresh from his match-winning century against Pakistan in the Champions Trophy Virat Kohli is set to reach another milestone when India face New Zealand in their concluding Group A fixture in Dubai on Sunday.The match will be Kohli's 300th ODI, making him only the 22nd player and seventh Indian to reach that many caps in 50-over internationals. Sachin Tendulkar's 463 career ODIs lead that list.With both India and New Zealand already through to the semifinals, the winner of Sunday's game will finish on top of Group A.Kohli, who has already retired from T20Is, scored 100 not out to help India beat Pakistan in their last match. It was the first ODI century for the 36-year-old batting legend since November 2023.""That (300) is a lot of ODI games and a lot of international games and he's been... I mean words fall short to express how good a player he's been and what a great servant of Indian cricket he's been,"" KL Rahul said while talking to reporters in Dubai on Friday.""Really happy to see that he got the hundred (in the) last game and he's been batting really well. For a player of his calibre, it was about time that he scores that big century and a match-winning century,"" he added.""Virat and Rohit (Sharma), they are the senior players and you are always looking up to them to step up and score when the big games come. Hopefully there's many more hundreds left for him (Kohli) and many more games of international cricket.""During his century against Pakistan, the 51st of his ODI career, Kohli also crossed 14,000 ODI runs to join Sachin Tendulkar and Kumar Sangakkara as only the third batter to accomplish the feat.Talking about Kohli's 300th ODI appearance, New Zealand all-rounder Michael Bracewell said: ""I think that's obviously a massive achievement. Three hundred games across a career is very impressive and then to put that in just one format is amazing. I think it's a testament to the way that he's gone about his career.""Bracewell played with Kohli at Royal Challengers Bengaluru in the Indian Premier League and said he was looking forward to facing him on Sunday.""I saw it first hand at Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB), how he sort of prepared for each match and it's very impressive,"" said Bracewell, who has played with Kohli in the Indian Premier League.","Virat Kohli will play his 300th ODI against New Zealand on Sunday.

'Superman' Phillips gatecrashes King Kohli's party,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/icc-champions-trophy-2025/superman-phillips-gatecrashes-king-kohlis-party/articleshow/118672567.cms,"DUBAI: The stage was all decked up for him. Playing in his landmark 300th ODI, Virat Kohli , India's biggest batting superstar since the iconic Sachin Tendulkar , walked into thunderous cheers on Sunday afternoon at the Dubai International Stadium after India lost Shubman Gill 's wicket early in the piece, during their final league match of the 2025 ICC Champions Trophy against New Zealand.In the stands on his special occasion was his wife, actor Anushka Sharma , who had flown down from Mumbai, hoping that 'King Kohli' would make the occasion memorable.Considering that he was just fresh off scoring a magnificent, unbeaten hundred against arch-rivals Pakistan at the same venue a week back, the expectation was justified. However, the 15,000-odd fans at the stadium here (including Anushka), and the millions watching on TV were left thoroughly disappointed when Kohli, after scoring 11 off 14 balls which included two fours, cut a ball from pacer Matt Henry around the off-stump area, in the seventh over, only to be caught brilliantly by Glenn Phillips , who flew as if he was a bird, to his right, to grab the ball at backward point.Phillips' Superman-esque act left Kohli stunned, as he stood at his crease for a few moments before trudging back to the pavilion, shaking his head in disappointment. The crowd, of course, was silenced for a while. Kohli's party had been gatecrashed by Phillips.Social media, however, was soon abuzz with reactions to the catch: ""The Superman of the tournament"", wrote one fan on X.This isn't the first blinder that Phillips has pouched in the 2025 ICC Champions Trophy. The 28-year-old gave the tournament, which has mostly witnessed some dull crocket, one of its best moments when he flew to his left at backward point to pouch a blinder to dismiss Pakistan captain Mohamad Rizwan off Will O'Rourke ion the tournament's first match at Karachi.In the press conference before the Black Caps' match against India, Phillips was asked in jest if he was using a glue stick to take those amazing catches. The man from Auckland put it down to luck and his hard work. ""I wish I could say that I've got a special little glue tag that I use, but unfortunately, that's not the case. If anything, my palms are sweatier than anything else. It comes down to a lot of hard work and doing the basics as much as I can and then sometimes luck just plays a good part in it.""",Virat Kohli was playing his 300th ODI when he was caught by New Zealand's Glenn Phillips. Kohli had just scored an unbeaten hundred against arch-rivals Pakistan a week earlier. The 28-year-old also caught Mohamad Rizwan off Will O'Rourke ion the tournament's first match at Karachi.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118672550,imgsize-46740,width-400,resizemode-4/118672550.jpg"
Champions Trophy: Kiwis polished off with spin,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/icc-champions-trophy-2025/champions-trophy-kiwis-polished-off-with-spin/articleshow/118672422.cms,"Varun leads tweakers' super show with 5-42 after Shreyas's solid 79 helps India to 249; Rohit & Co. Win by 44 runs, face Australia in Tuesday's semifinal

DUBAI: Since the time he made a dream India comeback on Oct 6 at Gwalior, taking three for 31 to shape his team's seven-wicket win over Bangladesh in the first T20I, 'mystery spinner' Varun Chakravarthy has been living a fairytale that no one would've imagined for him.On Sunday night, the 33-year-old, playing just the second ODI of his career, spun a web around the New Zealand batting line-up, taking five for 42 in 10 overs to play a stellar role in his team's 44-run win in the final group match of the 2025 ICC Champions Trophy . The irony is that Varun's match-winning haul came at the Dubai International Stadium- the same venue where, after going wicketless for three matches in the T20 World Cup in 2021, he was dropped from the Indian team for the next three years.Pulling off a tactical masterstroke, India unleashed as many as four spinners on a turning track, replacing pacer Harshit Rana with Varun. While Varun did the maximum damage, India's other spinners Kuldeep Yadav (2-56 in 9.3 overs), Axar Patel (1-32 in 10 overs) and Ravindra Jadeja (1-36 in eight overs) too revelled on a pitch which aided a fair bit of turn and bounce.Finishing on top of Group A after winning all their three matches, India will thus square off against Australia at Dubai, hoping to avenge their defeat in the 2023 ODI World Cup final to the world champions, in the first semifinal on Tuesday, while the Kiwis will take on South Africa in the second semis clash at Lahore on Wednesday.Appearing unplayable from his first over (10th of the innings) as his deliveries hissed around viciously, Varun wreaked havoc amongst the Kiwis as he took the wickets of Will Young (22, bowled by a googly that took the batter's inside edge), Glenn Phillips (12, trapped lbw off a googly), Michael Bracewell (2, struck by a googly outside off-stump, but didn't review, ball would've missed off-stump), Mitchell Santner (28 castled by a faster one) and Matt Henry (2, caught by Virat Kohli at long-off).Having forced his way into India's Champions Trophy team after picking 14 wickets in the five-match T20I series against England at home, Varun showed he can be a deadly spinner to face in the ODI format too, making a smashing Champions Trophy debut. The Tamil Nadu & Kolkata Knight Riders tweaker is now just the third Indian bowler to pick up a fiver in the tournament.Varun and India's other three spinners helped their team stave off a Kane Williamson masterclass on a spiteful pitch- a sublime 81 (120b, 7x4), as the Kiwis folded up for 205 in 45.3 overs, suffering their first defeat in the 2025 Champions Trophy, losing their last three wickets for just 10 runs in seven balls.India got the perfect start when opener Rachin Ravindra (6) was caught brilliantly by a diving Axar Patel at third man off Hardik Pandya . Daryl Mitchell (17), who had slammed back-to-back hundreds against India in the 2023 ODI World Cup against India, fell lbw to Kuldeep Yadav in the 26th over. Tom Latham was trapped in front of the stumps while trying to reverse sweep Ravindra Jadeja in the 33rd over.Earlier, continuing to prove his worth, Shreyas Iyer produced a composed half-century (79, 98b, 4x4, 2x6) under pressure but New Zealand, inspired by pacer Mark Henry 's fiver (five for 42 in eight overs) and some terrific fielding, managed to restrict India to 249 for nine.Asked to bat first by the Black Caps, India's top-order suffered a rare failure, as the 2023 ODI World Cup finalists collapsed to 30 for three in the seventh over, before Iyer put the innings back on track, sharing a 98-run alliance off 136 balls with Axar Patel (42, 61b, 3x4, 1x6) for the fourth wicket. Towards the end of India's innings, Hardik Pandya (45, 45b, 4x4, 2x6) churned out a quick-fire innings to take the score to a respectable level.While Henry bowled his heart out, the Black Caps set the stage on fire with their electric fielding, as Glenn Phillips took a blinder to catch Virat Kohli (11), playing in his 300th ODI, at backward point off Henry, and former captain Kane Williamson pouched another stunner at the same position to dismiss Ravindra Jadeja (16) off Henry.Coming off scores of 59, 44 & 78 (against England in the home ODI series), and 15 & 56 in the Champions Trophy, the in-form Iyer, normally an aggressive batter, was restrained as he looked to do the rebuild job in the company of Axar.Iyer's best shot was a lofted six over long on off pacer Will O'Rourke for the 35th over. India could've finished with a much lower total but for Hardik's lusty blows, which left the Black Caps with a 250-run chase.Earlier, India were in dire straits as skipper Rohit Sharma (15), Shubman Gill (2) and Kohli were out cheaply. After starting off in his usual cavalier fashion, pulling pacer Mark Henry for a four and six, Rohit perished to the pull shot, as he skied the ball off Kyle Jamieson to Young at square leg.Henry took the first of his five wickets when he trapped Gill, trying to place across, plumb in front. The 33-year-old Henry owed it to Phillips for getting Kohli's wicket as the Kiwi pulled off a sensational grab out of thin air after the batter had unleashed a rasping square cut.",India beat New Zealand by 44 runs in final group match of 2025 ICC Champions Trophy. Varun Chakravarthy took five for 42 in 10 overs to help India to 249-9.

Champions Trophy: Rohit Sharma back to his belligerent best in final training session

NEW DELHI: New Zealand captain Mitchell Santner admitted that the pitch in their final ICC Champions Trophy group stage match against India was slower than what they had encountered in the Pakistan leg of the tournament. He credited India’s bowlers for expertly controlling the middle overs, which ultimately led to his side’s 44-run defeat.Despite a resilient knock from Kane Williamson , New Zealand found themselves trapped in a spin web woven by Varun Chakravarthy , Axar Patel , and Ravindra Jadeja . With this victory, India finished the group stage unbeaten, securing three wins in three matches. They will now face Australia in the semifinal on March 4 in Dubai.Speaking at the post-match presentation, Santner acknowledged India’s superior control in the middle overs.""It was a slower wicket than what we have come against. We knew that going in. India controlled the middle phase better,"" he said.He also praised Shreyas Iyer ’s composed innings and lauded the Indian spinners for applying relentless pressure on New Zealand’s batters.""The key for us was getting wickets in the powerplay, and that was good to see. Our next game is in Lahore (against South Africa), where (Matt) Henry will be massive. On those wickets with some pace and bounce, they have four good pacers, so we will have to see how we play them. We have to wait and see if it is a used or a fresh surface,"" Santner added.After winning the toss, New Zealand opted to bowl first. India’s top order faltered, collapsing to 30/3. However, a crucial 98-run partnership between Shreyas Iyer (79) and Axar Patel (42 off 61 balls) steadied the innings. Further contributions from KL Rahul (23), Hardik Pandya (45), and Ravindra Jadeja (16) helped India post a competitive 249/9 in 50 overs.Matt Henry was the standout bowler for New Zealand, claiming an impressive 5/42 in his eight overs.In response, New Zealand struggled to build momentum in their chase of 250. Williamson played a valiant knock of 81 off 120 balls, but regular wickets derailed the innings.Varun Chakravarthy was the wrecker-in-chief, taking a match-winning 5/42, while Kuldeep Yadav chipped in with 2/56. Axar Patel, Hardik Pandya, and Ravindra Jadeja each claimed a wicket as New Zealand was bowled out for 205 in 45.3 overs.India’s dominant display ensured they finished the group stage on a high, while New Zealand will now shift focus to their crucial semi-final clash against South Africa in Lahore on March 5.","India defeated New Zealand by 44 runs in their Champions Trophy group stage match.

NEW DELHI: India capped off their Group A campaign in the ICC Champions Trophy with a commanding 44-run victory over New Zealand, thanks to Shreyas Iyer ’s composed 79 and Varun Chakaravarthy’s stellar 5/42.The win secured India’s place at the top of the table and set up a highly anticipated semifinal clash with Australia.Despite Iyer’s fighting knock, India struggled early, losing three wickets for just 30 runs. New Zealand pacer Matt Henry produced a lethal spell, finishing with figures of 5/42 and restricting India to a modest 249/9. However, India’s spinners ensured it was enough as they bowled out the Blackcaps for 205 in 45.3 overs.After the match, Chakaravarthy admitted to initial nerves but credited his senior teammates for keeping him calm.""In 2021, I didn’t have a great tournament in Dubai, looks good right now. Team is doing well and it feels good. I was nervous during my first spell, previous outings here were playing on my mind. Virat bhai, Hardik bhai, Rohit bhai helped me keep my calm,"" Chakaravarthy said.He also reflected on how adapting his approach helped his success, adding, ""I try to sequence my spell in T20s and it’s a bit different in 50-over. Playing domestic cricket helped my awareness and allowed me to plan my spells better. It’s more of a patience game as the ball didn’t turn fast, it turned slow. The pitch was not a rank turner.""India’s spin attack was at its best, with Chakaravarthy leading the charge. His precise line and variations troubled New Zealand’s batters throughout their innings. Kane Williamson waged a lone battle with a classy 81 but lacked support as wickets kept tumbling.New Zealand’s chase never gained momentum after Hardik Pandya struck early to dismiss Rachin Ravindra. Williamson built a steady 44-run partnership with Daryl Mitchell, but Kuldeep Yadav broke the stand by trapping Mitchell lbw.

His relentless accuracy and variations dismantled the Blackcaps, bowling them out for 205 in 45.3 overs. Kane Williamson put up a valiant fight with a well-compiled 81, but his efforts were in vain.With this result, India will face Group B runners-up Australia in the first semifinal on Tuesday in Dubai, while New Zealand will take on South Africa in Lahore on Wednesday.India’s spinners continued their tournament-long strategy of effectiveness over extravagance, adjusting their approach to suit the conditions. While Ravindra Jadeja extracted significant turn, it was Chakravarthy’s stump-to-stump line that proved to be the most potent weapon against New Zealand’s batters.Hardik Pandya gave India an early breakthrough, dismissing Rachin Ravindra. From there, India’s spinners took charge.Williamson, who was dropped on 17 by KL Rahul off Axar Patel, played a well-calculated innings built on timing and placement. However, he lacked support from his teammates. His 44-run stand with Daryl Mitchell for the third wicket briefly steadied New Zealand, but Kuldeep Yadav broke the partnership by trapping Mitchell lbw.The dismissals of Tom Latham (14), Glenn Phillips (12), and Michael Bracewell (2) in quick succession put further pressure on Williamson. Despite that, the New Zealand captain displayed his class with crisp stroke play, including two elegant cover drives off Jadeja.However, his resistance came to an end when Axar Patel angled a fuller delivery past him, and Rahul completed a sharp stumping. With Williamson gone, India had the game firmly in their grasp.Earlier, India’s innings was built on Iyer’s responsible knock, a crucial 98-run partnership with Axar Patel (42 off 61), and a late flourish from Hardik Pandya (45 off 45).Unlike recent games where the top order provided a solid foundation, Iyer had to anchor the innings from the start after India suffered an early collapse, slipping to 30/3. He reached his half-century in 75 balls, lofting Rachin Ravindra for a six over long-on, while Axar offered steady support at the other end.Axar’s dismissal came against the run of play when he attempted a scoop off Ravindra, only to find Williamson. Iyer, aiming for a big score, fell short of a century, mistiming a pull shot off Will O’Rourke that was caught by Will Young.Batting at No. 6, KL Rahul contributed 23 off 29 balls, including a stunning six over long-on off Ravindra. However, his promising innings was cut short by a sharp catch from Latham off Mitchell Santner, who delivered another tidy spell with his well-disguised slower deliveries.Though wickets at regular intervals disrupted India’s momentum, Hardik provided the late push with aggressive stroke play, propelling India close to the 250-run mark.The innings had started on a shaky note, with Rohit Sharma, Shubman Gill, and Virat Kohli departing early, leaving India in trouble at 30/3. However, Iyer’s steady hand and the contributions from Axar and Hardik ensured India posted a competitive total—one that proved enough for their spinners to dismantle New Zealand and secure victory.",India beat New Zealand by 44 runs to top Group A of ICC Champions Trophy.

LIVE from Dubai | Unstoppable India 🇮🇳 remain UNBEATEN | Champions Trophy title loading?

: It took New Zealand just 6.4 overs to send India's top three - Rohit Sharma , Shubman Gill, Virat Kohli - back to the hut and the side was in a spot of bother at 30/3. The last time the Men in Blue had a similar start in ODIs was back in the 2019 World Cup semi-final against the same opposition where they lost three wickets in just 3.1 overs. During the period between these two fixtures, no other side managed to see the back of India's top-three quicker than what the Black Caps managed in the Champions Trophy fixture on Sunday.Early departure of the two openers meant Shreyas Iyer walked out to bat in just the sixth over of the innings and then saw Glenn Phillips take a blinder to get rid of Virat Kohli in the next over. Three down, repair job to be done and Iyer dropped anchor! Showing a lot of restraint for the first 30 deliveries , the right-hander was happy to soak in all the pressure as even singles were difficult to come by early in the innings. There was a passage in play where India went without a boundary for 52 balls and the scoreboard continued to move at a snail's pace. The pitch was retaining its sluggish nature and smart bowling by New Zealand meant run-making wasn't a fluent affair. Runs, however, weren't a priority then as India were in a desperate need of a partnership, and Iyer took charge of the ship and navigated it out of choppy waters.It took him 31 deliveries to score his first boundary but once it came, the next two were scored in the same over and Iyer looked fluent in his approach after the quick bite and generous amount of fluids during the drinks interval. When spin was introduced from both ends, Iyer grew in confidence and stamped his class with sublime footwork. It wasn't just restricted to moving forward or going deep in the crease, but also saw him go sideways on multiple occasions while facing Mitchell Santner who gave nothing away.Iyer's dot-ball percentage remained very high vs Santner as the right-hander scored only 11 runs off the 22 deliveries he faced but continued to play the situation, and aced the middle-overs grind to perfection. Having a left-hander in Axar at the other end helped as the two stitched a 98-run partnership to give a launchpad for the slog-overs specialists.Against Iyer, New Zealand did lay the short-ball trap but the 30-year-old looked largely in control against the likes of Matt Henry, Kylie Jamieson and William O Rourke. He had an aggressive mindset while facing short music and attacked nearly half the deliveries which pinged the short/short-of-good length mark. It was a sharp short delivery by O Rourke which got the better of him in the end but by now means was it a suggestion that the same old trick works against Iyer.Having played a lot of domestic cricket for Mumbai, Iyer got an opportunity to work on his technique and has returned a much tighter batter. He had explained during the England ODIs how addition of drop-in shots against deliveries which are directed closer to his body added a lot of range to his game and allowed him to explore different scoring options. The results are for everyone to see as he has now hit four half-centuries in the last six ODIs for the country and the only low score came in the Champions Trophy opener vs Bangladesh.It took him 75 balls to get to his half-century, the slowest of his career, vs New Zealand but definitely the one which would have given him a lot of satisfaction. With the side's back to the wall, Iyer rose tall and reminded of his class as India's No.4 in ODIs.","India lost three wickets in just 3.1 overs against New Zealand in World Cup semi-final. It took New Zealand just 6.4 overs to send Rohit Sharma, Shubman Gill and Virat Kohli back to the hut. Shreyas Iyer took charge of the ship and navigated it out of choppy waters. He has now hit four half-centuries in the last six ODIs for the country.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118665753,imgsize-51982,width-400,resizemode-4/118665753.jpg"

MUMBAI: It's been one of the classic fixtures in the Indian Super League in recent seasons, and Saturday was another example why.Reduced to 10 men in the 58th minute, harshly they might have felt, Mumbai City produced a spirited second half comeback to hold newly crowned champions Mohun Bagan SG to a thrilling 2-2 draw at the Mumbai Football Arena .In a season where the Islanders have often looked vulnerable at home, Petr Kratky's side appeared to be heading for another defeat here when they found themselves 2-0 down at halftime. The visitors showed no signs of any hangover from the 1-0 win over Odisha last Sunday which saw the Mariners become the first team in the ISL to defend the Shield.A fine finish by Jamie Maclaren in the 32nd minute followed by Dimitrios Petratos's tap-in from close range (41st) had the Bagan supporters in the stands buzzing.Around 1300 of them belonged to the Mumbai Pune Mariners fan club. “There was already a plan to come for this game as there was the possibility of the title being won here,” one of the supporters told TOI.Odisha's loss, of course, spared Mumbai that embarrassing likelihood, but the Islanders had more to gain from this fixture with their playoff berth far from guaranteed.The Islanders gave the home fans reason to believe in another comeback when a wellworked corner routine was finished off in fortunate fashion (57th). Bagan defender Thomas Aldred's headed clearance off Valpuia's rightfooted attempt saw the ball rebound off Jon Toral's knee into the goal.Less than a minute after the restart, Mumbai were reduced to 10 men when Vikram Partap Singh picked up a dubious second booking following a tussle with Subhasish Bose. As often happens in these situations, the sense of injustice appeared to galvanise Kratky's men, and they were duly rewarded with an 89th minute equaliser through Nathan Rodrigues.","Mumbai City produce a spirited second half comeback to hold newly crowned champions Mohun Bagan SG to a thrilling 2-2 draw at the Mumbai Football Arena.

The race to the Serie A title remains closely contested after Napoli held rivals Inter Milan to a 1-1 draw on Sunday, thanks to a late equaliser by Danish midfielder Philip Billing at the Stadio Diego Armando Maradona.The result keeps the reigning champions just one point behind league leaders Inter.With just three minutes left on the clock, Billing slotted in his maiden strike for Napoli, shortly after replacing Billy Gilmour.On loan from Bournemouth, the 32-year-old capitalized on a driving run from Stanislav Lobotka, reacting quickest to slot home after his initial effort was saved by Inter goalkeeper Josep Martinez.Until Billing’s intervention, Federico Dimarco’s stunning 22nd-minute free-kick looked set to secure a crucial victory for Inter in their title defense.Simone Inzaghi’s side found themselves under intense pressure for much of the match and had to rely on desperate defending in a bid to claim all three points.Inzaghi's plans were disrupted when both Federico Dimarco and Hakan Calhanoglu were forced off with injuries shortly after halftime, while Marcus Thuram also had to be replaced by Joaquin Correa in his first game back from an ankle injury.Inter could hardly have faced Napoli at a more opportune moment, with Antonio Conte’s side stumbling through February, collecting just three points from four matches after previously appearing destined for a second title in three seasons.However, despite Inter’s resilient defensive effort—marked by last-ditch tackles and desperate clearances—their resistance was finally broken by Billing, who rescued his new team in just his second appearance since signing in January.Billing’s late equalizer also offered a lifeline to Atalanta, who extended their winless run at home to five Serie A matches, but remain third, after a goalless draw against Venezia. They are three points behind Inter.Gian Piero Gasperini’s side are still in the title race but have struggled to deliver in front of their home fans, failing to win a domestic fixture in Bergamo since the start of the year. They missed a golden opportunity to draw level with Inter before the showdown in Naples.Davide Zappacosta came closest to scoring five minutes before halftime, striking the outside of the post after excellent work from Ademola Lookman.Lookman himself squandered a one-on-one chance against Venezia goalkeeper Ionut Radu earlier in the match and later blazed over from close range in the 82nd minute.",Philip Billing scores late equaliser as Napoli draw 1-1 with Inter Milan.

Bournemouth edge Wolves in penalty shootout; Preston shock Burnley

Manchester City overcame a first-half scare to defeat Plymouth Argyle 3-1 at the Etihad on Saturday, securing their place in the FA Cup quarter-finals. Meanwhile, Crystal Palace advanced with a 3-1 victory over Millwall, but the match was overshadowed by a serious injury to striker Jean-Philippe Mateta.Plymouth, who stunned Premier League leaders Liverpool in the previous round, looked set for another shock when Maksym Talovierov’s 38th-minute header put the Championship side ahead.Argyle boss Miron Muslic had called the opportunity to face Pep Guardiola the ""biggest honour"" of his career, and his side nearly delivered a dream result. However, City's 19-year-old midfielder Nico O'Reilly stole the spotlight, scoring twice from set-pieces to turn the tie around.O'Reilly’s first goal just before half-time settled City's nerves, before he powered in Phil Foden's corner 14 minutes from time. Star striker Erling Haaland, who started on the bench, came on late and assisted Kevin De Bruyne for City’s third goal in stoppage time.Crystal Palace’s derby victory over Millwall was marred by a horrifying injury to Mateta, who was stretchered off after being accidentally kicked in the head by Millwall goalkeeper Liam Roberts just eight minutes into the match.Roberts, who initially won the ball, caught Mateta with his boot while clearing outside the penalty area. After a VAR review, referee Michael Oliver upgraded his initial decision to a red card.Palace manager Oliver Glasner was furious, stating the tackle could have ended Mateta's career. ""Just imagine if he hits his face straight, with his power, with the studs, it is the end of JP's career,"" he said.Mateta later reassured fans on Instagram: ""Thank you for all your kind messages. I'm doing well. I hope to be back very soon. And stronger than ever.""Palace capitalised on their numerical advantage, with Japhet Tanganga’s own goal opening the scoring in the 33rd minute.

NEW DELHI: Millwall goalkeeper Liam Roberts was involved in a reckless incident during Saturday's FA Cup match against Crystal Palace.

However, after being advised by VAR to review the incident on the pitch-side monitor, Oliver showed Roberts a straight red card.Mateta had scored eight goals in his previous nine games and has 15 in total for Palace this season. The 27-year-old also netted five times as France won silver at the Paris Olympics last year.Palace made use of the man advantage for virtually the whole game to book their place in the quarter-finals.Japhet Tanganga's own goal broke the visitors' resistance before Daniel Munoz prodded in a second.Wes Harding pulled a goal back for the Lions, 13 minutes into first-half stoppage time added on for Mateta's treatment.Palace were made to wait until 82 minutes to ensure progress when Eddie Nketiah's looping header found the far corner.",Millwall goalkeeper Liam Roberts sent off for reckless challenge on Jean- Philippe Mateta.

MUMBAI: As Mumbai City welcome champions Mohun Bagan SG at the Mumbai Football Arena on Saturday, the fixture serves as a reminder of how drastically circumstances have changed compared to when the two sides clashed in Kolkata just under a year ago.Back then, just two points separated leaders Mumbai and second-placed Bagan, as they battled it out for the Shield in a dream final match of the league phase.The Islanders will find it ironic to think that their quest to become the first Indian Super League side to defend the Shield was wrecked that mid-April evening at Salt Lake Stadium by a team who now own that piece of history.Dimitrios Petratos ’s injurytime winner against Odisha last Sunday ensured Bagan would accomplish what Mumbai couldn’t — win the Shield in successive seasons.Even as the Kolkata giants have maintained their level, it’s been a different story for Petr Kratky’s Mumbai who have struggled to find consistency all season. A look at the table sums up the glaring difference between the two teams this time, as 20 points separate the champions from the Islanders, who sit in sixth spot with 32 points from 21 matches. Kratky, however, maintains his side haven’t declined, in fact going on to insist that Mumbai have even improved in some areas.""If we talk about levels, Mohun Bagan is more effective in final third, scoring more goals than us,"" said the Mumbai coach.","Mumbai City welcome champions Mohun Bagan SG at the Mumbai Football Arena on Saturday.

The Open's plan is to reschedule mixed-doubles as a standalone feature during the qualifying draw, tossing out $1 million in prize-money.This year's mixed-doubles event in New York, perhaps inspired by the vibe of last year's 'Mixed Madness' mela, will feature 16 pairs as against the 32 that make up mixed-doubles draws at Grand Slams. It will be played on August 19-20, three days before the start of the main draw. The qualification process has also been changed, with eight teams earning direct entry courtesy their combined singles ranking, while the other eight teams will be wildcard entries. Rohan Bopanna , still going strong in doubles at almost 45 years, said it was a lost opportunity for doubles specialists, who look forward to playing two events in Grand Slams -- doubles and mixed doubles. ""I don't think any doubles players can really play the mixed doubles. This year's US Open will be the first Grand Slam where we are not playing two events,"" Bopanna told TOI on the sidelines of the Dubai Duty Free Tennis championships here.Bopanna believes doubles is still a popular option for singles players on the ATP Tour. ""All the guys who enjoy doubles play doubles on the circuit,"" Bopanna said. ""The system is such that you can use singles ranking to get into doubles, on the ATP Tour you see a bunch of guys playing doubles and they enjoy it.""Yuki Bhambri, the India No.2 in the individual doubles ranking, said the USTA knew exactly what they were doing when they wrung in the changes. ""Grand Slams especially have always talked about tradition, that's why they never want to shorten matches,"" he said. ""They do that when it suits them, obviously business over (other) interests. The mixed doubles for a lot of countries like Great Britain, India and Australia has been a source of Grand Slam achievement. You're never going to get an opportunity like that with what they've done.""""You're essentially having the singles guys play a practice week,"" the 32-year-old Bhambri said, adding, ""It is obviously a sad day and a loss for a lot of the doubles players. We've all spoken about that, everyone is aware of what they've done and how they've gone about it.""Last year's Mixed Madness exhibition event before the start of the main draw saw a number of high-profile singles players pairing up. American Coco Gauff said she wouldn't be playing the mixed event this time even though she enjoyed being a part of Mixed Madness last year. ""It's an interesting situation because (on one side) some (players) rely on mixed doubles and it's an event that's been there forever. On the other hand, I know they're trying to get more singles players involved, maybe grow the sport,"" Gauff said, ""I most likely won't be participating just because it's not a great time for me, it will take away from the preparation for US Open.""",The US Open has cut and changed the draw of its mixed-doubles event.

Stefanos Tsitsipas secured his first title in nearly a year by defeating Felix Auger-Aliassime 6-3, 6-3 in the Dubai final on Saturday.""There is nothing that ensured the win today, it was just pure fighting,"" said Tsitsipas after winning in one hour and 28 minutes.The Greek player ended his unsuccessful run in ATP 500-level finals with this victory.While Tsitsipas has previously won the season-ending ATP Finals and top-tier ATP 1000 events, he had lost all 11 of his previous finals at 500 tournaments, including two defeats in Dubai to Roger Federer in 2019 and Novak Djokovic in 2020.""It's a big relief that I'm able to hold that trophy after the third attempt. It's something that I had in the back of my mind, and I'm happy to say I accomplished it.""Unseeded Canadian Auger-Aliassime entered the match with the momentum, having won tournaments in Adelaide in January and Montpellier in February.""I had a great opponent on the other side of the net, I knew it was a difficult task. I'm just proud of the way I managed the pressure and was able to perform in those crucial moments.""Tsitsipas controlled the match from the baseline and maintained his serve throughout, despite facing break points twice in each set.He broke the Canadian's serve in the seventh and ninth games of the first set, and secured the decisive break in the eighth game of the second set.Tsitsipas, who had fallen from world No.3 in early 2023 to 11th place, will climb to ninth when the ATP rankings update on Monday.""These are the things we are fighting for as professional tennis players. To be owning a spot in the top 10 is definitely one of the greatest feelings a tennis player can experience. It comes with hard work and sacrifices, but I'm happy that I'm in a position where I can really celebrate.""",Stefanos Tsitsipas beats Felix Auger-Aliassime in Dubai Duty Free Tennis Championship.

DUBAI: The thread running through Stefanos Tsitsipas ’ run at the Dubai Duty Free tennis championship this week has been his fight, not the lack of it. The gifted Greek appeared lost on the court for most part of the last couple of years, and it gradually reflected on his ranking which dipped out of the top-10 for the first time in five years last Feb.The 26-year-old backed himself with successive three set wins over Karen Khachanov and Matteo Berrettini to make the last-four here, his first ATP 500 semis since last July. Tsitsipas then beat Dutchman Tallon Griekspoor 6-4, 6-4 to make the final, where he meets Felix Auger-Aliassime .""The ability to fight is the most important one for an athlete, once you lose that, you are useless on the court,"" Tsitsipas said. ""There is no match without fighting, you have to fight. The best victories are the ones you fought for. You’re not in control (of the match) and you somehow find that little gap and you win the match, that’s the most thrilling moment a tennis player can experience.""You feel a little lost, not that confident with certain things that you have done to your game,"" Tsitsipas said of the road back. ""It’s difficult to fake the confidence. It helps if you win, and you see yourself in the level that you are kind of imagining in your mind. That brings you confidence.""The World No.11 – a six-time Grand Slam semifinalist, and twice finalist at Roland Garros (2021) and Australian Open (2023) – rued the lost opportunity of seasons gone. ""I wish I had more of those matches where I fought and came back and won,"" he said. ""There were not enough of those moments in 2024. I need to recreate those moments.""Not unsurprisingly, the Tsitsipas corner wears a different look these days. Tsitsipas’ father Apostolos, a disruptive presence at courtside, was his longtime coach until the 6-feet-4 pro announced in Aug that he wouldn’t be working with his father any longer and introduced his new coach Dimitris Chatzinikolaou , the Greek Davis Cup captain.","Stefanos Tsitsipas is through to the final of the Dubai Duty Free tennis championship.

The Russian, known as much for his mercurial temper as for his penchant for self-harm, beating himself with his racket and leaving his hands and legs bloodied, spoke about his struggles with burnout and depression.""I was completely lost. I was thinking what's the purpose of living,"" said Rublev, who has battled in the dark for a few years now.

""It starts to grow more and more, and you want to cut the arm.""Rublev, who fell in the first round of the Australian Open , won his 17th career title in Doha last week. ""I was taking antidepressants, but after one year of taking antidepressants, I realized that in the beginning you feel a bit better, then nothing afterwards,"" he said. ""After some time I realized that while it's not getting worse, something was weird. I didn't like that feeling so I stopped taking the medication.""With the help of his charismatic compatriot Marat Safin , a former World No. 1, Rublev started finding his way back. ""Marat made me understand myself, that was a bit of a restart from the bottom. From there, little by little, I started to move in a better direction,"" he said, adding, ""I'm not in a good or a bad place (now), but I'm not feeling any more stress, I'm not feeling anxious, I'm not having depression. I'm just neutral. Not happy, not bad, but I have found a base and that's a beginning.""The main thing is to be honest with yourself,"" the World No. 9 said. ""All of us think that we (may not be) honest with people, but with ourselves we are honest. This is a huge lie because most people are not even honest with themselves. I was the same. I (thought) I have no problem saying if I'm wrong, if I'm right, if I made a mistake.""I was lying to myself about many things. I didn't even want to understand or notice it. You need someone who can make you see yourself in an honest way.""""People put masks on, they make excuses for that, I'm doing that because someone hurt me or I don't want them to see the real me.,"" he said, ""They are already lying, running away from the problem, finding an excuse. They don't want to face themselves. The first thing is to be honest with yourself, then start to be more aware.""This search for his true self is stirred by a one-word reminder - responsibility -which Rublev writes on his shoes. Every time he looks down the word stares back at him. ""I'm putting that word there to remind myself that I'm the one, it's not because of anything or anyone.

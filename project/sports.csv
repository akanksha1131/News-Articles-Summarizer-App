Mohammed Siraj press conference: gearing up for series decider vs New Zealand

INDORE: With their dominance in Tests on home soil now a thing of the past, India will hope for the ageless duo of Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma to fire in unison and complement the highly consistent KL Rahul as they strive to protect their proud ODI record at home against the resolute Kiwis in the series-deciding third ODI here on Sunday.While Kohli and KL Rahul’s sensational form is highly encouraging, the hosts would be worried by the poor returns of left-arm wrist spinner Kuldeep Yadav, who appeared to be too slow in the air as he ended up conceding 1-82 in 10 overs.Going by India’s intense threehour training session on Saturday, ace left-arm seamer Arshdeep Singh could be back in the XI, probably at the expense of Prasidh Krishna. It will be interesting to see if India hand a debut to batting allrounder Ayush Badoni, a useful off-spinner, for the injured Washington Sundar, and leave out Nitish Kumar Reddy from the final XI.Reddy ended up bowling only two overs in the second ODI and was criticised for not making use of his chances by India’s assistant coach Ryan ten Doeschate.India last lost a bilateral ODI series at home in March 2023, when Australia reversed a 0-1 deficit to win 2-1.After winning their first Test series in India 3-0 in Nov 2024, New Zealand, who have travelled to these shores for bilateral ODIs since 1988, will be itching to do the same in ODIs.Considering that it’s an inexperienced Black Caps squad — eight players are touring India for the first time and they fielded two debutants in the first two matches — it’ll be a massive achievement.Pacer Kristian Clarke, who took 3-56 in Rajkot, played his first ODI in Vadodara, while left-arm spinner Jaydon Lennox made a decent debut in Rajkot, taking 1/42 in 10 overs.With his massive appetite for scoring runs against India in India in ODIs, Daryl Mitchell has proven to be a major thorn in the flesh for the Men in Blue.Mitchell’s last four ODI scores versus India in India read: 130 (127), 134 (119), 84 (71), 131* (117).",India face New Zealand in the third ODI in Mumbai on Sunday. The hosts have not lost a bilateral ODI series at home since March 2023. New Zealand won their first Test series in India 3-0 in Nov 2024.

Bangladesh cricket in turmoil: What it means for the T20 World Cup?

Controversy erupted during the U-19 World Cup 2026 match between India and Bangladesh after the two captains did not exchange the customary handshake at the toss, triggering widespread discussion on social media. India captain Ayush Mhatre and Bangladesh vice-captain Zawad Abrar, who attended the toss in place of regular skipper Azizul Hakim, went through the formalities without the traditional greeting, prompting speculation amid the prevailing political tensions between the two countries.Addressing the issue, the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) clarified that the absence of a handshake was “completely unintentional and resulted from a momentary lapse in concentration”. The board reiterated this position in an official statement issued on Saturday, stressing that there was no deliberate intent behind the incident.The toss took place at the Queens Sports Club in Bulawayo ahead of the 2026 ICC Under-19 World Cup clash, with proceedings delayed due to rain. Bangladesh won the toss and elected to field first. With Azizul Hakim sidelined by illness, vice-captain Abrar represented Bangladesh at the toss alongside Mhatre, where the moment quickly drew attention even before play began.“The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) has taken note of an inadvertent and unwarranted action that occurred at the toss prior to the opening match of the ICC Under 19 World Cup 2026, Zimbabwe & Namibia, between Bangladesh and India. Due to illness, regular captain Azizul Hakim was unable to attend the toss, and vice-captain Zawad Abrar represented the team on the occasion.“The BCB wishes to clarify that the absence of a handshake with the opposition captain was completely unintentional and resulted from a momentary lapse in concentration. There was no intent whatsoever to show discourtesy or disregard towards the opposition.“The Board has viewed the matter with due seriousness, as upholding the spirit of cricket and respect for opponents is a fundamental prerequisite for representing Bangladesh at any level and immediately advised the team management accordingly.“The players have also been reminded of their responsibility to maintain the highest standards of sportsmanship, camaraderie and mutual respect in all interactions with opposing teams. The Bangladesh Cricket Board remains fully committed to the values of cricket, both on and off the field,” said the BCB in its statement.Such incidents are not without precedent. Similar situations occurred during last year’s senior Men’s T20 Asia Cup, when India and Pakistan captains did not shake hands at the toss in all three matches. The latest episode comes amid broader strains in cricketing ties between Bangladesh and India.The BCB is also seeking to avoid playing its Men’s T20 World Cup fixtures in India, particularly after the BCCI requested IPL three-time winners Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) to release Bangladesh pacer Mustafizur Rahman from its squad for the 2026 season.",Controversy erupted during the U-19 World Cup 2026 match between India and Bangladesh.

Bangladesh cricket in turmoil: What it means for the T20 World Cup?

Former India cricketer Manoj Tiwary has strongly criticised India assistant coach Ryan ten Doeschate for his remarks on Rohit Sharma ’s recent form in the ongoing ODI series against New Zealand.Ten Doeschate had suggested that Rohit’s modest returns—scores of 26 and 24 in the first two matches—might be due to a lack of game time. However, Rohit returned to international cricket in October with a bang, scoring a fifty and a century in the ODI series in Australia to claim the Player of the Series award, before carrying that momentum into India’s home series against South Africa. He also played in Mumbai’s first two Vijay Hazare Trophy games last month, including a commanding century in the opener.Speaking to PTI, Tiwary, who was a former IPL teammate of ten Doeschate at KKR, hit back: “With a lot of respect, I would like to tell Ryan ten Doeschate that he was with me for four years at KKR. No doubt he is a very good person, but the kind of comment he has made, I think he should have thought about it. He has also played international cricket for the Netherlands, but if you look at his international record, I say this with all due respect—it is not even 5% of what Rohit has achieved in his career, not just as a batter but also as a captain. ”Tiwary described the comment as demoralising, especially given it came from a member of the support staff, and called on ten Doeschate to reflect on his words.“He has given the nation so much happiness by winning the Champions Trophy also and after that, talking like this, that too when he is in the team, not like he is sitting at home and commenting, he is a part of the management, and telling like this about your player is demoralising. I don’t know why he said that. He has to reflect on this. I feel he must not make such comments,” Tiwary added.India will face New Zealand in the final ODI of the three-match series on January 18 in Indore. Rohit, who has retired from Tests and T20Is, will then take a break from international cricket ahead of India’s England tour in the summer.","Former India cricketer Manoj Tiwary has strongly criticised Ryan ten Doeschate for his remarks on Rohit Sharma ’s recent form in the ongoing ODI series against New Zealand.

India vs New Zealand: 'Ravindra Jadeja needs to look at his form or...'

Former Indian cricketer Manoj Tiwary has voiced his disappointment over the recent public spat involving legendary boxer Mary Kom and her ex-husband, Karung Onkholer Kom, which has captured national attention.Speaking in a video post, Tiwary said he was deeply hurt by Mary Kom’s comments on Aap Ki Adalat, where she stated, “To be honest, he married me, and he got everything from my earning. He did not earn a single rupee.” Tiwary noted that while he has no personal connection to the matter, he is aware of the strong support systems behind national-level athletes. “As a former player, I know how much a support system matters. In Mary Kom’s case, her husband had played a significant role in her journey,” he said.Tiwary recalled that Mary Kom herself had previously acknowledged that Onkholer supported her while she trained, looked after their children, and managed other responsibilities. He expressed concern over the impact of her remarks on her ex-husband’s mental state. “To publicly humiliate someone on national television after the relationship has ended is alarming. I fear for his mental well-being,” Tiwari added.He went on to stress that in any relationship, both partners contribute in different ways at different times, and expressed gratitude for the support he has received from his own wife. “Through this video, I salute all husbands and wives who act as a strong support system for each other,” he concluded.The couple had formally separated over two years ago, completing a customary divorce under the Kom community law on December 20, 2023. Mary Kom has alleged financial misconduct by her ex-husband, claiming she lost crores of rupees, land purchased with her earnings, and that loans were taken against her property. Onkholer has denied the claims, saying he lives in a rented house in Delhi and challenging her to provide proof.While Mary Kom has stated that she does not seek police action and only wants the matter resolved, the issue continues to stir debate across social media and news platforms. Tiwary later deleted the video.","Former Indian cricketer Manoj Tiwary has voiced his disappointment over the recent public spat involving legendary boxer Mary Kom and her ex-husband, Karung Onkholer Kom.

Allan Donald on Virat Kohli’s legacy: Can he reach 100 centuries?

NAVI MUMBAI: 24 hours can be a long time in sport. A day after she was retired out while batting on 47 off 36 balls in a debatable decision by UP Warriorz head coach Abhishek Nayar, a fired-up Harleen Deol cracked a scintillating 64 not out off just 39 balls, which included 12 gloriously-timed fours, to star in her team’s morale-boosting seven-wicket over the Mumbai Indians at the DY Patil Stadium on Thursday night.Not only did Harleen ‘troll’ Nayar, who was seen applauding her every shot, with her classy display, she also played a stellar role in UPW’s first win in WPL-2026 after three defeats. They are still at the bottom of the five-team table, but UPW will take heart from the win, while MI are at the second spot with two wins and an equal number of defeats.Starting off with her first three scoring shots being fours, the India batter kept peppering the off-side boundary-10 of her fours were in that direction. While she isn’t a power-hitter, the 27-year-old relies more on her sublime timing and wonderful ability to thread gaps in the field.Looking determined to prove her worth, Harleen, a part of India's 2025 ODI World Cup winning team, added 73 in 49 balls with Aussie Phoebe Litchfield (25, 22b, 2x4, 1x6) for the third wicket, and then 44* for the fourth wicket with South African allrounder Chloe Tryon (27 not out, 11b, 4x4, 1x6) in just 20 balls as UPW cantered home with 11 balls to spare.Besides striking some fine blows in the end to help UP reach the 162-run target, Tryon took two catches- the one of MI’s in-form captain Harmanpreet Kaur 916, 11b, 1x4, 1x6), a brilliant diving effort at square leg off leggie Asha Shobhana-proving to be decisive.Earlier, MI’s openers Amanjot Kaur (38, 33b, 7x4) and ‘keeper-bat Gunalan Kamalini (5, 12b) took 44 balls while adding 43, managing just 32 in the Powerplay-the lowest in WPL-2026 so far. UPW kept things tight, with both their pacers Shikha Pandey (1-25 in four overs) and Kranti Goud (0-28 in four overs), who was bowled out at the start, delivering a fine opening spell. Both Kaur, who at least got a few boundaries, and Kamlini, who looks out of place at this level, eventually holed out.Harmanpreet, currently the top run-getter in the fourth season of the Women’s Premier League, endured a rare failure.However, it was the perfect time for Sciver-Brunt, returning in this game after missing the last match due to illness, to show off her class. Taking the responsibility of steering MI to a good total on her broad shoulders, the England captain slammed a sublime 65 off 43 balls, with her knock adorned by nine fours and a six.Sciver-Brunt found an able ally in MI’s new recruit, Australian allrounder Nicola Carey, who smashed a quickfire 32 (20b, 5x4) as the duo added 85 off just 44 balls in a fourth wicket partnership which gave MI’s innings wings and fuel at the perfect time. The duo’s fireworks helped MI, who were crawling at 54 for two after 10 overs, plunder 93 off their last eight overs after they got just 68 off the first 12. They eventually managed to put up a par total of 161 for five in 20 overs.Letting it loose, the English/Aussie duo squeezed out 33 runs in two overs-the 15th and the 16th-to give some much-needed impetus to the MI innings.If Nat-Sciver smashed two fours (both savage pull shots) a six down the ground off Shobana, collecting 17 in the 15th over, Carey took four fours off Tryon in the 16th over.",Harleen Deol scores 64 not out in UP Warriorz's seven-wicket win over Mumbai Indians.

MELBOURNE: Carlos Alcaraz warned Friday that he was ""hungry"" to break his Australian Open title drought and become the youngest man to complete a career Grand Slam, calling it his primary target in 2026.The world number one from Spain is the title favourite along with two-time defending champion and great rival Jannik Sinner.The Melbourne Park crown is the only one of the four majors that Alcaraz has never won, his best performance the quarter-finals in 2024 and 2025.If he goes all the way this year he will surpass fellow Spaniard Rafael Nadal as the youngest man to win all four majors. Nadal was 24 when he achieved the feat.The 22-year-old Alcaraz, who begins his title assault against Australia's 79th-ranked Adam Walton, said he could not wait to get going.""I think this is my main goal for this year,"" said Alcaraz, whose only warm-up was a win against Italy's Sinner in a light-hearted exhibition match in South Korea.""So it's going to be really interesting for me how I prepared, which I think I just made a really good pre-season, just to be in a good shape.""I'm just hungry for the title, hungry to do a really good result here. I'm just getting ready as much as I can.""I'm really excited about the tournament beginning.""Alcaraz was asked by reporters if he would swap titles at all three of the other majors this year for one Melbourne crown.Underlining just how important winning the Australian Open and nailing the career Grand Slam is to him, he said he could not decide.""I don't know which one I would choose,"" he said, smiling broadly.""Obviously complete the career Grand Slam is something amazing to do, be able to be the youngest that has done it before, you know, is even better.""- No change after split -There has been much focus on Alcaraz's coaching team in the build-up to Melbourne.In December the six-time major champion abruptly announced that he was splitting from coach Juan Carlos Ferrero after seven hugely successful years together, with assistant Samuel Lopez taking over.Alcaraz began working with Ferrero, a former world number one, when he was a teenager.Quizzed by reporters for the reasons behind the surprise split, Alcaraz said that it felt like the right time to end the partnership and was a mutual decision.""With Juan Carlos, we decided to do it. I'm just having plenty of confidence in the team that I have right now,"" he said.""As I said, practice has been really good.

Allan Donald on Virat Kohli’s legacy: Can he reach 100 centuries?

DHAKA: Bangladesh cricket’s simmering internal feud finally boiled over on Thursday. The flashpoint came at the Bangladesh Premier League (BPL), where a player revolt threatened to derail the tournament. With matches being cancelled as players refused to take the field, the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) removed director M Najmul Islam from his post of chairman of the finance committee with immediate effect.The decision came after two BPL games and four in the Dhaka league didn’t take place due to players’ boycott, starting with the inaugural BPL tie between Chattogram Royals and Noakhali Express. CWAB, the players’ body, was demanding Islam’s resignation for making insulting remarks against players.I n a media statement, the BCB said that after “reviewing recent developments” and “in the best interest of the organisation”, the president had released Najmul Islam from his responsibilities. The board said the decision was taken under the authority vested in the BCB president by Article 31 of the BCB constitution and was aimed at ensuring the “continued smooth and effective functioning of the board’s affairs”.Until further notice, the BCB president will serve as acting chairman of the finance committee.The BCB reiterated that cricketers’ interest “remain its highest priority” and said the board was fully committed to upholding “the honour and dignity of all players under its jurisdiction”. The statement also urged cricketers to “display the highest standards of professionalism and dedication” during what it described as a “challenging period for the game”, and to “do their utmost” to ensure participation in the BPL.The crisis erupted in the wake of Bangladesh’s request to shift their T20 World Cup matches out of India following bowler Mustafizur Rahman ’s removal from IPL team KKR. Najmul made a series of remarks that cricketers found inflammatory.“Why (should players be compensated for not playing the T20 World Cup in India)? Are we asking them to return the crores and crores of taka that we are spending on them? We are spending so much money on them, they are not being able to do anything. Have we got any international awards? Let us now ask them for the money back,” Najmul Islam had said, sparking the player revolt.Earlier, he had labelled former captain Tamim Iqbal an “Indian agent” for disagreeing with BCB’s request. It remains to be seen if removing him solely from the finance committee chairmanship will be enough to bring players back to the stadium.","Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) remove director M Najmul Islam from his post of chairman of the finance committee with immediate effect.

NEW DELHI: The national selection committee and team management are sweating over Washington Sundar ’s availability for next month’s T20 World Cup after it emerged that a side strain is more serious than first anticipated and will rule the allrounder out of the T20I series against New Zealand starting next week.Sources said that the team management is already preparing backup plans for the initial stages of the tournament. TOI has learnt that the BCCI medical team has suggested that the team management wait for another week to get a proper assessment of Washington’s timeline of recovery. But it is also understood that they been advised to think of a ‘Plan B’ because the recovery period could be cutting it fine.India have other injury worries too. While Tilak Varma is only ruled out of the first three T20Is, the team management has its fingers crossed till he takes the field after having undergone an emergency abdominal surgery last week.“As of now, the selectors and the team management have to think about a backup plan. There is a strong possibility Washington may not be fully fit for the initial stages of the World Cup. A call on his participation in the entire tournament can be discussed after a thorough report by the medical team.Since India mostly play associate nations in the first round of matches, there could be a case for not naming a replacement at all, giving him enough time to recover for the business end of the tournament. One must remember that he is not expected to start in the XI even when he is fit,” a BCCI source said.Washington is supposed to report to the Centre of Excellence (CoE) during the weekend. Sources said the medical team suspects the injury could be more serious than a mere side strain. A thorough assessment will be made of the area around his ribs.Teams are allowed to make changes till seven days before the start of the tournament. India are expected to play with a spin-heavy bowling attack during the T20 World Cup with Varun Chakravarthy, Kuldeep Yadav and Axar Patel likely to be the first-choice spinners.Like-forlike option, but waiting for CoE clearance post a shoulder-injury rehab.

Naseem Shah interview: Pakistan bowler opens up on bouts with injuries and tough recovery

NEW DELHI: A remarkable piece of cricketing history unfolded in the ongoing Presidents Trophy as Pakistan TV (PTV) shattered a 232-year-old record by registering the lowest successful run defence ever seen in first-class cricket.In an extraordinary finish, PTV defended a target of just 40 runs against Sui Northern Gas, winning the match by a narrow margin of two runs and etching their name into the record books.The previous mark had stood since 1794, when Oldfield successfully defended a total of 41 runs against Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) at Lord’s, sealing victory by six runs. More than two centuries later, PTV went one better, rewriting history in dramatic fashion.The hero of the contest was left-arm spinner Ali Usman, who delivered a sensational spell under immense pressure.He finished with outstanding figures of 6 for 9, ripping through the Sui Northern batting line-up and triggering a stunning collapse.Sui Northern were bundled out for just 37 runs, falling agonisingly short of the modest target and handing PTV a famous victory.The result looked highly unlikely earlier in the four-day contest.PTV were bowled out for 166 in their first innings, allowing Sui Northern to take firm control with a total of 238 and a commanding 72-run lead.Matters worsened for PTV in the second innings, where they could manage only 111 runs, leaving Sui Northern needing a seemingly straightforward 40 runs for victory.What followed, however, defied logic and expectation.

Bangladesh cricket in turmoil: What it means for the T20 World Cup?

Former Pakistan cricketer Basit Ali delivered a brutal assessment while reacting to the controversy involving Babar Azam during a Big Bash League match, even dragging Virat Kohli’s name into the debate.The incident occurred during the clash between Sydney Sixers and Sydney Thunder. Babar, batting in the 40s, pushed the final ball of the 11th over towards long-on and called for a single. Smith refused the run at the last moment, leaving Babar stranded mid-pitch and visibly annoyed.The situation escalated as the Sixers had already opted for the Power Surge, a two-over phase designed for aggressive scoring.Smith then made his intentions clear. The very next over turned into a statement as he smashed 32 runs, the most expensive over in Big Bash League history.Soon after, Babar’s innings came to an abrupt end. He was bowled on the first ball of the 13th over and walked off in frustration as he hit the boundary cushions with his bat.Reacting to the episode, Basit Ali defended Smith and placed the blame squarely on Babar.“Smith proved it next over. At one point, I thought he would hit six sixes in that over. He answered it, na? If Virat Kohli had wanted to take this single like Babar Azam, Steve Smith ka baap bhi single leta! (Even Steve Smith's father would've taken it)” Basit said, suggesting that the Australian batter wouldn't deny Kohli.Not everyone agreed with that view. Former Pakistan wicketkeeper Kamran Akmal felt Smith’s action crossed a line.“This shouldn't have happened. I understand Smith hit a fast hundred. He could have told Babar before that the ball ‘Don't take a single'. Not like this. This is a disrespect. If Sydney Sixers aren't happy with Babar, drop him. Don't disrespect him like this. Make him sit out, only… But don't do this,” he added.Basit, however, stood firm. He insisted Babar’s recent form has lowered his standing. “You have brought your own value down with your game. Pakistan's name is not sullied by this. People who say that are fools. Babar went to play Big Bash because he was invited there, but the Pakistan cricket board didn't send him,” Basit Ali said.","Former Pakistan cricketer Basit Ali delivered a brutal assessment while reacting to the controversy involving Babar Azam during a Big Bash League match.

Royal Challengers Bengaluru maintained their winning streak in the Women’s Premier League, claiming an eighth-wicket triumph over Delhi Capitals on Saturday, with skipper Smriti Mandhana starring with an elegant half-century. This marked RCB’s fourth successive win, keeping them firmly atop the five-team standings, while Delhi remain at the bottom with three losses in four matches.Sent in to bat, Delhi Capitals endured a rocky start, losing Lizelle Lee and Laura Wolvaardt in the very first over. The slide continued as Jemimah Rodrigues, Marizanne Kapp, Niki Prasad, and Minnu Mani failed to make an impact, leaving DC reeling at 74 for 6 after just 8.1 overs. Amidst the collapse, explosive opener Shafali Verma played a counter-attacking innings, scoring a superb 62 off 41 balls, including five fours and four sixes.She anchored her side with vital partnerships of 59 runs with Niki Prasad and another 34 with Sneh Rana (22), keeping DC’s innings alive. Towards the end, debutant Lucy Hamilton added momentum with a quickfire 36 off 19 deliveries. Despite Shafali’s heroics, DC were restricted to 166 all out.Chasing the target, RCB stumbled early as Grace Harris fell in the third over. Mandhana, however, took charge with a commanding 96 off 61 balls, striking 13 boundaries and three sixes.She was ably supported by Georgia Voll, who scored a patient 54 not out off 42 balls with five fours and two sixes.The duo stitched together a 142-run partnership for the second wicket, steering RCB home in 18.2 overs with 10 balls to spare. Mandhana fell just short of her century, brilliantly caught by debutant Lucy Hamilton off Nandani Sharma, but the outcome was never in doubt.RCB’s victory highlighted Mandhana’s masterclass and the duo’s composure at the crease, showcasing why they remain at the summit of the WPL standings.","Royal Challengers Bengaluru beat Delhi Capitals by eight wickets.

Bangladesh cricket in turmoil: What it means for the T20 World Cup?

Brief scores:

Off-spinner Vihaan Malhotra delivered a match-turning spell of 4 for 14 to spark a dramatic collapse in Bangladesh’s chase, helping India secure an 18-run victory under the DLS method in a rain-affected U19 World Cup clash on Saturday.After India were restricted to 238 in a reduced 49-over contest, Bangladesh looked firmly in control of their chase, cruising at 102 for 2 after 20 overs with the DLS par score at 88. But the game swung sharply in India’s favour as Malhotra’s precise off-spin dismantled the middle order. He claimed the wickets of Kalam Siddiki (15), Sheikh Parvez Jibon (7), Rizan Hossan (15), and Samiun Basir (2), sparking panic in the Bangladeshi camp.Bangladesh ultimately collapsed from 106 for 2 to 146 all out in just 28.3 overs, falling well short of the revised 165-run target. Khilan Patel provided the decisive blow by dismissing Bangladesh captain Azizul Hakim, who top-scored with a composed 51 off 72 balls (4x4, 1x6). Henil Patel wrapped up the tail by removing Iqbal Hossain Emon to seal the victory.Earlier in the innings, Bangladesh had made a promising start despite losing Zawad Abrar in the first over to Deepesh Devendran.A steady partnership between Rifat Beg (37 off 37) and Hakim seemed to put the visitors on track, with Beg punishing the spinners with confident strokes, including a lofted six over deep square leg off Kanishk Chouhan.India’s innings had also seen its share of drama. Al Fahad had starred with the ball, taking 5/38 to rattle the Indian top order, removing captain Ayush Mhatre and Vedant Trivedi in quick succession. However, India’s response was steadied by Vaibhav Sooryavanshi and Abhigyan Kundu. Sooryavanshi, usually an aggressive batter, played a controlled knock of 72 off 67 balls (6x4, 3x6), while Kundu held the innings together with 80 off 112 balls (4x4, 3x6), surviving three reprieves along the way. The pair added 62 runs off 101 balls, rescuing India from an early top-order collapse.The result means India now top Group B with four points from two matches, while Bangladesh and USA remain yet to open their accounts. New Zealand has not yet started its campaign. Players from both sides exchanged handshakes and pleasantries on the field after a tense encounter, a contrast to the captains’ avoided handshake at the toss.India 238 in 48.4 overs (Abhigyan Kundu 80, Vaibhav Sooryavanshi 72; Al Fahad 5/38, Iqbal Hossain Emon 2/45, Azizul Hakim 2/42) beat Bangladesh 146 in 28.3 overs (Azizul Hakim 51; Vihaan Malhotra 4/14, Khilan Patel 2/35) by 18 runs via DLS method.","India beat Bangladesh by 18 runs under the DLS method in a rain-affected U19 World Cup clash on Saturday.

Bangladesh cricket in turmoil: What it means for the T20 World Cup?

The Bangladesh Cricket Board has formally requested the ICC to swap its national team with Ireland in Group C of the upcoming ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2026, in order to play its matches in Sri Lanka instead of India. Bangladesh are currently in Group C with the West Indies, Italy, England, and Nepal, with games scheduled in Kolkata and Mumbai, while Ireland is in Group B with Sri Lanka, Australia, Oman, and Zimbabwe, set to play in Colombo and Pallekele.A two-member ICC delegation, consisting of Gaurav Saxena, General Manager of Events and Corporate Communications, and Andrew Ephgrave, General Manager of the Integrity Unit, visited Dhaka to reassure the BCB about security arrangements in India and to advocate sticking to the original schedule. While Ephgrave attended in person, Saxena joined virtually after failing to secure a Bangladesh visa in time.“The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) today held a meeting with representatives of the International Cricket Council (ICC) to discuss matters relating to Bangladesh’s participation in the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2026,” the BCB said in a release.During the talks, the BCB reiterated its formal request to relocate Bangladesh’s matches to Sri Lanka and shared the Bangladesh Government’s concerns about the safety and security of players, fans, media, and other stakeholders.Representing the BCB were President Mohammad Aminul Islam, Vice Presidents Md Shakawath Hossain and Faruque Ahmed, Director and Chairman of the Cricket Operations Committee Nazmul Abedeen, and Chief Executive Officer Nizam Uddin Chowdhury.However, sources indicate that the ICC is hesitant to approve the move, citing logistical constraints and the significant disruptions such a swap would create at this stage of the tournament.The BCB’s request follows security concerns that arose after pacer Mustafizur Rahman was unexpectedly delinked from his IPL contract with Kolkata Knight Riders following a directive from the BCCI.“The discussions were conducted in a constructive, cordial and professional manner, with all parties engaging openly on the relevant issues. Among other points, the possibility of moving Bangladesh to a different group as a means of facilitating the matter with minimum logistical adjustments was discussed. The BCB and the ICC have agreed to continue engaging in constructive dialogue on this matter,” the statement added.The talks are expected to continue as both parties seek a workable solution to the ongoing impasse.","Bangladesh Cricket Board has formally requested the ICC to swap its national team with Ireland in the upcoming ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2026.

The making of Cooper Connolly: Australia’s 22-year-old star

NEW DELHI: India’s left-handed opener Abhishek Sharma has emerged as the embodiment of the fearless, high-tempo style the team wants to take into next month’s ICC T20 World Cup, according to former India batting coach Sanjay Bangar.With India set to begin their title defence against the USA at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai on February 7, Abhishek’s rise has added a new dimension to the side’s batting philosophy.At just 25, Abhishek has become a central figure in India’s ultra-aggressive approach at the top of the order.His impact in 2025 has been significant, finishing the year as the top-ranked T20 batter in the ICC rankings after scoring 859 runs.Bangar believes Abhishek’s mindset and skillset perfectly align with what India want to project in the shortest format.“Abhishek Sharma defines the way this Indian team wants to play in the T20 format. A fearless and aggressive brand of cricket is only possible with a player like Abhishek Sharma,” Bangar said on JioStar.Former India all-rounder Suresh Raina also underlined what makes Abhishek such a dangerous batter in modern T20 cricket.“I think his bat swing, the way he hits sixes off spinners while staying in his crease, the way he plays through the covers, and the drives he hits off full balls all stand out. He uses his feet really well and is a strong hitter straight down the ground,” Raina said.Cheteshwar Pujara also pointed out that Abhishek’s ability to score all around the wicket separates him from more conventional top-order players.“He is a really versatile player. Often, we have seen that top-order batters are dominant on the leg side. But Abhishek plays equally well on the off side as well and shows intent from the first ball itself, trying to hit a four or a six. He picks the length really well and has a huge variety of shots,” Pujara said.","Abhishek Sharma has emerged as the embodiment of the fearless, high-tempo style the team wants to take into next month’s ICC T20 World Cup, according to former India batting coach Sanjay Bangar.

Bangladesh cricket in turmoil: What it means for the T20 World Cup?

The Government of Karnataka’s Home Department has cleared the way for international and IPL cricket to return to the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium, granting formal permission to the Karnataka State Cricket Association to host marquee matches at the venue.The approval comes after a long period of uncertainty for the iconic Bengaluru stadium, which has not staged a major fixture since the tragic stampede during Royal Challengers Bengaluru’s IPL title celebrations last year. In the aftermath of the incident, the venue was effectively taken off the major cricketing calendar.Over the past few months, the BCCI had moved several high-profile events away from Chinnaswamy. The Duleep Trophy and the India–South Africa A series were shifted to the Board’s Centre of Excellence on the outskirts of the city. Even the ICC Women’s ODI World Cup 2025 matches originally scheduled at the stadium, including the final, were relocated.Administratively, the KSCA also went through a turbulent phase. The association operated without a treasurer and a secretary for months after both officials resigned, citing moral responsibility following the incident.The tragedy itself occurred on 4 June 2025, when a crowd crush outside the Chinnaswamy Stadium during RCB’s maiden IPL title celebrations led to the death of eleven people, with 56 others injured. Thousands of fans had gathered near the stadium for the team’s felicitation ceremony when the situation spiralled out of control.With government clearance now in place, the Chinnaswamy Stadium is set to gradually return to the international and IPL calendar, marking a significant step towards normalcy after one of the darkest chapters in its history.","The Government of Karnataka’s Home Department has cleared the way for international and IPL cricket to return to the M.

Vaibhav Sooryavanshi steadied the innings with calm assurance. He began to open up during the eighth over, smashing 15 runs off Iqbal Hossain Emon to push India to 42 for 2. The innings hit another speed bump when Vihaan Malhotra was dismissed for 7 in the 10th over by Md Azizul Hakim Tamim, leaving India 53 for 3 at the end of the powerplay.Sooryavanshi, however, continued to shine. In the 13th over, the 14-year-old brought up a stunning half-century off just 30 balls. At 14 years and 296 days, he became the youngest player in history to score a fifty at a Men’s U19 World Cup. India moved to 94 for 3 after 20 overs, with Sooryavanshi and Abhigyan Kundu building a vital partnership.The stand was broken in the 27th over when Iqbal Hossain Emon dismissed Suryavanshi for 72 off 67 balls, an innings laced with six fours and three sixes. The knock also saw him cross 1,000 runs in Youth ODIs, making him the seventh Indian to achieve the milestone.India’s middle order struggled for momentum after that. Harvansh Pangalia managed just 2 as the score slipped to 123 for 5. Kundu then took charge alongside Kanishk Chouhan, guiding India to 152 for 5 by the 33rd over. Chouhan’s fluent 28 ended in the 36th over, breaking a 54-run stand.Kundu reached his fifty off 82 balls as India crossed 180, but rain soon interrupted play, reducing the match to 49 overs per side.After the restart, wickets continued to fall. RS Ambrish was removed for 5 by Sheikh Paevez Jibon, before Al Fahad brought an end to Kundu’s resolute innings. Kundu scored a fighting 80 from 112 deliveries, with four fours and three sixes.India were eventually bowled out for 238 in 48.4 overs. Al Fahad was the standout for Bangladesh, finishing with an impressive five-wicket haul of 5 for 38 in 9.2 overs.

Bangladesh cricket in turmoil: What it means for the T20 World Cup?

A scintillating century partnership between Steve Smith and Babar Azam in Sydney Sixers’ BBL clash against Sydney Thunder at the SCG on Friday took a dramatic turn when Smith chose to deny a single to Babar during the key power surge. The decision briefly sparked visible frustration from Babar, but it ultimately paid dividends as the Sixers secured a five-wicket win.The incident occurred in the 11th over when Babar, on 47 off 38 balls, looked to take a single after three dot balls from Chris Green. Smith turned him down to retain the strike for the BBL’s two-over ‘floating’ powerplay, aimed at maximizing scoring potential. Babar appeared visibly upset during a brief mid-pitch interaction at the end of the over.Smith justified the decision with a record-smashing display in the power surge, hitting four consecutive sixes off Ryan Hadley in the first over—marking the most expensive over in BBL history. He finally took a single off the last ball to hand Babar the strike against Nathan McAndrew in the 13th over, but Babar was dismissed first ball, leaving the field visibly frustrated.Reflecting on the strategy, Smith told Channel 7, “We spoke at the ten-over mark, and they [the captain and coach] said take the surge straightaway.I was like, ‘Nah, give it one over. I want to hit to the short boundary. I don’t want to screw up the first over. I’ll try to get 30 off that over’. I think we got 32, so it was a good result. Not sure Babar was too happy with me knocking back that single.”Babar was not seen on the field after the match, though it was unclear if he later made an appearance. Mitchell Starc , making his first BBL appearance in 11 years, said he had not noticed the episode but explained that, like bowlers, batters often favour specific match-ups in T20 cricket.Despite the brief tension, the tactical move worked perfectly for the Sixers, with Smith going on to score a 41-ball century and lead his side to victory.","Sydney Sixers beat Sydney Thunder by five wickets in BBL clash at SCG.

- A step forward -

MADRID: Angry Real Madrid fans jeered their own team before they went on to beat Levante 2-0 in La Liga on Saturday to record new coach Alvaro Arbeloa's first win at the helm. Villarreal, third, stumbled to a 2-0 defeat at Real Betis, hampering their attempts at mounting a title challenge.Arbeloa's debut after replacing Xabi Alonso ended in a humiliating Copa del Rey defeat in midweek at second-tier Albacete, but second-half goals from Kylian Mbappe and Raul Asencio secured Madrid three vital points at a moody Santiago Bernabeu.Second-place Madrid cut the gap on leaders Barcelona to one point before the in-form Spanish champions visit Real Sociedad on Sunday.Star players Vinicius Junior and Jude Bellingham came in for ire from the home fans after a disastrous week. Mbappe also started but was spared the jeers.The French forward had been expected to return for the Champions League game against Monaco next week as he manages his recovery from a knee sprain.""I've always respected the Bernabeu (crowd), they whistled me a lot too (as a player), and it's one of the aspects that make this club so great, how demanding the fans are,"" said Arbeloa, defending the right of the fans to express themselves.It was Arbeloa's 43rd birthday and he was eventually able to celebrate with a victory, although his team lacked energy and spark in the first half.That was not the case in the stands as a significant part of the crowd harangued their own team, in response to a wild week at the club.Los Blancos lost the Spanish Super Cup final to rivals Barcelona in Saudi Arabia on Sunday, parted ways with Alonso on Monday and then crashed out of the cup on Wednesday.Some fans also chanted for president Florentino Perez to resign in a sour atmosphere in the Spanish capital.Mbappe had the best chance of a flat first half against the team in 19th in La Liga. Reaching a long ball the French superstar met it with a volley that flew wide of the post.Home fans jeered their side in at the break and Madrid emerged for the second half with more impetus, with Arbeloa bringing on Franco Mastantuono and Arda Guler.Mbappe drew a foul in the area from Adrian de la Fuente to earn a penalty, which he dispatched for his 19th league goal of the campaign.Mbappe has scored 50 goals in 53 La Liga games, taking only a little longer than Real Madrid's all-time top goalscorer Cristiano Ronaldo to reach the milestone.The Portuguese managed it in 51 appearances.Asencio doubled Madrid's advantage with a header into the top corner from Guler's corner as the hosts took control.Bellingham came close to adding a third but Mathew Ryan parried his header and then saved Vinicius's effort after a darting run from the Brazilian.Ryan thwarted Bellingham again as tensions calmed by the end, with the crowd temporarily sated by the victory. Unless Madrid can build on it, the jeers and whistles will return.""Today was a very important day, playing in front of our fans, we wanted to turn around the situation,"" Asencio told Real Madrid TV.""What happened at Albacete should not have happened, we felt guilty and we wanted to make things better.""Elsewhere, Vedat Muriqi scored a hat-trick for Mallorca in a 3-2 win over Athletic Bilbao, before Villarreal fell to defeat at La Cartuja.Aitor Ruibal and Pablo Fornals's second-half goals helped Betis earn an impressive victory over Marcelino Garcia Toral's visitors.The loss leaves Villarreal eight points behind leaders Barcelona and damaged their chances of competing for a first-ever La Liga title.Betis had more of the ball in an otherwise even first half before Ruibal volleyed them ahead after 57 minutes.Santi Comesana's red card for a rash challenge on Giovani Lo Celso made Villarreal's job harder and Fornals killed the game by drilling home with precision from outside the area with seven minutes remaining.""It was a hard-fought game, the details led to Betis winning, I think a draw would have been fairest,"" Villarreal midfielder Dani Parejo told Movistar.""We lacked the finishing touch but had some clear chances... I think the team showed up well, but in both boxes we weren't quite good enough.""","Real Madrid beat Levante 2-0 in La Liga on Saturday to record new coach Alvaro Arbeloa's first win at the helm. Second-half goals from Kylian Mbappe and Raul Asencio secured Madrid three vital points at a moody Santiago Bernabeu.

Indian women’s football stalwart Ashalata Devi says the dream of seeing the country play at the FIFA Women’s World Cup remains alive, but stressed that sustained progress at the grassroots level is crucial to bridge the gap with the world’s elite.“Our dream of the World Cup is still alive. We still have to work even harder at this time,” Ashalata told PTI.The veteran defender pointed out that all three national teams -- Under-17, Under-19 and the senior side -- have qualified for their respective AFC Asian Championships, making 2026 a potentially defining year for the women’s game in India.“Under-17, Under-19 and the senior team have already qualified for AFC (competitions). If we do well there, obviously our dream of the World Cup is still alive,” she said.One of the most capped players in Indian women’s football history, Ashalata -- who has earned over 100 international caps and captained the national side on multiple occasions -- said the (senior) team has made steady progress but is still short of world-class standards.“We have been doing better for a long time, but still according to world-class levels, we are not there yet.Still, we are trying a lot,” she said.“I have so much faith in the players. Their passion, hard work and dedication — they have been working for so many years. I really hope this time we qualify for the World Cup and do better for Indian women’s football.”Having spent more than a decade anchoring India’s defence, Ashalata identified grassroots development as the biggest area needing immediate attention.“The problem is that we skip the basics and go straight to the technical aspects,” she said.“In my time, I started playing football at the age of 13. Now many players start at 10 or 11. But if we start at five or six years, learning becomes much better.”She emphasised that skill acquisition becomes increasingly difficult with age.“After 17 or 18 years, teaching skills like ball control becomes very difficult. By then, players play more by expression than learning. That’s why grassroots football is very important,” she added.While acknowledging the role of the All India Football Federation (AIFF), the senior pro said responsibility must also lie with state associations.“AIFF has a big role, but every state has its own association. They must show interest and take initiative. Everything cannot be done only at the top level,” Ashalata said, adding that consistency at the state level is essential to create a sustainable pipeline of talent.Off the field, Ashalata has already begun planning her contribution to the game beyond her playing career through the Ashalata Devi Football Festival (ADFF), which she started along with fellow India international Aditi Chauhan in Imphal.“I never knew what I would do after retirement other than football. I still feel connected to football and I wanted to do something for it,” she said.Drawing from her own experiences, Ashalata said the Festival aims to ensure young players do not have to choose between football and education.“When I was young, I couldn’t manage football and school together because there was no academy near my house. I don’t want the next generation to face what I struggled with,” she said.The initiative, which focuses on combining football training with education, has already exceeded expectations.“I planned for around 50 players, but almost 47–48 kids came. I never expected such a response, and I’m really happy,” Ashalata signed off.","Ashalata Devi is one of the most capped players in Indian women’s football history. The veteran defender has earned over 100 international caps and captained the national side on multiple occasions. All three national teams -- Under-17, Under-19 and the senior side -- have qualified for their respective AFC Asian Championships.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126614242,imgsize-24626,width-400,resizemode-4/ashalata-devi-pti-photo.jpg"

Once your body and mind adjust, you see how great it is and what a pleasure to play for this club. So far, I've really liked it.""“Premier League is on another level. Everything is way faster; you must be perfect every second, no time to think twice. Plus, everyone is very physical.""“The transition is big, so body and mind need time to adapt to the speed.It takes a couple of weeks or months.""“The work I've put in, plus teammates now understand my movements and effort on chances. Hard work always pays off—this shows in my last two games with 2-3 goals.""“It's true—scoring sparks confidence instantly. For me, the key is helping the team now; team success is everything. I want us to win together, contributing goals to secure victories.""“That moment was crucial—I positioned to score. Video shows it looked pre-planned, but it flowed naturally. Hard work off the pitch on positioning pays off in those key moments.""""He's a legend here who knows the club inside out. I like him as a person and coach—this week's training has been excellent, leaving us well-prepared. Everyone's enjoying it and looking forward.""""I sense his energy and the knowledge he instils in us—he's highly detailed, which I love. We'll get along great as a team. Looking forward to working with him.""""I'm really looking forward to it—this derby means so much to fans and is special by name alone. We're prepared, believe we can play well, stay organised, and give our best.""""It'd be massive to beat them—they've dominated for a decade, but it won't be easy. We must stay focused and detail-oriented; one lapse means conceding. Everyone needs to be 100 percent.""","Benjamin Sesko speaks exclusively to JioHotstar ahead of Manchester derby.

AIFF to control both ISL, I-League



AIFF retains control in ISL functioning



I-League clubs have more say



ISL clubs not fully behind proposed structure



Poll Do you think AIFF should have more control over the Indian Super League (ISL)? Yes, more control is necessary No, clubs should have more say

I-League proposed to begin on February 19



The All India Football Federation (AIFF) proposed a participation framework structure for both the top-tier Indian Super League (ISL) and the second-division I-League over the past couple of days. While these are still proposals and have not yet been approved by the clubs concerned, they differ in how much control the AIFF wants to exercise over the two tiers of Indian football.In both proposed frameworks, clubs and commercial partners have representation. However, the stark difference lies in the level of control afforded.In the proposed ISL framework, the AIFF has retained final authority and veto power on key decisions, which is not the case in the I-League proposal.The AIFF has proposed two bodies for the ISL, one Governing Council and another to run day-to-day operations.The Governing Council will comprise the AIFF President or Secretary General, AIFF Vice President, AIFF Treasurer, one representative from each club, three representatives from the rights partner or broadcaster, for which a request for proposal is yet to be floated, and two independent members.The Management Committee will be responsible for the league’s day-to-day operations.It will include the AIFF Secretary General, the AIFF Head of Competitions, the AIFF Head of Strategy, five club representatives and three rights partner representatives.While the ISL Governing Council is expected to convene infrequently, the AIFF has effectively retained control. All decisions require a simple majority, but at least two affirmative votes must come from AIFF representatives. As a result, AIFF officials will largely determine outcomes.Revenue sharing, prize money allocation, significant budget alterations, broadcast or commercial rights matters, long-term agreements and contracts above Rs 1 crore will all require the AIFF’s affirmative vote.Even though the AIFF will fully own and operate the I-League, the clubs will collectively be responsible for commercial and operational decisions.As with the ISL structure, the AIFF will have a say in matters pertaining to sporting integrity, regulatory compliance and disciplinary jurisdiction. However, the AIFF has chosen not to exercise veto powers in matters relating to broadcast rights, digital or media rights, sponsorships, marketing, branding or commercial exploitation.Not all ISL clubs are satisfied with the current proposal shared by the AIFF. One official, who chose to remain anonymous, noted that the structure is not new and had previously been discussed under Football Sports Development Limited (FSDL). The official added that the limited influence afforded to the commercial partner could once again prove to be a hurdle when the AIFF invites bidders.Another ISL club official offered a different perspective, comparing the current proposal to the FSDL era, when clubs had little say in most governance matters.On Friday, the AIFF also informed I-League clubs about the proposed schedule for the second division of Indian football. The 11-team league is expected to begin on February 19 and run for 80 days.The I-League will be played in a home-and-away format, with five home and five away matches for all teams. In a reminder of the COVID-affected 2020-21 season, the top six teams will progress to the playoffs, while the bottom five will fight to avoid relegation.","The All India Football Federation (AIFF) proposed a participation framework structure for both the top-tier Indian Super League (ISL) and the second- division I-League over the past couple of days.

NEW DELHI: All the players of FC Goa , including India's national team captain Sandesh Jhingan, along with all the support staff, have accepted a cut in their salaries for the short ISL season of 2025-26, which commences from February 14. A statement made by the club said that it was indeed an act of selflessness in which Indian football is going through so many fluctuations.Posting on X late Thursday, FC Goa said it had held “honest and difficult conversations” with its players as well as staff about some of the challenges presently being faced by the league, as well as itself. It added that the first-team players and technical staff voluntarily agreed to reduce their remuneration, underlining the unity within the squad during a difficult period.“In a moment of real uncertainty for Indian football, our club had honest and difficult conversations about the challenges we are facing. What followed was something that made us incredibly proud,” the club wrote.The club expressed that they were very grateful for this gesture and that this decision had been anything but easy. FC Goa also expressed that this gesture embodied the character and collective spirit that the group has, as the club is more than what transpires on the pitch.It is more than mere performances and achievements. Apart from Jhingan, the squad also consists of India internationals such as Udanta Singh and Boris Singh.This comes against the backdrop of ISL clubs still struggling financially due to the impact of the termination of the Master Rights Agreement (MRA) between the All India Football Federation (AIFF) and its former commercial partner Football Sports Development Limited (FSDL) in the month of December. This led to the league being subjected to a waiting period of nearly six months.After the intervention of the sports minister, Mansukh Mandaviya , and a series of negotiations with the teams, all 14 ISL clubs are now confirmed to participate in the season with an aggregated 91 matches to be played in the home and away format with each team set to play a total of 13 matches.In the new format, the clubs will together shoulder 60% of the operating expenses of the league, pegged at Rs 25 crore. At the same time, the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) has waived the mandatory match eligibility criterion to qualify for the AFC Champions League 2, though the ISL league champions no longer qualify automatically for the group stage. Since they won the Super Cup, FC Goa will qualify for the AFC Champions League 2.",All the players of FC Goa have accepted a cut in their salaries for the short ISL season of 2025-26.

Carrick meets challenge 'head on'

Jobs on the line

Can Arsenal fell Forest?

MANCHESTER: Michael Carrick has the chance to make a fine first impression to his short-term stint as Manchester United manager by derailing local rivals Manchester City's Premier League title challenge on Saturday.City, meanwhile, have the chance to cut the gap on leaders Arsenal to three points at Old Trafford, while United need the points to boost their chances of Champions League football next season.At the other end of the table, Tottenham's Thomas Frank and West Ham boss Nuno Espirito Santo are fighting to save their jobs as the sides clash in a London derby.AFP Sport looks at three talking points ahead of the weekend action:Carrick faces a baptism of fire with the Premier League's top two the opponents for his first two matches in charge of United.""It's what we live for (big games) - some are more challenging than others but it's why we are here. So we'll go for it head on,"" said Carrick.Before a daunting trip to Arsenal next weekend, the former United and England midfielder has the chance to galvanise a season at risk of coming completely off the rails.An FA Cup exit to Brighton last weekend followed a run of just one win in six league games for United either side of Ruben Amorim's dismissal.The Red Devils, however, remain well in contention for a place in next season's Champions League, just three points adrift of fourth-placed Liverpool.Carrick was unbeaten in a previous three-game interim spell at United after the departure of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer in 2021.Since then he gained far more managerial experience at second-tier Middlesbrough, but was sacked in June for failing to achieve promotion to the Premier League.""I understand the job, what it entails and the responsibility of it,"" added Carrick. ""Now I feel in a strong place to move forward and, hopefully, be successful here.""Both Frank and Nuno have defied speculation over their futures to remain in charge for Saturday's clash at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.Spurs have won just four of their last 17 games in all competitions to slip to 14th in the Premier League and bow out of both domestic cups.Frank is on the brink of joining a long list of managers who have failed to make the grade in north London, including Nuno, who lasted just 17 games as Tottenham boss in 2021.The Portuguese coach, already sacked once this season by Nottingham Forest, has managed just two wins in 16 Premier League games since joining the Hammers in September.West Ham desperately need a quick upturn in results as they sit seven points adrift of safety in 18th place,Top of both the Premier League and Champions League, the Gunners are on course for an unprecedented quadruple after FA and League Cup victories this week.But Mikel Arteta's men must overcome a poor record at the City Ground against a Forest side keen to make amends to their furious manager.Arsenal have won in just one of their last five visits to Nottingham.Forest were dumped out of the FA Cup by second-tier Wrexham on penalties last weekend, sparking an outburst from Sean Dyche.""It's unacceptable to me, but it's unacceptable to the badge as well,"" he said of his side's first-half performance left them battling back from 2-0 down before drawing 3-3.Fixtures (all times GMT)SaturdayManchester United v Manchester City (1230), Sunderland v Crystal Palace, Tottenham v West Ham, Liverpool v Burnley, Leeds v Fulham, Chelsea v Brentford (all 1500), Nottingham Forest v Arsenal (1730)SundayWolves v Newcastle (1400), Aston Villa v Everton (1630)MondayBrighton v Bournemouth (2000)",Michael Carrick takes charge of Manchester United for the first time on Saturday.

BARCELONA: Ferran Torres and Lamine Yamal fired Barcelona to a 2-0 win over Racing Santander and into the Copa del Rey quarter-finals on Thursday.The Spanish internationals' strikes helped holders Barca defeat second division leaders Racing to progress from a surprisingly tight last 16 clash and record an 11th consecutive victory across all competitions.The hosts had two goals disallowed for offside and record 32-time winners Barca did just enough to claim victory.""We didn't think they would be so hard to break down,"" admitted Torres to Movistar.""We knew that we had to stretch the game, be calm and in the end it went well.""Having seen Real Madrid eliminated at second-tier Albacete on Wednesday Barca coach Hansi Flick named a fairly strong side, including teenage star Yamal.After a 15 minute delay with some fans stuck outside, the match kicked off at Racing's Sardinero stadium, and Barca quickly took control of the ball.The Catalans struggled to turn possession into a meaningful opening though, and when they finally did Dani Olmo missed his kick from Marcus Rashford's dangerous cross.Racing looked to breach Barcelona's high defensive line but when they did get in behind the visitors managed to mop up well.Giorgi Guliashvili's low effort from range was fielded comfortably by Joan Garcia, and that was as close as the hosts came.Barcelona continued to push forward in the second half and Rashford had a shot tipped away and also drilled narrowly wide.Eventually the Spanish champions took the lead through Torres, after Fermin Lopez sent him through on goal. The Spain international rounded Racing goalkeeper Jokin Ezkieta and rolled home.The hosts were forced on the offensive and twice had the ball in Barcelona's net, but both of Manex Lozano's goals were ruled out for offside.Barca goalkeeper Garcia made a superb save to thwart Lozano one-on-one deep in stoppage time and avoid the game going to extra-time.Barca wrapped up their win with the last kick of the match, Yamal tapping in Raphinha's cross at the back post.""We played the game we had to play, we played a 10 out of 10 match, (with) two offside goals and the chance at the end... it's okay, it's football,"" said Racing defender Alvaro Mantilla.Elsewhere Valencia won 2-0 at Burgos to reach the last eight.",Barcelona beat Racing Santander 2-0 in Copa del Rey last 16.

NEW DELHI: The All India Football Federation (AIFF) said on Thursday that the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) has recognised the shortened 2025–26 Indian Super League (ISL) season, with clubs from India eligible only for indirect entry into the AFC Champions League 2 through zonal qualifiers.Because of the delayed start to the season, Indian clubs will not be able to complete the mandatory 24 matches — across the top-tier league and domestic cup — required for direct entry into AFC club competitions.Most clubs are expected to play a total of 16 matches during the season, including at least three games in the AIFF Super Cup and 13 matches in the ISL.""With the exception of any additional slot(s) allocated to a Member Association in accordance with Articles 3.4 and 3.5, Member Associations that fail to fulfil the Member Association Eligibility Criteria shall, subject to Article 4.4, be eligible to be allocated only indirect slots for the relevant AFC Club Competition,"" the AFC said in a letter to the AIFF dated January 15.""In such cases, the number of direct slots for the relevant Member Association(s) in the relevant AFC Club Competition shall be wholly converted into indirect slots (e.g. 2+1 becomes 0+3),"" Shin Man Gil, the AFC’s deputy general secretary, competitions and football, said in the letter.The 2025–26 ISL season is scheduled to begin on February 14, with all 14 clubs confirming their participation earlier this week.A total of 91 matches will be played in the curtailed season, with each team playing 13 single-leg matches against the other teams.""In light of the foregoing, kindly be informed that, should the 2025/26 ISL s season be organised as proposed in your letter, Article 4.3 of the Entry Regulations shall apply for the purposes of entry into the relevant AFC club competitions,"" the AFC letter stated.Earlier, ISL clubs had asked the AIFF to approach the AFC for a one-time relaxation of the 24-match requirement to allow direct entry into the ACL 2.Following the clubs’ request, AIFF deputy secretary general M Satyanarayan wrote to the AFC seeking a one-time exemption.""In light of the exceptional circumstances impacting Indian football this season, we respectfully request that your esteemed office grant the AIFF and the clubs participating in the ISL, a one-time exemption from the minimum requirements set forth in the AFC Regulations.""""Specifically, we request that a minimum of sixteen (16) matches be deemed sufficient for clubs participating in the ISL to qualify for direct entry into club competitions organized by the AFC, and the ISL season scheduled to take place between 14 February 2026 and […] along with the Super Cup held between 25 October 2025 and 7 December 2025, be considered to be sufficient for the purposes of maintaining direct entry slots in the relevant club competitions organized by AFC. """"Such an exemption would significantly support the AIFF's efforts to restart the league, serve as an important encouragement to the clubs during this challenging period for all stakeholders in Indian football,"" Satyanarayan added.Last Saturday, the AIFF asked clubs to submit details of their proposed home venues so that fixtures could be prepared and broadcast and commercial partners finalised.The ISL 2025–26 season had remained uncertain since July, after the AIFF’s commercial partner Football Sports Development Limited (FSDL), owned by the Reliance Group, put the league on hold amid uncertainty over the Master Rights Agreement (MRA).The MRA expired on December 8, 2025, after negotiations between the two sides failed.",The Asian Football Confederation has recognised the shortened 2025–26 Indian Super League (ISL) season.

NFL hands down final discipline to Steelers offense as Aaron Rodgers weighs his future in Pittsburgh after playoff collapse,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/nfl-hands-down-final-discipline-to-steelers-offense-as-aaron-rodgers-weighs-his-future-in-pittsburgh-after-playoff-collapse/articleshow/126636204.cms,"Aaron Rodgers (via Getty Images)

Why this discipline matters as Pittsburgh begins reshaping its future

The Pittsburgh Steelers entered the postseason hoping to prove they were closer to contention than was expected of them. Instead, their 30–6 Wild Card loss to the Houston Texans turned into a pivotal moment for the franchise. As the NFL closed the book on the playoff matchup, it issued its final punishment from the game. At the same time, uncertainty continued to swirl around quarterback Aaron Rodgers , whose future in Pittsburgh now appears far from settled.The NFL’s discipline, though minor on the surface, added to the sense that nothing went smoothly for the Steelers in their last game of the season. Wide receiver and special teams standout Ben Skowronek was fined $9,500 for unsportsmanlike conduct after an early first-quarter incident on a kickoff. The league included him in its weekly Gameday Accountability Report, making him the only player from the matchup to be penalized.The fine stemmed from a moment involving Texans rookie Jaylin Noel, when Skowronek crossed a line following a routine tackle. While the action cost him financially, it did not erase what was otherwise a strong season. Skowronek quietly became one of Pittsburgh’s most reliable special teams contributors, logging heavy snaps in coverage units and earning his first Pro Bowl selection.If Skowronek chooses to challenge the punishment, the NFL has made it clear about its process. It stated, “Cases are heard by appeals officers and former NFL players Derrick Brooks, Ramon Foster, or Jordy Nelson, who are jointly appointed and paid by the NFL/NFLPA. The decisions made are final and binding.”The larger story, however, sits at quarterback and on the sideline. Mike Tomlin’s departure after 19 seasons signaled a reset that few expected so abruptly. That decision may directly impact Aaron Rodgers. According to league insider Ian Rapoport, Rodgers’ interest in Pittsburgh was closely tied to playing under Tomlin.With that relationship gone, expectations are that Rodgers will either explore new opportunities or consider stepping away from the game. For the Steelers, the coming months and the changes they bring will define the team’s identity as it evolves from a season that did not go as planned.","Pittsburgh Steelers wide receiver Ben Skowronek was fined $9,500 for unsportsmanlike conduct.

Bo Nix’s dream playoff run ends in heartbreak as shocking ankle injury rules Broncos QB out for season



Bo Nix dazzled fans with a masterful performance in the AFC divisional playoff, only to leave the field with a heartbreaking injury that will sideline him for the rest of the postseason. The Denver Broncos edged the Buffalo Bills 33-30 in overtime, but Nix’s fractured right ankle stole the spotlight. Head coach Sean Payton confirmed the devastating news in his postgame press conference, revealing that Nix will undergo surgery Tuesday and miss the remainder of the playoffs.The injury occurred on the third-to-last play of overtime when Nix, executing a designed run, was tackled by Cole Bishop for a two-yard loss. Despite the setback, he stayed in the game long enough to set up the game-winning field goal. Nix threw an incomplete deep pass to Marvin Mims Jr., which drew a 39-yard pass interference penalty against Tre'Davious White. On the final snap, Nix kneeled, allowing Wil Lutz to drill a 23-yard field goal and secure Denver’s first playoff victory since Super Bowl 50.Before the injury, Nix delivered a performance that showcased his poise and versatility.He completed 26 of 46 passes for 279 yards, three touchdowns, and one interception, while also rushing for 29 yards on 12 carries. At just 25, Nix is already establishing himself as one of the league’s clutch quarterbacks, finishing the regular season with 25 touchdown passes, 11 interceptions, and leading the NFL in game-winning drives with seven.While Nix’s absence will be felt, the Broncos remain poised under backup quarterback Jarrett Stidham, who will start in the AFC Championship Game. Denver now faces the winner of the Texans-Patriots matchup, aiming for its first AFC title since 2015.

Joe Burrow’s net worth and salary

Travis Kelce’s net worth and salary

Who comes out on top?

Joe Burrow and Travis Kelce are two of the best players in the NFL, and both made their money in different ways. One is a franchise quarterback who signed a deal that broke records, while the other is a veteran tight end who has done a lot more than simply play football. Let's examine more closely at how much money they have in 2025.Celebrity Net Worth states that Joe Burrow is worth about $50 million. The Cincinnati Bengals quarterback's pay has gone up a lot in the last two years, mostly because he signed a huge contract deal.In September 2023, He signed a five-year, $275 million deal with the Bengals which included over $219 million guaranteed. The contract pays him an average of $55 million per year, making him one of the highest-paid players in NFL history.He has said that he plans to save most of his NFL salary and live mainly off his endorsement income. This makes his financial approach very different from many other athletes.He also makes good money from endorsement deals with big brands like Nike, Bose, and Pepsi. His endorsement revenue is lower than that of other NFL stars, but it is projected to go up as his career goes on.Celebrity Net Worth states that Travis Kelce is worth about $90 million, which is a lot more than Burrow's.The Kansas City Chiefs tight end has been in the NFL for a long time and has made money in many different ways over the years.He has earned over $100 million in NFL salary during his career. His most recent contract extension of $34.25 million, signed in 2024, pays him around $17 million per year. While this is far less than top quarterbacks, Kelce has made up the difference off the field.The ""New Heights"" podcast that Kelce does with his brother Jason Kelce is one of the things that adds up the most to his wealth . The podcast inked a $100 million agreement with Amazon's Wondery in 2024, which instantly made him richer.He also makes over $5 million a year from endorsements, working with companies like State Farm, Bud Light, Nike, McDonald's, and Pfizer. Since his connection with music diva Taylor Swift became public, he has become even more well-known.Travis Kelce is a lot richer than Joe Burrow right now. This is primarily because he has been in the NFL longer and has done well in businesses outside of sports. But Burrow has a big deal, so his net worth might possibly increase quickly in the following few years. If he stays healthy and gets another big deal, the gap between the two might get narrower.For now, Kelce has the most money, but Burrow is set to have the most money in the long run.","Travis Kelce and Joe Burrow are two of the best players in the NFL.

What was Chad Johnson’s net worth in 2025?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/what-was-chad-johnsons-net-worth-in-2025/articleshow/126625991.cms,"Image via Getty

Chad Johnson’s net worth

Ocho Cinco proves Networth vs. Bank account $15 Million??

How did Chad Johnson build his fortune?

Former NFL wide receiver Chad Johnson who is widely known by his nickname Ochocinco has remained a popular and talked-about figure in American sports even years after his retirement. He built a long NFL career and later stayed in the public eye through media work and business ventures. Here is a complete breakdown of his net worth:According to Celebrity Net Worth, Chad Johnson’s estimated net worth is around $15 million. While this figure is far lower than what some modern NFL stars earn, it still reflects a successful playing career combined with post-retirement income.Johnson made nearly $48 million in pay over his 12 years in the NFL. But his net worth isn't the same as those earnings because he had to pay for things like child support, living costs, legal fees, and times when his income dropped after football.At one point in 2013, Johnson publicly claimed his assets were worth closer to $5 million during a legal filing. Years later, he stated on podcasts and interviews that his financial situation had stabilized and improved. By 2025, his net worth was widely estimated at $15 million, supported by continued media appearances and strong financial planning.The Cincinnati Bengals picked Chad Johnson in the 2001 NFL Draft. He immediately rose to the top of the league's wide receivers. He participated in six Pro Bowls and signed several contracts that paid him millions of dollars a year. From 2003 to 2009, he made the most money as one of the Bengals' highest-paid players.He made money by negotiating endorsement deals with companies like Reebok, GoDaddy, and Degree Men, in addition to his NFL income. Fans liked him because of his bold personality, but a few sponsorship agreements ended early because of problems off the field.After retiring from football, he stayed active in entertainment and sports media. He appeared on reality TV shows, competed on Dancing With the Stars, and later became a regular voice on football podcasts and sports panels.He has also earned money through boxing exhibitions, soccer appearances, streaming, and brand partnerships. While none of these matched his NFL paydays, they helped him remain financially relevant after retirement.Chad Johnson's net worth in 2025 shows the highs and lows of a long career in athletics. He didn't get to keep all of his NFL money, but he's made sensible choices and worked hard to stay financially stable.","Former NFL wide receiver Chad Johnson is widely known by his nickname Ochocinco.

Broncos’ cheeky Hailee Steinfeld post goes viral while Josh Allen's Super Bowl dream shattered again,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/broncos-cheeky-hailee-steinfeld-post-goes-viral-while-josh-allens-super-bowl-dream-shattered-again/articleshow/126635374.cms,"Broncos vs Bills (Getty Images)

Viral Hailee Steinfeld photo turns heads as Broncos cleverly troll Josh Allen during heated Bills showdown



What began as a routine buildup to a high stakes divisional round matchup quickly turned personal, playful, and loud. Hours before kickoff at Mile High Stadium, Bills fans discovered an old photo of Hailee Steinfeld wearing Denver Broncos gear during Super Bowl 50 in 2016. The image resurfaced at the worst possible time for Buffalo, and Broncos fans wasted no time turning it into fuel.The timing made it irresistible. With Josh Allen leading Buffalo into enemy territory, the decade old image suddenly felt fresh again. Broncos supporters flooded social media, printed signs, and leaned fully into the moment. The stadium followed suit, flashing the photo on the jumbotron in what felt like a coordinated jab designed to rattle the visiting quarterback.One fan went viral for holding a sign of the photo, and the Broncos made sure the message landed. Cameras caught the image looping across the massive screen, sending roars through the crowd. The moment was lighthearted, but calculated. Denver knew exactly what it was doing.CBS Sports reporter Tracy Wolfson later asked Allen about the photo and its sudden resurgence. His response showed no frustration, only amusement.""Asked Josh about this pic and he told me he had no idea it was floating around,"" the CBS Sports reporter shared.""Laughed and said she was probably paid to be there. And that he definitely wasn’t going to bring it up at home.""Allen handled it with ease, brushing off the noise as a harmless distraction. Steinfeld, who went public with Allen in July 2024 and married him later that year, has never claimed allegiance to Denver. Last month, the couple announced they are expecting their first child, making the moment feel even more distant and irrelevant.Still, the Broncos leaned into the fun. Whether Steinfeld was a Broncos fan for one night or simply enjoying Super Bowl history remains unclear. What is clear is where her loyalty stands now.The trolling faded once the football took over. Denver edged Buffalo 33-30 in overtime in a classic playoff battle, punching its ticket to the AFC Championship Game. The win ensured another week of football in Denver, with the winner of the Texans Patriots matchup coming to town for a Super Bowl LX berth.The joke landed. The result mattered more.","Bills fans discovered an old photo of Hailee Steinfeld wearing Denver Broncos gear during Super Bowl 50 in 2016.

NFL playoff overtime rules explained



NFL playoff overtime rules are shaping the drama of this postseason, and they matter more than ever as the road to Super Bowl 60 tightens. January football often lives on thin margins, where one kick or one stop can tilt a season. This year’s bracket opened with 14 teams and five weeks of pressure, and it did not take long for extra football to arrive.The divisional round delivered the first overtime moment of the 2025 playoffs when the Buffalo Bills pushed past regulation against the Denver Broncos on a late Matt Prater field goal. It was a reminder that playoff games do not always fit neatly into four quarters. In fact, this marked the sixth postseason overtime game in the last six seasons, a trend that reflects both parity and rising stakes.Playoff overtime looks familiar, but key differences separate it from the regular season. Once regulation ends tied, a new coin toss sets the stage. The overtime period runs 15 minutes, longer than the 10-minute window used from September through December. Each team keeps three timeouts per half, even if the game stretches into a second overtime.The most important change is possession fairness. Both teams are guaranteed at least one offensive drive.A touchdown on the opening possession no longer ends the game. If the first team scores seven, the opponent still gets the ball with a chance to match. Extra points are not attempted when a touchdown ends the contest.If the coin toss winner comes away with only a field goal, the door stays wide open. The opposing team can win outright with a touchdown on its drive. If it settles for three, the game moves into sudden death, where the next score decides everything. A rare exception exists if the first team commits a safety, which hands an immediate win to the other side.These rules grew out of a controversial ending in the 2021 postseason, when Buffalo never touched the ball against Kansas City. That finish sparked debate and pushed the league to act. Today’s format ensures balance and rewards complete team play on both sides of the ball.Strategy has evolved as well. The coin toss winner often chooses to receive, but deferring is now a real option. Playing defense first allows a team to know exactly what it needs on offense. In January, clarity can be as valuable as talent. As the playoffs roll on, overtime is no longer a coin flip. It is a calculated test of nerve, preparation, and execution.","NFL playoff overtime rules are shaping the drama of this postseason.

"Aaron Rodgers will not return to the Steelers following playoff collapse, per insider",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/aaron-rodgers-will-not-return-to-the-steelers-following-playoff-collapse-per-insider/articleshow/126630305.cms,"Aaron Rodgers will not return to the Pittsburgh Steelers for the 2026 season, according to an NFL insider, just days after Mike Tomlin’s departure. Rodgers’ lone year ended in a wild-card loss despite an AFC North title. At 42, his future remains uncertain, with retirement still a real possibility as free agency approaches.

Aaron Rodgers’ Pittsburgh chapter closes as retirement question lingers

The end came quietly, without a press conference or dramatic farewell. Four days after Pittsburgh Steelers moved on from longtime head coach Mike Tomlin, clarity finally arrived around the franchise’s most debated question. Aaron Rodgers will not be back in Pittsburgh for the 2026 season.The decision follows a year filled with patience, uncertainty, and brief optimism. Rodgers arrived late, carried high expectations, and delivered moments of control but not the ending the Steelers hoped for. Now, with free agency approaching and silence from the quarterback himself, the focus shifts from what was promised to what truly remains.NFL insider Ian Rapoport removed any remaining doubt when he reported that fans have ""seen the last"" of Aaron Rodgers in Pittsburgh. The comment landed just days after the Steelers’ playoff run ended with a decisive wild-card loss to the Houston Texans. While the team captured the AFC North title, the postseason collapse left little momentum to build upon.Rodgers’ lone season offered balance but not brilliance. He led efficiently across the regular season, protected the ball, and guided the offense through long stretches of stability. When the moment demanded more, especially in January, the answers were harder to find.Pressure arrived early, protection broke down, and the game slipped away.What remains unclear is whether this departure marks a final goodbye to football. Rodgers has often hinted that time is no longer on his side. At 42, and after 21 seasons in the league, the wear shows even when the arm strength still flashes. His résumé speaks for itself. Eighteen seasons with the Green Bay Packers, a Super Bowl title, and four MVP awards. Two seasons with the New York Jets. One brief stop in Pittsburgh.For now, there is no announcement, no timeline, and no promise. Only separation. The Steelers turn the page, and Rodgers stands at another crossroads, deciding whether the silence ahead is temporary or permanent.","NFL insider Ian Rapoport says Aaron Rodgers will not return to the Pittsburgh Steelers for the 2026 season.

“It’s hard for me”: Cardi B opens up about loyalty and shyness as Stefon Diggs faces his own spotlight pressures,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/its-hard-for-me-cardi-b-opens-up-about-loyalty-and-shyness-as-stefon-diggs-faces-his-own-spotlight-pressures/articleshow/126630169.cms,"Rapper Cardi B prioritizes loyalty over fame, revealing her reluctance to form close friendships with fellow celebrities. She fears disappointment and losing admiration, preferring to maintain distance to protect her personal world. Despite initial shyness, she learned that breaking the ice can lead to positive connections, as seen with Megan Thee Stallion.

Why loyalty matters more than fame for Cardi B

Popularity usually implies open doors, unlimited offers, and making contacts without trying. In the case of Stefon Diggs' ladylove Cardi B, it has generated the reverse instinct. Her professional life is flourishing thanks to the charisma and absence of reticence, but she keeps her personal world closed. She has discovered that, celebrity groups do not necessarily operate in the same way she was brought up as far as allegiance and fidelity are concerned.And that is what has made her navigate the industry. Cardi does not pursue celebrity friendships or joint publicity occasions. Rather, she defends herself by keeping distance instead of disappointment. Her thoughts are a unique perspective on how emotional self-preservation may be more important than access even in the most famous place.In a conversation with Mariah Carey for Interview Magazine, Cardi explained the fear that holds her back from forming close ties with other stars.“I don’t want to get close to a celebrity and feel like we have a connection, and then out of nowhere they do some funny s*** and disappoint me,” she said.“I’ve always had the same friends. I’m very loyal. If I’m your friend, I’m going to always ride hard for you. But if you don’t ride hard for me or you do some funny s***, I’m going to feel a certain type of way.”She went further, pointing out how fame reshapes relationships. “It’s hard for me to put that in my head because growing up, loyalty was really big,” she said. “But celebrities aren’t like that, and that’s something that you have to find out on your own.”There is also the risk of meeting someone she admires and losing that admiration. “That’s why I stay away from people,” she said. “My fans want me to interact with more artists, but if I love their music, I don’t want to meet them because I don’t want to hate them. I’d rather just not know them at all and love them than meet them and be like, ‘Oh my gosh, this person’s a weirdo.’”Despite that hesitation, Cardi has learned that growth sometimes requires facing discomfort. She once avoided Megan Thee Stallion out of pure shyness. “Megan came out and for like a whole year, I never interacted with her because I was like, I don’t know. I’m too shy and everything,” she said, per E! News.When they finally connected, the fear faded. “It’s always about breaking the ice and always having a conversation and catching somebody at the right time,” she said. “We linked up and she’s just such a good vibe.”","Rapper Cardi B reveals her reluctance to form close friendships with fellow celebrities.

Hailee Steinfeld shares how Bills playoff nerves followed her to the Golden Globes

Playoff football does not pause for Hollywood schedules, and Hailee Steinfeld learned that in real time. As the Buffalo Bills pushed deeper into January football, the actress found herself balancing red carpet pressure with raw game-day nerves. The result was a rare behind-the-scenes look at how sports loyalty follows players and their families everywhere, even onto the world’s biggest entertainment stage.The Bills’ road win over Jacksonville marked a milestone moment for Josh Allen and the franchise. But for Steinfeld, watching it unfold from Los Angeles added a different kind of tension. While fans filled EverBank Stadium, she was preparing for the Golden Globes, navigating glamour, emotions, and playoff anxiety all at once.Steinfeld, who is pregnant with her first child, shared the experience in her Beau Society newsletter, revealing that the Bills game unfolded alongside her red carpet prep.She wrote, “The day of the Globes, something exciting was on TV that I’m sure you were all watching. Kickoff just happened to be at the same time as glam, so I was a little (lot) distracted. Luckily, my glam team is incredible at what they do and worked around my constant movement.”The fourth quarter only raised the stress. With multiple lead changes, every moment mattered. Steinfeld added, “Andrew warned me every time an iron was close to my face, so I didn’t accidentally burn myself. Ash waited for a commercial break to do my eyeliner. I don’t know how Tom painted my nails with my hands flying around, but he got it done. Dream team.”Despite the chaos, the night ended on a high. Steinfeld presented an award and celebrated her film Sinners, while the Bills’ win earned recognition even inside the ceremony. One moment stood out most. She recalled Adam Sandler stopping her to say, “Hey, buddy! I loved Sinners! You’re doing amazing. And congrats to Josh!”It was a reminder that when football matters, it follows you everywhere.","Hailee Steinfeld shared how Buffalo Bills playoff tension followed her to the Golden Globes.

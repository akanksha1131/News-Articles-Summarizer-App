'Aaj farewell match tha': Gautam Gambhir’s remark to Rohit Sharma sparks intense fan discussion,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/india-vs-australia/aaj-farewell-match-tha-gautam-gambhirs-remark-to-rohit-sharma-sparks-intense-fan-discussion/articleshow/124774490.cms,"Rohit Sharma and Gautam Gambhir (X-BCCI)

A clip has gone viral on social media showing Gautam Gambhir speaking to Rohit Sharma during India’s ongoing ODI series against Australia.

Rohit, who returned to the international stage in the series opener in Perth, had a tough outing, managing only eight runs. That knock attracted criticism, but he bounced back in the second ODI in Adelaide with a composed 73-run innings. Alongside Shreyas Iyer ’s 61, Rohit helped India reach 264 for 9. Although Australia chased the target to take an unassailable 2-0 lead in the series, Rohit’s innings showcased his determination and calm under pressure.Ever since Rohit was stripped of the ODI captaincy, there has been ongoing speculation on social media and among fans about his place in India’s 2027 ODI World Cup squad, along with Virat Kohli .The viral clip adds another layer to the narrative, showing a light-hearted moment behind the scenes amidst the pressure of international cricket.In Adelaide, Rohit displayed patience in a challenging Powerplay, surviving 17 dot balls off Josh Hazlewood and rotating the strike carefully with Iyer. The innings saw glimpses of classic Rohit as he pulled and flicked boundaries with elegance. Despite the eventual series loss, Rohit’s knock demonstrated that he still has plenty of cricket left in him.","A clip has gone viral on social media showing Gautam Gambhir speaking to Rohit Sharma during India’s ongoing ODI series against Australia.

Indian cricketer Yuzvendra Chahal shared a now-deleted cryptic Instagram Story featuring a Delhi High Court ruling about alimony payments, seemingly an indirect dig after his divorce from Dhanashree Verma. The post included a screenshot carrying a news article that said ""financially independent wives cannot demand alimony from their husbands"". This was captioned by Chahal as, ""Maa Kasam Khao Nahi Paltoge iss Decision Seh [swear on your mother you won't go back on this decision].""Chahal and Dhanashree Verma's divorce was finalised on March 20, 2025, at the Bombay High Court, following their separation in June 2022, just months after their December 2020 marriage.The court proceedings resulted in Chahal agreeing to pay an alimony of Rs 4.75 crore rupees to Dhanashree Verma after the divorce finalisation.During the final court hearing, Chahal made a statement by wearing a t-shirt with ""Be Your Own Sugar Daddy"" written on it.In a podcast with YouTuber Raj Shamani, Chahal opened up about the separation.""It was going on for a long while. We decided we do not want to show the people.Who knew if it did not happen? Maybe it will become a different scenario.

If one gets angry, the other has to listen. Sometimes the nature of two people does not match. I was playing for India, she was also doing her. This was going on for 1-2 years,"" Chahal explained.""At that point, I was so much into it, I had to give time here, give time there. I was not able to think about the relationship. Then it happens every day, you think, leave it. Two ambitious people can stay together. Everyone has their own lives. Everyone has their own goals. As a partner, you have to support it. You are working for something for 18-20 years, you cannot leave it for a relationship,"" he continued.Chahal also disclosed his struggle with mental health following the divorce: ""I had suicidal thoughts, I was tired of my life, I used to cry for 2 hours.

Women's World Cup prediction: Greenstone Lobo explains which team has best chance to win

India secured their spot in the Women's World Cup semifinals alongside Australia, South Africa, and England after defeating New Zealand by 53 runs through the DLS method in a rain-affected match.""For sure, it's a big relief in terms of qualifying. The last three games were really tough. We thought we played some good cricket but just couldn't win, so this is really relieving,"" Mandhana said at the post-match presentation.India's vice-captain Smriti Mandhana scored her fifth century of the year with 109 runs, while Pratika Rawal achieved her first World Cup century with 122 runs.The opening pair established a record 212-run partnership for the first wicket, helping India reach 340/3 in 49 overs, their highest World Cup total, exceeding their previous record of 330 against Australia in Visakhapatnam.After another rain delay, New Zealand's target was adjusted to 325 runs in 44 overs, with the 2000 champions managing 271/8.Mandhana, who received the player of the match award, acknowledged Pratika's equal contribution to their victory.""Pratika deserved this as much as I do,"" she added.""We've been asked this question for the last eight months, and I don't think either of us can answer it perfectly. But we're similar people -- we both just want to do the job for the team.We don't talk a lot in the middle. She's a good anchor and really allows me to play my natural game. When she gets going, I can chip in with the anchor role. That really works for us. We understand that when one person is going, the other can just focus on rotating the strike. ""India experienced a challenging phase after initial victories against Sri Lanka and Pakistan, suffering losses to South Africa, Australia, and England.""I back myself to play a longer innings once I get to 20. In World Cups, you have to leave a lot of things behind. If you are in form, you need to keep going and not complicate things -- that's what I kept telling myself. I'm feeling good, and that's what matters,"" she stated.Indian captain Harmanpreet Kaur discussed the team's determination to overcome their recent defeats, adding, ""Credit goes to the entire team for the way we fought today. We knew how important this game was, the entire team was charged up, and I am happy with how we played today. Credit goes to Smriti and Pratika for the way they took responsibility. We got a very good start.""Whenever you are playing at home, everyone expects a lot from you. As a team, we discuss that this is our home and the crowd is always cheering for us. This is a moment to enjoy rather than just putting pressure on ourselves.""New Zealand's campaign in the tournament faced significant challenges with three losses in six matches.""We are incredibly disappointed and gutted, not just for ourselves but for our friends and family.

Poll Should Ravindra Jadeja be included in the ODI squad for future series? Yes, he deserves a spot. No, we need to groom younger players.

Star India all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja , who is not a part of India's ODI team, will turn out for Saurashtra in their second round match of the Ranji Trophy against Madhya Pradesh at the Niranjan Shah Stadium in Rajkot starting from Saturday.The 36-year-old was dropped from the ongoing three-match ODI series against Australia.Since the last season, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has made it clear to the players that they must turn out for their state teams in domestic cricket as long as they are fit and available and not on national or India A duty.Jadeja has always turned out for Saurashtra in the Ranji Trophy. Last season, the 36-year-old ace left-arm spinner took 12 wickets in two Ranji matches, with best figures of seven for 38. Overall, Jadeja has taken a staggering 569 wickets at an impressive average of 24.20 and has amassed 8143 runs at 45.49, with 14 hundreds and two triple hundreds.""He informed us that he will play for Saurashtra in this round of the Ranji Trophy. He has always been keen to play for Saurashtra in the Ranji Trophy,"" Saurashtra Cricket Association president Jaydev Shah told TOI on Thursday.With the selectors trying out young left-arm spinners like Harsh Dubey and Manav Suthar in the two India A matches against South Africa A, Jadeja will aim to utilise the Ranji outing to get match practice ahead of the home two-Test series against South Africa starting at the Eden Gardens in Kolkata from November 14.In the first week of November, the veteran allrounder had scored a century (104 not out) and too four for 54 in the second innings to star in India's innings & 140-run crushing win over West Indies at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad.After not being picked for the ODIs, Ravindra Jadeja had said he wasn’t surprised to miss out on India’s upcoming ODI series in Australia, adding that the team management has communicated clearly with him about the decision.Jadeja, who will turn 37 this December, retired from T20Is following India’s World Cup triumph last year but remains eager to feature in the 2027 ODI World Cup.""Selection is not in my hands. I want to play, for sure,"" Jadeja had said at his press conference after the second day's play against West Indies in the Delhi Test.""At the end of the day, team management, selectors, coach and captain have their thoughts and they will have their reasons for not selecting me for this series. They have talked to me, it was not a surprise for me after the squad was announced.""It is a good thing that they communicated the reason behind my omission. I am happy about that. But whenever I get a chance next, I will try and do what I have done all these years.""If I get a chance in the World Cup and there are many ODIs before and if I do well there, it will be a good thing for Indian cricket. Winning a World Cup is everyone's dream. We had narrowly missed out the last time, the next time we will try and make up for it.""Chief selector Ajit Agarkar had also maintained that Jadeja is still part of the 2027 ODI World Cup plans.""With regards to Jaddu, I mean look, at the moment to take two left-arm spinners to Australia is not possible. He is clearly in the scheme of things with how good he is, but there will be some competition for places,"" Agarkar had said.""Of course he was there in the Champions Trophy squad, because we took those extra spinners with the conditions there in the UAE.""At the moment we could only carry one and get some balance in the team with Washy (Washington Sundar]) and Kuldeep there as well. I don't think we are going to need more than that in Australia. It's a short series, you can't accommodate everyone and unfortunately at the moment he is missing out, but it's nothing more than that.""So far, Jadeja has featured in 204 ODIs, claiming 231 wickets and scoring 2806 runs. In his last ODI appearance during the Champions Trophy, he picked up five wickets in as many innings while maintaining an economy rate of 4.35.Recently, former India captain and head coach Ravi Shastri had heaped laurels on Ravindra Jadeja and claimed that there is no question over him being in plans for the 2027 ODI World Cup in South Africa, Zimbabwe and Namibia.""2027 everyone talks. Do not discount or write off Ravindra Jadeja. He will be in the mix; there is no question about that. He's still fielding like he is 7-8 years younger than what he is. It is just a privilege to watch him chase a ball on the field,"" Ravi Shastri said while speaking on the ICC Review Podcast.",India all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja will turn out for Saurashtra in their second round match of the Ranji Trophy against Madhya Pradesh. The 36-year-old was dropped from the ongoing three-match ODI series against Australia.

Rohit Sharma ‘deliberately underperforming’ under Shubman Gill? India legend fires back,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/india-vs-australia/rohit-sharma-deliberately-underperforming-under-shubman-gill-india-legend-fires-back/articleshow/124750273.cms,"Rohit Sharma (ANI)

New ODI Captain Shubman Gill speaks out on Virat, Rohit and taking Indian cricket forward

India’s star openers had a forgettable start to the three-match ODI series against Australia in Perth on Sunday. Rohit Sharma managed just eight runs, while Virat Kohli was dismissed for a duck, as India lost the first match by seven wickets under the DLS method. The game also marked a new chapter in Indian cricket, with Shubman Gill taking over as the ODI captain, leading both veteran batters for the first time.Rohit’s low score sparked a flurry of speculation on social media, with some fans suggesting that the senior right-hander might have deliberately underperformed to challenge Gill’s authority as the new captain. These theories quickly went viral, drawing reactions from fans around the world.However, former India captain Sunil Gavaskar firmly dismissed such claims, stressing that no player would risk underperforming intentionally, as it could jeopardise their place in the team.“In Indian cricket, there’s a persistent myth that a player who loses the captaincy might underperform to undermine the new skipper,” Gavaskar wrote in his Sportstar column. “Nothing could be further from the truth. If a former captain doesn’t perform, he could be out of the team entirely. No player, regardless of personal feelings, would deliberately throw a game.”Gavaskar also highlighted that having experienced leaders like Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli in the squad is a huge advantage for a young captain like Shubman Gill.The duo’s presence provides mentorship and guidance, which can help the new captain navigate his debut series.“Questions have been raised about whether Gill can handle two former captains in his team. But he has made it clear that his relationship with Rohit and Virat hasn’t changed with his new role,” Gavaskar added. “In fact, having them around is a bonus. Both are willing to offer advice when needed, and there’s no better support for a debutant captain than two of India’s greatest ODI players by his side.”","India's star openers had a forgettable start to the three-match ODI series against Australia in Perth on Sunday.

Former India all-rounder Irfan Pathan has advised Virat Kohli to remain patient and trust his game following consecutive ducks against Australia in the ongoing ODI series. Australia secured an unassailable 2-0 lead in the series, with Adam Zampa earning Player of the Match for his four-wicket haul in the second ODI, where India posted 264/9 before Australia successfully chased down the target.Kohli 's dismissal came when Xavier Bartlett trapped him leg-before with a clever variation, following a series of outswingers with an inswinger that caught him on the pads."" Virat Kohli, two ducks in two matches, we have not seen it before. It could be because of pressure, rustiness and everything. Whatever chatter is ongoing on social media about these two (Rohit Virat), these two players mustn't get affected by it. No one will play if they don't perform. But they have done wonderful work for India. They need support, persistence from selectors till the runs, the right rhythm does not come. It would be really important.""I know it is difficult since Yashasvi Jaiswal is on the sidelines. It is not easy to play when the sword is hanging over you. I hope this is not in Virat's mind. In the first match, he got out to an outside off-stump delivery. He thought, with three slips in place, whether I would be given outside off-stump deliveries? The ball came in a bit, and he tried playing his favourite flick shot and got beaten there.The gap (between bat and pad) while playing flick was so big, I've never seen something like that from him. """"How can Virat get out of it. Virat would want to make sure to get that single and get off strike. But he should not get desperate. I hope for that one single; he would not get desperate and stop enjoying his batting. He has to enjoy his batting. If he does that, he will get more time at the crease, and if he gets runs, he will not look back. ODI is his favourite format. I appeal to the fans: these two, if they play one year, two years more, play the World Cup, or don't play much --no matter how much cricket they play, it is time to enjoy their cricket because they have given Indian cricket so much. We would hope they play as much as possible. Hope Virat gets in form soon in the next match. He can struggle like Rohit did today, but he can also regain his rhythm and showcase his craft gradually. Don't get desperate for that single, runs will come.""Rohit Sharma scored a determined 73 runs off 97 balls, including seven boundaries and two sixes, in a challenging innings.""Even though he struggled, this knock would give him more satisfaction than anything else. He was prepared for that struggle. He showcased his fitness too while surviving that run-out attempt. As of late, he has batted at a strike rate of 120-130, but his SR till 60 balls has been around 50. You could feel that a more free-flowing knock would have benefitted India, but this would give him a lot of satisfaction.""In the match, Australia won the toss and elected to field. India's innings began cautiously with Rohit and Shubman Gill, but Bartlett's bowling reduced India to 17/2, dismissing both Gill (9) and Kohli (0).Rohit and Shreyas Iyer (61 off 77 balls) stabilised the innings with a 118-run partnership. Axar Patel contributed 44 runs from 41 balls at number five.Adam Zampa's bowling spell (4/60) put India in trouble at 226/8, but Harshit Rana (24- off 18 balls) and Arshdeep Singh (13) added 37 runs for the ninth wicket, helping India reach 264/9.Australia's chase saw early setbacks at 54/2, but Matt Short (74 off 78 balls), Cooper Connolly (61- off 53 balls), and Mitchell Owen (36 off 23 balls) maintained control despite wickets from Washington Sundar (2/37), Arshdeep (2/41), and Harshit (2/59).Pathan also praised Josh Hazlewood's bowling performance, describing his wicketless spell of 0/29 in 10 overs as one of the unluckiest he had seen.","Former India all-rounder Irfan Pathan has advised Virat Kohli to remain patient and trust his game following consecutive ducks against Australia.

Even though Rohit Sharma is no longer India’s official ODI captain, his leadership on the field remains evident. In the second match of the ongoing three-game series against Australia in Adelaide, Rohit could be seen stepping in to guide off-spinner Washington Sundar with animated, tactical advice, while Shubman Gill focused on setting the field. His gestures and instructions clearly highlighted that Rohit’s influence on team strategy and decision-making continues, even without the captain’s armband.The incident took place after the 33rd over, when Rohit noticed Sundar struggling with his bowling plan to left-handed batter Cooper Connolly. Rohit walked up to the bowler and delivered a fiery, hands-on chat, making numerous gestures to indicate the changes Sundar needed to make. Sundar listened silently and followed the guidance, while Gill remained occupied with field placements. Former India pacer Varun Aaron, commenting on the move, noted, “The key for the off-spinner to the left-hander is to move the ball away from the batter, and bowl a little slower. Generally captains come and tell the bowlers what to do.”Click here to watch the video Earlier in the match, Rohit produced a remarkable comeback. After being dismissed for just eight runs in the rain-shortened series opener in Perth, which had intensified World Cup speculation, the 38-year-old struck a patient 73 in Adelaide. His innings laid the foundation for India’s total of 264 for 9. During the knock, Rohit shared a crucial 118-run partnership for the third wicket with vice-captain Shreyas Iyer , who scored 61 off 77 balls, helping India recover after losing Gill (9) and Virat Kohli (0) quickly.Later in the innings, Axar Patel, promoted to No. 5, contributed 44 off 41 balls, including a 39-run stand with Sundar (12). Tail-enders Harshit Rana (24 not out) and Arshdeep Singh (13) added 37 runs off 29 balls for the ninth wicket. Despite these efforts, Australia managed to chase the target in 46.2 overs with two wickets in hand. Adam Zampa was named Player of the Match for his four-wicket haul.Rohit’s performance and on-field guidance underscored that even without formal captaincy, he remains a central figure in India’s ODI strategy.","Rohit Sharma stepped in to guide off-spinner Washington Sundar with tactical advice.

Tilak Varma has opened up about how his friendship with former India captain and Mumbai Indians skipper Rohit Sharma evolved. He revealed that Rohit’s daughter Samaira unexpectedly played a key role in it as well.Appearing on 'Breakfast with Champions' with Gaurav Kapur, the young batter recalled his early days in the Mumbai Indians camp during the 2022 IPL season, describing how his admiration for Rohit initially left him too nervous to start a conversation.“It was in 2022 during COVID. We were in the Taj Hotel in Mumbai. I met everyone but hadn’t seen Rohit yet. I was very excited to see him as I had never met him before,” Tilak said. “He came on the third day with his family. I went to the breakfast area, took some juice, and sat in one corner just to see him. I wanted to talk to him but was scared.”Tilak then said that he confessed his feelings to a media person who was close to the then MI skipper.As fate would have it, the media member passed on Tilak’s feelings to Rohit, who then called the youngster to his room.“Rohit bhai asked me to meet him, and we sat together for around one and a half hours.We ordered food and spoke at length. Honestly, I wasn’t even listening to half of what he said — I was just looking at him, feeling nervous and happy,” Tilak laughed.From that day on, Tilak began joining Rohit regularly for breakfast, where he also developed a fond bond with Samaira, Rohit’s daughter. “I liked playing with kids, so I used to play with Sammy — and that’s how our bond grew stronger,” he added.Since that season, Tilak has cemented his place as the backbone of MI’s middle order, scoring 1,499 runs in 51 innings at an average of 37.47 and a strike rate of 144.41, including eight fifties.He recently shone in the Asia Cup, finishing as India’s second-highest run-getter with 213 runs in six innings, including a match-winning 69* against Pakistan in the final.Tilak will next be seen in action during India’s T20I series against Australia starting October 29 and will look to carry on not just form, but also the confidence earned through mentorship and trust from one of India’s modern greats.",Tilak Varma has opened up about how his friendship with Rohit Sharma evolved.

'Not something I changed suddenly': Shreyas Iyer explains how he regained confidence; reacts to series defeat vs Australia

Poll Should players prioritize workload management across formats of cricket? Yes, it’s crucial for performance No, players should adapt to all formats Depends on the player's personal preference Not sure

Indian batsman Shreyas Iyer emphasised the importance of managing workload across formats to maintain intensity, particularly in red-ball cricket. Speaking after India’s two-wicket loss to Australia in the second ODI at Adelaide, Iyer explained how his approach to workload and technical adjustments have helped him stay consistent and confident.Earlier this month, Shreyas Iyer requested a six-month break from red-ball cricket due to concerns about his back, which was approved by the BCCI “When I field for long hours in red-ball cricket, I've realised my intensity tends to drop. At the international level, that can make a difference. In ODIs, you have rest days and time to recover, so it's easier to manage. Based on that, I've planned my approach,” he said.Iyer also discussed the recent return to an upright batting stance, which he credits for boosting his adaptability across different surfaces.“The technique I've got lately is not something that I've changed suddenly. Since last year, I wanted to have an upright stance, especially on wickets where the bounce is a little more than expected. I worked with my coach on it, and it has been suiting me quite well. I grew up playing with that kind of stance, so I just thought of going back to my old method and seeing how it works out,” he explained.Highlighting the need to adjust according to conditions, the 30-year-old added, “Even in Mumbai, when we play on red-soil wickets with extra bounce, an upright stance helps.You have to keep chopping and changing because every surface is different. I've changed my stance several times now, and I feel I can adapt anywhere at the moment.”Reflecting on his 118-run partnership with Rohit Sharma against a challenging Australian attack, Iyer said, “Hazlewood was bowling brilliantly. The ball was seaming in and out, and it wasn't an easy wicket to bat on at the start. We wanted to have an attacking approach but also rotate strike as much as possible. It was about ensuring we reached a total from where we could put pressure on the bowlers later.”Iyer also acknowledged Australia’s strong batting, particularly youngster Cooper Connolly. “I was fielding on the far end, so I couldn't exactly tell when the wicket changed. But credit where it's due — they batted superbly. They rotated strike well, and Cooper, especially being a youngster, showed a lot of maturity to finish off the game,” he said.On balancing domestic and international cricket, Iyer shared, “I don't see much of a challenge. It's about adapting to the conditions and being match-prepared. Domestic cricket gives you that confidence, and recently, the India A series also gave me a good boost before coming here.”Despite India’s defeat, Iyer praised the Australian bowlers’ effectiveness and discussed his progress since the Nagpur ODI against England. “It definitely hurts. The first game wasn't convincing because rain played an important role and conditions favoured them. But this match was a do-or-die one for us, and we wanted to put our best foot forward. Losing early wickets made it difficult, and the Australian bowlers took full advantage,” he said.“I came from a domestic season where my average was around 300. When you have runs behind you, you walk into international cricket with confidence. Some things are in your control, some are not. My focus is to perform every time I step on the ground,” he added.","India batsman Shreyas Iyer emphasised the importance of managing workload across formats to maintain intensity.

He has instilled that in us, and we have to keep up that mentality.""Former Southampton defender Bednarek's potential equaliser in the second half was disallowed following a VAR review due to Samu Aghehowa being offside.VAR intervened again when Nicola Savona's diving booking was overturned, resulting in a second penalty with 13 minutes remaining.Igor Jesus scored his first goal at the City Ground by converting the penalty.Villa manager Unai Emery acknowledged the challenges of European football after their perfect Europa League start ended in the Netherlands.Villa had previously defeated Bologna and Feyenoord, living up to their status as tournament favourites.Evann Guessand gave Villa an early lead with his first goal for the club.The Dutch Cup winners fought back in challenging weather conditions to achieve a historic win in their first European group stage appearance.Mathis Suray equalized before halftime with a deflected shot, and Mats Deijl chipped the ball over Emiliano Martinez to take the lead.Emi Buendia, who had scored the winning goal against Tottenham last Sunday, missed a late penalty that could have secured a draw.""Today showed us how difficult it is to play in Europe, to play away. This is the reason I love football, because football has a lot of different ways to win. You can dominate, like we did, you have chances to score, but if we are conceding a few chances, maybe you can lose. And we did.""Rangers suffered a 3-0 defeat to Brann in Norway, marking a disappointing start for new manager Danny Rohl.The Glasgow team's hopes of advancing are diminishing after their third consecutive Europa League loss left them at the bottom of the 36-team standings.Emil Kornvig scored at the back post to give Brann a halftime advantage.Jacob Sorensen headed in from a free-kick, exploiting poor defending, before Noah Holm added a third goal.Celtic secured their first European victory of the season by defeating Sturm Graz in a comeback win.Liam Scales and Benjamin Nygren scored within three minutes of each other after Tomi Horvat's impressive opening goal for the Austrian side at Celtic Park.Midtjylland claimed the top spot in the standings with a 3-0 victory over Maccabi Tel-Aviv.Lyon maintained their perfect record by defeating Basel 2-0 with goals from Corentin Tolisso and Afonso Moreira.Braga continued their winning streak, securing their third consecutive victory by beating Red Star Belgrade 2-0.Bologna achieved their first win in the league phase with a 2-1 victory at Steaua Bucharest.Fenerbahce earned a 1-0 win against Stuttgart, while Real Betis drew 0-0 at Genk.",Sean Dyche's Nottingham Forest beat Porto 2-0 in Europa League.

Real Madrid player Dani Carvajal implored La Liga chief Javier Tebas to not take a league game to Miami.

What does it mean?

What happens next?

La Liga's plan to move Barcelona's trip to face Villarreal in December to Miami in the United States collapsed this week under heavy pressure within Spain.La Liga have been trying to move a match to the US since 2018, when they planned to take Girona v Barcelona to Miami.This year's attempt was as close as they have got, after getting the green light from European football governing body UEFA and the Spanish football federation (RFEF).However with under six weeks to go until the scheduled kick-off, between Villarreal and Barcelona, La Liga were forced to abandon their plan.Their US-based promoter, Relevent Sports said they would cancel arranging the game because of ""uncertainty generated in Spain"" around the match, and a lack of time.It left La Liga licking their wounds, with president Javier Tebas ruing the loss of a ""historic opportunity"" to play the first ever overseas European league match.Tebas was hoping to follow the lead of the NFL and NBA in taking their product abroad, further breaking into the lucrative North American market and ""grow the competition's value"".La Liga players across Spain standing still for the first 15 seconds of their matches last weekend proved an impactful protest.It was organised by the Spanish footballers' association (AFE), who were upset at not being consulted about the plans and criticised a ""lack of transparency and collaboration"".They said that game being moved to the US breached the players' collective bargaining agreement, and further added to a high workload and travel-packed schedule.Spanish giants Real Madrid were particularly vociferous opponents to the scheme, insisting it would ""adulterate"" the competition, and twice writing to the country's Sports Council (CSD) demanding action be taken.Los Blancos captain Dani Carvajal said the Miami game would be a ""stain"" on La Liga, while coach Xabi Alonso also railed at it on multiple occasions.Madrid goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois criticised the players' protest not being shown on La Liga's broadcast of last weekend's action, saying the league hiding it was ""censorship and manipulation"".Even Barcelona coach Hansi Flick and midfielder Frenkie de Jong said they were against the match being played in Miami.De Jong admitted it was ""not fair in terms of competition"" because an away game would take place at a neutral ground.It's back to the drawing board for a frustrated La Liga, although in the long run they will be heartened by getting as close as they did this time. ""We will keep trying,"" insisted Tebas.However Villarreal were left seething at a ""lack of respect"" from the Spanish top flight, who announced the cancellation during their Champions League match against Manchester City on Tuesday.The Yellow Submarine also hammered La Liga's management of the event and said they might have pulled out later this week in any case, citing logistic hurdles which La Liga could not offer them answers to.Villarreal cast doubt on La Liga's competency to arrange a match abroad. Other teams watching on may be less keen on being a part of a future project as a result, with its credibility taking a knock.Clubs will also note the unhappiness of several fan groups about the match being moved, and also a discrepancy regarding payment.Barcelona president Joan Laporta said his team would cash in thanks to the game, while Villarreal said all gains should be going to their fans, in the form of flights to Miami or discounts on their season tickets if they did not decide to travel.La Liga and Tebas will keep pushing to make it happen, determined that taking the game abroad is the best way to grow.In the meantime the league is also attempting to sue the AFE, according to Spanish reports, because of the 15-second players standstill which they are labelling a strike.La Liga might be better off learning to foster better communication with other football bodies in the future to take their plan to fruition.The CSD pointed out that ""appropriate regulations"" for this kind of game do not currently exist, which is something FIFA is expected to look at creating in the coming months.Now Italy and their top flight, Serie A, may become the first European league to take a game abroad, with AC Milan v Como set for Perth, Australia in February.The cancellation of La Liga's Miami match could spark a knock-on effect in Italy, with fan body Football Supporters Europe already calling for Serie A to scrap their plans too.","La Liga have been trying to move a match to the US since 2018, when they planned to take Girona v Barcelona to Miami.

Poll What impacts do you think the cancellation of the Miami match will have on La Liga's international growth? Negative impact on growth Opportunity for better domestic focus No significant impact

La Liga’s plan to stage a Barcelona match in Miami this December has been cancelled, with the league’s president, Javier Tebas, calling it a “missed opportunity” for Spanish football.The fixture, which would have seen Champions Barcelona face Villarreal on December 20 in the United States, was set to be the first-ever European league game played abroad. Following the cancellation, the match will now take place as scheduled at Villarreal’s Estadio de la Cerámica.La Liga said the decision came after its promoter pulled out due to “uncertainty generated in Spain in recent weeks.” The move had been heavily criticised in the country, drawing protests from players and opposition from other clubs.The Spanish Footballers’ Association (AFE) staged demonstrations last weekend, with players pausing for 15 seconds at the start of matches to show their disapproval. Real Madrid also expressed opposition to the plan, arguing that playing abroad could undermine the league’s competitive integrity.Goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois said the proposal “would adulterate the competition,” while Madrid captain Dani Carvajal described it as “a stain” on La Liga.Despite the pushback, Tebas defended the league’s intentions, lamenting the missed chance to grow Spanish football internationally. He wrote on X, “This historic opportunity has been lost. We miss a chance to develop, to project ourselves in the world and reinforce our future.”""And others, perhaps unknowingly and in good faith, have been drawn into debates about information that was already addressed in 2018, where that supposed “information”—which they had then and have now—was merely an excuse to kill the project,"" he further added.He also criticised critics who questioned La Liga’s motives, saying, “We are appealing to the 'integrity of the competition' from those who have been questioning this same integrity for years, putting pressure on referees and managers, constructing distorted narratives or using political and media pressure as a sporting tool.”The cancelled Miami match would have been a landmark event as per the league president, highlighting La Liga’s ambition to expand its global reach.With the game now returning to Spain, attention will shift back to domestic competition, while discussions about future international fixtures are expected to continue.","La Liga’s plan to stage a Barcelona match in Miami this December has been cancelled.

Mexican security firms are gearing up to provide armoured vehicles and protection services for wealthy tourists during the 2026 FIFA World Cup , which Mexico will co-host with the United States and Canada from June 11 to July 19. The growing security industry, driven by concerns over criminal violence and drug cartels, offers various services from bulletproof cars to armed escorts.Leopoldo Cerdeira, head of security firm Ruhe, demonstrated his fleet's armour plating capabilities by firing bullets into a car door at his Mexico City warehouse. His company maintains 70 armoured vehicles, with plans to expand to 80 for the World Cup.""Our bookings are for tourists, people who have money, who come to see the matches but are afraid because they have heard bad things about Mexico,"" said Cerdeira at his company's headquarters.The security industry has expanded beyond luxury armoured vehicles to include drivers, armed escorts, bomb protection, bulletproof vests, and armoured briefcases. This growth is largely attributed to Mexico's high crime rate, with approximately 30,000 murders annually.""The country's insecurity has led to the growth of our industry,"" said Gabriel Hernandez, head of Armoring Group, which sells bulletproof cars and clothing for civilians and military personnel in Mexico, Spain and the United States.Three Mexican cities will host World Cup matches: Mexico City, Monterrey, and Guadalajara. The capital has installed 40,000 additional CCTV cameras and will restrict drone usage in all host cities.Guadalajara, home to the Jalisco Nueva Generacion Cartel (CJNG), presents particular security challenges. The United States has designated CJNG as terrorists and offered a $12 million reward for their leader's arrest.Security companies offer various protective features, including electric shock car handles, pepper spray-releasing wheels, and puncture-resistant tires that can run for 80 kilometers. Daily rental rates for armoured vehicles range from $800 to $1,100, with additional costs for drivers and escorts.Drug cartels have developed their own security measures, creating heavily armoured vehicles known as ""monsters."" Authorities recently discovered a clandestine armouring workshop in Sinaloa state.The security industry faces challenges with cartels recruiting their workers. Cerdeira lost two employees to criminal groups eight years ago, who were later found dead in Sinaloa despite being offered triple their salaries.Security consultant David Saucedo, who works with embassies and local authorities, suggests the cartels may not directly threaten the World Cup.""They themselves have a social base that will benefit from the matches,"" explained Saucedo, who also suggested the possibility of an unofficial agreement between authorities and cartels to maintain peace during the tournament.Ruhe's fleet has already provided services to FIFA delegations and will be used for the upcoming Mexican Formula 1 Grand Prix, demonstrating the growing demand for security services in high-profile events.Mexico City, which previously hosted World Cup finals in 1970 and 1986, typically experiences less cartel-related violence compared to other host cities. Local authorities have emphasised their commitment to ensuring security during the tournament.","Mexican security firms are gearing up to provide armoured vehicles and protection services for wealthy tourists during the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

J.J. McCarthy injury update: How long will Vikings fans have to wait for the QB to return?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/j-j-mccarthy-injury-update-how-long-will-vikings-fans-have-to-wait-for-the-qb-to-return/articleshow/124774418.cms,"When will J.J. McCarthy finally return to action for the Vikings after his recent injury? (Imagn Images)

J.J. McCarthy Injury update : High-ankle sprain keeps QB sidelined



What McCarthy’s return could mean for the Vikings



The Minnesota Vikings’ hopes for J.J. McCarthy’s breakthrough season have hit another roadblock. After missing his entire rookie year due to a knee injury, McCarthy suffered a high-ankle sprain in Week 2 against Atlanta, forcing him to sit out yet again. Fans tuning in for Thursday Night Football against the Chargers saw Carson Wentz under center, as the young quarterback continues his cautious recovery.McCarthy is listed as inactive on Thursday but remains the emergency third quarterback, Ben Goessling of The Minnesota Star Tribune reports. This marks the fifth consecutive game he will miss, though his role as the emergency QB keeps the door open if both Wentz and backup Max Brosmer were to leave the game. Initially, McCarthy’s injury was expected to keep him out for just two to three weeks, and he even finished the Atlanta game, raising hopes it was minor.Head coach Kevin O’Connell explained, “He’s just not there yet.” He added that McCarthy could have played if this week’s matchup had been on a Sunday instead of a short Thursday turnaround. “He needs to be in a state where he could do his job for 60 minutes without having any setbacks or making his job more difficult than it has to be,” O’Connell said, emphasizing the team’s cautious approach.McCarthy’s recent limited practices suggest that the Vikings are carefully pacing his return, giving him a 10-day window to prepare for Week 9 against the Detroit Lions.Through two starts this season, McCarthy completed just 58.5% of his passes for 301 yards, two touchdowns, and three interceptions. While the stats reflect growing pains, his arm strength and mobility show why Minnesota invested a top-10 draft pick in him. Wentz has performed admirably with a 2-2 record in McCarthy’s absence, but the long-term plan revolves around the young quarterback’s development.Minnesota sits at the bottom of a tight NFC North race, and a healthy McCarthy could dramatically shift their offensive outlook. His return will be closely monitored, both for his performance and durability. The Vikings are betting that patience now will pay off in stability and success later, preserving their young quarterback’s future while carefully navigating the remainder of the season.Also Read: Chargers star Keenan Allen could rewrite franchise history with record-breaking performance vs Vikings","Minnesota Vikings quarterback J.J.

Keenan Allen closing in on Chargers all-time receptions record



A fitting stage for a historic moment



Los Angeles Chargers wide receiver Keenan Allen is on the brink of an unforgettable milestone that could etch his name deeper into franchise history. As the Chargers faces the Minnesota Vikings on Thursday Night Football, Allen needs just eight receptions to surpass Antonio Gates’ all-time franchise record for most career catches — a record long thought untouchable.When Keenan Allen returned to Los Angeles on a one-year, $8.5 million deal this offseason, it felt like a storybook homecoming. After a brief stint with the Chicago Bears in 2024, the veteran receiver rejoined the organization where he built his legacy. Drafted in 2013 by the then-San Diego Chargers, Allen has been the definition of reliability for over a decade. He’s recorded more than 1,000 receiving yards in six of his 12 seasons, earning the reputation as one of the most consistent and polished route runners in the NFL.Now, he sits at 948 receptions — just seven shy of Gates’ 955. Per Pro Football Talk’s Mike Florio, that means eight catches against Minnesota would make Allen the Chargers’ all-time leader in receptions. “Eight receptions might seem like a lot for a receiver with the wear on the tires Allen has, but it’s a distinct possibility,” one analyst noted. And indeed, the odds are in his favor.Allen leads the team in both targets and receptions this season, averaging 9.3 targets and 6.2 catches per game.At 33, he remains Justin Herbert’s most trusted option, thriving on timing and precision routes. Against a Minnesota defense that blitzes aggressively under coordinator Brian Flores, Allen’s ability to find soft spots in coverage could be crucial. Herbert, who has performed well under pressure this season, will likely look to get the ball out quickly — and Allen is often his first read.If Allen does make history tonight, the setting couldn’t be more poetic. The Chargers will wear their all-navy uniforms — the same color once worn by legends like Junior Seau, LaDainian Tomlinson, and, of course, Antonio Gates. It’s a perfect nod to the franchise’s past and present, a symbolic passing of the torch.For fans, it’s a night filled with nostalgia and anticipation. Watching Allen — the player who carried the franchise through years of transition — possibly claim the top spot in receptions, under the prime-time lights, feels like the perfect full-circle moment in Chargers history.Also Read: Jon Jones breaks silence with heartbreaking tribute after NFL star brother Arthur’s sudden death at just 39","Keenan Allen needs just eight receptions to surpass Antonio Gates' all-time franchise record for most career catches.

Is Denver Broncos the new ‘America’s Team’?

John Franklin-Myers sparks debate with bold ‘America’s Team’ claim



Broncos defense faces major test against Dak Prescott and Cowboys offense



The Denver Broncos are set to host the Dallas Cowboys in what promises to be one of Week 8’s most thrilling matchups. With the Broncos riding high atop the AFC West at 5-2 and the Cowboys clawing back to a 3-3-1 record after their victory over Washington, the stakes are high. Every time the Cowboys appear on the schedule, the game feels bigger—and this one has an extra spark.Broncos defensive lineman John Franklin-Myers added some playful fuel to the fire this week when he said, “You ask me, the Broncos are America’s team.” It was a confident statement that instantly caught attention, especially since the Cowboys have carried that title since 1978. The nickname was originally coined by a film producer during a highlight reel and stuck for decades. But Franklin-Myers’ remark was more than just banter—it showed the confidence and swagger that define this Denver squad.Behind the humor lies a serious competitor. Franklin-Myers has been a force this season, tallying 11 tackles and three sacks while consistently disrupting opposing offenses. His presence on the defensive line has taken pressure off Jonathon Cooper, Zach Allen, and Nik Bonitto, giving Denver’s defense a sharper edge.The unit has been one of the strongest in the league, and Franklin-Myers’ dominance has played a big part in that.This Sunday, that defense will face a tough test against Dak Prescott, who’s in fine form. Prescott has been connecting well with CeeDee Lamb, who torched Washington last week with a 74-yard touchdown, and George Pickens, giving Dallas plenty of offensive firepower. Denver’s star cornerback Pat Surtain II and the secondary will have their hands full trying to contain that duo.A win here would strengthen Denver’s playoff position and validate their growing confidence. For the Cowboys, victory could spark a potential winning streak, with games against the Cardinals and Raiders up next. But make no mistake—Franklin-Myers and the Broncos aren’t backing down. They’re ready to prove that “America’s Team” might just live in Denver now.Also Read: Jon Jones breaks silence with heartbreaking tribute after NFL star brother Arthur’s sudden death at just 39","Denver Broncos defensive lineman John Franklin-Myers said, ""You ask me, the Broncos are America’s team"" The Cowboys have carried that title since 1978.

Travis Kelce and Patrick Mahomes plan first fan event at the restaurant

Patrick Mahomes’ family is standing behind him after fans began criticizing the new restaurant he opened together with Travis Kelce . The Kansas City Chiefs stars’ high-end steakhouse, called 1587 Prime, launched on September 17 inside the Loews Kansas City Hotel and quickly became a celebrity hangout. But in just a few weeks, some diners have complained about the high prices and food quality. Mahomes’ family, however, publicly showed support and appeared happy to back the project despite that backlash.The restaurant’s name comes from Mahomes’ number 15 and Kelce’s number 87. It was created to mix luxury dining with the spirit of Chiefs football.According to Business Insider reporter Kelsey Huson (source), the menu is priced like any other premium steakhouse, cocktails cost around $18–$25, starters around $16–$40, and some dishes go up to $130.Even with that, several visitors recently posted criticism online, saying the price does not match the quality.Amid that talk, Patrick Mahomes’ younger brother Jackson Mahomes posted a photo on Instagram showing the entire Mahomes family, mom Randi, dad Pat, Patrick Mahomes, his wife Brittany Mahomes and sister Mia, all smiling together at a round marble table inside the restaurant. The message was clear: the family is fully behind the quarterback’s business.Travis Kelce and Patrick Mahomes have also confirmed that 1587 Prime will host its first official fan event on October 27 before the Monday Night Football game against the Washington Commanders in Kansas City.Also Read: NFL Trade Rumors: Jerome Ford’s Future In Doubt As Quinshon Judkins Completely Takes Over Cleveland Browns Offence The event will be free and open to the public, which may help improve public opinion and bring fans closer to the restaurant.Despite recent complaints about the price-to-quality ratio, the steakhouse remains popular among celebrities and close friends of the Chiefs stars, and Mahomes’ family appearance sends a strong sign that they are unfazed by the early criticism.","Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce opened a high-end steakhouse together in September.

Why did Rick Carlisle lose his cool?

Rick Carlisle confronts courtside cameraman after halftime in Pacers Thunder opener

The Indiana Pacers kicked off their season against the Oklahoma City Thunder on Thursday, October 23, 2025, at Gainbridge Fieldhouse in Indianapolis, and things got intense fast. With a game full of tough defense and not many points, Pacers head coach Rick Carlisle lost his cool in the last moments of the first half, resulting in a technical foul and a heated exchange with a cameraman.Carlisle's outburst is clearly linked to the intense emotions of going up against the Thunder right after their Finals loss.Last season's championship series had its share of controversial officiating, with Game 4 racking up 53 personal fouls, two flagrant fouls, and two technical fouls for both teams combined.Carlisle stood up for referee Scott Foster after Game 4, labeling the criticism of the officiating as ""unfair and stupid"" during a press conference, highlighting how physical the game was.Oklahoma City Thunder's coach Mark Daigneault shared this feeling with reporters following that game, saying, ""There were a crap ton of fouls. That's why there were a crap ton of free throws,"" while praising the refs' handling of the contest.Carlisle's intense sideline presence gives us some background. Throughout his NBA coaching journey with the Detroit Pistons, Indiana Pacers, and Dallas Mavericks, he's racked up a lot of technical fouls, frequently using them as a tactic to energize his squad.In the 2025 playoffs, he got tossed from Game 3 of the Eastern Conference Semifinals against the Cleveland Cavaliers after picking up a second technical for arguing about a no-call.Then, during the Finals against OKC, he received another technical just five minutes into Game 5, charging at the officials after they missed a foul on Andrew Nembhard and had to be held back by staff.In this intro, the blend of the fresh Finals injuries—where OKC knocked out Indiana in a key Game 7—and the noticeable effect of the un-reviewed call likely sent Carlisle over the edge.As Pacers guard Andrew Nembhard mentioned in a pre-game chat with reporters about going up against OKC once more, ""There's a certain feeling when you get out with guys... They're a hard-playing group, super deep, really aggressive defensively."" Losing a challenge opportunity in such a tight game amplified that defensive pressure.The drama didn't stop with the technical foul. As Carlisle made his way to the locker room during halftime, he ran into a courtside cameraman who was standing way too close. Still fuming from the earlier on-court incident, Carlisle let his frustration out on the media guy, shouting at him to move back. No extra penalties were handed out, but the whole scene was caught on camera and spread rapidly on social media, leading to comparisons with Carlisle's intense behavior during the Finals.This latest outburst emphasizes Carlisle's reputation for being brutally honest. During a 2024 post-game press conference after getting ejected, he told the reporters, ""Sometimes you have to take one for the team,"" talking about using tactics to inspire his team. Even though there weren't any clear comments right after Thursday's event, it seems like Carlisle sees these situations as ways to motivate his players.Rick Carlisle losing his temper shows the intense side of a coach still burdened by a Finals defeat. It’s not merely annoyance; it’s a declaration, a strategic move, and a clear indication to his squad that only complete effort will suffice.Whether you interpret it as dramatic or as brilliant coaching, these moments encapsulate Carlisle: a coach willing to intertwine emotion with strategy, aware that fervor can both motivate and fracture a team in critical moments.Also Read: Los Angeles Clippers vs Utah Jazz (22-10-2025): Box score, player stats, game summary and more","Indiana Pacers head coach Rick Carlisle lost his cool against the Oklahoma City Thunder on Thursday, October 23, 2025.

The Fallout and What Lies Ahead

The NBA finds itself at the center of one of the most shocking scandals in its history, as new revelations allege thatattempted to profit from inside information concerning. These allegations have surfaced amid an extensive FBI probe into illegal sports gambling, which has already implicated several NBA figures in a complex web of underground betting operations.The controversy stems from the February 9, 2023, matchup between the Los Angeles Lakers and the Milwaukee Bucks. On that night, LeBron James - fresh off breaking Kareem Abdul-Jabbar’s all-time scoring record - was unexpectedly sidelined due to ankle soreness. Reports now allege that Damon Jones, a close friend and former teammate of LeBron, shared confidential details about the superstar’s injury before it was publicly announced.Though Damon Jones never held an official position with the Lakers, he was reportedly in contact with individuals who placed significant bets on the Bucks after receiving early word that LeBron would miss the game. The indictment claims Jones tipped off his associates - identified as Eric Earnest and Marves Fairley - through text messages, advising them to bet heavily on Milwaukee. This inside information gave the bettors an unfair edge since LeBron James had not yet appeared on any injury report at the time the bets were made. LeBron James ultimately sat out against the Bucks and missed two additional games before returning on February 15, 2023, just before the All-Star break. The Lakers, dealing with roster changes following the D’Angelo Russell trade and other moves, fell to Milwaukee 115 - 106.Investigators allege that this incident was not an isolated case. Jones is believed to have shared further insights into Lakers team matters during the 2023-24 season, including details about an unnamed “Player 4,” described in the Department of Justice filings as one of the team’s top contributors. These leaks allegedly fueled a pattern of profitable betting activities over multiple seasons.With an 11-year NBA career and a coaching tenure under Tyronn Lue in Cleveland, Damon Jones was once a respected figure in the basketball community. That reputation has since crumbled following his arrest as part of a sweeping federal crackdown on illegal gambling. Alongside Jones, several other NBA personalities - including Miami Heat guard Terry Rozier and Portland Trail Blazers head coach Chauncey Billups - have been caught in the FBI’s widening investigation.The charges against Damon Jones accuse him of using privileged information about player injuries and availability to influence betting outcomes. Prosecutors allege he “sold or attempted to profit from non-public information,” violating multiple federal statutes. The broader investigation uncovered a multi-year scheme stretching from late 2022 to 2024, revealing widespread misuse of confidential NBA information for betting purposes.The scandal extends far beyond Damon Jones. The FBI has unearthed connections between NBA insiders and mafia-linked poker operations, exposing the darker side of sports wagering. Previous findings from the same probe led to the lifetime ban of Toronto Raptors forward Jontay Porter for leaking confidential data to gamblers to settle debts.While Damon Jones never officially worked for the Lakers, his friendship with LeBron James and his frequent presence around the team magnified the controversy. The situation has sparked debate about whether teams should impose stricter boundaries on non-staff access and how the league should address ethical breaches involving insider information.Reactions from fans and analysts have been explosive. Many expressed disbelief that a figure so close to LeBron James could be involved in such misconduct, while others voiced concerns that this case might only be scratching the surface of a deeper issue within the league. Social media platforms erupted with speculation about how pervasive insider leaks might be and what the long-term impact could be on the sport’s credibility. Some fans lamented that the growing normalization of sports betting has blurred ethical lines across professional basketball.The allegations surrounding Damon Jones and his use of inside information about LeBron James’ 2023 ankle injury represent a defining moment in the NBA’s modern era. This case highlights the fragility of integrity in an environment increasingly influenced by betting interests.As the federal investigation continues, questions loom over how the NBA will respond to safeguard the game’s reputation. For fans and players alike, this scandal underscores the risks of insider information being weaponized for financial gain - threatening not just individuals, but the fairness of the sport itself.Also read: All NBA teams and players arrested in massive illegal betting probe: FBI’s gambling investigation enters court phase, more arrests expected The saga is far from over, and its repercussions are likely to shape how the NBA governs gambling-related conduct for years to come.","Damon Jones, a former NBA player and coach, has been charged with using privileged information about player injuries to influence betting outcomes.

Broader implications for the NBA

What’s next





A major scandal has rocked the basketball world after federal indictments revealed that current and former NBA players, including a Hall of Fame coach, were allegedly tied to Mafia-linked gambling rings. The unsealed court documents expose two interconnected criminal networks involving illegal poker operations, sports betting manipulation, and financial fraud totalling tens of millions of dollars. The FBI and NYPD’s Joint Organized Crime Task Force coordinated the multi-year probe, which has now led to more than 30 arrests — among them, several high-profile NBA figures accused of leveraging insider access for profit and protection.Chauncey Billups, head coach of the Portland Trail Blazers and a Basketball Hall of Fame inductee, was among the most prominent figures arrested. According to investigators, Billups was allegedly involved in an underground poker network connected to organised crime families, where games were said to be fixed in exchange for payouts and influence.Terry Rozier, a guard for the Miami Heat, was also detained in connection with a separate but related illegal sports betting ring.Authorities claim Rozier participated in insider betting schemes, allegedly sharing or exploiting confidential game information to gain advantage in wagers.Damon Jones, a former NBA player and assistant coach, was arrested alongside Billups for his alleged role in the same poker operation. Both were charged with conspiracy, wire fraud, and gambling-related offences.These three names mark the most high-profile NBA links in what investigators describe as a “multi-layered criminal enterprise” blending professional sports, organised crime, and financial deception.According to federal prosecutors, the operations functioned in two layers: an underground poker ring frequented by professional athletes and an illegal sports betting network that allegedly exploited NBA insider data. Mafia intermediaries reportedly financed, protected, and profited from both systems. The investigation uncovered the use of offshore betting accounts, money laundering channels, and encrypted communication apps to conceal transactions.The FBI described the schemes as “sophisticated but deeply corrosive to the integrity of sports,” suggesting that some games may have been influenced by betting activity, though no direct evidence of match-fixing has yet been released.At a press conference in Brooklyn, FBI Director Kash Patel called the scale of the operation “mind-boggling,” noting that “tens of millions of dollars” were laundered through the network. Federal agents said the indictments were the culmination of years of surveillance and financial tracking, supported by the NYPD and the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York.Prosecutors emphasised that while the investigation remains ongoing, more arrests may follow as evidence is reviewed. “This case shows that even elite athletes and coaches are not beyond the reach of organised crime when greed meets access,” Patel said.The scandal has reignited long-standing concerns about gambling’s influence on professional sports, especially after the legalisation of sports betting across much of the United States. NBA officials have yet to issue a formal disciplinary response but confirmed that they are cooperating fully with federal authorities.Sports law experts say the case could prompt tighter league oversight, mandatory financial disclosures, and stricter betting regulations for players and staff. It also raises uncomfortable questions about the vulnerability of athletes to high-stakes gambling culture — one increasingly entwined with mainstream entertainment and sponsorship.The defendants, including Billups, Rozier, and Jones, are expected to appear in federal court in the coming weeks. If convicted, they could face substantial fines, suspensions, and potential prison sentences depending on the severity of their charges.","FBI and NYPD’s Joint Organized Crime Task Force coordinated the multi-year probe, which has now led to more than 30 arrests.

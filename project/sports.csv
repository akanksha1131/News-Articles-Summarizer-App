The IPL is the engine that drives India’s might in world cricket. Over the last 17 years, it has generated mind-numbing revenues besides being a talent-spinning tool in Indian cricket. Yet, it’s hard to dismiss the franchise-vs-country debate every time the IPL season comes around. Jasprit Bumrah ’s half-walk-half-hop run-up and Mohammed Shami ’s smooth approach towards the bowling crease may be a pulsating viewing experience, but there’s persisting apprehension over their fitness.India’s Test cricket is at a crossroads currently. With a five-Test tour scheduled to start 25 days after the IPL final, all eyes will be on Bumrah, Shami and other prospective pacers over the next two months. The window would have been shorter had India qualified for the World Test Championship (WTC) final.First things first. Bumrah is yet to obtain a fitness certificate from BCCI medical team at the Centre of Excellence (CoE) in Bengaluru. He hasn’t taken the field for India since he was forced out due to injury in the first innings of Sydney Test in the first week of Jan.Shami appears to have regained some rhythm during the victorious Champions Trophy campaign after having missed 14 months of cricket.There’s unease in BCCI over how the medical team has dealt with injuries in the last few years. The board is in process of overhauling its medical team once incumbent head Nitin Patel finishes his notice period this month. The concern is the medical team has been reluctant to be accountable while declaring a player’s fitness. It’s often left to selectors who are just told that the player is clinically fit. Whether the player is match-fit is not known.‘Workload management’ has been the catchphrase in Indian cricket in the last decade. Yet, the IPL becomes an exception when the players walk into their franchises. The franchises dole out huge money for two months of service. There’s very little wiggle room once the BCCI clears the players from its CoE (formerly the National Cricket Academy).It’s not just about Bumrah who is expected to start his IPL campaign for Mumbai Indians in the second week of April. There’s Akash Deep, who too is undergoing rehab at the CoE. Harshit Rana, identified as India’s next frontline pacer, has endured a long season going into the IPL.The core focus of workload management has revolved around injury management in the last three years. But the results of treating recurrent injuries have not been inspiring enough.When it comes to the IPL, BCCI’s role ends once they give all-clear to a player who had earlier reported with an injury. The franchise’s in-house medical team takes over once the players get into an IPL season. The question is, does BCCI lose all rights over the players? Not really.The introduction of standardised workload management SOPs and wearable devices keep providing all the data. The contracted BCCI players are given Athlete Management System (AMS) vests and the whoop bands (which are worn as watches on the wrists). These devices offer enough data about their physical activities, recovery and sleep cycle. The BCCI trusts its players.Bumrah, per se, has been through all kinds of rehab and training routines. BCCI’s medical team devises personalised routines according to data of a player. The players adhere to it and routines are usually shared with the franchise’ physios and strength and conditioning coaches.Sources close to India’s team management and selectors say they trust the judgement of a player whenever the player feels any kind of discomfort.“The players, especially the bowlers, are well educated. They understand what’s at stake for them. One has to go by the player’s instinct,” a BCCI source told TOI.For all the talk about whether a player of Bumrah’s stature should put his body through the thankless schedule of the IPL, the bottom line says it’s the BCCI medical team’s responsibility to ensure a player is always available to play if he is not injured.",Jasprit Bumrah is yet to obtain a fitness certificate from BCCI medical team at the Centre of Excellence (CoE) in Bengaluru. He hasn’t taken the field for India since he was forced out due to injury in the first innings of Sydney Test in first week of Jan. Shami appears to have regained some rhythm during the victorious Champions Trophy campaign after having missed 14 months of cricket.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119236327,imgsize-58630,width-400,resizemode-4/119236327.jpg"

As the IPL 2025 season approaches, the excitement isn’t just about the familiar superstars, it’s also about the fresh wave of Indian talent ready to set the stage on fire. Every season, the league brings to light new heroes, young cricketers who grab the spotlight with fearless batting, breathtaking spells, and game-changing performances. This year is no different.TOI picks the hopefuls who are primed to make their mark in the showpiece T20 extravaganza.Musheer, a 20-year-old all-rounder, joined Punjab Kings for Rs 30 lakh, bringing versatility to the table with his right-hand top-order batting and left-arm spin. The younger brother of Sarfaraz Khan, Musheer shot to limelight in the 2024 U-19 World Cup. He began his Ranji Trophy career with a bang, hitting a double-century for Mumbai last year. His T20 numbers are modest but growing. Punjab Kings, under new captain Shreyas Iyer and coach Ricky Ponting, aim to rebuild and Musheer’s adaptability could see him slot into the middle-order or serve as a fifth bowling option on spin-friendly pitches. His multiple skills make him a sleeper pick for IPL 2025, especially if PBKS lean on youth to turn their fortunes around.Known for his explosive batting style, Minz can change the course of a game within a few overs. The left-handed wicketkeeperbatsman was acquired by Mumbai Indians at the IPL 2025 auction at a steal deal of Rs 65 lakh. MI’s scouting network identified his potential early on, and the franchise is optimistic about his impact in the upcoming season. With Ishan Kishan not there in the MI set-up this time, Minz’ power game aligns with MI’s tradition of big hitters and can be a like-forlike replacement for Kishan. The 22-year-old has played just two first-class matches up till now, but his exploits in agegroup tournaments for Jharkhand have marked him as a player with a high ceiling.Andre Siddarth, 18, has made heads turn in the domestic circuit, earning high praise from several quarters. In a podcast, former India offspinner R Ashwin couldn’t stop gushing about Siddarth. His consistent performances in the Tamil Nadu Premier League caught the attention of CSK talent scouts who brought him into their fold. Under Ruturaj Gaikwad’s captaincy and MS Dhoni’s mentorship, Siddarth could thrive in CSK’s supportive environment. While he might not get immediate game time given CSK’s strong batting lineup, his domestic performances suggest he’s ready to step up if called upon. His knack for playing spin could see him thrive on Chepauk’s turning tracks.A dynamic batsman known for his quick-scoring ability, Rizvi is a potential match-winner for the Capitals. The 21-yearold’s breakthrough moment came during the Uttar Pradesh T20 League in 2023, where he made headlines by scoring an impressive 455 runs in just nine innings at a staggering strike-rate of 188.80. He hit 35 sixes and scored the fastest century (off just 47 balls) of the tournament. This remarkable form led to a fierce bidding war during the 2024 IPL auction, culminating in CSK securing his services for a substantial Rs 8.4 crore. Although his debut season saw limited success with only 51 runs in five innings, his potential remained undiminished. As he transitions to IPL 2025 with the Capitals after being acquired for Rs 95 lakh, Rizvi’s explosive batting style could see him play a crucial role for DC this season.A promising right-arm pacer and allrounder from Haryana, Kamboj was signed by CSK for Rs 3.40 crore during the IPL 2025 auction – a significant increase from his base price of Rs 20 lakh. Standing at 6 feet 2 inches, the 24-year-old can swing the new ball both ways. His height allows him to extract extra bounce from the pitch, posing a significant challenge for the batters. A historic moment came in Kamboj’s career came in Nov 2024, when he made headlines by becoming the third bowler in the history of Ranji Trophy to take all 10 wickets in an innings. He achieved the feat during Haryana’s match against Kerala in Rohtak registering figures of 10/49 in 30.1 overs. Additionally, his lower-order hitting ability adds depth to the batting lineup.The 13-year-old cricketing prodigy from Bihar took Indian cricket by storm when he was picked by Rajasthan Royals for Rs 1.10 crore at the IPL mega auction in Nov last year. Suryavanshi made headlines as the youngest player ever in IPL history, sparking both excitement and scepticism. His meteoric rise includes remarkable feats like a 58-ball century for India U-19 against Australia U-19, the fastest by an Indian in youth Tests, and a blistering 71 off 42 balls in the Vijay Hazare Trophy. Vaibhav’s journey began in Tajpur village, part of Samastipur district in Bihar, where his father Sanjeev, a farmer, nurtured his talent with backyard practice. By age 9, he joined a cricket academy in Samastipur, and at 12, he debuted in the Ranji Trophy, becoming the second youngest player to participate in the tournament. An attacking lefthanded batsman, Vaibhav’s inclusion could depend on injuries or tactical shifts, possibly as an Impact Player.","The IPL 2025 season kicks off on February 14 in Mumbai. ToI picks the young stars who are primed to make their mark in the showpiece T20 extravaganza. Musheer Khan, Robin Minz, Sameer Rizvi, Andre Siddarth, Anshul Kamboj, Vaibhav Suryavanshi, Haryana Rana are among the hopefuls.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119236904,imgsize-60482,width-400,resizemode-4/119236904.jpg"

‘All players have to play in domestic tournaments’

IPL: How will GT, LSG, DC, PBKS, RR fare? Greenstone Lobo predicts

'Nitin Patel's contract extended for 3 months'

MUMBAI: Even as India's senior players have hinted at their reservations against the SOPs in the policy towards their family on overseas tours, the Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ) remains firm that the newly-formulated policy will stay in place.In a conversation with TOI on Wednesday, BCCI secretary Devajit Saikia asserted that the Board policy is not something which had been suddenly introduced, but something which was always around.""This policy has not been formulated overnight as it was in place for the past couple of decades, dating back to the playing days of our president, Roger Binny and maybe earlier thereto. The new policy is an amendment of the earlier one with some additions relating to presence of players practice sessions , course of the match, tours ; luggage, unison in team movements and other ancillary activities with an objective to achieve team cohesion and unity. In fact, under the new policy, the BCCI has enhanced the duration of the period of stay of the family members with players during an overseas tour with a handle for relaxation of the norms under special circumstances, however, through a process,"" Saikia told this paper.""The policy applies uniformly to all members of the team — players, coaches, manager, support staff and everyone in the team— and has been notified and implemented considering everyone’s best interests. The BCCI acknowledges that there may be some resentment or difference of opinions, as in a democratic setup, people are entitled to express their views. At this stage, the current policy will remain intact without any change, as it is of paramount importance for the nation and our institution, that is, the BCCI,"" said the BCCI secretary.The BCCI introduced the ten-pointer SOPs following India's 3-1 defeat in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy in Australia. Under the new policy, spouses and children (aged under 18) can accompany the members of the Indian contingent for up to two weeks if the tour lasts more than 45 days. This policy was first implemented during the recently-held Champions Trophy. However, some senior India players have expressed their displeasure regarding it.""If you ask any player, do you want your family to be around you all the time? You'll be like, yes. I don't want to go to my room and just sit alone and sulk. I want to be able to be normal. And then you can really treat your game as something that is a responsibility. You finish that responsibility, and you come back to life,"" former India captain Virat Kohli said in Bengaluru recently.Saikia also asserted that India’s contracted players will have to play in domestic cricket as and when they are available for them. “There’s another important point that we’ve added in our guidelines. All the players, when they are available, have to play in domestic tournaments. If any player wants to skip or avoid playing in any tournament or match in the domestic circuit, they have to take the approval of the (India) head coach (Gautam Gambhir) and the chairman of the selection committee (Ajit Agarkar). This has been done so that all the young players get a chance to play with the seniors. It will help the senior players in keeping in touch with the game, if they are not playing international matches,” the BCCI secretary said.Meanwhile, Saikia clarified that Nitin Patel, head of its Sports Science wing at the BCCI's new Centre of Excellence in Bengaluru did not resign, but is on a three-month extension, after his contract was over on Dec 31.""It has been wrongly reported by the media that Patel has resigned. His contract/tenure was over on Dec 31, 2024. Then we made him a special request to extend his tenure by three months, which he agreed to. His extended contract will be over by March 31, 2025. We are trying to get a new person (to replace him). We are in talks with a few people. We wanted Nitin to continue, but he's got a pressing personal (family) issue to attend to, so can't continue, so we will have an alternative person in his place,"" Saikia told TOI.","The Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ) remains firm that the newly- formulated policy will stay in place.

NEW DELHI: A small village, Budhana, in Uttar Pradesh was wrapped in an unfamiliar aroma of festivity. People turned up in numbers. Puja Tomar had become a queen overnight. Garland after garland was placed around her neck, flower petals showered down on her, and everyone pushed forward, eager for a handshake. It was as if she was a national hero. But, wasn't she?In June last year, Puja became the first Indian to win a UFC bout, beating Brazil’s Rayanne Amanda dos Santos in a razor-close split decision.For her, this wasn’t just a fight won in an octagon -- but a fight that began the day she was born.“My parents didn’t want me,” Puja tells TimesofIndia.com, not with bitterness, but a quiet defiance. “When I was born, my father fainted. They had already decided not to raise a third daughter. I was left in a pot, to die.”Puja Tomar was born in the village near Muzaffarnagar, where the value of a girl was often weighed against the eventual dowry.Her two elder sisters, Anjali and Anu, were already defying the odds: one became a nurse, the other an MBBS doctor. But Puja? She was the one nobody wanted.“I always felt I had to prove something. Not just to my family, but to the world. That a girl isn’t a burden.”Her earliest heroes, nevertheless, were not athletes or politicians -- they were the likes of Jackie Chan and the characters she saw on grainy YouTube videos.However, she didn’t watch them for entertainment. She watched to learn. By 12th grade, a local karate teacher came to her school. And that was all she needed.One day, in a karate match, seven-year-old Puja, always eager to throw a punch at boys, hit an opponent so hard they passed out. She was immediately disqualified.“This sport isn’t for you -- try something else,” she laughs. “But it felt like I was in a movie -- like Jackie Chan. I just knew I wanted to fight.”""I started off just wanting to beat boys up, but eventually realised this could be a proper sport,"" she adds.With Puja needing more freedom than karate could offer, her real break came through Wushu, a martial art that combines grace and combat.With her uncle’s help, she found her way to SAI Bhopal. She spent five years there, sharpening her craft.But when she was offered a job as a constable after years of training, it felt like an insult.“After everything, a constable’s job? I couldn’t accept that,” she says. “And my sister was in MBBS. She needed money. That’s when I heard about MMA .”No contracts. No pay. No guarantee. She fought anyway. Eventually, in Delhi, someone offered her money to fight. She said yes -- not for fame, but to pay tuition fees.From there, the 31-year-old puncher has now reached a point where she can easily spend around Rs 1.5 to 2 lakhs a month on her MMA team.Off the mat, she sketches. Her wall is covered in drawings and craftwork. “My hobbies are completely opposite of fighting,” she says, grinning. “But I love it. It keeps me grounded.”She prays before fights -- not to win, but to find clarity. Her training is brutal: two sessions a day, strict diet, intense drills. “Sometimes, the training is so hard I can’t even sleep. But I know it’s what it takes.”Her coach, Mike, helped her train through an ankle injury that delayed her upcoming fight. Now, she’s set to face Ireland’s Shauna Bannon on March 22 at UFC Fight Night 254 .“I’m mentally ready,” she says. “This is going to be a big year. My goal is to reach the top. I know I can bring the belt home.”Before her fight in Louisville, a Japanese interviewer asked her bluntly: “Do you really think Indian fighters can do anything outside cricket?”It stung.“I just smiled,” she says. “Because I wanted to show that India is not just cricket. We have fighters, too.”On June 8, 2024, she did just that. With a flurry of calculated strikes, relentless pressure, and heart, she edged out Santos in a historic decision. It wasn’t just her win, it was India’s.Back in her village, people wept in joy. Her mother now walks around proudly saying, “That’s my daughter.”ALSO SEE: The good and not so good about Sunil Chhetri's comeback ""My mom is proud and always excited to talk to the media,"" she adds.Her sisters -- one in scrubs, the other in a white coat -- cheered louder than anyone.Puja never got to prove herself to her father -- he passed away before she could. But in every punch, in every takedown, in every minute of every round, she carries that fire.“When I got older, my mom told me that when I was born, my dad fainted. They had kept me aside to let me die because they didn’t want another girl,"" she confesses. ""But when I cried, my mom pulled me out of that pot and decided to save me. I always carried that pain. I never imagined he (father) would pass away, but I always wanted to prove to him that the girl who made you faint, she’s capable of so much.""",Puja Tomar is the first Indian to win a UFC bout.

Will Rohit Sharma win 2027 World Cup? Astrologer Lobo predicts after getting Champions Trophy bang on!

NEW DELHI: In a move that could potentially influence global cricket, the Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ) is considering lifting the ban on applying saliva to the ball during the upcoming Indian Premier League (IPL) season, scheduled to commence on March 22.According to PTI, this proposal has been extensively discussed within the BCCI and will be presented to the captains of all IPL teams during a meeting in Mumbai on Thursday.The International Cricket Council (ICC) had initially prohibited the age-old practice of applying saliva to shine the ball as a precautionary measure during the COVID-19 pandemic.In 2022, the ICC made this ban permanent. While the IPL had adhered to the ICC's guidelines in the aftermath of the pandemic, its playing conditions are not bound by the sport's governing body.""Using saliva on the ball was part of the essence of the game until COVID hit. Now that we don't have that threat anymore, we feel there is no harm in lifting the ban on saliva in the IPL.""We understand that it makes a bigger impact in red-ball cricket but even if it can help bowlers a bit in the white ball game, it should be allowed in the IPL, which is a trend-setting tournament. Let's see what the captains decide tomorrow,"" a BCCI official told PTI.If the ban is revoked in the IPL, it could potentially influence the ICC to review its stance on the subject. Several prominent cricketers, including Mohammed Shami, Vernon Philander, and Tim Southee, have previously advocated for the use of saliva to aid reverse swing and maintain a balance between bat and ball.In addition to the saliva ban discussion, the IPL is set to approve the use of the Decision Review System (DRS) for height wides and wides outside the off-stump.This move aims to enhance the accuracy of wide ball decisions by utilising Hawk-Eye and ball-tracking technology.Teams will be allowed to review instances where the on-field umpire has signalled a wide ball for height, enabling them to challenge the decision if they believe the ball was not high enough to warrant a wide call.","The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) is considering lifting the ban on applying saliva to the ball during the upcoming Indian Premier League (IPL) season.

NEW DELHI: Sunil Chhetri made a remarkable comeback to the national team after retiring from international football in May last year. In a friendly match against Maldives on Wednesday, Chhetri's presence proved to be the catalyst for India's commanding 3-0 victory, helping the team snap their 12-match winless streak that had persisted since November 2023.The match unfolded with Rahul Bheke giving India the lead in the 35th minute, followed by Liston Colaco extending the advantage to 2-0 in the 66th minute.The 40-year-old Chhetri, who had returned to the national team, etched his name in the scoresheet with a glancing header in the 77th minute, marking his 95th international goal .Chhetri's impact was evident as he narrowly missed a scoring opportunity in the 47th minute, denied by the Maldives goalkeeper. He was eventually substituted in the 82nd minute, having made a memorable contribution to the team's victory.This triumph held significance as it marked India's first win in 16 months and the first under the guidance of Manolo Marquez , who was appointed as the head coach in July last year. India's previous victory came against Kuwait (1-0) in their 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifying round match in Kuwait City on November 16, 2023.The friendly match served as a dress rehearsal for India's crucial AFC Asian Cup qualifier against Bangladesh, scheduled for March 25 at the same venue. Chhetri's return to the national team was specifically aimed at aiding the team's successful navigation through the qualifiers.With Maldives ranked 162nd in the world, 36 places below India (126th), the match provided an opportunity for the Indian team to regain their winning momentum and prepare for the upcoming challenges in the AFC Asian Cup qualifiers .",India beat Maldives 3-0 in a friendly match on Wednesday.

IPL: How will GT, LSG, DC, PBKS, RR fare? Greenstone Lobo predicts

NEW DELHI: Kolkata Knight Riders ' home match against Lucknow Super Giants, scheduled for April 6 at Eden Gardens , faces the likelihood of rescheduling as local police have declined security clearance due to Ram Navami festivities. The situation stems from BJP leader Suvendu Adhikari 's announcement of over 20,000 processions across West Bengal during the festival, prompting heightened security measures statewide.Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) president Snehasish Ganguly confirmed after two discussions with the police on Tuesday that the authorities ""have not given the go-ahead"" for the match. He explained that they categorically stated they would not be able to provide adequate security, making it unfeasible to accommodate a crowd of 65,000 without police protection.The CAB has since informed the Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ) about the situation, with some time still available to make a final decision. Ganguly also pointed out that a similar scenario occurred last year when a scheduled IPL match on Ram Navami had to be rescheduled.""They have categorically said they won't be able to provide adequate security. If there's no police protection, accommodating a 65,000-strong crowd becomes impossible,"" Snehasish was quoted as saying by PTI. ""We have informed the BCCI, and there is still time to take a final call. Even last year, a scheduled IPL match on Ram Navami had to be rescheduled.""The anticipated clash between Kolkata Knight Riders and Lucknow Super Giants was expected to draw significant attendance, given the strong local following of both teams. With LSG owned by RPSG Group chairman Sanjiv Goenka, the match held considerable appeal for cricket enthusiasts in the region.Meanwhile, the 2025 IPL season is set to kick off at Eden Gardens on March 22, featuring defending champions KKR against Royal Challengers Bengaluru. The grand opening ceremony, which will last approximately 35 minutes, is expected to showcase performances by singer Shreya Ghoshal and actress Disha Patani. ICC chairman Jay Shah and other prominent dignitaries are expected to attend the event, marking the return of a grand opening ceremony at Eden Gardens after a long gap.Snehasish Ganguly expressed enthusiasm about the marquee match, noting that the demand for tickets has been overwhelming. He refrained from sharing more details about the opening ceremony but emphasised that preparations are in full swing to make it a memorable event.","Kolkata Knight Riders'home match against Lucknow Super Giants, scheduled for April 6 at Eden Gardens, faces the likelihood of rescheduling.

NEW DELHI: It’s been 17 years since Virat Kohli lifted the U-19 World Cup trophy. From that team, only Ravindra Jadeja, Manish Pandey and Kohli are still active in the IPL. This season, they will be reuniting with one more of their teammates when Tanmay Srivastava makes his debut as a BCCI-qualified umpire.Incidentally, Srivastava was India’s top-scorer in the U-19 World Cup final against South Africa in 2008, which earned him a contract with Kings XI Punjab. Srivastava has been fast-tracked as an umpire by the BCCI after clearing the Level 2 course in two years. At 35, he is set to earn the distinction of becoming the first player to have both played and officiated in the IPL.For now, he hasn’t been given on-field duties this season. While most players from the batch have recently retired or are no longer active in top-level cricket , Srivastava decided to retire as a player in 2020 while he was captaining Uttarakhand after moving from UP at the age of 30.“I understood that was the best player I could be,” Srivastava told TOI. “I was nowhere close to playing the IPL. I had to decide if I wanted to prolong life as a player or have a longer successful second innings.”Srivastava admits it was about swallowing his ego. “I am still in touch with Virat, but I had to decide for myself and have a practical outlook,” he added.It was an honest discussion with current BCCI vice-president Rajiv Shukla, a UP cricket mainstay, that gave him clarity.“I told Shukla sir that I wanted to do something else in cricket other than playing. He was a bit taken aback since I was still just 30. Then we discussed what the options could be. I did my Level 2 course in coaching in NCA, but I knew the best I could become was fielding coach. I decided to focus on umpiring,” Srivastava said.In 2020, when he was preparing for the umpiring exams, Srivastava juggled cricketing jobs, a talent scout for RCB and fielding coach for U-16s at NCA and for Jammu and Kashmir.“Studying for umpiring is tough. I used to stay up at nights. You have to study a lot to understand the laws and its implications,” he said.Srivastava credits the BCCI’s umpiring programme, which has a players’ quota.“There is certain relaxation for players irrespective of the level of cricket they’ve played. The board is encouraging young players to take up umpiring rather than heavily depending on older people with bookish knowledge,” he said.",Tanmay Srivastava will make his IPL debut as a BCCI-qualified umpire. The 35-year-old was India’s top-scorer in the U-19 World Cup final against South Africa in 2008. He has been fast-tracked as an umpire by the BCCI.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119188024,imgsize-122460,width-400,resizemode-4/119188024.jpg"

The Bombay High Court granted a request from Indian cricketer Yuzvendra Chahal and his estranged wife, Dhanashree Verma , to waive the six-month cooling-off period required under Section 13B of the Hindu Marriage Act for a divorce decree.Justice Madhav Jamdar, the presiding judge, instructed the family court to expedite the divorce petition and reach a decision by the next day, given Chahal's participation in the upcoming Indian Premier League ( IPL ).The judge noted that Chahal might not be available after March 21 due to his IPL commitments with the Punjab Kings, which begins on March 22.""As the petitioner No 1 (Chahal) is a participant of IPL, the advocate informs that he may not be available post March 21. The family court is hence requested to decide their divorce plea by tomorrow (March 20),"" HC said.The court's decision followed acknowledgment of the couple's separation for over two and a half years and the compliance with consent terms reached during mediation concerning alimony payments.Under Section 13B(2), a mutual divorce petition can typically only be considered after six months from its filing. This cooling-off period is intended to allow time for possible reconciliation. However, a Supreme Court ruling in 2017 indicated that this period could be waived when there is no chance for settlement.Chahal and Verma married in December 2020 but separated in June 2022. They submitted a joint petition for divorce on February 5, requesting both mutual consent and the waiver of the cooling-off period.On February 20, the family court denied their request, citing incomplete compliance with the alimony agreement, as Chahal had only paid Rs 2.37 crores of the Rs 4.75 crore owed. A marriage counselor’s report also indicated partial adherence to mediation efforts, prompting their appeal to the High Court.The High Court concluded that there was compliance with the consent terms since the second installment of alimony was contingent upon the divorce decree. Consequently, the court annulled the family court's February 20 order and approved their request.","Indian cricketer Yuzvendra Chahal and his estranged wife, Dhanashree Verma, asked the Bombay High Court to waive the six-month cooling-off period required under Section 13B of the Hindu Marriage Act for a divorce decree.

Will Rohit Sharma win 2027 World Cup? Astrologer Lobo predicts after getting Champions Trophy bang on!

NEW DELHI: India cricket legend Sunil Gavaskar has praised the incredible depth of Indian cricket following the team's unbeaten run to the 2025 Champions Trophy title, achieved even without ace pacer Jasprit Bumrah . Reflecting on the triumph, Gavaskar made a bold claim that no individual player is indispensable in the current Indian lineup — not even veteran batters Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma Writing in his column for Mid-Day, Gavaskar remarked, ""The triumph in the Champions Trophy and that too without Bumrah also emphasises that nobody is indispensable in this game. In the past too, India has won without Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli, but there’s not the slightest doubt that their presence in the team gives the team an even more invincible look.""Gavaskar lauded Team India ’s resilience after bouncing back from a dismal Test series defeat against Australia to clinch victory in the England T20Is and ODIs, followed by the Champions Trophy. He noted how the team’s ability to triumph without their key players showcased the immense talent pool in Indian cricket.""Very seldom has a team depended on one individual like the Indians depended on Jasprit Bumrah in Australia, and his absence from the bowling attack to defend the small target set by India tilted the scales Australia’s way,"" Gavaskar said. ""For the Indian team to bounce back the way they did with comprehensive wins in the ODI and T20 series against England that were played on the team’s return to India tells volumes of the talent that Indian cricket has.""The cricketing great also acknowledged the support from overseas players, who admitted that India would have emerged victorious regardless of the location, dismissing claims that the Dubai setting played a decisive role. ""It is good to see so many overseas cricketers now coming up and saying India would have won anyway wherever they played and not only because they were stationed in Dubai,"" Gavaskar added.Gavaskar’s remarks reflect a sense of confidence in the current Indian setup, asserting that while legends like Kohli and Rohit undeniably elevate the team, the core strength lies in the depth and talent of the entire squad.","India cricket legend Sunil Gavaskar has praised the incredible depth of Indian cricket following the team's unbeaten run to the 2025 Champions Trophy title.

The downfall of cricket in Pakistan has led to growing concerns among the sport's fraternity, with former players and experts worried about the game not moving ""in the right direction"" in the country.Pakistan were eliminated in the early stages of the last three ICC white-ball tournaments -- the 2023 ODI World Cup, the T20 World Cup in 2024 and the Champions Trophy at home this year.Expressing his concern, former Pakistan captain and chief selector Inzamam-ul-Haq blamed the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) for not making the right calls and forcing frequent changes in the team.""I would think that the cricket board now needs to learn from its mistakes and not repeat the same mistakes we have made in the last two years,"" Inzamam told reporters, as quoted by local publication 'Dawn'.""In the past two years, the performance of the Pakistan team has been on a decline.

""If there are constant changes, players won't gain the confidence they need, and the situation will remain the same.""Inzamam also threw his weight behind the under-fire former captain Babar Azam , who has been going through a lean patch in all forms of cricket and being heavily criticised.""Babar Azam is a top player.

BENGALURU: In March 2008, Royal Challengers Bangalore ( RCB ) cashed in on Delhi Daredevils’ lack of interest in signing Virat Kohli for the opening Indian Premier League . Seventeen seasons on, it’s still Delhi’s loss and Bengaluru’s gain. Perhaps, Delhi could be forgiven for the oversight.Teenager Kohli was explosive batting prowess, but all raw emotion. That hasn’t changed as the IPL enters its 18th edition this weekend. However, in the intervening period, the now 36-year-old has gone from unabashed teen to cricket great.Kohli has led the Indian teams across formats and RCB for several seasons. He is only the third player after Sachin Tendulkar and Jasprit Bumrah (both Mumbai Indians) to play for a single franchise. He insists RCB will be his only IPL team.Age and experience have failed to dim Kohli’s hunger. His appetite for excellence and success has not wavered. Kohli, at a RCB summit recently, said his emotions have sobered while his competitive spirit still bubbles.“Things are happening naturally with me; it’s getting tapered down. My competitiveness has not waned. A lot of people find it very difficult to process how competitiveness remains at the same level if the aggression does not. You can still be aggressive in your mind, but you don’t need to express it every now and then out of frustration, which I have,” he strove to explain.And while the batting star has nothing left to prove, one aspect would rankle: The lack of an IPL trophy in his chest of spoils. RCB have made it to the final thrice, yet the trophy has eluded them.This year, Kohli will play under captain Rajat Patidar. At a time when he was expected to lead himself, Kohli has thrown his weight behind Patidar. AB de Villiers, RCB’s lynchpin with Kohli till not long ago, believes Kohli’s leadership, sans the captaincy title, is crucial for this season.“All Virat needs to do is what he’s been doing for years: Control the game,” he told JioHotstar. “He should be the ‘captain of the batting department’ title this season.""",Virat Kohli will play for Royal Challengers Bangalore in the 18th edition of the Indian Premier League.

CHALLENGES FOR NEW CAPTAINS AXAR AND PATIDAR

NEW DELHI: The upcoming IPL season might give cricket fans another glimpse of MS Dhoni ’s brilliance, as the former Chennai Super Kings ( CSK ) captain is expected to bat lower in the order at No. 7 or No. 8. According to former India batter Robin Uthappa , this strategy would allow Dhoni to maximize his impact in a limited number of deliveries.At 43, Dhoni has shown no signs of slowing down, proving his readiness for IPL 2025 during a CSK net session on Tuesday. In a display of his signature power-hitting, he launched a searing yorker from Matheesha Pathirana over the bowler’s head with his trademark helicopter shot.""As far as Mahi is concerned, I think we will get to see glimpses of his brilliance because I have a feeling that he might bat at number 7 or number 8. Very much like last year, and we will see him bat between 12 and 20 balls through the season,"" Uthappa said.However, when asked if this would be Dhoni’s final IPL season, Uthappa remained non-committal.""I don't think the passion ever dies. MS' love for the game has not dwindled at all. I think his passion for the game keeps him going. At 43, I think he's got the fastest hands in the world as a wicketkeeper.""And if you've got those skills and if you've got the passion to keep going, I don't think anything should stop you. I won't be surprised if he retires at the end of the season. But I won't be surprised if he even goes on to play for another four seasons after this,"" Uthappa, a JioStar expert, said while addressing the media before the start of IPL 2025.The IPL 2025 season will also mark the return of Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma to the T20 format for the first time since India’s T20 World Cup triumph in 2024.Uthappa believes both veteran batters are set for an excellent season.""I don't think they'll have even an iota of issues to come out there and smash the living daylights out of bowlers. Virat has really come through in good form. He's familiar with conditions in Bangalore, and he's always going to thrive there,"" he said.""In the recent past, Rohit hasn't lived up to his potential as the incredibly dynamic batter that he is in the IPL. But it looks like everything is going his way at this point in time. So, I wouldn't put it past him to have one of his best seasons in the IPL,"" Uthappa added.This IPL season will also see first-time captains leading franchises, with Axar Patel taking charge of Delhi Capitals and Rajat Patidar captaining Royal Challengers Bengaluru.Uthappa acknowledged the challenges ahead for the two young skippers but expressed confidence in their ability to adapt.""Axar will be in a little bit better stead because even with the new-ish side, there are still a lot of familiar faces. With Rajat also, it's a similar situation. But Rajat will have to contend with the superstardom of Kohli within that side. So, he can lean on Kohli's captaincy skills a lot. Rajat is in a unique position to be able to take RCB forward.""Rajat being there at the helm right now, he will have to figure out his mode of leadership. He has done fairly well with leadership in domestic cricket.""Another major challenge for both captains will be managing their bowlers in high-scoring venues like Bengaluru and Delhi, where shorter boundaries often negate home-ground advantages.""The challenges would be home conditions. How do you win in home conditions? Especially both in these similar venues like Delhi and in Bangalore—small grounds, high-scoring grounds, no real home advantage.""So, they'll have to figure out a solution for that as leaders. For me, I think that would be one of the biggest challenges that they would face,"" Uthappa said.",Robin Uthappa says MS Dhoni will bat at No. 7 or No. 8 in IPL 2025. The former Chennai Super Kings ( CSK ) captain is expected to bat lower in the order. Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma return to the T20 format for the first time since India’s T20 World Cup triumph in 2024.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119217040,imgsize-49150,width-400,resizemode-4/119217040.jpg"

IPL: Delhi Capitals will win trophy this year, says Abishek Porel

IPL 2025 | It is exciting to be back with KL Rahul: Karun Nair

DC's Best XI:

SQUAD:

NEW DELHI: Delhi Capitals head into the IPL 2025 season with renewed hope under new captain Axar Patel , following Rishabh Pant’s move to Lucknow Super Giants. With fresh faces and a star-studded lineup, the team is determined to claim the elusive IPL trophy. Despite being a consistent contender, Delhi Capitals have reached the final only once—in 2020—when they fell short against Mumbai Indians, losing by five wickets.Can captain Axar change their fortunes?One of the standout signings for Delhi Capitals this season is the dynamic keeper-batter KL Rahul , who was bought for Rs 14 crores.The team’s pace attack has been bolstered by the inclusion of Australian pacer Mitchell Starc , making their bowling department a force to be reckoned with. Starc will be supported by T. Natarajan, Mukesh Kumar, and Mohit Sharma in the pace department.In the batting department, Delhi Capitals boast of hard-hitting veteran Faf Du Plessis, KL Rahul, Tristan Stubbs, Jake Fraser-McGurk, Karun Nair, and Ashutosh Sharma—who was a standout performer last year while playing for Punjab Kings.The spin department will be led by captain Axar Patel and Chinaman bowler Kuldeep Yadav, both of whom were part of India's victorious campaign at the ICC Champions Trophy 2025, along with KL Rahul.The team has also made significant changes to its support staff, with Venugopal Rao as the Director of Cricket, Hemang Badani as the Head Coach, Kevin Pietersen as the Mentor, Matthew Mott as the Assistant Coach, Munaf Patel as the Bowling Coach, Anton Roux as the Fielding Coach, and Vijay Bharadwaj as the Head of Scouting.TimesofIndia.com presents a SWOT analysis of Delhi Capitals ahead of IPL 2025:Delhi Capitals undoubtedly boast an explosive batting lineup on paper. With Faf Du Plessis, Fraser-McGurk, KL Rahul, Abishek Porel, and Tristan Stubbs forming a powerful top order, they have the potential to make a strong start right from the first ball. The middle order, featuring Karun Nair, Sameer Rizvi, Ashutosh Sharma, and captain Axar Patel, has the ability to turn the game around at any given moment.The pace attack is equally formidable, with one of the world’s top left-arm pacers, Mitchell Starc, leading the charge.Alongside him, T. Natarajan, the death-overs specialist, Dushmantha Chameera, the rejuvenated Mohit Sharma, and Mukesh Kumar strengthen the pace department.However, Delhi Capitals' primary weakness lies in their spin options.While Axar Patel and Kuldeep Yadav are experienced, the team lacks depth in this department. To address this, they have signed uncapped Indian spinner Ajay Mandal, offering some potential for the spin attack.Jake Fraser-McGurk, Faf du Plessis, KL Rahul, Abishek Porel (wk), Axar Patel (c), Tristan Stubbs, Mitchell Starc, Kuldeep Yadav, Mukesh Kumar, Mohit Sharma, T NatarajanFaf du Plessis, Karun Nair, Jake Fraser-McGurk, Sameer Rizvi, Ashutosh Sharma, Tripurana Vijay, Vipraj Nigam, Axar Patel, Darshan Nalkande, Ajay Jadav Mandal, Manvanth Kumar L, Madhav Tiwari, Tristan Stubbs, Abishek Porel, Donovan Ferreira, KL Rahul, Kuldeep Yadav, Dushmantha Chameera, Mitchell Starc, Mohit Sharma, T Natarajan, Mukesh Kumar","Delhi Capitals have reached the final of the IPL only once, in 2020.

Last year, we came very close on a few occasions. The Impact Player rule adds excitement and makes the IPL even more entertaining. One of the best aspects of the IPL is that every day, a new player emerges as a star,"" Gill told JioHotstar.The 2024 IPL season witnessed unprecedented batting achievements, including Punjab Kings' successful pursuit of 262 against Kolkata Knight Riders. Additionally, Sunrisers Hyderabad established new records by scoring 287/3 against Royal Challengers Bengaluru and achieving the highest power-play score of 125/0 when facing Delhi Capitals.“You constantly witness underrated talents delivering exceptional performances. The tournament's structure, with frequent matches and travel, keeps players engaged. If you're winning, the momentum carries you forward, with three, four, or even five consecutive victories. However, injuries can make things difficult,"" the GT captain added.Gujarat Titans will begin their IPL 2025 campaign against Punjab Kings at Ahmedabad's Narendra Modi Stadium. Gill discussed the capabilities of his squad, who clinched the IPL title in their inaugural appearance in 2022.""We have a strong fast-bowling attack. Rashid has been with us, and we have explosive batters like Rutherford, Philips, and Butler. Some talented Indian players like Mahipal and Sai add depth to our squad. The key to success in a long tournament like the IPL is maintaining balance,"" Gill said.""Losing two or three matches in a row isn't a major concern if you are playing the right way and making smart decisions. Consistency in team selection and strategy is important. The more you play based on probability and logic, the better your chances of qualifying (for the playoffs).""","Gujarat Titans' captain Shubman Gill predicts that the coming Indian Premier League IPL season could might well see one of the teams putting up a total of 300 on the board.

SHILLONG: India’s friendly international against Maldives here has gathered more firsts than it promised. When the schedule for India’s matches in this FIFA international window was announced, Wednesday’s friendly was marked as the first time that the senior national team will play in Meghalaya’s capital, ahead of their more important 2027 AFC Asian Cup Qualifier against Bangladesh next week.More than the match being the first of its kind in Shillong, however, is Sunil Chhetri ’s comeback in national colours. As the 40-year-old is ready to play his 152th international game, after being coaxed out of retirement by the India head coach Manolo Marquez earlier this month, all focus and talk around the game has been around Chhetri.On Tuesday, Marquez confirmed that India’s all-time leading scorer, who has been training with the team here since Saturday, will have a part to play against Maldives.“For sure, he will play some minutes. I don’t know whether as a starter or from the bench. We can use six substitutions, so 17 players can play, Sunil will be one of them,” said Marquez. “Sunil is the Indian player with the most goals this season. It doesn’t matter if a player is 20, 40, or my grandfather at 87. If they are in better shape, they will be here,” the Spaniard asserted.“The national team is not about developing players. Developed players have to arrive here. The main team needs to win games. And if we need to win games, we need to call players who are in better shape.”With his first competitive game since becoming India coach in July last year just a week away, Marquez is banking on the Maldives friendly as an opportunity to take stock and assess his combination before the March 25 Asian Cup qualifier.“It’s a friendly game to prepare for the Asian Cup qualifier. We knew that the target during the previous FIFA windows was to arrive in the best possible condition against Bangladesh next Tuesday. I don’t think we will play with the same team against Bangladesh that will play tomorrow. Obviously, you can’t change all 11. Some will repeat. It has to be a good game and a good preparation for Bangladesh,” said the coach.Maldives, who had reportedly requested to shift this match out of Shillong due to logistical issues earlier, will be using the friendly to prepare for their Asian Cup qualifier against Philippines next Tuesday.",India face Maldives in a friendly international in Shillong on Wednesday.

However, Argentine media reports suggest that the star forward suffered a sore left thigh during Inter Miami ’s 2-1 victory over Atlanta United in Major League Soccer (MLS) on Sunday. Messi played the full 90 minutes, scoring the opening goal in his return to the starting lineup after missing three consecutive matches due to ""load management.""Inter Miami manager Javier Mascherano , who has been cautious with Messi’s fitness throughout the MLS season, addressed the issue following the match against Atlanta United.""We tried to take away from the overload Messi had, so that it wouldn't go further than that. We tried to handle it in the best way. Luckily, we were able to control it and that it didn't turn into an injury or much more...

(AP)

History for Newcastle

Newcastle ended their 56-year trophy drought in stunning style as Dan Burn and Alexander Isak sealed a 2-1 win against Liverpool in the League Cup final on Sunday.Eddie Howe 's side made history at Wembley with a superb display that left the runaway Premier League leaders shell-shocked.Burn put Newcastle ahead late in the first half and Isak's 27th goal in all competitions doubled their lead after the interval.Federico Chiesa got one back in the closing seconds, but Newcastle held on for their first major silverware since the 1969 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup.That success in the predecessor to the Europa League is a relic of a bygone era, but this long-awaited triumph will be forever etched in the memories of the Newcastle fans who turned one half of Wembley into a roiling sea of black and white with their ecstatic celebrations.It was also Newcastle's first major domestic prize dating back 70 years to the 1955 FA Cup.Since the Magpies lifted the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, 30 different English teams had won silverware, while Liverpool had clinched 38 major trophies in that time.But after losing the 2023 League Cup final against Manchester United, Howe's team returned to Wembley and set the record straight at last.""We were well aware of the history and we wanted to do the club proud. We wanted to score, we wanted to perform and we wanted to win,"" Howe said.""We are breaking new ground. I thought we were magnificent today.""Newcastle had endured five relegations to the second tier since their last trophy, with club legends like Alan Shearer, Paul Gascoigne and Malcolm MacDonald failing to win silverware in their time on Tyneside.Aside from a brief period when Kevin Keegan's self-styled ""entertainers"" challenged for the title in the 1990s, Newcastle have endured decades of underachievement and self-inflicted wounds that rendered them a laughing stock for long periods.All that changed in 2021 when a Saudi-backed consortium completed a takeover from unpopular owner Mike Ashley and quickly hired Howe as their manager.Thanks to Howe's astute leadership and the Saudi financial backing, Newcastle have been transformed from relegation candidates to silverware winners.The defeat was another painful blow for Liverpool just days after their Champions League last 16 exit on penalties against Paris Saint-Germain.But despite failing to win their first trophy under boss Arne Slot, Liverpool still sit 12 points clear at the top of the Premier League, within touching distance of a record-equalling 20th English title.""It's a very disappointing result. The game went the way Newcastle wanted it. They deserved to win. We were out-played in their style. They won more aerial duels than us,"" Slot said.Liverpool are 23 points ahead of sixth-placed Newcastle in the league and hadn't lost to them for 17 games dating back to 2015.But Howe's men were in no mood to be cowed by past failuresNewcastle fans unveiled a banner before kick-off urging their team to ""write your name in the history books"".They rose to the challenge in spectacular fashion, snapping into tackles and counter-attacking with purpose, while Liverpool were sluggish and sloppy in possession.Newcastle's desire and drive was clear to see when Joelinton tracked back from midfield to stop Jarell Quansah in his tracks and celebrated with a fist-pumping roar.Despite nearly being caught out by Burn's aerial prowess earlier in the game, Liverpool failed to heed the warning as the towering centre-back put Newcastle ahead in the 45th minute.Bizarrely left unmarked, with only the diminutive Alex Mac Allister anywhere near him, Burn was allowed to rise unchallenged to meet Kieran Tripper's corner as he thumped a powerful header into far corner from 12 yards.Burn's goal -- Newcastle's first in a cup final since 1976 -- capped an incredible week for the journeyman centre-back, who received his first England call-up on Friday.With Liverpool talisman Mohamed Salah completely anonymous, the lethargic Reds had no answer as Isak put Newcastle into dreamland after 52 minutes.Newcastle dominated in the air again as Jacob Murphy met Tino Livramento's cross with a header that found Isak, who drilled a superb first-time finish past Caoimhin Kelleher from 10 yards.Chiesa's stoppage-time strike set up an anxious finale, but good things comes to those who wait.And all across Wembley, Newcastle players and fans celebrated with abandon as a party over half a century in the making got into full swing.",Newcastle beat Liverpool 2-1 in the League Cup final at Wembley Stadium.

Barcelona secured a dramatic 4-2 victory against Atletico Madrid after coming back from a two-goal deficit in Sunday's crucial Spanish league match .Lamine Yamal and Ferran Torres scored in stoppage time, helping Barcelona reclaim the top spot in the standings after Real Madrid had temporarily moved ahead following their win against Villarreal on Saturday.Barcelona and Real Madrid are now level on 60 points, with Barcelona holding a game in hand. Atletico Madrid sits four points behind the leaders following their home defeat against Hansi Flick's team, completing a disappointing week after their Champions League exit.""How we play, the confidence we have, it's really good to see. We will try everything to win trophies, the match today gives us more confidence,"" said Flick.Barcelona, who had previously suffered late setbacks against Atletico this season, turned the tables this time, extending their unbeaten run to 18 matches across all competitions.The match saw Julian Alvarez and Alexander Sorloth put Atletico ahead before Robert Lewandowski and Torres equalised for Barcelona, who ultimately secured victory in added time.""I think that after the anger, the feeling of impotence, not being comfortable in the game, we put our best foot forward and gave the best that we have. It was a very important game to win in the end, beating Atletico was a statement win, we put ourselves back as leaders having played a game fewer and we're very happy,"" Yamal told DAZN.Flick had earlier cautioned his players about maintaining focus, following a December incident where they conceded a 96th-minute goal to Atletico, losing their league lead in a 2-1 home defeat.Barcelona's first significant opportunity came near halftime when Pedri set up Lewandowski, whose powerful shot hit the crossbar.Atletico immediately capitalised on the subsequent goal kick, with Antoine Griezmann providing a brilliant pass to Giuliano Simeone, leading to Alvarez's opener.The goal provided some consolation for Alvarez, who had experienced disappointment earlier in the week when his penalty against Real Madrid was controversially disallowed during their Champions League elimination.Diego Simeone refreshed his team with substitutes following their Champions League exit, bringing on Sorloth and Conor Gallagher, who combined for Atletico's second goal.Griezmann played a crucial role in another well-executed team move, with Gallagher assisting Sorloth for his 11th league goal of the season.Barcelona quickly responded despite their protests about a Rodrigo De Paul handball being dismissed. Martinez launched an attack and found Lewandowski, who controlled well and scored.Torres then equalised after receiving a cross from Raphinha, before Yamal's deflected long-range effort put Barcelona ahead in stoppage time.""We have to congratulate our opponent, they had a good game and in the end were very effective with their chances. They had that bit of luck which you have to have, in the deflection for Yamal's goal for 3-2,"" said Simeone.Torres sealed the victory with his second goal in the closing moments.""It was a strange game because we did well in the first half, we had them under control and scored two goals... it's true the 120 minutes in the Champions League weighed on us, and in the end the team fell apart. We will fight to the end (for La Liga ), we have seen many times how things change, you have a good month and someone else has a bad one, and you turn it all around,"" said Atletico's Llorente.",Barcelona come from two goals down to beat Atletico Madrid 4-2 in La Liga.

Manchester United continued their upward trend with a 3-0 win at Leicester.A solitary goal from Mikel Merino settled an uninspiring match at the Emirates, helping Arsenal strengthen their second position and reduce Liverpool's advantage to 12 points.The absence of Cole Palmer through illness proved costly for Chelsea, who delivered a lacklustre performance that hampered their top-four aspirations.Despite maintaining fourth position presently, Chelsea face pressure from five clubs between Manchester City in fifth and Aston Villa in ninth, all within four points of Enzo Maresca's side.Arsenal's goalscoring difficulties have persisted since Kai Havertz's season-ending injury forced midfielder Merino to adopt a forward position. The Spanish international proved decisive from a corner, heading in Martin Odegaard's delivery at the far post after 20 minutes.Whilst Chelsea created few chances, they nearly equalised when David Raya mishandled Marc Cucurella's attempt, with the ball rolling wide.Robert Sanchez produced an excellent save to prevent Merino from scoring Arsenal's second, in what was the half's finest attempt.The match concluded quietly with minimal attacking threat, as the subdued display intensified criticism of Maresca's tactical approach amongst Chelsea supporters.""We did enough to deserve to win the game,"" said Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta. ""Now we have the international break so let's take a chance to breathe and bring some players back hopefully.""Tottenham, fresh from their Europa League quarter-final qualification against AZ Alkmaar on Thursday, experienced another post-European setback at Craven Cottage.Fulham's triumph elevates Marco Silva's team to eighth position, four points from fourth place and three behind fifth.A fifth-place finish should secure Champions League participation next season, owing to English clubs' strong European performances.Spurs have struggled with their Premier League form following European fixtures, winning just three of 10 league matches after Europa League games.Ange Postecoglou's team were second-best throughout, conceding in the 78th minute when Rodrigo Muniz converted Andreas Pereira's pass. Ryan Sessegnon sealed the victory against his previous club with an elegant finish.""It's been a difficult campaign for sure,"" said Spurs captain Son Heung-min.""But I feel we've lost too many games that we should have got stuff out of, and this was one of those games.""United extended their unbeaten streak in open play to seven matches with a convincing win over a struggling Leicester side.Rasmus Hojlund broke his 21-game goal drought by scoring to put United ahead in the 28th minute.Alejandro Garnacho had to be patient for his first goal since November, having been flagged offside early in the second half. However, he eventually found the net with a quick shot that Mads Hermansen should have saved.This victory marked United’s fourth win against Leicester this season, including two matches where Ruud van Nistelrooy served as the interim manager for the Red Devils. Unfortunately for the Dutchman, he hasn't achieved the same success at the King Power Stadium.Leicester's situation has worsened, suffering 13 losses in their last 14 league games and now sitting nine points behind safety. Additionally, they set an unwanted record as the first Premier League team to go seven home games without scoring.Bruno Fernandes capped off United's victory with a brilliant strike from the edge of the box, marking his seventh goal in as many games.",Arsenal beat Chelsea 0-1 at the Emirates. Fulham beat Tottenham 2-0 at Craven Cottage. Manchester United beat Leicester 3-0. Leicester set unwanted record as first Premier League team to go seven home games without scoring.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119081915,imgsize-85896,width-400,resizemode-4/119081915.jpg"
Diego Godin happy to see Atletico Madrid on equal terms with Real Madrid and Barcelona,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/top-stories/diego-godin-happy-to-see-atletico-madrid-on-equal-terms-with-real-madrid-and-barcelona/articleshow/119065365.cms,"Diego Godin (Photo Source: X)

PANAJI: Whenever Diego Godin closes his eyes and thinks of that magical night of May 17, 2014, at the Camp Nou, the former Atletico de Madrid defender remembers every scene almost perfectly.The frenzied start by hosts Barcelona , a lightning strike from Alexis Sanchez to put the home team ahead and the inspirational half-time talk from his team’s manager, Diego Simeone.It was the concluding clash of La Liga , and having lost the chance to wrap up the Spanish league title earlier, Atletico needed at least a point at the Camp Nou with Barca also chasing the title. Both Diego Costa and Arda Turan were taken off injured in the first 45 minutes. Then, as ends were changed, Godin powered a header from Koke’s corner to put Atletico level and eventually end the duopoly in Spanish football .It was their first league title in 18 years and the first time in ten years anyone outside Barcelona and Real Madrid had had a taste of it.“It wasn’t easy for us to win that championship at the Camp Nou,” Godin, now retired, said during a global media call arranged by La Liga on Saturday. “There were so many emotions, so much joy. If I have to handpick my best memory from my time at Atletico, the key moment was clearly that goal.”Since that 2014 triumph, Atletico have won La Liga just once, with Barcelona and Madrid taking turns to become champions. Now they have another chance as Barcelona visit the Wanda Metropolitano on Sunday. The Catalans are currently just one point ahead of the two Madrid clubs, with a game in hand.Defeat at Getafe last week put a massive dent in Atletico’s own title bid.“I wouldn’t say it’s a decisive clash but it’s an important one in the title race. If Atletico win, it will help the team a lot and lift their morale after their elimination from the Champions League (against rivals Real Madrid on penalties). Another defeat will be very hard to take,"" said Godin.“The (Champions League) defeat was very painful. It hurts more because Atletico were really enthusiastic and excited about going through (to the next stage). When you are eliminated from a competition where you’re so excited, you feel very empty (after a defeat).”Under Simeone, the former Uruguay captain and the country’s most capped footballer turned himself into a leader and the force around whom the team revolved. For nine years, he made close to 400 appearances, winning La Liga, two Europa Leagues, one Copa del Rey, one Spanish Super Cup and three UEFA Super Cups.Atletico also made it to the final of the Champions League twice, only to lose both times to bitter rivals Real Madrid.“When I joined, Atletico were a long way from Barcelona and Real Madrid but now it’s a team that can compete on equal terms. We’ve won leagues against them. We’ve got to the finals of Champions League, of Copa del Rey, the Super Cup.“So, you can imagine how the club has grown, and how the club continues to grow. It’s got better quality players, young players. The very equal competitiveness in sporting terms with Real and Barca is important. We cannot compete with them in terms of their finances, but in terms of sport, we can give them a fight,” said Godin.",Diego Godin won the La Liga title with Atletico de Madrid in May 2014. Godin scored the winning goal against Barcelona at the Camp Nou. Atletico have won La Liga just once since that triumph. Barcelona visit Atletico on Sunday in the final game of the season.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119065419,imgsize-91406,width-400,resizemode-4/119065419.jpg"

BENGALURU: The first two months of the 2025 tennis season has been all uphill for Sumit Nagal , starting in Melbourne in January and then on clay in Rosario and Buenos Aires, laid low by a flu.The 27-year-old will make a return to tournament play in the ATP Challenger in Murcia next week after staying away from the Tour for about a month.Nagal, whose ranking is down to 132, was thrown a curveball by what he suspects was a bout of Covid-19 in January. The Indian, who chose the rigour of the South American swing over the four-week ATP Challenger series in India in February, was caught unawares in Argentina.“If I knew I was (so) unwell I would never have gone to South America,” Nagal told TOI during a telephone interview. “You’re going so far away, not feeling your best, that makes no sense.”Nagal, who has spent the last few weeks at his training base in Germany, is gradually working his way back.“I never really felt good since Australia, it was maybe Covid-19 over there, I wasn’t sure,” the India No.1 said. “When I was in Argentina I was practicing a bit and then I wasn’t really practicing. It wasn’t a great few weeks for me. I was struggling so much with my health, I was fatigued, I was barely practicing. And when I practiced or played I would feel super tired.”“It has been good in the last two weeks. I have been practicing quite a bit, pushing a bit,” said Nagal, who marked his fitness at eight on a scale of 1 to 10.Nagal, who climbed to a career-high No.68 in the ranking last July, is now chasing a main draw berth at Roland Garros. He’s scheduled to play two ATP Challengers, followed by Monte Carlo Masters 1000, where he went through qualifiers last year to make the round of 32, after which the Indian will look at 250 Series tournaments.While there are nine Indians in the top-150 of the doubles rankings, Nagal is the only Indian in the top-250 of the singles rankings on the men’s and women’s tours.","Sumit Nagal will make a return to tournament play in the ATP Challenger in Murcia next week.

Sabalenka trounces Keys in Australian Open re-match

Russian teenager Mirra Andreeva ended the defending champion Iga Swiatek 's quest for a historic third Indian Wells title, defeating the world number two 7-6 (1), 1-6, 6-3 on Friday to advance to the final.At just 17, Andreeva snapped Swiatek's 10-match winning streak at Indian Wells, marking her second victory over the Polish star in three weeks—having previously triumphed in Dubai's quarter-finals en route to becoming the youngest WTA 1000 champion ever.On Sunday, Andreeva will face Aryna Sabalenka , who dominated Australian Open champion Madison Keys . The American veteran Keys had denied Sabalenka a third consecutive title in Melbourne, where she claimed her first major in January.Andreeva is the youngest finalist at Indian Wells since Kim Clijsters, who was 17 in 2001.In the match against Swiatek, Andreeva showcased her skills in the first set tiebreaker and managed to regroup after a challenging second set.Although Swiatek started confidently, dropping only one point in her first three service games, Andreeva seized a 5-4 lead with a crucial break, benefiting from a double fault by Swiatek. The match proceeded to a tiebreaker where Andreeva dominated.""I felt like I'm gonna go and play the tiebreak like it's the last tiebreak of my life,"" she said. ""So I just went for all my shots. My serve was great. I just felt super comfortable and confident,"" she said.""I saw my mom's nervous face in the big screen,"" Andreeva told the crowd. ""I tried not to look there.""Despite Swiatek rebounding in the second set with three breaks, the momentum shifted back to Andreeva in the third. She ultimately secured victory with her third break of the set.""I just decided to kind of still play the same but maybe go for my shots more, trying to play a little bit more aggressive,"" she said.""I feel also that I was dealing with the nerves and the pressure pretty good, so I just feel proud of myself.""World number one Aryna Sabalenka dispatched Madison Keys 6-0, 6-1 to reach the Indian Wells final, avenging her loss to the fifth-ranked American in the Australian Open final.In just 51 minutes, Sabalenka set up a title match against Andreeva.The Belarusian, seeking revenge after her January defeat to Keys, was sharp from the start, completing the first set in just 23 minutes.""I was hungry,"" said Sabalenka, who had made no bones about wanting revenge. ""That Australian Open match was really heartbroken for me, and I really needed some time to recover after that.""And if I would lose today again, it would get in my head and I didn't want that to happen. I was really focused -- I was just really hungry to get this win against Madison.""Keys, who had a 16-match winning streak culminating in her Australian Open victory, struggled to make an impact.""I think tactically I played really great tennis,"" said Sabalenka, adding her strategy was to ""just keep her out of the rhythm"".Despite overcoming the cold, swirling winds on Stadium Court and winning the first 11 games, Sabalenka's dominance was clear. Keys managed to hold serve for the first time at 5-1 in the second set, but Sabalenka quickly closed out the match.This marks Sabalenka's second appearance in the Indian Wells final; she was the runner-up to Elena Rybakina in 2023.","Russian teenager Mirra Andreeva beat defending champion Iga Swiatek 7-6 (1), 1-6, 6-3. At 17, she is the youngest finalist at Indian Wells since Kim Clijsters in 2001. She will face Aryna Sabalenka, who beat Australian Open champion Madison Keys. The Belarusian avenged her loss to Keys in the Australian Open final.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119030940,imgsize-17826,width-400,resizemode-4/119030940.jpg"

Madison Keys powered into the Indian Wells semifinals on Thursday, dismantling wild-card Belinda Bencic 6-1, 6-1 in just 65 minutes to notch her 16th straight victory. The fifth-seeded American, who claimed the Australian Open title earlier this year, now sets up a highly anticipated rematch with world No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka . The two last met at Melbourne Park in January, where Keys defeated Sabalenka in a three-set battle, halting the Belarusian’s bid for a third straight title.Despite upsetting No. 4 seed Coco Gauff in the previous round, Bencic — a 28-year-old from Switzerland — had no answers for Keys’ relentless play.Elsewhere in the women’s draw, defending champion Iga Swiatek continued her dominant run in the California desert, advancing to her fourth straight semifinal at Indian Wells with a 6-3, 6-3 win over eighth-seeded Qinwen Zheng. Swiatek, the No. 2 seed and a five-time Grand Slam winner, is aiming to become the first woman to win the event three times. She’s riding a 10-match win streak at Indian Wells, having also lifted the trophy in 2022.Zheng, who had ended Swiatek’s 25-match winning streak at the Paris Olympics last year, couldn’t replicate that magic. Though she broke Swiatek twice and won six games — equaling the total games Swiatek had lost all tournament — the Polish star converted all five of her break points to seal the match.In the men’s draw, two-time defending champion Carlos Alcaraz fought off determined challenger Francisco Cerundolo 6-3, 7-6 (7/4) to reach the semi-finals.On another cold, blustery night in the California desert, Alcaraz battled back from 1-4 down in the second set, coming up with a break and two love service holds to force the tiebreaker as he kept his bid to join Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic as the only men to win three straight Indian Wells titles on track.Alcaraz had to save break points in each of his first three service games. But after an emphatic hold for 4-3 he gained the first break of the contest with a deft volley and just like that he was serving for the first set.After sliding to pop a drop volley winner over the net for set point Alcaraz drilled a deep forehand that Cerundolo could barely get a racquet on.But it was Cerundolo who broke first in the second, finally converting his ninth break point of the match then holding for 4-1.But he couldn't hold off the world number three, who raced to a 5-2 lead in the tiebreaker on the way to victory.""It was really difficult for me to start the match,"" said Alcaraz, who looked less comfortable in the windy weather than he did just a day before.""He got a lot of chances in the first set,"" Alcaraz said. ""I'm just pleased about saving all of them and taking the only one that I had.""I didn't hit the ball as clear as yesterday, but I just did what I had to and that's what it's about.""Alcaraz next faces Britain's Jack Draper, who reached his first Masters 1000 semi-final with a 6-4, 7-5 victory over American Ben Shelton.Draper took the opening set with one break of serve then rallied from 0-3 down in a second-set slug-fest.Shelton's 32 unforced errors included five double-faults -- including one to hand Draper a break for 6-5 in the second.Russian Daniil Medvedev , runner-up to Alcaraz each of the past two years, rallied from a break down in a wild, wind-blown final set to beat Arthur Fils 6-4, 2-6, 7-6 (9/7).The world number six booked a semi-final meeting with Denmark's Holger Rune , a 5-7, 6-0, 6-3 winner over Tallon Griekspoor.Medvedev, a six-time Grand Slam finalist, trailed 20-year-old Fils 2-4 in the third set of a compelling clash that was momentarily paused as gusting winds sent towels and trash cans flying on Stadium Court.France's Fils had shown admirable maturity in the face of Medvedev's formidable defensive skills.He cut down on the unforced errors that marred his first set to win the second with ease and maintained his poise as he erased an early break in the third to seize the lead.But Medvedev wouldn't be denied and after forcing the tiebreaker prevailed on his third match point when Fils pushed a backhand volley long.Medvedev, who had won just one of his past nine third-set tiebreakers, gave a leap of sheer joy after securing the win in 2 hours and 25 minutes to keep alive his bid for a first title since 2023 -- when he won five.""I lost a lot of tight matches this year where I could have won, should have won maybe,"" Medvedev said. ""I have lost a lot of tight matches where it goes a little bit 50-50 and the more it goes like that, the more you can lose confidence in the tight moments.""I was happy I was able to get over the line as he saved some match points and had a break lead in the third. I am just happy to win.""Medvedev faces another young gun in Rune, who burst onto the scene in 2022 with a win over Novak Djokovic in the Paris Masters final.Rune has struggled often since, but after dropping the first set he dominated Griekspoor, the 43rd-ranked Dutchman who had ousted top-seeded Alexander Zverev in the second round.","Madison Keys crushes wild-card Belinda Bencic 6-1,6-1 in just 65 minutes to notch her 16th straight victory.

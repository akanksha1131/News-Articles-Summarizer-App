"WPL: Nat Sciver-Brunt has been Mumbai Indians’s MVP, rivals’ envy",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/wpl/wpl-nat-sciver-brunt-has-been-mumbai-indianss-mvp-rivals-envy/articleshow/119030527.cms,"Nat Sciver-Brunt (PTI Photo)

MUMBAI: ""Form goes up and down,” says Nat Sciver-Brunt , so she wants to make the most of it as the “feeling when you are not so confident isn’t that nice.”It’s a captain’s delight to have someone like the England allrounder on the roster. The 32-year-old has unlocked her beast mode for Mumbai Indians this season, topping the Orange Cap list with 493 runs in nine games at an average of 70.42, with the help of five fifties. She already became the first player to score 400-plus runs in WPL history and is just seven runs short of crossing the 500-run mark in a season. She also has nine scalps in her kitty, putting her in the driver’s seat to take the Player of the Tournament award.She also played a stellar role in MI’s title run in the inaugural edition in 2023, scoring 332 runs and taking 10 wickets.A trait of top players is that they always find a way to improve their game consistently, and Sciver-Brunt is among those. During this campaign, she has impressed with her ability to score at a brisk rate through the middle overs. Her career strike rate in T20Is is 118.12, while in WPL it is 143.24, but in this edition, her strike rate stands at 156.50.Other MI batters have benefited from it, as well as her calm approach while batting, which has given the likes of Hayley Matthews and Harmanpreet Kaur the time to build their innings.Sciver-Brunt stressed that she didn’t try anything different in the lead-up to the tournament. “I haven’t done anything different in terms of my preparation or how I go about my innings. I have stuck to my strengths quite a lot and have played what is in front of me,” she said.Besides scoring briskly, what has made her more dangerous is her ability to score all around the park. Fuller lengths have been dispatched down the ground or through the covers, while anything slightly wide or short has been sent to the boundary with ferocity.Sciver-Brunt and Matthews have developed a nice understanding between them, which has seen them stitch match winning partnerships for MI. Like the 71-ball 133-run association against Gujarat Giants in the eliminator on Thursday, which was also their second 100-plus stand of the season. They also put on a 133-run association against UP Warriorz (UPW), besides two 50-plus stands—92 and 57 against UPW and Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB), respectively. She has also taken on the lead role while mentoring the West Indian, who at times has found it difficult to construct her innings.“Apart from this tournament, I haven’t really batted with Hayley, but we seemed to click well from the first year. (Against Giants) she wanted to go off after a quicker start, but it was good she stayed out there and didn’t give her wicket away. I was just reassuring her that you only need to time the ball, you don’t need to whack it,” reasoned Sciver-Brunt.","Nat Sciver-Brunt has scored 493 runs in nine games for Mumbai Indians. The 32-year-old is seven runs short of crossing the 500-run mark in a season.

Champions Return: Rohit, Hardik, Shreyas, Gambhir return after India's title triumph

NEW DELHI: The Hundred Draft witnessed a notable absence of Pakistani cricketers , with none of the 50 players from the country receiving bids. This development has sparked discussions and raised questions about the potential factors contributing to this outcome.Among the Pakistani contingent, prominent names such as Naseem Shah , Saim Ayub, and Shadab Khan , who were placed in the top price brackets, failed to attract any bidders.Naseem and Shadab were listed in the highest category of GBP 120,000, while Ayub positioned himself in the GBP 78,500 segment. Similarly, the female cricketers from Pakistan , including Aliya Riaz, Fatima Sana, Yusra Amir, Iram Javed, and Jaweria Rauf, did not receive any offers.One potential reason cited for this lack of interest in Pakistani players is the involvement of Indian Premier League ( IPL ) owners in the Hundred teams.Currently, four IPL franchises hold stakes in various Hundred teams, including Mumbai Indians in Oval Invincibles, Lucknow Super Giants in Manchester Originals, Sunrisers Hyderabad in Northern Superchargers, and Delhi Capitals in Southern Brave.Additionally, Sanjay Govil, an Indian-American entrepreneur, has acquired a 50% stake in Welsh Fire, while Cricket Investor Holdings Limited, a consortium of Silicon Valley tech entrepreneurs, has purchased a 49% stake in London Spirit.While the influence of IPL owners cannot be discounted, another factor that may have contributed to the lack of bids for Pakistani cricketers is their modest form in white-ball formats.The recent performances of these players in limited-overs cricket might have played a role in deterring potential buyers from investing in their services.It is worth noting that last year, players like Naseem Shah and Shaheen Shah Afridi faced challenges related to obtaining No Objection Certificates (NOCs) from the Pakistan Cricket Board ( PCB ), which ultimately curtailed their participation in the Hundred.Such administrative hurdles could also have impacted the decision-making process of the teams during the draft.",The Hundred Draft witnessed a notable absence of Pakistani cricketers.

A day after dethroning reigning champion Jonatan Christie , Lakshya Sen faltered against Li Shi Feng of China 10-21, 16-21 in the men’s singles quarterfinals of the All England Championships in Birmingham on Friday.Soon after, the Indian challenge ended as the women’s doubles pair of Treesa Jolly and Gayatri Gopichand lost to Chinese second seeds Liu Sheng Shu and Tan Ning 14-21, 10-21.Given his 7-4 win-loss record and having won the last two matches against Li last year, Lakshya was expected to fare well in the quarterfinals. But the Indian was a pale shadow of the shuttler on show against Christie.From 4-4, Li widened the gap. He scored eight points on the trot and Lakshya was out of the first game even before he had warmed up.Emboldened by the easy victory in the first game, Li started on an aggressive note while Lakshya crawled his way back. With good netplay and by pushing the shuttle to the corners with good effect, Lakshya secured a crucial three-point lead (11-8) at the halfway stage. However, Li toned down his aggression and scored the next four points by engaging the Indian in long rallies, mostly close to the net. It was anybody’s game till 15-15.Thereafter, Li came up with two smash winners and a lucky net drop to widen the gap to 19-15. Li produced 10 smash winners in the second game to silence Lakshya.The 87-minute three-game second round contest against Koreans Kim Hye Jeong and Kong Hee Yong, late on Thursday affected TreesaGayatri, who had only 14 hours to recover for the quarterfinal.Though they led 10-7 at one stage the duo struggled to move well on the court. The Chinese took off from 7-10 and won 14 of the next 18 points to pocket the first game. In the second game they were even more dominant. “We were slow on the court today. Maybe the long match late last night affected us a bit,” Gayatri said after the match. Chirag Shetty who injured his back in the second round is travelling back to India. The extent of his injury will be known after the MRI scan.","Lakshya Sen loses to Li Shi Feng of China 10-21, 16-21 in the men's singles quarterfinals of the All England Championships.

Champions Return: Rohit, Hardik, Shreyas, Gambhir return after India's title triumph

NEW DELHI: Retired Test opener David Warner has cast doubt on whether England’s high-octane "" Bazball "" approach will hold up on Australian soil, insisting it’s a risky tactic against the conditions Down Under.“I don’t know if 'Bazball' is a myth now, but I can’t see it happening in Australia,” the 38-year-old told reporters this week, as quoted by Fox Sports.Warner, who called time on his international career last year, had a front-row seat to England’s aggressive style during the 2023 Ashes . While the approach earned praise for its entertainment value, he believes the fast-paced batting might falter on bouncier Australian pitches .“With the bounce and everything, the fields Australia set last time in England, it would be pretty high risk to play that in Australia,” he said.“It’s probably not the way to go about it. If that is the way they go … it’s going to be high tempo, high energy and we’ll all get a couple of days off at the back end.”England’s ""Bazball"" era, led by Test captain Ben Stokes and coach Brendon McCullum , has seen mixed results since kicking off three years ago. The team surged to a dominant home summer in 2022, then made headlines with a record-breaking 3-0 whitewash in Pakistan.However, their fortunes turned in 2023. England failed to retain the Ashes on home soil and later slumped to a 4-1 series loss in India, reigniting doubts about the long-term sustainability of the ""Bazball"" strategy in varied conditions.Meanwhile, Warner is gearing up for a new challenge. Earlier this week, he was picked up by the London Spirit for AU$245,000 in The Hundred Draft . He’ll reunite with former Australian coach Justin Langer as the 100-ball tournament kicks off in August.Warner’s home ground will be Lord’s—where tensions famously boiled over during the 2023 Ashes, as he and his teammates clashed with MCC members in the Long Room. Asked about the reception he expects from Spirit fans, Warner was candid.“We’ll just have to wait until I step foot on that park first, won’t we? Then we’ll see how the reception is,” he said.“I’ll have to walk past the Long Room first to get to the changing room! I actually want them to come at Australians. I love that stuff, that’s what gets me going but I want them to support London Spirit.ALSO SEE: Why all 50 Pakistan cricketers went unpicked in The Hundred Draft “If they want to boo me, boo me, but don’t boo the team.

MUMBAI: It won’t come as a surprise if Saturday’s WPL finalists—Mumbai Indians and Delhi Capitals—opt to chase if the toss rolls in their favour.Both teams have enjoyed success while hunting down targets this edition.MI have opted to bat second on five occasions and have won four games. DC decided to chase on six occasions and succeeded in five of them, twice against their rivals on Saturday.With both teams batting deep, they feel more comfortable chasing. Many matches going down to the wire this season is a testimony to that as well.MI may look top-heavy with Hayley Matthews, Nat-Sciver Brunt, and skipper Harmanpreet Kaur batting at No. 2, 3, and 4. The small but effective contributions of Amanjot Kaur and Sajeevan Sajana give them that confidence. It’s similar to DC as well. While Meg Lanning , Shafali Verma, Jemimah Rodrigues, and Jess Jonassen have done the heavy lifting for them, they have the likes of Niki Prasad, Sarah Bryce, and Shikha Pandey, among others, to provide that back-up in case the top order has an off day.MI have an edge when it comes to their bowling, especially in the spin department, with off-spinner Matthews and leg-spinner Amelia Kerr among the top two wicket-takers in the tournament.On the eve of the final, while both captains didn’t reveal their cards, they agreed that backing their skills and strengths is what matters. MI’s Harmanpreet said that their decision depends on the “conditions” and they “plan accordingly for it,” but the focus is on doing things they are “comfortable about.” “We never thought too much about winning the toss. It’s just going out there and performing,” she added.Her DC counterpart Lanning assessed: “It’s about what your strengths are and backing that. And throughout the tournament, we’ve done that.” She added: “We’re not too bothered about what we do first. The conditions seem to be similar throughout the match. It’s just about doing whatever we can in that first innings and then backing yourself.”In the last two finals, DC won the toss both times, but their batters failed to put on a fighting total on the board. In the 2023 final, MI restricted them to 131 before registering a seven wicket win. Last edition, Royal Challengers Bengaluru shot them out for 113 before recording an eight-wicket victory.Lanning is aware of it, and she admitted that there’s more on the line in the final than a round game. “We’ve just been focusing on what we can do this year and playing to our strengths, backing ourselves. What’s happened in the round games, doesn’t count for anything. It’s about performing tomorrow night,” said Lanning.MI will be playing their fourth match in six days, while Capitals have had a seven-day break. Both captains had a different take on their schedule. While Harmanpreet felt that it “will play to their advantage” as they “now know the conditions well”, Lanning felt that the break gave them time to “refresh” themselves and the conditions won’t be alien as a lot of their players have played here.","Both teams have enjoyed success while hunting down targets this edition.

This marked their second WPL final loss against Mumbai Indians, despite being in a strong position during the title match.""We have had another good season, and unfortunately, we couldn't get over the line.

The team continued to lose wickets as Jess Jonassen (13) and Annabel Sutherland (2) fell, leaving them at 37/3.Jemimah Rodrigues contributed 30 runs before being dismissed by Amelia Kerr, reducing Delhi to 66/5.

BENGALURU: Virat Kohli on Saturday made it clear that retirement is not on the immediate agenda but the star batter admitted he may not be around when India tour Australia next in four years' time. In a tongue-in-cheek response to the possibility of coming out of retirement for the 2028 Olympics, the 36-year-old former India skipper, speaking at the RCB Innovation Lab's Leadership Summit here on Saturday, quipped, “I just might sneak in for one game, if we are playing the gold-medal match!” Excerpts...I'm not playing for achievement. It pretty much comes down to just the pure joy, enjoyment and love for the game. And as long as that is intact, I'll continue to play the game. I have to be honest about that with myself, because the competitive streak doesn't allow you to find the answer. I had a very interesting conversation about this with Rahul Dravid when he was coach. He said you always have to stay in touch with yourself, figure out where you are placed in your life. And the answer is not that easy, because you might be going through a lean phase, and you (may) feel like this is it, but it might not be. When it is time, he said my competitive streak would not allow me to accept it. Maybe one more. You just have to pray and hope for clarity when it comes.The only thing that we as a team have tried to do is create an environment of fun and involvement. When you go to a practice session, you're looking forward to being at the training ground with your friends. It doesn't feel like a drag, it doesn't feel like I have to get off the bus and go for another session. It's like, when are we going to get together with the boys again? Because we have so much talent today. And I think it came out beautifully. The guys adapted well to what was in front of them. We ended up winning because we adapted to the conditions much better than the others.I'm happy about the inclusion. The amount of cricket has increased, so have the number of teams. Leagues are being played all over the world. The IPL has played a massive role in that as well. It's a great opportunity for our guys. To be Olympic champions would be a magnificent feeling.I can't pinpoint one lowest point. If you ask me the intensity of how disappointed I've been, for me the most recent Australia tour would be the one that's most fresh, or for a long period of time the tour of England in 2014 was the thing that bothered me the most. But I can't look at it that way. I might not have an Australia tour again in me in four years' time. I don't have the chance to correct it. So, you have to make peace with whatever's happened in your life. How do I cope? It's just about the acceptance.There was a time when I realized that I need to change the way I'm preparing as an athlete. Motivation was something that came from within. No one had to force me to do it. India had a couple of very difficult overseas tours. And I figured out that the reason that we were falling short is because the other team was physically way fitter than us. And they were able to hold their plans and skills in pressure situations for way longer periods than we could. And that's what Test cricket is all about, who's able to stay in the battle for longer periods of time.After I became captain, we started to bring in this kind of culture into the team as well. It eventually became a fabric that went into the culture of the Indian cricket.The perception (about women's cricket) has changed massively. I think what the Indian women's cricket team has done over the last few years is that they are the ones who were the catalyst to kind of put the attention onto themselves. I literally saw it happening in a time span of 6-7 years. The way they started playing, you could see that belief and then people started engaging a lot more. And eventually it got to a place where commercials became better. Money was being infused into the women's game. And then you have the WPL. We have all seen the number of people that come and watch the games. And the standard of the games as well, be it power-hitting or skill levels and everything. This is what happens when you take a sport or even a part of a sport to that level of competition and equality.",Virat Kohli says he's not playing for 'achievement' anymore but for the joy & excitement; admits retirement call be tough because of 'competitive streak' Former India skipper says he may not be around when India tour Australia next in four years' time.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119048981,imgsize-104290,width-400,resizemode-4/119048981.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Star Indian batter and former Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) captain Virat Kohli has called for a collective effort to transform India into a "" Sports Forward Nation "" by 2036. Speaking at the RCB Innovation Lab Indian Sports Summit, Kohli emphasised the need for a holistic approach that goes beyond infrastructure and includes educating the public about sports to build a robust sporting culture.""We are working towards India becoming a Sports Forward Nation by 2036. As I said, we have the vision, we have the groundwork happening today. I think it's the collective responsibility of everyone who gets involved. Not just the infrastructure, not just the people who are going to infuse the money, not just the athletes, but people who want to be educated about the sport,"" Kohli said.""We don't need the celebration and fanaticism, we need the education of the sport. The education around the sport, for us as a country, is also very important. Once the education around sport takes place, the experience will be 10 times what it is today and that will be a big step towards us being a sports forward nation.""Kohli also highlighted the growing prominence of women's sports in India, acknowledging the progress made over the past few years. He praised women athletes for being their own catalysts, drawing attention to themselves through their performances.""They were their own catalysts and kind of put the attention onto them. I literally saw it happening like in a time span of 6-7 years. The way they started playing, you could see that belief and then people started engaging in that a lot. And eventually, it got to a place where, you know, the commercials became better, money was being infused into the women's game, and then you have the WPL,"" Kohli commented.He stressed that developing a sporting culture requires a collective effort, and that women's sports should be an integral part of that vision.""Looking at men for the improvement of sport in any country, it has to be a collective. Sports culture includes everyone, and women's sport is a massive part of it. We have so much data in women's sports, not just cricket but all the others. We are creating individual activities over the year in tennis, badminton, wrestling, boxing. So, I think it's definitely heading in the right direction and it needs more backing and more and more infrastructure to be developed,"" Kohli shared.","Virat Kohli has called for a collective effort to transform India into a "" Sports Forward Nation "" by 2036.

The Indian Premier League ( IPL ) 2025 season will commence on March 22, featuring defending champions Kolkata Knight Riders against Royal Challengers Bengaluru at Eden Gardens, Kolkata.The 18th season of the 10-team tournament follows a significant squad restructuring after the IPL Mega Auction in November. Teams are working to establish effective player combinations while dealing with injury concerns, including Indian pace bowler Jasprit Bumrah's anticipated return from a long absence.Lucknow Super Giants have three seamers on the sidelines but none more important than Mayank Yadav (the other two being Mohsin Khan and Avesh Khan). All three await fitness clearance as they work on recovering from respective injuries at the National Cricket Academy (NCA). While LSG are hopeful of having Mohsin and Avesh back in time, Mayank remains touch and go.Mumbai Indians seamer Jasprit Bumrah continues to stay on the sidelines after his lower back issue during the Border-Gavaskar Trophy in Australia. He missed the bilateral series against England and the Champions Trophy triumph as he continues to reduce his workload. With a tour of England in June, Bumrah is reported to take further break before joining his MI teammates.The England batter pulled out of the retirement and issued an apology to his franchise Delhi Capitals for the late decision. As a result of his decision to withdraw from the IPL, he has been banned from the T20 competition for two seasons. As per the rule, any foreign player giving the IPL a miss after getting picked at the auction faces a two-year ban from the competition, unless they're injured. Brook had withdrawn from the 2024 season after the death of his grandmother. Before IPL 2025 he opted out to focus on his England career.Unlike the rest on this list, Hardik Pandya will miss Mumbai's first match of IPL 2025, against Chennai Super Kings at the MA Chidambaram Stadium, not because of injury but for a technicality.

It will be a challenging task, but senior defender Sandesh Jhingan expressed on Saturday that the Indian football team aims to defeat Maldives and Bangladesh without conceding a goal in the upcoming international matches. India is set to host Maldives in an international friendly on March 19, followed by a crucial clash against Bangladesh on March 25 in their opening match of the 2027 AFC Asian Cup qualifying third round.Both matches will take place at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium in Shillong, marking the first time the Meghalaya capital will host international games. The match against Maldives will also witness the return of the legendary Sunil Chhetri from international retirement.""Our main aim is to get the result in the Bangladesh match, as that would give us a good start in the Asian Cup Qualifiers, and I think the 10-day training ahead of that, along with the friendly against Maldives will greatly help us prepare for it,"" Jhingan said.""Our target is two clean sheet victories,"" the 31-year-old was quoted as saying in an AIFF release.The 40-year-old Chhetri had announced his retirement in June 2024 after a stellar international career that began in 2005. However, he has demonstrated his continued prowess in the 2024-25 ISL season, where he scored 12 goals in 24 matches, becoming the second-highest scorer overall and the top Indian scorer.Head coach Manolo Marquez explained the rationale behind convincing Chhetri to return to the national team.""Because it was a special situation, I spoke with the AIFF and Bengaluru FC before I called him. I spoke with Sunil and explained to him what I wanted from him,"" Marquez said.""It doesn't matter if he's 40. The national team needs players who are in good form,"" the Spaniard added.India is placed in Group C of the 2027 Asian Cup qualifying third round, alongside Bangladesh, Hong Kong, and Singapore. Only the top team will secure a spot in the continental tournament.It will be a tough challenge to top the group, which Marquez acknowledged when he referred to the ""special situation.""""Sunil is the Indian top-scorer in the ISL, with practically double goals than the next player, who is Brison. After that are Subhasish, Irfan, Manvir... all of them are here with us in the national team.""We need players who score goals. In my four matches so far, we have only scored two goals - one of them from a set-piece. At this moment, the most important thing is to get results. Nothing else matters.""The Indian squad held a 45-minute gym session on Saturday morning and had their first on-pitch training session at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium, the match venue, later in the evening.","Sandesh Jhingan says Indian football team aims to defeat Maldives and Bangladesh without conceding a goal in upcoming international matches.

NEW DELHI: Manchester City forward Erling Haaland is on the cusp of another Premier League milestone, but Pep Guardiola believes the Norwegian striker is just getting started.Ahead of Manchester City’s clash with Brighton , Guardiola heaped praise on Haaland’s remarkable output since arriving in England, while challenging him to reach even greater heights.“I’ve been with Messi,” Guardiola said, when asked what Haaland does on the pitch that he’s never seen before.“But it’s incredible what Erling has done. And I want more.

Instead, he framed the moment as a reminder of Haaland’s importance in the club’s final run-in.“He has to help us more and more to achieve what we want to do this season,” Guardiola added. “But the numbers are unbelievable since he arrived… hopefully he can reach that little record tomorrow.”City, who trail Liverpool in the title race, are focused on securing Champions League qualification with 10 league games to go. Guardiola acknowledged a dip in performance levels compared to previous title-winning campaigns, attributing it to the fierce competition across the league.“We helped raise the bar in the Premier League,” he said. “Now, every team is organised, structured, with good players and good ideas. Every game is tough.”Despite describing the season as ""not good,"" Guardiola urged fans to rally behind the squad during the crucial final stretch.“Ten games, two months. Still we can survive and be there. With energy and positivity, we can still achieve something.”As the title slips further from reach, Guardiola is counting on his No. 9 to once again defy the limits.","Erling Haaland is on the cusp of another Premier League milestone.

The ref and the VAR decided that we should go to penalties.

Sabalenka trounces Keys in Australian Open re-match

Russian teenager Mirra Andreeva ended the defending champion Iga Swiatek 's quest for a historic third Indian Wells title, defeating the world number two 7-6 (1), 1-6, 6-3 on Friday to advance to the final.At just 17, Andreeva snapped Swiatek's 10-match winning streak at Indian Wells, marking her second victory over the Polish star in three weeks—having previously triumphed in Dubai's quarter-finals en route to becoming the youngest WTA 1000 champion ever.On Sunday, Andreeva will face Aryna Sabalenka , who dominated Australian Open champion Madison Keys . The American veteran Keys had denied Sabalenka a third consecutive title in Melbourne, where she claimed her first major in January.Andreeva is the youngest finalist at Indian Wells since Kim Clijsters, who was 17 in 2001.In the match against Swiatek, Andreeva showcased her skills in the first set tiebreaker and managed to regroup after a challenging second set.Although Swiatek started confidently, dropping only one point in her first three service games, Andreeva seized a 5-4 lead with a crucial break, benefiting from a double fault by Swiatek. The match proceeded to a tiebreaker where Andreeva dominated.""I felt like I'm gonna go and play the tiebreak like it's the last tiebreak of my life,"" she said. ""So I just went for all my shots. My serve was great. I just felt super comfortable and confident,"" she said.""I saw my mom's nervous face in the big screen,"" Andreeva told the crowd. ""I tried not to look there.""Despite Swiatek rebounding in the second set with three breaks, the momentum shifted back to Andreeva in the third. She ultimately secured victory with her third break of the set.""I just decided to kind of still play the same but maybe go for my shots more, trying to play a little bit more aggressive,"" she said.""I feel also that I was dealing with the nerves and the pressure pretty good, so I just feel proud of myself.""World number one Aryna Sabalenka dispatched Madison Keys 6-0, 6-1 to reach the Indian Wells final, avenging her loss to the fifth-ranked American in the Australian Open final.In just 51 minutes, Sabalenka set up a title match against Andreeva.The Belarusian, seeking revenge after her January defeat to Keys, was sharp from the start, completing the first set in just 23 minutes.""I was hungry,"" said Sabalenka, who had made no bones about wanting revenge. ""That Australian Open match was really heartbroken for me, and I really needed some time to recover after that.""And if I would lose today again, it would get in my head and I didn't want that to happen. I was really focused -- I was just really hungry to get this win against Madison.""Keys, who had a 16-match winning streak culminating in her Australian Open victory, struggled to make an impact.""I think tactically I played really great tennis,"" said Sabalenka, adding her strategy was to ""just keep her out of the rhythm"".Despite overcoming the cold, swirling winds on Stadium Court and winning the first 11 games, Sabalenka's dominance was clear. Keys managed to hold serve for the first time at 5-1 in the second set, but Sabalenka quickly closed out the match.This marks Sabalenka's second appearance in the Indian Wells final; she was the runner-up to Elena Rybakina in 2023.","Russian teenager Mirra Andreeva beat defending champion Iga Swiatek 7-6 (1), 1-6, 6-3.

Madison Keys powered into the Indian Wells semifinals on Thursday, dismantling wild-card Belinda Bencic 6-1, 6-1 in just 65 minutes to notch her 16th straight victory. The fifth-seeded American, who claimed the Australian Open title earlier this year, now sets up a highly anticipated rematch with world No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka . The two last met at Melbourne Park in January, where Keys defeated Sabalenka in a three-set battle, halting the Belarusian’s bid for a third straight title.Despite upsetting No. 4 seed Coco Gauff in the previous round, Bencic — a 28-year-old from Switzerland — had no answers for Keys’ relentless play.Elsewhere in the women’s draw, defending champion Iga Swiatek continued her dominant run in the California desert, advancing to her fourth straight semifinal at Indian Wells with a 6-3, 6-3 win over eighth-seeded Qinwen Zheng. Swiatek, the No. 2 seed and a five-time Grand Slam winner, is aiming to become the first woman to win the event three times. She’s riding a 10-match win streak at Indian Wells, having also lifted the trophy in 2022.Zheng, who had ended Swiatek’s 25-match winning streak at the Paris Olympics last year, couldn’t replicate that magic. Though she broke Swiatek twice and won six games — equaling the total games Swiatek had lost all tournament — the Polish star converted all five of her break points to seal the match.In the men’s draw, two-time defending champion Carlos Alcaraz fought off determined challenger Francisco Cerundolo 6-3, 7-6 (7/4) to reach the semi-finals.On another cold, blustery night in the California desert, Alcaraz battled back from 1-4 down in the second set, coming up with a break and two love service holds to force the tiebreaker as he kept his bid to join Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic as the only men to win three straight Indian Wells titles on track.Alcaraz had to save break points in each of his first three service games. But after an emphatic hold for 4-3 he gained the first break of the contest with a deft volley and just like that he was serving for the first set.After sliding to pop a drop volley winner over the net for set point Alcaraz drilled a deep forehand that Cerundolo could barely get a racquet on.But it was Cerundolo who broke first in the second, finally converting his ninth break point of the match then holding for 4-1.But he couldn't hold off the world number three, who raced to a 5-2 lead in the tiebreaker on the way to victory.""It was really difficult for me to start the match,"" said Alcaraz, who looked less comfortable in the windy weather than he did just a day before.""He got a lot of chances in the first set,"" Alcaraz said. ""I'm just pleased about saving all of them and taking the only one that I had.""I didn't hit the ball as clear as yesterday, but I just did what I had to and that's what it's about.""Alcaraz next faces Britain's Jack Draper, who reached his first Masters 1000 semi-final with a 6-4, 7-5 victory over American Ben Shelton.Draper took the opening set with one break of serve then rallied from 0-3 down in a second-set slug-fest.Shelton's 32 unforced errors included five double-faults -- including one to hand Draper a break for 6-5 in the second.Russian Daniil Medvedev , runner-up to Alcaraz each of the past two years, rallied from a break down in a wild, wind-blown final set to beat Arthur Fils 6-4, 2-6, 7-6 (9/7).The world number six booked a semi-final meeting with Denmark's Holger Rune , a 5-7, 6-0, 6-3 winner over Tallon Griekspoor.Medvedev, a six-time Grand Slam finalist, trailed 20-year-old Fils 2-4 in the third set of a compelling clash that was momentarily paused as gusting winds sent towels and trash cans flying on Stadium Court.France's Fils had shown admirable maturity in the face of Medvedev's formidable defensive skills.He cut down on the unforced errors that marred his first set to win the second with ease and maintained his poise as he erased an early break in the third to seize the lead.But Medvedev wouldn't be denied and after forcing the tiebreaker prevailed on his third match point when Fils pushed a backhand volley long.Medvedev, who had won just one of his past nine third-set tiebreakers, gave a leap of sheer joy after securing the win in 2 hours and 25 minutes to keep alive his bid for a first title since 2023 -- when he won five.""I lost a lot of tight matches this year where I could have won, should have won maybe,"" Medvedev said. ""I have lost a lot of tight matches where it goes a little bit 50-50 and the more it goes like that, the more you can lose confidence in the tight moments.""I was happy I was able to get over the line as he saved some match points and had a break lead in the third. I am just happy to win.""Medvedev faces another young gun in Rune, who burst onto the scene in 2022 with a win over Novak Djokovic in the Paris Masters final.Rune has struggled often since, but after dropping the first set he dominated Griekspoor, the 43rd-ranked Dutchman who had ousted top-seeded Alexander Zverev in the second round.","Madison Keys crushes wild-card Belinda Bencic 6-1,6-1 in just 65 minutes to notch her 16th straight victory.

NEW DELHI: Mirra Andreeva ’s stunning rise in the WTA rankings has been so rapid that even the 17-year-old Russian admits she can’t quite keep up with it. Just last month in Dubai, she made history as the youngest-ever WTA 1000 champion , defeating both Grand Slam winners Iga Swiatek and Elena Rybakina on her way to the title — a win that catapulted her into the top 10 for the first time, landing at No. 9.Now at Indian Wells , Andreeva entered the tournament ranked 11th, but wins over Rybakina once again in the fourth round and Elina Svitolina in the quarter-finals are expected to lift her back into the top 10. Not that she’s been checking too closely.""Before, I was always checking live rankings because before I was playing for a dog,"" Andreeva said with a smile. ""So after every match I play I would check the live rankings to see if I did it.""That milestone — breaking into the top 20 — came after she defeated Magda Linette in Beijing last October. The reward? A promise of a dog. But even now, the pet hasn’t arrived yet, as she’s still narrowing down her choice.""I'm thinking to get an ultra mini labradoodle ,"" she revealed. ""It's going to be a labrador mixed with poodle and it's ultra min, so going to be even smaller than a mini version. It's going to take time until the dog that I want will be born.""While rankings may not be her primary focus anymore, Andreeva is channeling her energy into what’s right in front of her — like an upcoming semi-final clash at Indian Wells against defending champion Swiatek. Despite her recent win over the Pole in Dubai, she’s not expecting it to give her any advantage.""It doesn't give me any benefit to our match (on Friday),"" she admitted.Tennis has become increasingly serious for the teenager, but she's not letting that take the fun out of the game completely. The young star, who draws inspiration from athletes like Roger Federer and LeBron James, is trying to balance focus with enjoyment.""When I was a bit younger it would all be about having fun,"" Andreeva said. ""But now I start to understand that it's pretty serious what I do out here. I feel like when I have fun on the court I play great tennis, so I still try to not be super, super serious but also to have fun a little bit.""So while a top-10 return and a potential title shot are on the horizon, Andreeva remains grounded — eyes on the next match, and perhaps more importantly, on the tiny dog she’s patiently waiting for.","Mirra Andreeva's rise in the WTA rankings has been so rapid that even the 17-year-old Russian admits she can’t keep up with it.

NEW DELHI: Carlos Alcaraz , the two-time defending champion, showcased his dominance at the ATP Indian Wells Masters on Wednesday. The world number three from Spain overcame the challenging windy conditions on Stadium Court to deliver a commanding performance against Grigor Dimitrov , defeating him 6-1, 6-1.Alcaraz's victory denied Dimitrov's bid to join Canadian Felix Auger-Aliassime as the only players to beat the Spaniard in three consecutive meetings. The Bulgarian had previously won their last two encounters, including the quarter-finals at the Miami Open last year.With his 50th ATP Masters 1000 match win, Alcaraz kept his hopes alive of joining Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic as the only men to win three consecutive Indian Wells titles.Having reached the fourth round without dropping a set, Alcaraz produced his most impressive performance of the tournament. Despite the swirling winds that caused ball kids to scramble after blowing trash, Alcaraz appeared supremely untroubled.He broke Dimitrov's serve to open the match and secured the first set with another break. Alcaraz didn't face a break point until the fifth game of the second set, but he overcame that challenge with an ace on Dimitrov's third break chance. Alcaraz then broke the Bulgarian's serve to take a 5-1 lead.Alcaraz sealed the victory in style, earning a match point with his sixth ace of the match and clinching the win with a forehand winner.

NEW DELHI: Belinda Bencic produced a stunning comeback to upset world number three Coco Gauff on Wednesday, booking her place in the Indian Wells quarter-finals where she will face Australian Open champion Madison Keys .The Swiss star, who gave birth to her daughter Bella last April, triumphed 3-6, 6-3, 6-4 to reach her first WTA 1000 quarter-final since becoming a mother. Unranked when she returned to the tour in October, Bencic has steadily climbed back, capturing her ninth career title in Abu Dhabi last month and rising to 58th in the world this week.“I just kept on working also on the physical side,” Bencic said. “In the last matches in tournaments, I was able to play back-to-back, some three-set matches, and am fresher every time. The body is holding up much better, almost like it was before.”Bencic showed remarkable poise against Gauff, recovering from a first-set loss and keeping the American under constant pressure. Gauff, who had beaten Bencic at the Australian Open earlier this year, struggled with her forehand and gave away the crucial break with a loose return at 4-4 in the deciding set.Keys also had to fight back in her match, defeating Croatia’s Donna Vekic 4-6, 7-6 (9/7), 6-3. After failing to convert a set point in the second set and trailing 3-5 in the tiebreak, the American dug deep and eventually powered through, breaking twice in the third set to seal victory with a fierce backhand return.In the men’s draw, Ben Shelton downed Brandon Nakashima 7-6 (8/6), 6-1 to reach his third ATP Masters 1000 quarter-final.

NEW DELHI: Holger Rune delivered one of the most jaw-dropping moments of Indian Wells 2025 on Tuesday, hitting a between-the-legs winner to save break point en route to a straight-sets victory over Stefanos Tsitsipas . But as thrilled as the crowd was, Rune was just as excited — at least until he saw the replay.""You know, I kind of had the expectation that I looked like Roger Federer when I hit it, and I didn't quite do that,"" Rune said with a laugh after his 6-4, 6-4 win. ""So that was disappointing.""The 21-year-old Dane’s flashy shot wasn’t just for show — it helped him knock off the world No. 9 and book a spot in the Indian Wells quarterfinals for the second consecutive year.It also marked Rune’s first quarterfinal appearance of 2025, a year that hasn’t quite lived up to expectations for the former world No. 4.After bursting onto the scene in 2022 with a memorable win over Novak Djokovic at the Paris Masters, Rune has struggled to maintain consistency, slipping to 13th in the rankings while contemporaries like Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner continue to climb.Still, Rune is staying focused, emphasising growth over frustration.""It's about making results, but at the same time improving your game and having stability,"" he said. ""Because I don't believe I have become the worse player the last two years. I actually think the opposite. I think I have become a better all-around player.""He admits falling short of expectations can sting. ""You know, when you have these expectations and you don't quite, like, live up to them, of course it's disappointing,"" he said.""But it's very basic and maybe it's very boring to say it, but I just love tennis .""So even not being satisfied with my results, I still love to go down to the practice court and hit forehands, backhands, work on my shots, my physicality ...

""So I kind of played more risky, but the shots were still in.""""I'm happy that I closed it, for sure, because I knew this big cloud is coming,"" she added.That cloud eventually delivered another round of showers that wreaked havoc with the day’s schedule.

Indian Wells: Defending champion Iga Swiatek edged closer to an unprecedented third straight Indian Wells WTA title Sunday, overwhelming Dayana Yastremska 6-0, 6-2 to reach the fourth round.Swiatek's 65-minute victory set the tone on a day that saw Daniil Medvedev spend just 10 minutes on court before ailing opponent Alex Michelsen retired.Swiatek, the world number two from Poland, was in full control against hard-hitting Ukrainian Yastremska, swinging freely as she won the first 10 games.She converted six of her 11 break chances and didn't face a break point herself and it was virtually over by the time Yastremska got on the board with wins in her last two service games.""It's always hard to finish a match like that,"" Swiatek said. ""But I'm happy that I got my intensity up the last game and closed it with confidence.""Swiatek next faces Czech Karolina Muchova , who trailed 3-5 in the first set but won 10 of the next 11 games to beat compatriot Katerina Siniakova 7-5, 6-1.Russian 17-year-old Mirra Andreeva and 2023 Indian Wells champion Elena Rybakina joined Swiatek in dishing out bagels as they lined up a fourth-round clash.Andreeva, who triumphed in Dubai last month to become the youngest ever winner of a WTA 1000 event , beat Denmark's Clara Tauson 6-3, 6-0 in 63 minutes.Rybakina downed Britain's Katie Boulter 6-0, 7-5.Andreeva -- who beat Tauson in the final in Dubai -- said she found conditions on Stadium Court tougher than she made it look.""I'm just happy the way I managed to stay in the game,"" she said. ""I didn't give her much rhythm so I guess it was not bad -- but there's a lot of things to work on.""Women's fourth seed Jessica Pegula of the United States, fresh off her first WTA title of the year in Austin, was another quick winner, putting away China's Wang Xinyu 6-2, 6-1 in just 62 minutes.Pegula next faces Ukraine's Elina Svitolina, a 6-2, 6-4 winner over Danielle Collins.Medvedev headlined the men's lineup in the combined ATP Masters and WTA 1000 event, but he was barely underway when 20-year-old Michelson retired because of illness after dropping the first two games.""Food poisoning or something like this, these things happen,"" said Medvedev, who was headed to the practice courts to tune up for a fourth-round clash with 10th-seeded American Tommy Paul.Paul beat Britain's 2021 Indian Wells winner Cameron Norrie, now ranked 77th in the world, 6-3, 7-5.Eighth-seeded Stefanos Tsitsipas, coming off his first title in almost a year in Dubai, beat Matteo Berrettini 6-3, 6-3 in a rematch of their Dubai quarter-final last week.Tsitsipas dropped just eight points on his serve as he wrong-footed Italian with a variety of athletic shots, breaking him three times on the way to victory in 68 minutes.After months in the doldrums Tsitsipas said he was relishing a new mental approach to the game.""I just feel like I want to get out there on the court and be a gladiator, and that's how I approach every single match I get to play,"" he said.Tallon Griekspoor , the world No. 43 from the Netherlands who shocked world number two and top seed Alexander Zverev in the second round, backed up his big win with a 7-6 (7/3), 6-3 victory over France's 29th seed Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard.Griekspoor fired 10 aces, dominating the first set tiebreaker, and didn't face a break point in the second set.Griekspoor needed an hour and 16 minutes to secure the win, but in a season in which dropping the first set has become an alarming habit that was fast enough.""It feels nice to win a match in under one and a half hour,"" he said.","Defending champion Iga Swiatek beats Dayana Yastremska 6-0, 6-2 to reach fourth round.

But congratulations to my opponent -- just a bad day in the office, I guess, for me.""Van de Zandschulp has established a notable record against the big guns.His impressive victories include a remarkable win against Alcaraz at the US Open in the previous year, followed by a triumph over Rafael Nadal in Davis Cup, which turned out to be the Spanish legend's final professional match.""I think I kept my cool during the whole match,” said van de Zandschulp. ""I know if I go into the match and lose my cool, especially against the big players, it's going to be a really tough day. That's always one thing I'm trying to do well.""Djokovic reduced his unforced errors significantly in the second set, compared to his 14 mistakes in the first set and swiftly secured a service break, establishing a 3-0 advantage.He celebrated with a fist pump after striking a powerful forehand winner to the corner, earning his first break opportunity of the contest.Despite the intense exchanges continuing throughout, Djokovic's visible signs of frustration emerged occasionally. Although he lost his serve while attempting to close out the set, he succeeded in his subsequent service game, delivering a powerful forehand winner to the baseline to make it an even contest.But the momentum shift proved temporary. Zandschulp maintained consistent pressure through both baseline play and net approaches, as Djokovic's error count increased steadily.Zandschulp gained the upper hand with a break for 3-1, subsequently winning five consecutive games as Djokovic struggled to halt his opponent's progress.Djokovic exit followed a similar shock suffered by world number two Alexander Zverev and fourth-seeded Casper Ruud.The tournament's landscape has shifted dramatically, with world number three Alcaraz emerging as the highest-ranked player remaining, particularly notable given world number one Jannik Sinner's absence due to a three-month drugs suspension.Alcaraz, pursuing a remarkable achievement of three consecutive Indian Wells titles - a feat only accomplished by Djokovic and Roger Federer - commenced his title defence impressively, defeating France's Quentin Halys 6-4, 6-2.The Spanish player secured an early advantage to claim the opening set, before establishing a commanding 4-0 lead in the second set with impressive serving.His dominant display included seven aces and successful defence of the sole break point faced, concluding the match efficiently in 67 minutes.""I was nervous at the beginning of the match,"" he told a supportive crowd. ""The first match is never easy so I was trying to be focused on my game.""I just tried to be relaxed, as relaxed as I can. Can always be better, but I'm ready for the (next) round and excited.""Australian Open winner Madison Keys began proceedings at the combined ATP Masters and WTA 1000 tournament, defeating Russia's Anastasia Potapova 6-3, 6-0 in her first appearance since claiming her first Grand Slam title.Her performance was sharp as she overcame Potapova in 63 minutes.In other early contests, American players Taylor Fritz and Coco Gauff progressed to the next round.Fritz, who won the men's title in 2022, beat Italian qualifier Matteo Gigante 7-5, 6-3, while Gauff -- also seeded third in her section -- secured a hard-fought 6-3, 3-6, 7-6 (7/4) win against Japan's Moyuka Uchijima.","Former world number one Novak Djokovic suffers shock defeat at Indian Wells.

NEW DELHI: India's Lakshya Sen exited the All England Badminton Championships following a straight-game defeat to Chinese world No. 6 Li Shi Feng in the men's singles quarterfinals on Friday. The 2022 finalist, who narrowly missed an Olympic medal in Paris last year, was outplayed 10-21, 16-21 in a 45-minute encounter.Ranked world No. 15, Sen had won his last two encounters against Li, including at the Thomas Cup. However, this time, he struggled against his familiar Chinese rival from the junior class of 2018.Feng dominated early, wrapping up the first game in just 17 minutes. Playing with composure and avoiding unnecessary risks, he surged to a 9-4 lead with a powerful smash and entered the break with an 11-4 advantage. Sen's unsuccessful review left him trailing 4-12, but a brief resurgence saw him reduce the deficit to 7-12 with a sharp cross-court smash. Yet, Feng quickly adjusted, mixing up his pace and tactics to clinch the game.Sen showed improvement in the second game but couldn't match Feng's consistency. Trailing 2-5 initially, Sen fought back with better net play, taking a 10-8 lead after a grueling 37-shot rally. He maintained a slender three-point lead at the break and fought hard in a tight contest, with a marathon 44-shot exchange tying the score at 14-all. However, Feng's aggression proved decisive as he surged ahead 17-15 with a powerful smash.At 15-18, Sen suffered finger bruises, spilling blood on the court and requiring medical attention, leading to a brief stoppage. However, the break did little to disrupt Feng's momentum as he sealed the match with another thunderous smash.Despite the loss, Sen's campaign was commendable, highlighted by his stunning straight-game victory over defending champion Jonatan Christie, avenging his semifinal defeat to the Indonesian last year.With this win, Feng advances to the semifinals to face the winner between top seed Shi Yu Qi and Singapore's Loh Kean Yew.Meanwhile, India's doubles duo Satwiksairaj Rankireddy and Chirag Shetty withdrew due to injury, Malvika Bansod bowed out in women's singles, and the mixed doubles pair of Rohan Kapoor and Ruthvika Shivani Gadde also fell short.","Lakshya Sen loses 10-21, 16-21 to Chinese world No. 6 Li Shi Feng.

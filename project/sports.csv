Star India batter Virat Kohli has recovered from his knee injury and will be available for selection in the second ODI against England at Cuttack on Sunday.Batting coach Sitanshu Kotak confirmed Kohli's fitness status during a pre-match media interaction.""Virat Kohli is fit to play. He has come for practice and is good to go,"" Kotak told mediapersons on the eve of the second game.Kotak remained uncertain about who Kohli would replace in the playing XI.India's chase of 249 in the first ODI began on a shaky note, with Yashasvi Jaiswal and Rohit Sharma departing early, leaving the team at 19/2. However, Shreyas Iyer steadied the innings with a counterattacking 36-ball 59, ensuring India remained on track.After the match, Iyer revealed that his inclusion in the XI was a last-minute decision following Kohli's injury. Now, with Kohli fit to return, the team faces a selection dilemma over who will make way.Kotak acknowledged that he had no role in the final team selection.""That's something for the head coach and captain to decide. Yes, the left-right combination is an important factor, but that's not a question for me to answer,"" he said.Rohit's struggles in the Test format extended to the first ODI, where he was dismissed for just two runs off seven balls.Across his last 16 innings in all formats, Rohit has managed only 166 runs at a disappointing average of 10.37, with just one half-century to his name.""I personally don't see any issue with his form. In his last three ODIs, Rohit has scored 56, 64, and 35,"" Kotak said.""That means he has been averaging over 50 in those matches. We are talking about a player who has 31 ODI centuries. When someone keeps scoring, no one questions when they will fail,"" Kotak, who was appointed in the aftermath of their Australian Test series defeat, added.""Sometimes, a player might have a lean patch, but that doesn't worry me. Yes, in the Australia Test match, it was tough, and he got out early, but in ODIs, he has been performing consistently. So, there's no real concern about his form.""Kotak acknowledged the team's shaky start but emphasised the middle order's crucial contributions in stabilizing the innings.""We lost two early wickets, but there were plenty of positives, especially how our No. 3, 4, and 5 batted. Two big partnerships stood out. Gill, Shreyas, and Axar all played really well,"" he said.""In any match, you might lose wickets, whether it's the openers or the middle order. But overall, as a batting unit, we showed great intent. Even when the required rate was nearly 9-10 runs per over, we didn't let them gain control.""With the Champions Trophy set to commence on February 19 in Dubai and Pakistan, Kotak expressed confidence in their preparation.""The entire team looks solid. Whether there is any experiment, new players will come to the XI or some senior players will be left out. It's the head coach and captain who will discuss and they will decide. So, I don't think I can make any comment on that.""On Mohammed Shami's fitness, Kotak reassured that the pacer was ""completely fit"". Shami returned to the International cricket in the preceding T20I series after a 14-month injury layoff.Asked whether Arshdeep Singh might get a chance, he repeated, ""That decision lies with the head coach and captain.""Regarding Jasprit Bumrah's injury status, he admitted he was unaware of the scan results.

'It’s a slightly two-paced pitch': Harshit Rana after claiming three-wicket haul on ODI debut

MUMBAI: Soon after his blazing 36-ball 59 helped India coast to a four-wicket win over England in the opening ODI in Nagpur, Shreyas Iyer threw in the shocking revelation that he wasn't even in the team's starting XI for the match.In fact, he was busy watching a movie the night before the game, until the extent of Virat Kohli 's knee injury became clear and forced the Mumbai cricketer's last-minute inclusion.Walking in when India, chasing 249, had slipped to 19/2 in the sixth over, the Mumbaikar produced a stunning counter-attack, smashing two sixes and nine fours to leave England floored. ""So (it is a) funny story. I was watching a movie last night. I thought that I could extend my night, but then I got a call from the skipper saying that you may play because Virat has got a swollen knee. And then (I) hurried back to my room, went off to sleep straight away. I'm going to keep it lowkey and just cherish this moment, the victory,"" Iyer told Star Sports. ""I wasn't supposed to play the first game. Virat unfortunately got injured and then I got the opportunity. But I kept myself prepared, I knew that at any point of time I can get a chance to play.""The fact that he wasn't in the XI for the first ODI is surprising. Does Iyer enjoy the full confidence of the team management? It emerges that he was even in danger of not being picked for this series and even the Champions Trophy that follows before better sense prevailed. ""There was quite a fair bit of debate on his inclusion in the lengthy selection meeting in Mumbai recently. Ultimately, those backing him cited his ODI average (47.69), and he was selected,"" a source told TOI.It helped that the selectors didn't forget his fabulous show in the 2023 ODI World Cup, where he scored 530 runs in 11 matches at 66.25, with two centuries (including a 70-ball hundred in the semifinal against New Zealand at the Wankhede Stadium) and three fifties. His sublime form in domestic cricket — the 30-year-old scored 325 runs in five matches at 325 — with two centuries even as Mumbai were knocked out in the Vijay Hazare Trophy , buttressed Iyer's case. Many, including former Australian captain Ricky Ponting , currently the head coach of Punjab Kings, have been left stumped by the fact that Iyer, who was signed up for Rs 26.75 cr in the IPL auction last year, doesn't automatically find a spot in India's white-ball XI.Former India batsman Pravin Amre , who has coached Iyer from a young age at his Shivaji Park Gymkhana academy and then in the Mumbai team and Delhi Capitals, is pleased with the fact that Iyer is a part of the India squad again, considering that he doesn't even have an India contract as of now.""Before he left to join the Indian team for this series, I told him, ‘Wearing the India jersey again should be a proud moment for you. Hold it with both your hands. God is kind that you've got this opportunity (to play for India) again.'""To be in the India squad is a big thing, and I'm very happy that he's there. And now, after the kind of innings that he's played, he's given a good headache to the decision-makers before the next game (should Kohli recover from his injury), and at the same time, shut his critics,"" Amre told TOI.For someone well-versed with minute details about Iyer's batting, what impressed Amre about the batter's innings was the ease with which he tackled the short ball, something often pointed out in the past to pan him. In the seventh over, Iyer smashed Jofra Archer's short balls for back-to-back sixes, pulling the pacer over deep midwicket and ramping him over the third man.""What was pleasing was that even though he was playing for India after more than six months, it never looked like he was playing for his place. He was playing for the team and did what the team needed him to do. When he walked out to bat, India were in trouble and England's pacers were bowling at 140-plus. I liked the way he timed the ball. He wasn't just slogging wildly. He was playing proper cricket shots. I'm just disappointed he got out to a spinner,"" said Amre.",Shreyas Iyer's blistering 59 helped India coast to a four-wicket win over England in the opening ODI in Nagpur. Iyer was even in danger of not being picked for this series and even the Champions Trophy that follows before better sense prevailed.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118047478,imgsize-155506,width-400,resizemode-4/118047478.jpg"

KOCHI: The war of words between the Kerala Cricket Association (KCA) and former Indian pacer S Sreesanth is showing no signs of abating.On Friday, two days after the KCA issued a show cause notice to Sreesanth, they offered a clarification in which they dragged the infamous spot-fixing scandal allegations against the speedster into the issue, which only added fuel to the fire.In its statement, the KCA clarified that the show cause notice was issued to seek an explanation on the false and defamatory statements Sreesanth made against the KCA and not for backing Sanju Samson “The KCA has always protected its players. In fact, the officials of the association visited Sreesanth when he was in jail facing allegations in the spot-fixing scandal in 2013 and offered him support. Though the court quashed the criminal case against him, he was not acquitted in the match-fixing case. So Sreesanth doesn’t need to take up the protection of players,” read the KCA statement.The KCA also mentioned that it wouldn’t tolerate indiscipline and would take strict action against those who spread falsehoods about the state cricket body.Responding to this, Sreesanth said he will continue to support Kerala players. “We need players who dream of playing for the country. I cannot stand with those who try to undermine it. I have faith in law, justice, and fate. I am concerned about those who turn away from the real issues affecting Kerala cricket. Those who released a defamatory press statement against me will have to answer soon,” Sreesanth said.",The Kerala Cricket Association (KCA) and former Indian pacer S Sreesanth are locked in a war of words. The KCA issued a show cause notice to Sreesath two days ago. The association has now dragged the infamous spot-fixing scandal allegations against the speedster into the issue.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118048416,imgsize-43226,width-400,resizemode-4/118048416.jpg"

Yes, in the Australia Test series – that was a tough time. About the One-dayers, the way he batted in the last three One-days before the first match (in Nagpur), he has always been scoring runs.

Brief Scores

NEW DELHI: Shams Mulani and Tanush Kotian put up a resilient 165-run stand for the eighth wicket to help defending champions Mumbai recover to 278 for 8 against Haryana on day one of their Ranji Trophy quarter-final in Kolkata on Saturday.Mumbai's decision to bat first backfired on the opening day as they saw their prominent batsmen struggle early.Ajinkya Rahane (31), Suryakumar Yadav (9), and Shivam Dube (28) contributed to a concerning score of 113 for 7 with Haryana's medium-pace bowler Anshul Kamboj leading the attack effectively with figures of 3 for 58.The batting conditions later improved significantly as the pitch dried up at Eden Gardens.Mulani scored 91 from 178 balls while Kotian, last season's 'Player of the Tournament', remained unbeaten on 85 from 154 balls, capitalizing on scoring opportunities.Though Mumbai may not achieve a substantial total, the partnership between Mulani and Kotian has provided them with a defendable score against Haryana.Earlier, opener Ayush Mhatre was dismissed on the first ball after Rahane opted to bat.The Haryana pace attack, comprising Kamboj, Sumit Kumar (2/57), Anuj Thakral (1/59), and Ajit Chahal (1/21) bowled below 130 kmph. However, they generated significant movement, delivering from 4m to 6m lengths.Mhatre's dismissal came from an inswinger that breached his defense. Sumit Kumar then removed Akash Anand with another incoming delivery that disturbed the off stump.Siddhesh Lad and Suryakumar Yadav fell victim to similar incoming deliveries, showing inadequate footwork. Rahane was dismissed by a late outswinger from Kamboj.Kamboj's consistent performance makes him a strong candidate for India A's upcoming tour to England in late May or early June.Dube's innings ended with a catch at gully, while Shardul offered a return catch to Thakral, leaving Mumbai in a precarious position.The partnership between Mulani and Kotian flourished as batting conditions improved. The Haryana seamers lost their earlier effectiveness when the pitch dried and movement diminished.Spinners Jayant Yadav and Nishant Sindhu struggled to make an impact on the batting-friendly surface. Mulani reached his 19th first-class fifty with a late cut, followed by Kotian's half-century.Mulani's innings, approaching what could have been his second first-class century, concluded when he offered a return catch to former India player Jayant Yadav.Mumbai 1st Innings: 278/8 in 81 overs (Shams Mulani 91, Tanush Kotian 85 batting, Ajinkya Rahane 31, Anshul Kamboj 3/58 in 18 overs).",Shams Mulani and Tanush Kotian put up a resilient 165-run stand for the eighth wicket.

However, his innings was cut short while attempting an aggressive shot.Left-arm spinner Siddharth Desai, who took 2 wickets for 35 runs in 7 overs, dismissed Pujara. The former Test player attempted to play his signature mid-wicket shot but ended up offering a simple catch to short cover.Jani's innings, which included 11 fours and a six off Desai, looked promising until Gaja dismissed him with a rising delivery in the post-lunch session. This wicket triggered a collapse in Saurashtra's innings.Arpit Vasavada tried to stabilize the innings with his unbeaten 39 off 79 balls but struggled to find support from other batsmen.Left-arm seamer Jaymeet Patel dominated the second session, quickly removing Prerak Mankad and Samar Gajjar for low scores. His impressive bowling with bounce and movement further destabilized Saurashtra's batting lineup.The post-lunch session proved particularly difficult for Saurashtra, as they managed only 36 runs while losing four wickets.Gaja claimed two more wickets in the final session, putting Gujarat, the 2016-17 Ranji Trophy champions, in a strong position to build a substantial lead.Saurashtra 1st Innings: 216 in 72.1 overs (Chirag Jani 69, Arpit Vasavada 39 not out, Cheteshwar Pujara 26, Chintan Gaja 4/48).Gujarat 1st Innings: 21/0 in 5 overs (Priyank Panchal 11 batting).",Gujarat captain Chintan Gaja takes four-for on day one of Ranji Trophy quarter- final in Rajkot.

NEW DELHI: Kylian Mbappe 's timely strike secured a hard-fought 1-1 draw for Real Madrid against their fierce rivals Atletico Madrid in a tense La Liga encounter on Saturday.The result maintained Los Blancos' slender one-point lead over Atletico at the top of the table, while also keeping Barcelona within striking distance in third place.The match was a closely contested affair, with both sides displaying their defensive resilience and intensity.Atletico drew first blood in the first half through Julian Alvarez 's controversial penalty, which was awarded after a VAR review for a clumsy challenge by Aurelien Tchouameni on Samuel Lino.Alvarez coolly converted the spot-kick with a cheeky Panenka, much to the frustration of the Real Madrid faithful, who vented their anger towards the officials.However, Real Madrid responded swiftly in the second half, with Mbappe pouncing on a rebound from Jude Bellingham 's blocked shot to level the scores. The French striker's goal on his debut in the heated derby clash underlined his importance to the team and his ability to deliver in crucial moments.The second half saw Real Madrid take control of the proceedings, with Bellingham twice coming agonizingly close to putting his side ahead. The England international's headed efforts were denied by the woodwork and a fine save from Atletico goalkeeper Jan Oblak, who also produced crucial stops to deny Vinicius Junior, Rodrygo, and Mbappe.Despite their dominance, Real Madrid could not find the elusive winner, leaving both teams to settle for a share of the spoils. The result left Carlo Ancelotti 's side clinging to their narrow lead at the summit, while Atletico will rue their inability to capitalize on their first-half advantage.In his post-match comments, Ancelotti acknowledged his team's disappointment at not securing all three points but expressed satisfaction with their continued leadership of the league.""The team is disappointed because they think they deserved more... but we're happy because we're still leaders,"" Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti told reporters. ""In the second half we had total control, we had a lot of chances.""Atletico coach Diego Simeone , on the other hand, lamented his side's lack of composure in front of goal, particularly in the first half.""We had a good first half, but we weren't relaxed enough in front of goal to (score) more,"" said Simeone. ""In the end it was a draw in which both teams think they could have taken more from it.""The hard-fought draw sets the stage for an intriguing midweek clash, as Real Madrid prepare to face Pep Guardiola's Manchester City in the first leg of the Champions League play-off round.Meanwhile, the La Liga title race remains delicately poised, with Barcelona given an opportunity to close the gap on the top two when they face Sevilla on Sunday.",Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid draw 1-1 in La Liga derby on Saturday.

NEW DELHI: Kaoru Mitoma's brilliance propelled Brighton to a 2-1 victory over Chelsea , eliminating the Blues from the FA Cup in the fourth round.

Enzo Maresca, Chelsea's interim manager, lamented the lack of VAR but acknowledged the result's consequences.""I think the handball is quite clear. Without VAR it's complicated,"" Maresca said.""The second half the only shots they had we conceded a goal from. We had a few chances at 2-1.

Diego Forlan

feels the Derbi Madrileno is now similar to El Clasico

Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel.

PANAJI: The Derbi Madrileno or Madrid Derby holds plenty of promise. A depleted Real Madrid and a fired up Atletico Madrid are separated by just a point after 22 matches at the top of the Liga table.When the teams met earlier in the season, it ended 1-1, a feisty game that saw Atletico grab a stoppage time equaliser.The return leg could be a potentially season-defining clash at the Santiago Bernabeu on Saturday, even though Real Madrid are handicapped with several absentees, particularly in defence. Carlo Ancelotti ’s Real are now without Antonio Rudiger and David Alaba, who joined the sick bay alongside right-back Dani Carvajal, regular centre-back Eder Militao and midfielder Eduardo Camavinga.Even a makeshift defence will not dampen Madrid’s enthusiasm at home, feels Diego Forlan, the former Uruguay striker who spent five years at crosstown rivals Atletico (2007-2011) and won the Golden Boot in 2009, during which he scored 32 goals.""I don't think there's any advantage (for Atletico) because of the injuries,"" Forlan told TOI during a global media interaction, arranged by La Liga earlier this week. ""Real Madrid have a deep squad with so much quality. Many important players will be missing, but with a squad that Madrid possess, they are still at the top of the table. Even though they don't have the regular starting XI, I'm sure it's a team that you have to respect, because they will have others (who can dominate).""Forlan scored over 300 goals in a storied career that won him the Golden Ball for the best player at the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa. At the club level, the Uruguayan striker won the Pichichi Trophy — the award for the top goalscorer in a La Liga season — at both Atletico and Villareal. Yet, when it came to the Madrid Derby, Forlan didn't taste similar success.In his four seasons at Atletico between 2007 and 2011, Forlan played eight Madrid derbies that resulted in seven losses and one draw. The lack of success wasn't Forlan's fault; between 1999 and 2013, Atletico didn't win in 25 meetings with Madrid, until the arrival of Diego Simeone eventually changed their fortunes. ""Well, we were close to winning against Real Madrid on several occasions but lost or drew. That trend has now changed. So, whether you're playing at home or away, I think the Derby is a lot more equal today. They are now playing on more equal footing,"" said Forlan.It is Simeone's arrival at Atletico that has helped restore the balance. In the 41 derbies played since then, Atletico have won 12, drawing 14 and losing 15. Madrid, though, continue to be the giants, so does Atletico have anything to prove to their city rivals or the world?""There's nothing to prove, you know, for a side that has been great for the last 10 years, winning lots of trophies (even) at the European level. They've made it to the final of the UEFA Champions League (losing to Madrid). This is an important derby, like El Clasico. Atletico and Madrid have always had great players, the derbies were spectacular. Today, the stakes are a lot higher since it's being watched all over the world,"" said Forlan.While Madrid are struggling at the back, their attacking players are fit and firing. There's Kylian Mbappe – playing his first derby after missing the first leg -- Rodrygo and Vinicius, all striking form. At the other end, there's Julian Alvarez, Antonio Griezmann and, of course, Simeone's son Giuliano, ""a real fighter with similar characteristics (like his father), one of the best signings.""",Diego Forlan feels the Derbi Madrileno is now similar to El Clasico.

NEW DELHI: Manchester United 's FA Cup defence remained alive as they staged a remarkable comeback to defeat Leicester City 2-1 on Friday night at Old Trafford.The match witnessed a fairytale return for former United striker Ruud van Nistelrooy , who was in the opposition dugout as Leicester's interim manager.The first half was a frustrating affair for the home side, as they struggled to create meaningful chances.Leicester took the lead in the 42nd minute through Bobby De Cordova-Reid, who nodded home from close range after Wilfred Ndidi 's initial effort was saved by Andre Onana.United's manager, Ruben Amorim , recognised the need for a change and introduced Alejandro Garnacho at halftime, a move that proved to be a game-changer. The young Argentine winger injected pace and directness into United's attack, causing problems for the Leicester defence.The equaliser arrived midway through the second half when fellow substitute Joshua Zirkzee tapped in from close range after Rasmus Hojlund's flick from Garnacho's cross was blocked.With the momentum firmly in their favour, United pushed for a winner, and it came deep into stoppage time. Harry Maguire rose highest to head home a Bruno Fernandes free-kick, sparking wild celebrations at Old Trafford.While the goal appeared to be offside, the lack of VAR in the FA Cup meant the decision stood, and United secured a hard-fought victory.The match held added significance for Ruud van Nistelrooy, who had enjoyed a brief spell as United's interim manager earlier in the season following the sacking of Erik ten Hag.During his tenure, United had scored eight goals in two games against Leicester, but this time, the Dutchman was on the receiving end of a United comeback.For United, the win provided a much-needed boost after a recent run of poor form at home, where they had suffered five defeats in their previous seven matches across all competitions.The absence of key players like Lisandro Martinez, who sustained a cruciate ligament injury against Crystal Palace, and the January departures of Marcus Rashford and Antony, had left United light in attacking options.However, the introduction of Garnacho and Zirkzee's impact highlighted the depth in United's squad.As the FA Cup defence continues, United will take confidence from their ability to grind out a result against a determined Leicester side. The comeback victory not only kept their hopes of silverware alive but also provided a timely reminder of the resilience and fighting spirit that has been a hallmark of successful United teams throughout their illustrious history.","Manchester United staged a remarkable comeback to defeat Leicester City 2-1 on Friday night at Old Trafford.

The Normalisation Committee has also been at odds with the state-run Pakistan Sports Board, further delaying the constitutional amendments.Earlier this week, PFF Normalisation Committee chairman Haroon Malik cautioned a parliamentary panel that his tenure would end on February 15 and that Pakistan risked suspension if the amendments were not implemented. He clarified that making these amendments did not mean he would be a candidate in the upcoming PFF elections.Malik also revealed that the PFF Congress was unwilling to comply with FIFA’s directives, resulting in the ongoing standoff.This marks the third time Pakistan's football federation has been suspended since 2017.",FIFA has suspended the Pakistan Football Federation for failing to implement constitutional amendments.

Thombare-Hartono back in doubles final

MUMBAI: Maaya Rajeshwaran Revathi came into the L&T Mumbai Open unranked. Check the live WTA rankings now and you will see the promising 15-year-old’s name in 645th spot after she marched into the semifinals of the WTA 125K tournament at the Cricket Club of India here on Friday.Taking on the 285th-ranked Japanese qualifier Mei Yamaguchi in the quarterfinals, Maaya, not for the first time this week, showed why she is regarded as one of India’s bright, young tennis hopes, as she overcame a second-set wobble to win 6-4, 3-6, 6-2 in just under two hours.To put her victory in context, she is the first Indian female to get this far in a WTA tournament at home in singles since Sania Mirza won a Tour event in her home city of Hyderabad in 2005 — over four years before Maaya was born. And to think that she hadn’t actually planned to play in Mumbai to begin with!Having received a wild card to the qualifiers here, Maaya, who recently joined the Rafa Nadal Academy in Mallorca, hasn’t looked back. From earning six ranking points by virtue of winning her two qualifying matches, the Coimbatore teenager has gone on to amass an additional 49 points as a result of her now reaching the semifinals.“It means a lot,” she said, reserving a word of thanks for tournament director Sunder Iyer. “MSLTA and Sunder sir, they gave me this opportunity. I’m really grateful for that, and it all started from there. As I said, wasn’t part of the plan, but they trusted me and gave me an opportunity, and here it is now.”Indeed. Though when she double-faulted to hand Yamaguchi the second set in a game where she was 40-15 up, the outcome of the match was very much in the balance. But Maaya felt she was prepared after coming through both qualifying matches in three sets.“It’s the third third-set victory this week, and all three of them, I took the first and lost the second. So this is not something new for me,” she said, confidently stating that she didn’t feel the need to recalibrate. “The moment I lost the second set, I knew I had to go all out in the third. And whenever I do that, if I get my legs going, I’ll be winning the third set.”While the 25-year-old Japanese began the match stronger of the two, she would suddenly lose rhythm on her serve, allowing Maaya to claw her way back from a 1-3 deficit and clinch the opening set.The second set saw Yamaguchi, playing with a tightly-strapped right thigh, rediscover the sting in her forehand as well as raise her first serve percentage which helped her put pressure on the young Indian. Just as Maaya had done in the opening set, Yamaguchi would break the Indian’s serve for three consecutive games to even the match.But her challenge fizzled in the deciding set, as an exquisite crosscourt backhand winner followed by a crushing forehand return gave Maaya the double break.On Saturday, the fifth seed Jil Teichmann of Switzerland awaits the teenager in the semifinals. Teichmann had extinguished any hope of seeing an all-Indian last four battle when she outclassed Shrivalli Bhamidipaty 6-2, 6-2 earlier in the day.“It’s a very tough match, but it should be the toughest match of the week for me. And she’s a lefty too. I just hope to compete well, no pressure on me,” said Maaya.India’s top-ranked woman doubles player Prarthana Thombare and Dutch partner Arianne Hartono earned themselves another crack at the title here, as they fought back to beat the British-Russian pairing of Eden Silva and Anastasia Tikhonova 2-6, 6-4, 10-2 in the semifinal on Friday. Thombare and Hartono finished runners-up last year, losing to Dalila Jakupovic and Sabrina Santamaria in the final.","Maaya Rajeshwaran Revathi beats Japanese qualifier Mei Yamaguchi 6-4, 3-6, 6-2.

NEW DELHI: Italian qualifier Mattia Bellucci continued his impressive run at the Rotterdam Open , defeating Stefanos Tsitsipas 6-4, 6-2 on Friday to secure a spot in the semi-finals.The world number 12 Tsitsipas struggled against Bellucci's diverse playing style, which featured a strong left-handed serve, flat backhands, and powerful top-spin forehands combined with strategic drop shots.""At the beginning of the week, I would have never expected this result,"" said Bellucci, 23, who had never before reached the semi-final of an ATP 500 event.""I was really enjoying myself on court. Today I think I played even better, technically speaking, against a great opponent but I was in a mindset to fight for every point,"" said the Italian.Bellucci, ranked 92nd globally, had previously showcased his abilities by eliminating second seed Daniil Medvedev in the earlier round.The Italian demonstrated strong defensive skills in the first set, catching Tsitsipas off guard with well-executed drop shots.After breaking Tsitsipas at 4-4, Bellucci successfully served out the set, saving a break point before securing it when his opponent hit a backhand long.The sixth-seeded Greek's difficulties persisted in the second set, with Bellucci breaking serve and establishing a 3-1 lead through skillful drop shots.Tsitsipas contributed to his own defeat by double-faulting on break point, giving up a second break of serve.He managed to save a match point at 5-1, similar to his previous match against Tallon Griekspoor, but couldn't complete another comeback.Bellucci closed out the match confidently, serving to love and earning appreciation from the crowd.His semi-final opponent will be Australia's Alex de Minaur, last year's finalist, who defeated German lucky loser Daniel Altmaier 6-1, 6-4.The tournament's other matches feature world number three Carlos Alcaraz facing fellow Spaniard Pedro Martinez, while Russia's Andrey Rublev competes against Poland's Hubert Hurkacz.","Mattia Bellucci defeats Stefanos Tsitsipas 6-4, 6-2 to reach Rotterdam Open semi-finals.

MUMBAI: It didn't seem like Maaya Rajeshwaran Revathi had done much wrong. She had just completed a 6-4, 6-1 over Belarusian Iryna Shymanovich, finishing the match exactly how she had started it, with an ace. It was not just her first round match of the L&T Mumbai Open , this was her WTA main draw debut, and for most part, the 15-year-old looked to have ticked a lot of the right boxes judging by the applause she drew from the Cricket Club of India crowd here on Tuesday.And yet, the promising teenager wasn't totally pleased with her performance while reflecting on it later. “Well, one thing is that I think I played my qualifying rounds better than today. So one thing that I'm happy about is that I managed to win even though I didn't play my best today,” Maaya would say.Winning despite not being at your best! That's a trait that the man whose famous academy Maaya currently trains at often fell back on over the course of his storied career. For now, she is still in the early days of her one-year stint at the Rafa Nadal Academy in Mallorca, and apart from saying “it's going good” and mentioning a “small conversation” she had with Toni, Rafa's uncle and long-time coach, there's not much else Maaya can share just yet.Her racket, however, did the talking against the 225th-ranked Shymanovich, who, Maaya happened to learn would be her opponent “just five minutes” before she was to step on court.As she and Shymanovich were hitting to each other in the warm-up, a livescoring app still showed Yuriko Miyazaki of Great Britain as Maaya's opponent. Miyazaki was forced to withdraw due to illness.Did the late twist throw Maaya off in any way? “Nah, because either way, I didn't know anything about my previous opponent. The same applies to this (player),” the Coimbatore girl grinned.There was notable support for Maaya in the crowd as Grand Slam doubles champion Rohan Bopanna followed the youngster's progress over the first set. “I'm really honoured to have him here because I think he flew down to watch this match and I'm really happy that he was here,” she said.Tuesday's win coupled with her two victories in the qualifiers have earned Maaya 21 WTA ranking points, taking her total points tally to 24 and earning her an entry into the WTA rankings.She will take on Zarina Diyas in the second round, after the Kazakh eliminated defending champion Darja Semenistaja 6-3, 6-3.Meanwhile, Ankita Raina and Shrivalli Bhamidipaty were the other Indian players to advance to the last 16 stage on Tuesday. Raina proved too strong for compatriot Vaishnavi Adkar, coming through 6-2, 6-2, while Bhamidipaty produced a devastating display to take out the 182nd-ranked Elena Pridankina of Russia 6-1, 6-0 in just 64 minutes.","Maaya Rajeshwaran Revathi beat Belarusian Iryna Shymanovich 6-4, 6-1.

Indian tennis star Sumit Nagal reaches pre-quarterfinals at Rosario Challenger,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/indian-tennis-star-sumit-nagal-reaches-pre-quarterfinals-at-rosario-challenger/articleshow/117908818.cms,"(@nagalsumit Photo on X)

NEW DELHI: Indian tennis player Sumit Nagal secured his place in the pre-quarterfinals following a resilient victory against Argentina's Renzo Olivo in a notable advancement at the 2025 Rosario Challenger .The match concluded with scores of 5-7, 6-1, 6-0 in favour of Nagal, who is the eighth seed in the tournament. This victory marks a significant achievement for the 27-year-old Indian, displaying his ability to recover and dominate after an initial setback.Nagal's next opponent will be determined by the outcome of the match between Tseng Chun-hsin from Chinese Taipei and Bolivia's Hugo Dellien .This triumph comes at a crucial time for Nagal, who recently experienced a decline in his professional standing.Prior to this event, he had fallen out of the ATP top-100 rankings, a position he had maintained for 10 consecutive months since March 2024.This drop was attributed to a series of disappointing performances, with Nagal securing only three main draw victories in 18 tournaments since Wimbledon 2024.Despite this, his earlier entry into the top-100 in February 2024, following a commendable performance at a Grand Slam event, underscores his potential and skill on the international stage.In related developments within Indian tennis, veteran doubles player Rohan Bopanna , aged 44, has also experienced a setback, falling five places to No. 21 in the rankings.This decline followed an early exit from the Australian Open, where he was unable to defend the points from his previous championship win.Bopanna's attempt to retain his standing, alongside new partner Nicolas Barrientos, ended prematurely in the opening round of the competition.Other Indian players, including Sasikumar Mukund, Ramkumar Ramanathan, Karan Singh, and Aryan Shah, maintain their positions within the top-600 in singles rankings.In doubles, alongside Bopanna, players such as Yuki Bhambri, N Sriram Balaji, Rithvik Choudary Bollipalli, and Arjun Kadhe are within the top-100.","Indian tennis player Sumit Nagal secured his place in the pre-quarterfinals following a resilient victory against Argentina's Renzo Olivo.

Anand Amritraj slams Indian stars for skipping Davis Cup,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/anand-amritraj-slams-indian-stars-for-skipping-davis-cup/articleshow/117900335.cms,"MUMBAI: Former India Davis Cup captain Anand Amritaj has ripped into the country's top-ranked players who have recently turned down the chance to represent the nation in the prestigious team competition.India's expected demolition of minnows Togo in New Delhi on Sunday came without top singles player Sumit Nagal and Yuki Bhambri , the second ranked doubles player in the country.Nagal's case particularly garnered attention after the All India Tennis Association (Aita) had recently claimed that the 27-year-old had demanded an annual fee of $50,000 to play Davis Cup ties for India. The player defended his stand in a lengthy post on social media, saying ""it is standard practice in professional sports for athletes to be compensated for their participation in events, even when representing their country"".Amritraj , who worked with Nagal when he held the role of captain a few years ago, described the idea as ""inconceivable"".""To me personally, it is just inconceivable that if you are ranked high enough and the country wants you to play, that you would play without any financial compensation,"" Amritraj told reporters here on the sidelines of the L&T Mumbai Open at the Cricket Club of India on Monday.""Unless you are injured and you can't walk on the court, other than that, there should be no question that you're going to play Davis Cup. Same for me, same for Vijay,"" he added, referring to his brother with whom he helped India reach the 1974 Davis Cup finals against South Africa.""Both of us felt that it is the greatest honour that you can have to play for your country. Maybe this is old-school thinking, but that is absolutely how it should be.""You got 50 weeks in the year to make money, two weeks of the year, you should be able to give to places you grew up in, and it should be an honour and a privilege.""On Nagal's case, the 73-yearold said: ""I like Sumit, when I was captain he was the reserve on my team five years ago. I got along very well with him, but he didn't play the last tie (vs Sweden in Sept) either, which is really a shame because he is our best player right now.""Asked if there should be strong repercussions for players who choose to not turn up for national team duties, Amritraj said it was a tricky situation as players could always lean on the ""independence of the ATP Tour "" to make their decisions.With some Indian players, however, enjoying government funding through programmes like the Target Olympic Podium Scheme (TOPS), it could be a way for Aita to crack the whip, Amritraj felt.""That's where you should put the screws on them. I think you should definitely do that. If you're in any kind of place with some leverage, you should say: 'Either you play Davis Cup, or you won't get this'. Simple.""","Top-ranked players Sumit Nagal and Yuki Bhambri turned down chance to represent India.

"Handed wildcards, Indians have a point to prove",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/handed-wildcards-indians-have-a-point-to-prove/articleshow/117891061.cms,"Ramkumar Ramanathan

CHENNAI: Indian tennis is not going through the best of times. While its top-ranked singles player Sumit Nagal has made good strides in recent years, the rest of the crop has struggled in the journey to the top.The player distribution in the Chennai Open Challenger best explains the current scenario. Even in a home tournament, India, in the absence of Nagal, is forced to rely on wildcards for main-draw singles entries as the next-best players from the country find it difficult to directly make the cut. Davis Cuppers Mukund Sasikumar (ranked 365), Ramkumar Ramanathan (406) and Karan Singh will have a point to prove after being awarded wildcards by the organisers.The onus will be on the experienced Ramkumar and Mukund to gain valuable points to move up in the rankings chart. The 28-year-old Mukund had a good run in Chennai last year, reaching the quarterfinals, but could not carry forward the momentum in the tournaments that followed. Ramkumar’s story in the past few years has not been much different, with the 30-year-old’s inconsistency hampering his chances to move to a higher level. Youngster Karan has shown promise in the early stages of his career and is steadily rising up the ladder.Moving to foreign interest, quite a few players are looking to resurrect their careers and compete in the Grand Slams. For instance, Lloyd Harris, who is the second seed in singles, was once ranked as high as 31 and reached the quarterfinals of the US Open in 2021. Injury issues forced the South African to stay away from action for quite a long period and the 27-year-old will compete in his first match since the Wimbledon last year.Former world No. 35 Jiri Vesely had to sit out in 2023 due to injury concerns. The 31-year-old had won the ATP 250 title in Pune in 2020 and had a good time in India in the past. Ahead of the Chennai Open, Vesely said: “Preparations have been good and I am getting used to the weather, but it is not easy. It is always nice to be in India and people are very friendly and supportive. I love coming back here and I hope to have a good run on this trip.”Vesely dropped outside the top-600 a few years ago and since then, he has found it tough to be back to his best. “I wish to move up and it is not easy. A lot of youngsters are playing well and I need to compete with them and give my best.”","India's top-ranked singles player Sumit Nagal has made good strides in recent years.

Jacopo Berrettini looks up to brother Matteo to climb the ladder,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/jacopo-berrettini-looks-up-to-brother-matteo-to-climb-the-ladder/articleshow/117890986.cms,"Jacopo Berrettini

CHENNAI: Italian tennis player Jacopo Berrettini does not have to look far for inspiration. The 26-year-old shares a strong bond with his elder brother Matteo Berrettini , a former top-10 singles player and 2021 Wimbledon finalist, whom he regards not only his best friend but also his idol.“I have a good relationship with him. He is a very good human, and I am so glad and lucky to have him. Apart from on-court training, he mentors me off the field and is a good coach. We shared the same (coaching) team for the past three years and now share the same trainer. Before coming here, we trained together for three days in Rome,” Jacopo, who will begin his season at the Chennai Open Challenger , told TOI on Saturday.Jacopo and Matteo had a tough 2023 as their seasons were marred by injuries. Matteo had to take a six-month break, while Jacopo had to miss the majority of the year. In that period, the Berrettini brothers helped each other stay mentally strong. “It was a very tough period for us, for our family. We were trying to be the humans that we are, trying to stay mentally focused and healthy. We had to work a lot after recovery because this sport is so tough mentally and physically. We were trying to enjoy life outside the sport as it is very important as well. After suffering from a lot of injuries, Matteo had a good season last year,” Jacopo added.While Jacopo and Matteo do not spend much time together due to their playing commitments, they are always in touch. “We try to talk often and as much as we can. Sometimes, we train together, but if we are not able to spend a lot of time, it is okay since we travel and play regularly. We are healthy and that is a good thing for us.”‘Aim to carry forward momentum’: Jacopo had a productive season last year and achieved his career-best singles ranking of 317. The Italian will look to carry forward the momentum, starting with his season opener in Chennai. “It was a good year (2024) for me, playing many matches without any injury concerns. I worked on many aspects and will try to keep going. My goal for this year is to compete in the qualifiers of the Grand Slams, for which I have to get close to the 230 mark (rankings).”",Italian tennis player Jacopo Berrettini shares a strong bond with his elder brother Matteo.

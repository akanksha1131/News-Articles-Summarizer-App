Rohit Sharma opens up on India winning Women's World Cup, & why it was special

If you judged Gautam Gambhir purely through the lens of India’s Test results, you might assume his stint is spiralling. India have just endured a brutal 408-run defeat to South Africa in Guwahati, slipped to a 2-0 home series loss, and the calls for a separate red-ball coach have grown louder than ever.Yet Gambhir’s white-ball track record tells an entirely different tale. This is the same man who has already guided India to the 2025 Champions Trophy and the Asia Cup , while pushing the team towards a far more adventurous limited-overs identity. That is the version of “GG” that Ravichandran Ashwin chose to spotlight during a recent YouTube conversation with AB de Villiers . What began as a question on Gambhir soon turned into Ashwin’s endorsement of India’s evolving T20 blueprint.Ashwin did not hold back while evaluating Gambhir’s impact. “I think GG, the white-ball coach, has already left a bit of a stamp,” he remarked, a sentence that takes on extra significance given the current climate. Gambhir, in Ashwin’s view, has broken old hierarchies in T20 cricket and prioritised bolder, more proactive cricketers. The former KKR captain seems to be reshaping India’s limited-overs personality with the same intensity he once brought to franchise dressing rooms.Ashwin then widened the lens, crediting the IPL for fuelling this shift. “That is a lot of credit to the IPL… it’s thrown up some stunning white-ball cricketers for India,” he said. For Gambhir, the IPL isn’t just a tournament; it has been the backbone of his coaching journey from Lucknow to KKR and now to a national side full of franchise-hardened talent.And for Ashwin, one name symbolises this pipeline perfectly: Abhishek Sharma . “That’s one cricketer I would love to watch out for again in the T20 format. His exploits around the format will dictate where India go in the T20 World Cup,” Ashwin noted, highlighting Abhishek as a key link between domestic innovation and international ambition.The discussion then shifted towards the philosophy behind India’s new direction. Ashwin emphasised the value of unrestrained batting, something he himself yearned for during his time in T20 internationals. “A fearless brand of cricket which we always wanted to happen,” he said, pleased that the shift has finally arrived after his retirement.Ashwin also touched upon the delicate equilibrium every modern T20 side needs: controlled aggression. With Suryakumar Yadav leading the pack, he believes India have a team capable of intimidating any opposition. There will be flaws, he admitted, but with Bumrah anchoring the defensive bowling and a well-rounded squad around him, India appear well set.Amid the noise surrounding India’s Test decline, Ashwin has essentially split Gambhir’s coaching tenure into two contrasting chapters. One is under heavy scrutiny after the Guwahati collapse. The other already boasts a Champions Trophy, an Asia Cup, an elite T20 captain, the world’s premier death bowler, and a fearless left-handed opener redefining the top order.And that, Ashwin suggests, is the version of Gambhir that has already carved a clear imprint on Indian cricket.","Gautam Gambhir has already guided India to the 2025 Champions Trophy and the Asia Cup. Ravichandran Ashwin has praised the impact of the former KKR captain on India's limited-overs team. Ashwin also highlighted the value of unrestrained batting, something he himself yearned for.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125650114,imgsize-88654,width-400,resizemode-4/england-v-india-1st-rothesay-test-match-day-five.jpg"

Morne Morkel Press Conference: Virat Kohli-Rohit Sharma set for 2027 WC, Shreyas Iyer Update & More

NEW DELHI: Excitement is rising ahead of the opening ODI of the three-match India–South Africa series, which begins in Ranchi on Sunday. The reason is clear — two modern-day greats, Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma , are set to return to action. Fans have already begun gathering in large numbers, eager for a glimpse of the superstar duo as India prepares for a crucial white-ball contest.Rohit and Kohli were last seen during India’s tour of Australia. With both now ready to step back onto the field, expectations are soaring. The focus will firmly be on them, and fans will hope their performances do the talking this time.Their intensity during practice has already grabbed attention. The two senior cricketers trained with full commitment, exchanging light-hearted moments, high fives and smiles throughout the session.One clip that quickly went viral showed Rohit smashing a six off a net bowler, then casually walking down the pitch and flashing a playful wink and smile at Kohli as he stepped in for his turn. The two shared a laugh — a moment that reflected their ease, camaraderie and competitive drive.This ODI series carries extra weight following India’s disappointing 2-0 Test loss to South Africa at home. A strong showing in the 50-over format will be crucial in lifting morale and restoring momentum for the Men in Blue.Both Rohit and Kohli retired from Test and T20I cricket earlier this year, choosing to focus solely on ODIs. Their vast experience and leadership continue to be vital, and selectors have shown full faith by including them for this important series.With Ranchi gearing up, expectations are sky-high. Fans await nothing less than fireworks from two icons who have defined an era of Indian cricket — and now look ready to script another memorable chapter.The ODIs will be held on November 30 in Ranchi, December 3 in Raipur, and December 6 in Visakhapatnam.","Rohit and Kohli were last seen during India’s tour of Australia.

NEW DELHI: Virat Kohli is set to return to action when India take on South Africa in the opening ODI at the JSCA International Stadium in Ranchi on Sunday. The three-match series runs from December 1 to December 6, and the 36-year-old will be eager to build on the form he rediscovered during the ODI leg of the Australia tour — a phase that began with back-to-back ducks but ended with a composed 74* in a match-winning stand alongside Rohit Sharma.Kohli’s numbers against South Africa underline his impact in this rivalry.

Gautam Gambhir fiery press conference: On whitewash, Rishabh Pant shot, pitch and more

NEW DELHI: Former India spinner Harbhajan Singh did not hold back after India slipped to their second home Test series defeat against South Africa. He said that if Indian cricket wants to protect its “future generations”, the team management must rethink its approach to home pitches and move away from heavily spin-assisted surfaces that previously helped them dominate for over a decade — a run that ended when New Zealand handed India a whitewash last year.Speaking on his YouTube channel, Harbhajan criticised the current standards of Test preparation, saying Indian players have forgotten how to compete over five days because of surfaces that consistently produce two- or three-day matches. He added that the nature of these pitches contributed to declining batting numbers for stars like Virat Kohli Cheteshwar Pujara and Ajinkya Rahane, eventually leading to their exit from the Test setup.""We do not know how to play matches for five days. We have got so used to playing so many matches on wickets where matches last for two-three days... Nowadays, it has reduced averages of our batters like Virat Kohli, Pujara, Rahane to 35-40 from 50... Our old greats were greats because they knew how to play five days of Test match cricket.""He urged Indian cricket to move on from its past and prioritise better pitches over favourable results.""For the betterment of Indian cricket, I think they should forget what has happened in the last 10 to 12 years... start playing on better wickets to save the future generation of Indian cricket.""Harbhajan added that Test cricket demands patience and discipline — qualities he feels have faded due to recent conditions.""The kind of temperament needed to play Test cricket requires effort, hard work, discipline, and I feel that for many years this has been missing.""He further argued that good wickets produce fair contests and reveal the true winner over the full duration of a match.""But what happens on a good wicket? A good wicket makes the game last five days... This lottery type situation, earlier New Zealand got lucky, now South Africa got lucky...""Harbhajan also analysed India’s performance in Guwahati, where the pitch appeared fair and the match reached the final day — yet India collapsed twice.""South Africa won the toss on this pitch and made 489... And then in the second innings, Team India collapsed for 140... So this is not just the fault of the pitch. I feel the biggest fault is your temperament.""South Africa dominated the Test through strong batting contributions led by Senuran Muthusamy’s maiden century and Marco Jansen’s explosive 93. Jansen, who also took 6/48 in the first innings, dismantled India’s batting order before Simon Harmer completed the rout with a match-winning 6/37 in the second innings. Ravindra Jadeja’s fifty and Sai Sudarshan’s gritty 139-ball vigil were among the few bright moments in a forgettable chase of 549.South Africa sealed a commanding 408-run win, with Harmer finishing as Player of the Series for his 17 wickets across two Tests, while Jansen claimed the Player of the Match award for his all-round brilliance.",Former India spinner Harbhajan Singh criticises current standards of Test preparation. He says Indian players have forgotten how to compete over five days because of surfaces that consistently produce two- or three-day matches.

Smriti Mandhana To Skip 'Kaun Banega Crorepati' Episode?

NEW DELHI: India’s Women’s World Cup hero Jemimah Rodrigues has withdrawn from the remainder of the Women’s Big Bash League (WBBL) season, choosing to stay back home to support close friend and teammate Smriti Mandhana after her wedding was postponed due to a sudden health issue concerning Mandhana’s father. Jemimah, who had flown to India 10 days ago after Brisbane Heat’s match against Hobart Hurricanes for what was supposed to be a brief pre-arranged trip, was scheduled to rejoin her WBBL side this week. But with the unforeseen development, she requested a release — one the franchise agreed to without hesitation.“The Brisbane Heat have agreed to a request to release Jemimah Rodrigues from the remainder of the Women’s Big Bash League,” the club announced in a statement. It confirmed that Rodrigues “returned home to India” for Mandhana’s wedding but stayed back after the celebrations were “subsequently postponed due to a health issue with Mandhana's father.”The Heat said they fully supported Jemimah’s decision: “Rodrigues will stay in India to support her teammate, and the Heat has agreed to her not returning for the final four games of the WBBL season.”Jemimah, who was Brisbane Heat’s No.1 pick in the International Player Draft this year, had been in strong form and remains a key figure in India’s cricketing rise.She was instrumental in India clinching their maiden Women’s World Cup title, smashing an unbeaten century in the semifinal against seven-time champions Australia — a knock that has already entered Indian cricket folklore.Brisbane Heat CEO Terry Svenson called it “a challenging time” for the 24-year-old. “While it is unfortunate that she will take no further part in the WBBL, we were more than willing to agree to her request to remain in India,” he said. “The Heat club obviously wish her and Smriti Mandhana's family all the best. Jemi told us she was disappointed not to be coming back and has passed on her appreciation to the club and the fans for being so understanding. ”With Rodrigues staying back, the Heat will now play their final league games without one of their biggest international stars — but with full empathy for her decision.",Jemimah Rodrigues has withdrawn from the remainder of the Women's Big Bash League.

Look who is back! Virat Kohli arrives for the ODI series vs South Africa

WATCH: Dhoni driving Kohli back to hotel

NEW DELHI: In one of the most heart-warming off-field moments Indian cricket has witnessed in recent years, a video of MS Dhoni personally driving Virat Kohli back to the Indian team hotel after a private dinner at his Ranchi residence set social media into a frenzy on Thursday night. The clip, shared widely by fans on X, shows Dhoni behind the wheel of his SUV with Kohli seated beside him — a rare yet deeply nostalgic sight that instantly triggered a wave of emotional reactions across the cricket community.The former India captain hosted Kohli and wicketkeeper-batter Rishabh Pant at his Ranchi farmhouse on November 27, a quiet evening that turned into an internet-breaking reunion once fans spotted Kohli entering the Dhoni residence. Hours later, Dhoni drove Kohli back — no security entourage, no flashy escort — resurrected memories of their long partnership that shaped Indian cricket for more than a decade. While sharing the video, Star Sports even captioned it the “Reunion of the Year.”Kohli, who returned to India from London on Wednesday, is in Ranchi ahead of the first ODI against South Africa on November 30. The series marks his comeback to Ranchi for a match after missing the England Test in February 2024, the last time the city hosted an international match, due to the birth of his son, Akaay.He last featured for India on October 25 in Sydney, where his unbeaten 74 helped India avoid a whitewash against Australia.As Team India prepares for the three-match ODI series — with KL Rahul leading the side due to injuries to Shubman Gill and Shreyas Iyer — Kohli is set to slot back at No. 3. His ODI numbers remain unmatched: 14,255 runs, 51 centuries, and record-breaking consistency across formats.Pant, meanwhile, returns to the ODI setup after more than a year as India aim to bounce back following the Test series defeat to South Africa. With Rohit Sharma , Yashasvi Jaiswal, and a revamped middle order, the team will look to start strong in Ranchi.","MS Dhoni personally drives Virat Kohli back to the Indian team hotel after a private dinner at his Ranchi residence.

ALSO READ:

NEW DELHI: Chess-wise, Wednesday was a day of celebration. Edging toward its final month, the year produced its second 19-year-old, and youngest-ever, World Cup winner. The first, of course, was India’s own Divya Deshmukh, who brought home the women’s title earlier this year. The second is Uzbekistan’s Javokhir Sindarov, a name not many would have pencilled in while predicting the line-up for the 2026 Candidates.But with the title in Goa, Sindarov booked the ticket for the 2026 Candidates, where he will attempt to earn a shot at D Gukesh’s World Championship title.Much like Divya, who had entered the fray as the 15th seed during her career-defining triumph in Georgia, Sindarov too was far from the favourites. Remarkably just a day older than Divya, the Uzbek teenager began as the 16th seed and capitalised brilliantly on the knock-out format, stringing together a dream run that ultimately carried him to the title.Yet beneath the celebration lay disappointment and the void of a missed chance.India hosted the World Cup after 23 long years, with a record 24 home players in the field, but not one made the top three qualifying spots for the Candidates.Arjun Erigaisi came the closest before bowing out in the quarterfinals with a defeat to China’s Wei Yi, who finished runner-up.So the question remains: what went wrong for the Indians?Just around a month back, the journey of the World Cup began with 206 players from across the globe. Known for its gruelling 90+30 time control and subsequent rapid tie-breaks, it’s one of the few elite events that works entirely on knockout. In short: one bad day and you’re out.""FIDE World Cup is a type of tournament where everybody out of the top 10 or 20 has a 15% chance of winning,"" GM Levon Aronian had said before the tournament began.The match structure mostly favours the lower-rated player.“It’s just two classical games… quite often the sides that are more or less not as highly rated will make a draw with white and wait for their chance (with black). Everything can happen in one single game,” Levon recently told TimesofIndia.com.Playing with White, a higher-rated player often feels obliged to press, to prove an advantage from the first move. But that freedom can backfire. In a knockout format, the player with Black can simply stay solid, wait for a slip, and suddenly the burden shifts. This year, in both the Women’s and Open World Cups, several matches hinged on a single game where White overreached and paid the price.India’s top seeds weren’t immune. Gukesh, Arjun Erigaisi, Pentala Harikrishna, Vidit Gujrathi, and Aravindh Chithambaram, all ranked within the top 25, were knocked out by lower-rated opponents, and in every case, the decisive loss came with the White pieces.Who doesn't want to flaunt in front of the home crowd? The FIDE World Cup gave Indian players a chance. But were they ready?Playing at home brings comfort, support, and a very particular kind of pressure. A roaring crowd can uplift but also suffocate. Expectations aren’t spoken so much as felt.""Of course, it attracts so much pressure, but I think I would've to get into a mindset where it doesn't affect my chess,"" GM Pranesh M told TimesofIndia.com ahead of the FIDE World Cup.In a sport where calmness is oxygen, emotional wobble can flip a stable position into disaster. Hosting the event was a milestone for India, but also a weight not everyone carried equally well.Besides the title, branded as the Viswanathan Anand Trophy, three Candidates’ spots were up for grabs. With 206 participants, everyone had a realistic chance of making the Candidates.While the path is wider -- ratings, Grand Swiss, FIDE Circuit -- for top Indians, others saw the FIDE World Cup as their only way into the Candidates.Decades ago, World Championship qualification had one winding but clear pathway: nationals, zonals, inter-zonals, then Candidates""The world was divided into several zones, and if you played well in the interzonal championships, you would thereby qualify for the Candidates Tournament. So there was one single channel through which everybody could qualify,"" Veteran Grandmaster Pravin Thipsay told this website.""Today, if you look at it, there are at least 500 players strong enough to become surprise candidates and emerge into the last eight. At least 500 players are capable of doing that if they perform at their best.""But now we have various phases and various seedings. Some top players get seeded by rating, while others get seeded by virtue of playing in Grand Swiss tournaments, which are again restricted only to very strong players.""For many top Indians, having multiple routes to Candidates' qualification works as a safety net, whereas there is no such thing for others.""So a large number, five out of eight, qualify through these different channels, and only three players qualify through what may be called the proper channel… for a common player, this is the only channel. So one could say that the common player is more motivated in this particular tournament,"" the veteran Grandmaster added.And it was not as if Indians left the field without a fight; many showed that hunger. Diptayan Ghosh upset Ian Nepomniachtchi early, while Pranav V, SL Narayanan, and Harikrishna pushed deep into the field. But hunger is only one ingredient. Consistency in chaos is another.There is a growing concern in the Indian chess fraternity. With trainers and coaches more inclined towards AI and chess engines, the creativity on the board is somewhat evaporating.""Now everybody has the best engines and powerful hardware, so there’s very little that separates one player from another... Earlier, it wasn’t like that -- you had to sit for hours, work through lines, go deeper yourself. There was always a horizon effect; after a few moves, the engine stopped seeing clearly,"" Vidit Gujhrathi told TimesofIndia.com recently during an exclusive interview.""But today, with neural-network-based AI, engines give you answers immediately. So the barrier to learning openings has dropped significantly. And chess, by its nature, is a draw-ish game. If both sides play perfectly, the most likely result is a draw, maybe 51–49 either way.”And once a match enters a tie-break, it's anyone's game.""Are we really thinking about chess? Are we playing creative chess ourselves? Do we know where we end our preparation? Do we actually know what is to be done next?"" Thipsay asked.""Otherwise, this preparation has no value. And you end up playing to get a better position according to the engine. And you do not know what the plan is to be made. Those who are shrewd and intelligent enough to apply this policy of preparing well at the same time find out what is to be done next.""Both in the Women's World Cup and the Open section in Goa, those who put creativity over engines had the last laugh. It perhaps leaves a lesson for the future.And even if the Indian challenge faded in the air at the Goa World Cup, all hope is not lost, with R Praggnanandhaa closing in on securing the final Candidates spot available through the FIDE Circuit.For India, that would ensure at least one representation in the Candidates. The number could well have been more than one. But as they say, it's what it is.","Uzbekistan’s Javokhir Sindarov won the FIDE Chess World Cup 2025.

Coach Gautam Gambhir, chief selector Ajit Agarkar need to get their act right

Poll What do you believe is the primary issue with India's performance under Gambhir? Coaching strategy Player mentality Lack of experience

NEW DELHI: India's stunning 2-0 whitewash at the hands of South Africa in Guwahati on Wednesday has once again brought Gautam Gambhir 's role as head coach under intense scrutiny. This is the second time India have been blanked in a Test series under Gambhir, following last year's humiliating defeat in New Zealand. The latest setback has triggered sharp criticism from several former cricketers and experts, but none more dramatic and thought-provoking than AB de Villiers ' assessment of Gambhir's leadership style.Speaking on Ravichandran Ashwin 's YouTube channel, De Villiers offered a candid and layered view of Gambhir — one that balanced both concern and perspective. Drawing from his experience of playing against Gambhir for years, the South African great suggested that emotions may be at the heart of India's current coaching debate.“I don't know what GG is like when it comes to leadership,” he began. “I've known him as an emotional player, and if that is the case in the change room, generally an emotional coach is not a good thing to have.”The remark instantly struck a chord in the cricketing world, fuelling questions about whether Gambhir's intensity — once his greatest strength — is working against him in a dressing room that appears increasingly unsettled.However, De Villiers didn't stop at criticism. He made it equally clear that there is no fixed formula for a successful coach. “It's not to say he's that kind of a coach behind the scenes. There's no right and wrong. Some players feel comfortable with a former player, some with someone who's never played but has years of coaching experience.”He further admitted that he had never worked directly with Gambhir, Morne Morkel or Ryan ten Doeschate inside the Indian setup, making it difficult to fully judge the internal dynamics. But he contrasted the situation sharply with his admiration for South Africa's current head coach, Shukri Conrad, crediting him for restoring calm and clarity.“I absolutely loved playing under Gary Kirsten; he's a former player and similar to Gautam Gambhir,” ABD added. “Some players find confidence with a former great being there — someone who inspires you to put in extra yards.”As Team India reels from another home debacle, De Villiers' comments have added a dramatic edge to a debate that is unlikely to fade soon.",Gambhir under intense scrutiny after India's 2-0 whitewash at the hands of South Africa in Guwahati.

WPL Auction 2026: Full Breakdown of Every Major Number

Australia second Ashes Test squad:

Steve Smith (c), Scott Boland, Alex Carey, Brendan Doggett, Cameron Green, Travis Head, Josh Inglis, Usman Khawaja, Marnus Labuschagne, Nathan Lyon, Michael Neser, Mitchell Starc, Jake Weatherald, Beau Webster

Australia have resisted the temptation to rush back their two premier fast bowlers, Pat Cummins and Josh Hazlewood, naming an unchanged 14-man squad for the second Ashes Test beginning Thursday at the Gabba. The decision means Cummins’ anticipated return will be delayed by another two weeks, while Hazlewood also remains unavailable as he continues his recovery from a hamstring strain.Cummins, who missed the first Test in Perth due to lumbar stress, trained impressively this week — bowling at full tilt with the pink ball at the SCG and completing long spells to skipper Steve Smith. Despite showing visible signs of improvement, selectors opted for caution, unwilling to risk their captain so early in the five-match series. He will travel with the squad to Brisbane but will target a comeback in the third Test in Adelaide starting December 17.Hazlewood, too, bowled during the week but was seen using a red ball rather than the pink used for the upcoming day-night clash, a clear indicator that his fitness timeline remains conservative.Coach Andrew McDonald has expressed optimism about his availability later in the series but ruled out any premature return.The decision keeps Queensland quick Brendan Doggett in prime position to retain his spot in the XI after a superb debut in Perth, where he claimed five wickets and impressed with his control and temperament.Veteran opener Usman Khawaja has been included in the squad but must prove his fitness after back spasms forced him to sit out Australia’s second innings in the opening Test. Travis Head, who blitzed the second-fastest century in Ashes history while filling in at the top, remains flexible about his batting position. McDonald hinted that Australia will reassess their batting order once Khawaja’s condition becomes clearer.Meanwhile, England have arrived in Brisbane but have surprisingly opted against pink-ball match practice, with only squad members Jacob Bethell, Matthew Potts and Josh Tongue set to feature against the Prime Minister’s XI. Ben Stokes’ men will begin training at the Gabba on Sunday as they attempt to level the series after Australia’s eight-wicket win in Perth.",Australia have named an unchanged 14-man squad for the second Ashes Test beginning Thursday at the Gabba.

Pakistan star batter Babar Azam endured a night to forget in Rawalpindi on Thursday, as he registered yet another duck — a moment that now places him alongside Umar Akmal and Saim Ayub for the most ducks by a Pakistani in T20 internationals. The 31-year-old was dismissed for a two-ball duck during Pakistan’s tense chase against Sri Lanka in the sixth match of the ongoing T20I tri-series.Chasing 185, Pakistan looked towards their premier batter for stability after early jolts. Instead, Babar walked back without scoring after Dushmantha Chameera trapped him plumb in front on the final ball of the fourth over. What made the moment even more striking was its historic weight: It was Babar’s 10th T20I duck, pulling him level with Umar Akmal and Saim Ayub atop Pakistan’s unwanted list.Globally, the unwanted list is led by Sri Lanka’s former captain Dasun Shanaka, who holds the all-time record with 15 T20I ducks. Six players sit on 13, while ex-India captain Rohit Sharma ended his career with 12.While Babar faltered, Sri Lanka delivered a statement win under high pressure.The visitors needed victory to reach the final and did exactly that, edging Pakistan by six runs in a thriller decided in the last over. Fast bowler Dushmantha Chameera was the star, claiming 4 for 20 and closing out the match by conceding just three runs when Pakistan required 10.Earlier, Sri Lanka posted 184/5, led by Kamil Mishra’s superb 76 off 48 and Kusal Mendis’ brisk 40. Pakistan’s chase was derailed early as Chameera ripped through the top order, leaving them reeling at 43/4. Captain Salman Ali Agha kept Pakistan alive with a career-best 63 off 44, assisted by handy contributions from Usman Khan (33) and Mohammad Nawaz (27), but the early collapse proved decisive.",Babar Azam dismissed for a two-ball duck during Pakistan’s tense chase against Sri Lanka in the sixth match of the ongoing T20I tri-series.

IPL retentions, releases and trades: The burning questions before deadline

After recovering from injury, fast bowler Umran Malik is eager to return to the Indian cricket team . He relies on his natural ability to bowl at speeds exceeding 150 kmph, along with newly developed skills like slower deliveries and improved yorkers.Malik has been absent from the Indian team since July 2023 after taking 24 wickets in 10 ODIs and 8 T20Is. Despite the setbacks, he maintains a positive outlook.""Let me tell you one thing. Those who bowl 150 are not strike bowlers; they are attacking bowlers. They will be hit for 30 (runs) in four (overs) but will also give you wickets. A fast bowler is like that. He should know what he has to do,"" Umran told select media after J&K’s Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy match against Uttar Pradesh.""A bowler who bowls at 150 knows that he is a king and he has to back himself. Not everyone can bowl 150kph. It takes real guts to bowl at 150kph and I have been doing this for the last five years.""""Bowling 150kph is an art, you can't go directly from 137 to 145. Do training, do whatever you want -- this is natural, this is all natural. You need to train yourself accordingly, eat properly, rest properly, keep your body fresh so that you're ready for the process tomorrow.Speed is my natural aspect, how can I compromise on that? Training, running, cardio --you have to maintain. There is no special diet. Pace is my strength. I have to regain my strength.""Umran has faced multiple injuries and illness but never lost confidence in his abilities.""It is not that I will feel bad mentally. I know that I will do well now. I will come back to the India team. I have confidence in myself because I am the only one who bowls at 150. But now I am bowling slower (balls) as well, which I am working on, and also the yorker. I am doing that in red-ball formats too, I'm working hard there. The rest is up to the selectors when they let me play. I am doing better now. Playing again for India is my aim now,"" he continued.Despite strong competition in India's white-ball bowling unit, Umran remains confident. ""When I was playing earlier, there was this much competition. Now also the competition is the same. I don't think there is any competition. When I am fully fit and take wickets like this, why won't they let me play? They will let me play if I take wickets. That's it,"" he added.The 26-year-old pacer has set a straightforward goal of becoming J&K's highest wicket-taker in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy.""I have a simple target: to play all matches (for his home state) and become the highest wicket-taker for my team in Syed Mushtaq Ali,"" he stated.Umran has already claimed five wickets in two matches, including a 3/37 against UP where he dismissed key players with his pace.""Anyone can get injured. Any batsman, bowler, fielder, anyone can get injured. You just have to know how to get out of it,"" he added.""I never think about my career. I think about what I have to do the next day, what training I have to do — bowling, batting, fielding. It's all in God's hands who has a career and who doesn't.""If your mindset is stable, I think you will perform better after the injury. It feels good now that the ball is coming nicely out of my hand. When a bowler has full rhythm after an injury, I think it is best for him. I think injury also teaches you a lot of things... your mindset, your body, what to do. If we play cricket for 10 years, there will be injuries. You have to keep your mindset strong. You have to keep those people with you who are positive. You have to stay away from negative people during an injury.""He dismisses concerns about losing pace with age, adding, ""You can never bowl at 150 directly. You can bowl 138, 140, 142. It starts like that. I think that as long as I play, I should be positive. I don't want to show pace to anyone. I want to show my wickets. Even if I bowl from 150 to 140 after 10 years, it doesn't mean that I will bowl from 150 to 135 or 130.""Regarding his red-ball cricket aspirations, Umran remains open to all formats: ""There is nothing different. Yes, I am ready to play in all formats.""",Malik has been absent from the Indian team since July 2023 after taking 24 wickets in 10 ODIs and 8 T20Is.

Abhishek Reddy (Pic credit: Special Arrangement)

NEW DELHI: Bedridden for years, forced to undergo two major surgeries, and even warned by doctors that continuing cricket could leave him paralysed — most cricketers might have walked away and chosen another path. But Abhishek Reddy remained determined to chase his cricketing dreams. Even while lying on a hospital bed, he kept drawing strength from a poster of the great Sachin Tendulkar that read: “Chase your dreams, they do come true.”Until recently, hardly anyone knew his story. That changed when the Andhra Pradesh opener smashed a double century (247) in the Ranji Trophy against Jharkhand, powering his team to an innings victory in Jamshedpur and announcing his arrival in style.Reddy began his domestic career with Karnataka in 2015, marking his first-class debut with a composed half-century. But soon after, injuries struck — not once, but twice — threatening to end his career before it truly began.Now, after years of pain and patience, he is back on his feet — standing tall at the crease once again, stroking his trademark cover drives, and reclaiming the cricketing dream he refused to give up on.""I was just 20 when I made my debut. The flamboyance was there. I was young and there was a lot more fire in me. But the two surgeries broke me badly. I am really happy to be back where I always wanted to be,"" Reddy toldin an exclusive interview.""I remember getting selected for Karnataka in 2015 and then playing for them and scoring runs. It was a star-studded team with Robin Uthappa, Mayank Agarwal, Manish Pandey, Karun Nair, Vinay Kumar and many more senior players. It was difficult to make a place of my own, but I managed to do that with my batting. But everything changed in just one year when I underwent surgery in 2016,"" he said.""The injury happened in 2016. The outfield was wet and soggy, and while fielding, my leg got stuck and I suffered a knee tear and a muscle tear. The second time it happened was in 2023 when I was taking a second run, and again my same foot got stuck in the same spot. I had to undergo surgery again. ACL injuries take months to heal and recover. Those were the years when thoughts of giving up cricket crossed my mind, but I didn't let those thoughts dominate my dreams,"" Reddy said.""Abhimanyu Mithun — my teammate and my friend — was one of the people who helped me during that tough period. I spoke to him a lot while I was injured. He helped me with the mental side of the game,"" he said.Reddy was part of the Karnataka Ranji Trophy squad that lifted the title in the 2014–15 season. He represented Karnataka for a few years before eventually moving to Andhra Pradesh, his hometown.Even after his first surgery, the hunger to play and excel never faded. He continued dominating domestic tournaments and earned a place at the National Cricket Academy (NCA) in the U-23 setup based on his performances in the C.K. Nayudu Trophy (U-23) — one of India’s most prestigious domestic tournaments for emerging players — during the 2014–15 season. In that tournament, he scored four consecutive centuries: 174 against Tamil Nadu, 116 against Delhi, 115 against Mumbai and 103 against Rajasthan — a streak that firmly established his reputation as a prolific young batter.He has featured in 25 first-class matches so far, scoring 1,511 runs. And at 31, he firmly believes there is still plenty of fire left in him to keep chasing — and living — his cricketing dreams. As he puts it, 'Abhishek Reddy isn’t done yet.'""My mom is from Andhra, and I played all my junior cricket in Karnataka. My father belongs to Karnatakal. Karnataka gave me the foundation, the platform, and the identity I have today. It was my parents’ dream to see me become a cricketer, and I worshipped this game — and I still do. Andhra cricket supported me a lot. They supported me in my tough times. I will always be grateful to them. They trusted my abilities,"" he said.""When I made my debut, I was around 20. Things would have been very different today if the injuries hadn’t happened. I am 31 now, and I am happy with where I am. I am still the same flamboyant Abhishek Reddy. I am not done yet,"" he added.",Abhishek Reddy made his first-class debut for Karnataka in 2015. He was part of the Karnataka Ranji Trophy squad that lifted the title in the 2014–15 season.

'Million feelings, zero words': Chahal breaks silence after Dhanashree’s slams him

Indian cricketer Yuzvendra Chahal has surprised his followers with an unexpected Instagram post suggesting he's ready for marriage again, just months after his divorce from choreographer Dhanashree Verma. His caption stated he's looking for the right partner to tie the knot.The post quickly gained attention on social media platforms.Chahal wrote in Hindi, ""Shaadi k lie ready hoon bas ladki chaiye,"" which translates to being ready for marriage and just needing a bride. Chahal's recent Instagram post about being ready for marriage has received mixed reactions from fans. Some expressed shock, while others showed support for his decision to move forward.Chahal and Dhanashree's divorce was finalised in March 2025 at the Mumbai Family Court, ending their four-year marriage. Their separation had been speculated since mid-2022 when reports emerged about them living separately.The couple, who were once very active on social media together, had faced intense public scrutiny throughout their relationship. Their separation generated significant online discussion and speculation.""After my divorce, I was called a cheater. But I have never cheated in my life. I'm extremely loyal—probably more than most. For my loved ones, I've always thought from the heart,"" Chahal said on a podcast.""I had suicidal thoughts. I was tired of my life. I would cry for two hours a day, sleep just two hours. This went on for over 40 days. I had anxiety attacks, depression. Only those close to me knew what I was going through.""The divorce period was particularly challenging for Chahal, who openly shared his emotional struggles. He faced various allegations and rumours during this time.""Just because you are seen with someone, people link you up. I have two sisters. I know how to respect women,"" he further added.""I didn't want drama, but something happened from the other side. So, I gave my message through the T-shirt. I didn't abuse anyone.""","Indian cricketer Yuzvendra Chahal has surprised his followers with an unexpected Instagram post suggesting he's ready for marriage again.

India vs Pakistan again at an ICC event; T20 World Cup schedule is out!

NEW DELHI: Yash Dhull smashed a brilliant half-century to power Delhi to a thrilling last-ball, six-wicket win over Tamil Nadu in their Group D clash of the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy on Friday. After Tamil Nadu posted a competitive 198 for seven in 20 overs, Delhi required a strong team effort with the bat to chase down the target.Dhull (71 off 46 balls, 4 fours, 4 sixes) anchored the innings with an aggressive knock, guiding Delhi to 203 for four in their full quota of overs.The 23-year-old stitched together three key partnerships — 52 runs for the first wicket with Priyansh Arya (35 off 15), 58 for the second wicket alongside captain Nitish Rana (34 off 26), and a crucial 61-run stand for the third wicket with Ayush Badoni (41 off 23), which kept Delhi in control.However, Dhull eventually fell to left-arm seamer T Natarajan, and shortly after, Badoni was dismissed by Sonu Yadav, caught by Shahrukh Khan.With 12 needed off the final over and two required off the last ball, Himmat Singh sealed the game in dramatic fashion by launching a six to secure victory.Earlier, India batter B Sai Sudharsan — who joined the Tamil Nadu squad after featuring in the Test series against South Africa — couldn't make an impact and was dismissed for 13 off 10 balls by Ishant Sharma.Tamil Nadu were carried by openers Tushar Raheja (72 off 41) and Amit Sathvik (54 off 40), who put together a strong 115-run stand in 12 overs to set the tone for a big total, before Delhi pacer Prince Yadav pegged them back with three wickets in the middle overs.","Delhi beat Tamil Nadu by six wickets in Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy.

Nine-year-old Urban Negi, a footballer of Indian origin, has signed with Everton Academy in England, offering a ray of hope for Indian football which is currently experiencing a decline in FIFA rankings and domestic turmoil. The young prodigy from South London, who previously played for Dynamo Youth FC, has made the significant move to Finch Farm Academy in Liverpool in 2025.The Premier League India's X and Instagram brought attention to Urban's signing by sharing photos of him with an Everton jersey and an Indian flag at Everton's new Hill Dickinson Stadium. The images were taken during his first visit to the stadium after signing with the club in summer.Urban's remarkable skills and quick footwork have been evident in clips shared on social media, showcasing his talent at this young age. He has already scored goals for Everton's developmental teams, including finding the net in a Merseyside Derby against Liverpool.The young player joins Everton, a club known for its successful academy graduates, including Wayne Rooney. Urban is said to admire Everton's number 10 Iliman Ndiaye, who has emerged as one of the Premier League's top creative players since joining the club last year.His parents shared details about his transition on social media, stating: ""Urbs leaving behind his friends, school, and everything familiar to start fresh in a new city was incredibly tough. And at just 9 years old, it takes immense courage and resilience. Urbs has navigated these changes with such bravery. He's had to say goodbye to his London mates and step into a completely new environment, making new friends and finding his feet all over again. He made it look easy!""Social media clips have captured Urban's impressive skills, including his competitive spirit when he celebrated a goal against Liverpool by gesturing to silence an opposition player.While Urban isn't the only British player of Indian origin in Premier League club academies, his emergence comes at a challenging time for Indian football.

Poll What do you think is the most important aspect of Pelé's legacy? His records and achievements His cultural symbol for Brazil His influence off the pitch

The legacy of Brazilian football icon Pelé has taken a significant step toward renewed global visibility following the acquisition of his brand by NR Sports, the company owned by Neymar Santos Sr. The announcement was made on Tuesday at the Pelé Museum in Santos, the coastal city where the legendary forward built much of his career and global reputation.Neymar Sr. described the agreement as a milestone for both his company and Brazilian sport, emphasizing the cultural power attached to Pelé’s image.“It’s a very strong brand. We want to enhance its identity and bring it into the present,” he said. While the financial terms remain confidential under agreements with former rights-holder Sport 10, Brazilian media reports estimated the value around $18 million.Pelé—born Edson Arantes do Nascimento—remains one of football’s most celebrated figures in the sport, renowned for leading Brazil to World Cup triumphs in 1958, 1962, and 1970. He holds several records to date, with some of the most notable being the youngest to score in a FIFA World Cup final, and also the youngest to score a hat-trick in the competition.His influence extends far beyond the pitch, symbolising Brazilian creativity and excellence in global sport.Though he died in December 2022, his daughter Flavia attended the ceremony marking the transition.“There are no words to describe the emotion of bringing back a brand that embodies soul, humanity, and love,” she said, calling the moment both honouring and deeply personal.NR Sports characterised the acquisition as a “repatriation” of one of sport’s most important symbols, framing it as essential to preserving and expanding Pelé’s legacy for future generations.",Neymar Jr's family business has purchased Pele's brand rights.

Cristiano Ronaldo and Georgina Rodríguez have set the stage for what is expected to be one of the most high-profile weddings in recent years, with the couple reportedly choosing a venue that carries deep personal meaning for the Portugal captain. Instead of the grand international locations often associated with celebrity weddings, Ronaldo has opted to return to his roots in Madeira, selecting a site that reflects both history and identity.Portuguese outlets report that the ceremony is planned at Funchal Cathedral, widely recognised as the island’s oldest and most significant religious building. The structure, inaugurated in 1514 and built with local cedar wood, stands as a landmark of Madeira’s cultural heritage. It also sits just a short distance from the hospital where Ronaldo was born, adding a layer of symbolism to the decision.The connection between Ronaldo and his birthplace has remained evident throughout his career. Madeira’s international airport carries his name, and his museum — dedicated to his achievements — is located on the island. His early football steps with Nacional da Madeira unfolded not far from the cathedral selected for the ceremony.As per outlets in the country, the gathering is likely to be intimate in nature, though it will bring together guests linked to Ronaldo’s life in Portugal, Spain, Italy, Saudi Arabia and across the football world. Further details remain unconfirmed.It is also stated in a Jornal da Madeira report that Ronaldo and his fiancée will tie the knot in a Christian ceremony in the summer of 2026.Ronaldo and Georgina Rodríguez began their relationship in 2016 after meeting in Madrid, where she worked at a Gucci store during his time at Real Madrid. Over nine years, the couple have navigated different countries and stages of his career. They share two daughters, Alana and Bella, while raising Cristiano Jr, Mateo and Eva María together.As Ronaldo prepares for a demanding period with club and country — including a busy summer of international fixtures — Georgina continues to build her presence as an entrepreneur and media figure.For Madeira, the wedding marks another moment tied to one of its biggest icons. For Ronaldo, it reflects a return to the island that shaped his earliest years, setting the backdrop for a personal milestone that extends beyond football.","Cristiano Ronaldo and Georgina Rodríguez have reportedly chosen the venue for their wedding.

With 1/10th The Population Of Noida, Curacao Qualifies For FIFA World Cup

Here are the confirmed pots:

Pot 1: Canada, Mexico, United States, Spain, Argentina, France, England, Brazil, Portugal, Netherlands, Belgium, Germany

Pot 2: Croatia, Morocco, Colombia, Uruguay, Switzerland, Japan, Senegal, Iran, South Korea, Ecuador, Austria, Australia

Pot 3: Norway, Panama, Egypt, Algeria, Scotland, Paraguay, Tunisia, Ivory Coast, Uzbekistan, Qatar, South Africa

Pot 4: Jordan, Cape Verde, Ghana, Curaçao, Haiti, New Zealand, European playoff winners A–D, Inter-confederation playoff winners 1–2

FIFA has unveiled the seeding pots and draw procedures for the 2026 World Cup — the first-ever 48-team edition — confirming a major structural change that will keep the world’s top four teams apart until the semi-finals. The announcement, made on Tuesday, sets the stage for a historic draw scheduled for December 5 in Washington DC.Under the new system, the four highest-ranked teams — Spain (No. 1), Argentina (No. 2), France (No. 3), and England (No. 4) — will be placed in two different halves of the knockout bracket, ensuring they cannot face each other before the last four if all win their groups. The move aims to maintain competitive balance and increase the chances of heavyweight clashes deep into the tournament.All four top-ranked teams have been placed in Pot 1, alongside co-hosts Canada, Mexico, and the United States, and other global giants including Brazil, Portugal, Netherlands, Belgium, and Germany, who narrowly held on to a seeded spot.FIFA confirmed that the draw will start with the 12 teams in Pot 1 before proceeding sequentially through Pots 2, 3, and 4.The expanded format means the tournament will feature 12 groups of four, with the top two from each group — plus the eight best third-placed teams — progressing to a new 32-team knockout stage.Six places remain unfilled, with 18 teams still battling in the March play-offs. Among them is four-time world champion Italy, currently in the playoffs and facing the possibility of landing in Pot 4 despite being ranked 12th in the world.The expanded draw also features several debutant nations. Uzbekistan headline Pot 3, while Jordan, Cape Verde, and Curaçao sit in Pot 4 along with potential playoff winners.With the biggest World Cup in history just over a year away, the December 5 draw promises the first real glimpse of football’s new global era.","FIFA has unveiled the seeding pots and draw procedures for the 2026 World Cup.

A night marked by wholesale rotations, defensive mistakes and a moment of teenage brilliance saw both Manchester City and Barcelona fall to damaging Champions League defeats on Tuesday. While 18-year-old Estevão lit up Stamford Bridge with a stunning solo effort, lapses at the back hurt both European heavyweights.Pep Guardiola’s 100th Champions League match in charge of City turned sour as Bayer Leverkusen punished a heavily changed side with a 2-0 win. Guardiola rested almost his entire starting XI from the weekend loss to Newcastle, including Erling Haaland, but the reshuffle backfired. Alejandro Grimaldo put Leverkusen ahead in the 23rd minute with a precise low finish, before Patrik Schick doubled the lead with a well-placed header in the 54th.“It feels wonderful and we gave everything till the last second,” Schick told DAZN.Barcelona’s night was even more chaotic. Chelsea cruised to a 3-0 victory at Stamford Bridge, helped by Jules Koundé steering the ball into his own net after a defensive mix-up in the 27th minute. Things worsened when Ronald Araújo collected a second yellow just before half-time for a reckless challenge on Marc Cucurella.Chelsea took full advantage. Estevão shrugged off two defenders to score a superb solo goal in the 55th, and Liam Delap added a third from close range in the 73rd.Barcelona have now lost four of their last 10 matches across competitions, leaving coach Hansi Flick under mounting scrutiny.The results left the top end of the table unchanged. A City win would have pushed them higher, but Wednesday’s fixtures featuring Bayern Munich, Arsenal and Inter Milan will now shape the standings. Borussia Dortmund climbed to fourth, Chelsea moved into fifth, and both clubs sit level with City on 10 points. Barcelona slid to 15th, while Juventus rose to 21 points as their revival continued.There was better news for José Mourinho, who finally secured his first Champions League victory with Benfica. Samuel Dahl smashed in a sixth-minute volley and Leandro Barreiro sealed a 2-0 win at Ajax, who remain winless after five games and have managed just one victory in their last 10 overall.Elsewhere, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang struck twice in four minutes to lead Marseille to a 2-1 comeback win over Newcastle. Dortmund snapped a three-game winless stretch with a commanding 4-0 victory over 10-man Villarreal, powered by a brace from Serhou Guirassy.Juventus edged Bodo/Glimt 3-2 in the Arctic Circle, needing a stoppage-time finish from Jonathan David after the hosts equalised late. Substitute Kenan Yildiz was involved in all three goals.Union Saint-Gilloise edged Galatasaray 1-0 through Promise David, with the Turkish side missing injured top scorer Victor Osimhen and ending the match with 10 men after youngster Arda Ünyay was dismissed.Scott McTominay continued his scoring run by netting the opener in Napoli’s 2-0 win over Qarabag. Qarabag’s Kevin Medina was briefly knocked unconscious after being struck by another McTominay effort but was later replaced. Napoli supporters also marked the fifth anniversary of Diego Maradona’s passing.Finally, Athletic Bilbao’s goalless draw with Slavia Prague kept both teams outside the qualification spots with five matches played.","Pep Guardiola's 100th Champions League match in charge of City turned sour as Bayer Leverkusen punished a heavily changed side with a 2-0 win.

CHENNAI: Indian football is at an all-time low. The top-tier leagues are yet to kick off for the season, and the players have no option but to plead to the national federation, at a time when they must be putting on a show on the pitch.In a period when much ink has been spilt on the country’s football ecosystem, Republic of Ireland head coach Heimir Hallgrimsson stressed that a structure must be built to reap rewards in the future. Hallgrimsson, who recently guided Ireland to the World Cup playoffs, has a fair idea of Indian football, considering his association with Sports For Life (SFL), a platform for grassroots sports development.“Football is not a new sport in India, but there is not much experience that one can tap into. Obviously, a football culture is not there. So, people in charge may not have been in the game or played the game at an elite level. We, as coaches, can only teach what we know. That is a weakness which needs to be assessed,” Hallgrimsson, the global ambassador and football mentor for the SFL, told TOI during a virtual interaction.While there is a feeling of doom and gloom in Indian football, Hallgrimsson remarked that it is not impossible for the country to create a superstar if a structure is put in place.“In India, football is growing really fast, like everywhere else in the world. If it (work) is done properly, the next big one can come from India. If there is a good structure, it is kind of unlikely that there will be no big football players from India. I do not know when, but it will happen at some point of time. If we start early, we may have a big name in the game in 10 to 12 years,” added Hallgrimsson, a former Iceland and Jamaica coach.Talking about his work at the SFL, Hallgrimsson said: “I like the project. I have a really broad spectrum of coaching; I have done a lot of seminars for coaches in Iceland. So, I am trying to help the SFL and ensure that they do not take the wrong step like many have done.”",Heimir Hallgrimsson says Indian football needs a structure to reap rewards in the future.

Lee Bowyer vs Kieron Dyer (Newcastle, 2005)

Ricardo Fuller vs Andy Griffin (Stoke City, 2008)

Everton midfielder Idrissa Gueye entered an unwanted chapter of Premier League history on Monday, becoming part of only the third incident in which a player has been sent off for an offence against his own teammate — with four players now shown red cards across these rare flashpoints. The bizarre moment unfolded during Everton’s 1–0 win over Manchester United at Old Trafford, overshadowing the result and sparking widespread debate across football circles.The flashpoint came in the 13th minute with the score at 0–0. Moments after Gueye lost possession inside his own box — leading to a Bruno Fernandes effort — the midfielder and defender Michael Keane got into a heated argument. As the two confronted each other face-to-face, Keane appeared to shove Gueye, prompting the Senegal international to retaliate with a left-handed slap to his teammate’s face.Referee Tony Harrington immediately issued a straight red card, a decision later confirmed by VAR, which deemed the action a “clear strike to the face.” Everton goalkeeper Jordan Pickford and teammate Iliman Ndiaye quickly stepped in to separate the players.Gueye’s dismissal puts him in rare company — only two other incidents in Premier League history have seen players sent off for striking their own teammate.In one of the Premier League’s most infamous meltdowns, Bowyer and Dyer fought each other during Newcastle’s 3–0 defeat to Aston Villa. Both players were sent off, with Dyer handed a three-match ban and Bowyer suspended for seven games.With Stoke leading West Ham 1–0, Fuller slapped captain Andy Griffin after blaming him for an equaliser. He was immediately dismissed, and the incident derailed Stoke’s momentum as West Ham went on to score a late winner.Gueye’s red card, though unprecedented in Everton’s modern history, now joins those notorious moments.",Everton midfielder Idrissa Gueye was sent off against Manchester United.

Instead, Dallas turned the game into a brutal wake-up call for Kansas City, showcasing a team that’s undisciplined and riddled with injuries, fighting to keep its identity intact. Dak Prescott shredded the Chiefs’ secondary for 320 yards, frequently connecting with CeeDee Lamb, while Malik Davis landed the final blow with a jaw-dropping 43-yard touchdown on fourth down.The penalties made everything worse — 10 of them for 119 yards — each one coming at the worst possible time and keeping Dallas drives alive that should’ve been dead. Even Patrick Mahomes, who threw four touchdowns and almost brought the game back at the end, couldn’t overcome an offensive line that collapsed without Josh Simmons and Jawaan Taylor. Jadeveon Clowney had a field day, Dallas converted nine third downs, and the Chiefs looked more chaotic than competitive once again. Andy Reid’s postgame message was pretty much the same: they can’t win games when they keep giving them away. Dallas didn’t just exploit Kansas City’s issues; they amplified them, leaving the Chiefs with a 6-6 record and the realization that they have no room for error now.Right from the kickoff, Dallas systematically broke down Kansas City's illusion of being dominant.The Cowboys' offense, spearheaded by Dak Prescott's impressive 27-of-39 for 320 yards and two touchdowns, tore through the Chiefs' secondary with significant catches from CeeDee Lamb (seven catches, 112 yards, one TD) and others.Prescott's drive that clinched the game in the fourth quarter wrapped things up, but it was really Dallas' defense—highlighted by Jadeveon Clowney's two sacks—that forced Mahomes into a total of three sacks, keeping the Chiefs to just 119 rushing yards even with Kareem Hunt's 58 yards on 14 attempts.Kansas City's defense, which had shown some strength earlier this season, let Dallas convert 9 out of 16 third downs (56.3%) and 1 out of 1 on fourth down, which included a 43-yard touchdown run by Malik Davis. Penalties just made every mistake worse— the Chiefs got flagged 10 times for 119 yards, with five of those being pass interference calls that gave Dallas important first downs in the final minutes.This wasn't just a one-time thing; throughout the season, Kansas City has accumulated 52 penalties for 438 yards in losses, while they only had 37 for 335 in wins, according to Associated Press reports.Andy Reid, speaking to reporters after the game, acknowledged the self-sabotage, “The guys understand we’ve got to clean up a few things. We’re going do better as coaches. We’ve got to do better as players. And so, you go back to the drawing board, and you keep working, is what you do. We were close here. But we had too many opportunities that we gave away, and with two good teams playing each other, you can’t have those things. ”On the Cowboys' side, Prescott reflected on the grit required, “On top of where we put ourselves right before these games and just the place that we’re in, having to get these wins against two elite teams... two teams that played in the Super Bowl last year... we just beat them both in two great games. On top of everything that we've been through.”The Chiefs aren't facing a talent problem; they're facing a reality check, and Dallas made that crystal clear. The penalties, coverage breakdowns, and shaky protection have been simmering for weeks, and now the team can't escape it any longer. Kansas City still has Patrick Mahomes performing at an elite level and the coaching staff and playmakers to go far this season.They can't afford to just sit back and hope things get better anymore. If they don't tackle these issues with some real urgency, they'll keep looking like a team just wishing for momentum rather than actually creating it. Dallas didn't just play better; the Cowboys proved to the Chiefs that a good reputation won't get you through December, and that only discipline can keep their playoff dreams alive.Also Read: Quinshon Judkins injury update: Cleveland Browns’ star slams his head forcing an exit",Dallas Cowboys beat Kansas City Chiefs 38-31.

This means the 41-year-old quarterback is fully cleared and will be available when the Steelers take the field.Aaron Rodgers hurt his wrist during the Steelers’ 34–12 win over the Cincinnati Bengals on November 16. He left that game at halftime and did not play in the team’s 31–28 loss to the Chicago Bears on November 24, which led to Mason Rudolph starting in his place. The Steelers now hold a 6–5 record, and Sunday’s game offers them a chance to build momentum in a tight AFC North race.Mike Tomlin told reporters on Friday that Aaron Rodgers practiced normally all week and is “good to go.” This update comes at an important point in the season.The Cincinnati Bengals defeated the Baltimore Ravens 32–14 on Thursday night, bringing Baltimore back to .500 and tightening the AFC North standings even more.With the division so close, the Steelers now have a real chance to climb if they defeat the Buffalo Bills on Sunday.The team spent the past week preparing both Mason Rudolph and Aaron Rodgers, but now Rodgers will lead the offense again.Mason Rudolph played well in the loss to Chicago, completing 24 of 31 passes for 171 yards, one touchdown, and one interception. Before his injury, Aaron Rodgers completed nine of 15 passes for 116 yards and one touchdown in the win against Cincinnati.Despite the setback, Aaron Rodgers has played solid football this season. Across ten games, he has thrown 19 touchdowns and seven interceptions.His return gives the Steelers a major boost as they fight to stay in the playoff picture.

Brittany Mahomes reacts without Taylor Swift as Kansas City Chiefs face rising pressure

Brittany Mahomes felt alone during the Kansas City Chiefs game against the Dallas Cowboys on Thursday, November 28, at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas. Early in the first quarter, the Chiefs scored quickly after Dak Prescott threw an interception that set up a short drive. Patrick Mahomes found Travis Kelce for the opening touchdown, and cameras moved straight to Brittany Mahomes. She smiled and clapped, but she had no one standing beside her for the usual hug she shares with Taylor Swift The small moment stood out because Taylor Swift has become her closest partner during games. But Taylor Swift did not attend this matchup. Reports earlier in the week said she avoids road games where she has less control over security and large crowds. Her absence meant Brittany Mahomes spent most of her celebrations with her two young kids, who sat next to her inside the family suite.Brittany Mahomes continued rooting for every play within the AT&T Stadium suite, yet her celebrations seemed softer than normal.Expectedly missing, Taylor Swift did not show up in stadiums that had hoped for one last-minute attendance.Many think Taylor Swift will more often attend home games at Arrowhead Stadium, therefore she could come back on Sunday, December 7, when the Kansas City Chiefs welcome the Houston Texans on Sunday Night Football.Brittany Mahomes battled a solitary moment; still, the Kansas City Chiefs struggled on the field. With highs and lows, their Thanksgiving Day defeat to the Dallas Cowboys lowered them to a 6–6 mark.The attack has been disturbed by rookie wide receiver Xavier Worthy's injuries and the suspension of Rashee Rice, therefore Patrick Mahomes has to alter every week.The pressure on the group has broken now. Every game from here on seems like a must-win event. Although the climb this year is more difficult, the Chiefs are accustomed to playing deep into the postseason.Key errors have been permitted by the defense, and the attack has battled to locate a rhythm without all of its playmakers.To maintain playoff hopes alive, Patrick Mahomes and the team must promptly resolve their problems as December approaches.Their next primetime game against the Houston Texans is one of their most significant matchups of the season.Though Brittany Mahomes might have missed Taylor Swift in Dallas, the Chiefs cannot afford to pass another opportunity on the field.Also Read: Is Drake London Playing In Week 13 Vs The Jets?

From sleeping at the stadium to stealing the show: Post Malone returns to his Cowboys roots

Imagine being a kid sleeping on a cot in a stadium while your parents worked long shifts and years later, you’re headlining the halftime show for thousands in the exact same arena. That’s exactly what happened to Post Malone , whose childhood memories at AT&T Stadium have now come full circle. From watching games and helping out behind the scenes to performing for fans on Thanksgiving, Posty’s journey is the ultimate “dreams do come true” story.Post Malone, born Austin Richard Post, isn’t just a huge music star, he’s also a Cowboys kid through and through. His dad, Rich Post, worked in concessions for the Dallas Cowboys for over a decade, eventually becoming Assistant Director of Food & Beverage. This meant young Austin spent countless nights at AT&T Stadium, sometimes even sleeping there while his parents worked late.Jerry Jones, the Cowboys owner, recalled that Post Malone would have a cot set up in the old stadium, making it his little home away from home. Those early experiences surrounded by football, fans, and stadium lights clearly shaped his love for performance and showmanship and maybe even his work ethic.Fast forward to Thanksgiving 2025: Post Malone is back in that very arena, performing the halftime show in front of thousands of fans and millions watching on TV.The same stadium where he once wandered the concourse as a kid is now his stage. For many fans, the story isn’t just about music, it’s about nostalgia, family, and seeing a local kid make it big.Malone’s set blended his signature hits with high-energy production, but behind the music, there’s an emotional layer. Every cheer, every camera flash, is tied to the memories of the place that first inspired him. It’s a full-circle moment that few performers get to experience.Post’s connection to the Cowboys isn’t just personal, it’s cultural. Fans love seeing hometown heroes come home, especially when those heroes share a piece of their personal story that feels genuine and relatable.This Thanksgiving, the halftime show wasn’t just another performance, it was a milestone, a return, and a celebration of the kid who once slept in a stadium dreaming big.Also read - Taylor Swift reportedly saw Ryan Reynolds go off on Justin Baldoni for fat-shaming Blake Lively","Post Malone, born Austin Richard Post, isn’t just a huge music star, he’s also a Cowboys kid through and through.

Blake Lively Files New Motion Over ‘Inappropriate’ Video as Justin Baldoni Prepares for Trial

Hollywood drama alert! Court documents recently unsealed and gave fans a behind-the-scenes glimpse at an allegedly tense confrontation between Ryan Reynolds and Justin Baldoni. Apparently, things got super tense between Ryan Reynolds and Justin Baldoni, and the kicker? Taylor Swift and Hugh Jackman were allegedly there to watch it all go down. The drama?

While neither Swift nor Jackman has publicly commented on the incident, their alleged presence has sparked a lot of fan speculation. Naturally, the idea of two megastars witnessing such a Hollywood showdown has only fueled curiosity and social media chatter.This confrontation is part of a broader lawsuit filed by Blake Lively in December 2024, accusing Baldoni and others of sexual harassment, retaliation, and body-shaming on set.Baldoni has denied the allegations, and the trial is reportedly scheduled for March 2026.The unsealed documents give fans a glimpse into the alleged behind-the-scenes tensions on the set and in Hollywood social circles, but it’s important to note: these are allegations from legal filings, not confirmed public statements from any of the stars involved.The story has ignited social media, with fans and outlets dissecting the alleged confrontation.

Why Trey Benson did not play in Week 13? Full injury report and recovery timeline for the Cardinals RB,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/why-trey-benson-did-not-play-in-week-13-full-injury-report-and-recovery-timeline-for-the-cardinals-rb/articleshow/125646009.cms,"Image - X

Why Trey Benson did not play in Week 13 and what we know about his knee issue

out

Here’s the simplest breakdown:

Fastest return (Week 14): Benson would need to practice fully and consistently. This is possible but not guaranteed.







Most realistic return (Week 15 or Week 16): Gives his knee more time to settle and allows the team to increase his workload slowly.







Latest return (end of season): Only happens if the swelling or discomfort lingers longer than expected.





If you’re a Cardinals fan, Week 13 probably left you scratching your head. Trey Benson finally opened his 21-day return window, he was back at practice sort of and people were actually excited to see him suit up again. Then suddenly, he wasn’t playing. No snaps, no activation, no late surprise. Just silence and panic on the timeline. So now the big question everyone’s asking is simple: did Trey Benson suffer a setback, or was this just the Cardinals being extra cautious with their rookie running back?Let’s start with the facts. Benson is coming off arthroscopic meniscus surgery, so the Cardinals were already walking a tightrope with his recovery. Even though he returned to “limited” practice early in the week, he didn’t practice again after that. And once a player stops practicing right before a game? That’s usually a big red flag.By Friday, Arizona officially ruled himfor Week 13. The injury report still listed the same knee, but there was no confirmation of a new injury, just a clear sign that the knee wasn’t ready for game-speed work. Instead of risking long-term damage, the Cardinals shut it down and rolled with their remaining backs.So yes, it felt like a setback but medically, it’s more of a “not yet” than a disaster.Arizona still has Benson in his 21-day practice window, which means they can activate him anytime if he shows improvement. His timeline depends on one thing: how the knee responds when he ramps up again.Nothing right now suggests the Cardinals are shutting him down for the season. They’re clearly being cautious, and Benson is too valuable to rush back.For the Cardinals, this is a patience game. They’re still juggling their running back depth, and Benson was expected to bring fresh legs and explosive speed. Without him, Arizona leans heavier on the rotation safe, but less dynamic.For fantasy players? The message is: hold, don’t panic. Benson isn’t dealing with a confirmed reinjury, but the Cardinals aren’t likely to give him a heavy workload immediately after he returns. If he’s activated in Week 14 or 15, expect a slow build rather than instant RB2 magic.Also read - Did Stefon Diggs accidentally reveal a secret marriage to Cardi B in his viral video calling her “wife” in Spanish?","Trey Benson is coming off arthroscopic meniscus surgery.

LeBron James Injury Report vs Dallas Mavericks (November 28, 2025)

Mavericks Enter Shorthanded but Sparked by AD’s Comeback

The Los Angeles Lakers and Dallas Mavericks collide tonight in a high-stakes NBA Cup matchup on November 28, 2025, and the stage couldn’t be set more dramatically. With playoff-like pressure, returning stars, and a long list of injury twists from both sides, this duel at Crypto.com Arena promises intensity from the opening tip. The Lakers are chasing their sixth straight win, while the Mavericks are desperate to break out of a slump that has left them sitting at 5-14. Add in a former franchise cornerstone returning to Los Angeles and a legendary 40-year-old suiting up once again, and this matchup becomes must-see basketball.What elevates the intrigue even more is the sudden shift in injury fortunes for both teams. While Dallas arrives severely depleted, the Lakers not only have LeBron James fully cleared but also welcome back reinforcements. And with neither team playing on the controversial NBA Cup court after multiple slipping incidents, tonight will unfold on the Lakers’ regular hardwood - eliminating any concerns about traction or safety.LeBron James is expected to play after being removed from the Lakers’ injury report. The veteran star appears refreshed, especially after dropping 25 points earlier this week against the Clippers, pushing his season averages to 17.7 points, 5.0 rebounds, and 8.7 assists through three games.His availability keeps Los Angeles’ core intact as they eye a sixth consecutive victory.James suits up alongside Luka Dončić - who continues his MVP-level tear at 35.2 points per game - Austin Reaves, and Deandre Ayton. Ayton, coming off a knee contusion, has been upgraded to available and brings his efficient 15.5 points on a dominant 69.6% shooting back to the frontcourt. Marcus Smart, however, remains doubtful due to back spasms, marking the lone major concern for Los Angeles.The Mavericks face a far tougher battle on the health front. Anthony Davis is listed as questionable but is planning to make his return after missing 14 games with a calf strain. This marks his first meeting with the Lakers since the February blockbuster trade, and Dallas is banking on his comeback to energize a heavily depleted lineup.Also read: Is Luka Doncic playing tonight vs the Dallas Mavericks?

Since being traded to the Lakers in February in exchange for Anthony Davis and draft assets, the Slovenian phenom has revitalized L.A.’s offense. He’s averaging a league-best 35.2 points to go with 8.8 rebounds and 9.2 assists in 13 games, the driving force behind the Lakers’ 13-4 record and ongoing five-game winning streak.His most recent masterpiece - a 43-point, 13-assist explosion against the Clippers - further cemented his MVP candidacy. The revenge element only adds fuel tonight. Dallas, sitting at a rough 5-14, has not benefited from the trade the way they hoped, making Doncic’s visit to Crypto.com Arena feel like a storyline lifted from a scripted epic.The Los Angeles Lakers roll into this clash nearly fully healthy. Luka Doncic is good to go, joined by Austin Reaves, who’s having a breakout season at 27.9 points per game, LeBron James, who’s posted 17.7 points across three appearances, and Deandre Ayton, who recently cleared concerns over a knee contusion. The only notable concern is Marcus Smart, listed as doubtful with back spasms.Also read: Dallas Mavericks vs Los Angeles Lakers regular season game: Full injury report, who's out, and more (November 28, 2025) Dallas enters depleted, with Kyrie Irving sidelined by a knee injury, Dereck Lively II out with a foot issue, and Dante Exum ruled out for the season. With key veterans unavailable, rookies like Cooper Flagg - already averaging 15.9 points - are being thrown into massive defensive responsibilities, including the unenviable task of chasing Doncic around screens. Anthony Davis, who missed 14 games due to a calf strain, is expected to return, bringing his 20.8 points and 10.2 rebounds back into the fold. Still, the question lingers: can even a rejuvenated Davis slow down the Lakers’ machine?","The Los Angeles Lakers host the Dallas Mavericks on November 28, 2025.

San Antonio Spurs Injury Report vs the Denver Nuggets (November 28, 2025)

The Denver Nuggets enter their final NBA Cup group-stage matchup with everything on the line, and their biggest advantage is simple:. In a tournament finale carrying major implications for the Western Conference bracket, Denver leans on its star power, depth, and championship habits to stay alive in the chase for the Cup.With Ball Arena set for a high-pressure showdown, the conversation begins with Nikola Jokic, who continues to redefine what dominance looks like in modern basketball. Denver’s hopes of advancing rest heavily on his shoulders - but fortunately for the defending champions, the Serbian superstar is ready for full duty.Nikola Jokic is confirmed to play tonight against the San Antonio Spurs on November 28, 2025, as his name does not appear on the Nuggets’ official injury report. The three-time MVP enters the matchup averaging a league-best 29.6 points, 12.8 rebounds, and 11.1 assists across 17 games while spearheading Denver’s strong 13-4 start. His all-around brilliance remains the Nuggets’ most consistent lifeline, especially in must-win situations like this NBA Cup decider.Denver Nuggets, however, is far from full strength overall. The team continues dealing with a string of injuries that have forced them to lean heavily on Jokic and Jamal Murray.Aaron Gordon remains sidelined with a right hamstring strain and is expected to miss at least six weeks after suffering the injury against Houston. The Nuggets also remain without Christian Braun, who is out with a left ankle sprain, and Julian Strawther, who continues to sit due to lower back injury management. These absences mark Braun’s seventh and Strawther’s sixth consecutive missed game, thinning Denver’s rotation and increasing the pressure on the remaining starters.San Antonio faces similar challenges, arriving in Denver shorthanded and without their franchise cornerstone. Victor Wembanyama is unavailable due to a left calf strain, leaving the Spurs without their 7’4” phenom for this crucial NBA Cup group finale. They will also be missing Stephon Castle, ruled out with a left hip flexor issue, and Jordan McLaughlin, sidelined by a left hamstring injury.Without Wembanyama anchoring their defense and altering shots in the paint, the Spurs must rely more heavily on their backcourt and wing players. Guards - including De’Aaron Fox - are expected to take on a larger burden in producing offense and creating spacing, but Jokic looms as a mismatch nightmare capable of exploiting weaker interior coverage.","Nikola Jokic is confirmed to play tonight against the San Antonio Spurs on November 28, 2025, as his name does not appear on the Nuggets’ official injury report.

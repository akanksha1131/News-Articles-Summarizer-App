Poll Who do you believe had the toughest time managing fame among these legends? Sachin Tendulkar MS Dhoni Virat Kohli Shubman Gill

Former India head coach Ravi Shastri has shed light on the challenges faced by modern Indian cricketers off the field, saying that the country’s stars live under constant scrutiny and have little to no privacy in their personal lives.Speaking on the Willow Talk podcast on the LiSTNR Sport channel, Shastri reflected on how players like Sachin Tendulkar MS Dhoni , Virat Kohli and the current generation including Shubman Gill , live as “public property” because of their fame and fan following.“You’ve seen generations of this — Sachin, MS Dhoni, Virat Kohli, and the modern guys as well. I dare say that Shubman Gill is heading down this same path, where their cricket life is their cricket life — we see that. But their life outside of it is so constricted, because what can they do? Where can they get privacy? How do these guys live normal lives?” asked Adam Peacock to Shastri.According to the former coach, India’s players find it difficult to live freely at home due to constant public attention. “They don’t. They can’t — because they’re public property. That’s why you see them at their best at times overseas, because they can walk on the streets in Australia.Even there they’ll be hassled, but not to the extent of what they go through in India,” he added.Shastri recalled how even legends like Tendulkar and Dhoni had to find ways to escape the spotlight. “Sachin would drive his cars after midnight just to get out, because during the day, at every traffic light, he’d be stopped. And the same with MS — he’ll get on his bike and head out where he wants to go. But it’s not easy, especially in this day and age,” he said.The 63-year-old also highlighted how social media has intensified the lack of privacy for modern athletes. “The spotlight on players is much more than in our era because of all the social media. You get your phone straight out, start taking videos or photos — there’s no privacy. You’re public property, period,” he said.Shastri, who earlier hailed Kohli’s relentless work ethic and fitness standards, said such dedication and discipline were what helped the team evolve collectively. But off the field, he admitted, the burden of fame remains one of the biggest challenges of being an Indian cricketer today.",Former India head coach Ravi Shastri has shed light on the challenges faced by modern Indian cricketers off the field.

Poll Do you think Shams Mulani deserves a spot in the India 'A' team based on his recent performances? Definitely, he has proven himself. Yes, but he needs to continue performing. No, there are better options available. Undecided.

Shams Mulani has been one of the most consistent performers on the domestic circuit over the last four seasons and he has numbers to prove it: 170 wickets and 1,248 runs in Ranji Trophy . But when it comes to rewarding the left-arm spinner, he sits down the pecking order.Despite enjoying a fruitful 2024-25 season where he took 44 wickets—third best in the most wickets list — and scored 365 runs, he was overlooked for the multi-day games against Australia 'A' last month.No wonder then the Mumbai lad is disappointed but he would rather let his skills do the talking than go on cribbing about it. On Thursday, he showed what he is made of when he scored a patient 161-ball 91 to play a crucial role in Mumbai reaching 386 on Day Two of their Ranji match against Jammu & Kashmir.Since the 2021-22 Ranji season, Mulani has been consistent in both departments. That season he topped the wicket-taking chart besides scoring 321 runs. In 2022-23, he was the second highest wicket-taker with 46 scalps and 209 runs. The 28-year-old continued his good work in 2023-24 with 34 wickets and 353 runs.Mulani, though, doesn't want to get into the debate of why he has been ignored and is focused on this season even if it means starting from the scratch, deleting what he has done in the past.""In my mind, my job is to keep performing. In cricket you can get that chance any moment and I must be ready for that. I keep improving myself so that I'm ready when I step up. For last four-five months I have been working on upgrading my skills. After that whatever happens, happens but I shouldn't fall short on effort,"" Mulani said.Throughout his career Mulani has proved his doubters wrong. When he made his Mumbai debut in a T20 match in 2017-18 season, he was primarily considered as a white-ball specialist. He made his Ranji debut the next season but wasn't that impressive. But his fighting spirit and never give up attitude meant he went back to the drawing board to improve his red ball game, and the results were there to see. In 2019-20 he picked up 26 wickets and since then has emerged as Mumbai's premier spinner in red-ball cricket as well.In his career, he has seen it all—the ups and downs — so he doesn't get upset when he is not picked.""Throughout my career, I've come across people who felt I didn't have it in me to keep performing well. So, my mindset has always been to prove people wrong and that starts with me itself. When I had just made it to the Mumbai team, there was a perception that I'm a white-ball bowler. Then I changed my mindset, improved my red-ball skills, broke into the Mumbai Ranji team and did well,"" said Mulani of his mindset to cope with setbacks.Patience is key, he feels as a player's job is to perform and move on. ""When you deliver, at the back of your mind you always think of getting selected. But then you look at someone like Sarfaraz Khan, who got an opportunity after performing over a long period. So, I keep his example in front of me and keep telling myself to keep performing. the chance will come, when it has to come but for that I can't keep thinking that I have done so much and I should get an opportunity,"" explained Mulani.He added: ""In cricket there are no guarantees. Somehow, I didn't fit in the India 'A' side this time but there is always a next time. Whichever the competition...Ranji, Duleep...I need to keep showing that I’m performing and helping the team win.""In an era where even domestic teams depend on video analysis to unravel the secrets, it's not easy to stay on top over a longer period without evolving. Mulani says every bowler must keep adding new weapons to his repertoire to be a step ahead of the opponents.So how does he go about it? ""I sit down with my coaches and analyse where I performed better, how can it be improved further. What are my weak spots, how can it be improved? How can you tweak your plan midway through the game if a batter is playing you well? The idea is to think on your feet and outsmart them. If you have multiple options up your sleeves, it will help you in the long run. Using you head out there helps and I thrive on that,"" said Mulani.Mulani has once again got a good start to the season and will continue to knock on the door until that call comes.","Shams Mulani has been one of the most consistent performers on the domestic circuit over the last four seasons.

Tax fraud

England's assistant coach Paul Collingwood ’s disappearance, citing ""personal reasons,"" has created quite a stir ahead of the Ashes.Collingwood's last public media appearance came during England’s Third Test in Hamilton, New Zealand, last December.Paul Collingwood, England’s first-ever World Cup-winning cricket captain, is unlikely to be included in England's backroom team for the Ashes, the Daily Mail has reported.Within 56 days of being appointed temporary head coach for a series in the West Indies, images emerged of him kissing a woman in the sea on a Barbados beach. His England side had just lost by 10 wickets in the decisive third Test.A shadow of controversy has followed Collingwood since April 2023, after former teammate Graeme Swann revealed on the Rig Biz Podcast that an explicit audio recording involving the former England captain was circulating among cricketers. The leaked clip allegedly captured Collingwood in a two-hour-long sexual encounter with multiple women. While the details surrounding when and where it took place remain uncertain, Swann dismissed the recording as “pure Collingwood,” calling it proof of him being a “great tourist. ”Just over a day before leading England in their 2007 T20 World Cup clash against South Africa — a match where he was dismissed for a golden duck — Paul Collingwood was photographed at a Cape Town strip club named Mavericks.Collingwood, who had married his then-wife Vicky in the same city two years earlier, later explained, “I was taken to an inappropriate bar, and once I realised that, I left immediately.”He was fined £1,000 for the incident, but the matter was soon dropped.Adding to his troubles, Collingwood recently suffered a legal setback with HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC), which has ordered him to pay a £196,000 (around ₹2 crore) tax bill. The fine arises from a long-standing investigation into his use of a personal services company, “PDC Rights,” to channel earnings from sponsorship deals and reduce his tax liability.Although a previous case had been dropped in 2009, HMRC reopened the probe and determined that payments from brands such as Slazenger and Clydesdale Bank should be treated as self-employment income rather than corporate earnings. Collingwood recently lost his appeal and must now pay the full amount. Reports suggest he was addressing these tax matters in London when he missed England’s summer fixture against Zimbabwe.","England's assistant coach Paul Collingwood has disappeared for 'personal reasons' The Daily Mail has reported that he is unlikely to be included in England's backroom team for the Ashes.

Poll Should XL bully dogs be banned in all countries? Yes, for public safety. No, responsible ownership is key. Maybe, with stricter regulations.

Algeria international and Saudi Pro League winger Said Benrahma has been fined £12,000 (Rs 14 lakh) for owning dangerously out-of-control dogs that attacked a golden retriever in 2023 while he was playing for West Ham.Benrahma admitted to two counts of owning dangerously out-of-control dogs during a court hearing via video link from Saudi Arabia, where he currently plays for Neom.The incident took place in east London when his two XL bullies escaped from his home and attacked a golden retriever named Bailey, injuring the dog and a man.The retriever required veterinary treatment, while its owner sustained grazes to the arms and legs.Benrahma defended himself by saying the dogs escaped through a side gate left open by someone working for him at the time. The dogs now live in France.District Judge Matt Jabbitt imposed fines of £5,000 for each attack and ordered Benrahma to pay £2,500 compensation to Bailey’s owner, plus £495 in kennel costs.The judge noted that Benrahma “expressed remorse when interviewed” and also remarked that it was his first time “sentencing someone in the Middle East.”The case took place months before the British government introduced a ban on owning XL bully dogs in England and Wales following a series of fatal attacks.Under the current law, it is a criminal offense to own such dogs without a certificate of exemption.Despite Benrahma's defense, the magistrate emphasized the severity of the attacks, which left both an animal and a person injured.The winger’s case has drawn attention not only because of his footballing profile but also due to the growing public scrutiny around XL bully dogs and the potential dangers posed when such animals are left unsupervised.","Said Benrahma has been fined £12,000 (around USD 16,000) for owning dangerously out-of-control dogs that attacked a golden retriever in 2023 while he was playing for West Ham.

Italy secured a 3-0 victory against Israel in their 2026 World Cup qualifier in Udine on Tuesday, amid protests and clashes between pro-Palestinian demonstrators and police. Around 10,000 protesters marched through the city, with some engaging in disorder despite Monday's Gaza ceasefire deal and a hostage-prisoner exchange between Israel and Hamas.Over 1,000 police officers and army personnel were deployed, with helicopters and drones monitoring the demonstration. The protest was kept several kilometers away from the Bluenergy Stadium hosting the Group I fixture.""It's pointless hiding it, today was not easy, neither for us nor for you. There were many days in which we thought that there might be the possibility that we might not even play the match. We came here knowing it wouldn't be a party atmosphere and we felt that. I hope that in the future things will be a bit calmer. I think it will be, I don't know what other problems could come out,"" Italy coach Gennaro Gattuso told journalists after the match.Security checkpoints were established around the stadium, with spectators passing through concrete barriers and metal detectors to watch the crucial match in Italy's bid to qualify for their first World Cup since 2014.The initially peaceful march began at 1800 local time, featuring drumming and sound systems accompanying dancers of all ages waving Palestinian flags and banners reading ""show Israel the red card.""""There's no more bombs and that makes us happy, but the problem with this peace plan is that there is no talk of a Palestinian state. There's no talk of self-determination, no talk about the West Bank nor of the fate of Gaza... it seems like Gaza will be governed by Tony Blair and Donald Trump, without any involvement from the Palestinians. We shouldn't be playing this match because a team that represents a nation that has committed a genocide is playing,"" said Amer Hasan, a 61-year-old Palestinian representative from the West Bank.The march was organised by Palestinian communities in Veneto and Fruili-Venezia Giulia regions, along with four other associations, welcoming over 340 activist groups from across Italy.Protesters called for FIFA to exclude Israel from international competition, similar to Russia's exclusion following the Ukraine invasion in February 2022. They chanted slogans including ""Free Palestine"" and ""Genocidal Israel.""The death toll in the Gaza Strip has reached 67,869 Palestinians since Israel's military offensive began following Hamas's cross-border assault on October 7, 2023.Italian football federation's refusal to boycott matches with Israel has sparked anger, contrasting with Norway's Football Association's stance calling for sanctions against Israel.""The Norwegian FA has begun taking a position against the presence of Israeli teams, there's a totally different type of behavior across the board compared to what you see here,"" said Carlina, an activist from Udine Committee For Palestine.The match proceeded with a small crowd of 10,000, where Italian fans booed the Israeli national anthem before being overwhelmed by applause.Mateo Retegui scored twice for Italy, first from a penalty in first-half stoppage time and again with a curling finish in the 74th minute. Gianluca Mancini added a third goal late in the match.The victory secured at least second place and a play-off spot for Italy in their group. Norway leads Italy by three points with a superior goal difference and two matches remaining, with only the top spot offering automatic qualification for next summer's finals in the USA, Canada, and Mexico.The protest ended with police using water cannon and tear gas on some marchers who threw projectiles at officers.","Italy secured a 3-0 victory against Israel in their 2026 World Cup qualifier in Udine on Tuesday, amid protests and clashes.

Qatar, Saudi Arabia qualify for World Cup

South Africa, Ivory Coast and Senegal all won convincingly on Tuesday to fill the last three automatic places reserved for Africa at the 2026 World Cup.Senegal were the most impressive winners, hammering Mauritania 4-0, while Ivory Coast beat Kenya 3-0 and South Africa were also 3-0 winners, against Rwanda.The trio will join Algeria, Cape Verde , Egypt, Morocco, Senegal and Tunisia at the global showpiece in the United States, Canada and Mexico.Cameroon, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Gabon and Nigeria kept alive hopes of swelling the African representation to 10 nations by finishing as the four best-ranked runners-up.They will meet in two single-match semi-finals and a final in Morocco during November and the winners advance to inter-continental play-offs in March with two World Cup places up for grabs.Former Liverpool star Sadio Mane scored just before and after half-time for Group B table-toppers Senegal, with Iliman Ndiaye and Habib Diallo also netting for the Teranga Lions.Senegal finished with 24 points, two more than DR Congo, who edged Sudan 1-0 in Kinshasa through a Theo Bongonda goal.Manchester United winger Amad Diallo completed the scoring for the Ivory Coast, who led from the seventh minute in a convincing triumph over Kenya in Abidjan.Franck Kessie put the reigning African champions ahead and Yan Diomande added the second goal soon after half-time.Ivory Coast topped Group F with 26 points, one more than Gabon. Gambia overwhelmed the Seychelles 7-0 to come third.Thalente Mbatha and Oswin Appollis scored for South Africa in the first half and Evidence Makgopa sealed victory with a goal midway through the second period in Mbombela.South Africa topped Group C with 18 points, one more than Nigeria, who hammered third-placed Benin 4-0 in Uyo with Victor Osimhen claiming a hat-trick.It will be the fourth appearance by South Africa at the global showpiece. They qualified for the 1998 and 2002 tournaments and were automatic participants in 2010 as the host nation.Belgium-born South Africa coach Hugo Broos was thrilled as he represented his country as a player at the 1986 World Cup in Mexico and wanted to coach a team at the tournament before retiring.""We all knew that we could do it, we believed in ourselves. We are going to the World Cup and it is fantastic,"" said the 73-year-old.""In the last three years we changed players and every time it was the right choice. What happened tonight is the work of three years and the future looks very bright for South African football.""We have the Africa Cup of Nations in Morocco during December and then the World Cup. There are no words to express how I feel.""Winger Appollis was voted player of the match after scoring and creating the other goals as South Africa regained their scoring touch after failing to find the net in a draw with Zimbabwe last Friday.""What an amazing feeling for the group going to the World Cup. I am so happy for the boys,"" he told reporters.""I know we had a draw in our last game, but I knew that we would come here to Mbombela tonight and win.""Qualification was a huge relief for South Africa, who saw a five-point lead with four rounds remaining turn into a two-point deficit behind Benin entering the final round.South Africa dropped points in home draws with Nigeria and Zimbabwe and forfeited three points for fielding the ineligible Teboho Mokoena in a victory over Lesotho.South Africa needed to beat Rwanda and hope Nigeria defeated Benin, and that is what transpired with the home teams making dream starts.Nigeria were ahead within three minutes through Osimhen while Mbatha scored the first South African goal with just five minutes gone.A snap shot from Appollis midway through the opening half put South Africa in control and Rwanda spent most of the match on the back foot.Makgopa, a late call-up in place of the injured Iqraam Rayners, headed into the net off a corner on 72 minutes to complete the scoring.Osimhen netted a second time before half-time and completed his hat-trick six minutes into the second half. An added-time goal from Frank Onyeka completed the rout.Qatar and Saudi Arabia became the latest teams to book their spots at the 2026 World Cup, with each finishing top of their respective groups on Tuesday in the fourth round of Asian qualifying.In Group A, Qatar saw off the United Arab Emirates 2-1 in their must-win clash in Doha, where second-half goals from captain Boualem Khoukhi and Pedro Miguel sealed the 2022 hosts's place at next summer's finals in the United States, Canada and Mexico.Then, later in Jeddah, the Saudis came through a goalless draw at home to Iraq to book a berth at the 2026 showpiece.In qualifying on merit for a first World Cup, Qatar went some way to atoning for three years ago, when they entered the history books as the first hosts to lose all three group games.Against the UAE on Tuesday, the winners of the past two Asian Cups took the lead four minutes into the second half at the Jassim Bin Hamad Stadium where Khoukhi headed home Akram Afif's in-swinging free-kick.On 74 minutes, the hosts doubled their lead, this time Pedro Miguel making the most of a mistake by UAE goalkeeper Khalid Essa to nod into the empty net.Coached by former Spain, Real Madrid and West Ham boss Julen Lopetegui, Qatar had to survive Tarek Salman's sending-off late on for a studs-up tackle, while the UAE were provided a lifeline from substitute Sultan Adil's volley eight minutes into injury-time.To their credit, though, Qatar held on to take their place at a first World Cup on foreign soil.In Group B, Saudi Arabia made it through to a third successive finals by avoiding defeat to Iraq at their King Abdullah Sports City.The 2034 hosts, who recorded a stunning victory against eventual winners Argentina at the 2022 World Cup, needed only a draw to seal a berth at a seventh showpiece event.Herve Renard's side could have had taken the lead two minutes into the second half, but Lens full-back Saud Abdulhamid sent his effort over the Iraq crossbar with the goal at his mercy.Moments later, Al Ahli midfielder Saleh Abu Al Shamat forced a fine save from range from Jalal Hassan, while the Iraq goalkeeper soon thwarted both Saudi captain Salem Al Dawsari and namesake Nasser Al Dawsari.It took a save from goalkeeper Nawaf Al Aqidi deep into injury-time to ignite celebrations among the 60,000-plus crowd in Jeddah, but Saudi had done it.Iraq, last participants in 1986, remain in the hunt for the World Cup: next month, they contest a two-legged tie against the UAE, with the winner then going into an intercontinental playoff.","South Africa, Ivory Coast and Senegal all won convincingly on Tuesday to fill the last three automatic places reserved for Africa at the 2026 World Cup.

(Times of India)

India failed to qualify for the 2027 AFC Asian Cup after going down 1-2 to Singapore who rallied to humble the hosts with a brace from Korea-born attacking mid-fielder Song Ui-young in the third round qualification match here on Tuesday.Lallianzuala Chhangte's 14th minute strike was cancelled out by Song's equalizer in the 44th minute, and then he struck what proved to be the winner, in the 58th minute as India were left to rue many missed chances.The two teams were locked 1-1 at the half-time break at the Jawahar Lal Nehru Stadium, having played a 1-1 stalemate in the first leg in Singapore on October 9.In the day's other Group C match, Hong Kong and Bangladesh shared the spoils after a 1-1 draw in Hong Kong, a result that did not help India's cause who entered the game with two points from three matches.India were the dominant team in the first half and enjoyed long spells of possession, and it was appropriate that the Blue Tigers scored the opening goal in front of a lively home crowd.Chhangte received the ball some distance away from the edge of the box and unleashed a screamer with his left foot that beat the Singapore goalkeeper on its way to the back of the net.However, Song had other ideas as he struck twice in ether side of the break to dash Indian hopes.Just before the interval, Singapore struck back against the run of play courtesy Song, who found space inside the Indian box and kept his composure to level the score at 1-1, the equaliser leaving the Indian players distraught for they were the ones dictating play for most parts of the first half.On resumption, the visitors looked much sharper and more confident thanks to that equaliser, and they were rewarded when Song capitalised on India's defensive lapse to slot the ball home from close range and put his side ahead 2-1.Desperate for an equaliser, India head coach Khalid Jamil made plenty of substitutions hoping to inject some pace and urgency, bringing Rahim Ali and Udanta Singh in place of Liston Colaco and Sunil Chhetri. But all these changes did not work as India ended on the wrong side of the result.Brandon Fernandes missed out on a great chance to restore parity for India on the 90th minute after excellent work from Udanta Singh and Rahul Bheke. He hit the ball wide with his weaker foot with the goal at his mercy.Only the group winner will qualify for the Asian Cup and Hong Kong and Singapore currently lead the table with eight points each.Coming into the game with just two points from three matches, India needed nothing less than a win to stay in contention for the top spot in the group.India also missed couple of chances in the first half, during a period of play when they were dominating the contest.Jamil attributed the defeat, and rightly so, to ""lack of concentration"" on part of the India players, who have endured another disappointing campaign.","Singapore beat India 1-2 in their Asian Cup qualifier in Fatorda, Goa.

England secured their spot in the 2026 World Cup with a commanding 5-0 victory over Latvia, while Portugal's qualification was delayed after a 2-2 draw with Hungary on Tuesday. The matches were marked by notable performances from Harry Kane and Cristiano Ronaldo , while pro-Palestinian demonstrations preceded Italy's crucial win against Israel.England maintained their perfect record in Group K, securing their sixth consecutive win in Riga. The victory gave them an unassailable seven-point lead at the top of the group with 18 points, confirming their World Cup qualification with two games remaining.Anthony Gordon initiated the scoring for England before Harry Kane added two goals, including a penalty, to make it 3-0 by halftime. Kane's performance continued his impressive run, bringing his total to 21 goals in 13 games this season for club and country.""It comes rarely that you qualify for a World Cup, so the mood is very, very good,"" said England manager Thomas Tuchel.The match concluded with an own goal by Maksims Tonisevs and a fifth goal from Eberechi Eze, cementing England's dominant performance.In Group F, Portugal's qualification celebrations were put on hold after a dramatic 2-2 draw with Hungary in Lisbon. Hungary took the lead through Attila Szalai's header before Ronaldo equalized and later scored again, extending his international scoring record to 143 goals in 225 appearances.Ronaldo's performance also earned him the record for most goals in World Cup qualifying with 41, surpassing Guatemala's Carlos Ruiz's previous record of 39. However, Hungary's Dominik Szoboszlai scored in injury time to secure the draw.Italy's match against Israel in Udine was preceded by protests, with pro-Palestinian demonstrators clashing with police while thousands peacefully marched through the city. The demonstrations were sparked by concerns over hosting the match amid Israel's military offensive in Gaza.The Azzurri secured a 3-0 victory in the Group I fixture, with Mateo Retegui scoring twice and Gianluca Mancini adding a third. The win ensures Italy will finish at least second in the group, positioning them three points behind leaders Norway with two games remaining.Spain continued their strong qualifying campaign in Group E, defeating Bulgaria 4-0 in Valladolid. Mikel Merino scored two headers, bringing his qualifying tally to six goals in four games, while an own goal by Atanas Chernev and a penalty from Mikel Oyarzabal completed the scoring.""We don't have much further to go to get to the World Cup, but it's not done yet... I hope we keep winning,"" Merino stated after the match.In other matches, Serbia overcame an early setback to defeat Andorra 3-1, keeping them one point behind Albania in Group K. Guillaume Lopez had given Andorra the lead with a remarkable goal from inside the center circle.Turkey maintained pressure on Spain in Group E with a 4-1 victory over Georgia, featuring two goals from Merih Demiral and additional scores from Kenan Yildiz and Yunus Akgun.The European qualifying system guarantees direct World Cup qualification for all 12 group winners, with runners-up advancing to playoffs.

The update came just before the Bengals’ Week 7 matchup against the Pittsburgh Steelers on Thursday Night Football. Burrow, spotted on the sideline in a walking boot, is recovering from a turf toe injury suffered in Week 2 against Jacksonville. His return could dramatically change the Bengals’ playoff outlook.Head coach Zac Taylor confirmed earlier this season that the team never ruled out Burrow’s return in 2025. “He is on track, doing well, has had no setbacks,” Rapoport said during the pregame show. “If this continues in this direction, he should be back on the field mid-December, and has told people close to him that he absolutely intends to be back.”Burrow’s injury required surgery performed by Dr. Norman Waldrop in September, and the recovery timeline projected around three months. The fact that Burrow has avoided setbacks so far is a strong sign for Bengals fans eager to see their star quarterback back in uniform.With Joe Flacco currently leading the offense, Cincinnati is fighting to stay alive in the AFC North race. A win against the Steelers would pull the Bengals within two games of the division leaders, setting up a realistic postseason chase.Their next two opponents—the New York Jets and the Chicago Bears—both at home, give the team a solid chance to gain momentum before their bye week.Burrow’s presence on the sideline already energizes the team, but his potential return could do much more. The Bengals’ offense has struggled to find consistency without him, managing just flashes of their usual rhythm under Flacco and Jake Browning. Before his injury, Burrow completed 21 of 36 passes for 189 yards and two touchdowns, showing glimpses of his sharp decision-making and poise in the pocket.If his recovery continues as planned, Cincinnati could receive a crucial boost right when the playoff race heats up. A healthy Joe Burrow returning in December might just be the spark the Bengals need to turn their season around and make a late surge toward the postseason.Also Read: Aaron Rodgers’ secret wife Brittani sparks curiosity as mystery deepens around their private marriage","Cincinnati Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow could be back on the field by mid- December, NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport said.

Mark Sanchez’s career on the brink as stabbing scandal and felony charges threaten to end his NFL broadcast comeback,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/mark-sanchezs-career-on-the-brink-as-stabbing-scandal-and-felony-charges-threaten-to-end-his-nfl-broadcast-comeback/articleshow/124617953.cms,"Former Jets QB Mark Sanchez is off Fox Sports airwaves following a violent altercation in Indianapolis where he was stabbed and charged with felony battery. The incident, reportedly over a parking dispute, has led to a criminal investigation and a civil lawsuit. His broadcasting future and health are now uncertain as Fox quietly reshuffles its NFL coverage.

Fox Sports quietly reshuffles broadcast teams amid Mark Sanchez’s absence





A once-promising broadcast career now at a crossroads

Former New York Jets quarterback Mark Sanchez remains off the air at Fox Sports as questions mount regarding his health, legal situation, and broadcasting future. The 38-year-old analyst has yet to return since being involved in a violent altercation and stabbing incident earlier this month in Indianapolis, casting uncertainty over what was shaping up to be a promising second career in sports media.The troubling incident occurred on October 4, when Sanchez allegedly got into a confrontation with Perry Tole, a 69-year-old truck driver, reportedly over a parking dispute outside a hotel. According to authorities, the argument escalated quickly, resulting in Sanchez being stabbed and later charged with felony battery and multiple misdemeanors.After being hospitalized and subsequently released, Sanchez was booked into Marion County Jail. The case has since evolved into a dual battle for the former quarterback, a criminal investigation and a civil lawsuit filed by Tole, who claims “permanent disfigurement, loss of mobility, and emotional distress.”Sanchez, who has been recovering privately, told reporters he is “recovering slowly” and described his rehabilitation as a “long process.” However, beyond his brief statement, both he and Fox have maintained an unusually tight-lipped stance regarding the situation.As the network moves deeper into the 2025 NFL season, Fox has reassigned Sanchez’s role on its No. 6 broadcast team. Analysts Brady Quinn and Mark Schlereth have alternated in his place alongside play-by-play announcer Chris Myers, while Adam Amin and Joe Davis adjust to scheduling shifts linked to MLB postseason coverage.Industry insiders suggest Fox’s silence is deliberate, a cautious legal strategy meant to avoid influencing the ongoing proceedings. Yet, as weeks pass without a formal update, speculation grows that Sanchez may not return to the booth this season.Sanchez joined Fox Sports in 2021, quickly gaining recognition for his sharp game analysis and insider perspective. His chemistry with co-commentators and understanding of quarterback play made him one of Fox’s rising broadcast talents.Now, both his health and legal troubles jeopardize that trajectory. While Sanchez has expressed optimism about returning to the air, Fox’s cautious stance and the unresolved legal situation could delay or even derail his comeback.Also Read: Who is Chase Brown’s girlfriend?

Chase Brown’s 2025 season and life off the field



Chase Brown’s journey from a fifth-round draft pick in 2023 to one of the Cincinnati Bengals’ key offensive players has been nothing short of inspiring. After an explosive 2024 season with 1,350 scrimmage yards and 11 total touchdowns, Brown has become a name to watch. While the Bengals’ 2025 season hasn’t started ideally, fans are equally curious about the man behind the helmet — and the woman who’s been cheering him on from the sidelines, Jazmyn Brock.Jazmyn Brock is more than just Chase Brown’s girlfriend — she’s a driven and athletic woman carving out her own space in the fitness world. A professional fitness trainer and social media influencer, Brock specializes in the Lagree method, a high-intensity workout focused on core and muscular endurance. With over 12,000 Instagram followers, she regularly shares motivational fitness content and glimpses of her family life.Originally from San Diego, Brock was once a cheerleader for the San Diego State Aztecs football team. Her athletic background is evident in her training style and energetic personality. While the exact details of how she met Brown remain private, fans began connecting the dots when she attended a Bengals game in August 2023.By June 2024, she made their relationship official with a heartfelt Instagram post featuring the star running back.In January 2025, the couple welcomed their first child, a baby boy. Brock shared the joyful news on Instagram, posting an adorable picture of the family at Bengals’ training camp over the summer. It’s clear that she and their son have become an integral part of Brown’s support system — both on and off the field.Though Chase Brown’s off-field life is flourishing, the 2025 season has tested his resilience. With the Bengals struggling to a 2-4 record and star quarterback Joe Burrow sidelined by injury, the offense has faced challenges. Brown, who averaged 4.3 yards per carry last season, has dipped to 2.7 yards this year, earning a D+ grade and an impact score of 67.8 from PFSN’s Running Back Impact metric.Still, Brown’s dedication hasn’t wavered. As the Bengals prepare to face the Pittsburgh Steelers, New York Jets, and Chicago Bears, there’s hope the team — and Brown — can reignite their spark. No matter what happens on the field, one thing remains constant: Chase Brown has a strong foundation at home with Jazmyn Brock and their growing family cheering him on every step of the way.Also Read: Who is Shae Cornette?

Though Warren is still in the earlier stages of his career, these supplemental income streams offer room for growth.It’s crucial to remember that net worth is not static, it fluctuates based on investments, taxes, expenses, and market conditions.

Shae Cornette’s journey to ‘ First Take ’

ESPN confirmed the move on Thursday, signaling the start of a new chapter for one of its most-watched morning programs. Cornette said she’s “ready to step into this role” and bring her energy to the debate desk.Shae Cornette is an experienced sports journalist and broadcaster who has steadily climbed her way to prominence in the media industry. A graduate of Indiana University with degrees in broadcast journalism and kinesiology, Cornette’s career began at the Big Ten Network and The Chicago Huddle. She quickly became a familiar face to sports fans in Chicago, where she reported on the Bears and hosted several pre- and postgame shows.Her work ethic and on-air charisma helped her expand her career to national platforms, including Campus Insiders, Fox 32, and later ESPN Radio and SiriusXM NFL Radio. Cornette joined ESPN in 2020, where she anchored SportsCenter and hosted college football coverage. In an interview with Westport Magazine, Cornette shared how her ESPN journey began unexpectedly when she filled in for her husband, Jordan Cornette, on ESPN 1000 radio in Chicago.That opportunity eventually brought her to Bristol, Connecticut, where she continued building her national profile.Cornette’s path to First Take was marked by steady growth and perseverance.

“Gold digger”: Controversy erupts as Jordon Hudson tightens her grip on Bill Belichick’s career and reputation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/gold-digger-controversy-erupts-as-jordon-hudson-tightens-her-grip-on-bill-belichicks-career-and-reputation/articleshow/124607362.cms,"Legendary coach Bill Belichick's stoic image has shifted, with his much younger girlfriend, Jordon Hudson, now a prominent figure. Despite criticism labeling her a 'gold digger,' insiders reveal Hudson has brought out a happier, more public side of Belichick, managing his ventures and even trademarking the controversial term, hinting at a new career path.

From small-town beginnings to the national spotlight

Why Jordon Hudson might be the partner Belichick didn’t know he needed

For decades, Bill Belichick was the stoic face of NFL dominance, a six-time Super Bowl champion defined by grit, strategy, and emotional restraint. But in the past two years, the legendary coach’s reputation has taken a surprising turn, thanks to his much younger girlfriend, Jordon Hudson. At 24, the former college cheerleader and beauty pageant contestant has become one of the most talked-about figures in sports and pop culture and not always for the reasons she’d like.Jordon Hudson’s story started far from the glitz of NFL sidelines. Raised in Hancock, Maine, she worked her way through college at Bridgewater State University, where she earned praise from teammates for her kindness, drive, and leadership. Former cheerleader Emily Rodriguez remembered Hudson as “a really good teammate and someone I could look up to,” adding that she often helped others without hesitation.Those who knew her back then describe a determined young woman who was both hardworking and ambitious, traits that may have helped her transition from college athlete to a woman managing the brand of one of football’s most private icons.But with fame has come scrutiny. Since going public with Belichick, Hudson has been branded a “gold digger” and accused by critics of manipulating the 73-year-old coach.Others, however, argue that this perception is unfair. Her former employer, Dougie Freeman, described her as “patient and gentle,” while a former boyfriend, Joshua L. Zuckerman, called her “wise beyond her years.”Despite public backlash, insiders say Hudson’s influence has brought out a side of Belichick fans have never seen. “I have not seen [Bill] smile more than I have seen him smile in the past year,” said sports artist Mahlon Williams. Those close to the couple describe Hudson as hands-on, managing Belichick’s media deals, creative ventures, and even his upcoming Hulu docuseries.As one insider noted, “He is very happy. He is clearly proud to be in a relationship with Jordon.” And if her recent move to trademark the word “gold digger” is any sign, Hudson isn’t just surviving the criticism, she’s owning it, and perhaps turning controversy into her next career move.Also Read: Rams get unexpected help from MLB’s Baltimore Orioles ahead of crucial Week 7 London showdown — Here's how","Jordon Hudson, 24, has become one of the most talked-about figures in sports and pop culture.

But he says just two days after signing that order, Kim went on Kristin Cavallari’s podcast and started talking about their breakup. She also made comments about Kroy and their children.Kroy Buermann adds that Kim later appeared on TV with Andy Cohen and again spoke about their divorce.

Jimmy Butler injury update : Steve Kerr stays optimistic ahead of regular season



Jimmy Butler’s presence remains vital for Golden State Warriors’ success



The Golden State Warriors are wrapping up their preseason on a cautious note, as star forward Jimmy Butler is expected to remain sidelined with an ankle injury. While his MRI results came back clean, Butler is considered doubtful for Friday’s matchup against the Los Angeles Clippers. Head coach Steve Kerr has reassured fans that the team isn’t overly concerned, noting that Butler is still expected to return in time for the regular-season opener against the Los Angeles Lakers on October 21.During his stint with the Golden State Warriors, Jimmy Butler averaged 18.3 points, 5.8 rebounds, and 5.7 assists over 41 games, proving his value as both a scorer and facilitator. However, his preseason rhythm was interrupted by a minor ankle sprain that caused swelling and forced him to sit out recent matchups.According to Kerr, Butler’s MRI “came back clean,” which is a promising sign. “We’re not concerned,” the coach said. Still, the Warriors will hold him out as a precaution. “It’s been seamless, and it’s because of Jimmy’s IQ,” Kerr added. “He has an incredible feel ... he’s making the right reads and in the right place on both ends.”This marks the first full season of Butler’s tenure with the Warriors following his midseason trade from the Miami Heat in February.His arrival transformed Golden State’s momentum almost immediately— the team went 23–7 after the deal, stabilizing a rocky start to the campaign. Butler’s integration was so seamless that the Warriors quickly extended his stay, signing him to a two-year, $121 million contract through 2027.Butler’s impact on the Warriors extends beyond the stat sheet. Steph Curry praised the veteran forward for easing the offensive load. “Every possession doesn’t feel as hard,” Curry said. “You have to worry about someone else. If there is a double and you get off it, something good is going to happen on the back end.”Curry also highlighted Butler’s versatility: “He’s a shot creator, a finisher, somebody that you have to take into account no matter where he’s on the floor. He plays at his own speed, can get to the foul line and takes advantage of matchups. He’s a competitor at the highest of levels.”The Warriors will likely lean on that competitive fire as they begin the new season against a short-handed Los Angeles Lakers squad missing LeBron James. As of now, Butler’s injury appears to be minor, but his return will be key to keeping Golden State’s championship window open in an increasingly competitive Western Conference.Also Read: Jimmy Butler's Championship Oath For Stephen Curry And Golden State Warriors Teammate Signals Selfless Gesture Ahead Of Upcoming Season","Golden State Warriors forward Jimmy Butler is expected to remain sidelined with an ankle injury.

Why Milwaukee Might Agree to the Deal

The Giannis-Luka Dream Duo

What’s Next for Both Teams

Themight be on the verge of a massive shake-up involving two of the biggest names in basketball - LeBron James and. Following the Lakers’ surprising acquisition of Luka Dončić, questions have emerged about LeBron’s long-term future in Los Angeles and whether the franchise is ready to turn the page on its most iconic star.According to Fansided’s Matt Moore, the Los Angeles Lakers may be exploring a blockbuster deal that would send LeBron James , Austin Reaves, and two first-round picks to the Milwaukee Bucks in exchange for Giannis Antetokounmpo and Kyle Kuzma.While LeBron remains one of the greatest to ever play the game, the Lakers ’ front office seems to be moving toward a younger core built around Dončić. Moore stated, “For the Lakers, they allow LeBron to end his career on his terms and secure Giannis next to Luka.”Reports suggest that James has grown increasingly unhappy with how the Los Angeles Lakers handled the offseason. Moore noted, “LeBron was clearly unhappy with how the Lakers basically put him to pasture this summer and moved on from him. That’s evident from all sorts of angles.” (H/t Sporting News)This frustration may be fueling speculation that both parties could soon part ways - possibly on mutual terms.From Milwaukee’s perspective, the trade could make sense despite losing a generational talent in Antetokounmpo. The Bucks ’ roster is aging, and the team has struggled to build a championship-caliber supporting cast around Giannis. With their window closing, the chance to add Austin Reaves and future first-round picks could jumpstart a rebuild.Interestingly, sources believe Milwaukee would view Reaves and the draft picks as the main assets rather than LeBron himself, as the 21-time All-Star is nearing the end of his illustrious career.If the trade were to happen, the pairing of Luka Dončić and Giannis Antetokounmpo could redefine the NBA landscape. Both players are in their prime, and their combination of skill, athleticism, and leadership could create a dynasty in Los Angeles for years to come.Giannis has often expressed his desire to compete at the highest level, and a move to the Los Angeles Lakers would give him that opportunity. Playing alongside Dončić - another European superstar - could also be an appealing storyline for international fans and the league’s global reach.While this proposed deal remains speculative, it highlights growing tension between stars and franchises. Both LeBron and Giannis have expressed dissatisfaction with their current team situations.If these frustrations continue, the NBA could be heading toward one of its most dramatic superstar trades in recent history - a move that could reshape both conferences and alter the balance of power across the league.Also read: NBA trade rumors: Golden State Warriors predicted to sign $186 million Milwaukee Bucks superstar to form Big 3 with Stephen Curry and Jimmy Butler For now, the basketball world waits to see whether the Los Angeles Lakers will truly move on from their 21-time All-Star and usher in a new era centered around Dončić and potentially Giannis Antetokounmpo.",LeBron James and Giannis Antetokounmpo could be on the verge of a massive shake- up.

Key Trade Implications

Theare reportedly exploring a blockbuster move that could redefine the franchise’s future. According to Fansided’s Matt Moore, the team may consider parting ways with long-time defensive anchor Draymond Green to acquire- a player with a massive $175 million contract and generational talent.After a quiet offseason, the Golden State Warriors ’ biggest addition has been veteran forward Al Horford, making them one of the oldest teams in NBA history. Despite that, the front office remains confident that Stephen Curry can still lead the franchise to another deep playoff run.The organization is reportedly waiting until midseason to determine whether this current roster can keep pace with the Western Conference elite. If they prove competitive, major trade talks could intensify before the deadline.“You fundamentally reshape your entire future instead of trying to sneak out one more title. It buys you time to reconfigure and extend your success and avoid a post-Steph rebuild,” Matt Moore said Monday. (H/t: Sporting News)Moore’s statement highlights what could be a defining moment for Golden State - choosing between loyalty to its core and building for the next era.Moore’s trade scenario involves the Golden State Warriors sending several key assets to Milwaukee in exchange for Giannis Antetokounmpo This trade would mean Golden State parting with a franchise icon and its young depth - a steep price even for a two-time MVP. However, pairing Giannis with Curry could immediately catapult the Golden State Warriors back into title contention.The addition of stretch big men like Quinten Post and Al Horford gives the Golden State Warriors more spacing than in previous seasons, allowing Giannis to dominate inside without clogging the floor. His explosive playstyle could perfectly complement Curry’s perimeter shooting, creating one of the most dynamic duos in NBA history.For Milwaukee, the move represents a potential reset. The Bucks have struggled recently despite Giannis’s brilliance, and a package featuring young talents like Moody and Podziemski, along with multiple first-round picks, offers a clear path toward rebuilding.• For the Warriors: A chance to extend their championship window beyond the Curry era• For the Bucks: Long-term assets and flexibility to reshape their roster• For Draymond Green: The possible end of a legendary run with Golden StateTrading Draymond Green - a four-time champion and defensive cornerstone - would be one of the toughest decisions in franchise history. Yet as Moore points out, “You can’t justify moving one of your franchise icons for almost any player. Giannis is not just any player.”If executed, the trade would mark the end of an era while simultaneously ushering in a new one built around Stephen Curry and Giannis Antetokounmpo.

Shams Charania reveals important Paul George return timeline for Philadelphia 76ers

Paul George’s versatile talent shines despite injury setbacks

According to sources, ESPN's Shams Charania informed on Thursday that Philadelphia 76ers star Paul George is anticipated to miss the opening night due to his recovery from the offseason knee surgery. Charania also gave an update on George's recovery. On Wednesday, the 2010 first-round pick is not anticipated to play against Boston. Charania further said that after having an arthroscopic operation on his left knee in July, George has made great strides and may make his 2025–26 debut shortly into the regular season.On Friday night, the Philadelphia 76ers will play the Minnesota Timberwolves to wrap up their preseason. The 76ers will next travel to play the Boston Celtics on Wednesday night to begin their regular season.Paul George has not played in the 76ers' first three preseason games. Following an injury sustained during a workout, the star forward underwent arthroscopic surgery on his left knee in July. Talking about his possible return, Shams Charania said:""I've been talking to people in Paul George's camp, and I'm told that it is not expected that he will be suiting up for opening night next Wednesday in Boston.”George's recovery is reportedly going well, according to Charania. The Philadelphia 76ers can anticipate his return ""shortly"" after the regular season begins. Charania also said:""He still has some check marks he has to hit from his rehab process..Because, remember, Paul George never got right last season--after having a hyper-extended knee. He had multiple other knee injuries in the preseason, early in the year, and every time he really rushed back, because of not only the Sixers' start to the year, the other injuries.He then added:""This team has Joel Embiid, other players. That was his first season in Philly as well. So Paul George never had the chance to be fully himself, fully healthy. And that's why being back exactly when he feels like he can be comfortable and sustain his health. That's been a big part of all this--to not have a repeat of last season.""According to insiders, he is making great strides but still needs to meet certain requirements before participating in a regular-season game. George is anticipated to make his debut early in the regular season Due to many injuries to his left knee and problems with his finger and groin, George only made 41 games in his first season in Philadelphia. The Sixers owe George over $212 million, and it was a terrible way to start a four-year contract.George was due for a follow-up assessment in September after having an arthroscopic procedure on his left knee in July for an injury he got while working out. His debut season with the 76ers was marked by an average of 16.2 points, 5.3 rebounds, and 4.3 assists. The knee injury prevented Philadelphia from having the season they had hoped for.The 76ers had the third-worst record in the Eastern Conference after finishing with a 24-58 record. However, after George’s return, they are hoping for a comeback.Also read: Philadelphia 76ers rookie VJ Edgecombe meets NBA legend Dwyane Wade in surreal full-circle moment at Aramis event",Philadelphia 76ers star Paul George is not expected to play against Boston Celtics on Wednesday.

Who Stands to Win the Most?

Thecould be preparing for one of the boldest moves in recent NBA history - a potential blockbuster trade involving rising star Austin Reaves and Milwaukee Bucks superstar. The rumor has set the basketball world buzzing, igniting debates about how such a deal could reshape both franchises and redefine the league’s balance of power.Reports suggest the Los Angeles Lakers are exploring a trade package centered around Austin Reaves, along with three future first-round draft picks and possibly other assets like Rui Hachimura, in a sign-and-trade scenario to acquire Giannis Antetokounmpo.Austin Reaves, who has become a fan favorite for his grit and offensive breakout, reportedly turned down a lucrative contract extension this offseason. Instead, he’s betting on himself to secure a bigger payday next summer - potentially worth up to $40 million per year. Those salary demands could strain the Los Angeles Lakers’ cap flexibility, especially with the team already juggling the contracts of Luka Dončić and other key pieces.Meanwhile, Giannis Antetokounmpo remains under contract with the Bucks through the 2027-28 season but holds a player option that could allow him to enter free agency afterward. If Milwaukee once again falls short in the postseason, the franchise might be forced to reconsider its long-term direction, possibly entertaining trade offers for their two-time MVP. For the Los Angeles Lakers , absorbing Giannis Antetokounmpo’s massive deal - projected to hit around $62.8 million in its final year - would require creative salary matching and asset management.However, Los Angeles has the tools to make it work. With a growing pool of draft picks and several expiring contracts, the Lakers could feasibly construct an appealing offer that would tempt the Bucks to consider parting ways with their franchise cornerstone.• Secure a generational superstar in Giannis Antetokounmpo, pairing him with Luka Dončić to form one of the most formidable duos in NBA history.• Transition from the LeBron James era into a long-term foundation built around two prime-aged superstars.• Immediately elevate championship odds with Giannis’s dominant defense, elite finishing, and unmatched physicality.• Land a young, rising offensive talent in Austin Reaves, who offers shooting, playmaking, and defensive potential at a more manageable salary.• Gain valuable draft picks to rebuild or restructure around a new core.• Free up future cap space and flexibility to reshape the team post-Giannis.• Although it means leaving Los Angeles, Reaves would step into a bigger role in Milwaukee with a chance to shine as a focal point.• Likely secures a significant contract extension, ensuring long-term financial stability.A Giannis-Dončić partnership would create a unique blend of offensive power and defensive dominance. Dončić’s perimeter shooting and vision would perfectly complement Giannis’s ability to attack the paint and protect the rim - giving the Los Angeles Lakers a balanced, unstoppable duo.If the deal goes through, the Los Angeles Lakers could emerge as the biggest winners. Acquiring Giannis Antetokounmpo would instantly transform Los Angeles into a championship juggernaut for the foreseeable future. With Dončić already in place, Giannis’s arrival would fix the team’s defensive issues and provide the inside dominance they’ve been lacking.For the Bucks, losing Giannis Antetokounmpo would be painful, but landing Austin Reaves and a haul of draft picks would give them the flexibility to rebuild around young talent and future assets. It’s a strategic move that could set the stage for long-term stability.As for Reaves, a move to Milwaukee would give him the platform to evolve into a true star. His offensive skill set could thrive in a new system, and the financial rewards would follow.Still, the Los Angeles Lakers would need to weigh the emotional and financial costs. Austin Reaves’s popularity and loyalty to the franchise make him difficult to let go. Moreover, the financial implications of adding Giannis’s max contract could tighten their flexibility for future roster moves.If Giannis remains healthy and motivated, this gamble could define the Los Angeles Lakers’ next era of dominance. But if things go south - injuries, chemistry issues, or cap restrictions - the trade could backfire, leaving them short on assets and depth.Also read: NBA Trade Rumors: Denver Nuggets Could Dish Out $140 Million Contract to 2023 NBA Champion Ahead of 2025-26 Season In the end, this rumored deal captures everything that makes NBA trade speculation so thrilling - high risk, high reward, and the potential for history-making impact. Whether it becomes reality or remains just a tantalizing “what if,” the idea of Giannis Antetokounmpo joining the Los Angeles Lakers is enough to keep fans and analysts captivated across the basketball world.","Basketball fans are abuzz with a potential blockbuster trade: the Los Angeles Lakers might send rising star Austin Reaves, future picks, and other assets to the Milwaukee Bucks for Giannis Antetokounmpo.

NBA veteran Spencer Dinwiddie gets waived by Charlotte Hornets a week before Regular Season starts,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/nba-veteran-spencer-dinwiddie-gets-waived-by-charlotte-hornets-a-week-before-regular-season-starts/articleshow/124614754.cms,"Spencer Dinwiddie (Image via X)

Spencer Dinwiddie's NBA future dwindles amid contract waiving

Spencer Dinwiddie's contract waiving comes as a surprise to many

With less than one week to go before the 2025-26 NBA regular season starts, the Charlotte Hornets have decided to waive Spencer Dinwiddie in order to not exceed the limit of having maximum 15 standard contracts on their roster. The NBA veteran had signed with the team back in July after entering free agency, and now only three months later without even getting to play for the team, he has been waived.The regular season starts on October 21, and Spencer Dinwiddie has only played a couple of preseason games from the Charlotte Hornets before his contract got waived by the team. He had joined the team after his 1-year contract with the Dallas Mavericks came to an end at the end of the 2024-25 season, where he averaged 11 points, 4.4 assists, and 2.6 rebounds per game in 79 appearances for the Mavs.With only a few days in hand before the regular season starts, the Hornets alongside the Brooklyn Nets and Washington Wizards were 3 out of the 30 NBA teams that had 16 players on their current roster standard contract. And to keep to the limit, the Hornets have decided to waive Dinwiddie before the deadline, whom they had signed on a 1-year, $3.6 million deal. Now the question arises, where will he end up, as the season starts soon.Although one player was set to have his contract waived to maintain the limit of having 15 players on standard contract on the roster, the fact that it is Spencer Dinwiddie's contract that has been waived came as a surprise to many. Many had believed it would be Pat Connaughton, who is set to receive a $9.4 salary this season, would be the one to go.Even LaMelo Ball, who has been prone to injuries throughout his 5-year long career so far, was seen by some as the one to go, even though he is essentially one of the best players on the Hornets current roster. But surprising most, it is Dinwiddie instead who is set to leave before he could make his mark on the team. At 32 years old, he has averaged 13.0 points, 5.1 assists, and 3.0 rebounds in 27.7 minutes in 621 games so far, with 345 starts in his career so far.Also Read: Jonathan Kuminga’s explosive outburst leaves Golden State Warriors stunned in a heated preseason showdown","Spencer Dinwiddie's contract has been waived by the Charlotte Hornets.

Jonathan Kuminga’s fiery outburst led to dramatic twist in Golden State Warriors ’ preseason clash

Jonathan Kuminga returns to Golden State Warriors after sealing new contract

The Golden State Warriors recently defeated the Portland Trail Blazers during their preseason match. Amidst the victory, Jonathan Kuminga was reportedly kicked out. Kuminga was also fined $35,000 by the NBA for his alleged antics that resulted in his dismissal during Tuesday night's match. According to James Jones, Executive Vice President, Head of Basketball Operations, this happened because he allegedly established inappropriate contact with the game officials.In the middle of Golden State's match against the Portland Trail Blazers at Moda Centre, Kuminga was given a technical foul. He again attempted a shot and was not blown off, which infuriated him. As he had some issues with certain decisions, he went straight to referee Rodney Mott, and started arguing with him. He was then asked to leave by the referee.He also received a punishment from the league two days later for ""making inappropriate contact with and continuing to pursue a game official."" NBA Communications reported on X:“Golden State Warriors forward Jonathan Kuminga has been fined $35,000 for making inappropriate contact and continuing to pursue a game official, it was announced today by James Jones, Executive Vice President, Head of Basketball Operations.”Meanwhile, according to Warriors’ head coach Steve Kerr, he ""kind of liked [the ejection], actually"" after the game.Kerr said:""He got fouled.. It was a frustration play. I have no problem with it. He deserved the foul. He was getting fouled quite a bit. It was a physical game. I wasn't surprised he got ejected because he kind of got right in [Mott's] face… You can't do that. They are going to eject you if you do that.""He further said during the post-game conference:""The way he ran on [the ejection] play, the activity he played with, the rebounding… That's the JK who can really help our team, I loved the way he played. I love the fire, the passion, I don't mind the ejection at all."" Kuminga did seem upset about what he believed to be a missed call at that moment in the game, and he reportedly carried that annoyance into the locker room after being dismissed from the match.In the locker room after the game, Kuminga told ESPN that he was most angry about his right ankle being clipped on his step, even if it seemed like his arm had been struck during the drive. He remembered the injury when Portland Trail Blazers forward Deni Avdija stepped on Kuminga's severely twisted right ankle last season.Kuminga re-joined the G.S. Warriors early this month on a two-year, $46.8 million deal after continuous contract negotiations this summer. He was averaging 7 points, 6 rebounds, and 4 assists when he was let go, and he had been displaying some improved style this preseason.Through four seasons with Golden State, Kuminga averaged 12.5 points, 4.0 rebounds, 1.8 assists, and 22.0 minutes on 258 games before the Warriors selected him with the 7th overall pick of the 2021 NBA Draft. In 34 career playoff games, he has averaged 7.0 points and 1.6 rebounds in 11.4 minutes, and was a member of the Warriors' championship 2022 NBA team.Also read: Jonathan Kuminga’s future in jeopardy?

Akinjo’s Fit with Nikola Jokić

What This Signing Means for Denver

Theare gearing up for the 2025 NBA season by making another notable roster addition. With just days left before tip-off, the reigning Western Conference contenders have added depth to their backcourt by signing formerto an Exhibit 10 contract.Standing at 6-foot-1, James Akinjo has spent much of his professional journey in the NBA G League, where he’s built a reputation as a crafty playmaker. He previously played for the Westchester Knicks, the G League affiliate of the New York Knicks , before moving to the Wisconsin Herd - the Milwaukee Bucks’ G League team - where he emerged as a standout performer.In 25 games with the Herd, Akinjo averaged:His consistency and leadership on the floor caught the attention of several NBA scouts, ultimately earning him an opportunity with the Denver Nuggets.Last season, Denver gave former MVP Russell Westbrook a chance to revitalize his career - and it paid off. Westbrook’s energy off the bench gave the Denver Nuggets a spark they had been missing at the guard spot. However, with the veteran signing with the Sacramento Kings this offseason, Denver needed a new backup guard to help ease the load on Jamal Murray and support Nikola Jokić in the playmaking department.The Denver Nuggets have been active in the offseason, making several roster moves to bolster their depth and versatility.The most significant of these was trading away forward Michael Porter Jr. in exchange for Cameron Johnson from the Brooklyn Nets. The team also brought in experienced veterans Tim Hardaway Jr., Bruce Brown, and Jonas Valančiūnas to strengthen the rotation.These moves suggest Denver is focused on balancing star power with reliable depth - a strategy that helped them win the championship in 2023.Being on the same team as Nikola Jokić presents an exciting opportunity for any guard, particularly one looking to establish himself in the NBA. The Serbian center’s elite passing and high basketball IQ often elevate the play of those around him, creating ideal conditions for a guard like Akinjo to thrive.If James Akinjo can develop chemistry with Jokić similar to the dynamic between Jamal Murray and the two-time MVP, he could carve out a meaningful role in Denver’s rotation. His quick decision-making, perimeter shooting, and defensive intensity align well with the Denver Nuggets’ system.While James Akinjo’s contract is non-guaranteed, it opens the door for him to make his NBA debut and compete for a spot on the regular-season roster. The Nuggets have struggled in the past to find a consistent backup guard, and Akinjo’s hunger to prove himself could bring fresh energy to the team.Also read: NBA Trade News: Russell Westbrook officially agreed to sign with the Sacramento Kings in blockbuster move for his 18th NBA season For the Denver Nuggets, this signing is about more than just filling a vacancy - it’s about sustaining momentum and maintaining the chemistry that revolves around Nikola Jokić’s unique playmaking. As Denver transitions into another competitive season, James Akinjo’s addition could quietly become one of their smartest offseason moves.","James Akinjo has signed an Exhibit 10 contract with the Denver Nuggets.

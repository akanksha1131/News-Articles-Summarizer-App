Inside Eden Debacle: How India missed many tricks during their shocking defeat

Poll Do you believe that Sai Sudharsan is the right choice to replace Shubman Gill? Definitely Not sure No, prefer someone else

NEW DELHI: Team India captain Shubman Gill has been ruled out of the must-win second Test against South Africa in Guwahati, dealing the hosts a major setback ahead of the series decider. Gill, who missed the second innings of the opening Test in Kolkata after suffering a neck injury, had travelled with the squad to Assam but will not take the field on Saturday.Gill’s injury, sustained on Day 2 at Eden Gardens, forced him to sit out India’s chase of 124 — a pursuit that ended in a 30-run defeat. Though the 26-year-old was discharged from a Kolkata hospital and appeared without a neck brace on arrival in Guwahati, the medical team advised against exposing him to the physical intensity of a five-day match. According to an NDTV report, Gill was “desperate to play” but the risk of aggravation was deemed too high.The report further added that India will turn to 24-year-old Sai Sudharsan to fill the void at the top. The left-hander, who debuted in England in June, has featured in five Tests, scoring 273 runs at 30.33. His last outing, against West Indies in October, included a composed 87, and the team management believes his temperament suits the high-stakes scenario.Gill’s injury management will now likely extend beyond the current match. News agency PTI reported that the Indian skipper may need at least 10 more days of recovery and rehabilitation, making his participation in the upcoming ODI series, beginning November 30 in Ranchi, highly doubtful. With little on the line in that series, selectors are expected to rest him before bringing him back for the T20 leg.The injury also comes at a delicate leadership moment. With ODI vice-captain Shreyas Iyer still recovering from his own setback, the management is wary of a temporary shift in captaincy, which could open the door for KL Rahul or Axar Patel in a stop-gap role.India have strengthened their squad ahead of the Guwahati Test, drafting in Nitish Kumar Reddy early and keeping Sai Sudharsan and Devdutt Padikkal in the mix. The city, hosting its first-ever Test, is expected to offer turn and bounce on a red-soil surface — conditions where Gill’s right-handed batting would have been invaluable.",India captain Shubman Gill ruled out of second Test against South Africa in Guwahati.

'When you don't play well, this is what happens': Gautam Gambhir reacts to 1st Test defeat, points out what India lacked

India’s 30 run defeat to South Africa in the opening Test has sparked strong reactions from fans and former cricketers, many of whom pointed fingers at the Eden Gardens surface in Kolkata. The pitch produced uneven bounce that suited the fast bowlers, while also giving enough assistance to the spinners. Simon Harmer proved to be the main threat for the visitors, collecting eight wickets and guiding South Africa to a hard fought win.After the match, India head coach Gautam Gambhir defended the surface and said that a more defensive approach from the batters could have allowed them to score. His remark did not go down quietly. Former South African star AB de Villiers felt Gambhir was indirectly criticising the Indian players for their poor show in Kolkata. Speaking on his YouTube channel, de Villiers said ""he barely had time to blink before the Test was over. He highlighted Gambhir’s words about the wicket being exactly what India wanted and wondered if the coach was having a go at the players, saying ‘This what we prepared, why didn’t we perform?""De Villiers also pointed to a new pattern in Indian cricket over the last three to five years. He noted that beating India at home was once an extremely rare achievement, yet India have now suffered four home defeats in that period. He questioned what might be going wrong but clarified that he does not believe the Indian players have suddenly lost their ability to handle spin. Instead, he feels visiting teams now arrive with better preparation and a stronger understanding of Indian conditions.The pitch in the first Test started as a standard subcontinent surface that seemed good for batting across the first two days. However, the top layer began to peel off late on Day 1. It then turned into a difficult track for batters by Day 2. With the second Test set to begin on November 22, India will hope to bounce back and level the series.",South Africa beat India by 30 runs in the first Test in Kolkata.

India played poor cricket at the Eden Gardens | Don't blame the XI, players underperformed

India’s Test side is facing intense scrutiny once again after their defeat to South Africa. The loss has pushed earlier concerns back into focus, especially after the recent home whitewash against New Zealand. With a young captain and a new head coach still settling in, many feel the team must reassess its foundations and reconsider the expectations placed on this group.Former India batter Robin Uthappa has voiced similar concerns. He questioned whether the current squad has the consistency and depth to truly see themselves as World Test Championship contenders. Speaking on his YouTube channel, Uthappa said, “Visiting teams play lesser cricket than India and have far more time for preparation. There is too much cricket happening.”Uthappa believes India are trying to follow a single formula in every situation. He said, “You are going with one size fits all and trying to produce results. There needs to be a sense of realism about the goal for the next two years.” He urged Gautam Gambhir and Shubman Gill to clearly define their long term vision for the side.One of his biggest worries is India’s pace bowling depth outside the subcontinent. He asked, “Yes, you want to get to the WTC final, but is this team ready to get there? Who is really effective outside of Bumrah and Siraj? We are missing a third pacer.They are trying out a bunch of guys. In all honesty, we don't have a confirmed third fast bowler.”India have managed only four wins and have suffered three defeats in the current WTC cycle, a record that will not be enough if such performances continue. Uthappa also highlighted India’s struggle against SENA teams at home and said the lack of dedicated Test centres is a major reason. He said, “India don't have Test centres as a country. You are randomly playing Tests everywhere and trying to produce results in your favour. That takes away from the larger goal.”He added that teams with fixed Test venues enjoy a stronger home advantage. Recalling Virat Kohli ’s earlier stance on the same issue, Uthappa said, “Virat spoke of this when he also captained and India are missing home advantage by playing at random venues.”With the second Test against South Africa approaching in Guwahati, India must regroup quickly. A win is essential to level the series 1 1 and keep their World Test Championship campaign on track.",Former India batter Robin Uthappa has voiced similar concerns.

Inside Eden Debacle: How India missed many tricks during their shocking defeat

Australia will field two new faces in the opening Ashes Test in Perth as stand-in skipper Steve Smith confirmed that Jake Weatherald and Brendan Doggett will receive their Baggy Greens. The match begins on Friday and marks a rare moment for Australia, who last handed out multiple Test debuts in 2019.Smith said the selection group felt confident about the pair. “Doggett and Weatherald are going to make their debuts, which is really exciting,” he announced on Thursday. Weatherald joins Usman Khawaja at the top, becoming the sixth partner tried since David Warner’s retirement. His arrival at the top allows an in-form Marnus Labuschagne to reclaim his preferred number three slot after storming back into contention with five centuries in eight innings this season.Labuschagne’s return pushes Cameron Green to number six, with Travis Head at five and Smith himself at four. Green won the race for the all-rounder role ahead of Beau Webster.Doggett’s debut comes after Josh Hazlewood was sidelined with a hamstring strain. With Pat Cummins also unavailable as he recovers from a back problem, Scott Boland steps in to partner Doggett and Mitchell Starc. Nathan Lyon will play his 140th Test and needs two wickets to move past Glenn McGrath on the all-time chart.Lyon has been typically strong at home with 268 of his 562 wickets coming in Australia.Australia have dominated England at home for most of the century, but the last Ashes series ended 2-2 in 2023. England have not won an Ashes campaign in Australia since 2010-11. Ricky Ponting , speaking on The ICC Review, expects the series to be tighter than forecast. He believes England’s aggressive style means every match is likely to produce a result. “I don’t think there’ll be any draws, just the way that England play,” he said, tipping Australia to edge the series 3-2.Ponting stressed the importance of England’s openers. He feels Zak Crawley and Ben Duckett must attack early or Australia’s bowlers will rip into the middle order. “If the openers don’t get England off to a really good, solid, fast start, then the Australian bowlers could dominate,” Ponting noted.He also underlined the influence of Ben Stokes , calling the England captain “crucial” with both bat and ball. Stokes’ role becomes even bigger if England choose to go without a specialist spinner in Perth and Brisbane.On Australia’s side, Ponting expects Steve Smith to thrive as captain again. “I think his record as captain is better than it is as a player anyway,” he said, pointing out Smith’s average jumps to almost 69 when leading the side.Ponting named Mitchell Starc as his pick for leading wicket taker after Hazlewood was ruled out of the opening Test and backed Smith to finish as the leading run scorer.Australia XI: Jake Weatherald, Usman Khawaja, Marnus Labuschagne, Steve Smith (capt), Travis Head, Cameron Green, Alex Carey, Mitchell Starc, Nathan Lyon, Scott Boland, Brendan Doggett","Steve Smith confirms Jake Weatherald and Brendan Doggett will make debuts in the opening Ashes Test in Perth.

NEW DELHI: When India and South Africa players will take the field at Barsapara Stadium for the second Test of the series on Saturday, it will be a momentous occasion for the Guwahati venue. With play scheduled to start half an hour earlier than the traditional 9:30 am IST, Test cricket in India will mark its 28th different venue.In the process, Barsapara Stadium will join the likes of Eden Gardens (Kolkata), venue of the first Test, Arun Jaitley Stadium (New Delhi), MA Chidambaram Stadium (Chennai) and the lesser known University Ground (Lucknow), and Gandhi Stadium (Jalandhar).As BCCI's policy of rotating venues reaches its 19th different Test centre this century, it comes not long after Narendra Modi Stadium was sparely filled for the Test against the West Indies. And more closely on the heels of another pitch controversy and uncertainty going into the Barsapara Stadium.“Test centres is not about crowds alone. It is also about familiarity of conditions. If we are playing a Test in Guwahati or Ranchi, I am not against these venues as a possibility. But the problem in India is every surface has a different identity. There is literally no bounce in the Eastern part of the country. It becomes a very ordinary Test match pitch then,” said former India spinner R Ashwin on his YouTube show Ash ki Baat.“Make sure whichever Test centre you decide has the best pitches. Some venues are better than others only because the pitches are better and the team is used to conditions. That is home advantage. Otherwise the only point is you are playing within that Indian map as home, but is not home,” he had added.The call for having fixed Test centres is not new. Neither is the viewpoint of taking the game to different locations and popularising the traditional format.In 2019, Virat Kohli had stressed that fixed venues is not just suitable for the home teams but also the away teams in what they should expect from the crowd and surface.Meanwhile, Rohit Sharma, who succeeded Kohli as Test captain and retired earlier this year, said taking Test cricket to ""all parts of the country"" was the way forward.“We’ve been discussing this for a long time now, and in my opinion we should have five Test centres, period. I mean, I agree [with] state associations and rotation and giving games and all that, that is fine for T20 and one-day cricket, but Test cricket, teams coming to India should know, ‘we’re going to play at these five centres, these are the pitches we’re going to expect, these are the kind of people that will come to watch, crowds’,” Kohli had said.Ashwin concurred with Kohli's opinion from six years ago.“Eden Gardens, Guwahati – playing against South Africa there, should there be standard Test centres? Virat said years ago they must be fixed. I personally think it’s about time, why did we make Test centres? So more cricketers could emerge, and their associations would get more funding. But Guwahati as a Test match is not a home game for either team, and I don’t think anyone in the Indian team has played a first-class game in Guwahati,” said the retired veteran.The off-spinner used South Africa's Port Elizabeth to drive the point home. He mentioned how Proteas play their home Tests against India at the Centurion and Wanderers while keeping Port Elizabeth away from the calendar to take away India's advantage of playing the spin.""Should we have standard Test centres? They already exist in countries like Australia, England, and South Africa. These nations consistently use the same venues for Test cricket. In India, however, when you play in multiple Test centres, it doesn’t always feel like a home game for India,"" claimed Ashwin.The numbers back this claim. India have played at 27 different venues in their Test history while Australia (11), England (10) and reigning World Test Championships (WTC) champions South Africa (11) have largely stuck to fixed venues.Since 2000, India have played their Test cricket at new centres in the form of Jamtha, Nagpur (7 matches), Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium, Hyderabad (6), JSCA International Stadium Complex, Ranchi, Holkar Cricket Stadium, Indore, MCA Stadium, Pune, ACA-VDCA Cricket Stadium, Visakhapatnam and Niranjan Shah Stadium, Rajkot (3).At the same time, some of the stadiums of the yesteryears have been phased out. Nehru Stadium, Madras, Lal Bahadur Shastri Stadium, Hyderabad, Barabati Stadium, Cuttack, K.D.Singh 'Babu' Stadium, Lucknow, Gymkhana Ground, Mumbai, Sector 16 Stadium, Chandigarh, Sawai Mansingh Stadium, Jaipur, Gandhi Stadium, Jalandhar and University Ground, Lucknow have all not seen a match in this century.As far as the 'regular' Test centres are concerned, the fixtures are rotated between Eden Gardens, M Chinnaswamy Stadium, MA Chidambaram Stadium, Arun Jaitley Stadium and Wankhede Stadium. Brabourne Stadium in Mumbai and Green Park Stadium in Kanpur have seen reduction in matches allocated while the Narendra Modi Stadium has seen an uptick.When you look at the other members of the 'Big 3' - Australia and England - alongside South Africa, there is a summer of Test cricket and even the venues have a permanent fixture. Like in Australia, Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) hosts the Boxing Day Test.Then, for 43 years, the Ashes opener used to be held at The Gabba until the upcoming series would break from tradition and start at the Perth Stadium. It only came after a long-term agreement was signed with Cricket Australia (CA) that will ensure the first Test of the summer will be played in Perth.Compared to India's 27 different Test venues, Australia and South Africa have 11 venues each while England have 10. Broken down further, as against India's 18 different venues this century, Australia have 10, England 9 and South Africa 8.Of those 10 Australian venues, five have been barely used - the newly constructed Hobart (9), Perth Stadium (5), Cairns, Darwin (2) and Manuka Oval (1). The remaining five have been used for the most part - SCG (27), MCG, Adelaide Oval, The Gabba (24) followed by WACA, Perth (16).Same holds true for England and South Africa where most of the Test cricket is restricted to five or six venues. In England that means Lord's (47), The Oval (24), Edgbaston (21), Old Trafford, Headingley, Trent Bridge (20) as traditional venues. Chester-le Street, Rose Bowl and Sophia Gardens have seen little activity in five-day matches.Meanwhile, in South Africa, it means Newlands (29), Centurion (25), Wanderers (22), Kingsmead (18) and Port Elizabeth (14) as the traditional fixtures. At the same time, Bloemfontein, Senwes Park and Buffalo Park have not hosted a five-day affair since 2017.Back in India, Barsapara Stadium’s debut as India’s 28th Test venue highlights the challenge between expanding the game and maintaining consistent, high-quality conditions while sustaining home advantage.",Barsapara Stadium in Guwahati will host the second Test between India and South Africa starting November 22. The venue will be India's 19th different Test centre this century.

The board is now trying to organise another assignment for the World Cup-winning team in the same period.The series, which included three ODIs and three T20Is, was part of the ICC Future Tours Programme and was expected to be played in Kolkata and Cuttack.""We will try to arrange an alternate series in December but details are still being worked out. As far as the series against Bangladesh is concerned, we didn't get a go ahead for it,"" a BCCI source was quoted as saying by PTI.The Bangladesh series would have been India’s first set of matches after winning the ICC ODI World Cup earlier this month.Although not confirmed directly, current diplomatic tensions between India and Bangladesh may have influenced the decision. A tribunal court in Bangladesh on Monday sentenced country's ousted former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to death for alleged crimes against humanity. The situation has led to incidents of violence and a decline in bilateral ties. The interim government in Dhaka has asked India to hand over Hasina, who is currently in exile in India after leaving Bangladesh.""We (BCB) have received a letter from the BCCI regarding the cancellation of the series, and now we are waiting to hear new dates or details,"" a Bangladesh Cricket Board official told PTI.Earlier this year, the BCCI postponed the men’s white-ball tour of Bangladesh to September 2026, following unrest that led to the fall of the Hasina-led government.The Indian women’s team will now wait for a new opponent in December before players join their respective franchises for the next Women’s Premier League (WPL).

FIFA Shuts Down Trump's 2026 World Cup 'Unsafe Cities' Threat With Bold Remark

Poll Do you think Curacao's qualification for the World Cup will inspire other small nations in football? Yes, definitely! Possibly, but it depends on circumstances. Not really, it's a unique case. No, small nations face too many challenges.

In one of the most extraordinary nights in CONCACAF football history, the tiny Caribbean island of Curacao — home to just 156,000 people — scripted an unprecedented chapter by becoming the smallest country ever to qualify for the FIFA World Cup . Their tense 0-0 draw against Jamaica in Kingston on Tuesday was enough to secure passage to the 2026 finals in the United States, Canada and Mexico.The result capped a dramatic, nerve-wracking finale to the qualifiers, where Curacao survived relentless pressure from Jamaica — who struck the woodwork three times in the second half — and escaped a last-minute penalty scare. Salvadoran referee Ivan Barton initially pointed to the spot after Jeremy Antonisse clipped Dujuan Richards inside the box, but VAR overturned the call in a stunning twist that preserved Curacao’s historic dream.Coached by veteran Dutch tactician Dick Advocaat, who missed the clash due to a family emergency, the ‘Blue Wave’ finished atop Group B with 12 points from six matches, one clear of Jamaica. Curacao now surpass Iceland (population ~350,000 in 2018) as the smallest nation to ever reach a World Cup — a milestone made possible in the first edition featuring 48 teams.Elsewhere, the night produced more fairytale scenes. Haiti, forced to play “home” matches in Curacao due to political unrest, sealed their first World Cup appearance since 1974 after a crucial 2-0 win over Nicaragua.Goals from Louicius Don Deedson and Ruben Providence, combined with Honduras’ goalless draw against Costa Rica, lifted Haiti to the top of Group C with 11 points.Meanwhile, Panama secured the final automatic CONCACAF berth with a dominant 3-0 win over El Salvador, extinguishing Suriname’s hopes despite their qualification for the playoffs.For Curacao, the smallest of football nations, a World Cup dream once thought impossible is now gloriously real — a landmark for the island, the Caribbean, and world football itself.","Smallest nation to qualify for the World Cup, Curacao, beats Costa Rica 1-0. First time in history that two nations have qualified for the same tournament. The first time that two teams from the same country have done so.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125426769,imgsize-106144,width-400,resizemode-4/curacao.jpg"

Inside Eden Debacle: How India missed many tricks during their shocking defeat

NEW DELHI: Team India's surprise decision to field Washington Sundar at the prestigious No. 3 position in the Kolkata Test has sparked a sharp debate, with former wicketkeeper-batter Dinesh Karthik openly questioning the logic behind the move. The slot, normally reserved for a specialist top-order batter, was vacated after Sai Sudharsan was dropped — but head coach Gautam Gambhir 's choice of replacement left many baffled.Sundar, known primarily as a bowling all-rounder, scored 29 and 31 across two innings. While these were among India's highest returns in a low-scoring Test, Karthik believes the experiment could carry long-term risks, particularly for Sundar's bowling — the discipline that earned him his Test cap.“Where is Washington Sundar, the Test player, being looked at? Is he a bowler who can bat? Now, if you are sending him at three, you are almost telling him that he needs to focus a lot more on batting,” Karthik said in a Cricbuzz video, underlining how drastically the role shift alters expectations.Karthik warned that the physical and mental load required to prepare for the No. 3 role could erode Sundar's primary skill. “The moment he starts spending those long hours batting in practice, you tend to reduce your practice for bowling because it is physically impossible to be good at both,” he cautioned.Calling the move “very tricky,” Karthik said Sundar's elevation feels like a stop-gap adjustment rather than a long-term vision.“So the message is very straightforward that we are looking at big runs from you. This could affect his bowling in the long run. It is a very tricky one,” he added.With Shubman Gill likely to miss the second Test due to a neck injury, India's top-order composition remains uncertain. All eyes will be on Gambhir to see whether Sundar is again assigned the most scrutinised batting position in Test cricket — or restored to the role that suits his strengths.","Dinesh Karthik questions India's decision to field Washington Sundar at No. 3 position in the Kolkata Test.

Ryan Ten Doeschate press conference: On India Playing XI, Dhruv Jurel, workload management and more

NEW DELHI: Ahead of the second Test of the two-match series against South Africa in Guwahati, India batters Sai Sudharsan and Dhruv Jurel trained with only one pad during an optional session at Kolkata's Eden Gardens on Monday, using an old method meant to handle spin and improve footwork.Both faced spinners for nearly three hours while exposing one leg, a routine that carries some risk but is used to force batters to play with the bat rather than rely on pad defence.Sudharsan, a left-hander, took off his right pad to make a longer front-foot stride. He did not play the Eden Test, and his place in the Guwahati Test is uncertain. Batting against left-arm spinners and off-spinners without the front pad meant he had to avoid blows on the shin or any exposed area that could cause injury. Coaches have long used this drill to stop batters from falling into front-pad reflexes that often result in front-foot leg-before positions. Without the pad, the batter must use the bat as the first option.The method is meant to push them to step out and smother the turn.Meanwhile, Dhruv Jurel trained without his right pad while practising the reverse sweep on a centre strip. For a right-hander, the shot requires a large stride forward with the right leg, and removing the pad helps correct movement while limiting injury risk.Head coach Gautam Gambhir observed Sudharsan closely during the session. Sudharsan is in contention to replace Shubman Gill, who may miss the second Test because of a neck spasm.Only six players attended the optional session. Ravindra Jadeja, the senior-most member present, batted for the longest period.The second and final Test of the series will be played from November 22 at Barsapara Stadium in Guwahati. The visitors, the reigning World Test Championship winners, won the first Test in Kolkata by 30 runs inside three days after defending 123, their first Test win in India in 15 years. The result gave them a 1-0 lead in the two-match series.They will now attempt to secure a series win in the Guwahati Test.",Sai Sudharsan and Dhruv Jurel trained with only one pad during an optional session at Kolkata's Eden Gardens on Monday.

South Africa are on the brink of a landmark Test series triumph in India after their 30-run win in the opening Test of the two-match contest. A draw in the upcoming second Test in Guwahati would be enough for Temba Bavuma 's side to seal the series. Their preparations, however, have been unsettled by an unexpected injury scare.As per a News18 report, Player of the Match Simon Harmer is dealing with a shoulder issue and left-arm pacer Marco Jansen is also nursing a niggle. Both players underwent medical tests on Tuesday at Woodlands Hospital in Kolkata, the same facility that treated Shubman Gill’s neck problem.The visitors have surged to second in the ICC World Test Championship standings for the 2025-27 cycle after their remarkable victory at Eden Gardens. The win, their first Test success in India since 2010, lifted them from fourth place to a PCT of 66.67, placing them just behind table-toppers Australia. Sri Lanka have slipped to third and India have fallen to fourth with a PCT of 54.17.Bavuma’s unbeaten 55 on a sharply turning surface and Harmer’s outstanding eight wickets across the match were central to South Africa taking a 1-0 lead. India, without regular captain Shubman Gill, stumbled while chasing 124 and folded for 93.Harmer backed up his 4-30 in the first innings with 4-21 in the second, while Keshav Maharaj struck twice and Marco Jansen removed both Indian openers to put the home side under serious pressure.Washington Sundar and Axar Patel tried to keep India afloat, with Sundar scoring 31 before falling to Aiden Markram and Patel’s brisk 26 ending against Maharaj.

'When you don't play well, this is what happens': Gautam Gambhir reacts to 1st Test defeat, points out what India lacked

India’s dominance in home Tests has started to slip over the past year, raising serious questions about their approach to pitch preparation. What once felt like an almost impenetrable fortress is now beginning to show cracks, with visiting teams finding ways to challenge and even defeat India on surfaces designed to take turn from the opening day. After India’s 30-run defeat to South Africa at Eden Gardens, Australia women’s captain Alyssa Healy has openly questioned why India continue to prepare sharply turning wickets that even their own batters are failing to handle.Speaking on the Willow Talk Cricket podcast, Healy said she is baffled by India’s strategy. She pointed out that facing spin has become a challenge worldwide, regardless of where batters are raised, and suggested that India are only making things tougher for themselves. According to her, India suffered a similar fate against New Zealand last year under comparable conditions. She believes flatter pitches would help India avoid repeat collapses.“I just don’t know what they’re doing to themselves. Batting against spin is not an easy thing around the world at the moment, even if you grow up on those wickets. They keep giving themselves turning wickets, thinking it’s going to help them, and it hasn’t.New Zealand beat them at home doing that. So, build yourself some flat wickets and let them go,” Healy said.Her comments come while head coach Gautam Gambhir continues to defend the Kolkata surface, saying it matched exactly what he had requested. Gambhir has repeatedly stressed that India’s batters need to show better technique and patience against spin. But Healy feels the players themselves are not enjoying such conditions. She also believes India’s spinners have greater impact on pitches that offer moderate assistance, allowing them to attack the stumps rather than rely on excessive turn.“I think their spinners are actually more effective on wickets that don’t do as much and their batters enjoy that as well. If that’s what they asked for I don’t understand it because it actually brings the opposition back into the attack. When you think about Jadeja, Kuldeep Yadav , Washington Sundar and Axar Patel , they were effective attacking the stumps and when the ball turns too much it goes out of their wheelhouse a little bit. They’re losing Test matches at home which is a really bizarre thing for India to do. They’re going to have to look at it and think about better wickets,” she added.Since Gambhir’s arrival, India have dropped four of their six home Tests, with their only series win coming against a struggling West Indies side. With the second Test against South Africa beginning on November 22 in Guwahati, India will be desperate to prevent their first home series loss to the Proteas since 2000.",India's dominance in home Tests has started to slip over the past year.

India cricketers spotted chilling Hobart ahead of T20I vs Australia

Poll Do you think Babar Azam's recent performance will affect his position in the team? Yes, definitely No, he will bounce back Maybe, depends on future games

NEW DELHI: Babar Azam ’s long-awaited return to three-figure form was supposed to mark the beginning of a resurgence. Instead, within days of breaking an 807-day and 83-innings century drought, the Pakistan superstar has been plunged into a new cycle of scrutiny — fined by the ICC for a conduct breach and dismissed for a duck in the T20I tri-series opener against Zimbabwe in Rawalpindi on Tuesday.The emotional swing was stark. The same week he celebrated a cathartic century against Sri Lanka, Babar walked out against Zimbabwe needing stability at No.3, only to be trapped LBW for a three-ball duck by Brad Evans. It continued a worrying pattern: this was Babar’s third duck in his last six T20Is, and it also pushed him past Shahid Afridi for the most ducks by a Pakistan batter in T20Is (nine).Adding to the turbulence, the ICC announced earlier that Babar had been fined 10% of his match fee for “abuse of cricket equipment” after striking the stumps with his bat upon dismissal in the third ODI vs Sri Lanka. It was his first offence in 24 months, drawing a demerit point.The irony is hard to miss. Babar’s triumphant century last week — his 20th in ODIs — was meant to silence critics after nearly two years of questions over form and leadership.Instead, the 31-year-old now finds himself navigating fresh headlines that once again question his trajectory.Former PCB chairman Ramiz Raja, who met Babar recently, revealed the batter’s private frustration with relentless scrutiny. “I met him in a cafe and he expressed his frustration at the way he had to face criticism, personal comments over his place in the team and his performances,” Ramiz said on his YouTube channel. His advice was clear: “Be patient and show restraint… your only job is to perform on the field.”Ramiz said he was “very happy” to see Babar back among the runs and insisted that strike-rate debates should not cloud his game. “He has all the shots… he just needs to bat longer.”For Pakistan, though, the concern is immediate: after a much-needed high, their premier batter is suddenly back under the microscope — again.",Babar Azam has been plunged into a new cycle of scrutiny.

Shubman Gill Press Conference: Team India captain opens up about India’s bowling plan for SA Test

Poll Will South Africa secure their first Test series victory in India since 2000? Yes, they will win No, India will prevail

NEW DELHI: South Africa stand on the brink of history as they head into the second Test against India in Guwahati on Saturday, aiming for their first series victory on Indian soil in 25 years. Temba Bavuma’s men stunned the hosts with a gritty, low-scoring triumph at Kolkata’s Eden Gardens, extending a remarkable run that began with their World Test Championship win in June.Their Kolkata triumph — South Africa’s first Test win in India since 2010 — has set up a golden opportunity. The Proteas last won a Test series in India in 2000 under Hansie Cronje, and now they are one step away from ending a drought that has spanned generations.Coach Shukri Conrad underlined the significance of the Eden victory, calling it “right up there” with their WTC final win. “Coming to India, playing at Eden Gardens, doing something we haven't done for 15 years… we never give up,” he said, praising the team’s resilience on a treacherous turning surface.Bavuma led from the front with a fighting unbeaten 55 — remarkably, the only fifty of the match — as South Africa held their nerve in a chaotic contest dominated by spin and inconsistent bounce.Their bowlers, spearheaded by Simon Harmer’s eight-wicket match haul, dismantled an Indian batting lineup that crumbled to 93 all out in pursuit of 124.South Africa have bolstered their squad with Lungi Ngidi, while Kagiso Rabada remains doubtful with a rib injury. His absence didn’t hurt the visitors in Kolkata, and the Proteas will be confident heading into the series finale.India, meanwhile, are grappling with mounting questions — and injuries. Captain Shubman Gill, who suffered neck spasms during the first Test and spent a night in hospital, travelled with the team but is unlikely to play, with vice-captain Rishabh Pant expected to lead. The defeat was India’s fourth at home in six Tests, intensifying scrutiny on the surfaces and on new head coach Gautam Gambhir.Former captain Sourav Ganguly criticised the turning track at Eden Gardens, insisting India must “play on much better wickets”. With legends Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma already retired from Tests, and Gill still finding his footing as captain, India face a stern test of character.Guwahati, hosting its maiden Test, will begin play at 9:00 am due to early sunsets, with tea scheduled before lunch — a rare twist in a clash that could reshape the rivalry’s history.","South Africa are on the brink of achieving their first Test series win in India in over two decade and a half.

Ben Stokes press conference: On handshake controversy, India fightback, his own fitness

Former Australia captain Ricky Ponting said England’s use of Bazball over the past three years has been designed ""only"" for this Ashes series.Ponting said England are unlikely to change their top-order because the batting group has been built for the fast, attacking style they have followed under coach Brendon McCullum and captain Ben Stokes England have arrived in Australia with the tag of being an ""aggressive"" Test side. They plan to score at high rates with unconventional shots, a method they have used since McCullum took charge in 2022.The approach has brought mixed results, but England have stayed with it as part of a three-year plan leading into this tour of Australia.Ponting told 7NEWS that England’s attacking method under McCullum and Stokes has always been shaped for Australian conditions, even if it has been presented as a long-term shift.""They're a side that have been together for two years (since the 2023 Ashes) building up to this,"" Ponting told 7NEWS. ""Bazball, as far as I'm concerned, and I know Brendon reasonably well, was only designed for this one series.""He added, ""It’s been about trying to find a group of players and a style and method that’s going to stand up and potentially win an Ashes series in Australia.""Ponting compared the approach to England’s preparation before the 2019 ODI World Cup.""Wind the clock back, when England won the (50-over) World Cup under Eoin Morgan in 2019, it was exactly the same theory they had then.""""They picked a group of guys that they had kept together for two years. It didn’t matter how they performed in the games leading up, it was all about being ready and confident for the World Cup and that’s what they’ve done with this squad,"" Ponting said.He also said England are expected to persist with Ollie Pope at No. 3.""There’s been talk every series about Ollie Pope at No. 3 and do we stick with him? Do we axe him and bring Jacob Bethell in? But they’ve stuck with what they’ve got now. I’ll be surprised even if he (Pope) doesn’t start well if they make any changes through this series to their top-order batting.""Ponting said England face a difficult task in Australia.""They’ve only done it (won a Test in Australia) four times in the past 25 years, and they’re going to need to do it at least three times this summer, so I can’t wait to see how they play,"" he said.England on Wednesday named their 12-man squad for the first Test, which begins on November 21 in Perth.","Former Australia captain Ricky Ponting says England's use of Bazball has been designed ""only"" for this Ashes series.

Inside Eden Debacle: How India missed many tricks during their shocking defeat

Poll Do you think Shubman Gill will be able to participate in the 2nd Test against South Africa? Yes, he will play. No, he won't make it.

India captain Shubman Gill reached Guwahati with the rest of the squad on Wednesday, offering a small but encouraging sign of recovery as he stepped out without the neck brace he had been wearing since the Kolkata Test.A short video of his arrival quickly circulated on social media, with fans noting the absence of support gear and hoping it indicates progress in his recovery.Gill had suffered a neck injury on Day 2 of the first Test against South Africa and was taken to hospital after experiencing increased discomfort. He was discharged the next day, as India slipped to a 30-run defeat at Eden Gardens.Before the Guwahati footage emerged, Gill was last spotted leaving the medical facility in Kolkata, still braced and moving cautiously. His improvement since then has been steady, according to the BCCI, which confirmed he would travel with the team while continuing treatment.In its statement, the board said, “Shubman has been responding well to the medical treatment provided and will travel to Guwahati with the team on 19th November, 2025. He will continue to be monitored by the BCCI medical team, and a decision on his participation in the 2nd Test will be taken accordingly.”With the second Test beginning on November 22, the management is prepared to take a late call, possibly as late as the eve of the match. The selectors have already drafted in Nitish Kumar Reddy ahead of schedule to ensure enough cover. The team also has Sai Sudharsan and Devdutt Padikkal available after both sat out in Kolkata.Guwahati, hosting its first-ever Test, is expected to offer turn and bounce on a red-soil surface, which are conditions in which Gill’s presence, particularly as a right-hander among several left-handed batters, could be crucial.",India captain Shubman Gill arrives in Guwahati ahead of 2nd Test against South Africa.

Zimbabwe captain Sikandar Raza gave a direct response to a question he felt was unrelated during a press conference in Rawalpindi, Pakistan, ahead of the T20I tri-series also featuring Pakistan and Sri Lanka. His exchange with a Pakistani reporter has spread widely on social media.Raza was speaking to the media a day before the opening match of the tournament between Pakistan and Zimbabwe. During the interaction, a reporter tried to involve him in an online debate by asking him to rank the best T20 teams in Asia and whether Zimbabwe were facing the first, second or third-best Asian side in the tri-series.The exchange went as follows:""There is a debate going on social media. I need an honest opinion from you. Who is the second-best and best T20 team in Asia? From Sikandar’s point of view, is Zimbabwe playing the second-best or the third-best Asian teams in this tri-series,"" the reporter asked.Raza replied, ""Since I am in a national jersey, all I will tell you is that Zimbabwe is the second-best team in Africa. I don’t care who the first or second-best team in Asia is. I'll address that when I am not in national jersey. Right now, my focus is on my team.This is a press conference for a Zimbabwe captain, so I should answer questions about Zimbabwe. I personally don’t care who the first, second, third or fourth-best team in Asia. We’re the second-best team in Africa, and we’re looking to build on that. We’re trying to challenge the best team in Africa, which is South Africa.""Raza also reacted to a question about whether Zimbabwe reaching the final of the tri-series would be seen as an upset.“It might be an upset for you. I can read the room. Maybe you people are not giving us too much of a chance,” he said.Pakistan secured a hard-fought five-wicket victory over Zimbabwe in the opening match of the T20I Tri-Series at the Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium, but not before they faced scares in both innings.Pakistan, chasing a modest 148, were put under pressure on multiple occasions but key contributions from Fakhar Zaman (44), Usman Khan (37*) and Mohammad Nawaz (21) made sure that the hosts got over the line with four balls remaining.","Zimbabwe captain Sikandar Raza gives direct response to a question he felt was unrelated during a press conference in Rawalpindi, Pakistan.

Poll Is the influence of T20 cricket negatively impacting the Indian batting side in Tests? Definitely Not really No

Former India fast bowler Balwinder Singh Sandhu has questioned the current batting group’s preparation standards following India’s 30-run defeat to South Africa in the Kolkata Test. The 69-year-old said the fourth-innings collapse, while chasing 124, highlighted issues that go beyond the pitch.He argued that the batters struggled to trust their defence under pressure. “Losing to South Africa’s two spinners while chasing only 120 on the third day is beyond shocking. To me, the moment batsmen see close-in fielders, the pressure gets to them. They’re not used to that intensity anymore because T20 cricket doesn’t challenge your defence the same way,” Sandhu wrote in his Mid-day column.He linked the problem to limited exposure to domestic cricket, suggesting it has affected players’ ability to handle tougher conditions. As an example, he recalled Sachin Tendulkar’s preparation for the 1990 England tour. “Before the 1990 England tour, Sachin Tendulkar called me to the RCF ground because the pitch had grass and bounce. I brought seven or eight pacers. He batted for two hours every single day. That’s hunger.That’s preparation,” he said.Sandhu questioned why similar commitment is not visible today. “Why can’t today’s players show even half that attitude?” he asked.India had taken a 30-run lead in the first innings after bowling South Africa out for 159, but a gritty 55 from Temba Bavuma pushed the visitors’ second-innings total to what proved to be a defendable margin.No batter from either side crossed fifty apart from the Proteas captain.Sandhu also criticised Team India management, saying the same errors keep resurfacing.“Are we not learning from past mistakes? New Zealand thrashed us in our own backyard not long ago. Yet we repeat the same errors. It clearly shows a poor understanding of our current players’ abilities,” he wrote.He said the responsibility lies with the coaching staff. “For a head coach and batting coach, that’s unacceptable. Being a coach myself, I feel any coach, who has been around for years, should know his team’s strengths, weaknesses, and mindset inside out,” Sandhu added.He questioned the flawed manner in which the side has looked at the question of succession.“We still don’t know who is ready to step into the shoes of Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli, who, I feel, were moved out too quickly. Youngsters should be groomed around seniors, not at the cost of them,” he wrote.India now wait on Shubman Gill’s fitness ahead of the second Test in Guwahati after the captain picked up a neck spasm in Kolkata.","Former India fast bowler Balwinder Singh Sandhu has questioned the current batting group’s preparation standards.

Kieran Tierney and Kenny McLean scored spectacular injury-time goals to give Scotland a dramatic 4-2 victory over Denmark on Tuesday, sealing their qualification for the 2026 World Cup.

Belgium joined them with a 7-0 demolition of Liechtenstein, while Switzerland and Austria both secured their places after picking up draws. All five nations will feature at the tournament in the United States, Canada and Mexico next year.Scotland’s late surge in Glasgow ensured Steve Clarke’s team reached the World Cup for the first time since 1998. With the match tied at 2-2 beyond the 90th minute, Denmark were on course to progress as Group C winners until Tierney curled in a superb long-range strike three minutes into stoppage time. McLean settled the contest deep into added time, lofting the ball over Kasper Schmeichel from the halfway line in the 98th minute after spotting the Danish goalkeeper far off his line.“That just sums up this squad,” captain Andy Robertson told the BBC. “Never say die. We just keep going right to the end and one of the craziest games. We put the country through it, but I’m sure it’s worth it. We’re going to the World Cup.”Scotland made the perfect start when Scott McTominay scored with an overhead kick in the third minute.Rasmus Hojlund equalised for Denmark from the penalty spot just before the hour, but the visitors were reduced to 10 men soon after when Rasmus Kristensen received a second yellow card. Hampden Park erupted again in the 78th minute as Lawrence Shankland tapped in from close range, only for Patrick Dorgu to level four minutes later. Tierney and McLean then delivered the decisive blows. Denmark now head to Thursday’s draw for the European play-offs, scheduled for March.Switzerland booked their sixth straight World Cup appearance after a 1-1 draw in Pristina against Kosovo. Needing only to avoid a heavy defeat, they stayed in control for most of the match. Ruben Vargas put them ahead early in the second half, before Florent Muslija equalised.Spain, the Euro 2024 champions, also needed to avoid a seven-goal loss in Seville against Turkey and never looked in danger. Dani Olmo opened the scoring, though Deniz Gul and Salih Ozcan found the net for Turkey to hand Spain their first goals conceded in qualifying. Mikel Oyarzabal equalised after the hour to preserve Spain’s unbeaten run. “We wanted to finish with a win and a clean sheet, so it’s bitter-sweet... but we’re happy to qualify for the World Cup,” Olmo told TVE.Austria snatched a place at their first World Cup in 28 years after a 1-1 draw with Bosnia and Herzegovina, thanks to Michael Gregoritsch’s 77th-minute equaliser. Haris Tabakovic’s early strike had threatened to upset Ralf Rangnick’s side before the leveller sent Bosnia into the play-offs. “I can’t believe it; we made it!

A Women's Super League referee Lisa Benn told a London employment tribunal that she lost her international position after reporting that a referee coach pushed her during a game in March 2023. She claimed the Professional Game Match Officials Limited (PGMOL) gave her lower recommendations after she complained about coach Steve Child's conduct, BBC reported.The incident occurred at a PGMOL tournament focused on video assistant referee (VAR) training. After a delay due to an injury, Benn says Child grabbed her arm and pushed her onto the pitch to start a game.During the match, Child told a fourth official to instruct Benn to ""kill the game."" Benn responded by saying ""don't tell me how to referee"" and used an expletive towards Child.""I am a trusted referee, I referee at the highest level - this was an under-19s game,"" Benn told the panel.""He felt superior, he felt like he could come on and tell me how to referee, he manhandled me on to the field of play - he would never have done that to a male referee,"" she stated.When questioned if she had witnessed Child behaving similarly with other referees, Benn responded: ""I have to female referees, yes.I haven't to male referees.""Benn claims Child approached her after the game, grabbed her arm and said ""your card has been marked.""""He was so angry his eyes were bulging out of his head,"" she told the tribunal, as cited by BBC.PGMOL's representative Jesse Crozier suggested Child may have simply guided her to the pitch, but Benn rejected this explanation.Crozier stated: ""If you had been dragged, grabbed and pushed at a training tournament with dozens and dozens of people, someone would have seen it."" Benn disagreed with this assessment.A PGMOL investigation determined Child's actions did not warrant disciplinary measures. Benn claims that while PGMOL's chief refereeing officer Howard Webb and his wife Bibiana Steinhaus-Webb, then head of women's referees, assured her she would not face consequences for reporting the incident, the organization subsequently reduced their support for her.Benn states this reduced support resulted in her losing a position on FIFA's international referee list.The tribunal proceedings are ongoing.",Lisa Benn told a London employment tribunal that she lost her international position after reporting that a referee coach pushed her during a game in March 2023.

Poll Who do you think is in the right in the PSG vs Kylian Mbappe feud? Kylian Mbappe Paris Saint-Germain Both sides equally Neither side is right

The long-simmering feud between Paris Saint-Germain and Kylian Mbappe erupted into a full-blown legal and financial battle on Monday as both sides arrived at an industrial court with staggering monetary demands — together exceeding €700 million.The French superstar, who joined Real Madrid on a free transfer in the summer of 2024, claims PSG owes him more than €260 million. This includes unpaid wages, bonuses, severance, and damages, all stemming from his argument that his fixed-term contract should be reclassified as a permanent one — a technical shift that would entitle him to compensation for unfair dismissal.Mbappe had earlier demanded €55 million in unpaid wages. His new claim now encompasses much more, including allegations of moral harassment, undeclared work, and breaches of PSG's duty of good faith and workplace safety.“Kylian Mbappe is not asking for anything beyond what the law provides; he is simply seeking the enforcement of his legal rights, as any employee would,” his advisers said in a statement. The forward did not attend the hearing in person.PSG responded with an even larger counter-claim: €440 million. The club argues that Mbappe's refusal to extend his contract — while also rejecting a €300 million offer from Saudi side Al-Hilal in 2023 — cost them a massive “loss of opportunity” to secure a record transfer fee. The Ligue 1 champions also seek compensation for alleged breaches of good faith, reputational harm, and image damage.The club said it presented evidence that Mbappe acted “disloyally” by hiding his decision not to extend his contract for nearly a year — from July 2022 to June 2023 — leaving PSG powerless to negotiate a transfer.PSG further accused the striker of reneging on an August 2023 agreement involving a salary reduction should he leave on a free transfer. Mbappe's camp insists such an agreement never existed, and says PSG failed to provide proof.The forward has also accused the club of “lofting” — a French term describing the isolation of a player from the main squad. Mbappe was excluded from the preseason tour to Japan and South Korea and initially left out of Ligue 1's opening match after informing the club he would not trigger his extension clause.PSG has denied any harassment or mistreatment, insisting Mbappe featured in “more than 94%” of official matches that season under a coach who went on to win the Champions League.The court's ruling is expected next month, with both sides bracing for one of football's most financially explosive verdicts.","Kylian Mbappe claims PSG owes him more than €260 million.

Poll Which team do you believe has the best chance of winning the World Cup in 2026? Germany Netherlands France Brazil

Germany and the Netherlands sealed their World Cup berths in emphatic fashion on Monday, producing goal-laden performances in their final European qualifying matches to underline their status as major contenders for next year’s global showpiece in the United States, Canada and Mexico.Julian Nagelsmann’s Germany destroyed Slovakia 6-0 in Leipzig, while Ronald Koeman’s Netherlands swept past Lithuania 4-0 in Amsterdam. Both teams needed only a draw to secure qualification but showed zero appetite for caution.“Every player played well today and worked like a dog,” Nagelsmann told German broadcaster ZDF after his side overwhelmed Group A rivals. Four-time world champions Germany, level on points with Slovakia before kick-off, seized command early. Nick Woltemade headed the opener in the 18th minute, and once Serge Gnabry doubled the lead, the hosts never looked back. Leroy Sane struck twice before half-time, with Ridle Baku and Assan Ouedraogo completing the rout after the break.“We’re relieved. It’s a great moment,” a jubilant Woltemade told ZDF. “I’m playing, I’m scoring goals and I’m hopefully playing at the World Cup.”Elsewhere in Group A, Northern Ireland beat Luxembourg 1-0 but remained third.However, their Nations League ranking guarantees them a place in March’s 16-team European play-offs.In Amsterdam, the Netherlands delivered a high-tempo masterclass that thrilled more than 50,000 fans. Lithuania were pinned deep from the start, with Tijani Reijnders finishing off a neat move initiated by Frenkie de Jong to open the scoring. A superb first-half display by goalkeeper Edvinas Gertmonas delayed the inevitable, but Cody Gakpo’s 58th-minute penalty unlocked the floodgates. Xavi Simons and Donyell Malen struck in quick succession as Koeman’s men cruised.Reijnders, who did not debut until after the 2022 Qatar World Cup, savoured the moment. “I watched it at home, on the couch, with my Oranje shirt on,” he said. “This time it’s going to be very different for me… I’m really looking forward to taking part for the first time.”In other matches, Croatia—already assured of Group L’s top spot—fought back to beat Montenegro 3-2, while the Czech Republic thrashed Gibraltar 6-0. Poland survived a scare in Malta, edging out a chaotic 3-2 encounter but finishing second in Group G behind the Dutch.","Germany and the Netherlands have clinched their World Cup berths.

When the top tier is finished, it will hold 105,000 spectators. As part of the reopening process, Barcelona allowed 23,000 fans to attend a training session earlier in November.The club is also waiting for UEFA approval to host Eintracht Frankfurt at Camp Nou on December 9 in the Champions League.At the start of this season, Barcelona had to play two matches at the 6,000-capacity Johan Cruyff Stadium after they did not receive the required safety permit for Camp Nou.Barcelona plan to install a roof on the new stadium in the summer of 2027, a year later than originally planned.","Barcelona will return to the rebuilt Camp Nou on November 22 for their La Liga match against Athletic Bilbao.

Allison Kuch’s surprised guesses reveal how shocking the fine truly was

Former Las Vegas Raiders defensive end Isaac Rochell and his wife Allison Kuch unintentionally delivered one of the week’s most striking reaction videos after she discovered the enormous $507,156 fine handed to Cincinnati Bengals star Ja’Marr Chase. The penalty, issued for spitting on Pittsburgh Steelers cornerback Jalen Ramsey, was revealed to Kuch during a casual Instagram video that quickly became a viral talking point. Her genuine confusion and disbelief reflected how unexpectedly large the fine was, even for people familiar with NFL discipline. The clip resonated with fans because it showcased an unfiltered, real-time reaction to a punishment that many already viewed as unusually severe.Rochell set the stage in the video by asking Kuch, “You know how much Ja'Marr Chase got fined?” before explaining, “Chase spit on somebody. Keep in mind, this is two grown men arguing and he spit on somebody.” Kuch immediately tried connecting it to real-world consequences and said, “I’m pretty sure that’s like a… Like if that happened down the street, you could get jail time, right? Isn’t that like harassment?” Her comparison underscored how the act felt more serious outside a football setting and helped the moment gain momentum online.Kuch began guessing modestly with $20,000 and $30,000, only for Rochell to keep urging her to “keep going.” She pushed upward to $40,000 and then $100,000, each time surprised that the number still wasn’t close. Her guesses eventually climbed to $150,000, $200,000, $300,000, $400,000 and even $500,000 as the disbelief on her face grew. When she joked, “That better be a good ball of spit,” Rochell added the punchline, “That better be a good hock to it,” moments before revealing, “He almost got fined $600,000. ”After the shock settled, Rochell brought up his own past fine to lighten the moment further. “My wife got mad at me because I got fined $5,000 for my socks,” he said, only for Kuch to correct him with, “$7,000.” The contrast between a sock fine and a half-million-dollar spitting penalty gave the clip an extra comedic edge. Fans quickly latched onto the couple’s playful dynamic, further boosting the video’s visibility.The NFL stated that Chase’s fine came from his weekly paycheck of $448,333 plus a bonus of $58,823. Officials reviewed footage from the Nov. 16 Bengals-Steelers game and confirmed that Chase spit at Ramsey during the fourth quarter. His one-game suspension for Week 12 was upheld by appeals officer Jordy Nelson following the review. The league’s ruling cemented the penalty as one of the most expensive fines levied for an on-field personal conduct violation this season.Also read: Ja’Marr Chase reportedly faces a $507K salary loss after suspension in a major setback for the Bengals","Cincinnati Bengals star Ja'Marr Chase was fined $507,156 for spitting on a player.

Why Gracie Hunt believes the NFL needs a different kind of halftime show

Gracie Hunt is once again stepping into the cultural conversation surrounding the NFL and this time, she’s making it clear she supports a major shift in the league’s entertainment approach. During an appearance on “The Will Cain Show,” the Kansas City Chiefs heiress shared her excitement for Turning Point USA’s upcoming “alternate” halftime show planned for the 2026 Super Bowl.Her comments arrive at a time when fans, players, and media are increasingly debating what the NFL’s biggest stage should represent. With Bad Bunny already confirmed as the official halftime headliner, a decision that sparked criticism in conservative circles, Hunt is putting her stamp on what she believes the league should prioritize: values, influence, and legacy.Gracie emphasized she is “most definitely” looking forward to the TPUSA-produced performance, praising CEO Erika Kirk for “creating a halftime show for America.” For Hunt, the conversation goes far beyond music. She stressed that young viewers are “impressionable” and benefit from having “someone to look up to,” suggesting that entertainment should reflect role models rather than trends.Hunt also invoked the legacy of her grandfather, Lamar Hunt, the NFL visionary who coined the term “Super Bowl.”According to her, Lamar believed the league shouldn’t “rely on cheap appeal” to fuel interest in major events. Gracie positioned the debate as one about identity: what the NFL wants to stand for, and who it aims to inspire.She went on to name artists she’d like to see take the halftime stage in the future, highlighting Jason Aldean and Taylor Swift, an interesting combination, especially considering Swift’s sometimes polarizing reception among parts of the NFL fanbase. Still, Gracie’s picks underscore her view that the halftime show should blend mainstream appeal with cultural grounding.As the 2026 Super Bowl approaches, the competing visions for its entertainment, Bad Bunny’s global flair vs. TPUSA’s patriotic-focused alternative highlights a growing split in how fans interpret the league’s cultural role. And with Gracie Hunt weighing in, the discussion is only gaining momentum, ensuring this year’s halftime buzz will be about much more than the music.Also Read: Gracie Hunt drops a major personal update as she teases her upcoming appearance on The Will Cain Show, leaving fans buzzing about what’s next","Kansas City Chiefs heiress Gracie Hunt expressed support for Turning Point USA's ""alternate"" 2026 Super Bowl halftime show.

Why did Rosalía walk away from the NFL’s major Bernabéu showcase despite being one of their top choices for the event?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/why-did-rosala-walk-away-from-the-nfls-major-bernabu-showcase-despite-being-one-of-their-top-choices-for-the-event/articleshow/125450015.cms,"Madrid's NFL debut saw Daddy Yankee electrify the crowd, but global star Rosalía was initially eyed for the performance. Negotiations reportedly stalled as her production demands mirrored a Super Bowl, exceeding the scope of the international game. Despite the setback, the NFL remains keen on future collaborations with the artist, highlighting their push for cultural integration.

Why Rosalía and the NFL couldn’t find common ground on a Bernabéu performance

On a weekend when Madrid felt like the center of the sports and entertainment world, one of the biggest behind-the-scenes stories wasn’t on the field, it was about who didn’t take the stage. As the Miami Dolphins and Washington Commanders lit up the Santiago Bernabéu for the NFL ’s landmark game in Spain, fans were treated to a high-energy performance from Daddy Yankee.But according to Spanish radio host Jose Antonio Ponseti, the league had originally hoped to bring in another global superstar: Rosalía. The Catalan icon, fresh off the success of her album Lux, was reportedly approached for the event but ultimately backed out after discussions with the NFL fell apart.According to Ponseti’s report on SER, Rosalía’s involvement ended the moment her team laid out what she wanted for the show. “They offered her the show, but when she talked to them and told them what she wanted…” he explained, noting that the NFL quickly realized her demands matched those of a Super Bowl-level production, not a single international showcase game.While Ponseti didn’t confirm whether money was the sticking point, the implication was clear: the league felt her expectations exceeded the scope of the Madrid event.Still, insiders say the failed negotiations don’t signal a permanent rift. Rather, they suggest Rosalía’s artistic standards and her global influence remain sky-high. Event organizers reportedly still consider her a top choice for future NFL productions, especially as the league continues expanding its international footprint. Ponseti even hinted that a collaboration might not be far off, calling the prospect “a bombshell” if it comes together.For now, Daddy Yankee’s explosive mini-concert carried the night, but Rosalía’s absence created its own intrigue. The NFL’s interest in her underscores how aggressively the league is pursuing cultural crossover moments, especially in major European markets.And if the two sides eventually strike the right deal, Rosalía could deliver exactly the kind of spectacle the NFL wants as it continues turning regular-season games into global entertainment events.Also Read: Joe Alwyn’s GQ moment sparks debate over whether he’s redefining himself beyond Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce","Rosalía was reportedly approached for the NFL's Madrid debut.

However, reports quickly confirmed Sumrall removed himself from consideration, opting to remain with the Green Wave. This decision highlights Tulane's significant progress under his leadership and suggests a long-term vision for the program, while Florida continues its search.

Why Jon Sumrall stepped away from Florida’s pursuit and how it strengthens Tulane’s trajectory

Tulane head coach Jon Sumrall may have been linked to one of the biggest job openings of the offseason, but within hours of reports surfacing, the storyline took a sharp turn. Florida, fresh off launching a high-profile coaching search, was believed to be preparing to meet with Sumrall as they evaluate candidates to replace their outgoing head coach.The buzz grew quickly, fueled by a tweet from Gators Online reporter Zach Abolverdi. But by late afternoon, the narrative flipped: Sumrall was not interviewing for the job and had officially removed himself from consideration. The sudden shift has now raised questions about Florida’s direction, Tulane’s rising profile, and Sumrall’s long-term vision for the Green Wave.The initial momentum around Sumrall’s candidacy came from Abolverdi’s announcement on X: “BREAKING: Florida to meet with Tulane coach Jon Sumrall about the Gators job.” That message sparked immediate reaction across the college football world. Yet, not long after, a follow-up update landed. Citing Pete Nakos, Abolverdi posted, “UPDATE: UF’s scheduled meeting with Jon Sumrall has been called off and Sumrall is removing his name from the mix in Florida’s coaching search. ”For Tulane supporters, the news may have brought instant relief. Sumrall has transformed the program into a legitimate Group of Five contender in only two seasons, guiding the Green Wave to a 17-7 overall record and an impressive 12-2 mark in conference play.With Tulane sitting at 8-2 this season and pacing the American Athletic Conference, Sumrall’s leadership has become one of the program’s greatest assets. Tulane is currently positioned as the frontrunner among Group of Five teams to secure a coveted College Football Playoff spot.Florida, meanwhile, now turns its attention to other high-profile options, including Ole Miss head coach Lane Kiffin. The Gators’ aggressive search underscores the pressure to stabilize the program after consecutive up-and-down seasons.Sumrall’s decision to stay put sends a message about Tulane’s momentum and his confidence in what the program can achieve. At a time when many coaches jump quickly for high-dollar SEC opportunities, Sumrall choosing stability signals that the Green Wave may be building something far bigger than a temporary surge.Also Read: Justin Tucker to the 49ers?

Justin Tucker to the 49ers? Kyle Shanahan finally addresses the speculation after Eddy Piñeiro’s injury shakes up San Francisco,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/justin-tucker-to-the-49ers-kyle-shanahan-finally-addresses-the-speculation-after-eddy-pieiros-injury-shakes-up-san-francisco/articleshow/125437624.cms,"The San Francisco 49ers are facing a kicker crisis after Eddy Piñeiro sustained a hamstring injury. Coach Kyle Shanahan has confirmed the team has not considered signing legendary kicker Justin Tucker. The 49ers are exploring other options for a temporary replacement. Piñeiro's injury comes at a critical time for the team's playoff push.

Why Kyle Shanahan says the 49ers have not discussed bringing in Justin Tucker

Kyle Shanahan Conference Call: 49ers injury updates day after Week 11 win vs. Cardinals

The San Francisco 49ers can’t seem to escape the injury cycle this season, and their latest setback has sparked one of the most unexpected questions of the year: could legendary kicker Justin Tucker be on the team’s radar? The buzz exploded after Eddy Piñeiro strained his right hamstring during the 49ers’ 41–22 win over the Arizona Cardinals, leaving fans and analysts wondering whether San Francisco might consider the seven-time Pro Bowler as a short-term solution.Tucker, who spent 13 seasons with the Baltimore Ravens, remains one of the most accomplished kickers in NFL history. But when Kyle Shanahan finally addressed the rumors, his response made one thing very clear.When asked directly about the team exploring Tucker as an option, Shanahan didn’t hesitate. “No. We haven’t talked about that,” he told 49ers Webzone. The follow-up question didn’t change much. “I have no idea. I haven’t talked about one kicker with them, so not sure about anyone. I know they’re putting together a group of guys to possibly bring in Tuesday or Wednesday.”The idea of Tucker joining San Francisco is tempting for fans. Even after a down season where he posted a 73.3% field-goal percentage, his career numbers, 89.1% overall and a record-setting 66-yard kick, speak for themselves. But Tucker’s situation is complicated.He missed 10 games this year due to a suspension tied to an alleged violation of the Personal Conduct Policy, and despite expressing interest in returning to the field, he has not yet visited any team.With Shanahan confirming no internal discussions about Tucker, the 49ers are turning elsewhere. Names reportedly in the mix include John Parker Romo, recently waived by the Atlanta Falcons, and Matt Gay, who became available after the Commanders released him. The irony is that former Niners kicker Jake Moody, who was replaced by Piñeiro earlier this season, is no longer an option, Washington picked him up from the Bears’ practice squad.Piñeiro’s injury comes at a brutal time. He opened the season by setting a franchise record for 17 straight makes and had converted all 22 field-goal attempts. Shanahan praised him earlier this year, saying, “He’s been awesome so far. Pumped that we’ve been able to get him.”Now week-to-week with a Grade 1 hamstring strain, Piñeiro joins a growing list of injured players, including linebacker Tatum Bethune. As the 49ers fight to maintain momentum in the NFC West, the search for a reliable fill-in kicker begins, but for now, Justin Tucker isn’t part of that conversation.Also Read: Ja’Marr Chase’s bizarre excuse for spitting on Jalen Ramsey fuels heated league-wide debate as suspension appeal looms","Eddy Piñeiro is week-to-week with a hamstring injury.

Why did Jordon Hudson claim credit for sports journalist Pablo Torre’s award?



Sports journalist Pablo Torre, who’s best known for his podcast Pablo Torre Finds Out, has had some rather salty things to say about Bill Belichick’s highly publicised relationship with 24-year-old Jordon Hudson. Recently, Pablo Torre Finds Out secured a spot on Apple Podcast’s “Best Of 2025” list. The show was named one of the year’s top 10 programs for its overall influence, and the episode that exposed the scandal involving Kawhi and the Clippers was specifically highlighted on the “Best Episode” list.And since Jordon has often been a talking point for Pablo, she took a sneaky jibe at Pablo on social media. On Wednesday, Pablo celebrated his recent accolade with a tweet, and Jordon slid into the comments section to say, “You’re welcome.” Jordan, who is a cheerleader, a pageant and also a publicist for her partner Bill Belichick, surprised fans with her savage response; she basically implied that she was partially responsible for Pablo’s show’s success as he spends so much time analysing her and Belichick’s relationship.Torre first began focusing on Belichick and Hudson in May, releasing a series of reports that explored how their relationship began, the friction her presence allegedly created with North Carolina’s leadership, and footage suggesting she often tried to exert significant influence over his decisions.His show took a few years to truly find its footing, but Torre pushed it to new heights in 2025 with a remarkable string of exclusives from revelations about the gambling probe that resulted in Terry Rozier and Chauncey Billups’ arrests, to Kawhi Leonard’s questionable endorsement arrangement with the Clippers, to evidence of collusion between the NFL and NFLPA.He also became the definitive source on the turmoil inside UNC following Bill Belichick’s arrival as head coach, as he delivered a steady stream of striking details about the influence Jordon Hudson was allegedly exerting within the program.Also Read: More coverage on the NFL",Pablo Torre Finds Out secured a spot on Apple Podcast’s “Best Of 2025’ list.

Sai Sudharsan Exclusive Interview: 'The dream is to play Test cricket'

Poll How do you rate Shubman Gill's chances of becoming a successful Test captain? Unsure Low Moderate Very high

Not long after Gujarat Titans (GT) booked their place in the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2025 playoffs, skipper Shubman Gill posted on X, ""Discipline in the details."" That encapsulates Gill perfectly. Unlike the charged captains with their in-your-face attitude, Gill goes about his job without much noise.He would run up and down the length of the field to confer with the bowlers. Even when a catch wasn't plucked, he didn't have a go at the fielder; instead, he applauded the bowler for nearly inflicting a dismissal. Upon a boundary, he would gesture to the bowler that possibly the line wasn't right. At no point would you see an irate skipper or shoulders dropping from the team.That has been the hallmark of a team that has been in perfect touch this IPL season. GT became one of three teams to book their place in the next round of the competition and are primed to finish in the top two. Forming the core of such a confident display is the top-two of Sai Sudharsan and Gill, who are one and two, respectively, in the Orange Cap standings with just 16 runs separating the duo.Gill, expectedly, carries the bulk of the responsibility of winning a second IPL title. Yet, his demeanour doesn't flinch. As it started to pour in the capital on Saturday, the team's football session was interrupted. When it did subside, Gill was one of the first few out to limber up.He would enjoy himself during the warm-up, make deft touches against an advancing defender, opt for simple passes and yet remain ultra-competitive when the ball went astray. That is clearly visible in his approach to batting as well.Where Delhi Capitals (DC) rotated batters in the nets, Gill went through a host of styles in a single lengthy session. It began with throwdowns before moving to squad regulars and net bowlers. He would play defensively to balls that tested him; let the ones go that were outside his range and tonk the ones that deserved to be attacked.Many would be done after the warm-ups and nets, but not Gill. He took a quick breather, spoke to coach Ashish Nehra, and got out of his batting gear before moving to protective gear. Short-gap catches were followed by long-range catches that were plucked with little fuss.At 25, Gill is at a crucial juncture in his career. Having sealed a spot for himself in the India squad, even leading in five T20Is, he's on the cusp of being named the next Test captain . The five-match Test series in England could be his trial by fire following Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli's retirements. The fact that GT are top of the IPL points table, could finish in the top two, and Gill is scoring freely only strengthens his case.""I have seen him from U-16. Actually, in NCA, I have done two camps with him. So from the U-16 age group, I have seen that he used to use his brains a lot more than a lot of other guys at his age. That is one quality that is needed to be a captain,"" said GT assistant coach Aashish Kapoor of Gill.""Where you can use your brains for yourself and for 10 other people. How are you going to win matches? And we have seen this.""When Hardik (Pandya) left, we could have always gone with someone else, a senior as a captain. But we took a chance with him. (Last year) we could see that he was trying hard as a captain. And you can see the results this year.""I mean, the captaincy has been the same, but he is in better form this year, which is helping himself and the team,"" he added.When asked to predict whether Gill could translate his T20 captaincy success into the Test format, Kapoor stated it was hard, using the example of MS Dhoni from 2011.""When (MS) Dhoni was made captain for the World Cup for the first time, he was not captain anywhere. So nobody knew, 10 years, 12 years down the line, he is going to be one of the world's best captains.""If you had asked somebody at that point in time, including Dhoni, what do you think of your captaincy? There would be no answer. So you have to see a person over a period of time before you can make any judgement on him. And he has not even started,"" clarified Kapoor.On the field of play, Gill struggled to get going against Delhi Capitals on Sunday. With 200 to get, Gill focused on rotating the strike and letting his partner Sudharsan shoulder the responsibility of holding the steering wheel.While the left-hander Sudharsan kept his foot on the accelerator and swiftly changed gears, Gill caught on to the task. He scored 21 from the first 19 balls before jumping to 36 off 26 balls and 59 off 35 balls, only to finish on 93 from 53 balls, hitting three fours and seven sixes.""He was (playing) cautiously and also was not timing the ball all that well. But what was important is, he didn't throw away his wicket even though the total was 200. It is so easy when you are chasing 200, which is 10 runs an over,"" said Kapoor on Gill's knock against DC.""And if you are not timing the ball, you could play one or two bad shots and get out and push off. I think Sai played an important role in that because he kept throwing runs at the start.""And they were not getting bogged down. Even though he was not able to time the ball initially, Sai was playing beautifully and that took the pressure off him. So he got that extra time to get in. And then once he was in, he played some good shots,"" clarified the GT official.",Gujarat Titans captain Shubman Gill is at a crucial juncture in his career. Gill is on the cusp of being named the next Test captain of India. The five-match Test series in England could be his trial by fire following Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli's retirement.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121257632,imgsize-111058,width-400,resizemode-4/New-Delhi-Gujarat-Titans-captain-Shubman-Gill-during-an-Indian-Premier-League-.jpg"

Following his team's crushing loss at the Arun Jaitley Stadium on Sunday, Delhi Capitals captain Axar Patel has asked his bowlers to step up.After starting the campaign with five successive wins, Delhi Capitals have completely lost their plot, and their chances of qualifying for the playoffs look slim.""Fielding and bowling in the powerplay need to improve,"" Axar said at the post-match presentation.Axar Patel also hailed his opponents for their batting performance and added that the ball was coming nicely onto the bat in the second innings.""The way they batted was excellent. The wicket also got better as the game went on,"" he said.Batting first, Delhi Capitals lost Faf du Plessis early.

Got a good finish, KL (Rahul) batted well. Our bowlers tried hard but could not get the win. The way we batted was a positive given the last couple of games,"" said Axar.Delhi's bowling struggled against Shubman Gill (93* off 53 balls, with three fours and seven sixes) and Sai Sudharsan (108* off 61 balls, with 12 fours and four sixes). They put on a dominant, unbeaten 205-run partnership, helping Gujarat win with an over to spare.""The ball came on nicely in the second innings. It didn’t stick in the pitch like it did in the first innings. They didn’t lose wickets, which made it easier as well,"" said Axar.With this win, GT have made it to the playoffs, with nine wins and three losses, giving them 18 points.

Sai Sudharsan Exclusive Interview: 'The dream is to play Test cricket'

Gujarat Titans (GT) opener Sai Sudharsan has credited captain Shubman Gill for his ""straight talks"" during their partnerships, which have helped him improve as a cricketer in this year's Indian Premier League (IPL).On Sunday evening, the southpaw smashed 108 not out off 61 balls as GT chased down 200 in 19 overs. He was well supported by captain Shubman Gill, who remained unbeaten on 93 off 53 balls.“There's a lot of understanding between us (him and Shubman Gill). Running between the wickets is one thing we talk about, and when I make a mistake, he points it out — and similarly from my side as well,” said Sudharsan during the post-match presentation ceremony.Asked how he aced the chase, Sudharsan said, “It feels great to help the team win. I missed out quite a few times in doing so this season, and during the break, I was thinking about it — and it paid off today.”“After the six overs, during overs 7 to 10, they bowled really well, and the momentum dipped a bit. But we were cool and calm enough to take the game deep. We got a couple of big overs around 12–13, which helped. In previous games, I took chances and got out, but this time I was more aware and took the right matchups.”Sudharsan is currently sitting on top of the Orange Cap race with 617 runs to his name. He is closely followed by his captain Shubman Gill, who has amassed 601 runs so far this season.The 10-wicket win against Delhi Capitals has propelled the Titans to their third playoffs. Captain Gill was a happy man and also showered praise on his opening partner, who is in red-hot form.“He has been in tremendous form this season — the way he has been able to convert starts. You see the conditions and the situation — we talk about finishing the game and not leaving it to anyone else, because on a wicket like this, a couple of wickets could create pressure. At the halfway mark, we felt we gave 10–15 runs extra. They batted well, and the ball was spinning,” said Gill of Sudharsan.","Gujarat Titans (GT) opener Sai Sudharsan has credited captain Shubman Gill for his ""straight talks"" during their partnerships.

Bombay Sport Exchange Ep 5: Shane Watson on how IPL gave him a lifeline & his tribute to Phil Hughes

NEW DELHI: KL Rahul did much of the heavy-lifting for Delhi Capitals as they batted first against Delhi Capitals at the Arun Jaitley Stadium on Sunday evening. During his 60-ball century, and eventual 112* from 65 balls, he ticked plenty of boxes in an effortless knock which took DC to 199 runs, their biggest total at this venue in IPL 2025 .While playing 65 balls (the most by a batter this IPL season), he pocketed numerous milestones along the way as well: fastest Indian to 8000 T20 runs, fourth on the list of most centurions in IPL history, joint-third in the list of most centuries by Indians in T20s.His innings was stupendously paced as well. In his first 20 balls, he scored 25 runs. In the next 20 balls each he scored 38 and 39 runs, respectively. The last five balls fetched 10 runs. As far as pacing an innings in a T20 is concerned, this was template stuff.And this was the plan all along as DC moved KL Rahul to top of the order. Having tried multiple combinations with none of them proving fruitful, the franchise rolled the dice again. And again, it didn't work out. Faf du Plessis fell for 5 after a laboured start, producing an opening stand of just 16 runs.But it allowed KL Rahul more time to get settled before going into the attacking mode, which saw 14 fours and four sixes. Except, it wasn't enough -- by a long margin.Sai Sudharsan and Shubman Gill showed what DC have been missing all this season -- a set pair to open the innings. The pairing collected their seventh 50-plus stand for the first wicket in IPL 2025. And when they crossed the 100-run mark without much of a fuss, it was their seventh in IPL history.As the score ticked to 158 runs, the records just became harsh on DC, as it was the highest opening stand against them.Not long after, Sudharsan, fittingly, got the job done with a six. The manner of the result was also duly appropriate. Half-tracker outside off by Vipraj Nigam, Sudharsan went on the back foot and pulled well over long-on. Six and Gujarat Titans had earned themselves a 10-wicket win and a place in the playoffs. Well, themselves and Royal Challengers Bengaluru and Punjab Kings as well.The maximum to close the match out was the 11th six of the GT innings, which coupled with the 15 fours, meant 126 of the 205 runs that GT scored came in boundaries or 61.46%.Sudharsan's 108 from 61 balls and Gill's 93 from 53 balls were laden with boundaries, yet there was little risk involved. Where Gill controlled 82% of his shots, Sudharsan was on 85% on that metric.""We've batted and played really well throughout, going into the playoffs is a reward for how well we've done. Openers play low-risk cricket, still they have the ability to hit down the ground and find boundaries. The fours they hit during the game, especially. They know their game, they put a lot of work in strengthening their basics which shows,"" said GT assistant coach Parthiv Patel after the win.""Opening pair is about chemistry and knowing each other's games wel,l which they do,"" he added.On the eve of the match, Parthiv had stressed on looking at the glass-half-full with their batting, suggesting he was focused on the top order doing the job for them. And on Sunday, that glass just got a bit fuller.",Gujarat Titans beat Delhi Capitals by 10 wickets at the Arun Jaitley Stadium.

Bombay Sport Exchange Ep 5: Shane Watson on IPL, India-Australia rivalry | Part 1

In a challenging season for the Rajasthan Royals (RR) pacer Fazalhaq Farooqi has found himself in the spotlight for an unfortunate reason in the ongoing Indian Premier League (IPL).Over the course of four matches in the IPL 2025 season, Farooqi has bowled a total of 17 overs without claiming a single wicket, conceding 210 runs in the process with an high economy rate of 12.35. It is the most by a bowler without taking any wickets in the IPL history. Previous record was held by Ishant Sharma in IPL 2017.Interestingly, between January 1 2024 and the start of IPL 2025, he was the joint-highest wicket-taker in men’s T20s alongside Wanindu Hasaranga (89).Farooqi, known for his ability to swing the ball both ways, was expected to bolster the Royals' bowling attack, but he has failed to deliver for the Royals.Despite this rough patch, it's worth noting that Farooqi has had significant success in other tournaments. He was the joint-highest wicket-taker in the 2024 ICC Men’s T20 World Cup and recorded the best bowling figures in ILT20 history with a 5/16 performance against Dubai Capitals in January 2025.Earlier, Nehal Wadhera and Shashank Singh struck fine half-centuries to rescue Punjab Kings and help them to a competitive 219 for 5 against Rajasthan Royals on Sunday. PBKS, currently on 15 points and in a good position to make the playoffs, were reduced to 34/3 in only the fourth over with RR's right-arm pacer Tushar Deshpande (2/37) getting rid of openers Priyansh Arya (9) and Prabhsimran Singh (21).But Wadhera blazed to a 37-ball 70, studded with five boundaries and as many sixes, and shared a 67-run fourth-wicket partnership with skipper Shreyas Iyer (30) to bail PBKS out.Wadhera, who struck his third half-century of the season, was also involved in a 58-run fifth-wicket stand with Shashank Singh (59 not out, 30 balls)..A fit-again Sanju Samson was back to lead Rajasthan Royals and replaced Nitish Rana in the XI.

NEW DELHI: Rajasthan Royals (RR), asked to bowl first on Sunday, made significant changes ahead of the clash against Punjab Kings (PBKS), largely due to injuries that have ruled out two of their key players, Jofra Archer and Nitish Rana Jofra Archer, the English speedster, has been sidelined with a thumb injury sustained during RR’s match against Kolkata Knight Riders on May 4.It was a freak incident during fielding, and although initially considered minor, further medical assessment confirmed ligament damage, ruling him out for the remainder of the IPL 2025 season.His absence is a huge blow to RR’s bowling unit, which has already been underwhelming this season. In Archer's place, RR brought in young South African pacer Kwena Maphaka , who now takes up the responsibility of leading the pace attack.Meanwhile, Nitish Rana, the experienced Indian left-handed batter, has also been ruled out of the tournament due to a calf muscle strain.Also See: GT vs DC Live Score, IPL 2025 He had been a key figure in RR’s middle order and brought stability and composure to their lineup. The injury occurred during training last week, and despite initial hopes of recovery, medical scans advised complete rest.As a replacement, RR signed 21-year-old South African batter Lhuan-dre Pretorius , signalling their focus on grooming young talent for the future. Sanju Samson , back at the helm after a brief injury layoff, acknowledged these setbacks during the toss, stating, “Let's see how it plays out today. I am okay, hundred percent fit. I would love to respect where he (Suryavanshi) is batting. He has played well for us. I will bat down the order, I come in for Nitish Rana. Maphaka comes in for Jofra Archer.”It’s clear that RR are in a transition phase with pride being their only motivator now, as their playoff hopes are already extinguished.With these absences, the Royals face an uphill battle against a high-flying Punjab Kings side.

Punjab Kings (PBKS) captain Shreyas Iyer battled a severe finger injury to score a feisty 25-ball 30 against Rajasthan Royals in their Indian Premier League (IPL) 2025 clash on a hot Sunday afternoon at the Sawai Mansingh Stadium in Jaipur.Iyer walked out for the toss with a heavily taped index finger, having been hit during the practice session on the eve of the match.He came in to bat when Punjab found themselves in a tricky situation. After opting to bat first, PBKS lost momentum early, losing three quick wickets — Priyansh Arya, Prabhsimran Singh, and Mitch Owen.Iyer, known for his composure in pressure situations, opened his account with a stylish flicked boundary past mid-wicket off Tushar Deshpande. South African left-arm quick Kwena Mphaka attempted a short-pitched delivery, but strayed in line and was punished with a crisp square cut.Two boundaries in the ninth over off Akash Madhwal brought up the 50-run partnership for the fourth wicket with Nehal Wadhera.Iyer later brought up Punjab’s 100 with a glorious whip through wide long-on. Just when he seemed to be settling in, he mistimed a shot straight to long-off, where Yashasvi Jaiswal took a comfortable catch.

BENGALURU: The M Chinnaswamy Stadium is usually bathed in a hue of bold red and black. But on Saturday night, white jerseys — a replica of Virat Kohli ’s No. 18 Test jersey, to be specific — dominated the stands.Recently, Kohli had said, “The love that I have received from the fans, I don’t think any silverware, or any trophy can come close to that.”That love was supposed to be on show at the Royal Challengers Bengaluru ’s home game against Kolkata Knight Riders . Many tributes were planned for the former India skipper, who retired from Test cricket on Monday, but the grey skies, which opened a little over an hour before the toss, proved to be a dampener for more than one reason.The match being abandoned without a ball being bowled meant a watery grave for defending champions KKR’s campaign. While Ajinkya Rahane and his men were knocked out of the tournament, it is champagne on ice for the home side as they remain one win away from sealing the playoffs berth.RCB go on top of the table with 17 points from 12 outings.Forecast of rain notwithstanding, spectators made a beeline for the venue, with Kohli being the flavour of the evening.The white jerseys his fans donned had handwritten messages like, ‘end of an era’ and ‘in white he walked; in hearts he stayed’.There was never a flicker of hope of the rain stopping, yet fans refused to budge right till the end.","Royal Challengers Bengaluru's IPL match against Kolkata Knight Riders was abandoned due to rain.

NEW DELHI: Nehal Wadhera and Shashank Singh smashed half-centuries, while left-arm spinner Harpreet Brar bagged three wickets as Punjab Kings edged Rajasthan Royals by 10 runs on Sunday to boost their IPL playoff hopes. Powered by Wadhera’s explosive 70 off 37 balls, an unbeaten 59 from Shashank, and a handy 30-run knock by skipper Shreyas Iyer , PBKS posted a strong 219 for 5.In response, RR openers Yashasvi Jaiswal (50 off 25) and Vaibhav Suryavanshi (40) gave the home team a blistering start, adding 76 runs in just 4.5 overs. But Harpreet Brar (3/22) broke the momentum by removing Suryavanshi in the fifth over, triggering a steady fall of wickets. Despite a fighting 53 off 31 balls from Dhruv Jurel, Rajasthan fell short, finishing at 209 for 7.Azmatullah Omarzai (2/44) also made key contributions with the ball, dismissing skipper Sanju Samson (20) and the dangerous Shimron Hetmyer (11).The win took Punjab Kings to 17 points — level with second-placed Royal Challengers Bengaluru — but they sit third on the table due to net run rate.After the match, PBKS pacer Arshdeep Singh shared a light-hearted moment with RR opener Jaiswal, who had taken him to the cleaners early on. Jaiswal blazed away to a 25-ball 50, smashing Arshdeep for four boundaries and a six in his very first over, scoring 22 off 6 deliveries.Arshdeep, who had a forgettable outing conceding 60 runs in his four overs, posted a humorous video on Instagram. In it, he tells Jaiswal in a typical Bollywood tone, “Bohot maara be, dhaaga hi khol diya” (You really smashed me, tore the thread off). Jaiswal replied with a grin, “Ekdum, maine bola tha isko, mai maarunga ek din” (Absolutely, I had told him I’ll smash him one day).Meanwhile, PBKS skipper Shreyas Iyer etched his name in IPL history by becoming the first player to captain three different franchises into the playoffs. Having previously led Delhi Capitals in 2019 and 2020, and Kolkata Knight Riders in 2024, Iyer has now guided Punjab to the final four in his very first season with the team.","Nehal Wadhera and Shashank Singh hit half-centuries as Punjab Kings beat Rajasthan Royals by 10 runs.

Rishabh Pant will be eager to reset his faltering IPL campaign as Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) face Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) in a crucial encounter on Monday.LSG must win all their remaining three matches to keep their slim play-off hopes alive, needing not just victories but dominant ones to overcome a poor net run rate of -0.469.Pant, who fetched a record Rs 27 crore in the last IPL auction, has endured a torrid season, scoring just 128 runs in 11 games at an average of 12.80 and a strike rate below 100. With his name in contention for India’s Test vice-captaincy, the LSG skipper will be keen to deliver impactful performances to boost both his form and image.SRH, already out of play-off contention, will play for pride. Players like Nitish Kumar Reddy and Ishan Kishan will look to gain form ahead of India A’s England tour, while Abhishek Sharma will aim to prove a point after his omission.LSG will bank on Nicholas Pooran and openers Aiden Markram and Mitchell Marsh. Their bowling has struggled, with only Digvesh Rathi impressing. SRH’s in-form batting could exploit LSG's inconsistent attack in this do-or-die match.The red soil pitch offers a well-balanced contest between bat and ball. With a hard, well-rolled surface, it promises pace and bounce for the fast bowlers and some grip for spinners, especially in the first half. Average scores hover around 190, but the large ground dimensions — 72m and 60m square, 78m straight — can keep totals in check. The pitch has been used before and should allow for free-flowing stroke play, especially for top-order batters. Given previous match trends, it may slightly assist spin early and become better under lights, making it a likely ""win the toss and chase"" scenario.Aiden Markram, Nicholas Pooran, Rishabh Pant (c & wk), Abdul Samad, Ayush Badoni, David Miller, Akash Maharaj Singh, Digvesh Singh Rathi, Avesh Khan, Mayank Yadav, Prince YadavImpact Sub: Mitchell Marsh/Ravi BishnoiAbhishek Sharma, Ishan Kishan (wk), Sachin Baby, Heinrich Klaasen, Aniket Verma, Abhinav Manohar, Pat Cummins (c), Harshal Patel, Jaydev Unadkat, Zeeshan Ansari, Eshan MalingaImpact Sub: Travis Head/Mohammed ShamiA hot and sunny day is expected in Lucknow on Monday, with temperatures peaking around 40°C and no chance of rain.

Rahul Dravid reflects on RR's narrow losses: 'One or two hits away in every game'

IPL: Sunil Joshi hails Harpreet Brar’s impact as Punjab Kings down Rajasthan Royals

NEW DELHI: Former champions Gujarat Titans stormed into the IPL 2025 playoffs in style, registering a dominant 10-wicket victory over Delhi Capitals on Sunday. Skipper Shubman Gill and opener Sai Sudharsan starred with the bat in a flawless run chase, as GT hunted down DC’s target of 200 with six balls to spare.Sudharsan blazed his way to a 61-ball unbeaten 108, while Gill remained unbeaten on a composed 93 off 53 deliveries. The two stitched together a record opening stand and ensured Gujarat’s place in the knockouts with two league matches still to play.“Feels great to get the Q (qualification), but still two important games left. Carrying momentum is important. I've talked about being a batter, think as one without worrying about captaincy,” said Gill at the post-match presentation.Reflecting on his captaincy journey, Gill admitted to early struggles in the role but said he has since learned how to handle the pressure.“Found it (captaincy) challenging last year, learnt how to manage it late in the season. Our fielding had been below par, we'd dropped a lot of catches, we reflected on that and worked on it during the break,” he said.Gill also credited his calm approach at the crease to a conscious decision to separate captaincy from batting responsibilities.“When you're in form, someone like Sai who's converting starts, you don't talk much. You just talk about what's required. When in flow, you just need to make sure you don't get carried away,” he explained.The enforced break due to military tensions between India and Pakistan, Gill said, gave him a chance to recover physically.“I'd gotten sick, the break helped me recover.”Assistant coach Parthiv Patel praised the openers’ approach and mutual understanding, which he believes have been crucial to GT’s success this season.“We've batted and played really well throughout, going into the playoffs is a reward for how well we've done. Openers play low-risk cricket, still they have the ability to hit down the ground and find boundaries.""The fours they hit during the game especially. They know their game, they put a lot of work in strengthening their basics which shows. They communicate well, last year they batted brilliantly.""Opening pair is about chemistry and knowing each other's games well which they do.""Parthiv also credited head coach Ashish Nehra ’s leadership for the team’s consistency and strong standing on the points table.“He's been fantastic and is the reason why we're right up there,” he said.Player of the match Sudharsan, now the leading run-scorer of the season alongside Gill (609 and 594 runs respectively), said staying mentally composed was key to chasing down a daunting total.“We took the game deep, were cool enough mentally and got 2-3 big overs after 12, which worked out. Had taken risks in earlier games which hadn't worked out. I've also started to believe myself more to take the game deeper, expand my game.""Not much has changed with my batting, but mentally I'm more free and expressive. Maybe I can get better at striking against spin and improving my batting after the 15th over.""On his partnership with Gill, Sudharsan highlighted the strong rapport they’ve built over time.“There's a lot of understanding. We complement each other especially when the other batter is doing well, running is a vital thing too,” he said.",Gujarat Titans qualify for IPL 2025 playoffs with 10-wicket victory over Delhi Capitals.

Rahul Dravid reflects on RR's narrow losses: 'One or two hits away in every game'

NEW DELHI: Sai Sudharsan and Shubman Gill powered Gujarat Titans to a resounding 10-wicket win over Delhi Capitals in a crucial IPL 2025 clash at the Arun Jaitley Stadium on Sunday, sealing their spot in the playoffs.Chasing 200, Sudharsan remained unbeaten on a career-best 108 off 61 balls, while Gill smashed 93 not out off 53 deliveries, guiding GT to 205 without loss with an over to spare. Their unbeaten 205-run partnership not only humbled DC but also underlined Gujarat’s batting firepower heading into the knockout stage.Sudharsan struck 12 fours and four sixes, while Gill’s knock featured seven sixes and three boundaries. The chase was set up early as Sudharsan took 20 off T Natarajan’s first over, while Gill joined the party post powerplay, clearing the ropes at will.DC had earlier posted 199 for 3, courtesy of a sublime unbeaten 112 off 65 balls from KL Rahul.

Arshdeep may have been expensive early on, conceding heavily as Jaiswal and young Vaibhav Suryavanshi tore into the PBKS bowling, but it was spinner Harpreet Brar who turned the tide.Brar’s spell of 3/22 in four overs, including the key wickets of Jaiswal and Suryavanshi, helped derail RR’s explosive start.Earlier in the game, it was Nehal Wadhera (70 off 37) and Shashank Singh (59 not out off 30) who lit up the innings for PBKS, taking them to a challenging total of 219/5.

New low for Messi and Miami

Poll What do you think is the main reason for Inter Miami's recent struggles? Messi's lack of goals Coaching tactics Lack of offensive creativity Defensive errors

Inter Miami suffered a devastating 3-0 defeat to Orlando City in the MLS on Sunday, reducing them to just one win in their last seven outings. Lionel Messi failed to inspire his side on a difficult night where chances came sparingly to the hosts. His two shots on target were expertly pushed aside by Orlando keeper Pedro Gallese.The game stood testament to the way Miami have struggled defensively under Argentine boss Javier Mascherano. Striker Luis Suarez too, failed to capitalize despite having two shots on goal.Orlando City opened the scoring in the 43rd minute when goalkeeper Pedro Gallese's long ball found Luis Muriel, who converted the opportunity with ease. The visitors continued to exploit Miami's fragile defense, though Argentine Marti Ojeda missed a clear chance to extend the lead.Miami's goalkeeper Oscar Ustari made some impressive saves before committing an error that led to Orlando's second goal. Marco Pasilic's low shot from the edge of the box went through Ustari's hands and legs.Despite Miami coach Javier Mascherano's tactical changes to bolster the attack, Orlando sealed their victory in stoppage time. Duncan McGuire's cross from the left found Icelandic forward Dagur Thorhallsson, who scored the third goal.""Now we'll truly see if we're a team in difficult times, because when everything's going well it's very easy,"" Messi told Apple TV. ""When difficult times come, that's when we have to be more united than ever, be a true team, and pull ourselves together.""'Miami's recent form has been concerning, with 20 goals conceded and only 11 scored in their last seven matches. Their sole victory during this period came against the New York Red Bulls on May 3.Following the loss to Orlando, Messi and Miami need to regroup and recover for their next game against the Philadelphia Warriors. A surprising statistic reveals the extent to which Miami have been struggling to impress in recent games. The 3-0 defeat on Monday marks the biggest home loss for the club ever since signing the World Cup winner.Mascherano acknowledged his team's initial control of the game but expressed concern about their recurring mistakes. ""I'd say for 25 or 30 minutes we had it completely under control playing in the opponent's half, but this is how it is, clearly. I'm not going to deny what the result is,"" he said.""Unfortunately, we can't afford the mistakes we make; that's clear, but it's pointless for me to come here and tell this story, because it keeps happening. So, clearly, we as a coaching staff are failing in many of these ways, and we have to try to find a way around them so we don't continue failing and so the team starts getting results,"" Mascherano added.","Inter Miami suffered a 3-0 defeat to Orlando City in the MLS on Sunday.

A fitting farewell for Leicester City's greatest-ever player

Looking ahead: Jamie Vardy's future and Leicester's next chapter

""He Was Always Going To Score!"" ⚽️ | JJ On Vardy's Last Appearence

Premier League legend Jamie Vardy ended his sensational 13-year Leicester City career in style when he netted his 200th goal for the club on his 500th and final appearance as the Foxes beat Ipswich Town 2-0 on Sunday. It was an emotionally charged occasion, as it should have been, at the King Power Stadium with fans commemorating a player who had journeyed from non-league to a Premier League winner, to a club legend.Vardy's landmark goal arrived in the 28th minute and was a trademark finish courtesy of an accurate cut-back from James Justin. The timing was poetic, too, falling 13 years to the day since Vardy swapped Fleetwood Town for Leicester for £1 million. The story of his rise from England's fifth tier to the top of the English game is one of football's most stirring fables.Magic was in the air at the King Power Stadium as fans unfurled banners and sang in unison in tribute to their hero. Vardy came off in the 80th minute to an honor guard from his teammates and a standing ovation from the crowd. The messages on the scoreboard read “Thank You Vards” and “Goodbye GOAT,” a reminder of his significance to the club.This season, though, Vardy was the highest scorer for Leicester despite the club's relegation with ten goals.

The goals, the celebration, and the spotlight

A viral moment and a glimpse of what’s to come

Cristiano Ronaldo Jr. , only 14 years old, took strides out of his father’s long shadow to create his own narrative. He scored an important brace (his 11th and 12th goals) in the final of the Vlatko Markovic International Tournament , helping Portugal U15s from behind to a 3–2 win against Croatia. Wearing the revered number 7 shirt, the 14-year-old not only excels, he amazes the world of football with an early performance far beyond his age and certainly beyond his wildest dreams, announcing himself in his first final wearing the national colors and doing so in unforgettable style.Cristiano Jr. sent himself on his way midway through the first half, when he controlled a through ball, took a touch, and lashed a shot into the top corner. The strike, as clean and powerful as anything seen in the senior ranks, left Croatia’s goalkeeper standing still, and his teammates swarming him in celebration. And then the “Siuuu” — the leap he had seen his father make famous. Even a few Croatian players adopted the party, a sweet indication of the regard in which the Ronaldo name is held.But the magic wasn’t over. With the score tied, 1-1, in the second half, Ronaldo Jr. displayed his instincts again, on this occasion with a fine run into the box and a perfectly timed header that put Portugal in the lead. Croatia equalised again, but Cabral’s late winner made the difference.It was, however, the brace from Cristiano Jr. that made the difference, awarding him with the Man of the Match award and unquestionably cementing his name in the history books of the tournament.Also Read: Cristiano Jr. makes Portugal U-15 debut as proud dad Ronaldo celebrates on social media Social media exploded as soon as the final whistle sounded.

Scouts across Europe quickly took notice, and now at least 16 big clubs are reportedly hot on the teenager’s trail.","Cristiano Ronaldo Jr. scored a brace in the final of the Vlatko Markovic International Tournament.

First ever podium finish for Dan Ticktum

Dan Ticktum couldn’t hide his emotions after securing the first podium finish of his Formula E career, coming home third at the Tokyo E-Prix Round 9 on Sunday. The race was won by Nissan’s Oliver Rowland, who took a significant step closer to clinching the world championship title. Ticktum, driving for Cupra Kiro, was visibly elated after the race and shared a heartfelt message with his team over the radio.“Very good, gentlemen. Great job. Well done, everyone. I am so happy for you guys, I really am. Everyone doubts me, but I’m going to start proving them wrong. That’s nice. Many drivers are giving me thumbs up—how lovely. Right, I want a beer,” he said over the team radio.Sharing his feelings after the podium win, Dan Ticktum said: “It feels pretty good! I’m already like ‘if we had done this or done that’ I could have won, but I’m very happy overall and it’s a big boost for the team. I just don’t feel like we’ve ever had a breakthrough this season and that’s it. We’re really competing consistently at the top now across all conditions and the team executed a pretty flawless weekend - so I’m happy.”Talking further about the Tokyo race, he added, “There’s not a huge amount I could have done, there was quite a long time when I was forced to lead which was obviously not ideal, and then when me and Pascal [Wehrlein] went to take Attack Mode, Oli [Rowland] got in between us. I don’t know what more we could have done from our side really, just different strategies and it didn’t quite work out for P1 or P2, but ‘Driver of the Day’, I’ll take that - I thought everyone hated me!

The excitement is building ahead of the next Formula E race as Japan gets ready to host the second season of the Tokyo E-Prix. But the weather forecast shows a 100 percent chance of rainfall on both Saturday and Sunday. This is enough to concern the Formula E drivers, as—despite the much-improved Gen3 Evo cars this year running on Hankook tyres—racing in rain comes with hard-to-overcome challenges and risks. However, the rain may skip the Round 9 race Sunday evening. Here’s the complete weather forecast for the Tokyo Formula E race.According to Metcheck.com, the weather in Tokyo is expected to remain pleasant at 21 degrees Celsius on Friday, though it will be a cloudy day. There are only slight chances of rain as the Formula E drivers take part in the First Free Practice session at 4 pm (local time) and 12:30 pm IST.The temperature will remain in the range of 18–20 degrees Celsius on Saturday.

The rain is expected to be much lighter, at 0.9 mm, during the main Round 8 race at 3:05 pm (local time), which will be broadcast in India at 11:35 am.The temperature will be in the range of 19–20 degrees Celsius on Sunday, while the rain will continue to be as heavy as the day before. There is a 100 percent chance of around 3.8 mm of rain during the Third Free Practice at 8 am (local time) and the Round 9 Qualifying at 10:20 am. But the good news is that no rain is predicted for the main Round 9 race, which will start at 3:05 pm (local time) and 11:35 am IST.Mitch Evans told RacingNews365.com that it was “very, very tricky” to race in wet conditions with the Hankook tyres in the recent races. He said, “In qualifying it was like, I was terrible. Nothing, you can't wake them [the tyres] up. In the race I was way more comfortable from the start, but the pace difference between me and some other guys was huge.

For me that is what Formula E is all about, to race so tight around these street circuits.”Jaguar TCS Racing driver Nick Cassidy, who earned the ABB Driver of Progress Award with 12 overtakes during the race, praised the track as well. Reflecting on his experience, he said, “It was a mega, a proper Formula E track. Bumps, fast corners, on the limit and you’ve really got to attack in qualifying. I thought the track was fantastic.”Set in the heart of Tokyo Bay , the 2.575km circuit features 18 turns and boasts a compact, technical layout that includes three long straights and three chicane sequences.

Maximilian Gunther’s performance in current Formula E season



The Tokyo E-Prix is around the corner, and Formula E drivers are already looking to leave the Monaco hangover behind. Maximilian Gunther , who won the last Tokyo race as part of Maserati MSG Racing, has already secured one victory this season with DS Penske—in Jeddah—and will be aiming to continue his winning streak.Maximilian Gunther is the only Formula E driver this year to have converted a pole position into a win.He claimed victory in Jeddah Part 1, starting from pole and also recording the fastest lap. After clinching the win in Formula E Championship Round 3, he’ll be looking to replicate that success in Tokyo.After his Jeddah win, Günther shared a photo of himself with the trophy on Instagram, writing: “P1!!! What a race. What a day. What a feeling. Started from pole, dropped back to P9, and then fought back to take the win in the final corners, on the final lap. This one means everything! Today is a true testament to the hard work we’ve put in as a team over the past months, and it’s only the beginning. A massive thank you to everyone at @dsperformance and @ds_penske_fe, both here at the track and back at the factory. This win is for all of us.”However, Gunther couldn’t do much in his home city, Monaco, despite the double opportunities in the double header. He summed up his Monaco experience in a post that read: “Racing on the iconic streets of Monaco is always special. 🇲🇨 After a strong qualifying, we lined up P3 and gave it everything out there today. Unfortunately, we didn’t have the race pace and crossed the line in P8. Not the easiest weekend, but still walking away with two points finishes here. Now it’s time to reset and focus on Tokyo.”Also Read: Formula E: Driver premieres on Amazon Prime, offers unfiltered access to lives of Mitch Evans, Jake Dennis, Dan Ticktum and Antonio Da Costa Gunther made his Formula E debut with Dragon Racing, after serving as the team’s reserve driver during the 2017/18 season.

Carlos Alcaraz won the Italian Open on Sunday after beating rival Jannik Sinner 7-6 (7/5), 6-1 in the final and firing a warning shot for Roland Garros .Alcaraz, who will climb to world number two behind Sinner on Monday, won his third title of the season ahead of the French Open which starts next weekend. The Spaniard claimed victory in his fourth final of the season and sent a message to the rest of the men's tour for Roland Garros where he will defend the title.Sinner tops the world rankings but his 26-match winning streak was ended by Alcaraz, also the man who had last beat him in last year's China Open final.Alcaraz is the only man to beat Sinner in a tour final since the start of 2024, when his Italian rival began his rise to the top of men's tennis and three Grand Slam titles.The 22-year-old has had a hugely impressive clay court swing this season even with the thigh injury which cost him the chance to compete at the Madrid Open.Alcaraz won in Rome a second Masters 1000 title of the year to go alongside his victory at Monte Carlo last month. He also reached the final in Barcelona.Finishing runner-up is still a hugely positive result for Sinner in his first tournament since his three-month ban for testing positive twice in March last year for traces of clostebol, a contamination doping authorities accepted was accidental.His progress in Rome also sets up the possibility of another final clash with Alcaraz at Roland Garros, with the two young stars of men's tennis set to be the two top seeds in Paris.Sinner was gunning to become the first Italian man to win at the Foro Italico since Adriano Panatta back in 1976, but he failed to make it a hat-trick of triumphs for home players in the Italian capital.Earlier Jasmine Paolini became the first woman since Monica Seles in 1990 to win the Rome singles and doubles titles when she and Sara Errani beat Veronika Kudermetova and Elise Mertens 6-4, 7-5.Paolini secured that brace of victories a day after overcoming former US Open champion Coco Gauff in straight sets, and becoming the first Italian woman to win the Rome singles title since Raffaella Reggi in 1985.","Carlos Alcaraz beat Jannik Sinner 7-6 (7/5), 6-1 in the Italian Open final.

NEW DELHI: In a remarkable victory at the Italian Open on Saturday, Jasmine Paolini secured her second 1000 series championship by defeating Coco Gauff 6-4, 6-2, setting a positive tone before Roland Garros this month.The achievement marks Paolini as the first Italian woman to secure the Rome tournament since Raffaella Reggi's victory in 1985, demonstrating her superiority over former US Open champion Gauff.The packed centre court at the Foro Italico witnessed Paolini's triumph, potentially the first of three titles that could be secured by Italian players in this year's Rome tournament.At 29, Paolini has become the oldest first-time Rome champion in the Open Era. Meanwhile, Gauff, who is eight years younger, missed the opportunity to become the youngest victor since Serena Williams' achievement in 2002.Gauff's performance was hindered by 55 unforced errors and seven double faults on serve, similar to her semi-final match against Zheng Qinwen, which simplified Paolini's path to victory.Paolini could achieve additional success in the women's doubles tournament, where she and Sara Errani face Veronika Kudermetova and Elise Mertens in Sunday's final.The last woman to win both singles and doubles titles in Rome was Monica Seles in 1990, whilst Vera Zvonareva remains the sole player to accomplish this feat in a 1000 series tournament at Indian Wells in 2009.The tournament continues with Paolini's fellow Italian Jannik Sinner set to compete against Carlos Alcaraz in Sunday's men's singles final.","Jasmine Paolini defeated Coco Gauff 6-4, 6-2 in the Italian Open final.

Sinner bounces back

Jannik Sinner set up a blockbuster Italian Open final with Carlos Alcaraz by beating Tommy Paul 1-6, 6-0, 6-3 on Friday.World number one Sinner fought back from a set down in front of a packed crowd to continue his march towards a first title at the Foro Italico .After a strangely slow start, Sinner again showed good form on centre court where, since returning to action last week from a three-month doping ban, he has taken his unbeaten run to 26 matches.And the 23-year-old will face down Alcaraz, the last man to beat Sinner in the final at the China Open in early October, with all eyes on another potential final between the pair at the French Open next month.A win for Sinner against his rival would see the men's Rome title go to an Italian for the first time since Adriano Panatta in 1976.""If I want to win Sunday I have to play one of my best tennis for sure,"" said Sinner.""Carlos has played incredible tennis today, so let's see what's coming but from my side you know incredible to be here in the final.""Alcaraz booked his place in the showdown by beating Sinner's countryman Lorenzo Musetti 6-3, 7-6 (7/4).The four-time Grand Slam champion overcame Musetti and the windy conditions in just over two hours to reach his fourth final of the season.""I'm going to have dinner, but my phone is going to be there watching (Sinner's) match,"" said Alcaraz after his win.""I have to know against who I'm going to play. I have to watch the match and see how they are going to play.""Musetti was beaten by Alcaraz in the Monte Carlo final last month and fell to his fifth straight defeat to the Spaniard after a frustrating display.And he believes that Alcaraz will have the better of it against Sinner if he brings his top form on Sunday evening.""I really rate Carlos. I think on clay that the best version of Carlos is favourite against anyone... that includes Jannik,"" he told reporters.Paul rattled off the first five games in 21 minutes in a near replica of what Sinner did to Casper Ruud on Thursday, closing out the first set in less than half an hour.The last time Sinner lost a set 6-1 was in the quarter-finals of the US Open against Daniil Medvedev, a match he won on his way to his second Grand Slam triumph.Sinner looked a shadow of the player who dominated tennis throughout 2024 right up to the start of his suspension, which was agreed with the World Anti-Doping Agency in early February.But from nowhere he came roaring back in the second set, finally forcing Paul back with some deep baseline shots of his own and his first aces of the match to win the second set to love and level the match.It was a complete role reversal with Paul now the one being thrown around the court, the world number 12 winning just 12 points in the second set and looking bewildered at how quickly the momentum shifted.Paul then handed Sinner the initiative with his second double fault of the night in game two of the third set. The Italian eventually won nine games in a row and marched on to victory.Earlier, Jasmine Paolini continued her bid to win the women's singles and doubles titles in Rome after reaching her second final of the week, this time alongside fellow Italian Sara Errani .Paolini and Errani, the reigning doubles champions, will meet Veronika Kudermetova and Elise Mertens in the final on Sunday, before which Paolini could already be crowed singles champion.Late bloomer Paolini takes on Coco Gauff on Saturday aiming for her second 1000 series title at the age of 29 and to become the first Italian women to win in Rome since Raffaella Reggi in 1985.","Jannik Sinner will play Carlos Alcaraz in the Italian Open final.

Gauff joins Paolini

Jannik Sinner marched into the semi-finals of the Italian Open on Thursday after destroying Casper Ruud in straight sets 6-0, 6-1 as Coco Gauff won a marathon three-set battle with China's Zheng Qinwen to advance to the women's final.American Gauff will face Italy's Jasmine Paolini in Saturday's title match after pulling through 7-6 (7/3), 4-6, 7-6 (7/4) in a match that lasted over three-and-a-half hours.Ruud was supposed to be Sinner's toughest test in Rome since he came back from his three-month doping ban, as the Norwegian came into the match in hot form on clay after winning in Madrid earlier this month.In his previous matches Sinner looked to be still finding his feet after his suspension, accepted from the World Anti-Doping Agency for testing positive for traces of clostebol in March last year.But the 23-year-old demolished sixth seed Ruud in just over an hour with an ominous display of tennis, his domination such that the home fans at the packed centre court, seemingly out of sympathy, began to cheer the rare points that Ruud won.""I was feeling great on court today. I think we all saw that,"" said Sinner.""How I felt today was very, very positive signs for me... I was serving well and also returning well. Moving great on the court, so I'm very happy about that.""Ruud even got the loudest celebration of the match when he held his serve for the only time, in game three of the second set, holding his arms aloft in ironic joy.""He was just everywhere... it's just like playing a wall that you know shoots hundred miles an hour balls at you all the time,"" said a bewildered Ruud.Tommy Paul, a 7-6 (7/4), 6-3 winner over Hubert Hurkacz in the day's first match, will have wondered what on earth he can do to stop Sinner if the Italian brings that form to Friday's last-four clash.Sinner won the first set in just 27 minutes, giving up only seven points as he stalked the court with intent, dressed all in black as he has been all week.And he then maintained his record of not dropping a set in the tournament to not so much stroll as smash into the last four, and send a message to Carlos Alcaraz.Spaniard Alcaraz, Sinner's key Grand Slam rival ahead of the French Open, will contest the other semi-final with Lorenzo Musetti on Friday afternoon, with the blockbuster final tennis fans wanted still on.Gauff prevailed on a centre court left mostly empty by fans who headed for the exits in large numbers after watching Sinner's tennis clinic.Former US Open winner Gauff won her third straight match against Olympic gold medallist Zheng, after coming through a tie in which she made 15 double faults on serve and there were a combined total of 156 unforced errors.The 21-year-old is looking for her first title of the season after losing the Madrid final to Sabalenka, and against home hope Paolini will find herself in a much fiercer atmosphere than the soporific crowd which stayed till past midnight to watch her reach her second final of the year.""I told myself I'm ready to go home,"" said an exhausted Gauff.""It was tough for me, finding my rhythm especially at night, it was so slow, I just tried to stay in there.""I was frustrated. She forced me to get out of my comfort zone.""Sixth seed Paolini is the third Italian woman to reach the Foro Italico final, and the first since her doubles partner Sara Errani was thumped by Serena Williams in 2014.Late bloomer Paolini, 29, will have a chance to be the first woman from the Mediterranean nation to win in Rome since Raffaella Reggi in 1985, after beating Peyton Stearns 7-5, 6-1.""It's a privilege to be in this position. I matured late as a tennis player but everyone has their own path. Some mature earlier and some later,"" said Paolini.""I'm just enjoying it without thinking too much about the past.""Paolini could yet win both the singles and women's doubles tournaments, with her and Errani taking on Mirra Andreeva and Diana Shnaider in the semi-finals on Friday.","Jannik Sinner thrashes Casper Ruud in straight sets 6-0, 6-1.

Poll What do you think about Jannik Sinner's chances at the Italian Open? He will be eliminated early He will reach the finals He will win the title

Top-ranked tennis player Jannik Sinner met with Pope Leo XIV at the Vatican City on Wednesday during a break from the Italian Open , presenting the pontiff with a tennis racket and offering to play. The meeting came after the pope, known for his liking towards the sport, had earlier joked about not inviting Sinner, making a wordplay on the athlete's surname.The encounter took place in the Vatican's auditorium reception room, where Sinner arrived with his parents.""It's an honor,"" Sinner said in Italian as he presented the pope with a racket and ball, suggesting a quick volley.The 69-year-old American pope, who hails from Chicago, declined the offer to play, looking at the surrounding antiques and saying, ""Better not.""Leo XIV made a light-hearted comment about his white cassock being appropriate for Wimbledon, referencing the tournament's all-white dress code. The meeting included discussions about Sinner's progress in the Italian Open, where he faces a quarterfinal match on Thursday against Madrid champion Casper Ruud.Sinner is returning to competition after a three-month doping ban, which was determined to be due to accidental contamination.The Italian player is aiming to become the first from his country to claim the Rome title since Adriano Panatta's victory in 1976.During the interaction, Italian Tennis and Padel Federation head Angelo Binaghi presented the pope with an honorary federation card. ""We all felt the passion that Leo XIV has for our sport and this filled us with pride,"" Binaghi stated. ""We hope to embrace the Holy Father again soon, maybe on a tennis court.""The meeting included a photo session featuring the Davis Cup trophy, which Sinner helped Italy secure for the second consecutive year. The Billie Jean King Cup trophy, won by Italy in 2024, was also displayed during the meeting.Earlier in the week, Sinner had responded positively to the pope's initial joke, noting it was ""a good thing for us tennis players"" to have a pope who enjoys the sport.Beyond tennis, Pope Leo XIV is known to be a devoted Chicago White Sox baseball fan, following in the tradition of his predecessor, Pope Francis, who supported the Buenos Aires football club San Lorenzo.","Top-ranked tennis player Jannik Sinner met with Pope Leo XIV at the Vatican City on Wednesday during a break from the Italian Open.

Carlos Alcaraz made a triumphant return following his injury recovery, defeating Serbian qualifier Dusan Lajovic 6-3, 6-3 at the Italian Open on Friday.The world number three had previously pulled out of the Madrid Open, citing an upper right leg issue that impacted his performance in the Barcelona Open final, along with a left leg concern.Alcaraz competed against Lajovic whilst wearing a black support that covered his upper right leg, extending just below his knee.""The body felt great,"" Alcaraz said.

He regained control by breaking back, showcasing his court abilities at the Foro Italico with an impressive backhand winner following a drop shot.The second set progressed similarly, with Alcaraz establishing an early advantage. He registered 24 winners and 24 unforced errors during the match.Following his Monte Carlo Masters victory in April, Alcaraz's clay court statistics this season improved to 10-1.

Bombay Sport Exchange Ep 4: Prof. Ratnakar Shetty on BCCI, cricket politics & Indian cricket's growth

Jannik Sinner will delight crowds at the Rome Open this week when the world number one makes his return to tennis, but the Italian's three-month doping ban has allowed other local rising stars to move into the limelight.Sinner was on Monday joined in the top 10 of the men's world rankings by Lorenzo Musetti , who is at number nine after reaching the Monte Carlo final and the last four in Madrid.Meanwhile Luciano Darderi and Flavio Cobolli won tournaments in Marrakesh and Bucharest in April, further underlining the strength in depth that Italian tennis has behind Sinner, a three-time Grand Slam winner.Filippo Volandri , captain of the Italy team which has won the last two editions of the Davis Cup, told AFP that ""Italian tennis is clearly in a golden age"".""But it's been a long time coming, we're seeing the fruits of work which was started some time ago,"" he added.Volandri, who has been in charge of top-level male players for the Italian Tennis Federation (FITP) for the last nine years, showed AFP a graphic which illustrates Italy's recent progress.Between 2005 and 2015 Italian players won eight ATP titles -- with seven of those in the lowest 250 category -- but since 2016 the tally of tournament wins has more than trebled to 31.Five of those 31 wins have come in top-level Master 1000 tournaments, with another three being Sinner's Grand Slam triumphs. Sinner is responsible in total for 19 of Italy's ATP wins since 2016.""Jannik is the product of a movement which had already given us Matteo Berrettini reaching the Wimbledon final (in 2021). He is the result of a system that works,"" said Volandri.Michelangelo Dell'Edera, the director of the FITP's Higher Training Institute, told AFP that the federation runs a geographically-decentralised system which was put in place at the end of the 1990s.""Every province has a coach from the federation for children between 8-10 years old, while each region has a manager in charge of players between the ages of 11 and 16,"" explained Dell'Edera.Players were for a long time obliged to move to the national training centre at Tirrenia, just up the Tuscany coast from Livorno, but that is no longer the case.""Decentralisation means making our skills available to young players and their coaches,"" said Volandri.""We're reaching out to them rather than tearing them away from their families and their lives.""Dell'Edera said the renaissance in Italian tennis has also come via a change in training philosophy and playing style.""To make a comparison with another sport, we've gone from the marathon, where players were slugging forehands and backhands, to the 100m, a sort of 'speed tennis' where the emphasis is on the serve and return, two shots which determine whether a point can be won,"" he said.Every year for the past seven years, just before the Rome Open the FITP invites its 12,000 coaches to a seminar at the picturesque Foro Italico where the major clay court tournament is played.The seminar is held to discuss training, physical preparation and tactics, with guest appearances from big foreign names in the field such as Emilio Sanchez and Brad Gilbert, who were there on Saturday.Gilbert, the former coach of tennis icon Andre Agassi, is impressed with the work being done in Italy.""They're getting to the top, they have Sinner. Sometimes you get to the top and you rest. If anything, they are spending more,"" said Gilbert.""They've made an incredible commitment and they've got a great supporting team. Sinner is the reward.""But they started this thing 10, 15 years ago and they're still producing. I just watched this kid... Federico Cina. He is special.""Cina could have the chance to show how special he is as he will play Sinner in the second round in Rome if he gets past Argentinian Mariano Navone in his opening match.","Italian tennis is in a golden age, according to captain Filippo Volandri. Jannik Sinner will return to action at the Rome Open this week after a three-month doping ban. Lorenzo Musetti and Luciano Darderi are also in the top 10 of the world rankings.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120924340,imgsize-23878,width-400,resizemode-4/Jannik-Sinner-Rome-AP.jpg"

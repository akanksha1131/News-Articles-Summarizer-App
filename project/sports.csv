NEW DELHI: Former Indian cricketer Shikhar Dhawan unleashed a blistering response to Pakistan’s ceasefire violation just hours after a mutual truce was agreed upon.On Sunday, May 10, at around 8 PM, Pakistan reportedly launched multiple drone attacks targeting key Indian regions such as Srinagar and Kutch, barely three hours into the ceasefire.The truce, which was announced jointly by India’s Ministry of External Affairs and US President Donald Trump, was intended to pause escalating tensions.However, Pakistan's latest provocation has drawn condemnation from both officials and public figures across India.Taking to social media platform X, Shikhar Dhawan expressed his outrage in no uncertain terms.“Ghatiya desh ne fir apna ghatiyapan poori duniya ke aage dikha diya (The filthy nation has once again shown its filthiness to the whole world),” he posted, calling out Pakistan for once again showing its ""true colours.""His sentiment echoed the growing frustration among Indian citizens who see Pakistan's repeated breaches as deliberate and deceitful.Dhawan wasn’t alone. Virender Sehwag, Yuzvendra Chahal, and Rahul Tewatia also criticised Pakistan’s duplicity, with Sehwag sharing a stinging Hindi proverb that likened Pakistan’s actions to something inherently incorrigible.The implications of this breach have spilled into the sporting world as well. The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has reportedly halted plans to resume IPL 2025, originally scheduled to end on May 25, after a security scare during the Punjab Kings vs Delhi Capitals match.Meanwhile, Indian defence forces remain on high alert, with many drone threats neutralised promptly.","Former Indian cricketer Shikhar Dhawan takes to social media to criticise Pakistan's latest ceasefire violation.

Former India cricketer Venkatesh Prasad has made a scathing attack on Pakistan for ""violating"" the ceasefire agreement just hours after agreeing to end the military confrontation.The violation came despite a formal ceasefire agreement being jointly announced earlier in the day by both nations. Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri confirmed that the Directors-General of Military Operations (DGMOs) from both sides had agreed to cease all hostilities — whether by land, air, or sea — with immediate effect.External Affairs Minister Dr S.Jaishankar also confirmed the ceasefire. “India and Pakistan have worked out an understanding on the stoppage of firing and military action,” he said. “India has consistently maintained a firm and uncompromising stance against terrorism in all its forms and manifestations — and it will continue to do so.”However, in a stunning turnaround, explosions rocked Srinagar by the evening, prompting a red alert and widespread blackouts across Jammu & Kashmir. Simultaneously, Indian Air Defence forces intercepted and shot down Pakistani drones in Rajasthan’s Pokhran and Kashmir’s Baramulla, further escalating tensions.Taking to X, formerly known as Twitter, Prasad called out Pakistan's instability. He said: ""That country has three power centers- The Army, The ISI and the Prime Minister. It’s virtually impossible for all 3 to agree on a thing even if one of them does.""He further added that the last three days of the hostile tension were not enough and India should teach Pakistan a lesson.""The last three days weren’t enough, with this provocation, India will teach Pakistan a lesson of a lifetime.""Tensions between India and Pakistan have sharply escalated following the terrorist attack in Pahalgam on April 22, which claimed the lives of 26 people, mostly tourists. In response to this brutal attack, India launched Operation Sindoor on May 7, targeting and striking nine terrorist bases deep inside Pakistan.",Former India cricketer Venkatesh Prasad criticises Pakistan for 'violating' ceasefire agreement just hours after agreeing to end military confrontation.

IPL 2025 suspended: What happens next?

Foreign players jittery

Teams evacuated with ‘utmost secrecy’

Other domestic leagues also impacted

Mumbai: The remainder of IPL-2025 has been suspended for a week amid heightened tensions between India and Pakistan. The decision followed a meeting of the IPL governing council and was taken in consultation with the Indian government.In a statement issued on Friday, BCCI secretary Devajit Saikia said, “The BCCI has decided to suspend the remainder of the ongoing IPL with immediate effect for one week.Further updates regarding the new schedule and venues will be announced in due course after a comprehensive assessment of the situation in consultation with relevant authorities and stakeholders.“The decision was taken by the IPL governing council after due consultation with all key stakeholders, including most franchisees who conveyed the concerns and sentiments of their players, as well as the views of the broadcaster, sponsors, and fans.“While the BCCI reposes full faith in the strength and preparedness of our armed forces, the board considered it prudent to act in the collective interest of all stakeholders.”A franchise official told TOI, “The BCCI has formally shared with us that the suspension will currently be for one week — during this time, the situation will be reviewed.”At this point, it is unclear whether the tournament will resume in India or abroad. The UAE, traditionally a fallback host, appears to be ruled out as the Pakistan Cricket Board announced that the remainder of the Pakistan Super League will be moved there. It later emerged, however, that the PSL may not get to relocate there.“Give the BCCI some time to decide,” said a top board official. “The easier option was to cancel or indefinitely postpone the IPL, but the BCCI, in consultation with the government, has taken a bold stand to resume the league soon.“Cancelling or delaying it indefinitely would’ve sent the wrong signal — that we are intimidated by the enemy and unsure of our own security capabilities.”In a strongly worded statement, the BCCI added, “At this critical juncture, the BCCI stands firmly with the nation. We express our solidarity with the government of India, the armed forces and the people of our country. The board salutes the bravery, courage, and selfless service of our armed forces, whose heroic efforts under Operation Sindoor continue to protect and inspire the nation, as they lead a resolute response to the recent terrorist attacks and the unwarranted aggression by Pakistan’s armed forces.“While cricket remains a national passion, there is nothing greater than the nation — its sovereignty, integrity, and security. The BCCI remains fully committed to supporting all efforts that safeguard India and will always align its decisions with the best interests of the nation.”Earlier in the day, the BCCI had informed franchises about the temporary suspension of the IPL. Many foreign players became uneasy after Thursday night’s developments, which saw Pakistan attacking areas close to the border, and expressed a desire to return home. The vulnerability of the tournament became clear when the match between Punjab Kings and Delhi Capitals at the HPCA Stadium in Dharamshala was abandoned midway for security reasons.The players and support staff of both teams, as well as the broadcast crew, were evacuated with “utmost secrecy” as the airport had been shut.The IPL suspension has now led to suspensions of other state leagues. On Friday, the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) announced the postponement of its Bengal Pro T20 League Season 2. The Mumbai league, scheduled to begin on May 26, also faces uncertainty.“The situation is very unpredictable,” a source told TOI.",The remainder of IPL-2025 has been suspended for a week amid heightened tensions between India and Pakistan.

Explained: Why Rohit Sharma retired from Test cricket

NEW DELHI: Former Indian cricketer Virender Sehwag took a sharp dig at Pakistan following its violation of the ceasefire agreement on Saturday. Despite agreeing to a truce with India just hours earlier, Pakistan reportedly targeted multiple locations in India.Taking to his official handle on X (formerly Twitter), Sehwag shared a photo featuring the Hindi idiom: ""k**e ki dum tedi ki tedi hi rehti hai,"" a popular saying that implies some things never change, no matter the effort made.What makes this attack particularly significant is that it came just after Pakistan itself reached out to India earlier in the day, proposing a full ceasefire across land, air, and sea-a move later confirmed by ministry of external affairs.US President Donald Trump also announced the development on his Truth Social, said: “After a long night of talks mediated by the United States, I am pleased to announce that India and Pakistan have agreed to a FULL AND IMMEDIATE CEASEFIRE. Congratulations to both Countries on using Common Sense and Great Intelligence.”Despite the ceasefire agreement, India continues to deal with persistent drone attacks from Pakistan.However, most of these threats have been neutralised by India’s air defence systems.The tension is constantly escalating as India’s strong retaliatory strike —‘ Operation Sindoor ’—launched on May 7, targeting terror camps in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.This operation was a direct response to the April 22 terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir's Pahalgam, in which 26 people, mostly tourists, lost their lives in a Pakistan-backed assault.","Former Indian cricketer Virender Sehwag took a sharp dig at Pakistan following its violation of the ceasefire agreement on Saturday.

MUMBAI: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) will consult all the stakeholders over the next two days and seek government nod before resuming IPL 2025 , BCCI secretary Devajit Saikia told TOI on Saturday. Even though US President Donald Trump announced the ceasefire between India and Pakistan on Saturday, the on-ground situation was still fluid, with Pakistan violating the ceasefire later in the day.""The BCCI suspended the IPL yesterday for a period of seven days, and, today, we are on the second day with five more days left.The BCCI is closely monitoring the evolving situation and developments, and will take a call on IPL resumption after consulting all stakeholders of IPL and the concerned Government authorities,"" Saikia said.He then told this paper: ""In the next 48 hours, we will begin consultations with the franchises, broadcasters, sponsors and the state associations slated to host the remaining matches before crystallizing to a decision on the league's resumption. Given the importance of IPL at this juncture, it will also be prudent and necessary to take the nod of the Government of India before finalising the time for its restart. BCCI will duly announce the date of IPL restart once the whole process is over in due course of time.""The BCCI is likely to hold a meeting of its IPL Governing Council on Sunday on when and how to resume the remainder of the IPL 2025. Informally, the BCCI has informally sounded out the franchises about restarting the IPL in a week’s time.""It will be resumed soon, ASAP,"" is how a franchise official put it, though another said, ""not before next Friday,"" which means it's likely that it will be resumed from the next weekend.It's also likely that venues in the south like Bengaluru, Chennai and Hyderabad, and in the west like Mumbai and Ahmedabad, host the 16 remaining IPL 2025 matches. The tournament was suspended on Friday for a week due to heightened tensions between India and Pakistan. The BCCI is set to soon get a nod from the Indian government to resume the tournament.The difficult part of resuming the IPL quickly in the current environment, is of course that plenty of foreign players, who have left for their homes, may not return for the rest of the season. ""Apart from the Australian and South African players involved in the World Test Championship final at Lord's in London (from June 11-15), the others will return,"" a franchise official said. It's clear that with Sunrisers Hyderabad out of the race for a playoffs berth, Australian captain Pat Cummins and opener Travis Head may not return for the rest of the league.A total of 57 matches had been completed in IPL 2025. The 58th match was going on May 8 between Punjab Kings (PBKS) and Delhi Capitals (DC) in Dharamsala, which was called off after 10.1 overs of play on security grounds. A decision will also be taken by the IPL GC on whether that match would be replayed or resumed from the point where it was abandoned.There are 12 league matches remaining, followed by the four playoffs.

Rohit Sharma’s last press conference as a captain

NEW DELHI: Several former cricketers, including West Indies great Brian Lara, have urged Virat Kohli to reconsider his reported decision to retire from Test cricket. According to TOI reports , Kohli has conveyed his desire to step away from the longest format of the game—a development that has sent ripples through the Indian cricketing community.But what does Test cricket mean to Kohli?In a video going viral on social media, Kohli—who has played 123 Tests and scored 9,230 runs at an average of 46.85—opened up about how much the format means to him.""You need to be honest with yourself. I mean, you know, Test cricket is tough. I mean, even when you're one of the top teams in the world or probably the best test team in the world over the last few years, you can still go into a space where you probably don't want it. You know, at certain stages, you feel like, for five days, do I want to do this again? So you really need to be absolutely honest with yourself. Are you ready for the hard grind? Are you ready to wake up on day three when things are absolutely stacked up against you, when you know that you are in trouble? You know, as a batting unit, are you going out there to get that 100 or get that 150 for your team? You know it's going to be tough. You probably have to do it for five, six hours over a period of two days. Are you strong enough to do that? If you told me I had to walk away from this game tomorrow, I can walk away without any regrets. Because everything that I've done since I entered the Indian cricket team has always been for the team, has always been from the point of view, how can I improve this environment that I'm a part of?"" Kohli said.""The reason why I reach out to these guys is because I don't want them to waste probably months and years of my life that I wasted as a youngster still trying to figure things out when I found out the formula for success and what it means to compete at this level,"" he added.""I want these guys to pick it up early so that the transition with Indian cricket can be very smooth. It should not take youngsters two and three years after the seniors are gone to build the team again. So I want them up to speed immediately when we are, you know, almost about to step out and Indian cricket stays on top of,"" Kohli said.Since making his Test debut in 2011, Kohli has played a pivotal role in India's red-ball resurgence. Renowned for his aggressive leadership, consistent batting, and fierce competitiveness, he transformed India into a formidable Test unit both at home and abroad.With over 9,000 runs and 30 centuries in the format, Kohli’s contribution to Test cricket has been nothing short of monumental.","Virat Kohli reportedly plans to retire from Test cricket.

Explained: Why Rohit Sharma retired from Test cricket

NEW DELHI: Cricket legend Brian Lara has come out strongly in support of Virat Kohli, amid reports suggesting the Indian superstar may be contemplating retirement from Test cricket.On Saturday, the West Indian great expressed firm confidence that Kohli will continue to play the longest format, insisting that his presence is vital for the game's future.“Test cricket needs Virat!! He is going to be persuaded. He is NOT going to retire from Test cricket,” Lara wrote in a passionate Instagram post, accompanied by a picture of him with Kohli. “@virat.kohli is going to average above 60 for the remainder of his Test career,” he added, expressing faith in the 36-year-old’s enduring class and motivation.The comments came in the wake of a TimesofIndia.com report revealing that Kohli has privately expressed his intention to step away from Tests — a potential decision that has stirred strong reactions from fans and cricketing voices alike.Since his debut in 2011, Kohli has amassed 9230 runs at an average of 46.85 in 123 Test matches, including 30 centuries. His influence on Indian red-ball cricket — both as captain and senior batter — has been transformative.While Kohli is yet to make an official announcement, Lara’s endorsement reflects the sentiments of many who hope the Indian talisman stays the course.With Rohit Sharma and Ravichandran Ashwin having recently retired from Test cricket, Kohli’s continued presence is seen as crucial in a transitioning Indian side.

Explained: Why Rohit Sharma retired from Test cricket

The top-order:

Poll Should KL Rahul bat at No. 4 in the upcoming Test series? Depends on the other selections. No, he should open. Yes, he is the best option.

Middle-order:

The all-rounders:

The wicketkeepers:

Specialist spin:

The quicks:

Probable squad and reserves pool:

With India's two stalwarts moving away from Test cricket, a stern test awaits Ajit Agarkar-led men's senior selection committee and head coach Gautam Gambhir. Rohit Sharma's retirement and Virat Kohli's impending announcement now presents the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) with no option but to build a Test squad keeping the next World Test Championship cycle in mind, which begins with the tour of England next month.The leadership seems to be going as per plan, at least for now, with Shubman Gill getting the backing but it's the other pieces which need to fall in place for India to return to dominant ways in the longest format. Rohit opens up a spot at top of the order but it's the middle-order, expected to get thinner with Kohli's exit, which looks very unstable and needs a lot of attention.Termed as the ""crisis man"" and ""Mr. Adaptable"", KL Rahul could well be the crucial piece in the batting order as he has enough experience now and will finally have a place in the settled lineup. The bigger question, however, is where does he bat?Rahul started the Australia tour as an opener, moved to No. 3 for the Boxing Day Test and was back at top for the final Test at the Sydney Cricket Ground. While such movement now is unlikely, the think tank needs to take the call of where they want him to bat. Opening would have been a no-brainer when Rohit called it a day but with now Kohli also unlikely to travel to England, Rahul in the middle-order - at No.4 - could well be the glue which Team India needs to hold the batting together.Considering KL Rahul bats in the middle, these are the potential candidates who are making a strong case for themselves for selection:Yashasvi Jaiswal is an automatic selection and Sai Sudharsan is making the right noise with the bat in the last 12 months. He is rated very highly, has good technique and more importantly, holds game awareness and big match temperament. Even the strike-rate demands of the shortest format hasn't affected him and he continues to elevate his game and strike-rate every season without losing shape.Abhimanyu Easwaran could well be the backup opener again as he hasn't done anything wrong since the Australia tour to not find a spot in the squad. No.3 is Shubman Gill for the near future but it's about time he proves his worth away from home and puts all the debates to rest. The returns weren't encouraging in Australia but the England series is a golden opportunity for the right-hander.This is an area which needs a lot of attention and direction for the future. Kohli will not be there at No. 4 so it makes a lot of sense for KL Rahul to be that glue in the middle-order and have the likes of Rishabh Pant, Nitish Kumar Reddy and one between Devdutt Padikkal and Shreyas Iyer to bat around him. Padikkal has been in the Test scheme of things and Iyer could be in line for a recall to the whites, considering the paucity of options.If not a direct India call, it will be a no-brainer to have Iyer travel with the India A team and be ready for the opportunity whenever it comes his way. He hasn't put a foot wrong, across formats, since the central contract issue and has become the mainstay for India's middle-order in ODIs. There are a lot of narratives around his short-ball game but he could well solve those middle-order woes in Tests. He has only played three overseas Tests in his career so far and the success for Mumbai in the Ranji Trophy should make a strong case for his return to Indian whites.England by no means will serve turners to the Indian cricket team but more than their bowling, India could use batting of the three spinning all-rounders in Ravindra Jadeja, Axar Patel and Washnington Sundar. Jadeja should be an automatic selection for his batting and bowling both but Axar and Washington's batting could help at least one, if not both, find a spot in the squad.Axar has elevated his batting several notches in the last few years and Washington too has got the preference for his temperament with the bat. As far as the seam-bowling all-rounder is concerned, Nitish Kumar Reddy is the front-runner, in fact the only runner, for the spot.Continuity will be maintained here with both Pant and Dhruv Jurel making the cut. Jurel was very close to playing in Australia as a specialist batter and it will not be a surprise if the management considers that option in England too.Kuldeep Yadav is a no-brainer for the specialist spinner spot. He has mostly played at home in his Test career but with Ashwin calling it a day in Australia, the chinaman is set to get more chances abroad and that X-factor to the bowling attack.Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammed Shami, Mohammed Siraj, Akash Deep, Prasidh Krishna and Harshit Rana are front-runners to be in the mix but Arshdeep Singh, Khaleel Ahmed and Yash Dayal will present a happy headache to the selectors. There is an option in Mukesh Kumar too and it remains to be seen whether the management adds a left-arm option in the mix.Keeping the workload in mind, five-six seamers could be part of the main squad and there could be two-three travelling reserves too. Shami hasn't played Test cricket in a very long time and Bumrah too will be undergoing the long grind for the first time since the SCG Test vs Australia earlier this year.Yashasvi Jaiswal, Sai Sudharsan, Shubman Gill (C), KL Rahul, Rishabh Pant (WK), Ravindra Jadeja, Nitish Kumar Reddy, Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammed Shami, Mohammed Siraj, Washington Sundar, Axar Patel, Abhimanyu Easwaran, Devdutt Padikkal, Shreyas Iyer, Dhruv Jurel (WK), Harshit Rana, Prasidh Krishna, Akash Deep, Arshdeep Singh, Khaleel Ahmed/Yash Dayal, Mukesh Kumar",Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli have both retired from Test cricket. India are expected to name a Test squad for the tour of England next month. The middle- order looks very unstable and needs a lot of attention.

Checkout the UAE scorecard:

In an unprecedented incident at the Women’s T20 World Cup Asia Qualifier 2025 in Bangkok, all ten batters from the UAE side retired out in their group-stage match against Qatar on Saturday.Playing at the Terdthai Cricket Ground , UAE openers Theertha Satish and captain Esha Oza gave their side a blistering start, piling up 90 runs without loss by the 10-over mark.Oza struck a breathtaking 113 off just 55 balls (14 fours, 5 sixes), while Satish made 74 off 42 deliveries. The duo retired after 16 overs with the team score at 192/0.What followed was one of the most bizarre scorecards in T20 history — every other UAE batter, ten in total, retired out at the start of the 17th over, eight of them without facing a single ball. The move was reportedly a strategy to accelerate the game due to a looming rain threat.Despite the odd innings ending, the UAE bowlers kept things routine in the second half. Qatar crumbled for just 29 in 11.1 overs, with only Rizpha Emmanuel (20) reaching double digits. Seven Qatari batters were dismissed for ducks.Michelle Botha led the UAE bowling effort with 3/11, while all five other bowlers chipped in with wickets.While the UAE registered a massive 163-run victory, it was the scorecard of ten 'retired outs' that stole the headlines — a rare sight in international cricket.","All ten batters from the UAE side retired out in their group-stage match against Qatar on Saturday.

Explained: Why Rohit Sharma retired from Test cricket

Rohit Sharma’s Final Test Practice: Exclusive Farewell Visuals

Poll Which format do you think Rohit Sharma excelled in the most? T20 cricket One Day Internationals Test cricket

Former England captain Michael Atherton has assessed Rohit Sharma 's Test career following the Indian skipper's retirement from the format after 67 Tests spanning 11 years. Rohit announced his retirement on May 7, ahead of India's upcoming England tour that marks the start of their ICC World Test Championship 2025-27 cycle from June 20.Rohit concluded his Test career with 4,301 runs at an average of 40.57, including 12 centuries and 18 fifties.His highest score of 212 came against South Africa in 2019, finishing as India's 16th-highest run-getter in Tests.""I think people will look at him and his best format is ODI cricket. He is going to go down as one of the greatest ODI openers, is he not? But a funny Test career. He had to wait for a long time to get in and then almost a career of two halves in Test cricket, averaging just a tick over 40 in the end with a dozen hundreds, means it is a successful record, but not quite a stellar record,"" Atherton said on Sky Sports Cricket Podcast.Rohit's Test journey began with an impressive 177 against the West Indies at Eden Gardens, Kolkata in 2013. Between 2013-18, he played 27 Tests, scoring 1,585 runs at an average of 39.63, with three centuries and 10 fifties in 47 innings.The right-handed batsman initially struggled in overseas conditions, particularly in South Africa, England, New Zealand, and Australia (SENA countries). However, he revived his Test career as an opener with two centuries against South Africa at Visakhapatnam in 2019.During the ICC World Test Championship era, Rohit featured in 40 Tests, accumulating 2,716 runs at an average of 41.15, with nine centuries and eight fifties. He ranks as India's highest run-scorer and century-maker in WTC history, and stands tenth among overall run-getters.Atherton questioned the timing of Rohit's retirement decision, noting his recent poor form of just 164 runs in his final eight Tests with one fifty.""Was that retirement completely his own decision, or did he get a sense that he's about to be pushed, or the axe was coming because there was a report, the day before the announcement from Rohit, that the selectors had decided to move on,"" Atherton said.""So that is speculation, we do not know, but ultimately the decision did not come as a surprise because it is a bad combination for any captain, as you know, and as I know well if you are losing games, and you are not getting any runs, and India had lost 5 out of the last 6 matches under Rohit's captaincy. Three against New Zealand and a couple in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, and his form had really tailed off, and of course, that is a bad combination for any captain,"" Atherton added.","Former England captain Michael Atherton assesses Rohit Sharma's Test career.

Manchester City 's hopes of securing a Champions League berth took a minor hit on Saturday after a frustrating 0-0 draw with relegated Southampton at St Mary's Stadium. Despite dominating possession and registering 26 shots — only five of which were on target — City failed to find the net, even with star striker Erling Haaland back in action.The draw leaves Pep Guardiola's side third in the Premier League table, four points clear of sixth-placed Nottingham Forest, who still have a game in hand.City missed the opportunity to draw level with Arsenal on 67 points, as their title defence continues to fade following a difficult winter period Guardiola has called his “most challenging season in 16 years.”While Champions League qualification remains likely, City's inability to break down a struggling Southampton side raised questions about their attacking edge. Saints, who had taken just two points from their previous 11 matches, did manage to avoid an unwanted record — moving to 12 points for the season and thereby eclipsing Derby's all-time low of 11 from the 2007/08 campaign.Elsewhere, Brentford and Brighton boosted their European ambitions. Brentford edged Ipswich 1-0 thanks to Kevin Schade's 11th league goal, moving into eighth place, a position that may offer a route into Europe. Brighton, level on points with Brentford, beat Wolves 2-0 with goals from Danny Welbeck and Brajan Gruda.Everton secured Premier League survival with a spirited 3-1 comeback against Fulham.Meanwhile, Aston Villa, Newcastle, and Liverpool will look to keep their Champions League hopes alive across the weekend, with Villa hosting Bournemouth and Newcastle set to face Chelsea. Liverpool's high-stakes clash against Arsenal could further shake up the top-five race.","Manchester City held to 0-0 draw by Southampton at St Mary's Stadium.

Nick Cassidy shares glimpses of his podium win and personal life



Nick Cassidy was a relieved man as he stood on the third spot on the podium at the Monaco E-Prix Round 7 on Sunday. The Jaguar TCS Racing driver confessed he was actually “jumping up and down” on the inside as he reached the podium for the first time this season. However, it is his third consecutive podium at the Monaco E-Prix, his home race. A day after the race, Cassidy made multiple attempts to at least share a post to mark his first Formula E win of the year before finally dropping a bunch of stunning pictures on his Instagram page.Nick Cassidy shared a picture of himself holding the trophy at the Monaco E-Prix Round 7 on Instagram on Monday, along with several stunning pictures of his family and more. He wrote, “Not on here much these days.. No other way around it - been a super tough start to the year and it’s great to have an awesome Podium in Monaco with @jaguarracing. 3 years in a row on the steps at home is super special. Thanks to all those in my corner.”Just before dropping the post, he took to his Instagram Stories to share a screenshot of his many attempts at making an Instagram post to assure his followers that he was trying to share at least one post on the special occasion.Nick had won the Monaco E-Prix once in 2023 when he was racing for Envision Racing and had taken the second podium spot in 2024 with Jaguar TCS Racing.

Oliver Rowland couldn’t translate his pole into victory in Monaco Round 7





There is no stopping Oliver Rowland , who had double gains at the recently held Monaco E-Prix double-header and is “really pleased” with his position in Round 7. The Nissan driver won Round 6 and had said, “Normally you’d be looking forward to the champagne, but you’ve already got one eye on tomorrow.” He did keep the champagne celebrations under control after his win in Monaco and yielded results with his podium finish the next day.Oliver Rowland had won the pole position and was confidently leading in the first half of the race, but as if the pole curse continues to be in place ever since 2022, he couldn’t manage to cross the finish line first. It was Envision Racing’s Sébastien Buemi who ended his more than six-year-long wait for a win by lifting the winner’s trophy on Day 2 of the Monaco E-Prix. Only António Félix da Costa had managed to translate his pole into a victory at the Formula E Monaco race in 2021.Sharing his take on the Monaco race, Rowland said, “I think honestly when he [Buemi] took his Attack Mode, he knew I had more to do — I think he was trying to back me into the pack, so when I took it, I lost quite a lot. But, first and second here doesn’t get much better, so I’m really, really pleased. We just need to keep pushing. We’ve got Tokyo next week where I was really strong last year, so hopefully we can have a real big push for that double-header and then keep pushing in the right direction.”Many believed Rowland was in his own race as he took a three-second lead in the first half. However, he lunged at the chicane on Lap 21, and it was Buemi who surpassed him at the right time. The Nissan driver's move was later judged over-exuberant by the stewards, forcing him to cede the position to Jean-Éric Vergne in recompense, but the damage cost the DS Penske driver a crack at the race win, as Mahindra Racing's Nyck de Vries and Buemi made it by as Vergne bogged down in avoiding action.Rowland once again gave up the lead to Vergne as he took his final mandatory 50kW, four-wheel drive Attack Mode activation, to use that overlap of extra power and traction to push past Vergne and de Vries on Laps 23 and 24 respectively, for second place at the flag, some four seconds back from Buemi.Also Read: Monaco E-Prix Round 6 winner Oliver Rowland delays celebrations for Round 7: “Normally you’d be looking forward to the champagne but…” Up next is the Tokyo double-header on May 17 and 18.

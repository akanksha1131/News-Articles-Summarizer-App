Akash Deep press conference: On replacing Jasprit Bumrah, message from Gautam Gambhir and more

After Shubman Gill notched up another century and helped India set a towering 608-run target for England’s Bazballers, Indian pacers Mohammed Siraj and Akash Deep made the new ball talk once again, rattling England's top order. The hosts were left reeling at 72 for three in 16 overs at stumps on day four of the second Test at Edgbaston in Birmingham on Saturday.Akash Deep removed the dangerous Ben Duckett and the experienced Joe Root, while Siraj dismissed Zak Crawley with a full outswinger that was caught at backward point.

Coming to Akash, he’s an attacking bowler who constantly asks questions around the stumps. It's a good sign for us to see him charging in like that after returning from injury. Hopefully, he'll replay that Joe Root dismissal on his phone tonight,"" Morkel told reporters after the day’s play.""For me, Mohammed Siraj is a guy I have a lot of respect for. He wears his heart on his sleeve when he bowls.Sometimes he tries too hard, which can lead to inconsistency, but we don’t give him enough credit — he does the dirty work for the team,"" he added.India’s declaration, which came an hour after the tea break, drew criticism from both experts and fans. On-air, Cheteshwar Pujara also said that the team should have declared at least half an hour earlier.Asked about the timing of the declaration, Morkel said: ""We did have a lot of discussions during the day. It’s a good wicket and you can’t really control the weather. We were aiming for 2–3 wickets today, and we managed to get them.""Sharing his thoughts on England's mindset, Morkel added: ""Harry Brook said yesterday that they would go for the chase — we’re in for an exciting day of cricket.""The task for India on the final day is straightforward: take the remaining seven wickets and seal their first-ever Test win at Edgbaston.","India need seven more wickets on the final day, Sunday, to secure their first- ever Test win at Edgbaston.

NEW DELHI: In a record-shattering spectacle at Edgbaston, Team India , led by Shubman Gill , scripted history by becoming the first Indian side to surpass 1,000 runs in a single Test match, achieving a monumental aggregate of 1,014 runs across both innings of the second Test against England.It marks only the sixth time in Test history that any team has reached the 1000-run milestone in a match, and it is India’s highest aggregate in Test cricket, eclipsing their previous best of 916 against Australia in Sydney in 2004.Team India now joins an elite group that includes the likes of England (1930), Australia (1934 & 1969), Pakistan (2006), and South Africa (1939) in the fabled ""1000-club"".India’s aggregate of 1,849 runs in the first two Tests of this series is now the highest by any team in the first two matches of a Test series, underlining their batting dominance and setting the tone for a series to remember.India’s total came from scores of 587 all out in the first innings and 427/6 declared in the second, setting England a gargantuan target of 608 — the second-highest India have ever set in a fourth innings and the second-highest England have been asked to chase at home.This historic feat was built on the back of stellar batting performances. In the first innings, captain Shubman Gill led the way with a masterful 269, ably supported by Ravindra Jadeja (89) and Washington Sundar (42). Earlier, Yashasvi Jaiswal’s 87 and Karun Nair’s 31 had laid the foundation after a shaky start.England fought back through a sensational 303-run stand between Harry Brook (158) and Jamie Smith (184*), but Mohammed Siraj (6/70) and Akash Deep (4/88) turned the game with the new ball, bundling England out for 407.India then launched a blistering counterattack. Gill (161) and Jadeja (69*) struck again in the second innings, while Rishabh Pant (65) and KL Rahul (55) delivered quickfire cameos to push India’s total past the 1000-mark before declaring.","Team India become the first Indian side to surpass 1,000 runs in a single Test match.

Poll Do you believe records in youth cricket are important for a player's future? Yes, they set a benchmark. No, they don’t mean much.

Fourteen-year-old batting sensation Vaibhav Suryavanshi smashed a jaw-dropping century off just 52 balls against England U-19, setting a new benchmark in Youth ODI cricket. Playing for the India U-19 team, the young batter showed remarkable composure and fearless strokeplay to reach three figures in record time.With this explosive knock, Vaibhav has become the youngest Indian to score a Youth ODI century, breaking Sarfaraz Khan’s decade-old record. Sarfaraz had scored a ton at 15 years and 338 days against South Africa U-19 in 2013. Vaibhav’s achievement also makes him the youngest centurion in Youth ODIs globally, surpassing Bangladesh’s Najmul Hossain Shanto, who made a century at 14 years and 241 days in 2013.Rajasthan Royals batter Vaibhav’s blitz also shattered the record for the fastest Youth ODI century ever. Pakistan’s Kamran Ghulam previously held this record for his 53-ball hundred against England U-19 in 2013. For India, Raj Angad Bawa’s 69-ball century against Uganda in the 2022 U-19 World Cup was the fastest before Vaibhav’s knock.Vaibhav first showcased his incredible talent in the IPL while playing for the Rajasthan Royals. He grabbed headlines when he hammered a breathtaking hundred in just 35 balls, announcing himself as one of the most exciting young batters to watch out for.With this performance, Vaibhav Suryavanshi has sent out a clear message that Indian cricket’s future looks promising with young talents like him ready to step up on the big stage.","Fourteen-year-old Vaibhav Suryavanshi smashed a century off just 52 balls against England U-19.

Poll Do you think Shubman Gill will score another double hundred in the remaining Tests? Yes, absolutely Possibly, if conditions are right Unlikely, but not impossible No way

TimesofIndia.com in Birmingham: One couldn't complain when Shubman Gill fumbled while raising the bat on his way back to the change room. He was a tired man, and having raised the blade eight times in a Test match is no ordinary feat. He walked back to the hut to thundering applause from the Indian dressing room and fans, which, however, was preceded by the loud chants of ""Boring. .. Boring India"" from the notorious Eric Hollies Stand, taking a dig at India's tactics of delaying the declaration.Gill was dismissed for a 162-ball 161, laced with 13 boundaries and eight sixes, and his sublime knock was anything but boring. Even the Englishmen seemed happy to let him bat as they repeatedly failed to spot the ball in the outfield. It was a special knock, followed by the marathon 269-run outing in the first essay of the Edgbaston Test.For a cricketer obsessed with his batting, it was a dream outing for Gill in Birmingham, as he became the only batter to cross 250 and 150 in the same Test. He broke Virat Kohli 's record, bettered Sunil Gavaskar 's tally in a single match, and was within striking distance of Graham Gooch 's 456 vs India at Lord's in 1990. The 25-year-old's aggregate of 430 will be remembered for a very long time because it came at a time when the spotlight only increased on the youngster.The Test captaincy, woeful record away from home, and under-par outings Down Under last year meant the stakes were higher than usual, and Gill ensured he went all in as far as his preparations were concerned. He was hell-bent on not repeating Australia in the Test assignments to follow, even before getting a wind about the captaincy.It was about Gill the batter, who switched to red-ball mode while the Indian Premier League (IPL) was underway. Every now and then, he would train with the red Dukes with his good friend Khushpreet Singh Aulakh and other net bowlers of the franchise. What started as getting a feel of the shining red cherry turned into full-fledged sessions once Gujarat Titans' (GT) tournament ended in Chandigarh, as he spent hours under the sun getting his technique right before boarding the flight to the United Kingdom.For Gill, it wasn't restricted to getting a feel of the ball but finding the joy all over again and working on the initial movement and the overall set-up. In a chat with the broadcaster after his 269-run knock, the skipper spoke at length about the changes he made to his batting and the changes which were also noticed by batting coach Sitanshu Kotak. India's batting coach credited the youngster for finding his own way during the break, and it has been paying rich returns so far.The friendly batting conditions have helped him find top gear, but the old problem of the front foot falling far too across is no longer there in his set-up, and the bat comes down very close to the pad, leaving no gap for the ball to sneak through. The strides are positive, and the alignment of his head right over the impact point of bat and ball has allowed him to maintain balance and get into proper positions.Quiz: Who's that IPL player? Apart from the technical adjustments, it's the mental aspect which has allowed him to concentrate longer for the marathon knocks he played in Edgbaston.""I was scoring 30-35-40 runs consistently in Test matches. But at some point, I was missing that peak concentration time. A lot of people say that when you focus too much, you sometimes miss your peak time. So, in this series, I tried to go back to my basics. I tried to bat like I used to in my childhood. I didn’t think about having reached 35-40 runs or about playing long innings. I just wanted to enjoy my batting,"" Gill had said.The changes were acknowledged and applauded by his father, Lakhwinder Singh Gill, who was reminded of the right-hander's early days. He was not satisfied because a triple hundred was there for the taking.""You were batting like in your U-16 and U-19 days — I felt very proud,"" said Gill’s father in a voice message shared by the BCCI.585 runs in just four innings, featuring one hundred, one 150+, and one double hundred, is a terrific start to the series, and both Gill and the Indian cricket team would hope the runs continue to flow from their skipper's bat in rest of the Tests.Score at stumps, Day 4: India 587 & 427/6 decl. vs England 407 & 72/3 (16 overs) – England need 536 runs.","Shubman Gill scored 430 runs in the first Test at Edgbaston. The 25-year-old became the only batter to cross 250 and 150 in the same Test. He also broke Virat Kohli's record, bettered Sunil Gavaskar's tally in a single match.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122270971,imgsize-761585,width-400,resizemode-4/122270971.jpg"

India’s dominance in the second Test against England has not only left fans in awe but also lit up the internet with a fresh wave of memes.After Shubman Gill ’s explosive 161 and key contributions from KL Rahul (55), Rishabh Pant (65), and Ravindra Jadeja (69 not out), India declared at a mammoth 427/6 in their second innings, setting England a target of 608 runs to win.While the on-field performance was nothing short of ruthless, social media had its own celebration.As soon as the declaration came, fans joked, “We got India declaring before GTA 6,” referencing the much-anticipated video game whose release has been years in the making.The internet quickly turned the scoreboard into a meme-fest.Shubman Gill, who smashed 269 in the first innings, continued his dream run with a whirlwind 161 off 162 balls, including 13 fours and 8 towering sixes.His aggressive partnership with Pant, who scored 65 off just 58 deliveries, left the England bowlers demoralised.Later, Jadeja joined the carnage with a composed unbeaten 69, forging a 175-run stand with his captain to put the game well out of England’s reach.Resuming Day 4 at 64/1, India lost Rahul and Karun Nair early but shifted gears swiftly. By the time the declaration came, India had not only stamped their authority but also entertained fans both on and off the field.With a record target looming and two days left, England now face the monumental task of surviving — or the even more unlikely one of chasing down 608.

Harry Brook press conference: On Yashasvi Jaiswal DRS controversy, India bowling, getting out on 99

Edgbaston saw a light-hearted but telling exchange between England’s centurion Harry Brook and India’s Rishabh Pant on Day 4 of the ongoing Test. With Pant batting fluently alongside Shubman Gill , Brook cheekily reminded Pant that the record for the fastest century in Tests was 55 balls. Pant, with a grin, simply replied, “I’m not greedy for records. If it happens, it happens. ”LIVE Score: India vs England 2nd Test Day 4 True to his words, Pant batted in his trademark fearless style without forcing the pace for milestones. He ended with a lively 65 off 58 balls, studded with eight boundaries and three sixes. More importantly, he stitched together a crucial 100-run stand with Gill, who himself is rewriting records in this series with three centuries, including that epic 269 in the first innings.This knock from Pant showed once again how he never holds back from backing his instincts as India’s fearless wicketkeeper-batter. True to his style, he kept the scoreboard ticking at a brisk pace, but in the process, he did take a risky option that cost him his wicket just as he looked set to push on for an even bigger milestone.Earlier in the series, Pant had hammered two centuries and continues to be India’s middle-order game-changer in red-ball cricket. His ability to lift the scoring rate while respecting the conditions is proving priceless for India in this marathon series against England.At the time of writing, India lead by 564 runs with Shubman Gill approaching 150 and Ravindra Jadeja having completed his half-century.

A late own-goal by goalkeeper Weverton took Chelsea through to the Club World Cup semi-finals on Friday as the Premier League side edged Palmeiras of Brazil 2-1 in a last-eight tie that had been lit up by a moment of magic from young star Estevao Willian.The teenage Brazil forward, who will join Chelsea after the tournament, was eager to impress his future employers and his brilliant 53rd-minute finish cancelled out Cole Palmer's opener in Philadelphia.But a deflected Malo Gusto cross went in off Palmeiras 'keeper Weverton in the 83rd minute to take Chelsea through to a semi-final showdown with another Brazilian side in Fluminense.""In the first half we were in control of the game and could have scored more than one goal,"" said Chelsea coach Enzo Maresca, dismissing suggestions his team had been fortunate.""They started the second half better than us and the dynamic of the game changed, but then in the last 25 minutes we were in control again and I think we deserved to win without being lucky.""The scoreline was a repeat of Chelsea's victory when the teams met in the final of the Club World Cup under the tournament's old guise in 2022.""Overall Chelsea was better. They have better players and a better coach,"" admitted Palmeiras coach Abel Ferreira.""They were lucky with the way they scored the second goal but it can happen in football and we need to accept it and move on.""Chelsea will now be fancied to go on and reach the final, with Fluminense standing in their way in the last four at the MetLife Stadium in New Jersey on Tuesday.If not everyone has yet been won over by the tournament, the intensity levels on the pitch are rising as it reaches the business end and there was a big-game atmosphere in Philadelphia.Lincoln Financial Field was almost sold out, with 65,782 fans in attendance despite much of the city having emptied out for the July 4 holiday and long weekend.This game played out to a backdrop of Independence Day fireworks lighting up the sky over the nearby Delaware River, but there were fireworks on the pitch too.Chelsea lit the spark first, going ahead in the 16th minute thanks to a moment of class from England international Palmer.After drifting into a pocket of space just outside the Palmeiras box, Palmer controlled a Trevoh Chalobah pass on the half-turn, carried on into the area and dispatched a low shot past Weverton.It was the ideal start for Chelsea, who lost to Flamengo when they last faced Brazilian opposition in the same stadium during the group stage.Maresca added extra Brazilian flavour to the occasion by handing a first start to young midfielder Andrey Santos.With Moises Caicedo suspended, Santos occupied the holding midfield role for Chelsea while Pedro Neto lined up on the right wing, choosing to play despite having to come to terms with the tragic death of his Portugal teammate Diogo Jota on Thursday.Playing on the right wing for Palmeiras was Estevao, the 18-year-old Brazil prodigy set to join Chelsea in a big-money transfer agreed over a year ago.He knew this could be his last game for the Sao Paulo side, and Chelsea probably should have been two ahead before the interval only for Christopher Nkunku to blaze over after being teed up by Palmer.Instead Palmeiras equalised eight minutes into the second half, with Estevao the inevitable scorer.Positioned inside the Chelsea box to the right, Estevao controlled a pass by Richard Rios and took a touch to get in front of Levi Colwill, another to steady himself, and then surprised goalkeeper Robert Sanchez with an early shot that went in off the bar.Chelsea responded by sending on new signing Joao Pedro for his debut, the Brazilian becoming the 27th player used by Maresca during the tournament.The Blues pushed in search of a second goal but extra time was looking likely when the Premier League side grabbed a scrappy winner with seven minutes of the 90 to play.Following a corner played short, Enzo Fernandez found Malo Gusto and his attempted low centre from the left side of the box deflected off the toe of Agustin Giay to surprise Weverton, with the ball striking him on its way in.Substitute Hercules struck a 70th-minute winner as Brazil's Fluminense defeated Saudi Arabia's Al Hilal 2-1 on Friday to reach the semi-finals of the Club World Cup.A fine left-foot finish from Matheus Martinelli had put the Rio club ahead in the 40th minute but Al Hilal's Brazilian forward Marcos Leonardo levelled six minutes into the second half before Hercules stole the show to the delight of the vast majority of the 43,091 crowd.Al Hilal had pulled off the biggest upset of the tournament, beating Manchester City 4-3, to reach the last eight and Simone Inzaghi's side fought hard until the end to keep their adventure alive.They bow out of the tournament having been unbeaten through the group stage, including holding Real Madrid to a draw, and having truly made their mark on the world stage.There was a moment's silence before the kick-off in memory of Liverpool and Portugal forward Diogo Jota and his younger brother Andre Silva, who died in the early hours of Thursday after their car veered off a motorway in Spain and burst into flames.Al Hilal's line-up featured two of Jota's Portugal team-mates in Ruben Neves and Joao Cancelo.The first half was a tight and tactical affair with few chances until Martinelli opened the scoring when he picked the ball up from Gabriel Fuentes inside the box and span out to give himself space for a left-foot shot that rocketed past Yassine Bounou.Al Hilal went close to a quick response when Kalidou Koulibaly's header forced Fluminense's 44-year-old goalkeeper Fabio into a fine save.The Saudi side were awarded a penalty when Samuel Xavier was ruled to have brought down Marcos Leonardo in the box but Dutch referee Danny Makkelie was eventually sent to the monitor where he overturned his own decision after seeing there had been no contact between the two players.After going in at the break trailing by a goal, Al Hilal came out strongly for the second half and drew level when Koulibaly headed a Neves corner down to Marcos Leonardo who poked home.Al Hilal's Brazilian full back Renan Lodi had a let off when his poor backpass fell straight at the feet of German Cano but the Fluminense striker's attempt to round Bounou was denied by the smart work of the Moroccan keeper.But the outcome was settled with 20 minutes remaining when half-time sub Hercules saw a shot from distance blocked but from the loose ball Samuel headed the ball back to the forward who raced into the box and fired past Bounou to make it 2-1.Al Hilal produced a flurry of corners and some intense pressure in the final minutes as they desperately sought a way to keep their dream alive but the Brazilians were good value for their victory.""We didn’t have many chances but we made the most of them, the entire group worked and were committed,"" said Fluminense coach Renato Gaucho.""Our fans here in the USA and those in Brazil, they can be proud and I ask them to wear a jersey, in the mall, street, beach, wherever, wear that shirt – they should all be proud to wear that jersey,"" he said.The Fluminense coach was full of praise for the performance of his 40-year-old central defender Thiago Silva who ensured the Brazilians were able to withstand the second half pressure from Al Hilal.""Thiago Silva is huge for us, I worked with him 15 years ago, he is a coach on the pitch, very helpful and conveys calm and experience to the others. He is our captain and a leader and in hard matches like these against big clubs, its important to have people like him. He is key and fundamental,"" he said.Al Hilal coach Inzaghi said his side had been unfortunate to end on the losing side.""It has been a good World Cup for us but clearly we leave with a little bit of a bitter taste in our mouth because after what happened in that second half, we deserved much more,"" he said.""It was a tight match, decided by episodes, as happens in football. Fluminense are very well organised team that are having an excellent tournament,"" he added.",Chelsea beat Palmeiras 2-1 to reach the Club World Cup semi-finals in Philadelphia.

We're all aware of the tragedy. We have two Portugal players Rúben Neves and João Cancelo who were friends to them. Today has been a very difficult day for all of us.

BENGALURU: Former India coach Igor Stimac who was sacked by the All India Football Federation (AIFF) last year and replaced with Manolo Marquez, who stepped down on Wednesday, said he was not surprised to hear that the Spanish gaffer had to leave the job after being in charge of the national team for just eight games.“The AIFF is run badly, without any clear idea on what to and how to do it,” Stimac told TOI. Stimac, who lost his job after India crashed out of the World Cup qualifiers had won a compensation of $ four lakh as compensation as the AIFF sacked him with one year left on his contract.Presenting his arguments on India's downward spiral from a world rank of 102 in 2023 to 127 in 2025, the former Croatian international said Indian players are not improving their skills through tournaments like the Indian Super League “Players are not progressing their game in such leagues like ISL which is without enough game intensity and pressure of results. Also, there's no relega- tion and lack of quality games,” Stimac said.He also said the national team does not get enough time to prepare. “FIFA windows are not long enough for preparation time when facing strong opponents. So the AIFF needs to reschedule the ISL calendar in favour of the national team.”Stimac also said the Indian footballers should come out of their comfort zone. “Unrealistic players’ salaries in ISL are putting players in a comfort zone.

Sebastien Buemi wins third spot on the podium in Jakarta



Sebastien Buemi’s performance in 2025 Formula E season

Coming as major good news for Envision Racing driver Sebastien Buemi, the removal of a time penalty from the last Jakarta race has landed him on the podium. Buemi is now officially promoted to third place, while Nico Mueller, who had originally celebrated a podium alongside Dan Ticktum and Edoardo Mortara at the Jakarta E-Prix, has been moved to fourth.The five-second penalty initially handed to Sebastien Buemi at the Jakarta E-Prix for contact with Mahindra Racing’s Edoardo Mortara was recently overturned following a FIA hearing. Due to the penalty, Buemi had finished eighth in Round 12 of the Jakarta race in June. However, the reversal has now reshaped the podium — much to Mueller’s disappointment.According to FormulaE.com, additional footage from Envision Racing's roll hoop camera, which was not available at the time the penalty was applied, was reviewed in detail. Buemi had received the penalty for an on-track collision with Mortara.The FIA stated: “The driver of Car 16 (Buemi) argued that the new element shows his overtaking manoeuvre was legitimate, that he was always in control of his car, and that when the slight contact occurred, he was fully alongside Car 48 (Mortara).”They further added: “The driver of Car 48 agreed with the assessment and mentioned he barely felt the contact.Upon careful consideration of the circumstances, the Stewards find that no single party bears whole or predominant responsibility for the collision. Therefore, the Stewards decide to reverse Decision 12. As a result, the penalty (i.e., five-second time penalty and one penalty point) on Car 16 is removed, and no further action will be taken in relation to this collision. ”With this update, Buemi moved to 10th in the Formula E Driver Standings with 63 points. In addition to his newly awarded Jakarta podium, he also has one win this season, in the Monaco E-Prix during Round 7.Also Read: Nico Mueller happy with Jakarta podium but adds, “It could have been even better with Jake” Buemi will now head to Berlin for Rounds 13 and 14 of the Formula E season.

With four wins and three additional podiums in 12 rounds, Rowland leads this year’s Driver Standings by a massive margin. As the season nears its conclusion with the Berlin double-header and the London double-header remaining, the Nissan driver is almost certain to lift the championship trophy.Things began to look up for Oliver Rowland after he decided to switch from Mahindra Racing to Nissan last year. This season, he is all set to lift the Formula E World Championship trophy. Although he had a lackluster start in Sao Paulo, he bounced back with his first win of the year in Mexico. Soon after, he secured two podiums in Jeddah, including a win.

What sets the Berlin E-Prix apart

What’s challenging about the Tempelhof Circuit?

Past Berlin E-Prix winners

Season 11 of Formula E is now nearing its close, with four races remaining across two venues. Next up is the Berlin E-Prix, scheduled from July 11–13. Berlin is the only venue to have hosted a Formula E race every season since the championship's inception, making it one of the most special events on the calendar for multiple reasons. It has been held annually without a miss since 2015, and its scenic venue — the historic Tempelhof Airport — adds to its charm. Here are some interesting facts about Rounds 15 and 16 of the Formula E season in Berlin.One look at the Tempelhof circuit explains why the Berlin E-Prix is so special. With imposing aircrafts parked on one side of the barrier and a vast expanse of open space on the other, it’s arguably one of the most picturesque tracks in motorsport.Formula E cars are second only to airplanes when it comes to reaching top speeds — hitting 322 km/h in less than a minute. The most distinctive aspect of the Tempelhof Airport circuit is that it was originally designed for airplanes to take off and land, making it a unique surface for electric racing.The surface of the 2.343 km-long Tempelhof circuit is composed of layered concrete slabs designed for aircraft operations.While it supports Formula E racing, it presents challenges in energy management, tyre wear, and grip. The hot summer temperatures in Berlin can further test the drivers. Despite that, the wide layout, long corners, and even an indoor tunnel make the track exciting and full of overtaking opportunities.The Berlin E-Prix is a home race for DS Penske driver Maximilian Gunther. He won the event in 2020 and secured a third-place finish in 2023. The German driver recently expressed his excitement on Instagram. Reflecting on the Jakarta race, Gunther wrote, “Didn’t go our way this Saturday in Jakarta. Thanks for all the love, Indonesia. Now all eyes on Berlin – my home race.”However, it is TAG Heuer Porsche’s Antonio Felix da Costa who holds the record for the most Berlin E-Prix wins, having triumphed three times — twice in 2020 and once in 2024. Envision Racing’s Sebastien Buemi, Lola Yamaha ABT’s Lucas di Grassi, and TCS Jaguar Racing’s Nick Cassidy have each won the race twice.Also Read: Season 11 Berlin Rookie Test: Formula E teams announce nominations, eligibility rules explained However, this year’s race may see a new winner, as has been the case in several recent Formula E rounds.

Most wonderful shots from Jakarta E-Prix

It was a dusty yet thrilling Formula E race in Jakarta, with the championship returning to Indonesia after two years. Formula E has now shared some of the best videos from the Jakarta E-Prix for fans to relive the Indonesian race again and again. The real footage appears as eye-catching as scenes from a racing movie — complete with synchronized reactions from the audience and ground staff.The shots from the Jakarta E-Prix were shared by Formula E on Instagram with the caption: “Our race in Jakarta would have made a beautiful movie.” The first video is a still camera shot from a turn on the circuit, as the GEN3 Evo cars speed down the track. It is followed by a clip of a Lola Yamaha ABT driver getting into the car ahead of the race. There are also a few shots of the audience and ground staff moving their eyes from one direction to another as the cars race past.The post also includes a glimpse of Cupra Kiro driver Dan Ticktum celebrating his win by standing on his car amid loud cheers from his team members. There are additional shots from different corners of the circuit, each offering a unique visual experience. One clip features Jake Dennis, who, despite securing pole position, was hit by Nyck De Vries during the race — ruining his chances of winning or finishing on the podium.A comment from Mahindra Racing’s Instagram page read: “If Wes Anderson directed FE.” A fan agreed, saying, “Accidentally, the dust and pollution in Jakarta matched with Wes Anderson’s color palette.”One fan reacted to the post, “Love the still camera angle.” Another said, “Ha, it certainly would.” One more wrote, “Straight out of a movie scene!” Another comment read: “I hope this event will still be held in Jakarta next year.

Do front row starts matter in Formula E? Oliver Rowland’s dominance says yes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/formula-e/do-front-row-starts-matter-in-formula-e-oliver-rowlands-dominance-says-yes/articleshow/122142779.cms,"Image credit: Oliver Rowland/Instagram

Formula E drivers with the most front row starts

Does pole position — or a front row start — guarantee a win? Well, in most cases, it does. If not, it at least enables the driver to finish the race on the podium or earn some points to add to their score in the Driver Standings. This season, it’s Nissan’s Oliver Rowland who has clinched five front row starts and is leading the 2025 Formula E Driver Standings. He is far ahead of the competition and is almost certain to have secured the ABB FIA Formula E World Championship title this year.Oliver Rowland is far ahead of the competition at the top of the Formula E Driver Standings with 172 points. He has taken pole twice and started on the front row in three other races this year.There is hardly any scenario in which anyone can beat him in the remaining four races — except one. If Pascal Wehrlein, who is second in the Driver Standings, wins and Rowland fails to score any points, then only can Rowland’s top spot be challenged. However, that is highly unlikely, and Rowland will most probably lift the world championship trophy in London with ease.TAG Heuer Porsche driver Pascal Wehrlein has three front row starts, including two poles.This suggests that front row starts do play a major role in a driver’s chances of a podium finish.Pascal, however, is behind Taylor Barnard, who has delivered the most impressive performance on track this year.

Watch: Extrication practice in Formula E

Every motorsport involves risk, where a single crash can prove life-threatening. Formula E has maintained a strong safety record over its eleven seasons so far. However, as a precautionary measure, Formula E drivers undergo extrication practice once a year to ensure they are familiar with the emergency protocols in case of an incident. Recently, NEOM McLaren driver Sam Bird participated in one such practice session. A glimpse of the session was shared with fans on social media, offering insight into this important aspect of motorsport safety.The video shows Sam Bird acting as an injured driver while the FIA Formula E safety team carefully lifts him out of the car and places him on a stretcher. The procedure is designed to avoid further injury, particularly to the neck or any broken bones.McLaren FE shared the video on Instagram with the caption: “Earlier today, Sam completed his extrication practice with the @fiaformulae safety team. This is an exercise that happens at each race with a different team each time. This is for both the safety of the drivers and the extrication team should an incident occur where the driver would need assistance exiting the car. Each driver has to do this at least once a year to ensure their own safety.Some fans were momentarily alarmed upon seeing the video. One commented, “Goodness grief — not me watching the first few seconds of this without context.” Another said, “That scared me there for a second.”In general, fans appreciated the behind-the-scenes look at Formula E's extrication protocol. “Never seen the neck wrap/support before, very neat,” wrote one. Another added, “Much love to the safety teams, always prepared and always do an incredible job.” A third said, “Awesome to see, safety above all.” One fan even joked, “An FIA-mandated nap sounds quite nice.”Also Read: Who is Sam Bird’s girlfriend Jess Impiazzi?

Poll What do you think about the decision to suspend the match due to fading light? It was the right call. They should have continued playing.

Fighting win for Bhambri-Jiang pair

Ben Shelton was to serve for the Wimbledon second-round match against Aussie Rinky Hijikata late on Thursday evening when play was suspended at 9.29pm. Natural light was fading, and in five minutes would have been insufficient for Electronic Line Calling (ELC), now a thing at SW19.The American, armed with a sledgehammer serve, tried to plead his case. He asked for 60 seconds, but the officials were firm, even though he hadn’t dropped serve in the match. What if? Shelton and Hijikata wanted play to be stopped earlier in the evening because of the light, but their requests had been shot down.On Friday, it took the strapping 10th seed all of 70 seconds to close out the match. It wasn’t a I-told-you-so show, but it might as well have been. Shelton served three aces to seal a 6-2, 7-5, 6-4 win in two hours and 12 minutes on a sparky afternoon on Court No. 2.In the third round on Saturday, Shelton will play Hungary’s Marton Fucsovics, who survived a five-setter against Gael Monfils in the second round, which was also completed on Friday.The 22-year-old Shelton, the highest seed remaining in his section of the draw after the seventh seed Lorenzo Musetti fell in the first round, was quick to reset and roll.“It’s normal, it’s part of tennis. Everything is not going to be the same whether it is weather (or) conditions,” he said, adding, “I’m just happy with the way I handled it, coming out today and taking care of my business. I don’t think that physically it is a big deal for me playing one game.”Shelton playing only his third Wimbledon, having made the second week of The Championships last year, returned to court for a second successive day, committed to play, despite the match running on loop in his head the previous evening.“You’re thinking about what you did, what you could have done, how you could have been off the court, what you’re going to do when you get back out there,” he said, adding that he couldn’t relax after getting back home. “What’s my game plan going to be for that one service game to make sure that I hold?”Shelton wanted to make first serves, he was determined not to give his opponent a look at his second serves. “I had a calculated approach with how I was going about my service game. I wasn’t going for four aces, the first serve was supposed to be forehand body, it ended up being an ace,” he said.“Once I get my first ace in a service game, my confidence goes through the roof. After that I started going for aces and abandoned the plan we had,” Shelton added.Confidence was the trigger for the final ace, which kicked at 147 mph. Hijikata applauded his opponent. “You can pick your return spots or guess all you want, but when he is serving 145 (mph) or whatever it is, I could have guessed right, still probably not got a racquet on it,” the Aussie said. “That was an absolute clinic on how to serve out a match if you got one game to go.”Shelton followed Naomi Osaka onto Court No. 2 on Friday, where the Japanese, a four-time major winner, bowed out to Russia’s Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova 6-3, 4-6, 4-6 in the third round. In other third round matches, Australian Open champion Madison Keys, seeded six, was bounced out by German Laura Siegemund 6-3, 6-3.Fifth seeded American Taylor Fritz scored a 6-4, 6-3, 6-7 (5), 6-1 to win over the newly married Alejandro Davidovich Fokina. Russian 14th-seed Andrey Rublev put out Frenchman Adrian Mannarino 7-5, 6-2, 6-3 in just under two-hours.Yuki Bhambri and China’s Xinyu Jiang got the better of the all-American pairing of Christian Harrison and Nicole Melichar-Martinez in a roller-coaster mixed doubles first-round match. The Indo-Chinese combine came through 6-3, 1-6, 7-6 (10-6) in one-hour and 44-minutes. Meanwhile Arjun Kadhe and Czech Vit Kopriva, who made the men’s doubles draw as alternates, went down 4-6, 4-6 to the Aussie-American team of Mathew Christopher Romios and Ryan Seggerman.","Ben Shelton served three aces to seal a 6-2, 7-5, 6-4 win in two hours and 12 minutes on Friday.

Carlos Alcaraz battled past Jan-Lennard Struff to reach the Wimbledon last-16 on Friday before women's top seed Aryna Sabalenka dug deep to beat Emma Raducanu in a high-class match. Both players avoided the fate of Australian Open champion and sixth seed Madison Keys, who joined the mass exodus of top seeds.It is only day five of Wimbledon but just four of the top 10 women's seeds remain, with half of the men's top 10 also ousted.Men's second seed Alcaraz eventually overcame German world number 125 Struff 6-1, 3-6, 6-3, 6-4 to stay on track for a third straight Wimbledon crown.But the Spaniard will have to cut out his errors if he is to become just the fifth man in the Open era to perform that feat.""I knew it was going to be really difficult. I had to be really focused. His game suits the grass with the big serves,"" said the 22-year-old.""It's stressful. To be honest, I was suffering in every service game today, 0-30, break points down.""I'm really pleased that I was fighting, running for every ball and making great shots.""Alcaraz, watched by former England captain Gary Lineker and former world heavyweight champion Anthony Joshua, made 28 unforced errors in an inconsistent display on Centre Court.But he conjured enough moments of magic to eventually subdue his opponent and book his place in the fourth round, where he will meet Russia's Andrey Rublev.Alcaraz is yet to show his best form after being pushed to the brink in a five-set win over 38-year-old Italian Fabio Fognini in the first round while he looked below his best again against British amateur Oliver Tarvet.The women's draw is bereft of star names after the departure of a succession of top players.Keys' 6-3, 6-3 defeat by Germany's Laura Siegemund means only world number one Sabalenka is still alive at the All England Club out of the top six women's seeds.Coco Gauff, Jessica Pegula, Jasmine Paolini and Zheng Qinwen have already fallen by the wayside.Sabalenka, last on Centre Court, refused to be cowed by former US Open champion Raducanu, who fed off the energy of a partisan crowd to produce an electric performance under the roof.But the powerful Belarusian won the big points, saving a set point in the first set and staying strong in the second to beat her 40th-ranked opponent 7-6 (8/6), 6-4.Sabalenka is a three-time Grand Slam champion but has never been beyond the semi-finals at Wimbledon.""I had to fight for every point like crazy,"" said Sabalenka, who was impressed by the volume of support for Raducanu.""What an atmosphere,"" she said. ""My ears are still hurting, honestly. It was super loud. Every time you were cheering her, I was trying to tell myself to just pretend that you were just cheering for me. I had goosebumps.""Earlier at the All England Club, Japan's four-time Grand Slam champion Naomi Osaka lost in three sets to Russia's Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova.Osaka has not reached the fourth round of a Grand Slam since she won the Australian Open in 2021 but is still hungry for success.""I feel like while I still have the opportunity to try to do it, I want to, even though I get very upset when I lose, but I think that's my competitive nature. That's also the younger sister syndrome,"" she said.There were also wins for Britain's Sonay Kartal, 13th seed Amanda Anisimova and Elise Mertens.US men's fifth seed Taylor Fritz avoided a third straight five-setter, beating Spain's Alejandro Davidovich Fokina 6-4, 6-3, 6-7 (5/7), 6-1.Britain's Cameron Norrie saw off Italian Mattia Bellucci in straight sets to qualify the quarter-finals for the first time since 2022, when he reached the last four.Highly promising Brazilian teenager Joao Fonseca was ousted by Chilean qualifier Nicolas Jarry.It took US men's 10th seed Ben Shelton just 71 seconds to complete his second-round match, sealing a 6-2, 7-5, 6-4 win against Australia's Rinky Hijikata after the match was halted on Thursday due to failing light.",Carlos Alcaraz battled past Jan-Lennard Struff to reach the Wimbledon last-16.

Following his tragic demise, Premier League clubs, players and teammates shared messages and condolences for Jota's family.The All England Club made a special allowance for Cabral to wear the black ribbon on his shirt sleeve during his second-round doubles match.Cabral, who learned about the news while driving to Wimbledon, shared his thoughts about Jota: ""I know what he's been through, what he conquered through his career and through his life. So he's just very inspiring for me.""""I just wish all the best for his family.

LONDON: It might just be the best deal in all of major professional sports: Tennis fans can get a chance to watch stars such as Carlos Alcaraz compete on Centre Court at Wimbledon by forking over just 15 pounds — about USD 20 at the current exchange rate. That's instead of Friday's price of nearly $220 for the best seats at the grass-court Grand Slam tournament's biggest stadium. Face value there rises as the event goes on, hitting nearly $370 by the end of Week 2, then going up again for the singles finals.The secret to saving so much cash? The official resale service. It allows anyone already on-site with a ticket to sign up via the Wimbledon app for a daily lottery to get into one of the top three courts at a cut rate, including about $13 each for No. 1 Court or No. 2 Court.Those spots are offered up to the All England Club by spectators who leave before play ends.Wimbledon offers cheap tickets to its biggest courts when fans leave early“It's an elite tournament in terms of the players, but it's not elite to get in, which is part of the appeal,” said Ed Hogan, a retired 69-year-old from Reading, which is a little more than an hour west of Wimbledon. “The concept of resales is great.It's recycling at its best — sharing the joy.”The All England Club wouldn't say how many tickets get resold.“We're selling the same ticket twice,” said the club's operations manager, Michelle Dite, “and the primary reason is to make tennis as accessible to as many people as possible.”All England Club ticket resales raised about $300,000 for charity in 2024Money from resales goes to charities via the Wimbledon Foundation. Nearly $80,000 was raised through the first three days of this year's tournament; last year's total was about $300,000.Wimbledon has done resales since 1954, but until last year, folks hoping to take advantage of the deal needed to stand in a line once they were on-site, hope they were there soon enough — and hope enough tickets were returned.Now, though, that “line” is virtual.Here's how it works:After opting in on the app and getting their phone scanned by 2:30 p.m. at kiosks on-site or near the Wimbledon Queue, where thousands of people camp out at a local park for up to 24 hours in hopes of getting full-price tickets for main courts or grounds passes for smaller ones, fans then wait for a text message giving the good news that they were one of the lucky ones chosen for the resale, which runs from 3 p.m. to 9 p.m.They have 10 minutes to confirm they still want a used ticket for the rest of the day, and another 20 minutes to get themselves to the green-and-brown ticket resale booth behind No. 1 Court to show the QR code that lets them pay for the cheap tickets.Spending $13 instead of $115 to see Ben Shelton at Wimbledon“You're not stuck in one place forever,"" said Henry Thompson, 38, a high school math teacher from Missouri. “This is much more efficient. Took 30 seconds. Much better.”Thompson, who was wearing a blue hat with the Wimbledon logo, really wanted to see 10th-seeded American Ben Shelton, so he entered the resale lottery and was able to get a seat for No. 2 Court for $13 instead of $115.“It's beneficial to the sport to give people access to those courts for a reasonable price,” said Marcos Giron, a 45th-ranked American who won first-round matches in singles and doubles this week. “It's a wonderful thing.”Chen Pinjung, who just finished medical school in Taiwan, waited in the queue for six hours, paid 30 pounds ($40) there for a grounds pass, then also got herself into No. 1 Court via a resale for an additional $13 — instead of the $150 it could have cost to see 2022 Wimbledon champion Elena Rybakina win there Thursday.“If everybody knew how that works, I'm sure everybody would apply,” said Rafael Garcia, who was with his girlfriend, Diana Meneses, and her brother, Gustavo Meneses. “We saw that (resale) office last year, but we didn't know how to do it. Now we will.”","Wimbledon offers cheap tickets to its biggest courts when fans leave early. The All England Club wouldn't say how many tickets get resold.

? Why is it imposed?

Taylor Fritz's match against Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard was suspended due to the curfew at Wimbledon in London. (AP)

American tennis player Ben Shelton expressed frustration when his Wimbledon second-round match against Rinky Hijikata was suspended due to darkness despite being just one game away from victory. The match was halted at 9:30 PM due to the bd light on the outside courts, with Shelton leading 6-2, 7-5, 5-4 on No.2 Court.The suspension came at a crucial moment when Shelton was preparing to serve for the match. The 22-year-old player immediately confronted the chair umpire about the decision, requiring intervention from another rules official who had to explain the ruling while restraining him.The match was taking place on Court No.2, which lacks both a roof and artificial lighting capabilities. The timing of the suspension particularly sparked controversy as it followed a 30-minute discussion about whether to continue play into the third set.The ESPN broadcasting team expressed their disbelief at the situation during their live coverage. ""Oh my goodness. This is unbelievable,"" the commentary team stated as the events unfolded.Fans took to social media to voice their concerns over the decision to move the match a day later. One fan posted on X: ""Yo @Wimbledon that's just embarrassing. You spend 30 mins talking about whether or not to keep playing. You ultimately start the third set. And you let them play all the way until 5-4, and right when Ben Shelton is about to serve for the match, that's when you call it. Pathetic.""Another fan expressed their frustration: ""Absolutely UNBELIEVABLE they're suspending Ben Shelton / Rinky Hijikata. For a major not to be able to continue beyond 9:30 is absolutely insane. This is beyond comprehension right now.""A third fan supported Shelton's reaction: ""Ben Shelton has every right to be livid. After all this, you suspend the match right before Shelton is about to serve for it?? Absolute ridiculous decision yet again by tournament officials.""As Shelton left the court, he acknowledged the crowd with a fist pump and showed appreciation for their support. The match is scheduled to resume on Friday, July 4.While not true in this case, Wimbledon has a curfew time that was imposed during Taylor Fritz's first round match against Frenchman Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard.The Wimbledon curfew is strictly set for 11 pm local time. This rule was introduced in 2009 when the Centre Court's roof was opened.In a 2018 statement, Wimbledon explained the purpose of the curfew: ""The 11 p.m. curfew is a Planning Condition designed to balance the needs of local residents with the demands of hosting an international tennis tournament in a residential area. Considerations such as transportation and ensuring spectators can get home safely are also important factors.""While the curfew is usually enforced without exception, there have been instances where it has been broken. In 2012, Andy Murray won his match against Marcos Baghdatis at 11:02 pm. The umpire decided to allow Murray to complete the final game rather than waiting until the next day to finish it.","Ben Shelton's match against Rinky Hijikata was suspended at 9:30 PM due to bad light.

Poll Do you think Emma Raducanu and Carlos Alcaraz make a good mixed-doubles team? Yes, they complement each other well No, they should stick to singles Undecided I don’t follow mixed doubles

LONDON: The US Open’s reimagined mixed-doubles competition — offering $1 million winner’s prize — may be sparking romantic vibes, courtesy the Emma Raducanu-Carlos Alcaraz partnership, but is there even a shred of truth to it? Raducanu, 22, gets asked about it in press at Wimbledon, where she’s in the third round, and there are almost life-size caricatures of the Briton and the Spaniard up at the Village, at SW19. Tennis is manifesting it seems.Alcaraz’s “I asked Emma” declaration may have fuelled the rumours.Raducanu, who won the US Open as an 18-year-old in 2021, and Alcaraz, who won the first of his five majors in New York aged 19, go back a long time.The Spaniard lent to the moment when he called his partner “the boss ”, saying she could play the match and he would basically fill in wherever he was needed to. Raducanu was quick to come back with a question of her own, “I would like to know how much of the court he can cover in New York?”“I’m just gonna serve and I’m gonna pull myself away and let her play,” Alcaraz said. An ambitious journalist even tossed the dating question at Raducanu. “We’re just good friends,” she responded, smiling. While the romance rumours may be good for the event, it is as clear as the London summer sky that the pairings — for most of the 16 teams in the event — have been engineered by the organizers.World No. 1 Jannik Sinner, who is teaming up with Emma Navarro, spoke to the American for the first time at Wimbledon.In his pre-Championship media interaction, Sinner was asked how the partnership came about.“I met her yesterday for the first time. We never talked, we never texted. It’s actually a funny story,” he said, “The tournament wanted us to kind of play together because certain teams were already set up.” The 23-year-old added: “I’m very happy to play with Emma. I told her already, don’t get pissed with me if I miss volleys. Doubles, I struggle.”Navarro, Wimbledon’s 10th seed, joined in the fun during a television interview, saying, “He (Sinner) was begging me to play. I said, ‘Yeah sure. I guess I’ll play with you. You’re not the best player, but I’ll make an exception and try to get a better partner next year!”There may be a breakup, though, that could throw a spanner in the works for the US Open.

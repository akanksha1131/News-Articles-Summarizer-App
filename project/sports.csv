CHENNAI: Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) captain Ajinkya Rahane has cried himself hoarse asking for a spin-friendly pitch at their home ground, the Eden Gardens in Kolkata. The Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) hasn’t yet obliged and naturally, the results haven’t been spectacular. However, on Friday at Chennai Super Kings ’ (CSK) home ground, the MA Chidambaram Stadium, KKR’s spin-trio of Varun Chakravarthy, Sunil Narine and Moeen Ali — along with paceman Harshit Rana, who is very good with his cutters — got a slightly conducive surface and wreaked havoc, subjecting the hosts to the kind of humiliation they are not used to at home.CSK were dismissed for 103/9 — their lowest at the Chepauk — topping their previous low of 109 against MI in 2019. The KKR batters, though, showed that there weren’t any demons in the pitch. A mighty assault led by Narine (44 off 18 balls) and his opening partnership of 46 off 25 balls with Quinton de Kock finished off any hopes of a CSK fightback.KKR notched up the eight-wicket win in 10.1 overs, boosting their net run-rate significantly, while CSK now have no place to hide.The game was set up with a combination of excellent bowling and some atrocious batting by the CSK batters, most of them well past their prime. With losses in five consecutive games, CSK’s famed strategy of playing with experienced players, who may have played their best cricket a long while ago, is truly unravelling. But then, that doesn’t take anything away from KKR.The visitors had a well-thought out plan and captain Rahane chose to bowl even though CSK had lost four matches chasing. Quite clearly, he believed that his bowlers are up to the job on a pitch where the ball was stopping and turning.Rahane introduced Moeen (1/20) in the Powerplay with his off-spin and it was in his first two overs that the die was cast. His second over was a maiden when he had the wicket of Devon Conway, missing one in his attempt to reverse sweep to be leg-before.Paceman Harshit used his change of pace to induce a false shot off Rachin Ravindra and with the score reading 16/2 in 4.1 overs, the CSK innings was already in doldrums. From there on, it was a tale of Varun (2/22) and Narine (3/13) stifling the middle-order which seemed clueless against their guile.They hit the right length, got the ball to turn just a little bit as the CSK batters failed to read them from their hands. The likes of Vijay Shankar, Rahul Tripathi, Ravindra Jadeja and ‘impact sub’ Deepak Hooda were unable to take the attack to the rivals as wickets kept falling.But the biggest disappointment was ‘new captain’ MS Dhoni . Batting at No. 9, he missed a faster one off Narine and got caught plumb in front. He asked for a review, it went on for quite a while, the fans hoped and prayed for a hint or murmur from the bat, but there wasn’t any.Shivam Dube at the other end was left stranded, unbeaten on 31, and helped CSK limp past the 100-mark. In the process, he pulled his hamstring and if the injury gets worse, CSK are really looking at more bleak days.","Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) beat Chennai Super Kings (CSK) by eight wickets. CSK were bowled out for 103 at their home ground, the MA Chidambaram Stadium. KKR's spin-trio of Varun Chakravarthy, Sunil Narine and Moeen Ali wreaked havoc.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120222256,imgsize-34958,width-400,resizemode-4/Dhoni-1280-spotzpics.jpg"

BENGALURU: “Mera ground hai,” declared KL Rahul after his unbeaten 93 on a tricky M Chinnaswamy stadium surface steered Delhi Capitals (DC) to a six-wicket win over Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) on Thursday night.Rahul owned his home ground, where he has played many memorable knocks, including a triple century in Ranji Trophy. The 32-yearold has over t h e y e a r s m a s t e r e d the art of adaptation. From opening the innings to batting at No. 8 to displaying agility behind the stumps, Rahul, the quintessential team man, goes about his job without a fuss.In his 12th year as an international cricketer, Rahul has faced challenges aplenty. Having spent a lot of time over the last few years on the sidelines with multiple injury issues, he has scripted a fresh chapter each time critics begin to write his epilogue. A constant in this journey has been his ability to adapt.The flexibility he offers underlines his versatility, the depth of his class and craft. RCB’s batting coach Dinesh Karthik said the role Rahul was performing with such aplomb wasn’t straightforward.“It’s very challenging to bat at different positions in T20. But it’s one that he’s (Rahul) done nicely in the recent past. For some time now, I’ve believed he’s a high-quality middle-order batter. And you can see the results coming through as well.”Rahul, who was dropped when on only five runs by home team skipper Rajat Patidar, said at the post-match presentation, “This is my ground, this is my home. I know this (ground) better than anybody else. I enjoyed playing here.”While the Capitals’ top-order comprising Jake Fraser-McGurk, Faf du Plessis and Abhishek Porel perished to cross-batted shots, most of Rahul’s big hits were a result of his open-faced bat approach.“What helped me was being behind the stumps for 20 overs, just watching how it played. I figured that the ball sat in the wicket a little bit, but it was consistent. I knew what my shots were. Just wanted to get off to a good start, be aggressive initially and assess it from there. If I was trying to hit a big six, I knew what pockets to target. Wicketkeeping gave me a feel for how the other batters played,” Rahul explained.",KL Rahul scores unbeaten 93 as Delhi Capitals beat Royal Challengers Bengaluru. The 32-year-old has over t h e y e a r s m a s t e r e d the art of adaptation.

NEW DELHI: On a night MS Dhoni resumed the captaincy mantle for Chennai Super Kings ( CSK ), it was Kolkata Knight Riders ' Sunil Narine who stole the spotlight with a stunning all-round performance that silenced the Chepauk faithful on Friday.The Ajinkya Rahane-led side , chasing a modest 104, romped to an eight-wicket win in just 10.1 overs, riding on Narine’s blitz and a collective bowling masterclass.Dhoni’s return to leadership, following Ruturaj Gaikwad’s injury, was expected to lift CSK, but the veteran keeper-batter managed just 1 off 4 balls and fell LBW to the man of the moment, Sunil Narine, in the 16th over of the game.That moment, accompanied by stunned silence in the stands, summed up CSK’s woeful evening.After opting to bowl, KKR’s spinners choked the hosts on a dry surface.Narine led the charge with a mesmeric spell of 3 for 13, dismantling the middle and lower order with guile and bite.His victims included Rahul Tripathi, Ravindra Jadeja, and Dhoni -- three massive scalps that sucked the life out of CSK’s innings.Only Shivam Dube (31 not out) and Vijay Shankar (29) showed resistance as CSK limped to 103/9, their lowest-ever IPL total at home and third lowest overall.The rest of the lineup crumbled under the pressure applied by Narine, Harshit Rana (2/16), and Varun Chakaravarthy (2/22).Narine wasn’t done yet.Opening the chase, he launched into the CSK bowlers, smashing 44 off just 18 balls, with 5 sixes and 2 fours -- a cameo that turned a modest target into a formality.He fell just shy of a fifty, but by then, KKR were well on course.Rahane (20 not out) and Rinku Singh (15 not out), finished the job, with the latter smashing a six off Jadeja to seal the emphatic win.In the end, it was Narine’s night -- ball, bat, and brilliance -- as KKR humbled CSK and muted the Dhoni fairytale.","Kolkata Knight Riders beat Chennai Super Kings by eight wickets. Sunil Narine took three wickets for just 13 runs. Ajinkya Rahane and Rinku Singh added 20 runs for the second wicket. CSK posted 103/9, their lowest-ever IPL total at home.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120214120,imgsize-60098,width-400,resizemode-4/Sunil-Narine-silences-MS-Dhoni-BCCI-Photo.jpg"

Fastest chases of 100+ totals in IPL:

Kolkata Knight Riders handed Chennai Super Kings a thumping eight-wicket loss at the MA Chidambaram Stadium on Friday, hunting down a modest 104-run target in just 10.1 overs (61 balls) — marking their second-biggest win in IPL history in terms of balls remaining.Invited to bat first, CSK endured a horror show with the bat on their home turf, crawling to 103/9 in 20 overs.

To make matters worse, Friday’s loss to KKR was also their third consecutive defeat at Chepauk — marking the first time they’ve suffered three back-to-back home losses in the league.KKR’s bowlers delivered a masterclass in control and precision. Veteran Sunil Narine spun a web with figures of 3/13, while pacer Harshit Rana and spinner Varun Chakaravarthy took two wickets each. CSK’s batters never found rhythm, managing just nine boundaries — a telling stat of their struggles on a slow, gripping surface.Shivam Dube was the only silver lining for CSK, scoring an unbeaten 31 off 29 balls. Vijay Shankar chipped in with 29, but no other batter crossed the double-digit mark, exposing the brittle middle order.In reply, KKR’s openers came out with intent and aggression, putting the game to bed in quick time. They wrapped up the chase with 59 balls to spare, underlining their dominance.KKR’s only bigger win came in 2021 when they chased 93 against RCB in just 10 overs, with 60 balls remaining.9.4 overs – RCB vs KKR, Bengaluru, 2015 (Target: 112)9.4 overs – SRH vs LSG, Hyderabad, 2024 (Target: 166)10.1 overs – KKR vs CSK , Chennai, 2025 (Target: 104)*","Kolkata Knight Riders beat Chennai Super Kings by eight wickets.

IPL: RCB mentor Karthik questions Chinnaswamy pitch after twin defeats

NEW DELHI: Delhi Capitals are set to host Mumbai Indians in their IPL 2025 clash at the Arun Jaitley Stadium on Sunday. The Hardik Pandya-led Mumbai Indians have already arrived in the capital and are currently training in the city.However, their preparations were affected as Delhi and surrounding NCR regions experienced a sudden dip in temperature on Friday, accompanied by dusty storms for the second consecutive day. The weather disrupted flight operations at the Delhi airport, leading to multiple delays and diversions — and even impacted Mumbai Indians’ practice session.In a video shared by the Mumbai Indians on their social media platforms, star batter Rohit Sharma is seen reacting humorously to the incoming storm. As strong winds hit the stadium, Rohit can be heard shouting “comeback” to his teammates. He then playfully tells the cameraman to focus on the storm instead of him.(Hey, why are you filming me? Shoot the storm instead),"" Rohit says in the clip.Meanwhile, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued a yellow alert for Delhi on April 11, with temperatures expected to range between 23°C and 38°C.While the storms caused disruption, the overcast skies and cooler winds brought a brief respite from the heatwave that had gripped the region over the past week.Delhi Capitals remain the only unbeaten side in the tournament so far with four wins from four matches.Mumbai Indians, on the other hand, are struggling at the bottom half of the table — placed eighth with just one win and four defeats in five games.","Delhi Capitals host Mumbai Indians in their IPL 2025 clash on Sunday.

MS Dhoni returns as CSK Captain, confirms coach Stephen Fleming

Kolkata Knight Riders (Playing XI):

Chennai Super Kings (Playing XI):

NEW DELHI: Chennai Super Kings suffered a major setback as regular skipper Ruturaj Gaikwad was ruled out of the IPL due to an elbow injury — a development that has paved the way for Mahendra Singh Dhoni to return to the leadership role. CSK head coach Stephen Fleming confirmed the news on Thursday. Gaikwad sustained the injury after being struck by a short ball from Jofra Archer during CSK’s IPL 2025 clash against Rajasthan Royals."" Ruturaj Gaikwad ruled out of IPL with fracture on elbow. MS Dhoni to take over as captain,"" Fleming told mediapersons on Thursday.“He (Gaikwad) got hit in Guwahati. He’s been operating with an amount of pain. We got an X-ray, which was inconclusive, and we had an MRI, which revealed a fracture in his elbow, in the radial neck. So we’re disappointed and feel for him. We appreciate the efforts that he’s gone to in terms of trying to play, but unfortunately, he’d be out of the tournament from now. We have an uncapped player, MS Dhoni, who will take over as captain for the remainder of the IPL,"" Fleming added at a press conference.Dhoni, who came out for the toss for CSK, also confirmed that Gaikwad was ruled out of the season. He made two changes to the Playing XI, bringing in Rahul Tripathi in place of Gaikwad and including Anshul Kamboj for Mukesh Choudhary.""We were looking to bat first. Quite a few occasions where we tried to chase it down and what we realised is that the wicket slows down a bit, so if you don't get a good start then the middle order comes under pressure. (On Ruturaj) He has fractured something on his elbow, so he is ruled out of the tournament. He is a very authentic batter, someone who looks to time the ball well. So yeah, he will be a big miss,"" Dhoni said during the toss.""(On the importance of winning this game) It is important now, every game is important. We have lost too many matches and now it is important to do the basics right - have dot balls, take our catches. A couple of games we lost by big margins, but otherwise it was about the small things - about one over going for 20 runs. Our batters are more authentic as batters, they won't slog everything. They just need to back their instincts. It is important to start well, get boundaries early on and try to get a couple of early wickets as well.

IPL: RCB mentor Karthik questions Chinnaswamy pitch after twin defeats

NEW DELHI: MS Dhoni 's DRS calls are usually spot on, but in a rare moment of controversy, the CSK skipper was given out in a decision that left fans stunned and furious. The incident occurred in the 16th over of Chennai Super Kings ' innings against Kolkata Knight Riders , when Dhoni was adjudged LBW off Sunil Narine 's bowling.Dhoni immediately opted for a review, convinced there was an inside edge. UltraEdge did show a faint spike as the ball passed the bat, but after a lengthy deliberation, the third umpire ruled that there was no bat involved. With three reds on the ball-tracker, Dhoni was declared out — much to the disbelief of the Chepauk crowd.The home fans were left shell-shocked by the decision. Dhoni, who came out to bat at number nine, could only manage 1 run off 4 balls before walking back in disappointment.The match turned out to be a nightmare for CSK, who slumped to an eight-wicket defeat — their third consecutive loss at Chepauk, a first in IPL history. It was also their fifth straight defeat this season, placing them in unfamiliar territory near the bottom of the points table.The game marked Dhoni's return as captain after Ruturaj Gaikwad was ruled out of the tournament due to an elbow injury. However, his comeback was marred by a woeful performance with the bat by CSK, who were restricted to just 103/9 — their lowest-ever total at home and the third-lowest in their IPL history.KKR, in contrast, made light work of the chase. Led by a blazing 44 off 18 balls from Sunil Narine, the visitors reached the target in just 10.1 overs, handing CSK one of their most humbling defeats at home.","CSK skipper MS Dhoni given out in a rare moment of controversy.

Churchill Brothers finished on top of the table with 40 points, one more than second-placed Inter Kashi (39).

The decision was challenged and later stayed by the appeals committee.Should the appeals committee decide against Namdhari, Kashi will move on top with 42 points. The appeals committee was scheduled to meet on April 28 but with growing pressure on AIFF to announce the champion, the panel has now advanced its meeting to Saturday, April 12.“This will probably be the most important decision of the appeals committee,” a senior official told TOI. “The I-League champions will be decided based on the order of the committee.”","The I-League concluded on Sunday without an official champion for the first time.

The Miami E-Prix in Florida is set to bring the Homestead-Miami Speedway alive with the ultra fast electric race cars—combining high-octane entertainment with sustainability. As Formula E returns to this iconic circuit after a decade-long hiatus, race enthusiasts are eagerly anticipating high-speed action at the picturesque venue. Will Nissan’s Oliver Rowland and NEOM McLaren’s Taylor Barnard continue their season dominance at Miami, or will Jaguar TCS Racing’s Mitch Evans rise to the occasion with a win on U.S. soil? Only time will tell.The Miami E-Prix is one of only two single-header races remaining this season. The other is in Jakarta on June 21. Homestead-Miami Speedway is the fifth different venue in the USA to host a Formula E race—more than any other country.Saturday’s race will also mark the 137th race in Formula E history, and the 37th in the Gen3 Evo era. The new Gen3 Evo cars can hit 322 km/h and accelerate from 0 to 100 km/h in just 1.86 seconds—faster than a Formula 1 car.Interestingly, the winning margin in the final race of each weekend has been steadily increasing with 0.099s in Sao Paulo, 0.125s in Mexico and 0.286s and 0.439s in the Jeddah double header.Meanwhile, the polesitter has finished on the podium in the last three races, in stark contrast to the previous stretch where only 2 polesitters reached the podium in 12 races.When it comes to qualifying, Oliver Rowland and Maximilian Günther are the only drivers to have reached the duel stages in every round this season. In contrast, Nick Cassidy, David Beckmann, Nico Müller, Robin Frijns, Zane Maloney, Sébastien Buemi, and Lucas di Grassi have yet to reach the duels.NEOM McLaren is guaranteed a record no matter which of its drivers wins in Miami. If Taylor Barnard takes the checkered flag, he will become the youngest winner in Formula E history. And if Sam Bird wins, he will become the oldest Formula E race winner.The race is also set to be a special one for Edoardo Mortara of Mahindra Racing, who is set to make his 100th career Formula E start.","The Miami E-Prix is one of only two single-header races remaining this season.

Formula E is now in its 11th season since its debut in 2014, and the electric motorsport has achieved impressive success, carving its own identity despite the dominance of Formula 1. One of the key indicators of this success is the growing grid of 11 teams and 22 drivers—one more than the 10 teams in F1. While drivers like Oliver Rowland and Pascal Wehrlein have previously tested their skills in F1, it seems they've found their true calling in the more sustainable and rapidly evolving Formula E.Oliver Rowland is currently leading the Formula E standings with 68 points, thanks to his victory at this season’s Mexico City E-Prix. Rowland had a brief stint with F1 team Williams in 2018 before transitioning to Formula E, where he raced for Mahindra Racing and then Nissan, ultimately making a name for himself with the Japanese team. Antonio Felix da Costa, driving for Porsche, is also a formidable force in the series. He currently sits in third place with 39 points this season, continuing to prove his prowess on the track.Maximilian Günther has made a strong impression after his move from Maserati MSG Racing to DS Penske. At the Jeddah E-Prix, Günther took pole position, posted the fastest lap, and ultimately clinched the victory. With this standout performance, he’s now eyeing an even higher position, currently sitting fourth in the driver standings.German driver Pascal Wehrlein, another former F1 racer, began his Formula E career with Mahindra Racing before joining Tag Heuer Porsche. After winning the Formula E World Championship last season, Wehrlein has maintained his strong form, registering the fastest lap in two races this season—at the São Paulo and Mexico City E-Prix. He’s currently in eighth place with 25 points but remains a serious contender with 7 career wins and 6 pole positions to his name.Mitch Evans, a consistent presence with Jaguar TCS Racing since 2016, continues to be among the best drivers in Formula E. He secured a win for Jaguar at the São Paulo E-Prix in December, propelling him to seventh in the standings with 25 points, keeping him in the mix for the championship.At just 20 years old, Taylor Barnard is quickly establishing himself as one of the brightest young talents in Formula E. Driving for McLaren, Barnard currently sits in second place with 51 points, proving that in just two years, he has more than earned his place among the series’ elite.",Formula E is now in its 11th season since its debut in 2014.

Who founded Formula E

All eyes are currently on Formula 1 , as the season kicked off last month in Australia. However, there's another motorsport series that deserves just as much attention—one that not only thrills but is also in tune with the global movement for sustainability. Enter Formula E, the FIA-recognized single-seater world championship. Like Formula 1, it showcases high-speed racing, but with a key distinction: it’s environmentally conscious. Formula E uses all-electric cars, offering a cleaner, greener alternative to traditional motorsports while also driving innovation in the electric vehicle sector.Formula E cars are smaller, lighter, and require far fewer tire changes over the course of the season, which helps minimize their environmental footprint. And if you’re wondering whether these electric racers can deliver the same level of excitement as Formula 1, consider this: the Generation 3 Formula E car can reach speeds exceeding 100 km/h, proving that sustainability and speed can indeed go hand in hand.The ABB FIA Formula E Championship is currently in its 11th season, with the next race—the Miami ePrix—set for April 12. The season will run until July 27, with many more thrilling races scheduled across the globe.Formula 1 has been around since 1950 and has only evolved into hybrid vehicles relying on fossil fuels like E10 fuel (a mix of 90% petrol and 10% renewable ethanol). In contrast, Formula E is the motorsport of the 21st century after coming into existence in 2014. These races feature all-electric cars that run on powertrains converting energy from a battery into motion.One of the most striking differences between the two sports is how the cars handle tire changes. In Formula 1, teams often swap tires multiple times during a single race due to varying track conditions. In Formula E, however, teams are only allowed to change tires twice throughout the entire championship. The tires used in Formula E are made from natural rubber and recycled fibers, and are specifically designed to perform well in all weather conditions.Despite this difference, Formula E is by no means inferior. While a Formula 1 car can reach speeds in excess of 350 km/h, the new Formula E Gen3 Evo can reach 322 km/h, but it can accelerate faster than a F1 car. It can go from 0-100 km/h in 1.86 seconds., faster than many Formula 1 cars.Although both series use the same chassis, battery, and tires, the real performance differences come from the powertrains provided by each team. There is one aspect where Formula 1 still holds an edge, primarily due to the electric car's battery limitations. As the battery depletes, an electric car loses speed, requiring a pit stop to recharge in a flash. A Formula 1 car, on the other hand, can maintain top speed even with a quarter tank of fuel.Additionally, Formula E cars must be kept light—around 284 kg for the battery, which accounts for one-third of the car's weight that’s fixed at 840 kg, including the driver.Despite the technical differences, Formula E has its own appeal. Even Red Bull driver Max Verstappen has acknowledged how difficult it can be to drive the RB21. In comparison, electric cars in Formula E are simpler, with single-speed transmission and no gear shifts necessary, unlike the multiple gears in a F1 car.Currently, Formula E features 11 teams, with 22 drivers. Unlike Formula 1, where the top speeds are often the focus, Formula E records are typically based on average race speeds. The fastest race in Formula E history took place in Cape Town in 2023, with an average speed of 132.2 km/h.Practice sessions are held on Friday and Saturday, lasting 30 minutes each, giving drivers a chance to fine-tune their performance.Qualifying: Drivers are split into two groups based on their championship standing. Each group has a 10-minute session to set the fastest lap at 300 kW. The top 4 from each group then advance to the ""duels"" stage, where drivers face off head-to-head at 350 kW in a series of quarter-finals, semi-finals, and a final. The winner of the final claims pole position.The top ten drivers receive points using the standard FIA system (25–18–15–12–10–8–6–4–2–1). The pole position winner earns an additional 3 points, while the driver setting the fastest lap (if they finish in the top ten) receives 1 point.Drivers can deploy a combined 8 minutes of Attack Mode during the race. It provides additional power, activated by driving through a designated area of the circuit off the racing line. All Attack Modes must be used before the end of the race.A new feature has been introduced this season. It requires all drivers to make a mandatory 30-second pit stop to recharge their car's batteries at 600 kW. This adds 3.85 kWh of energy (around 10% more) to be used for the remainder of the race.Formula E was founded by Spanish businessman Alejandro Agag, who serves as the company's Chairman, while Jeff Dodds is the Chief Executive Officer. Many may not realize that Warner Bros. Discovery is among its shareholders.","Formula E is the FIA-recognized single-seater world championship.

The current Formula E season is in full swing, fueling even more excitement for this electrifying motorsport, where cars now accelerate from 0-60 mph in a jaw-dropping 1.82 seconds. With 11 teams and 22 drivers battling it out across 16 races at 10 iconic global locations, the season will run through to July 27. Since its inception, the Nissan Formula E Team has led the charge, but a number of other teams are rapidly closing the gap in a sport that blends speed, innovation, and sustainability.All teams are currently using the Formula E Gen3 Evo cars fitted with Hankook tires. These cars can reach a top speed of 322 km/h—the fastest for any Formula E car—and accelerate even quicker than an F1 car. Needless to say, the Formula E fever is rapidly spreading among motorsport fans. Among the 11 teams, Nissan boasts 21 wins in 136 races, along with 50 podium finishes. Envision Racing, Jaguar TCS Racing , and Lola Yamaha ABT Formula E Team are also among the top contenders.Nissan recently added another victory to its impressive tally.

This year, he remains in top form, having recorded the fastest lap in two races. He has been joined by Antonio Felix da Costa, the Season 6 champion, who is also performing well, having won four out of five races last season. The team now has 12 wins and 25 podium finishes in 78 races.DS Penske is also having a strong season, with Maximilian Günther claiming a victory at the Jeddah E-Prix I after taking over as the lead driver. Günther dominated the weekend by securing pole position and recording the fastest lap. Jean-Éric Vergne, the other DS Penske driver, is expected to maintain his strong form this season.Jaguar TCS Racing started the season with a win.

The team now has 17 wins and 47 podium finishes in 115 races.Andretti Formula E Team has been around for a while, securing 11 wins and 37 podium finishes. Driver Jake Dennis continues to impress, and he is now joined by new addition Nico Mueller.Envision Racing is consistently among the top teams in Formula E, with 16 wins and 53 podiums in 136 races. Both drivers, Sébastien Buemi and Robin Frijns, are experienced and remain in top form.Neom McLaren has 8 wins and 29 podium finishes in 91 races. Taylor Barnard, who became the youngest driver in Formula E history at 19, is now a full-time driver for the team, alongside Sam Bird.Maserati MSG Racing has been taking a slower approach, with 10 wins and 28 podium finishes in 136 races. The team has added two new drivers: Jake Hughes and Stoffel Vandoorne.The team recently faced a setback when Nico Mueller moved to Andretti after contributing significantly to the team’s success. Lucas di Grassi, along with rookie Zane Maloney, is competing for the team this year. Lola Yamaha ABT has 14 wins and 47 podium finishes in 119 races.Mahindra Racing has yet to fully catch up with the competition, having secured only 5 wins and 24 podium finishes, despite competing alongside top teams like Nissan and Envision Racing. Nyck de Vries and Edo Mortara are driving for Mahindra Racing.Cupra Kiro is trailing behind in the competition, but there is hope for the team this season, as David Beckmann set the fastest lap at the São Paulo E-Prix.

PUNE: It is fast becoming Shrivalli Rashmikaa ’s tie. So much so that the popular number answering to her name from the Telugu film 'Pushpa' has become the Indian team’s new anthem.From having not played a singles match until the start of the week to winning all her three rubbers in as many days, the 23-year-old Shrivalli has led the Indian challenge with style and panache at the Billie Jean King Asia-Oceania Group 1 competition in Mhalunge-Balewadi.The young star clinched the match for India against Hong Kong on Thursday after overcoming Hong Yi Cody Wong, another promising 23- year-old to watch out for in the coming years, 7-6 (6), 2-6, 6-3 in the second singles.Vaidehi Chaudhari, playing in place of Sahaja Yamalapalli who retired due to cramps in her match against Thailand on Wednesday, laid the foundation by beating Ho Ching Wu 7-6 (8), 6-1 in the opening singles. In the absence of Sahaja, the No. 1 mantle fell on Shrivalli and she wore it comfortably.The most admirable part of Shrivalli, besides her eye-pleasing stroke making, over the past three days has been her fitness.In the doubles, Ankita Raina and Prarthana Thombare saved four match-points but eventually lost to Wong and Eudice Chong 7-6 (2), 3-6, 11-13.In the other matches, New Zealand ground out a gruelling 2-1 win over Chinese Taipei, the two singles matches lasting nearly five and half hours, while Thailand bounced back to overcome South Korea by an identical margin.",Shrivalli Rashmikaa has led the Indian challenge with style and panache at the Billie Jean King Asia-Oceania Group 1 competition in Mhalunge-Balewadi.

PUNE: Ankita Raina and Prarthana Thombare pulled off the decisive doubles rubber to help India pip Thailand 2-1 in their second match of the Billie Jean King Cup Asia-Oceania Group 1 women’s team tennis competition on Wednesday. The Indians overcame Peangtarn Plipuech and Patcharin Cheapchandej 7-6 (3), 3-6, 10-3 to help the hosts register their first win of the competition at the Shiv Chhatrapati Sports Complex in Mhalunge-Balewadi, Pune.Shrivalli Rashmikaa once again put the team in front as she beat a higher-ranked Lanlana Tararudee 6-2, 6-4 but Sahaja Yamalapalli conceded the second singles against Mananchaya Sawangkaew due to cramps one game into the third set.With temperatures running in excess of 40 degrees Celsius for the fourth successive day, it was a gallant effort from Sahaja to level the scores 3-6, 7-6 (3). But the fightback in energy sapping conditions took a toll and the 24-year-old, writhing in pain, was helped off the centre court after two hours and 18 minutes of gruelling duel.“She is fit; we will see to it that she is ready tomorrow,” captain Vishaal Uppal said. India take on Hong Kong on Thursday.In the other matches, New Zealand beat South Korea 2-1 and Hong Kong upset Chinese Taipei 2-1.Shrivalli demonstrated her growing confidence while giving a winning start to the Indian team. The Hyderabad girl — with a smooth serving action and fluid, strong ground strokes on both the flanks — broke Tararudee twice in both the sets, although in different circumstances.Shrivalli — ranked 345th in the world, which is nearly 190 spots lower than her rival — nudged ahead 4-2 in the first set when Tararudee double-faulted on second breakpoint. The Thai saved the first one with an ace down Shrivalli’s backhand before the latter set up another chance with an accurate service return that landed right at Tararudee’s feet.Tararudee, impressive with her accuracy and placement, upped her intensity in the following game, pulling Shrivalli wide and opening up the court. But the Indian did well to hold off the challenge. Shrivalli rode on the momentum to close the set in the 10th game when Tararudee put an overhead smash into the net on breakpoint.The 23-year-old Indian dropped serve in the opening game of the second set against the run of play and it seemed Tararudee, world No. 166, had taken control of the proceedings for a while. Shrivalli then turned it around brilliantly when, trailing 2-4, took the next four games in a row to clinch the match.The focus then shifted on Sahaja, who ran away to a 3-0 lead.","Ankita Raina and Prarthana Thombare pull off the decisive doubles rubber to help India pip Thailand 2-1 in their second match of the Billie Jean King Cup Asia- Oceania Group 1 women’s team tennis competition.

PUNE: India's young women tennis players have produced sparks of brilliance in recent times. They have a chance to step up to the next level when they compete in the AsiaOceania Group 1 competition of the Billie Jean King Cup , starting here on Tuesday.The Indian women barely managed to stay in the group after finishing fourth in the six-team event, held in China, last year. With Japan and the hosts having advanced to the Qualifiers, this edition presents Vishaal Uppal’s side with the best chance to go through to the playoffs.Team captain Uppal, a former Davis Cupper, has led the team to the World Group playoffs in 2020, a first for the Indian women. They lost to Latvia away the following year. Four years on, things couldn’t have been more different.The highest-ranked player in the field is World No. 41 Lulu Sun from New Zealand. The 23-year-old of mixed heritage caught the attention with her quarterfinal run at the Wimbledon as a qualifier last year, beating then World No. 8 Qinwen Zheng in the first round. Besides Sun, Thailand’s Mananchaya Sawangkaew (world ranked 110) and Lanlana Tararudee (166) as well as Joanna Garland of Chinese Taipei pose a major threat.“It’s a very even group. If you see the rankings of all the teams, they’re very similar, not much to choose from. So that makes the group very tough and very competitive,” Uppal said.Changes have swept through the Indian team as well. None of the players is ranked in the top-300, unlike in 2021 when Ankita Raina was 183. The side is also without Karman Kaur Thandi, who had broken into the top-200 in 2018 but is currently unranked owing to a lengthy injury layoff. Yet, Shrivalli Rashmikaa and Sahaja Yamalapalli have kept the hopes alive with some stand-out performances.There couldn’t have been a stronger fourth singles player than Vaidehee Chaudhari while Prarthana Thombare brings in the much needed experience and solidity as the doubles player.",India's women play in the AsiaOceania Group 1 competition of the Billie Jean King Cup.

Carlos Alcaraz revealed at the Monte Carlo Masters press conference on Sunday that the pressure to overtake suspended Jannik Sinner as World No. 1 has negatively impacted his performance this season, with his only title in 2025 coming at Rotterdam two months ago.The 21-year-old Spanish tennis star currently sits at world number three, trailing Sinner by 3,610 points in the rankings.""A lot of people are asking me, or are telling me, that I have the chance to become number one if Jannik is not playing. So probably that pressure has killed me in some way,"" Alcaraz said during the press conference.""I'm not surprised because the people always say that we have to win the tournaments or the top people have to be there all the time playing finals or winning tournaments,"" he added.The Monte Carlo Masters marks the beginning of the clay-court season, a surface where Alcaraz has previously excelled, winning the French Open last year and consecutive Madrid Masters titles in 2022 and 2023.Sinner, the current world number one, received a three-month doping ban in February after testing positive twice for clostebol traces in March last year. The 23-year-old Italian is expected to return at the Rome Open in May.""I'm just thinking that I'm not able to become number one... in the clay season, even if Jannik is not playing, I don't have the chance to do it,"" Alcaraz stated. ""I think I'm too far from Jannik. So I'm just here and I realise that I don't have to think about it and just go there and play. That's my mindset right now.""The four-time Grand Slam champion has yet to win a match at Monte Carlo, having been eliminated in his 2022 debut and withdrawing from the last two editions.After receiving a first-round bye, Alcaraz will face either Francisco Cerundolo or Fabio Fognini in his opening match.","Carlos Alcaraz says pressure to overtake Jannik Sinner as World No. 1 has negatively impacted his performance this season.

Bombay Sport Exchange Episode 1: Interview with Sanjog Gupta, CEO (Sports) at JioStar

NEW DELHI: Jannik Sinner , the three-time Grand Slam champion , received a three-month ban after testing positive twice for the banned substance clostebol .The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) agreed to the ban after Sinner admitted ""partial responsibility"" for team mistakes.Umberto Ferrara , Sinner's former physical trainer, has spoken publicly about the scandal for the first time. He claims to be blameless and places the responsibility squarely on Sinner's former physiotherapist, Giacomo Naldi .""I was perfectly aware that it was banned so I always kept it safely stashed away in my wash bag. I suggested to Naldi to use it for a cut which had not healed and was affecting his work. I was absolutely clear when I spoke to him about the nature of the product and it was imperative it never came into contact with Jannik. In effect I told him to use it only in my bathroom. Naldi did not deny he had been told, but he said he could not recall,"" he told Gazzetta dello Sport.Ferrara states that he had been using a spray containing clostebol, prescribed by a doctor for an illness, and had kept it safely stored away.He suggested that Naldi use the spray for a cut that was not healing, but explicitly warned him to use it only in Ferrara's bathroom and to ensure it never came into contact with Sinner.According to Ferrara, Naldi did not deny being warned about the nature of the product but claimed he could not recall the instructions.Ferrara alleges that Naldi treated Sinner without gloves and without washing his hands after using the spray, despite the warnings.Ferrara acknowledges that, in hindsight, he would not have handled the situation the same way. He expresses regret over the behavior of others and claims to have suffered due to the ""bad faith of some.""Sinner's suspension ends on May 4, allowing him to return in time for the French Open. The clay-court tournament in Hamburg will be his second tournament after his return, followed by the Italian Open in Rome.","Jannik Sinner received a three-month ban after testing positive twice for the banned substance clostebol.

At 19, he became the second-youngest champion in the tournament’s history, following Carlos Alcaraz, who won as an 18-year-old in 2022.The match was delayed for nearly six hours due to rain in Florida, leaving Mensik with plenty of time to process the challenge ahead — preventing Djokovic from clinching his 100th career title.Born in September 2005, when Djokovic had already broken into the ATP top-100, Mensik refused to be overwhelmed by the occasion. Instead, he delivered a near-flawless performance, using his powerful serve and aggressive baseline game to become the first Czech player since Tomas Berdych in 2005 to win an ATP Masters 1000 event.Djokovic, appearing troubled by an issue under his right eye, frequently applied eye drops and consulted his team.Still, Mensik capitalised, racing to a 3-0 lead in the first set before Djokovic clawed back. In the tie-break, Mensik dominated, building a 5-0 advantage before closing it out with an overhead smash.The second set saw Djokovic applying pressure from the baseline, but Mensik remained composed, dropping just one break point in the match. With 77% of first-serve points won, the Czech teen sealed a statement victory, toppling a legend and etching his name in Miami Open history.","Jakub Mensik beat Novak Djokovic in straight sets 7-6 (7/4), 7-4.

World number one Aryna Sabalenka secured her first Miami Open title by defeating American Jessica Pegula 7-5 6-2 in the WTA 1000 event final at Hard Rock Stadium on Saturday. This victory marks Sabalenka's second title of 2025, following her Brisbane triumph in January, and her eighth WTA 1000 title overall.Sabalenka, who had recently lost the Indian Wells final to Russian teenager Mirra Andreeva, showed determination not to repeat that outcome in Miami.""I'm super happy to have this trophy, I was able to play my best tennis in the final,"" said Sabalenka, acknowledging Pegula's performance and referencing their previous encounter at the US Open final.The first set was marked by service struggles, featuring seven breaks of serve. Pegula challenged Sabalenka by drawing her to the net, but the momentum shifted when Pegula served at 6-5 down.Sabalenka secured the first set with a combination of a delicate forehand drop and a down-the-line winner.Despite losing her first service game in the second set, Sabalenka quickly regained control. She broke twice to establish a 3-1 lead and maintained her dominance to complete the victory in one hour and 27 minutes.""I think I was able to completely forget about (it being) the final, about the outside things and I was just so focused on the game,"" Sabalenka reflected.The Belarusian has won 12 of her last 14 matches against top 10 players, attributing her success to her performance in crucial moments.""It is all about those key moments of the match, about playing aggressive and staying with the game plan, going for shots without being afraid of losing the point,"" she explained.This marked Pegula's third loss to Sabalenka in a final. The American acknowledged Sabalenka's superiority on hard courts.""I consider myself one of the world's best hard-court players, but she's probably the best,"" Pegula stated after the match.""She just keeps ... raising her level in key moments of the match when she needs to, and I feel like that was the big difference today and the last few times I have played her,"" Pegula added.Despite the loss, Pegula expressed satisfaction with her tournament performance: ""Happy to be in another big 1000 final and having consistent results and keep going deep in tournaments. The reason we play is to put ourselves in good chances to win these events. I was able to do that the last couple weeks.""At 26, Sabalenka has accumulated 19 WTA Tour titles, with 17 on hard courts, including three Grand Slam singles titles - the 2023 Australian Open, 2024 Australian Open, and 2024 US Open.Sabalenka's on-court demeanour has evolved from her earlier years, showing more composure during challenging moments.""I think before, every time I would lose my serve, one game, I could just completely lose the match because I would still be thinking about that first game,"" she reflected.Sabalenka credited her past serving challenges for developing a stronger overall game and mental approach.""When I was struggling with my serve I had to push myself on the return and had to play with something else. So now, every time I am losing (serve) I know that I have weapons, that I can return well and that I can break back,"" she said.""I think that challenge really helped me to be more focused and not get too crazy on court after losing a game on my serve,"" she added.The Miami Open men's final is scheduled for Sunday, featuring Novak Djokovic against Czech teenager Jakub Mensik, with Djokovic pursuing his 100th professional title.","Aryna Sabalenka beats Jessica Pegula 7-5 6-2 in the final of the Miami Open.

Football superstar and Argentina's World Cup-winning captain Lionel Messi was in attendance at the Hard Rock Stadium on Friday, where Novak Djokovic advanced to the Miami Open final with a commanding victory over 14th-seeded Grigor DimitrovIn pursuit of his 100th singles title, and seventh in Miami, Djokovic won 6-2, 6-3 and will face upstart Jakub Mensik, who upset Taylor Fritz 7-6 (7-4), 4-6, 7-6 (7-4) in the other semfinial, for the title.During his post-match court interview, Djokovic recognised that Messi, who currently represents Inter Miami in Major League Soccer, was present, referring to him as ""King Leo.""Djokovic revealed that Messi, accompanied by his wife and children, visited the locker room where they exchanged presents. While Djokovic had previously attended Messi's matches, this marked the first occasion where the football star watched him play.""Obviously, it's a thrill to have his whole family,'' Djokovic said. ""It's a huge honour. He's such a great athlete, not just a football player. His impact on the world of sports in the last 20 years has been immense.""To have him watch me live brings me great joy and excitement and also a little pressure. It's definitely different when he brings his family. I was touched by that.""The 37-year-old Djokovic's performance hasn't been up to his lofty standards, beginning with a withdrawal due to injury at the Australian Open in January. At Indian Wells earlier this month, he suffered a first-round defeat against Botic van de Zandschulp.During the third game, play was halted when security personnel escorted a disruptive spectator from the venue. The chair umpire descended from his position and approached the stands while summoning security staff.Dimitrov engaged in a verbal exchange with the spectator and proceeded to direct the umpire's attention to the location of the troublesome fan at the sideline.""It's just heckling, it's fine,'' Dimitrov said. ""I'm a very calm guy overall. I don't pick any fights but don't trigger me.''Despite Dimitrov securing an early break against Djokovic in the opening game, the Serbian regained composure and secured the first set in 32 minutes.The current men's record holder of 24 Grand Slam titles displayed remarkable serving efficiency, landing 87% of first serves with merely six misses throughout the match. He maintained exceptional control, recording only five unforced errors during the 70-minute contest.""Now I know how it feels to be (John) Isner and (Reilly) Opelka,'' Djokovic said of two serving behemoths. ""Maybe my serve has been a bit underrated.""Djokovic extended his dominant head-to-head record against Dimitrov to 13-1. The Bulgarian player showcased his finest performance during the match.""He wears confidence like a stain on your shirt,'' Dimitrov said. ""It's beautiful to see. Only a few athletes on earth possess that quality.''Mensik, who entered the Miami Open as world number 54, has yet to reach a final in an ATP 1,000-point tournament.In a crucial moment against Fritz, he displayed remarkable composure at 4-4 in the final tiebreaker, securing victory by winning three consecutive points.Throughout the match lasting two hours and 25 minutes, Mensik failed to break serve but managed to win with a brilliant backhand winner down the line at 5-4. Fritz subsequently lost the next two points, sending a forehand long after a 20-shot exchange and netting a forehand on match point.Prior to the match, Mensik had a handshake with Messi. ""I didn't wash my hands before I stepped on the court,"" Mensik said.Tennis inspiration came to Mensik through Djokovic, whom he faced in a three-set match at the Shanghai Masters last October. The age difference between them stands at 18 years.","Novak Djokovic beats Grigor Dimitrov 6-2, 6-3 to reach Miami Open final. Serbian will face Jakub Mensik, who beat Taylor Fritz 7-6 (7-4), 4-6, 7-4. Messi, accompanied by his wife and children, visited the locker room.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119694078,imgsize-39048,width-400,resizemode-4/Djokovic-Messi-1280.jpg"

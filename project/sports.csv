Australia 's frontline pacer Josh Hazlewood has been ruled out of the second Test against India with a side strain.Cricket Australia have added two uncapped bowlers, Sean Abbott and Brendan Doggett, to the squad for the day-night pink-ball Test at the Adelaide Oval, beginning December 6.Hazlewood's unavailability is a huge setback for the hosts, who trail the five-match series 0-1 after a 295-run defeat in the first Test at Perth.He took an impressive 4 for 29 in the first innings at Perth to lead the Australian attack that bowled India out for 150.

East or West, Pakistan India Cricket is the Best | Basit Ali

The International Cricket Council 's ( ICC ) virtual meeting to break the impasse over next year's Champions Trophy ended in a little over 15 minutes on Friday, and the deadlock between India and Pakistan continued. While the Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ) stands by its decision to not travel to Pakistan to play the tournament, the Pakistan Cricket Board ( PCB ) has stuck to its refusal of accepting a hybrid model where India can play all their matches at a neutral venue.In such a scenario, moving the Champions Trophy out of Pakistan looks to be the likely option, with the tournament going ahead even without Pakistan unless they accept a hybrid model.However, former Pakistan batter Basit Ali says it's impossible to conduct the tournament without both India and Pakistan part of it.""Who won in the meeting -- ICC, BCCI or PCB? And How could the meeting end so quickly?"" Basit asked in a video on his YouTube channel.""Ab pata chalega, Pakistan ko ek kaum bana diya hai BCCI ne (now they will get to know, the Indian board has united Pakistan)...Even those who were against the PCB, they are saying 'Whatever (PCB chairman) Mohsin Naqvi says, we will stick to that,"" he added.Another meeting of the ICC Board is expected in the next few day to arrive at a final decision over the tournament scheduled for February 19 to March 9 next year.""Yeh insaaf nahi hai, ke hamari Champions Trophy pe aap daaka daalne ki bharpoor koshish kar rahe hain (it's not justified that they are trying to rob Pakistan of Champions Trophy hosting),"" he said.The Champions Trophy will be making a return to the ICC calendar after a gap of seven years.Talking to media about the deadlock, BCCI's vice-president Rajeev Shukla said, ""Talks are on with the Pakistan board. The ICC is trying its best. Our position is very clear; whatever our government will tells us, we will do that.""",ICC virtual meeting to break impasse over next year's Champions Trophy ends in 15 minutes.

NEW DELHI: Former India batting legend Sunil Gavaskar is of the opinion that India will make at least two changes for the day-night Adelaide Test against Australia that starts from December 6.After the stupendous victory in the first Test against Australia in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy , India is scheduled to play a two-day warm-up match against Prime Ministers XI at the Manuka Oval in the Australian capital of Canberra from Saturday.The pink ball warm-up match in Canberra is of utmost importance for India as it will be the only practice game they will get to play ahead of the day-night second Test in Adelaide.And it will be also the first game for captain Rohit Sharma on this trip to Australia as he missed the first Test in Perth due to the birth of his son.Talking to 7Cricket, Gavaskar said, ""I think there will be two changes for sure, both Rohit Sharma and Shubman Gill coming back into the 11.""Young Devdutt Padikkal is set to be replaced by returning captain Rohit Sharma in the Indian playing XI for the second Test in Adelaide.Everyone will be intrigued by KL Rahul 's batting position in the pink ball warm-up match in Canberra.Rahul might be positioned at number three instead of Padikkal, depending on whether the injured Gill recovers in time for the game.Gill missed the first Test match and has not yet begun batting in the nets after suffering a hairline fracture during the intra-squad match at the WACA.Gavaskar continues, ""My feeling is that the batting order will change. Where Rohit Sharma will replace Rahul, Shubman Gill will bat at three, Padikkal and Jurel will go out of the team, Rahul will bat at six.""At the Adelaide Oval, spin bowling might be the only tactical change made to the starting lineup.In Perth, Washington Sundar was selected ahead of the two veteran spinners, Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja.Before the 36-all-out occurred in the December 2020 Pink Ball Test in Adelaide, Ashwin handed India the lead in the first innings with statistics of 4 for 45, including a brilliant dismissal of Steven Smith.However, based on their recent performance in the nets, Ashwin, Jadeja, and Washington don't now provide much of a choice. Additionally, batting becomes crucial in Pink Ball Tests because the spinners aren't used as often.Gavaskar concludes, ""And one other change that could happen is that Jadeja comes in place of Washington Sundar.""India's success in overseas Test matches has been mostly attributed to Jadeja's batting, although Washington, a left-hander, has also performed admirably in Test matches. In Perth, he helped India surpass the 500-run mark with an 89-run partnership with Virat Kohli",Sunil Gavaskar believes India will make at least two changes for Adelaide Test.

NEW DELHI: Rishabh Pant shattered records at the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2025 mega auction in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, becoming the highest-paid player in the league's history. The Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) secured the dynamic wicketkeeper-batter for an unprecedented Rs 27 crore.Pant's previous franchise Delhi Capitals attempted to retain their star player by exercising the Right to Match (RTM) card at Rs 20.75 crore. However, LSG’s aggressive bid of Rs 27 crore forced Delhi Capitals to step back, sealing Pant’s move to the Lucknow-based franchise.Pant’s record-breaking contract caps off a remarkable comeback story. After surviving a near-fatal car accident in 2022 and undergoing extensive rehabilitation, he returned to international cricket with a renewed focus for the 2024 season of the IPL.Now, Pant is expected to lead LSG as captain in the upcoming IPL 2025 season, which is scheduled to begin on March 14.While Rs 27 crore headlines Pant’s historic contract, the actual net payout will be a different story due to tax implications.Lucknow have committed Rs 27 crore per season for Pant's services with the team. The Indian government will claim Rs 8.1 crore in tax (30%) from his total contract value. This leaves Pant with a net salary of Rs 18.9 crore per season from his IPL team.Speaking about Rishabh Pant's move to LSG, former India player Robin Uthappa opined, “I think the fact that Shreyas was bid for by Punjab Kings was a planned thing, because even if they didn’t go for him, because they had the luxury of having such a big bank, they could have gotten Pant for a little less. I think there was communication where Rishabh really wanted to move on from everything that was DC in the past and go on to other things in life and I think that is why there was less interest from Ponting and Punjab Kings for Pant and more interest in Shreyas.”Another ex-India player, Mohammad Kaif, said, ""With Rishabh Pant joining LSG, the team has gained both a strong brand value and a recognisable face—an essential factor for any franchise. While LSG do not have many big names apart from Pooran, Pant’s presence will significantly benefit them. The decision to jump from ₹21 crore to ₹27 crore was aggressive, but it’s a move that seems justified. They now have an Indian captain, and securing Rishabh Pant at ₹27 crore is a worthwhile deal for LSG.""Rs 27 crore (per season)Rs 8.1 crore (as per Indian government regulations)Rs 18.9 crore (per season).","Rishabh Pant becomes most expensive IPL player after he goes to LSG for Rs 27 crore.

IPL Auction: Will it be MS Dhoni's 'last hurrah'?

NEW DELHI: Joe Root , one of England's greatest-ever cricketers, marked a significant milestone by becoming the fourth English player and the 11th in the world to play 150 Test matches. The first Test against New Zealand in Christchurch was expected to be a celebration of Root's illustrious career, but it turned into an anticlimactic occasion as the premier batter was dismissed for a duck in the first innings.The 33-year-old Root, who had entered the match with a staggering 12,754 Test runs at an average of 51.01, was bowled by New Zealand medium-pacer Nathan Smith . Attempting to punch the ball through the covers, Root got an inside edge that brushed his back thigh before deflecting onto the stumps.The dismissal placed Root in an unfortunate club, as he became only the third batter to be out for a duck in their 150th Test. He joined Australian legends Steve Waugh , who suffered the fate against Pakistan in Sharjah in 2002, and Ricky Ponting , who was dismissed for zero against England in Adelaide in 2010.Despite the disappointment in Christchurch, Root’s recent form has been nothing short of spectacular. He has amassed 1,338 runs this year alone at an average of 55.75, including five centuries and four fifties. With 35 Test centuries in his career, Root continues to be a pivotal figure for England, although Friday's duck was the 13th in his 12-year Test career.Root's achievement of reaching 150 Tests underscores his longevity and consistency at the highest level of the game. While the milestone innings may not have gone as planned, it serves as a testament to a career filled with remarkable contributions to England's Test cricket legacy.","Joe Root becomes the fourth English player and the 11th in the world to play 150 Test matches.

NEW DELHI: Tristan Stubbs made his mark as a big-hitting Twenty20 specialist, but the South African batsman revealed after scoring a gritty Test century against Sri Lanka on Friday that red-ball cricket is his true passion.Stubbs and captain Temba Bavuma both hit centuries to put South Africa in a commanding position before their bowlers reduced Sri Lanka to 103 for five by the close of play on the third day of the first Test at Kingsmead.Stubbs (122) and Bavuma (113) forged a mammoth fourth-wicket partnership of 249, grinding down the Sri Lankan bowlers. South Africa declared their second innings at 366 for five at tea, setting Sri Lanka an imposing target of 516 runs.Speaking to SuperSport, Stubbs, 24, acknowledged the challenges of batting for over five hours alongside Bavuma.“I never felt I was really in; I had to stick to my game plan and be really disciplined. You couldn’t hit on the up really,” he said.Despite being signed by Delhi Capitals for $1.15 million for the next Indian Premier League season, Stubbs explained that his six-hitting ability is a relatively new skill.""Through school and university, I was a nudger,"" he said. ""Since Covid, I got a bit stronger and then I could really hit the ball. I had to find the balance, which took some time.""I prefer the red-ball game. You can bat for long. It’s a lot more of a mental game. I’ve played very little red-ball cricket, so I’m always learning. But I love it and am just trying to grow as quickly as I can.”Bavuma echoed Stubbs' sentiment about the difficulty of batting conditions. “It forced you to stay in your plans,” he said.The South African skipper reflected on scoring his third century in 60 Tests, a milestone he said was deeply satisfying. “Hundreds are a currency, and there is a lot of confidence that comes from scoring a hundred.“In terms of the (team) batting line-up as well, we are starting to reach a stage where each innings we believe someone can score a hundred. For me personally, from a mental point of view, I am starting to find a little bit of a formula as to how I can go from scoring not just fifties and sixties but going on and putting the team in a very strong position.”Sri Lanka, who were bowled out for a record-low 42 in the first innings, continued to struggle against South Africa’s fast bowlers.The experienced Dimuth Karunaratne fell early for the second time in the match, edging Kagiso Rabada to Stubbs at third slip for four. Pathum Nissanka showed some intent with 23 off 31 balls but fell leg before wicket to Gerald Coetzee soon after surviving a no-ball dismissal from Rabada.Marco Jansen, who claimed seven for 13 in the first innings, added to Sri Lanka’s woes by dismissing Angelo Mathews (25) and Kamindu Mendis (10). Prabath Jayasuriya , the nightwatchman, fell to a sharp reflex catch off Rabada at short leg after scoring just one.","Tristan Stubbs says red-ball cricket is his true passion.

Mohammed Shami returns to competitive cricket as India get boost ahead of BGT

NEW DELHI: Madhya Pradesh's victory over Bengal in the domestic cricket clash was overshadowed by a worrying moment involving veteran Indian pacer Mohammed Shami Chasing down a modest 190-run target in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy on Friday, Madhya Pradesh managed to wrap up the proceedings with six wickets at their hands. Rajat Patidar 's aggressive 68 off 40 balls and Subhranshu Senapati ’s steady 50 off 33 balls helped MP comfortably seal the win. However, the spotlight shifted to Mohammed Shami’s health scare during the game.Bowling the penultimate over, Shami took a tumble while attempting to stop a shot, appearing to injure his boot and hold his lower back in discomfort, as reported by PTI.Having recently returned from a prolonged injury layoff, the sight of him lying on the ground sparked concern. Nitin Patel , head of the medical panel at the Centre of Excellence, rushed to evaluate the pacer. Fortunately, the incident caused no significant damage, bringing relief to the Bengal camp.Earlier this month, Shami made a remarkable comeback to competitive cricket as Bengal registered a narrow 11-run victory over Madhya Pradesh in theHis impactful seven-wicket haul and a crucial 37-run knock in the Ranji Trophy Elite Group C match were instrumental in the win.As Bengal prepare for upcoming matches in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy, Shami's fitness remains crucial, not just for domestic games but also for India’s international calendar.The injury scare may have ended without major consequences, but it underscores the importance of managing Shami’s workload as he makes his way back into the game.","Madhya Pradesh beat Bengal by six wickets in Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy.

But MP skipper Rajat Patidar continued his great form to steady the innings after Bengal bowlers made early inroads reducing them to 42 for two inside the first six overs.The Royal Challengers Bengaluru player quickly took control, sharing a solid 114-run third-wicket stand with Subhranshu Senapati (50) to keep Bengal at bay. However, pacer Sayan Ghosh raised hopes of a Bengal comeback when he dismissed both the batters in the same over. First he castled Senapati and then had Patidar caught by Ritwik Roy Chowdhury two balls later after Patidar hit his third half-century of this tournament getting 60 off just 40 deliveries with the help of six fours and four sixes.However, the recently-held IPL auction’s sensation Ventakesh Iyer (12) and Harpreet Singh Bhatia (21) ensured there were no more hiccups as the duo took the side home getting 190 in 19.4 overs.It was another poor show from comeback man Mohammed Shami who went for 38 runs in his four overs without any success.

BRIEF SCORES

NAGPUR: One more blistering fifty by Karun Nair and another clinical show by the bowlers guided Vidarbha to their third win in four matches of the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy . Vidarbha dished out a near perfect T20 game to thrash Assam by eight wickets in Vizag on Friday.Chasing a 124-run target, Vidarbha romped home in the 14th over to grab four points from the encounter. The chase was powered by Nair's power-packed 75-run knock. Nair hit eight boundaries and four sixes in his 47-ball stay.Despite the first over dismissal of Atharva Taide (5;4b;1x4), Nair and Mandar Mahale 31* (27b;3x4) took the attack to the Assam bowlers.

NEW DELHI: The International Cricket Council ( ICC ) Board had a brief virtual meeting today and the members will soon be taking a call on the 2025 edition of the Champions Trophy . It's reliably learnt that during the meeting, which lasted a little over 15 minutes, all members aligned with India's decision of not travelling to Pakistan for the multi-nation event next year.""All members are aware of India's stance and aligned with their decision of not travelling to Pakistan due to no clearance from the government,"" says an ICC official aware of developments.The tournament is played in a hybrid model where all matches involving India are played at a neutral venueThe entire tournament is moved out of Pakistan and Pakistan Cricket Board retains the hosting rightsThe Board is likely to reconvene in the next few days to decide on the way forward and end the impasse. The global cricket body has already missed the deadline of announcing the fixtures 100 days before the start of the tournament, and would now hope that a resolution is reached over the weekend.PCB has so far maintained its stance of opposing the hybrid model but there could be a change there when the Board meets again. In case they threaten to pull out or not accept the hybrid model, there is a bright possibility of the tournament moving out of Pakistan and even going ahead without Pakistan.""At this stage, don't be surprised if the tournament is played out of Pakistan, and even without Pakistan. If PCB doesn't accept the hybrid model, there is a bright possibility of that happening too,"" adds the official.It remains to be seen how the PCB reacts now but at this stage, it's either hybrid or the tournament completely moves out of Pakistan.",All members aligned with India's decision of not travelling to Pakistan for the multi-nation event next year.

NEW DELHI: Team India will take on Australia Prime Minister XI in what will be a two-day pink-ball practice match ahead of the second Test in Adelaide at Border-Gavaskar Trophy (BGT), with the first session starting at 9:10 AM IST (2:40 PM local time).Having participated in four day-night Tests since the concept's inception, Team India has painted a positive picture with their result. They have secured dominant wins against Bangladesh, England, and Sri Lanka.However, their lone pink-ball loss came in the infamous ""36 all-out"" game against Australia in Adelaide, underlining the challenges of adapting to the conditions under lights ahead of the Adelaide Test in the latest edition of BGT.Having already shown his glimpses of brilliance on Australian soil, Kohli has been a standout performer in pink-ball Tests.Across four matches in day-night Tests, Kohli has amassed 277 runs in six innings, with a highest score of 136 against Bangladesh in India’s maiden day-night Test in 2019 at Eden Gardens.With sharp running between the wickets and an ability to handle the pink ball’s movement, Kohli appears to be India's most reliable bet under lights.In the infamous 2020 Adelaide Test, Kohli scored a valiant 74 in the first innings, standing out as India’s top scorer before the team’s historic “36 all-out” collapse in the second innings.Team India skipper Rohit Sharma , who has joined the BGT squad after missing the first Test in Perth for the birth of his second child, has also been a consistent contributor in pink-ball matches.In seven innings across four Tests, Rohit has scored 235 runs, with his highest score of 66 coming against England in the Ahmedabad Test in 2021.Rishabh Pant, with his fearless aggression, has left a mark in pink-ball cricket despite playing only three matches.In five innings, he has scored 198 runs, including a scintillating 103 not out in an unofficial game against Australia A in 2020. Pant’s attacking approach suits the unpredictability of pink-ball cricket, where quick scoring can change the game’s dynamics.Ravichandran Ashwin has been India’s go-to bowler in pink-ball matches, taking 18 wickets in four games.His best performance came against England in 2021 at Ahmedabad, where he took 4/48 in an innings, playing a key role in India’s win.He also shone in the 2020 Adelaide Test, taking five wickets across both innings. However, it remains unclear whether India will be making any changes to their winning formation going into the Adelaide Test this time. Jasprit Bumrah , the hero of India's triumphant victory in Perth, has been a game-changer with the pink ball, claiming 13 wickets in five matches, including a devastating 5/24 against Sri Lanka in Bengaluru in 2022.Bumrah’s ability to swing the pink ball and execute precise yorkers under lights has made him one of India’s most lethal bowlers in day-night Tests.Shubman Gill, one of India’s rising talents, has also shown promise in pink-ball cricket.In two matches, including an unofficial tour game, Gill has scored 134 runs, with a highest score of 65 against Australia A in 2020.Several players in India's current squad, including Yashasvi Jaiswal , KL Rahul, Dhruv Jurel, Nitish Reddy, Harshit Rana, Sarfaraz Khan, and Akash Deep, are yet to feature in a pink-ball Test.Hence, the two-day practice match will help them assess their mettle under lthe ights ahead of the all-important 2nd Test in the high-octane five-match series.",Team India will take on Australia Prime Minister XI in a two-day pink-ball practice match ahead of the second Test in Adelaide.

India's assistant coach Abhishek Nayar discussed team dynamics and the roles of senior players like Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja . He highlighted the importance of senior players accepting their exclusion from the playing XI for the benefit of the team. He emphasized that having statesmen like Ashwin and Jadeja makes this transition smoother.Nayar referenced the recent exclusion of both Ashwin and Jadeja from the first Test against Australia in Perth. Washington Sundar was chosen based on current form and batting proficiency on bouncy pitches.While Jadeja's batting skills usually guarantee him a spot in overseas Tests, the team opted for a different strategy in this instance.""It's only tough when you have seniors who don't understand it. But when you have seniors like Jaddu and Ash who understand what the team is trying to do, it becomes very easy, because the team first policy is something that Rohit and Gauti bhai believe in,"" Nayar, a former Mumbai Ranji stalwart, told reporters on the eve of India's two-day practice game against Prime Minister's XI in Canberra.He commended both Rohit Sharma and Gautam Gambhir for promoting a team-first philosophy. He believed the entire team, including veteran spinners Ashwin and Jadeja, have embraced this approach.""I feel they have all bought into it. So I felt very happy that Jaddu and Ashwin are going to help the younger guys so that they do well here. It wasn't very hard (to explain them) and culture is such that everyone wants Team India to win,"" the former all-rounder said.Nayar addressed the potential role of spinners in the upcoming matches. He offered a general perspective on their involvement.""I always feel in a game of cricket, nobody is out of the game and whether you are a spinner or a fast bowler, you are always in with a chance.""Nayar explained that a bowler's plans and delivery style might need adjustments depending on the conditions. This is especially true when facing a pink ball, due to limited experience with it.""Yes, your plans will change, how you release the ball and at what pace, will change, which is why you want to prepare with it (pink ball).""He remained optimistic about the chances of top-class spinners, even with the challenges presented by the pink ball.""May be, a little more challenging than the red ball and primarily because you haven't bowled as much with pink ball. But I believe any top class spinner will have an opportunity,"" he added.",India's assistant coach Abhishek Nayar discussed team dynamics and the roles of senior players like Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja.

Goa exploit Blasters' defensive frailties to eke out a 1-0 victory,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/indian-super-league/top-stories/goa-exploit-blasters-defensive-frailties-to-eke-out-a-1-0-victory/articleshow/115789736.cms,"KOCHI: Kerala Blasters once again paid a heavy price for their defensive mistakes as they slumped to a 0-1 defeat against FC Goa in the Indian Super League match at Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium here on Thursday.The decisive moment of the game came in the 40th minute when Boris Singh capitalised on goalkeeper Sachin Suresh 's lack of alertness and agility to score the all-important goal. The defeat was particularly concerning for the home fans as the visitors secured their victory despite limited playing time from their key players-Armando Sadiku, Borja Herrera, and Udanta Singh-who spent less than 20 minutes on the pitch.The victory propelled FC Goa to fifth spot in ISL standings with 15 points from nine games, while Blasters are stuck in ninth place with 11 points.Goa dictated the opening exchanges but waited almost until half-time to break the deadlock. Boris marched forward on the right flank and, as he approached closer to the box, unleashed a shot from a narrow angle. However, Blasters' goalkeeper Sachin not only failed to parry the ball away but saw it deflect off his hand and land in the goal, much to the dismay of his teammates and local fans.While Sachin's mistake led to the goal, the responsibility extends beyond him. The defensive lapses evident from the beginning of the match played a crucial role in Blasters conceding. Boris exploited a substantial gap on the right flank, which emerged when Blasters' left wing-back Naocha Singh advanced forward. Midfielder Freddy Lallawmawma, tasked with covering this space, couldn't track Boris' run and allowed him the chance to unleash a shot from close to the box.In the 57th minute, Blasters' coach Mikael Stahre made a triple substitution, bringing in Korou Singh, Kwame Peprah, and Sandeep Singh to replace Pritam Kotal, Jesus Jimenez, and Rahul KP respectively. These changes proved beneficial and provided Blasters with renewed momentum. The partnership between Peprah and Korou on the right wing proved effective, as the duo generated numerous attacking possibilities in the Goa penalty area. However, a goal eluded the hosts.In the 81st minute, Blasters nearly equalised from Luna's freekick. His excellent strike targeted the top right-hand corner of the goal, but Goa's goalkeeper Hrithik Tiwari made an outstanding save. The closing minutes saw intense pressure from Blasters, but the Goa defence held firm. Their best opportunity came in the final minute of added-on time when Luna's precise header found Sandeep Singh inside Goa's box. However, his execution was poor, and the ball missed the target.",Boris Singh capitalised on goalkeeper Sachin Suresh's lack of alertness and agility to score the all-important goal.

NEW DELHI: Following Real Madrid 's 2-0 loss to Liverpool in the Champions League on Wednesday night, the Spanish club's team bus was involved in a traffic collision on the M40 motorway in England.Social media footage showed the stationary team bus crashed into a lorry (semi-truck). While no players or staff were aboard at the time, the vehicle was transporting the team's equipment and kit.Warwickshire Police issued a statement confirming they responded to reports of a collision involving a car, lorry, and the busof a ""well-known football team"" on the M40 southbound between junctions 16 and 15. No serious injuries occurred as the police noted the players were not on board the bus when the incident happened.“Our officers responded to reports of a collision involving a car, a lorry, and the coach of a well-known football team on the M40 southbound between junction 16 for Hockley Heath and junction 15 for Warwick. Fortunately, nobody was seriously injured. The players from the well-known football team were not on the coach at the time,"" the statement from Warwickshire Police reads.It is standard practice for teams to fly home immediately after European away matches.However, the team bus still needs to be driven back to the club's home city. The M40 would be the conventional route for a vehicle travelling from the northwest of England back towards the south coast of Spain.Real Madrid, the defending Champions League winners, suffered a disappointing 2-0 defeat at Anfield against Liverpool. Alexis Mac Allister and Cody Gakpo scored for Liverpool, while Kylian Mbappe missed a penalty for Real Madrid as his struggles continued.This was not the first time Real's team bus was involved in a crash. In February, after a Champions League match against RB Leipzig, the bus collided with a Toyota car during the journey from the airport due to a re-routing caused by a strike.The newly designed luxury Real Madrid team bus was unveiled in October 2024, featuring hi-tech branding intended to match the club's revamped $1.5 billion Bernabeu stadium renovation.","Real Madrid's team bus was involved in a traffic collision on the M40 motorway in England.

KOLKATA: Monkey D Luffy, the famous manga and anime character, is an embodiment of strength, flexibility and quest for freedom – the three attributes of Alaaeddine Ajaraie that have taken Indian Super League ( ISL ) by storm en route his record-breaking show so far.So, the NorthEast United star’s chosen Luffy celebration after each of his 14 goals for the Highlanders — some of which were outrageous individual efforts — so far is not borne out of flippancy and the Highlanders fans have loved it each time, making it a trend on their social media handles.“I don’t watch anime too much, but I love this one. I liked the character of Luffy and that’s how I thought of doing this celebration,” Alaaedine said in an exclusive interview with. “I started it only this season because that is how I want people to remember me and when I see our Young Highlanders celebrate like me, it gives me happiness.”The 31-year-old – from a football-loving family with his father once a footballer in native Morocco – began his ISL sojourn with NEUFC after a lacklustre season in the Moroccan top tier, scoring just thrice in 29 appearances for his hometown club FAR Rabat.However, upon discussion with compatriots at NEUFC, Hamza Regragui and Mohammed Ali Bemammer, who told him about “the CEO, the head coach and the entire staff, who make everything possible”. Hence, Alaaeddine joined NEUFC on a one-year contract and was on song from his first game. His goalscoring spree that broke and bettered Brazilian Elano’s record of scoring consecutively in first six ISL games to eight, only took a break after 11 goals, in his ninth game of the league last week.“Frankly, I did not know about this record. After the game, I opened ‘Instagram’ and saw our club’s post. It makes me happy that my name is taken in the same breath as Elano, who has achieved so much in Indian football and football in general,” said ISL’s Player-of-the-Month for October.“I am happy that I have so far managed to help the team with 11 goals. It’s a long season and I am fully focused on my job of helping the team and without their help, I wouldn’t be able to score so many goals.”Head coach Juan Pedro Benali, who has had Alaaeddine on his radar courtesy the experience of working in Morocco, has also given his star attacker the freedom to play in different positions. And he has thrived as a striker, a winger or a No. 10 as his teammates have supported him in all the roles.The Moroccan’s scorching form has been a major factor in NEUFC’s best start to an ISL season and has catapulted them to the third spot on the league table, ahead of Friday’s clash against East Bengal here.“At NEUFC, we are a very good team, (with) nice people working to improve each day. So, if we continue the hard work and trust the process, we believe the results will take care of themselves,” the Moroccan opined. “The first step would be to qualify for the playoffs and then we take it from there. But for us, it’s always about one game at a time.”Having also plied his trade in Qatar, Alaaeddine also spoke of ISL as the perfect fit for his game.“ISL is a competitive league, and I felt that I could thrive here. I had offers from other clubs as well, but I chose NEUFC because of the good things I had heard,” he said. “The level of competition is very high in ISL. When I compare it with Qatar, I feel that the ISL is better for me as a player because of the high volume of quality players that makes it a tough league.”But his most memorable game is still the title-winning Durand Cup final against Mohun Bagan here, in which he had begun the second-half fightback for his team.“The Durand Cup final comes to my mind first. Everybody thought that Mohun Bagan would win the final. But the way we came back was special. It feels nice to win the first-ever trophy in the history of NEUFC,” said the 31-year-old.The Highlanders fans hope for more such adventures for their Luffy and more occasions to celebrate with their hero.","NorthEast United star Alaaeddine Ajaraie has scored 14 goals so far in Indian Super League.

CHENNAI: Chennaiyin FC head coach Owen Coyle has said that scouting players at a young age is critical and that tournaments like the Reliance Foundation Development League ( RFDL ) are much-needed as they provide a platform for youngsters to climb the ladder in Indian football.The RFDL 2024-25 season kicked off in Goa on Monday and features 54 teams, including sides from Indian Super League (ISL) and I-League clubs.It is to be remembered that some youngsters who are currently playing in the ISL – N Sivasakthi, Naorem Roshan Singh (both Bengaluru FC), Vibin Mohanan and Mohammed Aimen (both Kerala Blasters FC) – had competed in the RFDL before rising through the ranks.“With the population of India, I think that we have huge potential in football, especially at the youth level. Initiatives like the RFDL are the need of the hour to provide a much-deserved platform and opportunity for talented players,” said 58-year-old Coyle, who is into his fifth season in Indian football (first being 2019-20).“While the ISL is doing its part for the senior teams, I think that we must catch these talented players at a young age, provide them with the right kind of opportunities and enable them to make their way into the India national team,” added Coyle.A few months ago, Coyle had spoken about the importance of clubs producing and developing home-grown talent. “There is talent in India, there is no doubt about it. There should be more investment at the grassroot level; it is not about getting players when they are 16 or 17 years old. Players will have to be spotted at eight or nine,” Coyle had said.“I need to find a pathway for young players coming through (via the CFC development team). Nothing will please me more than getting young players from Tamil Nadu. That is important… you have them playing for Chennaiyin and TN. It will be great and amazing for everybody. It will also help associate better with the fans,” Coyle added.","Reliance Foundation Development League ( RFDL) kicks off in Goa on Monday.

KOLKATA: Dial ‘C’ when in trouble. And Bengaluru FC did just that to get past Mohammedan Sporting Club 2-1 in their ISL match at the Kishore Bharati Krirangan here on Wednesday.Down 0-1, Sunil Chhetri joined action in the 53rd minute and immediately made an impact by injecting momentum in the team’s attack. The former India international then made all the difference by scoring from the spot in the 82nd minute and finishing off things with a well-timed jump to head one that went in kissing Florent Ogier’s head in the added-on time. The victory saw BFC dethrone Mohun Bagan from the top of points table with 20 points, three more than Bagan playing a game less, from nine matches.Chhetri and records go hand-in-hand and on Wednesday the striker added one more by becoming the first player in ISL history to score against 15 different opponents.It was another heartbreak for Mohammedan who continued to wait for their maiden win at home once again suffering reverse late in a match.Contrary to the trend this season where Mohammedan have taken in four goals in the opening 15 minutes, it was the black-and-white brigade which drew first blood when an unmarked Cesar Manzoki headed in from a corner kick in the eighth minute of the match to put the hosts ahead.Stunned by the reverse, Bengaluru took time to settle down and started playing possession football to get a grip on proceedings. They came close to scoring when Argentina’s Pereyra Diaz back-heeled to Australian Dale Williams but the latter’s shot was timely blocked by Zuidika.Mohammedan too got their chance in the second half but Alexis Gomes, replacing Brazilian attacker Carlos Franca, hit back-to-back shots, which were negated by diving goalkeeper Gurpreet Singh before the second drinks break.Scorer Manzoki was guilty of grabbing Luis Pedro in a melee during a corner kick which forced referee Crystal John to award a penalty. Super-sub Chhetri equalised, placing the ball to the right of goalkeeper Bhaskar Roy. The 40-year-old showed glimpses of his vintage form when he anticipated a cross well and made a good connection that went in touching defender Ogier’s head silencing the home supporters.","Bengaluru FC dethrone Mohun Bagan from the top of points table with 20 points, three more than Bagan playing a game less.

Real Madrid's key attacking player for their Champions League match against Liverpool on Wednesday will be Kylian Mbappe , due to Vinicius Junior's injury.Real Madrid will face Liverpool at Anfield on Thursday in a crucial Champions League match, but they will be without Vinicius Junior. In addition to Junior's absence, Real Madrid has struggled in the tournament, losing two out of four games and currently sitting in 21st place.The French captain has had a difficult start in the Spanish capital, both on and off the field. However, he finally scored his first goal in five matches during Sunday's La Liga game against Leganes.Coach Carlo Ancelotti started Mbappe in his preferred left-wing position, and Mbappe rewarded him by scoring the opening goal at Butarque.It's worth noting that Vinicius created the scoring opportunity for Mbappe. With the Brazilian player sidelined for over three weeks, Mbappe will have to take on the responsibility of leading Real Madrid's attack, starting with the game at Anfield.Liverpool currently leads the Champions League group, while defending champions Real Madrid are in 18th place after surprising defeats to Lille and AC Milan in their first four matches.In those four matches, Vinicius scored four Champions League goals, while Mbappe has only scored once in the European competition.Mbappe has scored seven goals in 12 La Liga appearances, which isn't a poor record. However, given his superstar status, his overall performances have been somewhat underwhelming.The French forward, who was left out of his national team's squad for the last two international breaks, believes he is gradually finding his form.Real Madrid will be looking to improve their standing in the Champions League group table. Liverpool, on the other hand, will aim to maintain their lead.Sony Sports Network is the official broadcaster of the UEFA Champions League in India.

Punjab did exactly that on Tuesday, winning 3-0 at the Mumbai Football Arena to move into fourth spot with a smart tactical game. Panagiotis Dilmperis's side have 15 points from eight games, while Mumbai City remain in 10th spot with 10 points.It was a well-earned victory as Punjab not only neutralised the threat that the ISL Cup champions pose with their passing game but also effectively found the opportunities to score on either side of the half-time break. Their third goal in the 84th minute put a stamp of authority on their victory.Norbert Ezequiel Vidal put the visitors ahead with a left foot placement in added-on time of the first half. Immediately after the break, Mumbai City substitute Franklin Nazareth fouled Filip Mrzjlak inside the box and Luka Majcen stepped up to score from the spot in the 53rd minute. Punjab's third goal came from the foot of Norwegian forward Mushaga Bakenga , who shot from inside the box even as Mumbai's defence was guilty of being too slow to react.Punjab cut down the space that Mumbai's pacy wingers Lallianzuala Chhangte and Bipin Singh thrive in. Punjab played great defence, thanks to some robust play, and plonked two central midfielders ahead of their four-man defence to blunt the threats posed by Jon Miquel Toral Harper and Jayesh Rane, as Brandon Fernandes started on the bench.After the initial skirmishes, it was the Islanders who showed some keenness with a few moves and openings that tested the Punjab defence. But the visitors rode it. At times they even managed to isolate the Mumbai defence and it was one such move that provided Vidal with the opportunity to shoot from outside the box.After conceding the second goal, Mumbai pushed up, and with a quarter of an hour left, they seemed to have scored from a corner. Without the aid of VAR, however, it would have been asking a lot from the officials to notice that the ball seemed to have crossed the goalline as TV replays showed. Then came the third Punjab goal, leaving Mumbai City coach Petr Kratky to reflect on his team's first home loss in nine matches.","Norbert Ezequiel Vidal put the visitors ahead with a left foot placement in added-on time of the first half.

De Minaur saved two but Sinner converted the third with a passing shot to serve for the match.Sinner claimed victory when De Minaur returned badly wide and mangled his racquet in sheer frustration.""He hasn't won a million matches this year for no reason -- it was tough,"" admitted De Minaur.""It's like trying to solve a puzzle that not a lot of people have managed to solve.""His ball speed, his consistency, it feels like there's no real let down of focus throughout the whole match.""Berrettini was superb in the doubles decider as Italy beat Argentina in the quarter-finals and captain Filippo Volandri rewarded him with selection in the opening clash in place of Lorenzo Musetti.Berrettini watched on as Italy won the Davis Cup for the first time in 47 years in 2023, not part of the squad but cheering from the sidelines as he recovered from an ankle injury.This year he has been able to play an important role in Italy's charge towards the final.""After I lost the first set it wasn't easy to digest that, but when I'm fighting for my country with this crowd... I kept on fighting,"" said Berrettini.Kokkinakis clung on to take the first set to a tie-break which he shaded.Berrettini claimed the second with a break in the eighth game, which he served out.Kokkinakis survived two break points in the first game of the third set and no others emerged in an even battle until the 11th game when he conceded two more.Berrettini capitalised on the first and clinched the set with an ace to delight thousands of Italian supporters at the Martin Carpena arena.""I felt I was playing an away tie, it was tough on Australia -- we were playing in Spain but I thought we were in Italy,"" said Kokkinakis, echoing prior Australian complaints about the revamped Davis Cup format.""Once again we're a long way from Australia aren't we?"" said captain Lleyton Hewitt.""It will be nice when they take our bid seriously to host the finals, Australia will put on a bloody good event.""",Italy beat Australia 2-0 in Davis Cup final in Malaga.

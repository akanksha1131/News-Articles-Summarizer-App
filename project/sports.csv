MI in IPL 2025: After wooden spoon, Mumbai Indians target better show

IPL 2025: How will KKR, MI, CSK, SRH, RCB fare this season?

TimesofIndia.com in Chennai: Four players made their Indian Premier League debut in the Chennai Super Kings vs Mumbai Indians clash at Chepauk on Sunday but it was the little-known Vignesh Puthur who made a splash in front of a packed house. The 24-year-old chinaman bowler , son of an auto driver, from Malappuram in Kerala was the latest dispatch from MI's scouting stable, and the youngster made instant impact with 3/32 against a star-studded CSK outfit.Puthur's journey to MI's blue and gold is a fascinating one as he was picked up at the auction for Rs 30 lakh after an impressive show in the franchise's trials. Amongst the many who had assembled, Puthur caught the attention with his accuracy, consistent turn and ability to keep a cool head under pressure. It was enough to raise the paddle and from there on, the management chalked out a plan to groom the inexperienced spinner who had very little exposure at the higher level.The MI Cape Town unit was set to assemble in South Africa for the SA20 in January and Puthur was summoned as a net bowler and spent a lot of time working on his skills with the likes of Rashid Khan. The invaluable experience of rubbing shoulders with the greats of the game did his confidence a world of good and he even played three games for the Reliance team in the DY Patil T20 tournament before the pre-season preparations got underway.In the nets, during match simulations and practice fixtures, the management led by head coach Mahela Jayawardene were convinced to give the boy an early chance in the IPL and feedback from Rohit Sharma and Suryakumar Yadav also pushed his case.""Rohit, Surya, Tillak, all these guys batted against him (in the nets)... it wasn't easy that easy (to pick him). So one of the reasons we felt that we have the confidence of pushing him in this game. And it turned out to be excellent. It was a good decision,"" said MI bowling coach Paras Mhambrey .He lavished praise on the scouting team, who unearthed Puthur from the Kerala Cricket League, for unearthing a talent like him and further explained what they look for when picking these youngsters.""We have good guys who can spot talent. I think the idea with MI is seeing the potential more than anything else. And when we saw him for one of our trials, we saw the potential in him. Rather than looking into how much cricket he's played in the past. But it's purely thought that he has the potential. And you saw that today,"" added Mhambrey.Amidst deafening whistles and chants, Puthur returned with the wickets of Ruturaj Gaikwad, Shivam Dube and Deepak Hooda but what impressed the MI dugout the most was his ability to hold nerves and handle the pressure. It was something they had worked on behind the scenes and the regular conversations with coaches Mahela, Kieron Pollard and senior players like Rohit helped Puthur understand his role, expectations of the team and the culture of the MI dressing room.""Yes, he hasn't played much cricket. But we got an opportunity where he worked a little bit. Got an opportunity to work with him after we had a couple of trials. Not purely on the skill work so much really. I think that he is pretty much sorted out there I feel. But more about the conversations that he had an opportunity with MJ. Or Pollard. Or the batters, especially Surya and Rohit. I think that really helped with him in understanding the requirements. And understanding his role in the team. And what we expect out of him,"" explained Mhambrey.Sharing the dressing room with India and overseas stars, having a post-match chat with MS Dhoni is the stuff dreams are made of, and Puthur lived that on Sunday night. The social media traction sky-rocketed in lightning quick time but the bowling coach asserts he is a ""sweet kid"" just soaking it all in ""like a sponge"".""He's a lovely kid to have in the team. He's more like a sponge right now, just absorbing everything, looking around, you know, having conversations. I thought not everyone gets an opportunity in a dressing room to get an opportunity to chat with MJ, someone who has so much experience. Surya, Tilak, Rohit, you know, all these guys. He's just listening.""You have heroes, you see them playing on the TV, and all of a sudden you're sharing that dressing room with them, sitting next to someone like Rohit. It's a dream come true for a lot of these guys, right? But purely the way he responded... never looked like he was under pressure from the very first ball. And that was good to see,"" says Mhambrey.The first impression has been a good one and now everyone in the MI dugout would hope it turns out to be a long and successful innings like their previous boy wonders - Jasprit Bumrah, Hardik Pandya, Krunal Pandya, Tilak Varma - who went on to become household names.",Vignesh Puthur made his IPL debut against Chennai Super Kings on Sunday. The 24-year-old chinaman bowler was picked up at the auction for Rs 30 lakh. He took 3/32 against a star-studded CSK outfit at Chepauk.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119404032,imgsize-137206,width-400,resizemode-4/119404032.jpg"

NEW DELHI: In yet another milestone to his storied career, Rohit Sharma on Sunday became the second-most capped player in Indian Premier League (IPL) history during the third match of IPL 2025 between Mumbai Indians and Chennai Super Kings With Mumbai winning/losing the toss and Rohit making the playing eleven, it marked his 258th appearance.The match, held at the iconic MA Chidambaram Stadium, saw Rohit edge past Dinesh Karthik (257 matches) and now trail only MS Dhoni, who leads the chart with 265 IPL appearances.Rohit’s journey in the IPL began back in 2008 with the Deccan Chargers before he became the face of Mumbai Indians, captaining the side to five IPL titles.Over 17 seasons, he has amassed 6628 runs, including 2 centuries, and maintained a solid average of 29.72. Beyond his batting, Rohit has also contributed with the ball early in his career and holds over 100 catches, showcasing his all-round value.His latest milestone comes during an intense fixture often dubbed the ""El Clasico of IPL"".Despite no longer leading the side, Rohit remains a central figure for Mumbai, especially in a transitional phase following Hardik Pandya ’s appointment as captain and the absence of key players like Jasprit Bumrah and Hardik himself (suspended for one match due to over-rate violation).With the pressure mounting and Mumbai looking to bounce back from a poor 2024 campaign, Rohit's experience and presence are more valuable than ever -- not just for his runs at the top of the order, but for his calm leadership in crunch moments.",Rohit Sharma becomes second-most capped player in Indian Premier League (IPL) history.

KKR in IPL 2025: Kolkata Knight Riders seek successful title defence

RCB in IPL 2025: Royal Challengers Bengaluru chase maiden title

Kolkata: It doesn’t matter whether he’s playing for KKR or RCB, Phil Salt can still do the impossible. The former KKR opener eased into his new role as Virat Kohli’s opening partner at RCB by hitting a 31-ball 56 (9x4, 6x2) against his old team. Kohli too came good in the IPL season opener with a 36-ball 59 not out as RCB, chasing 175, finished things off in style, with seven wickets and 22 balls to spare, here at the Eden Gardens on Saturday night.Salt essentially did what Quinton de Kock couldn’t. The Knight Riders suffered an early jolt when they lost opener De Kock off the fifth ball of the match. Although the purple brigade’s new skipper Ajinkya Rahane and Sunil Narine steadied the innings with a 103-run second-wicket stand, the power-packed batting unit failed to fire against the spinners, particularly Krunal Pandya (3/29 off his four overs), eventually putting up 174/8 after RCB skipper Rajat Patidar put them in after winning the toss.Salt, on the other hand, began dictating terms right from the word go against his former side. The opener took Vaibhav Arora, who came in as an ‘Impact Player’ for Angkrish Raghuvanshi, to the cleaners, hitting him for two fours and one six in the third over. Rahane was forced to bring in his key player Varun Chakravarthy early, but the Englishman collected 21 runs in the mystery spinner’s first over with three fours and one six.Virat Kohli then set the packed Eden stands on fire with spectacular consecutive sixes over left-arm pacer Spencer Johnson’s head in the very next over as RCB collected 80 runs in the first six overs to set the tone. Chakravarthy finally got Salt caught by Johnson at short third man for a well-made 56 off 31 balls.But there was no stopping chasemaster Kohli, who got to his fifty in 30 balls. Kohli stayed unbeaten with the help of four fours and three sixes and Patidar played a 16-ball 34 cameo. Liam Livingstone finished off with a boundary off Johnson.Earlier, Pandya, for whom RCB went specifically at the auction, did not disappoint as the left-arm spinner put the brakes on the KKR innings in the middle overs, bowling stump to stump. He not only dried up the runs from his end but clean bowled Venkatesh Iyer (6) and Rinku Singh (12).An expensive Suyash Sharma ended on a happy note by picking up the prized wicket of Andre Russell when the West Indian missed a slog, the ball coming in sharply to dislodge his stumps. KKR lost the momentum, losing five wickets for 43 runs.","Virat Kohli scored an unbeaten fifty for RCB in their win against KKR in IPL 2025.

IPL 2025: How will KKR, MI, CSK, SRH, RCB fare this season?

TimesofIndia.com in Chennai: Suryakumar Yadav was all relaxed, had a nice laugh when MS Dhoni was referred to as an ""uncapped player"" and looked upbeat for the upcoming season of the Indian Premier League (IPL). This edition carries an additional layer of significance for Surya who hasn't had the best of times with the bat since taking over T20I captaincy from Rohit Sharma after the World Cup last year. India operated without fear and have had a splendid run under new head coach Gautam Gambhir in the bilaterals which followed but the spunk has been missing from Surya's blade.Fifteen outings as a captain have yielded a meagre 258 runs and struggles continued in the domestic circuit for Mumbai too. The bat which once breathed fire has been ice cool for a very long time and the IPL presents an opportunity to get back amongst the runs. The right-hander enjoyed a lot of success at No. 3 but has himself pushed down the order to accommodate Tilak Varma who has been in red hot form. While the move paid rich dividends for the young left-hander, Surya's batting stock has been on a bear run since then.With the Mumbai Indians , he will be free from captaincy duties, except the first game where he is leading because of Hardik Pandya's slow-over rate suspension, and would look to rediscover the mojo in the next few weeks. When asked about the return to No.3 spot, Surya kept cards close to his chest and asserted he is flexible to bat anywhere in the batting order.""It's always good to have that impact at the top. And I have seen that guy (Tilak), he has been working really hard. So for Team India, I thought it would be better if he can bat at number 3 and I can take the responsibility at number 4. Because for me, I think batting number doesn't matter. I will try and bat the same way, try and make that impact whenever there is an opportunity. And so does he. So you might see guys being flexible during this season, during this stint with the IPL. And everyone is flexible. Even I can bat at 3... I can bat at 5, Tilak can bat at 5. So it's that flexibility we have in our team,"" said Surya at the pre-match presser in Chennai.The 34-year-old continues to work hard in the nets and is hoping luck remains on his side during the cash-rich league. Clear mindset has always been the key and the right-hander wants to find that ""sweet spot"" consistently this season.""With the form, I think the harder you work, the luckier you get. If it has to come, it will come anytime. But I am actually a process-oriented man. I love to work hard in the nets. And if the runs have to follow, it will follow quickly. I love to follow a good process, good routine when I am there during practice sessions. If I am practicing well, hitting the ball really well in the nets. When I go into the game, if my mind is clear, I know what I have to do. That is the moment, that is the sweet spot for me. When I know that I am in good space and I will get runs for the side,"" explained Surya.Mumbai Indians get their campaign underway on Sunday and the focus will remain on Surya, and his returns with the bat, as the Indian cricket team has a heavy T20I calendar before the T20 World Cup next year and the last thing the side would want is the skipper's extended lean patch with the bat.He will have his ""eyes wide open"" keeping track of his India teammates but the extra significance the season carries will certainly be a test of Mr 360's character.",Suryakumar Yadav has struggled with the bat since taking over T20I captaincy from Rohit Sharma after the World Cup last year.

IPL: How will GT, LSG, DC, PBKS, RR fare? Greenstone Lobo predicts

'BLESSED WITH STRONG GENETICS'

NEW DELHI: Expectations are high for captain Shubman Gill in IPL 2025 , following the Gujarat Titans ' impressive past performances. Making their IPL debut in 2022, Gujarat Titans, under Hardik Pandya's leadership, made history by winning the title in their very first season. They maintained their strong form in 2023, reaching the final again, but narrowly lost to Chennai Super Kings in a thrilling encounter.However, 2024 told a different story.With Pandya's move to Mumbai Indians, the captaincy was handed to Shubman Gill, but things didn't go as planned for Gujarat Titans. The team had a disappointing season, winning only 5 out of 14 matches and finishing eighth, failing to make it past the league stage.Will captain Shubman feel the pressure in IPL 2025?Gujarat Titans' all-rounder Glenn Phillips believes the pressure of representing your country is far greater than any IPL captaincy pressure.""It's a team game. One guy can't win it alone. I don't think it has anything to do with Shubman or his captaincy,"" Phillips told TimesofIndia.com during a media interaction arranged by Gujarat Titans."" T20 cricket is more about who's in form at the right time. Sunrisers and KKR were in top form for the tournament. The way they played in the first two years of the team's journey was fantastic — they were in great form, and it was awesome. Hopefully, we are in form this year too. But I don't think it has anything to do with Shubman or the pressure he's under. He plays for India, and you don't get much more pressure than that,"" Phillips said.Phillips delivered a masterclass in fielding during the ICC Champions Trophy 2025 , pulling off sensational catches — including those of Virat Kohli and Shubman Gill. His electrifying presence on the field left fans in awe, with many hailing him as the 'best fielder' of this generation.But it's not just Glenn — his brother, Dale Phillips , has also made headlines for his stunning catches. One of his standout moments came during the Super Smash, New Zealand's domestic T20 competition, where he took a breathtaking grab.With the Phillips brothers making waves with their exceptional fielding, is brilliance in the field simply in their DNA?""I think we've definitely been blessed with strong genetics from an agility perspective, which gives us an edge in fielding. Additionally, our willingness and enjoyment of fielding probably set us apart from the average player who might not have the same enthusiasm for it,"" Phillips said.""I think, in terms of catching, a lot of the hard work was probably done when I was younger and didn't have to worry as much about injuries. I did a lot of gymnastics and spent a lot of time on the trampoline with my brother — we were always flipping around. That definitely contributed to the agility side of things. But nowadays, most of the catches you get are pretty standard and straightforward. The real hard work comes from the sheer number of balls I've taken in my hands — trying to take around 50 catches in most training sessions if I can. I practice a variety of catches — straight at me, high balls, and different boundary catches as well. So, for me, it's more about repetition than anything else,"" he said.""I probably don't train as much for diving anymore, or at all, due to the risk of injury. But in a game, it's definitely about mindset—I just throw myself around as much as possible and see how close I can get to some of those tough catches. And, luckily, a few of them tend to stick pretty well,"" Phillips said.","Gujarat Titans' all-rounder Glenn Phillips believes the pressure of representing your country is far greater than any IPL captaincy pressure.

IPL: How will GT, LSG, DC, PBKS, RR fare? Greenstone Lobo predicts

Excerpts:

How excited are you to play for the Gujarat Titans after having played for two teams previously?

You have played in Delhi Capitals and Punjab Kings in the past. How do you see Gujarat Titans as a franchise and what are your first impressions?

With Shubman Gill leading the team, how do you see the team strategy shaping up for the season?

You must be looking forward to bowling in partnership with ‘DSP’ Mohammed Siraj?

You'll be leading the pace attack alongside Siraj, (Prasidh) Krishna and Ishant (Sharma). How do you see this partnership working?

The Narendra Modi stadium in Ahmedabad has a high-scoring pitch. Have you thought about how you will adapt to bowling to these conditions?

Are you happy with some of the bowler friendly moves that the IPL has introduced this time? The saliva ban has been revoked and there will be a new ball from the 11th over onwards.

As a bowler, how difficult is it to deal with the impact player rule? Considering that you suddenly have a specialist batsman or big hitter walking in at say number seven, number eight. Do you think it's a fair rule?

‘KG,’ are you excited about the World Test Championship final in June? Do you think South Africa can actually go on and beat the mighty Australia, the defending champions?

Kagiso, you've got a hat-trick in all three formats of the game. What makes you so successful across formats? You know, how do you maintain your fitness to play around there across formats and leagues around the world?

Does the Rs 10.75 crore that GT's paid for you put additional pressure on you to perform well for them this season?

How do you compare the IPL to the other leagues that you play in?

Have you tried any local food and cuisine so far in Gujarat?

Mumbai: One of the most exciting things about this IPL will be watching South Africa's pace ace Kagiso Rabada teaming up with 'DSP' Mohammed Siraj for the Gujarat Titans .Bought at a whopping Rs 10.75 crores, Rabada brings in a wealth of experience and raw pace to the GT bowling line-up, which now bears a more menacing look with superstar leggie Rashid Khan and India pacers Ishant Sharma and Prasidh Krishna also there.In an exclusive interview with TOI, ‘KG’ came across as somebody who is not daunted by challenges - “Make it hard for bowlers” he says about the Impact Player rule!Fired up to perform well for his new IPL side and bowling on the pace-friendly Ahmedabad pitch, the 29-year-old is also upbeat about South Africa’s chances against Australia in the final of the World Test Champions in June.I’m very excited to be playing in Ahmedabad and to be with Rashid Khan because I've been playing with him quite a bit over the last two, three years. So, it's nice to be with him again and then nice to be in a really well balanced team. Playing with some great batters and bowlers at the biggest stadium in India and then a pretty nice pitch to bowl on as a seamer! Getting to see Ishant again and then finally getting to meet players like Jos Buttler, Shubman Gill , (Rahul) Tewatia, Glenn Phillips , Sherfane (Rutherford), I've known as well. So, at least I don't have to bowl at these guys anymore!My first impressions are that it's a calm, well-organised (team). And with Ashish (Nehra, GT head coach) there, you know,…(he’s) never shy of a joke! I've heard a lot of good things about this franchise, having spoken to David Miller , who is my teammate, obviously. It just seems like everything just works well.The team strategy, I don't know if I should be exposing it, but it's pretty simple. We've already talked about it. I guess the main thing is freedom. There's a lot of freedom in this setup. It's awesome and I've enjoyed it.Yes, Siraj is an enigma, he's got an enigma as a bowler and I'm excited to be partnering up with him. It's going to be great.I guess we'll just sort of work it out and the more we play together, the more we'll get to know each other. The more we'll get to bounce ideas off each other, understand each other's strengths, weaknesses, etc. And we'll be able to communicate better. So far, so good. I've played with Ishant as well. So Ishant and I know each other pretty well. It's nice to play with him again.I have a general idea of what the pitch is going to be like. It's with the red soil, so obviously there's more extra bounce. The (pitch with the) black soil is a bit more slower. However, there's still bounce in it. That's what you want as a fast bowler and a bit of swing. It can tend to swing. You saw how well fast bowlers have done here in the past, particularly Mohammed Shami.Let's see if it'll impact (things). I mean, sometimes a harder ball is probably not the best tactic, but I think it just adds a spanner to the works. Let's see how it goes.It obviously makes things harder, but it's fine. Make it harder!Yes, 100%. Of course, we can, and I'm itching for that one. But for now, we look to win the IPL first.Just foresight, planning and a lot of hard work that people don't see!It's still quite some distance out, though. I wouldn't be thinking about that. Well, but I guess you would be thinking about that. Leading forward from here, you want to judge yourself on where you're at after this tournament. You'll sort of see where you're at and see where you'd like to actually improve and progress leading into the 2026 T20 World Cup.No, it doesn't. I don't think it should…that doesn't add any pressure, it just means that I've been backed. I am glad that the franchise has shown faith in me and I'm going to do my best for this team. That's all… I'm going to give my 100%. The team comes first.It's definitely the biggest league. The BCCI has done a tremendous amount of work to organize this league and make it big, and there's still a lot of progressions to come, whether it be looking after the players more, or enhancing the grounds. There's still loads of improvement that I'm sure the guys are thinking about putting into action and I must commend how it's been run and set up.Well, just pretty much standard food - mutton Rogan Josh, butter chicken, a bit of paneer dishes and nothing new!",Kagiso Rabada has joined the Gujarat Titans for a whopping Rs 10.75 crores.

Argentina moved closer to securing their spot in the 2026 World Cup after defeating Uruguay 1-0 in Montevideo on Friday, thanks to a brilliant goal from Thiago Almada.The match appeared to be heading towards a draw against Uruguay, who had previously defeated Argentina 2-0 in Buenos Aires during the qualifying rounds.The decisive moment came when Almada, the 23-year-old attacking midfielder, received the ball on the edge of the area and unleashed a powerful shot into the top corner, beyond Uruguay goalkeeper Sergio Rochet's reach.Argentina's otherwise strong performance was slightly marred in stoppage time when Nicolas Gonzalez received a red card for a dangerous high boot challenge on Uruguay's Nahitan Nandez.Argentina coach Lionel Scaloni expressed satisfaction with his team's performance, particularly in Messi's absence due to injury.""How can I not be satisfied? Not just for the result -- but for how they gave it their all. The satisfaction comes from the fact that the team played a complete match. When one player is missing, another comes in (...) we have enough to go out onto the field calmly, but the team is there.""Argentina can become the first South American team to qualify for the 2026 World Cup in the United States, Canada and Mexico if they defeat Brazil in Buenos Aires on Tuesday.Argentina currently leads the South American qualifying group with 28 points from 13 games, followed by Ecuador in second place with 22 points and Brazil in third with 21 points.Uruguay holds fourth position with 20 points from 13 matches, just ahead of Paraguay on goal difference.The victory guarantees Argentina at least a seventh-place finish, ensuring them a minimum of an inter-confederation playoff spot, with the top six teams qualifying directly for the World Cup.In another South American qualifier, Ecuador strengthened their qualification chances by defeating Venezuela 2-1, with veteran striker Enner Valencia scoring both goals.Ecuador is pursuing their fifth World Cup appearance in the nation's history.Ecuador's coach Sebastian Beccacece commented on the team's performance while emphasizing the importance of staying focused.""When things are going well, like today when we've won three games in a row, we have to be cautious, calm, humble, and have a lot of discipline to continue growing in what's coming up.""","Argentina defeated Uruguay 1-0 in Montevideo on Friday. Thiago Almada scored the only goal of the game. Argentina can qualify for the 2026 World Cup in the United States, Canada and Mexico.

As per our records, there is no violation.”The AIFF swung into action after being informed by FIFA that the dispute between NorthEast and Blasters was of a “national dimension, the eligibility of a player in a competition falling under the auspices of AIFF.”","Kerala Blasters cannot be punished for fielding Dusan Lagator, who had a pending suspension at the time of his transfer from Hungarian club Debreceni VSC to India.

PANAJI: Hamza Choudhury ’s arrival in Bangladesh earlier this week, sparked a never-before frenzy for a footballer in south Asia. The midfielder’s car was mobbed by supporters, everyone wanted a piece of him, a touch, a selfie, good enough even if he caught the eye. And there was so much Hamza had to do, including, among other things, a meeting with the adviser for Youth and Sports to the Interim Government.All this, before the team left for India for the opening group clash of the Asian Cup 2027 final round qualifiers on Thursday.Hamza, 27, you could say, is no ordinary footballer. No Lionel Messi, but with 57 Premier League appearances for Leicester City until Januay this year, he’s the highest profile footballer to represent a south Asian country in internationals.Until his loan move to Championship side Sheffield United in January, the Foxes academy graduate was the only British Asian playing in the Premier League in over two decades. Zesh Rehman, of Pakistani origin, was the first British Asian to start a Premier League match, turning out for Fulham in 2003.The Birmingham-born Rehman chose to represent hosts Pakistan at the 2005 SAFF Championship — a tournament where incidentally, a 20-year-old striker called Sunil Chhetri made his international debut for India.Rehman went on to make 22 appearances for the Pakistan national team, even captaining the side. On Thursday it was a similar feeling towards the east of the region.“It feels like our Messi is here,” Bangladesh captain Jamal Bhuyan told reporters during the team’s official media briefing prior to Thursday’s departure. “The excitement is five times greater than when I first arrived. Hamza is a Premier League player, it’s a huge boost for us,” added Bhuyan.Bhuyan’s own story is equally fascinating. After showing promise as a junior in Denmark, he was on the verge of breaking into the senior team when he was caught in the crossfire of gang-related gunfire in the Danish capital, a bullet hitting his head and putting him into coma.His career slowed down, and in 2013, he eventually returned to Bangladesh. Five years later, he rose to become captain. Hamza is even more special. Born to a Grenadian father and a Bangladeshi mother, Hamza made seven appearances for England Under-21s and chose to represent Bangladesh in senior international football , thanks to his ancestry. The defensive midfielder is expected to make his international debut against India in Shillong on Tuesday.India go into the fixture on the back of a 3-0 friendly win against the Maldives on Wednesday. There were two goals from set-pieces; Rahul Bheke scored in his second successive game, Liston Colaco scored his first in India colours, but more importantly, Sunil Chhetri, coaxed out of retirement at 40 by coach Manolo Marquez, showed just why he can still be counted to deliver.For Bangladesh, who would have been watching closely, it’s Hamza who they are counting upon.“You can’t compare Sunil Chhetri to Hamza. Sunil has done great things for India, but let’s be honest, Hamza is a Premier League player,” said Bhuyan, the poster boy of Bangladesh football, until Hamza’s arrival.At 185th, Bangladesh is the lowest-ranked team in the Asian Cup 2027 qualifiers group, which also has Hong Kong and Singapore. But Hamza’s inclusion has raised hopes of qualification to the continental showpiece for the first time.“One player cannot fully change one team, but it’s true that Hamza’s inclusion has raised expectations around the national team,” former Bangladesh national team coach Oscar Bruzon told TOI.Now with East Bengal, Bruzon spoke of the edge Hamza’s presence adds.“When you have a player from the Premier League, the standards rise and the players around you are motivated to do their best. The advantage for Bangladesh is more psychological,” he said.Bruzon is no stranger to football in Bangladesh. In the five years that he spent there, he won the Bangladesh Premier League four times with Basundhara Kings and, in addition to his club duties, took charge of the national team.“Bangladesh has strong players (physically), but they are missing a little bit of creativity in the middle. Hamza can play centre-back or defensive midfield, but I think they will try and bring him forward (more). There will be changes in some patterns of play. He is definitely of a different level, so everyone will have to adapt and adjust on the pitch.“Hamza will be very motivated,” pointed out Bruzon. “The craze is un - believable. I don’t think adaptation will be difficult because Bangladesh already has some technically good players. Tariq Kazi (Finland), for example, is young and talented defender. They are looking for others too playing in higher leagues.”","Hamza Choudhury is the highest profile footballer to represent a south Asian country in internationals.

SHILLONG: Despite the first win in 2025, and one after 489 days, all is not well in the Indian camp.Late on Wednesday, Manolo Marquez was a worried man even after securing his first win after becoming India coach in July. Unable to pick the injured Lallianzuala Chhangte and Asish Rai for this FIFA window, Marquez will now miss winger Manvir Singh and midfielder Brandon Fernandes for the crucial AFC Asian Cup qualifier against Bangladesh here on Tuesday.While Manvir — in fine form for 2024-25 ISL Shield Winners Mohun Bagan Super Giant — was released from the squad ahead of the Maldives friendly that India won 3-0, Marquez said Brandon, too, is certain to miss the Bangladesh tie.“Brandon won’t be available, for sure. It’s really bad luck that we lost three players — in the last game of the ISL, Manvir on Tuesday during the break session and today Brandon,” he said after the game on Wednesday.One of the more influential players against Maldives till he was stretchered off from the ground in the 39th minute, Brandon also delivered the corner for Rahul Bheke’s opening goal on Wednesday.The Mumbai City attacking midfielder went down to the ground in great pain at the half-hour mark, before being able to carry on for only another 10 minutes. Marquez did not want to take any risk, and had Brandon substituted with Chennaiyin FC striker-winger Farukh Choudhary.The player was later seen with a heavily strapped knee.Brandon’s unavailability forces the coach now on finding an able replacement ahead of Tuesday’s competitive clash.“We will call someone. We will recover Brison, who was in the stands, but let’s see which player,” he said.Brison Fernandes, who had a fine season at FC Goa under Marquez himself, missed the Maldives tie with a minor injury. Marquez did not want to risk aggravating the niggle, but with Brandon out, he could step in after regaining match fitness in in the interim week.A contender for the ISL Emerging Player Award, the 23-year-old midfielder has seven goals and two assists in 22 appearances this season. With passing accuracy and a fine possession game, Brison has the ingredients to graduate into an asset under Marquez.Aiming for their third consecutive appearance in the Asian meet, India are clubbed with Hong Kong China, Singapore and Bangladesh in Group C of the qualifiers.

- 'Not to mock him' -

COPENHAGEN: Rasmus Hojlund earned Denmark a deserved 1-0 lead over Portugal in their Nations League quarter-final first leg clash on Thursday. The Manchester United forward delivered from the bench to split the teams in Copenhagen, providing the finishing touch Denmark previously lacked on a night where they dominated Roberto Martinez's side.The Spanish coach selected veteran Cristiano Ronaldo , 40, up front but the Al-Nassr striker was mostly frozen out of the game.Winners of the inaugural tournament in 2019, Portugal are aiming to become the first team to lift the Nations League trophy for a second time.However they will need to improve swiftly to reach the semi-finals as Denmark outclassed them and could have scored more on the night, with Christian Eriksen missing a penalty.""It was our worst performance in the last two years,"" Portugal coach Martinez admitted, speaking to RTP.""After a five-month break, we clearly didn't come out with the intensity we needed. Denmark's pressure was very effective.""We lacked a lot. We lacked intensity... the level of our performance is not at the level we expected.""Looking for their first win under coach Brian Riemer, who was appointed in October, the Danes were without injured captain Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg.Denmark piled on the pressure from the start, with debutant Mika Biereth charging down Diogo Costa's clearance, but the goalkeeper managed to escape with conceding only a corner.Jesper Lindstrom forced Costa into action again with an effort from distance, while Pedro Neto tested Kasper Schmeichel at the other end.The hosts won a penalty when Portugal defender Renato Veiga handled the ball but Costa produced a superb save to deny Eriksen.The Porto goalkeeper, an expert in saving spot kicks, dived low to his right to thwart the Manchester United midfielder.Costa made another stunning save from Biereth to keep his team level, as Denmark turned the screw.When the hosts finally beat Costa, Diogo Dalot was in the right place at the right time to clear Eriksen's effort off the line just before the break, after good work by Gustav Isaksen.Riemer's side stayed on top in the second half, with Costa saving an Eriksen free-kick, although Vitinha came close for Portugal, who showed occasional flashes of their quality on an otherwise lethargic display.Isaksen, a constant menace, had a shot deflected behind as Denmark started to fear their dominance would not translate into a lead. However Hojlund, on as a substitute, had other ideas.The striker, who ended a long Manchester United drought last weekend by scoring in his team's win at Leicester City, broke the deadlock by slotting home to cap a fine move.Eriksen spread the ball to another substitute, Andreas Skov Olsen, who picked out Hojlund with a low ball to finish coolly in the 78th minute.The forward imitated Ronaldo's jumping ""Siuuu"" celebration but said it was a tribute to the former Man United and Real Madrid superstar.""I'm playing against the world's best footballer, my idol, and to score and become the (match) winner, it couldn't be better,"" Hojlund told Denmark's TV2.""It was not to mock him or anything, I've always said he has had great importance for me and my football career.""Portugal's Bernardo Silva, making his 99th appearance for his country, had a penalty appeal late on waved away after falling under pressure from Patrick Dorgu in the box, and Schmeichel saved from Neto in the final stages.Portugal host Denmark in the second leg in Lisbon on Sunday.""Pressure is part of football, now it increases because we're one goal down, but we have time to correct that,"" Costa told RTP.""Everything is still up for grabs and we have to focus on that to give a reaction (to this defeat).""",Denmark beat Portugal 1-0 in their Nations League quarter-final first leg clash.

SHILLONG: Sunil Chhetri justified being coaxed out of his international retirement by a beleaguered India coach Manolo Marquez with a performance on his return to the national fold, which seemed like he had never left at all. That, and a fine glancing header for his 95th career goal helped give India its first international win in over a year — after 489 days — a 3-0 scoreline against Maldives here on Wednesday.Chhetri who started the game and stayed in the thick of things till he was substituted in the 82nd minute, helped himself to a goal in the 76th. Before that, Rahul Bheke (34) and Liston Colaco (66) had done enough to put the issue beyond Maldives’s reach.Marquez got his first win as India head coach and India got their first victory after over a year. They were winless in their last five international games with two of those being losses.For the first half hour, however, both sides looked to be playing a friendly game without fire as the play lacked any quality moves at both ends of the pitch. Once Bheke scored the opener with a header from Brandon Fernandes corner from left, the complexion of the match changed for the better for the home side.Despite the pre-game craze, the official attendance for India’s first ever international game in Shillong was a modest 6,798. On the lukewarm response, the Meghalaya Football Association (MFA) said it being a weekday as well as a friendly could be they reason for low turnout.They were optimistic it would be a full house when Bangladesh come calling Tuesday. Still, there was enough support for Chhetri, the crowd screaming his name, and he didn’t disappoint.The first half ended with India keeping their nose ahead with the sole lead. Five minutes after the change of ends, India found themselves with a brilliant chance to double their lead, only to be denied off the goalline by the Maldives defence.In the 66th minute, Maldives goalkeeper Hussain Shareef forced an excellent save with his leg, but the resultant corner produced the goal India were looking for. This time Naorem Mahesh Singh curled his corner from left towards the second post where an unmarked Colaco rose to the occasion to double the advantage and broke into a Cristiano Ronaldo-like celebration near the corner flag.But the stand erupted in joy only when Chhetri brought in his 95th strike towards the end on his international return as he flicked a header following Colaco’s assist.Maldives barely entered the Indian territory throughout the match.",India beat Maldives 3-0 in their first international game in over a year.

NEW DELHI: Sunil Chhetri made a remarkable comeback to the national team after retiring from international football in May last year. In a friendly match against Maldives on Wednesday, Chhetri's presence proved to be the catalyst for India's commanding 3-0 victory, helping the team snap their 12-match winless streak that had persisted since November 2023.The match unfolded with Rahul Bheke giving India the lead in the 35th minute, followed by Liston Colaco extending the advantage to 2-0 in the 66th minute.The 40-year-old Chhetri, who had returned to the national team, etched his name in the scoresheet with a glancing header in the 77th minute, marking his 95th international goal .Chhetri's impact was evident as he narrowly missed a scoring opportunity in the 47th minute, denied by the Maldives goalkeeper. He was eventually substituted in the 82nd minute, having made a memorable contribution to the team's victory.This triumph held significance as it marked India's first win in 16 months and the first under the guidance of Manolo Marquez , who was appointed as the head coach in July last year. India's previous victory came against Kuwait (1-0) in their 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifying round match in Kuwait City on November 16, 2023.The friendly match served as a dress rehearsal for India's crucial AFC Asian Cup qualifier against Bangladesh, scheduled for March 25 at the same venue. Chhetri's return to the national team was specifically aimed at aiding the team's successful navigation through the qualifiers.With Maldives ranked 162nd in the world, 36 places below India (126th), the match provided an opportunity for the Indian team to regain their winning momentum and prepare for the upcoming challenges in the AFC Asian Cup qualifiers .",India beat Maldives 3-0 in a friendly match on Wednesday.

In Indian Wells it was very different, so I hope I can continue playing this way and have a great week here.""The 27-year-old German completed his match against Fearnley in 74 minutes and utilized his early Indian Wells exit for additional practice.""Had two weeks time to practice and work on my game again and I did that - hopefully this is the first of many matches for me here.""In an unexpected turn, 13th-seeded American Ben Shelton was eliminated by Hong Kong wildcard Coleman Wong, ranked 128th globally.Wong secured a 7-6 (7/3), 2-6, 7-6 (7/5) victory, despite losing a 5-2 lead in the final set.""I always trust myself to play in these big stages… I had a tough time (during) the COVID times. I didn't play for a year and a half and I'm really lucky my team keeps supporting me. I'm really happy and this is for you Hong Kong.""Brazilian teenager Joao Fonseca continued his impressive run, defeating 19th seed Ugo Humbert 6-4, 6-3 to reach his first Masters 1000 third round.In women's competition, top-seeded Aryna Sabalenka advanced to the fourth round after Elena-Gabriela Ruse retired due to a right thigh injury, with Sabalenka leading 6-1.Coco Gauff, seeded third, defeated Maria Sakkari 6-2, 6-4, who has fallen from the top 10 to 51st in rankings.Naomi Osaka overcame American wildcard Hailey Baptiste in a challenging match, winning 7-6 (8/6), 3-6, 6-4.""Today was an emotional day for me. I'm a little embarrassed for how much I threw my racquet, which is something that I don't like to be known for.""The tournament saw another retirement as Ons Jabeur withdrew due to a left leg injury, allowing sixth-seeded Jasmine Paolini to advance while leading 4-3 in the first set.","British tennis star Jack Draper suffers defeat at Miami Open.

BENGALURU: Vedant Mohan -- India’s most promising sub-junior tennis player (under-14) – has kickstarted the next step of his junior career, transitioning to the International Tennis Federation’s junior Tour (under-18).The 14-year-old, who had been locked down at his training base in Javea, a coastal town in Spain since February, started by playing a couple of base-level ITFs in Sri Lanka these last weeks. He's scheduled for more J30s and J60s in May, most likely in Africa.Vedant, left-handed, also plays on the Spanish circuit and has gained immensely in the last few years competing in Tennis Europe events alongside some of the best under-14 talents in the world. Vedant’s highest ranking in the under-14 section of the Tennis Europe ratings was achieved on his 14th birthday this January, when he still had another 12 months left in the age-group.He was ranked No.13 and at the time, the only Asian in the top 25.While playing in Europe helped grow Vedant’s game, the 5-feet-8-inch Indian couldn’t play the full circuit. He didn’t qualify for the European Championships, the Summer or Winter Cups, all big-ticket competitions, and open only to Europeans as they are team events.That, along with the fact that he was cash-strapped, contributed to Vedant’s rather limited matchplay in comparison to his peers (2011-born) who were ranked higher than him.For instance, the TE No.1 (U-14) Mario Vukovic of France has played 176 singles matches and the No.2 Greece’s Rafael Pagonis played 192 while Vedant has played just 102.The 14-year-old will now play a mix of U-16 and U-18 tournaments in Spain, while targeting ITF under-18s. Vedant’s parents – father Dhruv and mother Anisha – moved to Spain five years ago when their son, then nine, received a tennis scholarship.Mohan, a commercial pilot, has for most part funded Vedant’s mushrooming career, while also leaning on Anisha’s and his family back home in India. He lives in Muscat, while Anisha and their two sons live in Javea, where Vedant trains under Javier Ferrer, brother of former top-5 pro David.Vedant, who idolises tennis legend Novak Djokovic because of his mentality, says his favourite surface is clay.“I love that I can rip the ball hard and heavy with topspin on clay. Also, I love to slide,” he told TOI. “My favourite shot is my inside-out forehand. I like to play aggressively, my game is all court. I like to volley and also play with variation.”Mohan, a collegiate-level tennis player in India, winning gold medals in singles and doubles, is hoping his son will be part of junior Grand Slam draws in the next 18-to-24 months.“The ultimate goal is the pros, the ATP Tour,” he said, adding, “At this stage we’re only looking to develop his game.”","Vedant Mohan is India’s most promising sub-junior tennis player (under-14) The 14-year-old will now play a mix of U-16 and U-18 tournaments in Spain.

Miami: Carlos Alcaraz , ranked world number three, experienced an unexpected early elimination from the Miami Open on Friday. Belgian veteran David Goffin secured a remarkable comeback victory with a score of 5-7, 6-4, 6-3 at Hard Rock Stadium .Goffin, aged 34 and currently ranked 55th, had previously defeated Alcaraz in Astana three years ago. Noticing Alcaraz's subpar performance in the opening set, Goffin adopted an aggressive approach.Goffin, who once achieved a career-high ranking of No.7 in 2017, delivered impressive winning shots while Alcaraz struggled with unforced errors. The Belgian player managed to secure a break advantage in all three sets, and despite losing his lead in the first set, he maintained composure to secure the victory.""When I came out earlier... just to warm up on the court, I felt 'I'm moving well. I'm feeling quite relaxed. I'm hitting the ball really well' and so I hoped it would be the same during the match.""""I started the match well. I had the break in the first and he started to play really well at the end of the first.""""It's that kind of night that I will remember for sure -- against Carlos and in a stadium like that. And the night that gave me a lot of confidence to continue.""Daniil Medvedev also faced an early exit following a 6-2, 6-3 loss to Spain's Jaume Munar, ranked 56th. Meanwhile, Novak Djokovic secured a straight-sets victory over Australian Rinky Hijikata.Medvedev, who won the Miami title in 2023, displayed frustration by throwing his racket multiple times. Munar, the 27-year-old from Mallorca, achieved his third career victory over a top 10 opponent.The Russian player committed 32 unforced errors and failed to convert two break points in the final game despite having an opportunity to mount a comeback.""Yeah, I was not 100% physically, but I tried my best to get into the match. Every day was better and better. I had some problems after Indian Wells. Can happen.""""He played well, so that's why (he won) I wouldn't go to the match if I would kind of definitely know I'm not ready to win.""Djokovic, who previously lost to a lucky loser at Indian Wells, defeated 86th-ranked Hijikata 6-0, 7-6 (7/1), ending his three-match losing streak. He has now matched Rafael Nadal's record of 410 match wins in Masters 1000 tournaments since their inception in 1990.Karen Khachanov halted Nick Kyrgios's comeback with a 7-6 (7/3), 6-0 victory. Kyrgios, returning from wrist surgery, had secured his first tour-level win since October 2022 against Mackenzie McDonald but couldn't overcome Khachanov, a semi-finalist in Miami last year.In the women's competition, world number two Iga Swiatek advanced to the third round by defeating France's Caroline Garcia 6-2, 7-5. The match proved more challenging than their recent encounter at Indian Wells.Swiatek faced a 3-1 deficit in the second set and saved a set point while serving at 5-4 down before winning the final three games.""My energy level got down really fast. So I tried to wake myself up, keep the intensity from the first set, follow through and go for it,"" Swiatek said.Emma Raducanu demonstrated determination in her victory over eighth-seeded American Emma Navarro. The British player won 7–6 (8/6), 2–6, 7–6 (7/4) in a match lasting two hours and 53 minutes.","Belgian veteran David Goffin defeats world number three Carlos Alcaraz.

Miami:

Australian Nick Kyrgios won his first match since 2022 as he fought back from a set down to beat American Mackenzie McDonald 3-6, 6-3, 6-4 at the Miami Open on Wednesday.Kyrgios's career has been blighted by injuries in the last two years and he had to retire from his first round match at Indian Wells earlier this month.The flamboyant 29-year-old had suffered pain in his surgically reconstructed right wrist - a procedure that left him on the sidelines for 18 months.""It has been a long journey, even to just get to the start line of matches and be scared to just finish them,"" Kyrgios said.""To come off and get a win and feel like I belong again was special,"" added after the one-hour, 43-minute victory.Kyrgios, the 2022 Wimbledon finalist, has been plagued by injuries in his career but it was the wrist which caused him the most serious issues and he said he was deeply pessimistic about his chances of a comeback.""I never thought I would play tennis again to be brutally honest with you. I was having conversations with my camp and my team, and I said 'I don't know how long I can keep doing this for',"" he said.""This (win) puts some petrol in the tank but I need to be realistic and see how my wrist feels tomorrow because it is a grind out here,"" he added.There was a first round win for 38-year-old Frenchman Gael Monfils who became the second oldest man, after Jimmy Connors, to win at the Miami Open.Monfils beat last year's quarter-finalist, Hungary's Fabian Marozsan, 6-3, 3-6, 6-4.In the women's draw, Emma Raducanu claimed her first win, defeating 19-year-old wild card Sayaka Ishii of Japan 6-2, 6-1 in just 65 minutes.The 2021 US Open champion will face eighth-seeded American Emma Navarro in the second round, her first meeting with a top 10 player since losing to Iga Swiatek in the Australian Open third round.""It's going to be an extremely challenging match,"" Raducanu said in her on-court interview.

I felt like I was in control. I knew what I needed to do. I just went for it and played to win.""In his first Masters 1000 final, Draper established control early, taking a 4-0 lead.

After saving a break point with a 137 mph ace in the opening game, he broke Draper's serve three times to level the match.""It was a strange match in all honesty. Carlos came out a little flat, I sensed that. I had a chance in the first game of the second, and he came up with an ace... What happened to him happened to me, I got tight, I had low energy. I got lost out there for 25 minutes, but in the third, I was really proud of my competitiveness, my attitude and I somehow managed to get over the line.""In the third set, Draper broke Alcaraz for a 2-1 lead following a lengthy video review.

Despite being broken while serving for the match at 5-2, Draper regained composure to win on his second attempt.Rune demonstrated strategic excellence against Medvedev, ending his seven-match losing streak in semifinals.""It was to really play my game, come forward, take the ball on the rise.

BENGALURU: The first two months of the 2025 tennis season has been all uphill for Sumit Nagal , starting in Melbourne in January and then on clay in Rosario and Buenos Aires, laid low by a flu.The 27-year-old will make a return to tournament play in the ATP Challenger in Murcia next week after staying away from the Tour for about a month.Nagal, whose ranking is down to 132, was thrown a curveball by what he suspects was a bout of Covid-19 in January. The Indian, who chose the rigour of the South American swing over the four-week ATP Challenger series in India in February, was caught unawares in Argentina.“If I knew I was (so) unwell I would never have gone to South America,” Nagal told TOI during a telephone interview. “You’re going so far away, not feeling your best, that makes no sense.”Nagal, who has spent the last few weeks at his training base in Germany, is gradually working his way back.“I never really felt good since Australia, it was maybe Covid-19 over there, I wasn’t sure,” the India No.1 said. “When I was in Argentina I was practicing a bit and then I wasn’t really practicing. It wasn’t a great few weeks for me. I was struggling so much with my health, I was fatigued, I was barely practicing. And when I practiced or played I would feel super tired.”“It has been good in the last two weeks. I have been practicing quite a bit, pushing a bit,” said Nagal, who marked his fitness at eight on a scale of 1 to 10.Nagal, who climbed to a career-high No.68 in the ranking last July, is now chasing a main draw berth at Roland Garros. He’s scheduled to play two ATP Challengers, followed by Monte Carlo Masters 1000, where he went through qualifiers last year to make the round of 32, after which the Indian will look at 250 Series tournaments.While there are nine Indians in the top-150 of the doubles rankings, Nagal is the only Indian in the top-250 of the singles rankings on the men’s and women’s tours.","Sumit Nagal will make a return to tournament play in the ATP Challenger in Murcia next week.

Sabalenka trounces Keys in Australian Open re-match

Russian teenager Mirra Andreeva ended the defending champion Iga Swiatek 's quest for a historic third Indian Wells title, defeating the world number two 7-6 (1), 1-6, 6-3 on Friday to advance to the final.At just 17, Andreeva snapped Swiatek's 10-match winning streak at Indian Wells, marking her second victory over the Polish star in three weeks—having previously triumphed in Dubai's quarter-finals en route to becoming the youngest WTA 1000 champion ever.On Sunday, Andreeva will face Aryna Sabalenka , who dominated Australian Open champion Madison Keys . The American veteran Keys had denied Sabalenka a third consecutive title in Melbourne, where she claimed her first major in January.Andreeva is the youngest finalist at Indian Wells since Kim Clijsters, who was 17 in 2001.In the match against Swiatek, Andreeva showcased her skills in the first set tiebreaker and managed to regroup after a challenging second set.Although Swiatek started confidently, dropping only one point in her first three service games, Andreeva seized a 5-4 lead with a crucial break, benefiting from a double fault by Swiatek. The match proceeded to a tiebreaker where Andreeva dominated.""I felt like I'm gonna go and play the tiebreak like it's the last tiebreak of my life,"" she said. ""So I just went for all my shots. My serve was great. I just felt super comfortable and confident,"" she said.""I saw my mom's nervous face in the big screen,"" Andreeva told the crowd. ""I tried not to look there.""Despite Swiatek rebounding in the second set with three breaks, the momentum shifted back to Andreeva in the third. She ultimately secured victory with her third break of the set.""I just decided to kind of still play the same but maybe go for my shots more, trying to play a little bit more aggressive,"" she said.""I feel also that I was dealing with the nerves and the pressure pretty good, so I just feel proud of myself.""World number one Aryna Sabalenka dispatched Madison Keys 6-0, 6-1 to reach the Indian Wells final, avenging her loss to the fifth-ranked American in the Australian Open final.In just 51 minutes, Sabalenka set up a title match against Andreeva.The Belarusian, seeking revenge after her January defeat to Keys, was sharp from the start, completing the first set in just 23 minutes.""I was hungry,"" said Sabalenka, who had made no bones about wanting revenge. ""That Australian Open match was really heartbroken for me, and I really needed some time to recover after that.""And if I would lose today again, it would get in my head and I didn't want that to happen. I was really focused -- I was just really hungry to get this win against Madison.""Keys, who had a 16-match winning streak culminating in her Australian Open victory, struggled to make an impact.""I think tactically I played really great tennis,"" said Sabalenka, adding her strategy was to ""just keep her out of the rhythm"".Despite overcoming the cold, swirling winds on Stadium Court and winning the first 11 games, Sabalenka's dominance was clear. Keys managed to hold serve for the first time at 5-1 in the second set, but Sabalenka quickly closed out the match.This marks Sabalenka's second appearance in the Indian Wells final; she was the runner-up to Elena Rybakina in 2023.","Russian teenager Mirra Andreeva beat defending champion Iga Swiatek 7-6 (1), 1-6, 6-3. At 17, she is the youngest finalist at Indian Wells since Kim Clijsters in 2001. She will face Aryna Sabalenka, who beat Australian Open champion Madison Keys.

Madison Keys powered into the Indian Wells semifinals on Thursday, dismantling wild-card Belinda Bencic 6-1, 6-1 in just 65 minutes to notch her 16th straight victory. The fifth-seeded American, who claimed the Australian Open title earlier this year, now sets up a highly anticipated rematch with world No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka . The two last met at Melbourne Park in January, where Keys defeated Sabalenka in a three-set battle, halting the Belarusian’s bid for a third straight title.Despite upsetting No. 4 seed Coco Gauff in the previous round, Bencic — a 28-year-old from Switzerland — had no answers for Keys’ relentless play.Elsewhere in the women’s draw, defending champion Iga Swiatek continued her dominant run in the California desert, advancing to her fourth straight semifinal at Indian Wells with a 6-3, 6-3 win over eighth-seeded Qinwen Zheng. Swiatek, the No. 2 seed and a five-time Grand Slam winner, is aiming to become the first woman to win the event three times. She’s riding a 10-match win streak at Indian Wells, having also lifted the trophy in 2022.Zheng, who had ended Swiatek’s 25-match winning streak at the Paris Olympics last year, couldn’t replicate that magic. Though she broke Swiatek twice and won six games — equaling the total games Swiatek had lost all tournament — the Polish star converted all five of her break points to seal the match.In the men’s draw, two-time defending champion Carlos Alcaraz fought off determined challenger Francisco Cerundolo 6-3, 7-6 (7/4) to reach the semi-finals.On another cold, blustery night in the California desert, Alcaraz battled back from 1-4 down in the second set, coming up with a break and two love service holds to force the tiebreaker as he kept his bid to join Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic as the only men to win three straight Indian Wells titles on track.Alcaraz had to save break points in each of his first three service games. But after an emphatic hold for 4-3 he gained the first break of the contest with a deft volley and just like that he was serving for the first set.After sliding to pop a drop volley winner over the net for set point Alcaraz drilled a deep forehand that Cerundolo could barely get a racquet on.But it was Cerundolo who broke first in the second, finally converting his ninth break point of the match then holding for 4-1.But he couldn't hold off the world number three, who raced to a 5-2 lead in the tiebreaker on the way to victory.""It was really difficult for me to start the match,"" said Alcaraz, who looked less comfortable in the windy weather than he did just a day before.""He got a lot of chances in the first set,"" Alcaraz said. ""I'm just pleased about saving all of them and taking the only one that I had.""I didn't hit the ball as clear as yesterday, but I just did what I had to and that's what it's about.""Alcaraz next faces Britain's Jack Draper, who reached his first Masters 1000 semi-final with a 6-4, 7-5 victory over American Ben Shelton.Draper took the opening set with one break of serve then rallied from 0-3 down in a second-set slug-fest.Shelton's 32 unforced errors included five double-faults -- including one to hand Draper a break for 6-5 in the second.Russian Daniil Medvedev , runner-up to Alcaraz each of the past two years, rallied from a break down in a wild, wind-blown final set to beat Arthur Fils 6-4, 2-6, 7-6 (9/7).The world number six booked a semi-final meeting with Denmark's Holger Rune , a 5-7, 6-0, 6-3 winner over Tallon Griekspoor.Medvedev, a six-time Grand Slam finalist, trailed 20-year-old Fils 2-4 in the third set of a compelling clash that was momentarily paused as gusting winds sent towels and trash cans flying on Stadium Court.France's Fils had shown admirable maturity in the face of Medvedev's formidable defensive skills.He cut down on the unforced errors that marred his first set to win the second with ease and maintained his poise as he erased an early break in the third to seize the lead.But Medvedev wouldn't be denied and after forcing the tiebreaker prevailed on his third match point when Fils pushed a backhand volley long.Medvedev, who had won just one of his past nine third-set tiebreakers, gave a leap of sheer joy after securing the win in 2 hours and 25 minutes to keep alive his bid for a first title since 2023 -- when he won five.""I lost a lot of tight matches this year where I could have won, should have won maybe,"" Medvedev said. ""I have lost a lot of tight matches where it goes a little bit 50-50 and the more it goes like that, the more you can lose confidence in the tight moments.""I was happy I was able to get over the line as he saved some match points and had a break lead in the third. I am just happy to win.""Medvedev faces another young gun in Rune, who burst onto the scene in 2022 with a win over Novak Djokovic in the Paris Masters final.Rune has struggled often since, but after dropping the first set he dominated Griekspoor, the 43rd-ranked Dutchman who had ousted top-seeded Alexander Zverev in the second round.","Madison Keys crushes wild-card Belinda Bencic 6-1,6-1 in just 65 minutes to notch her 16th straight victory.

CHENNAI: Sankar Muthusamy recorded the biggest win of his nascent career yet, defeating World No. 2 Anders Antonsen of Denmark 18-21, 21-12, 21-5 in the Swiss Open men’s singles pre-quarterfinals in Basel late on Thursday.What surprised many was the way in which the Indian dominated the deciding game. Despite losing the opener, the 21-year-old did not give up and pushed the match to the decider. He was helped by a flurry of unforced errors that Antonsen committed — the Dane hitting the shuttle wide and long on multiple occasions. Sankar made the most of the opportunity and succeeded.The Chennai lad entered the tournament as a qualifier and registered two wins to enter the main draw.“It feels good, and I have been doing well in this tournament. The first game (against Antonsen) lasted for close to 30 minutes and I feel that he became tired after that. I was able to score points from long rallies and capitalised on the situation. I was focusing on one point at a time and did not think much about the result,” Sankar, ranked 64th, told TOI from Basel.“In the deciding game, I was just expecting him to come back at me and was ready to handle the situation. My aim was to move him around the court and make him tired.”Sankar, who was a former junior World No. 1, lacked consistency in the 2024 season due to various reasons. However, he started the 2025 season on a bright note, reaching the quarterfinals of the Thailand Masters. He was later down with fever and could not give his best in the next few tournaments. However, Sankar recovered well ahead of the Swiss Open.The youngster, who is known for his defensive play, has improved his attacking skills and stroke-making.“My strokes have become sharper than usual, and I am able to finish off points from the rear court. My power is gradually increasing, and I am working on it. There is still a long way to go,” he said.Sankar’s long-time coach Aravindan Samiappan said that the win has come at the right time for his ward.“The moment has not sunk in properly. Sankar was an underdog and had nothing to lose. Our plan was to stay neck-to-neck on points and towards the end anything could have happened. But none would have expected such a scoreline in the decider. It was a bit shocking but that happens sometimes,” Aravindan said.The coach feels that opponents can no longer come prepared for Sankar, as he lends unpredictability into his game now.“Sankar can vary the pace of the match whenever required, and this was not the case one and a half years ago. Players could anticipate what he was going to do, as he played at a single pace. Now, you cannot predict him, and that is the major difference in his gameplay,” pointed out the coach.","Sankar Muthusamy defeated World No. 2 Anders Antonsen of Denmark 18-21, 21-12,. 21-5 in the Swiss Open men’s singles pre-quarterfinals in Basel late on Thursday.

A day after dethroning reigning champion Jonatan Christie , Lakshya Sen faltered against Li Shi Feng of China 10-21, 16-21 in the men’s singles quarterfinals of the All England Championships in Birmingham on Friday.Soon after, the Indian challenge ended as the women’s doubles pair of Treesa Jolly and Gayatri Gopichand lost to Chinese second seeds Liu Sheng Shu and Tan Ning 14-21, 10-21.Given his 7-4 win-loss record and having won the last two matches against Li last year, Lakshya was expected to fare well in the quarterfinals. But the Indian was a pale shadow of the shuttler on show against Christie.From 4-4, Li widened the gap. He scored eight points on the trot and Lakshya was out of the first game even before he had warmed up.Emboldened by the easy victory in the first game, Li started on an aggressive note while Lakshya crawled his way back. With good netplay and by pushing the shuttle to the corners with good effect, Lakshya secured a crucial three-point lead (11-8) at the halfway stage. However, Li toned down his aggression and scored the next four points by engaging the Indian in long rallies, mostly close to the net. It was anybody’s game till 15-15.Thereafter, Li came up with two smash winners and a lucky net drop to widen the gap to 19-15.

NEW DELHI: India's Lakshya Sen exited the All England Badminton Championships following a straight-game defeat to Chinese world No. 6 Li Shi Feng in the men's singles quarterfinals on Friday. The 2022 finalist, who narrowly missed an Olympic medal in Paris last year, was outplayed 10-21, 16-21 in a 45-minute encounter.Ranked world No. 15, Sen had won his last two encounters against Li, including at the Thomas Cup. However, this time, he struggled against his familiar Chinese rival from the junior class of 2018.Feng dominated early, wrapping up the first game in just 17 minutes. Playing with composure and avoiding unnecessary risks, he surged to a 9-4 lead with a powerful smash and entered the break with an 11-4 advantage. Sen's unsuccessful review left him trailing 4-12, but a brief resurgence saw him reduce the deficit to 7-12 with a sharp cross-court smash. Yet, Feng quickly adjusted, mixing up his pace and tactics to clinch the game.Sen showed improvement in the second game but couldn't match Feng's consistency. Trailing 2-5 initially, Sen fought back with better net play, taking a 10-8 lead after a grueling 37-shot rally. He maintained a slender three-point lead at the break and fought hard in a tight contest, with a marathon 44-shot exchange tying the score at 14-all. However, Feng's aggression proved decisive as he surged ahead 17-15 with a powerful smash.At 15-18, Sen suffered finger bruises, spilling blood on the court and requiring medical attention, leading to a brief stoppage. However, the break did little to disrupt Feng's momentum as he sealed the match with another thunderous smash.Despite the loss, Sen's campaign was commendable, highlighted by his stunning straight-game victory over defending champion Jonatan Christie, avenging his semifinal defeat to the Indonesian last year.With this win, Feng advances to the semifinals to face the winner between top seed Shi Yu Qi and Singapore's Loh Kean Yew.Meanwhile, India's doubles duo Satwiksairaj Rankireddy and Chirag Shetty withdrew due to injury, Malvika Bansod bowed out in women's singles, and the mixed doubles pair of Rohan Kapoor and Ruthvika Shivani Gadde also fell short.","Lakshya Sen loses 10-21, 16-21 to Chinese world No. 6 Li Shi Feng.

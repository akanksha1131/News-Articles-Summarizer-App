NEW DELHI: Indian pace maestro Jasprit Bumrah has etched his name in cricketing history by being crowned the ICC Men’s Test Cricketer of the Year for 2024.This accolade comes after a record-breaking year where Bumrah delivered a career-best performance, cementing his place as one of the greatest Test bowlers of modern times.Returning to Test cricket in late 2023 after a lengthy hiatus due to a back injury, Bumrah wasted no time regaining his form.Throughout 2024, he spearheaded India’s bowling attack in both home and overseas conditions. Whether it was dismantling South Africa in Cape Town or tormenting Australia during the Border-Gavaskar Trophy , Bumrah’s versatility and precision shone through.Bumrah claimed a staggering 71 wickets in just 13 matches, making him the leading wicket-taker in Test cricket for the year.He maintained an otherworldly average of 14.92 and a strike rate of 30.1, figures that defy logic in today’s run-heavy era.READ ALSO: Smriti Mandhana crowned ICC Women's ODI Cricketer of the Year Notably, his efforts included achieving milestones such as crossing the 200-wicket mark, becoming the 12th Indian bowler to reach this landmark with an unmatched average of 19.4—the lowest for any bowler in Test history with a minimum of 200 dismissals.Bumrah’s heroics were crucial in India’s series victories against England and Bangladesh at home and their remarkable performances overseas in South Africa and Australia.His standout display came during the high-pressure Border-Gavaskar Trophy, where he claimed 32 wickets in five matches and was named Player of the Series.A special effort from the stand-in skipper came in the Perth Test when Bumrah, leading an injury-hit Indian side, produced an iconic 5/30 in the first innings, paving the way for a resounding 295-run victory.",Jasprit Bumrah has been crowned ICC Men's Test Cricketer of the Year for 2024.

Stuart Broad on India's challenge in the Champions Trophy

Cricket fans in South Africa have been flocking to the stadiums on regular basis and being thoroughly entertained with some incredible cricket. At the forefront of it is the spin-bowling approach employed by many teams but none have used it as effectively as the Paarl Royals .In their last home game against Pretoria Capitals at Boland Park, the Royals employed a unique strategy of using a five-man all-spin attack, making it the first time a team has bowled 20 overs of spin in a SA20 match This tactic has proven to be highly successful, with the Royals securing three consecutive victories this past week (five in a row overall), placing them at the top of the SA20 points table and securing their spot in the playoffs. Bjorn Fortuin , the Royals' left-arm spinner who has become their leading wicket-taker, attributes the team's success to the diversity within their spin bowling arsenal.“We're quite diverse as a spin group. We've got myself and (Dunith) Wellalage that both bowl left-arm spin, but different left-arm spin if that makes sense,” said Fortuin.As Bjorn Fortuin, Dunith Wellalage, Mujeeb Ur Rahman , Joe Root and Nqaba Peter shared the bowling responsibilities between them, the batters struggled. Bar Will Jacks (56) and Kyle Verreynne (30), no one reached double digits that day.“Mujeeb (Ur-Rahman) bowls liquorice allsorts, you never know what's going on there. (Joe) Root is just trying to keep things quiet. You've got Nqaba (Peter) that joined us, so we complement each other well, but I think we adapt well as well. Root could do my job in the powerplay, for instance.“Mujeeb could bowl at the death like Root did. So it was quite interchangeable. Anyone could have bowled at any point and fortunately it worked out well for us.”The Royals also boast the league's top run-scorers, with opening duo Joe Root (279 runs at an average of 69.75) and Lhuan-dre Pretorius (258 runs at 36.85) leading the way, while mystery spinner Mujeeb Ur Rahman is the joint top wicket-taker with 12 scalps at 15.83.Meanwhile, the Royals' neighbours, MI Cape Town , have also been on an unbeaten streak, making history by securing back-to-back victories - with an abandoned match in between - for the first time in the competition's three-year history, placing them second with 21 points.""There's a different vibe in the camp. (Captain) Rashid (Khan) knows the players well, and you can see the hunger to succeed, especially after the tough past seasons. We owe it to ourselves and the fans,"" said MI Cape Town all-rounder George Linde.Paarl Royals are the only team to have booked their place in the playoffs so far. With six wins in seven, they've collected 24 points, and have looked stellar so far.Right behind are MI Cape Town with four wins in seven and after two consecutive years of bottom place, they are primed to qualify for the next stage in the competition. But will it be in second, third or fourth remains to be seen.A competitive battle is playing out in the middle of the table with defending champions Sunrisers Eastern Cape (19 points) having won three consecutive matches at home last week before facing a resurgent Joburg Super Kings (15 points) on Sunday.After suffering three defeats on the coast, the Super Kings were delighted to be back on the Highveld and stormed to a nine-wicket bonus point victory over Sunrisers to reignite their push for the playoffs.The clash at the Wanderers also marked Joburg Super Kings captain Faf du Plessis’ 400th T20 appearance.Pretoria Capitals (9 points) and Durban’s Super Giants (8 points) both have one win so far this season and find themselves out of qualification contention.","Paarl Royals are the only team to have booked their place in the playoffs so far.

MI Emirates ' batters Tom Banton and Andre Fletcher took apart the Desert Vipers ' bowling attack to set up a big win for their team, which was completed in an emphatic fashion by their bowlers in the ILT20 match in Abu Dhabi on Monday.A 55-ball 105 by Banton and 96 off 50 balls by opener Fletcher deflated the Vipers' bowling attack, with only Mohammed Amir (1/36) among the seven bowlers used able to take a wicket when he dismissed opener Muhammad Waseem for 19.But after that, Banton and Fletcher added 198 runs for the second wicket in 16.5 overs to take the total to a huge 228 for 2. The demolition job by the two batters saw Banton hitting 9 fours and 7 sixes, while Fletcher smashed 10 fours and 3 sixes.The partnership was broken off the penultimate ball of their innings by way of Banton's run-out.The Vipers' chase never took off as they lost half the side for just 32 runs inside the Powerplay.Captain Sam Curran (11) and wicketkeeper-batter Azam Khan (12) were the only two batters to score in double digits, while pacers Muhammad Rohid (3 for 24) and Alzarri Joseph (3 for 17) ran through the Vipers' batting lineup with three wickets each.Fazalhaq Farooqi and Dan Mousley also bowled commendably, finishing with figures of 2 for 10 and 2 for 8, respectively.","MI Emirates beat Desert Vipers in ILT20 match in Abu Dhabi.

Champions Trophy Squad: Chief selector Ajit Agarkar and skipper Rohit Sharma PC

Rajkot: India's Test & ODI captain Rohit Sharma , star opener Yashasvi Jaiswal and ODI middle-order batter Shreyas Iyer will all not be available for Mumbai's last league match of the season against Meghalaya, which will start from January 30 at the Sharad Pawar Cricket Academy in BKC, TOI has learnt.Allrounder Shivam Dube will also miss that must-win match for the defending Ranji Trophy champions as he has been added to India's squad for the ongoing home T20I series against England.""Rohit, Jaiswal and Iyer are all likely to attend the BCCI's Naman Annual awards in Mumbai on February 1. Next day (February 2), they are supposed to report for a short camp to Nagpur before the three-match ODI series against England,"" a reliable source in the BCCI told this paper.Also See: ICC Champions Trophy 2025 The India-England ODI series will begin with the first ODI in Nagpur on February 6.Playing his first Ranji match in a decade, Rohit endured a forgettable outing as he only managed to log scores of six and 28, while Jaiswal made just four and 26 as Mumbai suffered a stunning five-wicket defeat to Jammu & Kashmir at BKC last week.Iyer was out for scores of just 11 and 17, but overall, with 480 runs in five matches at an average of 68.57, and two hundreds, he's been Mumbai's top run-getter in the Ranji Trophy this season. Dube, meanwhile, was out for a 'King Pair' (0 & 0) in the match.Also See: Champions Trophy Fixtures 2025 Mumbai, who have 22 points, still have a faint chance to go through to the knockouts. They need to beat Meghalaya, ideally by a bonus point, and hope that Baroda (27 points) would lose outright to J&K at home or concede the first innings lead if the match ends in a draw.The exit of so many India stars means that in-form talented opener Ayush Mhatre (408 runs in five matches at 45.33 with two centuries), who missed the last match, and allrounder Suryansh Shedge could return to the XI for the key game.On Sunday, Shedge smashed a 71-ball ton, while Mhatre hit 34-ball fifty for the Mumbai U-23 team against Bihar in a Col CK Nayudu Trophy match. Pragnesh Kanpillewar (177 not out, 195b, 16x4, 4x6) too did well in that match.","Rohit Sharma, Yashasvi Jaiswal and Shreyas Iyer will miss Mumbai's last league match.

NEW DELHI: As Indian cricket holds its breath over Jasprit Bumrah ’s fitness, it has emerged his back injury is due to be assessed by orthopedic surgeon Dr Rowan Schouten in New Zealand, with a consultation visit also planned depending on his report and feedback.TOI understands that the Indian cricket board ( BCCI ) is already planning a backup since Bumrah could be cutting it very fine to get fit in time for ICC Champions Trophy next month The ace bowler has been picked for CT and also named in the team for the third ODI against England in Ahmedabad on Feb 12, but there are no high hopes around him.The changes to the CT team can be made till Feb 11. The selectors have already named Harshit Rana for the first two ODIs against England. It will be interesting to see if they continue with Rana should Bumrah fail to get fit for CT.Sources said given the experience he has, Mohammed Siraj could be back in contention in such a scenario.“The BCCI medical team is in touch with Schouten in New Zealand. The board had also planned a visit for Bumrah to New Zealand. But that hasn’t happened yet. The selectors know it will be a miracle if Bumrah turns up 100% fit in the given timeline,” a BCCI source told TOI.Schouten had operated on Bumrah after he missed the T20 World Cup in 2022. He didn’t take the field in the second innings of the Sydney Test in the first week of this month when he complained of discomfort in his back.Bumrah and the rest of the fast bowlers who played most Test matches during the Test season were advised to take a three week offloading process. The offloading process dictates a player to not undertake any strenuous physical activity which includes basic fitness training as well. BCCI’s medical team was due to evaluate Bumrah’s condition after the offloading process which was due to end last week.Also See: Champions Trophy Full Scheudle “The reports will be shared with his doctor in New Zealand. Sending Bumrah to New Zealand will depend on the feedback. The board and Bumrah himself are not willing to push hard given his significance over a long period of time,” the source said.“The selectors will only be informed if he is ready to take the field after the entire process is complete. The selectors will need to keep a backup plan ready for him. It will be a miracle if Bumrah makes it,” the source added.It may be recalled that the Indian team tried to rush Bumrah back in action in a home series against Australia in 2022 which resulted in him breaking down again and he subsequently missed the T20 World Cup. Mohammed Shami’s comeback in international cricket is held back as the team management has not opted to play him in the first two T20Is against England.However, TOI understands that the team management is saving him for the ODI season, and is happy with how Shami is shaping up after a long injury layoff.“Shami has shed two kgs from what he weighed before his injury. He is bowling at full tilt. He is not needed as much in the T20 matches. But he should be good to go once the ODIs come around,” the source added.",Jasprit Bumrah's back injury is due to be assessed by orthopedic surgeon Dr Rowan Schouten in New Zealand.

R Ashwin announces retirement from Test cricket

Former India spinner Ravichandran Ashwin recently took a jibe at England batter Harry Brook for his unusual excuse of 'smog' affecting their performance in the first T20I in Kolkata.England have struggled in the series so far, being bowled out for 132 in Kolkata and then restricted to 159/9 in the second T20I in Chennai.After the first match, Brook claimed that the smog in Kolkata made it difficult for them to see the ball properly. However, following Brook's second consecutive dismissal to Varun Chakravarthy in Chennai, Ashwin pointed out the clear visibility conditions.On his YouTube channel 'Ash Ki Baat', Ashwin addressed Brook directly: ""There was no smog there in Chennai. Harry Brook had earlier stated that there was smog in Kolkata, so picking Varun Chakravarthy was difficult. I want to say one thing to Harry Brook: 'Please understand that Varun Chakravarthy doesn't bowl leg spin that much. It is [a] googly'.""Also See: 2025 Champions Trophy Ashwin further analysed Brook's dismissals in the series, emphasising that the England batter's inability to read Chakravarthy's deliveries was the main issue, regardless of the lighting conditions.""You moved to the leg stump and couldn't read the delivery, so you got bowled. Then you covered the stump and took a big stride, but couldn't read the googly, you got bowled again.

While Tilak has carved a niche for himself with positive intent-filled knocks, the fast-rising 22-year-old on Saturday displayed another key facet of his game.Up against a pace-heavy England attack on a tricky Chepauk track in the second T20I, Tilak showed excellent awareness in the successful 166-run chase and did just what the doctor ordered when the match seemed to be drifting away from the hosts. The southpaw expertly blended caution and aggression besides taking up the lead role in tough circumstances.Also See: 2025 Champions Trophy “The pitch was double-paced and it was quite challenging to bat on. Wickets were falling continuously, and I was thinking that I should bat till the end. I wanted to show intent and I was looking for the gaps as well. I did that,” said Tilak after delivering a spectacular unbeaten 72, for which the ‘Man of the Match’ deservedly received a standing ovation.“I know that I can play both types, hitting at a good strike-rate and scoring at six or seven runs per over. During the drinks break, Gautam Gambhir (head coach) told me that I can show everyone that I can play over 10 and under 10 (run-rate). He asked me to be flexible. I got a chance to prove myself in this game,” added Tilak.The youngster operated with a simple yet effective mantra. He met fire with fire, targeting pacer Jofra Archer , whom he smacked for 30 runs off just nine deliveries.“I wanted to take on their (England’s) best bowlers. If I take on the best bowlers, it will put pressure on the others. When wickets were falling, I wanted to take on their best bowler. I felt that it would make the job easier for the batters at the other end. I backed myself and took chances. I was mentally prepared for it, having played those shots at the nets,” he said.Also See: ICC Champions Trophy Fixtures 2025 Brimming with confidence after producing yet another effective knock, Tilak is prepared to perform a different role if required. “Before the South Africa series, I had not batted much at No. 3, maybe two or three times. I am ready to bat anywhere, and I am flexible. I know how to manage while batting at Nos 4, 5 or 6, but I like batting at No. 3. What the team needs, I am ready for that,” Tilak went on to add.",Tilak Varma was named Man of the Match in the second T20I against England. The 22-year-old was promoted to No. 3 after scoring double centuries in South Africa. The left-hander showed excellent awareness in the successful 166-run chase.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117589058,imgsize-39890,width-400,resizemode-4/117589058.jpg"

Srinagar thrash Bangalore by 10 wickets

Sachin Tendulkar’s contribution in ISPL is invaluable, says League Commissioner Suraj Samat

NEW DELHI: The second day of the Indian Street Premier League ( ISPL ) Season 2 delivered electrifying action with Falcon Risers Hyderabad and Srinagar Ke Veer kicking off their campaigns in spectacular fashion after a mesmerising performance by playback singer Sonu Nigam at the Dadoji Kondadev Stadium in Thane.In the first match, Falcon Risers Hyderabad secured a comfortable eight-wicket victory against Chennai Singams.The Falcons chased down the target of 69 runs with ease, losing just two wickets and finishing the game with three overs to spare.Chennai Singams, opting to bat first after winning the toss, had a shaky start as opener Ketan Mhatre was dismissed in the first over. Jagannath Sarkar, the other opener, showcased his power-hitting skills, smashing 22 runs off just 8 deliveries before being run out due to a miscommunication with Prashant Gharat.Sarkar's brief but impactful innings proved to be the only dominant period for the Singams, as the rest of their batters struggled against the Falcons' bowling attack. Gharat fell shortly after, caught by Padmesh Mhatre off a bouncer from Vicky Bhoir.The Singams faced mounting pressure as wickets fell at regular intervals, despite surviving the two Tape Ball overs bowled by Vishwajit Thakur. Adding to their woes, they failed to score the minimum requirement of 10 runs during the 50-50 over, resulting in a deduction of three runs from their total.The Falcons' chase began steadily, with openers Padmesh Mhatre and Kisan Satpute keeping the scoreboard ticking.Although Chennai briefly fought back, dismissing Satpute and Shreyash Kadam in quick succession, Hyderabad regained control as skipper Sambhaji Patil joined Mhatre to seal the victory in style.Srinagar Ke Veer too kicked off their campaign with a resounding 10-wicket win over KVN Bangalore Strikers.The Strikers were held to their lowest ISPL score of 61/6.In response, Sagar Ali and Mangesh Vaity chased down the target in just 5.3 overs.Sagar became the first batter this season to score a half-century, reaching the milestone in only 23 deliveries. The left-hander's explosive knock, combined with Vaity's support, helped Srinagar Ke Veer outclass their opponents in a commanding fashion.",Falcon Risers Hyderabad beat Chennai Singams by eight wickets.

CHENNAI: Once England all-rounder Brydon Carse was brought in as replacement for Gus Atkinson in the second T20I against India , he wasted no time making his mark. On Saturday, Carse first helped turn the tide with a cameo and later delivered the breakthroughs that gave England a glimmer of hope.Carse’s performance was as much about seizing the moment as it was about making a case for his place in England’s crowded fast-bowling lineup.“I think the current English stock of fast bowlers is pretty high, the competition for places is good. So, every time you put on an England shirt, you try and put in a good performance. You know that there are guys waiting in the wings,” said Carse, whose cricketing journey has been punctuated by a knee injury and a 16-month suspension for betting on matches.First, Carse with the bat. Walking in at No 8 with England struggling against spin, the 29-year-old launched a quick-fire 31 from just 17 balls (1x4, 3x6) to pad up the total. He even took on mystery spinner Varun Chakravarthy, striking back-to-back sixes, including an audacious one-handed hit over deep backward square-leg. While his stay ended with a run-out, his cameo lifted England’s total beyond what seemed possible before his arrival.“I felt in good rhythm, and I was always going to be trying to be positive towards the spinners and pick my strong areas. On Saturday, that paid off. It is always frustrating to get run out, but those things happen, a little bit of miscommunication from both of us but I spoke to Jof (Jofra Archer). He is fine and the game goes on,” said Carse.It was with the ball that Carse truly stood out. On a fresh surface offering good bounce, the right-arm quick hit the hard lengths that sent back three key India batters – skipper Suryakumar Yadav , Dhruv Jurel and Washington Sundar.“I think we are always going to take that aggressive approach like how we bowled today … we are always trying to get wickets and setting fields to try and continually pick up wickets. On another day, a chance here or there and we (may) come out winners,” he declared.",Brydon Carse made 31 from just 17 balls in second T20I against India.

‘Surya playing for team, is a selfless cricketer’

Stuart Broad on India's challenge in the Champions Trophy

RAJKOT: A critical part of India's new batting coach Sitanshu Kotak ’s role will, of course, start after the ongoing India versus England T20I series. Somehow, he has to help the two stalwarts of Indian batting — skipper Rohit Sharma and star batter Virat Kohli , who have been going through a bad patch — rediscover their touch.Ahead of the third T20I at the Niranjan Shah Stadium, asked if he had identified where he would help them rectify any minor weaknesses that may have crept into their game, Kotak said, “See, Rohit and Virat are very senior players, but even the players we have now, it is a lot more about sharing, a lot to try and understand how they are planning their games, where they think and then if we can add something, that is how I think.”A regular head coach with India for the last three years and a domestic cricket warhorse for Saurashtra, Kotak didn’t shy away from saying that even he could learn a few things from Rohit and Virat, two modern-day greats of the game.“If I can add value to 2%, 5%, that is a great thing, because the amount of cricket they have played and the way they have performed, it would not be unfair to say there might be a lot of things that I can also learn from them. That is the way this game goes, you have to be open and you have to be ready to learn,” he said.He made it clear that if he had any suggestions about their batting in his mind, he would speak to them at the opportune time. “If they are in a mindset, during that point of time, if they are ready to take any inputs, yes, I would have certain things in my mind and I will say it, but it has to be at the right time and they should feel that yes, they are ready for that,” the 52-year-old former left-hander said.Meanwhile, Kotak attributed Suryakumar Yadav 's dry run in the last few months to huge expectations. Considering that Suryakumar was playing “selfless and fearless cricket” for the benefit of the Indian team, there would be times when he and the other Indian batters would get out while trying to play a risky shot.“Sometimes, I feel (that) we also expect a lot. The game has become so aggressive and that is the intent (with which) we have to play T20. There will be a time when the batters will get out because they are playing fearless and selfless (cricket), because if you want to score 200, 225 and if you are careful and trying to save your wicket, both the things won't go hand in hand. So, he is definitely a person who is playing for the team. He is very, very selfless and that is what he is telling the whole group of batters that we have to be selfless,” Kotak explained.“The way he is batting, he is in the same flow as he was before, I think. Nothing (wrong with his batting) really I would say that. But yes, plan-wise, the opposition will try and plan to bowl in some areas and obviously we read that, and he is very smart. So, he comes up with things which he knows we can add something and according to that, he keeps practicing. I don't really think that his form or runs have been dry or anything,” Kotak added.India’s batting coach concluded by saying that he was hoping for Surya to bounce back into form on Tuesday night. “I think, touch wood, this game!”",Sitanshu Kotak is India's new batting coach. The 52-year-old has been with the national team for the last three years. Kotak says he can learn a lot from the likes of Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli.

Barcelona scored their first four goals in 24 minutes and ended up hammering seven past a struggling Valencia for a commanding 7-1 victory on Sunday to give a much-needed impetus to their La Liga campaign.At the break, Barcelona were sitting at a handsome 5-0 lead. Fermin Lopez netted twice in the first half, while Frenkie de Jong, Ferran Torres and Raphinha also scored.The result marked Barcelona's second victory in last nine league fixtures. Hansi Flick's team now sits seven points behind La Liga leaders Real Madrid and three points adrift of second-placed Atletico Madrid.In the second half of the match, Hugo Duro managed to score for Valencia, before Robert Lewandowski added to Barcelona's tally, followed by a Cesar Tarrega own goal.Flick altered his team selection against Valencia, seeking to address the club's recent disappointing domestic results.The manager opted to rest Lewandowski and Ronald Araujo from the starting line-up and Pedri was unavailable due to stomach issues, allowing De Jong, Ferran Torres and the impressive Lopez to start.The comprehensive victory was a fair reflection of Barcelona's dominance, while dealing a significant blow to Carlos Corberan's Valencia, who remain in the 19th position, four points adrift of safety.Meanwhile, fourth-placed Athletic Bilbao failed to capitalise at home, managing only a goalless draw against Leganes, leaving them two points behind Barcelona.In other matches, Getafe boosted their survival hopes with a convincing 3-0 victory at Real Sociedad, moving up to 14th position, whilst Rayo Vallecano mounted a comeback to defeat Girona 2-1.","Barcelona thrashed Valencia 7-1 in La Liga on Sunday.

McManaman on Thomas Tuchel as the new England coach

MUMBAI: Things could hardly be going any better for Liverpool at the moment, be it domestically or in Europe. The Reds sit proudly atop the standings of both, the Premier League as well as the Uefa Champions League. In the latter, they are the only team in the revamped 36-club competition to have won each of their seven games so far.It’s the kind of position not many might have expected Liverpool to be in considering the arrival of a new manager in Arne Slot last summer following the end of a successful era under Juergen Klopp. “An incredible six months”, was how former Liverpool star Steve McManaman would describe it, though, he would also strike a cautious note saying it’s “the last four months” which would ultimately count.“I think the new manager and the coaching staff have been amazing, and the players as well,” McManaman, who is in India on an invitation from Standard Chartered for the SC Cup corporate football tournament, told The Times of India here on Saturday. “I didn’t think it’d be a huge transition because the team last year were very good. Of course, Juergen leaving was a blow at the time, but the new manager has come in and the team have responded really well.”The 52-year-old former England international put the exceptional start down to the solid foundations built during the Klopp era, which, he said, have helped Slot’s cause, as well as players getting better with experience, citing the examples of Ryan Gravenberch, Dominik Szoboszlai and Alexis Mac Allister. “The younger players have got more experience, so they’ve become better players. So all in all, I think they’ve all responded really well to the season, but I didn’t think that they’d be top of the league by six points with a game in hand and win seven from seven in the Champions League. So they’ve surprised me in that respect,” McManaman said.“When Juergen left, I think the foundations within Liverpool were exceptional, and Arne Slott has picked it up. We haven’t won any trophies yet this year, so it’s important not to go crazy. At this moment in time, he’s had an incredible six months, but the last four months are the most important months, starting with the League Cup second leg in a couple of weeks time against Tottenham (Liverpool lost the away leg 1-0).”But could the uncertainty surrounding the futures of key players like Mohamed Salah , Trent Alexander-Arnold and Virgil van Dijk be a stumbling block in the path of a team, who, according to McManaman, have the depth to “conceivably do the quadruple”?“The Mo Salah situation, Trent, Virgil van Dijk doesn’t bother me in the least. It won’t distract them. As a professional footballer, you want to be successful,” McManaman, a former Champions League winning midfielder with Real Madrid, said, adding: “In 2021, we had Mo Salah, (Roberto) Firmino and Sadio Mane in the same situation and they were going for the quadruple that year as well. So, no, I don’t think the contract situation is an issue at all.“I think Mo Salah wants to win every single trophy he can, including the Ballon d’or, including the leading goalscorer, the Golden Boot. So he won’t be thinking about his contract situation. That’s just secondary.”As well as it’s going at Anfield, it’s a different picture playing out at the Etihad, where defending champions Manchester City, the club which marked the final stop in McManaman’s playing career, are attempting to salvage their season after experiencing a shocking slump.While some pundits believe the long-term ACL injury suffered by Ballon d’Or winner Rodri has laid bare City’s lack of midfield recruitment in recent transfer windows, McManaman said the negative run could not be explained by the Spaniard’s absence alone.“I think it's a number of things. You can't lose games just because you lose one football player. I think Kevin de Bruyne was out at the same time, which didn't help. They had a number of issues defensively, which didn't help. And when I spoke about Liverpool getting a year more experience, the young kids getting a year older, maybe the Manchester City players are just getting older, that's all!“They've set such a high benchmark over the last four years, five years, that any decline is jumped upon. I still think they'll qualify for the Champions League (playoffs). They need to beat Club Brugge (on Wednesday). If they do that, they'll qualify and then you'll see probably a different Manchester City team. But, yeah, it's only because their standards have been incredibly high that any dip is pounced upon by the media,” said McManaman.“I personally would prefer an English manager to manage England. I know the FA did not speak to Eddie Howe. I know they didn't speak to Graham Potter. I know they didn't speak to a number of English players which was surprising. They thought Thomas Tuchel was the best man for the job, so fair enough, and I hope he wins the World Cup, I hope he's successful. But the fact that he's only got an 18-month contract suggests that after the World cup he might leave if he doesn't win the World Cup. So I don't know what the ins and outs is, but my personal preference would have been an English manager to represent the English national team.”",Steve McManaman says Liverpool have had an 'incredible six months' The former England international is in India for the SC Cup corporate football tournament.

While City are having a tough time, I do not think anybody can be really too critical.”Lambert had a huge role to play for Dortmund in his short one-year spell.

There’s an opaqueness to Jannik Sinner on a tennis court, the tighter a match gets the more inscrutable his expression becomes. Then, as the contest peaks and he is pulled out wide, he threads the needle with a two-hander. Sinner clutches his racket at the throat and shakes it, as if he’s in a conversation with his coaches Darren Cahill and Simone Vagnozzi, who are seated in his courtside box.The 23-year-old World No.1, who scored a straight-set win over the No.2 seed Alexander Zverev in the Australian Open final on Sunday, which made him the first Italian to lift three Grand Slam trophies, has been under a doping cloud these last nine months. Sinner, who won successive hard court majors in a span of four months while dealing with the upshot of positive drug tests, has flaunted serious heft.The World Anti-Doping Agency has appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport and a hearing is scheduled for April. The Italian faces a potential ban of up to two years.“Even when it's very difficult to block these kind of things, when I go on the court, I have the team and people who are close to me who trust me,” he said, sporting a striking Italian blue for his post-championship media conference. “That for me is even more important because I can talk with them, very openly.”“When I go on court, I try to focus on the match,” he said. “I know the match can be three, four, five hours, but that's the time when I have to be very focused. Obviously also in the gym, trying to stay with your routine, then you think a bit less about what's happening. Of course, it's still a little bit in the back of your mind.”Sinner and world No.3 Carlos Alcaraz, who have taken the baton from tennis’ terrific trio – Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and the still-competing Novak Djokovic -- who between them have won the last five Grand Slams, and six of the last seven, said he doesn’t need to use the CAS case to give him extra motivation to succeed.“What happened, happened, no?” Sinner said. “As I always say, I keep playing like this because I have a clear mind on what happened. If I was guilty, I would not play like this, that's it. At the moment, I'm not thinking about this. Of course, you have your moments, certain days where you feel like I wish I would not have this problem. In the other way, I'm always looking forward to go on the court.”Sinner, whose first language is German and speaks passable Italian, is his country’s most popular sportsperson. Last year, when Sinner emerged as the surprise winner of the Melbourne Park fortnight, there were no Italian journalists present, there hadn’t been one for years. This year there was almost a dozen of them, tracking the No.1s moves.Gaia Piccardi, tennis writer for Corriere Della Sera, says Italians admire Sinner’s work ethic. “Italians love a good sporting story, especially one that’s going to go a few years,” she says, “they see Jannik as someone they can cheer on for another 10 years.’’Vagnozzi, who has been with Sinner since February 2022, spoke of the No.1’s mental prowess.“Mentally he is really, really strong. When he wants something, he tries to do the best he can. So sometimes when someone speak about Jannik, they talk about his groundstrokes or his power. But for me, as a coach, when you ask him (to do) something, he's able to do it quite fast.”Zverev, who said Sinner was miles ahead of everyone on hardcourts, compared the Italian to Djokovic at his best.“They barely miss, they make you think like you have to overhit all the time to have a chance in a rally against them,” the German said of Djokovic and Sinner. “It's very, very difficult to win a point from the back of the court against them. They're constantly on the baseline. They don't give you any space. They don't give you any time.”Sinner’s win over Zverev in the Australian Open final took his win streak in hardcourt majors to 21 matches. The Italian hasn’t lost a set against top-10 opposition since losing to Alcaraz in the Beijing final.“I think the facts speak for themselves,” Zverev said. “He's in a different universe right now to anyone else.”",World No.1 Jannik Sinner won the Australian Open on Sunday.

Alexander Zverev 's loss in the Australian Open final on Sunday was followed by a startling moment during the trophy ceremony.As Zverev stood at the microphone, a person in the stadium repeatedly shouted the names of two of his ex-girlfriends who have accused him of physical abuse in the past, saying ""Australia believes"" them.The crowd's reaction was mixed, with some booing and whistling in response to the interruption. At his post-match press conference, Zverev was asked about the incident.""I believe there are no more accusations,"" Zverev responded. ""There haven't been for — what? — nine months now. ... I think I've done everything I can, and I'm not about to open that subject again.""Last June, as Zverev reached the French Open final , news emerged that a Berlin district court had ended a trial stemming from a woman's accusation of domestic violence during a 2020 argument. The resolution was reached with the agreement of state prosecutors and lawyers for Zverev and his former partner.Zverev had previously denied another assault allegation made by a different woman. The ATP investigated her claims and stated in January 2023 that there was insufficient evidence.","Alexander Zverev lost to Novak Djokovic in the Australian Open final.

Jannik Sinner retains Australian Open title with straight sets victory over Alexander Zverev,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/australian-open/jannik-sinner-retains-australian-open-title-with-straight-sets-victory-over-alexander-zverev/articleshow/117578014.cms,"(Photo by Darrian Traynor/Getty Images)

Jannik Sinner threw in a daring drop shot at match point, it came off his forehand side and was shaped with underspin. Alexander Zverev picked it up and didn't place it too poorly, but Sinner stepped in and swung through the court to close out the Australian Open final.After two-hours and 42-minutes of action in which time he strung together the 6-3, 7-6 (4), 6-3 win, Sinner, the world No.1, pushed his head back and threw up his arms in celebration. After the few seconds he had to himself, Rod Laver Arena on its feet, cheering him, Sinner looked at his team – coaches Darren Cahill and Simone Vagnozzi, trainer and physio Marco Panichi and Ulises Badio – before going over to embrace them.Not far from where Sinner celebrated his second successive win at Australian Open, Zverev, the world No.2, sat in his courtside seat, head bowed. The German has played three Slam finals and is looking for his first major title.Sinner and Zverev shared a warm embrace at the net and the 23-year-old began his speech with encouraging words for Zverev.""You are an amazing player,"" Sinner said. ""Keep believing in yourself, because all players and coaches know how strong you are, not only as a player, but also as a person. We all believe that you can lift one of these very, very soon.""Sinner, now a two-time Australian Open champion, and a three-time major winner, placed the Norman Brookes Challenge Cup beside him as he spoke, said, ""Talking about my team, what can I say? We worked a lot to be again in this position. It’s an amazing feeling to share this moment with all of you. It is amazing to achieve these things, but mostly to share this with you guys.""""And I know Darren, it's probably your - maybe, I try to convince you to stay - your last Australian Open as a coach, and I'm very, very happy to share this trophy with you,"" Sinner told Cahill, who was tearing up. ""Everything started a little bit when I made my whole change to Simone (Vagnozzi), and I think you are an amazing combination of coaches.""Earlier, when the German stepped forward to make his speech, there was a shout from the crowd, ""Australia Believes Olya and Brenda! Australia Believes Olya and Brenda!""Zverev battled a domestic violence case in Germany last year, accused by his ex-girlfriend Brenda Patea, the mother of his child, of physically abusing her. All of which he denies and wasn't formally charged.When asked about it in the press conference, Zverev said, ""I believe there are no more accusations. There haven't been for nine months now. Good for her. I think she was the only one in the stadium who believed anything in that moment. I think I've done everything I can, and I'm not about to open that subject again.""Zverev applauded the winner in his speech. ""You are the best player in the world by far. I was hoping that I could be more of a competitor today, but you were just too good. Congratulations to you. You really deserve it.""Sinner, who hasn't lost a set against top-ten opponents since losing to Carlos Alcaraz in Beijing in September, may not have played his best match in the final, but did enough to get through without facing a breakpoint.Sinner was kitted in colour blocks of the palest yellow and white, his attire cutting an anaemic look, while across the net Zverev was all colour, red on maroon with red shoes.In the first set, the 27-year-old, coming into the net, trying to unsettle the Italian, gave Sinner some target practice. The German trailed 15-40 in the fourth and eighth games, if the defending champion was sharpening his knife in the fourth game, he struck in the eighth and then went on to serve out the set at love in the ninth, closing with a 194 kmph ace.The roof over Rod Laver Arena was open and like the evening sky, that had lost some of its sparkle, Zverev, who looked to be in striking form as he advanced to the final at Melbourne Park , seemed to have lost some of the edge. The German did well to push the set to tie-break, where Sinner came through with a slice of luck on the ninth point, the net cord working for him, and the world No.1 broke away to seal a two-sets-to-love lead.In the third set, Sinner broke in the sixth game, as a dejected Zverev appeared to throw in the towel. The Italian was out in the front and didn't look back.","World No.1 Jannik Sinner beats Alexander Zverev in Australian Open final. Sinner wins 6-3, 7-6 (4), 6- 3 in two-hours and 42-minutes in Melbourne. German Sinner is a two-time Australian Open champion and three-time major winner.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117578658,imgsize-55946,width-400,resizemode-4/117578658.jpg"

The Times of India in Melbourne:

Madison Keys walked into her post-championship media interaction in black tights and a blue tee, wearing her wholesome halo.The Australian Open champion took a sip of the celebratory bubbly and spoke eloquently about shifting goal posts, development tools, and the importance of therapy. ""I think everyone needs therapy,"" she said.Keys was all of 11 when she was first talked of as a future Grand Slam champion, at that point it was music to her ears. The American -- Rock Island, Illinois-born -- turned pro on her 14th birthday and made her WTA debut a few weeks later. Keys, already 5 ft 10 and clocking 115 mph serves, entered the Grand Slam field for the first time at Melbourne Park as an 18-year-old, the following year she stormed into her first major semifinal, at the Australian Open. In 2017, three years later, she made the US Open final.Keys, who dug deep in her media conference, said the talk around her as a child was meant to be confidence-building, an exercise in positivity.""Then you are older, you're in the later stages of your career and it kind of feels like, will this ever happen? If it doesn't happen, I didn't live up to what everyone told me I should have done,"" Keys said. ""It went from being something positive to something that (triggered) a little bit of panic. It started to kind of weigh on me. What if I never do it? If I don’t do it, am I considered a failure?""The American, who married her coach Bjorn Fratangelo , 31, acknowledged the load she was carrying was heavy.Keys, whose ranking slipped out of the top-20 late last year, was forced to look at herself in the mirror.""I finally got to the point where I was proud of myself and proud of my career, with or without a Grand Slam,"" she said, looking at the Daphne Akhurst Memorial Cup. ""I didn't need it to feel like I had a good career.""Shrugging off that weight allowed Keys to go all-out on the court and win a Grand Slam.Keys, who on Saturday became the oldest player to defeat the World No.1 and No.2 in the semifinal and final at a Grand Slam event since the WTA rankings were published in 1975, said she owed her turnaround to lots of therapy.Keys, soon to be 30, is the lowest-seeded player (No.19) to win the Australian Open in the Open Era.The American, who turns 30 in a few weeks, went the sports therapy route initially, looking to nail results. Then Keys started digging, she asked herself tough questions, what did she feel about herself?""Getting help and talking to someone not just about tennis, but about how I felt about myself, again, very uncomfortable. I never really like to be uncomfortable,"" Keys said, she was speaking for a majority. ""(But) had I not done that, I wouldn't be sitting here.""The trigger stirred when Keys had got to a point where she started to feel low and didn’t really care about tennis and results, she just wanted to feel better. She was aching to exhale.""For a long time I had this idea that people were able to ignore their nerves and just tunnel vision,"" she said. ""It was a light bulb moment (when I realized) I can be nervous and I can still play good tennis. Those things can live together. I stopped fighting, trying to push away the feelings and pretending that they're not there and just accepting them.""Keys pointed out that the stigma around therapy was starting to go away.""Everyone should be in therapy, no matter what,"" she said with a smile. ""No matter what's going on in your life, you're going to have moments where things are tough and you need someone to talk to. It's something I will continue to do for the rest of my life.""Keys, flaunting a normalcy that was enviable, might be the new standard in sport.",Madison Keys won the Australian Open on Saturday. She is the lowest-seeded player (No.19) to win the tournament in the Open Era. Keys is the oldest player to defeat the World No.1 and No.2 in a Grand Slam semifinal and final since 1975.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117576226,imgsize-118474,width-400,resizemode-4/117576226.jpg"

TimesofIndia.com in Melbourne:

Professional sport is decided by moments. By sudden change in momentum. By luck. By one wicket. By one boundary. By one jab. By one point. The margins between win and loss, joy and sorrow, could well be just that. Years and years of hard work could well be decided by these small facets. How you play that one delivery coming at you at 150 kmph. How well you land that 150 kmph in the first place. How, if at all, you duck that right hook. How you play that forehand when down match point. Or, conversely, play the big points – such as a match point – when you've got lots at stake. Madison Keys and Aryna Sabalenka had plenty at stake when they took court in front of tens of thousands of people at the Rod Laver Arena on Saturday. A $3.5 million prize cheque. 2000 ranking points. Opportunity to lift the Daphne Akhurst Memorial Cup. Accolades.Sabalenka had done these things before already, though. Twice (in 2023 and 2024). She was going for a three-peat at Melbourne Park. No one had won three in a row here since Martina Hingis in 1999. She had had a largely uneventful run to the title match. Except for the tricky second set, under stiff conditions, against Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova in the quarter-final, things had gone smoothly and as per plan.Keys, meanwhile, had ticked none of those boxes. Her last run to a major final was eight years ago – the longest gap between first two women's singles Grand Slam finals. She had not been in the top 10 for two years. And her run to the final was laden with high-profile wins – against World No. 10 Danielle Collins, World No. 6 Elena Rybakina, World No. 28 Elena Svitolina and World No. 2 Iga Swiatek . Against Swiatek, Keys was required to save a match point.On Saturday, Keys started and ended well. She broke Sabalenka in the very first game and to complete the full circle, did that once again in what was the eventual 38th game of the two-hour contest. In the moments that mattered, the miniscule bits in the grand scheme of things, Keys was braver and hit bigger shots against Sabalenka, considered one of the biggest and boldest hitters in women's tennis.In the seventh game of the decisive third set, Keys served at 30-30. The crowd was aware of the magnitude of the point as the intensity and decibel level went up. If it went Sabalenka's way, she would have a break point to create a match-changing lead. Instead, Keys served wide to the forehand and punched a winner on the return to the other side of the court. Next point, a mirror image of it with a backhand winner.Fast forward four games, it was 5-5 and 30-30, the sun had set over the Melbourne skyline and the twilight had made way for a clear and cool night. Keys bounced the ball to serve and the nerves, if any, were not quite visible for either player. They were dialled in, as you need to in professional sport from start to finish. One miscalculation, one mishit, any passivity and it could be curtains. Keys, though, was in the zone. She got down low to a deep return and diverted the ball into the corner for a winner. Next point, same direction for a similar outcome and she had pushed the envelope in Sabalenka's side.The Belarusian, who had started the match poorly, especially on serve, had regained control. But, as already mentioned, we were in small margins territory now. ""Squeaky bum time,"" as legendary Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson referred to it. Four points separated Keys from the title. Sabalenka started by sending her forehand long on a mishit. Make that three. On the second, Keys romped to a little kick serve for a backhand winner. Two more to get. Sabalenka erred on the forehand a point later and it was Championship point. The World No. 1 saved one. Could she prolong the edge-of-the-seat encounter, everyone wondered. Many neutrals in the Rod Laver Arena hoped. Instead, Keys went inside out on the forehand once and then again, the first one came back but the second one didn't. 'Maddy' had done it!Keys was the 2025 Australian Open champion. Her first-ever Grand Slam title, 16 years after turning pro. The 30-year-old became the fourth oldest first-time Grand Slam winner. When the rankings are updated on Monday, she would match her career-best World No. 7 ranking.The contrast in emotions was visible across the net. Keys erupted with smiles, joy, and sheer disbelief. She made her way to her team and exchanged hugs with everyone, including husband and coach Bjorn Fratangelo, whom she married only eight weeks ago.For Sabalenka, meanwhile, it was bewilderment – at the outcome, the tennis she displayed and most problematically, she acknowledged, with her humility of the situation. The racket bore the brunt of that. She bumbled to her box and coaches, with whom she shares a great relationship filled with laughter and banter, as she made her way to the net for the customary handshake – or hug in this case. The 27-year-old then smacked her racket on the ground and walked off to the locker room.""There definitely was a bit of frustration because I was so close to achieve [achieving] something crazy. When you're out there, you're fighting, but it seems like everything [was] going not the way you really want [it] to go. I just needed to throw those negative emotions at the end just so I could give a speech, not stand there being disrespectful. I was just trying to let it go and be a good person, be respectful,"" she said in the post-match media interaction with a laugh. ""I was stand [standing] there and just was like, ‘Okay, c'mon, you've been in her position. She deserves that. She was [a] better player than you.' Just, you know, it was tough,"" added Sabalenka.During the first set and start of the second, Sabalenka would look at her box repeatedly, mumble something, and continue. Things were not going her way and Keys deserved most of the credit for that. If the serve was faltering, it was because it had come under the pump from the word go. The American, who had won the Australian Open warm-up event in Adelaide, had come out quickly off the blocks and was sending deep groundstrokes to counter Sabalenka's game of dominating proceedings with her sheer power. The Belarusian, who has three major titles on hard courts, looked clueless.She later said, at this point in her career, it was ""trophy or nothing"".""Nobody remembers the finalist, you know? Nobody puts, like, next to the winner [the] finalist's name,"" she said with a smile. ""I mean, at this point, yeah, I go for titles. But, of course, I have to be proud of myself with the finals, three finals in the row. That's something crazy. I hope that next year I'll come back as a better player, and I'll hold Daphne one more time,"" she stated.",Madison Keys beat Aryna Sabalenka in straight sets to win Australian Open. The World No. 1 became the fourth Grand Slam winner of her career. Keys is the first woman to win the title in Melbourne since Martina Hingis in 1999.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117575700,imgsize-172866,width-400,resizemode-4/117575700.jpg"

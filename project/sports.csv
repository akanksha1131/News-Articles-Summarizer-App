India squad for first Test

South Africa squad

As India gear up to face South Africa in the first Test at Eden Gardens from Friday, skipper Shubman Gill KL Rahul and Ravindra Jadeja will have individual milestones in sight alongside the team’s push to strengthen their ICC World Test Championship campaign.India enter the series on the back of consistent red-ball form, with a home win against West Indies and a drawn series against England before that. With both teams looking to make an early statement in the two-match series, the opening Test in Kolkata holds added significance for India’s key performers.Gill, who has been in sublime touch this year, needs 161 runs to reach the 3,000-run mark in Test cricket. The right-hander has so far racked up 2,839 runs in 39 matches at an average of 43.01, including 10 centuries and eight fifties. His best score of 269 remains a career highlight.In 2025, the Indian captain has already scored 979 runs in 15 innings at an impressive average of 69.92, with five centuries and a fifty.KL Rahul, returning to the format as a reliable opener, is just 15 runs short of 4,000 in Tests. In 65 appearances, he has accumulated 3,985 runs at 36.55, registering 11 hundreds and 20 half-centuries, with a top score of 199.This year has been his best in the format, scoring 745 runs in eight Tests at an average of 53.21, including three centuries and three fifties.All-rounder Ravindra Jadeja, too, stands on the brink of a rare double. The left-hander has scored 3,990 runs in 87 Tests at an average of 38.73, with six centuries and 27 fifties. With 338 wickets to his name, Jadeja is just 12 shy of 350, and will be a feat that would make him only the second Indian after Kapil Dev to achieve the combination of 4,000 runs and 350 wickets in Tests.India will be looking to carry their momentum into the series opener, with milestones adding an extra layer of motivation for some of the top names at Eden Gardens.: Shubman Gill (C), Rishabh Pant (WK) (VC), Yashasvi Jaiswal, KL Rahul, Sai Sudharsan, Devdutt Padikkal, Dhruv Jurel, Ravindra Jadeja, Washington Sundar, Jasprit Bumrah, Axar Patel, Mohammed Siraj, Kuldeep Yadav, Akash Deep: Temba Bavuma (c), Corbin Bosch, Dewald Brevis, Tony de Zorzi, Zubayr Hamza, Simon Harmer, Marco Jansen, Keshav Maharaj, Aiden Markram, Wiaan Mulder, Senuran Muthusamy, Kagiso Rabada, Ryan Rickelton, Tristan Stubbs and Kyle Verreynne","India take on South Africa in the first Test at Eden Gardens on Friday.

Ahead of the first Test against South Africa at Eden Gardens, India assistant coach Ryan ten Doeschate said the team hopes to apply lessons from last year’s home Test series loss to New Zealand.The first Test starts on Friday in Kolkata.India enters the series after a 2-0 win against West Indies at home. South Africa comes in after drawing 1-1 in Pakistan, where their spinners Keshav Maharaj, Simon Harmer and Senuran Muthusamy took 33 of the 40 Pakistani wickets. All three averaged below 22. Maharaj took a nine-wicket haul in the series, Harmer recorded a four-wicket haul and a six-wicket haul, and Muthusamy was named Player of the Series with 11 wickets in the first Test.India still remembers the home Test series loss to New Zealand last year, where Ajaz Patel (15 wickets), Mitchell Santner (13 wickets) and Glenn Phillips (8 wickets) shared 36 out of 60 wickets. That defeat came against a lineup featuring Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, and Ravichandran Ashwin. The New Zealand series turned out to be their last Test appearance in India as Ashwin retired later in the middle of the Border-Gavaskar series in Australia, while Kohli and Rohit retired after the series.Speaking before the match, Doeschate said, ""You normally worry about the pace attack first and I am pretty sure they will go with two seamers and three if not four spinners. But that is also the challenge when you are playing in the subcontinent.""""Something as a team that we need to get better at. We addressed it early on. We have come up short a few times. So it is a great challenge.""India had lost a home series 0-3 to New Zealand last year.""Hopefully, we have learned from the New Zealand series. We have put some plans into place against how to play the spin. It is going to be so important over these two games. Particularly how well they did in Pakistan about four weeks ago.""Ten Doeschate said South Africa has developed well in recent months and credited their progress in Test cricket.""They deserve a lot of credit for how they have gone about their work in the last 9-10 months. The position they have found themselves in the World Test Championship, they have shown that they are a quality team -- to beat Australia in the final...,"" he said.""Also, the mention of how potent they are as a spin attack makes it even more mouth-watering, to be playing them at home,"" Doeschate said as quoted by news agency PTI.","India assistant coach Ryan ten Doeschate says team hopes to apply lessons from last year's home Test series loss to New Zealand.

RCB IPL 2026 trades, retentions, releases & squad updates: Why Virat Kohli is the BIGGEST concern

In the IPL's competitive environment, where player transfers and auctions are common, there's a rare club of cricketers who have maintained stable relationships with their respective teams. These players have become synonymous with their teams' identities, contributing significantly to their franchises' success and culture.Here's a list of such exclusive group of players never released by their IPL teams:Virat Kohli stands as the only player to have participated in all 18 IPL seasons with a single franchise, Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB). Acquired for Rs 12 lakh in 2008, Kohli holds the records for most runs and centuries in IPL history, including his remarkable 2016 season with 973 runs.MS Dhoni's leadership has been instrumental in Chennai Super Kings ' (CSK) journey since 2008, leading the team to five IPL titles. He holds records for most matches played and wicketkeeper dismissals, maintaining his position with CSK except during his two-year suspension from 2016 to 2017.Sachin Tendulkar represented Mumbai Indians (MI) exclusively from the IPL's beginning until his retirement in 2013. As the first Indian to secure the IPL Orange Cap, he accumulated 2,334 runs in 78 matches and continues to serve as a mentor for the team.Sunil Narine joined Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) in 2012 and has contributed significantly to their three IPL titles. He has established himself as KKR's highest wicket-taker and most capped player, becoming the only player to win the Most Valuable Player award three times.Ruturaj Gaikwad, who debuted with Chennai Super Kings in 2020, has quickly become an integral part of the team. He has scored over 2,500 runs in 71 matches at an average of 40.35 and a strike rate of 137.47, securing the Orange Cap in IPL 2021.The impact of these one-team players extends beyond statistics, as they have helped shape their teams' playing styles and strategies. Their presence has provided stability and continuity to their franchises during the tournament's evolution.","Virat Kohli is the only player to have participated in all 18 IPL seasons with a single franchise, Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) Sachin Tendulkar represented Mumbai Indians exclusively from the IPL's beginning until his retirement in 2013.

It was a busy day at the Football House in New Delhi as the All India Football Federation (AIFF) convened back-to-back meetings with multiple stakeholders in order to address the current predicament facing Indian football.AIFF called for interactions on short notice with Executive Committee members, Indian Super League (ISL) captains, club CEOs and I-League owners on Wednesday (November 12). ISL clubs and captains - except that of Mohun Bagan Super Giant and East Bengal - explored the possibility of putting in all their resources to make the top-tier tournament happen.Eight I-League clubs, meanwhile, stayed away from the meeting and are due to meet Sports Minister Mansukh Mandaviya on Thursday.“Keeping in mind the fundamental importance of a multi- tier league National structure for the development of the football in the country (Tier 1-2-3), we suggest that all the three leagues in this case ISL, I League and I League-2 should be managed by one common league partner. This shall ensure long term holistic growth and sustainability to the National league ecosystem of the country,” the I-League clubs reportedly wrote to AIFF deputy secretary general M Satyanarayan.I-League clubs gave AIFF the ultimatum of announcing the new season in the next 10 days with kick-off by December 15 and not later than January 5, 2026 with matches to be broadcast live on two of the biggest properties - Star Sports and JioHotstar; Sony Sports Network and SonyLiv.AIFF had asked for all the stakeholders to join in consecutive meetings on less than three-hour notice. The desperate move was necessitated by the impending Supreme Court hearing where Chairperson of the Bid Evaluation Committee, Justice (Retd.) L. Nageswara Rao, is due to brief the court on the current situation in Indian football. On November 7, AIFF's attempt to attract bids for the commercial rights found no takers.","The All India Football Federation (AIFF) convened back-to-back meetings with multiple stakeholders in order to address the current predicament facing Indian football.

Poll Should the AIFF take immediate action to secure the future of Indian football? Yes, it's urgent. No, let the current situation play out.

Three of India's top football clubs have halted operations amid the uncertainty over the future of the sport in the country. Kerala Blasters , Mohun Bagan Super Giant and Odisha FC have all suspended operations of their first teams. For the four teams that remain in the AIFF Super Cup, it is going to be business as usual - for now.East Bengal, Punjab FC, FC Goa and Mumbai City FC will play their AIFF Super Cup semi-finals on December 4 and 5 with the final on December 7. All matches will be played at the Fatorda Stadium in Goa.Sources within Punjab FC and Mumbai City FC have confirmed tothat the players have been given an extended break since their last encounter. Mumbai City FC last played on November 6 against Kerala Blasters and Punjab FC's last fixture came against Bengaluru FC on November 5.A Punjab FC insider revealed the players are due to report back for training on November 14. Mumbai City FC, meanwhile, confirmed that it is ""business as usual for now.""FC Goa players and staff are also due to return on November 14, a club official confirmed. Before the AIFF Super Cup semi-final, they will take on Iraq's Al Zawraa SC in the AFC Champions League Two on November 26.So, they will focus on the continental tournament ""independent of what is happening in Indian football.""Beyond the three teams that have stopped operations, Chennaiyin FC have told their players they're unsure of when the training will resume; NorthEast United have given players an extended break and Odisha FC are yet to get their pre-season underway.The period of uncertainty has been brought on since AIFF's tender to sell the commercial rights of the Indian Super League (ISL) found no bidders. The deadline to bid for the rights came once (November 5) and then again but eventually saw no interest by 5 pm on November 7.On Sunday, the bid evaluation committee comprising AIFF president Kalyan Chaubey, former SC Justice L. Nageswara Rao and Asian Football Confederation's (AFC) Kesvaran Murugasu met and stated their response will be submitted in the Supreme Court as part of the process.The unprecedent situation has been brought on with Football Sports Development Limited (FSDL) and AIFF not extending their agreement that ends on December 8. When the football federation put the tender publicly, four bidders showed initial interest, before pulling out as request for proposal (RFP) wasn't considered to be ""commercially viable.""Meanwhile, with the season in serious threat and their livelihoods on the line, the players came together as one.“To put it simply,” said the players in a statement that was later shared on social media, “we want to play, and now.”“This is a plea to all those involved in running our sport in the country, to do whatever it takes to get the football season underway,” the statement read.“India needs its competitive football now more than ever. As for us, we remain committed, professional and ready to walk out of that tunnel and onto the pitch the moment we're told we can. All we ask of those running our beautiful game, to match our desperation with honest intent. We've found ourselves in a very dark tunnel for long. We could do with a little light.”The statement was shared by some of Indian football's biggest names - Sunil Chhetri, Sandesh Jhingan, Gurpreet Singh Sandhu, Rahul Bheke, Lallianzuala Chhangte.

WATCH:

A quiet evening stroll turned into an unforgettable moment for a couple in Barcelona when football legend Lionel Messi unexpectedly walked into the frame of their romantic video. The clip, showing Messi casually photo-bombing the couple mid-dance, has taken social media by storm.In the viral video, the couple can be seen dancing affectionately along a picturesque Barcelona street, when the woman suddenly spots Messi walking behind them with his entourage. Stunned, the two immediately stop, exchanging looks of disbelief as the Argentine superstar passes by.The sighting came just hours after Messi made a surprise visit to Camp Nou on Sunday night, his first appearance at his former home since leaving FC Barcelona in 2021. The 38-year-old Inter Miami captain shared emotional posts from the visit, sparking speculation among fans about a possible future reunion with his boyhood club.“Last night I returned to a place I miss with my soul. A place where I was immensely happy, where you guys made me feel a thousand times the happiest person in the world. I hope one day I can come back — not just to say goodbye as a player, as I never got to,” Messi wrote on Instagram.Messi, who recently led Inter Miami to a 4-0 victory over Nashville in the MLS Cup Playoffs, continues to add milestones to his career, notching his 400th career assist during the match.Barcelona, meanwhile, have resumed limited training at Camp Nou amid renovations. For fans, Messi’s unannounced return — and his viral walk through the city streets — felt like a nostalgic reminder that the heart of Barcelona still beats in sync with its most iconic son.","Lionel Messi unexpectedly walks into the frame of a couple's romantic video.

Manchester City marked Pep Guardiola’s 1,000th game as a manager in style, cruising to a 3-0 victory over Liverpool to reignite their Premier League title charge on Sunday.

They all performed to the highest level,"" Guardiola said.""Proud to do it here in Manchester in front of my family, especially against Liverpool. I have a huge respect for that club.""City's seventh win in their last eight games in all competitions was a major blow to Liverpool's hopes of retaining the title.The troubled champions have lost seven of their last 10 matches in all competitions and trail Arsenal by eight points.They are marooned in eighth place after the momentum from successive wins over Aston Villa and Real Madrid dissipated into the rainy Manchester air.""We struggled a lot in the first half.

Former Commanders cheerleader defends Trump after NFL crowd boos



More NFL coverage

It wasn’t just football that took center stage this past Sunday -- it was politics colliding with America’s favorite sport. When President Donald Trump appeared at the Detroit Lions vs. Washington Commanders game, the crowd’s reaction said as much about the nation’s divide as the scoreboard did. Cameras panned to Trump in the stands, and a mix of cheers and jeers rippled through the stadium, creating a moment that instantly went viral.Trump’s attendance wasn’t just symbolic -- it was historic. For the first time since 1978, a sitting president showed up to watch an NFL regular-season game, joining the likes of Richard Nixon and Jimmy Carter. Before kickoff, Commanders president Mark Clouse welcomed him, saying, “We are honored to welcome President Trump to the game as we celebrate those who have served and continue to serve our country.” But the warm words were soon met with a divided crowd, setting the tone for one of the most talked-about NFL moments of the year.Former Washington Commanders cheerleader Jillian Anderson stepped in to defend Trump, calling out what she described as the city’s entrenched political bias.“I lived in D.C. for 13 years. When I was younger, I kept a lot of my political beliefs to myself because the area is aggressively liberal and at the time, I was more concerned about confrontation,” she told Fox News Digital. “Honestly, I’m not surprised parts of the crowd booed him. That’s the same city that has repeatedly elected Mayor Bowser, they clearly don’t know what’s good for them.”Anderson’s comments didn’t stop there. She also applauded Detroit Lions wide receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown for his touchdown celebration known as the “Trump Dance,” saying it reflected the spirit of working-class America. “I’m from a blue-collar town in the Midwest, and I relate way more to the Detroit Lions player doing the Trump dance. The past 10 months of accomplishments while Trump has been in office have been historic – he just keeps winning for America. I think the majority of the country agrees, and that liberal crowd isn’t reflective of that.”Trump’s surprise NFL visit may have divided opinions, but one thing is certain -- it reignited the ongoing clash between sports, politics, and public sentiment in America.","President Donald Trump appeared at the Detroit Lions vs. Washington Commanders game.

Charlotte Jones, the daughter of Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, has stepped into a storm of controversy after defending the NFL’s decision to have Bad Bunny headline the Super Bowl LX halftime show. The choice of the Puerto Rican superstar has divided fans, with many MAGA supporters criticizing the move and calling it a political statement. Still, Jones remains confident that the performance will be a celebration of culture, not a battleground of ideologies.Speaking on The Katie Miller Podcast, Jones praised the inclusion of Bad Bunny, emphasizing the NFL’s global audience and diverse fan base. “I think our Latina fan base is amazing. And I think when you think about the Super Bowl, you want the No. 1 performer in the world to be there,” she said. “We’re on a global stage and we can’t ever forget that. Our game goes out to everybody around the world and to get the premier entertainer to want to be a part of our game, I think is amazing. We have a mixed culture.”Jones’ remarks come amid growing backlash from conservative voices who have criticized Bad Bunny’s outspoken stance against Donald Trump’s immigration policies and his preference for performing in Spanish.Some detractors, including House Speaker Mike Johnson, even suggested replacing him with country artists like George Strait or Lee Greenwood. A petition circulated online claimed that Bad Bunny’s “drag performances and style are the opposite of what families expect on football’s biggest stage. ”But Jones sees things differently. “Our whole society is based on immigrants that came here and founded our country. I think we can celebrate that. I think the show’s going to be amazing,” she explained, underscoring the NFL’s role in reflecting America’s multicultural identity.Addressing the criticism that the halftime show carries political overtones, Jones added, “I don’t think our game’s about politics. I don’t think people tune in to look at politics. We do everything we can to avoid politics. I think in that moment people will be watching the game, they’ll be celebrating music and nobody will be thinking about what comments on the left side, what comments on the right side. This is about bringing people together. ”Her view aligns closely with NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, who recently defended the choice. “He’s one of the leading and most popular in the world. That’s what we try to achieve,” Goodell said, describing Bad Bunny’s selection as a “united moment” for fans worldwide.Despite the outrage, both Jones and Goodell seem confident that when the lights dim in Santa Clara, the performance will transcend politics – turning the Super Bowl stage into a true celebration of music, culture, and unity.","Charlotte Jones, the daughter of Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, has defended the NFL’s decision to have Bad Bunny headline the Super Bowl LX halftime show.

Kayla Nicole says her Halloween look wasn’t a ‘diss’ at Travis Kelce or Taylor Swift

Kayla Nicole isn’t holding back anymore. After sparking a wave of speculation with her bold Halloween costume, the media personality and model finally addressed whether her look was a hidden jab at her ex-boyfriend, NFL star Travis Kelce , and his fiancée, global pop sensation Taylor Swift. Fans had been buzzing since Nicole recreated Toni Braxton’s iconic look from the “He Wasn’t Man Enough” music video, interpreting it as a subtle dig aimed at her former relationship. But according to Nicole, her intention had nothing to do with her ex, or Swift.The timing of her statement was crucial. Nicole and Kelce’s high-profile on-and-off relationship between 2017 and 2022 had long kept her in the spotlight. Their breakup, which Nicole once described as emotionally draining, was made even harder by public scrutiny. She later opened up about it on Special Forces: World’s Toughest Test, breaking down over the experience but emerging stronger--eventually becoming one of the winners of the grueling reality competition.When Nicole appeared on her podcast, The Pre-Game with Kayla Nicole, she made it clear that her Halloween costume was all about self-expression and cultural appreciation.“I feel like Halloween is an opportunity for you to let your creative flag fly. As someone who grew up in a black Christian household who wasn't allowed to celebrate Halloween for real unless she was going to the church trunk holiday party and I could dress up as like an angel or a fish, I wasn't really able to creatively live my best life on Halloween growing up.Now with this big old age, I'm going to do what I want. I'm going to show a little skin and I'm going to shake a little a**. And that's what happened this Halloween, honestly, like as with anything, I think that people will try to project their own narratives, right? But for me personally, I am, and I think it's very important to say this in this moment, I am not in the business of tearing other women down. I'm in the business of celebrating them. And for me, this moment was about celebrating an icon in my culture.*”Her words left little room for misunderstanding. Kayla Nicole’s Halloween look wasn’t a dig--it was a celebration. For her, it was never about Kelce or Swift, but about confidence, freedom, and honoring a music legend who inspired generations.","Kayla Nicole says her Halloween look wasn’t a ‘diss’ at Travis Kelce or Taylor Swift.

Carolina Panthers RB Rico Dowdle Week 11 status remains uncertain



More coverage in NFL:

The Carolina Panthers are managing a key injury situation at running back, as Rico Dowdle was once again listed on the injury report with a quadriceps issue. Dowdle, who has delivered a career-best performance this season, missed Wednesday’s practice due to the injury, according to ESPN’s David Newton. His status will be closely monitored throughout the week ahead of Sunday’s game.Dowdle’s recent workload has been heavy, which makes quadriceps maintenance a priority for the Panthers’ coaching staff. Last week, he followed a similar routine, missing Wednesday practice, completing a limited session on Thursday, and participating fully on Friday. While this pattern is likely precautionary, it signals that his availability should be tracked closely before Week 11.As of now, Dowdle is expected to play in Week 11 unless he misses Thursday practice, which would raise concerns. If sidelined, backup Chuba Hubbard would assume the lead role. Hubbard, initially Carolina’s starter, would take on an expanded workload against the Atlanta Falcons, who allow the fourth-most fantasy points per game to running backs, making the matchup favorable for a substitute. Carolina’s offensive game plan could shift to emphasize Hubbard’s skills in the running game, increasing his touches and scoring opportunities.If Dowdle is active, he remains a high-value RB1. He currently ranks as RB10 overall, an impressive achievement given he was not a starter at the beginning of the season. Over the last five weeks, he ranks as RB4 overall, even with two weeks splitting workload with Hubbard. His consistent production underscores his importance to the Panthers’ rushing game and overall offensive efficiency. Dowdle’s ability to consistently gain yards after contact and contribute in passing situations adds a layer of versatility that is crucial for Carolina’s game scripts.Tracking Dowdle’s participation in Wednesday and Thursday practices will provide the clearest indication of his Week 11 availability. Any change in his status could affect rushing opportunities and team game plans, making this injury a key storyline for the Panthers’ backfield heading into Sunday’s matchup. With Dowdle leading the backfield, Carolina’s ground game has been one of the most productive in recent weeks, and his presence or absence could significantly influence the outcome of the game.","Carolina Panthers running back Rico Dowdle was once again listed on the injury report with a quadriceps issue.

Jason Williams makes bold claim about Megan Thee Stallion and Klay Thompson



What is going on with Klay Thompson?

Klay Thompson and Megan Thee Stallion’s relationship under spotlight



It’s been a tough stretch for Klay Thompson on the court, and now his personal life is drawing unwanted attention. Former NBA guard Jason Williams, known to fans as “White Chocolate,” has offered a bold and controversial take on the Dallas Mavericks star’s ongoing struggles. Rather than pointing to age, injuries, or fit within the Mavericks’ system, Williams suggested that Thompson’s relationship with rapper Megan Thee Stallion might be contributing to his decline.The four-time NBA champion has struggled to find rhythm this season, shooting a career-low 31.4 percent from the field and 26.7 percent from deep. His numbers have prompted head coach Jason Kidd to reduce his minutes, handing more time to veteran D’Angelo Russell. Now, Williams’ theory has added a layer of public scrutiny to an already turbulent season.During an appearance on the Hoopin’ N Hollerin’ podcast, Jason Williams delivered a comment that immediately set social media on fire. “I’m from West Virginia, man, I’ve been taught a lot from old folks, old white folks. It only takes one p**** to drag a battleship across the desert. That’s how powerful it is,” Williams said. He followed it with, “Klay Thompson, I ain’t sayin’ that’s what it is, but that might be what it is. ”The remarks have sparked mixed reactions from fans. Still, the comment has since been the center of discussion, especially as Thompson and Megan Thee Stallion’s relationship has been one of the most talked-about celebrity pairings of the year.Klay Thompson, 35, and Megan Thee Stallion, whose real name is Megan Jovon Ruth Pete, made their relationship public over the summer. The rapper recently dedicated her hit single “Lover Girl” to Thompson, and a viral Instagram post hinted that the two might be living together. While the couple appears happy off the court, Thompson’s slump has given critics a reason to link his love life with his performance.Despite the noise, Thompson’s supporters believe his struggles have more to do with age and injuries than romance. Having battled both a torn ACL and a ruptured Achilles, his decline may simply be part of a natural career arc.Also Read: Klay Thompson’s girlfriend Megan Thee Stallion gets positive court update as Tory Lanez’s appeal dismissed in shooting case","Former NBA guard Jason Williams suggests Klay Thompson's relationship with rapper Megan Thee Stallion might be contributing to his decline.

Josh Giddey’s ankle setback leaves Chicago Bulls’ bright start hanging in the balance

The Chicago Bulls' star guard Josh Giddey has been put on the injury list as not participating while he recovers from a right ankle injury. This made him a doubtful player for the game against Detroit Pistons on Wednesday night. The final call on his status will be made by the team just before the Detroit Little Caesars Arena tip-off.When the Chicago Bulls faced off against Victor Wembanyama and the San Antonio Spurs on Monday night, they were already one key rotation player short. The absentees now included Josh Giddey who joined Zach Collins and Coby White on the injury list.Both the team and head coach Billy Donovan revealed that Giddey had a sprained right ankle. Before tip-off, he was finally declared out after being labelled as questionable.This week, head coach Donovan told reporters that Giddey will miss more than a ""couple of games."" The 22-year-old was absent in the Chicago Bulls' loss to the San Antonio Spurs and the team record stands at 6-4. His status remains unknown for tonight.The damage inflicted upon Giddey was the result of De'Andre Hunter's action, who almost snapped Giddey's ankle during the game with Cleveland on Saturday.Giddey was unsuccessful with all his six attempts in the first quarter, and it was pretty obvious that he was trying to keep the injured ankle light for the rest of the night.Giddy then said about Hunter after the game:“I was kinda on my tippy-toes, so it was the weak point of your ankle. As he made the cross-over, I was up on my tippy-toe and tried to change direction, and my ankle just kinda rolled a little bit...""However, he later went back and played on, suffering the injury. Coach Donovan characterized the injury as ""mild,"" meaning that the swollen area was not large at all and that the player had been recovering all along.Doubts are being increased by injury problems. Meanwhile, in the aftermath of the 128-122 loss, the Bulls will have to play at least a game without one of their primary players. Now that the Bulls are left to play Wemby alone, the 23-year-old is tending to his ankle. Nevertheless, Giddey had a great start prior to the injury, averaging 21.4 points, 9.6 rebounds, and 9.3 assists per game.He is a vital part of Chicago's offensive rhythm and transition game, shooting 46.3% from the field and 38.5% from three. He is one of the Bulls' early-season MVPs because of his passing and rebounding, which have improved the team's fast-paced style. However, now they will be without him, possibly for a while.Also read: Josh Giddey’s moment in the spotlight takes a surprising turn after a commentator’s unexpected slip-up",The Chicago Bulls' star guard Josh Giddey has been put on the injury list as not participating while he recovers from a right ankle injury.

Nico Harrison’s quiet Instagram update hints at a new chapter after sudden Dallas Mavericks exit

Nico Harrison, the former general manager of the Dallas Mavericks, left the team with 71 games left in the regular season. The team's disappointing start to the season was the primary cause of this. It all began last year when Harrison decided on the spur of the moment to deal Luka Doncic for Anthony Davis.In an open letter to fans on Tuesday, Dallas Mavericks owner Patrick Dumont discussed his decision to remove general manager Nico Harrison. However, now Harrison has already let the world know he is unemployed in his Instagram bio just hours after being fired as general manager of the Dallas Mavericks.In the midst of the Mavericks' terrible 3-8 start to the season, the 52-year-old was fired on Tuesday. He had been under intense criticism ever since Dallas sold star Luka Doncic to the LA Lakers earlier this year.Recently, owner Patrick Dumont acknowledged that he was fired, stating that the decision was ""critical to moving our franchise forward in a positive direction."" Harrison's dismissal was immediately followed by a statement from Dumont explaining his decision. He said:“No one associated with the Mavericks organization is happy with the start of what we all believed would be a promising season.You have high expectations for the Mavericks, and I share them with you. When the results don’t meet expectations, it’s my responsibility to act..”Dumont further said:“Though the majority of the 2025-26 season remains to be played, and I know our players are deeply committed to a winning culture, this decision was critical to moving our franchise forward in a positive direction.. I understand the profound impact these last several difficult months have had. Please know that I’m fully committed to the success of the Mavericks.”On the very same day his firing was announced by Dallas, fans spotted that Harrison wasted no time in letting the world know about his current status.

Thewill once again be without their biggest star, asagainst the Oklahoma City Thunder. The 40-year-old forward continues to recover from a lingering sciatica injury that has kept him out since training camp. Despite early hopes of a mid-November return, the team has confirmed that James will not suit up for the contest as he continues his rehabilitation process.The Lakers have been cautious in managing James’ condition, prioritizing his long-term health over short-term gains. His absence has certainly been felt on the court, but the team has managed to stay competitive, showcasing strong depth and leadership even without their 21-time All-Star. Fans remain optimistic that his return is near, as encouraging updates from the Lakers’ camp suggest steady progress in his recovery journey.LeBron James has been dealing with a right-side sciatica issue since the start of training camp, which forced him to miss both the preseason and the opening stretch of the regular season. The Lakers have maintained a conservative approach to his recovery, focusing on gradual conditioning and controlled workouts to ensure that he avoids any setbacks.Recently, James took a major step forward in his rehabilitation by practicing with the South Bay Lakers, the franchise’s NBA G League affiliate. This move marks a historic first in his 22-year NBA career, as he joined G League practices to regain game rhythm and conditioning. Reports indicate that he has participated in full-contact practices and five-on-five scrimmages - a significant sign that he is nearing a return to full basketball activity. However, team officials have clarified that his participation in G League sessions does not yet mean he is ready to rejoin the Lakers lineup.Initial projections hinted that James might return by mid-November, but the most recent updates suggest his comeback will likely occur after the Lakers’ current five-game road trip. The team is targeting a potential return date around November 18, when they host the Utah Jazz at Crypto.com Arena. The Lakers’ medical staff continues to monitor his progress closely, with optimism that James will make his long-awaited season debut soon.Despite LeBron James’ absence, the Los Angeles Lakers have opened the 2025–26 NBA season with an impressive 8–3 record. Much of that success has come from the leadership and production of Luka Dončić and Austin Reaves, who have stepped up to fill the void. The team’s chemistry has remained strong, but there’s no doubt that the return of “The King” will elevate their performance, particularly in late-game execution and offensive flow.For tonight’s game against the Oklahoma City Thunder, LeBron James is officially listed as out due to his ongoing back injury recovery. The Lakers will once again rely on their depth and balanced scoring approach to stay competitive. The organization remains steadfast in its long-term plan, emphasizing that LeBron James’ health and readiness for the remainder of the season take priority over any single game.Also read: Los Angeles Lakers vs Oklahoma City Thunder regular season game: Full injury report, who’s out, and more (November 12, 2025) While fans will have to wait a little longer to see James back on the court, the steady progress in his rehab offers reassurance that his return is imminent - and when it happens, it could provide the spark the Lakers need for another deep playoff run.","LeBron James remains sidelined for tonight’s matchup against the Oklahoma City Thunder.

The upcoming November 12, 2025, regular-season matchup between thewill carry immense importance as both teams enter with strong records but face significant injury setbacks. The game promises a battle between two of the Western Conference’s top contenders and will showcase how both franchises adjust under pressure. With the Lakers set to miss LeBron James and the Thunder dealing with a long list of unavailable players, the contest is shaping up to be as much about strategic adaptability as it is about on-court execution.Fans and analysts alike are eager to see how these absences will influence the outcome. The Lakers, known for their veteran leadership and offensive rhythm, will have to rely on depth and discipline. Meanwhile, the Thunder, who enter the night boasting one of the best defensive records in the NBA, will face the daunting task of maintaining their dominance despite losing several key contributors.The Lakers are expected to be hit hard on the injury front, with three critical absences impacting their rotation.LeBron James has been ruled out due to right sciatica, depriving the team of its primary scorer, playmaker, and leader. His absence will leave a huge void in both offensive coordination and defensive stability. Additionally, guard Gabe Vincent is sidelined with an ankle injury, further thinning the Lakers’ backcourt depth. Promising forward Adou Thiero will also remain out as he continues recovery from knee surgery, keeping him off the floor and limiting the Lakers’ options for rotation and energy off the bench.The Oklahoma City Thunder will enter the game with an even more challenging injury report, missing several rotational and starting-caliber players. Kenrich Williams is expected to be unavailable due to a knee injury, while defensive stalwart Luguentz Dort will miss the contest with a shoulder issue. Aaron Wiggins is sidelined because of a thigh injury, and young standout Jalen Williams has been ruled out with a wrist problem. To make matters worse, Nikola Topic will be sidelined with illness, and Thomas Sorber remains out with a knee injury. These absences will force the Thunder to depend heavily on their remaining starters and less experienced bench players to sustain their performance, particularly on the defensive end.Heading into the game, Oklahoma City holds an impressive 10-1 record, while Los Angeles follows closely at 8-3. The absences mean both teams will need to adapt their game plans significantly. For the Lakers, the focus will shift toward Luka Dončić, who is expected to shoulder a greater offensive burden. Averaging 37.1 points per game, Dončić’s performance will be crucial in keeping the Lakers competitive. On the Thunder’s side, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander’s all-around excellence will become even more vital, as he leads the team in points, rebounds, and assists this season.Despite the injury challenges, anticipation for the game remains sky-high. The matchup will be broadcast live with in-depth pre-game coverage, betting odds, and predictions, emphasizing how roster health can influence NBA outcomes. Fans will tune in to see which team rises above adversity and which bench players seize the opportunity to shine.In the end, the November 12, 2025, game between the Los Angeles Lakers and Oklahoma City Thunder is expected to stand as a testament to depth, adaptability, and resilience.

LeBron James nears long-awaited return as fresh update sparks hope in Los Angeles Lakers

LeBron James, a star forward for the Los Angeles Lakers, has been out since the beginning of the 2025–26 NBA season because of a sciatica-related back problem. He was absent for the whole preseason. The Los Angeles Lakers star will also have to start the regular season on the bench due to the injury.Fortunately, though, he has now been cleared for full team practice, which is a significant step towards his season debut. The 40-year-old has been progressively increasing his workload, taking part in individual drills and light shooting sessions before being given the all-clear to participate in group activities, according to team officials.At first, it was anticipated that James, 40, would not be able to play until mid-November. On November 10, the Lakers forward received a favorable update. James is scheduled to resume practice this week, according to head coach JJ Redick.The team is looking at mid-November as a potential return date, according to people close to the team, but that might change based on how his body reacts to contact play.He will begin his training with the South Bay Lakers, a Los Angeles G-League affiliate.The L.A. Lakers will return to Los Angeles for a home game against the Utah Jazz on November 18. They are currently one game into a five-game road trip.James' return will be handled cautiously, according to head coach JJ Redick. Redick said earlier this week:""He's putting in the work every day… We're not rushing anything, but he looks really good.""The first step for the future Hall of Famer to participate in a game is going back to practice. As James resumes practice and keeps an eye out for any setbacks associated with his sciatica, he will probably go through a gradual ramp-up period.At first, it was anticipated that James would be off for three to four weeks. He was anticipated to miss at least four or five games due to the timing of the injury. The top forward has missed 11 games so far.Since the preseason, James has struggled with sciatica discomfort, which has prevented him from playing in the Lakers' first 11 games of the 2025–26 season as well as the whole exhibition schedule. The organization decided to take a careful approach in order to protect his long-term health, despite early estimates that he might return in a few weeks.His greatest chance of returning will be after the Lakers have played 14 games if he doesn't accompany the team on this road trip. However, it might go longer if James encounters any difficulties as he increases his practice involvement.The Lakers have started the season competitively despite losing their captain, thanks to the attacking prowess of Anthony Davis and Austin Reaves.Also read: Is LeBron James playing tonight?

Unexpected twist shakes Bradley Beal’s fresh journey with the Los Angeles Clippers amid a challenging start

The Los Angeles Clippers had a really great beginning of the season. However, now, their star player, Bradley Beal is out due to a problem related to his left hip. The injury is believed to have occurred while Beal was taking a charge during Thursday's 115-102 loss at Phoenix. He played in Saturday's home loss against the Suns and tied a season high in 20 minutes with 12 points.However, now, his season probably ended as he will not play against the Denver Nuggets either.Due to a left hip injury, Beal was ruled out of Monday's game against the Atlanta Hawks and is anticipated to miss several games, according to coach Tyronn Lue. In order to cure the problem, Beal , who was marked as doubtful on the injury report, will now reportedly go through a surgery.According to the Clippers' injury report, Bradley Beal is ""OUT"" for Wednesday night's game against the Nuggets. Beal was labelled as ""QUESTIONABLE"" to play on Sunday night before being ruled out.Insiders claim that Beal was injured on a defensive play during the Clippers' home opener against the Phoenix Suns on Friday night. They further said:“He took that charge and it kind of gave him some back spasms.”He averages 5.5 points per 20 minutes while shooting 25% from outside the arc and 45% from the field.The Clippers are hopeful that Beal's performance won't be hampered for too long by this most recent setback.Coach Tyronn Lue selected big John Collins over guard Bogdan Bogdanovic to replace Beal in the starting lineup on Monday. Defending his choice, he said:“We’ve been struggling rebounding the basketball and career, statistically, (Collins) has been a really good rebounder.. Just put him alongside (Ivica Zubac) to be able to rebound the basketball… We need to be bigger. We were small with (Beal).”The veteran guard has played just 196 of 328 regular-season games since the 2021–2022 season due to tons of injuries. In six games this season, his first in Los Angeles, Beal has averaged career lows of 8.2 points and 1.7 rebounds.Beal's health issues have become worse at age 32, making his debut season with the Clippers difficult. He has averaged 21.4 points and 4.3 assists in 807 games (758 starts) during 14 NBA seasons with the Washington Wizards (2012–23), Phoenix Suns (2023–25), and Los Angeles Clippers.Also read: Bradley Beal’s sudden setback casts an early shadow over the Los Angeles Clippers’ promising start",Bradley Beal was ruled out of Monday's game against the Atlanta Hawks due to a left hip injury.

Memphis Grizzlies’ Injury Status vs the Boston Celtics (November 12, 2025)

Morant’s Recent Performance and Team Adjustments

What to Expect Against the Celtics

Ja Morant’s status for the Memphis Grizzlies’ upcoming matchup against the Boston Celtics on November 12, 2025, remains uncertain as he continues to manage right ankle soreness. The star guard is officially listed as questionable, and while the issue isn’t considered serious, it has raised some concern within the organization. Morant has dealt with similar minor setbacks in the past, often choosing to play through discomfort when possible, but the team’s medical staff will determine his availability closer to tipoff.The Memphis Grizzlies, already battling through a string of injuries, find themselves in a tough spot as they take on a strong Celtics team. Morant’s presence could be the difference between a competitive contest and another frustrating loss, given his leadership and ability to energize his teammates. His potential absence would leave Memphis shorthanded once again, forcing the coaching staff to rely heavily on their bench rotation.Ja Morant has been dealing with right ankle soreness leading into the game, which prompted his “questionable” status on the latest injury report.Team officials remain optimistic, noting that the soreness does not appear to be severe. The decision on whether he’ll play will depend on how he responds during pregame warm-ups. Throughout his career, Morant has shown a strong will to compete even when less than 100%, often pushing through minor injuries to help his team stay afloat.While the current issue may not sideline him long-term, it comes at an inconvenient time. The Grizzlies are struggling to establish rhythm early in the season, and Ja Morant’s availability has a direct impact on their offensive flow and overall morale.Memphis Grizzlies continues to navigate a brutal stretch of injuries that have severely limited their depth. The team is without several key contributors, including Zach Edey, Ty Jerome, Brandon Clarke, and Scotty Pippen Jr. Clarke, in particular, remains sidelined following knee surgery for synovitis and is expected to miss six to nine weeks. These absences have forced head coach Taylor Jenkins to make frequent lineup adjustments and rely on younger, less experienced players to fill crucial roles.The combination of injuries and inconsistent performances has hindered the Memphis Grizzlies’ early-season progress, putting more pressure on Morant to carry the load whenever he’s healthy enough to play.Despite battling injuries and inconsistency, Ja Morant remains central to Memphis’ offense. He is currently averaging around 18.9 points and 8.1 assists per game but has struggled with efficiency, shooting a career-low 35.8% from the field. Turnovers have also been an issue, particularly in recent games, though his playmaking ability continues to be a vital asset.To counter these challenges, the coaching staff has focused on increasing pick-and-roll actions and spacing the floor to create easier scoring chances for Morant and his teammates. His availability against Boston will be crucial, especially with the Celtics known for their physical and disciplined defense.The Memphis Grizzlies enter the contest with a 4-8 record, while the Celtics sit at 5-7. Both teams have faced early-season adversity and are looking for momentum. If Ja Morant suits up, he’ll likely assume a heavy offensive workload, driving the pace and attacking Boston’s defense. However, if his ankle limits his movement, Memphis will need to rely more on secondary scorers and strong defensive effort to keep the game close.","Ja Morant’s status for the Memphis Grizzlies’ upcoming matchup against the Boston Celtics on November 12, 2025, remains uncertain as he continues to manage right ankle soreness.

What to Expect Tonight from the Golden State Warriors vs San Antonio Spurs Game

Thecould receive a much-needed boost tonight as. After missing three games due to illness, the two-time MVP made his return on November 11, 2025, against the Oklahoma City Thunder. Although he struggled to regain his rhythm in that outing, Curry expressed optimism about being available for tonight’s clash, saying, “I’m trying to, yes. ” His presence provides hope for a Warriors team that has been inconsistent early in the season.However, Golden State plans to approach Curry’s usage with caution. The star guard is likely to be on a minutes restriction as the team looks to ease him back into form following his recent illness. The Golden State Warriors’ medical and coaching staff are emphasizing a gradual recovery process to ensure he doesn’t suffer any setbacks. Even with limited minutes, Curry’s leadership and shooting threat could prove vital against a surging Spurs squad.Stephen Curry had been sidelined for three consecutive games due to what was described as a lingering cold. His absence was felt deeply as the Warriors struggled offensively without their primary playmaker.When he returned to the lineup against the Thunder on November 11, he logged just 20 minutes, scoring 11 points on 4-of-13 shooting, including 1-of-5 from beyond the arc. Though his performance was below his usual standards, it marked a positive step toward full recovery.Head coach Steve Kerr has made it clear that the team will continue to monitor Curry’s condition closely. “We want him back to 100 percent before increasing his workload,” Kerr emphasized earlier this week. The Warriors’ 126-102 loss to Oklahoma City underscored how dependent they are on Curry’s energy and offensive spark.Tonight’s matchup won’t be easy for Golden State Warriors. The Spurs come in with an impressive 8-2 record, fueled by the dominance of rising superstar Victor Wembanyama. Meanwhile, the Warriors sit at 6-6 and are dealing with multiple absences, including Draymond Green and De’Anthony Melton. With key contributors sidelined, Curry’s return - even on limited minutes - adds a much-needed offensive anchor.To balance rotations, the Warriors may lean on veterans like Jimmy Butler along with younger players to fill the scoring void and maintain pace against San Antonio. The team’s focus will be on protecting Stephen Curry from overexertion while still relying on his presence to lift morale and efficiency on the floor.Fans can expect Stephen Curry to play under a controlled workload, possibly around 20-25 minutes, depending on how he responds during the game. His performance will be crucial in setting the tone early against the Spurs’ aggressive defense. The Golden State Warriors will aim to bounce back from recent losses and regain momentum in the Western Conference standings.In summary, Stephen Curry’s expected return tonight offers renewed optimism for Golden State. Though his minutes will be managed carefully following his illness, his presence alone provides a spark of leadership and hope as the Warriors prepare to face a tough San Antonio Spurs team.","Stephen Curry is expected to play for the Golden State Warriors against the San Antonio Spurs.

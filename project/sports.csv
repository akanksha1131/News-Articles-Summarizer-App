The Indian women's cricket team achieved their biggest ODI victory by demolishing Ireland by an astonishing 304 runs in Rajkot on Wednesday, completing a 3-0 clean sweep. The match result was a foregone conclusion once India set a massive target of 436 runs for Ireland to chase.Ireland could only muster 131 runs before being bundled out in 31.4 overs. India's record-breaking performance was led by skipper Smriti Mandhana 's 70-ball century and her opening partner Pratika Rawal 's 154 runs off 129 balls, propelling the team to a total of 435/5, the highest by any Indian team in ODIs.Mandhana and Rawal's opening partnership of 233 runs in just 26.4 overs set the stage for an unstoppable Indian victory. Spinners Tanuja Kanwar and Deepti Sharma then took charge, sharing five wickets between them to decimate the inexperienced Irish lineup.Orla Prendergast and Sarah Forbes provided some resistance with a 64-run partnership for the third wicket, helping Ireland recover from 24/2 to 88. However, once Prendergast was dismissed by Kanwar, India dominated the tourists, claiming the remaining seven wickets for just 33 runs.This victory also surpassed India's previous largest margin of victory by runs, which was 249 against the same opposition in 2017 at Potchefstroom, South Africa. Mandhana's 10th ODI century came off just 70 deliveries, surpassing Harmanpreet Kaur 's 87-ball hundred against South Africa last year.India joined Australia and New Zealand in the elite list of teams that have breached the 400-run mark in ODIs. Mandhana's destructive batting included aerial shots over the 'V' and clearing the 30-yard circle, while Pratika complemented her captain brilliantly with a measured knock, notching her maiden international century in her sixth innings.Their 233-run partnership made them only the fourth Indian pair to record a 200-run stand in Women's ODIs and the third instance of both Indian openers scoring hundreds in ODIs. The duo maintained a brisk scoring rate throughout their partnership, adding 90 runs during the Power Play and 67 in the subsequent 10 overs.Mandhana reached her first century of the calendar year with an exquisite drive off Arlene Kelly, who bore the brunt of her onslaught. Even Kelly's variations were dispatched with ease, with Mandhana following a six with another boundary in the 24th over.Mandhana also took on Ireland's leading bowler, Prendergast, smashing her for a boundary down the ground and a towering six over long-on. Promoted to No. 3, Richa Ghosh also returned to form, making a 37-ball fifty, her fifth in ODIs.","India beat Ireland by 304 runs to complete 3-0 ODI clean sweep.

MUMBAI: In a magnanimous gesture, the Mumbai Cricket Association , on the occasion of Wankhede Stadium's 50th anniversary, on Wednesday rewarded the eight surviving members of the Mumbai team which played the first-ever first-class match at the iconic venue, back in 1974 (Nov 17-19) against Baroda, with Rs 10 lakhs each.The eight surviving members of that Ashok Mankad-captained team are cricket legend Sunil Gavaskar , Farokh Engineer, Karsan Ghavri , Ajit Pai, Padmalkar Shivalkar, Milind Rege, Abdul Ismail and Rakesh Tandon. Five of the players of that team-Ghavri, Pai, Shivalkar, who arrived for the function on a wheelchair, Rege, Ismail and Tandon were present on the occasion received their cheques from MCA.Also See: 2025 Champions Trophy A domestic giant in those days, a star-studded Mumbai team, which included as many as seven Test players in Gavaskar, Sudhir Naik, Engineer (wicketkeeper), Ghavri, Mankad, Eknath Solkar and Ajit Pai, and domestic stalwarts like Padmalkar Shivalkar, Rege, Ismail and Tandon had trounced Baroda, who only had only Anshuman Gaekwad as an India player, by an innings & 96 runs on that occasion.Powered by half-centuries by Ghavri (83), Rege (63) and Engineer (51), and 48 by Solkar, Mumbai scored 348.

There cannot be a bigger reward than this. We appreciate this gesture with all our heart,"" Ghavri, 73, told reporters.In the morning, the MCA organized a felicitation function where it honoured almost 200 groundsmen of Mumbai, including three of its curators-Ramesh Mamunkar, Nadeem Menon and Madhukar Botle at the Wankhede Stadium.

She missed the season-opener Malaysia Open Super 1000 in Kuala Lumpur last week. It was evident during the match that Sindhu was a bit rusty. There were several unforced errors during the second game. At one point, she was getting quite frustrated as Sung built a healthy 11-4 lead. Sindhu took a little break and had a courtside chat with her new coach Irwansyah Adi Pratama, a renowned Indonesian coach who is now in charge of the Indian women’s singles players.""The chat was mostly about hitting my strokes deep and making better use of the court. She (Sung) was able to dictate terms without moving much, and I had to break that rhythm of hers,"" Sindhu, who will now face Japan’s Manami Suizu in the second round, said.Soon after the chat, Sindhu changed the tempo and started hitting powerful ground strokes which caught Sung off guard.

NEW DELHI: It was a day of heartbreaks for quite a few Indian shuttlers, and the fans, at the KD Jadhav Indoor Stadium here on Wednesday. Despite the loudest cheers and unequivocal backing from the spectators, some of the top names of Indian badminton suffered shocking first-round exits from the India Open Super 750 tournament.Paris Olympics semifinalist Lakshya Sen crashed out of the men’s singles event after a 21-15, 21-10 loss against Lin Chun-Yi of Chinese Taipei. Lakshya, 12th in the world rankings, lost to world No. 15 Lin in just 37 minutes. World No. 26 HS Prannoy fought for an hour and 13 minutes, but couldn’t prevent a 21-16, 18-21, 12-21 loss to Su Li Yang of Chinese Taipei.This was Prannoy’s second loss in as many matches against Su Li Yang, having previously come up short at the All England Open last year. Prannoy started the match on a positive note and hit some delectable winners much to the de -light of the Indian fans. But Su came back in the second game, forcing some un -forced errors from Prannoy at crucial junctures.In the final game, Prannoy looked clearly tired as Su wrapped up the match in a jiffy. Youngster Priyanshu Rajawat battled valiantly and even saved a match point in the second game before going down fighting 16-21, 22-20, 13-21 against sixth seed Kodai Naraoka of Japan.Rajawat employed big jump smashes to keep pace with Naroaka, making the Japanese work hard for every point, but Naraoka’s experience counted in the end.Another young gun, Malvika Bansod, played her heart out against China’s Han Yue, the third seed. Malvika managed to eke out the first game from Han, but the Chinese upped the ante in the next two to win 20-22, 21-16, 21-11.In an all-Indian clash between two Gopichand Academy trainees, Anupama Upadhyaya and Rakshita Sree, the former prevailed 21-17, 21-18 in 43 minutes. The match turned out to be a battle of wits between two good friends with experience triumphing over youth. Anupama, a former national champion, will now face Japanese sixth seed Tomaka Miyazaki in the second round.“This is my first time playing in the India Open Super 750 level. Last year, I was just watching all of them play. Before this, I had played in the Super 500 but the standard at this level is different. Last year, I played my first 750 in China and last week also played the Malaysia Super 1000. These performances help me believe that I can be their equal. I have the speed and compatibility to compete against the top players,” Anupama said after her win.Among the foreign stars, Olympic champion Viktor Axelsen fought back from a game down to beat Chi Yu Jen of Chinese Taipei 16-21, 21-11, 21-13 in a men’s singles first round match, while fellow Paris Olympics champion An Se Young of South Korea defeated Chiu Pin-Chian of Chinese Taipei 22-20, 21-15 in the women’s singles first round.Also advancing to the next round were seventh seeded women’s doubles combination of Ashwini Ponnappa and Tanisha Crasto, Rutuparna Panda and Swetaparna Panda and the mixed doubles combination of Ashith Surya and Amruta Pramuthesh.Ashwini and Tanisha defeated com -patriots Kavya Gupta and Radhika Sharma 21-11, 21-12, while the Panda sisters got the better of the young Thai combination of Phattarin Aiamvarees -risakul and Sarisa Janpeng 7-21, 21-19, 21-14.

GRV

recalls his famous 97 at Madras that gave India a 100-run win over the West Indies

I don't think I've ever seen a batsman who could deceive the point fielder. He was such a brilliant player off the toe, there are very few people I've seen playing that stroke. In that match (in 1975), there was a lot of uneven bounce, and the batsmen were struggling. But not Vishy. He was playing like it was tennis ball cricket. EAS PRASANNA

He was such a brilliant stroke-maker. We played without helmets. Also, the wickets were not covered. He was a fearless and gifted batsman. BRIJESH PATEL

People in Chennai still talk about the 97 n.o by GRV in 1975. I think it is one of the most talked about subjects in cricket. It was a joy to watch him, and a dream come true to play alongside him. ROGER BINNY

Whenever Vishy bhai scored runs they were match-defining innings and India won those games. I grew up listening to my uncle speaking about the repertoire of Vishy bhai's strokes. VVS LAXMAN

BENGALURU: Of the 6,080 runs that came off his blade, GR Vishwanath 's unbeaten 97 against the West Indies in Chennai (then Madras) on Jan 11, 1975, overshadows all else -- over his 14 centuries, and even his highest score, the 222 against England at the same venue in 1982.Such is the enduring impact of that innings that GRV, in his autobiography 'Wrist Assured', writes, ""Every time I go to Chennai, all I hear about is the 97 not out. Sometimes I feel that is the only worthwhile innings that I have played.""That innings, spread over 228 testing minutes, is testimony to GRV's greatness, an essay of immense grit. Wednesday marked the 50th anniversary of that famous 100-run victory over Clive Llyod's ferocious XI.Back in the day, Madras traditionally hosted a match in the second week of January, popularly labelled the Pongal Test. On Tuesday, those who played that match, along with cricketers from other generations came together to celebrate the landmark innings. The gathering was hosted by Vishwanath's family and on the main course was nostalgia. Those who joined were GRV's 1975 team-mates, BS Chandrasekhar, EAS Prasanna and former Karnataka team-mates Roger Binny and Brijesh Patel. VVS Laxman and Anil Kumble completed the glittering line-up.With his inimitable straight-faced humour, GRV regaled the audience with tales from the match, the era of facing ferocious pacers without the security of a helmet and the camaraderie in the Indian dressing room of a bygone era.It is folklore how the late Mansur Ali Khan Pataudi, whose eyesight was failing, decided to lead the team. His confidence stemmed from GRV's prowess with the willow and the ability of his spinners. GRV spoke on the contribution of India's spin trio - Bishan Singh Bedi, Prasanna and Chandrasekhar, Pataudi's acumen as captain, and the crucial 80 by Anshuman Gaekwad in the second essay.Opting to bat, India were in no time reduced to 76/6 with pace merchant Andy Roberts breathing fire. ""By the time I realized what was happening, I saw Karsan Ghavri (No. 8) at the crease,"" said GRV, ""I asked him, 'What's happening here?' He said most of them were back in the dressing room. I looked up at the scoreboard and saw the score was 76. I thought, 'Okay, it's time to play some shots.' I had already played a few and felt good. I decided to go ahead. It so happened that whatever I played, worked. I thought to myself, 'It looks like my day. So, I don't want to stop now.' In between two wickets fell.""At 169/9, the last men standing were GRV and Chandrasekar. For 38 minutes, the spinner had survived the pace onslaught of Roberts, Bernard Julien, Keith Boyce and Vanburn Holder and scored one run.On 96, GRV cut Roberts towards the boundary.""I thought the timing of my cut shot was brilliant. Boyce was in the third-man region, and I told myself, 'No chance will Boyce or his father stop the ball.' I was heading towards Chandra to thank him for his support when I saw the panicked look on his face and ball in Boyce's hand,"" remembered GRV.Chandra was left to face Roberts. He recalled the moments, ""Vishy walked up to me and told me that Roberts would bowl a bouncer. I was preparing for it when Roberts, on his way to his run-up mark, looked back and glared at me. That simply unnerved me.""GRV retorted good-naturedly, ""Who asked him to look at the bowler?""""When Roberts started his run-up, I moved towards the forward short leg and tapped the leg-cutter which curled away. Lloyd took the catch at first slip and that was the end of it,"" said Chandrasekar.India were bowled out for 190, but history still awaited Pataudi's men. GRV hit a patient 46 in India's second innings, Prasanna took 9-111 in the match and Bedi claimed six wickets for a famous win.""I've scored 100s with many strokes. All those strokes came in one inning,"" remembered a modest Indian hero, half a century later.","GR Viswanath's unbeaten 97 against the West Indies in Chennai (then Madras) on Jan 11, 1975, overshadows all else.

NEW DELHI: Abu Dhabi Knight Riders celebrated their maiden victory in ILT20 Season 3, defeating Sharjah Warriorz by 30 runs at the Zayed Cricket Stadium, Abu Dhabi. Jason Holder ’s brilliant spell of 4/23 and David Willey ’s 3/19 helped defend the target of 159/5 with ease.Batting first, the Knight Riders were propelled to 159/5, thanks to a late unbeaten 50-run partnership between Andre Russell and Laurie Evans in the death overs. Kyle Mayers provided an early spark with a quickfire 21, while Evans anchored the innings with an unbeaten 39. Russell added fireworks at the end with a 12-ball 24. In reply, the Warriorz struggled to build partnerships and were hindered by numerous dot balls.The Warriorz innings mirrored the first, as David Willey dismissed Tom Kohler-Cadmore and Jason Roy within the first three overs. Johnston Charles attempted a counterattack but fell to Jason Holder, leaving the Warriorz at 29/3 in the powerplay. Rohan Mustafa added 21 runs with four boundaries before becoming Holder’s second victim in the eighth over.Willey returned to claim his third wicket, removing Karim Janat for nine.

Their unbeaten 50-run partnership off 27 balls carried the Knight Riders to 159/5 in their allotted 20 overs.Also See: Champions Trophy 2025 Fixtures Reflecting on the loss, Sharjah Warriorz captain Tim Southee said, “The pitch was a tricky one. It is still early stages of the tournament; we will dust ourselves off and look forward to the next ones. We would like our dot balls to be a lot lower than 70 balls so we will try to minimise that. We know this game can change quickly, so we get a day off tomorrow and we go again.”Player of the Match David Willey explained his bowling strategy, saying, “I always aim to take wickets and try to swing the new ball to achieve that. The scoreboard generally dictates what we need, and I focus on reading the game well to deliver accordingly. I've built my career around swinging the ball and always strive to stay one step ahead of the batter.”",Abu Dhabi Knight Riders beat Sharjah Warriorz by 30 runs in ILT20 Season 3.

NEW DELHI: South Africa’s hopes for the ICC Champions Trophy 2025 suffered a blow as fast bowler Anrich Nortje was ruled out due to a back injury.The 31-year-old, who was also sidelined from the remainder of the SA20 for the Pretoria Capitals, underwent scans on Monday that confirmed the severity of his condition.Nortje, initially named in South Africa’s 15-member squad for the Champions Trophy , will be unavailable for the tournament, where the Proteas are set to begin their campaign against Afghanistan on 21 February in Karachi, Pakistan.The team has yet to announce a replacement for the pace spearhead.Adding a glimmer of hope, Lungi Ngidi has been included in the squad, marking his return to international cricket after a groin injury sidelined him since October 2024.South Africa has retained the core group of players that reached the semi-finals of the 2023 Men’s Cricket World Cup, with 10 of the 15 members from that squad retained.The squad also includes four new faces – Tony de Zorzi, Ryan Rickelton, Tristan Stubbs, and Wiaan Mulder – all eager to make an impact in their maiden 50-over ICC tournament.Head coach Rob Walter expressed optimism about the squad’s prospects. “This squad boasts a wealth of experience, with many players having consistently performed in high-pressure situations.

Record-chasing Isak

Newcastle United's Alexander Isak celebrates after scoring against Wolves in the Premier League. (AP)

London: Arsenal reignited their Premier League title challenge with a 2-1 victory over Tottenham on Wednesday, while Newcastle secured a spot in the top four thanks to a brace from Alexander Isak.In other matches, David Moyes had a disappointing return to the Everton dugout as his team lost 1-0 to Aston Villa at Goodison Park.The win at the Emirates lifts Arsenal to within four points of league leaders Liverpool, who drew 1-1 with Nottingham Forest on Tuesday, and ended a three-match winless run for the Gunners across all competitions.Tottenham took the lead through Son Heung-min in the 25th minute, but Arsenal equalised 15 minutes later when Gabriel's header from a corner deflected off Dominic Solanke for an own goal.Arsenal completed the turnaround just before halftime, with Leandro Trossard blasting a shot past new Spurs goalkeeper Antonin Kinsky.Despite numerous chances to extend their lead, Arsenal failed to do so and had a nervous moment when Pedro Porro hit the post in stoppage time.Arsenal now sits on 43 points after 21 matches, four points behind Liverpool, who have a game in hand.Mikel Arteta, the Arsenal manager, praised his team's performance, calling it ""outstanding.""""We had some big chances and big situations. At the end we had to suffer more than we wanted,"" he told the BBC.""When you have opportunities (to close the gap) you have to take them. We are on a really consistent run in the Premier League. It's about recovery tomorrow and Aston Villa on Saturday, going and going.""The defeat is another setback for injury-plagued Tottenham, who have taken only five points from their last nine Premier League games and have fallen to 13th in the table.Tottenham manager Ange Postecoglou was critical of his team's performance, saying, ""Nowhere near good enough, especially in the first half. We were too passive.""Newcastle moved into fourth place, ahead of struggling Chelsea, with a 3-0 victory over Wolves, thanks to a record-chasing performance from Isak, who scored for the eighth consecutive league match.Isak's deflected shot off Wolves defender Rayan Ait-Nouri put Newcastle ahead in the 34th minute, and he doubled the lead before the hour mark with his 15th league goal of the season.Anthony Gordon added a third goal for Newcastle.""I feel amazing,"" said Isak, who has Jamie Vardy's record of scoring in 11 straight Premier League games in his sights.""Individually I feel free and confident but looking at the team we are doing so well as well, defending and with threats going forward. It is a team and I have to keep contributing with goals.""At Goodison Park, Ollie Watkins scored the only goal for Aston Villa in the 51st minute, slotting past England teammate Jordan Pickford after being sent through by Morgan Rogers.Despite their efforts, Everton lacked creativity, which is unsurprising for a team that has scored only 15 league goals in 20 matches this season.The result lifts Aston Villa to seventh in the table, while Everton remain in deep trouble, just one point above the relegation zone in 16th place.Everton, who have been in the top flight since 1954, have struggled against relegation for the past three seasons and are once again in a perilous position.David Moyes, who enjoyed success during his 11-year stint at Goodison Park from 2002 to 2013, was brought back by Everton's new American owners, the Friedkin Group, after they sacked Sean Dyche last week.""Obviously it's been a bit of a whirlwind,"" Moyes said. ""Sean Dyche left a group of players that have great character and a great attitude.""I'm really pleased to take over that. What I need to do is add quality and find a way of getting results but you can't change the whole thing around straight away.""In another match, Leicester suffered their sixth consecutive league defeat, losing 2-0 to Crystal Palace, which leaves them second from bottom in the table.Jean-Philippe Mateta scored for Palace early in the second half, and Marc Guehi secured the points with a late second goal.","Arsenal beat Tottenham Hotspur 2-1 to move within four points of Premier League leaders Liverpool.

NEW DELHI: As they say, there is no dull day in Indian football. The latest drama is taking place at Mohammedan SC . Reports emerged on Tuesday from Kolkata's Vivekananda Yuba Bharati Krirangan claiming that Mohammedan players boycotted training ahead of their Indian Super League ( ISL ) home game against Chennaiyin FC , scheduled for January 15. The players were allegedly protesting against three-month unpaid wages.It was further suggested that while the club management had committed to clearing the dues by January 15, players reportedly decided to abstain from training due to a lack of concrete steps from the administration.This news surfaced amid Mohammedan’s resurgence in the ISL, riding on a three-match unbeaten streak. As the team stands second-last on the table, with Hyderabad FC below them, coach Andrey Chernyshov has been working tirelessly to turn their season around.Amid the cub's resurrection, the report of players boycotting training sessions over unpaid dues has raised eyebrows. However, Mohammedan SC have dismissed the rumours.In an exclusive interview with TimesofIndia.com, Mohammedan SC General Secretary Ishtiaque Ahmed, famously known as Raju around the Maidan region, categorically refuted the claims.""The reports that have come out are all fake and baseless, and they are being fabricated and posted on Facebook. There is no such issue as players not receiving their payments; all players are being paid. If players were not being paid, how would we be signing new players?"" said Ahmed.Despite challenges on the pitch, the Kolkata-based club has been actively reinforcing their squad in recent times. During the current transfer window, MDSC have secured several promising talents, including domestic standouts like Manvir Singh, Mahitosh Roy, Santosh Trophy winner Robi Hansda, and Juwel Ahmed Mazumder.Additionally, foreign signings such as Florent Ogier and Marc Andre Schmerböck have also been added to their ranks. TimesofIndia.com understands that the club is still in pursuit of another striker before the window shuts.Ahmed further clarified the status of training sessions: ""Training is ongoing, and it is happening as usual. All the players are attending the training sessions.""However, addressing the speculation about finances, Ahmed explained recent changes in the club’s payment structure: ""Our payment structure has been changed. Previously, we used to make advance payments to the players before the month ended. But now, we need results. It’s not feasible that the investors keep making payments without getting results in return.""The shift in approach extends to the incentive system as well. Ahmed elaborated, ""By structure, we mean the incentive system we had. Previously, we provided incentives to all the players. Now, it has been decided that only players who perform well will receive incentives. The players have also been informed that if they do not perform well, their incentives will be cut.""Not all squad members have been actively participating in the ISL, with some sidelined due to injuries or suspensions. This has naturally influenced the club’s approach toward incentive payments.""Last month, advance payments were not made, but the payments for the previous month have been cleared this month. Previously, we used to make advance payments, but now that is no longer happening.""Perhaps the decision to pay players at the end of the month might serve as a motivating factor to inspire better performance, believes the club secretary.On the other hand, refuting the rumours about players boycotting training, Ahmed clarified, ""All the players are attending training. The reports that are circulating are speculating that players didn’t show up due to financial reasons, but that’s not true. Some players were given rest, and some were dealing with injuries, which is why the coach didn’t include them in practice sessions.""Ahmed also confirmed that there were no hidden financial issues grappling the club: ""There are no financial difficulties. If there were any, we would definitely address them openly. Why wouldn’t we say it?""",Mohammedan SC deny reports of players boycotting training over unpaid wages. Club secretary Ishtiaque Ahmed says all players are being paid. Mohammedan are currently second-last in the Indian Super League ( ISL) They face Chennaiyin FC in their next match on January 15.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117262167,imgsize-84278,width-400,resizemode-4/117262167.jpg"

KOLKATA: Describing them as a casualty of continuous poor refereeing calls and highlighting a “step-motherly treatment” in the Indian Super League , East Bengal club has decided to take their grievance to the doorstep of Union sports minister.The club is understood to have sent a missive to Mansukh L Mandaviya on Tuesday night, seeking intervention from him for Indian football ’s sorry state of affairs.East Bengal’s move came close on the heels of their latest loss to Mohun Bagan SG in the ISL during which the club claimed that referee Venkatest R ignored “a genuine” penalty call and gave an “unnecessary” booking to midfielder Souvik Chakrabarti, who had eventually received a marching order.“Throughout the last 10-12 years we had to bear the brunt of biased refereeing, be it in the ILeague or more so in the ISL,” club secretary Rupak Saha said in a statement.“The step-motherly treatment in ISL has made us wonder whether the ISL is still being run in the spirit of one-city-one-club with which it was envisaged originally,” he further noted.Meanwhile, the AIFF chief refereeing officer Trevor Kettle has backed Venkatesh’s decision, saying East Bengal were not denied a penalty in the derby in Guwahati, which Mohun Bagan SG won 1-0, their ninth win in 10 meetings against the city rivals in ISL.“These people (like Kettle) have made Indian football a laughing stock and forced us to reach the minister’s office for his intervention,” senior East Bengal official Debabrata Sarkar said.",East Bengal have taken their grievance to the doorstep of Union sports minister.

Liverpool 's charge towards the Premier League title was halted by stubborn Nottingham Forest in a 1-1 draw between the top two on Tuesday as Manchester City 's resurgence came undone in a 2-2 draw at Brentford.Chris Wood fired Forest in front early on at a raucous City Ground, but Liverpool dominated almost the entire 97 minutes and got back on level terms thanks to substitute Diogo Jota's goal with his first touch.Only a brilliant goalkeeping performance from Matz Sels denied the leaders victory, but the point maintained a six-point cushion over Forest for Arne Slot's men, who also have a game in hand.Forest had won their last seven games in all competitions to raise the possibility of matching Leicester's incredible title win of 2015/16.The in-form Wood had the home fans believing after just eight minutes when he slotted in Anthony Elanga's pass.Liverpool enjoyed over 70 percent possession and had 23 shots on goal but only posed a serious threat in front of goal after the break.Jota had only been on the field a matter of seconds when he nodded in Kostas Tsimikas' corner.Sels then made incredible saves to deny Jota, Mohamed Salah and Cody Gakpo a winner, while Salah also had a goalbound effort cleared off the line.""I could not have asked for more,"" said Slot. ""Second half was outstanding.""There are not many teams that can create so many chances against an opponent so defensively strong. Unfortunately we couldn't get a second.""Liverpool's second consecutive league draw opens the door for Arsenal to cut the gap at the top to four points when they host Tottenham in the north London derby on Wednesday.Any suggestion City could get themselves back in the title race was ended in a late collapse in west London as Brentford struck twice in the final 10 minutes for a deserved point.Phil Foden's double had City on course for a fourth consecutive win after a run of just one victory in 13 games.However, the English champions' defending was not convincing all night and they were punished as Yoane Wissa and Christian Norgaard netted for the Bees.Foden's return to the form that saw him crowned Premier League player of the year last season was the one positive for City.But Pep Guardiola will reflect on a missed opportunity to make up ground on the top four as City remain down in sixth, 12 points off the top.Foden produced a brilliant deft touch from Kevin De Bruyne's inviting delivery and then smashed in a rebound for his fourth goal in five league games.Brentford wasted a host of chances before conceding but finally got some reward for their attacking endeavour when Wissa slotted in from Mads Roerslev's cross to become the club's all-time leading goalscorer in the Premier League.They completed the comeback in stoppage time when Norgaard's header had too much power for Stefan Ortega.""We are not (at our best) and we didn't take the right decisions,"" said Guardiola. ""It's fine, it's not a good place to come. Unfortunately, we couldn't win.""Fourth-placed Chelsea's miserable run extended to five league games without a win but they were grateful for captain Reece James' stoppage-time equaliser salvaging a point in a 2-2 draw at home to Bournemouth.Cole Palmer's cool finish from Nicolas Jackson's through ball had given Chelsea the perfect start.But Bournemouth hit back through Justin Kluivert's penalty, before Antoine Semenyo's blistering near-post effort put the visitors in front.James has endured another injury-hit season but showed his quality by curling home a free-kick at the death.West Ham boss Graham Potter enjoyed a winning home debut as Fulham were beaten 3-2 at the London Stadium.Carlos Soler, Tomas Soucek and Lucas Paqueta were on target for the Hammers to take Potter's men above Manchester United and Tottenham into 12th.",Liverpool held to 1-1 draw by Nottingham Forest at the City Ground.

Conceicao success

Milan: Atalanta creeped closer to Serie A leaders Napoli on Tuesday after drawing an entertaining match with Juventus 1-1 and moving to within four points of the summit, while AC Milan came from behind to beat Como.Mateo Retegui salvaged a point for Atalanta with a close-range header 12 minutes from time, not long after returning to action from the bench following four weeks on the sidelines with a hamstring injury.The Italy striker's finish, which levelled Pierre Kalulu's 54th-minute opener for Juve, put him out on his own at the top of the Serie A scoring charts on 13 goals and pushed Atalanta to 43 points, ahead of table-topping Napoli's crucial trip to Bergamo this coming weekend.Gian Piero Gasperini's side, who are bidding for their first league title after winning the Europa League last season, sit level on points with second-placed Inter Milan.However, champions Inter have two games in hand on both Atalanta and Napoli and play the first of those fixtures against Bologna at the San Siro on Wednesday.""It was a great match tonight, and I'm very happy with the way my boys played,"" said Gasperini to Sky.""It was difficult going behind because we were hoping to go ahead but I think at the end of the day a draw is probably a fair result.""Tuesday's draw was Atalanta and Juve's rescheduled fixture due to their trip to Saudi Arabia to contest the Italian Super Cup earlier this month with Inter and winners AC Milan.Juve were again without a recognised striker due to an injury crisis which has left both Dusan Vlahovic and Arkadiusz Milik sidelined but Thiago Motta's side were a constant threat.Moments before his opener Kalulu watched on in frustration as his glancing header hit the inside of the post and was just scooped off the line by Atalanta goalkeeper Marco Carnesecchi.And Kenan Yildiz put wide a great chance to snatch a last-gasp win deep in stoppage time, shortly after substitute Nicolo Zaniolo slapped a golden opportunity for the hosts straight at Juve goalkeeper Michele Di Gregorio.""To draw like that in the closing minutes hurts a bit. We played well and had the chances to win today,"" said Kalulu.Juve remain unbeaten but have now drawn 13 of their 20 league fixtures and sit fifth, 13 points behind Napoli.Earlier, Theo Hernandez and Rafael Leao saved Milan from an embarrassing defeat at Como with the goals which gave Sergio Conceicao's new team a 2-1 win.Trailing to Assane Diao's fine low strike on the hour mark, star players Hernandez and Leao turned the match around by the 76th minute, handing Conceicao his first league win as Milan coach.Tuesday's victory in one of their two games in hand moved Milan up to seventh on 31 points, five behind fourth-placed Lazio as Conceicao tries to reignite the Italian giants' bid for Champions League qualification.""They (Como) are a good team with a good coach, it's not easy to play here,"" said Conceicao.""It was an even game but we can't concede as much as we did, we need to be more organised.""Left flank pairing Hernandez and Leao had reportedly been at loggerheads with Conceicao's predecessor Paulo Fonseca, who was sacked at the end of December following a dismal opening half of the season.Both praised their new coach after he arrived just before the new year and immediately won the Super Cup for Milan, who came from two goals behind to beat Inter in Saudi Arabia earlier this month.Hernandez levelled for Milan 11 minutes after Como new boy Diao's opener when his mishit volley sliced off his left boot and looped past goalkeeper Jean Butez.Leao dinked home the decisive goal shortly afterwards, meeting substitute Tammy Abraham's excellent through ball before netting his seventh goal in all competitions.",Atalanta draw 1-1 with Juventus in Serie A.

Sadaoui netted the winner in the 90+5th minute, having earlier provided the assist for Jesus Jimenez 's strike in the 73rd minute.The match sprang to life as soon as it started, with Odisha FC taking an early advantage through Mawihmingthanga's goal in the fourth minute. A clearance from Odisha's half landed in the Blasters' penalty area. Despite the ball bouncing in front of Pritam Kotal, the Indian international hesitated and failed to make a proper clearance. Odisha's striker Dorielton Nascimento capitalised on the defensive error and directed a header towards Mawihmingthanga, who gently guided the ball past Sachin Suresh to put the visitors ahead.After falling behind, Blasters launched numerous attacks on the Odisha goalmouth, clearly controlling the latter part of the first half and the initial minutes of the second half. Their persistence paid off in the 60th minute. Korou Singh, who was positioned in the attacking third, surprisingly retreated to the midfield, catching the Odisha defence off guard. He then provided Kwame Peprah with a precise pass from the right of the centre line, splitting two Odisha defenders. Peprah, left with only goalkeeper Amrinder Singh to beat, slotted the ball skilfully to draw the scores level.Soon after the equaliser, Blasters strengthened their strike force by substituting defender Alexandre Coeff with striker Jesus Jimenez. This tactical change proved beneficial for the hosts when Jimenez put Blasters ahead in the 73rd minute. Luna delivered a cross from the right flank to Sadaoui positioned near the far post, who directed a header towards Jimenez. The striker simply extended his foot to guide the ball into the net, securing a 2-1 lead for Blasters.Odisha managed to level the score when Dorielton Nascimento converted a rebound in the 80th minute. However, Odisha's fortunes took a turn for the worse when Carlos Delgado, who entered as a substitute in the 66th minute, received his second yellow card in the 82nd minute for consecutive fouls, reducing his team to ten players.Blasters made the numerical superiority count when Sadaoui found the back of the net during stoppage time. His strike from inside the penalty box took a fortunate deflection off Rahim Ali and looped into the net to give Blasters a much-needed victory.","Noah Sadaoui netted the winner in the 90+5th minute, having earlier provided the assist for Jesus Jimenez's strike in the 73rd minute.

Coaching The Fundamental

Since Sir Alex Ferguson retired in 2013, Manchester United fans – particularly those who reached adolescence when the Class of 1992 made the first-team cut – have channelled their inner Ronin (Hawkeye’s murderous avatar into beg the team not to give hope. Over the years, there have been numerous false dawns, slivers of light ahead of the tunnel that have made United fans dream again before they were snatched away, like Morpheus’ Nebuchadnezzar’s lament: “I had a dream, but the dream was taken from me.”There was the Van Gaal era where fans were convinced that a former tactician – a man some claim invented modern football – could bring United back to the glory years. Then they convinced themselves that the Special One, by sheer dint of willpower and personality (and a little bit of the dark arts), the fallen Lucifer to Pep Guardiola’s Michael, would be the right person to resuscitate the Red Devils. They almost persuaded themselves, when Ole was at the wheel, that the good times were rolling again. It certainly felt like that on that night in Paris and when United were playing like the Fergie teams of yore. They even dared to hope that a man named Eric would lead the charge again, much like the collared Frenchman who did it in the early Fergie years.And now, Ruben Amorim, the youngest Man Utd manager in half a century, is playing the Pandora’s Box’s old trick again. Of course, on paper, Amorim’s record is nothing to write home about. His record in his first 13 games reads: five wins, two draws and six losses. Most other Man Utd managers actually have better records. Sir Alex Ferguson’s read: three wins, seven draws and three losses. It’s what came after those 13 games that makes Manchester United fans believe.But there has been something of the old grit that defined Fergie teams that has Utd fans daring to hope again. The back-to-the-wall performance evoked an older Man Utd vs Arsenal clash: the epic 1999 replay.The similarities are astounding between the 1999 FA Cup semi-final replay and the 2025 third-round showdown between the two clubs.The only difference in the 2025 match was that it was decided on penalty shootouts and not a wondrous Ryan Giggs goal that made Maradona look up from his cocaine pile.And in a strange way, it was a mirror image of the 2005 FA Cup final with its infamous Band of Brothers viral image featuring Paul Scholes, Roy Keane, Cristiano Ronaldo, Wayne Rooney , Ryan Giggs, Mikaël Silvestre and Quinton Fortune.Incidentally, Manchester United battered Arsenal in that match – a follow-up to the infamous 4-2 “I will see you out there” Highbury fight – but still lost on a penalty shootout with Paul Scholes missing the last penalty. That day, United had eight shots on target, 12 off target, and 12 corners (far more than Arsenal) but still lost.It was a different ballgame in 2025. Arsenal had 26 shots to Man Utd’s seven, 71% of the possession, and a 3.3 xG to United’s 1.1 but failed to make their mark. United players have been struggling to adapt to Ruben Amorim’s style, but against Arsenal (like they did against Manchester City and Liverpool), there was a slight glimpse of the taste in the pudding.In the cult classic Coach Carter – when Samuel L. Jackson was whipping a bunch of askew young men into shape – he was asked by his team what they should do since they hadn’t practised attacking. To this, Jackson’s Carter had said: “Run.” And that’s what United players did in the match, all of them running together as a pack to keep Arsenal at bay.Harry Maguire, often the pantomime villain on the football pitch and even in parliaments around the world, was a colossus in defence. Equally driven were Lisandro Martínez and Matthijs de Ligt, the latter finally learning how to operate in a three-man midfield.Of course, Arsenal’s inability to finish was one of the major reasons this match went to penalties, with Kai Havertz moved around the pitch like Roy Keane was screaming “You can’t score in a brothel!” in his ear.But United fans will rejoice at the grit from a team that, during the last days of the Ten Hag era, looked like they were simply not interested in playing football. Whether it was Bayindir’s redemption after the horror performance against Tottenham in the Carabao Cup, academy graduate Toby Collyer’s gut-bursting runs, Bruno’s Roy Keane impression or Noussair Mazraoui and Manuel Ugarte in midfield, this was a team effort.And the performance came against refereeing that launched a thousand memes about Arsenal players diving with abandon, which included a soft penalty and a red card.A swallow doesn’t make a summer, and Manchester United will probably have to suffer for many more years before they finally have a team worthy of cleaning the boots of any of the vintage Ferguson teams. But for the moment, United fans can at least hope that the current side, even if they lack the sheer world-class talent of the Band of Brothers or the 1999 winning team or any of the great Fergie teams, will give it their all every time they are wearing the United shirt.Next up in the FA Cup: Ruud van Nistelrooy’s Leicester City, the last interim manager of Manchester United and a man who knows a thing or two about the gigantic expectations that come with wearing the Manchester United shirt.",Manchester United lost 3-2 to Arsenal in the 2025 FA Cup third round.

In an alarming coincidence, each of their three home losses in this ISL campaign have come by that very scoreline.In a game that took until the second half to come to life, it was Mohammed Sanan who set the visitors on their way in the 64th minute with a clinical finish.Just as Mumbai City so nearly drew level when Nikolaos Karelis's left-footed effort stung Albino Gomes's palms in the closing minutes, Jordan Murray (86th) sealed the three points for Khalid Jamil's side following a quick break after Jamshedpur had won back possession.There was time for one final dagger which arrived in stoppage time as Javi Hernandez (90+6) fired home from inside the box.The win saw Jamshedpur climb to third place, level on points with Bengaluru (27pts) with a game in hand. Mumbai, meanwhile, still occupy sixth spot and that final playoff berth, but were left to rue another bitter outing at home. Although they went into this game with a confidence-boosting 3-2 win at East Bengal last week, there is no doubt that the Islanders are finding goals hard to come by this season.Coach Petr Kratky has even resorted to switching captain Lallianzuala Chhangte from his favoured position on the right of their usual three-man attack to playing in the hole behind the front three.It would yield no dividends on this occasion, as Jamshedpur's backline were disciplined enough to deal with anything Karelis, Vikram Partap Singh or Bipin Singh were able to ask of them.To make matters worse, Chhangte was sent off after the game for dissent.","Jamshedpur beat Mumbai City 0-3 at the Mumbai Football Arena.

Altay Bayindir was the unexpected hero for Manchester United as they edged past Arsenal in a dramatic FA Cup encounter at the Emirates. The match ended 1-1 after 90 minutes, and United triumphed 5-4 on penalties, with Bayindir making crucial saves both in normal time and during the shootout to send the holders into the fourth round.United took the lead early in the second half when Bruno Fernandes unleashed a thunderous strike into the top corner, capitalising on a slip by Gabriel after Alejandro Garnacho's incisive run. However, the game turned when Diogo Dalot received a second yellow card on the hour mark for a reckless challenge, leaving United to defend with 10 men for over half an hour.Arsenal wasted no time exploiting their numerical advantage as Gabriel Magalhães scored the equaliser, with Bayindir failing to deal with Gabriel Martinelli’s cross, resulting in a deflected shot finding the net.Despite dominating possession and creating multiple chances, Arsenal failed to capitalise. Their woes were compounded when Bayindir saved Martin Odegaard’s penalty following a controversial decision against Harry Maguire, who was furious at the call and clashed with Kai Havertz during the ensuing melee.Bayindir redeemed himself further with a stunning stop to deny Declan Rice and another to keep Havertz at bay as Arsenal squandered golden opportunities to secure the win in regulation.In the penalty shootout, United were flawless. Fernandes, Amad Diallo, Leny Yoro, Lisandro Martinez, and Josua Zirkzee all converted their spot-kicks, with Zirkzee calmly scoring the decisive penalty. Bayindir’s save against Havertz in the shootout proved pivotal, capping a remarkable performance for the Turkish goalkeeper.The defeat deepens Arsenal’s recent struggles, coming on the back of a League Cup semi-final first-leg loss to Newcastle.

Siegemund shock:

Mensik powers through:

Late in the 32-minute opening set, perhaps during the changeover when staring at an emphatic 0-5 scoreline, Naomi Osaka 's vivid sunflower hair clips came off.It might've helped untether the Japanese's fierce groundstrokes as she won 18 of the next 23 games against Czech Karolina Muchova , who she had lost successive meetings to, most recently in New York, to move into the third round of a major for the first time since January 2022.Osaka, the two-time Melbourne Park champion, rallied from a set down to defeat the 20th seed 1-6, 6-1, 6-3 on Wednesday.The 27-year-old, who recently announced on social media that she and rapper boyfriend Cordae had parted ways, sported the sunflower theme, in her hair, ears and shoes, underlining the look was fitting for the Happy Slam.""I don't know if anyone was able to take a very zoomed-in picture of my shoes, but on the side it says, 'The sun shines where you are',"" she said of her tangerine-hued lace-ups, with sunflower accents in the front. ""It was fitting to have a sunny theme (for here).""Osaka's gear contrasted the fickle Melbourne weather – dank and dismal; the crowd responded to it, getting into the contest from the get-go.

""I think I'm the type of person that tries to focus on themselves a lot when playing, but I really did enjoy the crowd today.

I think the fans probably appreciate it.""Osaka, who has been outspoken on a number of issues, said she was an athlete first and mother next when on the court.""We are labelled 'moms,' of course. I think when you go on the tennis court, you just think of yourself as a tennis player,"" she said.

He has shown what an incredible tennis player he is and he's ranked top 10 in the world and has been there for a whole year, which is not an easy thing to do.""""Having him come out and support me means pretty much everything to me. Having that extra positivity from my bench makes the difference,"" the 28-year-old Briton said.Boulter's scores kept flashing on Rod Laver Arena when the Sydney-born De Minaur was on court.""It is tough just because there is a scoreboard that keeps alternating with different results throughout the day, and then all of a sudden you get the score of Katie's match,"" he said. ""You try not to pay too much attention and focus on yourself, but the fact that it's always coming around makes it difficult.""Boulter, 28 from Leicester, wished she could see De Minaur's score when she was playing.""It's obviously difficult knowing he's playing a match and you're kind of hearing cheers here and there and you're hoping that's for him, but you never know,"" she said. ""Look I'm fully focused on what I'm doing, most of the time I'm not thinking about it at all, but of course I'm hoping he wins and that he's out there for the rest of my match!""In Thursday's second-round action, De Minaur takes on American qualifier Tristan Boyer, second match on Rod Laver Arena.

Melbourne: In a shocking upset at the Australian Open , fifth seed Zheng Qinwen , last year's finalist, was eliminated in the second round by World No. 97 Laura Siegemund of Germany. The match ended in straight sets, with Siegemund winning 7-6 (7/3), 6-3 on John Cain Arena.Siegemund, who will turn 37 in March, is the second oldest player in the women's draw and was playing in her 27th Grand Slam.

I had nothing to lose so I just told myself to swing free,"" said the German. ""She's an amazing player, one of the best players right now. But I know I can play well and I wanted to show that to myself and make it a tough fight.""Zheng faced pressure early on, saving a break point in the third game with her powerful serve. However, Siegemund remained undeterred and matched Zheng's baseline play, hitting 11 return winners in the first set alone.At 4-4, Siegemund created two more break points after Zheng received a time violation, and although Zheng saved the first, she hit wide on the second, struggling under the pressure of Siegemund's relentless groundstrokes. Siegemund then served for the set but faltered, allowing Zheng to break back easily.The tiebreak remained even until Siegemund took a 6-3 lead with a double mini-break and converted on her first set point. In the second set, Siegemund broke Zheng's serve to take a 2-0 lead, playing nearly flawlessly.Zheng appeared flat but benefited from two incredible strokes of luck to break back, with a net cord dropping in for a winner and a desperate swing at a wide serve grazing the sideline after going around the net post. However, a second time violation at 15-30 in the next service game cost Zheng a first serve, and despite her complaints to the umpire, she lost her composure.Zheng then double-faulted on break point, handing a crucial 3-1 advantage back to Siegemund, who quickly extended her lead to 4-1. Siegemund served out the match for a remarkable victory amid a flurry of unforced errors from Zheng.Siegemund will face the winner of the all-Russian clash between Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova and Anastasia Potapova in the third round.","World No. 97 Laura Siegemund of Germany beats fifth seed Zheng Qinwen 7-6 (7/3), 6-3.

They became the first Indian men's doubles pair to win a BWF World Super 1000 title when they clinched the 2023 Indonesia Open.The Asian Games gold as well as the 2023 Asian Championships gold were historic firsts too.When the pair entered 2024 - an Olympic year - Satwik and Chirag were India's brightest hopes for a medal at the Paris Olympics . But the duo crashed out in the quarterfinals in Paris. Their defeat not only left them stunned, but also an entire nation.Their Danish coach Mathias Boe stepped down from his position after that loss. Boe's resignation led to Badminton Association of India (BAI) bringing back Malaysian doubles specialist Tan Kim Her , who was going through a highly successful stint with the Japanese national team, in December last year.During his first spell with Indian badminton between 2015-19, Tan was instrumental in bringing Satwik and Chirag together, recognizing their potential as a formidable doubles pair. His coaching helped shape their careers, leading them to significant achievements including podium finishes in various tournaments. Their partnership thrived due to Tan's strategic approach and emphasis on building personal chemistry between the players.Back at the helm, Tan has started giving immediate results. At the just-concluded Malaysia Open and the preceding China Masters in 2024, Satwik and Chirag managed to reach the semifinals.""We've shown consistency. In the last two tournaments, especially the China Open, we came back after a long gap, and to even reach the semifinals was unexpected. In Malaysia, we had some good wins but lost in the semifinals. Winning a tournament is always the goal when we enter, and I wouldn't say we're satisfied with just the semifinal finish. We want to go as deep as possible at the India Open,"" Satwik told TOI.Speaking about their relationship with Tan, Chirag said, ""To have Tan back as our coach after 5-6 years is great. A lot of credit goes to him for our achievements. We were still youngsters when he paired us up, and it was much more directional back then. But the approach is very different now; it's much more conversational.""He added: ""We're already established now, so we discuss what we need to do and as a coach, he shares his opinion. We have immense trust in him.""Chirag revealed that since Tan's return, the duo has been working on improving defence and net play. ""It's the minor changes that really matter. Everybody knows how to smash, but it's the tactical details and small improvements that we need to focus on. We are working on that with Tan, especially improving our defence, which is good but not the best in the world yet,"" said Chirag.With Tan by their side, the duo also reflected on their shock quarterfinal loss at the Paris Olympics.""He shared his thoughts on our quarterfinal loss, where he felt we fell short. It was similar to our own assessment. We should have been better with our net play, especially during the crucial stages. They challenged us well at the net, and that's one area we hope to improve upon with coach Tan by our side,"" Chirag added.",Satwiksairaj Rankireddy and Chirag Shetty had the world at their feet.

Why Shubman Gill flew to Guwahati, what forced management to rule him out and more

India A captain Jitesh Sharma accepted full responsibility for his side’s narrow loss to Bangladesh in the Rising Stars Asia Cup 2025 semi-final. The match was filled with small mistakes, but the most costly was the decision to not send 14-year-old sensation Vaibhav Suryavanshi to bat in the Super Over. Suryavanshi, the tournament’s top run-scorer and biggest six-hitter, remained on the sidelines as India opted for Jitesh, Ramandeep Singh, and Ashutosh Sharma to take on the final showdown.The gamble backfired spectacularly. Both Jitesh and Ashutosh were dismissed for golden ducks, leaving India scoreless in the Super Over. Bangladesh pacer Ripon Mondal was unerring, clean bowling Jitesh with a perfectly pitched yorker when his lap shot failed to connect, and then catching Ashutosh out at cover on the very next ball.Speaking after the game, Jitesh explained that the decision not to send Suryavanshi was collective, believing the youngster excelled in the powerplay while he and others were better suited to the death overs. “I think Vaibhav and Priyansh Arya are masters of the powerplay, but in the death, me, Ashu, and Raman are the ones who can hit the big shots,” he said.Jitesh also reflected on his own innings, scoring 33 off 23 balls at a crucial juncture, calling it the turning point of the match.“As a senior, I should have finished it. I take full responsibility. It’s a learning curve for all of us. The team is talented, but young players can feel pressure in the final overs,” he added.Bangladesh had posted 194 for six, recovering from 130 for six thanks to Meherob Hasan’s blistering 48 off 18 balls, including four sixes and a four in a 28-run 19th over bowled by part-timer Naman Dhir. They added another 20 runs in the final over through Meherob and Akbar Ali, setting India 195 to win.India A started aggressively, with Suryavanshi smashing 38 off 15 balls and Priyansh Arya hitting 44 off 23 to take the score past 50 within 3.1 overs. Both fell trying to go big, leaving Jitesh Sharma and Nehal Wadhera (32*) to keep India in contention. A slowdown in the closing overs meant India needed 16 off the last six deliveries. A frantic final-ball scramble, aided by a misfield and a sloppy throw from wicketkeeper Akbar Ali, allowed India to secure a third run and tie the scores at 194.",India A captain Jitesh Sharma accepted full responsibility for his side’s narrow loss to Bangladesh in the Rising Stars Asia Cup 2025 semi-final.

Pant steps in for a must-win game as India look to level the two-match series, which South Africa currently lead 1-0 following their memorable victory at Eden Gardens.Gill was released from the Test squad on Friday after failing to recover from the neck spasm he suffered while batting during the first innings of the Kolkata Test.The India captain was taken to the hospital for examination after the end of play on Day 2 and was kept under observation before being discharged the next day.“Team India captain Shubman Gill, who suffered a neck injury during the first Test against South Africa, has been ruled out of the second Test in Guwahati,” BCCI secretary Devajit Saikia said in a statement.Gill travelled with the team to Guwahati on November 19 but continued to experience discomfort, prompting the medical team to advise rest.“Unfortunately, he was not fully fit to feature in the 2nd Test and will head to Mumbai for further assessment,” the statement added.India batting coach Sitanshu Kotak had earlier underlined the risk of rushing Gill back, saying, “We don’t want recurrence of spasm during the game.”With Gill’s availability for the upcoming ODI series also uncertain, Pant now has the responsibility of leading India in a crucial encounter that could decide the fate of the series.: India vs South Africa, 2nd Test: Saturday, November 22, 2025: Barsapara Cricket Stadium, Guwahati9:00 AM ISTThe second Test match between India and South Africa will be played from November 22, Saturday.The second Test match between India and South Africa will be played at Barsapara Cricket Stadium in Guwahati.The second Test match between India and South Africa will start at 9:00 AM IST.

Sachin Tendulkar Recalls Receiving Sri Sathya Sai Baba’s Blessings Before 2011 WC

Former Australia captain Ricky Ponting was recently asked to pick his best no. 4 batter in Test cricket ahead of the Ashes series beginning Friday.At first, given the choice to pick between Kevin Pietersen and Mahela Jayawardene, Ponting picked Pietersen. Then Ponting chose Kevin Pietersen (KP) over Mark Waugh, and then Pakistan's former cricketer Javed Miandad over KP.Thereafter, the former Australian men's cricket team captain chose fellow countryman Steve Smith over Miandad. He then picked Steve Smith over West Indies legend Brian Lara, and former South African all-rounder Jacques Kallis.Then put forward with a tough of choosing between Steve Smith and Virat Kohli, Ponting went with Smith. Then he also chose Smith over England batter Joe Root, saying, ""Smith's average is obviously better, Root has got 13,500 runs. I'm gonna go with Steve Smith still.""Lastly, he was asked to choose between Steve Smith and Sachin Tendulkar, and Ponting chose Smith as the best No.4 in Test cricket.Ricky Ponting has also delivered his predictions on the upcoming Ashes series.While Australia have held the Ashes since 2018 and has lost just four Test matches to England on home soil since the turn of the century, Ponting believes England will be competitive during the five-match Test series Down Under.""I don't think there'll be any draws, just the way that England play,"" Ponting declared, as quoted from the official website of the ICC.""If there's reasonable weather through the Australian summer, we know that the biggest concern for the last 15 years has been Sydney with the amount of days we've lost there,"" he said.""Perth and Brisbane this time of year are normally great. So I don't foresee any drawn games and I just think it's going to be really, really close,"" he added.""So I'm going 3-2 Australia,"" he noted.","Former Australia captain Ricky Ponting was recently asked to pick his best no. 4 batter in Test cricket ahead of the Ashes series.

Guwahati:

“We woke up this morning to watch the Ashes and did it with a bit of jealousy, knowing that they were playing five Tests.”These were Temba Bavuma ’s thoughts when asked about the two-Test series they are playing against India. These are two of the best teams in the business, and it is the second consecutive series between them that has only two games. In 2023-24, the series in South Africa ended 1-1 after Rohit Sharma’s team fought back in Cape Town following a defeat in the first Test in Pretoria.Indian captain Rishabh Pant agreed with Bavuma. “The pressure is more in a two-Test series because if you lose the first match, it gets tricky. But then, we don’t think too much about this,” India’s stand-in captain said.India regularly play four- or five-Test series against teams like England and Australia, but it isn’t always the case with South Africa. The World Test champions of the last cycle played quite a few two-Test series over the last year, including two against Pakistan, one against Sri Lanka, and one against Bangladesh.There’s a theory in ICC circles that beyond the Ashes, Border-Gavaskar Trophy, and Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy, not too many Test series are commercially viable.The WTC champions, despite their recent brilliance in the format, still aren’t a money-spinner when it comes to red-ball cricket.“Players are not involved when it comes to mapping out the schedule. I think each of our players who have had the opportunity to interact with the media have had that question in front of them. They have voiced their frustration,” Bavuma said. The right-hander hopes this trend will end and that they will get more chances to play longer series. “Hopefully, in the near future, we’ll go back to playing four Tests against India. ” Hope the men who run the sport are listening.","South Africa are playing a two-Test series against India in Guwahati.

Guwahati:

'When you don't play well, this is what happens': Gautam Gambhir reacts to 1st Test defeat, points out what India lacked

Fading light could be a factor:

It was well beyond the scheduled arrival time, but there was still no sign of the Indian team bus. “They will be timed out in training,” someone joked as the anticipation around the practice nets grew.Will Shubman Gill turn up? Will he make a final attempt to be ready for the all-important second Test? The questions lingered. Soon, they were answered as Gill did not turn up, drawing the curtains on the speculation theatre. “Gill tried his best to be fit, you have to give him that, but the injury was such that it couldn’t be helped,” stand-in captain Rishabh Pant said, taking over as India’s 38th Test skipper.While Pant came to the ground for the press conference and perhaps to take one final look at the pitch, there was a notable change in India’s pre-match routine. Unlike other Tests, when only the reserves turn up for a knock on the eve of the game, three first-team batters — KL Rahul Yashasvi Jaiswal and Sai Sudharsan — arrived with a group of support staff led by Gautam Gambhir on Friday.Sai, who will bat at either No. 3 or No. 6, went through his pre-match rituals, walking barefoot across the turf and shadow-practising at the crease, while openers Rahul and Jaiswal hit the nets. It was clear how desperate India, trailing 0-1 in the series, are to handle the morning challenge South Africa will pose at the Assam Cricket Stadium in Barsapara. The pitch, according to captains Temba Bavuma and Rishabh Pant, will be a traditional subcontinent red-soil surface where the ball is expected to turn from Day 3, and batters should find conditions slightly easier than at Eden Gardens.But with a 9 am start, the pacers may call the shots early due to the greenish tinge retained on the pitch.In such conditions, Rahul and Jaiswal must give India a solid start. Coach Gambhir spent time with Jaiswal, urging him to play closer to the body and right under his nose. There will be some relief for the openers with the news that South African pacer Kagiso Rabada has been officially ruled out of the Test.Rabada did not train on Friday, and Bavuma said there was a temptation to play Lungi Ngidi on this track, adding that he is “bowling as well as he ever has.” It remains to be seen if he replaces Corbin Bosch, who played a crucial hand with the bat lower down the order at Eden Gardens.Senuran Muthusamy, another left-arm spinner who can bat, bowled for quite some time on the adjacent pitch. With Keshav Maharaj having an ordinary game in Kolkata, South Africa appear to be considering the Muthusamy option.For India, the pitch conditions and Gill’s absence may facilitate the return of Nitish Reddy to the XI. As a right-hander, he brings variety to a left-heavy batting order, and his ability to bowl change-up pace could work in India’s favour. That may lead to Axar Patel sitting out. Pant said the team has considered all options and “the player who will play has been communicated about the decision.”If the pitch holds up well, the possibility of a draw emerges. By 3.45 pm, the light fades, and India’s bowlers may have to work extra hard to take wickets quickly so lost time doesn’t hurt them. A draw does not help India, especially after everything that has unfolded over the past week. The pressure is immense to level the series 1-1. With WTC points at stake and memories of last year’s 3-0 whitewash in New Zealand still fresh, another home series defeat will be hard to digest.“At this top level, you have to deal with pressure, especially when you’re down. But as a team, we don’t dwell too much on the result every time we play. It’s about keeping a clear mindset and giving your 200%,” Pant said. It remains to be seen if that will be enough for India to secure the face-saving win they are chasing in Assam’s debut Test.","Shubman Gill fails to turn up for India's pre-match press conference.

Rishabh Pant ready to embrace the captaincy challenge in Guwahati,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/india-vs-south-africa/rishabh-pant-ready-to-embrace-the-captaincy-challenge-in-guwahati/articleshow/125497774.cms,"Rishabh Pant (ANI)

Guwahati:

It’s the chirpy restlessness of Rishabh Pant that has made him an absolute darling of the fans over the last few years. While he is a wonderful helping hand for a captain in charge of proceedings, his quick-thinking methods as skipper have had a 50-50 impact in the IPL.But come Test cricket, it’s a different kettle of fish. In Kolkata, when Pant took over the captaincy from an injured Shubman Gill , he made a crucial error of judgement on the morning of Day 3 — possibly in his desperation to be out of the box. He held back Jasprit Bumrah and started with Axar Patel and Ravindra Jadeja , which allowed South Africa to get 50 runs that proved crucial in the end.For the second Test, Pant is now India’s 38th Test captain, and on the eve of the game, the maverick left-hander exuded a calmness we are not used to. It seemed there was a conscious effort to control his mind as questions kept flying in — even on his decision not to bowl Bumrah at Eden Gardens.“That’s the challenge of being a captain. You know every day that you’re going to be questioned. But eventually you’re going to do what you believe is right and trust that the person who has the ball will do the job for the team,” Pant said, trying to explain the Kolkata decision.While that is the decision-making part of the story, even when Pant batted in the second innings in Kolkata, one felt he wasn’t his cavalier self. Was it the pressure of leading the side? And more importantly, will Pant the captain compromise Pant the player?“I don’t think about that. I just want to give my 100 percent at whatever I’m doing and enjoy the game whenever I want to,” Pant said.The Delhi boy isn’t just one of India’s top batters; he has the added responsibility of keeping as well. It was a job that his hero MS Dhoni did with ease at the international level for over a decade, but the constant interrogation does take its toll. Pant feels “it’s about finding a balance”. “I want to be someone who gives that freedom, and I want people to learn and make the right decisions for the team eventually. And when it comes to decision making, my aim is to be a combination of the conventional and out-of-the-box. ”Red-ball captaincy has its own set of challenges, and Pant, despite his white-ball captaincy experience, is still learning the ropes in the longer version. When asked to analyse the two experiences, the new skipper said: “Red-ball cricket goes on for a longer period of time, and that’s why it gives you a better chance to come back. But at the same time, you have to keep your emotions in check and not let the game drift away from you for too long. You try to be as close to the game as possible during a pressure situation.”By the looks of it, Pant will have several chances to deal with “pressure situations” at a venue he considers special. “I made my ODI debut here, and I hope my first Test as captain goes well too.”We will know over the next few days if the new captain’s wish is granted and whether India end their Test-match assignments for the year on a winning note.","Rishabh Pant is now India’s 38th Test captain, and on the eve of the game, the maverick left-hander exuded a calmness we are not used to.

Inside Eden Debacle: How India missed many tricks during their shocking defeat

With regards to rotation, rest and recovery, the Indian team is the one team that everybody wants to play against. Jonty Rhodes

South Africa's Simon Harmer took 8 wickets against India in the first Test at the Eden Gardens. (PTI)

Home advantage is not just about the surface; home advantage is also what's happening in the stands Jonty Rhodes

Monty Panesar in 2012. Steve O'Keefe in 2017. Pairing of Matthew Kuhnemann and Nathan Lyon in 2023. Mitchell Santner and Ajaz Patel in 2024. And as Simon Harmer picked eight wickets in the first Test at the Eden Gardens in Kolkata, the hypothesis that India have issues against spin, at home, was solidified.The reasons for this are suggested to be multi-fold. First and foremost is that India are just not good players of spin. ""We are not the best players of spin going around in the world at this point in time. Most Western teams are better than India now because they come to India, they practice it a lot more, but we don't practice enough of it,"" said R Ashwin.Going hand-in-hand with that is the fact that not a lot of India's Test squad regulars play domestic cricket when opportunity presents itself. Former India batter Sunil Gavaskar has time and again advocated for return to domestic cricket. BCCI , too, has urged contracted players to make themselves available for domestic cricket unless there is a fitness concern.Ex-South Africa cricketer Jonty Rhodes agrees that not playing enough domestic cricket could be the reason behind the Test team's struggles against spin. ""Maybe they're not playing enough in spinning conditions. If I watch some state cricket in India, there's some great performers with the bat and we know that the surfaces at state level are fairly similar (to the Test matches),"" he told TimesofIndia.com exclusively on the sidelines of the FICCI Turf 2025 in New Delhi.""From an Indian conditions point of view, they're not conditioned, because they're playing so much international cricket, or even the different formats of the game, where we know in T20 and 50 overs, it's a good batting surface, and they're not tested from a spin point of view or skill wise, so that's possibly it.""​After India suffered a rare home Test series loss against New Zealand last year and also suffered against Australia Down Under, BCCI issued a set of guidelines. One of the 10 points required the players to have domestic cricket involvement. But can it be made mandatory, especially with a busy calendar as it is? Rhodes said finding a balance is important.""I got criticised when I missed a game in South Africa way back in 2000s, where there wasn't that much cricket. It happened to transpire that it was a busy year for the first time, because we were touring England in the winter, and I took a game off, and there was much consternation in the media that I'm not playing for my state,"" said the South African Rhodes.​​​""I don't know if you can enforce it,"" said Rhodes on whether the guideline can be made mandatory. ""Because with regards to rotation, rest and recovery, the Indian team is the one team that everybody wants to play against.""""Sometimes they have three different teams and three different formats, but sometimes the players cross over, and it's tough to say, okay, 'you've got a week off, go play a four-day state game', but it's ideal conditions-wise, conditioning-wise, it's a great place to go for an international player to go play some cricket, but how do you make that mandatory? That's the challenge. Because you'll have some people who require a break, and then fingers will be pointed, and so it's difficult to make everybody happy,"" added Rhodes who played 52 Tests and 245 ODIs for South Africa scoring 8467 runs. ​​​Another facet that needs to be considered in this debate are the surfaces which is an extension of an even larger issue in Indian cricket - lack of fixed Test centres. Unlike England, Australia and South Africa, BCCI have taken the game to different parts of the country but diluted their ability to create a foothold at certain stadiums.""Home advantage is not just about the surface; home advantage is also what's happening in the stands, so when you've got crowd support on your side, that is a big part of home advantage. I understand your point with regards to South Africa - we have 4 or 5 Test venues so when players go play a Test match in Durban or Pretoria or Johannesburg, Cape Town, they know what the surface is going to be, they can prepare, the batting surfaces and the nets are going to be exactly the same as what you would get in the middle, and maybe that is a difference.""But if you're a country like India that has this passion and love for cricket across the country, it's very difficult to say that these are the only Test venues or international venues that we're going to have, because you want to grow cricket,"" finished Rhodes.",South Africa beat India in the first Test at the Eden Gardens in Kolkata.

Rishabh Pant press conference: On Shubman Gill injury, India Playing XI, pitch and more

Poll Do you think Rishabh Pant will make a successful captain for the Test match against South Africa? Yes No, he is too inexperienced

Ricky Ponting has thrown his weight behind Rishabh Pant as the wicketkeeper-batter prepares to lead India in the series-deciding second Test against South Africa in Guwahati. With Shubman Gill ruled out due to injury after India’s 30-run defeat at Eden Gardens, Pant steps in for his first match as Test captain at a crucial stage of the contest.Ponting, who has worked closely with Pant during their time together at Delhi Capitals, said the role will not be straightforward given India’s position in the series. But he believes Pant’s vantage point as a wicketkeeper and his growth across formats will help him adapt.""It's never easy to come in and fill in for someone as a stopgap captain, especially when you've just lost a Test match a few days before. Rishabh is a reasonably experienced Test match player now though as well. I think being a wicket keeper probably helps to see the way that the game is evolving and what's happening in the game,"" Ponting said, as quoted by ICC.The former Australia captain highlighted Pant’s leadership experience in the IPL, where he previously captained Delhi Capitals before moving to Lucknow Super Giants, while Ponting himself moved to Punjab Kings.""He has done at IPL level now for the last few years, obviously done it in Delhi (Capitals) before that.I think he'll handle it fine,"" Ponting added.Thursday’s Test will also mark Pant’s first outing as captain in the longest format, despite having led in white-ball cricket.

: In a career spanning more than three decades in sports administration, KN Shanth Kumar has worn many hats. A former president of the Karnataka Olympic Association and ex-vice president of the Karnataka Badminton Association, he's been a steward of the Bangalore Turf Club as well as a council member of the Indian Golf Union. Shanth Kumar was also the non-playing captain of the Indian golf contingent at the 2002 Asian Games. He has now entered the fray for the president’s post at the Karnataka State Cricket Association and will go up against former India pacer Venkatesh Prasad in the forthcoming elections.In a freewheeling interview with TOI, the 64-year-old genial sports administrator and media-house owner spoke about throwing his hat in the KSCA ring and his vision for cricket.It's been in the air for some time. I've had conversations over the years. In fact, during the last two elections, for various reasons, things didn't fall in place. Although I have been blessed with some great opportunities in sports administration and sports journalism, initially, I was a little reluctant. I've seen a lot of sports all over the world, at different levels, and this time, I was convinced that this was a good time to get into it and give it a good shot.And I think I have it in me to lead a team. and we have an excellent teamI don't think I have any magic to offer. I believe a leader of the team is just the first among equals, who facilitates the coming together of people of different abilities, brings them together, gets the best out of them, and runs a successful organisation for the betterment of cricket.it was an unfortunate and tragic incident, but it is what it is and that’s where we stand now. The circumstances certainly add an extra challenge, and it did weigh on my mind. In fact, the people that I spoke to said it's going to be very difficult. I didn't want to back off because the association is in a difficult position. In the long term, I think I'm up for the challenge with a lot of help from everybody.I don't think we lack cricket expertise. We may not have international cricketers in our team, but we have people who have played a fairly good level of cricket within the state and zonal level. Also, if they’re not in the committee or among the office bearers, we will draw on their talents and ask them to be involved in the various committees.I don't know who you call outsiders. They’re all members and eligible to contest. When they begin, everyone is an outsider.Apart from cricketing ability, there are other things required to run an association. Yes, Cricket is at the heart of it. But you need to provide leadership, have experience in handling finance, administration etc.Also, for a number of years, I played sports, including cricket for the team we own, promoted sports in my own small way and covered sports as a photojournalist. I may be new to the association as an administrator, but I don’t see that as concern.Not all good athletes make great administrators. It's a question of at that point in time who's interested and who's willing to put in effort and give time. It's not a small job; it’s a difficult one that is also time-consuming.Brijesh (Patel) has been in the system for a long time and has done some excellent work. Brijesh has an enormous amount of goodwill and he will be our mentor. But that doesn’t means I'm not responsible. I'm certainly not a puppet; I’m far from it. If there's a good idea that’s coming from Brijesh, Anil Kumble, GR Vishwanath, EAS Prasanna, Rahul Dravid, or anybody else, I'll welcome it. They're all mentors, especially because they are international cricketers, our people, and we are proud of them. Brijesh has not only cricketing abilities, but he's also got tremendous administrative capabilities, which is a rare combination. We will take advice from him and all other stakeholders, but we will follow proper procedure.",Shanth Kumar is a former president of the Karnataka Olympic Association and ex- vice president of Karnataka Badminton Association.

Mumbai Indians IPL trades, retentions, releases, squad update: All eyes on captain Hardik Pandya

Mumbai: Jammu & Kashmir pacer Auqib Nabi, the second-highest wicket-taker in the 2025-26 edition Ranji Trophy with 29 wickets in five matches at an average of 13.27 and a best haul of 7/24 so far, appeared for trials with the Mumbai Indians at the high-profile IPL franchise's ground in Ghansoli on Friday.Nabi has never played in the IPL, though he was a net bowler for the Sunrisers Hyderabad a couple of years ago. The IPL auction will take place in Abu Dhabi on December 15.In the 2024-25 Ranji Trophy, Nabi, who hails from Baramulla, averaged 13.93 for his 44 wickets, and was the highest wicket-taker amongst the fast bowlers in India, and overall only second to Vidarbha's left-arm spinner Harsh Dubey.At the Duleep Trophy in August, Nabi grabbed the headlines, taking four wickets in four balls for North Zone against East Zone in Bengaluru's Centre of Excellence.A prolific swing bowler in domestic cricket, the 29-year-old has failed to earn a call-up to the India A squad so far. Nabi has never played in the IPL.He began the Ranji Trophy with a five-for (2/54 & 5/52) against Mumbai in Srinagar, then took seven for 24 against Rajasthan that earned J&K a bonus-point win, five for 35 to star in J&K's first-ever Ranji win over Delhi.In J&K's last match, he took four for 39 against Hyderabad to help J&K which helped his team record a massive 281-run win.With this level of consistency and impact, how much longer before Nabi gets a call-up to the India A squad?","Auqib Nabi has never played in the IPL, though he was a net bowler for the Sunrisers Hyderabad a couple of years ago.

Poll Should Vaibhav Suryavanshi have batted in the Super Over instead of the captain? Yes, he was the in-form batter. No, the captain made the right call.

India A’s Rising Stars Asia Cup 2025 semi-final ended in a mix of disbelief and backlash after the side collapsed to a Super Over defeat against Bangladesh A in Doha, with one of the biggest talking points being the decision to leave out Vaibhav Suryavanshi, their most in-form batter, from taking strike.The match, already marred by errors on both sides, only reached a Super Over because of Bangladesh’s own late meltdown. India needed four off the final ball when Harsh Dubey drilled a full delivery to long-on.The throw came in wide, and instead of holding the ball, wicketkeeper Akbar Ali attempted an underarm flick at the stumps and missed. India returned for a third run to tie the game at 194.That relief arrived after two earlier twists in the over, where Ashutosh Sharma launched a six, then being handed four more runs when Jishan dropped a straightforward chance at long-off. Rakibul Hasan still dragged the contest back by bowling Ashutosh, leaving India to scramble into the Super Over through Bangladesh’s last-ball mistake.But then came the decision that fuelled criticism. Despite Suryavanshi’s tournament-topping hitting, he was not sent out for the Super Over. Instead, captain Jitesh Sharma took strike with Ramandeep Singh. Jitesh fell first ball attempting a reverse lap. Ashutosh entered next, and one ball later skied a simple catch.India were bowled out for zero in two deliveries, which regardlessof the competition or format, is a rare occurrence.While the decision to leave out the teenage sensation remains unclear, it has drawn a lot of criticism, especially towards India A skipper Jitesh.Bangladesh needed just one run to close the game, but even that proved to be dramatic. Yasir Ali went for a big shot and was caught at long-on, giving India a glimmer. The next delivery however, took away all hope, as Suyash Sharma sent down a wide that sealed Bangladesh’s place in the final.While the errors from both sides make for big talking points, the decision to not send in Suryavanshi for the Super Over proved to be the most catastrophic. The way the skipper's decision to open backfired only made things worse.With the result, India have been eliminated from the competition, and the winners of the Pakistan A vs Sri Lanka A will take on Bangladesh in the final on Sunday, November 23 in Doha.","India A lost to Bangladesh A in the Rising Stars Asia Cup 2025 semi-final.

Ben Stokes press conference: On sledging India, staying in bed for two days, Manchester pitch, rain

England cricket captain Ben Stokes claimed five wickets for 23 runs in six overs on Day 1 of the first Ashes Test against Australia at the Optus Stadium in Perth, becoming the fifth English captain to achieve this feat in Australia. The historic day saw 19 wickets fall, the most in an opening day of an Ashes match in the last century.England, after winning the toss and choosing to bat first, were bowled out for 172 runs, with Harry Brook scoring 52 runs and Ollie Pope contributing 46. Australian pacer Mitchell Starc dominated with exceptional figures of 7 wickets for 58 runs.In response, Australia struggled to 123 for 9 at stumps, trailing England by 49 runs. Nathan Lyon (3) and Brendan Doggett (0) remained unbeaten at the crease.Stokes, who had a disappointing performance with the bat, redeemed himself by dismissing Travis Head, Cameron Green, Alex Carey, Mitchell Starc, and Scott Boland. His performance puts him in an elite group alongside former England captains George Allen, John William Douglas, Frederick Brown, and Robert Willis.The English bowling attack saw strong support from Jofra Archer and Brydon Carse, who each claimed two wickets.For Australia, Alex Carey (26) and Cameron Green (24) were the top scorers in their struggling innings.Stokes has now accumulated 235 wickets in 116 matches at an average of 31.06, including six five-wicket hauls in his career.The dramatic day of cricket produced the highest number of wickets to fall on an opening day of an Ashes Test match in the past 100 years, highlighting the bowlers' dominance from both teams.At stumps, the match remained delicately poised with England holding a slight advantage, having secured a first-innings lead with Australia still one wicket remaining.","England captain Ben Stokes claimed five wickets for 23 runs in six overs on Day 1 of the first Ashes Test against Australia.

Pep Guardiola believes Manchester City are entering the phase where the title race truly begins, with the champions looking to close the gap on league leaders Arsenal this weekend. City travel to Newcastle on Saturday knowing a win would take them to within a point of the Gunners, who face Tottenham the following day.Speaking ahead of the trip to St James’ Park, Guardiola said the coming stretch, which is free from international breaks, often decides how the season shapes up. “Now the international break is done so we'll be (together) until March, see each other every three days, four days. Now the real, real season starts,” he said.City cut Arsenal’s advantage to four points before the break after their 3-0 win over Liverpool, a result that followed Arsenal dropping points at Sunderland. Guardiola admitted the momentum shift mattered, especially given how strongly Arsenal have started.He stressed that allowing Mikel Arteta’s side to extend their lead could make the run-in far more difficult. “The feeling that I had in the past when we fought incredibly against Liverpool, I had the feeling that we'll not drop many points and if they can take a lot of distance it will be difficult to catch up,” he said.He referenced how similar the scenario felt to last season’s chase involving Liverpool, adding: “It was similar with Liverpool last season. ”But Guardiola also made it clear that nothing is settled in November. “There's two parts of the season, when the transfer window is over in summer and after, when the international break is over,” he said. The aim, he added, is simply to stay within striking distance. “The important thing is to be there, to be close there and after that arrive at the end of the season with the chance that we can fight for it.”A win at Newcastle, he said, would be another step in that direction. “That is the target and of course winning tomorrow would be an important step for us.”City will be without Mateo Kovacic and Rodri for the match. “Everybody is fit except Kova and Rodri,” Guardiola confirmed, adding that Rodri was “making steps good” in his recovery.Newcastle host Manchester City on Saturday, with Arsenal facing Tottenham a day later in the Premier League.",Manchester City travel to Newcastle on Saturday in the Premier League.

Poll Do you think Scotland can make a significant impact in the 2026 World Cup? Definitely! Maybe, with the right preparation Unlikely, not strong enough I have no opinion

Scotland captain Andy Robertson revealed emotional thoughts about his late Liverpool teammate Diogo Jota after Scotland secured qualification for the 2026 World Cup by defeating Denmark 4-2 on Tuesday, marking their first World Cup appearance since 1998.Scotland's victory came through goals from Scott McTominay, Lawrence Shankland, Kieran Tierney, and Kenny McLean in the match against Denmark at their home ground.Robertson shared his deep emotional connection to the achievement, particularly thinking about his former teammate Jota, who died at 28 in a car accident in July.""I've hidden it well, but today I've been in bits,"" Robertson told the BBC. ""I know the age I'm at, this could be my last chance to go to the World Cup. I couldn't get my mate Diogo Jota out of my head today.""""We talked so much about going to the World Cup because he missed the last one with Portugal and I did with Scotland. I know he'll be smiling down on me today. I'm so glad it's ended up this way.""""This group of boys, this group of staff – it's the best group I've been involved in. The manager's speech before the game was unbelievable. We were quite emotional. To do it for him, the staff, and all our families, it'll go down as one of the greatest nights of my life.""Jota had missed the 2022 World Cup in Qatar due to a calf injury, and the two players had shared dreams of making it to the tournament with their respective countries.McTominay opened the scoring for Scotland with a spectacular bicycle kick goal three minutes into the match, exciting the home crowd.McLean sealed the victory with an impressive strike from the half-way line in the final moments of the game, securing Scotland's place in the North American World Cup.Portugal, Jota's national team, had also secured their qualification for the 2026 World Cup with a 9-1 win over Armenia on Sunday.The 2026 FIFA World Cup will be hosted jointly by the United States, Canada, and Mexico.","Scotland secured qualification for the 2026 World Cup by defeating Denmark 4-2 on Tuesday.

FIFA Shuts Down Trump's 2026 World Cup 'Unsafe Cities' Threat With Bold Remark

Poll Do you think Curacao's qualification for the World Cup will inspire other small nations in football? Yes, definitely! Possibly, but it depends on circumstances. Not really, it's a unique case. No, small nations face too many challenges.

In one of the most extraordinary nights in CONCACAF football history, the tiny Caribbean island of Curacao — home to just 156,000 people — scripted an unprecedented chapter by becoming the smallest country ever to qualify for the FIFA World Cup . Their tense 0-0 draw against Jamaica in Kingston on Tuesday was enough to secure passage to the 2026 finals in the United States, Canada and Mexico.The result capped a dramatic, nerve-wracking finale to the qualifiers, where Curacao survived relentless pressure from Jamaica — who struck the woodwork three times in the second half — and escaped a last-minute penalty scare. Salvadoran referee Ivan Barton initially pointed to the spot after Jeremy Antonisse clipped Dujuan Richards inside the box, but VAR overturned the call in a stunning twist that preserved Curacao’s historic dream.Coached by veteran Dutch tactician Dick Advocaat, who missed the clash due to a family emergency, the ‘Blue Wave’ finished atop Group B with 12 points from six matches, one clear of Jamaica. Curacao now surpass Iceland (population ~350,000 in 2018) as the smallest nation to ever reach a World Cup — a milestone made possible in the first edition featuring 48 teams.Elsewhere, the night produced more fairytale scenes. Haiti, forced to play “home” matches in Curacao due to political unrest, sealed their first World Cup appearance since 1974 after a crucial 2-0 win over Nicaragua.Goals from Louicius Don Deedson and Ruben Providence, combined with Honduras’ goalless draw against Costa Rica, lifted Haiti to the top of Group C with 11 points.Meanwhile, Panama secured the final automatic CONCACAF berth with a dominant 3-0 win over El Salvador, extinguishing Suriname’s hopes despite their qualification for the playoffs.For Curacao, the smallest of football nations, a World Cup dream once thought impossible is now gloriously real — a landmark for the island, the Caribbean, and world football itself.","Smallest nation to qualify for the World Cup, Curacao, beats Costa Rica 1-0. First time in history that two nations have qualified for the same tournament. The first time that two teams from the same country have done so.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125426769,imgsize-106144,width-400,resizemode-4/curacao.jpg"

Kieran Tierney and Kenny McLean scored spectacular injury-time goals to give Scotland a dramatic 4-2 victory over Denmark on Tuesday, sealing their qualification for the 2026 World Cup. Spain also confirmed their spot after a 2-2 draw with Turkey. Belgium joined them with a 7-0 demolition of Liechtenstein, while Switzerland and Austria both secured their places after picking up draws. All five nations will feature at the tournament in the United States, Canada and Mexico next year.Scotland’s late surge in Glasgow ensured Steve Clarke’s team reached the World Cup for the first time since 1998. With the match tied at 2-2 beyond the 90th minute, Denmark were on course to progress as Group C winners until Tierney curled in a superb long-range strike three minutes into stoppage time. McLean settled the contest deep into added time, lofting the ball over Kasper Schmeichel from the halfway line in the 98th minute after spotting the Danish goalkeeper far off his line.“That just sums up this squad,” captain Andy Robertson told the BBC. “Never say die. We just keep going right to the end and one of the craziest games. We put the country through it, but I’m sure it’s worth it. We’re going to the World Cup.”Scotland made the perfect start when Scott McTominay scored with an overhead kick in the third minute.Rasmus Hojlund equalised for Denmark from the penalty spot just before the hour, but the visitors were reduced to 10 men soon after when Rasmus Kristensen received a second yellow card. Hampden Park erupted again in the 78th minute as Lawrence Shankland tapped in from close range, only for Patrick Dorgu to level four minutes later. Tierney and McLean then delivered the decisive blows. Denmark now head to Thursday’s draw for the European play-offs, scheduled for March.Switzerland booked their sixth straight World Cup appearance after a 1-1 draw in Pristina against Kosovo. Needing only to avoid a heavy defeat, they stayed in control for most of the match. Ruben Vargas put them ahead early in the second half, before Florent Muslija equalised.Spain, the Euro 2024 champions, also needed to avoid a seven-goal loss in Seville against Turkey and never looked in danger. Dani Olmo opened the scoring, though Deniz Gul and Salih Ozcan found the net for Turkey to hand Spain their first goals conceded in qualifying. Mikel Oyarzabal equalised after the hour to preserve Spain’s unbeaten run. “We wanted to finish with a win and a clean sheet, so it’s bitter-sweet... but we’re happy to qualify for the World Cup,” Olmo told TVE.Austria snatched a place at their first World Cup in 28 years after a 1-1 draw with Bosnia and Herzegovina, thanks to Michael Gregoritsch’s 77th-minute equaliser. Haris Tabakovic’s early strike had threatened to upset Ralf Rangnick’s side before the leveller sent Bosnia into the play-offs. “I can’t believe it; we made it! I have been trying to reach the World Cup for 18 years. Finally now, at the end of my career, we got there. I can’t wait,” said 36-year-old Marko Arnautovic, via UEFA.com.Belgium, semi-finalists in 2018, eased into the World Cup draw with a dominant win in Liege. Jeremy Doku scored twice, Charles De Ketelaere added a brace of his own and Hans Vanaken, Brandon Mechele and Alexis Saelemaekers also found the net. Wales matched that scoreline in Group J, beating North Macedonia 7-1, with Harry Wilson recording a hat-trick from set pieces. North Macedonia will still feature in the play-offs thanks to their Nations League ranking. Romania, who defeated San Marino 7-0, will also head to the play-offs after finishing third in Group H, and Sweden secured their own spot with a 1-1 draw against Slovenia.The European play-offs will feature 16 teams and offer four additional berths for next year’s World Cup in North America.","Kieran Tierney and Kenny McLean scored spectacular injury-time goals to give Scotland a dramatic 4-2 victory over Denmark on Tuesday.

A Women's Super League referee Lisa Benn told a London employment tribunal that she lost her international position after reporting that a referee coach pushed her during a game in March 2023. She claimed the Professional Game Match Officials Limited (PGMOL) gave her lower recommendations after she complained about coach Steve Child's conduct, BBC reported.The incident occurred at a PGMOL tournament focused on video assistant referee (VAR) training. After a delay due to an injury, Benn says Child grabbed her arm and pushed her onto the pitch to start a game.During the match, Child told a fourth official to instruct Benn to ""kill the game."" Benn responded by saying ""don't tell me how to referee"" and used an expletive towards Child.""I am a trusted referee, I referee at the highest level - this was an under-19s game,"" Benn told the panel.""He felt superior, he felt like he could come on and tell me how to referee, he manhandled me on to the field of play - he would never have done that to a male referee,"" she stated.When questioned if she had witnessed Child behaving similarly with other referees, Benn responded: ""I have to female referees, yes.I haven't to male referees.""Benn claims Child approached her after the game, grabbed her arm and said ""your card has been marked.""""He was so angry his eyes were bulging out of his head,"" she told the tribunal, as cited by BBC.PGMOL's representative Jesse Crozier suggested Child may have simply guided her to the pitch, but Benn rejected this explanation.Crozier stated: ""If you had been dragged, grabbed and pushed at a training tournament with dozens and dozens of people, someone would have seen it."" Benn disagreed with this assessment.A PGMOL investigation determined Child's actions did not warrant disciplinary measures. Benn claims that while PGMOL's chief refereeing officer Howard Webb and his wife Bibiana Steinhaus-Webb, then head of women's referees, assured her she would not face consequences for reporting the incident, the organization subsequently reduced their support for her.Benn states this reduced support resulted in her losing a position on FIFA's international referee list.The tribunal proceedings are ongoing.",Lisa Benn told a London employment tribunal that she lost her international position after reporting that a referee coach pushed her during a game in March 2023.

Poll Who do you think is in the right in the PSG vs Kylian Mbappe feud? Kylian Mbappe Paris Saint-Germain Both sides equally Neither side is right

The long-simmering feud between Paris Saint-Germain and Kylian Mbappe erupted into a full-blown legal and financial battle on Monday as both sides arrived at an industrial court with staggering monetary demands — together exceeding €700 million.The French superstar, who joined Real Madrid on a free transfer in the summer of 2024, claims PSG owes him more than €260 million. This includes unpaid wages, bonuses, severance, and damages, all stemming from his argument that his fixed-term contract should be reclassified as a permanent one — a technical shift that would entitle him to compensation for unfair dismissal.Mbappe had earlier demanded €55 million in unpaid wages. His new claim now encompasses much more, including allegations of moral harassment, undeclared work, and breaches of PSG's duty of good faith and workplace safety.“Kylian Mbappe is not asking for anything beyond what the law provides; he is simply seeking the enforcement of his legal rights, as any employee would,” his advisers said in a statement. The forward did not attend the hearing in person.PSG responded with an even larger counter-claim: €440 million. The club argues that Mbappe's refusal to extend his contract — while also rejecting a €300 million offer from Saudi side Al-Hilal in 2023 — cost them a massive “loss of opportunity” to secure a record transfer fee. The Ligue 1 champions also seek compensation for alleged breaches of good faith, reputational harm, and image damage.The club said it presented evidence that Mbappe acted “disloyally” by hiding his decision not to extend his contract for nearly a year — from July 2022 to June 2023 — leaving PSG powerless to negotiate a transfer.PSG further accused the striker of reneging on an August 2023 agreement involving a salary reduction should he leave on a free transfer. Mbappe's camp insists such an agreement never existed, and says PSG failed to provide proof.The forward has also accused the club of “lofting” — a French term describing the isolation of a player from the main squad. Mbappe was excluded from the preseason tour to Japan and South Korea and initially left out of Ligue 1's opening match after informing the club he would not trigger his extension clause.PSG has denied any harassment or mistreatment, insisting Mbappe featured in “more than 94%” of official matches that season under a coach who went on to win the Champions League.The court's ruling is expected next month, with both sides bracing for one of football's most financially explosive verdicts.","Kylian Mbappe claims PSG owes him more than €260 million.

Poll Which team do you believe has the best chance of winning the World Cup in 2026? Germany Netherlands France Brazil

Germany and the Netherlands sealed their World Cup berths in emphatic fashion on Monday, producing goal-laden performances in their final European qualifying matches to underline their status as major contenders for next year’s global showpiece in the United States, Canada and Mexico.Julian Nagelsmann’s Germany destroyed Slovakia 6-0 in Leipzig, while Ronald Koeman’s Netherlands swept past Lithuania 4-0 in Amsterdam. Both teams needed only a draw to secure qualification but showed zero appetite for caution.“Every player played well today and worked like a dog,” Nagelsmann told German broadcaster ZDF after his side overwhelmed Group A rivals. Four-time world champions Germany, level on points with Slovakia before kick-off, seized command early. Nick Woltemade headed the opener in the 18th minute, and once Serge Gnabry doubled the lead, the hosts never looked back. Leroy Sane struck twice before half-time, with Ridle Baku and Assan Ouedraogo completing the rout after the break.“We’re relieved. It’s a great moment,” a jubilant Woltemade told ZDF. “I’m playing, I’m scoring goals and I’m hopefully playing at the World Cup.”Elsewhere in Group A, Northern Ireland beat Luxembourg 1-0 but remained third.However, their Nations League ranking guarantees them a place in March’s 16-team European play-offs.In Amsterdam, the Netherlands delivered a high-tempo masterclass that thrilled more than 50,000 fans. Lithuania were pinned deep from the start, with Tijani Reijnders finishing off a neat move initiated by Frenkie de Jong to open the scoring. A superb first-half display by goalkeeper Edvinas Gertmonas delayed the inevitable, but Cody Gakpo’s 58th-minute penalty unlocked the floodgates. Xavi Simons and Donyell Malen struck in quick succession as Koeman’s men cruised.Reijnders, who did not debut until after the 2022 Qatar World Cup, savoured the moment. “I watched it at home, on the couch, with my Oranje shirt on,” he said. “This time it’s going to be very different for me… I’m really looking forward to taking part for the first time.”In other matches, Croatia—already assured of Group L’s top spot—fought back to beat Montenegro 3-2, while the Czech Republic thrashed Gibraltar 6-0. Poland survived a scare in Malta, edging out a chaotic 3-2 encounter but finishing second in Group G behind the Dutch.","Germany and the Netherlands have clinched their World Cup berths.

Chiefs assistant takes aim at Trump, saying he misread the entire kickoff rule before calling it ‘demeaning’





Chiefs coach fires back at President Donald Trump criticizing NFL kickoff rule: 'I hope he hears it'

The debate over the NFL’s modern kickoff rule picked up new heat when Donald Trump blasted the league for altering a play he believes defines the rhythm of football. His comments triggered a firm pushback from Kansas City Chiefs special teams coach Dave Toub, who dismissed the criticism with rare bluntness. Toub has guided Kansas City’s special teams for more than a decade, and he was in no mood to entertain arguments he felt overlooked player safety and the reality of today’s game.When asked about Trump’s remarks, Toub did not hesitate. The 63-year-old coach said the president’s opinion simply missed the point and added that the comments carried no weight with him. His response set the tone for a discussion that has now extended beyond football strategy and into the value of evolving the sport to protect players.The NFL has been reshaping the kickoff in back-to-back seasons as the league tries to reduce head injuries and keep the play alive. Internal data showed concussions on kickoffs dropped by nearly 43 percent with the new approach. The league also reported an 81.3 percent return rate this season, a sharp rise from previous years. Still, Trump argued the changes robbed the sport of its identity. Appearing on The Pat McAfee Show, he called the NFL kickoff “terrible” and “demeaning,” adding in the interview, “I hate the kickoff in football.He expanded on that frustration by saying, “I think it’s so terrible. I think it’s so demeaning. I think it hurts the game, it hurts the pageantry. I’ve told that to Roger Goodell. And I don’t think it’s any safer. I mean, you still have guys crashing into each other. It’s the opposite of what the game – the ball is in the air, nobody’s moving. It’s supposed to be when the ball is in the air, when the ball is played, you’re supposed to be moving. The pageantry of the game is so badly hurt.”Toub pushed back with force. “He doesn’t even know what he’s looking at. He has no idea what’s going on with the kickoff rule,” he said. “Take that for what it’s worth. I hope he hears it.”Toub’s stance carries weight in Kansas City, where he also serves as assistant head coach to Andy Reid. He has coached Harrison Butker, one of the Chiefs’ most productive scorers and an outspoken Trump supporter. Even with those ties, Toub kept the focus on safety and the future of the game.Also Read: Travis Kelce addresses retirement rumors, promises no offseason limbo while the Chiefs slip in standings",Kansas City Chiefs special teams coach Dave Toub responds to Donald Trump's criticism of the NFL's kickoff rule.

Travis Kelce shows why the Chiefs still rely on him



Kansas City is watching closely as Travis Kelce enters a stage of his career that feels both familiar and uncertain. The tight end is in the final year of his deal and understands the weight that comes with every snap. At 36, Kelce knows a choice is coming, yet he refuses to leave the franchise confused about what happens after this season. He told reporters that the decision will arrive only when the time is right, but it will not drag into the offseason and disrupt the team’s plans.""I want to give the Chiefs a good opportunity, whether I come back or not or whether they want me back or not,"" Kelce said, via ESPN. ""I'd like to make that decision before they've got to get draft picks and free agency opens to fill the roster appropriately. All that will be at the end of the season. I won't be thinking about it until then.""Kelce may be deep into his thirteenth season, yet his production tells a different story. He leads the Chiefs with 50 catches for 631 yards and four touchdowns in ten games. His numbers continue to place him among the best ever at his position. He ranks third on the all-time list for tight ends with 12,782 receiving yards, trailing Jason Witten and Tony Gonzalez, while already holding Kansas City’s records for receptions, yards and touchdowns.His legacy grows even larger in January. Kelce owns the NFL postseason record for receptions with 178 and stands beside Jerry Rice and Michael Irvin as the only players to lead three Super Bowl winners in receiving yards. His connection with Patrick Mahomes has produced 18 playoff touchdowns, the most by any duo in league history.The road back to this season began after the painful Super Bowl LIX defeat. Kelce admitted that the loss pushed him to lace up again. ""It was probably the biggest factor,"" he said on his return, via NFL.com. ""I mean, it's a pretty cool way to go out, but I just think I would still have this love for the game. I think I would have thought about it more if we would've won.""This year has brought new challenges. The Chiefs sit at 5-5, but Kelce refuses to let frustration define the locker room. ""Every single day is a new challenge and I love that,"" he said. He praised the group’s bond and even after breaking a franchise record, he brushed off the personal milestone. “If you’re going to ask me about the record, I could care less about that right now,” he told reporters.His focus remains clear. ""I think the biggest thing is that I f-----g love playing the game of football,"" Kelce said earlier this offseason.

Despite his on-field confidence, Allen admitted to being very nervous, fearing Steinfeld would discover his hidden plans. He described tearing up throughout the day, anticipating their special moment and ultimately asking her to marry him with a heartfelt plea.

How Josh Allen’s nerves, hidden plans, and a tear-filled day shaped his proposal to Hailee Steinfeld

Josh Allen and Hailee Steinfeld may have kept their romance private for nearly two years, but the Buffalo Bills star is finally giving fans a closer look at one of the biggest moments of their relationship, the proposal that changed everything. Their love story has unfolded alongside two fast-rising careers: Allen leading Buffalo as one of the NFL’s most dynamic quarterbacks, and Steinfeld stepping deeper into Hollywood prestige with award-winning performances.By the time they married in May 2025, they had already built a foundation rooted in privacy, timing, and mutual respect. Now, through Steinfeld’s Beau Society newsletter, the couple is peeling back the curtain and sharing the raw, emotional details behind the day Allen asked her to marry him.In her December newsletter, Steinfeld affectionately introduced him as her “FIANCE, Mr. Josh Allen,” before asking the question fans have always wondered: was he nervous before proposing? Despite being unshakeable on the field, Allen admitted the truth came with shaky hands.“I was very nervous,” he said, revealing his biggest fear wasn’t rejection—it was Steinfeld catching him in the act. “I think I was most nervous about you finding out about the proposal.It was hard to keep secrets from you and have other people in your life keep secrets from you.""The quarterback described how the anticipation hit him throughout the day. “Then multiple times throughout the day, a song would come on, and I would tear up thinking about how special our day was going to be.”When Steinfeld asked what he remembered most, Allen didn’t hesitate to revisit the exact moment. “I said I couldn't wait any longer. I said I can't wait to start a family with you. I said your full name, and I asked you very nicely. I said please…You were extremely surprised, you said yes, and that was all that mattered to me. And the sun was out.”The couple, who went public in summer 2024, has since embraced sharing glimpses of their life, Steinfeld cheering on Buffalo from the sidelines and openly speaking about wanting children. For Allen, whose MVP-level season has only amplified his profile, the proposal marks a deeper shift: a personal milestone that even NFL pressure can’t overshadow.Also Read: “Trying to hide a pregnancy”: Josh Allen’s wife Hailee Steinfeld mocked by NFL fans after unusual outfit fuels pregnancy chatter","Josh Allen and Hailee Steinfeld have kept their romance private for nearly two years.

Kim Kardashian sparks new controversy with All’s Fair’s Taylor Swift–coded episode title as Travis Kelce stays out of the drama,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/kim-kardashian-sparks-new-controversy-with-alls-fairs-taylor-swiftcoded-episode-title-as-travis-kelce-stays-out-of-the-drama/articleshow/125486483.cms,"The latest episode of Hulu's All's Fair, titled 'This Is Me Trying,' shares its name with a Taylor Swift song, sparking speculation due to the long-standing Swift-Kardashian feud. This connection, whether intentional or coincidental, has reignited public interest in the legal drama, drawing attention to its themes of empowerment and shifting power dynamics.

How the Swift–Kardashian history intensifies the reaction

The latest episode of All’s Fair arrived on Hulu with a title that instantly sent pop-culture detectives into overdrive. Episode 5, This Is Me Trying, shares its name with one of Taylor Swift ’s most emotional tracks and given Kim Kardashian’s prominent role in the series, longtime fans of both stars immediately spotted the potential tension.The Swift–Kardashian rift has been one of entertainment’s most public feuds, shaping internet culture, fan discourse, and even music narratives for nearly a decade. So when a legal drama led by Kardashian suddenly drops an episode titled after a Swift song, the moment feels too loaded, too specific, and too close to cultural history for viewers to ignore. Whether intentional or coincidence, the choice has undeniably reignited curiosity.Part of what fuels the conversation is how deeply intertwined Swift’s work has become with her experiences during the feud. Her song choices, visuals, and storytelling often reflect periods of turmoil or rebirth, and fans understand exactly why This Is Me Trying hits a sensitive chord.The line between fiction and real-life recollection grows thinner when linked back to the explosive fallout from Kanye West’s Famous, Kim Kardashian’s leaked footage, and Swift’s firm pushback.In her own words, she reminded fans, “That moment when Kanye West secretly records your phone call, then Kim posts it on the Internet… You don’t get to control someone’s emotional response to being called ‘that b*tch’ in front of the entire world. ”While All’s Fair doesn’t address the feud directly, Kardashian’s casting and the Swift-coded title create a perfect storm of speculation. For some viewers, it feels like a cheeky wink; for others, an unfortunate coincidence. But the buzz benefits the show either way, drawing new eyes to Ryan Murphy’s legal drama about a group of women breaking away to build their own firm, a narrative already rich with tension, empowerment, and shifting power dynamics.Episode 6 arrives November 25, and with the conversation now louder than ever, many fans will tune in wondering whether this was a one-off title choice or the beginning of something more pointed.Also Read: “Children with inherited CTE”: Fans outraged after article targets Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce’s future kids with offensive jokes","The latest episode of Hulu's All's Fair, titled 'This Is Me Trying,' shares its name with a Taylor Swift song, sparking speculation.

Joe Burrow latest injury update: Bengals face pressure as quarterback pushes toward potential Week 12 return,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/update-on-joe-burrow-bengals-face-pressure-as-quarterback-pushes-toward-potential-week-12-return/articleshow/125485886.cms,"Cincinnati Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow is practicing again. His return to the field is generating excitement. Coach Zac Taylor is carefully considering his availability for the upcoming game. The team has a deadline to decide on activating Burrow. Teammates are optimistic about his performance. The Bengals are preparing for his potential impact.

Why the Bengals must weigh urgency against caution in deciding Joe Burrow’s status

As the Cincinnati Bengals inch closer to their Week 12 showdown against the New England Patriots, all eyes remain on Joe Burrow and his increasingly encouraging return to practice. The quarterback, who has spent weeks recovering on injured reserve, logged two full practices in a row by Nov. 20, a milestone that instantly reignited questions about whether he could suit up on Nov. 23.Inside the facility, Burrow’s presence has noticeably lifted the team’s energy, but head coach Zac Taylor remains cautious, refusing to rush a decision as the Bengals weigh health, timing, and roster logistics. With a looming deadline to activate Burrow and a critical AFC matchup ahead, Cincinnati finds itself balancing hope with responsibility.Burrow looked comfortable early on Nov. 20, participating in his usual pre-practice quarterback–center exchange with Ted Karras before taking a full workload for the second straight day. His return began when Cincinnati opened his 21-day window on Nov. 10, giving the team until Dec. 1 to decide whether he can rejoin the 53-man roster or remain sidelined for the rest of the season. If the Bengals activate him before the 4 p.m.deadline on Nov. 22, it would signal strong optimism about his readiness against the Patriots.Still, Taylor is refusing to commit. Speaking on WLW, he stressed patience when asked directly about Burrow’s status: “One day at practice isn’t going to lead to that decision yet. We will use the time we have at our disposal and come up with the best decision we can.” Even when pressed, Taylor emphasized that it's his job “to balance all of the information and protect the player.”Inside the locker room, however, teammates feel momentum growing. With Ja’Marr Chase suspended for one game, Tee Higgins is expected to be Burrow’s top target and he likes what he sees. “He's practicing like he was Week 1… Joe's been looking outstanding. He's slinging it deep, short routes − everything's been pretty good,"" Higgins said.Whether Burrow plays remains undecided, but the confidence around him suggests Cincinnati is preparing for the possibility and bracing for the impact of his return.Also Read: Are Lamar Jackson and Hollywood icon Samuel L.

Donald Trump’s pursuit of celebrity validation dragged Brittany Mahomes into an unexpected political storm,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/donald-trumps-pursuit-of-celebrity-validation-dragged-brittany-mahomes-into-an-unexpected-political-storm/articleshow/125485694.cms,"Donald Trump's pursuit of celebrity endorsements unexpectedly drew Brittany Mahomes and Sydney Sweeney into the political spotlight. Mahomes' subtle social media activity was amplified by Trump, creating a stir, while Sweeney's Republican registration delighted him. These instances highlight Trump's focus on star power over policy, turning minor interactions into significant political narratives.

Donald Trump’s hunger for star endorsements put Brittany Mahomes and Sydney Sweeney in the spotlight

Long before the 2024 election cycle intensified, one of the more unexpected political dust-ups involved former president Donald Trump and Kansas City Chiefs WAG Brittany Mahomes. The story resurfaced months later, partly because it revealed just how intensely Trump courted and weaponized celebrity approval.At the time, fans noticed Brittany had quietly interacted with posts tied to Trump’s 2024 platform, a move that immediately clashed with her public friendship with Taylor Swift , who had endorsed Kamala Harris and urged voters to choose “calm and not chaos.” What followed was a spectacle fueled less by policy and more by Trump’s fixation on star power, turning a small digital interaction into a headline-making moment.Once fans detected Brittany Mahomes’ likes on Trump-aligned posts, including one supporting “Trump-Vance 2024”, online speculation erupted. Many wondered whether political differences would threaten the high-profile camaraderie between Mahomes and Swift. Trump, however, didn’t wait for the conversation to unfold naturally.He rushed to Truth Social, triumphantly posting, “I want to thank beautiful Brittany Mahomes for so strongly defending me, and the fact that MAGA is the greatest and most powerful Political Movement in the History of our now Failing Country.”He doubled down during a Fox News appearance, adding, “I actually like Mrs. Mahomes much better… She’s a big Trump fan. I was not a Taylor Swift fan.” The moment underscored something observers had long noted: Trump saw celebrity backing as political currency.That same instinct emerged again when he learned actress Sydney Sweeney was a registered Republican amid backlash surrounding her American Eagle campaign. Caught off guard yet thrilled, he said, “She’s a registered Republican? Oh, now I love her ad… If Sydney Sweeney is a registered Republican, I think her ad is fantastic.”Predictably, he took the celebration back to Truth Social, calling her spot the “HOTTEST” and urging fans to buy the jeans.In hindsight, these episodes illustrated how Trump’s need for cultural relevance often overshadowed the political moment itself. Brittany Mahomes’ casual social-media engagement wasn’t a policy endorsement, but Trump’s amplification turned it into a firestorm, pulling a sports celebrity into a political narrative she never publicly claimed.Also Read: “Not be able to walk”: Patrick Mahomes’ mom Randi shares emotional health confession after completing challenging Colorado hike","Donald Trump's hunger for star endorsements put Brittany Mahomes and Sydney Sweeney in the spotlight.

Sabrina Carpenter snubs Taylor Swift’s long-anticipated Marvel debut as she shifts focus to planning her fairytale wedding with Travis Kelce,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/sabrina-carpenter-snubs-taylor-swifts-long-anticipated-marvel-debut-as-she-shifts-focus-to-planning-her-fairytale-wedding-with-travis-kelce/articleshow/125485289.cms,"Pop culture is abuzz as Sabrina Carpenter reportedly meets with Marvel for the Dazzler role, reigniting debate over Taylor Swift's potential casting. Fans long envisioned Swift as the music-powered mutant, citing her stage presence and pop icon status. While Carpenter offers a fresh take, Swift's connection to Dazzler remains a captivating 'what if' for many.

Taylor Swift’s name refuses to leave the Dazzler conversation





Pop culture fans are buzzing again and this time, Taylor Swift is right at the center of the conversation. Fresh reports suggesting Sabrina Carpenter has met with Marvel Studios about joining the MCU as Dazzler have reopened a debate that has been simmering for years: should Swift have been the one to bring the glittering, music-powered mutant to life?With Marvel’s long-anticipated X-Men reboot finally gaining shape, the resurfaced rumors feel less like idle chatter and more like a missed opportunity for Swifties who believed their superstar was destined for the role. Carpenter’s rising momentum makes her a natural fit, but the fascination with Swift as Dazzler remains unmatched, fueled by her global visibility, magnetic stage presence, and long-rumored connection to the character.Even as Carpenter earns attention for reportedly stepping into Marvel’s orbit, Swift’s shadow looms large. The idea of Swift playing Dazzler became a fan obsession years ago, especially after Easter egg–hungry Marvel watchers connected her iconic pop persona to Alison Blaire’s disco-era flair.Swift has long embodied the kind of larger-than-life musical identity that made Dazzler more than just another mutant, she’s an entertainer first, a reluctant hero second. That duality mirrors Swift’s own evolution from country singer to global phenomenon, someone who commands stadiums yet fiercely protects her creative autonomy.The speculation only intensified after Swift appeared in Deadpool & Wolverine fan theories, with many convinced she would make a surprise MCU cameo.Although it never materialized, it showed how deeply fans associated the character with her. Dazzler’s signature ability, turning sound into shimmering bursts of light, felt almost too on-the-nose for Swift, whose concerts are already a choreographed explosion of music, color, and emotion.Carpenter, meanwhile, represents a newer generation of pop stardom, and her growing influence aligns neatly with Marvel’s push to refresh the X-Men for a modern audience. Her charm and performance style would certainly bring a youthful electricity to Alison Blaire. But Swift’s potential casting would have carried a sense of pop-culture inevitability, the merging of two massive fandoms at a pivotal moment in Marvel’s rebuilding era.If Carpenter does land the role, it will mark a major milestone in her career. Yet for many fans, the conversation will always return to Swift, because some MCU “what ifs” are simply too dazzling to forget.Also Read: “She doesn’t want to see him”: Taylor Swift refuses Joe Alwyn’s plea for closure as she happily moved on with Travis Kelce","Sabrina Carpenter reportedly met with Marvel Studios about playing Dazzler.

Concussion Protocol keeps Jaxson Dart out, Jameis Winston to lead Giants



The New York Giants will be without rookie quarterback Jaxson Dart for the Week 12 matchup against the Detroit Lions. Interim head coach Mike Kafka confirmed that Dart has not cleared the concussion protocol and will remain sidelined. Jameis Winston is set to start in place of the rookie, providing stability for the Giants’ offense while Dart continues recovery.Dart displayed limited progress during practices earlier in the week, creating optimism for a potential return. However, Thursday’s restricted session indicated that the quarterback is not yet ready for game action. In Week 11, Winston completed 19-of-29 passes for 201 yards with one interception, maintaining offensive consistency in Dart’s absence.The absence of Dart stems from insufficient recovery in the concussion protocol, rather than a precautionary decision. Kafka emphasized that full clearance is required before returning to play. With the Giants’ season largely beyond playoff contention, prioritizing Dart’s health and long-term development remains the primary focus.Winston will face the challenge of leading the Giants’ offense against a strong Lions defense.Experience and composure are critical in executing the game plan and maintaining continuity in the quarterback position. A return in Week 13 would provide Dart with five remaining games to gain on-field experience and further development toward becoming a potential franchise quarterback. The Giants’ coaching staff has stressed that rushing Dart back could jeopardize both his health and long-term prospects, making patience essential.This situation underscores the NFL’s increasing emphasis on concussion management and player safety. Teams are adopting a more cautious approach, ensuring athletes are fully cleared before returning to competitive action. The Giants’ decision reflects this philosophy, balancing immediate offensive needs with the long-term development and protection of Dart.Sunday’s matchup against the Lions will highlight Winston’s ability to lead while Dart continues the recovery process under strict concussion protocol guidelines. The team’s approach prioritizes both player safety and operational stability, keeping a measured strategy at the forefront of quarterback management for the remainder of the 2025 season.Also Read: NFL trade rumors: Las Vegas Raiders weigh Geno Smith exit, eye Alabama QB Ty Simpson in 2026 draft","The New York Giants will be without rookie quarterback Jaxson Dart for the Week 12 matchup against the Detroit Lions.

Ty Simpson rising as top 2026 NFL draft quarterback prospect for Raiders



Ty Simpson, Alabama's new starting quarterback, speaks with the media

The Las Vegas Raiders are in the spotlight again, and not for the right reasons. After another tough stretch of games, questions about the team’s quarterback situation are louder than ever. Geno Smith, brought in to provide stability, has struggled to maintain consistency in the offense. Turnovers, uneven decision-making, and a lack of offensive rhythm have raised questions about whether Smith can remain the long-term answer for the franchise.Smith’s current contract complicates the situation, with guaranteed money making an immediate move challenging. However, the possibility of a change at quarterback is now a topic of discussion within the organization. The Raiders are evaluating both short-term and long-term strategies to address a position that has been a revolving door for several seasons.Alabama quarterback Ty Simpson has emerged as a strong candidate to fill the Raiders’ quarterback needs. Known for his poise, accuracy, and ability to process defenses quickly, Simpson has gained attention as one of the top prospects in college football. His performance in high-pressure situations and demonstrated efficiency make him an appealing option for a team looking to secure a young, controllable quarterback.Las Vegas could also explore acquiring a veteran quarterback through trade, with names such as Kyler Murray or Mac Jones entering discussions if opportunities arise. This dual-path approach allows the Raiders to consider both immediate fixes and a sustainable long-term solution at the most crucial position in football.The Raiders’ quarterback carousel has been an ongoing challenge, and Smith’s arrival was expected to provide stability. Instead, inconsistent play has left the offense struggling to gain traction. Drafting Simpson would offer a cost-controlled alternative to build around, even if Smith remains under contract in 2026.As the season progresses, the Raiders face a crucial decision that could shape the franchise for years. Whether moving on from Smith via trade, acquiring a veteran, or investing in a rookie like Simpson, the organization is weighing options to finally resolve quarterback instability.

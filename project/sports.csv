Key law changes announced by MCC

Mandatory completion of final over

If a wicket falls during the last over of the day in multi-day cricket, the over must be finished.

MCC said the change restores drama and prevents incoming batters from escaping a testing period late in the day.

Wicketkeeper positioning clarified

Keepers will no longer be penalised for having gloves marginally ahead of the stumps during the bowler’s run-up.

The law now states that the wicketkeeper must be wholly behind the stumps only after the ball is released, aligning it with fielder positioning rules.

‘Bunny hop catch’ removed

Fielders going beyond the boundary may touch the ball only once while airborne and must then land fully inside the boundary for the remainder of the play.

If a fielder parries the ball from outside to a teammate inside and then steps out again, it will be ruled a boundary.

Laminated bats legalised in open-age cricket

Laminated bats — made by bonding multiple pieces of wood — are now permitted beyond junior levels.

MCC believes the move could help tackle rising bat costs, though elite players are still expected to use traditional single-willow bats.

New ball sizes for women’s and junior cricket

The governing body introduced Size 1, Size 2 and Size 3 balls.

While Size 1 (traditionally used in men’s cricket) remains unchanged, uniform margins now create clearer categories tailored to different levels of the game.

Overthrow defined for the first time

An overthrow is now officially described as a throw at the stumps to prevent runs or attempt a run-out.

Misfields near the boundary will no longer be treated as overthrows.

Fielding captain’s role in deliberate short runs

The fielding side gains additional authority to decide which batter faces the next ball in cases of deliberate short running, expanding existing provisions.

Ball considered ‘finally settled’ sooner

The ball will be deemed settled when held by any fielder or stationary on the ground.

It no longer has to be in the bowler’s or wicketkeeper’s hands.

NEW DELHI: In one of the most significant updates to cricket’s rulebook in recent years, the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) has announced 73 changes to the Laws of Cricket, with the amendments — the first new edition since 2022 — set to come into effect from October this year. The governing body said the revisions were aimed at keeping the laws “up to date and fit for the modern game” while ensuring greater clarity and inclusivity across formats and levels.Among the headline changes is a new rule mandating that the final over of a day in multi-day matches must be completed even if a wicket falls, a move MCC believes will preserve the drama and competitive balance of the game.The MCC explained that it was “unfair” when a fielding side took a late wicket but the batting team avoided sending out a new batter, adding that the unused deliveries only had to be made up the next day and often reduced the spectacle. Under the revised law, the over will now be bowled in full provided playing conditions remain suitable.The MCC said the sweeping revisions were shaped through consultations at its World Cricket Connects forum, including input from current and former women’s players as well as equipment manufacturers.(With inputs from PTI)",The Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) has announced 73 changes to the Laws of Cricket.

Are India favourites to win 2026 T20 World Cup? | Greenstone Lobo makes a HUGE PREDICTION

For a very long time, scoring 50 runs in the Powerplay — the first six overs — used to be the perfect platform for a big score in T20Is. Even in the 2024 T20 World Cup, the Rohit Sharma-Virat Kohli combo was looking at something in that range.In the current cycle, however, things seem to have changed drastically. With teams aiming at a total of 225 or above to feel secure on the smaller grounds in India, scoring at least 75 runs in that period has become the new normal. With both Rohit and Virat retiring from T20Is and the likes of Abhishek Sharma taking over, India have made that target look easy in recent times. The Punjab southpaw has had different partners — notably Sanju Samson and Shubman Gill — and now it seems like India may go in with Ishan Kishan for the World Cup.Abhishek has absolutely flourished, batting at a ridiculous strike rate of 194.97. While Abhishek’s fearless bat swing and ability to clear the fence with ease has the cricket world in awe, India seem to have stumbled upon Kishan late by a trial and error process. Even in the last T20I that he played, the Jharkhand cricketer was batting at No. 3 in the injured Tilak Varma’s place. The maiden T20I century against New Zealand, however, has now made him virtually undroppable.With Sanju Samson out of form and Tilak likely to come back at No. 3, the only slot available is at the top.Though India will have a top three comprising all left-handers, their explosive ability can make the think-tank stick with the combination. With a batting lineup running down to No. 8, Abhishek and Kishan will get the license to play high-risk cricket and go for the big shots. In 2025, largely due to Abhishek’s heroics, India had the best Powerplay run-rate of 10.86 followed by England at 10.52, while the third spot was shared by New Zealand and Australia (10.16).Now let’s look at the opening combos of these three teams. England’s opening duo of Phil Salt and Jos Buttler has immense experience of Indian conditions. Both Buttler and Salt have been big successes in the IPL. The only chink is Salt’s technique against spin, which can sometimes become a factor in India.New Zealand, who lost a series 1-4 to India recently, want opposition teams to play the guessing game about their opening duo. Though Devon Conway was opening in the series against India, Tim Seifert and Finn Allen are the two players who are tipped to start the proceedings in the World Cup. Seifert has a strike-rate of 143.49, Allen 165.45.The big question is around their experience in Indian conditions, and that’s why the New Zealand management wanted Conway to fit into that role. But the senior left-hander hasn’t exactly set the stage on fire.That brings us to the opening combination that is bound to leave India a little worried. Australia’s Travis Head and Mitchell Marsh only opened together once in the T20 series against Pakistan that they lost 0-3 recently. Both looked out of sorts but the Aussies have the ability to flick a switch when it comes to World Cups. Head has been a consistent headache for India across formats and the fact that he is a regular in IPL for Sunrisers Hyderabad gives him all the experience that he needs on Indian pitches.Marsh, too, is a fierce hitter and he also opens regularly in the IPL for Lucknow Supergiants.","Abhishek has absolutely flourished, batting at a ridiculous strike rate of 194.97.

Delhi Capitals produced a dominant all-round performance to book their place in a fourth straight Women’s Premier League final, beating Gujarat Giants by seven wickets in the Eliminator on Tuesday.After choosing to bowl, Delhi’s disciplined attack kept Gujarat to a competitive but manageable 168 for 7. The Capitals struck early through Chinelle Henry, who removed Sophie Devine and later returned to finish with 3 for 35.Nandini Sharma made an immediate impact in her first over, dismissing Anushka Sharma and captain Ashleigh Gardner off successive deliveries to leave the Giants in trouble. Spinners Minnu Mani and Sneh Rana tightened the screws through the middle overs, restricting the flow of runs and forcing Gujarat to rebuild. Beth Mooney held the innings together with a composed unbeaten 62 off 51 balls, hitting six boundaries. She found support from Georgia Wareham, who played a lively 35-run knock as the pair added 61 for the fifth wicket. Mooney later combined with Kashvee Gautam for a late flourish, helping Gujarat add valuable runs in the final overs after struggling for momentum earlier.In reply, Delhi made light work of the chase thanks to a blistering opening partnership.Shafali Verma and Lizelle Lee came out attacking, smashing 89 runs without loss in just a few overs. Verma struck 31 off 21 balls while Lee made 43 off 24, peppering the boundary and putting Gujarat on the back foot.Although Wareham briefly revived Gujarat’s hopes by dismissing both openers in the same over, the damage had already been done.Laura Wolvaardt and skipper Jemimah Rodrigues calmly guided the chase through the middle phase, ensuring there were no further hiccups. Rodrigues scored a fluent 41 while Wolvaardt remained unbeaten on 32.

With a place in their fourth consecutive Women’s Premier League (WPL) final at stake, Delhi Capitals face their sternest challenge yet in the Eliminator against a confident Gujarat Giants side that has already beaten them twice this season.Capitals, finalists in each of the previous three editions, are still in search of their elusive maiden title and enter the do-ordie clash at the BCA Stadium in Vadodara as underdogs. The Giants and Capitals are evenly matched teams and their two league-stage meetings underlined how close this rivalry has become. While the Capitals lost both encounters, the margins were thin — four runs in the first match and three in the second.Both teams are led by captains in good form and setting the tone from the front.For the Capitals, Jemimah Rodrigues has grown into the leadership role in her first major captaincy assignment. On the other hand, Giants’ skipper Ashleigh Gardner has been outstanding, currently the fifth-highest run-getter in the tournament with 244 runs from eight matches at an impressive strike rate of 142.69.Further bolstering the Giants’ firepower is veteran allrounder Sophie Devine, the tournament’s leading wickettaker with 17 wickets.

NAVI MUMBAI: Key batter Tilak Varma marked a successful return from injury with an allround performance as India ‘A’ defeated USA by 38 runs in a high-scoring warm-up match at the DY Patil Stadium on Monday.Returning after a groin injury sustained during the Vijay Hazare Trophy that ruled him out of the home T20I series against New Zealand, Varma looked fully fit, scoring a fluent 38 off 24 balls (3x4, 2x6), picking up a wicket (1/27 in two overs) and taking two catches — including a sharp running effort at cover.Watched by around 5,000 spectators, the left-hander showed no signs of discomfort and will now link up with the Team India camp in Mumbai.Varma will get another hitout at the same venue when India face South Africa in a warm-up match on Wednesday ahead of their World Cup opener against USA at the Wankhede on Saturday.Meanwhile, fast bowler Mayank Yadav made his comeback after more than a year out with a stress fracture.

Former captain Rashid Latif on Pakistan boycotting India T20 World Cup match

NEW DELHI: Even as the row over Pakistan’s decision to boycott its men’s T20 World Cup group-stage clash against India continues to escalate, there is no indication that the fallout has spilled over into the women’s game. The Pakistan Women’s A team is set to play India Women’s A at the Rising Stars Asia Cup in Bangkok, with no instructions received so far to boycott the fixture, reported ESPNcricinfo on Monday.According to the report, preparations for the Rising Stars Asia Cup, which begins on February 13, are progressing as scheduled. Pakistan Women’s A and India Women’s A are due to meet on February 15 — the same day the Pakistan men’s team is slated to face India in the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup, a match the Pakistan government has said its team “shall not take the field” for, citing no reasons in a post on X.The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) issued a press release on Sunday announcing the Women’s A squad for the tournament, hours after the boycott of the men’s World Cup clash was made public. Pakistan Women’s A are placed in Group A alongside India A, UAE and Nepal, underlining that, at least for now, the women’s fixture remains unaffected.ESPNcricinfo further reported that while speculation is rife over potential sanctions against the PCB, the International Cricket Council (ICC) is yet to decide whether a Board meeting is required to discuss the issue.Any such deliberations would involve the 12 Full Member boards, three Associate representatives and the ICC chair, but no emergency meeting has been called so far.The ICC has already made its stance clear, warning that “selective participation” is difficult to reconcile with the fundamental premise of global tournaments built on integrity, fairness and consistency. While the men’s India-Pakistan clash hangs in uncertainty, the absence of any boycott directive for the women’s team suggests a sharp contrast between the two situations.",Pakistan Women's A team set to play India Women’s A at the Rising Stars Asia Cup.

Despite the turbulence that has marked India’s transition under a new management group led by head coach Gautam Gambhir , especially in Tests and to some extent in ODIs, the shortest format has remained a sanctuary. Even with structural changes and high-profile retirements, India’s T20I juggernaut has barely slowed since lifting the T20 World Cup in Bridgetown in June 2024. Yet, as the defending champions prepare to host the 2026 edition alongside Sri Lanka, one major selection dilemma threatens to disturb an otherwise smooth build-up: Sanju Samson ’s form and his place in India’s playing XI.On paper, India look perfectly positioned to defend their crown. Since the World Cup triumph over South Africa, they have won 33 of their 41 T20Is, losing only six. A recent 4–1 home series win over New Zealand underlined their depth and adaptability in familiar conditions. With stalwarts Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma and Ravindra Jadeja stepping away from T20Is, a new core has emerged — faster, more fearless, and unapologetically aggressive.That philosophy was evident when India named their 15-member squad for the World Cup on December 20, 2025. Suryakumar Yadav leads a side brimming with versatility: Abhishek Sharma at the top, power through the middle with Tilak Varma, Shivam Dube and Rinku Singh, all-round depth in Hardik Pandya, Axar Patel and Washington Sundar, and a varied bowling attack spearheaded by Jasprit Bumrah and Arshdeep Singh. The boldest call, however, was leaving out Shubman Gill to reinstate the Samson–Abhishek opening combination.At the time, the move drew little criticism. Samson’s credentials as an opener were built on a stunning run in late 2024. From October 2024 to February 2025, he scored 417 runs in 12 innings at an average of 37.91 and a strike rate of 183.7. The numbers were turbocharged by three centuries: 111 against Bangladesh, 107 against South Africa and an unbeaten 109 against South Africa again — each scored at a strike rate north of 190. Alongside Abhishek, Samson looked liberated, decisive and destructive.That momentum, however, proved fragile. Samson lost his opening slot during the Asia Cup in September 2025, pushed down to No.3 and No.5, where his returns dipped. He managed just one fifty in five innings before being restored to the top of the order on the eve of the World Cup squad announcement. A 37 off 22 balls against South Africa hinted at revival, and the management doubled down by naming him Abhishek’s opening partner while dropping Gill.The expectation was clear: Samson had one final audition to reaffirm his spot. Instead, the home series against New Zealand exposed the biggest crack in India’s otherwise polished T20 armour. While India cruised to a 4–1 series win, Samson endured a nightmare run — scores of 10, 6, 0, 24 and 6. Forty-six runs at an average of 9.2 from five innings is alarming by any measure, especially for a specialist top-order batter in home conditions.What has compounded Samson’s predicament is the timing of Ishan Kishan’s resurgence. Recalled as the backup opener and wicketkeeper, Kishan seized his opportunity with ruthless clarity. Batting at No.3 in Tilak Varma’s absence, he hammered 76 off 32 balls in Raipur, followed by 28 off 13 in Guwahati and a blistering 103 off 43 in the series finale - with only blip being 8 in Nagpur. His aggregate — 215 runs at 53.75 with a strike rate of 231.19 — did more than strengthen India’s top order; it directly challenged Samson’s place at the top.Selection dilemmas are a luxury, but this one cuts deep. Tilak, Axar and Washington are returning from injury, which will already force reshuffling. When a fit-again Tilak returns in playing XI, accommodating Kishan becomes a genuine headache. Dropping a left-hander in such form, particularly one who offers wicketkeeping flexibility, goes against the management’s recent emphasis on momentum and match-ups.Samson’s broader record adds another layer to the debate. He has now played 57 T20Is for India — 33 of them since the 2024 World Cup. In a format where only four Indians have crossed 100 appearances, Samson’s sample size is no longer small. Opportunities have been plentiful, and the New Zealand series was meant to be a statement phase, not a regression.As Team India prepares to open their campaign on February 7 against the USA at the Wankhede Stadium, the question is unavoidable: does the management persist with Samson on past promises, or ride the present form of Ishan Kishan? For a team otherwise in cruise control, the answer could shape not just the opening combination, but the tone of India’s title defence at home.","Sanju Samson and Ishan Kishan are India’s opening pair for the 2026 T20 World Cup in New Zealand. India have won 33 of their 41 T20Is, losing only six. The defending champions have won the last three World Cups.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127879099,imgsize-75380,width-400,resizemode-4/samson-vs-kishan.jpg"

Former captain Rashid Latif on Pakistan boycotting India T20 World Cup match

NEW DELHI: Australia pace spearhead Pat Cummins has revealed that his injury-enforced withdrawal from the upcoming T20 World Cup was as much about long-term planning as it was about his immediate fitness, with the fast bowler prioritising a demanding Test calendar over a rushed return to the shortest format.Cummins, Australia’s Test and ODI captain, was ruled out of the T20 World Cup after failing to recover in time from a back injury and has been replaced in the squad by Ben Dwarshuis . The 32-year-old has been managing the issue since Australia’s tour of the West Indies last July and said a follow-up scan ultimately forced his hand.“It was really unfortunate. I feel pretty good, just a minor setback and just ran out of time really,” Cummins was quoted as saying by Australian Associated Press. “I’ll rest up for a few weeks and go from there.”Cummins explained that initial estimates suggested he could be fit within four weeks after the Adelaide Test, but medical advice later indicated a longer recovery window was needed. “We knew after the Test match we were going to need somewhere between four and eight weeks to let the bone settle right down,” he said. “They thought it probably needs another couple of weeks, so the timeline just became a bit too tight.”With Australia facing a packed Test schedule — including home series against Bangladesh and New Zealand, a tour of South Africa, a five-Test Border-Gavaskar Trophy in India, the Ashes, and a potential World Test Championship final — Cummins said caution was essential. “We thought the first half of the year was a pretty good time to be conservative with the amount of cricket that’s coming up,” he said. “Get it right now and hopefully you can just go out and play all those Test matches. ”Cummins remains hopeful of returning in time to lead Sunrisers Hyderabad in the IPL from March 26, adding that his comeback will be guided by further scans. Despite Australia’s 0-3 whitewash in Pakistan, he backed the squad for the World Cup. “Morale is good… they know how big it is, and they’re desperate to get into it,” he said.",Pat Cummins ruled out of the T20 World Cup after failing to recover in time from a back injury.

It brought a smile to everyone’s lips but after a while, when it sank in, one could sense the pain behind Axar’s comment.Axar’s childhood friend Keval Patel bursts into laughter while sharing the text he sent his buddy after the 32-year-old injured his bowling finger attempting a return catch in the first T20I against New Zealand.(laughs). I messaged him to be careful, the World Cup is ahead, and there is a lot of cricket,” Keval tells TimesofIndia.com from Nadiad in Gujarat.Behind the laughter, one could sense the tension that had gripped Axar’s close circle back home. Keval had seen a similar script unfold in 2023 when Axar got injured and missed the ODI World Cup at home. And he was not ready for another heartbreak.The absolute low of 2023 was followed by a dream run for Axar as he featured in the title-winning 2024 T20 World Cup squad, played a stellar knock in the final, and followed it up with a Champions Trophy title in 2025.In between, Axar became a father with the arrival of 'Chota Patel'. Axar and his wife were blessed with a baby boy in December 2024 and, in Keval’s words, the toddler is the heartbeat of the entire clan. A group that once spent its time playing PlayStation now spends it with Haksh.(We still sit the same way, but now Axar brings his son along and all the time goes there. We keep playing with him),” says Keval.While Axar’s close circle has watched many of his games from the stands, it will be a World Cup debut of sorts for his son. Keval plans to take 'Chotu' to the ground for one of the matches.(I have watched many matches. 'Chotu' has also watched a Delhi Capitals IPL game. But this time, it will be his first World Cup. We haven’t decided which match yet, but Axar knows we will be there together),” Keval shares.Axar flies under the radar most of the time, but his contributions with both bat and ball make him an integral part of the side. He remains the underrated cog in a star-studded Indian line-up. Brick by brick, the 32-year-old has grown in stature. He is the captain of Delhi Capitals and the deputy to Suryakumar Yadav in India’s T20I set-up.“Axar has been with us since 2019. He is an excellent reader of the game. He is a fun-loving character who keeps things light, but not many have noticed his game-reading skills and the way he thinks about cricket,” Venugopal Rao , Delhi Capitals’ director of cricket, tells this outlet.Rao also revealed how Axar won the captaincy race despite the presence of experienced campaigners like Faf du Plessis and KL Rahul.“When captaincy was discussed, Rahul was there and Faf was there, but everyone was convinced about Axar because even the Indian team had started taking note of his leadership abilities,” says Rao.Rao’s first meeting with Axar came when the all-rounder was making waves in the age-group circuit for Gujarat and was known as the “Jayasuriya of Nadiad” because of his strokeplay.He recalls a fascinating episode from the 2013-14 Ranji Trophy season, when Axar was thrown into the deep end in a crucial fixture against Delhi. Rao and then Gujarat captain Parthiv Patel , agreed on the need to include a left-arm spinner against a star-studded Delhi batting line-up featuring Virender Sehwag, Gautam Gambhir, Mithun Manhas and Rajat Bhatia.“I remember discussing it with Parthiv. We knew Axar from the age-group circuit and felt a left-arm spinner was essential. I scored a hundred, Parthiv got a half-century, but it was Axar who stood out. He took six wickets in the first innings and made vital runs to give us the first-innings lead,” Rao recalls.The performance did not go unnoticed. Axar was picked by the Punjab Kings at the IPL auction and soon earned a national call-up. Months later, he made his ODI debut for India against Bangladesh in June 2014.“He made an immediate impact. He did well against a strong Delhi side and got his rewards. There was no looking back after that,” Rao adds.From the teenager Rao saw in 2013 to the match-winner he has worked with at Delhi Capitals, much has changed. Yet, much has remained the same. Axar has matured significantly, but his mantra of keeping things simple remains intact.“With the greatest cricketers, it’s about how simple they keep things. Axar has mastered that and has only matured with time,” explains Rao.Back in Nadiad, little has changed. He is still the same Axar Keval grew up with. Having lived through the highs and lows of his childhood friend’s career, Keval says one thing has never changed: Axar’s humility.(He is very down-to-earth. Nothing has changed. Outside the cricket field, he is still the same Axar as before),” says Keval.During the 2023 ODI World Cup, Axar was confined to watching matches on television. His friends sensed the turmoil he must have been going through. Their plan was simple: PlayStation, card games and plenty of laughter to keep his spirits up.(We knew he was sad on the inside. It was a huge stage. We would sit everyday and distract him),” Keval says.Axar carries the air of someone who has endured more than his share of misfortune. For over a decade, he has lived in Ravindra Jadeja’s shadow and missed major tournaments due to injuries. Yet, his tenacity has kept him going. A self-made cricketer, he has squeezed every ounce of his talent.He has won ICC titles, but this time, he will have a new supporter in 'Chota Patel' cheering from the stands. Axar now has the task of making his son’s first World Cup memorable by helping India lift the trophy once again.",Axar Patel's injury history will motivate him to perform better. It won't affect the team's performance. It will only affect his individual performance. Keval had seen a similar script unfold in 2023 when Axar got injured and missed the ODI Cup at home. He was not ready for another heartbreak.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127898028,imgsize-52072,width-400,resizemode-4/axar-patel-3.jpg"

The third edition of the Indian Street Premier League has highlighted just how far India’s premier T10 tennis-ball competition has evolved. With its mix of raw pace, landmark bowling spells, last-over drama and towering team totals, ISPL Season 3 has consistently showcased a high level of competitiveness, reinforcing the league’s growing stature in the domestic cricket landscape.As the tournament now moves into a high-pressure playoff phase starting today, the season has already produced several moments that have stood out for their intensity, quality and composure under pressure. Here are five defining highlights from ISPL Season 3 so far that have helped shape the narrative and set the stage for a thrilling finish.Raw pace took centre stage on the second day of the season when Tiigers of Kolkata fast bowler Vivek Shelar delivered the fastest ball ever recorded in ISPL history. Clocked at an astonishing 145.2 KPH against Chennai Singams, the delivery left fans stunned and quickly became one of the most replayed moments of the season. Shelar finished with figures of 3/15, but beyond the numbers, the spell served as a clear indication of how high the standards in the league have risen. It also underlined the depth of talent in tennis-ball cricket and the importance of platforms like ISPL in giving such players a stage.Abhishek Dalhor once again proved why he is regarded as one of the most reliable performers in the league. Representing defending champions Majhi Mumbai, Dalhor delivered consistently through Season 3, stepping up whenever the situation demanded. His standout performance came on January 16 against Ahmedabad Lions, when he produced a spell that went straight into the record books. Finishing with remarkable figures of 5/3 in two overs, Dalhor used sharp pace and control to dismantle Ahmedabad’s chase of 90, completely swinging the contest in Mumbai’s favour and powering them to a commanding 27-run win.Season 3 also delivered a rare statistical coincidence, with two hat-tricks being recorded against the same opposition, Srinagar Ke Veer, within a matter of days. On January 27, Falcon Risers Hyderabad pacer Vicky Bhoir struck with three wickets in three balls during the second over, setting the platform for a six-wicket victory. Just two days later, Delhi Superheros bowler Firoz Shaikh achieved a similar feat while defending a modest total of 84. Delhi went on to secure a 25-run win, with the twin hat-tricks becoming one of the most talked-about moments of the season.Few episodes captured the drama of ISPL Season 3 better than Jignesh Patel’s last-ball heroics for Ahmedabad Lions. On February 1, chasing 84 against Tiigers of Kolkata, Ahmedabad required four runs off the final delivery. Walking in at No. 8, the Lions skipper kept his nerve, assessed the field smartly and placed the ball perfectly between the fielders for a boundary. The last-ball four sealed a memorable win and confirmed Ahmedabad’s place in the playoffs, producing one of the most dramatic finishes of the season.On January 30, Tiigers of Kolkata produced one of the standout batting displays of the tournament, piling up 149/7 against Srinagar Ke Veer, the highest team total of Season 3. The innings was driven by Krushna Gawali’s explosive 74 off just 26 balls. Srinagar struggled under the weight of the steep chase, as Tiigers cruised to a dominant 93-run victory, the largest winning margin of the season.","The third edition of the Indian Street Premier League has highlighted just how far India’s premier T10 tennis-ball competition has evolved.

"T20 World Cup: As Azzurris struggle, there’s a new Italy rising",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/icc-mens-t20-world-cup/t20-world-cup-as-azzurris-struggle-theres-a-new-italy-rising/articleshow/127893618.cms,"The T20 World Cup debutants overcame tough European qualifiers to be here but even though newcomers on the big stage, cricket in Italy is far from ‘new’.

NAI: Italy lives and breathes sport. Cycling, volleyball, water polo, motor racing and F1, now tennis, but it is Calcio or football that drives the tifosi. For the four-time world champions, however, the last decade has been one to forget, with even qualification to this summer’s World Cup hanging in the balance. While the Azzurris find themselves in the shadows, another team from Italy is quietly stepping into the light.“Hopefully, they might look at the success we’ve had in the last couple of months and take some inspiration from that,” Italy cricket team’s assistant coach Kevin O’Brien, famous for his marvelous knock for Ireland against England in the 2011 ODI World Cup, quipped about Gattuso’s team at the end of their pratice match against Canada here Monday.The T20 World Cup debutants overcame tough European qualifiers to be here but even though newcomers on the big stage, cricket in Italy is far from ‘new’. AC Milan, that storied football club, was originally founded as the Milan Football and Cricket Club. Famed striker Christian Vieri was a fine left-handed bat, modelled on idol Allan Border, during his growing-up years in Sydney, which has a sizeable Italian immigrant population.As for some members of the current squad, returning to Italy has been a wholesome ‘return’ to their roots. They had grown up hearing stories of Italian cricket from the 1980s. The two pairs of brothers — Benjamin and Harry Manenti, and Anthony and Justin Mosca — all born in Australia, have brought their Sydney-bred cricketing skills to the international stage. When the opportunity first came before the pandemic, it was Benjamin who received the initial call from the Italian Cricket Federation, and soon the rest followed.“I’ve always heard of Italian cricket because of my heritage, but I didn’t know at what scale it was,” said Anthony, “In recent years, cricket has started to pick up. When the opportunity came to play cricket for Italy, we obviously had our passports, and because of our heritage, we are able to represent them. The four of us (Menenti brothers and Justin) have grown up playing at the same Sydney cricket club and we know each other for almost 20 years now. We are as close mates as brothers, and our families will be cheering us on together from home.”And when asked about the cricket scene back home in Italy, Benjamin joked that since the Azzurri might miss out on the World Cup, they might only have one World Cup to cheer for this year and that they’d “better jump on the back of the cricket team”.“But yeah, it was prominent in the 1990s and 2000s and then it died off a bit,” admitted Benjamin. “But now it’s back again. They’re very excited about it, they’re very passionate. Same as everywhere in the world, cricket is a loved game by a lot of people. Hopefully, seeing Italy in a World Cup and on the biggest stage gets more people involved,” he added.The off-spinner added that the newly launched European T20 Premier League could give a major boost to cricket in Italy.“Obviously, the first benefactors will be Holland, Scotland and Ireland. But hopefully in the not-too-distant future there’s an Italy team as well. After a good World Cup, a few of our boys might get the opportunity to play as part of the Europeans this year. We’ve got a lot of good cricketers with experience, and teams will probably be keen to have them. This is an opportunity for them to get in, and for cricket in Italy to grow. Cricket in Europe is very popular, and I think it’s only getting bigger.”While Italy are on a mission to make their country embrace the sport, they consider themselves ‘underdogs’ and hope to become the second team that Indian fans, the co-hosts, cheer for.","The T20 World Cup debutants overcame tough European qualifiers to be here.

NEW DELHI: In the last year, coach Gautam Gambhir has been under immense pressure after India lost two home Test series against New Zealand and South Africa. Without any doubt, he is under the pump when it comes to the game’s longest format. But when it comes to T20Is, credit where it is due, Gambhir has built a team that other sides have reason to fear.One can argue that Gambhir took over the reins with India already being world champions, but the Suryakumar Yadav-led team looks like a more well-oiled machine, with fewer holes, than Rohit Sharma’s side that ended India’s 11-year-long ICC title drought in 2024.The trio of Virat Kohli, Rohit and Ravindra Jadeja announced their retirement from T20Is after the World Cup triumph. Rishabh Pant failed to improve his T20I game and is no longer in contention.Under Gambhir, India have reshaped their T20 blueprint.Abhishek Sharma still has a long way to go to match the greatness of Rohit Sharma. But since making his debut in Harare in 2024, the Amritsar mauler has set the world on fire. In 38 matches, Abhishek has scored two centuries and is striking close to 200, at 194.74. His explosive batting goes beyond numbers.It is the psychological impact he creates in the opposition dressing room that gives India a decisive edge.Since his debut, Abhishek has had two opening partners. He scored a duck on debut with his childhood friend Shubman Gill at the other end, before forging a dangerous partnership with Sanju Samson. After Gambhir took charge, Samson moved up the order and matched Abhishek with his own swashbuckling batting, scoring three hundreds in five matches.Before the Asia Cup, fresh from his heroics as Test skipper in England, Gill was brought in as vice-captain. The Gill-Abhishek experiment lasted 15 games before the Test and ODI skipper was axed, citing combination issues. Sanju returned to the top but his poor outings against New Zealand, where he managed only 52 runs in five games, might force him to sit out for Ishan Kishan, who is in devastating form.Kishan entered the Indian team as a second-choice option and played only due to Tilak Varma’s absence. Now, with 215 runs in four matches, Sanju’s rough patch has given the Jharkhand captain a massive edge. With Varma, India’s Asia Cup hero and designated No. 3, back to full fitness, Abhishek could have his third opening partner on February 7 in the tournament opener against the USA at the Wankhede Stadium.The biggest concern for the Gambhir-coached side was captain Suryakumar Yadav ’s form. In the 25 matches preceding the New Zealand series, he had managed only 244 runs at an average of 12.84 and a strike rate of 117.87. Against New Zealand, he was dismissed inside 20 balls just once. His strike rate against fuller deliveries from fast bowlers surged to 217.95. Surya struck three half-centuries, with a highest score of 82 not out, finished as the series’ leading run-getter, and amassed 242 runs in five matches at a strike rate of 196.74.In Hardik Pandya and Shivam Dube, India have two six-hitting machines in the middle order. There was never any doubt over Hardik’s batting talent, but he has taken it a notch higher.Dube’s inclusion over Rinku Singh in the last T20 World Cup raised eyebrows, but he has reinvented himself and is arguably the most improved cricketer of the Gambhir era. R Ashwin has repeatedly said on his YouTube channel that Dube is a specialist at taking spinners to the cleaners. However, the burly all-rounder has also shown his hitting prowess against pacers. The 32-year-old had the second-best strike rate in the New Zealand series at 248.93, behind Abhishek Sharma’s 249.30. He also made useful contributions with the ball.Then there is Axar Patel, who often flies under the radar. Axar played a pivotal role in India’s triumph two years ago and will again be a key cog in Gambhir’s gambit. In Rinku, India have a specialist finisher who made it to the World Cup squad only after the selectors decided to shelve the Shubman Gill experiment. He, too, proved his worth with the bat in the New Zealand series.If the batters send shivers through opposition camps, India’s bowling unit looks even more menacing. In Arshdeep, Bumrah and Hardik, India have three bowlers with 100 T20I wickets each. Kuldeep Yadav and Axar Patel are closing in, with 94 and 86 scalps, respectively.Then there is the X-factor Varun Chakravarthy. The 34-year-old has picked up 57 wickets between the last two World Cups at an economy rate of 7.42 and strikes every 11.2 balls. This is not Varun’s first World Cup, but after a largely forgettable outing in 2021, he will have a point to prove.Never before has a T20 World Cup had such overwhelming favourites, nor a side so well equipped to rewrite history. India have the luxury of unmatched depth and adaptability. This squad is a refined version of the team that won two years ago.Gambhir’s men just run in, hurl the ball, swing the bat, and harass the opposition with smiles on their faces. If the T20 World Cup is waiting for a team to defy its own history, Gautam Gambhir’s India appear ready to be that exception.","Gautam Gambhir has built a team that other sides have reason to fear. India look like a more well-oiled machine, with fewer holes, than Rohit Sharma’s side. Abhishek Sharma has scored two centuries and is striking close to 200, at 194.74.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127889056,imgsize-134086,width-400,resizemode-4/india-team-practice-session-ahead-of-4th-t20-against-new-zealand-in-visakhapatnam.jpg"

Former captain Rashid Latif on Pakistan boycotting India T20 World Cup match

NEW DELHI: Former Australia captain Steve Smith has signed with new Pakistan Super League (PSL) team Sialkot Stallionz for the 2026 season, which will make his first-ever appearance in the PSL.The franchise confirmed the signing on Tuesday, bringing Smith in through a direct signing option allowed under league rules for overseas players who did not play in the previous season.Sialkot Stallionz were recently announced as one of the PSL’s two new teams, and Smith is expected to be a central figure in their debut campaign.With his experience and leadership background, he could also be considered for the captain’s role.Smith, who went unsold during the IPL mini auction in December last year, last played competitive cricket in the Big Bash League with Sydney Sixers, where he made an immediate impact despite joining midway through the season.He scored 299 runs in just six matches at an impressive average of 59.80, including one century and two half-centuries.Smith, playing alongside Babar Azam, finished as the Sixers’ top scorer and helped them reach the final, where they lost to Perth Scorchers.Although Smith went unsold in the IPL 2025 auction, his value in franchise cricket remains high.Across 272 T20 matches, he has scored 6,242 runs at an average of 32.68 and a strike rate of 131.38, including five centuries and 30 half-centuries.Sialkot Stallionz have also strengthened their setup off the field by appointing former Australia captain Tim Paine as head coach.Paine brings coaching experience from stints with Adelaide Strikers and Australia A teams.The PSL 2026 season is scheduled to begin on March 26, with Sialkot Stallionz set to make their much-anticipated debut.",Steve Smith signs for Sialkot Stallionz for the 2026 Pakistan Super League.

Former captain Rashid Latif on Pakistan boycotting India T20 World Cup match

NEW DELHI: A controversial moment during Australia’s T20I series loss to Pakistan has sparked anger among cricket fans after replays revealed a clear rule breach that went unnoticed by the umpires.Pakistan cruised to a 111-run win in the third match to complete a 3-0 whitewash, but the focus later shifted to a controversial dismissal involving Australian batter Cooper Connolly.Connolly was dismissed for a duck while trying to get back into his crease, appearing to be stumped by Pakistan wicketkeeper Khawaja Nafay.At first glance, it looked straightforward, and the on-field umpire gave him out without consulting the third umpire.However, slow-motion replays later showed Connolly was unfairly dismissed.Watch:The footage revealed that Nafay broke the stumps using his left glove, while the ball was still in his right hand. Under cricket laws, a wicketkeeper can only remove the bails using the hand or glove that is holding the ball. In this case, the ball was never transferred before the stumps were broken.The ICC laws are clear on the matter. Clause 29.2.1 states: “The wicket is broken fairly if a bail is completely removed from the top of the stumps or a stump is struck out of the ground – by a fielder with his hand or arm, providing that the ball is held in the hand or hands so used, or in the hand of the arm so used.”Despite this, Nafay did not acknowledge the mistake and continued with the appeal, which appeared to convince the umpire that the dismissal was legal.Fans were left stunned that the error wasn’t spotted in real time or reviewed.The incident has drawn heavy criticism online, with many questioning why the appeal wasn’t withdrawn, especially with Pakistan already dominating the match.While the result wouldn’t have changed, the moment has raised concerns over sportsmanship and umpiring standards ahead of the World Cup.","Cooper Connolly was dismissed for a duck by Pakistan wicketkeeper Khawaja Nafay.

NEW DELHI: Bengaluru FC players, including India legend Sunil Chhetri , have agreed to take a pay cut for the truncated Indian Super League (ISL) season starting February 14, with club owner Parth Jindal thanking the squad for making the “sacrifice” in the best interests of both the franchise and the sport.Jindal said the management held open and honest discussions with the first-team players about “navigating the situation the sport finds itself in,” as the delayed ISL prepares to restart after being paused for more than four months.Highlighting the challenges facing Indian football, Jindal took to X to explain the club’s position.""Everyone is well aware of the challenging phase Indian Football is going through. For me, as BFC team owner and someone who is deeply passionate about the sport and the club, this has been one of the toughest periods ever,"" Jindal wrote on 'X'.""I am grateful to all the first team players who have agreed to reduce their remuneration during this phase.""Without a doubt, this was one of the toughest decisions we have had to make as a club, and I truly appreciate that the players have made this sacrifice in the best interests of the club and the sport.""Jindal had earlier urged players across clubs to “make sacrifices” citing the “financial burden” franchises would face to participate in the delayed league, even warning that without player support his club might have to “shut shop for good.” While he had not detailed the nature of the sacrifice at the time, he hinted at salary reductions for the season.Bengaluru FC’s squad includes former India captain Sunil Chhetri and star goalkeeper Gurpreet Singh Sandhu. The club has also appointed former India international Renedy Singh as first-team head coach for the upcoming campaign.Last month, FC Goa players, including India captain Sandesh Jhingan, along with support staff, also accepted pay cuts for the shortened season, with the club calling it a “selfless” move and saying it was “deeply humbled by this gesture and immensely grateful for the unity, character, and commitment shown by the group.” FC Goa’s roster also features India players Udanta Singh and Boris Singh.The ISL 2025–26 season was thrown into uncertainty after former organiser FSDL ended its Master Rights Agreement with the AIFF on December 8. Although a tender for a new commercial partner drew no bidders, intervention from the sports minister and negotiations ensured all 14 clubs confirmed participation. A truncated season featuring 91 matches will be played on a home-and-away basis, with each team contesting 13 games.The AIFF has since issued the Request for Proposal for broadcast rights, with bids set to open on February 2. Clubs will bear 60 per cent of the league’s financial cost, estimated at Rs 25 crore. Fixtures are expected to be announced soon.","Bengaluru FC players have agreed to take a pay cut for the truncated Indian Super League (ISL) season starting February 14.

Arsenal settled any fears of a wobble in their pursuit of a first Premier League title in 22 years by winning 4-0 at Leeds on Saturday.The Gunners' advantage over Manchester City and Aston Villa, who are both in action on Sunday, stretches to seven points as Mikel Arteta 's men took another step towards the title at Elland Road.A first home defeat of the season last weekend to Manchester United capped a run of just two points from a possible nine in Arsenal's previous three league games.After finishing runners-up for the past three seasons, questions were raised over the mentality of Arteta's men to get over the line in a title race.The visitors were dealt another blow before kick-off as Bukayo Saka was injured in the warm-up.But his replacement Noni Madueke played a major part in inflicting just a second defeat in 12 games on Leeds.Madueke's cross was headed in by Martin Zubimendi to open the scoring.Leeds goalkeeper Karl Darlow could then only parry another dangerous delivery from the England winger into his own goal before half-time.Despite a fine run of form, Leeds remain only six points above the relegation zone.Their first defeat at home since November was confirmed when the much-criticised Viktor Gyokeres latched onto Gabriel Martinelli's cross to blast in his 11th goal since joining Arsenal from Sporting Lisbon.Gabriel Jesus came off the bench to round off the scoring with a blistering strike four minutes from time.Arsenal will be hoping local rivals Tottenham can do them a favour when City visit north London, while Villa host Brentford on Sunday.Chelsea can climb into the top four later should they maintain their bright start under Liam Rosenior against West Ham at Stamford Bridge.Liverpool are aiming to ease the pressure on Arne Slot at Anfield in Saturday's late kick-off when they host Newcastle.Everton snatched a 1-1 draw at Brighton thanks to Beto's 97th-minute equaliser in a result that does little for either side's aspirations of European football next season.Pascal Gross' first goal since returning to the Seagulls from Borussia Dortmund put Brighton in front.Bournemouth ended any remaining worries of being dragged into a relegation fight as goals from Eli Kroupi and Alex Scott earned a 2-0 win at bottom-of-the-table Wolves.The Cherries climb up to 12th and 13 points clear of the relegation zone.",Arsenal beat Leeds 4-0 at Elland Road to extend their lead to seven points.

Fans turn on the Pro Bowl after Shedeur Sanders interception

The Pro Bowl has always lived in an uneasy space, part celebration and part experiment, but this season that balance quietly slipped on Tuesday. What started as a night meant to be relaxed and entertaining slowly became ‌ something far more uncomfortable. By the time the matchup settled into its flow, the spotlight was no longer on the score or the highlights, but on what the event had become.Shedeur Sanders did not arrive with chaos following him. His selection had already caused a stir, and his presence carried curiosity more than pressure. Early on, he showed flashes that screamed the stage was not too big. Yet as the night unfolded, a single play quickly changed the conversation, and wide opened a debate the league has tried to avoid for years.The turning point came when Sanders threw an interception that instantly changed the game's momentum. Until that moment, he had already tossed a touchdown and completed a two-point conversion, giving the AFC some momentum. The mistake, however, erased that progress and became the moment fans could not ignore.The moment came with 11:56 left in the first quarter, facing second-and-goal. With 8-0, the star QB dropped back.Then his pass toward Ja’Marr Chase was picked off by Kevin Byard, slipping just past the Bengals wideout’s hands and instantly swinging the tone of the game.As the game continued, attention drifted toward Sanders’ regular-season credentials, which many felt did not match the honour of appearing in the league’s showcase event. He finished with 1,400 passing yards, ranking 35th among NFL quarterbacks, while his 56.6 per cent completion rate placed him 42nd. His 6.6 yards per attempt ranked 31st, and his 3.3 TD percentage ranked 36th. He also recorded a 4.7 interception rate, which ranked 41st, along with a 68.1 passer rating and 18.9 QBR, both near the bottom of the league.Only after those details surfaced did frustration explode online. During the live broadcast, one fan wrote on X, “This is an absolutely embarrassing production. Just scrap the Pro Bowl completely. Brutal.”Another added, “I put the Pro Bowl on for a second. WTF. Terrible.”Another chimes in, “Thought nobody watches the Pro Bowl lmao 😂 looks like ppl watching why because of #12.”The QB room only intensified the scrutiny. Josh Allen led the AFC group, Justin Herbert remained a reserve, and Sanders filled in for Drake Maye, who missed the game while New England remained in playoff contention. For many viewers, that contrast highlighted how far the Pro Bowl had drifted from its original purpose.The words spread quickly, reflecting a wider feeling that had been building for years. The interception did not create the backlash. It simply gave it a moment.","Shedeur Sanders threw an interception that instantly changed the game's momentum.

Cathy Lanier explains how NFL security planning will work for Super Bowl LX



With Super Bowl LX approaching, the NFL has found itself responding to growing public discussion around security and immigration enforcement. In recent weeks, rumors suggesting a possible presence of Immigration and Customs Enforcement around Super Bowl activities sparked concern among fans and community groups, prompting calls for clarity from the league.Those concerns were addressed directly this week by Cathy Lanier, the NFL’s chief security officer, during a scheduled media availability. Lanier emphasized that the league’s priority remains safety and coordination, while making it clear that immigration enforcement is not part of the NFL’s Super Bowl security planning.Lanier pushed back firmly against speculation linking ICE operations to Super Bowl LX. “There are no planned ICE or immigration enforcement operations that are scheduled around the Super Bowl or any of the Super Bowl-related events,” Lanier said, addressing the rumors that had circulated for weeks.Her comments come amid increased scrutiny of large scale sporting events and how security measures are perceived by the public. According to Lanier, the NFL’s approach follows the same structure used in previous Super Bowls, focusing on preparedness, coordination, and crowd safety rather than enforcement actions unrelated to the game.Super Bowl LX will be held in Santa Clara, a location expected to welcome tens of thousands of fans throughout the week. Lanier noted that managing an event of this size requires cooperation across multiple levels of government and law enforcement.“Consistent with previous years, we're supported by more than 35 federal, state, and local agencies,” Lanier said. “All of these agencies are here to ensure that the Super Bowl and the surrounding community are safe while we carry out all the fun activities around the Super Bowl.”The NFL believes transparency is key as fans travel from across the country for Super Bowl LX. By addressing the speculation directly, Lanier aimed to remove uncertainty and keep the focus on football, fan experiences, and the celebration surrounding the league’s biggest event. League officials hope the clarification helps reassure visitors, local residents, and fans that Super Bowl week will remain focused on sport and entertainment.","Cathy Lanier, the NFL’s chief security officer, addressed rumors of immigration enforcement around Super Bowl LX.

Insider says A.J. Brown trade feels inevitable

Whispers around the Eagles’ locker room have turned into something louder. Not from a press release or a trade leak, but from body language, tone, and timing. A.J. Brown’s future in Philadelphia suddenly feels uncertain. And now, league insiders believe the tension may not fade quietly. Something bigger is forming behind the scenes.Philadelphia has not made a move yet. But the silence feels strategic, not calm. Brown’s emotions, paired with front-office patience, have created a standoff that now draws interest from half the league. The question is no longer if teams are watching. It is how long the Eagles can hold the line.The Super Bowl spotlight only sharpened the focus. While Philadelphia stayed off the transaction wire, conversations across front offices began circling the same name. Brown’s situation no longer feels internal. It feels like a market in motion.Speaking on Super Bowl Opening Night in San Jose, NFL insider Dianna Russini told PHLY Sports that she expects this situation to end with a trade.“I have a feeling it’s going to resolve itself by A.J. no longer being in Philly,” Russini said. “That’s why I think it’s got in head. I don’t know that for a fact yet. I wouldn't be surprised if they move him to New England, a team that's playing Super Bowl""Russini also revealed that she checked Brown’s trade value around the 2025 deadline.According to her, teams believed the Eagles could get a second-round pick if they moved him.That aligns with growing league chatter. CBS Sports’ Tyler Sullivan reported that rival teams believe Philadelphia may accept a third-round and fifth-round pick based on Brown’s age, contract, and 2025 production. Brown is signed through 2029 and is owed $29 million in guarantees next season.The interest is real. The New England Patriots and Buffalo Bills both surfaced as serious suitors, per The Sporting News. Denver and Las Vegas also emerged as possible landing spots.Brown’s frustration did not appear overnight. His sideline reactions during the playoffs, followed by pointed podcast comments after the Eagles’ Divisional Round exit, made it clear he wanted a bigger role. Still, general manager Howie Roseman tried to calm the noise.“It is hard to find great players in the NFL, and A.J. is a great player,” Roseman said during his season-ending press conference.But league executives see a different reality. Brown still crossed 1,000 receiving yards in 2025, yet evaluators noted drops and reduced explosiveness late in the year.If Philly moves him, the ripple will be immediate. DeVonta Smith becomes the top target. Dallas Goedert and Jahan Dotson both face free agency. That leaves the offense thin and searching. For now, the Eagles wait. But across the league, teams already move their pieces. This story no longer feels like rumor. It feels like a countdown.",A.J. Brown’s future in Philadelphia suddenly feels uncertain. NFL insider Dianna Russini says she expects this situation to end with a trade. Brown is signed through 2029 and is owed $29 million in guarantees. The New England Patriots and Buffalo Bills both surfaced as serious suitors.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127897875,imgsize-53594,width-400,resizemode-4/aj-brown-trade-rumors-are-the-eagles-preparing-to-part-ways-with-their-star-wideout.jpg"

Micah Parsons opens up emotionally about fallout with Jerry Jones and why their once-strong bond collapsed



Micah Parsons and Jerry Jones' relationship broke long before the blockbuster trade sent the All-Pro edge rusher from Dallas to Green Bay. What looked like a routine contract standoff quietly turned into a personal rupture, ending one of the Cowboys’ most defining player-owner bonds in recent years. As the NFL world reflects on the 2026 season ahead of the Super Bowl, Parsons is no longer dodging the truth behind that split.The trade itself answered the what. The why and how now carry more weight. Parsons did not leave Dallas angry about football or money. He left disappointed that trust dissolved during private negotiations that blurred professional lines and reshaped how he views loyalty in the league.The breaking point came last March, when Parsons says discussions about his future drifted away from agents and into personal territory. Jones believed there was a handshake understanding of “term, amount, guarantees.” Parsons did not. That meeting, held without his agent David Mulugheta, changed everything.“I just wish some of those things never happened. You know what I mean?,” Parsons told Clarence Hill of All City DLLS Cowboys. “I wish that he never brought me into the office and just let the agent speak. And I wish he hadn’t compromised our relationship.I thought me and Jerry had a good relationship up to that point until this offseason, and it’s sad that it went to shit like that.”That conversation was the last direct exchange between the two. Soon after, Parsons instructed the Cowboys to deal only with his representation. Public tension followed. Private trust never returned. By August 28, Dallas sent its defensive cornerstone to Green Bay, insisting it won the deal.Parsons does not dispute the outcome. He landed with another legacy franchise and secured a four-year, $186 million contract. On the field, he delivered 12.5 sacks and relentless pressure before a torn ACL cut his season short in Week 15. Off the field, the emotional residue remains.“I don’t know about Jerry, but I have no bad blood,” Parsons said. “If I saw Jerry today, I would shake hands with him and say thank you for the opportunity I had to be a Cowboy.”Forgiveness, though, is not amnesia.“There’s only two people who know the real truth — me and Jerry Jones,” Parsons said. “I’m not mad or anything. I went to another historic organization. I got paid a historic amount. So I got really nothing to be mad about in this world.”Four Pro Bowls and 52.5 sacks later, Parsons left Dallas richer, wiser, and changed. Some business decisions echo longer than wins and losses.",Micah Parsons and Jerry Jones' relationship broke long before the blockbuster trade sent the All-Pro edge rusher from Dallas to Green Bay.

Ann Michael’s all-denim Super Bowl week look puts Drake Maye’s Patriots run in the fashion spotlight

Drake Maye is five days away from Super Bowl LX, and is already shaping the biggest week of his young NFL life as the New England Patriots prepare to face the Seattle Seahawks in Santa Clara. While the focus stays on football, game week has revealed another storyline that fans cannot ignore. His wife, Ann Michael, has emerged as a defining presence around the team, blending personal style with playoff emotion as New England returns to the league’s biggest stage.The Patriots have not reached this moment since Tom Brady lifted the Lombardi Trophy in 2019. Now it is Maye, the 23-year-old former North Carolina standout, carrying the franchise back with a season that turned belief into reality. As awards buzz swirls and championship pressure builds, the spotlight has widened to include the woman standing beside him.Drake Maye arrives at Super Bowl LX with both numbers and narrative on his side. He is a finalist for the NFL MVP award after throwing for 4,394 yards, 31 touchdowns and just eight interceptions. Those numbers explain why New England trusted him as the No. 3 overall pick in the 2024 NFL Draft and why the franchise now feels reborn under center.Away from the field, Ann Michael has quietly become part of the Patriots’ playoff identity. Each round brought a new statement look, from sparkly pants in the Wild Card round to a message sweatshirt in the Divisional win and a custom Maye jacket during the snowy AFC Championship celebration. Her all-denim selfie earlier this week only added fuel to a growing fan following that now stretches well beyond New England.Their bond runs deep. They met in college, shared family ties to football through Ann’s brother Tad, and married on June 21 in North Carolina. During Super Bowl media availability on February 2, Maye spoke openly about that decision.“My teammates have the right to whatever they choose but I would definitely advise them to eventually get married,” he said. “It’s one of the best things I’ve experienced in my life. There’s no better feeling than coming home to a wife that loves you and cares for you.”He added, “I know my teammates, some of them are experiencing different parts of their life. I chose to get married young, and I don’t regret it one bit.”As the Patriots march toward kickoff on February 8, Ann Michael has evolved into a national figure, nicknamed Queen of the North by fans. From custom game day gear to her easy social media presence, she has become part of the Super Bowl story. On Sunday, she will be in the stands, cheering as her husband plays for a championship and writes the next chapter of New England football.","Drake Maye is a finalist for the NFL MVP award.

Stefon Diggs Super Bowl focus grows as on field chemistry meets off field buzz

Stefon Diggs and his New England Patriots’ teammates’ Super Bowl dream is alive for the first title game since 2018. Five days before kickoff, the focus sharpens on how this rebuilt offense plans to crack a Seattle Seahawks defense that has bullied opponents all season. Betting lines lean slightly toward Seattle, but New England believes its path runs through precision, patience, and a quarterback wide receiver bond built under pressure.That partnership belongs to Drake Maye and Diggs. The young quarterback has leaned on the veteran receiver in moments that decide games. Diggs finished the regular season with 85 catches, more than 1,000 yards, and four touchdowns. Those numbers matter now because Seattle thrives on disruption. If Maye finds rhythm early, the Patriots believe the balance of power shifts fast.Stefon Diggs enters the Super Bowl carrying more than playbook responsibility. His connection with Maye must hold against tight coverage and relentless pressure. New England’s coaches have designed this offense around timing routes and trust throws, which puts Diggs in position to shape the night with each snap. The Seahawks know it too, and their coverage plans will revolve around him.Away from football, Diggs continues to command headlines through his relationship with Cardi B. The couple went public in 2025, and her presence has followed the Patriots through this playoff run. Asked about a possible engagement, Diggs kept his focus clear and playful.""It's on the agenda, maybe,"" Diggs said when asked whether he might get engaged to Cardi B, per an article from TMZ.""Right? Right? I gotta get [my ring] first, though,"" he added.PEOPLE later noted Diggs joked again about priorities. ""I gotta get mine first,"" Diggs added.Cardi B has returned that support publicly. On February 2, she shared an Instagram story wearing Patriots colors with the caption, ""9 days till tour... LETS GO 😤,"" even as she prepares for another global music tour. Her loyalty showed earlier too. After New England clinched its Super Bowl spot in January, she rushed onto the cold field in a fur coat and green hair to celebrate.""I'm very excited for him. Very excited for the whole team, they been working their butts off,"" Cardi B shared. She praised Diggs for fighting back from an ACL injury and giving everything each week. That moment came amid serious assault allegations surrounding Diggs, a backdrop that has added tension to an already high stakes season.",Stefon Diggs and the New England Patriots face the Seattle Seahawks in the Super Bowl.

Travis Kelce’s lighthearted joke about Taylor Swift sparks buzz after accidental mishap at home



Headlines about Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift were supposed to fade this February, yet a viral podcast clip pulled them back into Super Bowl week conversations. The Kansas City Chiefs star, sidelined after a rare playoff miss, became the talk of the night, not for a catch or touchdown, but for a cracked chair and a perfectly timed joke about his future wife. The moment surfaced just days before Super Bowl LX.While the Patriots and Seahawks prepare to clash at Levi’s Stadium, Kelce is shaping the narrative off the field. His ability to command attention highlights his growing influence beyond football and explains why fans still follow his every move during the league’s biggest week.The backdrop is unusual. Kansas City finished 6-11, missing the postseason for the first time in nearly a decade of Kelce’s career. Yet the tight end leaned into the spotlight through his “New Heights” podcast, announcing a special Super Bowl preview episode with guests. The tease alone sparked interest, but the clip did the rest.As the video rolls, Jason Kelce compares a scene to dog shows, saying, “You know how they do best in show for like dogs when they trot them out?” Travis throws his head back laughing. A sharp crack follows. His expression flips from joy to shock as he tumbles backward.“Oh s---,” Jason says.“F--, Taylor’s gonna kill me,” Travis replies.The line landed because it felt real. The setting appeared casual, possibly inside Taylor Swift’s home, which only fueled speculation that the broken chair belonged to her. The podcast later shared the clip with the caption, “WARNING: This week’s episode is dangerously funny TOMORROW. SUPER BOWL PREVIEW WITH TWO SPECIAL GUESTS.”Beyond humor, the exchange shows why Kelce resonates with fans. He laughs hard, pokes fun at himself, and lets unplanned moments breathe. Even in a season that ended early, he understands timing. During Super Bowl week, when attention is scarce, he found it without trying too hard. That instinct keeps his profile high and reminds audiences why he remains one of the NFL’s most watchable personalities, even when he is not chasing a ring.","Travis Kelce's joke about Taylor Swift sparks buzz after accidental mishap at home.

Why did Taylor Swift turn down the Super Bowl LX halftime show? Was Travis Kelce the reason behind it?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/why-did-taylor-swift-turn-down-the-super-bowl-lx-halftime-show-was-travis-kelce-the-reason-behind-it/articleshow/127897023.cms,"Taylor Swift addressed rumors that she turned down the Super Bowl halftime show, clarifying there was never a formal offer. She said discussions were informal and not official negotiations. Swift also explained that her focus during NFL season, especially while Travis Kelce is playing, makes it hard to plan such a massive performance. For now, timing simply is not right.

Why Taylor Swift says the timing is not right

Taylor Swift Talks Travis Kelce's Proposal, Addresses Selena Gomez, Ed Sheeran & Super Bowl Rumors

Taylor Swift’s name surfaces every year when Super Bowl halftime rumors begin to swirl. This season was no different. Before the NFL confirmed Bad Bunny as the headliner for Super Bowl LX at Levi’s Stadium, chatter once again suggested Swift had turned down the stage. The speculation gained traction because of her close ties to the league and her relationship with Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce.Yet the truth is far less dramatic than the headlines suggest. Swift did not reject a formal offer. She addressed the narrative directly during an appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, where she clarified what actually happens behind the scenes when her name enters the conversation.Swift explained that discussions about the halftime show rarely reach the point people imagine. “Jay-Z has always been very good to me. Our teams are really close,” Swift explained, referring to Jay-Z and Roc Nation’s role in producing the show. “Sometimes they’ll call and say, ‘How does she feel about it?’ That’s not an official offer or a conference-room conversation.”She also shut down the idea that ownership of performance footage played any role in her decision.Instead, her reasoning centers on focus and timing. With Kelce competing deep into the NFL season in recent years, Swift says her attention is fully on the field.She calls the sport “violent chess,” describing players as “gladiators without swords,” and admitted she cannot imagine planning choreography while Kelce is on the field every week.“Can you imagine if he’s out there putting his life on the line,” she joked, “and I’m like, ‘I wonder what my choreo should be?’ This has nothing to do with Travis – he would love for me to do it. I’m just too locked in.”For now, Swift is not closing the door on the Super Bowl halftime show. She is simply choosing her moment.","Taylor Swift addressed rumors that she turned down the Super Bowl halftime show. She said discussions were informal and not official negotiations.

Streaming March 21, 2026, the Seoul concert blends music, heritage, and spectacle, followed by a March 27 documentary offering an intimate look at the group’s return, growth, and renewed connection with fans.

A Super Bowl-level vision changes BTS's return

BTS will not be back in the spotlight. People are saying that their return is a global cultural event, like the biggest live events in the world. After finishing their required military service, the group is starting a new chapter. They are putting out a big Netflix movie that fans all over the world can watch that combines music, location, and visual storytelling.Because of the creative vision behind it, this comeback is more than just a regular concert film. Hamish Hamilton, who directed the Super Bowl halftime show this year and last year, is working with BTS. This means that the quality of their work will be the same as that of the biggest night in football. The show is in the middle of Seoul and combines pop culture from around the world with cultural symbols.On March 21, 2026, the concert will be held in Gwanghwamun Square and will be streamed live. The background will be Gyeongbokgung Palace. This choice makes the performance more than just a stage show. It becomes a picture conversation between Korean culture and modern pop.Hamish Hamilton has been in charge of the Super Bowl halftime show since 2010.Every year, he directs it and makes it look like a movie. He began with The Who at Super Bowl XLIV and then moved on to a number of well-known acts, including Madonna (Super Bowl XLVI), Beyoncé (Super Bowl XLVII), and Bruno Mars (Super Bowl XLVIII).Later, Hamilton directed popular shows by Katy Perry (Super Bowl XLIX) and Coldplay at Super Bowl 50, followed by big performances by Lady Gaga (Super Bowl LI) and Justin Timberlake (Super Bowl LII). In recent years, he directed the visually bold halftime shows with The Weeknd (Super Bowl LV), the historic hip-hop showcase at Super Bowl LVI, and continued through Super Bowl LIX in 2025. This makes him the clear mastermind behind the halftime show.The BTS Netflix documentary that comes out on March 27 opens a quieter door into the process of coming back. Rehearsals, private thoughts, and the emotional weight of coming back after a long time away are all very important. It doesn't rely on spectacle; it relies on honesty and being there.The concert and the documentary together tell the whole story. One praises how well someone does. The other one shows that it has a purpose. This isn't just a comeback for BTS and their fans all over the world. It's a well-told story about time, growth, and making friends.","BTS is staging their comeback as a cinematic Netflix event directed by Hamish Hamilton, the longtime Super Bowl halftime show architect.

Jaxson Dart shows softer side as girlfriend Marissa Ayers’ viral hometown date night wins over NFL fans



Jaxson Dart and Marissa Ayers became a trending topic far from the practice field, and it happened during a simple hometown stop. The New York Giants rookie quarterback is back in the news after a TikTok video with his girlfriend lit up social media, offering fans a glimpse of his life beyond football while reinforcing why optimism around the franchise keeps growing.For a Giants team coming off a rough four win season, moments like these matter. They humanize a young roster led by fresh leadership and emerging talent. Dart’s connection with Ayers has quietly followed his first NFL year, but this latest post pushed that story into the national spotlight.The buzz began on February 2 when Ayers shared a nearly six-minute TikTok from Kaysville, Utah, Dart’s hometown. The couple visited his favorite local spot, JCW Burgers, and turned a casual meal into a full mukbang style review. From strawberry milkshakes to burgers, fries, and wings, their reactions felt relaxed and genuine. At one point, both handed out a perfect score, signaling clear approval.The response was instant. The video pulled in close to one million views within about 20 hours, a reminder of Ayers’ digital reach and Dart’s growing profile. If there was any doubt about where the relationship stands, the setting said plenty. Visiting a hometown carries weight, especially during an NFL offseason packed with training and recovery.Ayers had already hinted at the strength of their bond days earlier. In a January 27 TikTok montage, she traced their journey from first date to snowy winter clips, writing, “I have been totally off grid but feeling like the happiest girl in the world,” and adding, “I owe you all a recap so here it is…. 💛”. The video confirmed their first date came in October, followed by Broadway plans in New York City and a Halloween celebration that first sparked dating rumors.On the field, Dart closed his rookie season on January 4 after being taken in the first round out of Ole Miss. Despite injuries and a thin roster, he flashed mobility, toughness, and a confident arm. Those traits, paired with the Giants’ recent draft moves and new coaching direction, explain why fans are watching closely.Off the field, Ayers continues to build her own profile. With more than two million followers across platforms, the University of Alabama graduate gained national attention during the Taylor Serrano bout at Madison Square Garden. Together, their worlds now intersect, blending football promise with modern celebrity reach.","New York Giants rookie quarterback Jaxson Dart and girlfriend Marissa Ayers went on a date in Kaysville, Utah.

“Inappropriate to people”: Bill Belichick’s relationship with Jordon Hudson was reportedly seen as “creepy” by HOF voters,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/inappropriate-to-people-bill-belichicks-relationship-with-jordon-hudson-was-reportedly-seen-as-creepy-by-hof-voters/articleshow/127887487.cms,"Bill Belichick was reportedly left out of the Pro Football Hall of Fame amid concerns that extended beyond his on-field legacy. Sources claim voters felt uncomfortable with the public attention surrounding his relationship with Jordon Hudson, calling the optics distracting. Despite strong support from Tom Brady, legacy timing and perception allegedly influenced the decision.

Bill Belichick’s Hall of Fame wait sparks uncomfortable questions beyond football

The shock surrounding Bill Belichick’s absence from the 2026 Pro Football Hall of Fame ballot continues to ripple across the NFL world. For a coach whose résumé includes six Super Bowl titles and decades of dominance, the omission felt jarring. Yet behind closed doors, the discussion reportedly drifted away from playbooks and trophies, settling instead on optics, timing, and personal scrutiny.According to multiple insiders, Belichick’s relationship with his much younger partner became an unavoidable topic during the voting process. While no rules were broken and no professional lines were crossed, voters were said to wrestle with how public perception could shape the legacy moment. In a process built on reputation and image as much as achievement, discomfort carried weight.Sources familiar with the Hall of Fame deliberations claim the relationship was openly debated, not quietly dismissed. One insider revealed, ""This wasn't whispered — it was discussed. People kept asking, 'Do we really want this to be part of his legacy right now?' The word 'creepy' came up more than once."" For voters who see themselves as guardians of football history, the concern was less moral and more reputational.Timing played a critical role. Another insider said, ""The timing killed him. If this had surfaced years after his induction, no one would care. But voters vote on legacy, not just stats."" As Belichick transitioned into college coaching, increased public visibility only amplified the scrutiny.Public appearances added fuel. Hudson’s presence on the field before games and her outspoken responses to criticism reportedly unsettled observers. ""It started to feel inappropriate to people,"" one source explained.""Not illegal. Not immoral. But deeply uncomfortable. And voters see themselves as guardians of the game's image."" Another added, ""That made it worse. It reinforced the sense that this was becoming a sideshow.""Even advocacy from longtime quarterback Tom Brady failed to sway the outcome. Brady publicly defended his former coach, saying, ""I don't understand it. I mean, I was with him every day. If he's not a first-ballot Hall of Famer, there's really no coach that should ever be a first-ballot Hall of Famer, which is completely ridiculous because people deserve it.""He added, ""He's incredible. There's no coach I'd rather play for. If I'm picking one coach to go out there to win a Super Bowl -- give me one season -- I'm taking Bill Belichick. So that's enough said.""For now, Bill Belichick remains on the outside, waiting for football to reclaim the final word over perception.","Sources claim voters felt uncomfortable with the public attention surrounding his relationship with Jordon Hudson.

Fact check: Did Mark Wahlberg speak out against Bad Bunny’s Super Bowl performance and ask him to return to Puerto Rico,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/fact-check-did-mark-wahlberg-speak-out-against-bad-bunnys-super-bowl-performance-and-ask-him-to-return-to-puerto-rico/articleshow/127886074.cms,"A viral video last year falsely claimed Mark Wahlberg told Bad Bunny to return to Puerto Rico after his Super Bowl LX halftime announcement. The clip used narration without evidence. No verified footage or credible reports supported the claim, and Wahlberg never commented on Bad Bunny’s performance, confirming the video was misleading.

Did Mark Wahlberg really comment on Bad Bunny’s Super Bowl halftime role?

Viral outrage spreads quickly, particularly when it touches on culture, politics and the Super Bowl. In the fall of last year, a brief Instagram video caused strong opinions to spread saying that Mark Wahlberg had swung at Bad Bunny in regards to his upcoming halftime performance. The statement went viral, given the political tension and controversial discourse on the language and identity of pop culture.The timing made the rumor especially combustible. Just weeks earlier, the NFL confirmed Bad Bunny as the halftime headliner for Super Bowl LX, drawing both celebration and backlash. During his Saturday Night Live monologue, Benito joked that Americans had four months to learn Spanish ahead of the show. That humor did not land well with everyone, and online criticism followed almost immediately.The viral video in question, shared by @kingtretainment, framed Wahlberg as responding directly to that joke. The clip opened with a dramatic voiceover stating, ""Mark Wahlberg's bold shot at Bad Bunny ignites the internet."" It then alleged that Wahlberg had replied to Benito with, ""Maybe you should go back to Puerto Rico."" The video closed by asking viewers, ""Is this just pride or something more dangerous?""Despite the traction the video gained, the accusation did not hold up.There was no verified footage, no direct statement, and no reporting from major outlets to support the claim. Given Wahlberg’s public profile, any such remark would have triggered immediate and widespread coverage. It did not.Commenters instead pointed to Wahlberg’s past controversies, including a widely reported assault incident from his teenage years that he later addressed and apologized for through a formal petition. That history resurfaced in online discussions, but it remained unrelated to Bad Bunny’s Super Bowl role.This turned out to be the ultimate realization that Wahlberg did not even mention Bad Bunny in relation to his halftime show. The viral clip was based on narration, implication and timing as opposed to evidence. In a time where fake news tends to thrive on indignation, this was a wake-up call that not all things trending on social media are true, even when they seem plausible.","A viral video last year falsely claimed Mark Wahlberg told Bad Bunny to return to Puerto Rico after his Super Bowl LX halftime announcement.

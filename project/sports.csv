Brain-fade moment! Pakistan batter runs himself out at U19 World Cup – WATCH,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/icc-u-19-world-cup/brain-fade-moment-pakistan-batter-runs-himself-out-at-u19-world-cup-watch/articleshow/126600295.cms,"Bangladesh cricket in turmoil: What it means for the T20 World Cup?

NEW DELHI: England U-19 began their ICC Under-19 World Cup 2026 campaign with a convincing yet dramatic 37-run victory over Pakistan in the seventh match of the tournament, played in Harare on Friday. While the margin suggested comfort, the contest was anything but straightforward, ending in a bizarre moment that quickly became one of the talking points of the competition.Asked to bat first, England were bowled out for 210 in 46.5 overs after Pakistan’s disciplined bowling effort kept them in check for most of the innings. Middle-order batter Caleb Falconer anchored the English innings with a composed 66 off 73 balls, striking three boundaries and two sixes at crucial moments. Pakistan’s bowlers shared the spoils, with Ahmed Hussain leading the attack with figures of 3 for 38, while Ali Raza (2/36), Abdul Subhan (2/24) and Momin Qamar (2/45) also impressed.In reply, Pakistan’s chase showed promise early on, largely due to captain Farhan Yousaf’s calm and responsible knock. Yousaf top-scored with a gritty 65, steadying the innings as wickets fell around him and keeping Pakistan within reach of the target of 211. However, once the skipper was dismissed in the 41st over, the momentum shifted firmly in England’s favour.The pressure intensified on the lower order, with the final pair of Momin Qamar and Ali Raza attempting to prolong the contest.Pakistan were 173 for 9 when the match took an extraordinary turn in the 47th over. In a moment of poor awareness, Raza wandered out of his crease without attempting a run, allowing England captain and wicketkeeper Thomas Rew to react sharply and break the stumps.Replays confirmed Raza was short of his ground, sealing Pakistan’s fate in a dismissal many described as comical. England’s bowlers eventually dismissed Pakistan for 173 in 46.3 overs, sealing a memorable win. England will next face Zimbabwe on January 18, while Pakistan aim to regroup against Scotland on January 19.",England U-19 beat Pakistan by 37 runs in the seventh match of the ICC Under-19 World Cup 2026.

World Cup reality

Poll Which format do you think Connolly's talent is best suited for? Test Cricket One Day Internationals T20 Cricket

For Cooper Connolly, the last 18 months have unfolded at a pace that has barely allowed him to pause, let alone reflect. International debuts across formats, a five-wicket haul against South Africa, an Indian Premier League (IPL) contract worth Rs 3 crore with Punjab Kings, and now a place in Australia’s T20 World Cup squad. It is the kind of rapid ascent that defines a generation, yet Connolly himself admits he has hardly had the chance to take stock.“I think the rapid rise has been something I haven't really looked back yet. Everything's happened pretty fast over the last 12 to 18 months. I think, yeah, over the last 18 months I've sort of made my debut in all three formats. It's been pretty surreal, to be honest,” he tells TimesofIndia.com in an exclusive interaction from Perth.The speed of his journey is such that reflection has been postponed, not avoided. “I’m sure over the next couple of weeks, couple of months, I'll look back over the last little bit. But yeah, there's not a lot of time to look back because there's always cricket moving forward,” he says.What anchors the 22-year-old, though, is perspective. Connolly understands what it means to wear the Australian colours.“It's obviously an honour to represent your country in all three formats.And I think obviously getting a little bit of taste in all three makes you want it a little bit more,” adds Connolly.That hunger has become a defining feature of Connolly’s rise. There is no sense of arrival, only momentum.“So yeah, just looking forward to getting stuck in and playing some cricket. But yeah, it's been a whirlwind sort of 18 months and yeah, I feel very privileged to be in the position I'm in at the moment,” says the Australian all-rounder.Before the international caps and global stages, there was a far more ordinary setting. A school classroom. An English lesson. A phone vibrating in his pocket.“It was exciting. I got the phone call when I was still in school,” he shares.Connolly still remembers the exact moment. “So as exciting as it was at school, I was actually in an English class and told my teacher that I have to go outside to take an important phone call. I went outside, took the phone call and yeah, it was pretty surreal.”Western Australia had offered him a rookie contract, a moment that instantly shifted his understanding of what cricket could become.“I guess the phone call that told me I was going to be contracted with Western Australia as a rookie was always exciting. And I'll always remember that day. It was a great day. It made school much more enjoyable for me,” he says.Beyond the excitement it was also deeper realisation.“I think that moment when I got contracted, it was like, okay, this is potentially and hopefully where my future lies. I think at that sort of age, I was like, this is exciting. I've never experienced sort of a professional setup before,” says Connolly.Connolly’s instinct was to absorb everything around him.“I was just looking to learn and I guess get better every day that I could,” he recollects.Born in Perth, Connolly shaped his batting around fellow Western Australia batter Shaun Marsh . Incidentally, Marsh also began his IPL journey with the same franchise in 2008 and went on to finish with the Orange Cap.“I just let on some of the guys like Shaun Marsh, just some experience around the group and tried to get out as much as I could in my first couple of years.”Not many anticipated Connolly’s rise to this level would come so swiftly, but excitement around the big-hitting all-rounder with his trademark surfer-blonde locks had been growing for a while.Even before becoming the first 16-year-old since Shaun Marsh to register a half-century at an Under-19 World Cup, Connolly was already drawing notice in junior cricket at Scarborough, where his father Shane once played and later served as his coach. Through every transition, Connolly’s family remained his foundation.“Family is always important to everyone. I think mom and dad have always been really supportive of me. And they've also been my harshest critics, especially my dad,” he says.At home, cricket conversations are both grounding and constructive.“My dad's always, when I come home, he's always looking to, I guess, help me get better and always congratulating me on my success. Dad's been a great role model for me. He's obviously played cricket when he was younger and he's only just sort of given it up playing veterans,” Connolly adds.What Connolly admires most is the person his father became through the game.“He never got to the elite level as a cricketer, but just seeing him, I guess, evolve as a person and watching, I guess, the people around him, how much they enjoyed his company,” says the Perth Scorchers cricketer.Those lessons endure.“They obviously understand there's a lot more to life than just cricket,” he says.Even today, feedback is offered thoughtfully.“He does, but he doesn't touch on it too much. He just goes, what were you thinking? He sort of just takes me back to when I was younger. And I guess that feeling of what it was like to play when I was younger with the enjoyment of the game.”While Connolly avoids labelling Shaun Marsh as a formal mentor, the influence is unmistakable. Cooper Connolly has pinched Shaun Marsh's stance, his cover drive and now his playing number. But the nerveless young allrounder has made his own name en route to his international debut.“I wouldn't say he's sort of a mentor. I feel like if I could approach him if I wanted to and have a chat about cricket and how he went about it. I feel like I'm a pretty like I like to model my game a little bit on him.”Even now, Connolly studies Marsh’s innings. He reveals: “I go watch him back highlights of him making hundreds and stuff. If I could have half the career he did, I'd be pretty happy.”Connolly’s development as an all-rounder includes a pivotal bowling shift.“When I was younger, I bowled left arm pace, liked to swing the ball. I like to think I was a big tearaway fast, but I wasn't,” he laughs.At 15, he made a decisive change. “I think the decision was sort of made at about 15 to change the left-am spin. Obviously it's not as taxing on your body. Not as many injuries and not as many left-arm spinners are going around,” he reasons.Connolly’s adaptability has become one of his strongest assets. From top order to finisher, he embraces the challenge.“I've had the luxury of being able to bat in sort of most positions in the team. So I think just being versatile for me is the best thing at the moment,"" he says.“I like to sort of watch Travis Head go about it. It makes it better for teams to pick me that I can sort of bat from anywhere from one to seven,"" he adds.Now, the T20 World Cup in India and Sri Lanka looms.""I'm very excited. It's a great group to be a part of. The Australian set-up, whether it's white ball cricket or test cricket, it's a great group to be a part of. I'm really looking forward to it. It'll be nice to get over to Sri Lanka. I haven't been there since I made my test debut,"" he says.Yet the ultimate aspiration remains unchanged. “I think the pinnacle is Test cricket.”For now, Connolly continues to ride the wave, grounded by perspective and driven by curiosity.“Super stoked to have done what I've done so far. Just looking forward to hopefully playing more games for Australia.”",Cooper Connolly has made his debut in all three formats in the last 18 months. The 22-year-old says he has hardly had the chance to take stock of his rapid rise.

India vs New Zealand: 'Ravindra Jadeja needs to look at his form or...'

Former Indian cricketer Manoj Tiwary has voiced his disappointment over the recent public spat involving legendary boxer Mary Kom and her ex-husband, Karung Onkholer Kom, which has captured national attention.Speaking in a video post, Tiwary said he was deeply hurt by Mary Kom’s comments on Aap Ki Adalat, where she stated, “To be honest, he married me, and he got everything from my earning. He did not earn a single rupee.” Tiwary noted that while he has no personal connection to the matter, he is aware of the strong support systems behind national-level athletes. “As a former player, I know how much a support system matters. In Mary Kom’s case, her husband had played a significant role in her journey,” he said.Tiwary recalled that Mary Kom herself had previously acknowledged that Onkholer supported her while she trained, looked after their children, and managed other responsibilities. He expressed concern over the impact of her remarks on her ex-husband’s mental state. “To publicly humiliate someone on national television after the relationship has ended is alarming. I fear for his mental well-being,” Tiwari added.He went on to stress that in any relationship, both partners contribute in different ways at different times, and expressed gratitude for the support he has received from his own wife. “Through this video, I salute all husbands and wives who act as a strong support system for each other,” he concluded.The couple had formally separated over two years ago, completing a customary divorce under the Kom community law on December 20, 2023. Mary Kom has alleged financial misconduct by her ex-husband, claiming she lost crores of rupees, land purchased with her earnings, and that loans were taken against her property. Onkholer has denied the claims, saying he lives in a rented house in Delhi and challenging her to provide proof.While Mary Kom has stated that she does not seek police action and only wants the matter resolved, the issue continues to stir debate across social media and news platforms. Tiwary later deleted the video.","Former Indian cricketer Manoj Tiwary has voiced his disappointment over the recent public spat involving legendary boxer Mary Kom and her ex-husband, Karung Onkholer Kom.

Allan Donald on Virat Kohli’s legacy: Can he reach 100 centuries?

NAVI MUMBAI: 24 hours can be a long time in sport. A day after she was retired out while batting on 47 off 36 balls in a debatable decision by UP Warriorz head coach Abhishek Nayar, a fired-up Harleen Deol cracked a scintillating 64 not out off just 39 balls, which included 12 gloriously-timed fours, to star in her team’s morale-boosting seven-wicket over the Mumbai Indians at the DY Patil Stadium on Thursday night.Not only did Harleen ‘troll’ Nayar, who was seen applauding her every shot, with her classy display, she also played a stellar role in UPW’s first win in WPL-2026 after three defeats. They are still at the bottom of the five-team table, but UPW will take heart from the win, while MI are at the second spot with two wins and an equal number of defeats.Starting off with her first three scoring shots being fours, the India batter kept peppering the off-side boundary-10 of her fours were in that direction. While she isn’t a power-hitter, the 27-year-old relies more on her sublime timing and wonderful ability to thread gaps in the field.Looking determined to prove her worth, Harleen, a part of India's 2025 ODI World Cup winning team, added 73 in 49 balls with Aussie Phoebe Litchfield (25, 22b, 2x4, 1x6) for the third wicket, and then 44* for the fourth wicket with South African allrounder Chloe Tryon (27 not out, 11b, 4x4, 1x6) in just 20 balls as UPW cantered home with 11 balls to spare.Besides striking some fine blows in the end to help UP reach the 162-run target, Tryon took two catches- the one of MI’s in-form captain Harmanpreet Kaur 916, 11b, 1x4, 1x6), a brilliant diving effort at square leg off leggie Asha Shobhana-proving to be decisive.Earlier, MI’s openers Amanjot Kaur (38, 33b, 7x4) and ‘keeper-bat Gunalan Kamalini (5, 12b) took 44 balls while adding 43, managing just 32 in the Powerplay-the lowest in WPL-2026 so far. UPW kept things tight, with both their pacers Shikha Pandey (1-25 in four overs) and Kranti Goud (0-28 in four overs), who was bowled out at the start, delivering a fine opening spell. Both Kaur, who at least got a few boundaries, and Kamlini, who looks out of place at this level, eventually holed out.Harmanpreet, currently the top run-getter in the fourth season of the Women’s Premier League, endured a rare failure.However, it was the perfect time for Sciver-Brunt, returning in this game after missing the last match due to illness, to show off her class. Taking the responsibility of steering MI to a good total on her broad shoulders, the England captain slammed a sublime 65 off 43 balls, with her knock adorned by nine fours and a six.Sciver-Brunt found an able ally in MI’s new recruit, Australian allrounder Nicola Carey, who smashed a quickfire 32 (20b, 5x4) as the duo added 85 off just 44 balls in a fourth wicket partnership which gave MI’s innings wings and fuel at the perfect time. The duo’s fireworks helped MI, who were crawling at 54 for two after 10 overs, plunder 93 off their last eight overs after they got just 68 off the first 12. They eventually managed to put up a par total of 161 for five in 20 overs.Letting it loose, the English/Aussie duo squeezed out 33 runs in two overs-the 15th and the 16th-to give some much-needed impetus to the MI innings.If Nat-Sciver smashed two fours (both savage pull shots) a six down the ground off Shobana, collecting 17 in the 15th over, Carey took four fours off Tryon in the 16th over.",Harleen Deol scores 64 not out in UP Warriorz's seven-wicket win over Mumbai Indians.

Allan Donald on Virat Kohli’s legacy: Can he reach 100 centuries?

DHAKA: Bangladesh cricket’s simmering internal feud finally boiled over on Thursday. The flashpoint came at the Bangladesh Premier League (BPL), where a player revolt threatened to derail the tournament. With matches being cancelled as players refused to take the field, the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) removed director M Najmul Islam from his post of chairman of the finance committee with immediate effect.The decision came after two BPL games and four in the Dhaka league didn’t take place due to players’ boycott, starting with the inaugural BPL tie between Chattogram Royals and Noakhali Express. CWAB, the players’ body, was demanding Islam’s resignation for making insulting remarks against players.I n a media statement, the BCB said that after “reviewing recent developments” and “in the best interest of the organisation”, the president had released Najmul Islam from his responsibilities. The board said the decision was taken under the authority vested in the BCB president by Article 31 of the BCB constitution and was aimed at ensuring the “continued smooth and effective functioning of the board’s affairs”.Until further notice, the BCB president will serve as acting chairman of the finance committee.The BCB reiterated that cricketers’ interest “remain its highest priority” and said the board was fully committed to upholding “the honour and dignity of all players under its jurisdiction”. The statement also urged cricketers to “display the highest standards of professionalism and dedication” during what it described as a “challenging period for the game”, and to “do their utmost” to ensure participation in the BPL.The crisis erupted in the wake of Bangladesh’s request to shift their T20 World Cup matches out of India following bowler Mustafizur Rahman ’s removal from IPL team KKR. Najmul made a series of remarks that cricketers found inflammatory.“Why (should players be compensated for not playing the T20 World Cup in India)? Are we asking them to return the crores and crores of taka that we are spending on them? We are spending so much money on them, they are not being able to do anything. Have we got any international awards? Let us now ask them for the money back,” Najmul Islam had said, sparking the player revolt.Earlier, he had labelled former captain Tamim Iqbal an “Indian agent” for disagreeing with BCB’s request. It remains to be seen if removing him solely from the finance committee chairmanship will be enough to bring players back to the stadium.","Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) remove director M Najmul Islam from his post of chairman of the finance committee with immediate effect.

PROBABLE BACKUP PLANS FOR SUNDAR

Ayush Badoni:

NEW DELHI: The national selection committee and team management are sweating over Washington Sundar ’s availability for next month’s T20 World Cup after it emerged that a side strain is more serious than first anticipated and will rule the allrounder out of the T20I series against New Zealand starting next week.Sources said that the team management is already preparing backup plans for the initial stages of the tournament. TOI has learnt that the BCCI medical team has suggested that the team management wait for another week to get a proper assessment of Washington’s timeline of recovery. But it is also understood that they been advised to think of a ‘Plan B’ because the recovery period could be cutting it fine.India have other injury worries too. While Tilak Varma is only ruled out of the first three T20Is, the team management has its fingers crossed till he takes the field after having undergone an emergency abdominal surgery last week.“As of now, the selectors and the team management have to think about a backup plan. There is a strong possibility Washington may not be fully fit for the initial stages of the World Cup. A call on his participation in the entire tournament can be discussed after a thorough report by the medical team.Since India mostly play associate nations in the first round of matches, there could be a case for not naming a replacement at all, giving him enough time to recover for the business end of the tournament. One must remember that he is not expected to start in the XI even when he is fit,” a BCCI source said.Washington is supposed to report to the Centre of Excellence (CoE) during the weekend. Sources said the medical team suspects the injury could be more serious than a mere side strain. A thorough assessment will be made of the area around his ribs.Teams are allowed to make changes till seven days before the start of the tournament. India are expected to play with a spin-heavy bowling attack during the T20 World Cup with Varun Chakravarthy, Kuldeep Yadav and Axar Patel likely to be the first-choice spinners.Like-forlike option, but waiting for CoE clearance post a shoulder-injury rehab. Parag has resumed bowling and is throwing with full intensity at the BCCI’s Centre of Excellence. Fitness clearance expected as soon as next week.Another like-for-like replacement. In the last T20I series against South Africa, the left-arm spin-bowling allrounder from Bengal was called up when Axar Patel fell ill after the first two T20Is.Has been travelling with team for over a year.

BCCI medical team has suggested that the team management wait for another week to get a proper assessment of Washington’s timeline of recovery. It is understood that they been advised to think of a ‘Plan B’ because the recovery period could be cutting it fine.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126557369,imgsize-36584,width-400,resizemode-4/washington-sundar.jpg"

Bangladesh cricket in turmoil: What it means for the T20 World Cup?

WV Raman post

Former India women’s team head coach WV Raman has urged caution over the usage of 14-year-old batting sensation Vaibhav Sooryavanshi at the Under-19 level, warning that such exposure could work against the youngster’s long-term development if the bigger picture is not kept in mind.Raman’s comments came on the same day India made a winning start to their Under-19 World Cup campaign, beating the USA by six wickets via the DLS method at the Queens Sport Club in Bulawayo. Led by Ayush Mhatre, India overcame rain interruptions to go 1–0 up in Group B.Sooryavanshi has been one of the most talked-about names in Indian cricket over the past year. After making his IPL debut for Rajasthan Royals last season, he became the youngest Indian to score a century in the tournament’s history. The left-hander then continued his scoring spree across tours of Australia, England and South Africa, performances that earned him an India A call-up for the Rising Stars Asia Cup.Despite being tipped as one of India’s key players at the U19 World Cup, Raman feels the context of Sooryavanshi’s rapid rise needs careful consideration.“This could be an unpopular opinion. Suryavanshi has performed extremely well in the A series and the IPL.Making him play at the U-19 level is likely to be detrimental to his growth. He may win matches no doubt, but it should be always be about the big picture,” Raman wrote on X, formerly Twitter.On the field, Sooryavanshi endured a quiet start to the tournament. Against the USA, he lasted just four deliveries, charging down the track in an attempt to slog on the leg side before having his stumps knocked over. He departed for two, despite coming into the competition in good touch after smashing 96 off 50 balls against Scotland in India’s first warm-up game.India, however, did enough in a rain-affected contest to secure victory. Henil Patel starred with the ball, claiming five wickets as the USA were bowled out for 107 in 36 overs. Sooryavanshi also chipped in with the ball, taking the final wicket of Nitish Sudini.In the chase, Abhigyan Kundu remained unbeaten on 42, while Kanishk Chouhan added a steady 18 not out to guide India home comfortably.India will face Bangladesh next on Saturday before wrapping up their group-stage campaign against New Zealand on January 24, with Sooryavanshi expected to remain a central figure as the tournament progresses.",Former India women's team head coach WV Raman has urged caution over the usage of 14-year-old batting sensation Vaibhav Sooryavanshi at the Under-19 level.

Royal Challengers Bengaluru secured their third straight win in the Women’s Premier League with a 32-run victory over Gujarat Giants on Friday, thanks to a brilliant century partnership between Radha Yadav and Richa Ghosh and a five-wicket masterclass by off-spinner Shreyanka Patil.After being asked to bat, RCB struggled early, but Yadav (66 off 47 balls) and Ghosh (44 off 28) steadied the innings with a 105-run stand for the fifth wicket in 11 overs, helping the team recover from 43 for 4 and reach a competitive 182 for 7. Nadine de Klerk added a quickfire 26 off 12 balls to boost the total further.Gujarat Giants began their chase on a positive note, with Beth Mooney striking Lauren Bell for a boundary off the very first ball and Sophie Devine hitting consecutive fours in the next over. Mooney continued her aggressive approach, smashing Bell over mid-off for a six and following it with two more fours to keep GG in contention.RCB struck back quickly. Arundhati Reddy removed Devine, while Patil dismissed Mooney LBW. Bell then claimed skipper Ashleigh Gardner, and Patil returned to dismiss Kanika Ahuja. Wickets kept tumbling, with Georgia Wareham departing as GG slipped to 70 for 5. Bharti Fulmali’s 39 off 20 balls offered resistance, but the Giants could only manage 150 in 18.5 overs.Earlier, RCB’s innings had a shaky start as Grace Harris was trapped LBW by Kashvee Gautam, who also removed Dayalan Hemalatha. Smriti Mandhana fell to Renuka Singh, caught by Rajeshwari Gayakwad, and Gautami Naik was dismissed by Devine as the team slumped to 43 for 4.The Yadav-Ghosh partnership changed the game. They took time initially before accelerating, hitting boundaries and sixes at will. Ghosh made full use of a reprieve, smashing Wareham and Devine for maximums, while Yadav dominated with aggressive strokes. Their efforts brought up the 100-run partnership in the 16th over, setting RCB up for a comfortable win.Patil’s 5/23, supported by Bell’s 3/29, ensured Gujarat Giants could not recover, completing RCB’s third consecutive win in emphatic fashion.","Royal Challengers Bengaluru secured their third straight win in the Women’s Premier League with a 32-run victory over Gujarat Giants on Friday.

Saurashtra marched into the final of the Vijay Hazare Trophy 2025–26 with a dominant nine-wicket win over Punjab in the second semi-final on Friday, riding on a sensational unbeaten century from opener Vishvaraj Jadeja. The victory sets up a title clash against Vidarbha, scheduled for January 18.Chasing a competitive target of 292, Saurashtra made light work of the chase, finishing the job in just 39.3 overs.

He was well supported at the other end by captain Harvik Desai , who played a composed knock of 64 off 63 deliveries, striking nine boundaries. The opening pair stitched together a decisive 172-run partnership that effectively took the game away from Punjab.After Desai’s dismissal, Prerak Mankad ensured there were no late hiccups, contributing an unbeaten 52 off 49 balls with seven fours as Saurashtra cruised home. Gurnoor Brar was the only bowler to find success for Punjab, returning figures of 1 for 52.Earlier in the day, Punjab posted 291 after being asked to bat first, thanks largely to Anmolpreet Singh and Prabhsimran Singh.The pair provided stability after a steady opening stand of 60 between Prabhsimran and Harnoor Singh.

Ramandeep Singh added 42 off 38 balls, but the lower order failed to build on the platform.

Bangladesh cricket in turmoil: What it means for the T20 World Cup?

Bangladesh’s Cricketers’ Welfare Association president Mohammad Mithun has revealed that he has received death threats after speaking up for players who were subjected to derogatory remarks by a senior Bangladesh Cricket Board official.In an interview with Cricbuzz, Mithun said his stance was driven purely by concern for player welfare, especially with the T20 World Cup scheduled for next month. Bangladesh are seeking to have their four preliminary World Cup matches shifted from India to Sri Lanka, citing security concerns.The situation escalated after BCB director Najmul Islam stated that players would not be compensated if Bangladesh withdrew from the tournament in the event the ICC refused to relocate the matches.He also claimed the players had achieved little to justify any payout. In response, players across the country boycotted cricket activities.Mithun admitted the threats were a shocking and unfamiliar experience.“I've never had an experience like this. It's the first time in my life. I don't remember ever being involved in controversial talk. It's going over my head, when have I ever spoken against the country?” he said.He stressed that his comments were never intended to be political or anti-national.“I don't know how to take this or describe it as it happens with me for the first time. I haven't used any word that goes against the country; I only spoke for the interest of cricket and the players.“There is no personal issue here. Since I'm the president of an organization, if I don't talk about players' rights, what's the point of me being in this position? No one is above the country,” Mithun added.Mithun also disclosed that he has not formally informed the BCB about the threats, though he has learned that other players have received similar messages.“I haven't informed the board. To be honest, I am not picking up calls from unknown numbers on my mobile. But I can't stop messages or voice notes on WhatsApp. I was asked about this there. It's not just me; my number is available to people because it goes to the press on behalf of CWAB.“That's why I receive more. But I've heard from other players too that they have received threats, different ways and types of threats. I haven't talked to the board about this yet,” he said.Mithun admitted he feels unsure about approaching authorities for help.“I don't even know how to take help from law enforcement because I have never gone to a police station for any legal matter in my life.”Addressing the larger question of Bangladesh’s participation in the World Cup, Mithun made it clear that he wants the team to play but not at the cost of their safety.“We definitely want player safety and security. We never want anyone to go and play under a life threat. We don't want that. But at the same time, we want the player to play in the World Cup because a World Cup is a World Cup.“I believe the board and the Government will take a decision keeping the players' welfare in mind,” he said.Bangladesh’s reluctance to travel to India was preceded by pacer Mustafizur Rahman being withdrawn from the IPL on BCCI’s instructions amid attacks on Hindus in the region. While the Indian board did not officially cite that as the reason, the decision drew strong reactions from both the Bangladesh government and the BCB.",Mohammad Mithun says he has received death threats after speaking up for players.

NEW DELHI: All the players of FC Goa , including India's national team captain Sandesh Jhingan, along with all the support staff, have accepted a cut in their salaries for the short ISL season of 2025-26, which commences from February 14. A statement made by the club said that it was indeed an act of selflessness in which Indian football is going through so many fluctuations.Posting on X late Thursday, FC Goa said it had held “honest and difficult conversations” with its players as well as staff about some of the challenges presently being faced by the league, as well as itself. It added that the first-team players and technical staff voluntarily agreed to reduce their remuneration, underlining the unity within the squad during a difficult period.“In a moment of real uncertainty for Indian football, our club had honest and difficult conversations about the challenges we are facing. What followed was something that made us incredibly proud,” the club wrote.The club expressed that they were very grateful for this gesture and that this decision had been anything but easy. FC Goa also expressed that this gesture embodied the character and collective spirit that the group has, as the club is more than what transpires on the pitch.It is more than mere performances and achievements. Apart from Jhingan, the squad also consists of India internationals such as Udanta Singh and Boris Singh.This comes against the backdrop of ISL clubs still struggling financially due to the impact of the termination of the Master Rights Agreement (MRA) between the All India Football Federation (AIFF) and its former commercial partner Football Sports Development Limited (FSDL) in the month of December. This led to the league being subjected to a waiting period of nearly six months.After the intervention of the sports minister, Mansukh Mandaviya , and a series of negotiations with the teams, all 14 ISL clubs are now confirmed to participate in the season with an aggregated 91 matches to be played in the home and away format with each team set to play a total of 13 matches.In the new format, the clubs will together shoulder 60% of the operating expenses of the league, pegged at Rs 25 crore. At the same time, the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) has waived the mandatory match eligibility criterion to qualify for the AFC Champions League 2, though the ISL league champions no longer qualify automatically for the group stage. Since they won the Super Cup, FC Goa will qualify for the AFC Champions League 2.",All the players of FC Goa have accepted a cut in their salaries for the short ISL season of 2025-26.

MANCHESTER: Michael Carrick has the chance to make a fine first impression to his short-term stint as Manchester United manager by derailing local rivals Manchester City's Premier League title challenge on Saturday.City, meanwhile, have the chance to cut the gap on leaders Arsenal to three points at Old Trafford, while United need the points to boost their chances of Champions League football next season.At the other end of the table, Tottenham's Thomas Frank and West Ham boss Nuno Espirito Santo are fighting to save their jobs as the sides clash in a London derby.AFP Sport looks at three talking points ahead of the weekend action:Carrick faces a baptism of fire with the Premier League's top two the opponents for his first two matches in charge of United.""It's what we live for (big games) - some are more challenging than others but it's why we are here. So we'll go for it head on,"" said Carrick.Before a daunting trip to Arsenal next weekend, the former United and England midfielder has the chance to galvanise a season at risk of coming completely off the rails.An FA Cup exit to Brighton last weekend followed a run of just one win in six league games for United either side of Ruben Amorim's dismissal.The Red Devils, however, remain well in contention for a place in next season's Champions League, just three points adrift of fourth-placed Liverpool.Carrick was unbeaten in a previous three-game interim spell at United after the departure of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer in 2021.Since then he gained far more managerial experience at second-tier Middlesbrough, but was sacked in June for failing to achieve promotion to the Premier League.""I understand the job, what it entails and the responsibility of it,"" added Carrick. ""Now I feel in a strong place to move forward and, hopefully, be successful here.""Both Frank and Nuno have defied speculation over their futures to remain in charge for Saturday's clash at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.Spurs have won just four of their last 17 games in all competitions to slip to 14th in the Premier League and bow out of both domestic cups.Frank is on the brink of joining a long list of managers who have failed to make the grade in north London, including Nuno, who lasted just 17 games as Tottenham boss in 2021.The Portuguese coach, already sacked once this season by Nottingham Forest, has managed just two wins in 16 Premier League games since joining the Hammers in September.West Ham desperately need a quick upturn in results as they sit seven points adrift of safety in 18th place,Top of both the Premier League and Champions League, the Gunners are on course for an unprecedented quadruple after FA and League Cup victories this week.But Mikel Arteta's men must overcome a poor record at the City Ground against a Forest side keen to make amends to their furious manager.Arsenal have won in just one of their last five visits to Nottingham.Forest were dumped out of the FA Cup by second-tier Wrexham on penalties last weekend, sparking an outburst from Sean Dyche.""It's unacceptable to me, but it's unacceptable to the badge as well,"" he said of his side's first-half performance left them battling back from 2-0 down before drawing 3-3.Fixtures (all times GMT)SaturdayManchester United v Manchester City (1230), Sunderland v Crystal Palace, Tottenham v West Ham, Liverpool v Burnley, Leeds v Fulham, Chelsea v Brentford (all 1500), Nottingham Forest v Arsenal (1730)SundayWolves v Newcastle (1400), Aston Villa v Everton (1630)MondayBrighton v Bournemouth (2000)",Michael Carrick takes charge of Manchester United for the first time on Saturday.

BARCELONA: Ferran Torres and Lamine Yamal fired Barcelona to a 2-0 win over Racing Santander and into the Copa del Rey quarter-finals on Thursday.The Spanish internationals' strikes helped holders Barca defeat second division leaders Racing to progress from a surprisingly tight last 16 clash and record an 11th consecutive victory across all competitions.The hosts had two goals disallowed for offside and record 32-time winners Barca did just enough to claim victory.""We didn't think they would be so hard to break down,"" admitted Torres to Movistar.""We knew that we had to stretch the game, be calm and in the end it went well.""Having seen Real Madrid eliminated at second-tier Albacete on Wednesday Barca coach Hansi Flick named a fairly strong side, including teenage star Yamal.After a 15 minute delay with some fans stuck outside, the match kicked off at Racing's Sardinero stadium, and Barca quickly took control of the ball.The Catalans struggled to turn possession into a meaningful opening though, and when they finally did Dani Olmo missed his kick from Marcus Rashford's dangerous cross.Racing looked to breach Barcelona's high defensive line but when they did get in behind the visitors managed to mop up well.Giorgi Guliashvili's low effort from range was fielded comfortably by Joan Garcia, and that was as close as the hosts came.Barcelona continued to push forward in the second half and Rashford had a shot tipped away and also drilled narrowly wide.Eventually the Spanish champions took the lead through Torres, after Fermin Lopez sent him through on goal. The Spain international rounded Racing goalkeeper Jokin Ezkieta and rolled home.The hosts were forced on the offensive and twice had the ball in Barcelona's net, but both of Manex Lozano's goals were ruled out for offside.Barca goalkeeper Garcia made a superb save to thwart Lozano one-on-one deep in stoppage time and avoid the game going to extra-time.Barca wrapped up their win with the last kick of the match, Yamal tapping in Raphinha's cross at the back post.""We played the game we had to play, we played a 10 out of 10 match, (with) two offside goals and the chance at the end... it's okay, it's football,"" said Racing defender Alvaro Mantilla.Elsewhere Valencia won 2-0 at Burgos to reach the last eight.",Barcelona beat Racing Santander 2-0 in Copa del Rey last 16.

There is no such system in soccer as players are either cautioned with a yellow card or sent off permanently following a red card.Luis Enrique was asked at a pre-match news conference on Thursday if he would approve of a so-called ""orange"" card, which would remove a player for 20 minutes.""We must continue to search for things like this,"" he said ahead of Friday's Ligue 1 game against Lille. ""It's important to keep evolving as a sport. As long as there are possibilities to improve, to find a more attacking football (which is) more attractive for the supporters.""Another way of improving attacking play would be to have more space on the field.""I remember (former UEFA president Michel) Platini said years ago to play with 10 players instead of 11,"" Luis Enrique said.

NEW DELHI: The All India Football Federation (AIFF) said on Thursday that the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) has recognised the shortened 2025–26 Indian Super League (ISL) season, with clubs from India eligible only for indirect entry into the AFC Champions League 2 through zonal qualifiers.Because of the delayed start to the season, Indian clubs will not be able to complete the mandatory 24 matches — across the top-tier league and domestic cup — required for direct entry into AFC club competitions.Most clubs are expected to play a total of 16 matches during the season, including at least three games in the AIFF Super Cup and 13 matches in the ISL.""With the exception of any additional slot(s) allocated to a Member Association in accordance with Articles 3.4 and 3.5, Member Associations that fail to fulfil the Member Association Eligibility Criteria shall, subject to Article 4.4, be eligible to be allocated only indirect slots for the relevant AFC Club Competition,"" the AFC said in a letter to the AIFF dated January 15.""In such cases, the number of direct slots for the relevant Member Association(s) in the relevant AFC Club Competition shall be wholly converted into indirect slots (e.g. 2+1 becomes 0+3),"" Shin Man Gil, the AFC’s deputy general secretary, competitions and football, said in the letter.The 2025–26 ISL season is scheduled to begin on February 14, with all 14 clubs confirming their participation earlier this week.A total of 91 matches will be played in the curtailed season, with each team playing 13 single-leg matches against the other teams.""In light of the foregoing, kindly be informed that, should the 2025/26 ISL s season be organised as proposed in your letter, Article 4.3 of the Entry Regulations shall apply for the purposes of entry into the relevant AFC club competitions,"" the AFC letter stated.Earlier, ISL clubs had asked the AIFF to approach the AFC for a one-time relaxation of the 24-match requirement to allow direct entry into the ACL 2.Following the clubs’ request, AIFF deputy secretary general M Satyanarayan wrote to the AFC seeking a one-time exemption.""In light of the exceptional circumstances impacting Indian football this season, we respectfully request that your esteemed office grant the AIFF and the clubs participating in the ISL, a one-time exemption from the minimum requirements set forth in the AFC Regulations.""""Specifically, we request that a minimum of sixteen (16) matches be deemed sufficient for clubs participating in the ISL to qualify for direct entry into club competitions organized by the AFC, and the ISL season scheduled to take place between 14 February 2026 and […] along with the Super Cup held between 25 October 2025 and 7 December 2025, be considered to be sufficient for the purposes of maintaining direct entry slots in the relevant club competitions organized by AFC. """"Such an exemption would significantly support the AIFF's efforts to restart the league, serve as an important encouragement to the clubs during this challenging period for all stakeholders in Indian football,"" Satyanarayan added.Last Saturday, the AIFF asked clubs to submit details of their proposed home venues so that fixtures could be prepared and broadcast and commercial partners finalised.The ISL 2025–26 season had remained uncertain since July, after the AIFF’s commercial partner Football Sports Development Limited (FSDL), owned by the Reliance Group, put the league on hold amid uncertainty over the Master Rights Agreement (MRA).The MRA expired on December 8, 2025, after negotiations between the two sides failed.",The Asian Football Confederation has recognised the shortened 2025–26 Indian Super League (ISL) season.

Jay Shah’s 2036 Olympic blueprint for India: '8 Medals won’t cut it'

MADRID: Real Madrid fell to a shock 3-2 defeat in the Copa del Rey last 16 on Wednesday as Alvaro Arbeloa's debut as coach ended in humiliation by second-tier opposition.Appointed on Monday to replace Xabi Alonso, Arbeloa and his side were ousted by Jefte Betancor's stoppage-time winner at the Carlos Belmonte stadium.Without French superstar Kylian Mbappe and various other key players, Arbeloa's side struggled against a side currently 17th in Spain's second division.Albacete took the lead through Javi Villar but Franco Mastantuono equalised just before half-time.Jefte put the hosts back ahead after 82 minutes and then scored the winner after Gonzalo Garcia's 91st-minute goal looked to have forced extra time for the 15-time European champions.""Here at this club a draw is already bad -- it's a tragedy. Imagine a defeat like this, it's painful,"" Arbeloa told reporters.""I'm sure all our fans feel the same way. Even more so when it happens against a team from a lower division, although we already know here how tough any opponent can be.""If anyone is responsible and to blame for this outcome, it's clearly me, the one who made the decisions regarding the line-up, how we wanted to play, the substitutions.""I can only thank the players for the way they welcomed me, for the effort they put in today.""After Madrid lost the Spanish Super Cup final on Sunday against rivals Barcelona, President Florentino Perez replaced Alonso with reserve team coach Arbeloa.The Spaniard selected two players currently playing in the reserves he led until Monday -- holding midfielder Jorge Cestero and right-back David Jimenez.As well as Mbappe he left out players including goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois and Jude Bellingham, to rest ahead of the return to La Liga action on Saturday against Levante.""I'd do the same again, I brought a team capable of winning,"" said Arbeloa.The first half was mostly played under heavy gloom, not just Madrid's mood but an intense fog which set in a few minutes into the game.Vinicius Junior smashed high and wide from long range as neither side produced any clear chances until shortly before half-time when the hosts took a shock lead.Villar escaped Mastantuono's attentions at a corner and nodded Albacete in front after 42 minutes.Arbeloa's side levelled before the breakthrough, also capitalising on a corner, with Mastantuono turning home from close range.- Jefte's double -Albacete frustrated Madrid after the break and then burst into life in attack to take the lead once more.Andriy Lunin pushed away an effort from Riki but shortly afterwards Jefte put Alberto Gonzalez's side ahead.Gonzalo Garcia's clearance fell to the striker in the box and he fired down into the ground with ball bouncing up and flashing past Lunin.Madrid's young forward made amends by pulling his team level in stoppage time with a well-placed header.However, there was a sting in the tale as Jefte produced a sensational lofted finish past Lunin to snatch a famous late victory for Albacete, their first ever against Real Madrid.""I'm not afraid of failure, I can understand that someone would want to call this defeat that,"" added Arbeloa.""Failure is on the path to success, for me they are not in opposite directions.""Madrid captain Dani Carvajal, who came on as a substitute and could not stop Jefte's winner, said the players would work hard to revert the club's slump.""We're not at our best moment, we have to work hard, we all have to give a lot more, it's a reality,"" Carvajal told reporters.""We ask for forgiveness for the fans. We were not up to the level of this club, me first of all, and we will give our lives in the next games and months (to turn it around).""Elsewhere Real Betis beat Elche 2-1 and Alaves defeated Rayo Vallecano 2-0 to reach the quarter-finals.Holders Barcelona visit second division leaders Racing Santander on Thursday.",Real Madrid lose 3-2 to Albacete in the Copa del Rey last 16 on Wednesday.

Kylie Shanahan shared a crucial update amid George Kittle Achilles surgery

The San Francisco 49ers received a rare piece of good news this postseason. It came not on the field but from the operating room. George Kittle, the heart of the team’s offense, underwent Achilles surgery earlier this week, and early signs point in the right direction.Kittle’s injury shocked the 49ers during their NFC wild-card win over the Philadelphia Eagles on January 12, 2026. He went down early in the second quarter after securing a short reception. Medical staff carted him off the field, and he did not return. Within days, the team confirmed a torn Achilles tendon, one of the toughest injuries for any NFL skill player.The injury occurred on Kittle’s second catch of the night at Lincoln Financial Field. He planted his right foot as he turned upfield and immediately collapsed. The 49ers held on for a 23–19 win, but the locker room mood remained tense as teammates waited for clarity on Kittle’s status.That clarity arrived on January 16, when head coach Kyle Shanahan addressed reporters during his weekly press conference in Santa Clara. Shanahan confirmed Kittle’s surgery went well and hinted at a recovery timeline that may look different than older Achilles cases.“I talked to him through text,” Shanahan said during Friday’s media availability on Jan 16. “He sent a funny picture of himself after surgery to my wife. He seemed to be feeling pretty good. I heard it went great, and it was a successful surgery. He has a chance to come back a lot sooner than we used to think back in the day with Achilles injuries.”Kittle finished the 2025 regular season with 74 receptions for 1,041 yards and eight touchdowns, once again serving as Brock Purdy’s most reliable target in big moments. His absence removes a major red-zone threat and a key blocker from San Francisco’s system. Wide receiver Ricky Pearsall added another update on Jan. 15 during an interview on 95.7 The Game. He said Kittle already appeared upbeat during a FaceTime call.“He’s playing video games already,” Pearsall said. “He’s in good spirits. That’s just George.”The 49ers now turn to Luke Farrell and Jake Tonges at tight end as they prepare to face the Seattle Seahawks in the divisional round on January 18. With Nick Bosa already lost for the season, San Francisco faces growing pressure to stay healthy.No return date has been set yet for Kittle. Still, Shanahan’s update gave the locker room something it needed.

What Sam Darnold’s status means for Seattle’s depth chart and game plan



Seahawks quarterback Sam Darnold was listed questionable for Saturday’s NFC divisional round matchup against the 49ers after suffering a new oblique injury. The injury, which occurred during Thursday practice, forced Darnold to leave early after he “felt a little something” in his left side while throwing, according to ESPN. Despite the sudden setback, both Darnold and Seahawks coach Mike Macdonald remain confident that he will take the field against their NFC West rivals.Darnold has been central to Seattle’s remarkable 14-3 season, earning a second consecutive Pro Bowl nod in his first year with the team. His presence under center has been a stabilizing force for the Seahawks’ offense, and his potential absence raises questions about how Seattle will adjust in a high-stakes playoff environment. Macdonald emphasized that the “questionable” designation is a precaution, noting, “We listed him as questionable, really optimistic he’s going to be able to play. Right now we’re going through all the protocols out of caution just to make sure we’re ready to go.”If Darnold plays, the Seahawks can maintain their full offensive structure, including complex motion packages, protection checks, and timing-based throws.Backup quarterback Drew Lock, who started two games for Seattle in 2023 and five games for the Giants last year, is prepared to step in if needed, but his limited experience makes Darnold’s availability crucial. Rookie Jalen Milroe also provides depth, though the combined experience of the backups is just six pass attempts this season.Keeping Darnold healthy allows the Seahawks’ receivers and offensive line to practice at the same speed and cadence they expect on game day, preserving timing and rhythm. Seattle defeated San Francisco 13-3 in Week 18, and both teams enter Saturday’s clash with momentum- San Francisco after a 23-19 playoff win over the Eagles. The winner advances to face either the Bears or Rams, keeping the road to the Super Bowl firmly in sight.Seattle’s strategy appears to hinge on Darnold taking the field, and if he does, the Seahawks can execute their game plan without major adjustments. For fans and the team, it’s a critical test of resilience and depth as they look to defend their NFC top seed.Also Read: Sam Darnold Injury: Will the Seahawks QB play on Saturday against 49ers?","Seahawks quarterback Sam Darnold was listed questionable for Saturday’s NFC divisional round matchup against the 49ers after suffering a new oblique injury.

How do their net worths compare?

Endorsements and off-field income

Travis Kelce and Dak Prescott are two of the most well-known players in the NFL. They have made a lot of money through contracts and other things. Even though they play different positions and in different markets, both of them are among the highest-paid players in the league. Take a deeper look at how their net worths stack up when you look at their salary, contracts, sponsorships, and business moves.According to Celebrity Net Worth, Travis Kelce's net worth is estimated to be around $90 million. He has built it up carefully over more than ten years with the Kansas City Chiefs. And Dak Prescott is also worth over $90 million. His wealth has grown a lot in the last few years because he earned record-breaking contracts with the Dallas Cowboys as a quarterback.While the totals may look the same on paper, the paths to those numbers are extremely different.Kelce entered the NFL in 2013 and earned just under $80 million in salary across his first 10 seasons. His biggest paydays came with a five-year, $46 million extension in 2016 and a two-year, $34.25 million extension signed in 2024, which pushed his career earnings beyond the $100 million mark. For a tight end, Kelce has consistently remained near the top of the pay scale.Prescott’s rise has been far more dramatic. After outperforming expectations as a fourth-round pick, he secured a four-year, $160 million deal in 2021. He then reset the market in 2024 with a four-year, $240 million contract, making him the first NFL player to cross $60 million per year in average salary.Both athletes are quite rich because of endorsements, but Kelce is more famous right now. He makes roughly $5 million a year from working with brands like Nike, McDonald's, State Farm, Bud Light, and others. His fame has grown even more because of his media appearances, his success with podcasts, and his exposure to pop culture.Prescott has also signed big endorsement deals with big brands like Adidas, AT&T, Pepsi, Beats by Dre, and others. His sponsorships have made him more than $50 million over his career, given to the Cowboys' massive global fan base and his status as a franchise quarterback.Kelce’s financial profile extends beyond football and ads. The “New Heights” podcast, co-hosted with his brother Jason Kelce, landed a reported $100 million deal with Amazon’s Wondery, significantly boosting his long-term earning potential. He has also invested in brands like Casa Azul Tequila.Prescott has focused more on traditional investments, real estate, and philanthropy through his Faith Fight Finish Foundation, while continuing to prioritise football earnings.While Dak Prescott clearly leads in salary and contract value, Travis Kelce’s diversified income streams especially media and branding help keep their net worths remarkably close. In short, Prescott dominates the quarterback pay scale, while Kelce maximises star power beyond the field.",Travis Kelce and Dak Prescott are two of the most well-known players in the NFL.

Inside the emotional locker room message Mike Tomlin delivered before leaving the Steelers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/inside-the-emotional-locker-room-message-mike-tomlin-delivered-before-leaving-the-steelers/articleshow/126596193.cms,"Mike Tomlin ended his 19-year run with the Steelers through a private, emotional locker room message that stunned players and staff. Despite a strong overall record, playoff frustrations pushed him to step away voluntarily for the first time. The decision left the locker room shaken, marked the end of an era in Pittsburgh, and opened the door to a possible broadcasting future.

Mike Tomlin’s farewell reshapes the Steelers future

Mike Tomlin did not walk away quietly. The final words he delivered inside the Pittsburgh locker room landed with the force of a season-ending hit. After nearly two decades of setting the tone for the Pittsburgh Steelers, Tomlin chose honesty over ceremony. The message was private, emotional, and unforgettable. It marked the end of a coaching era few believed would ever truly end.For players, the shock was immediate. Tomlin had never resigned voluntarily at any level. His presence felt permanent, stitched into the fabric of the franchise. Yet on January 13, the room went still when he spoke. According to a team source, Tomlin told them, “You deserve better, and right now I can’t deliver. Someone else has to move the franchise forward.” The words cut deep because they came from a coach who demanded more from himself than anyone else.Tomlin leaves behind numbers most coaches dream of. A 193-112-2 regular season record and a reputation for never posting a losing year. Still, postseason frustration weighed heavily. Seven playoff trips in ten years produced only one win beyond the Wild Card round. For Tomlin, that gap mattered.His standard never softened, even when the résumé stayed elite.The emotional fallout revealed how much he meant. Reports described T.J. Watt fighting tears, while Aaron Rodgers repeated apologies under his breath. One unnamed player summed it up bluntly, saying Tomlin was the only coach men would run through walls for. The city wanted a breakthrough. The locker room wanted it for him even more.Owner Art Rooney II tried to keep the door open. He hoped for one more year. Tomlin declined. Rooney later explained, “Mike indicated that he did not anticipate coaching at least in the near future,” adding that family time and long-delayed personal moments now come first.Though Tomlin still has two years left on his contract, many believe this chapter is final. His voice, however, is not leaving football. FOX executives reportedly admire his sharp insight and signature phrasing. A studio role could follow. For now, the Steelers move forward without the man who defined them, while Tomlin steps away on his own terms, loyal to the standard he lived by.Also Read: Why did Mike Tomlin exit the Pittsburgh Steelers?

"""Things are changing”: Insider reveals that career doubts are creating distance for Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/things-are-changing-insider-reveals-that-career-doubts-are-creating-distance-for-taylor-swift-and-travis-kelce/articleshow/126595915.cms,"Travis Kelce’s early playoff exit has sparked major questions about retirement, identity, and timing, placing unexpected pressure on his relationship with Taylor Swift. As Kelce weighs another NFL season against life beyond football, wedding plans are reportedly paused. Swift remains supportive, shifting focus from celebration to stability while Kelce navigates the most uncertain chapter of his career to date now.

Is there serious strain on the Taylor Swift-Travis Kelce relationship right now?

Is there serious strain on the Taylor Swift-Travis Kelce relationship has become the question hovering over an offseason that was meant to feel lighter. For Travis Kelce, January did not end with another title chase. It ended with silence, reflection, and a sudden pause on plans that once felt certain.The early playoff exit forced Kelce into unfamiliar territory. Retirement talk is no longer background noise. It sits front and center, alongside wedding expectations and the pressure of redefining life after football. For the first time in years, the next step is unclear, and that uncertainty has rippled into his personal world with Taylor Swift.Sources say the emotional toll is real. One insider told the Daily Mail, ""Travis is a bit defeated right now,"" adding, ""He is used to still be playing, and he is missing not being on the field, which might bode well for his fans and the Chiefs if he decides to play another year.""That decision carries weight beyond the locker room. Wedding planning has reportedly slowed as football takes priority. Another source explained, ""Travis will make the Chiefs well aware of his future plans by early March.We will know a few weeks after the Super Bowl if he will be returning or not. That is his timeline that he has set to make a decision to play one more year or not.""Those close to the couple insist this phase is more about support than strain. Swift has shifted from stadium celebrations to quieter moments, giving space where it matters most. As one source put it, ""Taylor is trying to put him in a better mood by spending more time with him and not bombarding him with wedding plans. She would want him to focus on the wedding after he makes his career decision because she knows how important that is to him. ""The pressure is layered. Fame, family expectations, and the end of a lifelong routine collide at once. Another insider summed it up plainly: ""Things are changing he is getting to the end of what he has known all his life and dealing with potential retirement marriage and a future family with sprinkles of a whole new life in TV,"" calling it ""stressful and life altering.""Whether Kelce returns to the Kansas City Chiefs or steps into a new chapter, the coming weeks will test more than his body. They will test patience, trust, and the strength of a relationship learning how to grow under pressure.Also Read: Travis Kelce reportedly causing tension with Taylor Swift as insiders hint at stress over life after football","Travis Kelce's early playoff exit has sparked major questions about retirement, identity, and timing.

Was trust the issue? Alix Earle reveals why she never checked Braxton Berrios’ phone before splitting



Alix Earle relationship confession comes at a moment when fans are still processing her quiet split from NFL wide receiver Braxton Berrios. Speaking candidly, the 25 year old influencer peeled back layers of vulnerability that feel raw, relatable, and carefully unfiltered. Instead of drama, her words centered on trust, security, and the emotional choices people make behind closed doors.That honesty surfaced during the debut episode of her new interview series, Get Real With Me. Sitting across from close friend Jake Shane, Earle did not dodge uncomfortable truths. She leaned into them. The result was not gossip bait but a revealing look at how trust shaped one of her most public relationships, even after it ended.During a lighthearted game, Earle admitted she has snooped through past partners’ phones. She did not sugarcoat it.“Of course, everyone’s,” Alix, 25, told Jake Shane during the debut episode of her Get Real With Me series on Jan. 15. “Except I’ve never gone through Braxton’s phone. I think every other boyfriend. Phones, laptops.”That exception, she explained, was not accidental.“I never went through his phone,” she told Jake.“Because I trusted him.”The admission arrived just weeks after the couple confirmed their breakup. In December, Earle addressed fans directly, choosing honesty over silence.“Braxton and I are no longer together,” she tearfully told fans in a Dec. 13 TikTok video. “We have been doing long distance since, basically, June and we haven’t gotten to see each other that often. It’s just been really difficult for me.”Despite the split, there was no public bitterness. Days later, she quietly liked Berrios’ Instagram post supporting the nonprofit PetSet, a small action fans quickly noticed. Since then, both have stayed mostly silent, letting actions speak instead of statements.Earle also turned the lens inward, admitting that her biggest hurdle is not betrayal but commitment.“My commitment issues,” Alix told Jake during a segment in Get Real With Me. “I just feel like committing to anything. Like I change my mind every other day.”It is a confession that reframes her breakup less as an ending and more as a moment of growth. Not perfect. Just real.Also Read: Drake Maye’s wife Ann Michael turns heads in Patriots-inspired red winter look before New England’s high-stakes Texans showdown","Alix Earle and NFL wide receiver Braxton Berrios split in December.

Randi Mahomes sparks concern with unexpected home incident amid Patrick Mahomes' recovery,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/randi-mahomes-sparks-concern-with-unexpected-home-incident-amid-patrick-mahomes-recovery/articleshow/126567975.cms,"Randi Mahomes went viral after sharing a lighthearted kitchen mishap that set off her home’s smoke alarms. The moment offered a rare, relatable glimpse into the Mahomes family during a demanding offseason, as Patrick Mahomes continues his recovery from a serious knee injury and prepares for the upcoming NFL season.

Randi Mahomes’ lighthearted moment offers balance during Patrick Mahomes’ recovery

The offseason around Patrick Mahomes has been heavy with rehab talk and long timelines. Then, unexpectedly, a kitchen mishap cut through the seriousness. It was not about football or recovery charts. It was about smoke alarms, good intentions, and a mother laughing at herself online.In a moment that felt refreshingly ordinary, Randi Mahomes reminded fans that even in high-profile households, life still happens in small, messy ways. And sometimes, that matters more than any update from the training room.Randi Mahomes sparked smiles across social media after sharing a New Year’s cooking attempt that went sideways. Posting on X, she admitted her latest resolution triggered every smoke alarm in the house. “Started this 2026 cooking thing and set off all my smoke alarms in my house...trying... i can do this lol.”The post resonated because it arrived during a tense stretch for the Mahomes family. Patrick Mahomes is still working his way back from a torn ACL and LCL that ended the Kansas City Chiefs season early. While his rehab has shown promise, the focus remains cautious, and most headlines have leaned serious.Cooking has long been a running joke in the family. Years earlier, Patrick struggled to name a favourite dish his mother made, admitting she “doesn't really cook.” Randi later embraced that memory during a 2024 interview, recalling how she teased him afterward. “I said, 'Well, you could have told them I make a mean Chick-fil-A sandwich. It got you to where you're at,'” she said. “I laugh about this. I'm not the best cook. I just don't enjoy it. That's always my number one New Year's resolution to start cooking more.”Beyond the humour, the family has had reasons to celebrate. Patrick and Brittany Mahomes recently marked the first birthday of their daughter, Golden. Randi also celebrated her own birthday and continues her community work with The Sports Parent Academy.In between rehab sessions, family milestones, and the occasional smoke alarm, the Mahomes household is finding balance. And for fans, that glimpse of normal life feels just as meaningful as any football update.Also Read: Patrick Mahomes keeps low profile as Brittany celebrates milestone amid uncertain recovery period","Randi Mahomes went viral after sharing a lighthearted kitchen mishap that set off her home’s smoke alarms.

While Kim pauses training after a torn labrum diagnosis, Garrett offered support during her recovery, taking a break from football after a physically demanding NFL season.

Myles Garrett finds balance in Switzerland with Chloe Kim after tough NFL season

Myles Garrett’s season ended without a playoff run, but his winter has unfolded with an unexpected mix of art, travel, and quiet support. Fresh off another dominant individual year, the Cleveland Browns star took a pause from football and headed to Switzerland. What began as a short break quickly turned into a moment fans were not expecting, blending street culture, elite sport, and personal life.Away from stadium noise and weekly scrutiny, Garrett offered a glimpse into how he resets. His recent posts showed a calmer side of the Pro Bowler, one shaped by reflection after a demanding season and by standing beside someone facing her own physical challenge.Myles Garrett met his girlfriend, Chloe Kim, at a Swiss train station before traveling to Laax, where Kim had been training ahead of the Milano Cortina Winter Games. Their reunion came during a difficult stretch for Kim, who recently suffered a shoulder injury that forced her to stop training. Medical scans later confirmed a torn labrum following a fall in the halfpipe earlier this month.ID@undefinedCaption not available.Garrett, meanwhile, shared moments from his surroundings, including a striking mural of Eminem spotted during his travels. The Browns star posted the image with a playful caption that read, “@eminen out in Switzerland?” The graffiti, tagged HSF 2025, appeared to be a local street art piece and quickly caught fans’ attention online.The trip followed a physically demanding NFL season for Garrett. While he led the league with 23 sacks and continued to perform at an elite level, Cleveland struggled to convert talent into wins. Injuries also lingered. Speaking in December, Garrett revealed the toll his body took late in the year, saying, “[I] tweaked my hip or something in that area, so I was feeling that for the rest of the game.”Despite the Browns’ disappointing record and coaching changes, Garrett’s individual campaign reached historic levels, including surpassing the combined sack mark of Michael Strahan and T.J. Watt in Week 18. In Switzerland, however, the situation is different. To Garrett, it is less of statistics, more of recovery, perspective and presence as Kim slowly kicks her way back to Olympic readiness.Also Read: Super Bowl LX: Sabrina Carpenter makes her first-ever Super Bowl commercial debut in playful Pringles campaign",Myles Garrett traveled to Switzerland to spend time with his girlfriend Chloe Kim.

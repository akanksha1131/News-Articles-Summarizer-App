NEW DELHI: The Indian selectors are scheduled to choose the team for next month’s Asia Cup on Tuesday. Over the past twelve months, India’s T20 team had been largely forgotten as Test cricket remained in the spotlight and the ODI format became a priority briefly because of the ICC Champions Trophy.However, the focus is now firmly on T20 cricket ahead of the T20 World Cup to be co-hosted by India and Sri Lanka in Feb and March. Ajit Agarkar ’s selection committee faces a challenging task.The process is similar to when they selected the team for the previous T20 World Cup in 2024. With the IPL expanding each year, India’s pool of players has seen huge growth. As debates continue over who should be included in India’s T20 squad travelling to the UAE in the first week of Sept, the IPL’s role in developing a strong pool of T20 players cannot be overlooked. In 2021, the BCCI made a notable statement by confidently fielding a white-ball team in Sri Lanka despite 18 cricketers being in England for a Test series. Currently, social media platforms often feature pages listing multiple playing XIs in T20s.Impact of scouts in leagues A review of the current pool of players reveals that prominent names were discovered by IPL teams. The emergence of Hardik Pandya Jasprit Bumrah and Sanju Samson dates back to over a decade.Varun Chakravarthy is perhaps the top example of intensive scouting. Tilak Varma and Abhishek Sharma’s rapid rise highlights how IPL franchises supported them despite modest domestic performances. The scouting teams of IPL franchises reach areas where the BCCI’s regular selectors may find it difficult.Tanmay Shrivastava, who was part of Virat Kohli’s U-19 World Cup-winning team in 2008, is now retired and has served as a scout for Royal Challengers Bengaluru before becoming an umpire.“Network building is a huge part of the exercise. There are franchises who rely on match referees, umpires and curators for tip-offs. As scouts, we formed groups and spread out all over the country. We tried to cover every tournament,” Shrivastava told TOI.Each state association starting its own T20 league has added further depth. Priyansh Arya, Digvesh Rathi and Aniket Verma exemplify this. Selectors adopting the change in mindset Paras Mhambrey, who served BCCI as a bowling coach for developmental teams and the senior India team before rejoining Mumbai Indians last year, acknowledged that the selection process has evolved, attributing significant influence to the IPL.“Impact” is now the most crucial factor in evaluating a player, aligning with coach Gautam Gambhir’s perspective on the format. Former India opener Devang Gandhi, a member of the selection committee that first chose T Natarajan and Varun for India’s 2020-21 tour of Australia, warned against mixing formats.“Hardik and Bumrah were picked for the 2016 T20 World Cup by the selection committee before us. When we picked Natarajan and Varun, it was done purely looking at them as T20 specialists. We refer to IPL performances. A mystery spinner takes time to be picked by the opponents. Consistency in IPL gives enough idea about their temperament. Formats should not be mixed. With batters, you want to see them perform a little longer in various domestic tournaments,” Gandhi told TOI.A member of the previous selection committee, who wished to remain anonymous, agreed that Chakravarthy was selected based on his novelty. When Pandya’s bowling and fitness declined in 2021-22, the selectors opted for Venkatesh Iyer, who was discovered in the IPL in UAE. The selector noted that IPL has made maintaining a strong pool considerably easier.“For T20s, you don’t have to look too much into domestic records over a period of time. It’s about making impact consistently,” the selector said.The intense competition in India’s T20 scene has led selectors to focus more on rejection than selection. The omission of Shubman Gill, Yashasvi Jaiswal and Rinku Singh for the T20 World Cup that India won in 2024 sparked debate. They remain subjects of discussion as the next edition of the tournament gets closer.Former India wicketkeeper Vijay Dahiya, who has worked with KKR, DC and LSG, says, “When we picked Ayush Badoni and Mayank Yadav out of the blue for LSG in 2022, we looked at their potential to be international cricketers, but immediate IPL impact was at the forefront. Form in T20 cricket is often judged on recent performances. Over time, you get to see the hunger of a player. Chakravarthy is a prime example. He was discovered when he made his T20I debut. He went back and worked on his game to make a comeback. India has a sizeable database through IPL to separate modern-day T20 players. So, it’s still about selection,” Dahiya said.The IPL has provided a vast array of talent for selectors. The outcome will depend on how they form a balanced and impressive team",The Indian selectors are scheduled to choose the team for next month’s Asia Cup on Tuesday. The focus is now firmly on T20 cricket ahead of the T20 World Cup to be co-hosted by India and Sri Lanka in Feb and March.

Poll Do you think R Ashwin's comments about Dewald Brevis' contract were inappropriate? Yes, absolutely No, it was just a discussion

Former Chennai Super Kings batter Anirudha Srikkanth has criticised R Ashwin for publicly discussing teammate Dewald Brevis’ contract on his YouTube channel, calling it an avoidable move from a current player.“This has come right after Ashwin, on his YouTube channel, spoke about his contract. Which I feel is, first of all, very, very wrong. Being a current player, being in the same team, talking about another player's contract - even though it might have been in a different context - this is the problem it can lead to,” Anirudha said on the Cheeky Cheeka YouTube channel.“You never talk about another person's contract, first of all. And because of that, CSK have strongly put out a statement. All the fans have been given that ease, stating: don’t worry at all, for the next two years this player is only for us,” he added.The row began when Ashwin suggested that CSK were willing to pay “extra” to sign Brevis in IPL 2025. The comments sparked speculation about the legality of the move, and led to the franchise releasing a clarification.Responding to the backlash, the former India spinner clarified that his remarks were never about finances.“My intent in the old video was to talk about Brevis’ batting, not about his IPL signing amount,” Ashwin explained. “We have to understand that every player who plays in the IPL has a contract with the franchise and the tournament. If there is anything wrong, it won’t be ratified. My point was about his batting, not money. ”He also underlined the importance of addressing such controversies quickly in the current media landscape. “In today’s time, there is a need to clarify the right things as well. No mistake has been made by the franchise, the player or the governing body,” Ashwin said.While Ashwin moved to set the record straight, Anirudha’s sharp criticism offers a reminder as to how sensitive matters like contract discussions are and that him speaking up about it while being a current teammate was far from ideal.","Former Chennai Super Kings batter Anirudha Srikkanth has criticised R Ashwin for publicly discussing teammate Dewald Brevis’ contract on his YouTube channel.

Poll Do you agree with Irfan Pathan's criticism of Virat Kohli's batting performance? Yes, he is right No, he is too harsh

NEW DELHI: Former India all-rounder Irfan Pathan has responded to criticism directed at him for his remarks on Virat Kohli ’s batting, particularly surrounding the star batter’s retirement from Test cricket in May after a disappointing series in Australia in 2024-25. Kohli managed just 190 runs in nine innings during the series, despite scoring a century in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy.Kohli announced his retirement from the longest format just before India’s squad selection for the England Tests, a decision that came amid a visible dip in his red-ball form. His struggles were evident in the pattern of dismissals, with the former captain frequently falling in the slips or to the wicketkeeper.""If you look at my social media, there was Virat Kohli's slump in 2019-20. At that time, it was said that it was the time of COVID, and he wasn't getting inspiration. I thought that when a player of big stature undergoes their first slump, then they should be backed. If you look at my social media, I backed him a lot. One, he deserved it, and won a lot of matches. If the slump continues for five years, then it's not right,"" Pathan told Lallantop.Pathan stressed that the team’s success must always remain the priority.""Eventually, the team has to be at the top. Team is No. 1; we play for the team, we play to win games. If a batsman gets out in a similar manner, the opposition team plans accordingly. They won't go to plan B. They will get you out using plan A. If you're a champion player, then you've to take them from plan A to plan B. The problem with Virat in Test cricket was that he was getting out similarly every now and then. That doesn't mean he's a bad player; he's a champion player, but it's happening. You've to explain what you are seeing in detail,"" he saidThe former cricketer also elaborated on his role as a commentator, underlining that his accountability lies with the fans:""See, I believe that as a broadcaster, when the commentary is going on and the fans are watching the match, you have to go ahead of the visuals and speak about what's happening. The broadcaster and commentator's work is - what is happening and why it is happening. What can happen and how? If a player is doing exceptionally well, you praise him, and if they are not performing well, then criticize him. The commentators' responsibility is towards the fans, not players.

If it ain’t broke, don’t Gill it

NEW DELHI: Before Shubman Gill took flight to England for the recently concluded Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy, there were some doubts, rather apprehensions: whether Gill would be successful as a Test batter in English conditions or if he would prove to be a good captain.Gill answered them - perfectly. He scored 754 runs in five Tests, putting on an exhibition while also proving that he is more than capable of leading the team -- his composure during The Oval Test serves as a fitting example.With the Asia Cup and T20 World Cup the next big events, both to be played in the shortest format of the sport, there have been talks about not only bringing Gill back in the T20 side but also giving him the role of vice captain, as a precursor to succeed Suryakumar Yadav at some point.It is argued, in favour of Gill, that the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has always had a tradition of all-format captains and not the split captaincy, as is the case now.Also related is the rationale of brand value and commerce. After the retirement of Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma, two superstars of Indian cricket over the last decade and a half, there is an urge to build the next-gen ""brand"" of Indian Cricket.That Gill has become a major brand and favourite for broadcasters is a fact that not many would deny.While there is no question of Gill's place in One Day Internationals (ODIs), and he could even be the heir to Rohit as the leader of the side; to bring him into the T20 side, currently, however, would appear to be a forced decision rather than a natural one.By any measure, Shubman Gill is a decent T20 player. In 21 T20Is, Gill has scored 578 runs at an average of 30.42. He has also scored them at a strike rate of 139.27.While Gill is a generational batter with a sound technique, he is not a ""hitter"". A batter is someone who tries to score runs with less risk and build their innings. While the hitter is someone who tries to score as many runs on every ball as possible, playing high-risk shots.In T20s, where the value of runs scored quickly is more valuable than preserving wickets, teams across the world have been prioritising ""hitters"" over ""batters"".The Indian team took a long time to adopt this approach, but after the 2024 T20 World Cup, they are the ones spearheading it. The role of anchors - a category appropriate for Gill - has become redundant in modern T20s.In 2021 the percentage of balls attacked by Indian batters was 28.82 per innings, it almost doubled and went up to 43.84 per innings in 2024. Moreover, the number of attacking runs per innings also increased to 138.85 in 2024 from 98.64 in 2021.Gill's scoring rate of 139.27 is by no means bad. However, the current Indian top-order scores sit at a much higher strike rate.Playing what coach Gautam Gambhir described as ""high-risk, high-reward cricket"", Abhishek Sharma scores at an unreal strike rate of 193.84, his partner-in-crime Sanju Samson strikes at 152.38. While the new number three Tilak Varma scores at 155.07, Surya thrashes opposition bowling at 167.07.After the 2024 T20 World Cup, India’s top three batters have scored at a combined strike rate of 173.1. If Gill’s seven innings at 129.2 are removed from that period, the figure rises to 181.3.Moreover, in the eight innings where he faced 15 or more balls in all T20Is, only thrice has Shubman Gill scored the runs at or over the strike rate of 160. In comparison, Abhishek Sharma has faced more than 15 balls in six innings so far and in five of them, he has struck at 200 or above.While Tilak Varma scored at over 160 strike rate in six out of 15 innings in which he faced 15 or more balls, Suryakumar Yadav hit the ball at over 160 strike rate in 24 out of 40 such innings. Only Sanju Samson falls behind a bit in this context, but even he has scored at an above 160 strike rate in three out of five occasions where he faced 15 or more balls since the start of 2024.The current Indian T20 side is well settled and is reaping results, having won 14 of the 17 matches after the 2024 World Cup. Much of that success comes from an all-out attacking approach by the top-order that matches the demands of modern T20 cricket. Gill’s style of play does not match this template.Since the 2024 World Cup, the new group of hitters and the team management have taken the attacking game to another level. In this short period, India have scored three of their fastest T20I hundreds.If the team management wants a backup opener for Abhishek and Sanju, the right option could be Yashasvi Jaiswal, who has scored at 170.00 in the six matches he has played after the 2024 World Cup.ALSO READ: Devil lies in action: What makes Jasprit Bumrah injury-prone - why his workload management is crucial Indian cricket took far too long to realise that T20 is a game of ""hitters"". It took too long to realise and implement the theory that in T20 games, a specialist T20 batter is far better than an all-format batter who plays an anchor role.That change has finally created a team that can truly represent a country with the world’s most competitive T20 league. Forcing Gill into the T20 side at this moment would be less about cricketing needs and more about fitting a ""star"" into a system that is already firing without him.","Gill scored 754 runs in five Tests, putting on an exhibition while also proving that he is more than capable of leading the team.

EXCLUSIVE | Harbhajan Singh on Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, Shubman Gill, India vs Pakistan and more

Former Indian cricket legends Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma recently announced their retirements from Test cricket within a five-day gap, breaking the traditional pattern of gradual transitions in Indian cricket. Former Indian cricketer Karsan Ghavri has claimed that internal politics within the BCCI and the selection committee led by Ajit Agarkar forced both players to retire prematurely, despite their desire to continue playing the longest format.The retirement announcements came unexpectedly, with Rohit first announcing his departure through an Instagram Story, followed by Kohli's official announcement two days later through an Instagram post.The sudden retirements raised questions among fans and cricket observers, especially given that both players had indicated plans to continue in Test cricket. Kohli had returned to play Ranji Trophy for Delhi and expressed intentions to score multiple centuries in England, while Rohit had discussed his anticipation for the Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy in conversations with Michael Clarke during the IPL break.Karsan Ghavri, who played 39 Tests and 19 ODIs for India and opened bowling with Kapil Dev in the 1970s, has provided insights into the situation through his statements on the Vickey Lalwani Show.""He [Kohli] should have definitely continued playing for India easily, probably for another couple of years. But something really forced him to retire. And unfortunately, when he retired, he was not even given a farewell by the BCCI.Such players, such a great player who has done such great service to BCCI, India cricket and Indian fans, should be given a grand and fabulous farewell.""Kohli concluded his Test career as India's fourth-highest run-getter, falling short of 10,000 runs in the format. During his 14-year career, he became India's most successful Test captain with 40 wins, including India's first series victory in Australia during the 2018-19 Border-Gavaskar Trophy.Rohit Sharma's Test career experienced a revival after he began opening in September 2019, though it never reached the heights of Kohli's achievements.""It's due to internal politics within the BCCI, which is hard to understand.

Poll What do you think was Bob Simpson's greatest achievement as a cricketer? Leading Australia to the 1987 World Cup Returning from retirement at age 41 Scoring nearly 5,000 Test runs Transforming the team as a full-time coach

Australian cricket has lost one of its great figures with the passing of former captain and coach Bob Simpson at the age of 89. Cricket Australia confirmed the news on Saturday.Simpson was a central figure in the game for decades. He played 62 Tests for Australia between 1957 and 1978, scoring 4,869 runs at an impressive average of 46.81 while also taking 71 wickets. As captain, he led his country in 39 Tests and guided them to 12 victories.In one of the most remarkable chapters of his career, Simpson returned from retirement at the age of 41 to captain a depleted Australian side during the challenging years of World Series Cricket.After hanging up his boots, Simpson went on to become Australia’s first full-time coach. He took charge of a struggling team that had gone four years without a Test series win and turned them into a dominant force.Under his leadership, Australia lifted the 1987 World Cup, won four Ashes series and finally claimed the Frank Worrell Trophy in 1995, ending a 17-year wait for success against the West Indies.Simpson stepped down after the 1996 World Cup but continued to serve Australian cricket as a national selector. His contributions were formally recognised in 2013 when he was inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame.Bob Simpson’s impact went far beyond numbers. He was a leader, a teacher and a pioneer who helped shape the modern Australian team into the powerhouse it became.","Bob Simpson has passed away at the age of 89.

CHENNAI: When opening batter Prabhsimran Singh last set foot at Chepauk, he tormented hosts Chennai Super Kings with a sparkling half-century for Punjab Kings in an IPL contest earlier this year.That knock helped him etch his name in the IPL record books as the highest run-getter among all the uncapped players. As the dust settled, the wicketkeeper-batter continued to own the record and finished eighth in the season’s run-scoring chart.In 17 matches, Prabhsimran amassed 549 runs with four half-centuries, a highest score of 91, and a healthy strike-rate of 160.53. His numbers caught the eye even as Punjab fell agonisingly short in the final. Now back at Chepauk with the Punjab domestic side to prepare for the Buchi Babu tournament, Prabhsimran stressed on the word “clarity” as he explained what shaped his standout IPL season.“The IPL went very well, but we had hoped to win the title. We will try to do better next year and go the distance. I feel most of the credit goes to Ricky Ponting (Punjab Kings head coach)...He gave me clarity.“Ahead of the season, when a youngster has that clarity, he can focus completely on enhancing his game. He gave us freedom and assurance that we would be playing all the matches. Both our captain ( Shreyas Iyer ) and coach (Ponting) gave us that clarity.And, when you know you’ll be playing all the matches, you help the team produce a better performance,” said Prabhsimran after a net session at MAC ‘B’ here on Sunday.The 25-year-old hard-hitter, whose breakthrough IPL season came in 2023, was one of only two players retained by PBKS ahead of the last season.Prabhsimran believes that taking more responsibility helped him deliver the results.“This year I tried to take up more responsibility and I got the results. And I also felt my consistency was better. In previous years, sometimes I would be playing well, but sometimes I would get out in 30s. I had worked a lot on that.”Even as Prabhsimran basks in IPL acclaim, the youngster remains grounded with his eyes fixed on the bigger prize: representing India.“When every player starts playing cricket, it’s his dream to play for India. For now, I’m just waiting. I don’t think a lot about all that, I’m just focusing on my game and if I continue to do well, God will give me an opportunity soon.”",Prabhsimran Singh was the highest run-getter among all the uncapped players in the 2014 IPL.

Poll Do you agree with Irfan Pathan's view that MS Dhoni ended his cricketing career? Yes, I completely agree No, I disagree

Former India all-rounder Irfan Pathan has blamed MS Dhoni for bringing an end to his cricketing career.Pathan played 29 Tests, 120 ODIs and 24 T20Is, claiming 301 international wickets before retiring in 2020.He burst onto the international scene in 2003 as a teenager, drawing comparisons with Wasim Akram. At his peak, he could swing the new ball prodigiously and contribute vital runs down the order, earning comparisons with Kapil Dev. His hat-trick against Pakistan in the 2006 Karachi Test remains historic. A match-winning spell in the 2007 T20 World Cup final cemented his reputation as a big-match player.But from 2009 onwards, his place in the team came into question, while his elder brother Yusuf Pathan was preferred for his hard-hitting abilities.“In 2009, Gary Kirsten told me that I was playing well but Yusuf was better, and the team would go with him. We were in New Zealand then. Earlier, my brother and I had won a match in Sri Lanka from a losing position. We needed 60 off 29 balls with seven wickets down, and we still won. If it had been someone else, I don’t think that player would have been dropped for at least a year,” Pathan said on Lallantop.“In New Zealand, I was dropped from all five matches.I asked Gary the reason I wasn’t getting chances, and what I could improve. He gave me two reasons. First, that some things were not in his hands. When I asked who was calling the shots, he said he couldn’t tell me.“The Playing XI was picked by the captain. This was Dhoni’s call—that Irfan is not needed now. That was the captain’s prerogative.“If you are in the squad, you should be looking to play. As a player, I believed I should have played, and every player should think like that. My brother was a batting all-rounder and I was a bowling all-rounder. We both could have played.”","Former India all-rounder Irfan Pathan has blamed MS Dhoni for bringing an end to his cricketing career.

For years, Babar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan have been seen as the backbone of Pakistan’s batting unit. But with both senior batters left out of the squad for the upcoming Asia Cup 2025, questions over their place in the T20 setup have resurfaced. Former Pakistan all-rounder Mohammad Hafeez has now added fuel to the debate, bluntly declaring that the duo no longer qualify as “key players” for the national side.Speaking on his YouTube channel, Hafeez argued that the “key player” tag belongs only to those consistently winning matches for Pakistan — a category he believes neither Babar nor Rizwan currently fit into. “Calling them key players would be wrong and unfair. Babar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan are not Pakistan cricket’s key players at the moment. Key players are those who win matches for Pakistan,” he said.Instead, Hafeez pointed to a new generation of performers carrying the team’s fight in recent times. “If we look at the past year and a half to two years, the players showing consistent performance are Salman Ali Agha, Saeem Ayub and Hasan Nawaz. Why aren’t we talking about them? They are the current players winning matches for Pakistan” he added.Hafeez stressed that the senior batters must re-earn their reputations. “I think Babar and Rizwan need to be concerned about their positions in the team. They need to prove themselves as good players first; key players come later. Both were good in the past, but now they are not delivering results,” he remarked.Even Pakistan’s bowling spearheads did not escape Hafeez’s assessment. “The same goes for Naseem Shah and Shaheen Shah Afridi, they are also not giving match-winning performances for Pakistan,” he said, before urging the board to adopt a long-term vision.“We should focus on players who can contribute for the next 10–15 years. Our media criticises one or two players and hypes one or two others, which is wrong. We need to talk about those who are actually performing,” Hafeez concluded.",Babar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan have been left out of the squad for the upcoming Asia Cup 2025.

Poll Who should be India's primary opener for the Asia Cup 2025? Shubman Gill Yashasvi Jaiswal Sanju Samson Other

NEW DELHI: With the Indian selectors set to announce the squad for the upcoming Asia Cup 2025 on Tuesday, August 19, former India spinner Ravichandran Ashwin has shared his insights on some of the most pressing selection dilemmas. The continental T20I event will be staged in the UAE from September 9–28, with India placed in Group A alongside Pakistan, UAE, and Oman.This edition of the Asia Cup, aligned with next year’s T20 World Cup cycle, is being closely watched as a testing ground for India’s T20I core. Among the burning questions is whether Shubman Gill , fresh off an outstanding Test series, will find a place in the squad or if Yashasvi Jaiswal will continue to be backed as India’s next-generation opener.“There are a few talking points regarding the Asia Cup. The first question that comes to everyone’s mind is whether Shubman Gill fits into the T20 plans because in the last World Cup, Yashasvi Jaiswal was the backup opener,” Ashwin said on his YouTube channel.“So Jaiswal automatically gets a kick-in. Rohit Sharma is not going to be a part of that team, so Jaiswal automatically gets a look-in. Now, who is going to be that other opener?” he added.Ashwin stressed that Gill’s recent form cannot be overlooked but highlighted that Sanju Samson ’s rise as an opener in the T20 format adds another twist to the debate. “Shubman Gill had an outstanding series. Can he return to the squad? Sanju Samson has had a fabulous run as a T20 opener for India. So I think it is a tricky state for the selectors,"" he explained.Beyond the opening slot, Ashwin also pointed to Shreyas Iyer’s resurgence as a factor that could complicate matters further. “Can Shreyas Iyer make a comeback? There is a lot of decision-making that the selectors have to make,” he remarked.","Ravichandran Ashwin shares his insights on some of the most pressing selection dilemmas.

Poll Which player from the Class of 2023 do you think will be missed the most in the 2025 squad? Rohit Sharma Virat Kohli Ravindra Jadeja

NEW DELHI: With the Indian selectors expected to unveil the squad for the Asia Cup 2025 on Tuesday, August 19, speculation is mounting over who will make the cut for the continental T20I event. India, placed in Group A alongside Pakistan, UAE, and Oman, will feature in the tournament scheduled in the UAE from September 9–28.This edition will be played in the T20I format, aligning with the T20 World Cup cycle next year. The last edition in 2023, however, was an ODI competition jointly hosted by Pakistan and Sri Lanka. That squad, led by Rohit Sharma, lifted the trophy, but much has changed in the two years since.From the Class of 2023, three stalwarts — Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, and Ravindra Jadeja — have retired from T20Is, drawing curtains on their illustrious careers in the shortest format. Their absence has created both a leadership vacuum and opportunities for the next generation.Several others who featured two years ago have drifted away from India's T20 set-up. Ishan Kishan, Prasidh Krishna, Mohammed Shami, and Shardul Thakur have not been part of the scheme in recent times, either due to form, fitness, or selection dynamics.That leaves a solid core of players still very much in contention for the Class of 2025. Suryakumar Yadav , now India's T20I captain, heads the list, with Hardik Pandya , Jasprit Bumrah, and Shubman Gill expected to play central roles. Shreyas Iyer, Axar Patel, KL Rahul, Mohammed Siraj, Washington Sundar, Tilak Varma, and Kuldeep Yadav also remain in the selectors' consideration.The key talking point, however, is how many of these 2023 squad members will survive the transition. The rise of youngsters like Yashasvi Jaiswal, Rinku Singh, and Jitesh Sharma has made competition stiffer, while experienced hands such as Pandya and Bumrah provide balance.As the BCCI gears up for the announcement, the focus will be on continuity versus fresh blood. For now, the question lingers: who from the Class of 2023 will carry forward India's challenge in the Class of 2025?","India are set to unveil their squad for the Asia Cup 2025 on Tuesday, August 19.

NEW DELHI: Former Pakistan leg-spinner Danish Kaneria has stirred fresh controversy by backing Irfan Pathan ’s explosive revelations about his long-standing rivalry with Shahid Afridi , calling out the former Pakistan captain for resorting to personal attacks.Pathan, who enjoyed considerable success against Pakistan — with 67 wickets and 807 runs in Indo-Pak clashes — dismissed Afridi 11 times across formats, including a golden duck in the 2007 T20 World Cup final. Speaking to Lallantop, the former India all-rounder recalled how the rivalry turned bitter after Afridi mocked his identity in an interview.“Afridi had said, ‘I am the real Pathan, he is a fake Pathan’. Badtameez aadmi hai. Mujhe laga ki aap sirf mere baare mein nahi bol rahe ho, mere walid ke baare mein bhi baat kar rahe,” Pathan revealed. “So whenever I had the ball in hand, I made sure I dismissed him. I have shown him 11 times who the real Pathan is — in big moments, in series deciders, and in the World Cup final.”Kaneria, Afridi’s former teammate, echoed Pathan’s claims in a scathing social media post. “Irfan @IrfanPathan bhai, you’re absolutely right.He always resorts to personal attacks — be it on someone’s family or their religion.

He asked me, ‘How are you kid?’ I said, ‘Since when have you become my father?’… Later, I told him, ‘He has eaten dog meat, he has been barking for a long time.’ After that, he couldn’t reply.”For Pathan, Afridi’s taunts only served as fuel. “On the field, my performances were the perfect answer. I showed him who the real Pathan is.”Kaneria’s intervention has reignited an already fiery debate, bringing back to spotlight one of cricket’s most infamous rivalries.","Former Pakistan leg-spinner Danish Kaneria has backed Irfan Pathan's claims about his rivalry with Shahid Afridi.

The midfielder struck a powerful free-kick from the edge of the box, beating Chelsea goalkeeper Robert Sanchez and sparking celebrations among the visitors.However, those celebrations were short-lived. VAR advised referee England to review the goal on the pitch-side monitor. Initially, it seemed the strike had been disallowed because Palace defender Marc Guehi was judged to have pushed Chelsea’s Moises Caicedo in the wall.But following the review, the official addressed the stadium with the official explanation. His announcement went: ""After review, away number six is less than one metre away from the wall as the shot is taken. Therefore, it's an indirect free kick and a disallowed goal.""The message also appeared on the big screen, confirming that Guehi’s positioning was the infringement that led to the goal being ruled out.The Premier League Match Centre later provided further clarification, emphasising that the decision was based solely on Guehi’s distance from the wall when the free-kick was struck.Despite the controversy, neither side managed to break the deadlock, and the game finished 0-0. It was only the second goalless draw of the season, following Aston Villa’s stalemate with Newcastle United.For many inside Stamford Bridge, the bigger talking point was the historic first use of a referee’s VAR announcement in the Premier League, marking a change in how decisions are communicated to players and supporters.","Chelsea drew 0-0 with Crystal Palace at Stamford Bridge on Sunday.

Poll Do you think Manchester United can bounce back this season after their opening loss? Yes, they will improve No, it will be another tough season

Arsenal kicked off their Premier League campaign with a statement win, grinding out a 1-0 victory over Manchester United at Old Trafford on Sunday. In a clash billed as the marquee fixture of the opening round, Riccardo Calafiori’s early goal proved decisive as Mikel Arteta’s men displayed resilience at the back and efficiency from set pieces — a hallmark of their rise in recent seasons.The breakthrough came in the 13th minute when Declan Rice’s corner caused chaos inside United’s box. Back-up goalkeeper Altay Bayindir, preferred over first-choice Andre Onana, failed to collect cleanly, allowing Calafiori to nod home from close range. It was yet another reminder of Arsenal’s lethal edge from dead-ball situations, with Arteta’s side making a habit of punishing defensive lapses.For United, the script felt painfully familiar. After a miserable 15th-place finish last season, optimism had returned under Ruben Amorim, bolstered by nearly £200 million spent revamping their attack. Bryan Mbeumo and Matheus Cunha were given starting debuts, while highly rated Benjamin Sesko came off the bench in the second half. Despite flashes of energy, United lacked the cutting edge to breach Arsenal’s disciplined rearguard.Arsenal themselves had a quiet evening in open play. New striker Viktor Gyökeres struggled on his competitive debut, but with their backline marshaled superbly, the Gunners followed likely title rivals Liverpool and Manchester City in securing three points on opening weekend.Elsewhere, Chelsea endured frustration in their first match as reigning Club World Cup champions, held to a goalless draw at home by Crystal Palace. Eberechi Eze, linked with a move to Tottenham, nearly gave Palace a dream lead with a stunning free kick, only for VAR to disallow it due to an infringement in the wall. The Blues, still short on sharpness after a shortened preseason, created little of note as Joao Pedro and Cole Palmer were subdued.At the City Ground, Nottingham Forest got off to a flying start with a 3-1 win over Brentford. Chris Wood picked up where he left off last season, netting twice before halftime, while new signing Dan Ndoye scored on debut. Brentford pulled one back late through Igor Thiago’s penalty, but the damage was already done.Sunday’s matches were preceded by a poignant moment of silence across stadiums in memory of Diogo Jota and Andre Silva, the brothers tragically killed in a car accident in Spain last month.",Arsenal beat Manchester United 1-0 at Old Trafford.

India's newly-appointed head coach Khalid Jamil has explained the absence of striker Sunil Chhetri from the CAFA Nations Cup national camp. The tournament serves as preparation for the upcoming Asian Cup qualifying matches in October.Jamil, who took over from Manolo Marquez this month, announced a list of 35 probables for the CAFA Nations Cup in Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. Notably, Chhetri was not included in the selection.""He (Chhetri) is not there in this camp because we are playing a tournament which will essentially serve as a preparation for our Asian Cup Qualifiers. I also want to try out a few other players during this FIFA window. I had a talk with him about the same. It's always a pleasure to have a player like him in the team, and the door is always open for him. Sunil is a legend of Indian football. I have played against him, I've seen him play on numerous occasions, and he is one of my favourite players. He is a role model for Indian football,"" Jamil said.India will compete in Group B of the CAFA Nations Cup, facing Tajikistan on August 29, Iran on September 1, and Afghanistan on September 4.The tournament's third-place match and final are scheduled for September 8 in Hisor and Tashkent respectively.The national camp began on Saturday with 22 players. The remaining 13 players, currently involved in the Durand Cup, are expected to join soon. The AIFF has requested clubs to release their national team players for the tournament.Chhetri, aged 41, had initially retired from international football after playing against Kuwait in June last year. He later returned for national duty against Maldives in March following Marquez's request to assist in the Asian Cup qualifiers.Since his return, Chhetri has participated in four matches, scoring once in India's 3-0 victory over Maldives. India's recent performances include a goalless draw with Bangladesh and a 0-1 loss to Hong Kong in Asian Cup qualifiers, complicating their path to the 2027 continental tournament.The team also suffered a 0-2 defeat against Thailand in an international friendly, leading to Marquez's departure.""This will be India's first-ever participation in the CAFA Nations Cup, and it will be a good opportunity for us to play against stronger and quality opponents like Tajikistan and Iran in CAFA Nations Cup. This will definitely be beneficial for us to prepare for AFC Asian Cup qualifiers. There is absolutely no excuse for us, as we have enough time to prepare for it. We may be treating these as preparatory games, but this is serious business for us,"" he added.""We must do the simple things first and go step by step. We are treating these matches as friendly games, but I want to take players who are fit. When I say fit, I mean, the players who will play must be 100 per cent fit.""""We started the camp with some players still not available, but we've got the players we need to begin our preparations. We had a good first training session yesterday (Saturday), but there's a lot to improve on. The important thing is that we remain united as a team. For the national interest, we would like to request co-operation from clubs to release players on time, to ensure their adequate participation during the preparatory camp. ""Jamil, who previously coached Jamshedpur FC and NorthEast United, acknowledged the need for adjustment time with the team. He emphasised that player selection would be based on performance.""The players also need time to adjust to me. My doors are always open to everybody. Whoever is doing well will be selected,"" he explainedRegarding his appointment as India's head coach, Jamil expressed his gratitude: ""It is my pleasure to serve the country. It has always been my dream to do this, and it has now come true, so that feels very good. There is a big task ahead of us, and we've got many areas that we need to work on.

Brazilian goalkeeper Fabio etched his name into football history by equalling former England great Peter Shilton’s long-standing record for the most competitive appearances in men’s football. The 44-year-old started Fluminense’s 2-1 victory over Fortaleza in Brazil’s Serie A, marking the 1,390th match of his professional career.Shilton, widely regarded as one of the greatest goalkeepers of all time, had set the benchmark more than two decades ago. While the England legend himself counts 1,387 appearances, Guinness World Records officially recognises the total as 1,390. Fabio’s latest outing has now brought him level at the summit.“I have to thank everyone who is part of my life, my father, my mother, my sisters, my friends, my wife… I try to be a good human being. The important thing is to help my team-mates. I am grateful, but without God nothing would be possible,” Fabio said after the milestone match.The veteran will stand alone as the outright record holder if he features in Fluminense’s Copa Sudamericana clash against Colombia’s America de Cali on Tuesday.Fabio’s career began in 1997 — the same year Shilton retired — before establishing himself as one of Brazilian football’s most enduring figures. He made 976 appearances for Cruzeiro between 2005 and 2022, alongside spells at Uniao Bandeirante (30 matches) and Vasco da Gama (150). Saturday’s match was his 234th for Fluminense, with whom he lifted the Copa Libertadores in 2023.","Fabio started Fluminense’s 2-1 victory over Fortaleza on Saturday.

Brighton and Hove Albion have confirmed that a supporter passed away during their Premier League opener against Fulham on Saturday.The 72-year-old man became unwell in the second half of the match while seated in the east stand upper. Despite immediate attention from emergency staff and prolonged efforts that included CPR and defibrillation, the supporter could not be revived.Privacy screens were quickly put up as medical teams worked on the scene. Paramedics from South East Coast Ambulance Service, St John Ambulance, Sussex Police, the club’s crowd doctor and stewards were all involved in the response.In a statement on the club’s official website, chief executive and deputy chairman Paul Barber said, “This was an incredibly sad end to the match this afternoon, and our deepest sympathies and condolences go out to the family and friends of the gentleman who lost his life. While the gentleman concerned is foremost in our minds, we are also aware that it was an emotional and distressing situation for staff and supporters in the direct vicinity. Over the coming days we will ensure those affected are properly supported.”Club doctor and emergency medicine consultant Dr Rob Galloway also addressed the tragedy.He said, “Firstly, I would like to convey my condolences and sympathies to the gentleman’s family and friends.It was a tragic outcome, but from an emergency response perspective, the medical care was exemplary, and the professionalism of club stewards and Sussex Police provided the medical team with the best possible working environment.”Officials explained why play was not halted during the incident. Brighton’s safety team, in consultation with Sussex Police and the Premier League, decided that stopping the match might have drawn unnecessary attention to the scene and disrupted resuscitation attempts.They also noted that any delay could have complicated matters if the supporter had responded and needed immediate transport to hospital.The match ended in a 1-1 draw, but the result was overshadowed by the events in the stands.For Brighton, the day will be remembered less for the football and more for the loss of one of their own, with tributes and condolences now flowing toward the supporter’s family and friends.","Brighton and Hove Albion confirm that a supporter has died.

He noted the forward grew more comfortable as the game went on.Earlier, Jordi Alba had given Miami the lead before Galaxy’s Joseph Paintsil equalised in the second half.

Lamine Yamal delivered the defining moment of Barcelona’s La Liga opener, producing a spectacular stoppage-time goal to wrap up a 3-0 victory over Mallorca on Saturday night.The 18-year-old, who had already created the first goal, ensured the champions began their title defence in style with a curling effort into the top corner that left the goalkeeper stranded. It was a finish worthy of sealing the match and showed just why Yamal is regarded as one of the brightest young talents in Europe.Barcelona had been in control from the start, with their dominance further enhanced by the red cards slammed on Mallorca’s players. Manu Morlanes and Vedat Muriqi were both shown red before half-time, reducing the hosts to nine men and leaving them with little hope of recovery.By then, Barca were already two goals ahead. The breakthrough came in the 7th minute when Raphinha rose highest to nod in Yamal’s precise cross. Ferran Torres extended the lead halfway through the first half, unleashing a powerful long-range shot.From that point, it was one-way traffic. Barcelona dictated the tempo and created several chances, while Mallorca simply looked to contain the damage.However, the game had its own share of controversy, with fans on social media pointing out that the ball had likely gone out of play in the buildup to the first and that a Mallorca player was down with an injury when the visitors scored the second.The final word, however, belonged to Yamal. Having started the move himself, he cut inside in injury time and let fly a curling strike that bent away from the keeper and ended up in the top corner.

What’s common between the three Formula E world champions

How the three World Champions fared in Formula E Season 11

Days after Oliver Rowland lifted his Formula E World Championship trophy in London this season, an interesting trend has come to the attention of Formula E and its fans. As a coincidence, all Formula E drivers who won the Mexico City E-Prix went on to win the Formula E World Championship that season, and this has been proved right for three consecutive years.Highlighting the same since 2023, a poster of three World Champions was shared on X by Formula E with the caption, “The trend continues. Each winner of the #MexicoCityEPrix from the past three seasons has gone on to become World Champion.”The special poster features 2023 Formula E World Champion Jake Dennis from Andretti, then TAG Heuer Porsche’s Pascal Wehrlein, who won in 2024, and the new World Champion, Nissan driver Oliver Rowland. All three of them won in the Mexico E-Prix and went on to lift the winner’s trophy in the Formula E World Championship that year.Oliver Rowland had strengthened his chances of winning the Formula E World Championship this year much earlier. He was leading the Formula E Driver Standings ever since he won Part 2 of the Jeddah E-Prix, which was his second win of the season after winning the Mexico E-Prix. In the last leg, the Nissan driver got nervous for a while as Pascal Wehrlein, who was following him in the number two position, closed the gap after grabbing quite a few podiums while Rowland had a dull period.Things became serious for Rowland when he failed to finish the Round 13 race in Berlin, while Wehrlein won second spot on the podium.

Taylor Barnard on losing top three spot in Formula E World Championship

Fans hail Taylor Barnard for his fantastic rookie season

It was Taylor Barnard’s rookie season this year, and the NEOM McLaren driver put up a fantastic performance by temporarily making it to the top three in the Formula E Driver Standings by ousting the much more experienced Porsche driver Antonio Felix Da Costa.

Barnard took to Instagram to share his feelings on losing out on the top three in his first-ever season and his claim to the championship.Taking to Instagram after the London E-Prix, Barnard wrote, “London wasn’t what we hoped for, easily being the toughest weekend of our season. Taking 0 points away as a team from a doubleheader hurts, but one weekend doesn’t define the year we’ve had.”He further wrote, “As the season closes, I want to say a massive thank you to the entire team, both trackside and behind the scenes, for everything this season. Finishing P4 in the Drivers’ Championship and coming into the final weekend with a shot at runner-up is something to be proud of.”Also adding a note for teammate Sam Bird, as NEOM McLaren withdrew from Formula E after the end of the season, Barnard wrote, “@sambird_official it wasn’t the weekend you deserved either.You’ve been a huge part of my season both on and off the track, and I’m grateful for everything. You deserved more. To all the Papaya fans, thank you for the incredible support in our final race together. You always go above and beyond. ”Reacting to his post, a fan wrote, “An incredible debut season, huge congrats and excited to see where you go next!” Another said, “I know I said it the other day, but you’ve been incredible to watch this last year and a pleasure to support you in Papaya — there are many of us that can’t wait to support you in whatever you do next!” One more commented, “You were incredible all season around, Taylor. Massive congratulations. You are the future of this sport.”Recalling Barnard’s maiden pole, a fan also wrote, “Fantastic season, Taylor, we'll never forget that Monaco pole.”Also Read: Taylor Barnard looks back at rookie season at McLaren: “Every step has been unforgettable” Barnard claimed five podiums in his first full season in Formula E.

We couldn’t have done it without you all — your trust and support have never been taken for granted,” he added.Praising the two McLaren drivers, he wrote, “Sam clinched McLaren’s first-ever fully electric win at the São Paulo E-Prix in Season 10, pulling off one of Formula E’s all-time great overtakes, before being waved across the line by none other than Emerson Fittipaldi – McLaren's first Formula 1 World Champion. While Taylor has been a rookie sensation in Season 11, securing five Formula E records, including the youngest driver to start a race, the youngest points scorer, the youngest driver to lead a lap, the youngest podium finisher, and the youngest polesitter. ”He ended the letter saying, “Some of us have been together since the day we first launched this team, while others have seamlessly fitted in along the way and flourished within the environment we have cultivated. For many, I am sure that we will cross paths again soon, but whatever the future holds for those here at Bicester, whatever path they choose to follow, I have no doubt that it will be bright.

IPL 2025 | Kagiso Rabada: 'Even a No. 10 can hit a six... there's no mystery anymore'

TimesofIndia.com

No matter the sport, the concept and idea of home advantage makes a difference to a team. There is a sense and reasonable argument behind the idea: the home team understands the conditions, understands the surface, has vehement fan support and these factors can make a difference between winning and losing.The phenomenon holds true across sports and was the factor behind Barcelona's monumental 38-game winning streak at home in the UEFA Champions League, a run that spanned seven years. It was also a central factor behind Oklahoma City Thunder topping the NBA Western Conference in 2024-25 as they stitched a 35-6 win-loss record at home - the best in the league.But when it comes to cricket, though, the concept of home advantage gets a little foggy.Sure, India had a run of 18 consecutive Test series won at home, a run that began in 2013 and was shattered by New Zealand last year. During that jaw-dropping feat, India won 42 matches, lost four and drew six. The Men in Blue also hold the record for the longest home streak in T20Is, going 17 series unbeaten from 2019 to now.Some of the factors that tip the scale towards the home side in international cricket are: familiarity with the stadiums and the conditions; knowledge of the pitch and ability to dictate things; ability to stay with friends/family instead of hotels and last, but not the least, backing of a passionate crowd.But these factors don't necessarily hold true when it comes to franchise T20 leagues such as the Indian Premier League (IPL). With local, Indian and international players making up the squads, most of these factors are nullified.Yet, there are the likes of Chennai Super Kings and Mumbai Indians who have strong home records. CSK made Chepauk their fortress with 72 wins out of 113 played, a win-loss record of 1.800. Then there are fellow five-time IPL champions MI who have won 68 of 115 home matches, a win-loss record of 1.478.This year, though, CSK have had a year to forget - in general and at home. On April 25, as they went down to Sunrisers Hyderabad, it accounted for their fifth defeat at MA Chidambaram Stadium. They've never lost more at home in a single season.After their thumping against Royal Challengers Bengaluru on March 28, coach Stephen Fleming argued they're not getting any 'home advantage'.""Well, as we've been telling you for a number of years, there was no home advantage at Chepauk. We haven't been able to read the wickets here in the last couple of years. So, it's not new. We are trying to come to grips each day with what we get, and we don't know.""The gripe with home surface isn't new and Fleming certainly wasn't the only voice that had criticism for the curators. Ajinkya Rahane, Zaheer Khan and Chandrakant Pandit all questioned the lack of support for home teams from the curators. Cricketer-turned-commentator Simon Doull went to the extent of suggesting that defending champions KKR should move away from the Eden Gardens if the curator doesn't pay heed.KKR's home record this season hasn't been great. They've played five at Eden Gardens, winning just one and losing three with one getting rained off. With two home matches remaining, and IPL playoff chances on the line, they would hope for a turn in fortunes starting Sunday against Rajasthan Royals.The rules, however, don't allow franchises to dictate the condition of the surface. As franchises only take the grounds on loan from the BCCI, they have no say on how the surface should be prepared.""A BCCI curator is not accountable to any franchise. There is no clear guidelines as such from the BCCI also,"" a source close to developments on the ground told TimesofIndia.com. ""There's been no meeting of curators since long (time).""The franchise(s) do love to put blame on the curators. Instead of blaming the curators, they should see the quality of cricket they are playing.""The franchises play at a certain venue for two months but forget that entire year there is a BCCI tournament (different age-groups) are happening. If not BCCI then state association play their leagues, conduct camps and other stuff.""The curators are following the guidelines that has been made by former BCCI chief curator Daljit Singh three decades ago...,"" added the source. Gujarat Titans COO Colonel Arvinder Singh questioned the point of the discussion around surfaces when the rules are crystal clear.""The rules of the game are very clear and they are common for everybody. No franchise has any right to say, 'I want this kind of a pitch'. That's not something that the rules allow you to do,"" he told""The home advantage has to stem from the fact that that is your home. You are supposed to know those conditions better than anybody else who's coming because that is where you play most of your games, where you practice. So from that perspective, if you're looking at a home advantage, well, why not? You deserve all the home advantage that you can take.""To say that I need home advantage because I want this kind of a pitch. Sorry, I don't think that cuts any ice with anybody,"" he added.Then there are question marks over the ethics of the sport if the surfaces are skewed towards a certain team or certain style of play.""What's the point of playing if the conditions are just going to be the same?,"" questioned South Africa and Gujarat Titans seamer Kagiso Rabada in an exclusive conversation withThis IPL season, in the 50 matches played until Mumbai Indians' win over Rajasthan Royals at the Sawai Mansingh Stadium in Jaipur on May 1, only 20 were won by the home side. Of the remaining matches, 28 have gone the visiting team's way with one, between Delhi Capitals and Rajasthan Royals being decided in a Super Over, and one match getting washed out.There's still some matches to go before the IPL 2025 playoffs kick in but this year is not a one-off in seeing home sides struggle. During IPL 2023, of the 74 matches, 29 were won by the hosts while 44 went the away side's way. And then in IPL 2022, there were 34 home wins and 40 away wins across the 74 matches.Conversely, IPL 2018 followed the opposite script. In the 60 matches that season, 38 were won by home teams and 22 by the visitors. The balance was tipped last year as well with 42 home wins and 29 away wins in 72 matches.","Chennai Super Kings have a record of 1,478-1,478 at home in IPL. Mumbai Indians hold the record for the longest home streak in T20Is, going 17 series unbeaten from 2019 to now. Home advantage is the idea that the home team understands the conditions, understands the surface and has vehement fan support.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120840858,imgsize-140894,width-400,resizemode-4/Chennai-Apr-30-ANI-Chennai-Super-Kings-Matheesha-Pathirana-and-teammates-ce-.jpg"

Astrologer Greenstone Lobo: Is Yuzvendra Chahal's India career over?

NEW DELHI: Gujarat Titans bounced back in style with a commanding 38-run win over Sunrisers Hyderabad on Friday, thanks largely to a sparkling captain’s knock from Shubman Gill The right-hander set the tone early and anchored a ferocious batting effort that saw GT post a daunting 224/6 — a total that proved well beyond SRH’s reach.Gill was in sublime touch, crafting a scintillating 76 off just 38 deliveries. From the very first over, he looked in control, flicking Mohammed Shami for a stylish six to get the scoreboard ticking.Alongside the in-form Sai Sudharsan (48 off 23), Gill punished the SRH attack with elegant strokeplay, taking the team to 87 without loss in under seven overs.He was particularly severe on Pat Cummins, hammering the Australian for a four and a six in an over that summed up GT's dominant start. He reached his fifty off just 25 balls, showcasing impeccable timing and placement, especially through the off-side.Even after Sudharsan’s dismissal, Gill maintained the momentum, finding support in Jos Buttler (64 off 37), who helped lift GT beyond the 200 mark.Gill’s innings, though cut short by a run-out on 76, laid the perfect platform. The skipper also showed his passion in the field, seen engaging in a heated conversation with the umpires over a DRS call involving Abhishek Sharma.On the bowling front, Prasidh Krishna starred with a miserly 2/19 in four overs, including the prized wicket of Travis Head, brilliantly caught in the deep by Rashid Khan.Despite a lone fight from Abhishek Sharma (74 off 41), SRH faltered under the climbing asking rate, ending at 186/6.With this win, Gujarat Titans not only solidified their playoff hopes but also sent a clear message; with Shubman Gill leading from the front, they're not done yet.",Gujarat Titans beat Sunrisers Hyderabad by 38 runs. Captain Shubman Gill top scored with 76 off just 38 deliveries. Jos Buttler (64 off 37) and Sai Sudharsan (48 off 23) also scored half-centuries.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120833266,imgsize-45972,width-400,resizemode-4/Shubman-Gill.jpg"

NEW DELHI: The qualifying mark for the men's javelin throw at the World Athletics Championships is the same as the Olympics: 85.50 metres. At the halfway stage of the Asian Games 2022 final in Hangzhou, Kishore Jena had already crossed that mark with a mighty 86.77m throwNot long after, he bettered that with a sensational 87.54m (a new personal best), placing himself in the gold medal position.But then came Neeraj Chopra , launching the javelin to a staggering 88.88m to clinch the coveted gold.For Odisha-born Jena, it was a silver. Yet, not a single trace of disappointment was visible on his face.As the crowd at the Hangzhou Olympic Sports Park Main Stadium, famously known as the ""Big Lotus"", looked on, Jena was seen jumping, hugging Neeraj in pure joy, clicking pictures, and taking selfies under a shared tricolour, moments that soon went viral across social media.Back home, Jena received as much love as the Olympic champion.His resolve now hardened, and he began training with a singular focus: to challenge Neeraj in Paris 2024.But with the Olympics two months away, just as preparations picked up steam, trouble struck.""Back in May, I was in Patiala. During a practice throw, I felt something in my left ankle,"" Jena told TimesofIndia.com.The pain was tremendous, not just physically, but mentally too, as his Olympic dream had just taken a hit.The Paris 2024 Olympics arrived; Kishore Jena pressed on but couldn’t qualify for the final round.“I thought if I go for surgery before the Olympics, I’ll lose too much time. But later, I was told surgery was the only permanent fix. Without it, proper recovery wasn’t possible,” said the 29-year-old.On October 4, Jena underwent surgery.“Now everything's fine. The doctors said the ankle just needs time to adapt. There’s a 7–8 month gap in training, so it’s readjusting,” he smiled.Last month, Jena made his competitive return at the Indian Open in Chennai.Though his best effort of 75.99m wasn’t much to write home about, for someone who had struggled to walk just a few months ago, it was a personal victory.At the Federation Cup in Kochi later in April, Jena threw 77.82m, missing the podium by just 0.02m. Sachin Yadav took gold with 83.86m, followed by Yashvir Singh (80.85m) and Sahil Silwal (77.84m).Meanwhile, the athletics world was abuzz with the announcement of the Neeraj Chopra Classic ( NC Classic ), a prestigious 'A' category Continental Tour Gold event by World Athletics.Indian stars like Sachin, Rohit Yadav, and Sahil were named in the lineup released on Tuesday, but Kishore Jena’s name was notably missing.""I had been trying to get an entry into it for a while, but the throws just weren’t landing well, so it felt like maybe it wouldn't happen this time. I was like, if it doesn't happen this year, that's okay. I thought I would try again next year,"" Jena added.Then came the call. Under the evening Mumbai sky on Wednesday, Jena’s phone rang. On the other end was double Olympic medallist Neeraj Chopra.""Around 8:20 or 8:25, I got a call from Neeraj bhai. He said he had spoken to the management and that I should be playing. That’s how the conversation started,"" he said.This wasn’t their first conversation about it. Even earlier, messages from Neeraj had encouraged him to participate. But with the Diamond League’s Doha leg looming and a notable dip in performance, Jena wasn’t sure he could manage both.Perhaps the Wednesday night call was the push he needed. On Thursday, Jena was officially added to the NC Classic lineup as its latest entrant.""We had been keen to include Jena, but were waiting for the confirmation since he’s just returned from injury and is also preparing for the Diamond League,"" a source close to the developments told TimesofIndia.com.Before stepping into the high-profile NC Classic on May 24 at Bengaluru’s Kanteerava Stadium, Jena, however, has a bigger target: to breach the all-important 85.50m barrier at the upcoming Doha Diamond League on May 16.""The goal is definitely to qualify for the World Championships through that,"" concluded Jena, who will leave for Qatar on May 14.ALSO WATCH:","Kishore Kumar Jena wins silver in the men's javelin throw at the Asian Games 2022.

Poll Who was the standout performer for Gujarat Titans in their recent match against Sunrisers Hyderabad? Sai Sudharsan Prasidh Krishna Jos Buttler Shubman Gill

NEW DELHI: Gujarat Titans stormed back to form with a commanding 38-run win over Sunrisers Hyderabad in the IPL 2025 on Friday. The win was powered by explosive half-centuries from Shubman Gill and Jos Buttler , with Prasidh Krishna’s clinical spell capping off a complete performance. The loss all but ended SRH’s playoff hopes, while GT gave their campaign a timely boost.Batting first, the Titans posted a formidable 224/6, riding on a fiery 87-run opening stand between Gill and Sai Sudharsan. Gill smashed a 38-ball 76, while Sudharsan’s 48 came off just 23 deliveries. Jos Buttler then took over, hammering 64 from 37 balls to power GT past 200.SRH began their chase positively but failed to maintain momentum, finishing on 186/6. Abhishek Sharma was the lone warrior with a 41-ball 74. Despite his efforts, the asking rate climbed beyond reach, especially after the dismissal of Travis Head via a sensational catch by Rashid Khan, who covered significant ground from deep square leg and changed direction mid-run to grab the ball.Prasidh Krishna was once again outstanding with the ball, returning figures of 2/19 in his four overs. The only concern for GT was Ishant Sharma limping off the field before completing his spell.SRH’s bowlers had no answers early on, as Mohammed Siraj leaked 22 runs in his first two overs and Ishant gave away 20 in his first spell. Shubman Gill launched the GT innings with a six off Mohammed Shami and continued to dominate, especially against Pat Cummins, taking 17 off one over that included a powerful six over deep mid-wicket.Sudharsan toyed with Shami, hitting him for four consecutive boundaries. The pair put on 82 in the powerplay. Leg-spinner Zeeshan Ali finally broke the partnership by having Sudharsan caught behind off a googly.Gill carried on fluently, reaching his half-century in 25 balls with a stylish drive through extra cover. Buttler, in excellent touch, also crossed the 4000-run milestone in IPL with a towering six off Ansari.Gill survived a drop on 66 by Cummins off Harshal Patel but was soon run out, thanks to Harshal’s sharp throw from short fine-leg and a clever deflection onto the stumps by Klaasen.In a tense moment, Gill was seen arguing animatedly with the umpires over a review involving Abhishek Sharma, who tried to pacify the GT skipper.Ultimately, Gujarat’s clinical batting and disciplined bowling proved too much for SRH, who are now staring at elimination.",Gujarat Titans beat Sunrisers Hyderabad by 38 runs in IPL 2025.

A Day That Marked a Shift



Black Tuesday for Sporting Legends: Ronaldo, Messi, Dhoni, and LeBron All Crumble on April 30April 30, 2025, will go down as one of the most sobering days in modern sports memory. Four of the world’s most iconic athletes—Cristiano Ronaldo, Lionel Messi , M.S. Dhoni , and LeBron James—each saw their teams knocked out of major competitions in stunning fashion, triggering reactions ranging from heartbreak to harsh public scrutiny.Cristiano Ronaldo's pursuit of silverware with Al-Nassr came to another bitter end after a 3-2 loss to Japan’s Kawasaki Frontale in the AFC Champions League semi-final. Despite boasting 75% possession and fielding stars like ex-Liverpool forward Sadio Mané and former Arsenal midfielder Marcelo Brozović, the Saudi side failed to convert dominance into victory. Ronaldo missed a clear chance in stoppage time and looked visibly distraught post-match, talking to himself and making odd gestures, behavior that raised further concerns among fans. With no major titles this season, frustrations continue to mount for both the star and Al-Nassr supporters.In Chennai, M.S. Dhoni’s return to the captaincy couldn’t save the Chennai Super Kings . A four-wicket defeat to Punjab Kings at Chepauk marked CSK’s fifth home loss of the season and confirmed their elimination from IPL 2025 with just two wins in ten matches, the worst record in the league.The once-mighty fortress of Chepauk now mirrors the decline of a team that has fallen steadily since 2020. Dhoni, 43, stepped back into leadership after Ruturaj Gaikwad was ruled out with injury but couldn’t arrest the freefall. The five-time champions were the first team knocked out of the playoffs race, a fall from grace that punctuates the end of an era.Across the Atlantic, Lionel Messi's Inter Miami were thoroughly outplayed by Vancouver Whitecaps in the CONCACAF Champions Cup semifinal. A 3-1 loss on the night completed a 5-1 aggregate defeat. Despite Messi’s early involvement—threading a pass that led to Jordi Alba’s ninth-minute goal—Miami’s backline was torn apart.Vancouver’s relentless attack exposed Miami’s aging midfield and slow defence. Messi had a few half-chances but remained largely peripheral. After the match, Javier Mascherano admitted: “Although it was the first time the club had advanced to the semifinals, the defeat hurts us a lot... we have to accept that our opponents outplayed us.”The loss not only ended Messi’s continental hopes but further spotlighted the limitations of Miami’s star-powered, yet increasingly sluggish, squad.In Los Angeles, LeBron James and the Lakers were eliminated from the NBA playoffs following a 103-96 loss to the Minnesota Timberwolves. Despite a 50-win season and homecourt advantage, the Lakers were outscored in every fourth quarter of the series.But amidst the disappointment, LeBron found solace in the personal. Sharing the court with his son Bronny James ranked as the pinnacle of his career: “Number one for sure. That’s easy. That’s not even close.”Bronny, who split his rookie season between the Lakers and their G League affiliate, showed promise and poise. “Just pushing through and growing at the same time is something to be proud of,” he said.Lakers head coach JJ Redick was praised by LeBron for his composure in his debut season, despite the early exit. Luka Doncic, recently traded to LA, echoed the sentiment but admitted: “It’s tough to get that chemistry on the court without any practices.”April 30 wasn’t just a bad day for four sports icons. It was a symbolic reckoning, an inflection point where age, form, and transition collided. The weight of legacies clashed with the brutal demands of present-day competition, leaving fans and critics alike to wonder if the torch has truly begun to pass.","Cristiano Ronaldo, Lionel Messi, M.S.

The Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) convened on April 23 to receive detailed information about the Pahalgam terrorist attack.""I am with the country; whatever our country does, it will be good,"" Kapil stated to reporters on Friday.In conversation with ANI, Gopichand expressed support for the government's response, stating, ""It is an unfortunate incident and I am happy that the government is sternly dealing with it.

The England and Wales Cricket Board announced an immediate ban on transgender players from competing in women's and girls' cricket matches on Friday, following a recent Supreme Court ruling that excludes them from the legal definition of women. This decision came just a day after the Football Association implemented similar restrictions.The ECB 's decision was prompted by an updated legal position following the Supreme Court's ruling on April 15, which stemmed from a petition by campaign group ""For Women Scotland"" arguing that sex-based protections should only apply to people born female.""With immediate effect, only those whose biological sex is female will be eligible to play in women's cricket and girls' cricket matches.

Former cricket legend Kapil Dev has urged caution regarding 14-year-old Vaibhav Suryavanshi , who recently made headlines in the Indian Premier League with a record-breaking century before experiencing a rapid decline in form against Mumbai Indians at the Sawai Mansingh Stadium.Suryavanshi's remarkable performance came during Rajasthan Royals ' chase of Gujarat Titans' 210-run target. He achieved his maiden IPL century in just 35 balls, making it the fastest century by an Indian in IPL history and the second-quickest overall after Chris Gayle's 30-ball hundred in 2013.At 14 years and 32 days, Suryavanshi became the youngest player to score a century in T20 cricket. His innings surpassed Yusuf Pathan's previous Indian record of a 37-ball hundred against Mumbai Indians in 2010.The young prodigy from Bihar hit 11 sixes during his innings, equaling the record for most sixes by an Indian in an IPL innings, sharing the milestone with Murali Vijay who achieved the same against Rajasthan Royals in 2010.""Give him time, don't rush it. He is a good talent and has good ability. But you need to give time to players,"" Kapil Dev told reporters in Lucknow.Quiz: Who's that IPL player? However, Suryavanshi's success was short-lived as he faced a significant setback in the following match against Mumbai Indians, managing only a two-ball duck. His dismissal came when he miscued a pitched-up delivery from Deepak Chahar to Will Jacks at mid-on.The teenager's dismissal triggered a collapse for Rajasthan, who were eventually bowled out for 117, ending their chances of reaching the playoffs. His performance was particularly notable as he single-handedly took on Gujarat's bowling attack, which collectively possessed 694 international caps.The contrast between Suryavanshi's record-breaking century and subsequent duck highlights the unpredictable nature of cricket, especially for young players establishing themselves in the sport's premier tournaments.","Vaibhav Suryavanshi scored a record-breaking century in the Indian Premier League.

Manchester City secured a crucial 1-0 victory against Wolves at the Etihad Stadium on Friday, with Kevin De Bruyne scoring the winning goal to boost their Champions League qualification hopes, moving them to third place in the Premier League standings.City have now won five consecutive matches in all competitions for only the second time this season, providing a significant lift to their European ambitions.The win gives City a four-point cushion over sixth-placed Nottingham Forest, who have a game in hand against Crystal Palace on Monday, while fourth-placed Newcastle and fifth-placed Chelsea also have matches in hand.The match marked one of De Bruyne's final appearances at the Etihad, as the 33-year-old Belgian midfielder will not receive a contract extension when his current deal expires at the end of the season.""We are better than we were weeks ago. If we play like we did today, it is really good but we cannot relax. Winning in that way is good because it will make us realise that we still need to work,"" Guardiola said.De Bruyne's goal was only his sixth of the season, reflecting his injury-plagued decline over the past two years that influenced Guardiola's decision to release him.""A lot of teammates have said that it's sad I have to go, but that's just how it goes sometimes in life. I don't know what the future will be, but I know that I can still play here. I try to play as much good football as I can. I'm still enjoying it,"" De Bruyne said.""Just thank you. His contribution in the game against Crystal Palace when we were 2-0 down and he delivers, and today the goal again. I want the best for Kevin.

Ilkay Gundogan passed to Jeremy Doku , who beat his marker and found De Bruyne unmarked in the Wolves area.

In a major step to deepen its engagement with Indian fans and support the growth of football across the country, the English Premier League announced the opening of its new office in Mumbai on Wednesday. This marks the latest expansion of the League’s global footprint and its enduring association with India’s burgeoning football community.The Mumbai office aims to bolster the Premier League's efforts to grow the sport at both grassroots and elite levels, while also enhancing connections with fans and stakeholders in the region. The office will serve as a hub for collaboration with local authorities, the Indian Super League (ISL), and governing bodies, helping to further integrate the Premier League’s programs and initiatives within India’s footballing ecosystem.Premier League Chief Executive Richard Masters underscored the importance of this move. “We and our clubs have a fantastic and knowledgeable fanbase in India, and we know football continues to grow in popularity. We are proud of our longstanding commitment to India, having worked to deliver community football programmes for 18 years and, more recently, our partnership with the Indian Super League,” he said. “Opening this office marks a significant milestone for the Premier League. It will allow us to operate more effectively locally as we build on our existing work to establish more ways to strengthen our relationship with fans, JioStar and other partners.”The Premier League’s connection with India began in 2007 through the Premier Skills initiative, in partnership with the British Council. Over the past 18 years, the program has trained more than 7,300 coaches and referees across 18 Indian states, positively impacting over 124,000 young people. At the elite level, the League’s alliance with the ISL since 2014 has resulted in meaningful collaboration in areas such as youth development, coaching standards, and referee training.Additionally, the Next Gen Cup — an elite youth tournament co-hosted with the ISL and Reliance Foundation — continues to foster top-level talent. The sixth edition of the event is set to take place in Mumbai in May 2025, featuring U19 teams from both Premier League clubs and ISL academies.This marks the fourth international office for the Premier League, after successful launches in Singapore (2019), New York (2023), and Beijing (2024), as the League continues to globalise its fan engagement and development initiatives.","The EPL has opened a new office in Mumbai.

Poll Which team do you think has the best chance of reaching the Kalinga Super Cup finals? Mumbai City FC Jamshedpur FC Mohun Bagan Super Giants FC Goa

: Two games won, two more to go.That’s the scenario for Kalinga Super Cup semifinalists, barring Mohun Bagan Super Giants who needed just one win to join the last four, as they look to book a place in the summit clash with another win here on Wednesday.“All four teams have the same target. And we are all in that moment of the competition where every game is very difficult,” India and FC Goa head coach Manolo Marquez said at the pre-match press conference at Kalinga Stadium on Tuesday.Marquez’s Goa will be vying it out with ISL Shield and Cup winners Mohun Bagan in an afternoon fixture and Jamshedpur FC are set to lock horns with Mumbai City FC in the game scheduled for the evening.While the absence of the star foreigners in the ISL champions’ squad makes FC Goa – who dominated Gokulam Kerala in a 3-0 win before edging a valiant Punjab FC 2-1 in the quarterfinal – the favourites in their last-four clash, their Spanish head coach is not ready to pay heed to the statistics.“Mohun Bagan are here with half of the main team squad and the other half were champions of the Reliance Foundation Development League two weeks ago. The game will be very difficult because they have nothing to lose. That is the reality. They have already won two trophies and the slot for the Asian competition,” he added.Led by assistant coach Bastab Roy in absence of Jose Molina, Bagan were devastating in their quarterfinal against Kerala Blasters, with Kerala boys Ashique Kuruniyan and Sahal Abdul Samad combining well while 21-year-old playmaker Salahudheen Adnan K stole the show with his Player of the Match performance.Roy, meanwhile, took the game in the team’s stride and admitted that they have a tough job against Marquez’s Goa.“FC Goa are, without a doubt, a better and a stronger team than Kerala Blasters. So my job is not easy. But my players are focussed and ready. It’s an exposure trip for the young boys and some seniors as well. It's a semifinal and I’ve told my boys to enjoy the game,” was Roy’s comments on Tuesday.Goa, however, have a silver lining even in a semis defeat as AIFF earlier announced they would get the 2025-26 AFC Champions League 2 spot if Bagan go on to clinch the trophy on Saturday.That’s not the case for the other semifinalists with Mumbai City and Jamshedpur both eager to make up for their ISL playoffs disappointments and leave the memories of exiting the Super Cup last time in the last-four stage behind and end this season on a high.“We never think like this (about the previous tournaments). If this is a new challenge, you must think positively and try to get good positive results. We’re playing in the semifinal. It’s an important game. We are playing against a good team and must work hard to get a positive result,” Khalid Jamil said at the pre-match interaction.Jamshedpur, who will hope to be third-time lucky after being ousted twice in the last-four stage, will have the psychological edge having beaten Mumbai City in both legs of the ISL.However, the Red Miners’ defence — led by the in-form Stephen Eze — will have to deal with the Lallianzuala Chhangte threat with the opposition skipper being the standout performer so far with three goals and an assist, including the winner against Inter Kashi in the last eight.But only Wednesday will tell who gets the chance to vie for the trophy on Saturday.",Mohun Bagan Super Giant and FC Goa will go head-to-head in the semifinal of the Kalinga Super Cup on Wednesday.

Poll Do you think Liverpool can maintain their dominance in the league next season? It's too early to tell No, other teams will catch up Yes, they will continue to dominate

Liverpool secured their 20th English top-flight title with a stunning 5-1 victory over Tottenham Hotspur at an electrified Anfield on Sunday, sealing a record-equalling crown in emphatic style. The Reds, under manager Arne Slot, left no doubt as they turned an early deficit into a comprehensive win that saw them extend their lead to 15 points over second-placed Arsenal, making their title mathematically unassailable with just four games remaining.The match began with an air of anticipation, as Liverpool fans serenaded their team with the iconic ""You'll Never Walk Alone,"" and their team responded with attacking intent. However, Tottenham briefly threatened to spoil the party when Dominic Solanke powered home a header from a James Maddison corner in the 12th minute. The goal, which initially appeared to be offside, was awarded after VAR's intervention.The setback only seemed to galvanize Liverpool, who quickly leveled through Luis Diaz. The Colombian forward slotted home from close range following a fine cross from Dominik Szoboszlai. The home side then took the lead just minutes later, as Alexis Mac Allister rifled a thunderous shot past Spurs goalkeeper Guglielmo Vicario in the 24th minute.Liverpool were rampant, and after Tottenham's inability to clear their lines, Cody Gakpo seized the opportunity to make it 3-1, firing a low shot into the corner. Spurs, fielding a weakened side due to manager Ange Postecoglou's focus on the Europa League semi-finals, were now on the back foot.As the second half progressed, the Liverpool faithful were craving a goal from their star man, Mohamed Salah. Their wish was granted when Salah collected a pass from Szoboszlai, cut inside, and blasted the ball into the bottom corner, celebrating by taking a selfie with a fan in front of the Kop. The crowd erupted in joyous chants, and the atmosphere at Anfield reached fever pitch.The final goal came when Tottenham defender Destiny Udogie inadvertently turned the ball into his own net, sealing a 5-1 rout and sending the Liverpool fans into a frenzy. As the final whistle blew, Anfield reverberated with deafening cheers, and the celebrations began in full force.Liverpool's triumph marked their 20th league title, bringing them level with Manchester United at the top of the all-time list. It also represented a significant achievement for manager Arne Slot, who has steered the club to glory in his first season after replacing Jurgen Klopp last year.","Liverpool secured their 20th English top-flight title with a stunning 5-1 victory over Tottenham Hotspur at an electrified Anfield on Sunday.

In a controversial move, the All India Football Federation (AIFF) awarded the I-League trophy to Churchill Brothers on Sunday, just hours after the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) had stayed the decision and barred any formal felicitation. The defiant act could invite further scrutiny from global bodies like FIFA and CAS.Deputy secretary general M Satyanarayan handed the trophy to Churchill Brothers at a ceremony in Goa, claiming the AIFF only learned about the CAS order after the presentation. ""I was on a flight to Goa and the AIFF Secretariat was closed on Sunday. I came to know about the order only after giving away the trophy,"" Satyanarayan told PTI.The CAS stay came on an urgent application filed by Inter Kashi, who argued that a pending points dispute could alter the final standings. Inter Kashi president Prithiijit Das asserted, ""The CAS order came around 1:30 pm IST and the mail was marked to AIFF also,"" questioning the federation's explanation.CAS deputy president Elizabeth Steiner had clearly ruled that the AIFF must not declare a winner or hold any ceremony until the arbitration concludes. The respondents, including AIFF and Churchill Brothers, have until April 29 to respond.Defending its move, AIFF later issued a statement, emphasising that the presentation was based on previous Delhi High Court and Appeals Committee rulings and that the federation would comply with CAS' final verdict.Churchill Brothers had provisionally finished atop the I-League standings, but Inter Kashi's challenge over a disputed match result could yet overturn the title race.

Earlier Monaco E-Prix Winners

The stage is set for the Monaco E-Prix, and among the favourites are Mitch Evans , Oliver Rowland, António Félix Da Costa , and Nick Cassidy. With Monaco hosting a double-header for the first time, there are even more opportunities for new names—or different combinations—to climb the podium this weekend. But before that, let’s take a look at the six winners of the Monaco E-Prix so far.Interestingly, since the Monaco E-Prix adopted the full 3.337 km layout at the Circuit de Monaco, no pole-sitter has gone on to win the race.2022: Jaguar’s Mitch Evans started from pole but finished second. Stoffel Vandoorne of Mercedes claimed the win.2023: McLaren’s Jake Hughes took pole but didn’t make the podium. Nick Cassidy of Envision Racing won, followed by Evans in second and Andretti’s Jake Dennis in third.2024: Pascal Wehrlein secured pole for Porsche but also failed to finish on the podium. Jaguar dominated the race, with Evans taking the win and teammate Cassidy finishing second. Stoffel Vandoorne, now with DS Penske, completed the podium in third.The 2021 race was an exception to the recent trend. It was the first time Formula E used the full Monaco layout, and the pole-sitter went on to win the race. That year, António Félix da Costa achieved the double for Techeetah-DS. His recent third-place finish at the Miami E-Prix shows he’s still in strong form with Tag Heuer Porsche. Robin Frijns (Virgin-Audi) finished second in 2021, while Mitch Evans took third that year.Meanwhile, Sébastien Buemi of e.dams Renault remains the only driver to have won the Monaco E-Prix twice—and in consecutive editions. He triumphed in 2015 and 2017, during a period when the race was held biennially. On both occasions, Lucas Di Grassi (ABT Sportsline) finished second. Di Grassi is currently showing strong form again, having secured second place for Lola Yamaha ABT in the recent Miami race. In 2019, it was Jean-Éric Vergne of Techeetah-DS who claimed victory.The official Formula E Instagram handle recently shared a poster featuring the six different winners of the Monaco E-Prix, accompanied by the caption: “Will anybody join the exclusive list of #MonacoEPrix winners?”Also Read: Monaco E-Prix 2025: Formula E set for yet another double-header, here’s all about the most loved race of the year Predicting this weekend’s results, one fan wrote: “Oliver Rowland first, Jake Dennis second, and Pascal Wehrlein in third.” Rowland received plenty of support in the comments, with even the Formula E page noting: “A lot of love for @oliverrowland1 here.”","Mitch Evans, Oliver Rowland, António Félix Da Costa and Nick Cassidy are among the favourites to win this weekend's Monaco E-Prix.

Mahindra Racing is driving at an altogether different speed this season as the Formula E team has already surpassed their Season 10 points total in just five races. There are 11 more rounds to go, with the next in Monaco in May. And with such a wonderful performance this year, the Indian outfit is surely on the way to making history. Mahindra Racing drivers Edoardo Mortara and Nyck De Vries can rightfully take the credit for making the team reach a prominent place in the competition.Mahindra Racing’s achievement was highlighted by Formula E, which shared a post on Instagram to laud the team. The picture of team drivers Edoardo Mortara and Nyck De Vries was captioned: “What a turnaround from @MahindraRacing surpassing their Season 10 points total in the first 5 rounds,” along with clapping emojis.The team was struggling at just 47 points last season, but it has already made 51 points in 5 rounds out of 16 races. As a result, it’s in fifth position in the Teams' Standings this year.

They are yet to win a pole position or a podium this season so far, but it's great going and good results are sure to follow.The current season has seen a lot of ups and downs already. It started on a strong note for the team as Mortara and De Vries managed to take 5th and 6th positions in the season opener Sao Paulo E-Prix, respectively. De Vries slipped to 8th position in the second race in Mexico, whereas Mortara failed to leave an impression. The two bounced back strongly at Jeddah E-Prix Round 1, where De Vries climbed to an impressive 4th position and Mortara finished 7th. But they once again slipped to 10th and 13th positions in Round 2.At the Miami E-Prix this month, Mortara once again bounced back by clenching 5th position, but De Vries finished 11th in the race. Team principal Frederic Bertrand is always seen encouraging the drivers and had written after the impressive Miami E-Prix, “We keep pushing, fighting, improving! Great job @mahindraracing this week-end in Miami! Both cars in top 10 on the grid - 100% duel in S11! - points again with P5/P11 at the end of the race - we scored points in 100% of races in S11, - we get to P5 in teams championship.”Also Read: Formula E 2024-2025 driver standings so far: Oliver Rowland maintains lead, Antonio Felix Da Costa on second “But more importantly, the team is now in full delivery mode, and the spirit is one of those which can make you face any challenge with confidence and calm.

He wrote: “Difficult weekend in Imola with P10 in race. Still early process with our new team, we keep learning. As always after a difficult one, we gonna analyse and make progress to come back stronger for the next one in Spa @cadillacvseries @jota_sport.”Encouraging him, Cadillac’s official Instagram page commented: “Building and growing,” along with clapping emojis.

Miami E-Prix

Formula E drivers Norman Nato and Nyck De Vries are currently in Italy for the second round of the 2025 FIA World Endurance Championship (WEC).

Nato finished 9th, while De Vries secured 5th place in the session.Norman Nato, who races for Nissan in the Formula E Championship, represents Cadillac Racing in collaboration with Hertz Team Jota in the Hypercar category of the Endurance Championship. Nyck De Vries, from Mahindra Racing’s Formula E team, finished 5th in the Imola qualifying. He competes for Toyota Gazoo Racing in the WEC, alongside teammate Ryo Hirakawa, who placed 4th in qualifying.Calling it his best effort on track, De Vries told Toyota Europe Newsroom: “As a team, I think we can be fairly satisfied with qualifying fourth and fifth here. We maximised our package, as you can see from the tiny gap between the two cars. I don’t think we could have done much better than that; we did a strong job to execute a clean qualifying. The gap to the front cars looks quite big over one lap, but we will do our best with race pace, tyre management, and strategy to challenge for the podium.”Both drivers are now set to compete in the final race of the 6 Hours of Imola on Sunday, scheduled from 1 PM to 7 PM local time.In their last Formula E outing at the Homestead-Miami Speedway, Nato faced heartbreak after losing what looked like a sure win due to post-race penalties. Although he clinched pole and crossed the line first at the Miami E-Prix, he was relegated to 6th place in the revised results.De Vries had qualified 5th in Miami but ultimately dropped to 11th in the final standings after penalties were applied.Following this, they’ll shift focus to Round 6 of the Formula E World Championship—the highly anticipated Monaco double-header on May 3 and 4.

(AP Photo/Manu Fernandez)

World No. 1 Iga Swiatek endured one of the toughest defeats of her career on Thursday, crashing out of the Madrid Open semifinals in a 6–1, 6–1 loss to Coco Gauff . The match, marked by an uncharacteristically emotional Swiatek and her most lopsided defeat on clay, prompted an outpouring of reaction, including a compassionate message from ATP star Casper Ruud .Swiatek’s performance was well below her high standards. Trailing 6–1, 3–0, she was caught on camera at a changeover covering her face with a towel, appearing to fight back tears. It was a stark image of vulnerability from the typically composed three-time Roland Garros champion, who has yet to win a title in 2025 and now faces growing questions about her form heading into her favorite Grand Slam .Her struggles were clear from the first game. Gauff dominated with focus and aggression, breaking Swiatek early and racing through the first set. In the second, things unraveled further for the Pole, both mentally and on court. A frustrated Swiatek was seen shouting toward her player box, prompting the chair umpire to issue a code violation after overhearing the exchange.This marks the third consecutive loss for Swiatek to Gauff, all in straight sets, and her first time losing a set to the American on clay. Gauff, who had been 1–11 in their previous head-to-head meetings, capitalized on Swiatek’s off-day to deliver a clinical performance.“I’m proud of the mentality I had through the whole match,” Gauff said in her on-court interview. “I think I was aggressive and played with margin. Maybe it wasn’t her best level today, but I think I kind of forced her into some awkward positions. I’m really happy with how I played today.”Swiatek finished the match with just 7 winners and 21 unforced errors. Her last match against Madison Keys also raised eyebrows after she suffered a rare 6–0 ""bagel"" set.As the footage of Swiatek’s emotional moment spread across social media, Casper Ruud, who had just secured his own spot in the Madrid semifinals with a win over Daniil Medvedev posted a heartfelt note to Swiatek on X:“Hey @iga_swiatek keep your head up 🙏🙏 Like millions of other people I love watching you play. Not your day today, but you inspire so many and you’ll be back stronger than ever!! 😊🤩👏🎾”Ruud, like Swiatek, has enjoyed deep runs at Roland Garros and has built a reputation for his sportsmanship as much as his consistency on clay. He heads into his next match against Francisco Cerundolo with full momentum, having not dropped a set in Madrid.“Eight sets played and eight sets won, so I can't ask for anything better, honestly,” Ruud said after his win. “I've been beating some good players, and, yeah, really happy with the game today.”For Swiatek, all eyes now turn to Paris. As the defending champion and dominant force on clay in recent years, she’ll be looking to regroup quickly. But Thursday’s loss served as a stark reminder that in today’s game, even the most consistent stars are vulnerable.","World No. 1 Iga Swiatek lost 6–1, 6-1 to Coco Gauff in the Madrid Open quarterfinals.

Three straight wins against Swiatek

Reigning champion Iga Swiatek suffered a crushing 6-1, 6-1 semi-final defeat by Coco Gauff on Thursday, with the American to face world number one Aryna Sabalenka for the Madrid Open title.The second-ranked Swiatek, a five-time Grand Slam winner, dropped serve five times against Gauff as the Pole fell in 64 minutes.Swiatek, usually excellent on clay, has struggled during her Madrid title defence.She dropped sets against Alexandra Eala and Diana Shnaider, and then was dealt a bagel by Madison Keys in just 24 minutes on Wednesday.However, the 23-year-old bounced back strongly to defeat the American, but came undone against Keys' compatriot Gauff, who beat Swiatek for the first time on the red dirt.With this latest loss, Swiatek has only the upcoming Italian Open to help her get back to winning ways before she defends her French Open title later in May -- her 2024 triumph at Roland Garros was the last trophy the former world number one lifted.""I couldn't really get my level up. Coco played good, but, yeah, I think it's on me that I didn't really move well,"" said Swiatek.""With that kind of game, it was pretty bad.""I think I pushed kind of with my head for more than I even should, tennis-wise,"" she added. ""Today for sure everything kind of collapsed.""Gauff, 21, broke in the third, fifth and seventh games to blow Swiatek away in the first set, converting her second set point.The world number four secured two more breaks in the second set and wrapped up victory at the first time of asking.""Obviously she wasn't maybe playing her best tennis , but I think I made her uncomfortable,"" said Gauff. ""She is very talented and can make you run and move you around the court. And I just tried to not do that today.""Gauff beat Swiatek at the 2025 United Cup and in the WTA Finals last year, both on hardcourt, but the American had never previously defeated the four-time French Open winner on clay.""I think the previous times we played on clay I don't think I had a win against her yet..."" said Gauff.""Obviously on clay she's a different player, but clay is one of my better surfaces too, and I thought if I can beat her on hard I can beat her on clay.""Last year's runner-up Sabalenka sealed a return to the final after battling past Ukraine's in-form Elina Svitolina 6-3, 7-5.Sabalenka won four of the first five games and a second break of serve was enough to pocket the opening set.The Belarusian led 4-2 in the second set but was broken when serving for the match a few games later. Sabalenka responded right away with another break before sewing up victory at the second attempt.Sabalenka is the first WTA player to reach 30 match wins this season and is through to her fourth final in five years in Madrid, having won the tournament in 2021 and 2023 before losing to Swiatek last year.In the men's draw, Casper Ruud reached the semi-finals with a 6-3, 7-5 triumph over Daniil Medvedev .The Norwegian ousted Taylor Fritz to reach the quarter-finals and secured his first win against the Russian in their fourth meeting.Strong on clay, Ruud only converted two of his eight break points but it was enough to secure victory, with Medvedev, who dislikes the surface, not producing a single break.Ruud put heavy pressure on Medvedev's serve in the first set, breaking in the fourth game and serving it out.The second set featured just a single break point, earned and converted by Ruud in the 11th game, enabling him to serve for the match.Medvedev made 33 unforced errors and committed four double faults on a disappointing afternoon for the world number 10.Ruud, ranked 15th, will face Francisco Cerundolo in the final four after he edged past Jakub Mensik 3-6, 7-6 (7/5), 6-2.Fifth seed Jack Draper swept past Matteo Arnaldi 6-0, 6-4.

Poll Should players facing doping allegations be given the opportunity to explain their situation? No, the rules should be strict. Absolutely, they deserve a chance.

World No. 1 Jannik Sinner has revealed that he considered walking away from tennis earlier this year during a deeply turbulent period sparked by his three-month doping ban. In an emotional interview with Italian state broadcaster RAI, Sinner opened up about the toll the ordeal took on him — both mentally and emotionally.""Yes,"" Sinner said, when asked if he had thought about quitting the sport. ""I remember before the Australian Open this year, it wasn't a very happy time. I didn’t really feel comfortable in the locker room, where we were eating. Players were looking at me differently. I said to myself, ‘Maybe I need to take some time off after Australia.’ I didn't want [the ban], though.""Despite the unease, Sinner went on to win his second straight Australian Open title in January. But by February, a settlement with the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) was finalised, confirming a retroactive three-month ban stemming from a positive test in March 2024 — a result WADA attributed to accidental contamination by an anabolic steroid.""I had a tough time accepting these three months. Because I knew that I didn’t do anything wrong,"" Sinner said. ""But then we discussed it with my lawyer and about what could have happened in the worst-case scenario and so we decided to accept it.""The timing of the settlement — allowing Sinner to return just in time for the Italian Open next week — stirred criticism from some fellow players who claimed he received preferential treatment. Sinner, however, dismissed such claims.""I don't even want to respond. Everyone is free to say what they want. For me, the important thing is that I know what happened,"" he said. ""I don’t wish it upon anyone who is innocent to go through what I went through.""Now eager to return, Sinner added, ""I miss the competition. I’m very happy that this period is done and I’m ready to play again.""",World No. 1 Jannik Sinner reveals he considered quitting tennis earlier this year. Sinner was hit with a three-month ban after testing positive for an anabolic steroid. The Australian won his second straight Australian Open title in January. He will return to action at the Italian Open next week.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120766073,imgsize-29166,width-400,resizemode-4/Jannik-Sinner.jpg"

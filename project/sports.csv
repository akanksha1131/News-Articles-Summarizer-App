OUTSTANDING ARSENAL THUMP SPORTING

(With inputs from agencies)

Manchester City ’s woes deepened in the Champions League on Tuesday as Pep Guardiola’s side squandered a 3-0 lead to draw 3-3 with Feyenoord at the Etihad Stadium.Meanwhile, Bayern Munich defeated Paris Saint-Germain, putting the French club on the brink of elimination. Elsewhere, Arsenal, Atletico Madrid, Atalanta, and Bayer Leverkusen claimed dominant wins, while Inter Milan climbed to the top of the standings after five matches.The most dramatic action unfolded in Manchester, where City seemed to be cruising after goals from Erling Haaland (two, including a penalty) and Ilkay Gundogan’s deflected strike gave them a 3-0 advantage by the 57th minute.However, Feyenoord’s comeback began in the 75th minute when Anis Hadj Moussa capitalized on defensive errors to score. Substitute Santiago Gimenez reduced the deficit further in the 82nd minute, and the equalizer came a minute from full-time.Igor Paixao set up David Hancko, who headed home to complete a remarkable turnaround.Lewandowski notched his 100th goal in the competition with an early penalty in Barcelona's 3-0 home win over French side Brest.Dani Olmo netted midway through the second half before Lewandowski sealed Barca's win at the death, his 101st goal in the Champions League -- only Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi have scored more.Inter lead the standings with 13 points, a point ahead of Barcelona and Liverpool, after a 1-0 win at home to RB Leipzig which means they are also still yet to concede a goal.Castello Lukeba's own goal made the difference at San Siro, and Leipzig are one of only three teams to have lost five games out of five.Arsenal romped to a 5-1 victory away to Sporting in Lisbon, as the Portuguese side adapt to life without coach Ruben Amorim, who has departed for Manchester United.Gabriel Martinelli, Kai Havertz and Gabriel Magalhaes all scored in the first half for Arsenal, before Goncalo Inacio pulled one back shortly after the restart.Bukayo Saka converted a penalty on 65 minutes after Martin Odegaard had been brought down, and Leandro Trossard headed in to seal Arsenal's win late on.Atalanta romped to a 6-1 win over rock-bottom Young Boys in Switzerland, with Mateo Retegui and Charles De Ketelaere both scoring braces.Sead Kolasinac and Lazar Samardzic also netted for the Italians, with Silvere Ganvoula getting the hosts' reply.Florian Wirtz struck twice, including a penalty, as Leverkusen crushed Red Bull Salzburg 5-0, with Alejandro Grimaldo scoring a superb free-kick and Patrik Schick and Aleix Garcia also netting.Julian Alvarez and substitute Angel Correa each scored twice and Marcos Llorente and Antoine Griezmann once as Atletico romped to a 6-0 win away to Sparta Prague.Christian Pulisic, Rafael Leao and Tammy Abraham were the scorers in AC Milan's 3-2 win at Slovan Bratislava, whose goals came from Tigran Barseghyan and Nino Marcelli.Marko Tolic saw red at the end for Slovan, who are without a point.Bukayo Saka scored one goal and set up another as Arsenal thrashed Portuguese side Sporting 5-1 in their Champions League clash at the Estadio Jose Alvalade on Tuesday, their biggest away win in the competition in 21 years.Gabriel Martinelli put Arsenal ahead early on before Kai Havertz and Brazilian defender Gabriel added two more goals before halftime as Arsenal overwhelmed their hosts.Goncalo Inacio pulled a goal back for Sporting early in the second period, but Saka restored Arsenal's three-goal advantage with a penalty and Leandro Trossard got a fifth for their biggest away win in the Champions League since victory by the same scoreline at Inter Milan in 2003.Arsenal moved above Sporting to seventh place in the 36-team table with 10 points from their five games. The Portuguese side have the same number of points but are one position back on goal-difference.Inter Milan took another step towards direct qualification for the last 16 of the Champions League with Tuesday's 1-0 win over Leipzig which moved the Italians top of the table.Castello Lukeba's own goal midway through the first half was enough for Inter, who are the only team yet to concede a goal, to win their fourth straight match in Europe's elite club competition.Italian champions Inter lead Barcelona and Liverpool, who host Real Madrid on Wednesday, by a point after a narrow win which should have finished with a more emphatic scoreline for the hosts.Simone Inzaghi's side return to their Serie A title defence at high-flying Fiorentina on Sunday after a routine win at a far from full San Siro which makes a top-eight finish extremely likely with three matches remaining.","Manchester City squandered a 3-0 lead to draw 3-3 with Feyenoord at the Etihad Stadium.

Rishabh Pant becomes most expensive IPL player after he goes to LSG for Rs 27 crore at IPL auction

'It was a great feeling': Debutant Nitish Reddy on getting cap from idol Virat Kohli

New Delhi: Royal Challengers Bengaluru bought 19 players at the IPL 2025 Auction in Jeddah and their strategy seemed very clear. The franchise didn't look desperate for a captaincy option and were smart with their bids at the two-day event. The most expensive player bought by the franchise was Josh Hazlewood for Rs 12.50 crore and it wasn't a surprise that their bids for Rishabh Pant and KL Rahul - two prominent captaincy options in the pool - didn't cross Rs 11 crore and Rs 10.50 crore respectively.As TimesofIndia.com had reported Virat Kohli is set to return as RCB captain from the 2025 edition and the makeup of the 22-member (19 buys and three retentions) squad points in that direction too. They went after Pant and Rahul but the bidding pattern wasn't desperate. It seemed like bids for the two players was to form the the core but not as a leadership option. They didn't even raise the paddle for another option - Shreyas Iyer - who eventually went to Punjab Kings for Rs 26.75 crore RCB were aggressive for both Pant and Rahul at the start, but the moment the bid crossed the Rs 10 crore mark, they were happy to play spectator as teams like Lucknow Super Giants, Sunrisers Hyderabad and Delhi Capitals went after Pant, and DC, Kolkata Knight Riders, Chennai Super Kings seemed in no mood to let Rahul go.And it wasn't a surprise that they didn't go back to former skipper Faf Du Plessis who could have come cheaper than the Rs 7 crore they were paying earlier.The franchise, which is yet to win an IPL title, have assembled a strong squad for the new cycle and would hope to end the long wait under Kohli, the player who has been with them since the inaugural edition.As reporter earlier, Kohli has already had those discussions with the management and made his intentions of stepping into the leadership role clear. He had led RCB from 2013-2021 and the side reached playoffs on four occasions and came agonisingly close to winning the title in 2016 where they lost to SRH in the title clash.Both Kohli the captain and Kohli the player have unfinished business in the IPL and it remains to be seen whether 2025 could be that year.",Royal Challengers Bengaluru bought 19 players at the IPL 2025 Auction in Jeddah and their strategy seemed very clear.

Complete statement issued by friends and family:

'Would have gone from strength to strength'

Friends, family and teammates of late Australian cricketer Phillip Hughes paid their tributes on Wednesday, marking 10 years since he died after being struck on the neck while batting.Hughes, who played 26 Tests for Australia, died from bleeding on the brain after he was hit by a ball during a domestic match at the Sydney Cricket Ground on 27 November, 2014.Visuals of a 25-year-old Hughes lying helplessly on the pitch as players rushed to his side shocked world cricket, sparking an outpouring of grief and calls to make the game safer.""Today marks the 10-year anniversary of the passing of our treasured son and brother, Phillip Joel Hughes.Phillip was a loving, humorous and an infectious person to be around. He always aimed to make those around him smile and enjoy the little things in life, where his beautiful smile would come to life. He shined bright even in the tough times, which is a testament to who he was as a person, and we loved everything about him. He was the light of our lives. Phillip had a profound love for his family and lived his life with respect to everyone around him.Phillip, the small-town country boy, became an Australian Test, One-Day and Twenty-20 cricketer, where he played on the toughest pitches around the globe, alongside the toughest of cricketers on the world stage, but never forgot where he came from and who helped along the way.He was a unique individual that took risky and adventurous strides to conquer the dreams he set for himself to become Test baggy green number 408. He played cricket for all the right reasons and had the ability to take it all in his stride. He loved being a part of a team and representing Australia for the game he loved so deeply.The number of stories, laughs shared, phone calls and conversations wouldn’t be able to be told over a quick drink at the local pub, which leads us to having the opportunity nine years ago to create the official biography of Phillip – ‘Phillip Hughes The Official Biography’ that gave us the pleasure of sharing more about who Phillip was. Those pages consisted of his journey from his childhood to his final legacy of 63 NOT OUT*.10 years on, a documentary – ‘The Boy from Macksville’, will be shared alongside Cricket Australia , who we’d like to thank for supporting this endeavour and each person who worked tirelessly behind the scenes for creating a celebration of Phillip’s life. We hope we have been able to showcase that dreams really do come true and you will enjoy seeing his family, friends and teammates give more of an insight into his career from his baggy blue, baggy red, baggy green and many more moments in-between including unseen footage that can be watched for generations to come.We hope between the biography and documentary, young cricketers around the world and everyone that was with Phillip along the way, will see the hard working, dedicated, devoted and rare cricketer he was. His extraordinary talent is known by many but his lasting impression of who he was as a person will always be remembered, which makes us extremely proud of him. Phillip was always proud of the younger cricketing generation he met along the way and was always hoping he could be an inspiration, no matter where you were from and that is also our hope.Cricket gave Phillip the stepping stone to start a new adventure of Four O Eight Angus, named after his proud baggy green test cap number. Black Stud Angus Cattle farming back in our hometown of Macksville, where he loved the land and his animals and would tell anyone who would listen. The business was built on dedication and it’s a testimony to how high he climbed. He loved to symbolise his cricketing journey in his farming career as a tribute, which still stands proud today. Phillip loved Macksville and the local surrounding towns, where he was able to come back throughout his cricketing years and felt right back at home.We want to share our appreciation to everyone who has respected our privacy and wishes throughout the last decade and continuing to do so at this time. Thank you for being on this journey with Phillip, he loved taking everyone along with him on this ride, living out his childhood dreams.It is essential for us to express our heartfelt thanks, sincere gratitude and appreciation to our extended family and friends, our hometown of Macksville and surrounding towns, to the wider cricketing community in Australia and overseas and the farming community.Phillip, we love you, we miss you and we are forever proud of you. We think about you every day and we are so thankful you were ours. Thank you for being the most extraordinary son and loving brother.""- signed The Hughes Family of Gregory and Virginia, Jason, Danielle, Charlie and Billy, Megan and Curtis.Former teammate David Warner said Hughes would have been just as good, ""if not better"", than himself and Steve Smith.""I'd like to think he was probably a more complete player than what I was,"" he told Australia's NewsCorp. Darren Lehmann , Australia's coach at the time of Hughes' death, said the promising batter would have gone on to play ""120 Test matches, there's no doubt about that"".""He would've just gone from strength to strength, the way he played,"" he told national broadcaster ABC.Cricket Australia said Hughes' memory would live ""forever in our hearts"", declaring he would be ""forever 63 not out"" -- his score at the time he was struck. CA has announced a series of events to mark the anniversary, coinciding with the second Test between Australia and India in Adelaide from December 6.Meanwhile, players in upcoming domestic cricket matches across Australia will wear black armbands in his honour.","Hughes, who played 26 Tests for Australia, died from bleeding on the brain after he was hit by a ball during a domestic match at the Sydney Cricket Ground on 27 November, 2014.

NEW DELHI: Indian Premier League franchise Delhi Capitals had a fantastic two-day mega auction in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia where they hogged the limelight with their marquee buy of star India batter KL Rahul.Having retained Axar Patel, Kuldeep Yadav, Tristan Stubbs and Abishek Porel, the Delhi-based franchise made a steal deal with Rahul as he was bought for Rs 14 crore.After the two-day affair concluded on Monday, DC have pulled off a near-perfect squad which has a terrific mix of experience and youth. While DC had quite a few impressive buys at the auction alongside Rahul, bringing in the likes of Aussie speedster Mitchell Starc and Englishman Harry Brook, their strategy in picking the India domestic young guns also turned out to be quite interesting.Late on the second day of the auction, DC picked domestic talents in bulk and at low prices -- majorly all-rounder -- indicating an investment into the future.And the credit for that goes to former India cricketer Vijay Bharadwaj, who in October, had joined the franchise as the head of the talent scout wing.Along with DC director of cricket Venugopal Rao, who hails from Andhra and keenly follows state cricket, Bharadwaj was instrumental in zeroing in on the local talent as they picked the lesser-known players from the franchise trials, state leagues.Six fringe players -- Manvanth Kumar (30 Lakh), Madhav Tiwari (40 Lakh), Tripurana Vijay (30 Lakh), Ajay Mandal (30 Lakh), Vipraj Nigam (50 Lakh) and Darshan Nalkande (30 Lakh) -- were all picked by the franchise around their base prices as the franchise went big on local all-rounders.Here's a quick look at the 'desi' talents and how they have fared in India's domestic circuit.Ajay Jadav Mandal, who hails from Madhya Pradesh has got quite decent experience in India's domestic circuit.The 28-year-old represents Chattisgarh and made his First Class debut back in 2016.The all-rounder bats left-handed and is a slow, orthodox spinner.Interestingly, Ajay was picked by Chennai Super Kings previously but was not given a chance in the XI.Before the 2025 auction, Ajay scored -- 69, 66, 11*, 64, 21, 69, 57*, 2, 51*, 21, 63 -- heavily with the bat at no.7-8 and also picked a decent number of wickets in Ranji Trophy.Ajay has featured in 39 First Class games for Chhattisgarh and has a total of 1,822 runs and 124 wickets to his name. With the bat, Ajay has hit 241* in Ranji and has best figures of 7/7.Ajay also has featured in 30 List A and 42 T20s where he has 852 runs and 71 wickets combined.Skiddy pacer Darshan Nalkande, born in Wardha, Maharashtra has a bulk of experience in domestic cricket, including IPL.The 26-year-old plays for Vidarbha and has six Ranji games to his name. To go with that, Darshan has been part of Gujarat Titans and Punjab Kings set-up in the past.Although Darshan never played for Punjab Kings, he featured in six IPL matches for Titans over the last three years where he picked up 6 wickets.In List A cricket, Darshan has 49 wickets in 29 outings while in T20s he has 73 scalps in 47 matches.Darshan was also previously picked for India U19 team for the youth Asia Cup but couldn't make the World Cup squad.Born in Tekkali, Andhra Pradesh, young Tripurana Vijay has made steady progress in Indian domestic cricket.The 23-year-old represents Andhra and made his Ranji debut in 2022.Tripurana has 7 First Class games to his name where the batting all-rounder has 150 runs and 16 wickets to his name.In the Mushtaq Ali opener this season, the offie picked 4 for 8 against Nagaland.Tripurana has also played 6 List A and equal number of T20s where he has a combined 54 runs and 13 wickets.Strong performances in Karnataka's Maharaja Trophy helped Manvanth Kumar land a contract with DC at the 2025 auction.The 20-year-old from Mysore got his first exposure in cricket at 12 and since then has flourished in state cricket.In the 2023 and 2024 editions of the Maharaja Trophy, Manvanth picked 22 and 16 wickets respectively for Hubli Tigers and was even the Purple Cap holder before last season.Manvanth hasn't yet been part of Karnataka's state team but has made the right noises in T20 tournaments that helped him get in the radar of DC.Among the uncapped players, DC made an interesting buy in the form of Madhav Tiwari, who has been touted as one of the most promising desi quicks in recent times.At the base price of Rs 30 lakh, Mumbai Indians too along with DC showed a bit of interest for Madhav at the auction, raising the paddle once, before the latter sealed him for Rs 40 lakh.A clean striker with the bat, Madhav has made headlines with his pace bowling across Madhya Pradesh in the past one year.The 21-year-old was born in Gwalior and represents Bhopal Leopards in MP League.Leggie Vipraj Nigam at 20 made his First Class debut for Uttar Pradesh this season in October.Before being picked by DC at the auction, Vipraj had picked up 13 wickets against Bengal, Haryana and Karnataka in the Ranji trophy.He also had a terrific UP T20 League where he was mighty impressive with the ball for Lucknow Falcons.",Delhi Capitals have a near-perfect squad for the upcoming IPL season. The IPL franchise bought star India batsman KL Rahul for Rs 14 crore. DC also picked six fringe players in the IPL mega auction. The franchise went big on local all- rounders.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115705911,imgsize-68392,width-400,resizemode-4/115705911.jpg"

JAIPUR: Rajasthan cricket is alive and kicking. For the first time in the history of Rajasthan cricket, as many as ten players will represent the different franchises in a cash-rich Indian Premier League (IPL).The 2025 season would be the 18th edition of the IPL, organised by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), which will feature ten Rajasthan players, maximum in a single edition so far.The two-day mega auction concluded in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, on Monday in which Rajasthan’s talented cricketers were bought by various franchises. Chennai Super Kings management bought three players, while home team Rajasthan Royals and Gujarat Titans will see a couple of Rajasthan players each. Mumbai Indians, Sunrisers Hyderabad and Lucknow Super Giants also snapped a player apiece from the region.The LSG retained Ravi Bishnoi for a whopping Rs 11 crore. The young leg-spinner from Jodhpur has been a consistent performer over the years in the shortest format and would like to extend his excellent show in the upcoming season too.Experienced Deepak Chahar was bought by Mumbai Indians for Rs 9.25 crore. Medium-pacer Deepak had been with CSK earlier. The five-time champions MI went into a bidding war with Punjab Kings and CSK over Deepak.Deepak’s cousin Rahul Chahar was obtained by Sunrisers Hyderabad for Rs 3.20 crore. Leg-spinner Rahul had registered himself at a base price of Rs 1 crore. The 25-year-old has represented three teams in the IPL so far. Rahul helped MI win two IPL titles between 2019 and 2021. He was a regular in the MI playing eleven throughout the three seasons.Aggressive batter Mahipal Lomror was snapped by Gujarat Titans for Rs 1.70 cr. The diminutive southpaw, used as a finisher by RCB in the previous season, has been in red-hot form in the ongoing domestic season. Lomror, whose base price was Rs 50 lakh, is handy with the ball who smartly varies his pace and trajectory.Rajasthan Ranji Trophy captain Deepak Hooda was acquired by CSK for Rs 1.7 crore. This strategic signing is expected to bolster CSK’s middle-order batting and provide a valuable off-spin bowling option, enhancing their chances for another title run in 2025.Left-arm pacer Khaleel Ahmed’s move to the CSK marks a significant chapter in his cricketing career for a price of Rs 4.8 crores. The 26-year-old, known for his agility and wicket-taking ability, has been a steady performer since his IPL debut in 2018.Khaleel can share the new ball with his state-mate Kamlesh Nagarkoti next season for CSK. The Rajasthan pacer could not play any game in 2023 due to a back injury and was released after the season. In the 2024 auction, he went unsold.Another speedster Ashok Sharma will don the Rajasthan Royals colours. The 22-year-old has been a part of the RR camp in the past where he has been a net bowler and earned praise from a lot of players from the squad. Ashok played for KKR in 2022.Wicketkeeper-batsman Kunal Singh Rathore was again bought by RR at his base price of Rs 30 lakh.Leg-spinner Himanshu Sharma of Sikar, who played in the last three years, was unsold this season, while in-form Abhijeet Tomar was unlucky to get a chance in any of the ten teams.The Rajasthan Cricket Association (RCA) official confirmed that this is the best auction for the region and will give further boost to the sport.“It is a record for Rajasthan cricket that in all ten players will compete in the next IPL. It just goes to show that there are a lot of talented cricketers in the state. The number could have been bigger had some of the upcoming players like Kartik Sharma, Arafat Khan and a couple of others also got picked during the mega auction,” said the RCA official.","Rishabh Pant becomes most expensive IPL player after he goes to LSG for Rs 27 crore at IPL auction. For the first time in the history of Rajasthan cricket, as many as ten players will represent the different franchises in a cash-rich Indian Premier League. Mumbai Indians, Sunrisers Hyderabad and Lucknow Super Giants also snapped a player apiece from the region.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115705486,imgsize-34704,width-400,resizemode-4/115705486.jpg"

The Punjab Kings executed one of their most successful IPL auction strategies in recent years, leveraging the largest available budget to secure key players. Their primary acquisitions included Shreyas Iyer, Yuzvendra Chahal, and Arshdeep Singh, significantly bolstering their core squad.They made an early impact in IPL 2025 auction by securing Shreyas with a record-breaking bid of Rs 26.75 crore. The franchise brought back Arshdeep Singh for Rs 18 crore via RTM and later matched that amount to bring in seasoned spinner Chahal.The franchise also succeeded in reacquiring Glenn Maxwell on the opening day of the IPL auction, while making a notable investment in Marcus Stoinis, whose versatility as a potential opening batsman adds considerable value.On the second day of IPL 2025 mega auction, Punjab strengthened their squad by adding a few more valuable foreign all-rounders. They secured Azmatullah Omarzai, Marco Jansen, and Aaron Hardie, each bringing a mix of versatility and depth to the team.With these moves, PBKS addressed long-standing concerns about batting depth. Emerging talent Priyansh Arya, who has recently impressed, and a balanced approach to selections across departments, have rounded off a well-constructed and competitive team.","Punjab Kings IPL 2025 squad: Batters, wicketkeepers and allrounders.

Reigning champions Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) focused on retaining the core of their successful squad. They achieved this by re-signing key players, including a marquee acquisition of Venkatesh Iyer for Rs 23.75 crore.However, their attempt to retain Nitish Rana fell short, prompting the inclusion of experienced middle-order batters Manish Pandey and Ajinkya Rahane as replacements.On the second day of IPL 2025 auction , KKR bolstered their bowling lineup with Spencer Johnson as a backup for Anrich Nortje. They also added depth to their international contingent by signing Rovman Powell and Moeen Ali. Despite these strategic moves, managing the playing XI could be challenging, particularly deciding between Pandey and Rahane.With a compact squad of 21 players, KKR remain efficient in roster size and look well-prepared to defend their title, combining continuity with fresh talent.","IPL 2025: Kolkata Knight Riders projected XI.

NEW DELHI: The West Indies secured a commanding 201-run victory against Bangladesh in the first Test on Tuesday, with the match concluding when tail-end batsman Shoriful Islam had to retire due to injury.Bangladesh, facing a substantial target of 334 and starting the day at 109-7, suffered early setbacks as Alzarri Joseph dismissed both Jaker Ali and Hasan Mahmud during the opening session at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium in North Sound, Antigua.The match effectively ended with Bangladesh at 132-9 when Shoriful was forced to retire hurt after Joseph's bouncer struck his shoulder in the day's fifth over.Earlier in the morning's third over, Joseph had claimed Mahmud's wicket, who was caught behind without scoring. Jaker's resistance ended at 31 runs when Joseph trapped him leg before wicket.In Bangladesh's second innings, only four batters reached double figures, with Jaker's performance following his first-innings half-century. Captain Mehidy Hasan Miraz led the scoring with 45 runs.The West Indies bowling attack was spearheaded by Kemar Roach (3-20) and Jayden Seales (3-45), who proved most effective for the victorious side.The series continues with the second and final Test scheduled to begin in Jamaica on Saturday.",The West Indies secured a commanding 201-run victory against Bangladesh in the first Test on Tuesday.

I love the fans. The fans love me. In the end it is not in my hands or the fans' hands. Let's wait and see.""""I'm not going to retire soon so I'm just playing, focusing on the season and I'm trying to win the Premier League and hopefully the Champions League as well.

The other goals came from Jesus Jimenez (56) and KP Rahul (90+2) in the second half.Although Blasters controlled the match, it was the visitors who created the opening opportunity. A free kick awarded to Wilmar Jordan led to Lukas Brambilla's curling attempt towards the top left corner of Blasters' goal, but goalkeeper Sachin Suresh was equal to the task and thwarted the danger by saving the ball by diving to his right.Blasters slowly started taking control of the proceedings with their first notable chance arriving in the 17th minute.

Luna made a good run along the left flank and from the left of the box, tried to find Sadaoui with a quick back pass. But Noah failed to reach the ball as he went down after colliding with a Chennaiyin defender. However, Korou Singh, who had a good game, collected the ball and took a shot toward the post. His shot went straight towards Jesus, who slotted the ball into the back of the net from close range.In the 65th minute, Chennaiyin came close to scoring the equaliser after Brambilla managed to breach Blasters' defence and took a shot towards the goal. But his shot rebounded after hitting Milos Drincic. Chennaiyin players' appeals for handball were dismissed by the referee. Five minutes later, Blasters doubled their lead. Second-half substitute KP Rahul won the ball with a sliding effort and passed it to Luna, who with a slight touch found Noah on the left. Noah headed the ball into the right-hand corner of the net.Desperate to reduce the margin, Chennaiyin pushed men forward in the dying minutes of the game, which in fact resulted in Blasters' third goal. On a counter, Noah received the ball from the Blasters' half and with no one to defend, he made a quick run along the right. On reaching the right of the box, he put the ball into the path of an advancing Rahul KP, who slotted the ball into the net.

Inter Milan moved top of Serie A on Saturday after a first-half blitz led to the Italian champions sweeping sorry Verona aside 5-0 and going two points clear, while AC Milan played out an uneventful goal-less draw with Juventus.Simone Inzaghi's side are provisionally ahead of Napoli after netting all five of their goals in the opening 45 minutes at the Stadio Bentegodi through a Marcus Thuram brace and further strikes from Joaquin Correa, Stefan de Vrij and Yann Bisseck.Atalanta will claim top spot with a win over promoted Parma in Saturday's late match, while on Sunday Napoli host Roma on Claudio Ranieri's return to top-flight management.Correa's opener in the 17th minute, a delightful dink after smart interplay with Thuram, didn't just spark a rout, it was also the Argentinian's first Serie A goal in over two years.Out-of-favour Correa had only played 38 minutes this season before this weekend but was excellent in place of captain and star striker Lautaro Martinez who was sent home early on Saturday with the flu.""I know him well, he's been training brilliantly since July, he's got a lot of competition,"" Inzaghi told DAZN.""I'm pleased for him but I'm also pleased for the boys because they played really well,"" he added.Correa, 30, hit the woodwork twice and also laid on Thuram for the first of his two near-identical goals, which were netted within the space of three minutes and came after the France forward skipped around Verona goalkeeper Lorenzo Montipo.By the time defenders De Vrij and Bisseck -- with another strike set up by Correa -- lashed in unlikely finishes Verona were submerged in boos and whistles from the home support who loudly chanted for their team to ""show some balls"".Verona have lost nine of their 13 league matches this season and sit 14th, just three points above the relegation zone.Inter now host Leipzig on Tuesday as they push for direct qualification for the last 16 of the Champions League, having thumped Verona with a clutch of starters either injured or rested.As well as Martinez, Hakan Calhanoglu, Federico Dimarco and Benjamin Pavard missed Saturday's match after a busy period on international duty.Juve trail Inter by three points in sixth place after offering little to shout about at the San Siro.Ravaged by injuries, including to starting centre-forward Dusan Vlahovic, coach Thiago Motta was forced into an experimental line-up featuring midfielder Teun Koopmeiners up front.Despite the depleted line-up Juve had more shots on target -- two to one -- in a hugely disappointing contest in front of a crowd of more than 75,000.""I'm pleased with our performance, especially defensively against a team which created very little,"" Motta said to DAZN.""All in all we played well, I think a point right now keeps us going.

'Inexplicable'

Vigo: La Liga leaders Barcelona suffered a dramatic collapse in a 2-2 draw at Celta Vigo on Saturday.Raphinha and Robert Lewandowski's goals put the Catalans in a healthy position but Marc Casado's red card in the 82nd minute helped Celta snatch a point.Alfonso Gonzalez capitalised on a Jules Kounde error to pull a goal back before Hugo Alvarez levelled two minutes later.Barcelona have won 11 league games this season but this became the third they have failed to take three points from without teenage winger Lamine Yamal.Coach Hansi Flick said he would challenge his side to win without the injured 17-year-old wing wizard and it seemed like they were managing it until their spectacular late crumble.Barcelona are five points clear of Atletico Madrid at the top of La Liga, with champions Real Madrid, third, playing on Sunday at Leganes.""We had the game under control but the red card had a big impact on us and they scored two goals in two moves and we have to learn from that,"" Barcelona midfielder Gavi told DAZN.""The first goal was so stupid, we have to clear the ball there, but it's football and we have to learn from it, with one man less it's hard.""Gavi made his first start in over a year after recovering from a severe knee injury.""I'm happy, after a year, but the truth is the important thing was the three points and it wasn't possible,"" added the 20-year-old.Flick shifted Raphinha into Yamal's position on the right, using Dani Olmo on the left and Pedri in attacking midfield.Raphinha opened the scoring in the 15th minute, slotting home neatly to continue his fine form after Kounde lofted a ball forward for him.Barcelona left-back Gerard Martin was issued an early booking and lived on the edge in the first half, nudging over Iago Aspas as he ran through but just about staying on the right side of the law.The defender then fouled Aspas before half-time and was lucky to escape a second booking as Celta's captain fumed and was issued a yellow card himself for his outburst.Flick brought off Martin at the break for Hector Fort, fearing a potential dismissal.Hunting for Barcelona's second, Lewandowski had produced a fine lobbed finish in the first half but the goal was chalked off for offside.The forward was not to be denied though and just after the hour mark he stroked home Barcelona's second after Raphinha played him in.It was the 36-year-old striker's 15th league goal of the campaign, further extending his vast lead as La Liga's top scorer.Inaki Pena made a handful of saves for Barcelona, denying Hugo Alvarez with his leg.Raphinha could have killed the game off completely but the winger hit the post with a low effort after being sent through.The Catalans were reduced to 10 men after 82 minutes when recent Spain debutant Casado picked up his second yellow card for fouling former Barca midfielder Ilaix Moriba.It restored Celta's belief and moments later they pulled one back when Kounde dallied on the ball in his own area and Gonzalez picked his pocket and finished past Pena.Two minutes later Alvarez levelled for Celta as Barcelona collapsed, cutting in from the right and finishing clinically to snatch a point.Celta, 11th, have a strong record at Balaidos against Barcelona in recent years and the players celebrated with their fans at the end of the game.""We found ourselves with that red card and the (first) goal, and then the second came, it's inexplicable,"" said a delighted Alvarez.""We got the draw, we wanted more -- this team has great quality.""",Barcelona held to a 2-2 draw by Celta Vigo in La Liga on Saturday.

NEW DELHI: Tottenham delivered a crushing 4-0 victory at the Etihad, ending Manchester City 's impressive 52-game unbeaten home streak on Sunday.The first half saw James Maddison score twice within seven minutes, followed by Pedro Porro's goal against his previous club and Brennan Johnson's finishing touch to complete the victory.This defeat, City's first at home from open play since before the 2022 World Cup, leaves them trailing Premier League leaders Liverpool by five points. Liverpool have a game remaining against bottom-placed Southampton on Sunday.The victory provides relief for Tottenham and Ange Postecoglou as they advance into the top six positions.Despite recently extending his contract until 2027, Pep Guardiola faces the challenge of addressing the worst performance streak in his managerial career.The anticipated revival of the four-time consecutive Premier League champions following Guardiola's new contract failed to materialise.Before the match, Rodri displayed his Ballon d'Or trophy to supporters, with his name illuminated across the Etihad pitch.The Spanish midfielder, aged 28, is sidelined for the remainder of the season due to knee ligament damage sustained in September, and his absence has significantly affected City's performance.City began positively with Guglielmo Vicario stopping Erling Haaland's attempt, followed by another deflected shot from the Norwegian.The match's direction shifted dramatically with Tottenham's first serious offensive move after 13 minutes.Dejan Kulusevski provided an excellent cross to Maddison, who finished with precision.Recently excluded from Postecoglou's starting lineup, Maddison was determined to demonstrate his worth.Son Heung-min's creative pass enabled the England player to score his second goal, lifting the ball over the advancing Ederson.Tottenham's season has been marked by fluctuating performances.Following a 2-1 home loss to Ipswich before the international break, which dropped them to 10th position, they have now secured two significant victories in Manchester, including a 3-0 win at Old Trafford.Ederson made an excellent save to prevent Dominic Solanke from scoring before halftime.Seven minutes into the second half, Kulusevski's cross found Solanke, who assisted Porro's powerful close-range finish.Haaland nearly scored from an acute angle, hitting the crossbar as City struggled to respond.The final blow came when Timo Werner outpaced Kyle Walker and crossed for Johnson to score at the far post. Kevin De Bruyne 's return as a late substitute after two months offers City some optimism.However, Guardiola must find quick solutions to maintain their title defence, with a challenging visit to Anfield next, where City haven't won before spectators since 2003.","Tottenham beat Manchester City 4-0 at the Etihad on Sunday.

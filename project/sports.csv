Poll Do you think Rishabh Pant's injury could impact India's performance in the match? Yes, significantly Yes, but not too much No, it won't affect the team Not sure

NEW DELHI: India’s Rishabh Pant suffered a foot fracture during the ongoing Manchester Test against England after attempting a reverse sweep on Day 1. The injury occurred when he was on 37, as Chris Woakes delivered a yorker that struck Pant’s right toe, reportedly causing the fracture.Despite the setback, Pant resumed his innings on Day 2 and battled through the pain to notch up a gritty half-century before falling to Jofra Archer . His injury has now cast doubt over his availability for India’s second innings and reignited conversations around the use of injury substitutes in Test cricket.Former England captain Geoffrey Boycott, speaking on The Telegraph Podcast, criticised Pant’s shot selection and said the injury was avoidable.“It is always sad when a player gets hurt and affects his ability to play a part in the game—especially someone as talented as him. But he has only himself to blame,” Boycott said.“They were nicely in control, batting orthodox—there was no need to try something outrageous. Rishabh tries amazing strokes. When they come off, people are astonished and cheer him, and that is the essence of his batting. But when they don’t, it can look silly.India were building a strong position. Some might say that’s just his nature, but if he can’t bat in both innings, it might cost India the match. He’s that important,” he added.The incident has sparked fresh debate over allowing like-for-like substitutions in Tests.Speaking to TalkSport Cricket, former England batter David Lloyd offered his take: “I’m probably against runners, but I’m in favour of substitutes for external injuries. It does open a can of worms, but if it’s a break and medically he’s out for six weeks, then maybe a like-for-like replacement is worth considering. Not something like replacing a batter with a spinner, though.”","India’s Rishabh Pant suffered a foot fracture during the ongoing Manchester Test against England.

India: 358 trail England: 544/7

by 186 runs.

The last half an hour of the second session aptly summed up India's Day 3 at Old Trafford cricket ground. Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Siraj were feeling some discomfort in their left ankle, Shubman Gill was forced to operate with Shardul Thakur - not Gill's choice as it was KL Rahul who handed over the ball to him when the captain was in the change room for a quick break - and Anshul Kamboj with the second new ball and the body language remained very flat.Karun Nair and Abhimanyu Easwaran kept going in and out of the field as substitute fielders and the rest - Prasidh Krishna, Kuldeep Yadav, Arshdeep Singh, Akash Deep - ensured that the drinks were loaded and chilled. In the middle of the hapless period, Arshdeep kept the(environment) light as he urged teammates to clap every time he returned from drinks duties. The, however, was anything but light in the middle as India put on a listless show with the ball and operated with questionable tactics throughout the day.From under-bowling Thakur, again, to waiting 68 overs before handing over the ball to Washington Sundar, captain Gill let the game slip away. Even Sundar's drift, which got India two quick wickets of Ollie Pope and Harry Brook, wasn't enough to turn momentum India's way as the rest remained very ordinary.Bumrah ran in hard but his lines remained all over the place, Siraj was erratic & expensive, Anshul Kamboj was a royal disappointment on debut and Thakur wasn't considered.The only period of some control came when the two spinners bowled in tandem and while Ravindra Jadeja too failed to keep it tight, he was in good rhythm with Sundar in that period post the Lunch interval.The visitors did delay taking the second new ball due to the control which spinners were enjoying but the moment it was taken in the 91st over and pace was introduced, run-making returned to fluent ways for the hosts who operated in comfortable fashion with the Ben Stokes-Joe Root stand. The right-hander scored another hundred, went past Ricky Ponting's 13,378 Test runs and the Indian shoulders remained down.On a day where there wasn't an overcast cloud in the sky and it remained bright and sunny, India's tactical blunders were exposed as they clearly didn't pick the right attack for the surface. Dry and placid, the 22 yards had some variable bounce on the first two days under clouds but evened out when it baked under the sun. It was then just the case of exhibiting the right temperament and showing patience as enough runs were on offer. India just didn't have the attack to even try a Plan B.It was another day of wondering what could have been had the guy wearing a bib - Kuldeep Yadav - was giving the oldish Dukes a rip. It's for days and situations like these that you needed some variation but India's obsession with depth and bits-and-pieces template exposed their trumpet of picking an attack to pick 20 wickets. After the Leeds defeat, where they weren't able to defend 370, India swiftly packed their batting instead of adding a wicket-taking option with the ball.The pitches have remained flat and dry in all four Tests so far but Kuldeep's bib is yet to come off. The preference to batting depth has compromised India's wicket-taking ability and it turned out to be a long day under the sun where the opposition milked runs for fun. When Gill and the rest dragged themselves to the change room, the body language was a true reflection of how the day unfolded for them. The loud sledge from the stand near the stairs did catch a few players' attention but they were too tired to care at the moment.Head down, they called it a day and even Arshdeep's claps and infectious energy wasn't enough to give the shoulders a lift.(Joe Root 150, Ben Duckett 94, Zak Crawley 84, Ben Stokes 77*; Washington Sundar 2/57, Ravindra Jadeja 2/117)",Ben Stokes remained unbeaten at close on Day 3 of the fourth Test between England and India at Old Trafford in Manchester.

NEW DELHI: England asserted their dominance on Day 2 of the fourth Test against India at Old Trafford, Manchester, ending Thursday’s play at 225/2.

How and why Rishabh Pant's England tour could come to an abrupt end due to toe fracture

Poll What do you think of Rishabh Pant's performance despite his injury? Incredible display of courage Just a good innings Should have rested

NEW DELHI: In a stirring display of courage and class, Rishabh Pant once again proved why he is India’s heartbeat in Test cricket, battling through a toe injury to script a fighting fifty on Day 2 of the fourth Test against England at Old Trafford. The left-hander walked out to bat with a visible limp after Shardul Thakur’s dismissal, triggering a standing ovation from the Manchester crowd — and admiration from cricketing legends worldwide.Pant, undeterred by pain, struck 54 off 75 balls, peppered with three boundaries and two sixes, matching Virender Sehwag’s all-time Indian record of 90 sixes in Test cricket. His brave effort, however, was more than just numbers.India’s cricketing icon Sachin Tendulkar led the chorus of praise, posting on X: “Resilience is about playing through pain and rising above it. @RishabhPant17 showed tremendous character by walking back into the game with an injury and delivering a performance like that. His fifty is a powerful reminder of the grit and determination it takes to represent your country.”Former all-rounder Yuvraj Singh echoed the sentiment on Instagram, writing: “True spirit shows up when the spirit is indomitable! Injury can shake the body but not the mind, good stuff @rishabhpant.”Veteran pacer Ishant Sharma also lauded Pant’s grit in an interview with ANI: “This shows how mentally strong he is. If someone does not give up in life, then they can make a comeback in life.”Pant’s knock was not only inspirational but historic. He overtook Rohit Sharma to become India’s leading run-scorer in the World Test Championship era, now sitting on 2731 runs in 38 Tests. The fifty in Manchester also pushed him past MS Dhoni in 50+ scores for Indian wicketkeepers — Pant now has 14, compared to Dhoni’s 13.In pain, but never in doubt, Pant’s innings was a celebration of resilience, a moment that left fans and legends alike in awe — and one that will be etched in the folklore of the Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy.","Rishabh Pant hits 54 off 75 balls, peppered with three boundaries and two sixes.

Poll What was your impression of Anshul Kamboj's debut performance? Outstanding Solid but could improve

NEW DELHI: India’s newest Test debutant, Anshul Kamboj, announced himself on the big stage with a crucial breakthrough on Day 2 of the fourth Test at Old Trafford, Manchester, removing England opener Ben Duckett for 94 and giving his team a much-needed lifeline after a dominant opening stand.The 24-year-old Haryana pacer, drafted into the squad after injuries to multiple frontline quicks, produced a sharp, rising delivery from a back-of-a-length that surprised Duckett, who could only edge it to substitute wicketkeeper Dhruv Jurel. It was Kamboj’s maiden Test wicket, and his emotional celebration — arms outstretched and a roar of relief — reflected what the moment meant to him.Speaking to broadcasters after the day's play, Kamboj was honest and grounded in his reflections.“I felt good. I tried to start by bowling in good areas… I am not satisfied with my bowling,” he chuckled modestly. “I tried to come and bowl. I would have done better.”The nerves of debuting in a high-stakes series were evident.“I just tried to act a little more in the first two spells. But in the third spell, I backed my strengths more.Tomorrow, we’ll try to bowl tight, not give many boundaries. Because they’re looking for boundaries, not singles,” he explained with tactical clarity.Kamboj also shared the invaluable experience of bowling alongside India’s pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah “There is so much to learn. When you are bowling with Jasprit Bumrah, you get to learn a lot. We keep having discussions about what we need to do, so I have to adapt accordingly,” he said.Kamboj’s journey from India A ranks to the Test arena has been rapid but deserved, and with this first wicket under his belt, he has taken the first big stride in what could be a long journey ahead.India ended the day with hopes rekindled, thanks in no small part to a debutant who rose to the occasion.","Anshul Kamboj took the wicket of Ben Duckett on Day 2 of the fourth Test at Old Trafford, Manchester.

This comes weeks after a rape complaint was filed against him in Uttar Pradesh’s Ghaziabad by another woman, who accused him of “exploiting” her.Sanganer Sadar police station SHO Anil Kumar Jaiman confirmed Dayal’s identity in the FIR, registered on Wednesday under Section 64 of the new Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS), which prescribes a minimum jail term of 10 years, along with relevant provisions of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act.As reported by The Times of India, the latest complaint alleges that Dayal, part of the IPL 2024 title-winning RCB squad, first assaulted the then 17-year-old girl in 2023, and then again in April this year at a hotel in Jaipur.“It is alleged that around two years ago, when the complainant was a minor, he raped her on multiple occasions after offering to help build her cricket career,” SHO Jaiman said. “This year, he contacted her again while in Jaipur for IPL duty, called her to his hotel, and allegedly raped her there.”A senior police officer said the case was registered immediately after the survivor chose to report the multiple instances of alleged sexual assault since 2023.Investigators are working on the case, including steps to record her detailed statement, he said.Allahabad High Court stayed Dayal's arrest in the Ghaziabad case on July 15, saying no coercive action should be taken against him till the next hearing.The FIR had been filed on July 6 at Indirapuram police station, based on a complaint by the survivor to UP CM Yogi Adityanath through the state's integrated grievance redress system.","Royal Challengers Bengaluru fast bowler Yash Dayal has been named in a second FIR, this time in Jaipur.

NEW DELHI: Former Australia captain Ricky Ponting didn’t hold back in his assessment of India’s tactics on Day 2 of the fourth Test at Old Trafford, calling Shubman Gill ’s side “tactically off” after England’s openers Zak Crawley and Ben Duckett dominated with a 166-run stand.Speaking to Sky Sports, Ponting criticised India’s field placements and bowling choices, especially during the opening hour when debutant Anshul Kamboj shared the new ball with Jasprit Bumrah.“They got scored off on both sides of the wicket, didn’t they?” Ponting said bluntly. “I think they were tactically off as well. I don’t think Kamboj should have taken the new ball. I didn’t like that from the start.”Duckett took full advantage, smashing five of his first six boundaries on the leg-side behind square.“They were tactically wrong there,” Ponting continued. “Even watching now, Bumrah is bowling from the wrong end. Most of the wickets have fallen from the Statham End, and he’s done most of his work from the Anderson End. They were off execution-wise and tactically they’ve been off as well.”England ended Day 2 on 225/2 in reply to India’s 358, trailing by 133 runs. Duckett (94) and Crawley (84) both fell short of centuries, but their aggressive start ensured England held the momentum heading into Day 3.Kamboj, playing only due to injuries to India’s pace unit, picked up his maiden Test wicket when Duckett edged him to Dhruv Jurel.With the series at 2-1 in England’s favour, a win in Manchester would seal the series for Ben Stokes’ side.

Karun Nair’s long-awaited return to Test cricket after eight years was meant to be a fresh chapter—filled with big runs, vital partnerships, and a statement-making comeback. Instead, it turned into a struggle for form. Following a string of underwhelming performances in the first three matches, Nair was dropped from India’s playing XI for the fourth Test at Old Trafford.In six innings, the right-hander managed just 131 runs, prompting the team management to replace him with B Sai Sudharsan for the crucial fourth Test.India made three changes to their line-up in Manchester. Anshul Kamboj was handed a Test debut, while Sudharsan came in for Nair and Shardul Thakur replaced Nitish Kumar Reddy, who was sidelined due to a left knee injury.After Nair's exclusion, an emotional photo began circulating on social media, showing him being consoled by close friend and star cricketer KL Rahul The image quickly went viral, capturing what many assumed was the heartbreak of being dropped.However, a TimesofIndia.com fact-check revealed that the photograph was taken during the Lord's Test, not at Old Trafford.Nair’s comeback got off to a rocky start. In the first Test at Headingley, he was dismissed for a duck in the first innings and scored just 20 in the second.He retained his place for the second Test, posting scores of 31 and 26. A 40-run knock in the first innings of the third Test at Lord’s showed signs of promise, but he followed it up with a disappointing 14.With his spot under increasing scrutiny, captain Shubman Gill decided to leave him out for the fourth Test.Former India cricketer Mohammad Kaif criticised the decision, suggesting that Gill missed an opportunity to show leadership by backing a player in need.“Today was Shubman Gill's chance to back Karun who was down but deserved one more chance. He should have picked Karun Nair. Chance missed to earn the respect when it comes to making tough decisions as a leader,” Kaif posted on X.England currently lead the five-match series 2-1, following their dramatic 22-run win in the third Test at Lord’s.","Karun Nair was dropped from India’s playing XI for the fourth Test at Old Trafford.

India fast bowler Mohammed Siraj endured a tough outing on Thursday at Old Trafford, going wicketless in his 10 overs while conceding 58 runs in the fourth Test match against England. During the third session, Siraj lost his cool and got into a heated verbal exchange with England opener Ben Duckett , who, along with Zak Crawley , stitched together a dominant 166-run opening stand against an out-of-sorts Indian attack.The altercation drew attention after Star Sports shared a video clip on X, showing Siraj angrily pointing fingers at Duckett. The footage quickly went viral across social media platforms.Duckett, continuing his fine form after a 149-run knock in the previous Test at Leeds, played another impactful innings. He struck 94 off 100 balls, hitting 13 boundaries, before falling just short of a century.The breakthrough came when debutant Anshul Kamboj picked up his first Test wicket, getting Duckett caught behind by Dhruv Jurel off the first ball of the 39th over. With that scalp, Kamboj became the fourth fast bowler from Haryana—after Kapil Dev, Yograj Singh, and Chetan Sharma—to take a Test wicket for India.Kamboj, who has 79 wickets from 24 first-class matches, was added to the Indian squad on Monday following injuries to Nitish Kumar Reddy and Arshdeep Singh.Earlier, India posted 358 in their first innings across 119.1 overs.

Poll Will India win Day 3 of the fourth Test? Yes, they will bounce back! No, England will dominate.

NEW DELHI: As England tightened their grip on the fourth Test at Old Trafford, former skipper Michael Vaughan delivered a rallying call for India, urging Shubman Gill’s side to channel the intensity of Virat Kohli heading into what he described as the “series-defining” Day 3.At stumps on Day 2, England were well-positioned at 225/2, trailing India’s first-innings total of 358 by just 133 runs. Openers Zak Crawley (84) and Ben Duckett (94) put on a blistering 166-run stand before both fell short of centuries. Debutant Anshul Kamboj claimed his maiden wicket when Duckett edged to stand-in wicketkeeper Dhruv Jurel.With England already leading the five-match series 2-1, Vaughan stressed the importance of Day 3 on Cricbuzz.“The series will be decided on Day Three. If England have a great day, I think they’re winning this Test match and that’s the series done and dusted,” he said. “India and Shubman have to arrive on Day Three with that Virat mentality. We have to win the day. If they win tomorrow, the game is alive. If they lose, the series is gone.”Backing Vaughan’s assessment, Dinesh Karthik added: ""Those are big words and I think it's a very fair observation as well. Because walking into day three, as they call it, the moving day, you would almost think the series hangs in the balance on that day. If India wants to stay alive, they need to have a good day with the ball.""All eyes will be on India's bowlers on Friday — as they look to summon the fight and fire that defined the Kohli era.",Michael Vaughan urges India to channel Virat Kohli's intensity on Day 3.

How and why Rishabh Pant's England tour could come to an abrupt end due to toe fracture

MANCHESTER: In gloomy conditions at Old Trafford, India looked like they were going to do an encore of Gabba 2021. Shardul Thakur and Washington Sundar’s gritty 48-run partnership, against the new ball, started the fight on the second morning of the fourth Test.Rishabh Pant, coming back after retiring hurt on Wednesday evening, added 17 runs with a fractured right foot in an exhibition of indomitable spirit. The circumstances leading to Thursday morning resembled India’s tour of Australia in 2020-21. The characters in play were the same. It all seemed to be going according to plan when India reached 358 battling against the likes of Ben Stokes , who had spectacular figures of 5/72, and Jofra Archer ’s spell of 3/73. All that fight evaporated when the sun broke out as England openers Ben Duckett and Zak Crawley plundered the Indian bowling for 166 runs in 32 overs.That opening partnership laid the foundation for England to finish the day at 225/2 in 46 overs, closing in on India’s first-innings score in double quick time. India did rediscover some of the fight, claiming two wickets in six overs through Ravindra Jadeja and debutant Anshul Kamboj’s dismissals of Crawley and Duckett, for 84 and 94 respectively.Jasprit Bumrah’s late burst gave Joe Root a few nervy moments but it didn’t yield any results. Captain Shubman Gill looked completely out of depth and appeared in no control of the proceedings.Gill and his bowlers will be desperate to turn a corner early on Friday morning or else they could see the match and the series running away from them very quickly with Ollie Pope and Joe Root batting on 20 and 11 respectively. India’s seam bowling looked the flattest in the most favourable conditions in the series.It’s safe to say they played their most ordinary cricket in the series after the last two sessions of the first Test in Leeds. Bumrah was the only one who turned up looking at his usual best, but his good work was undone as Kamboj struggled to find any rhythm with the new ball. The nerves of playing a Test match kicked in and the 24-year-old Kamboj lost his line.He was significantly down on pace as well in his first spell. Once he leaked a few boundaries, mostly on the leg-side, it became a template. Mohammed Siraj, on the back of two good Test matches, too leaked runs on both sides of the wicket.Shardul Thakur, too, never settled down on a line and length. The outfield quickening up in the sun left the Indian bowlers with lesser room for error. It was like watching two different Indian teams on the field. When Archer removed Jadeja for 20 with the new ball at the score of 266/5 in the second over of the day, India’s capitulation seemed a matter of time. The ball flew past the edges of the bats of Thakur and Washington. Like they did in Gabba all those years ago, the duo batted sensibly to frustrate Stokes and Archer.Stokes eventually worked out both of them, dismissing Thakur for 41 off 88 and Washington 27 off 90. And when Pant went about middling the balls he played, it seemed India had got the momentum going in their favour. India’s resistance with the bat had managed to hurt England’s ego in trying conditions.","Rishabh Pant added 17 runs with a fractured right foot in an exhibition of indomitable spirit.

Poll Should Washington Sundar have been introduced earlier in the attack? Yes, definitely! No, the timing was fine.

Former England captain Nasser Hussain has sharply criticised India's tactical decisions on Day 3 of the fourth Test at Old Trafford, particularly Shubman Gill 's delay in bringing Washington Sundar into the attack.India introduced Sundar only in the 69th over, with England cruising at 305/2. Despite a wicketless first session, Sundar struck quickly after lunch, removing Ollie Pope for 71 and then Harry Brook for 3, offering India a glimpse of fightback on a day otherwise dominated by the hosts.In his column for the Daily Mail, Hussain expressed disbelief at the delay: “It was astonishing. You could tell he was full of confidence by the way he spoke so boldly about winning at Lord's, after taking four wickets, and I haven't seen a spin bowler in England get such beautiful drift, even against the wind.”Hussain referenced Sundar's 4/22 in the second innings at Lord's, and stressed that he should have been used far earlier: “They completely overlooked bowling Washington Sundar… not turning to him until the 69th over when England were 305 for two. He made an impact the moment he was introduced… leaving you wondering: where's he been?”Hussain also questioned India's bowling approach to Joe Root, who scored a majestic 150 to help England reach 544/7 at stumps, with a commanding 186-run lead.“The way India bowled to Joe Root was baffling too. On the quickest, bounciest pitch in the country historically, he received just two bouncers up until lunch on day three.”He noted that Root now intercepts the ball 27 centimetres closer to the bowler than he did in 2018, and India should have targeted him with short balls, forcing him on the back foot.With Root now second on the all-time Test run-scorers list, behind only Sachin Tendulkar , and England firmly in control, India's decisions — particularly Gill's Sundar snub — are coming under increasing scrutiny.","India introduced Washington Sundar only in the 69th over, with England cruising at 305/2.

Poll Will Joe Root surpass Sachin Tendulkar as the leading run-scorer in Test history? Yes, definitely! No, Tendulkar's record is too high.

Australia legend Ricky Ponting has thrown his weight behind Joe Root to eventually eclipse Sachin Tendulkar as the leading run-scorer in Test history, calling the England batter’s recent feat ""a magnificent moment in history.""Root dazzled at Old Trafford, scoring a sublime 150 against India in the fourth Test of the ongoing Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy. With that innings, Root moved past Rahul Dravid , Jacques Kallis, and finally Ponting himself to become the second-highest run-getter in Test history.Root now has 13,409 runs from 157 Tests, only behind Tendulkar’s iconic 15,921. The crowd at Old Trafford gave the 34-year-old a standing ovation as he went past Ponting’s tally of 13,378.Ponting, who was on-air for Sky Sports, was glowing in his praise: ""Congratulations Joe Root. A magnificent moment in history. Second on the table. Just the one more to go now. About two-and-a-half-thousand runs behind, but the way his career's gone over the last four or five years there's absolutely no reason why he can't be number one.""The former Australia skipper emphasised Root’s incredible form post-30, noting: ""To score 25 Test hundreds after turning 30 says everything about his mental capacity.He still has that hunger and desire to improve. That doesn't get easier with age, but Root makes it look effortless.""Ponting also highlighted how Root’s batting remains unaffected by personal milestones: ""He’s not someone obsessed with stats or numbers. Like most of us, when you're playing, it’s about winning matches. But when he eventually retires, he’ll look back and be immensely proud. The volume, the consistency — it's remarkable.""He further added context from his own career: ""I didn’t even know how many runs I had when I finished. That wasn’t what motivated me, and it’s clear it’s the same for Joe. But it’s still a legacy. And if he keeps averaging 85 runs a game like he has, and plays another 20–30 Tests, then that Tendulkar mark is within reach.""Root’s latest hundred — his 38th in Tests — also puts him level with Kumar Sangakkara in the all-time hundreds list. England, leading the series 2-1, are in a commanding position, and Root’s masterclass might prove decisive again.","Ricky Ponting has backed Joe Root to eventually eclipse Sachin Tendulkar as the leading run-scorer in Test history.

TimesofIndia.com in Manchester:

Poll How concerned are you about Jasprit Bumrah's drop in pace? Very concerned Somewhat concerned Not concerned at all

India bowling coach Morne Morkel expressed concern as he admitted that his bowlers lacked bite and energy on Day 3 of the fourth Test at Old Trafford, highlighting a worrying drop in pace from the team's quicks.“We are trying to wrap our heads around it. Not too much to judge in that, but it was a heavy outfield. But we need energy on the ball on a surface like this,” India’s bowling coach told reporters at the end of day's play on day 3.The numbers underline the concern as well. Jasprit Bumrah bowled over 140 kmph in 39.84% of his deliveries at Headingley and 26.84% at Lord’s. At Old Trafford, that number has plummeted to just 0.57% (just 1 out of 173 balls, including no-balls). This staggering dip in pace for India's spearhead surely is a matter of concern for the side as they head into day 4.India’s pace unit struggled for penetration all day as England ended Day 3 on 544/7, leading by 186 runs. Joe Root’s sensational 150 and Ollie Pope’s 71 kept the visitors under pressure throughout, with India conceding 500-plus in an overseas Test innings for the first time since 2015.Morkel, however, said the team was more disciplined compared to the previous day.“We were much better today with the ball. Yesterday was a tough day,” he said. “Siraj and Boom (Bumrah) started well today.”Both Bumrah and Siraj had injury scares before Tea, leaving the field in discomfort. Morkel downplayed the concerns, saying, “Bumrah rolled his ankle going down the stairs, Siraj also rolled his ankle. Both are fine.”India handed a debut to Anshul Kamboj in this crucial Test, who just has the one wicket of Ben Duckett to show for, which came on Day 2. “We needed someone who could bowl volume and is accurate. His name was in the mix for a long time,” Morkel said.Shardul Thakur, meanwhile, was used sparingly. The 33-year-old's six overs on Friday was not much of an increase as compared to the five overs that were allotted to him on Thursday. “Tough one when you have four seamers and going at over five,” Morkel said.Washington Sundar, who picked two wickets, was only brought into the attack in the 69th over. Elaborating on the timing of his deployment, the bowling coach said, “Shubman made that call to stick longer with seam option.”On Kuldeep Yadav’s continued exclusion, he added, “He is bowling very well right now, he is a quality bowler, but at the moment it’s due to batting depth and balance of the side.”With England looking to extend their advantage, India face a steep climb. Trailing in both the game and the series, the visitors will need to force a turnaround on Saturday.","Jasprit Bumrah bowled over 140 kmph in 39.84% of his deliveries at Headingley.

Poll Will Joe Root surpass Sachin Tendulkar's record for Test runs? Yes, he will definitely surpass it No, he won't

TimesofIndia.com in Manchester: Ollie Pope was all smiles at the end of Day 3 in Manchester as he spoke warmly about Joe Root ’s brilliance with the bat and Ben Stokes ’ resilience with the ball. England had ended the day on 544 for 7, leading India by 186 runs in the fourth Test.“Rooty’s knock was exactly what the team needed,” Pope said. “He is a joy to watch. The way he keeps stepping up, it’s just incredible. Last four or five years, he’s hit a ridiculous number of hundreds. He just keeps getting better.”Root's innings of 150 was not just a major moment in the match but also a historic one. It took him past Ricky Ponting on the all-time list of Test run-scorers. Only Sachin Tendulkar is now ahead.“He’s not a massive one for milestones,” Pope said with a laugh. “But that’s a cool one — second most Test runs. I’m sure he was aware.”When asked about Root potentially catching Tendulkar’s record, Pope didn’t rule it out. “The way he’s batting, I’m sure he’ll be driven to be No.1. He’s got the hunger.”Pope also offered a fitness update on Stokes, who had briefly retired hurt due to cramps. “He’s okay. Just cramping a bit. The amount he’s bowled and pushed himself — serious limits. But he’ll be good to go tomorrow.”Pope had earlier partnered Root in a 144-run stand before being dismissed for 71. The right-hander was full of admiration for the way England’s senior players were taking charge in a potentially series-clinching Test.With Root rewriting records and Stokes soldiering on, England look well placed to press home their advantage at Old Trafford.","Ollie Pope praises Joe Root and Ben Stokes at end of Day 3.

The M Chinnaswamy stadium in Bengaluru has been declared unsuitable and unsafe for large-scale events by the Justice John Michael Cunha Commission, following a tragic stampede on July 4 during Royal Challengers Bengaluru's IPL victory celebrations that resulted in 11 deaths and over 50 injuries. The commission's report, shared with the Karnataka government, criticised the venue's design and structure while indicting RCB, DNA Entertainment, and the Karnataka State Cricket Association for their roles in the incident.The commission's findings highlighted systematic limitations at the stadium, which was built in 1974, and strongly recommended relocating major events to more suitable venues.""Any future venue should adhere to international standards,"" the report stated, raising concerns about upcoming matches, including the ICC Women's ODI Cricket World Cup games scheduled from September 30 to November 2.The Karnataka State Cricket Association has already announced that its Maharaja Trophy T20 League, beginning August 11, will be played behind closed doors.The report outlined several missing requirements at the Chinnaswamy Stadium, including ""purpose-built queuing and circulation areas separated from public roads, sufficient entry and exit gates to manage mass ingress and egress, integrated access to public transport and nearby tourist hubs, comprehensive emergency evacuation plans in line with global safety norms and adequate parking and drop-off facilities to accommodate large volumes of attendees.The panel recommended action against KSCA chief Raghuram Bhat, former secretary A Shankar, and former treasurer ES Jairam, with the latter two having resigned citing moral responsibility after the incident. RCB vice-president Rajesh Menon and DNA Entertainment Networks executives T Venkat Vardhan and Sunil Mathur were also named in the report.Several police officers, including B Dayananda, Vikash Kumar, Shekhar HT, C Balakrishna, and AK Girish, who were part of the arrangements and subsequently removed by Chief Minister Siddaramaiah, were also held responsible.The report stated that organising big-attendance events at the stadium will pose ""unacceptable risks to public safety, urban mobility, and emergency preparedness.""The Karnataka government, which had celebrated the title win with players in a felicitation event at Vidhana Soudha, is expected to decide on the recommendations during the next cabinet meeting.The tragic incident occurred just one day after RCB secured their first IPL title, ending an 18-year wait for the trophy.","Royal Challengers Bengaluru's IPL title celebrations turned disastrous with 11 dead in stampede.

Poll What do you think is the main reason for India's struggle in the current Test match? Strong English batting performance Poor fielding and catching Unfavorable pitch conditions

India endured a punishing Day 3 at Old Trafford as England tightened their grip on the fourth Test with a commanding total and a historic statistic to show for it. The visitors were made to toil under clear skies in Manchester, with little reward for their bowlers despite sporadic breakthroughs.The damage began early, as Zak Crawley and Ben Duckett stitched together a dominant 166-run opening stand. Ravindra Jadeja and debutant Anshul Kamboj managed to break the partnership, but England were already in cruise control.Joe Root then took charge with a masterclass in batting, notching up150, while Ollie Pope contributed 71 off 128 balls to further frustrate the Indian attack. With runs flowing freely and no significant threat from the bowlers, England surged past the 500-run mark — the first time India have conceded such a total in an overseas Test since January 2015.That previous instance came during the Sydney Test in 2015. Since then, India had managed to avoid conceding 500-plus totals away from home. However, this is now the third time England have breached that mark against them in recent years — following 537 in Rajkot (2016) and 578 in Chennai (2021).With stumps coming soon on Day 3, England looked well set to push their total closer to 600 and bat deep into Day 4, leaving India staring at a massive first-innings deficit. With the series on the line, Shubman Gill ’s men face an uphill battle to claw back into the contest.","England reach 500-0 on Day 3 of the fourth Test at Old Trafford.

Poll What do you think about Ben Stokes' decision to retire hurt? Smart precautionary measure Unnecessary, he should have continued I’m unsure, it depends on the injury

Ben Stokes retired hurt on Day 3 of the crucial fourth Test at Old Trafford, walking off after scoring a gritty 66 as England continued to pile on the pressure against India. The England skipper called time on his innings late in the day, handing over the baton to youngster Jamie Smith.Stokes had played a composed knock, scoring 66 off 116 deliveries, including six boundaries, at a strike rate of 56.90. As he left the field, there were visible signs of discomfort — a slight limp as he walked off and climbed the steps to the dressing room. While the exact nature of the issue remains unclear, supporters will be hoping that it is nothing more than a cramp.With England in a commanding position and enjoying a hefty first-innings lead, Stokes' decision to retire appeared precautionary. However, with the match still delicately poised in the context of the series, fans and team management alike will be hoping the injury is not serious.Importantly, under cricket’s laws, Stokes is eligible to resume his innings later, should England require him to bat again in their first innings. A similar scenario unfolded earlier in the Test, when India’s Rishabh Pant retired hurt on Day 1 before returning to bat the following day — earning a standing ovation from the Old Trafford crowd.England will now wait and watch over their captain's fitness, with Day 4 set to bring more clarity. For now, the focus shifts to whether Jamie Smith and the rest of the lower order can stretch the lead further, or if Stokes will be needed once again.","Ben Stokes retired hurt on Day 3 of the fourth Test at Old Trafford.

The All India Football Federation may not have found its next head coach yet, but the hiring process has already delivered an unexpected twist in Xavi Hernandez. The iconic Spanish midfielder and former Barcelona manager, was among the 170 applicants for the job.The application, sent from Xavi’s personal email and highlighted in green in the official shortlist, took officials by surprise. “Yes, Xavi’s name was there. The application was emailed to the AIFF,” national team director Subrata Paul told TOI earlier. However, the technical committee did not pursue his candidacy further due to the significant financial implications.Beyond Xavi, the federation received interest from a mix of coaches with some well-known in Indian circles and others with global pedigree. The list included former India coach Stephen Constantine, Slovakia’s Stefan Tarkovic, Liverpool legend Harry Kewell, ex-Blackburn boss Steve Kean, and familiar ISL faces such as Kibu Vicuna, Eelco Schattorie, and Khalid Jamil. Of those, Constantine, Tarkovic, and Jamil have been shortlisted, with Jamil being the lone Indian contender.Xavi’s CV speaks for itself. A product of Barcelona’s famed La Masia academy, he made over 700 appearances for the club, winning eight La Liga titles, four Champions League crowns, and playing a key role in Spain’s World Cup win in 2010 and Euro triumphs in 2008 and 2012.As a coach, he won league titles with both Al Sadd in Qatar and Barcelona, including the 2022–23 La Liga and 2023 Spanish Super Cup before stepping down in 2024.While the AIFF couldn’t afford him, Xavi’s application is seen as a sign of the growing international appeal of Indian football. The final decision now rests with the AIFF executive committee, which will choose from the shortlisted trio of Constantine, Tarkovic, and Jamil.","Xavi Hernandez was among the 170 applicants for the role of India head coach.

NEW DELHI: All India Football Federation (AIFF) president Kalyan Chaubey on Thursday assured franchises, players, coaches and other stakeholders that the Indian Super League (ISL) would take place this season, potentially with a slight delay due to ongoing litigation in the Supreme Court.Chaubey also said that a new head coach for the Indian men’s football team would be named within the next 10 days after the technical committee submits the names of three shortlisted candidates – GreekCypriot Stephen Constantine, Slovakia’s Stefan Tarkovic and home-grown Khalid Jamil – to the AIFF’s executive committee (EC) on Wednesday.“If the league doesn’t take place, not only footballers but the people who are associated with football will be affected. Thousands of people will be affected. So, we will put our best effort to ensure that the league happens,” Chaubey said.Earlier this month, Football Sports Development Limited (FSDL), the body that owns and organises ISL, had written to the AIFF and the clubs stating that the league had been kept on hold.In May, the apex court instructed the AIFF and FSDL not to enter into any negotiations until the final verdict on the AIFF constitution comes.ISL typically runs from Sept to April.“As and when the court’s decision comes, the AIFF will take a call, sit with all the stakeholders and ensure how smoothly these tournaments, including ISL, can be conducted,” Chaubey concluded.","The All India Football Federation (AIFF) president Kalyan Chaubey on Thursday assured franchises, players, coaches and other stakeholders that the Indian Super League (ISL) would take place this season.

The technical committee of the All India Football Federation (AIFF) rubbed their eyes in disbelief when they saw the long list of candidates for the India coaching job.There were the familiar names like former national team coach Stephen Constatine, Liverpool star Harry Kewell, former Blackburn Rovers manager Steve Kean, India’s own Khalid Jamil, and coaches like Kibu Vicuna and Eelco Schattorie, whose work is known in the country. But at the bottom of a list prepared by AIFF’s national team director Subrata Paul, there was Xavi Hernandez.Marked in green, the former Barcelona coach and legend, someone who made more than 700 appearances for the Spanish giants, was shown to have sent the application from his own email ID. Unlike other shortlisted applications, the contact number column was blank.“It’s correct that Xavi’s name was there,” Paul toldon Thursday. “The application was emailed to the AIFF.”According to sources, the technical committee did not consider Xavi for the final shortlist due to the high financial cost. As player, the Spanish midfielder enjoyed a historic career, winning the FIFA World Cup in 2010 and two European championships. With Barcelona, he became the symbol of the club’s possession-based style of football and won 25 trophies, which includes eight La Liga titles and four Champions Leagues.Xavi kickstarted his coaching career with Al Sadd in Qatar, then returned to Barcelona as coach, but left after guiding the club to two trophies in two and a half seasons in charge, including the 2022-23 La Liga title.“Even if Xavi was genuinely interested in Indian football and could be convinced to take up the job, we would need a lot of money,” said a member of the technical committee who attended the virtual meeting on Wednesday.In a previous interview with The Athletic, Xavi said he “sometimes (follows) the Indian League because many Spanish coaches are there.”The technical committee has recommended three names to the AIFF executive committee to replace Manolo Marquez, who quit early this month. Jamil is the lone home-grown coach in the list, which also has Constantine, hoping for a third stint with the national team, and former Kyrgyzstan and Slovakia head coach Stefan Tarkovic.The shortlist was finalised by the technical committee chaired by former India captain IM Vijayan.

PANAJI: The technical committee of the All India Football Federation (AIFF) has recommended Khalid Jamil as its top choice to fill the national coach vacancy, following the resignation of Manolo Marquez.Should Jamil get the nod from the AIFF’s executive committee, he will become the first Indian as full-time coach since Sukhvinder Singh in 2005. Two other Indians – Armando Colaco and Savio Medeira –held interim charges, following the sacking of Bob Houghton in 2011.“We had lot of applications, and after careful scrutiny, the technical committee has recommended three names to the executive committee,” AIFF’s national team director Subrata Paul told TOI after the technical committee meeting on Wednesday. “We believe in the potential of these three coaches. They can take our national team forward.”Stephen Constantine, hoping for a third stint with the national team after winning four trophies in the past, is the second name on the list, while former Slovakia and Kyrgyzstan coach Stefan Tarkovic has also been shortlisted.“All coaches have their own strong points. Khalid has done extremely well in the I-League and Indian Super League (ISL).Constantine knows Indian football inside out and India played well at the Asian Cup in 2019. Tarkovic has a good national team experience, after stints with Slovakia and Kyrgyzstan,” said another official.The technical committee has backed Jamil for the top job, given his record in domestic football. Despite limited resources, the former India midfielder won the I-League with Aizawl FC, scripting one of Indian football’s most remarkable stories in 2017. He then caught everyone’s attention with semifinal spots in the ISL with NorthEast and Jamshedpur FC, a side he continues to coach.“The AIFF will now speak with the coaches and look at their (salary) demands. If Khalid agrees to the terms, he will get the India job,” said another official.Besides the technical committee, Khalid has also got the backing of Dronacharya Award winners, Armando Colaco and Bimal Ghosh, both of whom were consulted as advisors to AIFF president Kalyan Chaubey.According to sources, Constantine too has support within the committee, chaired by former India captain IM Vijayan. India went from 173 to 97 in FIFA rankings between 2015 and 2018 when Constantine was at the helm of affairs.

Poll Will Marcus Rashford thrive at Barcelona? Yes, he will regain his form No, he will struggle

Marcus Rashford has been handed a fresh opportunity to revive his career, joining Barcelona on a season-long loan from Manchester United, the Spanish club confirmed on Wednesday.Once considered one of Europe’s most promising forwards, Rashford has seen his form dip in recent seasons. After falling out of favour at United, the 27-year-old spent the latter half of last season on loan at Aston Villa.At Barcelona, Rashford will be part of a forward line that already includes Lamine Yamal, Brazil’s Raphinha, and veteran striker Robert Lewandowski.Rashford arrived in Barcelona on Sunday to complete the deal. He met his new teammates and reportedly trained with the squad on Tuesday. Financial details of the agreement have not been disclosed, but Spanish media reports suggest the loan includes an option for Barcelona to buy the England international for around €30 million ($35 million).Barcelona had initially targeted Spain forward Nico Williams during the transfer window, but the Athletic Bilbao star signed a long-term extension, opening the door for Rashford’s move.Despite having the most prolific attack in Spain last season, Barcelona were keen to strengthen their frontline. The trio of Yamal, Raphinha, and Lewandowski combined to score 102 goals in the league — 24 more than Real Madrid's tally. They also led the Champions League scoring charts with 43 goals before being eliminated in the semifinals by Inter Milan.Rashford, a product of Manchester United’s academy, made 429 appearances and scored 138 goals, winning five major trophies with the club. However, he only reached the 20-goal mark in three seasons and scored a combined 15 goals in his last two at United. While at Villa, he added another four in 17 games.Despite his recent struggles, Rashford’s talent has rarely been doubted. He recently returned to the England squad under new coach Thomas Tuchel, keeping his hopes alive for a place at next year’s World Cup.","Marcus Rashford has joined Barcelona on a season-long loan from Manchester United.

Poll Do you agree with Crystal Palace's exclusion from the Europa League? Yes, they deserve to be excluded. No, they should be reinstated.

Crystal Palace supporters have staged a bold protest outside UEFA headquarters in Nyon, Switzerland, over the club’s controversial exclusion from the Europa League.Despite earning a spot in the competition by winning the FA Cup last season, Palace were ruled out by UEFA for allegedly breaching regulations related to multi-club ownership. The decision is being contested by the club at the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), with a verdict expected on August 11.If the ruling stands, Nottingham Forest are expected to take Palace’s Europa League spot, with the Eagles moving down to the Europa Conference League.Refusing to stay silent, Palace fans, and the Holmesdale Fanatics in particular, carried out a symbolic protest by delivering a suitcase filled with fake money to UEFA’s lakeside offices. The gesture was meant to highlight what they see as UEFA’s preference for financial interests over fairness.Alongside the suitcase, a letter addressed to UEFA president Aleksander Ceferin was hand-delivered. It demanded the governing body reverse its decision and reinstate Palace in the Europa League.A post from the Holmesdale Fanatics on X reflected the supporters' sentiment and urgency in the appeal to reinstate the club.Part of it read, ""Following this, we then travelled to the CAS headquarters in Lausanne to remind their organisation that this ruling can and should be overturned. The protests against those responsible will continue. REINSTATE PALACE NOW.""The issue stems from American businessman John Textor holding ownership stakes in both Crystal Palace and French club Lyon, which is a situation that UEFA rules prohibit if both clubs qualify for the same competition.The fans' protest reflects growing frustration over what they see as an unfair punishment, and their message is clear: they believe Crystal Palace deserve their place in the Europa League.","Crystal Palace were excluded from the Europa League by UEFA.

Why Formula E deserves to continue



FIA and Formula E comment on agreement extension



In good news for Formula E, a multi-year agreement extension has secured the rights to the FIA Formula E World Championship for an additional 10 years from 2038, when the current agreement ends. This ensures a long and thrilling future for the FIA Formula E World Championship. The long-term extension will enable Formula E to grow further, build strategic long-range partnerships, and drive greater fan engagement.At present, Formula E continues to focus on its phased development strategy for its racing cars — delivering faster top speeds, greater acceleration, enhanced aerodynamics, and improved tyre performance. These developments highlight the series' increased relevance to consumers and the wider EV market, with greater “race to road” technology transfer.With electric vehicle sales projected to rise to over 40% of global vehicle sales by 2030, and global lithium-ion battery production expected to triple by 2030, the relevance of Formula E and its technological advancements is more critical than ever. The Formula E GEN3 Evo already represents a step-change in performance: 0–60 mph in just 1.82 seconds (30% faster than a current Formula 1 car), a 200 mph top speed, and nearly 50% of the energy needed to complete a race regenerated during the event.It is designed with sustainability at its core and includes tyres made with 35% recycled materials and bodywork incorporating recycled carbon fibre and natural fibres.Formula E sees the participation of major automotive manufacturers including Porsche, Jaguar, Nissan, Maserati, Stellantis, Mahindra, and Lola-Yamaha. Since its first race in Beijing in 2014, Formula E has grown by 20% year-on-year, reaching around 400 million fans globally and attracting a television audience of approximately half a billion.The Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA), the global governing body for motorsport and mobility organisations, has announced a multi-year extension to its agreement with Formula E Holdings Limited (majority-owned by Liberty Global).Mohammed Ben Sulayem, President at the FIA, said, “The extension of the agreement governing the FIA Formula E World Championship is a fantastic outcome for the sport and a clear reflection of our ongoing strategy at the FIA to foster long-term stability, innovation, and growth across all areas of motorsport.”He further said, “This milestone reaffirms our commitment to innovation, sustainability, and technological progress, which are all central to the Championship’s unique identity and purpose. It also aligns with our broader goal of increasing global participation and driving more accessible motorsport for all. We are delighted to be continuing this journey with Formula E, and I look forward to seeing it grow even further, both on and off the track, in the years to come. ”FIA Chief Commercial Officer Craig Edmondson, said, “Formula E has not only demonstrated impressive growth since its inception, but has also led the way on sustainable innovation in our industry. This is a landmark agreement for the FIA and Formula E, and we are excited to be working with the Championship in the years to come.”Liberty Global CEO Mike Fries said, “We’ve believed in Formula E since day one, and this extension reaffirms our confidence in where it’s headed. This is the motorsport of the future - a championship that combines the very latest technology, close-combat racing, and a mission that really matters.“With the FIA’s continued backing, we can now take the next big steps - scaling the sport, growing its global fanbase, and continuing to push the boundaries of what electric racing can achieve. With this new agreement in place, Formula E is now positioned better than ever to define the future of motorsport - more innovative, more inclusive, more sustainable - and to inspire the next generation of fans, drivers, and partners around the world. ""Also Read: Formula E London E-Prix 2025: Pascal Wehrlein tops FP1, Jake Dennis finishes second Formula E CEO Jeff Dodds also added, “Formula E’s growth since its inception has been nothing short of extraordinary, with hundreds of millions of fans and world-class teams and drivers deciding to choose highly competitive electric racing. This long-term extension of the partnership enables us to continue building the brand, investing in the product and delivering some of the most captivating racing that has made us famous.

From a mental health perspective, I feel a lot lighter, like a weight has come off my shoulders.

Even now, when I watch the videos back, I struggle to believe it’s actually done!”Oliver Rowland has also made it clear that he has no plans to switch teams or retire after his championship win.“The way I see my career ending is in Formula E — hopefully not too soon.

Obviously, in the race, it was changeable conditions. I think the team really managed the strategy well. I had some problems after the pit stop, which allowed Pascal (Wehrlein) to get closer to me.”""So once it happened, I thought I might have to stop in the race, and I was just kind of like, well, that just sums up my season. Luckily, I was able to juggle both things and bring them home, but it just wasn't expected.

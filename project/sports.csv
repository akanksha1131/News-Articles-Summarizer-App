NEW DELHI: Royal Challengers Bengaluru finally treated their home fans to a victory, defeating Rajasthan Royals by eleven runs in Match forty‑two of the Indian Premier League (IPL) at the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium .Coming into Thursday night, Virat Kohli had four fifties in the campaign. At a fickle Chinnaswamy, he kept stalling in the thirties. That changed in emphatic style as the former skipper produced a 42‑ball 70 that married restraint with sudden violence.After losing yet another toss, RCB were asked to bat, and the first two overs hinted at nerves: Jofra Archer’s 149‑kph bumper flew for four, and Phil Salt survived a sitter in the deep.Kohli first fed on Tushar Deshpande’s gentle pace, stroking two boundaries in the fifth over to ensure the powerplay closed at a healthy 59 without loss.The right‑hander reached fifty in 32 balls, his first home half‑century of the season, by pinging Sandeep Sharma for back‑to‑back fours, a wrists‑whip through mid‑wicket followed by a classical punch past cover.Padikkal’s own 50 from 27 balls kept the pressure on Rajasthan’s bowlers, and late cameos from Tim David (23 off 15) and Jitesh Sharma (20* off 10) converted the solid platform into a final score of 205/5.Rajasthan’s response began explosively. Yashasvi Jaiswal whipped and lofted his way to 49 from 19 balls, dragging the chase to 72/1 after 6 overs. Krunal Pandya’s clever slow‑arm spin nipped out skipper Riyan Parag and Nitish Rana, yet Dhruv Jurel kept the Royals alive with an inventive 47.When Shubham Dubey carved Yash Dayal for two boundaries, the equation fell to 18 required from 12 deliveries, placing the match on a knife‑edge.Enter Hazlewood.The Australian quick had been expensive early, conceding 26 from his first two overs, but his last two overs rewrote the script.In over seventeen he allowed only six runs, leaving himself one over in the bank.He returned for the nineteenth with Rajasthan on 188/7.His final over read: single, dot, wicket, wicket, dot, dot. The first ball, a full‑toss, yielded a scrambled single to long off.The second, a slow bouncer, hurried Jurel. Ball three was a pinpoint yorker that brushed Jurel’s bat on its way to Jitesh Sharma’s gloves.Ball four, a hip‑high cutter, forced a top‑edge from Jofra Archer to cover. Two dots to Wanindu Hasaranga completed an over worth only one run and two wickets.Hazlewood’s spell closed at four overs, thirty‑three runs, four wickets; his final twelve deliveries cost seven.With seventeen still needed, Yash Dayal repeated last season’s heroics, mixing yorkers and slower balls to concede only six in the twentieth.Rajasthan finished on 194/9. Kohli’s calm and Hazlewood’s clutch combined to lift Bengaluru to twelve points and third place, while the Royals stayed marooned in eighth, their playoff hopes fading fast.",Royal Challengers Bengaluru beat Rajasthan Royals by eleven runs. Virat Kohli scored 70 from 42 balls at the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium. Josh Hazlewood took four wickets for Royal Challengers.

During the IPL 2025 clash between Royal Challengers Bengaluru and Rajasthan Royals at the M.

UltraEdge confirmed a clear inside edge, prompting the third umpire to overturn the decision.Interestingly, even before the final verdict came from upstairs, the on-field umpire seemed to realize his error and quickly changed the call to NOT OUT — a rare and amusing moment of instant correction on live TV.

Islamabad United:

New Zealand cricketer Colin Munro on Wednesday has sparked a heated debate in the ongoing Pakistan Super League (PSL).Munro, who is playing for Islamabad United has accused Multan Sultans ' all-rounder Iftikhar Ahmed for chucking.The drama unfolded in the 10th over of the match, when they were cruising to the target of 169 set by the Multan Sultans.Off-spinner Iftikhar Ahmed bowled a faster one in the blockhole and Munro somehow managed to dug it out. Just after the delivery, Munro gestured at the Iftikhar that he was chucking. Munro even bent his elbow while mimicking the action.Munro's gesture riled up the bowler Iftikhar Ahmed, who waked straight to one of the umpires to have a word with them. The entire Multan Sultan team also got involved. The umpires managed to diffuse the situation.Despite all this drama, defending champions Islamabad United continued their winning streak with a fifth consecutive win. Islamabad United chased the 169-run target set by Sultans with 17 balls to spare, banking on opening batter Andries Gous’ 80 not out inclusive of six fours and five maximums.Gous, who faced 45 balls to register his maiden HBL PSL half-century, lost his opening partner Sahibzada Farhan in the third over after the duo had put on 29 runs in pursuit of the target. No.3 batter Colin Munro walked in all guns blazing as he stitched a fiery 81-run partnership for the second wicket off 48 balls.Munro contributed a 28-ball 45 to the cause hitting five fours and two sixes. After Michael Bracewell removed Munro in 11th over, Mohammad Nawaz (21 off 19b, 1x4, 1x6) and Gous steered their team closer to the target with a 55-run third-wicket stand.Earlier, Multan Sultans elected to bat first after winning the toss and their opening batters Mohammad Rizwan (36 off 37b, 3x4s) and Yasir Khan (29 off 17b, 2x4s, 2x6s) put on a solid 51-run stand off 6.4 overs.After Mohammad Nawaz drew the first blood for United dismissing Yasir, Usman Khan walked in and hit the ground running with a 29-ball half-century.

NEW DELHI: Trent Boult ripped the heart out of Sunrisers Hyderabad , and Rohit Sharma applied the fine gloss as Mumbai Indians cantered to a seven‑wicket win with 26 balls to spare at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium, Hyderabad on Wednesday night.The result lifts MI back into the top four and leaves a shell‑shocked SRH clinging to mathematical hopes in IPL 2025 .Given first use of a hard, straw‑coloured surface, Boult unleashed a left‑arm master‑class: late inswing with the new ball, followed by the trademark wobble‑seam away‑goer.Travis Head flirted fatally at the first wide one he saw; Abhishek Sharma and Nitish Reddy followed in mirror‑image dismissals, fenced to ring fielders stationed precisely for the miscued poke.Boult’s opening burst read 2-0-8-2; he returned at the death to york Abhinav Manohar and finish with 4/26, reminding the league that the 35‑year‑old’s power‑play strike rate (one wicket every 12 balls this season) is still elite.While Boult scythed through the top, Deepak Chahar (2/12) and Hardik Pandya ’s short‑ball plan accounted for the middle, reducing SRH to a dire 35/5.Only Heinrich Klaasen ’s defiant 71 (44 balls) prevented a rout, his 99‑run stand with Manohar dragging the visitors to 143/8 -- ten short of par on this ground.Rohit Sharma combined trademark pick‑up pulls with a freshly honed shuffle across off stump that neutered Pat Cummins’s angle.He raced to fifty real quick and looked set for a hundred until Zeeshan Ansari’s skidder kissed the inside edge on 70 (46 balls, 8 fours, 3 sixes).Rohit’s tempo allowed Suryakumar Yadav (40 not out off 19) the freedom to unveil his trademark ramps and whip MI home in the 16th over, finishing the chase at 146/3.",Mumbai Indians beat Sunrisers Hyderabad by seven wickets.

NEW DELHI: Drama erupted in the third over of the Sunrisers Hyderabad–Mumbai Indians IPL clash when Ishan Kishan ’s dismissal triggered an unusual chain of events and a flood of online reaction.Facing Deepak Chahar , Kishan appeared to feather a leg‑side delivery to wicketkeeper Ryan Rickelton.The on‑field umpire hesitated, then raised the finger.Kishan did not consult with his partner; convinced he was out, he walked. Mumbai offered only a muted appeal, yet the umpire’s decision stood.Moments later, the replay package told a different story: Snicko registered no spike, suggesting there was no contact between bat and ball. Social media lit up.Former India batter Navjot Singh Sidhu wrote, “Buying trouble is as easy as pie, but the carrying charges are high—ever seen an umpire give one without an appeal?”Commentator Harsha Bhogle admitted the sequence left him “perplexed.”Kishan’s exit for one run left Sunrisers tottering at 9/2 after 2.1 overs, part of an early collapse that saw them slump to 35/5.Trent Boult (4/26) and Deepak Chahar (2/12) shared the damage before Heinrich Klaasen and Abhinav Manohar rescued the innings.Their 99‑run stand lifted SRH to 143 for eight, with Klaasen cracking 71 from 44 and Manohar 43 from 27. Klaasen’s dismissal gave Jasprit Bumrah his 300th wicket in senior T20 cricket.The match began with both teams wearing black armbands to honour victims of the Pahalgam terror attack.Mumbai captain Hardik Pandya chose to bowl after winning the toss, and Boult struck first by removing Travis Head for a duck. Abhishek Sharma, Nitish Kumar Reddy and Aniket Verma followed quickly.Klaasen counter‑punched, reaching fifty in 34 balls and accelerating in the final five overs, which yielded 53 runs.Boult cleaned up Pat Cummins with the last ball to close the innings.","Ishan Kishan dismissed in third over of Sunrisers Hyderabad–Mumbai Indians IPL clash.

Poll Which factor do you think plays a more significant role in a team's success in IPL? Individual Player Performance and Skills Team Strategy and Planning

In an unusual incident during Wednesday's IPL match between Sunrisers Hyderabad and Mumbai Indians , SRH wicketkeeper-batter Ishan Kishan walked off after a delivery from Deepak Chahar despite no apparent contact between bat and ball, leading to his dismissal amid their batting collapse in Hyderabad.The left-handed Kishan, who had just scored his first run in the previous over, attempted to play a delivery from Chahar that was drifting down the leg side.MI wicketkeeper Ryan Rickelton collected the ball, but neither he nor the bowler appealed for a caught behind. On-field umpire Vinod Seshan was about to signal a wide.Unexpectedly, Kishan walked away, indicating he had edged the ball to the keeper, prompting Seshan to raise his finger for the dismissal.MI captain Hardik Pandya, who had made a half-hearted appeal, appreciated Kishan's gesture by patting him on his helmet and shoulders.Replay analysis revealed no contact between bat and ball, with UltraEdge showing no spike as the ball passed the left-hander's bat.While batters typically know when they've edged the ball, the decision was particularly significant given SRH's ninth position on the points table and the favorable batting conditions. Kishan's dismissal left SRH struggling at 9/2 in the third over.""You think you have seen it all after all these years and yet I must admit the Ishan Kishan's dismissal leaves me perplexed,"" commented Harsha Bhogle on X, expressing his surprise at the incident.","SRH wicketkeeper-batter Ishan Kishan walked off after a delivery from Deepak Chahar despite no apparent contact between bat and ball.

He may have glared at Nehal Wadhera after running him out for five during Royal Challengers Bengaluru ’s seven-wicket win over Punjab Kings at the Mullanpur Stadium on April 20, but Virat Kohli did offer a few encouraging words to the Punjab youngster a couple of days earlier.In fact, it was a surreal moment for Wadhera when he found out that the cricketing superstar knew him by his first name. In an ice-breaking interaction that Wadhera had with Kohli, the Punjab Kings batter approached the legend to seek feedback on his game after an IPL match in Bengaluru on April 18—and was left stunned when Kohli recognized him by name.Recalling his “made-my-day” moment during a virtual media interaction on Thursday, Wadhera said: “I was actually really shocked. Before the match, Virat bhai was talking to Shreyas Iyer and asked me in Punjabi, ‘Ki haal chaal, Nehal?’ (How are you, Nehal?). I wasn’t expecting him to remember my name. That made me really happy.”It had long been a dream of Wadhera’s to speak with Kohli—something he’d often mentioned during his time with Mumbai Indians. “Till last year, I used to tell Tilak (Varma) or Surya bhai (Suryakumar Yadav) that I wanted to talk to Virat bhai once. That was the real ice-breaker—realising that he actually knows me—and it gave me the confidence to speak to him.”After the match, Wadhera approached Kohli for feedback. “As soon as the match got over, I asked, ‘Virat bhai, you’ve seen me for the past two years. Do you see any improvement in my game?’ He said, ‘Nehal, I liked your batting.’ I explained my game plan, and he said my approach was smart, especially in a low-scoring game.He told me he saw composure and intent in my shots.” Needless to say, praise from a cricketing legend had a huge impact. “He was happy to see my preparation and execution. I was just as happy to receive such feedback from someone like him.”Wadhera also acknowledged the mentorship of India’s 2011 World Cup hero, Yuvraj Singh . “His words were golden. He gave me tips on how to take my game to the next level. I have huge respect for him.” In seven matches this IPL, Wadhera has scored 189 runs at an average of 37.80 and a strike rate of 146.51.His unbeaten 43 off 25 balls helped Punjab Kings chase down 172 against Lucknow Super Giants, and in a rain-affected 14-over match against RCB, his 19-ball 33* helped the team recover from 53 for four to seal a tricky 96-run chase. “I love playing in tough situations. I believe if you can win those, you’re ready for India,” he said.","Nehal Wadhera was left stunned when Virat Kohli recognized him by name.

It was just after the 2018 IPL auction that CSK, returning from their two-year ban, had assembled the proverbial ‘dad’s army’, ignoring the then U-19 world champions Shubman Gill, Prithvi Shaw, Riyan Parag and Abhishek Sharma, among a few others.“Isn’t it a recipe for disaster to go with so many over-30s?” When the question was posed to N Srinivasan during an informal conversation, the team owner had smiled and said, “Dhoni believes there’s no substitute for experience in the IPL. You’ll see what this team does.” Dhoni kept his word.Over the next six years, CSK won three titles, with the ‘golden oldies’ forming the core of the team. By 2024, though, the cracks in the theory had started arising. By 2025, they had taken the shape of craters. Last year, CSK missed the playoffs by a whisker, but this time around, the door has been all but closed by the midway stage, with some of the seniors in the team being in woeful form.CSK now need to win their last six matches, starting with a game against fellow strugglers Sunrisers Hyderabad on Friday at the MA Chidambaram Stadium, and hope that teams which are far ahead of them on the table start faltering badly. But the disaster in the CSK ranks has sparked a mini-revolution.Teenage bench-warmers, who are normally used to fill the numbers for in-house practice games, are now starting XI players. Against Mumbai Indians on Sunday, CSK had 20-year-old Shaik Rasheed opening the batting while 17-year-old Ayush Mhatre, who was brought in two days earlier, was batting at No. 3.In fact, during the course of the nine-wicket humiliation, the Rasheed-Mhatre partnership of 41 seemed a bright spot. While the inclusion of these two was necessitated by the injury to Ruturaj Gaikwad and the poor form of Rahul Tripathi , CSK have a few other ‘kids’ lined up.South Africa’s 21-year-old Dewald Brevis, who went unsold in the auction, has been drafted in and could be one of the options going forward. Senior player Vijay Shankar has been a disaster and he, too, should make way for one of the talented youngsters Vansh Bedi or Andre Siddarth in the middle-order.And just to add meat to the youngster narrative, Afghanistan’s 20-year-old left-arm wrist-spinner Noor Ahmad, with 12 wickets, has been the stand-out bowler. While CSK finally seem to have woken up, have they already missed the bus? Coach Stephen Fleming , taking the contrary view, said that among the top-20 IPL batters this year, only one was a youngster.He was probably referring to Punjab Kings’s Priyansh Arya. “We understand the importance of youth. It’s not that we’ve neglected it, but we believe players with experience navigate the difficult situations in the IPL better,” Fleming said. The coach added that most of the young guns will be tested out to build a strong core for next year.","Chennai Super Kings need to win their last six matches to stay in the IPL.

NEW DELHI: Josh Hazlewood delivered a stunning penultimate over to secure Royal Challengers Bengaluru ’s (RCB) first home win of IPL 2025 , guiding them to an 11-run victory over Rajasthan Royals (RR) in a thrilling contest at the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium on Thursday. The defeat officially knocked RR out of playoff contention, with seven losses from nine matches.Needing 18 runs from the last 12 balls, RR were halted in their tracks by Hazlewood, who conceded just one run while picking up two wickets in consecutive deliveries, finishing with figures of 4/33. His clutch performance overshadowed a brilliant 49 off 19 balls from Yashasvi Jaiswal and a gritty 47 off 34 by Dhruv Jurel.Earlier, RCB's batting was anchored by star duo Virat Kohli (70 off 42) and Devdutt Padikkal (50 off 27), who added 95 runs for the second wicket. Tim David (23 off 15) and Jitesh Sharma (20* off 10) provided the finishing flourish, helping RCB post an imposing 205/5 — their highest total at home this season.RR began their chase in explosive fashion. Jaiswal, who opened with a six off Bhuvneshwar Kumar, tormented Hazlewood with five boundaries and a six. Partnered by 14-year-old impact player Vaibhav Suryavanshi (16), RR raced to 52 in under five overs before the teenager fell to a knuckle ball from Bhuvneshwar.Jaiswal looked unstoppable but Hazlewood got his revenge by dismissing him with a short delivery that was skied to mid-wicket. Despite reaching 72/2 in the Powerplay, RR’s momentum faltered. Riyan Parag (22 off 10), standing in as captain for the injured Sanju Samson, played a brief cameo but was dismissed by Krunal Pandya alongside Nitish Rana (28 off 22), further derailing the chase.Shimron Hetmyer’s dismissal to Hazlewood marked a turning point as RCB took control.Earlier in the match, Phil Salt (26) and Kohli gave RCB a steady start despite a dropped catch by Parag. Kohli’s fifth half-century of the season — and his first at home — came off 32 balls and was punctuated by elegant strokeplay.Padikkal joined the party, smashing three sixes in the 15th over off Tushar Deshpande, propelling RCB past 200.With the win, RCB leapfrogged into third place on the points table, strengthening their playoff bid, while RR's campaign ended in heartbreak.",Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) secure first home win of IPL 2025.

Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) continued their impressive surge in the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2025 season with a thrilling 11-run victory over Rajasthan Royals (RR) at the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bengaluru on Thursday. The hard-fought win not only kept their winning momentum intact but also propelled them to third place on the points table , putting them in a strong position as the playoff race intensifies.With this win, RCB now have 12 points from 9 matches, sitting just behind Gujarat Titans (GT) and Delhi Capitals (DC) — both of whom also have 12 points but boast superior net run rates. Gujarat Titans remain at the top of the table with a strong +1.104 NRR, followed by DC at +0.657.RCB’s net run rate of +0.482 puts them narrowly behind the top two, yet comfortably ahead of the rest.Mumbai Indians (MI), despite suffering a few stumbles, stay in the hunt with 10 points from 9 matches and an impressive NRR of +0.673, giving them a slight edge over Punjab Kings (PBKS) and Lucknow Super Giants (LSG), who are also on 10 points each but with lower NRRs.Punjab Kings, with +0.177, occupy fifth place while LSG, due to their negative NRR of -0.054, sit sixth. These middle-table teams are locked in a close battle and will need consistent performances to break into the top four.Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) are struggling to stay relevant in the playoff race, with just 6 points from 8 matches, and a relatively healthy NRR of +0.212 — a glimmer of hope if they can string together a winning streak in the remaining fixtures.Rajasthan Royals, following their narrow defeat to RCB, continue their dismal run and now sit eighth with just 2 wins from 9 games. Their net run rate of -0.625 further dampens their playoff chances.Meanwhile, Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) and Chennai Super Kings (CSK) are in dire straits at the bottom of the table, both having won only 2 of their 8 matches.Their heavily negative NRRs of -1.361 and -1.392, respectively, mean they not only need to win but do so emphatically to have any chance of climbing up.","Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) continued their impressive surge in the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2025 season with a thrilling 11-run victory over Rajasthan Royals.

Shah Rukh Khan: The superstar who turned IPL into a blockbuster

Leicester City captain Jamie Vardy will part ways with the club at the end of the season, bringing the curtain down on a legendary spell that spanned over a decade. The club, relegated from the Premier League this year, confirmed the news on Thursday.Vardy, who famously led Leicester’s fairytale 2015/16 title-winning campaign, has been described by the club as ""our greatest-ever player.""Signed from non-league Fleetwood Town for just £1 million in 2012, Vardy went on to score 198 goals in nearly 500 appearances, becoming Leicester’s all-time top scorer in the Premier League with 143 goals. His remarkable tally of 24 goals in the 2015/16 season played a pivotal role in the Foxes’ historic title triumph.The 38-year-old also featured in Leicester's 2021 FA Cup final win over Chelsea, further cementing his status as a club legend.""We can confirm legendary striker Jamie Vardy will leave Leicester City this summer after 13 seasons that have seen him become our greatest-ever player,"" read the club's statement.""Jamie is unique,"" said chairman Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha. ""He is a special player and an even more special person. He holds a place in the hearts of everyone connected to Leicester City, and he certainly has my deepest respect and affection. I am endlessly grateful for everything he has given to this football club.""Vardy admitted he was heartbroken by the decision but acknowledged the time was right.""To the fans of Leicester, I'm gutted that this day is coming, but I knew it was going to come eventually,"" he said in a video posted on social media. ""I've spent 13 unbelievable years at this club, with lots of success, and some downs, but the majority have all been highs.""Vardy, the last remaining player from the 2016 title-winning squad, stayed with Leicester after their 2023 relegation and helped them earn promotion back to the Premier League. However, the club now faces a return to the Championship after another poor campaign.In 31 league appearances this season, Vardy scored seven goals. After relegation was confirmed following a 1-0 defeat to Liverpool, he offered a brutally honest verdict on the season.""This season has been nothing but miserable and for me personally, a total embarrassment,"" he wrote on social media. ""It hurts.""With Ruud van Nistelrooy’s side languishing in 19th place with 18 points from 33 games, Vardy's final appearance at the King Power Stadium is set for May 18 against Ipswich Town — who are also on the brink of relegation.","Jamie Vardy will leave Leicester City at the end of the season.

CHENNAI: After a nightmarish Indian Super League campaign, where they did not even come close to qualifying for the playoffs, Chennaiyin FC will be eager to salvage some pride in the Super Cup in Bhubaneswar. Chennaiyin will begin their run with a challenging round-of-16 fixture against ISL big gun Mumbai City FC on Wednesday.The knockout tournament offers CFC another opportunity to end a long wait – while Chennaiyin have not won silverware since their 2017-18 ISL triumph, they have not been at the continental level since the 2018-19 season. For CFC to pose a threat, they will have to stay “consistent”, a quality that head coach Owen Coyle believes they lacked in the ISL.“When we are at our best, we can stand toe-to-toe with the best teams. The cup competition is a great opportunity for everybody, because there is an AFC spot up for grabs. There is an incentive for everyone to go and win the cup,” Coyle said.“We started the ISL season well and finished strongly. We had a poor middle section of the season. For sure, there is added motivation to finish the season on a high. We were very inconsistent in the ISL; that is what cost us a place in the top-six. We have to get back to giving good performances consistently,” added Coyle.Chennaiyin should show drastic improvement in the defensive department, after keeping only four clean sheets in the league stage of the ISL. The luxury to use both Ryan Edwards and Elsinho at the heart of defence at the same time – a club can field a maximum of six foreigners – could solve some issues for the chief coach.Coyle acknowledged that there is a huge scope for improvement in defence but stressed that the team would not get into a shell for the sake of a clean sheet. “That (poor defending) was the biggest thing that hurt us in the ISL; we did not defend well enough. But in cup competitions, you have to win games. We will certainly not be seeing a more defensive approach; we will see a team going out to win games,” said Coyle.What should give CFC a bit of hope for Wednesday’s game is the fact that Mumbai could miss a few key players due to different reasons (injuries, rehabilitation and personal situation). While Jon Toral and Jayesh Rane have been ruled out of the tournament, Yoell van Nieff, Jeremy Manzorro and Prabir Das are doubtful starters for the clash on Wednesday.Asked if CFC will have the upper hand, Coyle replied: “We are under no illusion; Mumbai are a wonderful side. Van Nieff and Manzorro could probably make it to the game. They have many good Indian players like Lallianzuala Chhangte, Vikram Pratap Singh and Mehtab Singh who add to the mix.”",Chennaiyin FC face Mumbai City FC in the Indian Super League (ISL) Super Cup.

IF ARSENAL WIN:

Liverpool are on the verge of securing their second Premier League title, needing just three points from their remaining five matches to become champions. Arsenal's victory over Ipswich Town has pushed the earliest possible title confirmation date to Wednesday (April 23), when Arsenal face Crystal Palace.Liverpool currently sit at the top of the Premier League table with 79 points after 33 games played, holding a commanding 13-point lead over second-placed Arsenal, who have 66 points.The Reds require only three points from their available 15 to mathematically secure their 20th overall league title. Even if Arsenal win all their remaining matches, they can only reach 81 points, while Liverpool would have 82 points with just one more victory.The title race could be decided as early as Wednesday if Arsenal lose to Crystal Palace at home. In this scenario, Arsenal would remain on 66 points with only 12 points left to play for, making it mathematically impossible to catch Liverpool.Should Arsenal defeat Crystal Palace, Liverpool could still clinch the title on Sunday (April 27), with a victory over Tottenham Hotspur at Anfield. This would put Arne Slot's team 13 points ahead with only four matches remaining.The current Premier League standings show Liverpool in first place with 79 points and a goal difference of +44, while Arsenal occupy second position with 66 points and a +34 goal difference. Third place follows with 60 points and a +14 goal difference.Arsenal's win at Ipswich Town on Sunday eliminated the possibility of Liverpool securing the title that day, shifting the focus to the upcoming midweek fixtures as the next potential title-deciding moment.The title race has now entered its final phase with just five weekends of action remaining in the 2024/25 Premier League season. Both teams have challenging fixtures ahead as they navigate through the closing stages of the campaign.This upcoming period will determine whether Liverpool can maintain their substantial lead and secure their second Premier League title, or if Arsenal can mount an unlikely late challenge in the remaining matches.","Liverpool currently sit at the top of the Premier League table with 79 points after 33 games played.

Trent Alexander-Arnold fired Liverpool to the brink of the Premier League title as his late strike sealed a 1-0 win that relegated Leicester after Arsenal's 4-0 rout of Ipswich delayed the leaders' coronation on Sunday.Arne Slot's side could have clinched a record-equalling 20th English title with a combination of an Arsenal loss and a victory at the King Power Stadium.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW! Liverpool fulfilled their half of the equation, but second-placed Arsenal were not so obliging earlier in the afternoon.The Gunners' stroll at Portman Road meant Liverpool kicked off still needing six points from their last six games to seal a first title since 2020.Thanks to Alexander-Arnold's match-winning contribution after coming off the bench, Liverpool are 13 points clear of Arsenal with five games left for both teams.The Reds will seal the title if Arsenal lose at home to Crystal Palace on Wednesday or if they beat Tottenham at Anfield on April 27.It looked like being a frustrating day for Liverpool as second-bottom Leicester kept them at bay despite a host of chances for the visitors.Slot's men finally made the breakthrough in the 76th minute when Alexander-Arnold lashed home the rebound from close-range after Mohamed Salah and Diogo Jota both hit the crossbar.With speculation mounting that Alexander-Arnold will join Real Madrid when his contract expires at the end of the season, it was notable that the England right-back embarked on a wild celebration of his winner.Alexander-Arnold earned a booking for ripping off his shirt and planting it on the corner flag after he sprinted to 3,000 jubilant Liverpool fans in one corner of the King Power.""It took us a long time and, of course, a great moment for Trent after working so hard to come back. To score the goal that makes a lot of difference is very special,"" Slot said.""It's never hard to dream (of the title) but you see we are really focused on playing Tottenham.""Liverpool's title celebration is only a matter of time but Leicester will spend next season in the Championship after their woeful one-year stay in the top tier came to an end with a 23rd defeat in 33 league games.Fresh from a famous victory over Real Madrid on Wednesday to reach the Champions League semi-finals for the first time since 2009, Arsenal ensured Liverpool would not be able to start their party this weekend.Mikel Arteta made only three changes from the 2-1 win in the Spanish capital and was rewarded with a dominant display to kill the game off inside half an hour.""All we can do is delay that moment (Liverpool win the league) from our side to earn the right to finish as high as possible,"" Arteta said.Leandro Trossard was one of those recalled by Arteta and prodded in his eighth goal of the season to open the scoring.A flowing move saw Bukayo Saka's cross flicked by Mikel Merino into the path of Gabriel Martinelli to finish to double the Gunners lead.Moments later, Saka was chopped down by an awful challenge from Leif Davis that saw the Ipswich left-back shown a straight red card.Trossard fired in his second after a well-worked corner before Ethan Nwaneri's deflected effort rounded off the scoring.Defeat realistically ends third-bottom Ipswich's hope of maintaining their Premier League status as they are 15 points adrift of safety with five games remaining and have a significantly poorer goal difference than West Ham.Chelsea needed two late goals at Fulham to revive their chances of Champions League football next season with a dramatic 2-1 victory.Alex Iwobi opened the scoring on 20 minutes and Chelsea were meandering towards a damaging defeat until 19-year-old substitute Tyrique George fired in a snap shot from the edge of the box on 83 minutes.Pedro Neto then completed the comeback with a stunning strike in stoppage-time to secure Chelsea's sixth win in their last 17 league games.Fifth-placed Chelsea moved above Nottingham Forest, who travel to Tottenham on Monday.

Three games at home, two away and hopefully we can achieve this big success to qualify for the Champions League.""Relegated Southampton rescued a 1-1 draw at West Ham to guarantee they won't have the indignity of being the lone club with the Premier League's worst ever points tally.Jarrod Bowen struck for the Hammers in the 47th minute, holding off Ryan Manning before lashing a fierce finish past Aaron Ramsdale.But Lesley Ugochukwu equalised three minutes into second half stoppage-time as he lashed past Alphonse Areola.Bottom of the table Southampton are now on 11 points -- the same number Derby managed in 2007-08 -- and have five games left to leave the Rams with the lowest total ever recorded in the Premier League.Brentford beat 10-man Brighton 4-2 to damage the Seagulls' prospects of qualifying for Europe with their first home win since December.Thomas Frank's side took a ninth minute lead when Lewis Keane-Potter's precise pass through the heart of the Brighton defence picked out Bryan Mbeumo and he confidently slotted homeDanny Welbeck hauled Brighton level in first half stoppage-time with a powerful header from Mats Wieffer's cross.Mbeumo restored Brentford's advantage three minutes after half-time, his strike taking a hefty deflection off Brighton defender Lewis Dunk on its way past Bart Verbruggen.Yoane Wissa bagged Brentford's third in the 58th minute, running onto Mbeumo's pass and finishing with the help of a deflection off Jan Paul van Hecke.Brighton striker Joao Pedro was sent off in the 61st minute for a needless kick at Nathan Collins.Japan forward Kaoru Mitoma reduced the deficit in the 81st minute, but Christian Norgaard headed home in stoppage-time to end Brighton's hopes of a late escape.Crystal Palace held on for a 0-0 draw against Bournemouth despite playing half the match with 10 men.Palace were reduced to 10 men just before half-time at Selhurst Park when Chris Richards was sent off for a second booking after the defender fouled Justin Kluivert.Third-placed Newcastle will look to step up their Champions League qualification surge when they travel to Aston Villa in Saturday's late game.",Manchester City beat Everton 2-0 in English Premier League.

Barcelona staged a remarkable comeback to defeat Celta Vigo 4-3 at home on Saturday, extending their La Liga lead to seven points over Real Madrid. After trailing 3-1 with less than 30 minutes remaining, Barcelona's Dani Olmo and Raphinha , who scored twice including a 98th-minute penalty, secured the crucial victory.Barcelona took an early lead through Ferran Torres in the 12th minute, who scored from the edge of the box after finding space in Celta's defence.Celta Vigo responded quickly, with Borja Iglesias equalising three minutes later. Pablo Duran's cross found Iglesias, who scored into an empty net after goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny failed to intercept.Barcelona's attempts to regain the lead saw Raphinha sending a free-kick over the bar and Robert Lewandowski missing the target. Szczesny made important saves from Ilaix Moriba and Iker Losada at the other end.Iglesias put Celta ahead early in the second half, capitalizing on Frenkie de Jong's error to score past Szczesny. He later completed his hat-trick after being set up by Sergio Carreira, taking advantage of Barcelona's high defensive line.""This is football, we really wanted to win, maybe we weren't at our best but the response from the team, and the fans pushed us on... we deserved it,"" Olmo told DAZN. ""These are three points that take us closer to our objective, they're important and we have to continue.""Barcelona coach Hansi Flick had initially rested 17-year-old Lamine Yamal for the first time in 2025 but brought him on after Iglesias' third goal.The comeback began when Raphinha assisted Olmo, who beat goalkeeper Vicente Guaita. Raphinha then scored himself, heading in Yamal's cross from the right.Celta missed a chance to secure the win when Oscar Mingueza headed wide from close range in the 90th minute.The decisive moment came in the 96th minute when VAR review led to a penalty after Yoel Lago fouled Olmo. With Lewandowski substituted, Raphinha converted the spot-kick into the top-right corner.""It's a bittersweet feeling... we scored three, which few teams can do here, but it feels bad,"" said Celta's Duran. ""We have to be proud of our team, we came here with personality, played well, had a good plan and carried it out -- but for small details it got away from us.""The victory maintains Barcelona's strong position in the title race, with Real Madrid set to face Athletic Bilbao on Sunday and a Clasico matchup scheduled for May.Celta Vigo, currently seventh in La Liga and competing for European qualification, showed attacking prowess throughout the match despite the eventual defeat.","Barcelona come from behind to defeat Celta Vigo 4-3 in La Liga.

Manchester, Apr 18, 2025 -Manchester United came from 4-2 down in extra-time to beat Lyon 5-4 in a remarkable Europa League quarter-final to progress 7-6 on aggregate on Thursday.United's season looked over when Lyon came from 2-0 down to lead by two goals with just six minutes remaining at Old Trafford despite having captain Corentin Tolisso sent off.However, a Bruno Fernandes ' penalty, Kobbie Mainoo's strike and Harry Maguire's header capped a stunning finale to set up a semi-final meeting with Athletic Bilbao.""I felt that here everything is possible,"" said United boss Ruben Amorim . ""After the 4-3, the penalty from Bruno, you feel that you can change the game.""The Red Devils sit 14th in the English top flight and defeat would have almost certainly meant missing out on European football entirely next season.Instead they are just three games away from a European trophy and the lifeline of direct access to the riches of the Champions League next season.""Everybody in this moment believes it is possible,"" added Amorim.""One moment can change a lot of things in the players' minds.""United's history is built on dramatic late fightbacks, but few have been more remarkable than this to leave Lyon shellshocked.The home side got off to a flying start thanks to a fine team goal as Fernandes released Alejandro Garnacho down the right and his cross picked out Ugarte to slot in just his second goal since joining the English giants from Paris Saint-Germain.Amorim's decision to restore Andre Onana in goal was under scrutiny.The Cameroonian had been dropped for Sunday's 4-1 thrashing at Newcastle after two costly errors that led to both Lyon's goals in last week's 2-2 first leg draw.Those mistakes came after a war of words with former United midfielder Nemanja Matic, who labelled him ""one of the worst goalkeepers in United's history"".The 29-year-old rewarded his manager's faith with a couple of important stops to prevent Lyon levelling through Paul Akouokou and Rayan Cherki.At the other end, a United side that have often looked laboured and lacking in ideas all season, suddenly clicked into gear in the first 45 minutes.United doubled their lead in first-half stoppage time when Maguire's long ball was expertly controlled by Diogo Dalot, who then fired in off the inside of the post.Garnacho should have killed the tie off within minutes of the restart for the second half when he shot straight at Lucas Perri with Fernandes begging for a pass for a tap in.But the defensive deficiencies and mental fragility of Amorim's side were exposed in a collapse that threatened to cap a miserable campaign.Alexandre Lacazette flicked on Moussa Niakhate's header and Corentin Tolisso swooped to head in and give the visitors a lifeline.Nicolas Tagliafico then prodded in at the back post despite Onana's attempt to scoop it off the line.Just as Lyon were in the ascendency Tolisso gave them a mountain to climb again with a soft second yellow for a trip on Casemiro.Yet, it did not initially matter as Cherki confirmed his status as one of Europe's rising stars with a powerful drive that left Onana motionless.Lyon's other prized asset, Malick Fofana, was then chopped down by Luke Shaw inside the area and Lacazette confidently dispatched the resulting spot-kick.Another penalty at the other end, though, kickstarted the fightback as Fernandes fired home after a VAR review for a foul on Casemiro.Substitute Mainoo showed why he had been thrust in an unfamiliar forward role with a composed finish to level on 120 minutes.Barely 60 seconds later Maguire completed the comeback with a towering header at the back post.""In this moment it is difficult to believe what has just happened,"" said Lyon coach Paulo Fonseca.It is the first time ever in European competition that five goals have been scored in extra-time.",Manchester United came from 4-2 down in extra-time to beat Lyon 5-4 in a remarkable Europa League quarter-final to progress 7-6 on aggregate.

Formula E driver Norman Nato is back from Italy after participating in the World Endurance Championship . He took part in the 6 Hours of Imola race, where he finished in tenth position while driving for Hertz Team Jota . After the Sunday race, he penned a note reflecting on his experience in Imola. He also shared a series of candid pictures from the track, including some behind-the-scenes moments — one of which resembled a recent post by F1 driver Alex Albon.Taking to Instagram, Norman Nato posted a few pictures from Italy and wrote a caption summarizing his experience at the 6 Hours of Imola. He wrote: “Difficult weekend in Imola with P10 in race. Still early process with our new team, we keep learning. As always after a difficult one, we gonna analyse and make progress to come back stronger for the next one in Spa @cadillacvseries @jota_sport.”Encouraging him, Cadillac’s official Instagram page commented: “Building and growing,” along with clapping emojis. A person he apparently met in Imola responded to the post: “What a weekend, still enjoyed it a lot! Thanks for taking so much time to chat, greatly appreciate it!”Fans also chimed in with their support: “It'll be much better in Spa, keep pushing,” said one. Another wrote, “Superbe mon Nono,” praising his efforts. One quirky comment read: “Waiting for Norman to play padel with Max & Charles,” along with tennis, racing car and hour glass emojis.In another light-hearted moment on Instagram, Norman shared a selfie taken by one of his teammates on his phone, captioned: “When you leave your phone in the garage while driving.” It echoed a recent post by Formula 1 driver Alex Albon, who had shared selfies taken on his phone after accidentally leaving it behind at a press conference.Also Read: Formula E Drivers Norman Nato and Nyck De Vries compete in FIA World Endurance Championship: Here's how they qualified for 6 Hours of Imola Currently, Norman is recuperating in Andorra, Western Europe.

With five rounds now complete in the 2024–25 Formula E World Championship, there are still 11 races to go before the season concludes in July. In Miami, it was Tag Heuer Porsche’s Pascal Wehrlein who took the top podium spot.

Rowland had a tough outing in Miami, finishing 10th and earning just one point. But his overall journey this season has been inspiring—starting the Sao Paulo E-Prix in December with zero points, he bounced back impressively. He clinched victory in the Mexico E-Prix (25 points), finished second in Jeddah Part 1 (18 points), and won Jeddah Part 2 (25 points). Thanks to this strong mid-season performance, his lacklustre Miami result hasn’t dented his lead.In second place is Tag Heuer Porsche’s Antonio Felix da Costa with 54 points. He finished runner-up in both the Sao Paulo and Mexico E-Prix races. While his performance dipped in the Jeddah double-header, he recovered well by finishing third in Miami and collecting 15 crucial points.Close behind is his teammate, Pascal Wehrlein, with 51 points. Wehrlein had a disappointing start in Sao Paulo but bounced back with a third-place finish in Mexico. Although his results in Jeddah were average, his win in Miami has significantly boosted his title hopes.

He impressed with a third-place finish in Sao Paulo and podiums in both Jeddah races—third in Part 1 and second in Part 2.

Miami E-Prix

Formula E drivers Norman Nato and Nyck De Vries are currently in Italy for the second round of the 2025 FIA World Endurance Championship (WEC).

Nato finished 9th, while De Vries secured 5th place in the session.Norman Nato, who races for Nissan in the Formula E Championship, represents Cadillac Racing in collaboration with Hertz Team Jota in the Hypercar category of the Endurance Championship. Nyck De Vries, from Mahindra Racing’s Formula E team, finished 5th in the Imola qualifying. He competes for Toyota Gazoo Racing in the WEC, alongside teammate Ryo Hirakawa, who placed 4th in qualifying.Calling it his best effort on track, De Vries told Toyota Europe Newsroom: “As a team, I think we can be fairly satisfied with qualifying fourth and fifth here. We maximised our package, as you can see from the tiny gap between the two cars. I don’t think we could have done much better than that; we did a strong job to execute a clean qualifying. The gap to the front cars looks quite big over one lap, but we will do our best with race pace, tyre management, and strategy to challenge for the podium.”Both drivers are now set to compete in the final race of the 6 Hours of Imola on Sunday, scheduled from 1 PM to 7 PM local time.In their last Formula E outing at the Homestead-Miami Speedway, Nato faced heartbreak after losing what looked like a sure win due to post-race penalties. Although he clinched pole and crossed the line first at the Miami E-Prix, he was relegated to 6th place in the revised results.De Vries had qualified 5th in Miami but ultimately dropped to 11th in the final standings after penalties were applied.Following this, they’ll shift focus to Round 6 of the Formula E World Championship—the highly anticipated Monaco double-header on May 3 and 4.

His last podium came in Season 9, when he was part of Mahindra Racing.The 40-year-old shared his journey to the podium after the win. He said, “It’s very hard to start the project from zero so in the four races, I had four critical problems that pretty much didn’t allow me to finish the race. So I was like, it’s extremely (tough), you need to have a lot of discipline to be able to continue the work and continue to push when you have bad results.”“When you have good results, it’s very easy. But when you have bad results, to go back home, keep the focus, keep the head down and keep doing the work that you do that at one point it’s going to pay off. It’s hard because you work, it doesn’t. Then you work again, it doesn’t pay off again. And then you keep working until it pays off. And today was a day it paid off. So I am very happy.”It was also emotional to see Di Grassi’s wife, Bianca Diniz Caloi, and their young children standing alongside him on the podium as they popped the champagne.

How Nico Mueller secured the top spot

Andretti driver Nico Mueller and his race engineer Bertrand Mermine have surged to the top of the ABB Engineered to Outrun leaderboard following a dramatic Miami Grand Prix, where post-race penalties reshuffled the final standings in Mueller’s favour. Though he originally crossed the line in 10th, Mueller was promoted to 4th, thanks to a well-timed strategy and a dash of late-race chaos. His calculated decision to split Attack Mode usage proved decisive, paying off when several drivers were hit with time penalties after the chequered flag.The Engineered to Outrun leaderboard celebrates the most dynamic driver-engineer duos in Formula E—tracking those who gain the most positions during a race, with emphasis on overtaking prowess, energy management, and overall race pace. The season concludes with an award for the top-ranked pairing.After Round 5 in Miami, the leaderboard has Maserati MSG Racing’s Stoffel Vandoorne and his race engineer Thibault Arnal on number 2. Mahindra Racing’s Nyck De Vries and race engineer Tom Bayles are in third position in the ABB Engineered to Outrun leaderboard.The FIA Formula E Instagram account also shared the update, posting:“@nico.mueller51 overtaking his way up the rankings! With a mega drive from P18 to P4, the @andrettife driver tops the @abbgroup Engineered to Outrun leaderboard after Round 5. #MiamiEPrix #FormulaE #Motorsport #Racing.”Nico Mueller’s rise was the result of strategy combined with fortunate timing. While many drivers delayed activating Attack Mode until later in the race, Mueller opted for a more aggressive strategy—using two four-minute activations, starting with the first on Lap 11 to position himself within points range.By Lap 20, Mueller was running in 10th when a red flag was brought out following a three-car collision. After the restart, as the majority of the grid scrambled to use their remaining Attack Mode activations, Mueller’s earlier strategy gave him an edge.Despite finishing 10th on the road, he was ultimately classified 4th after multiple post-race penalties were issued. Drivers including Norman Nato, Robin Frijns, Oliver Rowland, Sam Bird, and Taylor Barnard were penalized 10 seconds each for misuse of Attack Mode, while Nick Cassidy received a five-second penalty for exceeding track limits.Also Read: Formula E Miami E-Prix 2025: Jake Hughes crashes at chicane, here’s how the multi-car collision changed the outcome.

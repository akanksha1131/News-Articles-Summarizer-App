The gravity-defying catch Dewald Brevis pulled off on Wednesday night was probably the lone shining light for the Chennai Super Kings (CSK), who are enduring a dismal season.Brevis' catch stunned the cricketing world, and the 22-year-old has been appreciated for his exceptional presence of mind at the boundary rope.In the first two balls of the 18th over, Punjab Kings' Shashank Singh hammered Ravindra Jadeja for a boundary and a six. Shashank was looking to finish the game in a hurry and was looking to clear the rope again, but Brevis, with his excellent awareness, caught it in the thin air at deep mid-wicket.Brevis, patrolling at long-on, ran and made the first contact with the ball inside the field of play as he caught it, then threw it up in the air. He crossed the rope but was airborne when he flicked the ball back inside the field of play and then came back to catch it.Meanwhile, with another loss, CSK's journey in IPL 2025 came to a disappointing end as they became the first team to be officially eliminated from the playoff race following a thrilling four-wicket loss to Punjab Kings at the MA Chidambaram Stadium.This marks a historic low for the MS Dhoni-led franchise, as they have now failed to make it to the playoffs in two consecutive seasons ‚Äì something that had never happened before in the team‚Äôs illustrious history.Batting first at Chepauk, CSK rode on a magnificent knock by Sam Curran, who scored a fluent 88 off just 47 balls, featuring nine fours and four sixes. Coming in at a precarious 48 for 3 in the power-play, Curran took charge of the innings and stitched a vital 78-run stand with Dewald Brevis (32), steadying the ship and lifting CSK towards a competitive total.When CSK seemed to be setting up a strong finish, Yuzvendra Chahal turned the game on its head. The leg-spinner, who had bowled just two overs until the 19th, returned to bowl the penultimate over and scripted a remarkable collapse.After being hit for a six by Dhoni, Chahal dismissed him the very next ball. What followed was a procession ‚Äì Deepak Hooda, Anshul Kamboj, and Noor Ahmad all fell in quick succession as Chahal picked up a sensational hat-trick, his second in the IPL, to restrict CSK to 190.In reply, Punjab Kings, despite losing a few wickets in the middle overs, including the well-set Prabhsimran and Shashank Singh (23), remained calm. Iyer's composed acceleration and a bit of luck at the death helped Punjab chase down the target in 19.4 overs.",Dewald Brevis caught Shashank Singh off the bowling of Yuzvendra Chahal.

With their playoff hopes hanging by a thread, Chennai Super Kings will look to salvage pride and momentum when they face Punjab Kings in a crucial IPL clash at Chepauk on Wednesday.The five-time champions have endured a forgettable season, managing just two wins in nine games to sit at the bottom of the table. Punjab Kings, though inconsistent, are better placed at fifth with five victories and will be keen to exploit CSK‚Äôs vulnerabilities to climb further.Chepauk, once a fortress, has failed to inspire CSK this season. Even the return of MS Dhoni as captain, following Ruturaj Gaikwad‚Äôs elbow injury, hasn‚Äôt sparked a turnaround. Dhoni admitted the team‚Äôs struggles with combinations and poor powerplay performances.Youngster Ayush Mhatre, who impressed on debut, will be in focus against Arshdeep Singh‚Äôs new-ball burst. A key contest could unfold between Shivam Dube and in-form Yuzvendra Chahal in the middle overs.PBKS openers Priyansh Arya and Prabhsimran Singh have been solid, while CSK will bank on Noor Ahmad and Khaleel Ahmed to contain them. CSK‚Äôs core ‚Äî Ravindra Jadeja, Ashwin, and Pathirana ‚Äî has underperformed, and the top order remains unsettled.With Marco Jansen, Chahal, and Arshdeep firing, PBKS will start favourites against a demoralised CSK unit.The playing surface in Chennai presents a mixed challenge for batters and bowlers alike. The dimensions are slightly asymmetrical ‚Äî 68 metres and 65 metres square of the wicket, with 80 metres down the ground. The pitch is quite dry and expected to play slightly on the slower side. It may be a touch two-paced, offering some assistance to bowlers who vary their pace smartly. Spinners will also find some grip as the match progresses.Shaik Rasheed, Ayush Mhatre, Dewald Brevis, Shivam Dube, Deepak Hooda, Sam Curran, Ravindra Jadeja, MS Dhoni (w/c), Noor Ahmad, Khaleel Ahmed, Matheesha PathiranaImpact Player ‚Äì Anshul Kamboj/Ravichandran AshwinPriyansh Arya, Prabhsimran Singh, Shreyas Iyer (c), Josh Inglis (w), Nehal Wadhera, Shashank Singh, Glenn Maxwell, Azmatullah Omarzai, Marco Jansen, Arshdeep Singh, Yuzvendra ChahalImpact Player - Harpreet Brar/Musheer KhanMS Dhoni (c&wk), Dewald Brevis, Devon Conway, Rahul Tripathi, Shaik Rasheed, Vansh Bedi, Andre Siddharth, Ayush Mhatre, Rachin Ravindra, Ravichandran Ashwin, VIjay Shankar, Sam Curran, Anshul Kamboj, Deepak Hooda, Jamie Overton, Kamlesh Nagarkoti, Ramakrishna Ghosh, Ravindra Jadeja, Shivam Dube, Khaleel Ahmed, Noor Ahmad, Mukesh Choudhary, Nathan Ellis, Shreyas Gopal, Matheesha Pathirana.Shreyas Iyer (c), Yuzvendra Chahal, Arshdeep Singh, Marcus Stoinis, Nehal Wadhera, Glenn Maxwell, Vyshak Vijaykumar, Yash Thakur, Harpreet Brar, Vishnu Vinod, Marco Jansen, Lockie Ferguson, Josh Inglis, Xavier Bartlett, Kuldeep Sen, Pyla Avinash, Suryansh Shedge, Musheer Khan, Harnoor Pannu, Aaron Hardie, Priyansh Arya, Azmatullah Omarzai.Played: 32CSK wins: 17PBKS wins: 15Expect extremely warm conditions at the MA Chidambaram Stadium on Wednesday, with daytime temperatures peaking at 36¬∞C and a real feel of up to 43¬∞C.

A Father's Pride: How RR, Dravid & Vikram Shaped Vaibhav Suryavanshi

With the Test tour of England less than a couple of months away, the Indian cricket board (BCCI) has readied a pool of players for the five-Test series and preceding India ‚ÄòA‚Äô tour . TOI has learnt that Rohit Sharma (in pic) is in the shortlist of around 35 players to be split between the India ‚ÄòA‚Äô and Test teams. While there has been speculation about Rohit‚Äôs place in the Test team, it seems that the selectors and board are still not sure if the team is ready to move on from him as captain on such a significant tour.The board has already started arranging travel plans. The selectors are expected to pick the teams by the second week of May. One of the major areas of concern has been finding a steady middle-order Test batter at No. 5 or 6. It is learnt that the selectors are looking at Rajat Patidar and Karun Nair to fill the void. The two could be tried out in the India ‚ÄòA‚Äô series which starts within a week of the IPL ending on May 25. Interestingly, Shreyas Iyer and Axar Patel have not yet been included in the shortlist.‚ÄúRohit is most likely to travel as the board feels that one needs a strong captain through the series, which is likely to be as tough as the Australia tour. With regard to the middle-order, the team management has shown very little confidence in Sarfaraz Khan‚Äôs ability. Nair and Patidar are seasoned red-ball players and are in fine form. It is likely at least one of them will be in the India ‚ÄòA‚Äô team. As for Iyer, he was dropped last year based on his poor returns in Test cricket. A final call is yet to be be taken,‚Äù a BCCI source said. It is also learnt that Sai Sudharshan is considered to be the third opener for the series.Another significant name on the list is Kuldeep Yadav . Kuldeep has been out of favour for overseas Tests for a while now. With Ravichandran Ashwin retiring during the Australia tour, selectors may be tempted to pick Kuldeep, who offers an attacking spin option.In any case, the selectors are going to carry a decent number of travelling reserves which will largely comprise of backup pacers for Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Shami, besides the odd spinner.

A Father's Pride: How RR, Dravid & Vikram Shaped Vaibhav Suryavanshi

Poll What aspect of Vaibhav Suryavanshi's game do you find most impressive? His ability to dominate top bowlers at such a young age His fearless approach and aggression with the bat

Rajasthan Royals‚Äô teen sensation Vaibhav Suryavanshi took the cricket world by storm on Monday, earning plenty of admirers during his one-of-a-kind century against Gujarat Titans in Jaipur. Among the fast-growing list are former Australia players Michael Hussey and James Hopes, currently on coaching duties in the IPL. Chennai Super Kings batting coach Hussey reserved high praise for Vaibhav, remarking that the 14-year-old pocket dynamite brought back memories of legendary Adam Gilchrist ‚Äôs thrill-a-minute performances. ‚ÄúIt was incredible, was it not? There are some of these players who come along and when they are batting in the middle, you do not want to miss a ball,‚Äù said Hussey on Tuesday, the eve of the CSK-Punjab Kings encounter here.‚ÄúWhen Gilchrist walked out to bat, the whole Australian team would come to the viewing area to watch the game. Because they (such players) are just so exciting. I felt the same watching this young kid. Seeing him score a century off 30-odd balls was amazing to watch,‚Äù added Hussey.Punjab fast-bowling coach Hopes hailed the fearlessness of the ‚ÄòGen Z‚Äô batters. ‚ÄúIt was hard to take my eyes off last night (Monday). These kids in general play a different game. They come up against the Kohlis and Dhonis of the world, but do not have any fear. Indian cricket is well placed, especially in the white-ball formats,‚Äù said Hopes.Hussey is ‚Äúblown away‚Äù by Vaibhav‚Äôs enviable ability to go after the bowlers without dwelling on their reputation. On Monday, the youngster took the India internationals, including veteran Ishant Sharma, to the cleaners during his jaw-dropping knock.‚ÄúHim and Yashasvi Jaiswal batting together was breathtaking. It is reckless at times, but it is so exciting to watch. To be able to play like that, against some of the best bowlers, it just blows your mind,‚Äù said Hussey, warning that Vaibhav should be surrounded by the right people to move in the right direction. ‚ÄúHis life and world have changed forever now. He is going to be on such a high probably for weeks or months. He will need good people around him to guide him. He is very lucky to have Rahul Dravid (RR head coach) and some good senior players.‚ÄùHopes pointed out that Indian cricket has turned into a talent factory courtesy the ‚Äúexposure‚Äù it provides to the youth. ‚ÄúWe do have such talent in Australia, but they do not get exposed at a young age like they do here. We do not have as many teams. We have only six domestic teams and eight Big Bash League teams,‚Äù said Hopes.","Rajasthan Royals‚Äô teen sensation Vaibhav Suryavanshi took the cricket world by storm on Monday, earning plenty of admirers.

Vaibhav Suryavanshi‚Äôs jaw-dropping century gotto hit the rewind button and recall exploits of other talented Indian cricketers who became teenage superstars.It‚Äôs a pity there is no official record of that mad game in Peshawar in Dec 1989. Bad light ensured that an ODI was converted to a 20-over exhibition match. A T20, a decade and a half before T20 was formally invented. Tendulkar, all of 16, walked in when India needed 69 runs from five overs to chase down Pakistan‚Äôs 157. He smashed Mushtaq Ahmed for two sixes, which prompted legendary Pakistani leggie Abdul Qadir to slip in the now-infamous barb, ‚ÄúBachchon ko kyon mar rahe ho? Hamein bhi maar ke dikhao (why are you hitting kids? Hit my deliveries and show me).‚Äù The 16-year-old obliged, hitting Qadir for 6, 0, 4, 6, 6, 6. Tendulkar ended up with an 18-ball 53 and became the mood barometer of a cricket-mad nation for the next 25 years.Stories of a young Punjab southpaw depositing balls from Churchgate‚Äôs Oval maidan onto the streets had already started doing the rounds in Mumbai when he was training at the Vengsarkar academy. Yuvraj Singh, 18, son of former India pacer Yograj Singh, was a star of India‚Äôs victorious U-19 WC campaign in Sri Lanka, and made it to the Indian team. In the ICC KnockOut quarterfinal against Australia in Nairobi, he entered with India in trouble at 90/3. The power and punch that he generated while playing off the backfoot to pacers like Glenn McGrath, Brett Lee and Jason Gillespie left spectators awestruck. Yuvraj went on to become a great in white-ball cricket.You think only Pakistani magician Wasim Akram had the copyright to move an old ball? Search ‚ÄòIrfan Pathan + Adam Gilchrist + 2004 Sydney‚Äô. And, if you‚Äôre still in school, open your geometry textbook and continue studying the parabola. That is what this 19-yearold from Baroda produced to dismiss the savage Aussie batter. Changing his line of attack from round to over the wicket, Irfan drew Gilchrist forward, created a gap, got the ball to tail in at his toes very late and defeated Gilchrist‚Äôs defences to hit timber. It was sorcery. Fittingly, it was Bill Lawry‚Äôs roar of ‚Äúbowled him, what a ripper‚Äù that called the moment.The ‚ÄòBoy Wonder‚Äô before Sachin Tendulkar and the youngest to play for India in a Test as a 17-year-old in 1983, vs West Indies in Antigua.

Watch Javed Miandad‚Äôs stumping in the WCC final in 1985, or his setting up of Allan Lamb with a magical googly in the same tournament. A match haul of 12/181 vs England at the Wankhede in Nov 1984, two months prior to his Australia heroics, served ample notice of his talent. In a tragic loss for Indian cricket, his career went downhill from there on.With the nation still dealing with Sachin Tendulkar‚Äôs retirement at an emotional Wankhede a week ago, Prithvi Shaw seemed to have taken it upon himself to fill the void. Aged 14, he smashed 546 for Rizvi Springfield vs St. Francis d‚Äô Assisi in a Harris Shield match in Nov 2013 at Azad Maidan, barely two kilometres away from Wankhede. Four years later, a hundred on Ranji debut vs Tamil Nadu in the semis followed. Six months later, he emulated Tendulkar to score a ton on Duleep Trophy debut. After leading India to the U-19 World Cup in New Zealand in Feb 2018, the world was at his feet. A ton on Test debut at Rajkot followed vs West Indies. Sadly, fame and off-field indiscretions saw him slip down the pecking order.","Sachin Tendulkar was just 16 when he made his debut for India against Pakistan.

Everything is special about Vaibhav Suryavanshi: Vikram Rathour

Vaibhav Suryavanshi has dominated headlines from India to USA for his blistering 35-ball century for Rajasthan Royals against Gujarat Titans. The 14-year-old's smashing effort saw him become the youngest IPL centurion and to add to it, he also became the fastest Indian to an IPL century. Rahul Dravid , the current Royals head coach, is getting a first-hand look at Suryavanshi's development. While the adulation, from different spheres, is much-deserved, it comes with its own level of caution in managing the teenager, stated the former India coach.‚ÄúWhat can we do for Vaibhav? I think it's going to be challenging. Right just from this very interview I've come, every single question I've been asked has been about Vaibhav, right? So, I mean, it's exactly the thoughts that it's going on in the top of my head that this is going to be challenging for him and for the kid,‚Äù said the RR coach during a Star Sports Press Room on Wednesday.‚ÄúI mean, it's going to be challenging. But it's also exciting. I think it's going to be exciting as well as it's going to be challenging. I think, again, I would love to say that, maybe we should not shower him with that much attention and that much focus. But maybe I'm being na√Øve and maybe I'm not being realistic because maybe that is going to happen.‚Äù‚ÄúSo like I said and answered earlier, maybe it's just a question of putting a bit of a support system around him and trying to help him navigate that as best as he possibly can,‚Äù added Dravid.Dravid acknowledged that it won't be easy for Vaibhav to shy away from the limelight following his heroics despite having played only three IPL matches.""Recognising that it happens and putting a certain level of support around that and navigate that attention and allow him space to be a youngster. It is part of being a cricketer in this country, it is impossible to distance yourself from and (you tend to get) sucked into it,"" said the Indian legend.As the India U-19 coach, Dravid has seen multiple talents come through the system such as Rishabh Pant, Shubman Gill, Prithvi Shaw, Yashasvi Jaiswal and many more. Asked about Suryavanshi, Dravid explained what makes him special.""For me it is really the ability to have that level of fearlessness and not get fazed by the occasion. You don't get to see that with people that young. The range of shots he showed.""He is only going to get better. Nobody is saying that he is a finished article. No one should rush to call him somebody he is not. Teams will be smarter against him. T20 format is such where he will have games where it will not work out,"" he cautioned.An aspect that has stood out for the youngster is his ability to go for sixes. He cleared the boundary rope 11 times in his 35-ball hundred against GT.""What gives him power is a good bat speed, high backlift, hand-eye coordination. His judgment of length is something that has amazed me, whether it is fractionally short or full, he can capitalise on that. His natural strength is helpful in this situation,"" said the Indian great.In a video clip, Suryavanshi was shown praising Dravid for making him a better cricketer over the past three months. In his typical mannerisms, Dravid played down the role played by him in his rise and put the credit squarely on the kid from Samastipur.""The biggest credit goes to him. It would be wrong of me to take credit for him. He has come through a system (having played first class and India U19.""His father has been supportive. Here in Rajasthan Royals, so many people have been involved...he will be asked Dravid questions and he has to give a diplomatic answer,"" the former India captain said with a smile.""We try to keep it simple with him. For us, it is important that he plays the kind of cricket he enjoys playing...It is pretty obvious he likes to play attacking brand of cricket. We picked him not keeping his age in mind, we were convinced of his talent,"" he added.","Vaibhav Suryavanshi has dominated headlines from India to USA for his blistering 35-ball century for Rajasthan Royals against Gujarat Titans.

In a major step to deepen its engagement with Indian fans and support the growth of football across the country, the English Premier League announced the opening of its new office in Mumbai on Wednesday. This marks the latest expansion of the League‚Äôs global footprint and its enduring association with India‚Äôs burgeoning football community.The Mumbai office aims to bolster the Premier League's efforts to grow the sport at both grassroots and elite levels, while also enhancing connections with fans and stakeholders in the region. The office will serve as a hub for collaboration with local authorities, the Indian Super League (ISL), and governing bodies, helping to further integrate the Premier League‚Äôs programs and initiatives within India‚Äôs footballing ecosystem.Premier League Chief Executive Richard Masters underscored the importance of this move. ‚ÄúWe and our clubs have a fantastic and knowledgeable fanbase in India, and we know football continues to grow in popularity. We are proud of our longstanding commitment to India, having worked to deliver community football programmes for 18 years and, more recently, our partnership with the Indian Super League,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúOpening this office marks a significant milestone for the Premier League. It will allow us to operate more effectively locally as we build on our existing work to establish more ways to strengthen our relationship with fans, JioStar and other partners.‚ÄùThe Premier League‚Äôs connection with India began in 2007 through the Premier Skills initiative, in partnership with the British Council. Over the past 18 years, the program has trained more than 7,300 coaches and referees across 18 Indian states, positively impacting over 124,000 young people. At the elite level, the League‚Äôs alliance with the ISL since 2014 has resulted in meaningful collaboration in areas such as youth development, coaching standards, and referee training.Additionally, the Next Gen Cup ‚Äî an elite youth tournament co-hosted with the ISL and Reliance Foundation ‚Äî continues to foster top-level talent.

: Two games won, two more to go.That‚Äôs the scenario for Kalinga Super Cup semifinalists, barring Mohun Bagan Super Giants who needed just one win to join the last four, as they look to book a place in the summit clash with another win here on Wednesday.‚ÄúAll four teams have the same target. And we are all in that moment of the competition where every game is very difficult,‚Äù India and FC Goa head coach Manolo Marquez said at the pre-match press conference at Kalinga Stadium on Tuesday.Marquez‚Äôs Goa will be vying it out with ISL Shield and Cup winners Mohun Bagan in an afternoon fixture and Jamshedpur FC are set to lock horns with Mumbai City FC in the game scheduled for the evening.While the absence of the star foreigners in the ISL champions‚Äô squad makes FC Goa ‚Äì who dominated Gokulam Kerala in a 3-0 win before edging a valiant Punjab FC 2-1 in the quarterfinal ‚Äì the favourites in their last-four clash, their Spanish head coach is not ready to pay heed to the statistics.‚ÄúMohun Bagan are here with half of the main team squad and the other half were champions of the Reliance Foundation Development League two weeks ago. The game will be very difficult because they have nothing to lose. That is the reality. They have already won two trophies and the slot for the Asian competition,‚Äù he added.Led by assistant coach Bastab Roy in absence of Jose Molina, Bagan were devastating in their quarterfinal against Kerala Blasters, with Kerala boys Ashique Kuruniyan and Sahal Abdul Samad combining well while 21-year-old playmaker Salahudheen Adnan K stole the show with his Player of the Match performance.Roy, meanwhile, took the game in the team‚Äôs stride and admitted that they have a tough job against Marquez‚Äôs Goa.‚ÄúFC Goa are, without a doubt, a better and a stronger team than Kerala Blasters. So my job is not easy. But my players are focussed and ready. It‚Äôs an exposure trip for the young boys and some seniors as well. It's a semifinal and I‚Äôve told my boys to enjoy the game,‚Äù was Roy‚Äôs comments on Tuesday.Goa, however, have a silver lining even in a semis defeat as AIFF earlier announced they would get the 2025-26 AFC Champions League 2 spot if Bagan go on to clinch the trophy on Saturday.That‚Äôs not the case for the other semifinalists with Mumbai City and Jamshedpur both eager to make up for their ISL playoffs disappointments and leave the memories of exiting the Super Cup last time in the last-four stage behind and end this season on a high.‚ÄúWe never think like this (about the previous tournaments). If this is a new challenge, you must think positively and try to get good positive results. We‚Äôre playing in the semifinal. It‚Äôs an important game. We are playing against a good team and must work hard to get a positive result,‚Äù Khalid Jamil said at the pre-match interaction.Jamshedpur, who will hope to be third-time lucky after being ousted twice in the last-four stage, will have the psychological edge having beaten Mumbai City in both legs of the ISL.However, the Red Miners‚Äô defence ‚Äî led by the in-form Stephen Eze ‚Äî will have to deal with the Lallianzuala Chhangte threat with the opposition skipper being the standout performer so far with three goals and an assist, including the winner against Inter Kashi in the last eight.But only Wednesday will tell who gets the chance to vie for the trophy on Saturday.",Mohun Bagan Super Giant and FC Goa will go head-to-head in the semifinal of the Kalinga Super Cup on Wednesday.

Poll Do you think Liverpool can maintain their dominance in the league next season? It's too early to tell No, other teams will catch up Yes, they will continue to dominate

Liverpool secured their 20th English top-flight title with a stunning 5-1 victory over Tottenham Hotspur at an electrified Anfield on Sunday, sealing a record-equalling crown in emphatic style. The Reds, under manager Arne Slot, left no doubt as they turned an early deficit into a comprehensive win that saw them extend their lead to 15 points over second-placed Arsenal, making their title mathematically unassailable with just four games remaining.The match began with an air of anticipation, as Liverpool fans serenaded their team with the iconic ""You'll Never Walk Alone,"" and their team responded with attacking intent. However, Tottenham briefly threatened to spoil the party when Dominic Solanke powered home a header from a James Maddison corner in the 12th minute. The goal, which initially appeared to be offside, was awarded after VAR's intervention.The setback only seemed to galvanize Liverpool, who quickly leveled through Luis Diaz. The Colombian forward slotted home from close range following a fine cross from Dominik Szoboszlai. The home side then took the lead just minutes later, as Alexis Mac Allister rifled a thunderous shot past Spurs goalkeeper Guglielmo Vicario in the 24th minute.Liverpool were rampant, and after Tottenham's inability to clear their lines, Cody Gakpo seized the opportunity to make it 3-1, firing a low shot into the corner. Spurs, fielding a weakened side due to manager Ange Postecoglou's focus on the Europa League semi-finals, were now on the back foot.As the second half progressed, the Liverpool faithful were craving a goal from their star man, Mohamed Salah. Their wish was granted when Salah collected a pass from Szoboszlai, cut inside, and blasted the ball into the bottom corner, celebrating by taking a selfie with a fan in front of the Kop. The crowd erupted in joyous chants, and the atmosphere at Anfield reached fever pitch.The final goal came when Tottenham defender Destiny Udogie inadvertently turned the ball into his own net, sealing a 5-1 rout and sending the Liverpool fans into a frenzy. As the final whistle blew, Anfield reverberated with deafening cheers, and the celebrations began in full force.Liverpool's triumph marked their 20th league title, bringing them level with Manchester United at the top of the all-time list. It also represented a significant achievement for manager Arne Slot, who has steered the club to glory in his first season after replacing Jurgen Klopp last year.","Liverpool secured their 20th English top-flight title with a stunning 5-1 victory over Tottenham Hotspur at an electrified Anfield on Sunday.

Poll How should AIFF handle the situation moving forward? Consult FIFA for further guidance. Stand by their decision and await CAS verdict. Revoke the trophy award until CAS concludes.

In a controversial move, the All India Football Federation (AIFF) awarded the I-League trophy to Churchill Brothers on Sunday, just hours after the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) had stayed the decision and barred any formal felicitation. The defiant act could invite further scrutiny from global bodies like FIFA and CAS.Deputy secretary general M Satyanarayan handed the trophy to Churchill Brothers at a ceremony in Goa, claiming the AIFF only learned about the CAS order after the presentation. ""I was on a flight to Goa and the AIFF Secretariat was closed on Sunday. I came to know about the order only after giving away the trophy,"" Satyanarayan told PTI.The CAS stay came on an urgent application filed by Inter Kashi, who argued that a pending points dispute could alter the final standings. Inter Kashi president Prithiijit Das asserted, ""The CAS order came around 1:30 pm IST and the mail was marked to AIFF also,"" questioning the federation's explanation.CAS deputy president Elizabeth Steiner had clearly ruled that the AIFF must not declare a winner or hold any ceremony until the arbitration concludes. The respondents, including AIFF and Churchill Brothers, have until April 29 to respond.Defending its move, AIFF later issued a statement, emphasising that the presentation was based on previous Delhi High Court and Appeals Committee rulings and that the federation would comply with CAS' final verdict.Churchill Brothers had provisionally finished atop the I-League standings, but Inter Kashi's challenge over a disputed match result could yet overturn the title race. With the CAS involved, how FIFA and the world body react remains to be seen, especially since sports federations are bound to respect CAS directives.The controversy has cast a shadow over Indian football's governance yet again.","The All India Football Federation (AIFF) awarded the I-League trophy to Churchill Brothers on Sunday, just hours after the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) had stayed the decision.

Poll Which team do you think will win the next Clasico? It's too close to call Barcelona Real Madrid

Real Madrid came into the Copa del Rey final on the back of a horrid month. Defeats against Valencia and over both legs against Arsenal had thrown them out of Champions League and dented La Liga title hopes. Even in the Cup, they needed to claw from 1-3 down to beat Real Sociedad in the semi-final. On the field, it hasn't been smooth sailing by a long shot.Over the last two days, off-the-field antics took a massive hit as well. A club that prides itself on its class and gentlemanliness, showed neither in a haughty display which veered on petulance.At La Cartuja in Sevilla, Real Madrid were outplayed by a superior Barcelona side , losing 3-2 in extra time to lift the Cup for a record-extending 32nd time. It marked a third straight defeat for Real Madrid in Clasicos this season, scoring four and conceding 12. Two of those came in the finals - first in the Spanish Super Cup and now in the Copa. As far as warming up to the big job is concerned, Hansi Flick has done an incredible job. And the job is far from finished, Barcelona remain on course for a treble.Real Madrid, meanwhile, only have the league to play for. And that is hardly an easy passage. The Carlo Ancelotti-managed side are four points behind Barcelona with five matches to go. Winning the Clasico on May 11 is vital to the club's bid to avoid a trophy-less season. If it comes in a season where your arch-rivals win a treble, that is a recipe for disaster.Before all that, though, Real Madrid's conduct pre-and-post the Copa del Rey final has come under intense scrutiny. After the final whistle, Antonio Rudiger , Jude Bellingham and Lucas Vazquez were sent off for protesting amid ugly scenes.Both Bellingham and Rudiger were required to be restrained as they had a pop at the referee. The latter could even cop a lengthy ban for throwing an object at the referee from the sidelines. Questioning the referees had started at an institutional level . For months, Real Madrid TV attacked referees for their decisions and after taking umbrage with a decision in February, the club issued an official statement labelling officiating in the country as ""rigged"" and ""completely discredited"".Furthermore, the club has refused to make players available for pitch-side and mixed zone interactions during the league - a practice followed by every other club. Instead, Real Madrid players have kept their interactions limited to the club's official TV channel.Slamming of the referees and dissection of their decisions continued until it reached boiling point on Friday. In an emotional news conference before the Copa del Rey final, officials for the high-stakes encounter hit back.Referee Ricardo de Burgos Bengoetxea broke down in tears while explaining the impact Real Madrid's attacks have had on his family life and that of other referees.VAR referee Pablo Gonzalez Fuertes, seated alongside him, suggested officials will have to take ""much more serious measures"" while hinting at a possible strike.In response, Real Madrid didn't buckle down. Instead, they went into counter-attack. They pulled out of the scheduled open training session for the media, a press conference, president's traditional dinner and a photo-call.The game went ahead, with the same officials, despite suggestions in the Spanish media that Real Madrid were considering withdrawing. The focus, well and truly, was on the referees.For the most part, the referees did a good job of keeping the game flowing despite 34 fouls being committed by both teams and seven yellow cards being brandished out.Ironically, Barcelona were awarded a penalty in the sixth minute of stoppage time when Raphinha fell under pressure from Raul Asencio. As tension crept up, the cameras panned squarely on the officials, De Burgos Bengoetxea was called to assess the incident by the VAR official. Following a brief look, the decision was overturned.In a game that had 50-50 decisions galore, and players of both sides upset with the referee, Jules Kounde drilled in a low shot past Thibaut Courtois to seal the deal.As Real Madrid looked for yet another miracle, Kylian Mbappe was penalised for a foul, getting his hand in the face of a Barcelona player. That broke all the pent-up frustration for the Real Madrid players.Rudiger, already substituted by then, threw something at the referee and was sent off. It took several players and staff to contain him as a bag of ice burst in his hands - which may well have been his next projectile. After hours to cool down, the German defender has apologised for his behaviour.Bellingham, who had already vented to the officials in the tunnel before, was then sent off, too. As was Vazquez for coming onto the pitch to protest.Ancelotti admitted he had no idea about the last two red cards. A reflection of cluelessness that has plagued the Italian manager this season. The squad has struggled to find the right structure for the team. Since Toni Kroos, Nacho Fernandez and Joselu's departure in the summer, the club hasn't filled in the right replacements.Lamine Yamal's post-match message delivered the zinger. ""They can't handle us this year, we've proven it,"" said the teenager, wearing two pairs of sunglasses, the ice-cool antithesis to Madrid's red-hot rage.","Real Madrid lost 3-2 in extra time to Barcelona in the Copa del Rey final.

End to end

Seville: Barcelona defender Jules Kounde struck deep in extra-time to decide a gripping Copa del Rey Clasico final on Saturday in Seville, earning his side a 3-2 win over rivals Real Madrid .The Catalans, aiming for a quadruple this season, won the first major trophy of Hansi Flick's reign as coach and a record-extending 32nd Spanish cup in dramatic fashion.Three Real Madrid players were sent off during and after a fiery conclusion to the game, including England international Jude Bellingham.Pedri sent Barcelona ahead at La Cartuja but two Real Madrid goals in seven second-half minutes, from Kylian Mbappe and Aurelien Tchouameni, pulled the Spanish and European champions level.However, Ferran Torres struck in the 84th minute to take the game to extra-time and Kounde drilled home to win it for the La Liga leaders.""Madrid pushed us to our limits but we showed great character and pride,"" said Kounde.Barca host Inter Milan in the Champions League semi-finals on Wednesday.""They can make a party -- for today, it's OK,"" a delighted Flick, who has won all seven finals he has coached in his career, told Movistar.Substituted Madrid defender Antonio Rudiger was sent off in the final seconds for ""throwing an object"" onto the pitch towards referee Ricardo de Burgos Bengoetxea, according to the official's report, and Lucas Vazquez, also replaced, was dismissed for further protest as Madrid unravelled.Bellingham was sent off after the final whistle for showing an ""aggressive attitude"" towards the referee, who wrote that the midfielder ""had to be restrained by his team-mates"".""I don't want to talk about the referee,"" said stone-faced Madrid coach Ancelotti.""I don't know what happened at the end."" Madrid had issued furious statements about the refereeing team on Friday after they criticised the club's television channel for attacking Spanish officials this season, casting a shadow over the game.Controversy aside, the football was enthralling.Madrid started with top scorer Mbappe on the bench after an ankle injury and lost Ferland Mendy early on with a thigh issue.Barcelona dazzling winger Lamine Yamal, 17, dyed his hair blond for the game and led the assault on Thibaut Courtois' goal.The Catalans, who also won the first two Clasicos this season in La Liga and the Spanish Super Cup, scoring nine goals in the process, controlled the ball.They took the lead after 28 minutes, Pedri placing the ball into the top corner with precision and power from the edge of the box, a sensational goal set up by Yamal.Barcelona's opener brought Madrid out of their shell -- and also Mbappe off the bench to warm up.Bellingham netted but was offside. Vinicius Junior would have won a penalty when hacked down but had also strayed off in the build-up.Barcelona could have doubled their lead, with Dani Olmo's corner hitting the post and Cubarsi unable to turn home as Dani Ceballos held him back.The referee was lenient with some heated Madrid tackles, perhaps cowed by Friday's drama as the Spanish champions seethed at his pre-match comments.Madrid sent Mbappe on for Rodrygo Goes at half-time and soon he and Vinicius began to work Barcelona goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny.Mbappe pulled Madrid level almost on his own in the 70th minute, brought down after surging forward and firing home the free-kick off the post.Seven minutes later Madrid took the lead, Tchouameni heading in Arda Guler's corner.Barcelona responded when Yamal played a delicious pass over the top for Torres, which drew both Rudiger and Courtois, but the Spaniard beat both and rolled home.Controversy unsurprisingly reared its head before the match headed to extra-time.Barcelona clamoured for a penalty when Rudiger tripped Torres, and then were awarded one deep in stoppage time as Raphinha tumbled under pressure -- but the decision was overturned after a VAR review.In extra-time Barcelona were ascendent.They found their winner when Kounde intercepted an uncharacteristically loose Luka Modric pass and beat Courtois from range, sparking wild celebrations.The trio of dismissals and Madrid's pre-match histrionics regarding the officials will ensure the repercussions run on.The teams meet again in La Liga in May in a potential title decider.",Barcelona beat Real Madrid 3-2 in the Copa del Rey final in Seville.

Earlier Monaco E-Prix Winners

The stage is set for the Monaco E-Prix, and among the favourites are Mitch Evans , Oliver Rowland, Ant√≥nio F√©lix Da Costa , and Nick Cassidy. With Monaco hosting a double-header for the first time, there are even more opportunities for new names‚Äîor different combinations‚Äîto climb the podium this weekend. But before that, let‚Äôs take a look at the six winners of the Monaco E-Prix so far.Interestingly, since the Monaco E-Prix adopted the full 3.337 km layout at the Circuit de Monaco, no pole-sitter has gone on to win the race.2022: Jaguar‚Äôs Mitch Evans started from pole but finished second. Stoffel Vandoorne of Mercedes claimed the win.2023: McLaren‚Äôs Jake Hughes took pole but didn‚Äôt make the podium. Nick Cassidy of Envision Racing won, followed by Evans in second and Andretti‚Äôs Jake Dennis in third.2024: Pascal Wehrlein secured pole for Porsche but also failed to finish on the podium. Jaguar dominated the race, with Evans taking the win and teammate Cassidy finishing second. Stoffel Vandoorne, now with DS Penske, completed the podium in third.The 2021 race was an exception to the recent trend. It was the first time Formula E used the full Monaco layout, and the pole-sitter went on to win the race. That year, Ant√≥nio F√©lix da Costa achieved the double for Techeetah-DS. His recent third-place finish at the Miami E-Prix shows he‚Äôs still in strong form with Tag Heuer Porsche. Robin Frijns (Virgin-Audi) finished second in 2021, while Mitch Evans took third that year.Meanwhile, S√©bastien Buemi of e.dams Renault remains the only driver to have won the Monaco E-Prix twice‚Äîand in consecutive editions. He triumphed in 2015 and 2017, during a period when the race was held biennially. On both occasions, Lucas Di Grassi (ABT Sportsline) finished second. Di Grassi is currently showing strong form again, having secured second place for Lola Yamaha ABT in the recent Miami race. In 2019, it was Jean-√âric Vergne of Techeetah-DS who claimed victory.The official Formula E Instagram handle recently shared a poster featuring the six different winners of the Monaco E-Prix, accompanied by the caption: ‚ÄúWill anybody join the exclusive list of #MonacoEPrix winners?‚ÄùAlso Read: Monaco E-Prix 2025: Formula E set for yet another double-header, here‚Äôs all about the most loved race of the year Predicting this weekend‚Äôs results, one fan wrote: ‚ÄúOliver Rowland first, Jake Dennis second, and Pascal Wehrlein in third.‚Äù Rowland received plenty of support in the comments, with even the Formula E page noting: ‚ÄúA lot of love for @oliverrowland1 here.‚Äù","Mitch Evans, Oliver Rowland, Ant√≥nio F√©lix Da Costa and Nick Cassidy are among the favourites to win this weekend's Monaco E-Prix.

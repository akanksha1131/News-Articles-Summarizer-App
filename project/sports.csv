How Bhut met his hero

NEW DELHI: “Pressure daalte raho, chhodna mat, dominate karte raho”: Ravindra Jadeja kept reminding left-arm spinner Parth Bhut from the moment Shubman Gill walked out to bat during Punjab’s Ranji Trophy clash against Saurashtra.Punjab had no answers to Saurashtra’s spin attack and suffered a 194-run defeat inside two days on Friday. Set a stiff target of 320 on a testing surface, the visitors folded for 125 in their second innings. Gill, Punjab’s biggest hope of steering a fightback, managed just 14 off 32 balls before being dismissed. His struggles mirrored the first innings, where he was sent back for a two-ball duck.In both innings, Gill was trapped leg-before by Bhut, who finished with a 10-wicket match haul. After returning figures of 5 for 33 in the first innings, the left-armer delivered an even more incisive spell the next day, picking up 5 for 8 from 10 overs.The spinner from Junagadh credited Jadeja’s constant guidance for his success against Gill and his Player of the Match performance.Bhut, who took up cricket idolising Jadeja, is now living a dream — sharing the field with his hero and soaking in the nuances of the game while learning the finer points of becoming a complete all-rounder.“Jaddu bhai is a legend of the game. He has played a lot of cricket and always shares his experience. Ahead of the Punjab match, he addressed us in the dressing room and said we had to dominate and play attacking cricket. ‘Attack karna hai’ — that’s all he said. When Shubman, who has also played a lot of cricket, came in to bat, Jaddu bhai told me to attack him and be aggressive, and that’s what worked for me. He always discusses match situations and guides us on how to keep a batter under pressure and how to get him out. During practice too, he tells me what kind of balls I can bowl on such wickets, what fields can be set and how to plan dismissals. Putting Gill under pressure worked for us,” an elated Bhut told TimesofIndia.com in an exclusive interview.“More than the Player of the Match award, I am really happy that I could contribute to the team’s win and that we managed to beat a strong side like Punjab within two days. This victory will help us in the later stages of the tournament,” the spinner said.“When Saurashtra became champions for the first time in 2019–20, I broke into the Ranji Trophy side,” said Bhut, who has featured in 22 first-class matches and bagged 76 wickets while scoring 571 runs.The 27-year-old spinner hails from Junagadh and, as a child, would travel to Jamnagar whenever Ravindra Jadeja played or trained there, just to watch the India all-rounder in action.After being aware that a young boy regularly turned up to watch him, Jadeja decided to interact with the aspiring cricketer.“One fine day, I managed to speak to him. When he got to know that I also played junior cricket, I got the chance to bowl at the senior team — that’s how it all began. He always says, ‘Keep working hard. There is no substitute for hard work. Keep working hard and it will pay off one day.’ That’s the approach he has towards cricket. Even at this age, he works extremely hard in the nets. Youngsters get tired, but he doesn’t,” Bhut said.“He is my idol. He is my hero. I took up cricket because of him. I couldn’t have asked for more than sharing the field with a legend like him,” he concluded.","Ravindra Jadeja told Parth Bhut to 'attack' Shubman Gill in Punjab's Ranji Trophy clash. Bhut took 10 wickets for Saurashtra, including 5 for 8 from 10 overs. Punjab were bowled out for 125 in their second innings, losing by 194 runs.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127445807,imgsize-56304,width-400,resizemode-4/parth-bhut-gill-2501-s.jpg"

Former India cricketer Atul Wassan has strongly reacted to comments made by Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Mohsin Naqvi about Pakistan possibly staying away from the 2026 ICC Men’s T20 World Cup.Wassan believes that dragging politics into cricket only harms the game.""I think this is just a bravado, and it's foolish bravado at best to just eyeball ICC and blackmail the whole cricketing world order. I think what they are doing now is just using cricket and their collateral damage players. Who will face the collateral damage? Players will suffer. They don't know anything because they are political capital, so their work will go on. You made cricket an issue and raised your moustache. Because they think that it will be a big brownie point for them see that we have supported Bangladesh,"" Wassan told ANI.His comments come after Mohsin Naqvi suggested that Pakistan could rethink its participation in the T20 World Cup, which will be held in India and Sri Lanka.The statement followed the ICC’s decision to remove Bangladesh from the tournament.Naqvi openly backed Bangladesh and accused the ICC of unfair treatment.He said Bangladesh was wrongly pushed out and claimed the global body was following double standards.""Bangladesh has been treated unfairly. I said the same in the board meeting of the International Cricket Council (ICC). You cannot have double standards, where one country can make whatever decision whenever and do the total opposite for another country. That is why we have taken the stand that Bangladesh is being treated unfairly and should be allowed to play the World Cup in any case. They are a major stakeholder, and this injustice should not be done,"" Naqvi said.The ICC confirmed on Saturday that Scotland will replace Bangladesh in the 2026 T20 World Cup.

Bangladesh cricket in turmoil: What it means for the T20 World Cup?

All eyes on Pakistan

NEW DELHI: After weeks of communication, suspense, and drama, the International Cricket Council (ICC) has announced that Scotland will replace Bangladesh for the 2026 edition of the T20 World Cup. The writing was on the wall the moment Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) ""refused to participate in the tournament per the published match schedule"".It is learnt that the global cricket body has already communicated the decision to both Bangladesh and Scotland. The Group C of the multi-nation tournament will now feature England, Italy, Nepal, West Indies, and Scotland.The ICC Board, chaired by Jay Shah, who reached Dubai on Friday, took the decision as it wasn't feasible to make any changes to the schedule so close to the tournament.""The decision follows an extensive process undertaken by the ICC to address concerns raised by the BCB regarding the hosting of its scheduled matches in India,"" ICC's statement reads.""Over a period of more than three weeks, the ICC engaged with the BCB through multiple rounds of dialogue conducted in a transparent and constructive manner, including meetings held both via video conference and in-person.""As part of this process, the ICC reviewed the concerns cited by the BCB, commissioned and considered independent security assessments from internal and external experts, and shared detailed security and operational plans covering federal and state arrangements, as well as enhanced and escalating security protocols for the event.These assurances were reiterated at several stages, including during discussions involving the ICC Business Corporation (IBC) Board.""The ICC’s assessments concluded that there was no credible or verifiable security threat to the Bangladesh national team, officials or supporters in India.""In light of these findings, and after careful consideration of the broader implications, the ICC determined that it was not appropriate to amend the published event schedule.""Following a meeting on Wednesday, the Bangladesh Cricket Board had been given a 24-hour timeframe to confirm whether its team would participate in India as scheduled.As no confirmation was received within the deadline, the ICC ""proceeded in line with its established governance and qualification processes to identify a replacement team.""Scotland were picked as the replacement team because they are the next-highest-ranked T20I team that had missed the qualification for the tournament. They are currently ranked 14th.The World Cup drama, however, is not expected to die down any time soon, as the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has termed the decision and handling of the Bangladesh matter as ""unfair"".“We have taken the position that Bangladesh is being treated unfairly. They should be made to play the World Cup from the very beginning; they are a major stakeholder and this unfairness should not happen to them,” PCB chief Mohsin Naqvi said.He remains non-committal on Pakistan's participation in the tournament and said the decision will be taken by the government.“Whether we play in the T20 World Cup or not, the decision will be taken by the government,"" said Naqvi.“Our PM (Shahbaz Sharif) is out of the country. When he comes back, we will take advice from him. The decision by the government will be final and binding, and if they say no, then they (ICC) may invite any other team,"" he added.","ICC announce Scotland will replace Bangladesh for the 2026 edition of the T20 World Cup.

NEW DELHI: The Bangladesh Cricket Board’s (BCB) desperate last-minute attempt to avoid ejection from next month’s T20 World Cup fell flat on Friday when the International Cricket Council (ICC) struck down their appeal to the their Dispute Resolution Committee (DRC) challenging the global body’s decision to reject their demand of not playing in India.BCB, directed by govt adviser to sports ministry Asif Nazrul, emailed ICC’s DRC alleging injustice done by the ICC board with regards to their ask of moving all their matches to Sri Lanka from India. TOI understands that BCB has failed to formally write to ICC about their final decision of not playing in India despite the ICC board giving them a 24-hour window on Wednesday. It is understood that the ICC has initiated its process of replacing the Bangladesh team with Scotland while an official confirmation is expected over the weekend.Nazrul and BCB president Aminul Islam on Thursday announced in a media briefing that they won’t allow their team to travel to India citing security concerns to their players and fans after the Indian board’s ( BCCI ) move to oust seamer Mustafizur Rahman from the IPL. Both claimed they will keep fighting to have Bangladesh play their T20 World Cup matches in Sri Lanka.BCB’s appeal cited the ICC agreeing to an arrangement between BCCI and Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) where the teams don’t travel to each other’s country.TOI has learnt that the appeal with the DRC didn’t stand legally. The DRC is not set up to entertain appeals against its own board. Its function is to resolve disputes at a lower operational level or between member boards.As per the clause in the terms of reference for the DRC, “It shall not operate as an appeal body against decisions of the ICC or any decision making body established under the ICC’s Memorandum and Articles of Association or under any rules or regulations of the ICC...”ICC chairman Jay Shah was in Dubai headquarters on Saturday. It is also learnt that the BCB’s demeanour in the entire saga has not gone down well with the members. BCB chose to announce their decision via media briefings while not writing to the ICC. The world body maintained that ceding to BCB’s request here will set a precedent of undermining the sanctity of future ICC tournaments and its neutrality.",Bangladesh Cricket Board's last-minute attempt to avoid ejection from T20 World Cup fell flat on Friday.

BENGALURU: For those preparing for the World Cup 2026 matches in the US, awaiting them are fast tracked visas and curated experiences including road trips to explore the heart of the US — on Route 66 , the famous highway (opened on Nov 11, 1926) that connects California and Chicago.Speaking on the sidelines of the Brand USA Travel Week India here, Fred Dixon, president and CEO of Brand USA, told TOI that the authorities also plan to make it easy for the spectators to get the US visa.“If you decide to buy tickets to the World Cup and you don’t have your visa yet, there actually is a way to facilitate that process to identify yourself as a ticket holder, and then the State Department will work to facilitate the visa processing faster,” Dixon said.Dixon was particularly excited to welcome the Indians travelling for the World Cup. “In places like New Jersey and New York, places like Atlanta and Dallas, Texas, those are obviously big communities. The communities will come to life through the fan fests in every host city. With more than 5 million Indians living in the US, traveling with or spending time with family will be a big component of that,” Dixon said.He also touched upon the use of AI to help with planning intineraries. “At americathebeautiful-.com, we actually have AI integration to help with trip inspiration, particularly when you are dealing with an event that is multi-city, multi-date,” said Dixon.","The World Cup 2026 matches in the US will be held in 2026.

Shivam Dube press conference: On Ishan and Surya’s knock & his role with the ball

RAIPUR: Two months ago, Ishan Kishan was nowhere close to getting into the Indian team. A little over a month ago, he brought himself back into contention after guiding Jharkhand to their maiden Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy title and finishing as the top-scorer in the tournament with a century in the final. The showing convinced selectors to include him in the T20 World Cup team. Luck continued to shine on the left-hander when he was slotted in at No. 3 in place of Tilak Varma, who was ruled out of the first three matches of the T20I series due to injury.While he failed in the opening match in Nagpur, on Friday, he displayed why he is one of the fiercest hitters of a cricket ball in the country. By the time the 27-year-old was done with his fireworks, he had hammered a 32-ball 76 with the help of 11 fours and four sixes, as India made a mockery of the 209-run target by chasing it down with seven wickets in hand and 4.4 overs to spare.On his way back, skipper Suryakumar, who was enjoying the blitzkrieg from the other end, acknowledged the effort put in by his former Mumbai Indians teammate by giving him a hug on his way back to the dugout. His seventh T20I halfcentury came at a strike rate of 237.5.India were in deep trouble when openers Sanju Samson and Abhishek Sharma were back in the pavilion in the first seven balls. But Kishan straightaway counterattacked to reverse the pressure on the Kiwi bowlers.Kishan and Suryakumar (82*, 37b; 9x4, 4x6) shared a 49-ball 122-run stand for the third wicket, and by the time the former’s innings ended in the 10th over, when Ish Sodhi dismissed him, the required run rate was below eight runs per over.Thereafter, India applied the finishing touches to take a 2-0 lead, and Suryakumar and Shivam Dube did exactly that with their unbroken 37-ball 81-run association for the fourth wicket to see the Men in Blue through. It was Suryakumar’s first halfcentury since the 75 he scored against Bangladesh in Hyderabad in Oct 2024. Dube played his part to perfection with his 18-ball 36.Earlier, New Zealand got off to a flying start, but the Indian bowling unit pegged them back with some smart bowling. The visitors got off to a cracking start, with Devon Conway (19, 9b; 3x4, 1x6) and Tim Seifert (24, 13b; 5x4), reaching 43/0 by the third over, but Harshit Rana (1/25) and Varun Chakravarthy (1/35) halted New Zealand in their tracks as they ensured both their openers return to the pavilion.",Ishan Kishan hits 76 as India beat New Zealand by seven wickets in Nagpur.

Shivam Dube press conference: On Ishan and Surya’s knock & his role with the ball

NEW DELHI: Indian skipper Suryakumar Yadav said the hosts want their batters to play with freedom and express themselves, praising Ishan Kishan ’s fearless strokeplay as a true reflection of the team’s mindset after India defeated New Zealand by seven wickets in the second T20I in Raipur on Friday.Despite some assistance from the dew, India’s chase of 209 began on a shaky note. Sanju Samson departed for 6, Abhishek Sharma fell for a golden duck, and the hosts were suddenly reeling at 6 for 2. What followed, however, was a breathtaking counterattack as Ishan Kishan and Suryakumar Yadav added 122 runs in just 48 balls for the third wicket, transforming what appeared to be a daunting chase into a comfortable one.Kishan did most of the early damage with his aggressive approach, scoring 76 off 32 balls, including a 21-ball fifty, before mis-hitting Ish Sodhi for a catch off the bowler’s own bowling. By then, the contest had already swung decisively in India’s favour.Suryakumar, meanwhile, finished with a superb 82 off just 37 balls, once again underlining his class and importance to the side only weeks ahead of a home T20 World Cup.""I didn't know what Ishan had for lunch. Never saw anyone hit the ball like he did. This is what we want from the batters to go out there and express themselves, be happy. I was angry he didn't give me a strike in the Power-play.But I knew that we had time and could cover up. I was batting really well in the nets, I got some good time with family and friends, and I am enjoying what's happening right now,"" Suryakumar Yadav said after the match.The emphatic finish also became the biggest win by balls remaining for a full-member nation while chasing a target of over 200. It surpassed Pakistan’s 24-ball win against New Zealand in Auckland in 2025 and Australia’s 23-ball victory over West Indies in Basseterre in the same year.India’s bowling, however, had its struggles. Arshdeep Singh endured a difficult outing, conceding 53 runs without a wicket. Hardik Pandya was more economical, returning figures of 1 for 25 from three overs, while Harshit Rana, despite bowling a wicket maiden, finished with 1 for 35 from three overs. The spin pair of Kuldeep Yadav and Varun Chakaravarthy combined for eight overs, claiming three wickets while giving away 70 runs. Shivam Dube also chipped in with a wicket.Suryakumar praised the collective bowling effort, admitting that India had feared New Zealand could push the total to 225–230, while singling out Kuldeep Yadav, Varun Chakaravarthy, Shivam Dube and Hardik Pandya for restricting the visitors to 208.""It was an incredible effort. We thought they would add 225-230. The way Kuldeep, Varun, Dube, and Hardik. Everyone took their responsibility, and to restrict them to under 210 was a great effort.""He also highlighted the relaxed and positive atmosphere within the camp, stressing that India remain committed to playing their brand of cricket while giving their all in every aspect.""I am really enjoying. The mood in the camp is happy. We want to play the same brand of cricket and leave no stone unturned.""",India defeated New Zealand by seven wickets in the second T20I in Raipur on Friday.

NEW DELHI: Singer-composer Palash Muchhal has publicly rejected the allegations levelled against him by actor-producer Vidnyan Mane, who has described himself as a childhood friend of Indian cricketer Smriti Mandhana . Mane has accused Muchhal of infidelity and financial wrongdoing, claiming he was duped of more than Rs 40 lakh in connection with an unreleased film project.Responding to the claims, Muchhal issued a statement on social media, strongly denying the accusations. ""In light of the allegations made by Sangli-based Vidnyan Mane on social media, I wish to state that these claims against me are entirely baseless and factually incorrect. They have been made with malicious intent to tarnish my reputation, and they will not go unchallenged. My lawyer, Shreyansh Mithare, is exploring all legal avenues, and this matter will be dealt with strictly through the appropriate legal channels,"" Muchhal wrote.Mane has since filed a formal complaint against Muchhal in Sangli, Maharashtra.In an interview with Hindustan Times, the 34-year-old made sensational claims, alleging that Mandhana and Muchhal’s relationship collapsed following an incident during wedding celebrations in November 2025. “I was at the wedding celebrations (November, 23, 2025) when he was caught red-handed with another woman in bed. Bhayanak scene tha, he was beaten up by the Indian female cricketers.The entire family is chindi chor. I thought he’d get married and settle in Sangli, but it has completely backfired on me.” Mane further claimed that he was introduced to Muchhal by the Mandhana family.Mane also accused the Muchhal family of exerting financial pressure on him over a stalled film project, alleging that he was forced to invest additional money to safeguard his earlier contribution. “When I met his mother (Amita Muchhal) last month, she said the budget to release the movie has now increased to Rs 1.5 crore. They asked me to invest another Rs 10 lakh or I wouldn’t get any money back. They started blackmailing me and threatened to throw me out of the film, thus I was forced to file a complaint,” he said.According to Mane, all communication ceased after the wedding was called off. “After the wedding was called off, the family blocked me from everywhere. I found out that other artistes from the movie had not received payment they were due to receive either. I had heard of directors fleecing producers in the film industry but this is complete theft,” he added.Mane also claimed to be in possession of evidence supporting his allegations. “I have saved all proofs including my chats and phone conversations that I’m willing to share with the police and the media,” he said.Muchhal reiterated his denial through an Instagram story, maintaining that the allegations were false and legally motivated.Mandhana and Muchhal were originally scheduled to get married on November 23, 2025. The wedding was initially postponed due to health-related issues in both families before being officially cancelled in December 2025.Following widespread speculation surrounding the split, both issued separate statements confirming the decision. Smriti said she wanted to “clarify that the wedding is called off” and requested privacy, while Muchhal stated, “I have decided to move on in my life and step back from my personal relationship. Its been very difficult for me to see people react so easily on baseless rumours about something which has been most sacred to me. Its the most difficult phase of my life and I will deal with it gracefully holding on to my beliefs.”","Actor-producer Vidnyan Mane has accused Palash Muchhal of infidelity and financial wrongdoing.

Shivam Dube press conference: On Ishan and Surya’s knock & his role with the ball

MUMBAI: Over the years, India’s T20 captain Suryakumar Yadav has won the hearts of millions of cricket fans and cricket experts with his brilliant, dynamic 360-degree strokeplay. There is also a quality of being ‘selfless’ to the core which has earned SKY massive respect amongst his younger teammates.On Friday, soon after he smashed a scintillating double century (227 off 219 balls) for Mumbai against a Hyderabad attack which included India pacer Mohammed Siraj in a Ranji Trophy match in Hyderabad, the highly consistent but unlucky Sarfaraz Khan acknowledged how SKY sacrificed his No. 3 spot for him during the Syed Mushtaq Ali T20 Trophy earlier this season, even though India’s T20 captain has himself been struggling with form. It was a gesture which Sarfaraz credited for sparking his remarkable turnaround, as he smashed a 47-ball century against Assam to trigger his resurgence in white-ball cricket after he had begun the season with a few low scores in the Ranji Trophy.“I hit Siraj for the biggest six of my life today (while batting on 180). The ball struck the second tier of the stadium and came back. I think I’m batting fearlessly now,” Sarfaraz told TOI from Hyderabad, before expressing his gratitude to Suryakumar.“Surya has played a massive role in how I turned around my form this season. When he came to play in SMAT, I hadn’t played in the first three matches. I only got a chance in the fourth match after Shivam Dube was injured.Surya made way for me to bat at No. 3. I scored an (unbeaten) 47-ball century, and from that day, my confidence and form have both gone upwards. I really want to thank Surya for giving me the chance to bat at No. 3 for Mumbai that day,” Sarfaraz said.“Five years back, Surya bhai gave me his No. 5 batting spot in the Mumbai team, and look where I am! And now, when I needed to bat at No. 3 as I wasn’t getting enough chances, he again gave me his spot,” he added.This isn’t the first time that Suryakumar has sacrificed his No. 3 spot. While captaining India, he had given the pivotal position to his talented Mumbai Indians batting colleague Tilak Varma—a fact acknowledged by the young left-hander when he smashed back-to-back centuries against South Africa while batting at the pivotal No. 3 spot in SA in Nov 2024.“Surya has seen how my father and I have worked since my childhood on my game. He has himself made it to the top through sheer hard work. This is why he is the Indian captain, because he puts others over himself. Surya is a fabulous captain because he thinks positively about the others in his team too,” gushed Sarfaraz while praising his ‘close friend.’In Feb 2024, it was Surya who had informed Sarfaraz’s father-cum-coach Naushad Khan to rush to Rajkot as Sarfaraz would be making his Test debut.Expressing his gratitude to SKY, Naushad told TOI, “Surya too needed to score runs in SMAT, as he hadn’t got a lot of runs in international cricket. If he wanted, he wouldn’t have done that for another cricketer. Sarfaraz needed to bat in the top four to prove his worth in T20 cricket. He was feeling down after being dropped from the first three matches, but didn’t look back after capitalising on that opportunity provided by Surya and has scored heavily in T20s after that. He was then rewarded for his tremendous form in SMAT when Chennai Super Kings picked him. I will remain thankful to Surya for this gesture,” said Naushad.Revealing why Suryakumar shares such a special bond with the Khans, Naushad recalled an incident. “Back in 2017, Surya was going through a lean patch and didn’t get many runs in the league phase of the Ranji Trophy, and was feeling low. He told me that he bats exactly like Sarfaraz, so he needed my help. I asked him to have a training session with me, during which we trained and saw a few of his videos. I told him a few things, and he slammed a century the next day—it was his first Ranji century that season. I think he feels gratitude for that help that day, and that’s why he keeps helping us.”Apart from passing on his No. 3 spot in the Mumbai batting line-up, Suryakumar also offered Sarfaraz some valuable advice, which helped the 28-year-old batter stage a sizzling white-ball turnaround this season, during which he scored 329 runs in seven matches with a strike rate of 203.08 and an average of 65.80 in SMAT.“Surya helped me a lot during SMAT. He exactly knows when to tell a player what. I used to play a lot of cheeky shots. Even I didn’t know that I could play so many good shots in front of the wicket. However, Surya gave me the confidence to do so. I scored a 47-ball century. After that, he left to play for Team India, so I became very nervous about my performance. However, his tips stayed with me and then I would keep talking to him on the phone. He just told me to work on things in which I was lacking, and that everything would be all right then. That really helped me,” Sarfaraz explained.Sarfaraz also thanked former India captain Mohammed Azharuddin for helping him cope with the reverse swing factor at Hyderabad. “I’ve played a lot of domestic cricket, but here in Hyderabad, it’s different because the ball starts reverse swinging after 18-20 overs. Azhar sir gave me a few tips on how to cope with reverse swing here,” Sarfaraz said.During the course of scoring his fifth double century in first-class cricket, Sarfaraz crossed the 5,000-run landmark in just his 61st first-class match. “I’m very happy to score 5,000 runs so early in my career. It’s a special moment. When I used to play at the Azad Maidan, I used to think that if I play in the Ranji Trophy, that would be a big achievement in life. Abbu used to tell me stories about Wasim Jaffer and Amol Muzumdar (domestic stalwarts). It’s not so easy to score so many runs in domestic cricket, playing home and away, so consistently,” Sarfaraz said.“Credit goes to my father for my fine form, because he makes me work hard. I’m doubly happy because I did so well in white-ball cricket, which I hadn’t done before, and earned an IPL contract too. I’ve made quite a few changes to my white-ball game, and in red-ball cricket, everyone knows my prowess—this is my fifth double century,” he concluded.","Suryakumar Yadav sacrificed his No. 3 spot for Sarfaraz Khan in the Syed Mushtaq Ali T20 Trophy earlier this season. The gesture has earned SKY massive respect amongst his younger teammates. ‘Surya is a fabulous captain because he thinks positively about the others in his team too,’ gushed the Mumbai batsman.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127371251,imgsize-38524,width-400,resizemode-4/sarfaraz-khan2-2401-x.jpg"

Bangladesh cricket in turmoil: What it means for the T20 World Cup?

Former Bangladesh Cricket Board general secretary Suyed Ashraful Haque has criticised the decision taken by the Bangladesh government and the BCB to pull out of the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup, calling it an unnecessary and damaging move.Speaking to ANI on Saturday, Haque said it was wrong to refuse participation in a global tournament over “security concerns” that, in his view, were linked to a Bangladeshi player being dropped from an IPL side. He said Bangladesh “has overplayed its hand in this matter” and warned that such decisions hurt the progress of the country’s cricket.Haque pointed out that the ICC replacing Bangladesh with Scotland was a normal and expected outcome. He said that when a team chooses not to take part, the ICC follows a standard process to bring in a replacement.“It was not right for Bangladesh to withdraw from the T20 World Cup just because a Bangladeshi player was not allowed to play in the IPL in India,” Haque told ANI.He added that comparisons between the IPL and the World Cup were misplaced. According to him, the IPL is a domestic competition, while an ICC event comes with far stricter and more comprehensive security arrangements.Haque said the decision to stay away from the tournament undermines the effort and hard work put into building Bangladeshi cricket over the years. “Bangladesh has overplayed its hand in this matter by choosing not to participate in the ICC T20 World Cup,” he said.On the Bangladesh government’s demand to shift the team’s matches to Sri Lanka, Haque said such a move was unrealistic. He stressed that ICC tournaments are planned well in advance and cannot be relocated at short notice. “Therefore, it couldn’t be transferred to Sri Lanka,” he said.Earlier on Saturday, the International Cricket Council confirmed that Scotland will replace Bangladesh in the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2026 after the BCB refused to participate as per the published schedule. The 20-team tournament is set to be played from February 7 to March 8.The ICC said the decision came after it rejected the BCB’s request to move Bangladesh’s matches out of India, citing the absence of any credible or verifiable security threat to the Bangladesh team.Following a meeting on Wednesday, the ICC Business Corporation Board asked the BCB to confirm within 24 hours whether the team would take part in the tournament as scheduled. When no confirmation was received within the deadline, the ICC moved ahead in line with its governance and qualification processes to identify a replacement side.In a release, the ICC said the decision followed an extensive process to address the concerns raised by the BCB about playing in India. “Over a period of more than three weeks, the ICC engaged with the BCB through multiple rounds of dialogue conducted in a transparent and constructive manner,” the statement said, adding that discussions took place both via video conference and in person.The ICC said it reviewed the concerns put forward by the BCB, commissioned independent security assessments from internal and external experts, and shared detailed security and operational plans. These included federal and state-level arrangements, along with enhanced and escalating security protocols for the event. The assurances were reiterated at several stages, including during meetings involving the IBC Board.“The ICC’s assessments concluded that there was no credible or verifiable security threat to the Bangladesh national team, officials or supporters in India,” the release said.The governing body said it decided against changing the schedule after considering the wider impact of such a move. “The ICC also noted the importance of preserving the integrity and sanctity of the tournament schedule, safeguarding the interests of all participating teams and fans, and avoiding the establishment of precedents that could undermine the neutrality and fairness of ICC events,” the statement said.Scotland, who now take Bangladesh’s place, are the highest-ranked T20I side that did not originally qualify for the tournament. They are currently ranked 14th in the world, ahead of Namibia, the United Arab Emirates, Nepal, the United States, Canada, Oman and Italy.","Former Bangladesh Cricket Board general secretary Suyed Ashraful Haque has criticised the decision taken by the Bangladesh government and the BCB to pull out of the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup.

Delhi Capitals kept their playoff hopes alive with a commanding seven-wicket victory over league leaders Royal Challengers Bengaluru on Saturday, handing RCB their first defeat of the Women’s Premier League season.Choosing to bowl first, DC put in a disciplined and well-executed performance to bundle RCB out for just 109 in their 20 overs. The modest target was then chased down comfortably, with Delhi reaching 111 for 3 in 15.4 overs and 26 deliveries to spare.The chase, however, did not begin smoothly for Delhi. Openers Shafali Verma and Lizelle Lee were dismissed cheaply, leaving DC struggling at 24 for 2 inside the fourth over. From there, captain Jemimah Rodrigues and Laura Wolvaardt steadied the innings with a crucial third-wicket stand that took the sting out of the contest.The pair added 52 runs, with Rodrigues scoring 24 off 26 balls, including four boundaries. Wolvaardt anchored the chase superbly, remaining unbeaten on 42 from 38 deliveries, striking four fours and a six. Marizanne Kapp then applied the finishing touches, scoring an unbeaten 19 off 15 balls and sealing the win with a boundary off Shreyanka Patil.For RCB, Sayali Satghare was the standout bowler with figures of 2 for 18, while Radha Yadav picked up one wicket.Earlier, RCB’s batting faltered despite a solid start from captain Smriti Mandhana , who top-scored with 38 off 34 balls, hitting six fours and a six. Radha Yadav’s 18 was the only other notable contribution as eight batters fell for single-digit scores. The opening stand of 36 between Mandhana and Grace Harris proved to be RCB’s highest partnership as they slipped from a steady position to 78 for 5 and were eventually bowled out.Nandani Sharma led DC’s bowling effort with 3 for 26, while Kapp, Minnu Mani and Chinelle Henry claimed two wickets each, and Shree Charani added one. The win lifted Delhi to second place with six points, while RCB remained on top with 10 points despite the loss.",Delhi Capitals beat Royal Challengers Bengaluru by seven wickets.

NEW DELHI: Bangladesh cricket faced another turbulent moment on Saturday as a senior Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) official resigned on the same day the team was officially removed from the 2026 T20 World Cup.Ishtiaque Sadeque, a BCB director and chairman of the Game Development Committee, stepped down hours after the ICC confirmed Scotland as Bangladesh’s replacement for the tournament.Sadeque cited personal and family reasons for his resignation. He said he could no longer give enough time to a role that demands full commitment. His exit comes at a sensitive time, with Bangladesh cricket already under heavy criticism following the World Cup controversy.""It is true that I am resigning. I believe that I am unable to dedicate the time required for such a large community like Game Development, where I am currently serving, because of my family and personal commitments. I cannot provide the effort necessary to accelerate Game Development. For this reason, I feel a personal sense of regret that I am not doing justice to this position. That is why I am resigning from here,"" Ishtiaque told Cricbuzz.Sadeque was elected as a BCB director from the Dhaka Clubs category in October last year.He secured the highest number of votes in his category, which made his sudden resignation even more surprising. His timing raised questions, as it came on the same day Bangladesh lost their World Cup spot.However, Sadeque denied that his decision had anything to do with internal disputes or the ICC issue.""The claim that I am leaving because of any misunderstanding, relationship issues with anyone on this board, or due to any hurt feelings or grievances, is completely false. Everyone who was with me tried their best in their own way,"" he said.He also backed his successor and said he would continue to support Bangladesh cricket from outside the board.""I believe that whoever succeeds me in Game Development will be able to take Bangladesh's cricket forward. They have my full support. Even though I will no longer be on the board-I mean, they will have my complete support. Thank you very much,"" he added.Earlier in the day, the ICC announced that Bangladesh had been replaced by Scotland for the T20 World Cup 2026.The decision followed Bangladesh’s refusal to play their scheduled matches in India. The BCB had demanded a shift to Sri Lanka, citing security concerns.The ICC said independent security reviews found no real threat in India and ruled out any schedule change.With no agreement reached after weeks of talks, the ICC chose to move ahead and bring in Scotland based on rankings.Scotland will now compete in Group C alongside England, West Indies, Italy and Nepal, starting their campaign on February 7 in Kolkata.","Ishtiaque Sadeque, a BCB director and chairman of the Game Development Committee, stepped down hours after the ICC confirmed Scotland as Bangladesh’s replacement for the tournament.

Bangladesh cricket in turmoil: What it means for the T20 World Cup?

Why was the schedule updated?

Here’s the updated ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2026 schedule:

ICC updated fixtures list

Why was Bangladesh removed?

The International Cricket Council (ICC) has unveiled an updated schedule for the 2026 Men’s T20 World Cup, set to be co-hosted by India and Sri Lanka from February 7. The revisions follow the unprecedented removal of Bangladesh from the tournament after the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) refused to travel to India, citing security concerns for players and officials.Scotland has now been invited to replace Bangladesh and has accepted the opportunity.Scotland will take Bangladesh’s place in Group C alongside England, Italy, West Indies, and Nepal. Originally, Bangladesh were scheduled to play West Indies (February 7), Italy (February 9), and England (February 14) in Kolkata, followed by a match against Nepal on February 17 in Mumbai. With the new arrangement, Scotland will face the same four teams on the same dates and venues.The ICC confirmed that only the team has changed; all other elements, including match dates, timings, and group structures, remain unchanged. No other fixtures have been affected.The ICC cited Bangladesh’s refusal to travel to India despite repeated assurances and independent security assessments showing no credible or verifiable threat to the team. The BCB had requested moving their matches to Sri Lanka, but the governing body declined such a change so close to the start of the tournament.An official ICC statement read: “The International Cricket Council has replaced Bangladesh with Scotland for the upcoming T20 World Cup because of an impasse over security concerns that Bangladesh raised about playing in India. In light of these findings, and after careful consideration of the broader implications, the ICC determined that it was not appropriate to amend the published event schedule.”The ICC also noted that the BCB did not respond to a 24-hour deadline to confirm participation, leaving the governing body no choice but to follow established procedures to select a replacement team.Over the past three weeks, ICC officials engaged with the BCB through multiple video and in-person meetings, sharing detailed security protocols and addressing concerns. Despite these efforts, Bangladesh remained firm in their stance, prompting the historic decision to replace them with Scotland.","The International Cricket Council has unveiled an updated schedule for the 2026 Men’s T20 World Cup, set to be co-hosted by India and Sri Lanka from February 7.

VILA-REAL: Kylian Mbappe netted twice to earn Real Madrid a 2-0 win at Villarreal on Saturday and take his side to the top of La Liga.Alvaro Arbeloa's team moved two points clear of arch-rivals Barcelona, who host bottom-of-the-table Real Oviedo on Sunday.La Liga's top scorer Mbappe reached 21 goals for the season in the competition to help Madrid see off a spirited Villarreal side, who are now fourth.Arbeloa's side have won three consecutive matches across all competitions and victory at Villarreal could be a vital step in the revival of their season.After the shock Copa del Rey defeat at second-tier Albacete in Arbeloa's first match at the helm just 10 days ago after replacing Xabi Alonso, his Madrid have started to take shape.The coach has made clear how important his star players are and none has been more crucial this season than French superstar Mbappe, who has netted 34 times across all competitions.Mbappe and Vinicius Junior ""are the best players in the world, they are players who can really unbalance teams, we try to get the ball to them as much as possible,"" Arbeloa told Real Madrid TV.""They're two players who... I'm really happy to have in this state of form and above all, because of the great work they are doing.""They are really committed to the team, they are the first who are pressing... they're giving this effort and solidarity that we need from them, so I'm very happy that their reward comes in the form of goals.""It was a lively but imprecise start at Villarreal's Estadio de la Ceramica, as the game glowed but neither side was able to seriously threaten.Georges Mikautadze lashed a volley narrowly wide after veteran forward Gerard Moreno found him with a floating cross.At the other end, Madrid midfielder Arda Guler fired straight at Villarreal stopper Luiz Junior after some tidy footwork, and then shot high over the bar at the end of a swift break.Villarreal's Juan Foyth limped off hurt in a blow for the hosts, who created a good chance for Pape Gueye just before the break.The Senegal midfielder, a champion at the Africa Cup of Nations last weekend, powered narrowly wide of the post.Vinicius, who excelled in Madrid's 6-1 Champions League rout of Monaco in midweek, also came close with a rasping effort that sailed across Luiz Junior's goal and wide.The 25-year-old Brazil forward went a 13th straight La Liga match without scoring, but was involved as Mbappe found the net two minutes into the second half.- 'Nightmare for defences' -Vinicius came into the box from the left flank and his low cross was blocked but Mbappe was on hand to squeeze home his 20th league goal of the campaign from close range.""They are a nightmare for defences,"" said Madrid goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois. ""I hope they can keep bringing joy.""Villarreal had the better of the second half as they worked hard to pull level, but Moreno spurned their best chance by firing inches over when well-placed.In stoppage time, Mbappe was felled clumsily by Alfonso Pedraza in the box and the French forward cheekily dinked home the resulting penalty to seal Madrid's victory.Mbappe's team-mate Brahim Diaz, who missed a similar attempted Panenka penalty for Morocco in the Africa Cup of Nations final, was on the pitch to see it as he returned to action for his club.""For you,"" Mbappe appeared to say to Diaz during the celebration, indicating it was a gesture of support.""For me, the most important thing is that (the players) are united, we saw it last Wednesday with Vinicius's goal (against Monaco) and we saw it again today, with Brahim,"" Arbeloa told reporters.The Yellow Submarine are now 10 points behind leaders Madrid, having played one fewer match than Arbeloa's side.""We have to be a bit more accurate in attack against these kinds of teams,"" admitted Villarreal midfielder Alberto Moleiro.Elsewhere, fifth-placed Espanyol fell to a 3-2 defeat at Valencia that left them seven points behind Villarreal.",Kylian Mbappe scores twice as Real Madrid beat Villarreal 2-0 in La Liga.

Having made a blockbuster €140 million move from Bayer Leverkusen to Anfield, Florian Wirtz has had a tricky start to life at Anfield and in the Premier League . Widely regarded as one of Europe’s most gifted creative attackers, the 22-year-old Germany international arrived at Liverpool on the back of a standout spell in Bundesliga, where his freedom, intelligence and ability to control games marked him out as a generational talent.In the 29 games he's played at Liverpool across competitions, he's scored four goals and provided seven assists.Before the eventual move to the Merseyside, there was interest also from Bayern Munich. But Wirtz’s decision to embrace the Premier League underlines both his ambition and belief in Liverpool’s long-term vision.In this wide-ranging exclusive conversation with TimesofIndia.com, facilitated by JioStar, Wirtz reflects on the pull of Liverpool’s history, the challenge of meeting sky-high expectations, and the clarity provided by the manager’s plans for the team.Liverpool's immense stature as a club first and foremost. The team that clinched the Premier League last year. Above all, the manager's vision convinced me.Tactics aren't much different from the Bundesliga or Germany duty.In-game, it's the physicality I need to adapt to most.They've had many great midfielders. I just focus on giving my best on the pitch. I don't know what sets me apart—whether I do better or they did. I simply want to play my game and achieve success with the club.Probably the first Newcastle game. It was wildly intense — the early red card, endless long balls, two-footed tackles, everything. The crowd went berserk. That moment made me think, 'This league is different from the Bundesliga.’I don't measure success in specific terms. I focus on delivering my best performance wherever I am — at Liverpool or with the national team—to be vital for the squad and drive achievements.

Route 66

Trump Booed Loudly As Miami Stadium Erupts During College Football Playoff

AI to help with planning itineraries

BENGALURU: For those who are preparing to pack their bags to watch the likes of Lionel Messi, Kylian Mbappe, and Lamine Yamal in any of the 11 American cities that will host the World Cup 2026 matches, the Americans are determined to make it football’s best ever showpiece event. Awaiting the fans are fast-tracked visas and curated experiences, including road trips to explore the heart of the US, Route 66 being the most famous of them.The US joins Mexico and Canada to host the FIFA World Cup, the games in the US will begin with the hosts taking on Paraguay in a Group D match in Los Angeles on June 12, day after the tournament kicks off in Mexico City. That will set football (soccer for Americans) rolling across 11 cities for the next one month. The Americans, who put American football, baseball and basketball, above the world’s most popular sport are keen to make it the biggest ever spectacle for the millions of fans offering them an unbelievable time.“From New York to Miami to LA and Seattle, it’s quite a diverse list of host cities. I think each of the host cities are excited to put on a great show, and really engage their communities because it is very much about the communities that are hosting as well.The fan fests are going to be a great way to go beyond the stadium into the community. Local food, culture, music, and engaging with local communities as well. It’s hard to describe how exciting it’s going to be. I think it's going to be beyond any of our expectations,” Fred Dixon, president and CEO of Brand USA, told TOI in an exclusive interview.Speaking on the sidelines of the Brand USA Travel Week India held here, Dixon said the authorities also plan to make it easy for the spectators to get the US visa. “If you decide to buy tickets to the World Cup and you don’t have your visa yet, there actually is a way to facilitate that process to identify yourself as a ticket holder, and then the State Department will work to facilitate the visa processing faster for those travelers,” Dixon said.Dixon was particularly excited to welcome the Indians travelling for the World Cup. “In places like New Jersey and New York, places like Atlanta and Dallas, Texas, those are obviously big communities. The communities will come to life through the fan fests and so there will be the official fan fest events for every host city. So you'll be in the communities with the locals or with your friends and the people you're traveling with. With more than 5 million Indians living in the US, seeking out and traveling with or spending time with family and friends will be a big component of that,” Dixon said.On whether there will be any relaxation for the fans from Haiti and Iran, Dixon didn’t have an answer. “You’d have to check with the State Department,” he said.For those millions who get entry into the US and the special ones who get lucky through the draw, FIFA said there were 500 million requests for tickets to watch the matches, the US wanted to wow them. On top of the list are the road trips including the iconic Route 66.“It’s a unique moment as well because it’s the 250th anniversary of America. So you have America, 250 activities happening all across the country as well. The other anniversary that’s happening this year is Route 66. It's the 100th anniversary of the famous highway (opened on Nov 11, 1926) that connects California and Chicago -- from Chicago to Santa Monica. It winds through small, interesting towns all across the west of the US. And so you’re going to see a lot of themes around road trips, that freedom of the open road in America. So I think there will be a lot of curated experiences around road trips,” said Dixon.“In the host cities themselves, you’re going to have lots of curated experiences, whether it relates to museums, art, exhibitions. The travelers are going to benefit from the focus on a lot of Americana, both historical, but also what American brands, I think, have meant to the world. The Fleet Week, which is one of the big celebrations in New York every year in the harbour, has been moved from what is normally in late May. It’s now moving to July 4th. So just imagine the Statue of Liberty with fireworks and all the Navy fleets, you know. It’s expected to have the largest gathering of tall ships in the world for America 250, which will travel up the east coast of the US. So there is an unlimited amount of curated experiences to have,” Dixon added.“At americathebeautiful.com , we actually have AI integration to help with trip inspiration, particularly when you are dealing with an event that is multi-city, multi-date. We know what the group schedule will be, but as teams advance beyond the group, who’s going to the quarterfinals, who’s going to the semifinals, how would you route yourself? The itineraries may be dynamic if you’re following a particular team. And so our new website has an AI component built into it to help with itinerary suggestions and plannings and ideas.“You also can integrate what your passion points are. So if it’s culture, if it’s history and food, it will help give you highlights and ideas for how you can route yourself. It’s not a booking platform, but it's an inspiration platform. We’ve used AI in a way to help tap into really what is the best of America, and then to inspire travelers to travel, you know, far and to travel deep when they're in the US to explore the World cup, specifically,” Dixon signed off.","The US joins Mexico and Canada to host the FIFA World Cup.

Jay Shah’s 2036 Olympic blueprint for India: '8 Medals won’t cut it'

NEW DELHI/KOLKATA: Former India and East Bengal defender Ilyas Pasha died on Thursday after a prolonged illness.He was 61. He is survived by his wife, two daughters, and two sons.The All India Football Federation (AIFF) condoled the death of Pasha, who was one of the best footballers to have come out of Karnataka.A committed and soft-spoken footballer, Pasha carved out a distinguished career in an area of the field that demanded resilience and composure - defence.Primarily operating as a right wing-back, he was renowned for his impeccable sense of timing, calm demeanour, and ability to read the game astutely.Rarely flustered under pressure, Pasha's disciplined positioning and well-judged tackles ensured that opposing left wingers found little joy on his flank, while goalkeepers behind him operated with added confidence.At the international level, Pasha made his senior India debut on January 27, 1987, against Bulgaria in the Nehru Cup at Kozhikode.He went on to earn eight international caps, featuring in two editions of the Nehru Cup (1987 and 1991), the 1991 SAF Games, and the 1992 Asian Cup qualifiers.Pasha began his football journey with Vinayaka Football Club, Vyalikaval, in north Bengaluru, where he also resided.His consistent performances soon earned him a move to Indian Telephone Industries in the mid-1980s, a period that marked his emergence at the national level.From 1987 onwards, he became a regular feature for Karnataka in the Santosh Trophy , representing the state at the tournaments held in Kolkata in 1987, Quilon (now Kollam) in 1988, and Guwahati in 1989.His performance in Guwahati stood out, as Karnataka narrowly missed out on a final berth. He also won two Santosh Trophy titles with Bengal in 1993 and 1995.On the back of his domestic exploits, Pasha was signed by Mohammedan Sporting, where he continued to enhance his reputation, winning the Sait Nagjee Trophy and the Nizam Gold Cup in 1989.He later joined East Bengal, a move that ushered in the most defining phase of his club career. Representing the iconic red and gold from the early 1990s through the end of the decade, Pasha became an integral part of one of the club's most successful eras.He captained East Bengal during the 1993-94 season and was a trusted figure under the late coach Subhas Bhowmick.With the Red and Gold Brigade, he won the Calcutta Football League on five occasions (1991, 1993, 1995, 1996 and 1998), the IFA Shield five times (1990, 1991, 1994, 1995 and 1997), and the Durand Cup four times (1990, 1991, 1993 and 1995).His trophy cabinet also included two Rovers Cups (1990, 1994), the Federation Cup (1996), the historic Wai Wai Cup in Kathmandu (1993), Airlines Trophy titles in 1990, 1992, 1995 and 1997, the Bordoloi Trophy (1992), ATPA Shield (1992), Kalinga Cup (1993), McDowell Trophy (1995, 1997), and the Super Cup in the 1996-97 season.He was also a member of East Bengal's celebrated triple crown-winning side in 1990 and captained the team to its first international title at the Wai Wai Cup in 1993.He also wore the captain's armband when East Bengal registered a sensational 6-2 victory over Iraq's Al Zawraa SC in the 1993-94 Asian Cup Winners' Cup.He got a special Lifetime Achievement Award from East Bengal in 2012.The AIFF said it has joined the Indian football fraternity in mourning the loss of Pasha, a defender of rare composure and consistency, to honour his lasting contributions to the game.In Kolkata, the East Bengal flag was kept at half-mast on the day, while the club's Under-16 team observed a minute's silence before training.Former East Bengal skipper Falguni Dutta, who played alongside Pasha for two years, remembered him fondly. ""I came to know early in the morning. I was shocked.""When I came to the club in 1997, I was a raw talent and he was there to guide me as a mentor. He played in the same position as me, but I never saw any jealousy in him. He was like an elder brother -- a guide and a coach. He inspired us,"" Dutta said.East Bengal Club bid a final farewell to Pasha at his Bengaluru residence.Working committee member Dipten Bose paid his respects, while former players Saravanan, Thomas and Feroz were also present.","Former India and East Bengal defender Ilyas Pasha dies at 61. Pasha was renowned for his impeccable sense of timing, calm demeanour, and ability to read the game astutely.

From Rs 275 crore to bare bones: AIFF faces a tough test to sell ISL broadcast rights,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/news/from-rs-275-crore-to-bare-bones-aiff-faces-a-tough-test-to-sell-isl-broadcast-rights/articleshow/127128213.cms,"With no takers for its first tender, the AIFF is scrambling to find a broadcaster for ISL 2025–26.

AIFF have no bargaining power

Time for recalibration

What does the current RFP say?

Poll What is your opinion on the AIFF's decision to issue a second Request for Proposal for ISL broadcast rights? It's a necessary step for improvement It shows a lack of planning It's too late to make a difference I have no opinion on this

Last week, the All India Football Federation (AIFF) floated a Request for Proposal (RFP) tender looking for a broadcast partner for the 2025-26 Indian Super League (ISL) season. This was the second time in six months that the AIFF had issued such a document as the first version, released in October 2025, demanded an annual minimum guarantee of Rs 37.5 crore. For a variety of reasons, that didn't find any takers.Ever since, Indian football is in a free fall.AIFF's deal with Football Sports Development Limited (FSDL), which had started the ISL in 2014, expired on December 8, 2025. Between AIFF Constitutional changes, court visits, lack of commercial partners and eventual intervention by the Sports Ministry, ISL has taken a massive hit to its credibility, even if it now has a start date in February 14.The fixtures for ISL 2025-26, which have been tucked away in the draft folder for days due to home venues being in shambles, add to the challenge for any prospective broadcast bidder(s).With 91 matches to be played in the upcoming truncated season in a single leg home-and-away format, this race against time only gets trickier with each passing day. The fact that AIFF have not officially appointed an agency to oversee the broadcast bids process doesn't bode well either.In 2021, the BCCI brought in audit, tax and financial advisory consultants KPMG to advise them on the media rights sale for the IPL. The objective was clear: earn 'top dollar.' It resulted in media rights for the IPL going at Rs 48,390.32 crore over five years - a 100 percent jump in value per match.AIFF, which has hardly showcased its competence in the past few months, is alone in this regard. Before FSDL stepped away, the ISL had a broadcast deal worth Rs 550 crore over two seasons with games showcased on linear TV and OTT. At first, ISL matches were broadcast on the Star Sports Network before moving to the Viacom18-owned Sports18/JioCinema.The Rs 275 crore-a-year deal was reportedly a 37.5 percent increase on what Star India, who had a majority stake in the ISL, had been paying in the first 10 years of the competition.This Rs 275 crore funded things such as match production, league marketing, revenue for the clubs and fixed payments to the federation. Despite this, FSDL posted losses of Rs 14.34 crore in FY23, Rs 46.3 crore in FY22, Rs 13.7 crore in FY21 and Rs 27 crore in FY20. The league only turned profitable when operations were scaled down, posting a net profit of Rs 45.2 crore in FY24.Now, in this post-FSDL era, AIFF and, by extension, the ISL clubs have little room to negotiate with any potential bidders. With the ISL set to be played in multiple cities, it adds to the costs involved with only Rs 9.77 crore budgeted for Production and Transmission. In the past, it hovered around Rs 70 crores.It means the quality output of the broadcast will be lower. Instead of multi-camera setups in different parts of the ground, one can expect 3-4 cameras, similar to the I-League coverage where equipment is placed at a high vantage point, behind the goal and near the half-way line.An ISL club official, who spoke to TimesofIndia.com on the condition of anonymity, said that organising the league in multiple cities could dissuade potential bidders. He also reminded that options are limited anyway, as February-March is also the period for the T20 World Cup in India and Sri Lanka, which JioStar will broadcast.The logic is simple: higher viewership means higher sponsorship for clubs and with an inferior product, that Rs 5-6 crore piece of the puzzle is going to take a hit. All clubs are braced for another year of red in their balance sheet. Even though many will cut costs operationally and have reduced player wages, the losses are expected to be three times the normal in the absence of commercial revenue.Like other aspects of the ISL including franchise fees and player salaries, the broadcast rights value also needs to be recalibrated for a healthier future. While this upcoming season can largely be logged as a stop-gap solution-finding exercise, the exercise towards an economically viable product needs to begin now. As ICC and BCCI have found out, mindless pricing of broadcast deals will drive away smaller players in the streaming space. And unlike sports like cricket and kabaddi - whose audience still consumes coverage on linear TV - football's young viewership exists on OTT.Subsequently, if players stay away due to pricing, it will further dwindle AIFF's options. Among the major broadcast players - on linear TV and digital - there are few options outside of JioStar and Sony Sports Network.AIFF's RFP for media rights of the ISL is a 39-page document that lays down the detailed eligibility framework for prospective bidders and specifies the timelines for bids to be submitted, examined and assessed.As per the schedule, the AIFF has fixed January 23 for a pre-bid meeting with interested parties, while any written queries or requests for clarification may be addressed by up to January 27.Bids must be submitted no later than 5:00 pm IST on February 1, with each submission accompanied by a security deposit of Rs. 5 lakh.Eligibility conditions require bidders to be broadcasters or internet operators with a minimum of three years’ operational experience.In addition, bidders must have recorded a net worth of at least Rs. 10 crore in the most recent financial year (2024–25) and an average annual revenue of no less than Rs. 10 crore across the last three completed financial years — 2022–23, 2023–24 and 2024–25.In the case of consortium bids, a maximum of three entities may come together under a special purpose vehicle (SPV). One member must be designated as the ‘Lead member’ and hold at least a 51 percent equity stake in the SPV’s paid-up and subscribed share capital.Each bid will be evaluated in two components — Technical and Financial — carrying weightages of 70 percent and 30 percent respectively. The bidder securing the highest overall score will be awarded the rights for the forthcoming season.","The All India Football Federation (AIFF) floated a Request for Proposal (RFP) tender looking for a broadcast partner for the 2025-26 Indian Super League (ISL) season.

France’s sports minister on Tuesday said the country's government is not considering, as of now, a boycott of the 2026 football World Cup in the United States, despite rising political tensions linked to US President Donald Trump’s remarks on Greenland.""At the moment we are speaking, there is no desire from the ministry to boycott this major, much-anticipated competition,"" sports minister Marina Ferrari told reporters, as cited by news agency Associated Press""That said, I am not prejudging what might happen.""Ferrari said she wants sport to remain separate from politics.""The 2026 World Cup is an extremely important moment for all sports lovers,"" she said.The men’s World Cup is scheduled to begin in June and will be jointly hosted by the United States, Canada and Mexico. However, tensions have grown after Trump expressed interest in taking control of Greenland, a territory linked to Denmark, which is a Nato ally. The remarks have raised concerns about relations between the US and European countries.In France, left-wing lawmaker Eric Coquerel said the idea of a boycott should be discussed.""Seriously, can we really imagine going to play the footie World Cup in a country that attacks its neighbors,' threatens to invade Greenland, undermines international law, wants to torpedo the UN,"" he wrote in a social media post.""The question seriously arises, especially since it is still possible to refocus the event on Mexico and Canada,"" he added.France, who won the men’s World Cup in 1998 and 2018, finished runners-up in the 2022 tournament after losing the final to Argentina.","France’s sports minister on Tuesday said the country's government is not considering, as of now, a boycott of the 2026 football World Cup in the United States.

NFL hands down fines Dee Winters and Deommodore Lenoir after Seahawks rout

The NFL dropped the hammer on the San Francisco 49ers after their messy divisional-round loss to the Seattle Seahawks. Adding fuel to the fire, the NFL fined LB Dee Winters and CB Deommodore Lenoir for separate on-field violations during the blowout defeat. The announcement capped a brutal weekend for San Francisco, turning a forgettable playoff exit into a costly lesson on discipline and how fast mistakes ruin January football.The punishment stems from a game the 49ers would erase if they could. Seattle dominated from the opening kickoff, cruising to a 41–6 win that exposed San Francisco on both sides of the ball. According to Newsweek, the NFL released its weekly fines report on Jan. 24, confirming that Winters and Lenoir were each penalized for plays in the third quarter.Winters was fined $5,907 for a hip-drop tackle at the 4:01 mark. The league has made that technique a point of emphasize, viewing it as a safety risk that can trap ball carriers' legs under a defender's weight. Lenoir's punishment was far steeper. He was docked $20,944 for the use of a helmet after head-butting Seahawks wide receiver Jaxson Smith-Njigba at the 10:05 mark of the same quarter.Per the NFL norms, a hip-drop tackle is when a player ""grabs the runner with one or both hands or wraps the runner with both arms"" and then ""unweights himself by swivelling and dropping his hips and/or lower body, landing on and/or trapping the runner's leg(s) at or below the knee.""After the game, Deommoddore Lenoir said, ""To have those guys, [it would have been] a totally different game. But I mean we can't make no excuses. We had enough guys in here to get the job done.""Those brief descriptions carried real financial weight. For Winters, the fine came despite a productive outing. He led the team with nine tackles, added three tackles for loss, recorded a QB hit, and allowed 26 yards on three receptions in coverage. Lenoir, meanwhile, had a solid coverage day statistically, surrendering just one catch for four yards on two targets, per Pro Football Focus.Still, numbers couldn't mask the larger story. The 49ers had only 236 total yards and 3 turnovers. Brock Purdy threw for 140 yards with an interception. Christian McCaffrey was bottled up all night. In that matter, the fines symbolized a loss of control as much as individual errors.For the 49ers, the NFL decision closed the book on a season-ending collapse. The fines won't change the results, but they underline how slim the margin is in the playoffs, and how fast frustration can turn expensive when discipline slips.","NFL fines 49ers Dee Winters and Deommodore Lenoir for missed infractions in Seahawks playoff win.

Jonathan Owens and Bears’ season ends in the divisional round as Simone Biles documented the matchup



The Chicago Bears’ season ended in overtime, and the moment landed hard inside the locker room and beyond it. As the playoff run closed for safety, Jonathan Owens and Simone Biles stayed present, steady, and visible. Her response after the loss showed a quieter form of support, one that focused on the reality of how an NFL season ends.Biles has attended Bears games throughout the season, often sharing game-day looks and stadium moments on social media. This time, the focus shifted from appearance to emotion. What she posted after the loss connected directly to the abrupt nature of playoff football, where months of work end in a single night.Chicago’s playoff run ended on January 18, 2026, with a 20-17 overtime loss to the Los Angeles Rams at Soldier Field. Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford passed for 258 yards. Kyren Williams rushed for 87 yards and scored two touchdowns. Kicker Harrison Mevis hit the walk-off field goal in overtime to send Los Angeles to the NFC Championship.The loss closed a breakthrough season for the Bears. Under first-year head coach Ben Johnson, Chicago went 11-6, won the NFC North for the first time since 2018, and reached the playoffs for the first time in 15 years.Owens played a steady role in the secondary during the run.Two days later, on January 21, Biles posted a TikTok titled “editing the last playoff game like a reality show.” The video featured raw stadium audio, sideline reactions, and unedited moments from the night. There was no background music and no added effects. The clip focused on pauses, reactions, and the silence that follows a season-ending loss.The post stood out because it reflected the emotional shift that comes after playoff elimination. Instead of celebration, the video showed waiting, watching, and processing the result. It captured what players and families face once the season ends.Earlier, on game day, Biles had shared her preparation before kickoff. On January 18, she posted a step-by-step TikTok from Chicago, detailing her hairstyle and outfit choice for the cold weather at Soldier Field. She finished the look with a light balayage wig and winter-ready styling.After the loss, the content changed. The tone became restrained and reflective. For Owens, the season ended on the field.

(Getty Images)

Mike McCarthy’s signing fuels rumors of Aaron Rodgers’ possible return to the Steelers’ roster



Heading into the 2025 season, hopes were higher than ever for Pittsburgh Steelers fans. The arrival of Aaron Rodgers , one of the NFL ’s most decorated quarterbacks, promised to end years of inconsistent play after Ben Roethlisberger’s retirement. Rodgers was thrilled to join Mike Tomlin’s squad, but the season exposed cracks in the offense. A 10-7 record earned them a division title, yet a devastating 30-6 home playoff loss to Houston left fans and players stunned.After Tomlin stepped down, Rodgers’ future in Pittsburgh seemed uncertain. Reports suggested he had little desire to return without the coach who recruited him. However, Saturday’s announcement changed the narrative. Mike McCarthy, Rodgers’ former Super Bowl-winning coach with Green Bay, is now leading the Steelers. Their shared history, including a championship win against the very Steelers franchise 15 years ago, opens the door to a potential reunion.While Rodgers has not officially decided whether to retire or chase another Super Bowl ring, McCarthy’s arrival could sway him. “Perhaps hoping to convince Rodgers to come back for another season, the Steelers hired his former coach,” sources reported.The new coaching setup promises a fresh approach, especially after Arthur Smith’s departure. Smith had overseen the offense for the last two seasons, during which Rodgers struggled, ranking 23rd in ESPN’s QBR.A revamped offensive scheme under McCarthy might reignite Rodgers’ interest. With the Steelers lacking a premium draft pick in 2026 and the quarterback class expected to be weak, one more season with Rodgers could bridge the gap until the deeper 2027 class, featuring prospects like Arch Manning, Dante Moore, and Julian Sayin, becomes available.Although the signing is not officially a tactic to lure Rodgers back, the circumstances align. McCarthy and Rodgers share history, trust, and a potential blueprint for success. If Rodgers chooses to return, it could give Pittsburgh a final shot at redemption while providing the veteran QB one more chance to leave his mark on the league.","Mike McCarthy’s signing fuels rumors of Aaron Rodgers’ possible return to the Steelers’ roster.

NIL earnings: ~$1.9 million







Rookie contract (cash + signing bonus): ~$1 million–$1.2 million in 2025







Dillon Gabriel has leveled up by being officially in the NFL with the Cleveland Browns. Naturally, fans are curious about his financial glow-up. While no one’s released an exact net worth number for 2025, we do know about his rookie contract and college NIL deals which together paint a pretty clear picture of his early career earnings.

For Dillon, it meant a strong financial head start while still making highlights on the field.Now for the big league numbers. Dillon signed a four-year rookie contract worth about $6.2 million, including a $1.16 million signing bonus. His base salary in 2025 is roughly $840,000, with cap hits and other bonuses adding up along the way.Basically, Gabriel is starting his pro career with a solid financial foundation. Combine that with his NIL earnings, and he’s already in the low millions before even playing a full NFL season.Here’s the thing: no one knows Dillon Gabriel’s exact net worth yet. Official sources like Forbes or Celebrity Net Worth haven’t published a number so everything online is just speculation.What weknow is verifiable:Combine those, and Gabriel’s early-career income is likely in the low single-digit millions. That’s a pretty solid start for a QB just entering the NFL.Looking ahead, Dillon could see his income rise fast. More NFL starts, performance bonuses, and future endorsement deals could add serious digits.

Travis Hunter’s viral wallet scare reveals unexpected hero as wife Leanna helps recover crucial documents,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/travis-hunters-viral-wallet-scare-reveals-unexpected-hero-as-wife-leanna-helps-recover-crucial-documents/articleshow/127442357.cms,"Travis Hunter’s lost wallet saga goes viral after wife Leanna intervenes (Instagram)

Travis Hunter’s lost wallet saga goes viral after wife Leanna intervenes



The Travis Hunter lost wallet incident surfaced as a quiet act of honesty before turning into a loud social media moment. A Jacksonville Jaguars rookie misplaced his wallet in Florida, unaware that a stranger would find it and return it intact. What followed was not a celebration of goodwill but a debate about gratitude, access, and expectations when fame enters everyday life.The woman who found the wallet did the right thing without hesitation. She contacted the proper channel, and Hunter’s wife, Leanna Lenee, personally collected the items and expressed her thanks. For most people, that would have been the end of the story. Instead, it became the beginning of what online users now call the “Wallet Saga.”The Florida woman, known as Brooks Cassandra on X, made it clear that the thank you she received felt incomplete. Her stance was direct and public. She wrote on X:“I’m still waiting on Travis Hunter to say thank u hisself everyone said thank u but him.”That single post shifted the tone. Supporters argued that her honesty deserved personal recognition from Hunter himself. Critics pushed back, suggesting the demand crossed into attention seeking.The phrase “clout vs. etiquette” quickly gained traction, splitting fans into camps.According to online reactions, Cassandra felt that “the thank-you from Hunter’s wife doesn’t quite cut it.” She added that “Hunter personally acknowledging her honesty would be the proper closure for the situation.” Those words fueled the argument further, raising a larger question. Does fame come with an obligation to respond to every good deed personally?Hunter has stayed silent so far. The timing matters. The Jaguars rookie is recovering from knee surgery after suffering a torn lateral collateral ligament late in October. He remains focused on rehab, with hopes of returning for the 2026 season. That context has softened criticism from some corners.Away from the noise, Hunter’s life has changed rapidly. After finishing his college career with Colorado, he was selected second overall by Jacksonville. He married Leanna in May, and the couple welcomed their first child shortly after. Leanna shared her emotions publicly, writing:“On 02/26/2022 you first asked me to be your girlfriend,” Leanna wrote in May. “Now 3.5 years later, on 05/24/2025, I became your wife. You make me the happiest woman on this planet and I am so excited to spend forever with you. However, they only revealed the update one month after the birth actually took place.”Recently, Hunter posted family photos from a Hawaii vacation, smiling alongside his wife and newborn. The images showed calm, not controversy.Whether Hunter eventually responds or not, the wallet saga reveals how small moments can grow when celebrity meets expectation. In the end, the lost wallet was returned. The larger question of what gratitude should look like in the public eye remains unanswered.","Jacksonville Jaguars rookie Travis Hunter misplaced his wallet in Florida.

Bad Bunny won’t wear a dress at Super Bowl, insiders clarify amid explosive halftime show buzz



Bad Bunny Super Bowl Halftime Show plans are coming into sharper focus as game day inches closer, and one rumor has now been put to rest. With the performance set for February 8 in Santa Clara, online chatter suggested the global star might make a bold fashion statement that would dominate headlines before he even hit the stage. That speculation traveled fast, fueled by social media and the already charged response to his selection as the headliner.Behind the scenes, however, the story looks far less dramatic. Sources tied to the production say the chatter missed the mark, shifting attention back to the music and the spectacle rather than wardrobe shock value. As anticipation builds, the conversation around Bad Bunny keeps revealing how deeply culture, politics, and pop collide on the Super Bowl stage.Despite widespread claims, Bad Bunny will not wear a dress or gown during his Super Bowl Halftime Show. Production sources have confirmed that he is skipping any dress fitting because such an outfit was never part of the plan, according to a TMZ report. While details about his final look remain under wraps, insiders were clear that the viral rumor does not reflect reality.The news drew mixed reactions from those who had weighed in publicly.Celebrity stylist and The Real Housewives of Atlanta star Miss Lawrence had previously voiced support for the idea, saying she would welcome the choice if it carried meaning and pride. Her comments added another layer to the discussion, highlighting how fashion at the Super Bowl often becomes a symbol far beyond fabric and fit.The outfit debate unfolded alongside broader backlash aimed at the NFL for selecting Bad Bunny as the halftime performer. Conservative group Turning Point USA even pledged to stage an alternative show with English-speaking artists, framing the booking as a cultural flashpoint rather than a musical one.That criticism reached the highest levels of politics. President Donald Trump addressed the topic in an Oval Office interview with the New York Post, making his feelings clear. “I’m anti-them. I think it’s a terrible choice. All it does is sow hatred. Terrible,” Trump said. He later explained that distance, not the performers, would keep him away from the game, adding, “It’s just too far away. I would. I’ve [gotten] great hands [at] the Super Bowl. They like me,” and, “I would go if, you know, it was a little bit shorter.”As kickoff approaches, criticism is expected to continue. Still, when Bad Bunny takes the stage, the spotlight will likely return to his sound, not a dress that was never there.","Despite widespread claims, Bad Bunny will not wear a dress or gown during his Super Bowl Halftime Show.

Old comments from Mike McCarthy’s wife hint why the new Steelers coach will thrive in Pittsburgh



Mike McCarthy Steelers talk has shifted from rumor to real momentum, and inside league circles the expectation feels settled. Pittsburgh appears ready to hand its future to a coach who knows the weight of tradition and the cost of patience. After a playoff exit and a rare split with Mike Tomlin, the Steelers are no longer searching for stability. They are chasing urgency, clarity, and a leader who can win now.For a franchise that measures success in banners, not rebuilds, the decision signals intent. Pittsburgh does not want a reset button. It wants a fast recalibration. McCarthy fits that brief. He brings a Super Bowl ring, nearly two decades of head coaching experience, and a deep personal tie to the city. This move is about trust and timing, not nostalgia.There is also a quieter reason this pairing feels natural. Years before this opening appeared, McCarthy’s wife, Jessica Kress, described what truly grounds him when the stadium lights go dark. That personal detail now feels timely, almost predictive, as Pittsburgh offers both professional pressure and the personal calm McCarthy values.Jessica Kress once explained her husband’s idea of peace in a revealing moment that showed the man behind the headset.“That’s Mike’s happy place. The lake and the boat. Just being with everybody. He’s very much a family man. He’s funny, and he’s a teddy bear. He’s just got a heart of gold. He loves to just watch movies and hang with the kids. He just loves being with everybody when he’s home and never talks (about work), even after a loss. He’s never negative,” Jessica said in December 2023.With Moraine State Park, Lake Arthur, and the Three Rivers nearby, McCarthy will find the balance he values. That matters in a city where football pressure never fades.The urgency driving this hire comes straight from ownership. Art Rooney II made it clear that waiting is not an option.“I’m not sure why you waste a year of your life not trying to contend,” Rooney said. “Obviously, your roster is what it is, changes every year. And so you deal with what you have every year, try to put yourself in a position to compete. Sometimes you have the horses, sometimes you don’t, but I think you try every year. We’ll try to compete day one if we can.”McCarthy understands that demand. He once beat Pittsburgh on the sport’s biggest stage in Super Bowl XLV. He also knows that the patience he received in Dallas will not follow him here.There is intrigue too. McCarthy grew up in Pittsburgh and now could coach the team he watched as a kid. He would become only the fourth Steelers head coach since 1969, bringing rare continuity at a moment of change.Questions remain, including whether Aaron Rodgers might be tempted to reunite with his former coach in 2026. Rodgers once said McCarthy was among the few coaches he would play for again. For now, Pittsburgh’s focus is simpler. Win early. Compete immediately. Anything less will not be enough.","Mike McCarthy is the new head coach of the Pittsburgh Steelers. The move is about trust and timing, not nostalgia. Pittsburgh does not want a reset button.

The spotlight around Deion Sanders has never been small, but recent revelations show the cost of that visibility. Speaking directly to his players, the Colorado head coach shared a reality that extends far beyond wins and losses. It was not about football. It was about safety.In a moment that stunned many, Sanders explained why security protocols around the program are taken so seriously. What followed was a blunt reminder of the pressures that come with fame, race, and leadership in modern sports.In a YouTube video released by his son, Deion Jr., Sanders addressed his team after his head of security, Michael Rhodes, spoke about access rules at the facility. Sanders then revealed the reason behind those precautions.“We get death threats all the time,” Sanders said. “Why? I’m a Black man making it happen, making things move, making all that happen. So we have stuff that’s real.”He then asked Rhodes to share how often those threats arrive. “About five every day,” Rhodes said.Rhodes, a former police officer who previously worked at Jackson State, warned players to be careful about who they allow into the building.He stressed that no one should be pressured into scanning unauthorized individuals inside, noting that many people are trying to get close to Sanders.The revelation comes during a challenging stretch for the Buffaloes. Sanders led Colorado to a 3–9 record in the 2025 season, his worst since taking over the program. His first year ended 4–8, followed by a strong 9–4 campaign in 2024.Even though Sanders has had trouble on the field, his impact is clear. People still pay attention to him, support him, and criticize him in equal measure.The comments led to a bigger discussion about the dangers that famous Black sports leaders face, not just in football. Sanders didn't see himself as a victim. He instead made the issue seem real.For his players, the message was clear. Success brings opportunity, but it also brings responsibility. And sometimes, it brings danger that never shows up on a scoreboard.","Deion Sanders revealed that he receives multiple death threats every day while leading the Colorado football program.

Stroud’s latest playoff loss has sparked a bizarre online theory linking his struggles to a so-called Kim Kardashian curse.

Derrick Lewis blames Kim Kardashian and Amber Rose for C.J. Stroud’s playoff struggles

The Houston Texans’ playoff exit did more than end a season. It opened the door to frustration, finger-pointing, and now superstition. After another divisional round loss, discussion around C.J. Stroud has drifted far beyond film breakdowns and protection schemes. Instead, a surprising theory has taken center stage, one that blends celebrity culture with football failure.As emotions spilled online, one outspoken voice turned a disappointing night into a viral debate. UFC heavyweight Derrick Lewis offered an explanation few saw coming, and fans quickly latched onto it.Following the Texans’ 28-16 loss to the New England Patriots, Stroud’s performance drew heavy scrutiny. He completed 20 of 47 passes, threw four interceptions, and struggled to regain control as the game slipped away. One of those interceptions was returned for a touchdown, tilting momentum firmly toward New England.As criticism mounted, Derrick Lewis shared his take, pointing not to play calling or pressure, but to off-field associations. “We've got to see what's going on with CJ,” Lewis said. “Ever since we seen him turn up with Amber Rose at the softball game a few years ago, and Kim Kardashian, I'm like...it might be a curse for him.”The comment spread quickly, igniting debate across social media. Some fans laughed it off as superstition. Others leaned into the idea, questioning whether distractions and spotlight pressure have followed Stroud into big moments. The names mentioned, Kim Kardashian and Amber Rose, only fueled the viral reaction.Beyond the noise, the loss raised familiar concerns. Under head coach DeMeco Ryans, the Texans have now exited the playoffs in the divisional round three straight seasons. The franchise still has never reached a conference championship game.On the other sideline, Patriots quarterback Drake Maye delivered three touchdown passes and steady control, guiding New England to its first AFC title game appearance in seven years.Whether Lewis’ theory is dismissed or debated, it reflects a fan base searching for answers. For the Texans, the pressure is no longer just about progress. It is about finally breaking a cycle that refuses to end.",The Houston Texans lost 28-16 to the New England Patriots in the divisional round. Quarterback C.J. Stroud threw four interceptions.

Viewers questioned the unusual timing of her banishment, her limited challenge participation, and the Secret Traitor twist, leading some to believe her departure was planned. While producers face backlash, Kelce has publicly praised the experience, calling it unforgettable despite the controversy.

Fans question whether Donna Kelce’s Traitors exit was planned

Donna Kelce’s short run on reality television was over almost as quickly as it began, but the reaction has only grown louder. Her early exit from The Traitors stunned viewers and immediately sparked online theories that something bigger was happening behind the scenes. The timing felt strange. The vote felt rushed. And fans noticed everything.As discussion spread across social media, a growing group of viewers began questioning whether the outcome was truly organic. The speculation has now turned Donna Kelce’s departure into one of the most debated moments of the season.Donna Kelce, the mother of Jason Kelce and Travis Kelce , was eliminated in a surprise third-episode banishment before she was formally revealed as the season’s Secret Traitor. That alone raised eyebrows. Fans quickly began piecing together what they saw as clues.In a widely shared Instagram video, user @shelby_g_t_laid suggested Kelce may have agreed to a short three-episode contract that lined up with her departure. Others pointed to her limited involvement in physically demanding challenges, including sitting out a chariot race, as possible evidence producers were managing her participation.The vote itself fueled even more suspicion. Instead of the usual nighttime banishment, host Alan Cumming announced an extra vote after breakfast. Kelce was sent home almost unanimously. “1000% planned. Too obvious,” one fan commented, while another said the episode “felt really strange,” adding that the game appeared to settle once Kelce was eliminated.Not everyone agrees. Some viewers argued Kelce was simply “bad at the game,” while others noted the Secret Traitor twist previously appeared on the U.K. version of the show.Behind the scenes, producers may already be rethinking the format.

Why fans believe Cardi B could join Bad Bunny on the Super Bowl stage

Rumors surrounding the Super Bowl Halftime Show happen in real time, yet this year the buzz about the Act feels that it is at an even higher pitch. Since the anticipation of Bad Bunny performance continues to rise, the name of one artist dominates the discussion of fans. Cardi B . It is the very thought that has placed the social media in overdrive, and listeners take apart previous collaborations, stage chemistry, and timing, which suddenly feels too good to pass at all.Bad Bunny getting a headlining position is already a significant cultural event. Being the first solo Latino artist to host the halftime performance, the expectation is high. The fans are not looking forward to the performance. They are waiting till someone says something. It is that expectation which has started the whispers of a surprise appearance flying so rapidly.The theory did not appear out of thin air. Bad Bunny and Cardi B share a proven hit that still dominates playlists years later. “I Like It” remains one of the most recognizable crossover tracks of the last decade, blending cultures, sounds, and audiences in a way few songs ever manage. For many fans, it already feels tailor made for a stadium moment.Cardi B’s reputation only fuels the speculation. She brings explosive energy, sharp crowd control, and an ability to turn any stage into a headline moment. Pairing that with Bad Bunny’s global appeal feels less like wishful thinking and more like strategic brilliance.Fans argue the collaboration would honor the history of the song while amplifying the cultural weight of the halftime show itself.Still, nothing is confirmed. Neither Bad Bunny nor Cardi B has addressed the rumors. The NFL has remained silent, which only adds fuel to the speculation. That silence has become part of the excitement.Whether the rumor proves true or not, one thing is already clear. The Super Bowl Halftime Show is shaping up to be one of the most talked about performances in years. And if Cardi B does step onto that stage alongside Bad Bunny, the moment will not just trend. It will define the night.","Fans are buzzing with speculation that Cardi B could make a surprise appearance during Bad Bunny’s Super Bowl halftime show.

Will Josh Allen join Hailee Steinfeld at the Oscars? NFL calendar clears as Sinners dominates nominations,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/will-josh-allen-join-hailee-steinfeld-at-the-oscars-nfl-calendar-clears-as-sinners-dominates-nominations/articleshow/127391780.cms,"The Oscars arrive on March 15, 2026, with Sinners making history after earning a record 16 nominations, including Motion Picture of the Year. Hailee Steinfeld is expected to attend, and with no NFL games in March, speculation has grown over whether Josh Allen could join her, even as he navigates MVP buzz and ongoing Bills turmoil.

Will Josh Allen walk the Oscars red carpet with Hailee Steinfeld?

Hollywood and football found themselves sharing the spotlight this week as two very different award conversations unfolded almost at once. With the Oscars set for March 15, 2026, excitement is already building in Los Angeles, especially with Conan O’Brien confirmed as this year’s host. The nominations alone delivered a moment that reshaped expectations across the film industry.At the center of that moment stands Sinners, the breakout film starring Hailee Steinfeld and Michael B. Jordan. The project did not just earn attention. It made history. As awards chatter grows, the timing also creates a rare crossover moment between Hollywood celebration and NFL uncertainty.Sinners emerged as the most nominated film in Oscar history, collecting 16 nominations, including Motion Picture of the Year. That number pushed past the long-standing record of 14 nominations held by All About Eve, Titanic, and La La Land. The achievement signals more than awards buzz. It marks the film as a cultural force that will dominate the ceremony.Steinfeld, who portrays Mary, is expected to attend, and the calendar makes it easy. March brings no NFL conflicts, clearing the way for a full cast presence on Hollywood’s biggest night.The Oscars arrive weeks after the Super Bowl, leaving no overlap between football obligations and red carpet appearances.While Hollywood celebrated, football news moved in a different direction. As Oscar nominations were announced, Josh Allen was named a finalist for the NFL Most Valuable Player award. The honor will be presented at NFL Honors on February 5, though Allen is considered a long shot. Matthew Stafford currently leads the race, even as Allen earns his third straight nomination.Back in Buffalo, uncertainty clouds the future. The Bills recently dismissed head coach Sean McDermott, and a press conference led by owner Terry Pegula and general manager Brandon Beane failed to calm fan frustration. As Hollywood is about to celebrate, Western New York is about to brace up to change in the way fortunes could change across different industries at an identical instance.","Sinners is the most nominated film in Oscar history, collecting 16 nominations, including Motion Picture of the Year.

“She is worth millions”: Gisele Bündchen’s post–Tom Brady chapter raises family concerns,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/she-is-worth-millions-gisele-bndchens-posttom-brady-chapter-raises-family-concerns/articleshow/127390825.cms,"Gisele Bündchen’s recent marriage to Joaquim Valente has reportedly raised quiet concerns within her family following her high-profile divorce from Tom Brady. While Bündchen appears happy in her new chapter, sources suggest loved ones worried about timing, finances, and long-term security as she moved forward after ending her marriage to the NFL legend.

Family concerns linger behind Gisele Bündchen’s new marriage

Gisele Bündchen has always moved on her own terms, but her latest life choice is quietly stirring tension behind the scenes. While the supermodel appears content after marrying jiu-jitsu instructor Joaquim Valente, those closest to her are reportedly far less convinced the decision was the right one.The concern is not about love alone. It is about balance, money, and timing. Sources familiar with the situation say the marriage raised eyebrows within her family, especially given the vast gap between Bündchen’s fortune and Valente’s finances.According to Page Six, relatives cautioned Bündchen before she walked down the aisle. “Her family warned her that marrying a penniless guy when she is worth millions is a mistake,” a source told the newspaper. The warning reportedly came as the couple prepared to wed in Florida last December, following the birth of their son earlier in 2025.Bündchen, now 45, is estimated to be worth around $400 million following decades of modeling success and global brand deals. She first crossed paths with Valente when she enrolled her son Benjamin in classes at the jiu-jitsu academy he co-owns in North Miami Beach. Over time, she joined the training herself, and by mid-2023, their relationship became public.The decision to marry, however, may not have been universally encouraged. “Her family told her to just live with him,” the source added. “But between Valente‘s pressure and her being a traditionalist, she felt since they have a child, they might as well marry.”Financial protection was reportedly discussed. “There is a prenup, but with some loopholes that mean if they divorce there will be a financial settlement for him,” the source said, fueling anxiety among relatives who fear long-term consequences.Publicly, Bündchen has remained silent on the criticism. After a highly scrutinized divorce from Tom Brady, she has chosen a quieter chapter focused on family and stability. Still, the whispers suggest that even fairytale endings can come with complicated realities, especially when love and wealth intersect.","Gisele Bündchen’s recent marriage to Joaquim Valente has reportedly raised quiet concerns within her family following her high-profile divorce from Tom Brady.

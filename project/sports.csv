At just 18 years old, D Gukesh has become the youngest and the 18th chess World Champion , defeating reigning title holder Ding Liren of China. This victory makes him India’s second world champion after Viswanathan Anand , who won five titles before conceding the crown to Magnus Carlsen in 2013. It’s a story that feels almost scripted, yet it is real — a tale of audacious dreams, relentless hard work, and unwavering support.In the press conference after his victory, Gukesh said, “I’m living my dream.” For many of us who have followed his journey, this is no exaggeration. I vividly remember an 11-year-old Gukesh, in a chat with Sagar Shah of ChessBase India, joyfully declaring his ambition: to become the youngest world chess champion . It’s a powerful reminder that setting bold goals and dedicating yourself to them can lead to extraordinary outcomes.Behind Gukesh’s victory is a story of immense sacrifice — especially from his parents . Garry Kasparov’s congratulatory post captures this sentiment beautifully: “My congratulations to D Gukesh on his victory today. He has summitted the highest peak of all: making his mother happy!” This line resonates deeply, as Kasparov himself has often spoken about the sacrifices his own mother made to support his chess career.In India, where parents traditionally prioritise academics over everything else, Gukesh’s parents dared to do differently. They chose to believe in their son’s talent, putting aside societal expectations and their own comforts to ensure he could pursue his passion.As a parent myself, this strikes a chord. Watching Gukesh’s triumph is a reminder of what parenting can be. Whether it’s chess, dance, or math, children deserve the freedom and encouragement to follow their dreams. Who knows what they might achieve if we let go of conventional ideas of success and simply support them?Gukesh’s victory also symbolises India’s growth as a sporting nation. Even a decade ago, the infrastructure, resources, and mindset needed to nurture a champion like him didn’t exist. Today, academies like WACA (WestBridge Anand Chess Academy), backed by a venture capital fund, play a pivotal role in shaping young talent. Supporting an elite chess player is no small feat — it requires constant funding, world-class training, and a network of top-tier seconds, coaches, and trainers.Gukesh’s winning team, which he proudly declared and thanked in the post-game press conference, includes some of the biggest names in the chess world: Grzegorz Gajewski, Radoslaw Wojtaszek, Pentala Harikrishna, Jan-Krzysztof Duda, Paddy Upton, and others. Such expertise doesn’t come cheap, and this ecosystem represents a combination of global excellence and Indian vision, underscoring the progress we’ve made as a nation in supporting sports.Beyond his game, what makes Gukesh remarkable is his maturity and authenticity. His calmness and emotional intelligence at the press conference were awe-inspiring for someone so young. As he answered questions with poise and humility , I couldn’t help but marvel at how grounded he is. Honestly, I’d love to know who trained him in PR and public speaking — his communication skills are as impressive as his chess!In the final moments of Game 14, nearly at the end, Ding made a one-move blunder in an otherwise drawn game, (55.Rf2, an offer for a rook trade), and commentators around the world jumped off their seats in disbelief. Commotion and celebration broke out across live streams, yet Gukesh remained straight-faced. Ultra calm, he studied the position, took a sip of water, and coolly traded rooks. He knew he was winning but displayed monk-like composure, holding back any visible excitement.Moments later, after further trading bishops and gaining a decisive pawn advantage, Gukesh finally allowed himself a smile, realising he had secured the championship. But even in this moment of triumph, his respect for the game and his opponent stood out. As Ding contemplated his resignation, Gukesh rose from his chair and turned away, ensuring his reaction wouldn’t come across as disrespectful.His regard for Ding’s spirit was evident in the post-game press conference, where he praised the Chinese GM's resilience and fighting spirit throughout the match.With humility, Gukesh even attributed part of his victory to the opponent, saying: “Ding Liren is the real inspiration to me. What I learned from Ding is what an incredible fighter he is—true champions fight until the very end.”And then, there was that raw, emotional moment when Ding Liren resigned . Gukesh’s face contorted with a mix of laughter and tears, reminding me of Kamal Haasan’s iconic scenes where he does both at once. Except this wasn’t acting — this was pure, unfiltered emotion. For a billion Indians rooting for his win, it was a moment of collective pride and joy.What truly sets Gukesh apart is his cultural confidence. In a world where many young people chase trends and pop culture, Gukesh remains unapologetically himself. He meditates with closed eyes before matches, wears a tripundra or vibhuti on his forehead, and after his victory, he touched the chessboard and his eyes—a traditional Hindu gesture of gratitude. His ability to stay grounded while excelling on the global stage sends a powerful message: you can embrace your roots and still be a global champion.Gukesh’s story isn’t just about chess. It’s about parenting, perseverance, and India’s transformation. It’s about staying true to yourself while reaching for the stars. Most of all, it’s about believing — in your children, in your dreams, and in the idea that greatness can come from anywhere.",D Gukesh became the youngest world chess champion at 18 years after beating Ding Liren of China. This victory makes him India’s second world champion after Viswanathan Anand.

Champions Trophy in PAK: More drama as Jay Shah strongly objects PCB's PoK plans

NEW DELHI: The International Cricket Committee (ICC) is likely to put the final stamp on the proposed hybrid model for the upcoming Champions Trophy in February on Saturday. An official meeting is due to be convened on Saturday with newly appointed ICC chairman Jay Shah virtually attending from Brisbane.It is learnt that ICC is agreeable to Pakistan team not travelling to India for any ICC tournament till 2027 to accommodate Indian cricket board's ( BCCI ) wish to play India's Champions Trophy matches in Dubai instead of host nation Pakistan due to security reasons.Pakistan Cricket Board ( PCB ) had demanded that Pakistan's matches in future ICC events hosted by India should be played at neutral venues. Indications are India will play Pakistan in Colombo during the ICC T20 World Cup in 2026, which will be jointly hosted by India and Sri Lanka. For the women's World Cup to be hosted in India next year, an alternate venue will be discussed for Pakistan to play their matches.During the upcoming Champions Trophy, Dubai is set to be the venue for the final with Pakistan hosting 10 matches and a semifinal. ""One may expect ICC to announce the venue and fixtures after the meeting on Saturday. As it was discussed in a meeting on December 5, hybrid model for the Champions Trophy is the most feasible option. ICC is likely to accept PCB's request, and India is unlikely to host Pakistan teams till 2027,"" an ICC source told TOI on Friday.PCB had asked for monetary compensation for agreeing to the hybrid model.They had suggested a greater percentage in ICC's revenue sharing model. TOI understands that the ICC board members are not agreeable to the demand and PCB isn't likely to get any sizeable financial compensation outside the logistical costs of hosting the tournament in two countries.However, there's a chance that PCB could be awarded another ICC event to host in lieu of the hybrid model agreement.",ICC likely to put the final stamp on the proposed hybrid model for the upcoming Champions Trophy in February.

What has been Gukesh’s mantra for success?

How did he handle the highs and lows during the match?

Can Gukesh dominate world chess for a long period?

CHENNAI: What separates newlycrowned world champion D Gukesh from the rest? His hunger to attain perfection when at the peak of his prowess. During an interaction with TOI from Singapore on Friday, Gukesh’s trainer and second Grzegorz Gajewski revealed that just hours after winning the title, the Indian youngster talked to him about how he could have played better. “Believe it or not, even yesterday (Thursday), he spoke about things that he could improve upon. That is the level of awareness he has,” said Gajewski. The Polish Grandmaster also spoke about Gukesh’s preparation for the World Championship, his ability to stay calm, how he handled his emotions during the match and more.I found a very nice team and we had training camps in India and Poland. Of course, we did a lot of work in between the camps. We put in a lot of effort in ensuring that our openings were as good as possible. We knew that we could get a serious edge in this part of a game. We also looked at other parts of a game and tried to improve Gukesh’s weaknesses in certain areas like time management and decision-making process. While preparing, we had a holistic approach instead of only thinking about the openings.He is open-minded and is willing to work and improve. He has absolutely no problems in admitting what he has done wrong. Instead of arguing, he focuses on how he can improve. Believe it or not, even yesterday (Thursday), he spoke about things that he could improve upon. That is the level of awareness he has and it is something I have not seen much in my life.Apart from being an outstanding chess player, Gukesh has the ability to remain calm and composed in critical moments. We know that the 41st move is one of the most dangerous moments in a game, it comes right after the time trouble (2 hours). The adrenaline could leave you and you could become less alert. It is very easy to lose focus and commit a blunder, Gukesh knows it well. In the World Championship, he was struggling for huge parts of the match and playing below his level. But Gukesh solved his problems and kept pushing. He had good games and bad games, but he kept pushing for two weeks. Finally, the opponent (Ding Liren) crumbled.There were all kinds of feelings; there was joy, sadness, excitement and frustration. One of the key moments was when Gukesh found his right mental state; he could not convert a couple of winning positions. He admitted to me that he was feeling the pressure and that he was afraid of not winning the match. He was aware of his state and it is not an easy thing to admit. We made some changes during the rest day (before the 10th game). We had some nice activities and tried to make him forget about the event for a couple of hours. It allowed him to reset mentally. From the 10th game, his mental state was how it was supposed to be. Even though he lost the 12th game, he was not upset. He was calm and ready for another fight.It is going to be difficult simply because chess is so competitive these days. There are so many young players who are emerging. In classical chess, even Magnus Carlsen would find it difficult to dominate these days. I am not sure if it is possible, but Gukesh is only 18. He is very ambitious and I will ensure that he keeps working hard to improve in areas that need improvement. If it is possible, we will try our best to make it.","D Gukesh's trainer and second Grzegorz Gajewski revealed that just hours after winning the title, the Indian youngster talked to him about how he could have played better. “Believe it or not, even yesterday (Thursday), he spoke about things that he could improve upon.

(Photo by Paul Kane/Getty Images)

The star batter, who has played just one Test in Brisbane without reward back in 2014, is fussing over his technique, putting in the hard yards & rallying the rest as India seek batting edge in crucial third Test...

IND vs AUS: India batting has been a major cause of worry

This Virat Kohli is like Sachin Tendulkar of 2011-13

BRISBANE: Step out of the Queensland Cricketers' Club members dining area and there's a unique vantage point right above the Gabba nets, offering a bird's eye view of the proceedings below.For those watching from here, through the four intense hours that India's top six sweated it out in sweltering heat and alarming UV levels, it was clear this batting unit is trying extremely hard to get its act together following the shellacking in Adelaide.Everybody, from KL Rahul to Rohit Sharma , put in the hard yards on Thursday but it was Virat Kohli who perfectly epitomized this renewed focus. He was a bundle of batting energy, hopping from one net to the other, facing pace, then more pace, fronting up against spin before spending a long time working on his technique and body position while facing throwdowns from the sidearm, or 'throwdown stick' as the Aussies call it.Kohli seemed a man on a mission even before hitting the hits, giving a long pep talk to the youngsters along with vice-captain Jasprit Bumrah , getting in some decent slip-catching practice before going deep within himself to iron out some perceived flaws.It was like watching a past master's frantic attempts to clear the cobwebs of the mind, to try and rediscover the poise and decisiveness of youth. Kohli is still very fit and far from being a spent force, of course. He has already done his bit as the series hits the halfway stage, having hit a century as India won in Perth. But he knows a decisive knock or two under pressure is what the team needs most from him.It is here, at the Gabba, with India on the ropes, that Kohli will be itching to contribute. He has played just once here and not done well. He knows the team is staring at either an early transition, or a delayed one if veterans like him and Rohit Sharma can rage against the dying of the light a bit longer. The transition will happen, nonetheless.For the moment, in the here and now, the spotlight is firmly on them. After the Perth ton, Kohli had said, ""I'm not the sort of guy who wants to hang around just for the sake of it. I just want to contribute to the team's cause.""In Perth, Kohli enjoyed the cushion of runs, with India already 321 ahead when he came out to the middle. He didn't have that cushion in Adelaide and faltered.In Perth, Kohli had the time to get his eye in before unleashing a range of strokes when he realized the team was waiting for him to get to three figures before declaring. In Adelaide, he was caught in two minds whether to reach out to a Mitchell Starc delivery, play or leave, and paid the price. In his second stint it was Scott Boland and again that nagging length, and the star batsman only managed to edge it to the 'keeper.In recent times, Kohli has had a tendency to commit on the front foot, but in Perth he used the depth of the crease well against the likes of Nathan Lyon. In the Brisbane nets on Thursday, he faced problems against deliveries just short of full length, playing and missing or edging against the likes of Jasprit Bumrah, Akash Deep and Mukesh Kumar.Lately, Kohli has found surprising ways to get out, like the Mitchell Santner full toss during the home series against New Zealand. Is it an eyesight thing? Are the trigger movements slow er? Only Kohli would know for sure, but it's possible to draw a distinct line at the point where the consistency starts to taper off—for someone who averaged 54.97 from 2011-19 and scored 27 Test tons, the years from 2020 till date have fetched him only three centuries and an average of 32.14. That's a steep decline, although he has still been impressive overseas of late.Kohli, then, has to break new ground at the Gabba, but he's not the only one. In India's last five Tests, against Australia here and New Zealand at home, the whole top six has collectively averaged a poor 27.47. Take just the last seven overseas Tests, and their collective average rises to 35.39. In Australia so far, across the two Tests, the top six averages only 28.13 across 24 innings, in spite of centuries from Yashasvi Jaiswal and Kohli.To make a strong comeback here, this team must find that elusive quality of consistency. Simply put, India must bat long. As Rohit Sharma had said after the defeat in the pink-ball Test, ""When you come to Australia the best chance of winning a Test match is by putting runs on the board."" Can Kohli inspire a top-six turnaround?","Virat Kohli has played just one Test in Brisbane without reward back in 2014.

as heading for draw, defending champ buckles

'Gukesh's face told me I had just made a blunder'

Caissa, the chess goddess, smiled on D Gukesh on Thursday. He thanked her in return. The world championship crown, the one Magnus Carlsen took away from Viswanathan Anand in Chennai in 2013, is returning to India - the birthplace of chess.At 18, Gukesh is the youngest world champion the chess world has ever seen, the first teenager to wear the crown. Garry Kasparov , who held the record till Thursday evening, was 22 when he ascended the throne in 1985.When Ding Liren blundered in a seemingly equal and drawable position in the 14th and last game of the World Chess Championship in Singapore, Gukesh, the challenger, realised he would be the new monarch of the 64-square game.The World No. 5 could not hide his excitement and emotions. He smiled, covered his face and uncorked a winning move. Three moves later, Ding resigned to hand over the crown he held after beating Russia's Ian Nepomniachtchi via tiebreaks in Astana, Kazakhstan, last year.""I knew I could play on this game for 5-6 hours, but I was mentally prepared for tomorrow's tiebreaks,"" said Gukesh.Indeed, Ding was not expected to crack in this position - rook and light-squared bishop each with Gukesh having an extra pawn (2 vs 1). But the stage and time-pressure got to him as he played the only move on the 55th turn - without much provocation - which would end in a loss. Hence, it was no surprise that Gukesh first thanked the almighty after his moment of triumph.Ding had told chess24 on the eve of the last game that he was prepared for a long haul. But despite having white pieces and getting a decent position out of the opening, he was lured to play for the draw following Gukesh's 18th move (pawn to b5) after fearing for the worse without much reason.Being the champion does not mean I am the best player in the world,"" said Gukesh. ""It's motivating that someone (Magnus Carlsen) is at a very, very high level. That will help me to continue working hard.""Carlsen has withdrawn from the World Championship cycle that had helped Ding enter the fray last year. The five-time world champion had cited lack of motivation in classical time control and skewed 'effort vs reward ratio' for it.Thursday's game was heading towards a draw, and the match towards rapid tiebreaks. Considering Ding's experience and higher rating in shorter time controls, he was seen as the favourite in that phase.Finally, that was thrown out of the window much to the relief of the players as Gukesh won with a scoreline of 7.5-6.5 points. Gukesh won in 58 moves of Reti Opening, Kings Indian Attack variation from black pieces.Despite the path-breaking achievement, Gukesh did not lose his bearings. When Ding left the playing arena, Gukesh wept tears of joy but did not forget to rearrange his pieces and that of his opponent. He also bowed in front of the chess board before leaving the stage. In a show of great appreciation for his rival, Gukesh stood up when Ding was set to leave after finishing his part of the press conference and shook his hand. Till Ding left the hall, Gukesh was clapping for the Chinese.So, where did Ding go wrong? The Chinese brought his rook on the f2 square without realising that the rook exchange at that point would put cold water on all the resilience he had shown in this entire match. The 32-year-old Chinese's bishop was trapped on the 'a8' square, limited to just one diagonal. Plus, Gukesh's bishop was not only in a position to attack the rival's bishop but even his king was adjacent to complete even the bishop exchange followed by the rook exchange. And then with only two pawns vs one pawn remaining on the board, the situation was completely winning for Gukesh with more than an hour remaining on his clock.Ding said after the loss, ""Gukesh's face told me that I had just made the blunder. I was totally shocked. It was already not easy to draw the game. Maybe I just needed to wait (show patience). No game tomorrow. This tournament was my best performance of the year."" It underlined his overall struggle and how he raised his game in Singapore with wins in the first and 12th game after losing the third and 11th game. ""Considering yesterday's lucky escape (a draw in the 13th game), it's a fair result. I have no regrets.""","D Gukesh beats China's Ding Liren 7.5-6.5 to become 18th World chess champ at 18, the 1st teen ever - breaking Kasparov's record (22 yrs) and 2nd Indian after Viswanathan Anand.

Since 1988, Australia have won 26 of their last 35 Test matches at the Gabba, with only two losses and seven draws.India, on the other hand, have played seven Test matches at the venue between 1947 and 2021, securing one win and one draw.

Brief Scores:

BENGALURU: Mumbai have been at their dominant best with their batters calling the shots in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy . The lone blemish in their campaign has been the loss to Kerala in the league phase. On Friday, Ajinkya Rahane (98, 56b, 11x4, 5x6) continued his imperious form to help Mumbai overpower Baroda by six wickets and book a place in the final.In the title clash, Mumbai will be up against Madhya Pradesh who cantered past Delhi by seven wickets.At the M Chinnaswamy Stadium, chasing a modest target of 159, Rahane looked in a hurry. The former India captain smashed Baroda pacer Lukman Meriwala for two fours and a six off the first three balls. The attack set the tone for Mumbai despite Prithvi Shaw's dismissal in the third over.The ease at which Rahane belted Baroda bowlers was a sight to behold. The player pulled, cut and lofted bowlers with ease. He raced to 41 after six overs with skipper Shreyas Iyer enjoying the show from the other end. But the latter too gradually began to punish Baroda bowlers, who were too short and Iyer hammered them over the midwicket fence.Iyer, who coasted to 46 with four fours and three sixes, fell to Atit Sheth in the 13th over. But the 88-run second-wicket stand had already done the damage. With less than six runs required from the last seven, Rahane could sight a ton and dealt in sixes. In the end, he fell just two short as he was dismissed by Abhimanyu Rajput. In the next over, Suryansh Shedge applied the finishing touches hitting the winning six as Mumbai were home with 16 balls to spare as the in-form Baroda outfit had an off day.""For me, it's always about timing the ball. It's always about the extension of my defence. Even though I'm playing at a strike rate of 190-200, it's still classical batting,"" Rahane said.Earlier, after a second-wicket association of 50 runs between Krunal Pandya and Shashwat Rawat, Baroda fell flat.

Border-Gavaskar Trophy: Can Shubman Gill revive overseas fortunes?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/india-in-australia/can-shubman-gill-revive-overseas-fortunes/articleshow/116305539.cms,"Shubman Gill during a training session at The Gabba in Brisbane.

Without a half-century in last 15 innings outside the subcontinent, the pressure will be on India no. 3 to deliver

BRISBANE: The pressure sits lightly on Shubman Gill 's young shoulders. In many ways he is the crown prince of Indian cricket, having already been earmarked for future leadership roles and big batting responsibilities. Returning to the Gabba , in a way, marks a full circle to the first half of his Test career.It was in Australia, back on the 2020-21 tour, that Gill made his debut along with Mohammed Siraj in Melbourne, scored 45, and then went on to announce his arrival on the big stage with the second-innings 91 here that propelled India's famous win.At both the Gabba and in the preceding Test, in Sydney, his efforts were overshadowed by Rishabh Pant , but that poise at the crease and serenity in his strokeplay marked him out for bigger red-ball duties.No wonder he admitted he was ""nostalgic"" upon returning to the Gabba, but this isn't Gill 's time for 'good-old-days' vibes. Having missed the first Test with a finger injury, there's work to be done and some standout knocks to be scored to prove his overseas credentials.With Yashasvi Jaiswal and Rohit Sharma taking over opening duties, Gill staked his claim to the regular No. 3 spot in July 2023 in the West Indies, but his game was a stark contrast to predecessor Cheteshwar Pujara 's stonewalling approach.Since that move, Gill has rediscovered form-particularly in the home Test series against England at the beginning of the year-and showed there isn't one way to be an effective No. 3. Now, he averages 41.04 in 27 innings at that position, an improvement on both his average as opener (32.37 in 29 innings) and overall average (36.45).Still, it's his overseas record that needs improvement, irrespective of his batting position. Since that 91 at the Gabba, Gill has just one overseas ton-the 110 against Bangladesh in Chattogram in 2022-and is now without a fifty in 15 innings in overseas Tests played in Australia, England, West Indies and South Africa.It's in Australia, though, that he still has his best average in any country (45.42 from 4 Tests), and Gill explained on Friday why he thought it was special to play here.""The intensity at which the games are played here, especially Test matches, is one of the most difficult things. To be able to maintain that intensity over the course of five days is what makes touring Australia so difficult. More than anything it's the mental fitness and the mental intensity that is required in Australia,"" he said.Gill looked fluent as long as he lasted in Adelaide but said he was flustered by wickets constantly falling at the other end. ""Because of what happened at the other end, I kind of took that on me. One of the challenges is how you can play your game irrespective of what is happening at the other end. There was a period where I faced, maybe, one ball in four overs and then the next ball I missed a straight ball, a fuller ball. These are the challenges,"" he said.Gill also became the latest in a long line of Indian players to complain about difficulties sighting the pink ball in Adelaide, and like his teammates is relieved the regular Kookaburra red will be back for the third Test. ""As a batting group, we are looking to post a big total first up. That's been the discussion and every batter has his own game plan,"" Gill said.Posting big first-innings totals has been a problem for India for a while now. Their last five first-innings score reads 46 all out in 31.2 overs in Bengaluru, 156 in 45.3 overs in Pune, 263 in 59.4 overs in Mumbai (all against NZ), 150 in 49.4 overs in Perth and 180 in 44.1 overs in Adelaide (on this tour). It's a weakness the team is eager to rectify, and runs from Gill will help. ""It looks like a good wicket, to be honest,"" he said. ""We'll know once we play on it.""",India's Shubman Gill returns to the Gabba for the third Test against Australia. Gill made his Test debut in Melbourne on the 2020-21 tour. He scored 91 in the second-innings of India's famous win in Sydney. Gill is without a half-century in last 15 innings outside the subcontinent.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116305513,imgsize-36662,width-400,resizemode-4/116305513.jpg"
South Africa pocket T20I series against Pakistan with Reeza Hendricks' winning century,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/south-africa-pocket-t20i-series-against-pakistan-with-reeza-hendricks-winning-century/articleshow/116305298.cms,"Reeza Hendricks' maiden T20 century (117 off 63 balls) propelled South Africa to a thrilling chase of 206, securing a 2-0 series victory against Pakistan. Saim Ayub's unbeaten 98 for Pakistan set up a high-scoring match, but Hendricks's explosive innings, featuring 10 sixes, proved decisive. This win marks South Africa's first T20 series victory since August 2022.

South Africa secured their first bilateral T20I series victory in over two years by successfully chasing down Pakistan's 206 in the second T20I at Centurion, thanks to Reeza Hendricks 's outstanding maiden century in the format.Hendricks scored an explosive 117 runs off just 63 balls, including 10 sixes and 7 fours, which took the Proteas past the target with three balls to spare for an impressive seven-wicket win.The victory gives the hosts an unassailable 2-0 lead in the three-match series, - their first T20I series win since August 2022.For Pakistan, opener Saim Ayub delivered an exceptional performance, remaining unbeaten on 98 off 57 balls. But he dramatically missed his first T20I century as he couldn't face the final nine deliveries of the innings.The match set a record for the highest combined score of 416 runs in T20I encounters between these two nations over their 17-year rivalry.Hendricks, who has represented the Proteas in T20 cricket for a decade and established himself as a consistent run-scorer, had been experiencing a quiet period recently. However, he rose to the occasion when South Africa found themselves at 28 for 2 after four overs.The third-wicket partnership between Hendricks and Rassie van der Dussen yielded 157 runs until the 18th over, when Abbas Afridi dismissed Hendricks.Van der Dussen reached his half-century in 33 deliveries during the same over and sealed the victory with his fifth six towards deep backward square, remaining unbeaten on 66 from 38 balls.After Tuesday's unsuccessful chase, Pakistan chose to bat first. Saim survived an early chance when he was dropped on 3 in the third over.He batted flawlessly afterwards, losing four partners while showcasing his complete batting repertoire, concluding his innings that included with 11 fours and 5 sixes.At 98, Saim was left stranded as Irfan Khan and Afridi faced the final nine balls of the innings.Debutant South African pacer Dayyan Galiem impressed with figures of 2 for 21, but the inexperienced bowling unit, sharing just 42 caps among six bowlers, struggled with extras, conceding 15 wides.",South Africa secured their first bilateral T20I series victory in over two years by successfully chasing down Pakistan's 206.

Unlike 2021, when visitors scored a famous win, the pitch is likely to be livelier

BRISBANE: 'The Gabbatoir'. Making mincemeat of visiting teams since 1931. The stronghold which makes enemy troops shake. Also the place where India have a powerful performance or two.For decades shaky in Australian conditions, the team first mustered the stomach for a fight here in 2003. Sourav Ganguly 's masterful 144 staved off the 'chin music' and wrested a hard-fought draw.For years, the Gabba set the tone for Australia in a home series. A few years ago, commercial considerations pushed it down the pecking order. With that one change, the venue seemed in danger of losing its fresh-season, early mover advantage. It fell on a new-age Indian team to move in for the kill, to break the illusion of Aussie invincibility. In Jan 2021, Rishabh Pant 's superpowers handed the hosts their first defeat here since 1989, when the mighty West Indies pacers still held sway.That loss wasn't an aberration. Earlier this year, Shamar Joseph ran through the Aussies with a second-innings 7/68 as West Indies won here again - by eight runs. Now, heading into the third Test of this see-saw series, Pat Cummins ' men find themselves with the rather mediocre record of having lost two of their last four Tests here.As always with the Gabba, there's a catch. Both Tests Australia lost were staged in late season January. The ground may not be hosting the first Test of this five-game marathon, but it is still mid-Dec, pre-Christmas. The ancient demons of the Gabba may fancy unleashing their horrors again.At least, that's the expectation. The demons may not even awaken if they find that fast bowlers on either side don't need much help in toppling two fragile batting units.As for the batters, there's hope yet. See off the first session or two and the runs may flow. The series is tied 1-1. It begins anew. ""For us this is a three-Test series now,"" declared Shubman Gill on match eve. Australia, on the other hand, are in muscle-flexing mode after demolishing India in Adelaide. Cummins cleverly upped the ante by promising more of that 'chin music' which worked wonders in the pink-ball Test.""It (the short-ball tactic) worked well in the Adelaide Test. It's always at the back of your mind as a Plan B, or if it's looking really uncomfortable (for the batters) and is likely to take wickets. Maybe it becomes a Plan A to some of the batters. I'm sure we'll give it a shot at some point in the Test,"" Cummins said. Gill rallied back, saying, ""What successful plan? The plan only worked on a couple of tailenders."" The mind games too have begun anew.The focus shifts firmly to the batters, including some ageing stalwarts on either side. India have some hard thinking to do regarding their batting order and combination. Their out-of-form captain Rohit Sharma has been slowly working his way back into some sort of rhythm and spending long hours in the nets. Will he be confident enough to reclaim his opening slot and push KL Rahul down the order?There will also be expectation that Virat Kohli , who scored a century in Perth when both the pressure and conditions had eased, can come up with a game-changing knock. Runs from the top four in both innings are crucial at the Gabba, and have tilted the scales for the winning side nine times in the last 10 Tests here.Then there's the question of Washington Sundar. He made his debut in that Brisbane win, played a big role and has even named his pet dog 'Gabba'. Should Sundar ease Ashwin out of the XI?The young guns who impressed in 2021 following a spate of injuries and withdrawals - Pant, Gill and Sundar - will be under pressure this time. Reprising the magic could take some doing. For Jaiswal too, it will be new territory. No wonder all of them were knocking away in the nets even on match eve, which is usually an optional session. That in-between back-of-a-length delivery has bothered all of India's batters, and all of them have been working hard to iron out the chinks. Maybe Cummins was bluffing with the whole 'short ball' jibe.As for the bowlers, whether the team management continues to back Harshit Rana, who had a very ordinary game in Adelaide, or whether Akash Deep takes his place, the Bumrah-led attack has its task cut out. They must attack the stumps more than they did in Adelaide and not dish out halfvolleys in trying to bowl fuller.Australia, meanwhile, have laid their cards on the table. Scott Boland, hero of Adelaide, makes way for the fit-again Josh Hazlewood, much to the chagrin of his considerable fan base. Like Rohit and Kohli, Steve Smith and Marnus Labuschagne, who found some form in Adelaide, are under extreme pressure.It's the depth and quality of the Aussie pace attack which gives the hosts an advantage heading into this Test. Recent early season games here have been fast and furious affairs. A Test against South Africa in Dec 2022 ended in two days. There's also scattered thunderstorms predicted on most days. Conditions could be tricky.Can the storied Gabba, on its last legs as a Test-match venue before it is face-lifted as a multi-sports arena ahead of the 2032 Brisbane Olympics, add to its cricketing lore?",India take on Australia in third Test at The Gabba in Brisbane. The hosts have lost two of their last four Tests here. The series is tied 1-1 after the second Test in Adelaide. The pitch is likely to be livelier than in the first Test.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116305256,imgsize-79132,width-400,resizemode-4/116305256.jpg"

(Photo by Robert Cianflone/Getty Images)

Former Australian captain Ricky Ponting has expressed his belief that Australia will win the third Test match against India in Brisbane . This despite Australia's recent losses at the Gabba to India and the West Indies.The first two matches of the ICC World Test Championship have been split between the two teams. India won the first match in Perth by a significant margin of 295 runs. Australia then responded with a convincing 10-wicket victory in the day-night Test in Adelaide.Ponting anticipates a closer contest in the third Test. However, he still predicts an Australian victory. He shared his views in a conversation with Sanjana Ganesan on The ICC Review.""It is really hard to say what to expect after the way the first two games have gone. I mean, they have been complete blowouts either way, so you do not really know what to expect. I have got a feeling it will be a bit more of an even contest than the first couple of games. I still think Australia will win,"" he added.Ponting bases his prediction on Australia's strong historical record at the Brisbane Cricket Ground, commonly known as the Gabba. Australia enjoyed a 31-match unbeaten streak at the venue between 1989 and 2020.In recent years, Australia have suffered two defeats at the Gabba, against India and the West Indies. Despite these setbacks, Ponting maintains his confidence in Australia's ability to win.""Generally, the team that wins the toss in Brisbane will bat first, aim to post a big score over the first couple of days, and then wait for the pitch to offer more assistance to the bowlers later in the game. That is typically how teams play there,"" Ponting explained.""Australia, if (Josh) Hazlewood is not fit, will likely remain unchanged. India have some decisions to make. Who do I think will dominate? It will probably be a bowler-friendly pitch for the first couple of days. There is usually 8-10mm of grass on the wicket at the Gabba. If it is cloudy and overcast, the bowlers will be licking their lips, and batsmen will need to work hard for their runs.""He added, ""I will back recent form. India have a good record, but historically, Australia have lost just twice at the Gabba in about 40 years. So, I will back Australia to win.""Ponting reiterated his earlier prediction of a 3-1 series win for Australia, which he had made on a previous episode of The ICC Review. He admitted being surprised by India's victory in Perth. He had initially expected Australia to win both the Perth and Adelaide Tests.""Yeah, I will stick to it, but I was not expecting India to have a win next to their name at this stage. I thought Australia would win in Perth and Adelaide,"" Ponting said.""From here ... Brisbane is next. India played beautifully there last time, but I think they will find it hard to win again, especially after what happened in Adelaide,"" he added.Ponting acknowledges India's history of performing well under pressure. He stated that India often plays its best cricket when facing adversity.""This Indian team has shown in the past that when their backs are against the wall, they often play their best cricket,"" he said.""However, I still think Australia are a slightly better and more well-rounded team. If they can maintain their form from Adelaide, they will be tough to beat in Brisbane,"" he concluded.",Ricky Ponting believes Australia will win the third Test against India in Brisbane. The first two matches of the ICC World Test Championship have been split between the two teams. Australia enjoyed a 31-match unbeaten streak at the venue between 1989 and 2020.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-116297744,imgsize-89178,width-400,resizemode-4/116297744.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Rajat Patidar struck a dazzling 29-ball 66 not out as Madhya Pradesh secured a spot in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy T20 final after 13 years, defeating former champions Delhi by seven wickets in the semifinal at M Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bengaluru on Friday.Patidar’s explosive unbeaten half-century, coupled with an exceptional bowling performance spearheaded by all-rounder Venkatesh Iyer, propelled Madhya Pradesh into the title clash against Mumbai.Choosing to bowl first, Madhya Pradesh’s bowlers vindicated their skipper’s decision with a clinical effort that stifled Delhi’s batting lineup.Despite a steady opening partnership between Yash Dhull (11) and Priyansh Arya (29), who added 38 runs in 33 balls, Delhi struggled to maintain momentum. Tripuresh Singh broke the stand by dismissing Dhull, and Kumar Kartikeya soon sent Arya back, leaving Delhi at 54 for 2 in the ninth over.The match turned in Madhya Pradesh’s favor when Venkatesh Iyer struck twice in the 11th over, removing skipper Ayush Badoni (19) and Himmat Singh (15). Iyer’s crucial spell of 2 for 12 dented Delhi’s innings, reducing them to 79 for 5.Late contributions from Anuj Rawat (33 not out off 24) and Mayank Rawat (24 off 21) took Delhi to a fighting 146 for 5.Madhya Pradesh’s chase began on a shaky note as veteran pacer Ishant Sharma dismissed opener Arpit Gaud for a first-ball duck. Ishant struck again to send Subhranshu Senapati (7) back, leaving Madhya Pradesh reeling at 20/2 in the third over.However, Harsh Gawli counter-attacked with an aggressive 30 off 18 balls, including four boundaries and a six, to steady the chase. Though Gawli fell to Himanshu Chauhan in the seventh over.From there, Rajat Patidar took control. Showcasing his remarkable batting prowess, Patidar unleashed a masterclass of power-hitting, smashing six sixes and four fours. Harpreet Singh Bhatia provided steady support with an unbeaten 46 off 34 balls.

NEW DELHI: Premier League club Manchester City posted record revenues in the 2023-24 season, with their income soaring to £715 million ($903 million).This marks an increase from £712.8 million the previous year, during which City claimed their fourth consecutive Premier League title.Despite the revenue growth, the club's profits saw a slight decline, dropping from £80.4 million in the treble-winning 2022-23 season to £73.8 million. The decrease was largely due to a drop in broadcast income, as City failed to replicate their Champions League triumph of 2023.Currently, City is investing heavily in the expansion of the Etihad Stadium, with a £300 million project to enlarge the north stand.Chairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak reflected on the club's ambition in the annual report, saying, ""Our constant ambition to target and achieve the unprecedented is a mark of the organisation that we have become.""On and off the field, our passion for the next challenge is underpinned by deliberate and detailed planning and a shared belief in the collaborative learning culture that we have built.""Our focus remains on further evolution and growth and therefore further value creation in all aspects of our business.""However, on the pitch, City is facing challenges. After a disappointing loss to Juventus in the Champions League, they are struggling with just one win in their last 10 matches across all competitions.As they prepare to face Manchester United in the Premier League on Sunday, they are eight points behind leaders Liverpool and risk missing out on the Champions League knockout stage.The club is also awaiting a ruling on the 115 charges of alleged financial rule breaches brought against them by the Premier League. If found guilty, City could face a points deduction or even relegation, though the club has strongly denied the allegations.","Premier League club Manchester City posted record revenues in the 2023-24 season.

Stockholm: Swedish prosecutors on Thursday dropped a rape investigation that was launched in connection with football star Kylian Mbappé's visit to Stockholm in October.In a statement, lead investigator Marina Chirakova said there was not enough evidence to continue the investigation, which centered on an incident at a hotel.“During the course of the investigation, there has been a designated person suspected on reasonable grounds of rape and two cases of sexual assault, but my assessment is that the evidence is not sufficient to proceed and the investigation is therefore closed,"" Chirakova said. “The designated person has not been notified of suspicion of a crime.”Prosecutors never publicly named the suspect in the investigation, but many Swedish media reported it was Real Madrid striker Mbappe , who visited Stockholm in October during a break in the Spanish league.At the time Mbappe's legal team dismissed those reports as false.Mbappe's lawyer Marie-Alix Canu-Bernard and the player's representatives did not immediately respond to a request for comments on Thursday.In an interview that aired Sunday on French TV station, Mbappe said he was ""surprised"" by the reports that he was the subject of a rape investigation and he had not been contacted by Swedish authorities.“These are things that come into your life like that, you can’t see them coming,” Mbappe told. ""It's just incomprehension. I don’t think it weighed on me in the sense that I have never considered myself involved.”The 25-year-old football star appeared in Stockholm on October 10 during an international break instead of playing for France in the Nations League. Just days later Swedish media reported he was the subject of a rape investigation.At the time Swedish prosecutors confirmed that a rape investigation began but declined to comment further.","Swedish prosecutors dropped a rape investigation that was launched in connection with football star Kylian Mbappé's visit to Stockholm in October.

Before the season began, advancing to the next stage of the new format seemed inevitable for a side that had won the last four Premier League titles and was the 2023 European champion. However, that is no longer the case as City manager Pep Guardiola struggles with injuries and his players' seeming lack of faith.With goals from Dušan Vlahovic and Weston McKennie causing the most recent loss and igniting Juventus' hopes of qualifying, City has only won one of its last ten games across all competitions.Barcelona 's 3-2 victory over Borussia Dortmund propelled them into second position in the league rankings, behind Liverpool, and ensured their advancement. Ferran Torres and Raphinha each scored two goals for Barcelona.Bukayo Saka 's two goals helped Arsenal defeat Monaco 3-0, putting them in third position and ahead of six other clubs with 13 points.The clubs ranked No. 9-24 enter a two-leg playoff, while the top eight advance straight to the round of 16.The first of City's two remaining Champions League games comes against Paris Saint-Germain, another struggling powerhouse in 25th place, one point outside of the qualifying spots.With a powerful header aimed directly at City goalkeeper Ederson, who was only able to divert the ball over his own line, Vlahovic gave Juventus the lead in the 53rd minute. Juve won thanks to two American substitutes, including McKennie, who volleyed home from a cross from Timothy Weah.Juventus rose to 14th position.Last season's runner-up Dortmund was forced out of the top eight after Ferran Torres came off the bench to lead Barcelona to their fifth victory in six games.Robert Lewandowski, who had a quiet game against his old team, was replaced by Torres in the 71st minute. Torres scored on the rebound of Dani Olmo's shot just four minutes later.The score was tied at 2-2 after Serhou Guirassy's second goal of the match, but Torres scored again in the 85th minute after Lamine Yamal's counterattack.Barcelona took the lead thanks to Raphinha, and Guirassy equalized from the penalty spot. Lewandowski leads the league with seven goals, while Raphinha and Guirassy are tied for second place with six goals each.Saka scored goals in the 34th and 78th minutes and put in a shot that was converted into the net by substitute Kai Havertz in the 88th, giving Arsenal their third consecutive league-stage home victory without giving up.On goal differential, Arsenal leads Bayer Leverkusen, Aston Villa, Inter Milan, Brest, and Lille. On Wednesday, Lille defeated Sturm Graz 3-2 at home.AC Milan defeated Red Star Belgrade 2-1, with Tammy Abraham scoring the game-winning goal in the 87th minute to pull one point out of the top eight. In the first half, Milan lost Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Alvaro Morata to muscular ailments.Feyenoord defeated Sparta Prague 4-2, while Benfica drew 0-0 at home against Bologna to stop their five-game winning streak.","Manchester City fell to 22nd in the 36-team Champions League standings.

Excerpts:

and longevity…

American men haven't had results like the women:

Graf was the hardest victory I ever had: Agassi

BENGALURU: Andre Agassi wondered if the 24-time major winner Novak Djokovic would miss his greatest rivals -- the now-retired Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer -- in the last leg of a glittering career where the 37-year-old goes for more history.The eight-time Grand Slam champion, in the city for the TiE Global Summit, assessed Djokovic's run and the Serb's recent partnership with friend and rival Andy Murray in a candid chat with media.It's hard to say, Father Time always wins. He has already done so much for so long, it's hard to imagine longer. We said that about (Roger) Federer too. I think Novak will run out of energy more than capability. Cannot be easy, especially when the people you came to the dance with have left, that's a big thing.When Pete (Sampras) retired it was a blow to me, it set me back a little bit. It made me rediscover my inspirations on some level. Djokovic has lost the guys he made history with. It'll probably get tougher and tougher emotionally, but I would never bet against them. Bet against them at your peril.In any coach-student relationship you need trust and trust can take time, but it's nice when it starts with believing in somebody because you know that they know your experience. There's an asset to their history as competitors.Any success of a relationship is based on complete buy-in and that's always the part you have to wait and see. It's not what I know that changes your career, information doesn't lead to transformation, somebody has to counter that. That's the connector. I'm sure there's going to be a lot of trust immediately, we'll see how the results go.Alcaraz defends like Novak, has more power and spin like Nadal, hands and finesse like Federer but just because he has the best of all the three doesn't mean he can do what they did. There are so many parts to the game such as decision-making, injuries, luck. So how long can (Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner) do it (for)? They could do it for 20 years or not.The women's game hasn't had to deal with Roger Federer, Novak Djokovic, Rafael, Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz, but they have their version of it. Serena Williams is the Novak of the women's game and you got Coco as a potential, like Alcaraz has potential and Sinner has potential.How the game evolves is interesting. The women's game has gotten very powerful, just straight power. For lack of a better example, Lindsay Davenport was powerful, tall, precise through the court and now you have a lot of that. There's still room for somebody who can offset that kind of power, like an Ash Barty.The men's game has changed in the sense that guys have gotten bigger with longer levers, which means they're better athletes, they can move and they need more time, they start playing further back. Soon you're going to start seeing the net game start coming back, everything morphs in its own way. But the biggest issue for American (men) not winning is an unfortunate set of decades where the guys were very stingy and very greedy -- 66 Grand Slams in the same generation. There's not a lot left there (for others)!Andre Agassi - the second of five men to achieve a career Grand Slam in the Open Era and the first man to complete a career golden slam - has won it all, including a stirring love match.""She was the hardest victory I ever had,"" said Agassi of his wife German tennis legend Steffi Graf, a 22-time major winner.Agassi, who has won eight major titles and the Olympic gold, speaking during a session at the TiE Global Summit, said, ""We all live a hero's journey - first part of life is about performing and achieving. Then life hits us with broken relationships and dreams. I went through it all. Finally, in the last phase of the journey, it's about serving others.""The 54-year-old said, ""At 28 my (tennis) career started over. Without the struggles, I would've never gotten Steffi to say yes. I tried to get her for years.""On a lighter note, Agassi said he likes to keep his trophies out of the house. ""I don't bring my trophies home, because if I bring my trophies home, then she brings her trophies home - and that's bad math!""",Andre Agassi believes Novak Djokovic will run out of energy more than capability.

NEW DELHI: Legendary player Andre Agassi observed that Carlos Alcaraz embodies distinct qualities from Novak Djokovic Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal , while advising the tennis world against anticipating the young Spaniard to match the extraordinary achievements of these tennis legends.The collective Grand Slam victories of Federer, Nadal and Djokovic stand at 66, whilst Alcaraz, aged 21, has secured four major titles thus far.""I'm not a genius and I don't have a crystal ball. What I can tell you is Alcaraz defends like Novak, has power and spin like Nadal and has hands and finesse like Federer,"" said Agassi during a talk session in Bengaluru.The eight-time Grand Slam victor Agassi elaborated on why excessive expectations shouldn't burden Alcaraz.""Just because he has the best of all those three doesn't mean he can do what they did because there're so many other parts to the game, which mean decision-making, injuries, you know, luck,"" he said.With Djokovic at 37, approaching retirement, Agassi noted that the Serbian's competitive edge might diminish without Nadal and Federer in the arena.""He's already done so much, so long, and it's hard to imagine longer. I think he'll run out of the energy for it more than the capability of it, I would imagine.""It cannot be easy, especially when the people you came to the dance with have left.""The American provided additional context to his assessment.""When Pete (Sampras) retired, it was a blow to me. It set me back a little bit. It made me have to rediscover my inspirations on some level.""And he's (Djokovic) lost the guys that he's made history with. So, it's probably emotionally going to get tougher and tougher quickly, but I would never bet against him. Bet against him at your own peril,"" said Agassi.Regarding Djokovic's recent appointment of Andy Murray as coach to extend his career, Agassi expressed interest in their partnership's development.""They've been fierce rivals on court, and now Murray will be coaching Djokovic.

NEW DELHI: Tennis icon Andre Agassi on Tuesday highlighted how sports should remain integral to education, noting their role in teaching children to cope with defeat.At a Bengaluru event focussed on sports and education's role in fostering excellence, Agassi shared his insights.""Even when you have a failure, you have to get up and play again the next day. So, what sports is teaching you is that focusing on winning and losing is really a distraction from what we need to be thinking about. We need to be thinking about how to get better,"" he said.Since 2001, Agassi has invested in education for underprivileged children, establishing 130 schools serving approximately 80,000 students in the United States. He attributes this achievement to his persistent drive to overcome obstacles.His demanding tennis career shaped his ability to maintain focus and adapt when necessary.""Sports is all about problem-solving. Tennis taught me how to navigate a very intense environment and maintain my objectivity and problem-solving abilities. It forces me to be present, but also to understand the context of what I'm doing,"" Agassi said.Regarding his earlier defiant period, Agassi acknowledged it as a necessary phase in his journey.""Vulnerability is essential for growth, and I think vulnerability eventually leads to humility,"" he added.He recognised technology's crucial role in education, particularly in providing individualised learning opportunities for children. This belief influenced his investment in the Indian EdTech company, Square Panda .""I think technology can play an essential role, not just in scalability, but also in optimising personalised learning. That's why I got involved with Square Panda. We are here because of the sheer scale of impact the technology will bring to education,"" he said.","Tennis icon Andre Agassi highlighted how sports should remain integral to education.

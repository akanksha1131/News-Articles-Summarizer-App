The latest Cricket South Africa (CSA) directive of recalling its IPL-bound players by May 26 has come as a body blow for the franchises, who will chase different goals upon the resumption of the league on Saturday. Making life more difficult for the teams is the impact that the England-West Indies ODI series, beginning May 29, could have on them as well.SA, slated to face Australia in the WTC final at Lord's in London from June 11, have reiterated their desire to bring the players back by the original deadline. “Our initial agreement with the IPL and the BCCI was that our players would return on May 26. As it stands, we are not budging on this,” SA coach Shukri Conrad said when asked about the extended IPL, which will run until June 3.Eight players picked in SA's 15-member WTC final squad, including Ryan Rickelton (Mumbai Indians), Kagiso Rabada (Gujarat Titans) and Marco Jansen (Punjab Kings), are contracted to IPL teams. SA are set to land in England on May 31 and play a four-day practice match against Zimbabwe from June 3, meaning their players are unlikely to feature in the playoffs.Meanwhile, Cricket Australia (CA) has put the ball in the players' court, saying the team management will come up with fresh preparation plans for players “who choose to play” the rest of the IPL. Australia are scheduled to have a pre-final camp in Scotland from the end of this month, before travelling to England for the title clash. While Pat Cummins and Travis Head (both represent SRH who are eliminated) are likely to return, Josh Hazlewood (RCB) is set to give the final phase of IPL a miss.The Englishmen who have been named in the contingent for the home assignment against the West Indies are expected to fly out of India before the IPL playoffs. Among those selected are Jos Buttler (Titans), Will Jacks (Mumbai) and Jacob Bethell (Royal Challengers), leaving their top-four chasing franchises with lastminute work to do.The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB), like the CSA, had provided assurance that its centrallycontracted players would be available for the entire IPL, but has been left with no other option because of the revised schedule. There is no clarity on whether Sherfane Rutherford (GT) and Romario Shepherd (RCB), picked in the Windies ODI squad, will stay for the playoffs in case their teams make the cut.The versatile wicketkeeper-batter will be badly missed as he has formed a nearperfect top-three with skipper Shubman Gill and B Sai Sudharsan. The top-order has done the bulk of the scoring for GT this campaign.The West Indian lends firepower to the Titans middleorder packed with uncapped Indians. He has delivered some crucial cameos and for now, GT do not have a like-forlike replacement in the squad, given Glenn Phillips too is out with injury.GT have performed well even in the absence of the ace South African pacer. If he doesn't return, Gerald Coetzee, who is not part of SA WTC Final squad, can take his place.The Englishman performed his duties after replacing the injured Phil Salt at the top of the order. With Salt expected to be back for the rest of the tournament – as mentioned by batting coach Dinesh Karthik – Bethell may not be much of a miss.The all-rounder has been a regular in the XII since the time he came in for the out-of-form Liam Livingstone. The West Indian played a match-winning knock against CSK. He reached Bengaluru late on Wednesday, ending all speculation.Could be the biggest miss. The Australian pacer has spearheaded the attack and been one of the standout bowlers this season. RCB do not have a quality back-up who can match the calibre of Hazlewood and may have to rely on Nuwan Thushara.Another probable big blow. The South African all-rounder has been the best-performing overseas player for Punjab. He picked up his bowling form, especially with the new ball, as the tournament progressed. Fast bowler Xavier Bartlett can replace him if the lanky paceman doesn't return.The Australian wicketkeeper-batter has been a floater in the line-up, but has not made a significant contribution yet. With Prabhsimran Singh being a mainstay, PBKS do not have an headache in the wicketkeeping department.Though not part of the WTC Final squad, there is a chance he may not return. The Aussie has not lived up to the expectations, barring the knock against SRH where he smashed four successive sixes. Azmatullah Omarzai, who broke back into the XII recently, can replace him.The southpaw has formed a formidable opening pair with Rohit Sharma and has been in fine nick. MI do not have an overseas replacement for him at the moment, neither do they have a wicketkeeper batter close to that quality.While the Englishman has not set the IPL on fire, he has been a utility player. With MI lacking a genuine off-spinner, he has chipped in with some crucial overs.The South African made it to the XII following the injury to leftarm spinner Mitchell Santner. Once Santner is back in the mix, Bosch may not be missed much.Though not part of WTC Final squad, opener has pulled out citing personal reasons. Poor returns from the Aussie opener meant that he was already dropped from the DC team with Faf du Plessis coming in place of him.The left-arm pacer lost steam in recent matches and did not provide the cutting edge at the start or death. Following his pull-out, Bangladesh's Mustafizur Rahman has been drafted in and he can be a decent back-up.The South African has been a vital cog in the Capitals wheel, taking up one of the toughest jobs of finishing the innings. His probable absence can be a massive blow for DC.They will not be missing any overseas players due to clash of schedules.Aiden Markram: The opener has been one of the top run-getters for LSG, who will need his services for all three remaining league matches if they are to keep faint playoff hopes alive. Super Giants have Matthew Breetzke, but he may not be able to match Markram's impact.* Sunrisers Hyderabad, Rajasthan Royals and Chennai Super Kings have already been eliminated from the IPL.","Cricket South Africa (CSA) directive of recalling its IPL-bound players by May 26 has come as a body blow for the franchises. The England-West Indies ODI series, beginning May 29, could have on them as well. Cricket Australia (CA) has put the ball in the players' court.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121175664,imgsize-43160,width-400,resizemode-4/IPL-2025.jpg"

Virat Kohli retires from Test cricket after 14 years

NEW DELHI: Modern-day batting legend Virat Kohli ’s retirement from Test cricket has sparked an outpouring of admiration from across the cricketing world, with former England captains Michael Atherton and Nasser Hussain leading the chorus of praise. After a 14-year journey that reshaped Indian cricket’s approach to the red-ball game, Kohli announced his retirement on Instagram, ending a legendary career with 9,230 runs in 123 Tests, including 30 centuries.""I loved watching him play every day of his 123 Tests,"" Atherton said, speaking to Sky Sports. ""You couldn't take your eyes off Kohli. He put his heart and soul into Test cricket, and that energy and passion never seemed to dim.""Reflecting on Kohli’s retirement note, Atherton said it was significant that Kohli acknowledged the unique challenges of Test cricket — a format he not only embraced but elevated with unmatched intensity.Kohli’s retirement leaves India facing a void at the crucial No. 4 position ahead of their five-Test series in England. ""You kind of pity the person who has to follow,"" Atherton remarked, noting the formidable legacy left behind by Kohli, much like his predecessor, Sachin Tendulkar Nasser Hussain echoed similar sentiments, hailing Kohli as a transformative figure. ""I’ve been a massive Virat Kohli fan over the last 14 years,"" Hussain said on the Sky Sports Cricket podcast. ""But he was so much more than just the stats — it was his aura, swagger, and passion. No one embodied the meaning of cricket in India more than Kohli.""Under Kohli’s leadership, India became the No. 1 Test side in the world, holding that position for a staggering 42 months. With 40 wins in 68 matches as captain, his aggressive style of leadership redefined India’s image in Test cricket — fearless, fiery, and fit.""He is the ultimate winner,"" Hussain added. ""He can’t go on the field and not be 100 per cent. Everything for Kohli is about winning. That’s why he was so good in run chases and why India became such a formidable force.""As Team India prepares for the next World Test Championship cycle, all eyes will be on who steps into Kohli’s shoes. But for now, the cricket world stands united in celebrating a once-in-a-generation player who brought fire and flair to the longest format.","Virat Kohli retires from Test cricket after 14 years.

Bangladesh pacer Mustafizur Rahman stirred the pot on social media with a cryptic tweet on Tuesday that read, “Heading to UAE to play against them. Keep me in your prayers.” While the tweet referred to his inclusion in the Bangladesh squad for the two-match T20I series against UAE on May 17 and 19, it came just hours after Delhi Capitals announced him as a replacement for Jake Fraser-McGurk in IPL 2025 triggering widespread confusion.Delhi Capitals confirmed Mustafizur’s return to the franchise, with the left-arm seamer coming in for Australian sensation Jake Fraser-McGurk, who has opted out of the remainder of the season due to personal reasons. Mustafizur, who has played for DC in the 2022 and 2023 seasons, was signed for INR 6 crore.However, the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) cast immediate doubt on the move, stating that they had not yet received a formal request for a No-Objection Certificate (NOC). “I can't say (whether Mustafiz will join Delhi Capitals),” BCB CEO Nizamuddin Chowdhury told. “He is with the team (flying to UAE), no? We haven't got any decision (joining Delhi Capitals) in this regard yet.”Quiz: Who's that IPL player? The uncertainty leaves DC in a tricky situation, especially with the playoff race heating up. Mustafizur’s experience could be vital as Delhi prepare to take on fellow contenders Gujarat Titans, Mumbai Indians, and Punjab Kings in their final three games. They are currently fifth with 13 points from 11 matches, just behind MI who have played one more fixture.With 61 IPL wickets to his name and a reputation as one of the most deceptive T20 bowlers in the game, Mustafizur’s availability could make a big difference to DC’s playoff hopes — but for now, his journey appears headed for UAE, not the IPL.Whether the pacer will switch his Bangladesh jersey for the DC blue later this week remains a waiting game.","Bangladesh pacer Mustafizur Rahman tweets he is heading to UAE for T20 series.

Delhi in race to host playoff ties

MUMBAI: Most overseas players, barring a few Australians and Englishmen, are set to return for IPL 2025 when the tournament resumes on Saturday (May 17), following a week-long suspension due to cross border tensions between India and Pakistan.According to a source, among those who have confirmed their participation are Australian captain Pat Cummins, who is set to lead Australia in the World Test Championship final at Lord’s from June 11, and opener Travis Head.While the return of Sunrisers Hyderabad captain Cummins and Head is good news, the team is already out of the playoff race. SRH have only two matches remaining.The teams currently best placed in terms of overseas player availability are Gujarat Titans, Mumbai Indians and Kolkata Knight Riders, who are all set to be back at full strength.On Tuesday, MI had their first training session at the Wankhede Stadium since the BCCI announced the league’s resumption. captain Rohit Sharma attended the session alongwith overseas players Mitchell Santner, Bevon Jacobs, and Mujeeb Ur Rahman — all of whom had stayed back with the team during the break.The remaining overseas players, including England allrounder Will Jacks and wicketkeeper Ryan Rickelton, are expected to arrive from Thursday. MI restart their campaign against Delhi Capitals on May 21 which gives them ample time to reassemble their squad.In GT’s case, former England white-ball captain Jos Buttler and South African pacer Gerald Coetzee are expected to arrive on Wednesday, while Rashid Khan, Kagiso Rabada and Sherfane Rutherford had stayed back in India. The Titans are well-positioned to qualify for the playoffs.In a setback for Rajasthan Royals, their bowling coach Shane Bond is “highly unlikely” to return, TOI has learnt. The franchise also remains uncertain about the availability of England pacer Jofra Archer — selected for the England vs West Indies ODI series starting May 29 — and West Indies batter Shimron Hetmyer.Australian pacers Josh Hazlewood (RCB), who is injured, and Mitchell Starc will both skip the remainder of the tournament.Punjab Kings are still unsure about the return of Australian players Josh Inglis and Marcus Stoinis while South African pace all-rounder Marco Jansen remains stationed in Dubai. Inglis has also been picked in Australia’s squad for the WTC final.Meanwhile, a reliable BCCI source told TOI that Delhi is also in contention to host the four IPL-2025 playoff matches, along with Ahmedabad — the likely venue for the final — and Mumbai.“The final was moved out of Kolkata due to forecast of heavy rain around June 3, the scheduled date of the final. Weather forecasts for Ahmedabad, Mumbai and Delhi are currently clear,” the source added.","Most overseas players, barring a few Australians and Englishmen, are set to return for IPL 2025 when the tournament resumes on May 17.

NEW DELHI: In a historic milestone for Indian cricket Ravindra Jadeja has etched his name deeper into the sport’s legacy by maintaining the longest-ever reign as the No. 1 all-rounder in Test cricket history for 1,151 days.The star spinner and dependable lower-order batter continues to stand tall atop the ICC Men’s Test All-Rounder Rankings , an achievement no player before him has managed for such an extended period.Jadeja’s dominance at the top is not just a testament to his consistency but also his unmatched versatility across conditions. Whether it’s a gritty fifty on a crumbling pitch or a match-turning five-wicket haul, the 36-year-old has become a pillar of India's Test side.His reign as the world's best all-rounder underscores the rare balance he brings to the game, something few in cricketing history have achieved.But while Jadeja's place at the top remains unshaken, Bangladesh’s Mehidy Hasan Miraz is quietly making headlines of his own.Following a phenomenal Test series against Zimbabwe, where he scored 116 runs and claimed 15 wickets, Miraz climbed to No. 2 in the all-rounder rankings. His career-best rating of 327 puts him just 73 points behind Jadeja, adding an exciting edge to the next few Test series.The rankings also saw significant movement across the board. Bangladesh's Test win in Chattogram spurred leaps for players like Taijul Islam and Shadman Islam , while England's Joe Root remained the No. 1 batter. Jasprit Bumrah , meanwhile, retained his crown as the world’s top Test bowler.Still, the spotlight firmly belongs to Jadeja. In an era dominated by specialists, his prolonged excellence with both bat and ball has redefined what it means to be a modern all-rounder—and now, he's officially the greatest in that role Test cricket has ever seen.","Ravindra Jadeja has been the No. 1 all-rounder in Test cricket for 1,151 days.

IPL 2025 suspended: What happens next?

Australia's women's cricket team captain and Mitchell Starc's partner, Alyssa Healy , shared her experience after the Dharamsala fixture between Punjab Kings (PBKS) and Delhi Capitals (DC) was halted midway due to security reasons; panic gripped the overseas players both the teams.""We weren't sure what was going to unfold in the next three days because all the Northern airports were shut,"" Healy said on thepodcast.Healy also pointed out how the "" misinformation "" created a ruckus among the Australian cricketers.""So yeah, there was a lot of anxiety around, especially probably the Australian group because we didn't have a whole heap of information as to what was going on, and that's probably been, and I'll say this has been the really interesting and probably the scariest part of this whole situation is probably the misinformation that's around the world and probably around life in general at the moment. There's a lot going on, but everything you read was different. Everything you saw was different,"" she explained.""Everything you heard was different. So what was actually taking place? No one really knew. Even the governments weren't really sure what was going on because no one could really understand unless you were quite literally living in these villages that were getting attacked.""So I think that created probably more of the anxiety. I think there was a lot of talk around we shouldn't be playing. It's not a great time to be playing, first and foremost, but also we're quite close to what's being fought over.""Healy also revealed the whispers that were going around among the teams and broadcasting crew.""There were 300 people, I believe. It was a travelling circus. Trying to get out. So there were a few whispers of pack a small bag. We're getting on a bus tonight. We're leaving. We're getting out of here,"" she said.""It was quickly shut down by some security briefing that said, look, if you go tonight, you're at a real risk of something happening because driving on the roads, first and foremost in that area, is not safe at night; the roads aren't great. It's quite hilly. And if your driver gets tired, you're in strife.So we'll go together tomorrow. I've got a plan in place. We'll get you out in the morning. Don't panic. Sit tight tonight. Help yourself to the buffet.""The wicketkeeper-batter also revealed the funny discussion the Australian contingent were having in the resort that was booked for the players in Dharamsala.""We're staying in this beautiful resort in Dharamsala that looks over the whole town, and you've got the mountain behind you. And it felt like you could be anywhere in the world on an exotic holiday. And here we are being told we're going to get evacuated. But yeah, don't panic.

Across 57 IPL matches, he has taken 61 wickets, and his international T20I record boasts 132 scalps from 106 games.If cleared to play, he will add to DC’s left-arm pace arsenal alongside Mitchell Starc and T Natarajan , though Starc is now reportedly set to exit the tournament as well.Fraser-McGurk’s exit comes in the wake of the emotional toll from the mid-match evacuation in Dharamsala, triggered by regional tensions.His coach, Shanon Young, described the 23-year-old as “shaken more than most,” especially given his age and the unfamiliarity with such high-pressure situations. Delhi Capitals management has been praised for its swift and supportive response during the crisis.With three crucial matches left against GT, MI, and PBKS, DC are still in the playoff race.

Former England captain Michael Vaughan has stirred the cricketing world with his explosive remarks in the wake of Virat Kohli 's sudden retirement from Test cricket. While he lavished praise on Kohli for reigniting India’s passion for the red-ball format, Vaughan didn't hold back when comparing Kohli’s legacy to that of MS Dhoni , stating: ""MS Dhoni was one of the great white-ball players but it felt like he captained a Test team who did not love the format. The game needs India to be madly in love with Test cricket , and that is what Virat fostered as captain.""Dhoni, who captained India in 60 Tests, achieved 27 wins, 18 losses, and 15 draws, with a win percentage of 45%. While Dhoni led India to become a dominant force at home, his away record of 6 wins was less stellar compared to Kohli's 16.Kohli, who led India to 40 wins in 68 Tests, represented India in 123 Tests, scoring 9,230 runs at an average of 46.85, including 30 centuries.""There are not too many Test retirements where I am left genuinely disappointed that I won't watch a cricketer play again. But I'm gutted we won't see Virat Kohli in England this summer or in whites any more,"" Vaughan wrote in his Telegraph column.""I'm shocked that he's retiring now, and I'm also quite sad about it. In my time involved in the game, stretching back more than 30 years, I don't believe there is any individual who has done more for the Test format than Virat.""Vaughan highlighted Kohli's significant impact on Test cricket, particularly during his captaincy tenure.""When he took the captaincy just over a decade ago, I was worried India was losing interest in Test cricket,"" said the 50-year-old, who served as England Test captain from 2003 to 2008.Quiz: Who's that IPL player? ""His passion, skill, and the way he talked about Test cricket always being the pinnacle has been a huge shot in the arm for the format. Test cricket would have been a far blander place without him, and there is a chance it would have lost its appeal if he had not been as interested and invested in it.""Vaughan considers Kohli the greatest player across all formats and views his retirement as a significant loss to Test cricket.""His retirement now is a blow to Test cricket and very disappointing for fans – not least in England this summer – but my belief is that he has helped forge a love for the format among the generation that will follow him, and kept the flame burning.""""It's impossible to compare across every era, but if you look at since T20 came in around 20 years ago, he is almost certainly the greatest player when you consider all three formats.""Addressing criticism about Kohli's on-field aggressive behavior, Vaughan offered a different perspective.""All great players have egos, but maybe Virat's wasn't quite as big as we thought. Perhaps family life has mellowed him a bit, and he just wants as normal a life as he possibly can, which is probably going to be in London, where he spends a lot of time now.""""Those outside that bubble really can't imagine what it's like being a Kohli or a Sachin Tendulkar, with the pressure of billions of adoring fans on your shoulders.""","Virat Kohli has retired from Test cricket.

He joins the Capitals for a hefty Rs 6 Crore deal.Fraser-McGurk’s departure comes amid a tense backdrop. The IPL was briefly suspended on May 9 due to rising geopolitical tensions between India and Pakistan.The tournament’s resumption follows a ceasefire agreement, but uncertainty lingers, especially for overseas players.Several Australians, including Fraser-McGurk, returned home, and Cricket Australia has publicly supported their decision to prioritise personal well-being and national duties ahead of the looming World Test Championship final on June 11 at Lord’s.As the league restarts, only 13 group-stage matches remain, including a rescheduled game that was halted mid-play during the recent disruption. With playoff spots still up for grabs, DC hope Mustafizur’s inclusion can boost their bowling attack and keep them in contention for a top-four finish.Meanwhile, Australian stars like Pat Cummins Mitchell Starc , and Travis Head must now juggle IPL commitments with Test preparations, with Cricket Australia staying in close contact with the BCCI and Indian authorities to monitor security measures.",Bangladesh pacer Mustafizur Rahman has signed for Delhi Capitals.

""However, it was clearly understood and communicated during our discussions with both AIFF and FSDL that the club would be rebranded and relocated to Delhi following the conclusion of the season.""Once sanctioned by the AIFF and FSDL, Hyderabad are expected to undergo a complete transformation which includes rebranding, restructuring of administrative and technical departments, and the establishment of a new headquarters.""The aim is to develop a professionally run football club that reflects the values and aspirations of a new generation of fans in Delhi and across India,"" said Dhruv.While earlier bidding for a direct entry into the I-League, the group had said they ""possess significant land in New Delhi, which we have earmarked for, and envision as, the centre of our operations and the future home of our football team and football in Delhi.""

Bombay Sport Exchange Ep 5: Shane Watson on IPL, India-Australia rivalry | Part 1

Poll Who do you think has been the best player for Real Madrid in La Liga this season? Vinicius Jr Thibaut Courtois Kylian Mbappe

Real Madrid 's title hopes in La Liga were hanging on by a thread ever since the 4-3 loss to rivals and likely winners Barcelona earlier last week. However, the Los Blancos' title hopes, no matter how small, almost came to a halt after narrowly escaping a draw in La Liga on Thursday. With Carlo Ancelotti's departure confirmed, the Spanish giant's only hope of securing a title is in the rare outcome that Barca fails to win all three of their remaining games in the competition.The defending league champions were up against 9th placed Mallorca at the Santiago Bernabeu, needing a win to sustain any hope of not letting Barcelona win the title. However, things did not start off well for the hosts as they went a goal behind in the first ten minutes. A composed finish from inside the penalty area, placing the ball out of reach for a diving Thibaut Courtois put Real in a precarious spot.Needing at least two goals to get back in the game, the men in white started sending in a flurry of shots from outside the penalty box. However, Mallorca keeper Leo Roman’s 10 saves throughout the game gave Real a difficult time in finding the net.The goals finally came for Real in the second half, when Kylian Mbappe found the net in the 68th minute. The Frenchman wriggled through the Mallorca defence and adeptly found the bottom right corner. With the shift in momentum, Real finally found themselves on the front foot.An impressive second half between the sticks for Roman came undone in what proved to be one of the last kicks of the game, as Real centre-back Jacobo Ramon forced the ball over the Mallorca keeper, winning it at the death. The win means that Real now have 78 points from 36 games, but will see their bitter rivals Barcelona crowned champions if they manage to win their game in hand against Espanyol on Friday.","Real Madrid beat Mallorca 1-0 at the Santiago Bernabeu.

Lionel Messi is to unveil his favorite goal for the first time

Refik Anadol to create AI-generated artwork for charity auction

In a first-of-a-kind partnership between football and AI, Lionel Messi will unveil his all-time favorite goal and an AI-generated artwork of the goal by Turkish artist Refik Anadol . This one-of-a-kind art will be auctioned, with the proceeds to go to charity to help fund education in Latin America.Lionel Messi, one of the best footballers in the world and has scored over 800 goals in his career. Although a majority of these objectives have achieved legendary status, Messi has never publicly announced which is his favorite goal. On May 22, however, that will change with the announcement of his all-time favorite goal in a special event held by the Inter Miami CF Foundation . That revelation is a revealing one for Messi, giving fans a little bit of insight into the personal meaning of perhaps his most prized on-field accomplishment.After Messi has made the selection, one goal will be commissioned as a groundbreaking new work of art by Refik Anadol, a trailblazer in the field of AI and data-driven art. Anadol’s practice, which is often called “data paintings,” processes massive datasets to create dazzling visual experiences. For this project, he will use stats about the chosen goal, including match statistics, player distance covered, and fan emotion, to generate a dynamic and abstract representation of the goal. The piece will be revealed at New York auction house Christie's on June 11, with Messi autographing the work himself to give it a personal touch.The auction supports education in Latin America and is focused on improving access to education in five Latin American countries. This comes in the wake of Messi's long career of charitable giving - the forward has teamed up with the likes of the United Nations and the Leo Messi Foundation to help children around the world, regardless of race or social class, find their right to education and opportunity.The collaboration between Messi and Anadol will pay tribute to a major moment in the history of football, but also highlights the crossover of sports, art, and philanthropy. Through the process of turning an unforgettable goal into a work of art, the project is also giving fans a new way to get closer to the sport, while raising money for good causes. Now, with the world waiting to see Messi’s favourite goal and the resulting artwork, most notably, the project is proof of the power of art and sport to make a difference.Also Read: 'Don't compare myself to Lionel Messi': Barcelona's young sensation Lamine Yamal","Lionel Messi is to unveil his favorite goal for the first time on May 22.

In talking about the teenage forward, Thiago Alcantara stressed the need to develop him, without placing limits on him. “Let him be enjoying himself,” he said. “We don’t have to cap him, so that he can keep on improving. We have to provide him with the tools to be consistent in the amazing thing that he is.The former Bayern Munich and Barcelona midfielder also praised the composure and maturity displayed by young defenders Pau Cubarsi and Eric Garcia, who were pretty impressive in their “incredible” performances at their young ages.Thiago Alcantara pointed out that tactical genius is not the only reason why Barcelona is attractive. “It is seen from a more tactical or technical perspective by us who have been there,” he explained. Today, we just cannot avoid mentioning the magic that the kids, the coaching staff, and the club make for you as a sports fan… The magic of Barça goes beyond what is in football”.The win against Real Madrid is another milestone in the remarkable turnaround season that Barcelona has been having under Hansi Flick.

Man City and Leverkusen reach verbal agreement

Bayern Munich is still in the race, but may have to wait

The 22-year-old German midfielder of Bayer Leverkusen, Florian Wirtz, is now among the best subjects for a transfer in Europe. Manchester City and Bayern Munich are already interested in signing him before the coming summer transfer window. His excellent form this season has impressed clubs across Europe. Wirtz and his family have already flown to England for discussions with City officials, while Bayern have also reached an agreement on personal terms. The situation is heating up as both clubs prepare their final moves.Manchester City and Bayer Leverkusen have made a verbal agreement for Florian Wirtz’s transfer. The Premier League champions want to bring Wirtz in as a long-term replacement for Kevin De Bruyne. Pep Guardiola has also talked with Wirtz face-to-face to lay out his plans and his role at City.Leverkusen wants to sell Wirtz to a foreign club rather than to the Bundesliga rivals Bayern Munich. City is ready to come up with a better offer than Bayern and is only slightly hesitant about Leverkusen’s asking price of roughly €150 million. City officials are confident after hosting Wirtz and his family in England for face-to-face discussions.Bayern Munich is also pushing hard to sign Wirtz. They have already agreed on a five-year deal with the player’s camp. However, Bayer Leverkusen does not want to sell him to a direct rival in Germany. This gives Man City a big advantage in the transfer race.Bayern are ready to wait until next year if they cannot reach a deal this summer. They are hoping that Leverkusen will lower their price. But that may not happen because City are willing to pay more. Leverkusen’s coach Xabi Alonso, who is set to join Real Madrid, also wants Wirtz to follow him to Spain. However, Madrid is behind in the race as of now.Wirtz has not yet made his final decision. His family is happy with the idea of joining Bayern, but the player himself also likes the opportunity to play abroad. With City making serious efforts and Wirtz already in England for talks, the transfer could happen soon.Also Read: FA Cup final 2025: Match date and kick-off time for Crystal Palace vs Man City","Man City and Bayer Leverkusen reach verbal agreement for Florian Wirtz.

Poll Do you think international organizations should intervene in labor issues in host countries of major events? No, it's a sovereign matter Only if there are serious violations Yes, definitely

Human Rights Watch on Wednesday said grave abuses were being committed on giant construction sites in Saudi Arabia and warned the risks to migrant workers could increase as the building of stadiums for the 2034 World Cup gathers pace.HRW said ""scores of migrant workers in Saudi Arabia die in gruesome yet avoidable workplace-related accidents, including falling from buildings, electrocution, and even decapitation"".The NGO, which has studied nearly 50 cases of deaths in Saudi Arabia, said Saudi authorities had ""failed to adequately protect workers from preventable deaths, investigate workplace safety incidents, and ensure timely and adequate compensation for families"" including through life insurance policies and benefits to survivors.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW! ""The risks of occupational deaths and injuries are further increasing as the Saudi government ramps up construction work for the 2034 World Cup as well as other 'giga-projects',"" HRW added.The Gulf kingdom was handed the right to host the 2034 World Cup at a FIFA Congress last December despite concerns about its human rights record, the risks to migrant labourers and criminalization of same-sex relationships. It was the only candidate.The NGO called on FIFA to ensure all work-related deaths in Saudi Arabia are properly investigated and that bereaved families receive compensation.FIFA has committed to establishing a workers' welfare system, which it says includes ""dedicated mandatory standards and enforcement mechanisms applicable to all companies and workers involved in... World Cup-related construction and service delivery"" in Saudi Arabia.But HRW said football's world governing body did not provide ""details on concrete measures to prevent, investigate, and compensate migrant worker deaths such as risk-based heat protection measures or life insurance"".The NGO claimed ""FIFA is knowingly risking yet another tournament that will unnecessarily come at a grave human cost"", referencing the decision to award the 2022 World Cup to Qatar.Similar concerns over workers' welfare dogged Qatar ahead of its hosting of international football's showpiece tournament. Amnesty International and other rights groups claimed thousands of migrant workers died in the lead-up to the 2022 tournament, though Doha has said only 37 workers on World Cup projects perished -- and only three in work-related accidents.HRW stated in its report that the majority of migrant worker deaths in Saudi Arabia are attributed to ""natural causes"" and are therefore neither investigated nor compensated. According to figures provided by the NGO, for example, 74 percent of 1,420 Indian migrant worker deaths recorded at the Indian embassy in Riyadh in 2023 were attributed to natural causes.HRW added ""even work-related death cases categorized as such in a migrant worker's death certificate are sometimes not compensated as they should be according to Saudi law and international labour standards"". ""In migrant death cases that are compensated, the process is long and burdensome,"" the report said, providing an example of one such compensation process that took a decade to be completed.""My sons are 11 and 13 years old. When my husband died, they were 11 months and two years old. If we had received compensation right after his death, it would have provided so much relief,"" the wife of a deceased worker, who was not named, told HRW.In response to the report, FIFA shared with AFP a letter it sent last month to HRW from its secretary general Mattias Grafstrom. The letter says Saudi Arabia has ""in the past years been investing heavily in the development of its society and economy"", using international companies.Grafstrom notes that Saudi Arabia ""has taken significant steps to reform its labour laws since 2018"", including the abolition of parts of the kafala system which ties workers to their employers, and introducing standardised contracts for workers. The Saudi government, he says, has also committed to working with the United Nations' International Labour Organization (ILO) ""on the further expansion and effective implementation of these reforms"".""In line with its human rights commitments, FIFA seeks to play its part in ensuring strong protections for workers employed by third parties in the construction of FIFA World Cup sites,"" Grafstrom adds.",Human Rights Watch says grave abuses are being committed on giant construction sites in Saudi Arabia.

The Tokyo E-Prix is just around the corner, and it presents yet another opportunity to boost the participation of women in motorsport . Formula E has implemented the FIA Girls on Track program, which aims to raise the percentage of female involvement by inviting young women aged 12 to 18 to explore, free of charge, various facets of motorsport and its industry through a series of activities, workshops, and behind-the-scenes access. Currently, only 1.5 percent of all license holders globally are women.FIA Girls on Track will welcome up to 120 young women during the Tokyo E-Prix race week. The participants will engage in workshops, gaming sessions, career talks, and a Pit Lane walk throughout the event, fostering empowerment and education in motorsport and engineering. The program maintains its emphasis on STEM education and gender inclusivity in motorsport, actively reaching out to girls from diverse backgrounds in each host city.In addition to on-site programming, off-site activities will include an immersive E-Karting masterclass, also open to up to 120 young women. This initiative is designed to offer hands-on experience and exposure to E-Karting, aligning with Formula E’s broader social impact mission of involving and engaging local communities at every race location.Japanese-American racing driver and content creator Hana Burton, along with active rally driver Maaya Orido—who competes in the XCR Sprint Cup Hokkaido and Rally Hokkaido—will also be present at the event.

The ABB FIA Formula E World Championship returns to Tokyo for Rounds 8 and 9, as the Tokyo E-Prix double header prepares to electrify the city’s street circuit with cutting-edge Gen3 Evo cars this weekend. After making its debut last year, the Tokyo race is back—poised to raise the bar even higher this season. Here's everything you need to know about the circuit set in the heart of Japan’s bustling capital.Formula E’s official X account recently shared a graphic video representation of the Tokyo Street Circuit , offering fans a clear glimpse of the track layout to be used for the upcoming races. The video highlights key features such as the Attack Mode zone, the acceleration zone, and the overtaking zone.Winner Maximilian Guenther had said after winning the Tokyo race last year, “The track is phenomenal. It’s super technical and super challenging for us and the teams to set everything up properly. To get super close to the walls, you have to have good confidence in the car, and there’s even jumps that we have in a lap, so it’s a big mixture of everything! For me that is what Formula E is all about, to race so tight around these street circuits.”Jaguar TCS Racing driver Nick Cassidy, who earned the ABB Driver of Progress Award with 12 overtakes during the race, praised the track as well. Reflecting on his experience, he said, “It was a mega, a proper Formula E track. Bumps, fast corners, on the limit and you’ve really got to attack in qualifying. I thought the track was fantastic.”Set in the heart of Tokyo Bay , the 2.575km circuit features 18 turns and boasts a compact, technical layout that includes three long straights and three chicane sequences.

What a race. What a day. What a feeling. Started from pole, dropped back to P9, and then fought back to take the win in the final corners, on the final lap. This one means everything! Today is a true testament to the hard work we’ve put in as a team over the past months, and it’s only the beginning. A massive thank you to everyone at @dsperformance and @ds_penske_fe, both here at the track and back at the factory.

He summed up his Monaco experience in a post that read: “Racing on the iconic streets of Monaco is always special. 🇲🇨 After a strong qualifying, we lined up P3 and gave it everything out there today. Unfortunately, we didn’t have the race pace and crossed the line in P8. Not the easiest weekend, but still walking away with two points finishes here.

Nick Cassidy shares glimpses of his podium win and personal life



Nick Cassidy was a relieved man as he stood on the third spot on the podium at the Monaco E-Prix Round 7 on Sunday. The Jaguar TCS Racing driver confessed he was actually “jumping up and down” on the inside as he reached the podium for the first time this season. However, it is his third consecutive podium at the Monaco E-Prix, his home race. A day after the race, Cassidy made multiple attempts to at least share a post to mark his first Formula E win of the year before finally dropping a bunch of stunning pictures on his Instagram page.Nick Cassidy shared a picture of himself holding the trophy at the Monaco E-Prix Round 7 on Instagram on Monday, along with several stunning pictures of his family and more. He wrote, “Not on here much these days.. No other way around it - been a super tough start to the year and it’s great to have an awesome Podium in Monaco with @jaguarracing. 3 years in a row on the steps at home is super special. Thanks to all those in my corner.”Just before dropping the post, he took to his Instagram Stories to share a screenshot of his many attempts at making an Instagram post to assure his followers that he was trying to share at least one post on the special occasion.Nick had won the Monaco E-Prix once in 2023 when he was racing for Envision Racing and had taken the second podium spot in 2024 with Jaguar TCS Racing.

Oliver Rowland couldn’t translate his pole into victory in Monaco Round 7





There is no stopping Oliver Rowland , who had double gains at the recently held Monaco E-Prix double-header and is “really pleased” with his position in Round 7. The Nissan driver won Round 6 and had said, “Normally you’d be looking forward to the champagne, but you’ve already got one eye on tomorrow.” He did keep the champagne celebrations under control after his win in Monaco and yielded results with his podium finish the next day.Oliver Rowland had won the pole position and was confidently leading in the first half of the race, but as if the pole curse continues to be in place ever since 2022, he couldn’t manage to cross the finish line first. It was Envision Racing’s Sébastien Buemi who ended his more than six-year-long wait for a win by lifting the winner’s trophy on Day 2 of the Monaco E-Prix. Only António Félix da Costa had managed to translate his pole into a victory at the Formula E Monaco race in 2021.Sharing his take on the Monaco race, Rowland said, “I think honestly when he [Buemi] took his Attack Mode, he knew I had more to do — I think he was trying to back me into the pack, so when I took it, I lost quite a lot. But, first and second here doesn’t get much better, so I’m really, really pleased. We just need to keep pushing. We’ve got Tokyo next week where I was really strong last year, so hopefully we can have a real big push for that double-header and then keep pushing in the right direction.”Many believed Rowland was in his own race as he took a three-second lead in the first half. However, he lunged at the chicane on Lap 21, and it was Buemi who surpassed him at the right time. The Nissan driver's move was later judged over-exuberant by the stewards, forcing him to cede the position to Jean-Éric Vergne in recompense, but the damage cost the DS Penske driver a crack at the race win, as Mahindra Racing's Nyck de Vries and Buemi made it by as Vergne bogged down in avoiding action.Rowland once again gave up the lead to Vergne as he took his final mandatory 50kW, four-wheel drive Attack Mode activation, to use that overlap of extra power and traction to push past Vergne and de Vries on Laps 23 and 24 respectively, for second place at the flag, some four seconds back from Buemi.Also Read: Monaco E-Prix Round 6 winner Oliver Rowland delays celebrations for Round 7: “Normally you’d be looking forward to the champagne but…” Up next is the Tokyo double-header on May 17 and 18.

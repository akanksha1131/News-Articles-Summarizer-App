Rohit Sharma's hundred hailed as a 'boost' for India ahead of Champions Trophy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/england-tour-of-india-2025/rohit-sharmas-hundred-hailed-as-a-boost-for-india-ahead-of-champions-trophy/articleshow/118100901.cms,"Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel.

NEW DELHI: Senior all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja stated on Sunday that Rohit Sharma 's Indian teammates were unfazed by the harsh criticism coming from all sides since they knew their captain was only a knock away from returning to his best.In a spectacular response to his detractors, the 37-year-old Indian captain smashed his 32nd ODI century, a 90-ball 119, to lead India to a four-wicket victory against England in Cuttack sealing the series with one game remaining.His value to the team was further reinforced by the fact that the innings came just weeks before the Champions Trophy ""The entire world may be behind him but in our dressing room, there was no such atmosphere. He is such a great player that he knows exactly how to build an innings,"" Jadeja said at the post-match media interaction.The all-rounder went on to say that great players go through these stages.""It's just a matter of one good inning. As you saw, it didn't even feel like he hadn't scored runs in the previous innings. The shots he played were smooth and he looked confident. Just played normal strokes.""Despite criticism from outside, Jadeja emphasized that there was never any panic among the group.""Sometimes, it just takes one or two innings to turn things around. The good thing is that, before an important tournament like the Champions Trophy, scoring a hundred is a huge boost. It's great for the team, and obviously, he himself knows his game well. There's nothing much to think or discuss.""Asked how was the mood after he got to his triple, Jadeja said: ""Obviously, as I just mentioned, before a big tournament, if any batsman scores a hundred, it boosts confidence both for the individual and the team.""If your top-order batsmen are scoring runs, you will always get a good start. In ODI cricket, if you get a good start in the first 10-15 overs, it sets the platform for the death overs, where you can capitalise.""Following their decision to bat, England amassed 304 runs in 49.5 overs, with Jadeja (3/35) once again playing a key role in containing their attack.Despite playing ODIs for the first time in almost two years, Jadeja attributed his ability to keep his rhythm to domestic cricket.""No, it feels really good, especially after almost two years-since the World Cup. Coming back into this format requires quick adaptation, but I believe the domestic matches I played helped me a lot.""In those matches, I bowled over 30 overs, which helped me maintain my rhythm. Even in Tests, I tried to maintain the same line and length in ODIs.""The rhythm remained intact because the break wasn't too long. So, I think playing domestic games benefitted me in maintaining my rhythm.""",Rohit Sharma scored his 32nd ODI century to lead India to a four-wicket victory against England in Cuttack sealing the series with one game remaining.

NEW DELHI: former Indian cricketer Harbhajan Singh believes India would have an advantage over Pakistan in their highly awaited match in the 2025 ICC Champions Trophy since they will be accustomed to the pitches in Dubai.Speaking to ANI, Singh said, ""The hype is being created regarding the India-Pakistan match...the team that is going to adjust better with the pitch will get a better result...India has an advantage, it will play all its matches in Dubai so it will have an idea about the pitch and conditions. Overall I feel the Indian team is better than the Pakistan team and the result will be in favour of India...""The former Indian bowler further emphasized that although Jasprit Bumrah cannot be replaced, his absence gives players like Mohammed Shami and Arshdeep Singh the chance to step up and assume responsibility.""When a player like Bumrah is not playing, someone else has to step up and take responsibility. No one can truly replace Bumrah, but his absence creates an opportunity for others to showcase their abilities. Players like Arshdeep and Shami have a chance to make an impact and prove themselves,"" he added.Then, in spite of recent criticism regarding their form, Harbhajan supported Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma to demonstrate their ability to win matches at the Champions Trophy ""Virat and Rohit haven't scored as many runs as expected, given their past performances. The expectations are high, and when they fall short, criticism is natural. However, with the Champions Trophy ahead, they have a great opportunity to showcase their abilities and prove how they can still win matches for India. If they don't succeed, naturally, the young players waiting in the wings will start getting more opportunities.

NEW DELHI: Skipper Rohit Sharma roared back to form ahead of the Champions Trophy on Sunday, scoring his 32nd ODI century in India's four-wicket victory over England in Cuttack.After his whirlwind 90-ball 119 that included 12 fours and 7 sixes, Rohit attributed his success to breaking down his batting approach during the chase of 305.Alongside Rohit, Shubman Gill hit 60 while Shreyas Iyer and and Axar Patel scored 44 and 41 not out respectively, taking India to an unassailable 2-0 lead in series.“It was good and really enjoyed being out there, scoring some runs for the team. Important game with the series on the line but I broke it down to pieces about how I wanted to bat. Longer than T20s and shorter than Tests and I wanted to break it down. I wanted to bat as deep as possible and that was my focus.“Looking at the pitch - when you play on black soil, it tends to skid on a bit and you have to show the full face of the bat initially. Then they bowled into the body and kept it on the stumps and that's where I prepared my plan and tried to access the gaps,” said Rohit, who got Player of the Match award, in the post-game presentation ceremony.Prior to the match in Cuttack, concerns had grown over Rohit's poor form and batting readiness for the upcoming Champions Trophy. He dispelled the doubts, pulling off a masterclass in the tricky chase.Rohit praised the support from his batting partners Gill and Iyer, with whom he formed partnerships of 136 and 70 runs respectively.“Got very good support from Gill and Shreyas as well. Enjoy batting with Gill. Very classy player and doesn't seem to get overawed by the situation and the numbers are there as well, if I'm not wrong, for Gill,” he added.The Indian bowling also attack performed well, with Ravindra Jadeja taking 3 for 35 and debutant Varun Chakravarthy claiming 1 for 54.“The middle overs are quite important and that's where the game can go either side. If you squeeze the middle overs, you need not worry much about the death. The middle overs is very crucial and even in Nagpur, we squeezed them and got wickets. When you keep taking wickets, the run-scoring is not easy.""With the final game in Ahmedabad now a dead rubber, Rohit emphasized India's commitment to overall improvement.“We want to keep getting better as well. Nothing specific we want to work on but overall we want to keep getting better as a player and team. That is what we want to do. As long as guys are clear about what they are supposed to do, if they keep doing that not much to think about,” he added.",Rohit Sharma scores 32nd ODI century in India's four-wicket victory over England in Cuttack.

'ILT20 is great for UAE cricket': Sehwag anticipates thrilling finale

NEW DELHI: Former Pakistan wicketkeeper-batter Kamran Akmal believes that pushing Babar Azam to open the innings is damaging both his confidence and Pakistan’s team balance.With Saim Ayub unavailable, Babar partnered with Fakhar Zaman at the top during Pakistan’s opening match of the ODI tri-series against New Zealand. However, his struggles continued as he managed only 10 off 23 balls. Kamran feels this tactical shift is hurting both Babar and the team’s overall stability.""You are making Babar open. With this decision, the team combination is ruined, and so is Babar's confidence,"" Kamran commented on his YouTube channel.Since returning from South Africa, where he notched three consecutive fifties in Tests, Babar’s form has dipped. His struggles began against the West Indies in Multan last month, and the slump has carried into ODIs.In the tri-series opener, Babar’s attempt to regain form at the top of the order backfired, extending his century drought since his 151-run masterclass against Nepal in August 2023.His decline started on Multan’s turning pitches during the West Indies series. In Pakistan’s 127-run win in the first Test, he managed just 8(20) and 5(11).The second Test saw him falter again, falling for 1(5) in the first innings before showing some resilience with a 31(67) in the second. However, West Indies spinners Gudakesh Motie and Kevin Sinclair continued to trouble him.With the ICC Champions Trophy looming on February 19, Babar will be eager to rediscover his touch and regain his lost rhythm before Pakistan’s title defence begins.","Former Pakistan wicketkeeper-batter Kamran Akmal believes that pushing Babar Azam to open the innings is damaging both his confidence and Pakistan’s team balance.

India captain Rohit Sharma 's long wait to return to form ended with a blistering half-century against England in the second ODI at Cuttack on Sunday, where the veteran opener entertained the crowd with his signature strokes to launch India's big chase.India, who lead the three-match series 1-0, bowled England out for 304 after the visitors won the toss and decided to bat first in their must-win game.Rohit took just 30 balls to reach the half-century while batting with a positive intent, which first showed up in the second over of India's chase, when he smashed pacer Gus Atkinson for a four and six off consecutive deliveries, and deposited Saqib Mahmood in the stands for two more maximums inside the first five overs.A faulty light tower at the stadium halted India's charge, while Rohit was firing all cylinders alongside his deputy and fellow opener Shubman Gill.But it was business as usual upon return to the park as Rohit brought up his fifty with his fourth four, besides as many sixes. A cut off leg-spinner Adil Rashid crossed the boundary ropes, bringing loud cheers from the crowd.Rohit had scored just two runs in the first ODI and came into this series after his previous five international innings, which was during the Border Gavaskar Trophy in Australia, had produced just 31 runs.But the knock on Sunday should silence all Rohit doubters as the skipper looked at the top of his game and seems to be warming up nicely for the ICC Champions Trophy, which begins after this series, on February 19.",Rohit Sharma scores blistering half-century in second ODI against England.

Liverpool humbled as Plymouth claim shock FA Cup victory,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/epl/top-stories/liverpool-humbled-as-plymouth-claim-shock-fa-cup-victory/articleshow/118094679.cms,"Ryan Hardie. (Pic Credit - X)

Liverpool suffered a humiliating FA Cup exit as Championship strugglers Plymouth ended their quadruple hopes with a stunning 1-0 victory in the fourth round on Sunday.Arne Slot ’s decision to field a weakened team backfired spectacularly, with Ryan Hardie’s second-half penalty securing Plymouth’s memorable triumph at Home Park.Slot made 10 changes from the side that dominated Tottenham 4-0 in the League Cup semi-final second leg, resting key players like Virgil van Dijk Mohamed Salah , Andrew Robertson, and Cody Gakpo. However, the gamble proved costly, marking a rare misstep in an otherwise stellar debut season for the former Feyenoord boss.Liverpool’s fourth defeat across all competitions this season also represented only the third time they had failed to score under Slot. More significantly, it was just the fourth instance of a Premier League leader being knocked out of the FA Cup by a lower-division club.The Reds must now regroup quickly ahead of the Merseyside derby against Everton at Goodison Park on Wednesday. A victory there would extend their lead over second-placed Arsenal to nine points in the title race. Meanwhile, they remain contenders in the Champions League last 16 and will face Newcastle in the League Cup final in March.Plymouth manager Miron Muslic masterminded one of the FA Cup’s greatest giant-killings while battling to lift his team from the bottom of the Championship. Muslic, a refugee from war-torn Bosnia, moved to Austria at the age of nine after fleeing his besieged hometown of Bihac in 1992.Having already eliminated Premier League side Brentford in the third round, Plymouth entered the match buoyed by their first league victory since November, a 3-2 win over West Brom. Their determined display against Liverpool will go down in FA Cup history.Playing under a wintry sun on the Devon coast, Liverpool’s under-strength squad suffered an early blow when Joe Gomez limped off injured in the first half. The Reds struggled to generate attacking momentum, with Plymouth’s relentless energy frustrating their efforts.James McConnell’s long-range strike in the 36th minute forced a save from Conor Hazard, but Liverpool otherwise lacked cutting edge.The breakthrough came in the 54th minute when Darko Gyabi’s overhead kick struck Harvey Elliott’s raised arm, leading to a clear penalty. Hardie calmly sent Caoimhin Kelleher the wrong way to put Plymouth ahead.Late pressure from Liverpool saw Diogo Jota and Darwin Nunez denied by superb saves from Hazard, as Home Park erupted in celebration at the final whistle.Elsewhere in the FA Cup, Wolves secured a 2-0 win at Blackburn, scoring twice in 39 seconds. Joao Gomes’ shot slipped past Balazs Toth in the 33rd minute, before Matheus Cunha’s blistering strike doubled the lead moments later.Struggling just two points above the Premier League relegation zone, Wolves welcomed the distraction of cup success as they advanced to the fifth round.Meanwhile, Tottenham boss Ange Postecoglou faces mounting pressure ahead of their clash against Aston Villa. Having previously claimed he always wins a trophy in his second season, the Australian manager is running out of opportunities to keep that promise if Spurs exit the FA Cup.",Plymouth beat Liverpool 1-0 in the fourth round of the FA Cup. Ryan Hardie scored the only goal of the game from the penalty spot. It was just the fourth time a Premier League leader was knocked out by a lower-division club.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118094656,imgsize-57208,width-400,resizemode-4/118094656.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Kylian Mbappe 's timely strike secured a hard-fought 1-1 draw for Real Madrid against their fierce rivals Atletico Madrid in a tense La Liga encounter on Saturday.The result maintained Los Blancos' slender one-point lead over Atletico at the top of the table, while also keeping Barcelona within striking distance in third place.The match was a closely contested affair, with both sides displaying their defensive resilience and intensity. Atletico drew first blood in the first half through Julian Alvarez 's controversial penalty, which was awarded after a VAR review for a clumsy challenge by Aurelien Tchouameni on Samuel Lino.Alvarez coolly converted the spot-kick with a cheeky Panenka, much to the frustration of the Real Madrid faithful, who vented their anger towards the officials.However, Real Madrid responded swiftly in the second half, with Mbappe pouncing on a rebound from Jude Bellingham 's blocked shot to level the scores. The French striker's goal on his debut in the heated derby clash underlined his importance to the team and his ability to deliver in crucial moments.The second half saw Real Madrid take control of the proceedings, with Bellingham twice coming agonizingly close to putting his side ahead. The England international's headed efforts were denied by the woodwork and a fine save from Atletico goalkeeper Jan Oblak, who also produced crucial stops to deny Vinicius Junior, Rodrygo, and Mbappe.Despite their dominance, Real Madrid could not find the elusive winner, leaving both teams to settle for a share of the spoils. The result left Carlo Ancelotti 's side clinging to their narrow lead at the summit, while Atletico will rue their inability to capitalize on their first-half advantage.In his post-match comments, Ancelotti acknowledged his team's disappointment at not securing all three points but expressed satisfaction with their continued leadership of the league.""The team is disappointed because they think they deserved more... but we're happy because we're still leaders,"" Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti told reporters. ""In the second half we had total control, we had a lot of chances.""Atletico coach Diego Simeone , on the other hand, lamented his side's lack of composure in front of goal, particularly in the first half.""We had a good first half, but we weren't relaxed enough in front of goal to (score) more,"" said Simeone. ""In the end it was a draw in which both teams think they could have taken more from it.""The hard-fought draw sets the stage for an intriguing midweek clash, as Real Madrid prepare to face Pep Guardiola's Manchester City in the first leg of the Champions League play-off round.Meanwhile, the La Liga title race remains delicately poised, with Barcelona given an opportunity to close the gap on the top two when they face Sevilla on Sunday.",Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid draw 1-1 in La Liga derby on Saturday.

NEW DELHI: Kaoru Mitoma's brilliance propelled Brighton to a 2-1 victory over Chelsea , eliminating the Blues from the FA Cup in the fourth round. Meanwhile, Kevin De Bruyne 's late strike rescued Manchester City from an upset against third-tier club Leyton Orient, securing a 2-1 win.Chelsea's domestic trophy drought, which stretches back to their 2018 FA Cup triumph, will continue for another season after their lead at the Amex Stadium evaporated.An early own goal from Brighton keeper Bart Verbruggen gifted Chelsea the advantage, but the hosts responded emphatically.Georginio Rutter's well-taken header levelled the score, and Mitoma's deft finish in the 57th minute completed Brighton's comeback, despite Chelsea's protests over a potential handball. Enzo Maresca, Chelsea's interim manager, lamented the lack of VAR but acknowledged the result's consequences.""I think the handball is quite clear. Without VAR it's complicated,"" Maresca said.""The second half the only shots they had we conceded a goal from. We had a few chances at 2-1. But you have to take the consequence of the result.""At Brisbane Road, Manchester City found themselves trailing after Jamie Donley's long-range effort deflected off goalkeeper Stefan Ortega and into the net.The champions eventually equalized through Abdukodir Khusanov's deflected strike before De Bruyne's late intervention secured their passage to the next round.Pep Guardiola praised the FA Cup's unpredictability and the atmosphere generated by the Orient faithful, although he expressed concern over the injury sustained by new signing Nico Gonzalez.""It was a typical FA Cup game, that is why this competition is unbelievable.

SHILLONG: Football frenzy was at its peak as the city welcomed Indian Super League and hoped to see NorthEast United FC script a memorable win and star striker Alaaeddine Ajaraie break the league’s goalscoring record at the revamped Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium here on Friday.But while there was no dearth in their support – with a Alaaeddine fan getting into the ground and hugging his hero in the 62nd minute – Juan Pedro Benali’s men could not live up to the expectation as Mumbai City FC won 2-0 with goals from two former NEUFC players – Bipin Singh (41’) and Lallianzuala Chhangte (90+2’).The victory meant that the visitors leapfrogged both NEUFC and Bengaluru FC to go fourth with 31 points from 19 games while the hosts went a rung down to fifth with 29 points from 20 matches.With the fervent northeastern fans behind them, NEUFC started the game with gusto despite the celsius scale tipping to 10 degrees in what might be the coldest ISL fixture this season.It was the hosts, looking to make a winning start in their ‘second home’, who kept pushing ahead and creating moves to break the Mumbai City defence. Jithin MS and Nestor Albiach looked menacing on the left wing as they tried feeding the ball to Alaaeddine in the middle.The cheers of “Alaaeddine, Alaaeddine” around the revamped and upgraded venue appeared to have done the trick in the 8th minute when a Macarton cross reached the Moroccan in the box. However, to the disbelief of the fans, his header went just over the bar.But the constant attacks by NEUFC did not ebb as Petr Kratky’s men maintained a very deep line of defence, led by the in-form Mehtab Singh in the centre. And while NEUFC kept bombarding with attacks, Alaaeddine and Co. were unable to find a breakthrough in the final third.It was against the run of play and from a half chance that the visitors eventually broke the deadlock in the 41st minute.Bipin delayed his run to meet a Fernandez cross inside the box from the right and headed the ball in that dropped before Gurmeet Singh but still ricocheted into the goal for the Mumbai City breakthrough and brought the till-then cheers from the stands to complete silence.Benali’s men tried to regroup fast and restarted their quest to break the Mumbai City defence. But nothing seemed to be working for them as the first half ended with the visitors in the lead.Soon after the change of ends, NEUFC got a free-kick in a dangerous spot outside the box. But Nestor’s shot was easily punched out by Mumbai custodian Purba Lachenpa in the 49th minute. Incessant moves by NEUFC in the Mumbai half, only to find them curtailed by the visitors’ final line of defence continued to be the script for most of the remaining time.The match, which saw seven yellow cards being shown by the referee, was starting to get ill-tempered when it was taken beyond the hosts’ grip by none other than northeast’s very own Chhangte.Getting at the end of a long cross from the Mumbai box by Tiri, skipper Chhangte put his skills on display to beat the NEUFC defenders and send a shot that Gurmeet got a touch to but could not stop from rolling into the goal.",Mumbai City FC won 2-0 with goals from Bipin Singh (41’) and Lallianzuala Chhangte (90+2’).

PANAJI: The Derbi Madrileno or Madrid Derby holds plenty of promise. A depleted Real Madrid and a fired up Atletico Madrid are separated by just a point after 22 matches at the top of the Liga table.When the teams met earlier in the season, it ended 1-1, a feisty game that saw Atletico grab a stoppage time equaliser. The return leg could be a potentially season-defining clash at the Santiago Bernabeu on Saturday, even though Real Madrid are handicapped with several absentees, particularly in defence. Carlo Ancelotti ’s Real are now without Antonio Rudiger and David Alaba, who joined the sick bay alongside right-back Dani Carvajal, regular centre-back Eder Militao and midfielder Eduardo Camavinga.Even a makeshift defence will not dampen Madrid’s enthusiasm at home, feels Diego Forlan, the former Uruguay striker who spent five years at crosstown rivals Atletico (2007-2011) and won the Golden Boot in 2009, during which he scored 32 goals.""I don't think there's any advantage (for Atletico) because of the injuries,"" Forlan told TOI during a global media interaction, arranged by La Liga earlier this week. ""Real Madrid have a deep squad with so much quality. Many important players will be missing, but with a squad that Madrid possess, they are still at the top of the table. Even though they don't have the regular starting XI, I'm sure it's a team that you have to respect, because they will have others (who can dominate).""Forlan scored over 300 goals in a storied career that won him the Golden Ball for the best player at the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa. At the club level, the Uruguayan striker won the Pichichi Trophy — the award for the top goalscorer in a La Liga season — at both Atletico and Villareal. Yet, when it came to the Madrid Derby, Forlan didn't taste similar success.In his four seasons at Atletico between 2007 and 2011, Forlan played eight Madrid derbies that resulted in seven losses and one draw. The lack of success wasn't Forlan's fault; between 1999 and 2013, Atletico didn't win in 25 meetings with Madrid, until the arrival of Diego Simeone eventually changed their fortunes. ""Well, we were close to winning against Real Madrid on several occasions but lost or drew. That trend has now changed. So, whether you're playing at home or away, I think the Derby is a lot more equal today. They are now playing on more equal footing,"" said Forlan.It is Simeone's arrival at Atletico that has helped restore the balance. In the 41 derbies played since then, Atletico have won 12, drawing 14 and losing 15. Madrid, though, continue to be the giants, so does Atletico have anything to prove to their city rivals or the world?""There's nothing to prove, you know, for a side that has been great for the last 10 years, winning lots of trophies (even) at the European level. They've made it to the final of the UEFA Champions League (losing to Madrid). This is an important derby, like El Clasico. Atletico and Madrid have always had great players, the derbies were spectacular. Today, the stakes are a lot higher since it's being watched all over the world,"" said Forlan.While Madrid are struggling at the back, their attacking players are fit and firing. There's Kylian Mbappe – playing his first derby after missing the first leg -- Rodrygo and Vinicius, all striking form. At the other end, there's Julian Alvarez, Antonio Griezmann and, of course, Simeone's son Giuliano, ""a real fighter with similar characteristics (like his father), one of the best signings.""",Diego Forlan feels the Derbi Madrileno is now similar to El Clasico.

NEW DELHI: Manchester United 's FA Cup defence remained alive as they staged a remarkable comeback to defeat Leicester City 2-1 on Friday night at Old Trafford.The match witnessed a fairytale return for former United striker Ruud van Nistelrooy , who was in the opposition dugout as Leicester's interim manager.The first half was a frustrating affair for the home side, as they struggled to create meaningful chances.Leicester took the lead in the 42nd minute through Bobby De Cordova-Reid, who nodded home from close range after Wilfred Ndidi 's initial effort was saved by Andre Onana.United's manager, Ruben Amorim , recognised the need for a change and introduced Alejandro Garnacho at halftime, a move that proved to be a game-changer. The young Argentine winger injected pace and directness into United's attack, causing problems for the Leicester defence.The equaliser arrived midway through the second half when fellow substitute Joshua Zirkzee tapped in from close range after Rasmus Hojlund's flick from Garnacho's cross was blocked.With the momentum firmly in their favour, United pushed for a winner, and it came deep into stoppage time. Harry Maguire rose highest to head home a Bruno Fernandes free-kick, sparking wild celebrations at Old Trafford.While the goal appeared to be offside, the lack of VAR in the FA Cup meant the decision stood, and United secured a hard-fought victory.The match held added significance for Ruud van Nistelrooy, who had enjoyed a brief spell as United's interim manager earlier in the season following the sacking of Erik ten Hag.During his tenure, United had scored eight goals in two games against Leicester, but this time, the Dutchman was on the receiving end of a United comeback.For United, the win provided a much-needed boost after a recent run of poor form at home, where they had suffered five defeats in their previous seven matches across all competitions.The absence of key players like Lisandro Martinez, who sustained a cruciate ligament injury against Crystal Palace, and the January departures of Marcus Rashford and Antony, had left United light in attacking options.However, the introduction of Garnacho and Zirkzee's impact highlighted the depth in United's squad.As the FA Cup defence continues, United will take confidence from their ability to grind out a result against a determined Leicester side. The comeback victory not only kept their hopes of silverware alive but also provided a timely reminder of the resilience and fighting spirit that has been a hallmark of successful United teams throughout their illustrious history.","Manchester United staged a remarkable comeback to defeat Leicester City 2-1 on Friday night at Old Trafford.

FIFA stated that the suspension would remain in place until the PFF Congress adopts the required amendments.Pakistan football has been under the control of a FIFA-appointed Normalisation Committee since June 2019. The committee was tasked with conducting elections and resolving internal conflicts within the federation, but it has struggled to fulfill its mandate.Despite multiple changes in leadership over the past five years, the fundamental issues within Pakistan's football structure persist. The Normalisation Committee has also been at odds with the state-run Pakistan Sports Board, further delaying the constitutional amendments.Earlier this week, PFF Normalisation Committee chairman Haroon Malik cautioned a parliamentary panel that his tenure would end on February 15 and that Pakistan risked suspension if the amendments were not implemented. He clarified that making these amendments did not mean he would be a candidate in the upcoming PFF elections.Malik also revealed that the PFF Congress was unwilling to comply with FIFA’s directives, resulting in the ongoing standoff.This marks the third time Pakistan's football federation has been suspended since 2017.",FIFA has suspended the Pakistan Football Federation.

MUMBAI: Getting to the semifinals of the L&T Mumbai Open was already a massive success for Maaya Rajeshwaran Revathi , particularly considering the 15-year-old hadn’t originally planned to play the WTA125K event.On Saturday, Jil Teichmann , an opponent currently ranked 117 in the world, and as high as 21 less than three years ago, proved a hurdle too steep for the promising teenager from Coimbatore.The fifth seed from Switzerland needed only 68 minutes to seal her spot in Sunday’s final, winning 6-3,6-1 to end Maaya’s remarkable run at the Cricket Club of India here.Teichmann will battle the eighth seed Mananchaya Sawangkaew for the title, after the 22-year-old Thai stunned second seed Rebecca Marino 6-2, 6-2 in the first semifinal.As much as it’s been a special eight days for Maaya, who was given a wild card to the qualifiers by the tournament officials, it’s also been physically demanding. On Friday, she needed to go to a deciding set for the third time in the week to beat Japan’s Mei Yamaguchi in the quarterfinals. And she would admit to feeling the cumulative toll on her legs, as Teichmann seized control of the match from the start.The 27-year-old Swiss, with two WTA titles to her name, successfully managed to neutralise Maaya from the baseline with her powerful groundstrokes to break the y oung Indian twice for a 4-0 lead. Then, a loose game on serve which came out of nowhere sparked Maaya’s best spell of the match. The home girl was suddenly swinging freely and delighted the near full-house with three roaring winners to hold serve for the first time. She knocked on the door again in the next game, earning two break points, which the experienced Teichmann did well to stave off and extend her lead.Having negotiated the teenager’s best spell, Teichmann was barely troubled from there on.The challenge of taking on a quality lefthander, something Maaya had been wary about following her-quarterfinal win on Friday, had proven to be a daunting experience after all.“It (playing a lefty) was worse than I expected,” Maaya would chuckle later. “Also, I did play a very experienced player and I felt that I didn’t play the way I hoped I would. Also I was physically a bit tired.”There were still “a lot of positives” gained from a week which saw Maaya come into the tournament unranked and finish with 55 ranking points. When the latest WTA rankings come out on Monday, Maaya will be in 645th spot.","Jil Teichmann beats Maaya Rajeshwaran Revathi 6-3,6-1 in the semifinals of the L&T Mumbai Open.

NEW DELHI: Unseeded Canadian player Denis Shapovalov continued his impressive run at the ATP Dallas Open on Saturday. He defeated the defending champion, Tommy Paul , in straight sets, 7-5, 6-3, to secure a spot in the final.Shapovalov's journey has been remarkable, as he previously eliminated world number four Taylor Fritz in the second round.In the other semifinal match, second-seeded Casper Ruud of Norway faced a tough challenge from Spain's Jaume Munar. After splitting the first two sets, the match went into a decisive third-set tiebreaker. Ruud prevailed 7-6 (7/4) after a hard-fought battle that lasted over two and a half hours.Shapovalov's victory over Paul, who is currently ranked ninth in the world, was achieved in just an hour and a half. This marks the second top-10 opponent that Shapovalov has defeated in the tournament. His next challenge will be to face Ruud, the world number five, in the final on Sunday.Ruud acknowledged the difficulty of his match against Munar, stating, ""Second and third set (Munar) really stepped it up."" He also recognized the mental aspect of the game, admitting that he might have benefited from Munar's nerves as the Spaniard served for the match in the third set. ""I know what the feeling is like,"" Ruud said.""You can get tight. You kind of see the finish line a few yards in front of you and then you kind of stumble. I've done it myself and I was fortunate to be on the right side of it today.""In the tiebreaker, Ruud took control by hitting a backhand down-the-line winner to grab a 4-2 lead. He extended his advantage to 5-3 when Munar missed a backhand volley, and then went up 6-3 with an overhead smash.Ultimately, Munar netted a forehand to hand Ruud the victory, leaving their head-to-head record at 4-1 in favour of the Norwegian.For Ruud, this final represents an opportunity to claim his 13th career ATP title and his third consecutive finals win, following triumphs last year inBarcelona and Geneva. He holds a 2-0 head-to-head record against Shapovalov, who will be competing in his eighth ATP final and seeking his third title after victories in Stockholm in 2018 and Belgrade last November.The stage is set for an intriguing final showdown between the unseeded Shapovalov, who has been on a giant-killing run, and the second-seeded Ruud, who has consistently performed at a high level throughout the tournament.","Unseeded Canadian player Denis Shapovalov defeated defending champion Tommy Paul in straight sets, 7-5, 6-3.

NEW DELHI: Spanish world number three Carlos Alcaraz secured his place in the final of the Rotterdam Open on Saturday after a hard-fought and entertaining three-set victory over Hubert Hurkacz .The match showcased Alcaraz's resilience and determination as he overcame stubborn resistance from the Polish player, winning 6-4, 6-7 (5/7), 6-3.The match began with Alcaraz facing an early setback, as he was broken in his opening service game, allowing Hurkacz to take a 3-0 lead in the first set.However, Alcaraz displayed his fighting spirit, saving a break point with a brilliant crosscourt forehand and holding onto his serve.Despite facing three more break points, Alcaraz fought back, breaking Hurkacz's serve and seizing the game with a forehand smash after a lengthy rally.The momentum shifted in Alcaraz's favour, and he capitalized on a double-fault from Hurkacz to serve out the set, sealing it with a forehand drive volley winner.The second set proceeded more conventionally, with both players holding serve until the tie-break. The tie-break was a closely contested affair, with both players squandering chances to gain the advantage.Ultimately, a double-fault from Alcaraz at 5-4 up gave Hurkacz the opportunity he needed, and the Pole seized it, taking the set as Alcaraz netted a simple backhand groundstroke.The decisive third set started similarly to the first, with an early break of serve – this time in Alcaraz's favour. The Spaniard brought the crowd to their feet with his aggressive play, and his lead proved enough to break Hurkacz's resistance. Serving for the set at 5-3, Alcaraz booked his place in his 22nd ATP tour final with a trademark forehand winner up the line.""I want to be the first Spanish player to be able to win this tournament. I'm going to go for it. I'm really happy to be able to play a final in Rotterdam,"" said the 21-year-old Alcaraz, expressing his determination to claim the title.In the other semi-final, Alex de Minaur of Australia brought an end to the extraordinary giant-killing run of Italian qualifier Mattia Bellucci with a straight-sets win, 6-1, 6-2.De Minaur's consistency proved too much for the error-prone Bellucci, who was unable to replicate his earlier heroics against Daniil Medvedev and Stefanos Tsitsipas.""I'm very happy with the level today,"" said De Minaur. ""He's been playing with a lot of confidence this whole week, so I knew it was going to be a very tough battle."" The third-seeded Australian has enjoyed a comfortable passage to the final, winning all his matches in straight sets.With both players displaying impressive form, the stage is set for an enthralling final showdown between Alcaraz and De Minaur. Alcaraz, the top seed, will be aiming to become the first Spanish player to win the Rotterdam Open, while De Minaur, the runner-up last year, will be seeking his first title in the tournament.","Carlos Alcaraz beats Hubert Hurkacz 6-4, 6-7 (5/7), 6-3 in Rotterdam Open semi- final.

Thombare-Hartono back in doubles final

MUMBAI: Maaya Rajeshwaran Revathi came into the L&T Mumbai Open unranked. Check the live WTA rankings now and you will see the promising 15-year-old’s name in 645th spot after she marched into the semifinals of the WTA 125K tournament at the Cricket Club of India here on Friday.Taking on the 285th-ranked Japanese qualifier Mei Yamaguchi in the quarterfinals, Maaya, not for the first time this week, showed why she is regarded as one of India’s bright, young tennis hopes, as she overcame a second-set wobble to win 6-4, 3-6, 6-2 in just under two hours.To put her victory in context, she is the first Indian female to get this far in a WTA tournament at home in singles since Sania Mirza won a Tour event in her home city of Hyderabad in 2005 — over four years before Maaya was born. And to think that she hadn’t actually planned to play in Mumbai to begin with!Having received a wild card to the qualifiers here, Maaya, who recently joined the Rafa Nadal Academy in Mallorca, hasn’t looked back. From earning six ranking points by virtue of winning her two qualifying matches, the Coimbatore teenager has gone on to amass an additional 49 points as a result of her now reaching the semifinals.“It means a lot,” she said, reserving a word of thanks for tournament director Sunder Iyer. “MSLTA and Sunder sir, they gave me this opportunity. I’m really grateful for that, and it all started from there. As I said, wasn’t part of the plan, but they trusted me and gave me an opportunity, and here it is now.”Indeed. Though when she double-faulted to hand Yamaguchi the second set in a game where she was 40-15 up, the outcome of the match was very much in the balance. But Maaya felt she was prepared after coming through both qualifying matches in three sets.“It’s the third third-set victory this week, and all three of them, I took the first and lost the second. So this is not something new for me,” she said, confidently stating that she didn’t feel the need to recalibrate. “The moment I lost the second set, I knew I had to go all out in the third. And whenever I do that, if I get my legs going, I’ll be winning the third set.”While the 25-year-old Japanese began the match stronger of the two, she would suddenly lose rhythm on her serve, allowing Maaya to claw her way back from a 1-3 deficit and clinch the opening set.The second set saw Yamaguchi, playing with a tightly-strapped right thigh, rediscover the sting in her forehand as well as raise her first serve percentage which helped her put pressure on the young Indian. Just as Maaya had done in the opening set, Yamaguchi would break the Indian’s serve for three consecutive games to even the match.But her challenge fizzled in the deciding set, as an exquisite crosscourt backhand winner followed by a crushing forehand return gave Maaya the double break.On Saturday, the fifth seed Jil Teichmann of Switzerland awaits the teenager in the semifinals. Teichmann had extinguished any hope of seeing an all-Indian last four battle when she outclassed Shrivalli Bhamidipaty 6-2, 6-2 earlier in the day.“It’s a very tough match, but it should be the toughest match of the week for me. And she’s a lefty too. I just hope to compete well, no pressure on me,” said Maaya.India’s top-ranked woman doubles player Prarthana Thombare and Dutch partner Arianne Hartono earned themselves another crack at the title here, as they fought back to beat the British-Russian pairing of Eden Silva and Anastasia Tikhonova 2-6, 6-4, 10-2 in the semifinal on Friday. Thombare and Hartono finished runners-up last year, losing to Dalila Jakupovic and Sabrina Santamaria in the final.","Maaya Rajeshwaran Revathi beats Japanese qualifier Mei Yamaguchi 6-4, 3-6, 6-2.

NEW DELHI: Carlos Alcaraz , the Spanish tennis sensation, continued his impressive run at the Rotterdam Open on Friday, securing a spot in the semi-finals with a commanding 6-2, 6-1 victory over his compatriot Pedro Martinez .The world number three, aiming to become the first Spaniard to triumph in Rotterdam, will next face Hubert Hurkacz of Poland in a bid to reach Sunday's final.Alcaraz's performance was nothing short of remarkable, as he maintained a high level of play throughout the match, without any significant dips in form.Despite the challenge of facing a fellow Spaniard, Alcaraz remained focused from the outset, breaking Martinez's serve in the opening game and never looking back.The gulf in class between the two players was evident, with Alcaraz showcasing his superiority through a combination of powerful groundstrokes and precise serving.He wrapped up the first set with an ace and carried the momentum into the second, capitalizing on Martinez's unforced errors to secure another early break.Alcaraz's relentless pursuit of victory was highlighted by a remarkable rally that showcased both players' athleticism and determination.Ultimately, the young Spaniard sealed the match with a whipped crosscourt forehand, his 29th winner, in just over an hour.In the other quarter-final match, Stefanos Tsitsipas , the world number 12, fell victim to an extraordinary run by Italian qualifier Mattia Bellucci , who secured a 6-4, 6-2 upset victory.Bellucci's left-handed serve and combination of flat backhands and heavy topspin forehands, coupled with well-disguised drop shots, proved too much for Tsitsipas to handle.With his sights set on the trophy, Alcaraz remains confident in his ability to continue improving with each match, setting the stage for an enthralling semi-final clash against Hurkacz.","Carlos Alcaraz beat compatriot Pedro Martinez 6-2, 6-1 in Rotterdam Open quarter-final.

NEW DELHI: Italian qualifier Mattia Bellucci continued his impressive run at the Rotterdam Open , defeating Stefanos Tsitsipas 6-4, 6-2 on Friday to secure a spot in the semi-finals.The world number 12 Tsitsipas struggled against Bellucci's diverse playing style, which featured a strong left-handed serve, flat backhands, and powerful top-spin forehands combined with strategic drop shots.""At the beginning of the week, I would have never expected this result,"" said Bellucci, 23, who had never before reached the semi-final of an ATP 500 event.""I was really enjoying myself on court. Today I think I played even better, technically speaking, against a great opponent but I was in a mindset to fight for every point,"" said the Italian.Bellucci, ranked 92nd globally, had previously showcased his abilities by eliminating second seed Daniil Medvedev in the earlier round.The Italian demonstrated strong defensive skills in the first set, catching Tsitsipas off guard with well-executed drop shots.After breaking Tsitsipas at 4-4, Bellucci successfully served out the set, saving a break point before securing it when his opponent hit a backhand long.The sixth-seeded Greek's difficulties persisted in the second set, with Bellucci breaking serve and establishing a 3-1 lead through skillful drop shots.Tsitsipas contributed to his own defeat by double-faulting on break point, giving up a second break of serve.He managed to save a match point at 5-1, similar to his previous match against Tallon Griekspoor, but couldn't complete another comeback.Bellucci closed out the match confidently, serving to love and earning appreciation from the crowd.His semi-final opponent will be Australia's Alex de Minaur, last year's finalist, who defeated German lucky loser Daniel Altmaier 6-1, 6-4.The tournament's other matches feature world number three Carlos Alcaraz facing fellow Spaniard Pedro Martinez, while Russia's Andrey Rublev competes against Poland's Hubert Hurkacz.","Mattia Bellucci defeats Stefanos Tsitsipas 6-4, 6-2 to reach Rotterdam Open semi-finals.

MUMBAI: It didn't seem like Maaya Rajeshwaran Revathi had done much wrong. She had just completed a 6-4, 6-1 over Belarusian Iryna Shymanovich, finishing the match exactly how she had started it, with an ace. It was not just her first round match of the L&T Mumbai Open , this was her WTA main draw debut, and for most part, the 15-year-old looked to have ticked a lot of the right boxes judging by the applause she drew from the Cricket Club of India crowd here on Tuesday.And yet, the promising teenager wasn't totally pleased with her performance while reflecting on it later. “Well, one thing is that I think I played my qualifying rounds better than today. So one thing that I'm happy about is that I managed to win even though I didn't play my best today,” Maaya would say.Winning despite not being at your best! That's a trait that the man whose famous academy Maaya currently trains at often fell back on over the course of his storied career. For now, she is still in the early days of her one-year stint at the Rafa Nadal Academy in Mallorca, and apart from saying “it's going good” and mentioning a “small conversation” she had with Toni, Rafa's uncle and long-time coach, there's not much else Maaya can share just yet.Her racket, however, did the talking against the 225th-ranked Shymanovich, who, Maaya happened to learn would be her opponent “just five minutes” before she was to step on court.As she and Shymanovich were hitting to each other in the warm-up, a livescoring app still showed Yuriko Miyazaki of Great Britain as Maaya's opponent. Miyazaki was forced to withdraw due to illness.Did the late twist throw Maaya off in any way? “Nah, because either way, I didn't know anything about my previous opponent. The same applies to this (player),” the Coimbatore girl grinned.There was notable support for Maaya in the crowd as Grand Slam doubles champion Rohan Bopanna followed the youngster's progress over the first set. “I'm really honoured to have him here because I think he flew down to watch this match and I'm really happy that he was here,” she said.Tuesday's win coupled with her two victories in the qualifiers have earned Maaya 21 WTA ranking points, taking her total points tally to 24 and earning her an entry into the WTA rankings.She will take on Zarina Diyas in the second round, after the Kazakh eliminated defending champion Darja Semenistaja 6-3, 6-3.Meanwhile, Ankita Raina and Shrivalli Bhamidipaty were the other Indian players to advance to the last 16 stage on Tuesday. Raina proved too strong for compatriot Vaishnavi Adkar, coming through 6-2, 6-2, while Bhamidipaty produced a devastating display to take out the 182nd-ranked Elena Pridankina of Russia 6-1, 6-0 in just 64 minutes.","Maaya Rajeshwaran Revathi beat Belarusian Iryna Shymanovich 6-4, 6-1.

This victory marks a significant achievement for the 27-year-old Indian, displaying his ability to recover and dominate after an initial setback.Nagal's next opponent will be determined by the outcome of the match between Tseng Chun-hsin from Chinese Taipei and Bolivia's Hugo Dellien .This triumph comes at a crucial time for Nagal, who recently experienced a decline in his professional standing.Prior to this event, he had fallen out of the ATP top-100 rankings, a position he had maintained for 10 consecutive months since March 2024.This drop was attributed to a series of disappointing performances, with Nagal securing only three main draw victories in 18 tournaments since Wimbledon 2024.Despite this, his earlier entry into the top-100 in February 2024, following a commendable performance at a Grand Slam event, underscores his potential and skill on the international stage.In related developments within Indian tennis, veteran doubles player Rohan Bopanna , aged 44, has also experienced a setback, falling five places to No. 21 in the rankings.This decline followed an early exit from the Australian Open, where he was unable to defend the points from his previous championship win.Bopanna's attempt to retain his standing, alongside new partner Nicolas Barrientos, ended prematurely in the opening round of the competition.Other Indian players, including Sasikumar Mukund, Ramkumar Ramanathan, Karan Singh, and Aryan Shah, maintain their positions within the top-600 in singles rankings.In doubles, alongside Bopanna, players such as Yuki Bhambri, N Sriram Balaji, Rithvik Choudary Bollipalli, and Arjun Kadhe are within the top-100.","Indian tennis player Sumit Nagal secured his place in the pre-quarterfinals following a resilient victory against Argentina's Renzo Olivo.

The player defended his stand in a lengthy post on social media, saying ""it is standard practice in professional sports for athletes to be compensated for their participation in events, even when representing their country"".Amritraj , who worked with Nagal when he held the role of captain a few years ago, described the idea as ""inconceivable"".""To me personally, it is just inconceivable that if you are ranked high enough and the country wants you to play, that you would play without any financial compensation,"" Amritraj told reporters here on the sidelines of the L&T Mumbai Open at the Cricket Club of India on Monday.""Unless you are injured and you can't walk on the court, other than that, there should be no question that you're going to play Davis Cup. Same for me, same for Vijay,"" he added, referring to his brother with whom he helped India reach the 1974 Davis Cup finals against South Africa.""Both of us felt that it is the greatest honour that you can have to play for your country. Maybe this is old-school thinking, but that is absolutely how it should be.""You got 50 weeks in the year to make money, two weeks of the year, you should be able to give to places you grew up in, and it should be an honour and a privilege.""On Nagal's case, the 73-yearold said: ""I like Sumit, when I was captain he was the reserve on my team five years ago. I got along very well with him, but he didn't play the last tie (vs Sweden in Sept) either, which is really a shame because he is our best player right now.""Asked if there should be strong repercussions for players who choose to not turn up for national team duties, Amritraj said it was a tricky situation as players could always lean on the ""independence of the ATP Tour "" to make their decisions.With some Indian players, however, enjoying government funding through programmes like the Target Olympic Podium Scheme (TOPS), it could be a way for Aita to crack the whip, Amritraj felt.""That's where you should put the screws on them. I think you should definitely do that. If you're in any kind of place with some leverage, you should say: 'Either you play Davis Cup, or you won't get this'. Simple.""","Top-ranked players Sumit Nagal and Yuki Bhambri turned down chance to represent India.

CHENNAI: Indian tennis is not going through the best of times. While its top-ranked singles player Sumit Nagal has made good strides in recent years, the rest of the crop has struggled in the journey to the top.The player distribution in the Chennai Open Challenger best explains the current scenario. Even in a home tournament, India, in the absence of Nagal, is forced to rely on wildcards for main-draw singles entries as the next-best players from the country find it difficult to directly make the cut. Davis Cuppers Mukund Sasikumar (ranked 365), Ramkumar Ramanathan (406) and Karan Singh will have a point to prove after being awarded wildcards by the organisers.The onus will be on the experienced Ramkumar and Mukund to gain valuable points to move up in the rankings chart. The 28-year-old Mukund had a good run in Chennai last year, reaching the quarterfinals, but could not carry forward the momentum in the tournaments that followed. Ramkumar’s story in the past few years has not been much different, with the 30-year-old’s inconsistency hampering his chances to move to a higher level. Youngster Karan has shown promise in the early stages of his career and is steadily rising up the ladder.Moving to foreign interest, quite a few players are looking to resurrect their careers and compete in the Grand Slams. For instance, Lloyd Harris, who is the second seed in singles, was once ranked as high as 31 and reached the quarterfinals of the US Open in 2021. Injury issues forced the South African to stay away from action for quite a long period and the 27-year-old will compete in his first match since the Wimbledon last year.Former world No. 35 Jiri Vesely had to sit out in 2023 due to injury concerns. The 31-year-old had won the ATP 250 title in Pune in 2020 and had a good time in India in the past. Ahead of the Chennai Open, Vesely said: “Preparations have been good and I am getting used to the weather, but it is not easy. It is always nice to be in India and people are very friendly and supportive. I love coming back here and I hope to have a good run on this trip.”Vesely dropped outside the top-600 a few years ago and since then, he has found it tough to be back to his best. “I wish to move up and it is not easy. A lot of youngsters are playing well and I need to compete with them and give my best.”","India's top-ranked singles player Sumit Nagal has made good strides in recent years. The rest of the crop has struggled in the journey to the top.

Jacopo Berrettini looks up to brother Matteo to climb the ladder,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/jacopo-berrettini-looks-up-to-brother-matteo-to-climb-the-ladder/articleshow/117890986.cms,"Jacopo Berrettini

CHENNAI: Italian tennis player Jacopo Berrettini does not have to look far for inspiration. The 26-year-old shares a strong bond with his elder brother Matteo Berrettini , a former top-10 singles player and 2021 Wimbledon finalist, whom he regards not only his best friend but also his idol.“I have a good relationship with him. He is a very good human, and I am so glad and lucky to have him. Apart from on-court training, he mentors me off the field and is a good coach. We shared the same (coaching) team for the past three years and now share the same trainer. Before coming here, we trained together for three days in Rome,” Jacopo, who will begin his season at the Chennai Open Challenger , told TOI on Saturday.Jacopo and Matteo had a tough 2023 as their seasons were marred by injuries. Matteo had to take a six-month break, while Jacopo had to miss the majority of the year. In that period, the Berrettini brothers helped each other stay mentally strong. “It was a very tough period for us, for our family. We were trying to be the humans that we are, trying to stay mentally focused and healthy. We had to work a lot after recovery because this sport is so tough mentally and physically. We were trying to enjoy life outside the sport as it is very important as well. After suffering from a lot of injuries, Matteo had a good season last year,” Jacopo added.While Jacopo and Matteo do not spend much time together due to their playing commitments, they are always in touch. “We try to talk often and as much as we can. Sometimes, we train together, but if we are not able to spend a lot of time, it is okay since we travel and play regularly. We are healthy and that is a good thing for us.”‘Aim to carry forward momentum’: Jacopo had a productive season last year and achieved his career-best singles ranking of 317. The Italian will look to carry forward the momentum, starting with his season opener in Chennai. “It was a good year (2024) for me, playing many matches without any injury concerns. I worked on many aspects and will try to keep going. My goal for this year is to compete in the qualifiers of the Grand Slams, for which I have to get close to the 230 mark (rankings).”",Italian tennis player Jacopo Berrettini shares a strong bond with his elder brother Matteo.

NEW DELHI: Two-time Olympic medallist and one of India’s most celebrated badminton players, PV Sindhu has embarked on a new chapter in her career by teaming up with renowned Indonesian coach Irwansyah Adi Pratama .This partnership comes at a crucial time as Sindhu aims to regain her competitive edge and reclaim her status among the elite in women’s badminton.Previously, Sindhu has been coached by Pullela Gopichand , South Koreans Kim Ji-Hyun and Park Tae Sang, and Malaysia’s Muhammad Hafiz Hashim. Irwansyah, known for his success with Indonesian stars Jonatan Christie and Anthony Ginting, has been tasked with revitalizing Sindhu’s game.It has been a tough two years for Sindhu. After winning the 2022 Commonwealth Games title, she experienced a lull and didn’t win any tournament till her Syed Modi Super 300 crown in December last year.“Every player has been through something like this. What I’ve learned, I want to pass on to her. I’ll try my best. I believe she can still do it. She can come back and reach an even higher level than before. I do believe in it. That’s the reason I’m here,” Irwansyah said.“I want to help her enjoy herself more on the court. It’s important that she enjoys it because when she enjoys it, she’ll become more confident. That’s the main focus right now – working hard to get her to believe in herself again. After everything, the last two years have been tough -- injuries, maybe... It’s really about confidence. I’m doing my best to help her believe in what she has. She has a lot of potential,” the coach added.Irwansyah’s approach focuses on enhancing Sindhu’s natural aggressive playing style. “My plan is to make her a more attacking player. She has all the right qualities, so I just want to build on that and push her further. I want to change her game to be more aggressive -- more speed and power,” Irwansyah said.As Sindhu begins this new journey, she expresses a renewed sense of purpose and determination. “The bonding is important between coach and athlete. I’ve heard a lot about him, and I thought he is the right coach for me. The way he approaches opponents, I think it’s really good,” Sindhu said.At the India Open , Sindhu lost in the quarterfinals to Indonesia’s Gregoria Mariska Tungjung. Despite the loss, Sindhu gave a good account of herself, giving glimpses of her old self.“I need to maintain my speed. I need to have my power. The women’s singles game is evolving, and after playing for so many years, I think opponents definitely know my game by now. So, it’s crucial to strategize, having both Plan A and Plan B,” said Sindhu. “I still feel there’s so much more to achieve. I have that fire in me, and I know I can do it. It’s just a matter of time and rhythm.”","Two-time Olympic medallist PV Sindhu has teamed up with renowned Indonesian coach Irwansyah Adi Pratama.

Shah Rukh Khan: The superstar who turned IPL into a blockbuster

Delhi Capitals (DC) left-arm wrist spinner Kuldeep Yadav was seen playfully slapping Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) Rinku Singh after their Indian Premier League (IPL) match at the Arun Jaitley Stadium on Wednesday.The incident occurred after the match, during the customary interaction between players from both teams. Given that both Kuldeep and Rinku represent Uttar Pradesh, the slaps appeared to be friendly jabs exchanged in a light-hearted manner.In the match KKR defeated Delhi Capitals by 14 runs to keep their IPL play-off hopes alive.With this win, defending champions KKR reignited their playoff hopes, though they remained at the seventh spot with nine points. DC stayed in the top four with 12 points.Invited to bat, a collective batting effort helped KKR post 204 for 9.Their bowlers, led by Sunil Narine (3/29), then restricted the Capitals to 190/9 despite contributions by Faf du Plessis (62), Axar Patel (43) and Vipraj Nigam (38).Earlier, Young Angkrish Raghuvanshi (44) steadied the innings along with Rinku Singh (36), the duo adding 61 runs off 46 balls. Raghuvanshi struck two big sixes off Vipraj, while Rinku targeted Kuldeep Yadav, smashing two boundaries and a six in a 17-run over that helped KKR cross the 150-run mark.However, KKR lost the momentum again as both Raghuvanshi and Rinku departed in quick succession, falling to Chameera and Vipraj respectively, just when they looked set to accelerate.Andre Russell smashed two fours and a six to push KKR past the 200-mark, but the visitors lost three wickets in as many balls in the final over, with Starc picking up two in dramatic fashion.Mitchell Starc (3/43) picked up three wickets for the hosts, while spinners Axar 2/27 and Nigam (2/41) chipped in with two wickets apiece.",Kuldeep Yadav and Rinku Singh involved in light-hearted banter after DC vs KKR match.

A Father's Pride: How RR, Dravid & Vikram Shaped Vaibhav Suryavanshi

Everything is special about Vaibhav Suryavanshi: Vikram Rathour

A few years ago, the Bihar Cricket Association (BCA) faced an unusual predicament. A 12-year-old boy from Samastipur was emerging as a prodigious talent, but he couldn’t be played in the Bihar U-16 team due to BCCI rules introduced during the Covid era, which required players to be 14 years or older to qualify for the U-16 level.“I saw him for the first time when he was just 11 or 12 at the Gen Next Academy in Patna, where he was training under Manish Ojha , a former Bihar player. Due to the rules, we couldn’t pick him. Interestingly, those rules didn’t restrict him from playing for the U-19s. We approached BCA president Rakesh Tiwary and he told us, ‘If you’re convinced about his talent and future, go ahead and pick him, but just take care of him,’” said Ashok Kumar, head coach of Bihar’s senior team and former coach of the U-19 and U-23 sides.That boy was Vaibhav Suryavanshi , who, at the age of just 14, became the youngest-ever T20 centurion after smashing a 35-ball hundred against Gujarat Titans.“I told Vishnu Vardhan, the match referee at the Vinoo Mankad Trophy (U-19 One-dayers) in Chandigarh, that we had a talented 12-year-old called Vaibhav. Before our first match, against Assam, Vaibhav insisted on playing in the XI. I wanted him to debut against Manipur instead, but he said, ‘I’ll win you the match, sir.’ And he did, scoring 89. That attitude and intent stood out to me. He was different,” Ashok recalled.“Vishnu sent a recording of that innings to India U-19 chief selector S Sharath, who then sent a selector to watch Vaibhav play. Initially, the selector couldn’t believe he was from Bihar! He thought we’d recruited him from Delhi. Vaibhav scored 148 in that match against Haryana, though we fell short chasing 270. He was upset at the loss, but his journey had begun.“Vaibhav was then picked for the BCCI’s U-19 Challenger Trophy, then the U-19 Quadrangular, though he didn’t get a game and was disappointed. But eventually, he got his chance in the ‘test’ matches against Australia (Sept 2024). I told him, ‘Whether it’s one-day or test, don’t change your aggressive approach. That’s your biggest strength. If you stop attacking, your game will collapse.’ On his U-19 Test debut, he scored a 58-ball ton, the fastest by an Indian U-19 player,” said Ashok.At the 2024 ACC U-19 Asia Cup, Suryavanshi scored 76 off 46 balls against the UAE and followed it up with 67 off 36 balls against Sri Lanka in the semifinal. His childhood coach, Manish Ojha, told TOI from Patna, “He was eight when I started coaching him. He’s a god-gifted, natural talent. He loves playing his strokes. I helped him channel that into becoming an attacking batsman. His six-hitting ability is incredible. If he continues like this, I see him playing for India in two years.”Seeing his high backlift, it’s not hard to identify his cricketing idol. “Vaibhav idolises Brian Lara . He attacks like Lara did — regardless of the bowler’s reputation — and his high backlift mirrors Lara’s. All 16 IPL sixes have come against international bowlers,” Jha noted.Incidentally, Vaibhav made his Ranji Trophy debut when he was 12 years old.","Vaibhav Suryavanshi is the youngest-ever T20 centurion for Rajasthan Royals. At the age of just 14, he became the youngest ever T20 century for Gujarat Titans. He is set to play for India in two Test matches against Australia in 2024.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120749048,imgsize-145502,width-400,resizemode-4/Jaipur-Rajasthan-Royals-Vaibhav-Suryavanshi-reacts-after-his-dismissal-during-.jpg"

A Father's Pride: How RR, Dravid & Vikram Shaped Vaibhav Suryavanshi

Among the fast-growing list of Vaibhav Suryavanshi admirers are former Australia players Michael Hussey and James Hopes, currently on coaching duties in the IPL. Chennai Super Kings batting coach Hussey reserved high praise for Vaibhav, saying that the 14-year-old pocket dynamite brought back memories of legendary Adam Gilchrist ’s thrill-a-minute performances. “It was incredible, was it not? There are some of these players who come along and when they are batting in the middle, you do not want to miss a ball,” said Hussey on Tuesday.“When Gilchrist walked out to bat, the whole Australian team would come to the viewing area to watch the game, because such players are just so exciting. I felt the same watching this young kid. Seeing him score a century off 30-odd balls was amazing to watch,” added Hussey.Hussey is “blown away” by Vaibhav’s enviable ability to go after the bowlers without dwelling on their reputation. On Monday, the youngster took the India internationals, including veteran Ishant Sharma, to the cleaners during his jaw-dropping knock.“Him and Yashasvi Jaiswal batting together was breathtaking. It is reckless at times, but it is so exciting to watch. To be able to play like that, against some of the best bowlers, it just blows your mind,” said Hussey, warning that Vaibhav should be surrounded by the right people to move in the right direction. “His life and world have changed forever now. He is going to be on such a high probably for weeks or months. He will need good people around him to guide him. He is very lucky to have Rahul Dravid (RR head coach) and some good senior players.”Punjab fast-bowling coach Hopes hailed the fearlessness of ‘Gen Z’ batters. “It was hard to take my eyes off it. These kids in general play a different game. They come up against the Kohlis and Dhonis of the world but they do not have any fear. Indian cricket is well placed, especially in the white-ball formats,” said Hopes, adding, “We do have such talent in Australia, but they do not get exposed at a young age like they do here. We do not have as many teams. We have only six domestic teams.”",Rajasthan Royals' Vaibhav Suryavanshi scored a century against Gujarat Titans.

The first delivery set the tone: Russell launched it down the ground for a monstrous 106-metre six, bringing the crowd to its feet and KKR past the 200-run mark.Starc followed up with a high short ball that was called a wide. DC reviewed it but lost it. The next delivery yielded a leg-bye, bringing Rovman Powell on strike, who was trapped LBW.

Fewest innings taken by an Indian player to score an IPL ton

On Sunday, Vaibhav Suryavanshi became the youngest centurion in men's T20 cricket and smashed the second fastest ton in the history of the Indian Premier League (IPL).The 14-year-old raced away to a century off just 35 balls in just his third IPL 2025 match. His knock was studded with 11 sixes and seven fours and Rajasthan Royals chased down a 209-run target in 15.5 overs.“It is a very good feeling. It’s my first hundred in the IPL and it’s my third innings. The result has shown here after the practice before the tournament,” the player of the match, Suryavanshi, said.“I just see the ball and play. It has been a dream to get a 100 in the IPL, and today, it materialised. There is no fear. I don’t think much, I just focus on playing.”Vaibhav Suryavanshi’s century was also the quickest by an Indian in the IPL, bettering Yusuf Pathan’s 37-ball effort for Rajasthan against the Mumbai Indians in 2010.Chris Gayle holds the record for the fastest century in IPL history.Chris Gayle (Royal Challengers Bengaluru) - 30 balls175* vs Pune Warriors India, Bengaluru, 2013Vaibhav Suryavanshi (Rajasthan Royals) - 35 balls101 vs Gujarat Titans, Jaipur, 2025Yusuf Pathan (Rajasthan Royals) - 37 balls100 vs Mumbai Indians , Brabourne, 2010David Miller (Punjab Kings) - 38 balls101* vs Royal Challengers Bengaluru, Mohali, 2013Travis Head (Sunrisers Hyderabad) - 39 balls102 vs Royal Challengers Bengaluru, Bengaluru, 20243 - Vaibhav Suryavanshi (RR)*4 - Priyansh Arya (PBKS)4 - Paul Valthaty (KXIP)4 - Manish Pandey (RCB)10 - Rajat Patidar (RCB)",Rajasthan Royals' Vaibhav Suryavanshi becomes the youngest centurion in men's T20 cricket.

Shah Rukh Khan: The superstar who turned IPL into a blockbuster

Ye bola tha maarunga. But pata nahi tha aise maarega

[Has it ever happened that you hit a six on the very first ball?] - this was the innocent, yet striking, question young Vaibhav Suryavanshi posed to a teammate just days before making his IPL debut . Who would have thought that a youngster would probe such a question. Maybe it was an insight into the mind of the 14-year-old?The match was against the Lucknow Super Giants. One of India's finest bowlers, Avesh Khan, had the ball in hand. Yashasvi Jaiswal took the strike, nudged a single, and handed over the stage to Suryavanshi. What followed was straight out of a dream — the 14-year-old launched the very first ball of his IPL career for a six, announcing his arrival with a bang.Did he manifest it? Maybe. Was it a fluke? Possibly. But let’s move to another telling moment.It’s 10 am on Monday, April 28th. Suryavanshi wakes up and makes his first call — to his childhood coach Manish Ojha. After a few exchanges about footwork and technique, Suryavanshi confidently tells him, """" (Sir, today I will smash the bowlers).[Hit (the ball), but don’t lose your wicket. Play calmly, keep talking to Yashasvi],"" the coach said.In the evening, Suryavanshi padded up, left the dugout, exchanged a fist bump with Yashasvi — and the rest, as they say, is history.The young boy’s manifestation once again came true.The 14-year-old prodigy from Samastipur, Bihar, blazed his way to a sensational 38-ball 101, becoming the youngest centurion in IPL history at just 14 years and 32 days.In a breathtaking assault at a packed Sawai Mansingh Stadium in Jaipur, Suryavanshi hammered 11 sixes and 7 fours, dismantling an attack featuring international stars like Ishant Sharma, Mohammed Siraj, Prasidh Krishna, Washington Sundar, Rashid Khan and Karim Janat.While the crowd grew hoarse from endless cheering, Suryavanshi showed no signs of slowing down, making a mockery of some of the world’s best bowlers.The left-hander brought up his century off just 35 balls against Gujarat Titans , prompting a heartwarming moment — an injured Rahul Dravid , India’s ex-coach, rose from his wheelchair, fists pumping in celebration. Dravid cheered with uncontained joy, savouring the historic moment crafted by the young opener.[He had said he would hit it. But I didn’t know he would hit it like that]. I had an instinct that something big was going to happen, but honestly, I didn’t expect it to be this big. He is a God-gifted cricketer. He’s just a kid — only 14 years old. God has blessed him with immense talent. I am really thankful to God that I could play some part in his career,"" coach Ojha said.""He always says that Rajasthan Royals have given him a huge platform, and he is determined to work hard, play well, and give his best. His ultimate dream is to play for India. He is just 14. The great Sachin Tendulkar made his ODI debut at 16, and I am sure Vaibhav is on the right path. With a legend like Rahul Dravid guiding him, he doesn’t have to worry about anything,"" the coach said.","The 14-year-old prodigy from Samastipur, Bihar, blazed his way to a sensational 38-ball 101, becoming the youngest centurion in IPL history at just 14 years and 32 days.

NEW DELHI: There has been a lot of chatter among cricket fans regarding Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) owner Sanjiv Goenka 's strict approach. Many believe Goenka demands strong results from his team. The discussions intensified recently after Goenka’s interactions with Rishabh Pant following LSG’s defeats sparked fresh speculation.The conversation around Goenka’s involvement began last year when he was seen having a heated discussion with then-captain KL Rahul after LSG’s heavy loss to SunRisers Hyderabad. Eventually, KL Rahul moved on from LSG and joined Delhi Capitals for the IPL 2025 season.However, former LSG spinner Amit Mishra offered clarification, describing Goenka as a friendly and approachable figure who simply wants the best for his team.""I spoke to the coach last season, and he told me that captain KL Rahul was doing all the work. He was making the 11s, making all the changes, and planning. But this year, I don't feel like that. This year, after Zaheer Khan has come, I feel like he is talking to everyone. If you see, there is a discussion going on, they are talking to each other. With Digvesh Rathi the coach was talking,"" Mishra said on Cricbuzz.""If you talk about the owner, I never felt he was too involved. Of course, he wanted the team to win. But we did lose matches and after that he never talked loudly or said anything wrong. I feel that the media has shown a little too much. I didn't feel that there was anything negative like that. But if there is any owner, he says that losing is okay, but just go out there and show some fight.""Fight and lose, I have no problem. This is what people told me. This is what happened. Even after losing badly in Kolkata and Hyderabad, the owner came into the dressing room and motivated the team. He never said anything wrong or in a very high tone,"" he further added.As things stand, LSG are sixth on the points table with 5 wins and 5 losses from 10 matches.",There has been a lot of chatter among cricket fans regarding Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) owner Sanjiv Goenka's strict approach.

Axar Patel-led Delhi Capitals (DC) will be aiming for an improved batting effort in the middle overs when they face Ajinkya Rahane's Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) in their Indian Premier League (IPL) match at the Arun Jaitley Stadium on Tuesday.Delhi Capitals have struggled with their top-order performance and batting against spinners at their home ground. Despite Abishek Porel showing good timing in the previous match, he couldn't convert it into a substantial score, while Faf du Plessis's return from injury was rusty and Karun Nair failed to make an impact.KKR, meanwhile, have managed just seven points so far and are placed seventh in the standings, having failed to collect any points from their last three matches, including two losses and a no-result.Rahane will be desperate to arrest the slide and keep their playoff hopes alive, with another defeat making the task tougher. Their batting lacks a settled look, with Quinton de Kock and Rahmanullah Gurbaz being rotated in the opening slot alongside Narine, while the side has relied heavily on Rahane and youngster Angkrish Raghuvanshi to score runs. Bowling has been another area of concern, with KKR failing to break opening stands, allowing teams to post big totals - as seen in the last game where PBKS added 120 for the opening wicket.The pitch which was used for RCB's match was two-paced. It will be interesting to see what will be in store for this fixture. In the last few matches, the pitches at Kotla has been a bit tricky, completely different from what it was in the last season.Abhishek Porel, Faf du Plessis, Karun Nair, KL Rahul (wk), Axar Patel (c), Triston Stubbs, Ashutosh Sharma, Vipraj Nigam, Mitchell Starc, Kuldeep Yadav, Mohit SharmaMukesh KumarRahamanullah Gurbaz (wk), Sunil Narine, Venkatesh Iyer, Ajinkya Rahane (c), Rinku Singh, Andre Russell, Rovman Powell, Vaibhav Arora, Harshit Rana, Varun ChakravarthyAngkrish RaghuvanshiExpect a hot and dry evening in Delhi for the DC vs KKR match, with no significant threat of rain.

A Father's Pride: How RR, Dravid & Vikram Shaped Vaibhav Suryavanshi

‘We knew we’d found something special’

At first glance, Vaibhav Suryavanshi seems like just another teenager, brimming with carefree energy. His teammates can’t resist tugging at his cheeks. After the 38-ball 101 on Monday night, however, they will no doubt take him more seriously.“It feels really good. It was my first century in the IPL , in my third innings. It’s like a dream. What I’ve been practicing for the last three-four months, the result is showing. I don’t see the ground so much, just focus on the ball. I have no fear. I’m not thinking about all that, I’m just focusing on playing,” the left-handed batter said after the game.Now that the spotlight is on him, fans want to know what the 14-year-old is like when he steps off the grass. Royals batting coach Vikram Rathour said, “He is exactly the same. I don’t think he’s intimidated by anybody. He’s one guy who takes on Jofra (Archer) in the nets. He’s a special talent. He’s got a great downswing. So that helps him, I think, generate this kind of power. And today he showed everybody how good he is.”Dominating one of the best IPL bowling attacks is no mean feat, which likely explains why Rathour struggled to avoid calling Vaibhav ‘special’ in every sentence.“For a 14-year-old kid to play like this definitely makes him special. We saw him for the first time maybe four months back when looking for the trials, and from we knew we had found something special. It was up to us to nurture him and bring him to this level,” Rathour said about the ‘ Boss Baby ’, a name Michael Clark came up with when Vaibhav smoked a six off the first ball he faced in the IPL. “He has a solid head on his shoulders. He showed great temperament. He was extraordinary,” Rathour said.",Rajasthan Royals' Vaibhav Suryavanshi scored 38-ball 101 against Gujarat Titans.

Gully To Glory: Ramandeep Singh's journey from Chandigarh to Team India via KKR

Delhi Capitals ’ chase of a formidable 205-run target was marked by early setbacks, a fighting half-century from Faf du Plessis and a dramatic collapse triggered by Sunil Narine ’s incisive spin bowling, leading to a comprehensive 14-run victory for Kolkata Knight Riders at the Arun Jaitley Stadium on Tuesday.KKR earlier did well to get to 204/9, an innings marked by a blistering Powerplay, a faltering middle period and a late fightback.During DC’s chase, left-arm spinner Anukul Roy, trusted with the new ball by KKR skipper Ajinkya Rahane, struck early to dismiss opener Abishek Porel, putting the team on the back foot almost immediately. Next in, Karun Nair couldn’t step on the gas and was trapped in front by pacer Vaibhav Arora for 15. The early losses meant the Capitals could not fully capitalize on the Powerplay.KL Rahul, who has been a key figure for Delhi this season, was run out after a sharp piece of fielding, again from Narine, further denting DC’s hopes.Despite the early setbacks, Faf du Plessis (62 off 45b; 7x4, 2x6) held the innings together. He played a counterattacking knock and provided the Capitals with a glimmer of hope. His aggressive intent, combined with occasional boundaries, kept the required run rate within reach for a while. Du Plessis found an able ally in Axar Patel (43 off 23b; 4x4, 3x6) and the duo added 76 runs for the fourth wicket.The turning point of the innings came in the 14th over, when Sunil Narine struck twice in quick succession. He first removed Axar, caught at extra-cover by Harshit Rana, and then castled Tristan Stubbs in the same over, breaking the back of Delhi’s chase. At the end of the 14th over, Delhi were 138/5, still needing 67 from six overs.Narine then got the set batsman Du Plessis, caught at deep mid-wicket by Rinku Singh, in his next over. The wicket snuffed out any remaining hopes the home team may have had. The DC lower order tried their best to keep the chase alive but wickets kept falling at regular intervals.Earlier, KKR openers Rahmanullah Gurbaz and Sunil Narine started on an aggressive note. The pair capitalized on a true surface and short boundaries, racing to 33 runs in the first two overs, including a 25-run over off Dushmantha Chameera , where Narine and Gurbaz both found the fence and cleared it with ease.Gurbaz continued his assault and dispatched two boundaries and a six in the third over off Mitchell Starc, helping KKR reach 48/0 in 2.5 overs.By the end of the Powerplay, KKR had amassed 79/1, losing only Gurbaz (26 off 12b; 5x4, 1x6), who was dismissed by Starc after a brisk cameo.The introduction of spin brought a shift in momentum. First, leg-spinner Vipraj Nigam trapped Narine (27 off 16b; 2x4, 2x6) leg-before, breaking a threatening stand between him and Rahane. In the next over, Axar Patel had Rahane (26 off 14b; 4x4, 1x6) LBW.","Kolkata Knight Riders beat Delhi Capitals by 14 runs in Indian Premier League. KKR reached 204-9 from their 20 overs, chasing a formidable 205-run target. Faf du Plessis (62) and Axar Patel (43) put on 76 runs for the fourth wicket.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120748652,imgsize-237692,width-400,resizemode-4/New-Delhi-Kolkata-Knight-Riders-bowler-Vaibhav-Arora-celebrates-with-teammates-.jpg"

With their playoff hopes hanging by a thread, Chennai Super Kings will look to salvage pride and momentum when they face Punjab Kings in a crucial IPL clash at Chepauk on Wednesday.The five-time champions have endured a forgettable season, managing just two wins in nine games to sit at the bottom of the table. Punjab Kings, though inconsistent, are better placed at fifth with five victories and will be keen to exploit CSK’s vulnerabilities to climb further.Chepauk, once a fortress, has failed to inspire CSK this season. Even the return of MS Dhoni as captain, following Ruturaj Gaikwad’s elbow injury, hasn’t sparked a turnaround. Dhoni admitted the team’s struggles with combinations and poor powerplay performances.Youngster Ayush Mhatre, who impressed on debut, will be in focus against Arshdeep Singh’s new-ball burst. A key contest could unfold between Shivam Dube and in-form Yuzvendra Chahal in the middle overs.PBKS openers Priyansh Arya and Prabhsimran Singh have been solid, while CSK will bank on Noor Ahmad and Khaleel Ahmed to contain them. CSK’s core — Ravindra Jadeja, Ashwin, and Pathirana — has underperformed, and the top order remains unsettled.With Marco Jansen, Chahal, and Arshdeep firing, PBKS will start favourites against a demoralised CSK unit.The playing surface in Chennai presents a mixed challenge for batters and bowlers alike. The dimensions are slightly asymmetrical — 68 metres and 65 metres square of the wicket, with 80 metres down the ground. The pitch is quite dry and expected to play slightly on the slower side. It may be a touch two-paced, offering some assistance to bowlers who vary their pace smartly. Spinners will also find some grip as the match progresses.Shaik Rasheed, Ayush Mhatre, Dewald Brevis, Shivam Dube, Deepak Hooda, Sam Curran, Ravindra Jadeja, MS Dhoni (w/c), Noor Ahmad, Khaleel Ahmed, Matheesha PathiranaImpact Player – Anshul Kamboj/Ravichandran AshwinPriyansh Arya, Prabhsimran Singh, Shreyas Iyer (c), Josh Inglis (w), Nehal Wadhera, Shashank Singh, Glenn Maxwell, Azmatullah Omarzai, Marco Jansen, Arshdeep Singh, Yuzvendra ChahalImpact Player - Harpreet Brar/Musheer KhanMS Dhoni (c&wk), Dewald Brevis, Devon Conway, Rahul Tripathi, Shaik Rasheed, Vansh Bedi, Andre Siddharth, Ayush Mhatre, Rachin Ravindra, Ravichandran Ashwin, VIjay Shankar, Sam Curran, Anshul Kamboj, Deepak Hooda, Jamie Overton, Kamlesh Nagarkoti, Ramakrishna Ghosh, Ravindra Jadeja, Shivam Dube, Khaleel Ahmed, Noor Ahmad, Mukesh Choudhary, Nathan Ellis, Shreyas Gopal, Matheesha Pathirana.Shreyas Iyer (c), Yuzvendra Chahal, Arshdeep Singh, Marcus Stoinis, Nehal Wadhera, Glenn Maxwell, Vyshak Vijaykumar, Yash Thakur, Harpreet Brar, Vishnu Vinod, Marco Jansen, Lockie Ferguson, Josh Inglis, Xavier Bartlett, Kuldeep Sen, Pyla Avinash, Suryansh Shedge, Musheer Khan, Harnoor Pannu, Aaron Hardie, Priyansh Arya, Azmatullah Omarzai.Played: 32CSK wins: 17PBKS wins: 15Expect extremely warm conditions at the MA Chidambaram Stadium on Wednesday, with daytime temperatures peaking at 36°C and a real feel of up to 43°C.

Starc subsequently dismissed Gurbaz for 26.Nigam and Axar struck back for Delhi, removing Narine and Ajinkya Rahane respectively. Young Angkrish Raghuvanshi (44) demonstrated resilience and established a 61-run partnership with Rinku Singh Chameera prevented Raghuvanshi from reaching fifty, while Nigam ended Rinku's innings at 36. Russell, celebrating his 37th birthday, helped the team surpass 200 with a six off Starc, who responded by taking two wickets in consecutive deliveries in the final over.Starc trapped Rovman Powell lbw and bowled Anukul Roy for nought, with Chameera completing a spectacular diving catch in the deep.",Kolkata Knight Riders beat Delhi Capitals by 14 runs at Arun Jaitley Stadium.

NEW DELHI: In a thrilling clash between Delhi Capitals (DC) and Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) on Tuesday, Sri Lankan pacer Dushmantha Chameera stole the spotlight with an unbelievable catch that might just go down as the best of the IPL 2025 season.The moment came in the last over of the KKR innings, and it left everyone stunned, including his own teammates.It was the 19.4 over of KKR's innings when Mitchell Starc bowled a full delivery on the pads to Anukul Roy The batter whipped it cleanly toward the boundary at backward square leg.

NEW DELHI: Barcelona sensation Lamine Yamal has distanced himself from any comparisons to Lionel Messi as he prepares for the Champions League semi-final against Inter Milan on Wednesday.The 17-year-old has established himself as a crucial player on the right wing, the position previously held by Barcelona's record goalscorer Messi, with both being products of the La Masia academy .The last time Barcelona reached the Champions League final was in 2015 with Messi occupying the right-wing position, and now Yamal aims to guide the Catalans back to the prestigious final.""I don't compare myself to him, because I don't compare myself to anyone -- and much less with Messi,"" Yamal told reporters Tuesday.""We are thinking about improving ourselves, every day, and on being better on the next day.""So I don't think the comparison makes sense, with Messi even less -- I'm going to enjoy myself, and be myself.""The young talent expressed his belief that the Argentine footballer stands as the greatest in history.""I admire him obviously, as the best player in history, but I don't compare myself to him,"" he reiterated.A milestone awaits Yamal as he is expected to make his 100th appearance for Barcelona when they face Inter Milan on Wednesday at the Olympic Stadium.Yamal's recent contribution included two assists in Barcelona's Copa del Rey final victory against Real Madrid on Saturday, keeping their hopes alive for a potential quadruple this season.""I'm really excited, it's my first (European) semi-final, and for many others in the team too,"" added Yamal, expressing his confidence before the match.""I've not had any fear, but I have motivation ahead of the game -- I think the butterflies in your stomach are good, all of us players have them.""But fear...

Poll Do you think Liverpool can maintain their dominance in the league next season? It's too early to tell No, other teams will catch up Yes, they will continue to dominate

Liverpool secured their 20th English top-flight title with a stunning 5-1 victory over Tottenham Hotspur at an electrified Anfield on Sunday, sealing a record-equalling crown in emphatic style. The Reds, under manager Arne Slot, left no doubt as they turned an early deficit into a comprehensive win that saw them extend their lead to 15 points over second-placed Arsenal, making their title mathematically unassailable with just four games remaining.The match began with an air of anticipation, as Liverpool fans serenaded their team with the iconic ""You'll Never Walk Alone,"" and their team responded with attacking intent. However, Tottenham briefly threatened to spoil the party when Dominic Solanke powered home a header from a James Maddison corner in the 12th minute. The goal, which initially appeared to be offside, was awarded after VAR's intervention.The setback only seemed to galvanize Liverpool, who quickly leveled through Luis Diaz. The Colombian forward slotted home from close range following a fine cross from Dominik Szoboszlai. The home side then took the lead just minutes later, as Alexis Mac Allister rifled a thunderous shot past Spurs goalkeeper Guglielmo Vicario in the 24th minute.Liverpool were rampant, and after Tottenham's inability to clear their lines, Cody Gakpo seized the opportunity to make it 3-1, firing a low shot into the corner. Spurs, fielding a weakened side due to manager Ange Postecoglou's focus on the Europa League semi-finals, were now on the back foot.As the second half progressed, the Liverpool faithful were craving a goal from their star man, Mohamed Salah. Their wish was granted when Salah collected a pass from Szoboszlai, cut inside, and blasted the ball into the bottom corner, celebrating by taking a selfie with a fan in front of the Kop. The crowd erupted in joyous chants, and the atmosphere at Anfield reached fever pitch.The final goal came when Tottenham defender Destiny Udogie inadvertently turned the ball into his own net, sealing a 5-1 rout and sending the Liverpool fans into a frenzy. As the final whistle blew, Anfield reverberated with deafening cheers, and the celebrations began in full force.Liverpool's triumph marked their 20th league title, bringing them level with Manchester United at the top of the all-time list. It also represented a significant achievement for manager Arne Slot, who has steered the club to glory in his first season after replacing Jurgen Klopp last year.","Liverpool secured their 20th English top-flight title with a stunning 5-1 victory over Tottenham Hotspur at an electrified Anfield on Sunday.

In a controversial move, the All India Football Federation (AIFF) awarded the I-League trophy to Churchill Brothers on Sunday, just hours after the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) had stayed the decision and barred any formal felicitation. The defiant act could invite further scrutiny from global bodies like FIFA and CAS.Deputy secretary general M Satyanarayan handed the trophy to Churchill Brothers at a ceremony in Goa, claiming the AIFF only learned about the CAS order after the presentation. ""I was on a flight to Goa and the AIFF Secretariat was closed on Sunday.

Antonio Rudiger issued an apology as an Instagram Story.

Poll Which team do you think will win the next Clasico? It's too close to call Barcelona Real Madrid

Real Madrid came into the Copa del Rey final on the back of a horrid month. Defeats against Valencia and over both legs against Arsenal had thrown them out of Champions League and dented La Liga title hopes. Even in the Cup, they needed to claw from 1-3 down to beat Real Sociedad in the semi-final. On the field, it hasn't been smooth sailing by a long shot.Over the last two days, off-the-field antics took a massive hit as well. A club that prides itself on its class and gentlemanliness, showed neither in a haughty display which veered on petulance.At La Cartuja in Sevilla, Real Madrid were outplayed by a superior Barcelona side , losing 3-2 in extra time to lift the Cup for a record-extending 32nd time. It marked a third straight defeat for Real Madrid in Clasicos this season, scoring four and conceding 12. Two of those came in the finals - first in the Spanish Super Cup and now in the Copa. As far as warming up to the big job is concerned, Hansi Flick has done an incredible job. And the job is far from finished, Barcelona remain on course for a treble.Real Madrid, meanwhile, only have the league to play for. And that is hardly an easy passage. The Carlo Ancelotti-managed side are four points behind Barcelona with five matches to go. Winning the Clasico on May 11 is vital to the club's bid to avoid a trophy-less season. If it comes in a season where your arch-rivals win a treble, that is a recipe for disaster.Before all that, though, Real Madrid's conduct pre-and-post the Copa del Rey final has come under intense scrutiny. After the final whistle, Antonio Rudiger , Jude Bellingham and Lucas Vazquez were sent off for protesting amid ugly scenes.Both Bellingham and Rudiger were required to be restrained as they had a pop at the referee. The latter could even cop a lengthy ban for throwing an object at the referee from the sidelines. Questioning the referees had started at an institutional level . For months, Real Madrid TV attacked referees for their decisions and after taking umbrage with a decision in February, the club issued an official statement labelling officiating in the country as ""rigged"" and ""completely discredited"".Furthermore, the club has refused to make players available for pitch-side and mixed zone interactions during the league - a practice followed by every other club. Instead, Real Madrid players have kept their interactions limited to the club's official TV channel.Slamming of the referees and dissection of their decisions continued until it reached boiling point on Friday. In an emotional news conference before the Copa del Rey final, officials for the high-stakes encounter hit back.Referee Ricardo de Burgos Bengoetxea broke down in tears while explaining the impact Real Madrid's attacks have had on his family life and that of other referees.VAR referee Pablo Gonzalez Fuertes, seated alongside him, suggested officials will have to take ""much more serious measures"" while hinting at a possible strike.In response, Real Madrid didn't buckle down. Instead, they went into counter-attack. They pulled out of the scheduled open training session for the media, a press conference, president's traditional dinner and a photo-call.The game went ahead, with the same officials, despite suggestions in the Spanish media that Real Madrid were considering withdrawing. The focus, well and truly, was on the referees.For the most part, the referees did a good job of keeping the game flowing despite 34 fouls being committed by both teams and seven yellow cards being brandished out.Ironically, Barcelona were awarded a penalty in the sixth minute of stoppage time when Raphinha fell under pressure from Raul Asencio. As tension crept up, the cameras panned squarely on the officials, De Burgos Bengoetxea was called to assess the incident by the VAR official. Following a brief look, the decision was overturned.In a game that had 50-50 decisions galore, and players of both sides upset with the referee, Jules Kounde drilled in a low shot past Thibaut Courtois to seal the deal.As Real Madrid looked for yet another miracle, Kylian Mbappe was penalised for a foul, getting his hand in the face of a Barcelona player. That broke all the pent-up frustration for the Real Madrid players.Rudiger, already substituted by then, threw something at the referee and was sent off. It took several players and staff to contain him as a bag of ice burst in his hands - which may well have been his next projectile. After hours to cool down, the German defender has apologised for his behaviour.Bellingham, who had already vented to the officials in the tunnel before, was then sent off, too. As was Vazquez for coming onto the pitch to protest.Ancelotti admitted he had no idea about the last two red cards. A reflection of cluelessness that has plagued the Italian manager this season. The squad has struggled to find the right structure for the team. Since Toni Kroos, Nacho Fernandez and Joselu's departure in the summer, the club hasn't filled in the right replacements.Lamine Yamal's post-match message delivered the zinger. ""They can't handle us this year, we've proven it,"" said the teenager, wearing two pairs of sunglasses, the ice-cool antithesis to Madrid's red-hot rage.","Real Madrid lost 3-2 in extra time to Barcelona in the Copa del Rey final.

Madrid had issued furious statements about the refereeing team on Friday after they criticised the club's television channel for attacking Spanish officials this season, casting a shadow over the game.Controversy aside, the football was enthralling.Madrid started with top scorer Mbappe on the bench after an ankle injury and lost Ferland Mendy early on with a thigh issue.Barcelona dazzling winger Lamine Yamal, 17, dyed his hair blond for the game and led the assault on Thibaut Courtois' goal.The Catalans, who also won the first two Clasicos this season in La Liga and the Spanish Super Cup, scoring nine goals in the process, controlled the ball.They took the lead after 28 minutes, Pedri placing the ball into the top corner with precision and power from the edge of the box, a sensational goal set up by Yamal.Barcelona's opener brought Madrid out of their shell -- and also Mbappe off the bench to warm up.Bellingham netted but was offside. Vinicius Junior would have won a penalty when hacked down but had also strayed off in the build-up.Barcelona could have doubled their lead, with Dani Olmo's corner hitting the post and Cubarsi unable to turn home as Dani Ceballos held him back.The referee was lenient with some heated Madrid tackles, perhaps cowed by Friday's drama as the Spanish champions seethed at his pre-match comments.Madrid sent Mbappe on for Rodrygo Goes at half-time and soon he and Vinicius began to work Barcelona goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny.Mbappe pulled Madrid level almost on his own in the 70th minute, brought down after surging forward and firing home the free-kick off the post.Seven minutes later Madrid took the lead, Tchouameni heading in Arda Guler's corner.Barcelona responded when Yamal played a delicious pass over the top for Torres, which drew both Rudiger and Courtois, but the Spaniard beat both and rolled home.Controversy unsurprisingly reared its head before the match headed to extra-time.Barcelona clamoured for a penalty when Rudiger tripped Torres, and then were awarded one deep in stoppage time as Raphinha tumbled under pressure -- but the decision was overturned after a VAR review.In extra-time Barcelona were ascendent.They found their winner when Kounde intercepted an uncharacteristically loose Luka Modric pass and beat Courtois from range, sparking wild celebrations.The trio of dismissals and Madrid's pre-match histrionics regarding the officials will ensure the repercussions run on.The teams meet again in La Liga in May in a potential title decider.",Barcelona beat Real Madrid 3-2 in the Copa del Rey final in Seville.

What do Real Madrid want?

AS

Real Madrid 's bid to win the Copa del Rey for the 21st time, against arch-rivals Barcelona , took a massive twist on the eve of the clash at Sevilla's Estadio de La Cartuja.Instead of the Copa del Rey final focusing on Real Madrid's much-needed title bid after the embarrassing exit in the Champions League vs Arsenal, it has taken an unexpected turn towards off-field matters with La Liga chief Javier Tebas also getting involved.Ricardo de Burgos Bengoetxea , the referee appointed for the Copa del Rey final, addressed the media before the final. Referees holding a press conference is unconventional and raised quite a few eyebrows - not least at the Santiago Bernabeu and among the Real Madrid faithful.In the press conference, Bengoetxea became emotional while discussing the intense pressure he faces ahead of the match.He was questioned about a video released by Real Madrid's Club channel, Real Madrid TV, which highlighted his supposed mistakes in previous matches against them. This season RMTV have hit out at refereeing mistakes frequently and the club has refused to make its players available for mandatory media bytes with the official broadcaster for La Liga.When asked about the video, Bengoetxea could not hold back tears as he spoke about the impact on him and his family.""When your son comes back from school and other kids have said to him that his father is a thief, it's really hard,"" he said. ""They have no right to make us go through this, but it's not just something between professionals; a lot of families depend on this, and everyone should take some time to reflect on what they are doing.""Pablo Gonzalez Fuentes, who will serve as the VAR official for the Copa del Rey final, also criticised RMTV's actions. ""They have to understand the consequences of these videos,"" he said, explaining that they lead to online campaigns against officials.""We're seeing community managers on official social media platforms attacking the community for just one more like. We see actions by football players that suggest we're dishonest. When a journalist talks about 'theft,' fans take that frustration out on the child who's about to referee a youth team. We must address these types of situations and return to a healthier and cleaner style of football,"" he commented.""The consequences are that when you talk about theft and bad language, the frustration you generate in the fans is paid for by the little boy or girl who grabs a whistle and has to officiate a junior's game. It's the consequence of putting the target on a teammate's head,"" he added.After the press conference by the officials, Real Madrid, who had finished training in the Spanish capital and were to leave for Seville later, went into a huddle on a possible response.In retaliation, Real Madrid refused to hold their open training session at La Cartuja (scheduled for 8pm), a press conference with under-fire manager Carlo Ancelotti and a member of the squad. Additionally, Florentino Perez skipped the traditional presidents' dinner and the club missed the pre-match photo-call.In a statement on the club website, Real Madrid said the complaints by the referees were 'unacceptable'. ""These statements... made in a premeditated manner 24 hours before the final against one of the participants, demonstrate, once again, a clear and manifest animosity and hostility of these referees towards Real Madrid,"" said the Spanish league champions.Los Blancos took particular issue with the final's VAR referee Fuertes suggesting referees were ""united"" and looking to take collective action against the pressure they had received from Real Madrid TV.""Even more surprising statements, in a threatening tone... to announce supposed measures or actions that are far removed from the principles of fairness, objectivity and impartiality that should prevail just hours before (the final),"" continued Madrid's statement.""In view of the seriousness of what has happened, Real Madrid hopes that those in charge of the RFEF and the refereeing profession will act accordingly, adopting the relevant measures in defence of the prestige of the institutions they represent.""As per Spanish media, Real Madrid wanted the referees changed for the final and there were suggestions of the team pulling out of the competiiton and returning home.However at 10pm local time, Real Madrid rubbished those suggestions and claimed this option hadn't been considered.""In light of the rumours that have arisen in the last few hours, Real Madrid C.F. communicates that our team never considered refusing to play tomorrow's final.""Real Madrid understands that football's values must prevail, despite the hostility and animosity that has today once again been shown against our club, by the referees appointed for the final,"" said the statement.Madrid-based sports dailyreported later there was a conversation between Rafael Louzan, president of the Spanish FA , which oversees the Copa del Rey, and Real Madrid camp. It claims that RFEF acknowledged the inappropriateness of the comments made by the referees and made clear that Fuertes will not officiate Real Madrid matches for the rest of the season while leaving his role at the Technical Committee of Referees (CTA).","Real Madrid take on Barcelona in the Copa del Rey final on Saturday.

Poll Will Liverpool secure the Premier League title against Tottenham? No, they will not win Yes, they will win

Liverpool manager Arne Slot is preparing for a potential Premier League title celebration at Anfield on Sunday against Tottenham, needing just one point to secure the club's record-equalling 20th English championship. The achievement would come five years after their last title, which was celebrated in an empty stadium during the COVID-19 pandemic.Liverpool currently lead Arsenal by 12 points with five games remaining in their campaign, while Arsenal have only four matches left to play.""It's a big responsibility. We are aware that the last time this club won the league was during the Covid time. So everybody is looking forward to Sunday,"" Slot told reporters on Friday.""We know there's still a job to do. We need at least one point. Our fans know as well. When they come to the stadium they have to support us in the best possible way as they have done all season. It's a nice game to look forward to but also a responsibility we have for Sunday.""The title could have been decided earlier this week when Arsenal faced Crystal Palace. Liverpool's players and staff gathered to watch the match together, hoping to celebrate, but the game ended in a 2-2 draw.""It was different. Normally when you watch a game of football, you are either alone or with family or friends. But we watched it all together,"" Slot said. ""Before the game, I would have been surprised if the game ended in a draw. But during the game, I wasn't because Crystal Palace again showed what this league is all about.""The upcoming achievement would see Liverpool match Manchester United's record of 20 English titles. Slot, in his first season after replacing Jurgen Klopp, would become the first Dutch manager to win the Premier League.""No, I get these questions so it comes to your mind but it is the last thing you think of as a manager at this time. We saw last week how hard it was to get a win against a team that was nearly relegated at Leicester,"" Slot said. ""I am not getting carried away. We have faced Tottenham three times and I know how hard it is to beat them.""Liverpool's impressive season under Slot has seen them lose only twice in the league. The manager acknowledges the expectations that come with leading the club.""This club has to win trophies,"" Slot said. ""The good thing is most managers work here a long time so you have a few chances to win trophies. You are aware of that but that is not the first thing that you think about when you walk through this door.""Some have suggested Liverpool's success comes from Manchester City's decline and Arsenal's injury problems. Slot responded to these claims.""Everybody can have their own opinion. You might have a different opinion. That is the nice thing about the world we are living in. I am only here for a year so I can only tell you what I experienced,"" Slot said. ""It has never been as hard to end up in the top four or five.

The GEN3 Evo race car is tearing through the Formula E circuit in Season 11, redefining speed, agility, and performance. With lightning-fast acceleration, cutting-edge features, and a robust design, it has quickly become the dominant force on the track. For fans, it means electrifying action; for drivers, fierce new rivalries. In short, the GEN3 Evo is the future of racing.Faster, quicker, unstoppableThe GEN3 Evo can go from 0 to 60 mph in just 1.82 seconds (0-100 kph in 1.86s), making it 30% quicker than a current F1 car. With performance gains of 2%, it's not just fast — it’s engineered for excellence. It's also the world’s first net-zero carbon race car, with performance enhancements delivered through state-of-the-art software engineering.Aerodynamic body and enhanced gripSleek, sturdy, and more aerodynamic than ever, the GEN3 Evo is built for high-intensity, wheel-to-wheel racing. It features all-weather Hankook iON tires, offering 5–10% moe grip and crafted from 35% recycled and sustainable materials — a 9% improvement over the GEN3 specs.Top speedYes, you read that right.

With five rounds now complete in the 2024–25 Formula E World Championship, there are still 11 races to go before the season concludes in July. In Miami, it was Tag Heuer Porsche’s Pascal Wehrlein who took the top podium spot. However, despite the win, the German-Mauritian driver currently sits third in the overall drivers' standings.Current driver standings for this seasonLeading the championship is Nissan’s Oliver Rowland with 69 points. Rowland had a tough outing in Miami, finishing 10th and earning just one point. But his overall journey this season has been inspiring—starting the Sao Paulo E-Prix in December with zero points, he bounced back impressively. He clinched victory in the Mexico E-Prix (25 points), finished second in Jeddah Part 1 (18 points), and won Jeddah Part 2 (25 points). Thanks to this strong mid-season performance, his lacklustre Miami result hasn’t dented his lead.In second place is Tag Heuer Porsche’s Antonio Felix da Costa with 54 points. He finished runner-up in both the Sao Paulo and Mexico E-Prix races. While his performance dipped in the Jeddah double-header, he recovered well by finishing third in Miami and collecting 15 crucial points.Close behind is his teammate, Pascal Wehrlein, with 51 points. Wehrlein had a disappointing start in Sao Paulo but bounced back with a third-place finish in Mexico. Although his results in Jeddah were average, his win in Miami has significantly boosted his title hopes. A strong showing in Monaco could push him past Da Costa into second place.Also tied at 51 points is the youngest driver on the grid, Taylor Barnard. He impressed with a third-place finish in Sao Paulo and podiums in both Jeddah races—third in Part 1 and second in Part 2. While he struggled in Mexico and finished among the last in Miami, he remains a strong contender.

How Norman Nato, Nyck De Vries fared in

Miami E-Prix

Formula E drivers Norman Nato and Nyck De Vries are currently in Italy for the second round of the 2025 FIA World Endurance Championship (WEC). They participated in the 6 Hours of Imola Qualifying on Saturday, moving a step closer to the main race. Nato finished 9th, while De Vries secured 5th place in the session.Norman Nato, who races for Nissan in the Formula E Championship, represents Cadillac Racing in collaboration with Hertz Team Jota in the Hypercar category of the Endurance Championship. Nyck De Vries, from Mahindra Racing’s Formula E team, finished 5th in the Imola qualifying. He competes for Toyota Gazoo Racing in the WEC, alongside teammate Ryo Hirakawa, who placed 4th in qualifying.Calling it his best effort on track, De Vries told Toyota Europe Newsroom: “As a team, I think we can be fairly satisfied with qualifying fourth and fifth here. We maximised our package, as you can see from the tiny gap between the two cars. I don’t think we could have done much better than that; we did a strong job to execute a clean qualifying. The gap to the front cars looks quite big over one lap, but we will do our best with race pace, tyre management, and strategy to challenge for the podium.”Both drivers are now set to compete in the final race of the 6 Hours of Imola on Sunday, scheduled from 1 PM to 7 PM local time.In their last Formula E outing at the Homestead-Miami Speedway, Nato faced heartbreak after losing what looked like a sure win due to post-race penalties. Although he clinched pole and crossed the line first at the Miami E-Prix, he was relegated to 6th place in the revised results.De Vries had qualified 5th in Miami but ultimately dropped to 11th in the final standings after penalties were applied.Following this, they’ll shift focus to Round 6 of the Formula E World Championship—the highly anticipated Monaco double-header on May 3 and 4. With momentum building, fans of both electric and endurance racing will be keeping a close eye on their performances.Also Read: Following Miami E-Prix setback, Formula E driver Norman Nato gears up for Endurance race in Italy, greets fans with ""Buongiorno""","Formula E drivers Norman Nato and Nyck De Vries are currently in Italy for the second round of the 2025 FIA World Endurance Championship (WEC) They participated in the 6 Hours of Imola Qualifying on Saturday, moving a step closer to the main race.

NEW DELHI: India captain Suryakumar Yadav lauded his team's aggressive approach and praised Tilak Varma 's standout performance after India's 11-run victory over South Africa in the third T20I at Centurion. With the win, India now leads the four-match series 2-1.Though Suryakumar himself struggled with the bat, he was elated with how the team executed their game plan. Speaking at the post-match presentation, Suryakumar emphasized the squad's brand of cricket, particularly highlighting the backing of young players like Tilak Varma.""Very happy. What we spoke about in the team meeting, we played the brand of cricket we discussed. That's what we have been telling them to do,"" said Suryakumar. He added that the team's aggressive mindset is not just about words, but actions: ""Aggression and intent is always not about talking. They have made my job easier when I see them bat like that.""Tilak Varma was the star of the match, playing a sensational knock of 107 off 56 balls, guiding India to a formidable total of 219/6. Varma's blistering century included eight fours and seven sixes. His innings came after a personal request to the skipper to bat at No. 3. Suryakumar revealed, ""He [Tilak] came to my room at Gqeberha and said, 'Give me a chance at No. 3, I want to do well,' and I said, 'Go out there and express yourself.' He asked for it and he delivered.""Abhishek Sharma also contributed with a quick-fire 50 off 25 balls, but the rest of India's batting lineup faltered as South Africa's Andile Simelane and Keshav Maharaj took two wickets each.South Africa's chase was powered by Marco Jansen 's explosive 54 off 17 balls and Heinrich Klaasen's 41 from 22, keeping the Proteas in the game. But India's bowlers, led by Arshdeep Singh , held their nerve. Arshdeep picked up three crucial wickets and restricted South Africa in the death overs, while Varun Chakaravarthy claimed two wickets, sealing India's victory.Tilak Varma was named Player of the Match for his exceptional performance, and Suryakumar couldn't be prouder of the youngster. ""Very happy for him and his family,"" he said.","India beat South Africa by 11 runs in third T20 International at Centurion. India captain Suryakumar Yadav praised his team's aggressive approach. Tilak Varma was the star of the match, playing a sensational knock of 107.

Mohammed Shami returns, India get boost ahead of Border-Gavaskar Trophy | BTB Highlights

NEW DELHI: Former Australia captain Ricky Ponting took a fresh dig at India head coach Gautam Gambhir after clarifying his remarks about Virat Kohli 's performance.Speaking on the podcast 'The Run Home with Joel & Fletch,' Ponting again labeled Gambhir as a 'prickly character'. He suggested that Gambhir's reaction, during the press conference before leaving for Border-Gavaskar Trophy (BGT), was influenced by India's recent Test series loss to New Zealand.""I'm not sure if I mentioned a couple of them [other Indian batters], but I reckon he's just throwing me in the deep end, trying to find their two most experienced and make sure when they come out, they put that back on me,"" Ponting said.In the lead-up to the BGT, Ponting had raised concerns about Kohli's form. He highlighted Kohli's declining home average, which has dropped to almost 30, with only three centuries in the past five years. However, Ponting also acknowledged Kohli's excellent track record in Australia, suggesting that this tour could be an opportunity for him to regain his form.Ponting believes Gambhir misinterpreted his comments and reacted emotionally, possibly due to the recent series defeat.""I think the hair on the back of his neck was already standing up. We got a bit of history as well, but he took a chance to fire back at me,"" Ponting said, adding that Gambhir seemed anxious and was looking for a reason to retaliate.Despite their differences, Ponting stood by his initial assessment of Kohli's recent form, attributing his concerns to the statistical decline in Kohli's performance. Ponting, however, expressed confidence that the Australian tour could be a turning point for Kohli.""I said if there ever was a tour where he [Kohli] could turn things around, it would be this,"" Ponting noted.","Former Australia captain Ricky Ponting takes a fresh dig at India head coach Gautam Gambhir after clarifying his remarks about Virat Kohli's performance.

Champions Trophy - Future of India-Pakistan Cricket is in danger - Ahmed Shehzad & Sikander Bakht

🔴LIVE: IND v SA 3rd T20I Live: All eyes on Abhishek Sharma as visitors eye series lead in Centurion

NEW DELHI: The ongoing tension over the Champions Trophy remains one of the long-standing complexities in India-Pakistan cricket relations.Recently, Pakistan cricketer Ahmad Shahzad openly criticized India's stance on the upcoming tournament, voicing frustration over what he sees as India's 'false promises.'He pointed out that while Pakistan gives credit to India when they perform well on the field, their hesitance to play in Pakistan appears to be driven by more than just cricket concerns.""Pakistan now needs to step forward and clarify its stance. We've known for a long time that India are making false promises. Whenever they play well, we praise them because they deserve it. But when it comes to this issue (coming to Pakistan), India have been lying for a long time. Even before, whenever Pakistan would try to do something like this (hosting a mega event), India would try to financially damage it,"" said Ahmad Shahzad on the Pakistani channel Geo News.""And this time, they've crossed the line. Pakistan need to take a strong stance. If India don't want to come, let them stay away—enough is enough!"" added a frustrated Shahzad.In response to India's refusal to play in Pakistan for the 2025 Champions Trophy, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) is reportedly preparing to challenge this decision by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI).According to the Dawn newspaper, the PCB plans to question the International Cricket Council (ICC) to understand the rationale behind BCCI's stance.While a hybrid model, allowing India to play in a neutral venue, was proposed, PCB chairman Mohsin Naqvi has reportedly opposed this arrangement.The ICC now faces the difficult task of finding a solution, with options including moving the tournament out of Pakistan entirely, potentially to South Africa or the UAE.Some reports, however, have also suggested that Pakistan might consider withdrawing from the Champions Trophy if hosting rights are removed—a decision that would mark a significant escalation in the dispute.","Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) is reportedly preparing to challenge this decision by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) The ICC now faces the difficult task of finding a solution, with options including moving the tournament out of Pakistan entirely, potentially to South Africa or the UAE.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115275763,imgsize-50158,width-400,resizemode-4/115275763.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Marco Jansen 's blistering fifty, the fastest ever against India in T20Is, almost turned the tide in South Africa's favor, but India held on to clinch a nerve-wracking 11-run victory in the third T20I in Centurion.Jansen's late assault, which saw him reach fifty off just 16 balls, gave India a serious scare in the final moments of the match, but Arshdeep Singh 's calm death bowling secured the win, giving India an unbeatable 2-1 lead in the four-match series.Chasing India's imposing total of 219/6, South Africa appeared to be out of the contest at 169/6 after 18 overs. But Jansen had other plans. Walking in at No. 7, the tall all-rounder unleashed a furious attack on India's bowlers, hammering Hardik Pandya for 26 runs in the penultimate over, which included two sixes and three fours. His blitzkrieg brought South Africa within touching distance, needing 25 runs off the final over to pull off a miraculous win.Jansen's onslaught continued into the last over, where he smashed a six off Arshdeep Singh's second ball to reach his record-breaking fifty in just 16 deliveries, the fastest by any batter against India in T20I history. However, Arshdeep responded immediately, dismissing Jansen on the very next delivery to extinguish South Africa's hopes of a dramatic win. Despite Jansen's heroics, South Africa managed only 208/7, falling short by 11 runs.The explosive knock by Jansen, who finished with 54 off just 17 balls, almost overshadowed Tilak Varma's earlier century for India. Varma's unbeaten 107 off 56 balls, supported by Abhishek Sharma 's quickfire 50, had powered India to a commanding total. However, Jansen's extraordinary hitting in the final overs nearly turned the match on its head, forcing India to dig deep for the win.Arshdeep, who finished with figures of 3/37, held his nerve in the last over, conceding only 13 runs and delivering the crucial breakthrough that ended Jansen's charge.

NEW DELHI: With the standoff between India and Pakistan continuing over the 2025 Champions Trophy , there can be huge financial implications for the Pakistan Cricket Board ( PCB ) if the marquee tournament is either postponed or moved to any other country.The Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ) has made it clear that their men's cricket team will not be going to Pakistan for the tournament next year.The tournament is currently scheduled to take place in Pakistan from February 19 to March 9. Due to the uncertainty, no match schedule has been made public.This would be the first time that Pakistan would be hosting a global ICC event since they co-hosted the ODI World Cup in 1996 and the PCB wants to set an example that Pakistan, often targeted for security issues, is safe for big tournaments.But the tournament has been thrown into turmoil after India's refusal and the PCB has rejected the concept of a hybrid tournament, in which India would play its matches at neutral locations, like the United Arab Emirates.According to a report in Cricbuzz, if the tournament is either postponed or moved to any other country, the PCB risks facing ICC sanctions, including cuts to substantial ICC funding, if it withdraws.Not just that, the report adds that moving or postponing the Champions Trophy would mean losing out on potentially USD 65 million as hosting fees, substantial money for the PCB.The report adds that this loss would rankle further considering that PCB made serious investments to upgrade infrastructure for the Champions Trophy at the three earmarked venues - Karachi, Rawalpindi, and Lahore.The PCB has asked the ICC to explain India's refusal to send a team to Pakistan for the tournament.Pakistani media reported on Tuesday that the PCB would be unwilling to accept security reasons for India's refusal to visit, since New Zealand have toured Pakistan three times in the past two years, England have visited twice and Australia once in the same period.Without Pakistan's participation, the ICC could face contractual challenges, with broadcasters and sponsors expecting both teams to play in high-stakes matches.Legal disputes with commercial partners, potential revenue drops and a decline in ICC's financial distribution to members are likely consequences.With the BCCI insisting on a hybrid model, there is a possibility of a change of venue for the mega event.But as of now, the ball is in ICC's court.","The standoff between India and Pakistan continues over the 2025 Champions Trophy.

Premier India pacer to turn out for Bengal in Ranji game, reigniting talk of a possible late entry into India's Test squad in Australia

IND have what it takes to challenge this AUS team in upcoming #BGT | #beyondtheboundary

KOLKATA: India fast bowler Mohammed Shami is all set to play for Bengal in their next Ranji Trophy Elite Group 'C' game, putting to rest all speculation over his comeback plans after being left out of India's squad for the five-Test series for the Border-Gavaskar Trophy in Australia.Bengal will take on Madhya Pradesh in Indore from Wednesday.TOI has learnt that the 34-year-old pacer's movements will be closely monitored by physio Nitin Patel, who has travelled with the Uttar Pradesh-born cricketer and will be stationed in Indore over the next four days.Shami's fitness status was closely monitored ahead of India's BGT squad announcement but captain Rohit Sharma 's assertion that ""we don't want to take an undercooked Shami to Australia"" was indication the team management was not fully convinced about the fast bowler's Test-match recovery.Shami, however, was positive he could take the flight to Australia after playing a few Ranji matches. He can, however, play only one red-ball game to prove his fitness because the Ranji Trophy season will be played in two halves.In Shami's absence, India picked a largely inexperienced pace attack - including Akash Deep, Harshit Rana, Nitish Kumar Reddy and Prasidh Krishna - to back up Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Siraj. Mukesh Kumar, Navdeep Saini , and Khaleel Ahmed are in the reserves.The Bengal team management has said the Indian cricket board ( BCCI ) has not issued any guidelines or restrictions on Shami. ""We are happy to have him back,"" Bengal coach Laxmi Ratan Shukla told TOI from Indore. ""Shami was bowling at full throttle at the nets for some time and it will be good to see how he fares in a competitive match now.""Shami met his Bengal teammates in Bengaluru after the team's Ranji Trophy match against Karnataka last week. ""He was keen to make a comeback at that time, saying that he was feeling fine,"" Shukla stated.Shami has been sidelined for a year with an ankle injury. His name did not feature in the initial Bengal squad list but he made a late entry after getting the necessary clearance on Monday night from the National Cricket Academy (NCA), which had become almost his second home for the last six months as he rehabilitated from a surgery in February for an Achilles tendon injury which he carried into last year's ODI World Cup.In spite of not being at peak fitness, he ended up as the top wicket-taker in the World Cup with 24 scalps in seven matches.Shami had made steady progress and last month announced that he was ""100 per cent pain-free"" after bowling with full run-up at the Chinnaswamy Stadium following the conclusion of the first Test between India and New Zealand. He has always maintained that ""it's better that I play one or two domestic matches before going to Australia"".It was anticipated that Shami would be able to return in time for the red ball in Test cricket has been quite phenomenal,"" Ponting said.""You talk to all the players that face him as well, they talk about how hard and difficult he is. And then, when you think about where the first two Tests are (in Perth and Adelaide), he'd be perfectly suited to bowling in those conditions. So, I think that's the only real chink in India's armour,"" Ponting said.It remains to be seen if Shami will get on the flight to Australia if he performs well for Bengal.",Mohammed Shami set to play for Bengal in their next Ranji Trophy Elite Group 'C' game.

NEW DELHI: Former Pakistan cricketer Basit Ali proposed a unique solution to the ongoing India-Pakistan standoff over the Champions Trophy 2025 .He suggested that if the International Cricket Council (ICC) decides to move forward with a hybrid model , it would be best to place India and Pakistan in separate pools.According to Basit, this setup could ease logistical and diplomatic tensions by reducing direct encounters until later stages.However, he added that neither the ICC nor the broadcasters would favour this idea, as India-Pakistan matches are a massive revenue generator.“If cricket is to continue and the hybrid model is to be maintained, place Pakistan in one pool and India in the other. But neither the ICC nor the broadcasters will be happy with this, because this is an opportunity to make money,"" Basit said on his YouTube channel.Ali didn’t hold back on his opinion of how crucial the rivalry is for global cricket’s financial ecosystem.“Duniya bewakoof hai,” he added, calling the world “foolish” for elevating other series like the Ashes or India-Australia matchups to the same level.""The world is foolish (duniya bewakoof hai) to say that The Ashes is amazing or that the India-Australia series is amazing; it’s not like that. As long as cricket is being played and Pakistan-India matches are happening, there will be money; otherwise, there won’t be,” Basit remarked, explaining the financial magnetism of the India-Pakistan rivalry, which remains unmatched in terms of viewership and revenue generation.Amid escalating tensions, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) is reportedly preparing to formally approach the ICC, requesting clarity on the Board of Control for Cricket in India’s (BCCI) refusal to visit Pakistan for the Champions Trophy next year.PCB chairman Mohsin Naqvi has reportedly dismissed the hybrid model proposal that would shift India’s games to a neutral location, insisting instead on securing Pakistan’s hosting rights.The Champions Trophy, set for February 19 to March 9, 2025, is scheduled to be held in Pakistan.If an agreement isn’t reached, the ICC may consider moving the tournament to an alternative location, with South Africa and the UAE emerging as potential hosts, according to multiple reports.As bilateral cricket between the two nations has been frozen since 2012, ICC is not finding itself in an easy place.In a similar instance, the 2023 Asia Cup saw a hybrid model that moved India’s games to Sri Lanka, while Pakistan retained partial hosting rights.","Former Pakistan cricketer Basit Ali has proposed a unique solution to the ongoing India-Pakistan standoff over the Champions Trophy 2025.

According to Basit, this setup could ease logistical and diplomatic tensions by reducing direct encounters until later stages.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-115237714,imgsize-61574,width-400,resizemode-4/115237714.jpg"

#LIVE: What is future of Champions Trophy? | #beyondtheboundary

NEW DELHI: Former Australian pacer Brett Lee has come up with a piece of advice for Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli , who endured terrible runs with the bat in Test cricket this year.Lee suggested that Rohit and Virat should take a step back from the game to focus on refining their techniques ahead of the upcoming series against Australia.Speaking on his YouTube channel, Lee emphasised how recent poor performances could lead to mounting pressure on both Rohit and Kohli.""When you have a couple of bad runs back-to-back, that's when the pressure could set in. I guess the thing now is someone like Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma just have to go back to the drawing board. Work on that technique, freshen up, get away from cricket as much as they can and then hit the ground running when they go to Australia, because I can promise you - these Australian fast bowlers will attack Rohit Sharma with that brand new ball,"" Brett Lee said.So far in 2024, both Kohli and Rohit have struggled to find their best form, attracting scrutiny following India's recent 0-3 series loss against New Zealand.Rohit has accumulated 588 runs from 11 matches this year, averaging 29.40 with two centuries and two fifties. Meanwhile, Kohli has managed just 250 runs from six matches (12 innings), averaging 22.72 with just one half-century.Former Aussie batter Michael Hussey backed Rohit and Kohli and said that one cannot write off champion players like them.Speaking on Fox Sports, Hussey said Aussies will find out where India stand in terms of ""mentally and from a skill perspective"" only after the first Test match of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy . He added that India have got many players who are crowd-pullers.""We will find out in the first Test match where they are at, mentally and from a skill perspective as well. They will be hurt by this, India. They have got a lot of crowd pullers and quality. We just heard from Gambhir talking about Rohit and Kohli not making runs. The silliest thing you can do is to write off champion players,"" Hussey said.",Brett Lee says Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma should take a step back from the game.

The celebrated couple, who often keep their personal life private, appeared relaxed and happy, embracing some downtime together.Star Indian batter Kohli, who is currently in Australia for the high-profile Border-Gavaskar Trophy , took the opportunity to spend quality time with Anushka and Vamika, exploring the scenic city and enjoying moments away from the cricket field.Fans were delighted to catch a glimpse of the family, with photos of them enjoying the coffee on the streets of Perth going viral in no time.Kohli, the first Indian player to arrive in Australia on Sunday, officially began his preparations for India’s opening Test against Australia, starting on November 22 in Perth, by training at the WACA practice pitches on Wednesday.With precision and focus, he hit the nets, setting the tone for the upcoming series. Kohli’s early arrival in Perth has caught attention, reflecting his intent to sharpen his game well ahead of the series opener.His practice sessions have notably focused on short-of-length deliveries, a staple of Australian pitches, as he looks to acclimate to the unique challenges posed by local conditions.Kohli’s typically reliable bat has been uncharacteristically quiet this year. His 2024 stats highlight a challenging period, with only 488 runs in 25 innings (19 matches) across formats, averaging just 20.33 and including two half-centuries.His recent form in Test cricket has also raised concerns; in 10 innings over five home matches against Bangladesh and New Zealand, he managed a modest 192 runs. These numbers underscore a dip in form that’s unusual for the prolific batter, adding pressure as he heads into the high-stakes five-Test series against Australia, where he’ll look to regain his rhythm and confidence.","Virat Kohli and Anushka Sharma were recently spotted in Perth.

Virat & Rohit’s Home Struggles: Left-Arm Spin & Lost Intent? | Beyond the Boundary Highlights

India captain Rohit Sharma 's availability for the first Test of the coming Border Gavaskar Trophy (BGT) is still uncertain, but Australia have their plans in place to ""torpedo"" him whenever he comes out to open during India's tour, says former leg-spinner Kerry O'Keeffe.Rohit has had a forgettable time lately in Test cricket , scoring just 133 runs in 10 innings at home leading up to the BGT. And while he will be satisfied with the 2-0 sweep against Bangladesh, Rohit admitted not being at his best as a captain during the embarrassing 0-3 whitewash against New Zealand.The Aussie pace battery of Michael Starc, captain Pat Cummins and Josh Hazlewood will, therefore, try to put Rohit under pressure, as have been Australia's tactics historically against the visiting captains.""Rohit Sharma may miss one or two Tests, but he is the captain, and Australia always tries to torpedo the visiting captain. It's been a tactic they've used forever, and I think they'll go very hard at Rohit Sharma,"" O'Keeffe told foxsports.com.au.Along with Rohit, India's other premier batsman, Virat Kohli, has been feeling the heat for a while because of his extended lean patch. In six Tests matches Kohli has played so far in 2024, he has scored just 250 runs in 12 innings at an average of 22.72, including a solitary half-century.O'Keeffe believes Australia should remain wary of the batsman in Kohli, who has been a thorn in the flesh for the Aussies over the years. He said Kohli's form could be one of the decisive factors of this BGT.""Kohli, who has worried them (Australia) over the years, what a stunning player he's been; but in sport, if you sense that the king of the jungle is slightly weaker, you poke a bit of cheek at him. I'm fascinated to see what Virat Kohli ends up with at the end of the summer. It could be the decisive point in the whole summer,"" he said.""If he has an absolutely blazing series, India could win.""The first Test begins on November 22 in Perth.","Rohit Sharma's availability for the first Test of the coming Border Gavaskar Trophy (BGT) is still uncertain.

India edged South Africa by 11-runs in the third T20I to take an unsurmountable 2-1 series lead in the four match series. The fourth and final T20I will be played at Wanderers on Friday.Tilak Varma 's staggering show of an unbeaten 107 runs and Abhishek Sharma's brisk 50 took India to 219/6 in 20 overs while batting first.In reply, South Africa ran India close to reach 208/7. Marco Jansen's 17-ball 54 gave India nervous moments during the defence of the total. But he eventually fell in the final over to alleviate any chance of a remarkable turnaround in outcome.Jansen top-scored for South Africa followed by Heinrich Klaasen's 22-ball 41. Aiden Markram, Reeza Hendricks and Ryan Rickelton had also chipped in with 29, 21 and 20 respectively at the top of the order.For India, Arshdeep Singh proved decisive to fend off South Africa's attempts, delivering with the new ball and at the fag end of the match. He finished with figures of 3/37 while Varun Chakravarthy took two wickets for 54 runs.Earlier, Tilak Varma delivered an outstanding performance, scoring an impressive 107 not out, as India set a formidable total of 219/6.

He formed a crucial 107-run partnership with Abhishek for the second wicket, building a solid foundation after the early loss of Sanju Samson (0).Although Keshav Maharaj (2/36) slowed down the scoring during the middle overs, Tilak launched a late assault, scoring 52 runs off just 22 balls in the final six overs, ensuring India capitalized on their strong start.His explosive batting helped overshadow the struggles of skipper Suryakumar Yadav (1), Hardik Pandya (18), and Rinku Singh (8).Samson was dismissed for a second consecutive duck in this series after being beaten by low bounce from Marco Jansen, a stark contrast to his hundred in the series opener. However, India rebounded strongly this time, with Tilak and Abhishek taking full advantage of the pitch that offered good bounce and carry.Abhishek's quick-fire fifty provided a much-needed boost to the Indian side, as his ability to hit through the line after creating space proved effective.

Sri Lanka batters shine

Kusal Mendis and Avishka Fernando both slammed centuries to set up a convincing 45-run victory for Sri Lanka in the rain-interrupted first one-day international against New Zealand on Wednesday.Kusal, 29, struck a career-best 143 and Avishka hit 100 as Sri Lanka posted a commanding 324-5 in 49.2 overs before rain stopped play.New Zealand, chasing a revised target of 221 off 27 overs, were restricted to 175-9 in the day-night game played at Dambulla.The Kiwis started off confidently but then lost five wickets in less than five overs for the addition of just 22 runs.It was Maheesh Theekshana who triggered the collapse with the wickets of openers Will Young and Tim Robinson, who shared an 88-run stand off just 79 balls.Robinson fell to a sharp stumping by Kusal, and four balls later, Theekshana bowled Young to swing the momentum towards Sri Lanka.From there on, it was downhill all the way for the visitors as the rest of the batsmen failed to live up to the task.""When you lose two set guys, it can be difficult on these wickets,"" said Kiwi skipper Mitchell Santner.""We tried to keep firing shots, but if you lose wickets in clumps, it's a challenge.""Earlier, Kusal and Avishka stitched together a 206-run stand off 215 balls for the highest second-wicket partnership in ODIs for Sri Lanka against New Zealand.Their effort eclipsed a 21-year-old record held by Sanath Jayasuriya and Hashan Tillakaratne, who added 170 against the Black Caps in the 2003 World Cup in Bloemfontein.The stand was also the highest partnership for any wicket at Dambulla in ODIs.""I thought it will be tough for us (with the wet ball) and it also didn't turn too much,"" said Sri Lankan captain Charith Asalanka.""Avishka and Kusal batted really well and the best thing was that both of them scored hundreds.""For Avishka, it was his first century since 2021, breaking a dry spell after a string of low scores.Avishka's 115-ball knock, including nine fours and two sixes, came to an end when he was caught while attempting a sweep shot off Ish Sodhi. It was his fourth ODI hundred.Kusal's century was also his fourth in ODIs and first this year.His knock was the highest individual score at Dambulla, surpassing India's Shikhar Dhawan's 132 in 2017.A cameo 40-run knock by Asalanka off just 28 balls capped a fine day with the bat for the islanders.It was New Zealand paceman Jacob Duffy who dismissed Kusal, caught at extra cover by Henry Nicholls.Kusal's brisk 128-ball knock was studded with 17 fours and two sixes.Sri Lanka's batters seized control after Asalanka won the toss and opted to bat first.Opener Pathum Nissanka was dismissed early for 12, but Kusal and Avishka made the most of the conditions.The New Zealand spinners struggled to rein in the Sri Lankan batsmen, who kept the scoreboard ticking at over 6.5 runs per over.Rain halted play just one ball into Sri Lanka's innings, causing a 39-minute delay.

This comes at the back of his performance in the Vinoo Mankad Trophy 2024-25 where he was the highest run-scorer with 492 runs in five games.But before him, southpaw Lomror anchored the innings after taking to the crease in the 10th over.

NAGPUR: A couple of fielding lapses and the rub of green going the other way undid the good work done by Vidarbha bowlers at VCA’s Jamtha Stadium on Wednesday.Gujarat , almost down and out at 150 for 6, made the most of the run of luck to finish Day 1 on 281 for 6 in 86 overs to keep the Elite Group ‘B’ Ranji Trophy match wide open.The first fielding lapse happened in the 9th over, when Gujarat were 10 for 2: Priyank Panchal edged a delivery from medium pacer Praful Hinge when on 9.Yash Rathod , standing at gully grassed a regulation catch. Then in the 43rd over, when Gujarat were 113 for 5: Vishal Jayswal , on 3 off 12 balls, whacked the ball with all his might towards the bowler.Off spinner Akshay Wakhare failed to react in time to the difficult caught and bowled chance as the tracer bullet raced to the straight boundary.Post the reprieve, Panchal (88;158b;9x4;2x6) went on to post his second fifty of the season. Jayswal, playing his second First Class match, posted his maiden century (110;125b;12x4;4x6) in the format. Together, the two brought Gujarat back into the game after they were pushed to a tight corner by Vidarbha bowlers.Panchal lived a charmed life on Wednesday. After the reprieve by Rathod, Vidarbha pacers not only beat Panchal often but also induced edges of his bat. Much to the despair of the hosts, though, the edges either fell short of the slip cordon or flew over them.Making the most of his good fortune, Panchal posted his fifty by lofting Wakhare over straight boundary for a six. A Praful Hinge yorker finally ended his innings.At the other end, Jayswal, after hitting a boundary on the ball on which he got a life, clobbered 11 more fours and fours sixes to finish Day 1 unbeaten on 110 off 125 balls. Jayswal used every variant of the sweep shot — conventional, fine and slog — as he battered Vidarbha's spin duo of Wakhare and Harsh Dubey At tea, Jayswal along with skipper Chintan Gaja had added 27 runs in 49 balls. Post the break, the two snatched the Day 1 honours from Vidarbha bowlers by remaining unbeaten for the entire third session.Their unfinished 131-run seventh wicket partnership, the highest of the day for Gujarat, has kept the game wide open. The scenario looked highly unlikely at one point as Vidarbha bowlers had reduced them to 151 for 6 inside the second session.Vidarbha opening bowlers were on the money in the morning session after putting Gujarat in to bat. Hinge sent back Aarya Desai (0;7b) while Aditya Thakare trapped Manan Hingrajia (1;20b) lbw as Gujarat laboured to 11 for 2 in 20 overs. In the 20th over, Hinge removed Umang Kumar (15;28b;1x4;1x6) as Gujarat reached lunch at 85 for 3.In the second session too, Vidarbha bowlers picked up three wickets. The rearguard action by Jayswal and Gaja (43;123b;7x4) though denied Vidarbha bowlers any breakthrough in the last session of the day.",Gujarat finish Day 1 on 281 for 6 in 86 overs to keep the Elite Group ‘B’ Ranji Trophy match wide open.

Coming after injury and scoring a hundred…it is incredible. We (Abhishek and me) both were under pressure and this knock was important for both of us.”This match was not only special for Tilak's century but also marked a personal best for both openers. It was Tilak's first half-century in nine innings and Abhishek's first fifty in eight matches.Tilak acknowledged that the pitch at Centurion presented unique challenges, particularly at the start of their innings due to its unpredictable nature.“It was challenging at the start - wicket was two-paced. After that, it went well. I tried to hold my shape and was trying to focus on the basics. We talked about following the basics.”The Hyderabad batter, who became the 12th Indian to score a T20I century, expressed confidence in their team's ability to defend the substantial total.“Our spinners are bowling well.

The India vs South Africa 3rd T20I was delayed due to flying ants swarming across Centurion on Wednesday. The umpires consulted with players from both teams before suspending play.The players were forced to leave the field due to the insects, which were present in large numbers. On-air commentators confirmed that they were 'flying ants.'It is not uncommon for insects to halt play in South Africa, but the culprits in a match against Sri Lanka in 2017 were bees, who interrupted play for over an hour.Cricket South Africa posted on X, ""Play has been halted due to a small pest problem. 'Flying ants' are running amok at the stadium, so we will wait for them to disperse before resuming play.""The game was held up for half-an-hour and resumed at 11:10pm IST (7:40pm local time).Earlier, in the third T20 International at Centurion's SuperSport Park, Tilak Varma shone brightly, smashing an unbeaten century to propel India to an imposing 219/6 against South Africa.Promoted to number three, Varma grabbed the opportunity with a scintillating 107 off just 56 balls. This maiden T20I century marked him as the second youngest Indian and 12th overall from the nation to achieve this feat in men's T20Is.Walking in during the very first over, Varma faced a two-paced wicket with fearless aggression. He capitalised on every opportunity, sending the ball soaring for eight fours and seven sixes.Varma's innings was a masterclass in powerful hitting, with all 71 runs coming from boundaries on the leg side. His ability to pace the innings while showcasing breathtaking stroke-play was remarkable.Abhishek Sharma provided solid support with a brisk 25-ball fifty, ending his lean patch. Their 107-run partnership for the second wicket proved instrumental in shifting the momentum, effectively utilising the short boundaries during the powerplay.For South Africa, bowling duties were shared by Andile Simelane and Keshav Maharaj, each claiming two wickets. India, opting to bat first, faced an early setback as Sanju Samson was dismissed for consecutive golden ducks, undone by Jansen's subtle swing.However, Abhishek and Tilak combined brilliantly to wrest back control, putting South Africa on the defensive.Varma started his onslaught with a four and a six off Jansen. Abhishek, initially taking his time, then hammered Gerard Coetzee for two fours and a six in a high-scoring second over. Varma continued his assault on Lutho Sipamla, finding the boundary twice with a pull and a straight drive, while Sharma launched Simelane for two consecutive sixes. India ended the powerplay at a commanding 70/1.The boundaries kept flowing after the Powerplay. Sharma danced down the track to hit Aiden Markram for four, while Varma effortlessly reverse-swept him for six before hooking Coetzee for another maximum off a no-ball. Sharma continued his aggressive approach, dispatching Maharaj for a six, before reaching his fifty with a single.However, Maharaj struck back, trapping Sharma lbw, ending the impactful partnership. Suryakumar Yadav then fell prey to Simelane, caught at sweeper cover.Hardik Pandya, known for his elegant strokeplay, struck three boundaries before Maharaj trapped him lbw with a pinpoint straight delivery. Varma, having reached his fifty off a mere 32 balls, continued his onslaught, lofting Maharaj over extra cover for four and following it up with two more boundaries.Coetzee bore the brunt of Varma's aggression, conceding a six over long-on off an overpitched delivery. Varma then showcased his wristy brilliance, whipping another maximum over deep square leg and following it up with a boundary.Simelane returned to dismiss a struggling Rinku Singh. However, debutant Ramandeep Singh announced his arrival in style, smashing a six off his very first ball in international cricket before adding a wristy drive for four.Varma reached his century in 51 balls with a chipped drive past mid-off for four off Sipamla. He then added a scooped six over fine leg off a free-hit delivery.Although Ramandeep was run out in the final over, Varma's whirlwind knock ensured India finished with an imposing total.India 219/6 in 20 overs (Tilak Varma 107 not out, Abhishek Sharma 50; Andile Simelane 2-34, Keshav Maharaj 2-36) against South Africa","India vs South Africa 3rd T20I was delayed due to flying ants.

Argentina looks to Messi

Vinicius under pressure

Unfinished business

Argentina and Brazil will have two of their leading stars available again as South American qualifying for the 2026 World Cup resumes with the last two rounds of games this year. Defending World Cup champion Argentina will once again count on goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez , who was suspended for two international matches in October. Brazil will bring back winger Vinicius Júnior , who missed the last two qualifiers through injury but has recovered.South American leaders Argentina will play at Paraguay on Thursday, shortly after fourth-place Brazil visits Venezuela.Also on Thursday, host Ecuador and Bolivia will face off in Guayaquil.Potentially the most interesting match of the 11th round will be played on Friday in Montevideo, where third-place Uruguay hosts second-place Colombia. The bottom two in the 10-team standings, Peru and Chile, will meet the same day.All teams play again next Tuesday in the 12th round of games, when Argentina hosts Peru and Brazil has a home game against Uruguay.Argentina currently has 22 points, three more than Colombia, with Uruguay and Brazil third and fourth with 16 points each. Ecuador and Paraguay, with 13 points, complete the top six which are direct spots in the next World Cup.Bolivia has 12 points, and its seventh place would qualify the Andean team for an international playoff. Venezuela (11), Peru (6) and Chile (5) complete the standings.Argentina can move even closer to a spot at the World Cup by beating Paraguay and Peru.Captain Lionel Messi will be his team's best hope for goals once again after his hat trick and two assists in the 6-0 win against Bolivia in October, with the 37-year-old the top scorer in the current South American qualifying.Argentina will travel to Asuncion with an additional challenge since Paraguay has been unbeaten since coach Gustavo Alfaro, an Argentine, took over in the middle of the year. In September, the Paraguayans beat Brazil 1-0.Coach Lionel Scaloni faced a last-minute injury that could force even more changes in Argentina's defense. Lisandro Martinez suffered an apparent abdomen injury during Manchester United's 3-0 Premier League victory over Leicester and was discharged from international duty. Scaloni had already lost Germán Pezzella.Pressure on Brazil coach Dorival Júnior was eased in October after two wins in qualifying over Chile and Peru. And Vinicius wasn't on duty in either of them.Fans will pay close attention to the winger's performances against tough defenses at Venezuela and later against Uruguay, as he tries to reproduce for Brazil the same decisive performances for Real Madrid.Brazil once again will not have Neymar, who picked up a muscular injury earlier this month. There's no big name as a center forward because Rodrygo is injured, too, and Endrick was not chosen. Vinicius will likely have to link up effectively with Raphinha and Luiz Henrique.Vinicius will face two teams that are in a degree of turmoil. Venezuela hasn't won any of its last six qualifiers, and Uruguay coach Marcelo Bielsa is still under fire from former players for his handling of the team.Two wins for Brazil won't secure the team a spot at the next World Cup just yet, but they will give fans and players some reassurance after a turbulent year.Colombia is hardly expecting a friendly reception in Montevideo on Friday. After all, there's unfinished business with Uruguay since their turbulent semifinal encounter at the Copa América in the United States in July.Colombia's victory kicked off a brawl between Colombian fans and relatives of the Uruguay players. Led by striker Darwin Núñez, the Uruguayans went into the stands to defend their relatives. Núnez was later suspended for five matches.Uruguay's Bielsa will be without two key midfielders, Nicolás de la Cruz and Giorgian de Arrascaeta, both injured. Uruguay has not won since its third-place match at the Copa America.","Argentina and Brazil will have two of their leading stars available again as South American qualifying resumes.

A new era begins at Manchester United as Ruben Amorim becomes the latest coach to take on the challenge of reviving the storied English club.After more than a decade of on-field decline the 20-time English champion has turned to a 39-year-old Portuguese who has delivered trophies and a thrilling style of soccer to Sporting Lisbon , but takes over a club that has made a habit of wrecking even the biggest reputations.High-caliber managers have come and gone, more than $1 billion has been spent on player signings, yet United just can't seem to get it right.""If anybody knew the answer (for that), we wouldn't have had the last 10, 11 years,"" Andy George, a 40-year-old United fan from Worcestershire, told The Associated Press. ""I always back the manager ... but it needs to work now.""George said he had been a supporter for 30 years and traveled around 100 miles (160 kilometers) for last week's 2-0 win against PAOK in the Europa League.Proven winner Amorim - a former Portugal international - was Lisbon coach from 2020 and ended its 19-year wait for the Portuguese title in 2021. He won it again in 2024 and his achievements led to links with jobs at Liverpool , Manchester City and Barcelona before he was hired to replaceErik ten Hag at the start of the month.""I'm not naive, I know that it's going to be very different, very tough,"" Amorim said Sunday after his final game with Sporting. ""But I feel that I'm ready. I'm at peace now, I can focus on my new job.""He is United's sixth permanent coach since club great Alex Ferguson retired in 2013 after winning his 13th Premier League title. Ferguson won 28 major trophies, including two Champions Leagues, and his record has cast a shadow over all of his successors.David Moyes was the first to try to step into his shoes, lasted eight months and began what has been a cycle of hiring, firing and reboots in an attempt to return the club to its past glories.Since then United has gone through Champions League winners (Louis van Gaal and Jose Mourinho), an iconic former player (Ole Gunnar Solskjaer) and one of Europe's emerging coaching talents (Ten Hag), but has not been able to stop City from dominating English soccer, while Liverpool, Chelsea and even Leicester have lifted the title in that time.High expectations United hopes Amorim will be the man to finally break the cycle.""We cannot ignore how he has changed Sporting,"" United midfielder Casemiro said Sunday. ""We know that Sporting won many titles, changed the club with titles, with trophies. He has already proved that he is a coach that has won a lot.""Amorim made a spectacular statement even before officially taking up his new role when, while serving out his notice at Lisbon, his team routed City 4-1 in the Champions League last week.""I was like, 'Oh, my gosh!' I lost my mind,"" said Joshua Hanley, a United fan from Kansas City who had flown to England to watch the PAOK game. ""We were changing airplanes and I'm sitting there kind of watching the score on my phone.""It was a fantastic start.""Amorim joked that he would be considered the new Ferguson if he beat City.Hanley's expectations are more modest to begin with.""If we can make top six, it would be a fantastic end of the season,"" he said, adding that he wants Amorim to ""make football exciting again"".New structure Amorim is the first head coach hired since British billionaire Jim Ratcliffe became a minority owner of United in February, assumed control of soccer operations and installed a new leadership team as part of his overhaul.Chief exectuive Omar Berrada was lured from City and sporting director Dan Ashworth came from Newcastle. Dave Brailsford, who helped Britain become a global force in cycling, is a director on United's soccer board.While Ten Hag was given a contract extension following an end of season review in the summer, he was appointed under a former regime. United's woeful start to the campaign - losing four of its opening nine league games - ultimately cost him.Amorim has the benefit of being chosen by United's new hierarchy and the final piece of leadership team assembled by Ratcliffe, which should afford him time implement his plans.Ambition Not that he is likely to get a free pass this season. The timing of the decision to fire Ten Hag could be considered instructive in terms of United's ambition.There have only been 11 rounds of the league campaign and Amorim takes over a team that, although 13th in the standings, is only four points off third place. It also remains in three cup competitions.Champions League qualification remains very much in play and after United spent around $230 million on transfers in the offseason, Amorim will be expected to quickly deliver winning soccer to a club that has been playing catchup for too long.In the long term, the challenge is to return United to the summit of English and European soccer - a task that has proved beyond any of his last five predecessors.",Ruben Amorim becomes Manchester United's sixth permanent coach since Alex Ferguson retired in 2013.

The match witnessed an early goal from Hugo Boumous in the fourth minute, while Manvir Singh found the equaliser for the visitors in the 36th, keeping the spectators engaged throughout the 90 minutes.Mohun Bagan had the lion's share of possession (61%) and 11 corners to Odisha's nil, but they failed to convert those into goals as the Kalinga Warriors dug deep to soak in the pressure and charge on the counterattack. Couple of good attempts by former Bagan striker Roy Krishna and midfielder Lalthathanga Khawlhring, aka Puitea, for the hosts went abegging as the scoreline stayed level till the final whistle.The hosts, Odisha FC, drew first blood when their midfield maestro, Hugo Boumous, found the back of the net with a well-placed right-footed shot from close range. The goal came after a set-piece situation inside the box, with Ahmed Jahouh providing the assist with a fine touch. The ball took a deflection off a MBSG defender before nestling into the back of the net, leaving goalkeeper Vishal Kaith with no chance of making a save.Odisha FC's resolute defence, led by the towering presence of Mourtada Fall, stood tall against the fancied MBSG attack, which had scored 12 goals before this encounter. The young Odisha backline thwarted the visitors' attempts to find an equaliser, frustrating their potent attacking force.However, MBSG's persistent threat paid off when Manvir Singh restored parity for the Mariners. The winger's well-timed header from the centre of the box found the bottom-right corner, leaving Odisha goalkeeper Amrinder Singh helpless despite getting his hands to the ball. The assist came from the pivotal midfielder Dimitri Petratos, who delivered a precise cross following a corner kick. Saviour Gama, who had conceded the corner, was stationed on the goal line but could not prevent the header from crossing the line.The first half ended with the scores level at 1-1, setting the stage for an exciting second period. Both teams displayed resilience and determination, with Odisha backline standing firm against MBSG's relentless attacks, while the visitors' defence remained vigilant to thwart any potential threats from the hosts.In the end, the tie ended in a keenly-fought draw.While Odisha FC will be pleased with their defensive resilience after conceding 13 goals before this game, MBSG will rue their missed chances to secure all three points.

Ruud misses chance

TURIN: Carlos Alcaraz opened his account at the ATP Finals on Wednesday with an entertaining 6-3, 7-6 (10/8) win over Andrey Rublev , while Casper Ruud missed an early chance to reach the semi-finals after losing in straight sets to Alexander Zverev .World number three Alcaraz comfortably defeated Rublev to lift himself off the bottom of the John Newcombe Group and looked in much better form despite struggling with fatigue and illness in the lead-up to the match.There had been some doubt as to whether Alcaraz, who lost his opening match in straight sets to Ruud, would continue in Turin after quickly ending his training session on Tuesday, with his coach Juan Carlos Ferrero saying that he had trouble breathing.""I could be better, I'm not going to lie,"" said Alcaraz on court after beating Rublev.""I've been struggling with my health the last week and today I thought I was going to feel better. I was OK to play, but thinking about the first match I was thinking a lot about that I was sick, that I couldn't play.""Today I really wanted to step on the court and just think about tennis , try to play a high level... When I played the first match I felt like I did not entertain the people, I did not play good tennis.""Alcaraz, who has won the Wimbledon and French Open titles this season, cruised to the first set in 38 minutes, breaking Rublev in game seven and quickly winning the next two to go one set ahead.And although the Spaniard had a harder time of it in the second set, he delighted the spectators with a series of spectacular shots which suggested he might be approaching his best form.Rublev meanwhile drops to last place after losing his sixth straight Finals match, although he put up a battle and had two opportunities to win the second set.Alcaraz winning in straight sets meant that Ruud would have reached the semi-finals with a match to spare if he had beaten two-time Finals champion Alexander Zverev in the day's late match.However, Zverev put on a punishing display to prevail in straight sets 7-6 (7/3), 6-3 and all-but ensure a spot in the last four with his second win from as many matches.Zverev took charge of the match in the tie-break at the end of a first set, which before then had gone entirely with serve, and the pair exchanged blows until the German broke in game eight of the second set and then served to love to win the match.""I think it was a very good match actually from both of us,"" said Zverev on court.""I'm happy to win today but it was very, very close. One or two points decided the first set and I thought the level was very high from both of us.""Leader Zverev can eliminate Alcaraz in his final match of the group stage on Friday, when Ruud takes on Rublev.On Thursday, world number one Jannik Sinner will reach the last four if he claims a single set against Daniil Medvedev , and will top the Ilie Nastase Group with a third straight win.","Carlos Alcaraz beats Andrey Rublev 6-3, 7-6 (10/8) at ATP Finals.

Spain's Carlos Alcaraz shrugged off respiratory troubles to reignite his ATP Finals campaign with a decisive win over Russia's Andrey Rublev on Wednesday.Despite being under the weather and sporting pink nasal tape for better breathing, the four-time Grand Slam winner triumphed with a 6-3, 7-6(8) scoreline. Alcaraz, seeded third, appeared much sharper compared to his previous group-stage defeat to Norway's Casper Ruud .After splitting the first six games, Alcaraz broke Rublev’s serve with a blazing forehand and quickly secured five consecutive games to take control. Though Rublev, ranked world number eight, fought back in the second set and came close to securing break points at 2-2, he missed a routine ball after a drop shot attempt.The thrilling match concluded with Alcaraz saving two set points in the tiebreak before claiming victory. Rublev has now suffered six consecutive straight-set losses at the ATP Finals since reaching the semifinals in 2022.Ruud is set to face world number two Alexander Zverev later on Wednesday, with both players aiming for their second win.","Carlos Alcaraz beats Andrey Rublev 6-3, 7-6(8) at ATP Finals.

ATP Finals: Jannik Sinner outshines Taylor Fritz at home; Daniil Medvedev finds form against Alex de Minaur,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/atp-finals-jannik-sinner-outshines-taylor-fritz-at-home-daniil-medvedev-finds-form-against-alex-de-minaur/articleshow/115236180.cms,"Italy's Jannik Sinner reacts during the singles tennis match of the ATP World Tour Finals against United States' Taylor Fritz (AP Photo)

The football-like “Ole” chants. The vast array of fans dressed in his theme colour of orange. The banners and signs — one of which declared, “Sinner for president.”Late in the second set of his victory over Taylor Fritz at the ATP Finals on Tuesday, Jannik Sinner used all the adulation in his home country to his advantage.When the top-ranked player produced a backhand passing shot up the line while on the run, he held his finger up to his ear to encourage the crowd to cheer louder.“I read a little bit where he was playing and I just tried to pass him somehow because if not, it would have been a very easy volley for him,” Sinner said. “The crowd is helping me a lot. This is a very special occasion for me.“I’ve always liked playing at home. If you like the fans and the people supporting you, it’s a big help,” Sinner added.Sinner made it two wins in two matches before his home fans at the finals, beating Fritz 6-4, 6-4 in a rematch of the U.S. Open final that the Italian also won in straight sets.Sinner turned up his intensity when it mattered most. He survived a marathon service game midway through the first set then broke his American opponent with a huge forehand up the line on his first set point.During and after the match, the crowd inside Inalpi arena chanted, “Ole, Ole, Ole; Sin-ner, Sin-ner.”Sinner saved the only break point that he faced and nearly matched Fritz with six aces to the American’s seven.But Fritz tested Sinner over two close sets and thought his performance was a step up from the U.S. Open final.“There’s a lot of positives I can take out of it,” Fritz said. “For all of the match, I didn’t feel overwhelmed. I felt like I was right there.”Sinner, who beat Alex de Minaur in his opening match at the season-ending event for the top eight players, improved to 23-1 in his last five tournaments.Earlier, Daniil Medvedev moved back into contention with a 6-2, 6-4 victory over De Minaur following a temper tantrum in his previous match.Medvedev didn’t face a single break point and was generally much sharper than in his straight-set loss to Fritz on Sunday — during which he smashed his racket and lost his cool twice.Sinner leads the group while Fritz and Medvedev are next with one win each.De Minaur, who is making his debut at finals, lost both of his opening matches.The top two finishers from each round-robin group advance to the semifinals.On Thursday, Medvedev faces Sinner and De Minaur plays Fritz in the final matches of the group.In the other group on Monday, Alexander Zverev and Casper Ruud beat Andrey Rublev and Carlos Alcaraz, respectively.Sinner is playing at home for the first time since it was announced before his U.S. Open title that he tested positive in two separate drug tests this year.A decision to clear Sinner of wrongdoing was appealed by the World Anti-Doping Agency in September. A final ruling in the case is expected early next year.Medvedev had to ‘block the noise’ after temper tantrumWhen his match was over, Medvedev closed his eyes and held his fingers to his ears. Then he wrote on a camera lens, “Block the noise.”“I went into this match also blocking the noise even from myself,” Medvedev said. “No like tantrums and stuff. Just block the noise. And I really didn’t care what was happening on the court. I just tried to play and it was a good feeling.""Medvedev won the finals in 2020 — the last edition held in London.“The more popular you become, the more fans you get, the more haters you get, the more attention you get. And sometimes even the good noise can make you off balance,” Medvedev said.“You know, you win everything and everyone thinks you’re a god. ... Then you lose two matches and everyone is like, ‘Finished, your career is finished.’ So sometimes it’s good just (to) block it,” Medvedev added.",Jannik Sinner beats Taylor Fritz in straight sets at ATP World Tour Finals.

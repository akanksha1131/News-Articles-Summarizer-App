Nitish Rana hails Starc: haven’t seen death bowling like this in a long time

Australia’s T20 squad for the New Zealand series:

Australian fast bowler Mitchell Starc has called time on his T20 International career, choosing to focus on Test and ODI cricket. The left-armer, who played 65 T20Is and picked up 79 wickets, finishes as Australia’s second-highest wicket-taker in the format behind Adam Zampa Starc said Test cricket remains his greatest priority. “I have loved every minute of every T20 game I have played for Australia, particularly the 2021 World Cup, not just because we won but for the incredible group and the fun along the way,” he reflected. “Looking ahead to an away Indian Test tour, the Ashes and an ODI World Cup in 2027, I feel this is my best way forward to stay fresh, fit and at my best for those campaigns. ”He also added that his decision would give Australia’s bowling group enough time to prepare for the T20 World Cup next year.Chair of selectors George Bailey praised Starc for his impact. “Mitch should be incredibly proud of his T20 career. He was an integral part of the 2021 World Cup winning side and had a great skill for breaking games open with his wicket-taking ability.”Cricket Australia CEO Todd Greenberg supported Starc’s decision.“It’s important to Mitch at this stage of his career to make choices that allow him to extend his Test and ODI journeys. Allowing the next group of fast bowlers a clear path to the T20 World Cup is another example of him putting the team first.” Mitchell Marsh (c), Sean Abbott, Xavier Bartlett, Tim David, Ben Dwarshuis, Josh Hazlewood, Travis Head, Josh Inglis, Matt Kuhnemann, Glenn Maxwell, Mitchell Owen, Matthew Short, Marcus Stoinis and Adam Zampa. Pat Cummins will sit out the series due to ongoing lower back pain. Medical scans revealed lumbar bone stress, ruling him out of the upcoming white-ball matches against India.

Former Indian cricket team opener Gautam Gambhir was honoured for his memorable contributions to cricket during the Delhi Premier League (DPL) 2025 final at the Arun Jaitley Stadium. The final saw West Delhi Lions defeat Central Delhi Kings by six wickets under Nitish Rana 's leadership, but Gambhir’s presence added a nostalgic touch for fans.During the final, Gambhir participated in a fun segment where he was asked to tag cricketers, from young talents to veterans, with descriptive words. He associated “clutch” with Sachin Tendulkar and called Virat Kohli a “desi boy” due to their shared Delhi connection.When presented with the word “speed,” Gambhir picked Jasprit Bumrah. He referred to Nitish Rana as “golden arm” and named Shubman Gill as the “most stylish player.” Rahul Dravid was described as “Mr. Consistent,” VVS Laxman as “run machine,” and Zaheer Khan as “death over specialist.” For wicketkeeper-batsman Rishabh Pant , Gambhir used the tag “most funny,” reflecting his light-hearted personality.As India’s head coach, Gambhir will soon resume his national duties. Following the England Test series, the team will regroup for the T20 Asia Cup 2025 in the UAE. India are scheduled to open their campaign on September 10 against the hosts and will face Pakistan on September 14 at the Dubai cricket ground, in what promises to be one of the biggest clashes of the year.On the field, West Delhi Lions lifted the trophy with a six-wicket win over Central Delhi Kings.Rana was the star of the night with an unbeaten 79, guiding his side to chase down 174. Despite early strikes from Simarjeet Singh and Arun Pundir reducing the Lions to 48/3, Rana built crucial partnerships with Mayank Gusain and later Hrithik Shokeen. Shokeen’s 42* off 27 balls ensured the chase was completed smoothly.Central Delhi Kings had earlier recovered from 78/6 to post 173/7, courtesy of a seventh-wicket rescue act from Yugal Saini (65) and Pranshu Vijayran (50*). For the Lions, Manan Bhardwaj (2/11) and Shivank Vashisht (2/12) kept things tight with the ball.Rana’s consistency stood out across the playoffs, with scores of 134* in the Eliminator, 45* in Qualifier 2, and 79* in the Final. His captaincy and form proved decisive in West Delhi Lions’ title-winning campaign.","Gautam Gambhir was honoured during the Delhi Premier League (DPL) 2025 final.

'Everyone played a part': Captain Rashid Khan as MI Cape Town clinch maiden SA20 title

Poll How do you rate Afghanistan's chances of winning the tri-series tournament? High Moderate Low

Afghanistan's star spinner Rashid Khan achieved a historic milestone by becoming the leading wicket-taker in T20 internationals as he guided his team to a 38-run victory over the United Arab Emirates in Sharjah on Monday. The 26-year-old claimed figures of 3/21, helping restrict UAE to 150/8 in their chase of 189, while surpassing New Zealand's Tim Southee 's record of 164 T20I wickets.Afghanistan posted a competitive total of 188/4 after being put in to bat, with Ibrahim Zadran scoring a quick-fire 63 off 40 balls and Sediqullah Atal contributing his maiden T20I fifty with 54 runs from 40 deliveries. The pair established a crucial 84-run partnership for the second wicket.UAE captain Muhammad Waseem provided early resistance in the chase with an aggressive 67 off 37 balls, including six sixes and four boundaries, marking his 23rd T20I half-century. However, his dismissal triggered a collapse in the UAE innings.Rashid Khan's record-breaking performance came as he dismissed Ethan D'Souza (12), Asif Khan (1), and Dhruv Parashar (1) in quick succession. His three-wicket haul took his career tally to 165 wickets in 98 T20Is, overtaking Southee's previous record of 164 wickets in 126 matches.The Afghan innings was further bolstered by Karim Janat's explosive cameo of 23 not out from 10 balls, featuring two sixes and two boundaries. Azmatullah Omarzai also remained unbeaten with a quick 20 off 12 deliveries, including two maximums.UAE's bowling effort was led by Muhammad Rohid and Saghir Khan, who picked up two wickets each, but failed to contain the Afghan batsmen who maintained a healthy scoring rate throughout their innings.The match was part of a tri-series involving Afghanistan, UAE, and Pakistan. Pakistan has already secured two victories in the tournament and will face Afghanistan in their next encounter on Tuesday.The tournament format involves each team playing against each other twice, with the top two teams qualifying for the final scheduled for September 7. This victory has strengthened Afghanistan's position in the series after their earlier loss to Pakistan.Zadran's innings was particularly impactful, containing four sixes and three boundaries, while Atal's maiden T20I half-century was decorated with four boundaries and three sixes, providing Afghanistan with a strong foundation.","Rashid Khan becomes leading wicket-taker in T20 internationals.

Poll Do you think Alexander Isak's transfer fee is justified based on his performance? Yes, he deserves it. No, it's too much.

Alexander Isak has completed a record-breaking transfer to Liverpool from Newcastle United for 125 million pounds ($170 million), becoming the most expensive player in British soccer history. The 25-year-old Swedish striker's move on Monday concluded after a contentious period where he publicly expressed dissatisfaction with Newcastle and trained separately from the squad.The transfer fee surpassed Liverpool's previous British record of 116 million pounds paid for Florian Wirtz in July, and Chelsea's 115 million pounds acquisition of Moises Caicedo in August 2023.Isak, who scored 23 Premier League goals last season, had missed Newcastle's first three matches of the season while pursuing the move to Liverpool.""It's been a long journey to get here,"" Isak said. ""But I'm super happy to be a part of this team, this club and everything it stands for. It's something I'm proud of and I'm really looking forward to it. I'm just happy it's done and that I can get back to work. I'm looking forward to seeing my teammates and the fans, and getting back out there.""Liverpool had initially bid 110 million pounds for Isak during the offseason before returning with their successful offer.The transfer makes Isak the fourth most expensive player globally, following Neymar's $262 million move to Paris Saint-Germain, Kylian Mbappé's $216 million PSG transfer, and Philippe Coutinho's $192 million Barcelona deal.Isak, born in Stockholm to Eritrean parents, had joined Newcastle from Real Sociedad in 2022 and quickly established himself as one of the world's premier strikers.The transfer followed a public dispute between Isak and Newcastle, with the player claiming broken promises in an Instagram post and stating that ""trust is lost"" with the club.Newcastle responded by denying any commitment to selling Isak and suggested Liverpool's initial offer was insufficient.The Saudi-controlled Newcastle has responded to Isak's departure by signing two strikers: Nick Woltemade from Stuttgart and Yoane Wissa from Brentford.Liverpool's acquisition of Isak is part of their $570 million summer spending spree, following their record-tying 20th top-flight English title victory.The club's other significant signings include Florian Wirtz for 116 million pounds, Hugo Ekitike, and fullbacks Jeremie Frimpong and Milos Kerkez.Liverpool has offset this spending by selling players including Luis Diaz, Darwin Nunez, and Jarell Quansah.The extensive squad overhaul comes under manager Arne Slot, who took over from Jurgen Klopp and remained quiet during the previous season before implementing significant changes.Newcastle acknowledged Isak's departure with a brief 37-word statement confirming the British-record fee received for the striker.The negotiations concluded in the final hours of the summer transfer window, with Isak joining Liverpool on what the club described as a ""long-term contract.""",Alexander Isak has completed a record-breaking transfer to Liverpool from Newcastle United.

Poll Do you think the release of the 'Slapgate' footage was necessary? Yes, it's important for transparency No, it reopens old wounds

Seventeen years after the infamous “Slapgate” incident from the inaugural IPL season, former India wicketkeeper and match referee for that game, Farokh Engineer , has voiced his surprise at the sudden release of footage from the altercation.The 2008 contest between Mumbai Indians and Kings XI Punjab is remembered for Harbhajan Singh slapping S Sreesanth during post-match interactions. Harbhajan, who was captaining MI that night, was banned for the remainder of the season after being pulled away from the scene by teammates. Sreesanth, playing for KXIP, had contributed two wickets in his side’s 66-run win.Recently, former IPL commissioner Lalit Modi shared the official video of the incident while speaking on Michael Clarke’s podcast, bringing the controversy back into focus.Engineer, who was in charge of proceedings as match referee that evening, said he was taken aback by the development. “I’m surprised that the footage has emerged after all these years. As match referee for that particular match, I maintained confidentiality throughout and didn’t speak about the contents of the incident even to the best of my friends in the media,” he told Mid-Day.Reflecting further, he added that the matter should be left in the past.“I had a job to do as match referee and I believe I did it (well) with dignified silence. It’s a thing of the past and I’m sure both players have long buried their differences. Like many other things in cricket, it was done in the heat of the moment. Harbhajan is a good friend. We move on.”The resurfacing of the clip has already stirred reactions, with Sreesanth’s wife calling it an unnecessary reopening of old wounds.

Goud to Continue with India U-19

The Dr (Capt.) K Thimmappaiah Memorial tournament, a premier four-day red-ball competition starting Thursday, will mark the beginning of Karnataka’s preparations for the domestic season.The tournament has attracted the cream of Indian talent, with powerhouses such as Mumbai, Baroda, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, and Vidarbha among the 16 participating teams. Karnataka has four teams in the fray.Held across Bengaluru and Mysuru, the tournament assumes added significance as performances here will form the basis for selecting the probables for Karnataka’s Ranji Trophy squad. The Ranji Trophy championship begins next month.While most other teams have already featured in similar tournaments, such as the Buchi Babu Invitational in Tamil Nadu, and have accumulated valuable game-time in the format, Karnataka has yet to begin training.The delay comes amid ongoing administrative challenges in the state’s cricket setup. The Karnataka State Cricket Association (KSCA) only announced its teams on Monday, with training set to start on Tuesday, just two days before the opening fixtures.Much of the disruption stems from the hurried organisation of the Maharaja Trophy T20 tournament. Held behind closed doors in Mysuru after Bengaluru city police denied permission at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium due to safety concerns, the tournament ran from August 11 to 28. Players had little time to recover and adapt to the red-ball format.The timing of the T20 tournament has left its mark, with several players carrying injuries. Power-hitter Abhinav Manohar, pacer Manvanth Kumar, all-rounder Shubhang Hegde, and left-arm spinner Paras Gurbax Arya are among those sidelined due to injuries sustained in Mysuru. Karun Nair, returning to Karnataka after stints with Vidarbha, will be unavailable until September 19. KSCA XI will also miss pacer Prasidh Krishna, who remains on standby for the Asia Cup.Although the KSCA four-day matches began in June, selectors have not been officially announced. Anand Katti is reportedly the chairperson of the senior panel, with C Raghu, Amit Verma, and Tejpal Kothari as colleagues. They have been regularly seen at league matches, including the Maharaja Trophy, but no formal communication has been made regarding their appointments or the constitution of other men’s and women’s committees.Yere Goud is expected to continue as head coach. However, he will temporarily be unavailable for the senior team as he is currently with the India U-19 squad touring Australia from September to October. Goud is expected to join the state team just before the start of the Ranji Trophy on October 15.In his absence, it is likely that bowling coach Mansur Ali Khan will continue to oversee training during the Thimmappaiah tournament, maintaining continuity for the players ahead of the domestic season.","The Dr (Capt.)

Poll Do you think Cheteshwar Pujara should have retired earlier? Yes No

Former India batter Robin Uthappa has shared his thoughts on Cheteshwar Pujara ’s retirement, suggesting that the veteran batter may have delayed the decision. Uthappa believes Pujara should have called time on his career earlier, particularly after being left out of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy squad in 2024.Speaking on YouTube, Uthappa said, “I think he overextended his stay a little bit. I think it was communicated to him that he will not be considered anymore and this England tour was the final straw. It seemed very bleak for Indian cricket to go back to him, Rahane, at the start of a new cycle. I reckoned when he didn’t get picked in that Australia tour, he could have called it time. But obviously, it is very hard.”Pujara, one of India’s greatest Test specialists, retired recently after being overlooked for the England Tests and excluded from the Duleep Trophy. He ended his international career with 7195 runs from 103 matches, but had not featured for India since 2023.Uthappa, while critical of the timing, also praised Pujara’s determination and shared a fond memory from domestic cricket. He recalled a Ranji Trophy match between Karnataka and Saurashtra in 2009-10 when Pujara scored a triple century. “He was batting on 200 at stumps. I went early next morning for practice and he was already there at 7:30, having scored a double hundred the previous day. That showed his obsession with batting and his hunger to be not out,” Uthappa said.For Uthappa, Pujara’s legacy is clear.

NEW DELHI: Kieron Pollard continues to prove that age is just a number. At 38, the Trinbago Knight Riders powerhouse once again reminded fans why he is regarded as one of the most destructive T20 batters of all time. In the Caribbean Premier League clash against St Kitts and Nevis Patriots, Pollard produced a jaw-dropping exhibition of power-hitting that left both fans and opposition bowlers stunned.Walking in with his team looking for momentum, Pollard initially took his time to settle.After 13 balls, he had managed just 12 runs – an uncharacteristic start for the big-hitting veteran. But what followed was absolute mayhem.Pollard suddenly switched gears, launching an astonishing assault on the bowlers.He smashed seven sixes in the space of eight deliveries, clearing the boundary with effortless ease. In his final 16 balls, he plundered 53 runs at a staggering strike rate of 331.25.His overall innings read 65 runs off just 29 balls, laced with eight sixes and two fours. The highlight of his knock came in the last eight balls he faced: 6, 6, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6 — pure carnage, as Pollard turned the match into a one-man spectacle.For the opposition, it was a nightmare.

BENGALURU: An U-19 World Cup win as captain? Tick. A century on debut in the Ranji Trophy and Duleep Trophy? Tick. Before Yash Dhull was out of his teens, he had taken the cricketing world by storm and promised more. But in June last year, he felt like the world he was painstakingly building had started crumbling.A 17mm hole in his heart needed surgery, but with the domestic season ahead, he was unwilling. The doctors gave him no option but to go under the knife and a one-month recovery period followed, during which time he was advised bed rest.A couple of months later, when he began playing again, he found the going tough with bouts of fatigue and high blood pressure.Dhull has no option but to slow down, reflect and reboot.During this time, he found his calling in snooker, which he started playing regularly.Dhull, who scored a well-crafted century (133) for North Zone against East Zone in the Duleep Trophy last week, revealed how picking up the cue was one of the best things he did during that low phase.“I spent a lot of time playing snooker. That game also taught me a lot. My mind often wandered around; I wasn't concentrating much.It was during that time that snooker taught me to stay more focused,” he explained.The illness also taught Dhull some life lessons, which he feels will hold him in good stead.“That period taught me a lot about myself, my game and lifestyle. I also learnt how to grow and improve.”The 22-year-old felt the experience was also humbling. “That phase taught me how to handle situations. There will be ups and downs.

And I am taking it day by day. I just want to stay in the present. I don't want to think about the past or future. I want to grab the opportunities I have and enjoy them,” he said.","Yash Dhull scored a century on debut in the Ranji Trophy and Duleep Trophy.

NEW DELHI: Team India’s ODI captain Rohit Sharma is once again in the spotlight, this time for his fitness test. Recently, a light-hearted video featuring him has gone viral on social media, showing the senior cricketer sharing a laugh with team physiotherapist Amit Dubey. The clip, which quickly grabbed the attention of fans, was filmed at the Mumbai International Airport when Rohit returned from Bengaluru after his fitness assessment.In the video, Rohit can be seen joking with Dubey, saying, “Ajao chhod deta hu tumko (Come on, I’ll drop you off).”The moment, captured in a relaxed setting, highlighted a lighter side of the cricketer, leaving fans delighted.Along with Rohit, pacer Jasprit Bumrah and opener Shubman Gill also underwent their fitness tests in Bengaluru, ensuring that the team’s key players are in top condition ahead of the busy international schedule.Rohit, now 38, last featured in a competitive match for Mumbai Indians during the IPL 2025 clash against Punjab Kings in Ahmedabad, where he managed just eight runs.His most recent international outing came in the Champions Trophy final against New Zealand on March 9 in Dubai, where he played a match-winning knock of 76 off 83 balls, earning the Player of the Match award as India lifted the trophy.The veteran opener has already called time on his Test career, announcing his retirement on May 7, but continues to be a crucial figure in India’s white-ball setup.Looking ahead, Rohit and fellow stalwart Virat Kohli are likely to feature for India A in a three-match One-Day series against Australia A at Green Park, Kanpur, on September 30, October 3, and October 5.

NEW DELHI: The devastating floods in several parts of India have claimed many lives so far and left thousands displaced. Considered among the worst flood disasters to hit the country in decades, the situation has been aggravated by relentless rainfall across several states, submerging homes, farmlands and infrastructure. Rescue operations are underway, but the scale of destruction has been heartbreaking.Amid this grim scenario, former India all-rounder Yuvraj Singh shared an emotional message on social media, expressing solidarity with those affected.""Watching the devastation of these floods has been deeply painful. Families have lost loved ones, homes & hope and my heart goes out to each one of them. Please know you are not alone, we stand with you and I will do everything I can to support those affected. Together, we will rebuild lives and bring back hope. Waheguru ji Mehr kari,"" Yuvraj wrote.Yuvraj, one of India’s most celebrated match-winners, enjoyed a glittering career across formats. In Test cricket, he played 40 matches, amassing 1,900 runs at an average of 33.92. He notched up three centuries and 11 fifties, with a career-best score of 169. Although he could not cement his place in the longest format, his elegant stroke play often stood out in crucial moments.It was, however, in ODIs that Yuvraj truly became a giant of Indian cricket. In 304 matches, he piled up 8,701 runs at 36.55, including 14 centuries and 52 fifties. Known for his ability to shift momentum single-handedly, his strike rate of 87.67, complemented by 908 fours and 155 sixes, reflects his aggressive style. He was also an excellent fielder, taking 94 catches. His crowning moment came during the 2011 World Cup, where he was named Player of the Tournament as India lifted the trophy after 28 years.In T20 internationals, Yuvraj continued to leave a mark. He scored 1,177 runs in 58 games at a strike rate of 136.38, including eight half-centuries. His six consecutive sixes against Stuart Broad in the 2007 T20 World Cup remain etched in cricketing history.","Yuvraj Singh has posted an emotional message on social media.

Former South Africa captain AB de Villiers has opened up about his long stint with Royal Challengers Bengaluru, reflecting on the bond he built with the franchise and his memorable association with Virat Kohli.De Villiers, who represented RCB for 11 seasons, became one of the cornerstones of the side alongside the likes of Kohli and Chris Gayle. Despite his best efforts, an IPL title eluded him during his playing years, with the franchise lifting its maiden crown only in 2025, after his retirement.Speaking on the Beard Before Wicket podcast, de Villiers explained how he instantly felt at home after moving to RCB from Delhi.""I don't know what it is. I think I just—I was accepted and backed. I didn't feel that way at Delhi (Daredevils) in the first three years, in and out of the side. No one's fault, I hadn't proven myself at that time yet. So it was completely normal for the coach to sort of jump, make me play around and in and out,"" he recalled.""But I think I arrived at RCB and I was told, 'You're going to play. You're one of our main dudes here. We don't care what's happened in the past.You're our main guy.' And like, okay, cool. And that sort of immediately… players are insecure, you know. We feel insecure sometimes, we want to feel like we're backed. And I think that's the main thing—I felt backed. Beautiful city obviously, great stadium, nice field to play on as a batter more often than not. So I just—I mean, it just fitted, just worked from the start.""The South African also reflected on his prolific partnership with Kohli, with whom he shares two record-breaking stands in the IPL.""We played the game in a similar way. We are very busy at the crease, run hard, really look to get behind what the bowlers are trying to do, and find a way to attack the bowlers,"" he said.Recalling their highest moments together, he added: ""There were two partnerships with him, one at the Wankhede and one at the Chinnaswamy, both were day games. Both of us were in the form of our lives. That always helps. I just love batting with him. He is very competitive like me, and we love taking bowlers down.

Erik Ten Hag’s stint as Bayer Leverkusen manager has come to an abrupt end, with the Bundesliga champions dismissing him after just two league games in charge. The Dutchman, who succeeded Xabi Alonso following his move to Real Madrid, departs less than two months into the job.“This decision was not easy for us. Nobody wanted to take this step,” sporting director Simon Rolfes said in a statement. He added, “The past few weeks have shown that the steps to build a new and successful team have not been effective.”Club CEO Fernando Carro admitted the move was tough but unavoidable. “The decision was painful, but necessary,” he said, as quoted by AFP.The dismissal makes Ten Hag, 55, the coach to be fired the earliest in a Bundesliga season, surpassing the previous mark of five matches.Ten Hag, appointed on July 1, oversaw just three games in total. After a routine 4-0 German Cup win over Sonnenhof Grossaspach, Leverkusen struggled in the league. They lost 2-1 at home to Hoffenheim after leading early and then squandered a two-goal cushion against ten-man Werder Bremen to draw 3-3. His first outing, a friendly against Flamengo’s under-20 side in Brazil, had ended in a 5-1 defeat.Leverkusen had entered the season amid major upheaval, with several key players from last year’s double-winning squad departing, including Florian Wirtz, Granit Xhaka and Jonathan Tah.The club invested heavily in replacements, with summer signings Malik Tilmann, Jarell Quansah and Eliesse Ben Seghir arriving for over €100 million combined.Despite the backing, results failed to materialize, prompting Leverkusen to act swiftly.

The Leagues Cup final between Seattle Sounders and Inter Miami ended in ugly scenes on Sunday, with Luis Suárez appearing to spit at an opposition staff member during post-match confrontations.Moments after Seattle’s 3-0 victory at Lumen Field, the Uruguayan striker confronted 20-year-old midfielder Obed Vargas and locked him in a headlock, sparking a scuffle that quickly escalated to involve players and staff from both teams. Match officials moved in to break up the fracas, but broadcast cameras appeared to capture Suárez spitting in the direction of a Seattle staff member as tensions boiled over.Inter Miami head coach Javier Mascherano admitted he could not comment directly, saying he was too far away to witness events in detail. “Nobody likes these kinds of actions at the end of a match, but if there’s a reaction, maybe there was provocation,” he told reporters.The trophy ceremony was delayed as tempers simmered, though both sides eventually came together on the pitch. Seattle head coach Brian Schmetzer, however, chose to steer the focus back to his side’s performance. “Unfortunately that is going to take some of the attention away from a great performance by the Seattle Sounders,” he said, as quoted by AFP.He added: “I guess we can take that as a compliment that Miami’s frustrations led to some things happening on the field that shouldn’t happen on the field. I’m going to shut that down because that shouldn’t be the story.”Schmetzer also revealed he shared a quiet exchange with Lionel Messi after the match, saying it was a respectful moment amid the chaos.Despite that, Suárez, 38, is likely to face further scrutiny, with the incident adding to an already controversial career marked by several high-profile disciplinary cases.

Poll Did Messi's miss cost Inter Miami the Leagues Cup? Yes No, it was a team loss

The Seattle Sounders delivered a commanding performance to defeat Lionel Messi ’s Inter Miami 3-0 in the Leagues Cup final on Sunday, completing their sweep of major North American trophies before a record crowd at Lumen Field.Osaze De Rosario opened the scoring in the 26th minute with a header from an Alex Roldan cross, sending the 69,314 fans into pandemonium. Roldan himself converted a penalty late in the second half, before Paul Rothrock sealed the victory in the 89th minute to spark celebrations.Seattle’s disciplined back line frustrated Miami’s star-studded attack throughout the contest. Messi saw an early header denied by Jackson Ragen, while another effort sailed over the bar after Luis Suárez created space for him early in the second half. The miss from close range shocked many given the fact that the Argentine is one of the deadliest finishers in the game from near. Miami’s best chance came in the 60th minute when Tadeo Allende missed wide from close range.Despite Miami’s pressure, the Sounders held firm. Ragen, Vargas and García combined to block repeated attempts, while goalkeeper Oscar Ustari was called into action on several occasions to deny further damage.The game reached a flashpoint when Yannik Bright’s challenge on substitute Georgi Minoungou earned Seattle a penalty in the 84th minute. Roldan calmly converted to double the advantage. Moments later, Rothrock’s angled finish completed the upset.The result extended Seattle’s trophy cabinet to include every major title available to an MLS club: two MLS Cups, a Supporters’ Shield, four US Open Cups, a CONCACAF Champions Cup and now the Leagues Cup. Their triumph came despite Miami boasting nearly triple the player wage bill, with the Sounders’ $16.7 million payroll dwarfed by Miami’s $46.8m.It was also a night of records in the stands, as the attendance figure set a new high for a Leagues Cup match and a new mark for any Sounders fixture at Lumen Field.The victory not only secured Seattle the Leagues Cup but also guaranteed direct entry into the round of 16 of the 2026 CONCACAF Champions Cup. Both finalists had already earned qualification for that competition, which will serve as the pathway to the 2029 FIFA Club World Cup.More surprisingly, it was the timing of Inter Miami's final defeat, which came just a week following Cristiano Ronaldo and Al-Nassr's loss on penalties to Al-Ahli in the Saudi Super Cup final.","Seattle Sounders beat Inter Miami 3-0 in the Leagues Cup final on Sunday.

Goalkeeper Joan García was forced into five major saves, including two one-on-one stops, keeping his side in front until Fran Pérez equalised with a volley from a corner in the 67th minute.Coach Hansi Flick admitted his team struggled to control the contest: “We have to control the ball better. We have to be happy with the point. Joan García played a fantastic match today.”The absence of VAR dominated the post-match discussion.

Poll Do you think Alexander Isak will be a good fit for Liverpool? Yes, definitely! No, not really.

Liverpool are closing in on the signing of Alexander Isak from Newcastle United in a deal set to break the British transfer record, according to multiple reports on Monday.The Premier League champions have agreed a fee of around £130 million ($176m) for the Swedish striker, surpassing the £106m Chelsea paid Benfica for Enzo Fernandez in 2023. The Athletic reported that the 25-year-old will undergo his medical on Monday before sealing a six-year contract at Anfield.Fabrizio Romano broke the news on X, confirming that the deal was agreed for a record £130m transfer fee.Isak enjoyed a prolific season for Newcastle last year, finishing with 23 Premier League goals, which was second only to Mohamed Salah. However, his future became the subject of a drawn-out saga this summer after making clear his desire to move to Merseyside, leading him to train separately from the rest of Eddie Howe’s squad.Newcastle had earlier rejected a £110m bid but were eventually persuaded after signing German forward Nick Woltemade on Saturday for what was also a club-record fee, believed to be up to £69m. Howe hinted last week that the sale of Isak could help ease the club’s Profit and Sustainability Regulations concerns, admitting the financial impact of such a deal could not be ignored.Liverpool’s capture of Isak follows a string of high-profile summer arrivals, including German midfielder Florian Wirtz, French attacker Hugo Ekitike, Dutch defender Jeremie Frimpong and left-back Milos Kerkez.Despite not yet hitting their free-flowing best, the Reds have made a perfect start to their title defence with three wins from three, including Sunday’s 1-0 victory over Arsenal.

How the three World Champions fared in Formula E Season 11

Days after Oliver Rowland lifted his Formula E World Championship trophy in London this season, an interesting trend has come to the attention of Formula E and its fans. As a coincidence, all Formula E drivers who won the Mexico City E-Prix went on to win the Formula E World Championship that season, and this has been proved right for three consecutive years.Highlighting the same since 2023, a poster of three World Champions was shared on X by Formula E with the caption, “The trend continues. Each winner of the #MexicoCityEPrix from the past three seasons has gone on to become World Champion.”The special poster features 2023 Formula E World Champion Jake Dennis from Andretti, then TAG Heuer Porsche’s Pascal Wehrlein, who won in 2024, and the new World Champion, Nissan driver Oliver Rowland. All three of them won in the Mexico E-Prix and went on to lift the winner’s trophy in the Formula E World Championship that year.Oliver Rowland had strengthened his chances of winning the Formula E World Championship this year much earlier. He was leading the Formula E Driver Standings ever since he won Part 2 of the Jeddah E-Prix, which was his second win of the season after winning the Mexico E-Prix. In the last leg, the Nissan driver got nervous for a while as Pascal Wehrlein, who was following him in the number two position, closed the gap after grabbing quite a few podiums while Rowland had a dull period.Things became serious for Rowland when he failed to finish the Round 13 race in Berlin, while Wehrlein won second spot on the podium. But he eventually managed to confirm his championship in Berlin after four wins and three more podiums.Sharing about his bad race in Berlin, Rowland had said, “I was hoping before the weekend that the outcome could be [the World Championship], but after yesterday (Saturday) and this morning (Sunday), I was more worried that it might never come.”Also Read: Oliver Rowland reacts to daughter’s sweet radio message after Formula E Championship win: “It’s amazing” Things, however, changed for Wehrlein, who was pushed to third position after Nick Cassidy made a late entry in the Formula E Driver Standings by registering three consecutive wins.

Taylor Barnard on losing top three spot in Formula E World Championship

Fans hail Taylor Barnard for his fantastic rookie season

It was Taylor Barnard’s rookie season this year, and the NEOM McLaren driver put up a fantastic performance by temporarily making it to the top three in the Formula E Driver Standings by ousting the much more experienced Porsche driver Antonio Felix Da Costa. He was, however, ousted from the top three at the London E-Prix as Jaguar’s Nick Cassidy went on to register three consecutive wins. Barnard took to Instagram to share his feelings on losing out on the top three in his first-ever season and his claim to the championship.Taking to Instagram after the London E-Prix, Barnard wrote, “London wasn’t what we hoped for, easily being the toughest weekend of our season. Taking 0 points away as a team from a doubleheader hurts, but one weekend doesn’t define the year we’ve had.”He further wrote, “As the season closes, I want to say a massive thank you to the entire team, both trackside and behind the scenes, for everything this season. Finishing P4 in the Drivers’ Championship and coming into the final weekend with a shot at runner-up is something to be proud of.”Also adding a note for teammate Sam Bird, as NEOM McLaren withdrew from Formula E after the end of the season, Barnard wrote, “@sambird_official it wasn’t the weekend you deserved either.You’ve been a huge part of my season both on and off the track, and I’m grateful for everything.

What’s next in Formula E?

Through the early days, the good days, the bad days, and the great days, we have always felt an overwhelming amount of support from you all.”For the partners associated with the team, he wrote, “They say that ‘racing is a state of mind’, and since its inception, this team has had the privilege of working for organisations, with partners, and racing for fans who fully embrace this philosophy.This is certainly true of those at McLaren, whose passion for racing is second to none.”“My heartfelt thanks go out to everyone who has been involved: those at McLaren who backed us, the fans who supported us, and the partners who allowed us to go racing. We couldn’t have done it without you all — your trust and support have never been taken for granted,” he added.Praising the two McLaren drivers, he wrote, “Sam clinched McLaren’s first-ever fully electric win at the São Paulo E-Prix in Season 10, pulling off one of Formula E’s all-time great overtakes, before being waved across the line by none other than Emerson Fittipaldi – McLaren's first Formula 1 World Champion. While Taylor has been a rookie sensation in Season 11, securing five Formula E records, including the youngest driver to start a race, the youngest points scorer, the youngest driver to lead a lap, the youngest podium finisher, and the youngest polesitter. ”He ended the letter saying, “Some of us have been together since the day we first launched this team, while others have seamlessly fitted in along the way and flourished within the environment we have cultivated. For many, I am sure that we will cross paths again soon, but whatever the future holds for those here at Bicester, whatever path they choose to follow, I have no doubt that it will be bright. Their potential is limitless. ”Reacting to the open letter on Instagram, Taylor Barnard wrote, “It’s been an honour to wear Papaya and represent this team.” Sam Bird also dropped a heart emoji and a hands-joined-in-prayer emoji in the comments section.Also Read: Taylor Barnard looks back at rookie season at McLaren: “Every step has been unforgettable” Neither Taylor Barnard nor Sam Bird has revealed their future course of action in Formula E Season 12.

NEW DELHI: Double Olympic medallist PR Sreejesh emphasised the significance of grassroots investment and talent scouting to enhance India's future in sports.Sreejesh, who retired after contributing to India's consecutive Olympic bronze medal at the Paris Games, highlighted the importance of exposure and mental preparation for athletes aiming for success at the Olympics .""Exposure is the key. Getting into the world level and performing from there is the dream,"" Sreejesh said. ""What makes the Olympics unique is the mental pressure. Preparing athletes to be equipped to perform at that level is most important.""He pointed out the shift in perspective for young athletes, who now have tangible examples of Indian achievements on the global stage, boosting their confidence in their potential for success.""When we started playing, we always heard about the history of the sport. Now, we can realistically show young kids that we can achieve at the global stage. When I work with U21 players at Hockey India , I want them to believe that they too can achieve success,"" he added.Sreejesh identified a gap in talent identification at the grassroots level, advocating for increased investment in young talent, particularly those between the ages of 12-14, to prepare for future Olympic Games, including the 2036 Olympics .""We have room to improve in talent identification. At the nursery level, at grassroots, there's a lot to work on. That's where the investment needs to go in,"" he said. ""If we are speaking about the 2036 Olympics, now is when we need to tap into the talent between the age groups of 12-14 years.""He also stressed the need for a broader sports culture in India , beyond just winning medals, to promote overall health and well-being.""We need to introduce sports culture into our system. That's important, not just to win medals but for overall health and well-being. The younger generation is very focused on medals, which is great, but we also need to build a foundation that sustains their journey in sports,"" he remarked.","Double Olympic medallist PR Sreejesh emphasised the significance of grassroots investment and talent scouting to enhance India's future in sports.

NEW DELHI: Brazilian football superstar Neymar has been ruled out of the upcoming World Cup qualifiers against Colombia and Argentina due to fitness concerns.The Brazilian Football Confederation announced this decision through a video statement by coach Dorival Júnior, who cited unspecified reasons for the exclusion of Neymar, goalkeeper Ederson, and defender Danilo from the squad.The 33-year-old striker, who recently rejoined his former club Santos in January, last played on March 2 but was substituted due to an apparent left thigh injury. As a precautionary measure, he was rested for the Sao Paulo state championship semifinal against Corinthians a few days later.Neymar's absence has paved the way for Real Madrid's promising young striker, Endrick, to be called up to the national team squad. Ederson's replacement is Lyon's Lucas Perri, while Flamengo defender Danilo has been replaced by his club teammate and Brazil veteran, Alex Sandro.Neymar's return to the national team setup this month marked a significant milestone, as he had been absent for almost 1 1/2 years due to an ACL injury sustained in October 2023 while playing for Brazil against Uruguay. His recent recovery and return to action had raised hopes for his participation in the upcoming qualifiers.Brazil, currently fifth in the South American qualifying standings, faces a crucial double-header, hosting Colombia on March 20 before traveling to Buenos Aires to take on the group leaders, Argentina, five days later.The absence of key players like Neymar, Ederson, and Danilo undoubtedly presents a challenge for the Brazilian team. However, it also provides an opportunity for emerging talents like Endrick and others to step up and showcase their abilities on the international stage.","Neymar has been ruled out of the upcoming World Cup qualifiers against Colombia and Argentina due to fitness concerns.

Champions Return: Rohit, Hardik, Shreyas, Gambhir return after India's title triumph

NEW DELHI: Pakistan cricket has once again found itself in the middle of controversy and chaos following its first-round exit from the Champions Trophy 2025 — a tournament they were hosting on home soil after 29 years.The disappointment has not only triggered fan outrage but also exposed deep divisions among past and present coaching figures. Mickey Arthur , who led Pakistan during one of their more successful white-ball phases, was brutally honest in his criticism. Speaking to talkSport, Arthur said, “I love this quote, to be brutally honest. Jason Gillespie is a wonderful coach, wonderful man. Pakistan cricket just continues to shoot itself in the foot. It is its worst enemy.”Arthur believes Pakistan had made the right moves by appointing Jason Gillespie and Gary Kirsten to helm the red-ball and white-ball squads, respectively.However, he expressed regret at the ongoing instability that continues to plague the system. “There are so many good players; they’ve got the resources now; there's so much young talent. They have incredible skill. And yet, it's still so chaotic. It's really disappointing to see.”In a sharp rebuttal to Aaqib Javed’s comments blaming Pakistan’s recent struggles on “too many changes”, Gillespie accused the newly appointed coach of trying to “undermine them” and even called Javed a “clown.”Arthur echoed those concerns, pointing to deeper issues in Pakistan’s cricketing structure. “They had got some really good coaches who could take them forward. But then that machine that works in Pakistan just keeps undermining, and agendas are driven in the media,” he said.ALSO SEE: Jason Gillespie calls Pakistan's Aaqib Javed a 'clown' “It's a jungle out there and I feel desperately sorry for Gary and Jason.

ICC defends protocol as controversy erupts over missing Pakistani representative

India win Champions Trophy title; Rohit Sharma confirms he's not retiring

Former Pakistan wicketkeeper-batter Kamran Akmal has stirred controversy with his blunt remarks regarding the absence of a representative from host nation Pakistan during the prize distribution ceremony of the recently concluded ICC Champions Trophy Akmal asserted that Pakistan did not ""deserve"" to have a representative on stage, citing the team's poor performance and lack of respect on the international stage.""The ICC showed us the mirror,"" Akmal said on his YouTube channel. ""The tournament's director (Sumair) was there. He was available, and why wasn't he in the ceremony? It is because we don't deserve to be there. We are not playing good cricket. Minow teams have shown us the mirror.""He further expressed his disappointment with the current state of Pakistan cricket, adding, ""No one discussed how Pakistan hosted the tournament. If we play such cricket, we will be treated like this. If you play for yourself, there will be no respect.""The controversy erupted when Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chief executive and Champions Trophy tournament director Sumair Ahmad Syed, who was present at the venue in Dubai, was not invited on stage for the final presentation.

NEW DELHI: Carlos Alcaraz , the two-time defending champion, showcased his dominance at the ATP Indian Wells Masters on Wednesday. The world number three from Spain overcame the challenging windy conditions on Stadium Court to deliver a commanding performance against Grigor Dimitrov , defeating him 6-1, 6-1.Alcaraz's victory denied Dimitrov's bid to join Canadian Felix Auger-Aliassime as the only players to beat the Spaniard in three consecutive meetings. The Bulgarian had previously won their last two encounters, including the quarter-finals at the Miami Open last year.With his 50th ATP Masters 1000 match win, Alcaraz kept his hopes alive of joining Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic as the only men to win three consecutive Indian Wells titles.Having reached the fourth round without dropping a set, Alcaraz produced his most impressive performance of the tournament. Despite the swirling winds that caused ball kids to scramble after blowing trash, Alcaraz appeared supremely untroubled.He broke Dimitrov's serve to open the match and secured the first set with another break. Alcaraz didn't face a break point until the fifth game of the second set, but he overcame that challenge with an ace on Dimitrov's third break chance. Alcaraz then broke the Bulgarian's serve to take a 5-1 lead.Alcaraz sealed the victory in style, earning a match point with his sixth ace of the match and clinching the win with a forehand winner.

NEW DELHI: In the quiet, black-and-white corridors of chess , where the ticking clock echoes louder than the heartbeat, Koneru Humpy remains seated like an ancient banyan tree — rooted, rigid, and regal.Behind her stillness stays the tremors of sacrifice as the real championship for India’s top-ranked woman in chess isn't always over 64 squares.""I do miss my daughter a lot,” she tellsduring an exclusive interaction. ""Our tournaments last 15–20 days, and I travel often. She enjoys her stay with grandparents when I am away. So that way I'm fortunate that they're very close to her, and she gets all the attention which is needed.""Humpy, two-time World Rapid Champion, became a chess Grandmaster in 2002 at the age of 15.At that time, she was the youngest woman to achieve the title, making him no stranger to medals or media glare — the most recent one after she was made the brand ambassador for the SOG Grandmaster Series.Life runs at a rapid pace when you are winning, in general. For Humpy, 2014 marked the start of a new journey — her marriage with Anvesh Dasari . A few years later, they were blessed with a baby girl, Ahana.Her commitment toward her child and family kept her away from the game for some time.""I still remember when I won the 2019 World Rapid Championship, I hadn't been playing for nearly one and a half years,"" Humpy says. ""I took a break in 2017 and started playing again around November or December 2018. When I came back to chess, practice and preparation were there, but I had become a much tougher person. You know, raising a child meant sleepless nights. I learned I'm even capable of doing the work without having a proper food. Earlier, that wasn't the case — if something went wrong, it would immediately affect my performance. But motherhood helped me adjust to all of that and made me mentally tougher.""Motherhood, for Humpy, was never a distraction as she continues to wear it not like a weight, but like armor.""I always feel motherhood is a strength. It cannot make you sidestep your profession,"" she accepts with a grin.As a child prodigy from Vijayawada, a small city in Andhra Pradesh, Humpy didn't have grand academies or training partners on call.What she had was a father looking after his child.Back then, it was Humpy's father who would help a budding chess star — someone who rarely showed interest in poring over dense books filled with opening theories or classic moves — as she prepared for upcoming tournaments.""I'm not a book reader at all. I'd love to read on a laptop or a tab, but not in books,"" she laughs. ""During my childhood, my dad used to do all the preparation — he would get those books, have them copied, and make separate bindings with the lines to play and all that. I was never into that kind of work. It was only after 2012 that I started preparing on my own. But by then, we were already used to laptops and software.""In a society that often romanticises maternal sacrifice into silence, here is a mother, who continues to redefine ambition, by not choosing between motherhood and mastery.As for her daughter, there is no checkmate path mapped out.""I never want to pressurise her,"" Humpy tells. ""For me, it's about letting her do what she enjoys, whatever profession she wants to pursue — it's fine. I just want her to grow up as a positive person. That's more important to me than which profession she chooses.""In a country now experiencing a chess renaissance, Koneru Humpy remains an epitome of calmness. ""As for staying calm under pressure, I think it comes naturally to me. Even as a child, I was like that. People often say they couldn't tell whether I won or lost a game because I always maintained the same calm,"" she adds.Behind her calm demeanour lies a strict routine: ""sleep early, wake up early, and that helps me stay composed and well-prepared"".""During tournaments, I prefer going for walks to get fresh air since we spend most of our time indoors. When I'm at home, I make sure to go to the gym every day to maintain physical fitness. Yoga is great, of course, but I personally enjoy more physical activity, especially because we sit for long hours while playing,"" she continues.The 37-year-old GM readies her bid for the Women's Grand Prix in Pune (April 13-24), Norway Chess (May 26-June 6), then the World Cup (July 5-29) in Georgia.""I think I definitely need to change my strategy for the World Cup because it's a knockout tournament. But I'll focus on that after I complete these two classical events—Norway Chess and the Grand Prix. Probably after Norway, I'll start preparing specifically for the knockout format. Yes, I need to do something different for that,"" says a mother on a mission.In a world with kids learning the Sicilian Defence before the alphabet, Koneru Humpy comes across as a pillar, a mother who seems reluctant to make motherhood her excuse.",Koneru Humpy is India's top-ranked woman in chess.

Former Pakistan all-rounder Imad Wasim has lashed out at the national cricket team's outdated playing style following their disappointing performance in the recently concluded ICC Champions Trophy . As hosts, Pakistan finished last in Group A after a winless campaign, suffering heavy defeats to finalists New Zealand and eventual champions India. Their only point came from a washed-out match against Bangladesh, but they still finished below Bangladesh due to an inferior net run rate.Imad, who retired from international cricket, expressed his frustration in a video clip shared by an X user, admitting that he often feels reluctant to watch Pakistan play. ""So you got to play cricket. Cricket, like it should be played. This is not the right way for me, if you ask me as a cricketer — not even as a Pakistani, just as a cricketer. I watch some of the games the Pakistan team play, and I feel I just don't want to watch it, but I have to watch it. Eventually, people will lose interest, and they won't come to watch cricket if we keep playing like this,"" he said.The former all-rounder criticised Pakistan's cautious and outdated approach, pointing out that modern cricket requires a more aggressive and proactive mindset. He argued that teams like England and Australia have set a new standard that Pakistan has failed to follow.""So you see England, Australia — or cricket I can understand — the solution I'm telling you I can understand. Your first instinct should be to go out there and attack the opposition. And if you lose wickets, then you assess the conditions — okay, this is a 250, 260, 300 wicket — whatever. But your first instinct should just be to go out there and attack, not to think, ‘Let's score 250.' We are way behind where the world is,"" Imad said.Reflecting on his earlier warnings that were ignored, Imad revealed that his calls for change were often met with ridicule. ""Well, I've been saying this for years, and people were laughing at me. Firstly, when I started saying these things, even in the team meetings, I used to say these things. The world is going on a different path, and we are playing the same way,"" he lamented.Imad's harsh critique echoes the sentiments of frustrated fans and cricket experts who believe Pakistan's reluctance to modernise their style is holding them back on the global stage.

India win Champions Trophy title; Rohit Sharma confirms he's not retiring

Dinesh Karthik (C) spoke at the RCB Innovation Labs, Indian Sports Summit in Bengaluru.

Will Rohit Sharma win 2027 World Cup? Astrologer Lobo predicts after getting Champions Trophy bang on!

COUNTRY VS FRANCHISE TALENT IDENTIFICATION

Had India not won the Champions Trophy in Dubai, it is quite conceivable that Rohit Sharma ’s place at the helm of the Indian cricket team would have come under scrutiny. He was on a perilously slippery slope, having fared poorly with the bat in back-to-back series losses against New Zealand and Australia in red-ball cricket. Forget captaincy, his place in the side was questioned. And in Dubai, he faced criticism over his fitness.But success in the white-ball version has shone the spotlight on his leadership acumen. Former Indian wicketkeeper Dinesh Karthik , who was part of the Indian team when they won the Champions Trophy in 2013, watched Rohit and his men’s successful journey from the commentary box recently. He believes Sharma’s leadership skills are second to none.Speaking at RCB Innovation Labs, Indian Sports Summit here on Friday, Karthik said: “In the past nine months, this Indian team has won two massive competitions (T20 World Cup and Champions Trophy). So, I think the sky's the limit for them because they are led by a very able leader in Rohit Sharma. You can see that he’s got the respect of his peers. Most importantly, he walks the walk and talks the talk with how cricket needs to be played.”Still, even with the best leadership, one needs a smattering of talent to go the distance in a multi-team event and the fact wasn’t lost on Karthik. “The beauty of this Indian team is the strength and depth that they have in terms of the number of players that they've got,” he said. “Not many countries today can say that they can field two or three teams in international cricket and have them competing with each other.”Did the IPL have a role in India’s near dominance of white-ball cricket? “India right now is in a very privileged and blessed place where they have such a good assortment of cricketers across skill sets. They could easily compete for the next decade or so considering the assembly line of players that the IPL and Indian domestic cricket are producing. The value in terms of understanding pressure, the big moments is what makes this Indian team really special,” said Karthik, who was in conversation with former England player and commentator Isha Guha and Mo Bobat , Royal Challengers Bengaluru ’s Director of Cricket.The 39-year-old gloveman went on to say: “In a lot of sporting environments, superpowers don’t go on to win tournaments. It’s always a challenge sometimes to just manage and assemble a group of players that produces results.”Once known as the T20 ‘razzmatazz’, Karthik believes the IPL, which turns 18 this year, has ensured a paradigm shift in perception and practice.“For a long time, Team India has been a cricketing nation which used to be happy competing, but now that attitude has changed. We want to win, and fans expect the team to win. That is what IPL has done. The influx of money has meant financial benefits that teams and stakeholders earn and a lot of it has gone back into infrastructure. When infrastructure grows, eventually the quality of sport develops and that’s the two biggest takeaways I think post the introduction of IPL in 2008,” said the current RCB batting coach and mentor.Karthik, who made his IPL debut for the erstwhile Delhi Daredevils, reflected on playing alongside Australian pace Glenn McGrath and the takeaways from it “For me the whole ideology of how Australia played at that time was a massive shock. They felt like a pack of wolves out to win every game. But with IPL, in my first year I got to spend time with Glenn McGrath in close quarters and practice with him. I got to know him better and became comfortable, that helped the confidence and mindset of competing with the best,” he said at the Padukone Dravid Centre of Excellence.Highlighting the difference between talent identification for a national team and a franchise, Bobat, who quit his role as performance director of the England men’s team to join RCB in 2023, stated, “In international cricket we often found that you were trying to really unpick and make sense to identify talent that was playing at a level beneath international cricket and making predictions about whether that talent could thrive at the level above. Coming over to RCB, firstly, it's an international market because you have overseas players. Understanding Indian talent is quite hard because of the volume and unstructured nature of it as well. So, finding talent in India is a much bigger challenge than it is finding it in the UK, but in a good way.”","Dinesh Karthik is the batting coach of the Royal Challengers Bengaluru in the IPL.

Champions Return: Rohit, Hardik, Shreyas, Gambhir return after India's title triumph

NEW DELHI: Former Australia batter David Warner is unbothered by the prospect of being booed by English cricket fans during The Hundred this summer. In fact, he welcomes the challenge.The 38-year-old opener is set to make his debut in the competition after being picked up by London Spirit in this week's draft. Warner has often encountered a hostile reception in England, with tensions reaching a peak during the 2023 Ashes at Lord’s following Jonny Bairstow ’s controversial stumping.""I actually want them to come at Australians. I love that stuff. That's what gets me going,"" Warner said. ""If they want to boo me, boo me, but don’t boo the team or anything like that.""Reflecting on his return to Lord’s, Spirit’s home ground, Warner acknowledged the potential for a charged atmosphere. ""We’ll have to wait until I step onto that field and see how they respond. I’ll have to walk past the Long Room first to get to the dressing room, so that will be interesting,"" he said.""But this time, I’m playing for London Spirit, not Australia. And most importantly, I need to find out if the Lord’s lunches are as good for The Hundred as they are for internationals!""Looking ahead to England’s 2025-26 Ashes tour of Australia, Warner expressed doubts about the effectiveness of Brendon McCullum and Ben Stokes’ aggressive style of Test cricket, known as 'Bazball,' in Australian conditions.""I don’t know if 'Bazball' is still a thing in England, but I just can’t see it working in Australia,"" he said. ""With the bounce and the types of fields Australia set last time in England, it would be a high-risk approach. You want to wear out the pitch and take the game into days four and five, and that style doesn’t really allow for that.""Warner also dismissed any notion of providing insights on Australian players to his English teammates at London Spirit. ""I’m sure I’ll get plenty of questions, but I won’t be giving anything away,"" he said.Although Warner briefly considered coming out of retirement for Australia's series against India last year when the team struggled to find a reliable opening partner for Usman Khawaja, he insists his international career is over.""That was just a case of putting my hand up if needed, with guys dropping out left, right, and center,"" Warner explained. ""But I’m well and truly finished at the international level. As much as I’d love to be part of another Ashes series, that chapter is closed for me.""","Former Australia batter David Warner is unbothered by the prospect of being booed by English cricket fans during The Hundred.

Australian left-arm spinner Matthew Kuhnemann has been cleared to continue bowling after his action was called into question following his impressive tour of Sri Lanka. Despite being momentarily stunned by the scrutiny, Kuhnemann remained confident throughout the process and is now focused on securing a spot in the Test squad for the upcoming tour of the West Indies.Kuhnemann, who topped the wickets tally with 16 in Australia’s 2-0 series win in Sri Lanka, admitted he was surprised when his action was questioned. ""I've played over 100 professional games and never got questioned, so that's why I was always confident that I'd be fine,"" he said ahead of Tasmania's final Sheffield Shield game against New South Wales.The testing process proved to be straightforward for the 28-year-old spinner, who described it as simply ""going in there and bowling 20-30 balls (surrounded by) lots of cameras and sensors."" He emphasised that he never doubted the legality of his action, saying, ""I've bowled millions of balls during my career, and there was no doubt whatsoever.""Despite his confidence, Kuhnemann was forced to sit out Tasmania’s round-eight loss to South Australia while awaiting the test results. Although he remained eligible to play domestically, the waiting period provided a rare opportunity to rest and recover from the rigorous workload in Sri Lanka, where he bowled 92.3 overs in just two weeks.""It's pretty rare to get a break in the middle of the season,"" he said, grateful for the unexpected respite. ""I gave a chance for my body to recover. It was like a mini pre-season in the middle of the season, so it was quite nice to have a couple weeks off.""The break also allowed Kuhnemann to fully heal a fractured right thumb sustained during the Sri Lanka series.With the all-clear from the testing process, Kuhnemann now has his sights set on another potential Test assignment against the West Indies later this year. Acknowledging the spin-friendly nature of Caribbean pitches, he expressed his eagerness to be part of the touring squad.""I've personally never been to the West Indies, but I've heard it has taken some spin in the last few years, so if the opportunity comes, I'd love to go over there and play a role in that squad,"" he said.Having navigated both the thumb injury and the scrutiny of his bowling action within a short span, Kuhnemann feels more resilient and determined to continue proving his worth. ""Before the incident and after, I've never been more confident in my ability as a cricketer than I am at the moment,"" he concluded, ready to take on whatever challenges lie ahead.",Australian left-arm spinner Matthew Kuhnemann has been cleared to continue bowling.

Australia’s young all-rounder Cooper Connolly cherished his memorable outing against India in the ICC Champions Trophy semi-final, where he dismissed Indian skipper Rohit Sharma . Despite being dismissed early by the ever-reliable Mohammed Shami , Connolly remained optimistic, taking valuable lessons from his high-pressure debut in a major tournament.Making his first appearance in the Champions Trophy, Connolly stepped up to open alongside Travis Head after Matthew Short ’s unfortunate injury. However, the 21-year-old fell victim to a stunning out-swinging delivery from Shami, who showcased his mastery with the new ball. Reflecting on the dismissal, Connolly acknowledged Shami’s prowess, saying, ""Shami is a world-class player for a reason. He's played a lot of cricket.""Connolly’s composure was tested early as he also dropped a catch off Rohit Sharma in just the second over of India’s chase. Though the moment could have rattled many, Connolly remained unfazed, focusing on the next challenge. ""It's the game of cricket. You're going to miss out, you're going to drop a catch – you've got to get on with what's in front of you,"" he said.When handed the ball, Connolly made up for his earlier miss by claiming the prized scalp of Rohit Sharma, securing his first ODI wicket. Dismissing the Indian captain in a high-stakes clash marked a defining moment for the youngster, who shared his mindset during the tense period. ""That (drop off Rohit) was completely out of my mind by the time I was bowling. I was just trying to compete as much as I could and hopefully get a breakthrough for the team,"" he revealed.Connolly, who also made his Test debut against Sri Lanka earlier in the year, is hungry for more opportunities at the international level. ""Getting my Baggy Green and then to play a game in the Champions Trophy, it was a dream come true … hopefully there's plenty more to come,"" he said.Looking ahead, Connolly is determined to keep improving and make the most of his opportunities. ""I guess it's just about concentrating on what's in front of me at the moment, not looking too far ahead, and just trying to enjoy playing cricket and hopefully put some scores on the board,"" he said.Having had a taste of the big stage, Connolly’s resolve to succeed remains stronger than ever. ""Obviously getting a little taste of it makes you want it more,"" he concluded.",Cooper Connolly made his ODI debut against India in the Champions Trophy.

Former West Indies wicketkeeper-batter Denesh Ramdin considers Rishabh Pant a standout keeper-batter in today's cricketing world, highlighting Pant's unique batting style and ability to score runs.Pant, who missed out on playing in the ICC Champions Trophy 2025, is set to lead Lucknow Super Giants in IPL 2025 , starting on March 22.""Obviously, Rishabh Pant is one—he's unique in the way he bats and scores runs. There's a young guy from Australia, Josh Inglis—he did well in the Champions Trophy. Tom Banton is up there as well. There are many young keepers coming through.“Back in the day, wicketkeepers were primarily just keepers, but now cricket has evolved. The role of the keeper-batsman has expanded, starting with players like Adam Gilchrist, who opened the batting and excelled. Others like Quinton de Kock, Brendon McCullum, and of course, the exceptional Mahendra Singh Dhoni, have been fantastic in shaping the modern wicketkeeper's role,"" said Ramdin.Ramdin also commented on Sunil Narine 's potential performance in IPL 2025 for defending champions Kolkata Knight Riders .""Obviously, Narine was the MVP last year, and his team won the championship. He'll have a lot of confidence going into the new season, but every season brings a new atmosphere and new challenges, with different players in the team.“I have no doubt that Sunil, though a man of few words, expresses himself fully through his performances with both the ball and the bat,"" he added.",Rishabh Pant is set to lead Lucknow Super Giants in IPL 2025.

India win Champions Trophy title; Rohit Sharma confirms he's not retiring

'Not going anywhere': Rohit Sharma on retirement from ODIs after winning the Champions Trophy

Former Australian captain Ricky Ponting has praised India's all-rounders Ravindra Jadeja Axar Patel , and Hardik Pandya for their performance in the 2025 Champions Trophy, which India won under Rohit Sharma 's leadership.""Their all-rounders right through the tournament were outstanding,"" Ponting said on the latest edition of The ICC Review. ""(Ravindra) Jadeja, Axar Patel, Hardik Pandya, were all outstanding. I said at the start of the tournament I thought India would be really hard to beat because of their overall balance and because of that mix of youth and experience, and once again, in a final, the captain stands up and gets the job done for his team.""Ponting discussed how the presence of three all-rounders in the playing XI provided India with exceptional batting depth.""They were a very well balanced side anyway, but because they had so many all-rounders…when you've got Hardik Pandya, Axar Patel, who they used up the order on a number of occasions for that left-handed option, and with Jadeja there as well, they were a very well balanced team.""The only thing you would probably say, they probably looked a little bit light on fast bowling, but as it turned out, they didn't need that. That's where Hardik Pandya's role becomes really important to be able to bowl with a new ball and get through some overs early to make it a little bit easier for the spinners in the backend of their Powerplay and also through the middle overs where they predominantly bowl and spin pretty much right through the middle of the game.""Axar Patel has shown significant improvement in his batting skills while working with Delhi Capitals under Ponting's guidance as head coach.Patel has enhanced his batting technique by adjusting his front foot position for lofting shots, maintaining his stance, and developing scoring options on the square of the wicket.""Axar Patel is the other one that I think needs a lot of credit for this tournament. I think his bowling was as consistent and rock solid as you'd ever see,"" Ponting added. ""Then, just some of those little cameos he played with the bat, coming in earlier and sort of steadying the ship and just making life a little bit easier for the lower order in KL Rahul, Pandya, and Jadeja…I think he deserves a lot of credit for his tournament.""","Former Australian captain Ricky Ponting has praised India's all-rounders Ravindra Jadeja Axar Patel, and Hardik Pandya for their performance in the Champions Trophy.

NEW DELHI: Lionel Messi made a triumphant return to action on Thursday night, coming off the bench to score Inter Miami’s second goal in a 2-0 victory over Jamaica’s Cavalier FC. The win sealed a 4-0 aggregate triumph and booked Miami’s place in the quarter-finals of the CONCACAF Champions Cup.Rested for Miami’s last three outings, including the first leg of this tie, Messi entered in the 53rd minute to roars from a sold-out crowd at Kingston’s National Stadium — many of whom came just to witness the eight-time Ballon d'Or winner grace Jamaican soil for the first time.The Argentine didn't disappoint. With the final kick of the match, Messi latched onto a perfectly weighted pass from 16-year-old Santiago Morales and coolly slotted the ball past goalkeeper Vinco Barclett, triggering celebrations from both Miami fans and local supporters thrilled just to see the legend in action.Watch:Luis Suárez opened the scoring in the 37th minute, converting a penalty after Tadeo Allende was brought down in the box. That strike gave Miami a comfortable 3-0 cushion on aggregate, allowing them to manage the game with composure despite losing David Ruiz to injury.Cavalier, fielding a youthful and energetic squad, showed heart throughout. Substitute Kaile Auvray came closest to pulling one back, forcing a sharp near-post save from Inter keeper Oscar Ustari.Post-match, Inter Miami head coach Javier Mascherano praised Messi’s impact: ""He felt very good, he scored, the Jamaican people could see him — it was a great night for everyone.""Despite the defeat, Cavalier coach Rudolph Speid was proud of his team: ""The atmosphere was electrifying… Our performance was nothing to be ashamed of.""Inter Miami will now face Los Angeles FC in an all-MLS quarter-final showdown.",Lionel Messi came off the bench to score in Inter Miami's 2-0 win over Jamaica's Cavalier FC.

NEW DELHI: Bruno Fernandes delivered a sensational performance as Manchester United stormed into the Europa League quarter-finals with a 4-1 victory over Real Sociedad at Old Trafford, securing a 5-2 aggregate win.Fernandes opened the scoring from the penalty spot in the 10th minute and added another in the 50th, again from 12 yards, after converting in the 16th minute as well. Real Sociedad, reduced to 10 men following Jon Aramburu’s red card just after the hour mark, couldn’t hold off the pressure.Fernandes completed his hat-trick with a rifled finish in the 87th minute, and Diogo Dalot added a stoppage-time goal to seal the emphatic result. “We need to help him win titles, because he deserves it,” Manchester United manager Ruben Amorim told TNT Sports, praising his captain.He added, “It was a good performance. The physicality was there... Even without the sending-off, you felt that the team were going to win this game.” United will face Lyon in the next round.Tottenham Hotspur also progressed to the Europa League last eight after turning around a first-leg deficit to beat AZ Alkmaar 3-2 on aggregate. Wilson Odobert got the hosts level on aggregate with a 26th-minute strike, taking advantage of sloppy defending from the Dutch side.Three minutes into the second half, James Maddison fired in a composed finish to put Spurs 2-0 up on the night. Peer Koopmeiners brought AZ back into the tie after the hour mark, but Odobert’s second goal in the 74th minute secured a 3-1 win on the night and sent Tottenham through.“We’ve progressed, which is the main thing,” said Spurs boss Ange Postecoglou. “We played pretty well, I thought we were really in control of the game, but we were our own worst enemies at times. It got a bit nervy towards the end but we thoroughly deserved to progress.” Spurs will meet Eintracht Frankfurt in the quarter-finals.Meanwhile, Rangers pulled off a dramatic shootout win over Jose Mourinho’s Fenerbahce in the Europa Conference League. After a 3-1 defeat in Istanbul, the Turkish side fought back in Glasgow with two goals from Polish winger Sebastian Szymanski in the 45th and 73rd minutes, levelling the aggregate score at 3-3 and sending the tie to extra time.However, three missed penalties in the shootout saw Rangers advance 3-2. Mourinho was vocal in his frustration after the match. “We deserved to win over 90 minutes, we deserved to win after 120 minutes, we were the best team by far,” he said.“We did everything to win. The ref and the VAR decided that we should go to penalties. Congratulations to Rangers but I think my team deserves everything from me, from our supporters and even from Turkey as a country.” Rangers will face Athletic Bilbao next.Chelsea also secured their spot in the quarter-finals of the Europa Conference League with a narrow 1-0 home win over Copenhagen, finishing 3-1 on aggregate. Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall scored the only goal of the night 10 minutes into the second half at Stamford Bridge, ensuring progression for the Blues.Elsewhere, Athletic Bilbao staged a comeback to eliminate Roma 4-3 on aggregate, powered by a vital brace from Euro 2024 winner Nico Williams. Roma’s hopes were dented early by a red card to centre-half Mats Hummels. Lazio, however, had better fortunes, drawing 1-1 with Viktoria Plzen at home to progress 3-2 overall.In Frankfurt, Mario Goetze bagged a brace as Eintracht thrashed Ajax 4-1, completing a dominant 6-2 aggregate win.

""Under the current rule, the VAR had to call the referee, signaling that the goal should be disallowed.""In light of the controversy, UEFA confirmed plans to engage in discussions with FIFA and the International Football Association Board ( IFAB ) to review the rule on unintentional double touches during penalties.""UEFA will enter discussions with FIFA and IFAB to determine whether the rule should be reviewed in cases where a double touch is clearly unintentional,"" the statement added.Simeone, addressing the press, said he wanted to believe the officials had made the correct decision but remained skeptical. He challenged journalists to confirm whether they had seen a replay clearly showing Alvarez’s double touch.""Raise your hand, anyone who saw Julian touch it twice. Who is going to raise their hand?

""But beyond that, which now just serves to argue about whether it should have counted or not, I am proud of my players, I am happy, truly,"" he said.

NEW DELHI: Brazilian football legend Ronaldo , who is also a two-time World Cup winner, has withdrawn his intention to run for the presidency of the Brazilian Football Confederation (CBF) due to a lack of support from regional federations.In a social media post, the two-time Ballon d'Or winner stated that after publicly expressing his desire to become a candidate for the CBF presidency, he has officially withdrawn his intention.Ronaldo cited the lack of support from the majority of those with the power to decide as the reason for his withdrawal, stating that if they feel football is in good hands, his opinion does not matter.""After publicly declaring my desire to be a candidate for the presidency of the CBF during the next election, I'm officially withdrawing this intention. If the majority of those who have the power to decide feel that football is in good hands, it doesn't matter what I think,"" said Ronaldo.The 48-year-old had previously announced his intention to take the reins of the CBF in December, aiming to address what he perceived as a ""deep crisis"" in Brazilian football.However, Ronaldo revealed that 23 out of the 27 regional federations representing the various states of Brazil refused to listen to his proposals. Instead, they expressed their support for the re-election of the current CBF president, Ednaldo Rodrigues , in 2026.Rodrigues has faced criticism for his handling of the national team's coaching situation after Tite's departure following Brazil's quarter-final exit at the 2022 World Cup.Initially, Rodrigues pursued the appointment of Carlo Ancelotti, but the Italian coach ultimately decided to remain with Real Madrid.

Madison Keys powered into the Indian Wells semifinals on Thursday, dismantling wild-card Belinda Bencic 6-1, 6-1 in just 65 minutes to notch her 16th straight victory. The fifth-seeded American, who claimed the Australian Open title earlier this year, now sets up a highly anticipated rematch with world No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka . The two last met at Melbourne Park in January, where Keys defeated Sabalenka in a three-set battle, halting the Belarusian’s bid for a third straight title.Despite upsetting No. 4 seed Coco Gauff in the previous round, Bencic — a 28-year-old from Switzerland — had no answers for Keys’ relentless play.Elsewhere in the women’s draw, defending champion Iga Swiatek continued her dominant run in the California desert, advancing to her fourth straight semifinal at Indian Wells with a 6-3, 6-3 win over eighth-seeded Qinwen Zheng. Swiatek, the No. 2 seed and a five-time Grand Slam winner, is aiming to become the first woman to win the event three times. She’s riding a 10-match win streak at Indian Wells, having also lifted the trophy in 2022.Zheng, who had ended Swiatek’s 25-match winning streak at the Paris Olympics last year, couldn’t replicate that magic. Though she broke Swiatek twice and won six games — equaling the total games Swiatek had lost all tournament — the Polish star converted all five of her break points to seal the match.In the men’s draw, two-time defending champion Carlos Alcaraz fought off determined challenger Francisco Cerundolo 6-3, 7-6 (7/4) to reach the semi-finals.On another cold, blustery night in the California desert, Alcaraz battled back from 1-4 down in the second set, coming up with a break and two love service holds to force the tiebreaker as he kept his bid to join Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic as the only men to win three straight Indian Wells titles on track.Alcaraz had to save break points in each of his first three service games. But after an emphatic hold for 4-3 he gained the first break of the contest with a deft volley and just like that he was serving for the first set.After sliding to pop a drop volley winner over the net for set point Alcaraz drilled a deep forehand that Cerundolo could barely get a racquet on.But it was Cerundolo who broke first in the second, finally converting his ninth break point of the match then holding for 4-1.But he couldn't hold off the world number three, who raced to a 5-2 lead in the tiebreaker on the way to victory.""It was really difficult for me to start the match,"" said Alcaraz, who looked less comfortable in the windy weather than he did just a day before.""He got a lot of chances in the first set,"" Alcaraz said. ""I'm just pleased about saving all of them and taking the only one that I had.""I didn't hit the ball as clear as yesterday, but I just did what I had to and that's what it's about.""Alcaraz next faces Britain's Jack Draper, who reached his first Masters 1000 semi-final with a 6-4, 7-5 victory over American Ben Shelton.Draper took the opening set with one break of serve then rallied from 0-3 down in a second-set slug-fest.Shelton's 32 unforced errors included five double-faults -- including one to hand Draper a break for 6-5 in the second.Russian Daniil Medvedev , runner-up to Alcaraz each of the past two years, rallied from a break down in a wild, wind-blown final set to beat Arthur Fils 6-4, 2-6, 7-6 (9/7).The world number six booked a semi-final meeting with Denmark's Holger Rune , a 5-7, 6-0, 6-3 winner over Tallon Griekspoor.Medvedev, a six-time Grand Slam finalist, trailed 20-year-old Fils 2-4 in the third set of a compelling clash that was momentarily paused as gusting winds sent towels and trash cans flying on Stadium Court.France's Fils had shown admirable maturity in the face of Medvedev's formidable defensive skills.He cut down on the unforced errors that marred his first set to win the second with ease and maintained his poise as he erased an early break in the third to seize the lead.But Medvedev wouldn't be denied and after forcing the tiebreaker prevailed on his third match point when Fils pushed a backhand volley long.Medvedev, who had won just one of his past nine third-set tiebreakers, gave a leap of sheer joy after securing the win in 2 hours and 25 minutes to keep alive his bid for a first title since 2023 -- when he won five.""I lost a lot of tight matches this year where I could have won, should have won maybe,"" Medvedev said. ""I have lost a lot of tight matches where it goes a little bit 50-50 and the more it goes like that, the more you can lose confidence in the tight moments.""I was happy I was able to get over the line as he saved some match points and had a break lead in the third. I am just happy to win.""Medvedev faces another young gun in Rune, who burst onto the scene in 2022 with a win over Novak Djokovic in the Paris Masters final.Rune has struggled often since, but after dropping the first set he dominated Griekspoor, the 43rd-ranked Dutchman who had ousted top-seeded Alexander Zverev in the second round.","Madison Keys crushes wild-card Belinda Bencic 6-1,6-1 in just 65 minutes to notch her 16th straight victory.

NEW DELHI: Mirra Andreeva ’s stunning rise in the WTA rankings has been so rapid that even the 17-year-old Russian admits she can’t quite keep up with it. Just last month in Dubai, she made history as the youngest-ever WTA 1000 champion , defeating both Grand Slam winners Iga Swiatek and Elena Rybakina on her way to the title — a win that catapulted her into the top 10 for the first time, landing at No. 9.Now at Indian Wells , Andreeva entered the tournament ranked 11th, but wins over Rybakina once again in the fourth round and Elina Svitolina in the quarter-finals are expected to lift her back into the top 10. Not that she’s been checking too closely.""Before, I was always checking live rankings because before I was playing for a dog,"" Andreeva said with a smile. ""So after every match I play I would check the live rankings to see if I did it.""That milestone — breaking into the top 20 — came after she defeated Magda Linette in Beijing last October. The reward? A promise of a dog. But even now, the pet hasn’t arrived yet, as she’s still narrowing down her choice.""I'm thinking to get an ultra mini labradoodle ,"" she revealed. ""It's going to be a labrador mixed with poodle and it's ultra min, so going to be even smaller than a mini version. It's going to take time until the dog that I want will be born.""While rankings may not be her primary focus anymore, Andreeva is channeling her energy into what’s right in front of her — like an upcoming semi-final clash at Indian Wells against defending champion Swiatek. Despite her recent win over the Pole in Dubai, she’s not expecting it to give her any advantage.""It doesn't give me any benefit to our match (on Friday),"" she admitted.Tennis has become increasingly serious for the teenager, but she's not letting that take the fun out of the game completely. The young star, who draws inspiration from athletes like Roger Federer and LeBron James, is trying to balance focus with enjoyment.""When I was a bit younger it would all be about having fun,"" Andreeva said. ""But now I start to understand that it's pretty serious what I do out here. I feel like when I have fun on the court I play great tennis, so I still try to not be super, super serious but also to have fun a little bit.""So while a top-10 return and a potential title shot are on the horizon, Andreeva remains grounded — eyes on the next match, and perhaps more importantly, on the tiny dog she’s patiently waiting for.","Mirra Andreeva's rise in the WTA rankings has been so rapid that even the 17-year-old Russian admits she can’t keep up with it.

NEW DELHI: Belinda Bencic produced a stunning comeback to upset world number three Coco Gauff on Wednesday, booking her place in the Indian Wells quarter-finals where she will face Australian Open champion Madison Keys .The Swiss star, who gave birth to her daughter Bella last April, triumphed 3-6, 6-3, 6-4 to reach her first WTA 1000 quarter-final since becoming a mother. Unranked when she returned to the tour in October, Bencic has steadily climbed back, capturing her ninth career title in Abu Dhabi last month and rising to 58th in the world this week.“I just kept on working also on the physical side,” Bencic said. “In the last matches in tournaments, I was able to play back-to-back, some three-set matches, and am fresher every time. The body is holding up much better, almost like it was before.”Bencic showed remarkable poise against Gauff, recovering from a first-set loss and keeping the American under constant pressure. Gauff, who had beaten Bencic at the Australian Open earlier this year, struggled with her forehand and gave away the crucial break with a loose return at 4-4 in the deciding set.Keys also had to fight back in her match, defeating Croatia’s Donna Vekic 4-6, 7-6 (9/7), 6-3. After failing to convert a set point in the second set and trailing 3-5 in the tiebreak, the American dug deep and eventually powered through, breaking twice in the third set to seal victory with a fierce backhand return.In the men’s draw, Ben Shelton downed Brandon Nakashima 7-6 (8/6), 6-1 to reach his third ATP Masters 1000 quarter-final.

NEW DELHI: Holger Rune delivered one of the most jaw-dropping moments of Indian Wells 2025 on Tuesday, hitting a between-the-legs winner to save break point en route to a straight-sets victory over Stefanos Tsitsipas . But as thrilled as the crowd was, Rune was just as excited — at least until he saw the replay.""You know, I kind of had the expectation that I looked like Roger Federer when I hit it, and I didn't quite do that,"" Rune said with a laugh after his 6-4, 6-4 win. ""So that was disappointing.""The 21-year-old Dane’s flashy shot wasn’t just for show — it helped him knock off the world No. 9 and book a spot in the Indian Wells quarterfinals for the second consecutive year.It also marked Rune’s first quarterfinal appearance of 2025, a year that hasn’t quite lived up to expectations for the former world No. 4.After bursting onto the scene in 2022 with a memorable win over Novak Djokovic at the Paris Masters, Rune has struggled to maintain consistency, slipping to 13th in the rankings while contemporaries like Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner continue to climb.Still, Rune is staying focused, emphasising growth over frustration.""It's about making results, but at the same time improving your game and having stability,"" he said. ""Because I don't believe I have become the worse player the last two years. I actually think the opposite. I think I have become a better all-around player.""He admits falling short of expectations can sting. ""You know, when you have these expectations and you don't quite, like, live up to them, of course it's disappointing,"" he said.""But it's very basic and maybe it's very boring to say it, but I just love tennis .""So even not being satisfied with my results, I still love to go down to the practice court and hit forehands, backhands, work on my shots, my physicality ...

""So I kind of played more risky, but the shots were still in.""""I'm happy that I closed it, for sure, because I knew this big cloud is coming,"" she added.That cloud eventually delivered another round of showers that wreaked havoc with the day’s schedule. Multiple matches were delayed, including a third-set battle where Ukraine’s Elina Svitolina stunned world number four Jessica Pegula 5-7, 6-1, 6-2.""Definitely was not easy with all the conditions and the rain, stop and start,"" Svitolina said.

Indian Wells: Defending champion Iga Swiatek edged closer to an unprecedented third straight Indian Wells WTA title Sunday, overwhelming Dayana Yastremska 6-0, 6-2 to reach the fourth round.Swiatek's 65-minute victory set the tone on a day that saw Daniil Medvedev spend just 10 minutes on court before ailing opponent Alex Michelsen retired.Swiatek, the world number two from Poland, was in full control against hard-hitting Ukrainian Yastremska, swinging freely as she won the first 10 games.She converted six of her 11 break chances and didn't face a break point herself and it was virtually over by the time Yastremska got on the board with wins in her last two service games.""It's always hard to finish a match like that,"" Swiatek said. ""But I'm happy that I got my intensity up the last game and closed it with confidence.""Swiatek next faces Czech Karolina Muchova , who trailed 3-5 in the first set but won 10 of the next 11 games to beat compatriot Katerina Siniakova 7-5, 6-1.Russian 17-year-old Mirra Andreeva and 2023 Indian Wells champion Elena Rybakina joined Swiatek in dishing out bagels as they lined up a fourth-round clash.Andreeva, who triumphed in Dubai last month to become the youngest ever winner of a WTA 1000 event , beat Denmark's Clara Tauson 6-3, 6-0 in 63 minutes.Rybakina downed Britain's Katie Boulter 6-0, 7-5.Andreeva -- who beat Tauson in the final in Dubai -- said she found conditions on Stadium Court tougher than she made it look.""I'm just happy the way I managed to stay in the game,"" she said. ""I didn't give her much rhythm so I guess it was not bad -- but there's a lot of things to work on.""Women's fourth seed Jessica Pegula of the United States, fresh off her first WTA title of the year in Austin, was another quick winner, putting away China's Wang Xinyu 6-2, 6-1 in just 62 minutes.Pegula next faces Ukraine's Elina Svitolina, a 6-2, 6-4 winner over Danielle Collins.Medvedev headlined the men's lineup in the combined ATP Masters and WTA 1000 event, but he was barely underway when 20-year-old Michelson retired because of illness after dropping the first two games.""Food poisoning or something like this, these things happen,"" said Medvedev, who was headed to the practice courts to tune up for a fourth-round clash with 10th-seeded American Tommy Paul.Paul beat Britain's 2021 Indian Wells winner Cameron Norrie, now ranked 77th in the world, 6-3, 7-5.Eighth-seeded Stefanos Tsitsipas, coming off his first title in almost a year in Dubai, beat Matteo Berrettini 6-3, 6-3 in a rematch of their Dubai quarter-final last week.Tsitsipas dropped just eight points on his serve as he wrong-footed Italian with a variety of athletic shots, breaking him three times on the way to victory in 68 minutes.After months in the doldrums Tsitsipas said he was relishing a new mental approach to the game.""I just feel like I want to get out there on the court and be a gladiator, and that's how I approach every single match I get to play,"" he said.Tallon Griekspoor , the world No. 43 from the Netherlands who shocked world number two and top seed Alexander Zverev in the second round, backed up his big win with a 7-6 (7/3), 6-3 victory over France's 29th seed Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard.Griekspoor fired 10 aces, dominating the first set tiebreaker, and didn't face a break point in the second set.Griekspoor needed an hour and 16 minutes to secure the win, but in a season in which dropping the first set has become an alarming habit that was fast enough.""It feels nice to win a match in under one and a half hour,"" he said.","Defending champion Iga Swiatek beats Dayana Yastremska 6-0, 6-2 to reach fourth round.

Former world number one Novak Djokovic , who has won the Indian Wells ATP Masters five times, suffered a surprising defeat in his opening match on Saturday, going down to lucky loser Botic van de Zandschulp, while reigning champion Carlos Alcaraz progressed to the next round.The 24-time Grand Slam champion Djokovic lost 6-2, 3-6, 6-1.""No excuses for a poor performance,"" the Serb said after the match. ""It doesn't feel great when you play this way on the court. But congratulations to my opponent -- just a bad day in the office, I guess, for me.""Van de Zandschulp has established a notable record against the big guns.His impressive victories include a remarkable win against Alcaraz at the US Open in the previous year, followed by a triumph over Rafael Nadal in Davis Cup, which turned out to be the Spanish legend's final professional match.""I think I kept my cool during the whole match,” said van de Zandschulp. ""I know if I go into the match and lose my cool, especially against the big players, it's going to be a really tough day. That's always one thing I'm trying to do well.""Djokovic reduced his unforced errors significantly in the second set, compared to his 14 mistakes in the first set and swiftly secured a service break, establishing a 3-0 advantage.He celebrated with a fist pump after striking a powerful forehand winner to the corner, earning his first break opportunity of the contest.Despite the intense exchanges continuing throughout, Djokovic's visible signs of frustration emerged occasionally. Although he lost his serve while attempting to close out the set, he succeeded in his subsequent service game, delivering a powerful forehand winner to the baseline to make it an even contest.But the momentum shift proved temporary. Zandschulp maintained consistent pressure through both baseline play and net approaches, as Djokovic's error count increased steadily.Zandschulp gained the upper hand with a break for 3-1, subsequently winning five consecutive games as Djokovic struggled to halt his opponent's progress.Djokovic exit followed a similar shock suffered by world number two Alexander Zverev and fourth-seeded Casper Ruud.The tournament's landscape has shifted dramatically, with world number three Alcaraz emerging as the highest-ranked player remaining, particularly notable given world number one Jannik Sinner's absence due to a three-month drugs suspension.Alcaraz, pursuing a remarkable achievement of three consecutive Indian Wells titles - a feat only accomplished by Djokovic and Roger Federer - commenced his title defence impressively, defeating France's Quentin Halys 6-4, 6-2.The Spanish player secured an early advantage to claim the opening set, before establishing a commanding 4-0 lead in the second set with impressive serving.His dominant display included seven aces and successful defence of the sole break point faced, concluding the match efficiently in 67 minutes.""I was nervous at the beginning of the match,"" he told a supportive crowd.

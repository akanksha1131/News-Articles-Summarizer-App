Poll What was your favorite moment from Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli's final ODI match in Australia? Rohit scoring a century Kohli's comeback after poor form The crowd's energy at the SCG The partnership setting up the win

“He had one of those natures which called to you and in whose presence you felt it was good to live.” Frank Iredale wrote this of Victor Trumper, his colleague on the 1899 Australian tour of England. On Saturday at the Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG), for those lucky enough to be there or watching on TV or mobile phones, it felt the same watching Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma turn back the clock.For both men, this match carried the weight of endings. Rohit and Kohli have both retired from Tests and T20Is. With no ODIs scheduled in Australia before the 2027 World Cup, these were almost certainly their final outings on Australian soil. “I don’t know if we’ll be coming back to Australia, but it was fun all these years that we played here,” said the 38-year-old Rohit Sharma after the match. “You know, a lot of good memories, bad memories. But all in all, I’ll take the cricket that I played here. ”Sydney had once been unkind to them. It was on this very ground that they had seen their stars fall apart earlier this year, as Rohit had to drop himself from the Test XI. Kohli, leading a bruised team, watched as Jasprit Bumrah walked off injured and Australia clinched the Border-Gavaskar series. That match and tour closed chapters neither man had planned to finish, as within months both of them — two pillars of Indian cricket — surprisingly announced their retirement from the longest format.And yet, Sydney had another chapter waiting.Walking out in blue for the final ODI of the series against Australia, Rohit and Kohli carried unfinished business. The crowd, aware of what this venue had meant to their journey, filled the stands with expectation and nostalgia.The two veterans didn’t disappoint and turned back the clock with a 168-run match-winning stand as India defeated Australia by nine wickets in the dead-rubber third one-day international, likely their swansong Down Under. Chasing a modest 237, India reached the target comfortably with 69 balls to spare at a sold-out SCG. Rohit was unbeaten on 121, but it was Kohli who received the loudest roar. This happened despite the fact that Kohli had suffered two ducks in the opening games of the series at Adelaide and Perth, both won by Australia. At the SCG, the chase master stayed unbeaten on 74.Rohit, India’s top scorer in the series, reminded everyone of the value of experience. Kohli, meanwhile, returning to form, looked like a man still fighting, still possessed, still searching, still not done. There’s no guarantee how many more innings like these are left in them, but Sydney gave them the chance to rewrite — or end — a story where it once broke, something most players never get.Cricket rarely allows fairytales — it’s too unforgiving and ruthless a game. But sometimes, for those who’ve given enough to the sport, it allows one small kindness. And Sydney, for once, was kind. The same place that had seen them falter in whites gave them their moment in blue.At the same venue where both once looked like men at the end of their road, they found a way to remind everyone that the road still had a few miles left.Will Rohit score another hundred? Maybe. Perhaps there will be another great chase from Kohli. Perhaps not. Will both of them make it to the 2027 World Cup? Who knows. But those are questions for another day. This game was about two men who refused to be remembered for their fall — and wrote their own ending Down Under instead.","India defeated Australia by nine wickets in the dead-rubber third one-day international, likely their swansong Down Under.

Rohit Sharma's record-breaking knock vs Virat Kohli’s duck | India vs Australia 2nd ODI

Kuldeep, the missing link

Aussie bowling brilliance

India didn’t see this one coming. Against an Australia batting lineup deep in transition and without a single familiar match-winner in the middle order, the consensus among fans was that it would be a walk in the park in the ODI series for Shubman Gill’s men.It turned out to be exactly the opposite. The young Aussie batters rode through choppy waters and with a two-wicket win at the Adelaide Oval on Thursday, the series is now wrapped up 2-0.The Indian fans, though, had something to cheer about as Rohit Sharma sprang back to life with a fighting 97-ball 73. But Virat Kohli’s second duck of the series was a serious dampener, and now the sell-out at Sydney Cricket Ground on Saturday will be all about the ‘Ro-Ko’ farewell — if not anything else, definitely in Australia.Even as the Aussies chose to leave out the likes of Cameron Green, Josh Inglis, and Marnus Labuschagne — probably allowing them preparation time for the Ashes — they went in with all their top-flight bowlers, barring an injured Pat Cummins.Josh Hazlewood, Mitchell Starc, and Adam Zampa are masters of these conditions, and with medium-pacer Xavier Bartlett too chipping in with the wickets of Shubman Gill (9), Virat Kohli (0), and Washington Sundar , the score ended up being a modest 264.There was a time when it used to be enough. Had Jasprit Bumrah and Kuldeep Yadav been playing, it might still have been, even on Thursday. The Indian bowlers kept chipping in with wickets, but there was no one to hit the knock-out punch when the Aussie rookies built those pockets of resistance.No. 3 Matt Short (74 off 78 balls) did make use of the two lives that he got, while No. 7 Mitchell Owen (36 off 23 balls) ensured that he would attract a lot of interest from IPL franchises. But Cooper Connolly, a 22-year-old southpaw who looked a mess against India during the course of a nine-ball duck as an opener in the Champions Trophy semifinal earlier in the year, was the hero of the day. Mixing caution with aggression, the No. 6 showed superb temperament during the course of his 61 not out off 53 balls to take the Aussies home, even as wickets kept falling around him.Kuldeep Yadav was seen obliging selfie hunters long after the game was over. The left-arm wrist spinner would have enjoyed the adulation even more if he had won the game for India.But then, he wasn’t given a chance, yet again. India chose to play with eight batters, with allrounder Nitish Reddy batting at No. 8. Reddy scored a 10-ball 8 and bowled three overs for 24 without a wicket, as Kuldeep sat in the dug-out.The Australian middle order, time and time again, showed their frailties against spin. Against the finger-spin of Washington Sundar and Axar Patel, the likes of Matt Renshaw and Alex Carey found ways to get out. But Kuldeep wasn’t there to deal the killer blow on inexperienced Connolly and Owen when they were running away with the game during the course of their 59-run sixth-wicket partnership.While India’s lack of teeth in bowling at the crunch became a point of discussion, it was the Aussie attack that stole the show in the first couple of hours.Hazlewood (0-29) probably bowled the best spell of his life where he didn’t get a wicket. Hitting the right length, which had the batsmen guessing whether to go forward or back, the paceman made life miserable for Rohit. With the runs completely drying up against Hazlewood, Gill had to take a chance against Bartlett, but he was caught superbly at mid-off by Mitchell Marsh. In the same over, the pacer removed Kohli with a little off-cutter, and India were 17-2 in the seventh over.There was a fightback, courtesy Rohit and Shreyas Iyer (61 off 77 balls), but then it was over to Adam Zampa (4-60). The leggie, with his subtle variations of pace and turn, removed Iyer, a top player of spin. Axar Patel and KL Rahul are equally good, and had any one of them been there till the end, India could easily have pushed for 300.",Australia beat India by two wickets in second ODI in Adelaide. Cooper Connolly scored 61 not out off 53 balls to take Aussies home. Virat Kohli's second duck of the series was a serious dampener. The series is now wrapped up 2-0 for Australia.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124777454,imgsize-168106,width-400,resizemode-4/australia-vs-india-odi-match.jpg"

SYDNEY: Record-breaking striker Sam Kerr has vowed to reclaim the captaincy of Australia, declaring she has ""so much more to give"" in the role.Kerr is poised to make her first Matildas appearance in almost two years when Australia meet Wales in Cardiff this weekend.The 32-year-old returned to club football for Chelsea in September after a long rehabilitation from a serious knee injury sustained in December 2023.During her absence she went through a high-profile court case in London, where she was found not guilty of racially aggravated harassment of a police officer during a drunken night out.However, the judge said her ""behaviour contributed significantly to the bringing of this allegation"".Kerr was appointed captain in 2019, with Arsenal defender Steph Catley typically skippering the side since her injury.""On being the captain, of course I still feel really passionate about that,"" she told Australian media from Wales.""I know I have so much more to give for this team in a leadership role, and this team here will make football decisions, and I feel like football-wise, I'm one of the best leaders in the team.""So I feel really passionate and proud that I've been in that position before, and hopefully continue forward.""Coach Joe Montemurro has yet to make a decision on who will wear the armband against Wales where Kerr -- Australia's all-time leading goalscorer -- is unlikely to play the full match.She has managed limited minutes for Chelsea since returning but expects to be back to full fitness soon with the women's Asian Cup in Australia next March a key motivation.""The Asian Cup is so important,"" she said. ""When I last won it (in 2010), I was a young 16-year-old kid, so I didn't even really get to experience what it actually was like.""Looking back, I was living my dream without even knowing it, so it would be good to hopefully lift the trophy.

'India Jeetega!' Even Australia fans cheer for India before Sydney ODI

Australian cricket captain Pat Cummins has dismissed the possibility of using four fast bowlers in the upcoming Ashes series against England, indicating spinner Nathan Lyon will remain in the team.Nathan Lyon missed Australia's recent Test match against West Indies in Jamaica, his first absence in 12 years, where Australia secured victory within three days.The Jamaica Test saw Mitchell Starc take six wickets for nine runs, while Scott Boland achieved a hat-trick as West Indies were bowled out for 27.Cummins, currently recovering from a back injury before the first Ashes Test in Perth on November 21, believes the Australian pitches will present different conditions.""I'd find it very unlikely that we would go away from Gaz (Lyon) at all this summer,"" he told the Sydney Morning Herald on Saturday.""Kingston was extreme -- pink-ball conditions, long grass, an up-and-down wicket.""I'd almost guarantee there won't be four quicks this summer, especially with a couple of all-rounders in the team as well.""""You probably need to look at the pitch and basically think it's going to be a terrible two-and-a-half day, or a three-day pitch.In Kingston, we didn't think the game was going to see a fourth day.""Most games in Australia, even if it's green, you think it could get flat and you'll be wanting Gaz.""Lyon has taken 268 of his 562 Test wickets on Australian soil, maintaining an average of 31.08.If Lyon plays his 140th Test in Perth as expected, he needs just two wickets to surpass Glenn McGrath 's record and become the sixth-highest wicket-taker in history.Cummins' fitness remains uncertain after recently stating he was ""probably less likely than likely"" to play in the opening Test.England's pace attack for the five-Test series includes Jofra Archer , Gus Atkinson, Josh Tongue, Brydon Carse, and Mark Wood, with Shoaib Bashir as their lone specialist spinner.Lyon has cautioned England about potentially not including Bashir in their lineup.""For me, you're picking a spinner in every side because the variation changes the tempo of the game,"" Lyon stated earlier this month.England's selection decision for the Perth Test remains pending, though their spinners have historically struggled in Australian conditions.","Pat Cummins dismisses possibility of using four fast bowlers in Ashes series.

ACB spokesperson condemns 'barbaric attack' that killed 3 Afghanistan cricketers

NEW DELHI: Shan Masood has announced that he will step down as Pakistan’s Test captain, following the team’s defeat in the second Test against South Africa in Rawalpindi. He is set to join the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) as a consultant for international cricket.The announcement was made by PCB chairman Mohsin Naqvi during a reception for the Pakistan and South African teams at Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif’s residence, according to a report on Friday.“We have appointed Masood as director of international cricket in PCB,” Naqvi said, surprising many as the decision came a week before the deadline for applications for the post.Since Masood plays only Tests, which are scheduled sporadically, he will combine his playing duties with the consultant role.If implemented, this would be the first time at the international level that a player simultaneously holds a position on the Board.However, his appointment raises questions over compliance with the PCB Constitution, which prohibits active players from holding board positions; such roles are officially reserved for retired cricketers.Masood succeeds Usman Wahla, the previous director of international cricket, who was suspended during the Asia Cup after delaying an email concerning a protest against match referee Andy Pycroft.Wahla had advised Pakistan captain Salman Agha not to shake hands with India’s Suryakumar Yadav. The PCB subsequently wrote to the International Cricket Council requesting Pycroft’s removal, which the ICC rejected, instead arranging a meeting between Pakistan team officials and Pycroft, who expressed regret.Wahla, who maintains strong political ties with the ruling Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz), was later reinstated.The PCB had advertised the director role with eligibility criteria requiring candidates to have played both Tests and ODIs for Pakistan.Masood, who has represented the country in 44 Tests, 9 ODIs, and 19 T20Is, meets these qualifications. Local media had suggested former captain Misbah-ul-Haq as a frontrunner for the post, though he declined to apply.",Shan Masood has announced that he will step down as Pakistan’s Test captain.

NEW DELHI: India will look to avoid a clean sweep when they take on Australia in the third and final ODI at the Sydney Cricket Ground on Saturday. After losing the second ODI in Adelaide by two wickets, the visitors are trailing 0-2 in the three-match series and will be eager to end the tour on a high.With just a day’s break between games, India have little time to regroup and must find answers quickly to prevent their first ODI series whitewash since the 2022 tour of South Africa.Rohit Sharma’s fighting 73 and Shreyas Iyer’s composed 61 offered resistance in Adelaide, but the spotlight remains on Virat Kohli’s rare dip in form — having registered back-to-back ducks for the first time in his ODI career. Both senior batters, possibly featuring in their final ODI on Australian soil, will hope to finish the series on a high note.However, the biggest talking point ahead of the Sydney ODI is whether Kuldeep Yadav will finally get a game. The left-arm wrist spinner has been benched for the first two matches, even as Australia’s Adam Zampa spun his side to victory in Adelaide with four wickets and the Player-of-the-Match award.Former cricketer Aakash Chopra believes it’s time for India to bring Kuldeep into the XI, given Sydney’s reputation for assisting spin.“Kuldeep likely to play at Sydney. Perhaps, a slightly spin-friendly surface…could easily come in for a pacer. Given the batting performance in the first two ODIs, I’m not expecting the team to drop a batter for a bowler. Very unlikely,” Chopra wrote on X.India’s combination has looked slightly unbalanced without a seam-bowling all-rounder like Hardik Pandya. Players such as Yashasvi Jaiswal, Kuldeep Yadav, and Prasidh Krishna are waiting in the wings, and a few changes are expected for the final game.India, the top-ranked ODI side, have now lost two matches in a row after an eight-match winning streak. Stand-in captain Shubman Gill faces a key selection test — and giving Kuldeep a chance could be both a tactical and psychological boost.Australia, meanwhile, will be strengthened by the return of wicketkeeper Josh Inglis, while Marnus Labuschagne has exited the squad. Left-arm spinner Matthew Kuhnemann and all-rounder Jack Edwards have been added for the Sydney match. Zampa and pacer Xavier Bartlett — who dismissed Gill and Kohli in Adelaide — will again be crucial as Australia eye a 3-0 sweep at home.: Saturday, October 259:00 AM IST: Sydney Cricket Ground, SydneyStar Sports Network for live TV broadcast and JioHotstar for live streamingThe weather forecast for Saturday looks ideal for cricket in Sydney, according to Accuweather. Temperatures are expected to range from a comfortable 17°C in the morning to a pleasant 25°C during the day. With the pitch expected to improve under the lights, both teams are likely to prefer chasing, aiming for a result rather than a cautious approach.Travis Head, Mitch Marsh (c), Matt Short, Matt Renshaw, Alex Carey (wk), Cooper Connolly, Mitch Owen, Mitchell Starc/Jack Edwards, Xavier Bartlett, Adam Zampa, Josh HazlewoodRohit Sharma, Shubman Gill (c), Virat Kohli, Shreyas Iyer, Axar Patel, KL Rahul (wk), Nitish Kumar Reddy/Dhruv Jurel, Washington Sundar/Kuldeep Yadav, Harshit Rana/Prasidh Krishna, Mohammad Siraj, Arshdeep Singh: Shubman Gill (captain), Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, Shreyas Iyer, KL Rahul (wk), Axar Patel, Washington Sundar, Nitish Kumar Reddy, Mohammed Siraj, Harshit Rana, Arshdeep Singh, Dhruv Jurel (wk), Yashasvi Jaiswal, Kuldeep Yadav, and Prasidh Krishna.: Mitchell Marsh (captain), Xavier Bartlett, Alex Carey (wk), Cooper Connolly, Jack Edwards, Nathan Ellis, Josh Hazlewood, Travis Head, Josh Inglis (wk), Matthew Kuhnemann, Mitchell Owen, Josh Philippe, Matthew Renshaw, Matthew Short, Mitchell Starc, and Adam Zampa.","India will look to avoid a clean sweep when they take on Australia in the third and final ODI at the Sydney Cricket Ground on Saturday.

NEW DELHI: Amid the handshake controversy, the no-trophy celebration, alleged disrespect during India’s national anthem, India’s Asia Cup triumph, retaining India’s title-winning trophy in his possession, and sudden changes in Pakistan’s captaincy, one figure dominated the headlines — PCB chief Mohsin Naqvi.The Asia Cup final was a spectacle of chaos and controversy. India refused to accept the winning trophy from Naqvi, who then walked off with it, while Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha tossed the runners-up cheque. The dramatic events overshadowed the on-field action, leaving cricket fans stunned.Despite the turmoil, India secured their ninth Asia Cup title overall (ODIs + T20Is) and their second in the T20I format.In the aftermath, Naqvi made sweeping decisions in Pakistan cricket. He appointed Shaheen Shah Afridi as the new ODI captain, replacing Mohammad Rizwan. Soon after, Naqvi announced that Shan Masood, stepping down as Pakistan Test captain, would join the PCB as a consultant for international cricket.From trophy controversies to captaincy shake-ups, the Mohsin Naqvi-led PCB continues to make headlines for all the wrong reasons.Tensions flared from the start as India captain Suryakumar Yadav and Pakistan skipper Salman Ali Agha refused to shake hands. Naqvi was present but largely in the backdrop.After India’s win, players refused to accept the trophy from Mohsin Naqvi, who waited on stage for nearly 20 minutes as the ceremony stalled.The ceremony was delayed by over an hour when Naqvi walked off with the trophy, leaving the champions empty-handed.Indian fans reacted angrily, chanting “Bharat Mata Ki Jai” and repeatedly booing Naqvi.Organisers arranged for Khalid Al Zarooni, vice-chairman of the Emirates Cricket Board, to hand over the trophy instead.The Naqvi vs India episode became the defining controversy of the final, overshadowing even Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha’s antics.During the ACC meeting on September 30, various reports surfaced claiming that Naqvi had apologised to the BCCI for the chaos that unfolded after the Asia Cup final.Naqvi later claimed he never apologised to the BCCI for the trophy-lifting fiasco. In his outlandish statement, a defiant Naqvi set a bizarre condition: if India “truly” wanted the trophy, they could come to the ACC office to collect it from him.The Asia Cup trophy has been locked at the ACC’s Dubai headquarters with instructions that it should not be moved or handed over without the Chairman’s approval.In a major shake-up ahead of Pakistan’s three-match ODI series against South Africa from November 4–8 at Faisalabad’s Iqbal Stadium, pacer Shaheen Shah Afridi was appointed as ODI captain, replacing wicket-keeper batter Mohammad Rizwan. Naqvi faced criticism for frequent captaincy changes, having removed Shaheen earlier in 2024, reinstated Babar Azam, and then appointed Rizwan months ago.The BCCI and PCB are headed for a showdown at next month’s ICC meeting as Naqvi refuses to budge on personally handing over the Asia Cup trophy to India in his capacity as ACC head. In a reply to the BCCI and other ACC member nations, Naqvi insisted he is willing to organise a ceremony on November 10 in Dubai, where a BCCI representative and any available Indian player can collect the trophy.""The ACC trophy rightly belongs to the Indian cricket team and is being held in trust till such time that a BCCI office holder along with any available participating player can collect the same from the ACC President,"" Naqvi wrote.""Such collection would of course be accompanied with much fanfare and coverage as there should be no deviation from established practices and no precedent should be set which undermines the spirit of the game we all love.""Naqvi has offered to organise an event in Dubai on November 10, where the Asia Cup can be officially handed over to the Indian men’s cricket team. The proposal follows a series of exchanges between the ACC and BCCI.Shan Masood is set to step down as Pakistan Test captain, announcing his decision a day after losing the second match against South Africa in Rawalpindi. He will soon join the PCB as a consultant for international cricket. The announcement was made by Naqvi.","Mohsin Naqvi has been at the centre of a series of controversies.

NW DELHI: Former India cricketer Mohammad Kaif has urged the team management to include either Harshit Rana or Nitish Kumar Reddy in the playing XI, while criticising the decision to leave out Kuldeep Yadav from the first two ODIs against Australia. India suffered a two-wicket defeat in the second ODI, giving Australia an unassailable 2-0 lead in the three-match series, with the final game set to be played in Sydney on Saturday.Kaif shared his thoughts on his YouTube channel, expressing doubts about Harshit Rana’s bowling strengths and pointing out the lack of a standout delivery in his arsenal.""I'm following Harshit Rana a lot, but he does not have a strength delivery. It's not like he has a solid outswinger or an inswinger. When we speak about Siraj or Bumrah, they have their strengths, like their yorkers, pace, or slower ones. But I can't figure out what Harshit Rana's strength is. It's not like he bowls over 140. Play either one of Rana or Reddy, because both of them can't play together. Kuldeep Yadav sitting out for this is a clear injustice,"" Kaif stated.Kaif further explained that while Rana performs effectively when the required run rate is high, he struggles when batters adopt a more cautious approach.""When the required rate is 9 or 10 runs per over, there Harshit Rana is effective because his strength is change of pace.But when batters are playing like Test cricket when the required rate is around 5 or 6 runs per over, the bowler has to bring more skills to outfox the batter when he is playing in 3rd gear.""Citing Adam Zampa’s match-winning spell as an example, Kaif said Kuldeep’s exclusion cost India dearly. Zampa took four wickets and was named player of the match in Adelaide.""If Kuldeep was in the team, I guarantee you 100 percent that India would have won this game. When Zampa can come in and change the game by dismissing some big names, when there was grip and turn from the surface, then think what Kuldeep could have done against this inexperienced Australian middle order. This is a do-or-die match, you are not playing him, and Zampa, who was not even there in the last match, returned and took the man of the match. Kuldeep Yadav is a thousand times better bowler than Adam Zampa.""","Former India cricketer Mohammad Kaif has urged the team management to include either Harshit Rana or Nitish Kumar Reddy in the playing XI. India suffered a two-wicket defeat in the second ODI, giving Australia an unassailable 2-0 lead in the three-match series. The final game is set to be played in Sydney on Saturday.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124797059,imgsize-48026,width-400,resizemode-4/gambhir-gill-2510-afp.jpg"

Rohit Sharma's record-breaking knock vs Virat Kohli’s duck | India vs Australia 2nd ODI

In their 1,068-match ODI history, India have suffered five whitewashes in bilateral series — 1983 vs West Indies (5-0), 1989 vs West Indies (5-0), 2006 vs South Africa (4-0), 2020 vs New Zealand (3-0), and 2022 vs South Africa (3-0). Saturday could be the sixth if head coach Gautam Gambhir and captain Shubman Gill do not get their act together at a venue where India have suffered 16 losses out of 19 against Australia — the Sydney Cricket Ground.Sydney was the venue where Virat Kohli last played for India in Tests. It was also the venue where Rohit Sharma dropped himself from the final Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy last year, only to never play for India again in whites. If the raised gloves, an act of silent acknowledgment of the appreciative Adelaide crowd during his walk back to the pavilion after registering his second successive duck, were any hint, then Sydney could be the last time the Aussies could see Kohli live in India colours.It was the same venue where he had infamously flipped the bird to an abusive section of fans during his first visit back in 2011.If we keep the BGT aside, Rohit Sharma will have some pleasant memories in Australia’s most buzzing city. He is the only player in the Indian set-up who was part of both the wins that India have had over the Aussies at the SCG. In the 2008 CB Tri-Series first final, he made an 87-ball 66 and shared a 123-run stand for the fourth wicket with Sachin Tendulkar (117*) to help India chase down 240.In 2016, as an established white-ball opener, Rohit scored a 108-ball 99 and added 97 with player-of-the-match Manish Pandey (104*) to help India avoid a whitewash and chase down 331 with two balls to spare.That match also marked the legendary Jasprit Bumrah’s international debut. He had been picked to play only the three-match T20I series that was to follow the ODIs, but an injury-plagued bowling attack meant Bumrah had to literally step out of the plane, strap his bowling boots on, and play. He made an instant impact with 2 for 40 from his 10 overs.Bumrah will be in town again, having landed with the T20 team on Friday. But expect no favours this time around. He will be there only for the T20Is.And truth be told, the combinations India have fielded in the two ODIs Down Under and the tactics they have employed, they deserve no favours. Bulking up the batting line-up by picking three all-rounders and going thin on the bowling resources, and making a match-winner like Kuldeep Yadav warm the bench, was a strategy that was bound to backfire on the firmer and truer surfaces of Australia.Harshit Rana may have made a buccaneering contribution with the bat in Adelaide and may have bowled incisively in his first spell in which he got Travis Head out, but the way his pace dropped after he came back for the second spell, with his execution of slower cutters all over the place, making him cannon fodder for Mitch Owen, suggests that he still does not have it in him to play for India across formats. Some more miles in the legs by playing in domestic cricket may be the way to go.India can try the option of using Prasidh Krishna, a tall, hit-the-deck operator, to replace Rana, and with the series already gone, they could be more uninhibited and try out Yashasvi Jaiswal at the top. The team management should also ponder whether they are making optimum use of KL Rahul at No. 6.Axar Patel is a fantastic multi-skilled cricketer, but he is no Brian Lara or Yuvraj Singh to consistently get a gig at No. 5 on surfaces that are helpful for bowlers. Maybe Rahul, who averages 56.47 in 31 innings at that spot and has a strike rate of 96.36 there, is a better option. India’s depth in white-ball cricket, thanks to the IPL, is often the envy of teams all over the world. In Adelaide, the Aussies showed off that the Big Bash isn’t far behind as a talent stable. Matt Short (Adelaide Strikers), Cooper Connolly (Perth Scorchers), and Mitch Owen (Hobart Hurricanes) silenced their IPL counterparts.India’s record in bilateral ODIs post the 2019 World Cup hasn’t been great. They have lost series to New Zealand (away), South Africa (away), Bangladesh (away), Sri Lanka (away), and Australia (twice — away and once at home).Time for the bragging to end. There is work to do.","Sydney was the venue where Virat Kohli last played for India in Tests.

Two Australian Women Cricketers Stalked and Molested in Indore; Police Arrest Accused Amid Outrage

Two Australian women cricketers were harassed and inappropriately touched by a motorcyclist while walking to a café in Indore on Thursday morning, Cricket Australia confirmed. The accused, identified as Akil Khan, was promptly arrested, and investigations are ongoing.Cricket Australia stated: “CA can confirm two members of the Australian Women’s team were approached and touched inappropriately by a motorcyclist while walking to a café in Indore. The matter was reported by team security to police, who are handling the matter.”The incident occurred around 11 am, roughly half a kilometre from the players’ hotel. The motorcyclist reportedly followed them, inappropriately touched one player, and fled the scene. The players immediately informed their team security officer, Danny Simmons, who coordinated with local security and arranged a vehicle to ensure their safety.Police investigations involved reviewing CCTV footage, hotel records, and statements from security personnel and witnesses. A bystander’s information on the motorcycle’s number plate helped authorities track down Khan.He was arrested on Friday and has been charged under Sections 74 (use of criminal force to outrage a woman’s modesty) and 78 (stalking) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita. Police noted that Khan has prior criminal cases registered against him.Speaking on the incident, Madhya Pradesh state minister Kailash Vijayvargiya said: “This is not just misbehaviour with a woman player, but a stain on India’s image. Strictest action must be taken against those responsible so that no one dares to tarnish the nation’s reputation in the future.” He also reiterated the government’s zero-tolerance stance and called for a punishment that serves as an example.The Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ) strongly condemned the incident. Secretary Devajit Saikia described it as “very condemnable but stray” and reaffirmed the board’s commitment to player safety. “India is known for its hospitality and care. We have zero tolerance for such incidents. We appreciate the State Police (Madhya Pradesh) for their prompt action to nab the culprit. Let the law take its course to punish the culprit. We assure to revisit our safety protocols if required to further tighten the security,” he said.Meanwhile, the Australian team continued their strong World Cup campaign, defeating South Africa by seven wickets in their final group-stage match in Indore. The win ensured they topped the group with 13 points from seven games, setting up a semi-final clash against Harmanpreet Kaur’s India.The incident has sparked outrage, highlighting the need for enhanced security measures for visiting teams and raising questions about player safety during international tournaments in India.","Two Australian women cricketers were harassed and inappropriately touched by a motorcyclist while walking to a café in Indore on Thursday morning.

Poll How important is a fresh start for players in cricket? Very important Somewhat important Not very important Not important at all

At the end of the third One-Day at the Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG), former India coach Ravi Shastri shared a heartfelt moment with two former India captains — Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma During the post-match conversation, Shastri remarked to the duo, ""You two old dogs still have a sting in the tail.""Rohit responded to Shastri's comment, saying, ""Looks like it, yes. We enjoy our cricket, most importantly, no matter what accolades we've achieved. But it's important that whenever you get an opportunity to play, you've got to come and start fresh. And that's what we did when we arrived in Perth — forget what has happened in the last 15–17 years, we always wanted to start fresh, and that's how I personally look at all the games that I play. I'm sure it'll be the same for Virat as well, but I enjoyed playing these three games.""Shastri also teased Kohli about the two ducks he had registered in this series at Perth and Adelaide.""Fortunately, the ducks have gone off the pond. It is good to be out of the pond,"" Kohli laughed.""It's so challenging when things aren't going your way. Situations in the middle get the best out of me. Tonight, it was one of those situations.""You scored a lot of runs in international cricket, but then the game shows you everything — even at this age, almost 37 in not many days, it can still feel like not knowing how to get runs.This game is amazing.""We love batting. We love batsmanship. It is so challenging when it is not going your way. When Rohit is already batting there, it becomes easy for you to get there in the middle and rotate strikes. I enjoyed the partnership, enjoyed batting with Rohit. Glad it was a match-winning and finishing stand.""Very early on, we understood the game very well. I think from early on, we've understood the situation well; that's what we have always done well as a pair. We were probably the most experienced pair now, but back in the day, when we were young, we knew we could take the game away from them with big partnerships.""That is something we have taken great pride in. It is just about the communication. If we put up a big partnership, play around 20 overs, we know we'll go a long way in helping the team win, and even the opposition will realize it. It all started from that 2013 Australia series at home. Any total can be chased down, and I always enjoyed batting together.""We have loved coming to this country and played some of our best cricket. The crowd has been brilliant.""","Former India coach Ravi Shastri shared a heartfelt moment with two former India captains — Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma.

Former India captain Sunil Gavaskar has expressed deep anger and disappointment after learning that two Australian women cricketers were harassed in Indore during the ongoing Women’s World Cup 2025. As confirmed by Cricket Australia, the players were “touched inappropriately” by a motorcyclist on Thursday morning while they were walking from their hotel to a nearby café.Police later confirmed that the accused, identified as Akil Khan, was arrested shortly after the players filed a complaint. The incident reportedly took place on Khajrana Road, and the players immediately informed their security liaison officer before the local police intervened.Reacting strongly to the matter, Gavaskar condemned the act, saying such behaviour tarnishes India’s reputation. “Yes, I think because we are famous for, to hear of this is very, very sad,” Gavaskar told India Today. “It is, without question, a heinous incident. The law will take its course, but I do hope that the guilty person is punished severely – you lock them up and throw away the key. That’s the only way, I think.Just lock him up and throw the keys away.”The Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ) also issued a statement condemning the assault, reaffirming its zero-tolerance stance on such incidents. “It is a very condemnable but stray incident.

NEW DELHI: Following pacer Harshit Rana’s brilliant four-wicket haul in India’s win against Australia at Sydney, Indian skipper Shubman Gill lauded the youngster’s performance, highlighting the importance of his role at number eight. Gill emphasised that a bowler who can bat usefully is crucial, especially with South Africa set to host the 2027 ICC Cricket World Cup Overcoming some underwhelming spells earlier in the series, Rana showcased his pace, control over line and length, and wicket-taking ability to perfection, finishing with 4/39 in 8.4 overs as Australia were skittled out for 236. India’s chase was anchored by a 168-run unbeaten second-wicket partnership between Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli .""I think the number 8 position for us, if a batsman can make 20-25 runs and we have the confidence to do it, then it becomes a very important position, and I think if you look at it, there are very few fast bowlers who can bowl 140 plus, so on such wickets. If we look at South Africa, on such wickets such bowlers become very important for you, because I have seen in middle overs that there is not much movement in the ball off the wicket, so if you have a good height and pace then you can create chances, and I think that is what happened, Australia got a very good start, but the way our spinners bowled first, created pressure, and then Harshit bowled with a lot of power and I think he got a good reward for that,"" said Gill.Reflecting on his own form, Gill remained unfazed by his performance in the series.""I don’t think there is much work needed in batting. Sometimes, you do play good shots but get out. In the first match, I was stranded down the leg side. It happens, sometimes you have such two-three matches. While you want to perform in every match, I am not too worried about my performance,"" he said.On India losing their 17th ODI toss in a row, Gill humorously remarked, ""My family is also asking me to practice something on toss.""In the match, Australia batted first after winning the toss. A 61-run opening partnership between skipper Mitchell Marsh (41 off 50 balls, with five fours and a six) and Travis Head (29 off 25 balls, with six fours) set the tone.Matt Short added 30 off 41 balls, and a 59-run stand between Matt Renshaw (56 off 58 balls) and Alex Carey (24 off 37 balls) took Australia to 183/3.However, a collapse saw them all out for 236 in 46.4 overs, with Rana (4/39) and Washington Sundar (2/44) leading the bowling, supported by Siraj, Prasidh Krishna, Axar Patel, and Kuldeep Yadav.India’s chase began with a 69-run opening stand between Shubman Gill (24 off 26 balls) and the rest of the batting lineup. Rohit Sharma (121* off 125 balls) and Virat Kohli (74* off 81 balls) then stitched an unbeaten 168-run partnership, guiding India to victory with nine wickets in hand.Rohit was awarded both 'Player of the Match' and 'Player of the Series' for scoring 202 runs in the series, including a century and a fifty.","Shubman Gill says bowler who can bat usefully is crucial, especially with South Africa set to host the 2027 ICC Cricket World Cup.

Why Virat Kohli in India XI for World Cup 2027 will be bad news | Greenstone Lobo predicts

NEW DELHI: Virat Kohli ’s sister Bhawna Kohli Dhingra shared an emotional message for the star batter after India’s stunning win over Australia in the third ODI at the Sydney Cricket Ground. Taking to Instagram, she posted two heartfelt stories, including a touching video of Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli celebrating India’s victory together. She dedicated the famous Punjabi song by the Wadali Brothers — “Ve mahiya tere vekhan nu, chuk charkha gali de vich panwa, Ve loka paane main kat di, tang teriya yaad de panwa” — as a tribute to her brother’s grit and spirit.At the SCG, Rohit Sharma rolled back the years with a magnificent 121* — his 33rd ODI century — while Virat Kohli found form with an unbeaten 74, guiding India to a commanding nine-wicket win in the final ODI. The duo’s partnership evoked memories of their prime, turning the match into a nostalgic masterclass in batting.Watch the video here Earlier, Australia had started well after opting to bat, but India’s disciplined bowling brought them back into the contest. Young pacer Harshit Rana stood out with figures of 4/39, triggering a middle-order collapse as the hosts were bowled out for 236. Washington Sundar chipped in with two wickets, while Siraj, Kuldeep, Axar, and Prasidh Krishna took one apiece.India’s reply was confident from the start. Rohit and Shubman Gill added 68 runs for the first wicket before Gill was dismissed by Josh Hazlewood.From there, the crowd at Sydney witnessed something special — Rohit and Kohli reunited at the crease, their experience and chemistry shining through.Rohit’s strokeplay was fluent, marked by 13 boundaries and three sixes in his 125-ball stay, while Kohli’s innings was built on patience and precision, laced with seven fours.Their unbroken 168-run stand sealed the game emphatically, helping India chase down the target with 11.3 overs to spare and avoid a clean sweep. The win also served as a reminder of India’s batting depth and the enduring class of its two most celebrated modern-day greats.For Kohli, the day was extra special — he became the second-highest run-getter in ODI history, surpassing Sri Lanka’s Kumar Sangakkara (14,234 runs). The former captain now trails only Sachin Tendulkar (18,426 runs) but boasts a superior average of 57.69 across 305 ODIs, compared to Tendulkar’s 44.83 — reaffirming his status as one of the finest ever to play the game.","Virat Kohli's sister Bhawna Kohli Dhingra shared an emotional message for the star batter after India’s stunning win over Australia in the third ODI at the Sydney Cricket Ground.

MANCHESTER: The crisis is over for Manchester United . For now at least.For Liverpool, however, it is a very different story after a fourth straight loss in the Premier League on Saturday. A 3-2 defeat at Brentford delivered the latest blow to the defending champion's trembling title defense and left it sixth in the standings.United is heading in the opposite direction, a 4-2 win against Brighton moving Ruben Amorim's team up to the heady heights of the top four.Sunderland, though, is providing the unexpected narrative of the season after a stunning comeback 2-1 win at Chelsea saw it climb to second.Liverpool loses again The losses keep on coming for Liverpool.Not even a frantic fightback at the Gtech Community Stadium could prevent coach Arne Slot suffering a fourth straight defeat in the league, a result that leaves his team four points adrift of leader Arsenal, having played a game more.""This is a tough one to take. Unfortunately this was another not nice evening to have,"" said Liverpool captain Virgil van Dijk. ""I am sure we will get out of it, but we won't get out of it by just talking about it.""Brentford led 2-0 after goals from Dango Ouattara and Kevin Schade. Milos Kerkez then got Liverpool back into the game in first-half stoppage time.Igor Thiago's penalty in the second half put Brentford back in control until Mohamed Salah lashed a brilliant shot into the top corner in the 89th.With 11 minutes of added time, the Merseyside club ramped up the pressure in search of an equalizer, but couldn't find a way through.It raises further questions about Liverpool's title defense, coming on the back of defeats against Crystal Palace, Chelsea and United. Not since 1984 has Liverpool successfully retained the title.In all, it was a fifth loss from the last six games in all competitions.Slot said it was the worst performance of all the losses in the league.""We didn't do the basics right, especially the first half, but during parts of the second half as well,"" he told TNT Sports.Amorim reaches winning benchmark at United A third straight win for United extended Amorim's best league run since he was appointed as coach last November, and provided a sense of momentum not felt for a long time at Old Trafford.""I think we are improving in the bad moments,"" he said. ""We can respond in a different way and we feel that we can solve anything. It's so hard and in football, everything can change in one week, so let's enjoy today and focus on the next one.""It was the first time United had won three league games in a row in the same season since February 2024.Victory also ended Brighton's winning streak in this fixture, which dated back three seasons.It is still too early to tell if Amorim has turned a corner after such a wretched start to his tenure, including the 20-time champion's worst-ever season in the Premier League last term.But coming on the heels of last week's morale-boosting win at Liverpool, the signs are positive, even if Brighton sparked a fightback to make it a nervy finish for the home fans.A prime source of encouragement for Amorim is the manner in which his summer signings have added a new dimension.Brazil forward Matheus Cunha scored his first goal for the club with a curling shot from outside the area to give United a 24th-minute lead.Another new signing, Bryan Mbeumo, also scored twice in the second half, making it three in his last two games, after Casemiro had doubled the lead with a deflected effort before the break.""The money was well invested,"" Brighton coach Fabian Hurzeler said.It was a former United player, Danny Welbeck, who gave Brighton hope with a brilliant free kick that flew into the top corner.

Poll Who do you think will win the clasico between Barcelona and Real Madrid? Barcelona Real Madrid Draw

Barcelona travel to Madrid for Sunday’s clasico facing uncertainty over several key players, while Real Madrid are boosted by the return of Trent Alexander-Arnold.Alexander-Arnold, sidelined since mid-September with a left hamstring injury, has been included in Xabi Alonso’s squad for the first time since. Only Antonio Rudiger remains unavailable for Madrid.Barcelona enter the fixture with multiple absences.Raphinha continues to recover from a right leg injury sustained in late September, Robert Lewandowski, Dani Olmo, and first-choice goalkeeper Joan García are also out.Ferran Torres remains a doubt after recently recovering from a muscle strain, while Jules Koundé’s participation will be confirmed at the last moment after missing two training sessions following Barcelona’s 6-1 Champions League win over Olympiakos.Despite the absences, Barcelona midfielder Pedri emphasized the squad’s determination: “Of course I’d love to have everyone available, the coach and the team would too, (but) those of us who are fit will give everything and fight for the three points.”Coach Hansi Flick had hoped Raphinha could return for the big game, but assistant coach Marcus Sorg confirmed the Brazilian winger will not travel with the team.Barcelona now must rely on options such as Marcus Rashford, Roony Bardghji, or Fermín López in a “false nine” role alongside Lamine Yamal.Flick too, will not be on the touchline, serving a suspension from a red card received in the previous round, leaving Sorg to manage the team in the clasico.Real Madrid currently sit two points clear of Barcelona at the top of the La Liga table after nine rounds, heightening the stakes for the encounter at the Santiago Bernabéu.","Trent Alexander-Arnold has been included in Real Madrid's squad for the first time since mid-September.

(ANI)

Argentina's national football team and star player Lionel Messi will not be visiting Kerala in November for a planned friendly match, as confirmed by sponsors following the Argentina Football Association's announcement that the team would only play in Angola next month. This development has ended weeks of anticipation after both the Kerala government and private sponsors had announced a high-profile friendly match scheduled for November 17 in Kochi.Argentine media reports indicate that AFA officials cited Kerala's ""lack of readiness"" and delays in completing logistical arrangements within the agreed timeline as reasons for the cancellation.The organisers have suggested rescheduling the visit to March 2026, though this timing coincides with Kerala's Assembly polls scheduled for April or May of that year.The cancellation has sparked a political controversy, with Congress leadership criticising the state government for announcing the event without formal confirmation from the AFA.The situation highlights challenges in coordinating international sports events, particularly regarding communication between various stakeholders. The cancellation has disappointed Indian football fans, particularly in Kerala, where Argentina and Messi have a substantial following.Messi's last appearance in India was in 2011, when he led Argentina against Venezuela at Kolkata's Salt Lake Stadium in his debut match as national captain.","Argentina's national football team and star player Lionel Messi will not be visiting Kerala in November for a planned friendly match, as confirmed by sponsors.

Marcus Rashford is set to become the first English player since Gary Lineker in the 1980s to feature in El Clasico for Barcelona when they face Real Madrid at Santiago Bernabeu on Sunday. The 27-year-old Manchester United loanee has impressed with five goals and six assists in 12 games, earning his spot after Raphinha's injury.Rashford strengthened his case for a starting position with two goals in Barcelona's 6-1 Champions League victory over Olympiacos on Tuesday.

Barcelona saw an opportunity to add attacking depth without significant financial investment.Rashford chose the number 14 shirt, previously worn by Thierry Henry, upon joining the Spanish champions.""To wear this shirt is an honour and I'm ready to do my best,"" Rashford said.The England international has contributed either a goal or an assist in eight of his last nine games and has taken over free-kick responsibilities.""He's giving me 100 percent of what I want from him,"" Flick commented after Rashford's performance against Olympiacos.Rashford demonstrated his versatility by playing as a central striker in the Olympiacos match, filling in for the injured Robert Lewandowski.The forward faced criticism in September after being dropped for the Getafe match due to arriving two minutes late for a morning meeting.

LEEDS: Nuno Espirito Santo became the first West Ham coach since 2018 to go winless in his first four games as his struggling team showed the same defensive frailties that have plagued it all season in a 2-1 loss to Leeds in the Premier League on Friday.The Portuguese coach joined the Hammers a month ago after leading Nottingham Forest to a place in Europe but he has been unable to turn things around quickly in east London.He now has three losses and one draw since taking over, a record equal to that of Manuel Pellegrini when he took charge of the club in 2018.Off the field, supporters have expressed their discontent with the board, with thousands boycotting Monday night's loss at home to Brentford.The team has defended poorly all season - conceding nine goals from corners, three times more than any other side - leading to the sacking of Graham Potter. And it was 2-0 down after just 15 minutes at Leeds thanks once again to hesitant defending.Goalkeeper Alphonse Areola could not hold Noah Okafor's header after three minutes and US international Brenden Aaronson pounced to sidefoot home the loose ball as the West Ham defenders watched on.The back line was equally lackadaisical 12 minutes later when Joe Rodon headed home unchallenged from a corner kick.Mateus Fernandes' deft header in the final minute gave the Hammers a consolation goal but an equalizer never looked likely.The win lifts Leeds into 13th place on 11 points, while West Ham is 19th with four points and the league's worst goal difference.That points tally is its joint worst at this stage of the season. Only in the 1932-33 and 1973-74 campaigns have the Hammers started as poorly as now.""We're in a real situation and we have to face the reality of that,"" West Ham captain Jarrod Bowen told Sky Sports. ""You have to face up to the reality of where we are and we're in trouble now.""We have to go out there and fight more than anything. The Premier League is the hardest league.

Poll Do you believe placing Sheffield Wednesday into administration was the right decision? Yes, it was necessary. No, it was a mistake.

Struggling Championship side Sheffield Wednesday have entered administration, triggering an automatic 12-point deduction under English Football League (EFL) regulations.The decision leaves the club at the bottom of the table on minus six points, 15 adrift of safety.The club confirmed the move on Friday, announcing the appointment of an insolvency firm to oversee operations.The development follows months of financial uncertainty and repeated protests from supporters demanding the exit of owner Dejphon Chansiri, whose tenure has been marked by controversy and missed wage payments.Joint administrator Kris Wigfield explained the reasoning behind the decision, stating, “Like many football clubs, (Sheffield Wednesday) have been trading at a significant loss for several years, with those losses historically funded by the former owner Mr Chansiri.Due to increased financial pressure on the club, the owner has chosen to place the club and the stadium company into administration which will enable us to market the club and the stadium as a whole, which is great news for supporters of the club.”The EFL, while confirming the 12-point penalty, described the situation as an opportunity for “a successful sale and secure future under new ownership.”Fan discontent had reached a breaking point in recent weeks. Thousands of supporters boycotted the home fixture against Middlesbrough earlier this week, where Wednesday fell to a 1-0 defeat, intensifying calls for Chansiri to sell.The Sheffield Wednesday Supporters’ Trust called it “one of the most bittersweet days in our club’s proud 158-year history,” adding that administration was “the inevitable outcome of years of financial mismanagement, a lack of accountability and repeated failures to engage credible buyers.”Despite the uncertainty, the Trust expressed optimism, noting that there is “strong interest from prospective buyers” and that a fan-led takeover proposal is being prepared to safeguard the club’s future.Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy also weighed in, urging for a quick resolution, saying, “Everyone who loves the club will be hoping for a resolution as soon as possible.”","Sheffield Wednesday have entered administration, triggering an automatic 12-point deduction under English Football League regulations.

Beau Pribula, the starting quarterback for the Missouri Tigers, was taken off the field with a leg injury during the third quarter of Saturday’s road game against Vanderbilt.

The Carolina Panthers are preparing for a pivotal Week 8 showdown against the Buffalo Bills, but their star quarterback, Bryce Young, is facing an uncertain status. After suffering an ankle injury in the team's Week 7 victory over the New York Jets, questions loom about whether Young will be under center this Sunday. Let's delve into the latest updates.Bryce Young sustained a high ankle sprain during the third quarter of the Panthers' 13–6 win against the Jets. He was sacked by Jets defensive tackle Jowon Briggs and was unable to bear weight on his right leg, leading to his exit from the game. An MRI confirmed the high ankle sprain, and despite no structural damage, Young has not practiced at all this week. As of Friday, he was officially listed as doubtful for the Week 8 matchup against the Bills.With Young's status in question, veteran quarterback Andy Dalton is poised to start for the Panthers.

Curtis Meeks and ex-NFL star accused of rigging high-stakes private poker

Chauncey Billups had no idea his name would be pulled into a major FBI gambling case this week involving Mafia-style poker cheating that may have robbed players of more than a million dollars in a single night. Federal agents arrested the Portland Trail Blazers head coach as part of a 31-person sting that exposed a secret high-tech cheating ring backed by New York’s most feared crime families, according to the FBI. The New York Post also spoke with one alleged victim who says he lost $1 million in one night, and blames a former NFL star as the “front man” who lured people into the game.Chauncey Billups, Miami Heat guard Terry Rozier, and former Cleveland Cavaliers player Damon Jones were all arrested this week. The FBI says this was not normal gambling, it was an organized criminal setup connected to the Gambino, Bonanno, and Genovese mafia families.The anonymous victim who spoke to the New York Post said he was invited to what looked like a clean high-stakes poker game because a “trusted ex-NFL player” was involved.When he arrived, the host suddenly doubled the buy-in from $10,000 to $20,000. He says players were surrounded by men who “would not stop pushing us to go all in.”He claims the group used hidden X-ray poker tables, contact lenses that read marked cards, and a secret off-site operator who sent live winning-hand data to players through a “quarterback” at the table.Federal prosecutors said in a press conference that the cheating tech was “shockingly advanced,” using shuffling machines that had been secretly modified to predict winning cards in real time.A photo even surfaced showing Chauncey Billups seated at a poker table with two alleged co-conspirators, first reported by DailyMail . Billups’ lawyer told ESPN he is “a man of integrity” and will fight the charges.Curtis Meeks, one of the 31 arrested, was directly named by the alleged victim. He claims Meeks and others threatened them until they agreed to pay the money they lost. He says they “used the professional athlete to make us feel safe.”Also Read: Donald Trump’s USFL New Jersey Generals Owner Jacket Resurfaces After 40 Years And Could Sell For A Shocking Price The NFL immediately sent a memo to all teams on Thursday reminding players that they are banned from any form of illegal gambling and must report any gambling debt over $10,000.

The Buffalo Bills are gearing up for a big Week 8 clash against the Carolina Panthers, and naturally, all eyes are on Josh Allen. After a brief bye week, Allen is expected to take the field, aiming to shake off two straight losses and get the Bills back on track. Fans are buzzing, will their star quarterback be ready to lead the charge? Let’s break down everything you need to know.Concerns flared after Allen’s Week 6 matchup against the Atlanta Falcons, where he appeared to tweak his hand. Footage showed him frequently shaking it on the sidelines, but Allen has since reassured everyone that he’s fine. Reports confirm that he’s been practicing fully this week with no restrictions, and the Bills haven’t listed any setbacks. All signs point to Allen starting against the Panthers this Sunday.For Buffalo, that’s huge. Allen is the engine that drives this offense, and having him healthy is critical for the team to rebound.Even with the recent bumps, Allen has had a strong season. He’s thrown for over 1,397 yards, racked up 11 touchdowns, and has a passer rating north of 103. His mobility, arm strength, and leadership make him one of the NFL ’s most dangerous quarterbacks, especially in high-pressure situations.The Bills’ coaching staff will rely on him to stay sharp and lead the team in the red zone, particularly against a Panthers defense that can be unpredictable.The following were the expected starting lineups based on reports leading up to the game:Matchup: Buffalo Bills (Away) vs. Carolina Panthers (Home)Kickoff: 1:00 p.m. ETStadium: Bank of America StadiumBeyond just Week 8 standings, this game is a chance for Allen to reassert his dominance and for the Bills to regain momentum in the playoff hunt.

Shadowy schemes resurface as Billups faces allegations in an illegal gambling controversy

The arrests of Miami Heat guard Terry Rozier and Portland Trail Blazers coach Chauncey Billups in a detailed federal gambling probe have rocked the NBA . Billups' indictment as part of a second conspiracy caught the basketball world off guard on Thursday, while Rozier's federal indictment in a gambling investigation occurred months after the NBA veteran was initially linked to the plot. The startling revelation has sparked further worries about the league's connection to legalized gambling.Now the question is, have the Trail Blazers already cut ties with their head coach? Not really. Additionally, there’s no additional information about it. The Blazers did, however, acknowledge the problem in a statement. The franchise’s statement read on X:“We are aware of the allegations involving head coach Chauncey Billups, and the Trail Blazers are fully cooperating with the investigation. Billups has been placed on immediate leave, and Tiago Splitter will assume head coaching duties in the interim.”However, the news release also stated that the Trail Blazers currently wish to disassociate themselves from the coach and the accusations:“Any further questions should be directed to the NBA.”Tiago Splitter has been selected as the interim head coach until the Billups investigation is over, according to ESPN's Shams Charania. Two separate indictments were revealed by federal prosecutors, charging Damon Jones, Terry Rozier, and Chauncey Billups.FBI director Kash Patel said at a federal courthouse:“This is the insider trading saga for the NBA.""About 48 hours have passed since one of the most startling off-court incidents in NBA history happened involving the Portland Trail Blazers. Although Billups has been placed on indefinite leave by the team and his assistant has been named interim head coach , this is hardly a long-term solution. Nevertheless, the team hasn't yet announced their final decision.Billups was indicted for his alleged involvement in a broad, multi-year scheme to cheat card players in gambling . This allegedly involved several members of the Bonano, Gambino, Luchese, and Genovese crime families.According to that indictment, he was allegedly involved in the rigged poker game scam as early as 2019. Prosecutors claim he participated in a game that year that stole at least $50,000 from victims.Billups was not named in Rozier's sports betting-related indictment. However, prosecutors have claimed that there is also a co-conspirator. They have said that the co-conspirator, who lives in Oregon, was reportedly an NBA player from 1997 to 2014 and has been a coach since 2021.The Blazers signed Billups as their head coach in June 2021. Billups was an NBA player from 1997 until 2014. According to that accusation, Rozier intentionally left a game in 2023 so that a fellow conspirator could wager and win.These accusations are related to the continuing investigation that resulted in former Raptors player Jontay Porter entering a guilty plea. Porter reportedly influenced his own performance and placed bets on NBA games in order to help co-conspirators profit from prop bets. In July 2024, Porter was arrested and later entered a guilty plea to one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud.Also read: Terry Rozier net worth: Miami Heat player's NBA journey takes an unexpected turn as he finds himself at the center of a gambling storm","Portland Trail Blazers coach Chauncey Billups has been placed on indefinite leave by the team.

When Kendrick Perkins made an outrageous statement that left ESPN anchor Elle Duncan speechless, the NBA opening night countdown went a little bit wild. Before defending champs the Oklahoma City Thunder and the Houston Rockets' season-opener, Perkins appeared as a guest on SportsCenter. He talked about Kevin Garnett and his contribution to the team, both on and off the court, during his recent appearance on the Out the Mud podcast.When Kendrick Perkins made a strange remark that left ESPN host Elle Duncan speechless, the NBA opening night countdown went slightly awkward. During the same, Perkins revealed:“You’ve got James Harden, he’s 20, Russ [Westbrook], 19, KD 21… When I get there, I am like, ‘Hold on. These young [expletive] are winning without any real chemistry. They ain’t even f**king with each other off the court. Damn! Russ and KD ain’t close?'”At this point, Perkins claimed that he decided to lay the hammer down and set some ground rules. He then said:“I am watching them, they are working. They are getting between the lines … I was like, ‘I gotta separate this s***, man.""Perkins then put all three of them in a group text chain and stated:“Next thing you know, we rent a PJ, go catch a Sunday game together. Then I form a group message again. They like to play boo... So they hung out, played boo, and watched football again…”The NBA expert then chuckled before moving on to the next portion. Perkins, however, chose to end it with a pun of his own. Perkins recalled KG saying to Rivers:“‘Hey Doc, I am going to hold this paint down. If you need me, I am here’.That was it! That was the sacrifice. Set the tone, like ‘hey, no, what I am trying to accomplish, the reason that I am here is bigger than the whole team, it’s bigger than myself.’ Once he set that bar, everybody else had to fall in line.”The 40-year-old, who was once selected in the first round of the NBA draft, then reclined in his chair as Duncan went mute for a few seconds due to embarrassment.After he remarked on Bronny James, Perkins disclosed that he lost many of the friends he had gained while playing in the NBA, including his former colleague LeBron James ""I lost Russ, KD, Bron. I had to speak on the s***, though. And it will be a hard situation, bro. Like we talked about the McDonald’s game, and Bron got mad at me because we were talking about Bronny, about the draft...""He continued:""I really didn’t want to touch on it because I’m like, bro, first of all, we shouldn’t be talking about the 55th pick. I get it, it’s his son, but then we get to diving into it, and then next thing you know, sometimes you get that microphone in front of you…”Even if it means sacrificing friendships in the process, Perkins believes that it is his responsibility to talk candidly about the subjects, like LeBron James, Bronny James and the Lakers Also read: “Clippers look old” – Kendrick Perkins takes a dig at Los Angeles Clippers on signing Chris Paul for one year","ESPN studio went silent after Kendrick Perkins dropped a jaw-dropping confession on air.

LaMelo Ball is officially suiting up for the Charlotte Hornets

LaMelo Ball injury Status vs Philadelphia 76ers (October 25, 2025)

When and Where to Watch Tonight's Charlotte Hornets vs Philadelphia 76ers Game?

as they take on the Philadelphia 76ers on Saturday, October 25, 2025. The star guard has been cleared to play, with his name absent from the team’s latest injury report. This confirms his full availability after briefly dealing with a mild knee contusion during the preseason.After missing the Hornets’ preseason finale as a precaution when he bumped knees with an opponent, Ball returned strong in Charlotte’s season-opening victory over the Brooklyn Nets. The 24-year-old looked sharp and fully recovered, putting up 20 points along with a team-leading eight assists in the Hornets’ 136-117 win.Heading into tonight’s game in Philadelphia, the Hornets are relatively healthy aside from their long-term absences. Grant Williams (ACL) and Josh Green (shoulder) remain sidelined until at least October 26. With Ball back at the helm, Charlotte maintains its offensive rhythm powered by its dynamic trio of Ball, Brandon Miller, and Miles Bridges - who combined for 63 points in their previous outing.The matchup is set for a 7:30 PM ET tipoff at Xfinity Mobile Arena, featuring two undefeated teams looking to build early-season momentum.The Charlotte Hornets will rely heavily on Ball’s playmaking and tempo control to challenge Philadelphia’s transition defense. The Sixers, meanwhile, are dealing with notable roster limitations, as Paul George is sidelined and Joel Embiid is expected to play under a minutes restriction.Charlotte Hornets’ strategy will center around spacing and perimeter efficiency - the same formula that saw them shoot nearly 47% from three-point range on opening night. If Ball, Miller, and rookie Kon Knueppel maintain that shooting rhythm, the Charlotte Hornets could have a strong chance of stealing a road win against a top-tier opponent.For LaMelo Ball, this game carries more significance than just another regular-season appearance. After enduring multiple injury-plagued campaigns, the former Rookie of the Year is out to prove his durability and reaffirm his role as the face of the franchise. Last season’s averages of 25.2 points, 7.4 assists, and 4.9 rebounds per game are a reminder of what he brings to the court when healthy - elite vision, creativity, and control.Also read: Is Chet Holmgren playin tonight vs Atlanta Hawks?

With that much court time early in the season, the Oklahoma City Thunder’s medical team is closely monitoring his workload.Head coach Mark Daigneault and the training staff are expected to make a final call closer to tip-off at 7:30 p.m. ET (5:00 a.m. IST). Fans should keep an eye on pregame warm-ups for any sign of Chet Holmgren’s participation, as his status is expected to come down to a game-time decision.Despite starting the season as defending NBA champions and securing two impressive wins, Oklahoma City’s depth is already being tested. In addition to Holmgren, Cason Wallace (knee sprain) is also questionable for the matchup.Meanwhile, Alex Caruso (concussion protocol), Isaiah Joe (knee contusion), Jalen Williams (recovering from wrist surgery), and Kenrich Williams (knee injury) have all been ruled out.This stretch leaves Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, the reigning MVP, shouldering much of the offensive responsibility once again. Gilgeous-Alexander has been electric to start the year, dropping 35 points against the Rockets and a remarkable 55 points against the Pacers. However, Holmgren’s absence would significantly impact OKC’s defensive structure and spacing, particularly against a Hawks frontcourt anchored by Kristaps Porzingis and Jalen Johnson.If Chet Holmgren is unable to play, Daigneault may rely on Isaiah Hartenstein or Jaylin Williams (if available) to absorb the center minutes. While Hartenstein offers hustle and rebounding, he lacks Holmgren’s elite shot-blocking and perimeter shooting abilities. Losing Holmgren would also hurt the Oklahoma City Thunder’s ability to defend the Hawks’ pick-and-roll schemes, orchestrated by Trae Young.Without their rim protector, Oklahoma City’s defense may be forced to collapse more frequently inside, potentially leaving shooters like Bogdan Bogdanović and De’Andre Hunter open from the perimeter. The Thunder would not only lose a physical edge but also a psychological one, as Holmgren’s presence in the paint often alters opponents’ offensive rhythm.Historically, Holmgren has performed well against Atlanta, averaging 15.0 points, 7.0 rebounds, and 2.8 assists across four career games. His combination of size, mobility, and shooting range has made him a matchup challenge for the Hawks’ bigs, and Oklahoma City will hope he can replicate that success if cleared to play.As of now, Chet Holmgren remains questionable for Saturday’s contest, though there’s optimism he could be cleared if he passes pregame evaluations. The Oklahoma City Thunder are likely to take a balanced approach, prioritizing Holmgren’s long-term health while aiming to maintain their early-season rhythm.If he’s able to suit up, Chet Holmgren’s return would provide a huge boost to Oklahoma City’s frontcourt and defensive identity. If not, expect the Thunder to make tactical adjustments to compensate for the absence of their versatile young big man.Also read: Oklahoma City Thunder vs Atlanta Hawks injury report (October 25, 2025): Who,s playing, who's out, and more In short: Holmgren is questionable but trending toward a game-time decision due to lower back soreness as the Oklahoma City Thunder prepare to face the Atlanta Hawks.","Chet Holmgren is listed as questionable for the Oklahoma City Thunder’s game against the Atlanta Hawks on Saturday, October 25, 2025.

Oklahoma City Thunder and Atlanta Hawks

Oklahoma City Thunder Injury Report vs Atlanta Hawks (October 25, 2025)

Atlanta Hawks Injury Report vs Oklahoma City Thunder (October 25, 2025)

What to Expect Tonight from Oklahoma City Thunder vs Atlanta Hawks

Thesquare off tonight, October 25, 2025, at State Farm Arena in what’s shaping up to be a compelling early-season matchup - though one clouded by mounting injuries on both sides. The reigning NBA champions, Oklahoma City, remain undefeated at 2-0 but arrive in Atlanta severely depleted. Meanwhile, the Atlanta Hawks are managing their own injury challenges as they look to hand the Thunder their first loss of the young season.The Oklahoma City Thunder’s depth will once again be put to the test, with eight players listed on the latest injury report.• Chet Holmgren (low back soreness): The second-year big man is questionable after logging heavy minutes in back-to-back double-overtime games. Holmgren recently posted 15 points and 12 rebounds against Indiana but has been experiencing back tightness since.• Jalen Williams (wrist surgery): The versatile forward and key playmaker remains out, forcing Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Josh Giddey to take on even greater ball-handling and scoring responsibilities.• Cason Wallace (left knee sprain): The rookie guard, who sat out the previous contest, is questionable and will undergo evaluations prior to tip-off.• Alex Caruso (concussion protocol): The defensive specialist and veteran leader is still unavailable, leaving a void in Oklahoma City’s perimeter defense.• Isaiah Joe (left knee contusion): The sharpshooter will not suit up, further thinning the Oklahoma City Thunder’s backcourt depth.• Kenrich Williams (knee surgery): Continues his recovery and is expected to miss several more weeks.• Nikola Topic (groin surgery): Still rehabbing from offseason surgery and not close to a return.• Thomas Sorber (torn ACL): The rookie big man is sidelined for the entire season.Despite being severely shorthanded, Oklahoma City continues to perform at an elite level, powered by the sensational play of Shai Gilgeous-Alexander. The MVP frontrunner erupted for 55 points in the team’s last game against the Pacers, carrying the offense through fatigue and adversity. If Holmgren is held out, expect Jaylin Williams and Aaron Wiggins to see expanded roles in the frontcourt, with Lu Dort providing his trademark defensive intensity and hustle.Atlanta Hawks’ list of absences is shorter but still crucial as the team looks to find consistency early in the season.• Kristaps Porzingis (flu-like symptoms): The newly acquired big man is listed as day-to-day and will likely be a game-time decision. His absence would significantly impact the Atlanta Hawks’ spacing, rim protection, and interior scoring options.• Zaccharie Risacher (right ankle sprain): The rookie forward remains questionable after missing the team’s previous game against the Orlando Magic.If both Porzingis and Risacher are unavailable, Atlanta will rely heavily on Trae Young and Dejounte Murray to generate offense and pace the game. Jalen Johnson and Clint Capela are also expected to shoulder more scoring and rebounding responsibilities to offset the potential losses.This matchup carries a classic “grit versus grind” feel - a test of depth, resilience, and endurance for both sides. Oklahoma City, despite its lengthy injury list, enters the night with immense confidence following consecutive wins that required extra periods of play. Gilgeous-Alexander’s elite efficiency and leadership continue to drive the Oklahoma City Thunder’s offense, while rookie Cason Wallace’s possible return could add much-needed defensive balance.On the other side, the Atlanta Hawks - sitting at 1-1 - aim to exploit the Oklahoma City Thunder’s depleted lineup by attacking mismatches and pushing the tempo. A healthy Porzingis would give Atlanta a significant edge in floor spacing and rim protection, but if he’s unable to go, head coach Quin Snyder may lean on a smaller, faster rotation to pressure Oklahoma City’s fatigued starters.Tonight’s showdown between the Oklahoma City Thunder and Atlanta Hawks is more than just another regular-season contest - it’s a glimpse into how two promising teams handle early-season adversity. For Oklahoma City, this is an opportunity to showcase the depth and composure that powered their championship run, even without several key contributors. For Atlanta, it’s a chance to prove they can contend with the league’s elite, even when not at full strength.Also read: Is Chet Holmgren playin tonight vs Atlanta Hawks?

The appointment comes more than two years after Gill’s last T20I outing in July 2023, when he had also served as deputy to Suryakumar Yadav T20I captain Suryakumar Yadav was asked about Gill being chosen ahead of Axar Patel , who had been vice-captain in Gill’s absence.""The last time he played T20Is for India was when we went to Sri Lanka after the T20 World Cup, not Zimbabwe. I was leading, he was vice-captain, and that's where we started the new cycle for T20 World Cup. After that, he got busy with all the Test series. So, he didn't get the opportunity to play anywhere in T20Is as he got busy playing Test cricket, as well as the Champions Trophy. So, he is there in the squad and they are happy to have him,"" Suryakumar said at the press conference.Gill’s elevation comes on the back of a promising start as India’s Test captain during the recent series against England.The eight-team Asia Cup will be played in Abu Dhabi and Dubai.

India Asia Cup squad press conference: What Ajit Agarkar, Surya said on shocking calls

NEW DELHI: Former India cricketer and commentator Mohammad Kaif has raised concerns over Axar Patel losing the vice-captaincy of the Indian T20I side, with Shubman Gill taking over the role. Patel, who was named deputy to Suryakumar Yadav for the five-match series against England earlier this year, was replaced following Gill’s return to T20Is after a year-long absence.Taking to social media, Kaif questioned the manner in which the change was handled.""I hope Axar Patel was informed about his removal from vice-captaincy in advance and he didn't come to know about it from the press conference. Axar did no wrong so he deserves an explanation,"" Kaif posted.Patel has cemented his place as a dependable all-rounder across formats, making key contributions in India’s T20 World Cup 2024 triumph. He was named Player of the Match in the semi-final against England for his spell of 3/23.In the final against South Africa, Patel played another pivotal role, scoring 47 off 31 balls when India were reeling at 34/3, and later dismissing Tristan Stubbs to tilt the game in India’s favor.Overall, Patel’s T20I record highlights his consistency — 531 runs at a strike rate of 139.32, along with 71 wickets at an average of 22.12 from 71 matches.For the upcoming Asia Cup , India’s selectors have included two other spinners, Kuldeep Yadav and Varun Chakravarthy, in the squad.Among the notable exclusions are Shreyas Iyer and Yashasvi Jaiswal.

Asia Cup 2025: India Squad Announced | Surya Named Captain, Gill Vice-Captain

CHENNAI: Prithvi Shaw was Shubman Gill’s captain in the U-19 World Cup that India won in New Zealand in 2018. Seven years down the line, Gill is on the cusp of the Indian senior team’s all-format captaincy while Shaw, once touted as a ‘boy wonder’ and the ‘next big thing’, is trying to make a comeback into the first-class fold after losing his way. Question marks over fitness, form and discipline took a huge toll on the opener as he got dropped from the Mumbai Ranji squad last year and went unsold in the IPL 2025 auction.Now he is back in the domestic scene where it all began, this time turning out for Maharashtra instead of Mumbai. Shaw, who had scored a ton on his India Test debut, announced his comeback in familiar fashion with a well-paced century (111, 141b; 15x4, 1x6) against Chhattisgarh on Day Two of the Buchi Babu tournament here on Tuesday.The 25-year-old sounded optimistic about the upcoming domestic season and said he was ‘confident’ of making a comeback. “I don’t mind starting from scratch again because I’ve seen many ups and downs in my life. I’ve been up there and been down there. I’ve also come back up there. So, everything is possible. I’m confident of myself, my work ethic. And my family has been the biggest support in my tough times. Hopefully, I’ll get back there soon.I hope that this season goes really well for me as well as for my team,” said Shaw.During his knock, as he entered the nervous nineties, the right-hander danced down the track to launch a stunning six. Shaw said he was going back to basics and taking each day as it comes. “I don’t want to change anything (from the past few years). It wasn’t anything like that. I feel I just went back to basics, doing the things I used to do in my Under-19 days, which got me into the Indian team. I’m just doing all that stuff back again. I’m trying to be myself and trying not to be on social media or any of those kinds of distractions. It’s kind of peaceful when I’m not using it.”Shaw has started to get his belief back. “I feel I have never lost. It’s always about learning. Earlier, I was trying to think about the future and I don’t think it worked for me. So now what I’m trying to do is go day by day. I try to be in the present; I’m that kind of person right now.”When asked if he received any messages or calls from the cricket fraternity during his ‘tough times’, pat came the reply with a smile: “No one.” “It’s fine...I don’t want anyone’s sympathy. I’ve seen this before as well. I’ve had my family’s support and my friends who were there with me when I was not really well mentally. Obviously, people are busy doing their work and they have their family as well. So it didn’t bother me at all because I had my family and then I was practising. I was in that zone where I was doing everything alone and it was really good for me. It was working for me.”Having steered Maharashtra to 217, Shaw could well have stayed back in the Guru Nanak pavilion, but after a quick massage, he chose to field for the last five overs. He said he has also been focusing on his fitness in the build-up to the season. “These two-three months, I had my trainer come personally and train me, and I’ve got a dietician as well who plans all my meals. All this over the last three-four months has really changed me physically and mentally. And maybe it can be seen on the field,” said Shaw, who was running briskly between the wickets earlier in the day.",Prithvi Shaw scores century for Maharashtra against Chhattisgarh in Buchi Babu tournament.

Poll Which player seems most likely to take the gloves in the Asia Cup? Sanju Samson Jitesh Sharma

Former India batter Aakash Chopra believes Shubman Gill ’s return to the side has all but ended Sanju Samson ’s chances of finding a place in the playing XI for the Asia Cup in the UAE.“India seems to be moving in the direction of an all-format captain. With Shubman Gill’s return, Sanju Samson’s fate has more or less been sealed. He will not feature in the playing XI now. You will not drop Tilak Varma or Hardik Pandya , which means Samson sits out and Jitesh Sharma will likely get the nod again. One thing is very clear from this selection, the batting slots have been prioritised over personalities. With Gill coming in as vice-captain, he will definitely play and open the batting. This essentially pushes Sanju Samson out of the XI,” Chopra said on JioHotstar.The announcement of Gill as vice-captain has once again placed a question mark over Samson’s future in T20 internationals. Samson has been included in the squad, but Gill’s return has raised doubts about whether the Kerala batter will make the playing XI.The speculation has grown stronger after chief selector Ajit Agarkar read out the names in a particular order. Gill and Jitesh Sharma were mentioned first, while Samson and Rinku Singh were named towards the end.Many see this as an indication that Gill will open alongside Abhishek Sharma, while Jitesh may take the gloves and bat in the finisher’s role.With Tilak Varma, Suryakumar Yadav , Shivam Dube, Hardik Pandya and Axar Patel expected to fill the middle-order positions, Samson’s opportunities look limited. Jitesh could also be preferred over Rinku Singh as a late-order pinch-hitter.Agarkar, however, played down the debate, saying the final XI would be decided by the captain and coach once the team reaches Dubai. “The captain-coach will take the call on the best balance for the team. Once we get to Dubai, we will have a bit more clarity. With more options available now, Shubman has been in great form for the last few months. So has Sanju, so two good options, along with Abhishek,” Agarkar said.Skipper Suryakumar Yadav added weight to Jitesh Sharma’s case, praising his transformation as a batter over the past year. “Post the last T20 World Cup, we spoke a lot on how to go about it. We said let’s not think of milestones ahead, follow your journey. He has been a completely different cricketer post that. The way he performed in the IPL and domestic tournaments, he has earned his spot again,” Surya said.The captain also defended the selection of pacer Harshit Rana, highlighting his consistency. “He has played really well in the IPL. In Pune, he came in as a concussion replacement and was Man of the Match in the last game he played for India. We back his skills, we know he can deliver,” Surya added.With both the chief selector and captain offering different signals, Samson faces another nervous wait. For now, his inclusion in the squad is not under question, but his place in the XI looks increasingly uncertain.","Former India batter Aakash Chopra believes Shubman Gill’s return to the side has all but ended Sanju Samson ’s chances of finding a place in the playing XI for the Asia Cup in the UAE. “India seems to be moving in the direction of an all- format captain.

You have to let someone out. When you talk to them, you have to go through that sadness and disappointment in their faces. I hope, someone has talked to Shreyas and Jaiswal,"" Ashwin said on his YouTube channel ""Ash Ki Baat"".Iyer, who successfully led Kolkata Knight Riders to the IPL title in 2024, was not selected, along with young opener Jaiswal.""When you have Jaiswal as your third opener, you have brought Shubman Gill in the team by removing a person from the World Cup winning squad. I mean, I am happy for Shubman but I am very, very sad for both Shreyas and Jaiswal. It's just not fair on both,"" Ashwin added.""Look at the credentials of Shreyas Iyer. He went out of the team. But came in the Champions Trophy and did amazing batting. He won and gave it to you. If the answer is that Shubman Gill is in blasting form, Shreyas Iyer is also in high-quality form.Jaiswal's innings on a tricky pitch in the last game in the Oval... he is also in cracking form. So, how can you give an answer for this? What Shreyas has done wrong... he did brilliantly well for KKR, made them win. He was sent into the auction. He then took Punjab to the finals for the first time since 2014. He overcame the short ball problem. He was hitting the likes of Kagiso Rabada and Jasprit Bumrah with ease in the IPL. I am just extremely sad for him and Yashasvi Jaiswal; it is extremely unfair.""Iyer has represented India in 51 T20Is, scoring 1104 runs with an average of 30.66 and a strike rate of 136.12.His last T20I appearance was against Australia in December 2023.Iyer's IPL leadership record includes guiding Delhi Capitals to the playoffs in 2019 and their first final in 2020, before leading KKR to victory last year.Former India assistant coach Abhishek Nayar has also criticized the selection decision.""I can't fathom or understand what reason could justify Shreyas Iyer not being part of the 20-member squad,"" Nayar told JioHotstar. ""I'm not even talking about the final 15, but the 20 itself, which sends a clear message, that Shreyas Iyer is not in the selectors' scheme of things, at least from a T20 perspective.""Nayar suggests that Gill's appointment as vice-captain indicates future leadership plans.""This squad announcement sort of tells you the mindset of the selectors. With selection of Shubman, in time, he is going to be an all-format captain, and that's where they are sort of positioning him. Great pick, terrific player. I'm sure he's going to follow the mindset of being attacking, having that approach. And I feel it's going to be a very, very interesting next 12 months in Shubman Gill's life,"" he explained.The selection committee has included pace bowler Jasprit Bumrah despite recent workload concerns, with a West Indies series approaching in early October.""We all need to understand that Bumrah is a prized asset. He is the difference between winning and not winning a championship, and that must be respected,"" Nayar said.""His workload and his body must be respected, because when you don't have him in crucial matches, the impact is massive. Whatever the plan is, no one knows it better than Bumrah himself. He'll be the best judge of what his body can handle and can communicate that with the selectors and team management. Knowing him and having spent time with him, I can tell you nothing matters more to him than performing well and winning championships for India.

NEW DELHI: Under ominous black clouds casting their spell over Delhi’s skyline, the Subroto Cup, India's oldest national school football tournament, roared to life with its 64th edition at the Ambedkar Stadium on Tuesday.Despite heavy rain in the morning hours of the day, leaving carpets soaked and the turf damp, hundreds of students and army officers in the stands cheered on to undo the damage dealt by the weather.Olympian and Arjuna Award-winning shooter Anjum Moudgil, the guest of honour for the opening ceremony, drew an exciting comparison between team sports like football and something deeply individual like shooting.While shooting remains less accessible compared to team sports like football in India, she said that individual sports are more lucrative than playing for a team.That difference, she said, lies at the heart of how recognition comes to athletes.“Yes, they are different in terms of recognition. When you win a medal, obviously you get more attention than a team,” she told TimesofIndia.com on the sidelines of the Subroto Cup.The words of the former world number one in 50m 3 position rifle come at a time when Indian shooters are riding a wave of success.Manu Bhaker set the tone at the Paris 2024 Olympics with two bronze medals, while Suruchi Singh, Arya Borse, Arjun Babuta, Sift Kaur Samra and Elavenil Valarivan all made their mark at the ISSF World Cup of late.On Tuesday, Bhaker added another bronze at the Asian Shooting Championships in Kazakhstan.On the pitch, however, the first match of the tournament lived up to its billing.Arunachal Pradesh edged past Sainik School 1-0 in the junior girls’ category, thanks to an early first-half strike.Sainik School had two goals ruled out for offside, but the contest brimmed with spirit, making it a fitting start to a competition that continues to nurture India’s next generation of footballers.With the Subroto Cup bringing in yet another generation of talented footballers, and shooters continuing to collect medals on the international stage, India’s sporting future looks brighter than ever.The junior girls’ competition runs until August 28, with the sub-junior boys and junior boys categories set to follow. The tournament comes to a close on September 25, with the final of the junior boys category.","Subroto Cup, India's oldest national school football tournament, roared to life with its 64th edition at the Ambedkar Stadium on Tuesday.

KOLKATA: Mohun Bagan Super Giant are on a collision course with the All India Football Federation. A day after crashing out of the Durand Cup, the Indian Super League champions have decided to put their foot down in releasing their players for the ongoing national camp in Bengaluru, citing the Jose Molina-managed team's own preparation of the AFC Champions League Two and dealing a blow to new India coach Khalid Jamil's preparations for the Central Asian Football Association Nations Cup.Of the 35-odd players picked by Jamil for the preparatory camp, Mohun Bagan have seven, the most from a single team. They are Anirudh Thapa, Deepak Tangri, Lalengmawia Ralte 'Apuia', Liston Colaco, Manvir Singh, Sahal Abdul Samad and goalkeeper Vishal Kaith.East Bengal have three players — Anwar Ali, Jeakson Singh and Naorem Mahesh Singh — called up for the same camp. East Bengal will take a call on releasing the trio after the tournament.India have been invited to play in the CAFA Nations Cup, co-hosted by Uzbekistan and Tajikistan and starting from Aug 29. This will be Jamil's first assignment as India coach.The AIFF had earlier sought cooperation from the clubs to release the players. But it has been learnt that essentially two factors — the federation’s ‘neglect’ towards player welfare and the tournament being held outside the Fifa window — have forced the Bagan management to take a confrontational approach towards AIFF’s request.",Mohun Bagan Super Giant are on a collision course with the All India Football Federation.

The Supreme Court has scheduled a hearing for August 22 regarding a dispute between the All India Football Federation and Football Sports Development Limited concerning 11 Indian Super League clubs' contracts.The conflict emerged due to non-renewal of agreements between the national federation and tournament organizers. These ISL clubs have expressed concerns about potential closure if the current situation remains unresolved.Justices P S Narasimha and A S Chandurkar will hear the case after amicus curiae Gopal Sankaranarayanan highlighted contract obligations.""If it does not, the AIFF should be directed to terminate the contract and float a tender. Otherwise the players suffer and after repeated non-payment, we can be sanctioned by the FIFA,"" Sankaranarayanan said.The clubs recently communicated their concerns to AIFF President Kalyan Chaubey about the crisis stemming from the non-renewal of the Master Rights Agreement between AIFF and FSDL.""Over the past 11 years, through sustained investment and coordinated effort, clubs have built youth development systems, training infrastructure, community outreach programmes and professional teams that have elevated India's footballing credibility both domestically and internationally,"" the clubs wrote in the letter.""This progress is now in imminent danger of collapse. The current standstill has created immediate and severe consequences. With operations suspended and no certainty on league continuity, several clubs face the real possibility of shutting down entirely,"" they said.The situation intensified when FSDL suspended the 2025-26 season on July 11, leading to operational challenges for several clubs.""The 2025-26 ISL season is at risk of not taking place at all.

EUPEN, Belgium - Lawyers for former France international Lassana Diarra said Monday he is claiming 65 million euros ($76 million) from FIFA and the Belgian soccer federation after a landmark legal win about transfer rules.Diarra's decade-long challenge to FIFA after a breakdown in relations with his former club Lokomotiv Moscow led to a ruling at the European Union's top court last October that some aspects of soccer's transfer rules do not comply with the 27-nation bloc's labor and competition laws.Lawyers for the 40-year-old former Chelsea, Arsenal and Real Madrid midfielder cited ""unsuccessful settlement negotiations with FIFA"" for the financial claim for damages throughout his career.""Lassana Diarra is claiming 65 million gross (35 million net) in compensation from FIFA and the Belgian Football Association,"" his legal firm Dupont Hissel said in a statement.FIFA was approached for comment about the latest high-stakes legal challenge to its authority.Diarra's case, which is back in court in Belgium, is supported by the global players' union FIFPRO, its European division and their national member union in France.The legal case started in the home country of Charleroi, the Belgian club that wanted to sign Diarra after his contract in Moscow was terminated.FIFA transfer rules at the time made the player and the potential signing club liable for paying the former club when a contract was ruled to have been broken without ""just cause."" The Court of Arbitration for Sport upheld FIFA's ruling in favor of Lokomotiv.The case was sent to the European court which said the FIFA rules ""hinder the free movement of players and competition between clubs.""Diarra's dispute with Lokomotiv and FIFA forced him to miss the 2014-15 season. He then signed for Marseille and ended his career at Paris Saint-Germain six years ago.""I am doing this for myself,"" Diarra said in a statement Monday published by his lawyers. ""And if I have been able to hold out against the FIFA steamroller, it is because I had a good career.""""But I have also done it for all the up and coming, lesser known players who do not have the financial and psychological means to challenge FIFA before real judges,"" he said.Diarra's lawyers also are working on a class action suit filed this month against FIFA and some national soccer federations in Europe which claims could benefit 100,000 players over more than two decades.","Former France international Lassana Diarra is claiming 65 million euros ($76 million) from FIFA and the Belgian soccer federation.

Poll Which team had the most impressive performance in the opening weekend of the Premier League? Arsenal Nottingham Forest Chelsea Manchester United

The Premier League ’s opening weekend offered plenty of drama on Sunday, with Arsenal edging Manchester United at Old Trafford, Chelsea frustrated by Crystal Palace and Nottingham Forest cruising past Brentford.At Old Trafford, Manchester United’s first full season under Ruben Amorim began with a narrow 1-0 defeat to Arsenal. Riccardo Calafiori capitalised on a mistake by stand-in goalkeeper Altay Bayindir to head home from a Declan Rice corner after just 13 minutes.United responded strongly, creating 22 attempts and dominating possession, but a £200 million front line of Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and substitute Benjamin Sesko failed to beat goalkeeper David Raya. Patrick Dorgu hit the post, while Cunha and Mbeumo were denied by Raya’s reflexes.However, a controversial call regarding an apparent foul on Matheus Cunha sunk the game into controversy. Fans on social media were livid as they claimed that William Saliba's attempt for the ball was completely missed and he ended up tripping up United's new signing Matheus Cunha. Despite several appeals from the Red Devils, no penalty wasDespite the defeat, Amorim was upbeat.“We need to win games but that was completely different to last season. We were the better team. In the end we lose the game, but really proud of the performance. We proved today we can win any game in the Premier League, against a great team like Arsenal,” the Portuguese coach said.In the other two games that took place on Sunday, Chelsea were held to a 0-0 draw against Crystal Palace. A stadium VAR announcement was made in a Premier League game for the first time ever as Palace saw a goal from Eberechi Eze denied. The game ended in a 0-0 draw, making it just the 2nd game in the league to have ended in a stalemate on matchday 1.Nottingham Forest on the other hand, got off to a roaring start against Brentford, thanks to a brace from Chris Wood and a dream Premier League debut for Dan Ndoye, which saw him score a diving header in the 42nd minute to help his side win 3-1.As the games on matchday 1 come to an end, Manchester City sit atop the table thanks to their 4-0 win over Wolves on Saturday.",Manchester United lost 1-0 to Arsenal at Old Trafford on Sunday.

Poll Do you think the new in-stadium communication system for VAR announcements improves the match experience for fans? Yes, definitely No, it complicates things

For the first time ever in the Premier League , fans inside Stamford Bridge on Sunday heard referee Darren England announce the outcome of a VAR review directly to the crowd. The new in-stadium communication system, introduced this season, was used during Chelsea’s goalless draw with Crystal Palace.The incident came midway through the first half when Eberechi Eze appeared to have given Palace the lead. The midfielder struck a powerful free-kick from the edge of the box, beating Chelsea goalkeeper Robert Sanchez and sparking celebrations among the visitors.However, those celebrations were short-lived. VAR advised referee England to review the goal on the pitch-side monitor. Initially, it seemed the strike had been disallowed because Palace defender Marc Guehi was judged to have pushed Chelsea’s Moises Caicedo in the wall.But following the review, the official addressed the stadium with the official explanation. His announcement went: ""After review, away number six is less than one metre away from the wall as the shot is taken. Therefore, it's an indirect free kick and a disallowed goal.""The message also appeared on the big screen, confirming that Guehi’s positioning was the infringement that led to the goal being ruled out.The Premier League Match Centre later provided further clarification, emphasising that the decision was based solely on Guehi’s distance from the wall when the free-kick was struck.Despite the controversy, neither side managed to break the deadlock, and the game finished 0-0. It was only the second goalless draw of the season, following Aston Villa’s stalemate with Newcastle United.For many inside Stamford Bridge, the bigger talking point was the historic first use of a referee’s VAR announcement in the Premier League, marking a change in how decisions are communicated to players and supporters.","Chelsea drew 0-0 with Crystal Palace at Stamford Bridge on Sunday.

What’s common between the three Formula E world champions

How the three World Champions fared in Formula E Season 11

Days after Oliver Rowland lifted his Formula E World Championship trophy in London this season, an interesting trend has come to the attention of Formula E and its fans. As a coincidence, all Formula E drivers who won the Mexico City E-Prix went on to win the Formula E World Championship that season, and this has been proved right for three consecutive years.Highlighting the same since 2023, a poster of three World Champions was shared on X by Formula E with the caption, “The trend continues. Each winner of the #MexicoCityEPrix from the past three seasons has gone on to become World Champion.”The special poster features 2023 Formula E World Champion Jake Dennis from Andretti, then TAG Heuer Porsche’s Pascal Wehrlein, who won in 2024, and the new World Champion, Nissan driver Oliver Rowland. All three of them won in the Mexico E-Prix and went on to lift the winner’s trophy in the Formula E World Championship that year.Oliver Rowland had strengthened his chances of winning the Formula E World Championship this year much earlier. He was leading the Formula E Driver Standings ever since he won Part 2 of the Jeddah E-Prix, which was his second win of the season after winning the Mexico E-Prix. In the last leg, the Nissan driver got nervous for a while as Pascal Wehrlein, who was following him in the number two position, closed the gap after grabbing quite a few podiums while Rowland had a dull period.Things became serious for Rowland when he failed to finish the Round 13 race in Berlin, while Wehrlein won second spot on the podium. But he eventually managed to confirm his championship in Berlin after four wins and three more podiums.Sharing about his bad race in Berlin, Rowland had said, “I was hoping before the weekend that the outcome could be [the World Championship], but after yesterday (Saturday) and this morning (Sunday), I was more worried that it might never come.”Also Read: Oliver Rowland reacts to daughter’s sweet radio message after Formula E Championship win: “It’s amazing” Things, however, changed for Wehrlein, who was pushed to third position after Nick Cassidy made a late entry in the Formula E Driver Standings by registering three consecutive wins. He was pushed from second place to third, with Cassidy in second. Wehrlein registered one win and five more podiums this season.Meanwhile, Andretti driver Jake Dennis finished in seventh position in the Formula E Driver Standings. He won two podium spots this season.","All three Formula E drivers who won the Mexico City E-Prix went on to win the Formula E World Championship that season.

Taylor Barnard on losing top three spot in Formula E World Championship

Fans hail Taylor Barnard for his fantastic rookie season

It was Taylor Barnard’s rookie season this year, and the NEOM McLaren driver put up a fantastic performance by temporarily making it to the top three in the Formula E Driver Standings by ousting the much more experienced Porsche driver Antonio Felix Da Costa. He was, however, ousted from the top three at the London E-Prix as Jaguar’s Nick Cassidy went on to register three consecutive wins. Barnard took to Instagram to share his feelings on losing out on the top three in his first-ever season and his claim to the championship.Taking to Instagram after the London E-Prix, Barnard wrote, “London wasn’t what we hoped for, easily being the toughest weekend of our season. Taking 0 points away as a team from a doubleheader hurts, but one weekend doesn’t define the year we’ve had.”He further wrote, “As the season closes, I want to say a massive thank you to the entire team, both trackside and behind the scenes, for everything this season. Finishing P4 in the Drivers’ Championship and coming into the final weekend with a shot at runner-up is something to be proud of.”Also adding a note for teammate Sam Bird, as NEOM McLaren withdrew from Formula E after the end of the season, Barnard wrote, “@sambird_official it wasn’t the weekend you deserved either.You’ve been a huge part of my season both on and off the track, and I’m grateful for everything. You deserved more. To all the Papaya fans, thank you for the incredible support in our final race together. You always go above and beyond. ”Reacting to his post, a fan wrote, “An incredible debut season, huge congrats and excited to see where you go next!” Another said, “I know I said it the other day, but you’ve been incredible to watch this last year and a pleasure to support you in Papaya — there are many of us that can’t wait to support you in whatever you do next!” One more commented, “You were incredible all season around, Taylor.

We couldn’t have done it without you all — your trust and support have never been taken for granted,” he added.Praising the two McLaren drivers, he wrote, “Sam clinched McLaren’s first-ever fully electric win at the São Paulo E-Prix in Season 10, pulling off one of Formula E’s all-time great overtakes, before being waved across the line by none other than Emerson Fittipaldi – McLaren's first Formula 1 World Champion. While Taylor has been a rookie sensation in Season 11, securing five Formula E records, including the youngest driver to start a race, the youngest points scorer, the youngest driver to lead a lap, the youngest podium finisher, and the youngest polesitter. ”He ended the letter saying, “Some of us have been together since the day we first launched this team, while others have seamlessly fitted in along the way and flourished within the environment we have cultivated. For many, I am sure that we will cross paths again soon, but whatever the future holds for those here at Bicester, whatever path they choose to follow, I have no doubt that it will be bright.

How do Formula E and ABB work together?

What do ABB and Formula E say about the partnership?

After a successful Season 11, ABB and Formula E have announced that they will continue their partnership in the upcoming season. This gives ABB another opportunity to promote its new brand positioning via the ABB FIA Formula E World Championship, along with technologies that help industries take a cleaner route.Over a period of eight seasons, the partnership with Formula E has provided ABB a platform to showcase how technology can help industries outrun challenges, engage with customers around the world, and implement its own solutions into the series to improve reliability and efficiency. The partnership extension will provide a year-round opportunity for brand-building and activation, communicating ABB and its technology solutions to new global audiences, including Formula E’s international fanbase.ABB and Formula E will also join hands to engage a new generation of fans, collaborating with unexpected influencers and content creators to tell compelling stories that make advanced electrification and automation technologies tangible and exciting.The end of the mid-race car swap, a 150kW increase in power, top speeds that are 43 percent higher, and energy recovery increasing from 15 to 50 percent indicate how far Formula E technology has come to outperform on track.ABB has also built on its technical involvement in the series, supplying the race chargers from Season 9, and introducing its ABB Ability OPTIMAX® energy management software (Season 9) and Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) technology (Season 5) to the sport.ABB Head of Brand Paco Liebrand said, “We are pleased to be continuing our partnership with Formula E which, like ABB, is striving for a leaner and cleaner future. The synergy between the two organizations, combined with the global appeal of the Championship, makes it a great platform to promote our brand positioning.”He further said, “Formula E is increasingly working with content creators, influencers, and celebrities, with initiatives such as the Evo Sessions making an impact through digital channels beyond the racing itself, which is also an essential part of ABB’s new brand strategy. Going forward, we will be enhancing the way we harness the benefits of this collaboration, ensuring the focus is on delivering content and activations that reinforce our new messaging, build familiarity, and tell the ‘Engineered to Outrun’ story. ”Formula E Chief Revenue Officer Tiziana Di Gioia said, “Our renewed partnership with ABB is a testament to the commercial power and benefit of Formula E as a global platform that drives both brand and business growth. ABB, like our wider partnership portfolio, has and continues to see enormous value in collaborating with the fastest-growing motorsport on the planet, with viewership, commercial integration, and brand storytelling continuing to accelerate. Over eight seasons, ABB has moved from brand visibility to brand activation—integrating deeply into the fan experience, the sport’s ecosystem, and our innovation narrative.Also Read: Antonio Felix Da Costa shares happy memories as Porsche wins Formula E Teams and Manufacturers’ World Championships “This next chapter elevates the partnership even further.

For long, doubles has been the overlooked event in tennis. Matches were largely played on the outside courts and moved up to the main courts only as the latter stages of the competition drew in. The prize money pales in comparison to the singles competitions. The big names, the highlights of the sport, would stay away from doubles and focus on singles.Even among the doubles events, mixed doubles played the inferior role. It is played only at the four majors and the team events in United Cup and Hopman Cup. The draws are smaller than the men's and women's doubles events. At the COVID-affected 2020 US Open, mixed doubles was one of the events scrapped. Even when the event has gone ahead, the broadcast coverage has been limited.That will all change this year. Carlos Alcaraz, Emma Raducanu, Novak Djokovic , Iga Swiatek, Daniil Medvedev, Naomi Osaka, Jannik Sinner, Alexander Zverev, Belinda Bencic, Ben Shelton, Elena Rybakina and Taylor Fritz are some of the big names who will be playing the mixed doubles competition.So what changed, you ask? Plenty. For one, the mixed event will take place before the main draw kicks in on August 24.It will be played over the course of two days (August 19-20) and held on the Arthur Ashe Stadium and Louis Armstrong Stadium - the biggest courts at the USTA Billie Jean King Tennis Center.The format also sees radical changes that will result in shorter, quicker matches which would be fitting for the singles specialists who can then take a breather before their set of matches get underway.Amid the glittering action, fans have lapped up the tickets to see their favourites in doubles action in this new format. Except the benefits of it will be reaped less by the doubles specialists.Only two doubles specialists - defending US Open champions Sara Errani and Andrea Vavassori - were initially drafted into the 16-team field. Among the doubles top-10, Katerina Siniakova and Taylor Townsend are the other players in the draw.When the announcement was made in June, it created an immediate clamour. Kristina Mladenovic, who won the 2013 Wimbledon mixed title, said it shouldn't be called a Grand Slam.Wimbledon mixed doubles champion Sem Verbeek, who is not in the draw and won't be able to target consecutive major titles, was sombre in his assessment: “As a doubles athlete, my heart is bleeding.”“A grand slam is a competition steeped in history, in singles and doubles,” said Mladenovic. “And now, all of a sudden, the doubles becomes a super exhibition without anyone or anything having a say. There’s no problem putting on such an event, but above all, don’t call it a grand slam!”Many agree with that belief. Teams were created based on star status rather than actual camaraderie. Emma Navarro and Jannik Sinner had barely spoken before they were paired as direct entry into the draw. Ever since, Navarro has pulled out and Sinner, who had illness issues in the Cincinnati Open final, could bow out too. Also not in contention with be USA's Coco Gauff and Tommy Paul.""It's a glorified exhibition in my eyes,"" said British doubles star Jamie Murray, as per BBC. And Murray has every reason to hold a gripe - with five, he has the most mixed doubles Grand Slam titles out of any active player.The opposing argument is that will bring in more eyeballs to tennis and help in an already saturated market. Or as US Open organisers call it, ""reimagine"" mixed doubles, ""elevate"" it and bring ""greater focus.""""We are always trying to find new initiatives to make our sport more interesting for the fans. I think it is fantastic,"" Daniela Hantuchova, who won the 2005 US Open mixed doubles title, told BBC Sport.Signs are already there. Alcaraz and Raducanu have been the biggest headlines since the announcement and Sinner, Swiatek, Venus Williams only take the star quotient higher.""For the excitement levels and for getting the fans to pack the stadium, it is a cool idea to have that star power come out,"" Mike Bryan told BBC Sport. ""Fans want to see Djokovic, Alcaraz and Sinner even if they are brushing their teeth.""Sure. But to label it as a Grand Slam win, going down in history books, handing the champions a $1 million prize cheque, feels disingenuous. Possibly adding an asterisk over the champions' name won't be the worst idea in such a scenario.","The event will take place over two days. Day one features the first round and the quarter-finals. Matches are best-of-three sets, with four games needed to win a set and no advantage at 40–40; the next point wins the game.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123380673,imgsize-34162,width-400,resizemode-4/123380673.jpg"
